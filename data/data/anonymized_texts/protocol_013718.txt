Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 30 of 136 1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY 
1.1 Synopsis 
Protocol Title: 
A Phase III Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Ensifentrine over 24 Weeks in Patients with Moderate to Severe 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. 
Short Title: 
A Phase III randomized, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
ensifentrine over 24 weeks in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
Rationale 
Verona Pharma plc. is developing inhaled nebulized ensifentrine for the maintenance 
treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). RPL554-CO-302 is one of 
the two Phase III confirmatory studies for the inhaled nebulized ensifentrine suspension 
formulation in patients with COPD. 
The two confirmatory studies RPL554-CO-301 and RPL554-CO-302 are planned as 
randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies intended to provide replicate evidence of efficacy in terms of improvements in lung function, symptoms and quality of life and the safety of ensifentrine compared to placebo in patients with moderate to severe COPD.  
Ensifentrine is a dual inhibitor of phosphodiesterase (PDE)3 and PDE4 which has 
demonstrated both bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory effects in clinical studies  
(Singh 2018, 2020  and Franciosi 2013 ). No dual inhibitors of PDE3 and PDE4 are 
currently approved for the treatment of COPD. As such, both studies are placebo-
controlled to assess the treatment effect of ensifentrine as a novel treatment for patients 
with COPD. The dose of 3 mg twice daily was informed by two Phase IIb studies in patients with COPD. The first study evaluated ensifentrine as monotherapy and the second study assessed ensifentrine as an add-on to tiotropium. Both studies showed that the 3 mg dose had an optimal benefit:risk profile. Because ensifentrine provides bronchodilation via its inhibition of PDE3 and PDE4, lung function endpoints are key 
endpoints for the evaluation of efficacy in patients with COPD. Additional endpoints 
validated in patients with COPD will inform on effects of ensifentrine on symptoms and 
quality of life from this dual mechanism of action. A treatment duration of 12 weeks is 
considered sufficient to demonstrate the bronchodilator effects, while a duration of 24 
weeks will inform on symptom improvement. Ensifentrine has demonstrated in Phase II studies additional meaningful bronchodilation when added on to current standard of care 
beta-agonist and muscarinic antagonist therapies.  
Protocol RPL554-CO-302 Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 31 of 136 RPL554-CO-301 will enroll approximately 800 patients with moderate to severe COPD 
in 2 subsets. The 24-week subset will enroll approximately 400 patients randomized 1:1 ensifentrine (3 mg): placebo and the 48-week subset will enroll approximately 400 
patients randomized 3:1 in order to minimize the number of patients assigned to placebo 
over 48 weeks. The assessments in each subset are identical over the first 24 weeks. The 
48-week subset will continue to assess long-term safety in this subset of patients.
Study RPL554-CO-302 is planned as a 24-week study that will enroll 800 patients and be 
randomized 5:3 to ensifentrine (3 mg): placebo and is otherwise identical to the first 24 
weeks of RPL554-CO-301. This study will assess population pharmacokinetic (PK) via 
sparse sampling in all patients.  
Both studies will assess lung function, symptoms, and quality of life over 24 weeks. 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed over 24 or 48 weeks.

Overall Design 
RPL554-CO-302 is a multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo 
controlled study to determine the efficacy and safety of ensifentrine 3 mg twice daily 
(BID) for 24 weeks, administered via nebulizer vs. placebo in patients 40 to 80 years of 
age with moderate to severe COPD (FEV 1 30% – 70% of predicted, FEV 1/forced vital 
capacity [FVC] ratio <0.7, with documented COPD symptoms).  
Up to 50% of patients recruited will be using stable background maintenance as either 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or long-acting ȕ 2 agonist (LABA) 
maintenance therapy for 24 weeks and all patients will be provided with rescue 
albuterol/salbutamol for use as needed during the study. Up to 20% of patients are 
allowed to take inhaled corticosteroids during the study under certain provisions (see 
Sections 6.7.2 and 6.7.3). Washout of patients on stable background maintenance LAMA 
or LABA monotherapy for the sole purpose of study eligibility is not recommended. 
Randomization will be stratified by two different factors: stable background maintenance 
LAMA or LABA therapy use (yes or no) and cigarette smoking (current or former). 
Patients will be randomized 5:3 to receive ensifentrine (3 mg):placebo for 24 weeks. 
Patients in the stable background maintenance LAMA or LABA therapy stratum must 
withhold Twice-Daily LAMA or LABA (or LAMA/ICS or LABA/ICS) for 24 hours and Once-Daily LAMA or LABA (or LAMA/ICS or LABA/ICS) for 48 hours prior to 
initiation of any spirometry. All patients must withhold short acting bronchodilator 
(SABA) rescue medication for at least 4 hours prior to initiation of any spirometry.  
All sites will use standardized spirometry and electrocardiogram (ECG) equipment 
provided by a central vendor and all spirometry and ECGs will be over-read by the 
blinded central vendor.  
Patients will be screened for eligibility before entering a 28-day run-in period to ensure a 
stable COPD treatment regimen and to collect baseline information on symptoms and 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 34 of 136 rescue medication use. Permitted rescue and background medications and the condition of 
their use during the study are described in Section 6.7.2 . Prohibited medications and the 
prohibited time intervals prior to Screening are described in Section 6.7.3. 
Patients completing the run-in period and meeting all entry and Randomization Criteria 
will be randomized. The two different stratification factors will be applied at 
randomization. Details on blinded study medication and administration are provided in 
Section 6 . The Study Schematic is shown in Section 1.2 . 
During the treatment period, patients will complete all assessments and procedures as outlined in the Schedule of Activities ( SoA, Section 1.3 ) for 24 weeks. Patients 
completing treatment will complete a Follow-up within 4 to 10 days of the last scheduled study visit. 
Patients meeting the withdrawal criteria during the study or who withdraw from the study 
for other reasons will be discontinued and requested to complete the Early Termination/ Withdrawal Procedures and complete a Follow-up within 4 to 10 days of the Early Termination/Withdrawal Visit. 
Patients who permanently discontinue double blind study medication may remain in the 
study and follow the assessments and procedures as noted in Section 7.2. 
Number of Investigators and Study Centers 
Approximately 151 Investigators and study centers are expected to participate in this 
study. 
Number of Patients 
Approximately 800 randomized patients are planned. 
Treatment Groups and Duration 
Randomization will be stratified by two different factors: background maintenance 
LAMA or LABA therapy use (yes or no) and cigarette smoking (current or former). 
Patients will be randomized active to placebo 5:3 for 24 weeks. The background therapy 
stratum will be capped at 50%. Patients in the background therapy stratum are expected to continue their background maintenance LAMA or LABA therapy daily throughout the 
duration of the study, with the exception of withholding 24 or 48 hours prior to 
spirometry as previously described.  
The approximately 800 patients meeting the Randomization Criteria will be randomized 
to receive the following treatments in a 5:3 ratio: 
Treatment Arm 1: Ensifentrine Nebulized Suspension; 3 mg BID 
Treatment Arm 2: Ensifentrine Placebo Nebulized BID 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 35 of 136 Overall, 500 patients will be randomized to ensifentrine and 300 patients will be 
randomized to placebo. 
All blinded study medications will be double-blind and administered using the inhaled 
route via a standard jet nebulizer supplied by the Sponsor. Nebulization time should be approximately 5 minutes but no longer than 10 minutes. 
Statistical Methods 
Efficacy analysis will primarily be performed on the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) 
population including all patients randomized and treated in the study. All tests will be two-sided at a 5% significance level. Secondary efficacy endpoints intended for label claims will be tested in a strict hierarchical order to preserve the alpha level. 
Primary endpoint, change from baseline in FEV
1 AUC 0-12h at Week 12, will be compared 
between treatments using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model adjusting for 
treatment, region, background medication strata, smoking status, and baseline FEV 1. 
Patients will be included in analysis as randomized. Missing data will be imputed to get 
as close to the mITT population as possible. Primary choice of imputation will be based 
on data collected at early termination visits or at visits performed after treatment 
withdrawal and, when no such data available, by the average change in the opposite 
treatment group as randomized to. 
Safety analysis will be descriptive and based on the safety set including all randomized 
and treated patients. Safety analysis will be by actual treatment received. 
The pharmacokinetics of ensifentrine will be characterized by nonlinear mixed effects 
modeling based on sparse sampling. The population PK (and population PK-PD, if performed) analyses will be performed in accordance with a separate modeling data analysis plan and will be reported outside of the clinical study report. 
Sample Size Approximately 800 patients will be randomized. The standard deviation for the change in 
peak FEV
1 is estimated to be 250 mL. With a 2-sided test at a 5% significance level and 
500 vs. 300 evaluable patients in the two groups, there will be an 90% power to detect a 
true difference of 59 mL between the treatments.

Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 44 of 136 2.0 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 Study Rationale 
Verona Pharma plc. is developing inhaled nebulized ensifentrine for the maintenance 
treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). RPL554-CO-302 is one of the two Phase III confirmatory studies for the inhaled nebulized ensifentrine suspension 
formulation in patients with COPD. 
The two confirmatory studies RPL554-CO-301 and RPL554-CO-302 are planned as 
randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies intended to provide 
replicate evidence of efficacy in terms of improvements in lung function, symptoms and 
quality of life and the safety of ensifentrine compared to placebo in patients with 
moderate to severe COPD.  
RPL554-CO-301 will enroll approximately 800 patients with moderate to severe COPD 
in 2 subsets. The 24-week subset will enroll approximately 400 patients randomized 1:1 
ensifentrine (3 mg): placebo and the 48-week subset will enroll approximately 400 
patients randomized 3:1 in order to minimize the number of patients assigned to placebo 
over 48 weeks. The assessments in each subset are identical over the first 24 weeks. The 48-week subset will continue to provide long- term safety data in this subset of patients.
Study RPL554-CO-302 is planned as a 24-week study that will enroll 800 patients and be randomized 5:3 to ensifentrine (3 mg): placebo and is otherwise identical to the first 24 weeks of RPL554-CO-301. This study will assess population PK via sparse sampling in all patients.  
Both studies will assess lung function, symptoms, and quality of life over 24 weeks. 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed over 24 or 48 weeks. 
2.2 Background 
Ensifentrine is a selective dual phosphodiesterase (PDE)3 and PDE4 inhibitor which has clinically demonstrated bronchodilation and anti-inflammatory activity following inhaled dosing. This novel mechanism of action represents an important potential additional 
treatment option for patients with moderate to severe COPD, and other respiratory 
indications such as asthma and cystic fibrosis whose disease is manifest by airways 
obstruction and inflammation. As a potential new treatment for COPD, this new 
mechanism of action can be used as a monotherapy or added to current inhaled standard 
of care bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory therapies, producing complementary effects in patients needing additional therapeutic options. Ensifentrine is first being developed as 
an inhaled suspension formulation for delivery via a nebulizer for patients with COPD. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302 Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 45 of 136 Ensifentrine has been studied in the nebulizer formulation in 15 clinical trials involving 
more than 1250 subjects. The initial nebulizer solution formulation was used in the first five clinical trials between 2009 and 2014.  
Ten clinical studies have been completed with ensifentrine delivered in a nebulized 
suspension format. The two most recent of the ten studies, 4-week Phase IIb study 
RPL554-CO-205 and Phase 1 study RPL554-PK-102, were performed using an optimized 
variant of the suspension formulation in which the phosphate buffer loading in the vehicle 
was reduced ten-fold. This optimized formulation, referred to as the ‘low phosphate’ 
formulation, is the proposed Phase III and to-be-marketed formulation. 
In the clinical studies performed to date, ensifentrine has demonstrated pronounced 
bronchodilator effects in healthy subjects and in patients with COPD or asthma. In single-
dose studies, ensifentrine alone was as effective as albuterol or ipratropium as a bronchodilator in patients with COPD (RPL554-009-2015;  Singh 2018 ). Ensifentrine has 
also demonstrated anti-inflammatory effects in a model of COPD-like inflammation in healthy subjects (Franciosi 2013 ).  
A 3-day study was conducted where nebulized ensifentrine or placebo was administered 
twice daily to patients with COPD as an add-on treatment to tiotropium (Spiriva®; 
RPL554-CO-202). In this study, statistically significant and clinically meaningful 
improvements in bronchodilation were seen compared to placebo. In addition, 
ensifentrine significantly reduced residual lung volumes and increased the speed of onset 
of the bronchodilator effect to under 5 minutes.  
In the first completed 4 week dose-ranging, 403-patient Phase IIb study, 
RPL554-CO-203, four dose levels of nebulized ensifentrine (0.75, 1.5, 3, and 6 mg) were 
administered twice daily to patients with moderate to severe COPD not taking additional maintenance bronchodilator therapies. All doses of ensifentrine met the primary endpoint, 
showing a statistically significant increase in peak FEV
1 vs placebo (p<0.001) with 
placebo-corrected changes from baseline >200 mL in peak FEV 1 after 4 weeks of dosing. 
In addition, statistically significant improvements in average FEV 1 over 12 hours were 
observed at all doses after the first administration, and this effect was sustained over 4 
weeks. Notably, statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in total 
COPD symptoms were shown using the Evaluating Respiratory Symptoms in COPD 
(E-RS™: COPD) measure, a validated daily assessment of stable COPD symptoms. 
Ensifentrine showed a meaningful reduction in symptoms on the total score and all 
subscales of the E-RS at or near the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of each. 
In a second recently completed 4 week dose-ranging, 413-patient Phase IIb study, 
RPL554-CO-205, with ensifentrine or placebo added on to maintenance tiotropium, 
4 dose levels (0.375, 0.75, 1.5, and 3 mg) of ensifentrine or placebo were administered 
twice daily to patients with moderate to severe COPD who remained symptomatic and 
with impaired lung function following a 2 week tiotropium run-in. All doses of 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302 Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 46 of 136 ensifentrine met the primary endpoint, showing a statistically significant increase in peak 
FEV 1 (all p<0.05) which was sustained over 4 weeks. For the two highest doses, 1.5 and 
3 mg, increases in peak FEV 1 were observed >100 mL compared to placebo after 4 weeks 
of dosing. In addition, a statistically significant and meaningful improvement in average 
FEV 1 over 12 hours was shown with the 3 mg dose at Week 4 (87 mL, p=0.0111). 
Notably, statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in health-related 
quality of life as measured by St. George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ)-COPD 
(Meguro, 2007 ) were observed at Week 4 with the 1.5 and 3 mg doses of ensifentrine 
added onto tiotropium (placebo-corrected; both p<0.05), which exceeded the MCID for 
both doses. 
Overall, ensifentrine was well tolerated in the 15 clinical studies conducted to date, with 
adverse event (AE) incidence and severity generally similar to those in the placebo-treated group. Serious adverse events (SAEs) have been uncommon and there is no apparent pattern in the SAEs reported to date.  
Verona Pharma is developing nebulized ensifentrine as a maintenance therapy for patients 
with COPD. Information on the background of ensifentrine as described in this section 
can be found in the Verona Pharma plc. Ensifentrine Clinical Investigators Brochure 
(IB) v. 20.0, 2021 (or more current version, if applicable), unless otherwise cited. 
2.3 Benefit/Risk Assessment 
No significant medical risks to patients have been identified from studies conducted thus 
far with ensifentrine administered in the solution formulation, suspension formulation, or 
dry powder formulation. A slight increase in mean heart rate (up to 12 beats per minute 
[bpm]) without reported medical significance at a 6 mg supratherapeutic doses has been 
reported in healthy volunteers (RPL554-PK-101). In patients with COPD, transient 
increases in peak heart rate of 3 bpm vs placebo have been observed with the 6 mg twice daily dose only over 4 weeks. Otherwise, non-clinical and clinical data to date do not 
indicate any areas of particular medical safety concern.  
Effects on reproductive performance in male rats given the highest dose of 15.5 
mg/kg/day included lower number of pairings of dosed males resulting in pregnancy in undosed females, higher pre and post implantation loss resulting in lower mean litter size, and lower sperm motility and higher abnormal sperm. No ensifentrine-related adverse effects were observed at 5.75 mg/kg/day (20.5 times the maximum recommended human 
dose based on area under the curve [AUC]). There were no effects on embryo-fetal 
survival and development in either rats or rabbits in the main embryo-fetal development 
studies. Ensifentrine had no effects on fertility or reproductive performance in female 
rats. 
Ensifentrine has statistically and clinically significant bronchodilator as well as 
anti-inflammatory effects. As such, the clinical development of ensifentrine is focused on the treatment of obstructive and inflammatory lung diseases, including COPD.

Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 50 of 136 4.0 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 Overall Design 
RPL554-CO-302 is a multicenter, randomized, double blind, parallel group, placebo 
controlled study to determine the efficacy and safety of ensifentrine 3 mg twice daily (BID) for 24 weeks administered via nebulizer vs. placebo in patients 40 to 80 years of 
age with moderate to severe COPD (FEV
1 30% – 70% of predicted, FEV 1/forced vital 
capacity (FVC) ratio <0.7, with documented COPD symptoms).  
Up to 50% of patients recruited will be using stable background maintenance as either 
long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) or long-acting ȕ 2 agonist (LABA) 
maintenance therapy for 24 weeks and all patients will be provided with rescue 
albuterol/salbutamol for use as needed during the study. Up to 20% of patients are 
allowed to take inhaled corticosteroids during the study under certain provisions (see 
Sections 6.7.2  and 6.7.3). Washout of patients on stable background maintenance LAMA 
or LABA monotherapy for the sole purpose of study eligibility is not recommended. 
Randomization will be stratified by two different factors: stable background maintenance 
LAMA or LABA therapy use (yes or no) and cigarette smoking (current or former). Patients will be randomized 5:3 to receive ensifentrine (3 mg):placebo for 24 weeks. 
Patients in the background maintenance LAMA or LABA therapy stratum must withhold 
Twice-Daily maintenance LAMA or LABA (or LAMA/ICS or LABA/ICS) for 24 hours 
and Once-Daily maintenance LAMA or LABA (or LAMA/ICS or LABA/ICS) for 48 
hours prior to initiation of any spirometry. All patients must withhold short acting 
bronchodilator (SABA) rescue medication for at least 4 hours prior to initiation of any spirometry.  
All sites will use standardized spirometry and ECG equipment provided by a central 
vendor and all spirometry and ECGs will be over-read by the blinded central vendor.  
Patients will be screened for eligibility before entering a 28-day run-in period to ensure a 
stable background maintenance LAMA or LABA bronchodilator medication regimen and to collect baseline information on symptoms and rescue medication use. Permitted rescue 
and background medications and the condition of their use during the study are described 
in Section 6.7.2. Prohibited medications and the prohibited time intervals prior to 
Screening are described in Section 6.7.3  
Patients completing the run-in period and meeting all entry and Randomization Criteria will be randomized. The two different stratification factors will be applied at 
randomization. Details on blinded study medication and administration are provided in Section 6.0 . The Study Schematic is shown in Section 1.2 . 
During the treatment period, patients will complete all assessments and procedures as outlined in the Schedule of Activities ( Section 1.3 ) for 24 weeks. Patients completing 
treatment will complete a Follow-Up within 4 to 10 days of the last scheduled study visit. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302 Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 51 of 136 Patients meeting the withdrawal criteria during the study or who withdraw from the study 
for other reasons will be discontinued and requested to complete the Early Termination/ Withdrawal Procedures and complete a Follow-Up within 4 to 10 days of the Early Termination/ Withdrawal Visit. 
Patients who permanently discontinue double blind study medication may remain in the 
study and follow the assessments and procedures as noted in Section 7.2. 
4.2 Scientific Rationale for Study Design 
Verona Pharma plc is developing inhaled nebulized ensifentrine for the maintenance 
treatment of COPD. RPL554-CO-301 is one of the two Phase III confirmatory studies for the inhaled nebulized ensifentrine suspension formulation in patients with COPD. 
The two confirmatory studies RPL554-CO-301 and RPL554-CO-302 are planned as 
randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled studies intended to provide 
replicate evidence of efficacy in terms of improvements in lung function symptoms and 
quality of life and safety of ensifentrine compared to placebo in patients with moderate to 
severe COPD.  
Ensifentrine is a dual inhibitor of PDE3 and PDE4 which has demonstrated both 
bronchodilator and anti-inflammatory effects in clinical studies ( Singh 2018, 2020 and 
Franciosi 2013 ). No dual inhibitors of PDE3 and PDE4 are currently approved for the 
treatment of COPD. As such, both studies are placebo-controlled to assess the treatment 
effect of ensifentrine as a novel treatment for patients with COPD. The dose of 3 mg twice daily was informed by two Phase IIb studies in patients with COPD. The first evaluated ensifentrine as monotherapy and the other added on to tiotropium which showed that the 3 mg dose had an optimal benefit:risk profile. Because ensifentrine 
provides bronchodilation via its inhibition of PDE3 and PDE4, lung function endpoints 
are key endpoints for the evaluation of efficacy in patients with COPD. Additional 
endpoints validated in patients with COPD will inform on effects on symptoms and 
quality of life from this dual mechanism of action. A treatment duration of 12 weeks is 
considered sufficient to inform on bronchodilator effects, while a duration of 24 weeks will inform on symptom improvement. 
Ensifentrine has demonstrated in Phase II studies additional meaningful bronchodilation 
alone or when added on to current standard of care beta-agonist and muscarinic 
antagonist therapies. Symptom and quality of life improvement has been shown over 4 weeks as monotherapy or added on to tiotropium. 
In RPL554-CO-301 and RPL554-CO-302, up to 50% of patients recruited will be using 
stable background maintenance as either LAMA or LABA maintenance therapy and all 
patients will be provided with rescue albuterol/salbutamol for use as needed during the study. Up to 20% of patients are allowed to take inhaled corticosteroids during the study 
under certain provisions (see  Sections 6.7.2 and 6.7.3 ).  Washout of patients on stable 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302 Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 52 of 136 background maintenance LAMA or LABA monotherapy for the sole purpose of study 
eligibility is not recommended to ensure a population with stable COPD is enrolled. 
Randomization in RPL554-CO-301 will be stratified by three different factors: treatment 
duration (48 or 24 weeks), stable background maintenance LAMA or LABA therapy use (yes or no), and cigarette smoking (current or former). The 48 weeks strata will be randomized active to placebo 3:1, and the 24 weeks strata will be randomized active to 
placebo 1:1. The 48-week subset is intended to inform on the long-term safety of 
ensifentrine vs placebo and the 3:1 randomization in this subset is intended to minimize the number of patients randomized to placebo for 48 weeks. 
Study RPL554-CO-302 is planned as a 24-week study that will enroll 800 patients and be 
randomized 5:3 to ensifentrine (3 mg): placebo and is otherwise identical to the first 24 
weeks of RPL554-CO-301. This study will assess population PK via sparse sampling in all patients.  
Both studies will assess lung function, symptoms, and quality of life over 24 weeks. 
Safety and tolerability will be assessed over 24 or 48 weeks. 
4.3 Justification for Dose 
A 3 mg twice daily dose was selected as the Phase 3 dose based on data from two 4-week 
Phase IIb studies RPL554-CO-203 and RPL554-CO-205 which show clinically 
meaningful and statistically significant improvements in pulmonary function with the 3 
mg dose over the 12-hour dosing interval, in patients with or without additional bronchodilator background therapy.  
A review of safety and tolerability across all COPD studies has shown a safety profile 
similar to placebo, even when added on top of other bronchodilator therapies: 
xNo dose-related trends in AEs (including those related to cardiovascular or
gastrointestinal systems) have been observed up to and including 6 mg twice dailyensifentrine in patients with COPD.
xChanges in electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters and vital signs (blood pressure and
pulse) have not been observed at any dose (except for a small and transient increase in
peak heart rate [~3 bpm] with the 6 mg BID dose in COPD patients after 4 weeks.
x24-hour Holter monitoring in 324 patients after 4 weeks (RPL554-CO-203) has notshown any data trends suggesting arrhythmogenic potential or difference compared toplacebo including 6 mg twice daily ensifentrine.
4.4 End of Study Definition 
A patient is considered to have completed the study if he/she has successfully completed all on-treatment randomized visits and completed the follow-up contact.  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last follow-up contact of the last patient 
in the study.

Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 59 of 136 6.0 STUDY TREATMENT 
Patients will be randomly assigned to receive double-blind study medication (either 
ensifentrine or placebo) administered using the inhaled route via a standard jet nebulizer 
(Section 6.2.2 ) supplied by the Sponsor. 
In this protocol the terms ‘investigational product,’ ‘double-blind study medication,’ and ‘blinded study medication’ are the same and refer to the blinded nebulized study 
medication. 
6.1 Administration of Blinded Study Medication 
6.1.1 Dosing in the Clinic 
The Clinic Visit MUST BE RESCHEDULED  within 3 days of the scheduled visit if 
any of the following apply: 
xIf the rescue medication or maintenance LAMA or LABA medication are not
withheld for the time intervals defined in  Section 6.7.2 .
xIf the morning dose of blinded study medication is not withheld.
Dosing Environment 
xTo avoid cross-contamination, blinded study medication dosing must be
conducted in a shielded and well-ventilated environment.
xPatients may be in the same room as other patients who are being dosed on thesame day if separated by a partial partition or curtain and if other patients and
other staff members cannot visualize the study medication administration by theblinded study site staff member. These measures are in place to protect study
medication blinding.
Designated Unblinded Site Staff Member 
To maintain the treatment blind, each site will designate an unblinded site staff member 
not associated with study conduct to administer in-clinic doses. 
Dosing Visit Schedule and Time(s) of Day 
Coordination of the timing of spirometry and in-clinic dosing with blinded study 
medication is critical.  See Section 1.4 , for the Schedule of Spirometry and In-Clinic 
Dosing with Blinded Study Medication. 
Blinded Study Medication Administration 
A new PARI LC Sprint® jet nebulizer (study supplied nebulizer), with a PARI Vios® 
PRO Aerosol Delivery System PARI BOY® compressor or equivalent (study supplied 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 60 of 136 compressor) will be dispensed to the patient and used to dose the blinded study 
medication in the clinic and at home.  
x Blinded study medication will be administered by inhalation of an aerosol 
generated by the reusable study supplied nebulizer attached to a study supplied 
compressor.  
x The unblinded site staff member should follow the nebulizer Set-Up instructions 
provided with the nebulizer and the Pharmacy Manual to prepare and administer 
the blinded study medication.  
x Administration of nebulized blinded study medication will be observed by the 
unblinded site staff member from start of nebulization until end time of 
nebulization. The unblinded site staff member MUST administer blinded study 
medication at all in-clinic dosing times. Patients may be discharged from the 
clinic after Week 12 assessments are complete to self-administer their evening dose of study medication. If administered in the clinic, the Week 12 evening dose 
must be administered by unblinded site staff. 
x Blinded study medication nebulization time should be approximately 5 minutes 
and may not exceed 10 minutes.  
x The end time of blinded study medication nebulization is when a slight sputtering 
sound from the nebulizer is heard. This will be considered Time 0 for the purposes 
of scheduling all post-dose study procedures.  
x The date, the start time, and the end time of blinded study medication nebulization 
will be recorded by the unblinded site staff member in the patient source 
document and the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
x Patients will take their study supplied nebulizer study supplied compressor and 
instructions home for use during the study. A new study supplied nebulizer(s) will 
be issued periodically. Only a study supplied nebulizer and a study supplied compressor may be used to administer blinded study medication during the study. 
6.1.2 Dosing at Home 
Following Visit 1, patients will self-administer their daily morning and evening doses at 
home at approximately the same times, approximately 12 hours apart, each day for the 
duration of the study, except for specific clinic visit days when patients will have their 
doses administered in the clinic.  
Prior to Dosing at Home 
x Patients in the maintenance LAMA or LABA stratum should take their maintenance 
LAMA or LABA (and ICS, if applicable) prior to taking blinded study medication. 
Blinded Study Medication Administration 
x Each patient will follow the Nebulizer Set-Up instructions and blinded study medication label to prepare and self-administer the blinded study medication by inhalation using the reusable study supplied nebulizer attached to the study 
supplied compressor. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302 Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 61 of 136 xBlinded study medication nebulization time should be approximately 5 minutes
and may not exceed 10 minutes.
xThe end time of blinded study medication nebulization is considered to be when a
slight sputtering sound from the nebulizer is heard. This will be considered Time 0
for the purposes of scheduling all post-dose study procedures.
xOn the evening Prior to the Week 6, Week 12 and Week 24 Visits (or Early
Term/Withdrawal visits where 12-hour spirometry will be performed): On a
patient paper diary, the patient will record the date, the start time of nebulization,and the end time of nebulization for the evening dose of blinded study medication.
Used Blinded Study Medication 
xPatients will be instructed to discard all used ampules of blinded study medication
and the open foil pouches that contained the used ampules at home.
Unused Blinded Study Medication 
xPatients should be instructed to bring all unused blinded study medication to theclinic at each clinic visit for collection and assessment of medication compliance
by the unblinded site staff member.
xIf a foil pouch is opened but the blinded study medication is not opened/not used,
the patient should seal the opened foil pouch (eg, tape) before returning it to the
clinic.

Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 63 of 136 6.3 Preparation/Handling/Storage/Accountability 
1. Blinded study medication should be stored below 25°C (77°F) and should not be 
frozen. 
2. An investigator or designee must confirm appropriate temperature conditions have 
been maintained during transit for all blinded study medication received and any 
discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of the blinded study medication. 
3. All blinded study medication must be stored in a secure, environmentally controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the labeled storage 
conditions with access limited to the Investigator and authorized study center staff. 
4. The temperature should be monitored, and logs maintained in areas where blinded study medication is stored. If temperature conditions have been compromised or any blinded study medication has not been stored appropriately, this should be 
documented, and the blinded study medication quarantined until the Sponsor has 
been notified and confirmed whether it may be used. 
5. Only patients meeting the Randomization Criteria in the study may receive blinded study medication and only authorized study center staff may supply or administer blinded study medication.  
6. The Investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) 
is responsible for blinded study medication accountability, reconciliation, and record 
maintenance (i.e. receipt, reconciliation, and final disposition records). 
7. Further guidance and information for the final disposition of unused blinded study 
medication are provided in the Pharmacy Manual. 
The Investigator, a member of the study site staff, the site pharmacist, or pharmacy team 
member must maintain an adequate record of the receipt and distribution of all blinded study medication using the Drug Accountability Form. These forms must be available for inspection at any time. 
6.4 Measures to Minimize Bias: Randomization and Blinding 
1. Both ensifentrine and placebo pouches and packaging are identical in appearance. 
2. Packaging of both ensifentrine and placebo will have a blinded description applied 
and all packs will have a unique kit number applied for identification. 
3. Deliveries of both ensifentrine and placebo will not indicate the actual product but 
will instead indicate a blinded description. 
4. Patients will be randomized to receive either ensifentrine or placebo using an 
electronic Interactive Response Technology (IRT). The IRT will not indicate the 
treatment arm during the randomization process but will indicate the unique kit 
numbers to be dispensed to the patient. 
5. Site staff (both blinded and unblinded) will only have access to blinded reports 
within the IRT. 
6. An unblinded site staff member not associated with study conduct will administer in-
clinic doses. 
7. If more than one patient will be at the clinic at the same time, they will be shielded 
from each other to prevent cross-contamination or observance of treatment. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 64 of 136 Note: Patients may be aware of the appearance when pouring blinded study medication 
into the nebulizer. Therefore, they should be instructed not to inform site personnel of the appearance of their blinded study medication. Similarly, study personnel are not to discuss the appearance with patients or other site personnel. Patients will be instructed to 
return unused blinded study medication (ie, unopened or unused blinded study medication 
in taped foil pouches) only to the unblinded site staff at their next visit. The investigator 
will need to confirm and document that the blinding procedures have/have not been 
maintained for each patient throughout the study. See Data Quality Assurance in 
Section 11.2 ).  
6.5 Emergency Unblinding 
The blind will be broken only if specific emergency treatment would require knowing the 
treatment status of the patient. If the blind needs to be broken, the Investigator will 
contact the Sponsor or Medical Monitor as soon as feasible. The Investigator may unblind 
the blinded study medication immediately if he/she feels it is necessary prior to 
contacting the Sponsor or Medical Monitor. However, the Investigator should promptly 
document and explain any premature unblinding to the Sponsor and Medical Monitor. Otherwise, all blinding will be maintained until all queries are resolved and the database is locked.  
Unblinding that occurs for any other reason, including unintentional unblinding, will be 
documented and promptly reported to the Sponsor and Medical Monitor. 
6.6 Blinded Study Medication Compliance 
The prescribed dosage, timing, and mode of administration may not be changed. Any departures from the intended regimen must be recorded in the eCRFs. 
At each visit, prior to dispensing blinded study medication, previously dispensed unused 
blinded study medication (ie, unopened or unused blinded study medication in taped foil 
pouches) will be retrieved by the unblinded site staff member and compliance assessed. 
Patients exhibiting poor compliance as assessed by the number of ampule/foil pouch counts dispensed and returned should be counseled on the importance of good compliance to the study dosing regimen and this counseling should be documented in the patient source document.  
Noncompliance is defined as taking less than 70% of blinded study medication during 
any evaluation period (visit to visit). 
6.7 Concomitant Therapy 
The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant or prior therapy. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 65 of 136 6.7.1 Rescue Medication 
Study albuterol/salbutamol should be used for rescue use. If study rescue 
albuterol/salbutamol cannot be dispensed at a scheduled clinic visit, the medication may 
be dispensed alternatively according to local requirements ( Section 8.6) . If at any time 
during the study albuterol/salbutamol is unavailable in a given country or region, the 
Medical Monitor must be contacted to discuss and approve alternative rescue medication 
(Section 8.6 ). 
6.7.1.1 Documentation of Rescue Medication Use 
x Documentation of albuterol/salbutamol during the 3 months prior to Screening should be recorded on the concomitant medication page of the eCRF along with 
reason for use, dates of administration (start and end dates), and dosing 
information (dose and frequency). End date should be documented as “Ongoing.” 
x Rescue albuterol/salbutamol used during clinic visits where spirometry will be 
conducted should be recorded in a module provided in the eCRF for each specific spirometry visit. Details (eg, dose (number of puffs), date, and time of administration) will be recorded.  
x Rescue albuterol/salbutamol used at all other times after Screening will be 
documented in the eDiary (eg, number of puffs per day). 
x After Screening, use of Rescue Medication will not be recorded in the 
concomitant medication page of the eCRF.

Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 70 of 136 7.0 DISCONTINUATION OF BLINDED STUDY 
MEDICATION AND PATIENT DISCONTINUATION/ 
WITHDRAWAL 
7.1 Discontinuation of Blinded Study Medication 
Patients who permanently discontinue blinded study medication are not required to 
withdraw from the study unless they test positive for COVID-19 active disease. If a 
patient must permanently discontinue blinded study medication for reason(s) other than testing positive for COVID-19 active disease, the patient should complete the “Patient 
Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study” assessments described in Section 7.3  as 
soon as possible. In addition, every effort should be made by the investigator/staff to keep the patient in the study to collect important efficacy and safety data as detailed in 
Section  7.2. 
Circumstances potentially requiring or actually resulting in discontinuation of blinded 
study medication are described below.  
See the SoA (Section 1.3 ) for data to be collected at the time of treatment discontinuation 
and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 
7.1.1 Does Not Meet Criteria for Randomization 
If a patient who does not meet the Randomization Criteria is inadvertently randomized 
and receives blinded study medication, the Medical Monitor must be contacted and will 
consult with the Sponsor to determine if the patient may continue, must be discontinued from blinded study medication and/or discontinued from the study.  
7.1.2 Liver Chemistry Stopping Criteria 
Discontinuation of blinded study medication for abnormal liver function should be 
considered by the Investigator when a patient meets one of the conditions outlined in Section 11.9  or if the Investigator believes that it is in best interest of the patient. 
7.1.3 Electrocardiogram Withdrawal Criteria 
All ECGs conducted or overread after a patient has been randomized will be subject to 
ECG Withdrawal Criteria ( Section 11.5 ). Patients may be discontinued from blinded 
study medication if they experience a significant abnormality(ies) on their ECG 
including, but not limited to those listed in the ECG Withdrawal Criteria, Section 11.5, 
and in consideration with the patient’s medical history and baseline ECG measurements. 
Clinically significant abnormalities as determined by the Investigator may also result in 
patient discontinuation from study medication per the Investigator’s judgement. Triplicate 
ECGs (over a brief period of time) should be performed on patients experiencing a 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 71 of 136 significant abnormality on their ECG or other clinically significant abnormality as 
determined by the Investigator. The intent of triplicate ECG measurements is to 
differentiate significant abnormalities from artifact. Abnormalities should be confirmed in 2 of 3 triplicate ECG measurements. 
7.1.4 COPD Exacerbation Withdrawal Criteria 
Guidelines for identifying COPD exacerbation in this study and conditions for study 
continuation or withdrawal due to COPD exacerbation can be found in Section 11.6 . 
7.1.5 Positive Pregnancy Test in Females 
Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding are not eligible to participate. Pregnancy 
testing is being conducted in women of childbearing potential at Screening and at other times specified in the SoA ( Section 1.3 ). 
Women exhibiting a positive pregnancy test ( Section 11.3) during the study will be 
discontinued from blinded study medication and followed-up per the Collection of Pregnancy Information guidelines in Section 8.7.5  and Section 11.8 . 
7.1.6 Positive COVID-19 Test Indicating an Active Infection 
Patients with a positive COVID-19 test result indicating an active infection will be required to discontinue blinded study medication and will be required to withdraw from the study. 
7.1.7 Other Criteria 
Other criteria that may or may not require permanent discontinuation of blinded study 
medication include but are not limited to adverse event, lack of efficacy, protocol 
deviation, non-compliance, study closed/terminated, investigator discretion or patient withdrawal of consent. 
7.2 Study Participation After Discontinuation of Blinded Study 
Medication 
Patients may permanently discontinue blinded study medication before the end of the 
study if they choose to or at the investigator’s discretion.  
Patients who permanently discontinue blinded study medication are not required to 
withdraw from the study unless they test positive for COVID-19 active disease. Patients 
who have permanently discontinued blinded study medication but do not test positive for 
COVID-19 active disease and have not withdrawn consent may continue in the study and complete all remaining protocol specified visits. 
The Investigator must document the reason for discontinuation of blinded study 
medication in the eCRF.  
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 72 of 136 Ideally, patients who have permanently discontinued blinded study medication will 
continue to attend scheduled clinic visits and complete important efficacy and safety assessments. However, if this is not possible then the investigator will encourage the patient to select one of the three options below to participate in as much of the study as they are willing (or able) to participate:  
7.2.1 Reduced Assessments 
The patient continues to follow the SoA ( Section 1.3 ) and completes only the following 
assessments: 
x Spirometry 
x SGRQ 
x COPD exacerbation 
x AE 
x Concomitant medication 
7.2.2 Combination of Phone Contact and Reduced Assessments 
The site contacts the patient by phone per the SoA ( Section 1.3 ) to complete the following 
assessments: 
x COPD exacerbation  
x SAE 
x Concomitant medication 
In addition, the patient returns to the clinic at Week 24 to complete the following 
assessments: 
x Spirometry 
x SGRQ 
x COPD exacerbation 
x SAE 
x Concomitant medication 
7.2.3 Phone Contact Only 
The site contacts the patient by phone per the SoA ( Section 1.3 ) to complete the following 
assessments: 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 73 of 136 x COPD exacerbation  
x SAE 
x Concomitant medication 
7.3 Patient Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request, may 
permanently discontinue blinded study medication but wish to remain in the study, or 
may be withdrawn from administration of blinded study medication or from all study participation at the discretion of the Investigator at any time for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. See the SoA ( Section 1.3 ) for data to be collected 
at the time of study discontinuation and follow-up and for any further evaluations that need to be completed. 
x If the patient withdraws consent for disclosure of future information, the Sponsor may retain and continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of 
consent. 
x If a patient withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any 
samples taken and not tested, and the Investigator must document this in the study center study records. 
7.3.1 Early Termination/Withdrawal Procedures 
If a patient is withdrawn prior to the Week 12 visit, every attempt should be made to have the patient complete the early termination/ withdrawal procedures in the SoA (Section 1.3 ) as soon as possible.  
x If possible, patients should remain on blinded study medication and their maintenance LAMA or LABA medication and ICS (if applicable), follow the 
withholding procedures prior to Spirometry in Section 8.3.1.2 , and should refrain 
from smoking or caffeinated beverages as recommended in Section 5.4.1.1. 
x Patients unable to remain on blinded study medication and/or their maintenance LAMA or LABA medications and ICS (if applicable) should still complete the 
early termination/ withdrawal visit as soon as possible. 
7.3.1.1 12-Hour Spirometry and 1.5 Hour ECG Procedures 
For patients who are withdrawn prior to completing the Week 12 visit only, every attempt 
should be made to have the patient complete the 12-hour spirometry procedures and the 
ECG procedures at the early termination/withdrawal visit unless consent is withdrawn or 
the patient is being withdrawn for safety reasons precluding this assessment.  
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 74 of 136 Patients who Continued Blinded Study Medication 
Patients who have continued administration of their blinded study medication should 
complete the spirometry and ECG procedures as follows: 
x Spirometry: Pre-dose and 0-12-hour post-dose assessments as per Section 1.4  and 
Section 8.3.1.  
x ECG: Pre-dose and 1.5-hour post-dose ECG procedures as per Section 8.4.2. 
Patients who Discontinued Blinded Study Medication 
Patients who have discontinued blinded study medication prior to the early termination/ 
withdrawal visit may optionally complete spirometry and ECG assessments at the early termination visit if they have not already completed the Week 12 assessments. These 
patients will not be dosed with blinded study medication. If possible, patients should start 
spirometry between 6 am and 10am, withhold rescue medication and/or maintenance 
LAMA or LABA medications for the time period specified in  Section 6.7.2 , and refrain 
from caffeinated beverages and/or smoking for the time period specified in Section 5.4.1. 
The spirometry and ECG procedures should be completed as follows: 
x Spirometry: Serial spirometry at 0-hour, 30 min, and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 12 hours.  
x ECG: 12-lead ECG at 0-hour and 1.5 hours. 
x Note: If a patient completed only one of the serial 12-hour spirometry or 1.5-hour 
ECG procedures at Week 12, they may optionally complete the other one (the one 
not completed at Week 12) at this visit.  
7.3.1.2 Single 12-Lead ECG  
Patients who early term/withdraw after Week 12 and are not completing either the pre-dose and 1.5-hour or the 0-hour and 1.5-hour ECG assessments described in 
Section 7.3.1.1 will complete a single 12-lead ECG as per Section 8.4.2. 
7.4 Lost to Follow-up 
A patient will be considered lost to follow-up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study center. 
The following actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the clinic for a required 
study visit: 
x The study center must attempt to contact the patient and reschedule the missed 
visit as soon as possible and counsel the patient on the importance of maintaining 
the assigned visit schedule and ascertain whether the patient wishes to and/or 
should continue in the study. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 75 of 136 x Before a patient is deemed lost to follow-up, the Investigator or designee must 
make every effort to regain contact with the patient (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the patient’s medical record. 
x Should the patient continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have withdrawn from the study. 
 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021

8.5.10.3 Determination of Drug Concentration 
Samples for the determination of plasma PK for ensifentrine will be analyzed on behalf of 
the Sponsor using appropriate validated analytical methods. Full details of the 
bioanalytical methods will be described in a separate Bioanalytical Report. All samples 
from patient assigned to treatment with ensifentrine during the study that are within the 
known stability of ensifentrine at the time of planned analysis by the bioanalytical 
laboratory will be analyzed; samples obtained from placebo patients will not be analyzed. Drug concentration information that may unblind the study will not be reported to study 
centers or blinded personnel until the study has been unblinded. Only the bioanalytical 
laboratory and unblinded biostatistician(s) who generate the randomization schedule may 
be unblinded to patient treatment assignment prior to database lock (DBL). 
8.5.11 Genotyping/ Phenotyping 
Genetic variation may impact a patient’s response to study treatment, susceptibility to, 
and severity and progression of disease. Variable response to study treatment may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease etiology; and/or molecular subtype of the disease being treated.   
Since it is known that ensifentrine is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP) isozymes 
2C9 (primary) and also 2D6, assessment of genetic variation will include the assessment 
of CYP2C9 phenotype and CYP2D6 phenotype of patients.  
The results of this pharmacogenetic research will be reported separately and will not form 
part of the Clinical Study Report (CSR). 
Approximately 8 mL of blood for DNA isolation will be collected from patients who have 
consented to participate in the genotyping/phenotyping analysis component of the study. 
Participation is optional. Patients who do not wish to participate in the genotyping/ 
phenotyping research may still participate in the study.  
In the event of DNA extraction failure, a replacement genotyping/phenotyping blood 
sample may be requested from the patient. Signed informed consent will be required to 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302 Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 88 of 136 obtain a replacement sample unless it was included in the original genotyping/ 
phenotyping consent. 
These samples may be stored for up to 1-year after the genotyping/ phenotyping analysis 
has been completed. 
Details on processes for collection and shipment and destruction of these samples can be 
found in the genotyping/phenotyping laboratory instructions. 
8.5.12 Biomarker Collection 
Collection of samples for other biomarker research is also a part of this study. 
Approximately 10 mL of blood for biomarker research is required and will be collected 
from all patients in this study as specified in the SoA (Section 1.3 ). 
Analysis of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, and C-reactive protein (CRP) will be conducted to 
evaluate the effect of ensifentrine on inflammatory biomarkers ( Section 11.3 ). 
8.6 Disaster Contingencies 
Prospective planning is required for this study due to the increased risk of a regional or global disaster (eg pandemic, natural disaster, terrorism). 
8.6.1 Site-Level Disaster Plan 
It is recommended that investigative sites prepare a written Disaster Plan for this study 
which describes how the site will manage patient activities and procedures in the event that site is not operating normally, site equipment is not available, and/or patient(s) 
cannot attend an in-clinic study visit. This written Disaster Plan could include but not be 
limited to a description of how the following activities and procedures will be conducted 
for remote visits or phone/video contact: 
xPhlebotomy collection
xVital signs collection
xBlinded study medication distribution
xRescue albuterol/salbutamol distribution

If a study supplied nebulizer cannot be distributed at a scheduled clinic visit or if the 
study supplied nebulizer requires replacement before attending a scheduled clinic visit, the study supplied nebulizer may either be picked-up by the patient directly outside the 
clinic, sent to the patient’s home via trackable mail/postal service (unless restricted by 
local requirements), or given to the patient at the next scheduled visit. 
8.6.2.3 Other Contingencies 
x eDiary: In the event of a problem with the eDiary or the paper diary for recording 
of medications and information specific to the PK procedures and sample analysis, a replacement eDiary and/or paper diary may either be picked-up by the patient 
directly outside the clinic or sent to the patients home according to local 
requirements. 
x Rescue medication (albuterol/salbutamol): In the event that albuterol/salbutamol is in short supply/not available in a given country or region, another medication may be substituted following consultation and approval by the Medical Monitor (unless 
restricted by local requirements). 
x COVID-19 Testing for Active Disease: A COVID-19 test may be conducted 
anytime a patient is suspected/exhibiting signs of active disease. If a COVID-19 test is positive for active disease, see Section 7.1.6  for next steps and Section 8.7.9 
for AE and other reporting. 
x Information relating to disruption of study participation due to COVID-19 will be captured in the eCRF (eg, reason for implementation of contingency measures, reason for missing data and relationship to COVID-19). 
8.7 Adverse Events 
The definitions of an AE or SAE can be found in Section 11.7 .  
Adverse events will be reported by the patient.  
The Investigator and any designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, and 
recording events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, considered related to the blinded study medication or 
study procedures, or that caused the patient to discontinue the study ( Section 11.7).  
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 90 of 136 As stated in Section 8.1.3 , medical and COPD condition(s) identified during the 
Screening Visit will be documented as medical history and not as an AE unless the 
condition worsens during the study and meets the definition of an AE. 
8.7.1 Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE Information 
AEs and SAEs will be collected from time of first dose of blinded study medication 
through the follow-up contact with one exception. Serious Adverse Events assessed as 
related to study participation (eg, study treatment, protocol-mandated procedures, 
invasive tests or change in existing therapy) will be collected from the time of consent 
through the follow-up contact. 
All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the Sponsor or designee within 24 hours, as 
indicated in Section 11.7 . The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the 
Sponsor designee within 24 hours of it being available.  
Investigators are not obligated to actively seek AE or SAE after conclusion of the study 
participation. However, if the Investigator learns of any SAE, including a death, at any 
time after a patient has been discharged from the study, and he/she considers the event to 
be reasonably related to the blinded study medication or study participation, the 
Investigator must promptly notify the Sponsor.  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AE and SAE and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section 11.7 . 
8.7.2 Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs 
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AEs and/or SAEs. Open-ended and non-leading verbal questioning of the patient is the preferred method to inquire about AE occurrences.  
8.7.3 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
After the initial AE/SAE report, the Investigator is required to proactively follow each 
patient at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, will be followed until resolution, 
stabilization, the event is otherwise explained, through the follow-up contact, or the 
patient is lost to follow-up (as defined in Section 7.4 ). Further information on follow-up 
of AEs and SAEs is given in Section 11.7. 
8.7.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs 
x Prompt notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor of an SAE is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of patients and the safety of a blinded study medication under clinical investigation are met.  
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 91 of 136 x The Sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority and 
other regulatory agencies about the safety of a blinded study medication under clinical 
investigation. The Sponsor will comply with country-specific regulatory requirements 
relating to safety reporting to the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees  (IEC), and Investigators.  
x Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSAR) according to local regulatory requirements and Sponsor policy and forwarded to Investigators, as necessary.  
x An Investigator who receives an Investigator safety report describing an SAE or other specific safety information (e.g. summary or listing of SAEs) from the Sponsor will 
review and then file it along with the IB and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate 
according to local requirements. 
8.7.5 Pregnancy 
x Details of all pregnancies in female patients will be collected after the start of blinded study medication and until 30 days after the last dose of blinded study medication.  
x If a pregnancy is reported, the Investigator should inform the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy and should follow the procedures outlined in 
Section 11.8 . 
x Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (eg spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs. 
8.7.6 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events of special interest have not been identified for ensifentrine.  
8.7.7 Disease-related Events and/or Disease-related Outcomes Not Qualifying as 
AEs or SAEs 
COPD exacerbations are an expected disease-related outcome. COPD exacerbations will not be collected as an AE unless they meet the definition of an SAE. COPD exacerbations 
should be captured on the COPD exacerbation eCRF (See Section 11.6 ). 
8.7.8 Medical Device Incidents (Including Malfunctions) 
The PARI LC Sprint nebulizer and PARI Vios PRO Aerosol Delivery System, and PARI 
BOY compressor or equivalent are being provided for use in this study for administration of blinded study medication.  
In order to fulfill regulatory reporting obligations worldwide, the Investigator is 
responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the definitions of 
incident or malfunction that occur during the study with such devices. 
The definition of a medical device incident, examples of incidents, and instructions for 
documenting and reporting medical device incidents are provided in  Section 11.10. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 92 of 136 Medical Device incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE/SAE will also follow the 
processes outlined in  Section 11.7 . 
8.7.8.1 Time Period for Detecting Medical Device Incidents 
x Medical device incidents or malfunctions of the device that result in an incident will be detected, documented, and reported during all periods of the study in 
which the medical device is used. 
x If the Investigator learns of any incident at any time after a patient has been discharged from the study, and such incident is considered reasonably related to a medical device provided for the study, the Investigator will promptly notify the Sponsor. 
x The method of documenting Medical Device Incidents is provided in Section 11.10. 
8.7.8.2 Follow-up of Medical Device Incidents 
x All medical device incidents involving an AE will be followed and reported in the 
same manner as other AEs (see Section 11.7). This applies to all patients, 
including those who discontinue blinded study medication. 
x The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow-up includes any supplemental investigations as indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of 
the incident. 
x New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed form 
with all changes signed and dated by the Investigator. 
8.7.8.3 Prompt Reporting of Medical Device Incidents to Sponsor/Sponsor 
Representative 
x Medical device incidents will be reported to the Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee 
within 24 hours after the Investigator determines that the event meets the protocol 
definition of a medical device incident. 
x The Medical Device Incident Report Form will be sent to the Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee by the same method as used for SAE reporting ( Section 11.7 ).  
x Contacts for Medical Device Incident reporting are the same as SAE reporting and can be found in Section 11.2  on the Medical Monitor Contact Information Page.  
8.7.8.4 Regulatory Reporting Requirements for Medical Device Incidents 
x The Investigator will promptly report all incidents occurring with any medical device provided for use in the study in order for the Sponsor/Representative to 
fulfill the legal responsibility to notify appropriate regulatory authorities and other 
entities about certain safety information relating to medical devices being used in 
clinical studies. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 93 of 136 x The Investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements (eg, the 
head of the medical institution), will comply with the applicable local regulatory requirements relating to the reporting of incidents to the IRB/IEC. 
8.7.9 COVID-19 Positive for Active Disease 
An AE/SAE of positive COVID-19 active disease should be documented as any AE/SAE 
occurring in this study would be documented per the guidance throughout this section 
(Section 8.7 ). In addition, local guidelines for reporting COVID-19 to local and/or health 
authorities should be followed. 
8.8 Treatment of Overdose 
An overdose is defined as a dose greater than the total daily doses prescribed in this study 
which results in clinical signs and symptoms. These should be recorded by the 
investigator on the AE/SAE pages.  
In the event of an overdose the investigator should use clinical judgement in treating the 
overdose and contact the study Medical Monitor. Verona Pharma is not recommending 
specific treatment guidance for overdose and toxicity management.  
 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 94 of 136 9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
9.1 Statistical Hypotheses 
The aim of this study is to show superiority of ensifentrine over placebo regarding 
selected efficacy measures. The null hypothesis to be tested for each endpoint will be that there is no difference between ensifentrine and placebo, against the alternative hypothesis that ensifentrine is better than placebo. All tests will be two-sided at a 5% significance level. Primary and key secondary endpoints used for claims will be tested in a sequential order to preserve the alpha level. Testing will stop once a not significant result is 
achieved. Test order will be FEV
1 AUC 0-12h at 12 weeks, peak FEV 1 at 12 weeks, weekly 
mean E-RS total symptom score at week 24, SGRQ total score at Week 24, morning 
trough FEV 1 at Week 12, FEV 1 AUC 0-4h at 12 weeks and proportion of SGRQ responders 
at 24 weeks. 
9.2 Sample Size Determination 
Approximately 800 patients will be randomized. The standard deviation for the change in FEV
1 AUC 0-12h is estimated to be 250 mL. With a 2-sided test at a 5% significance level 
and 500 vs. 300 evaluable patients in the two groups, there will be an 90% power to detect a true difference of 59 mL between the treatments. If the withdrawal rate at 
24 weeks exceeds 25% overall, additional patients may be randomized to the study to 
compensate for the loss of data. 
9.3 Populations for Analyses 
mITT population: will include all patients randomized and treated with blinded study medication in the study. Patients will be handled as randomized in the mITT analyses. 
PP population: will include all patients in the mITT without any major/important protocol 
deviations considered to have an impact on efficacy assessments. Reasons for exclusion 
will be specified at a Blind Data Review Meeting prior to database lock (DBL) and may 
include violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria, violations of withdrawal criteria, 
incorrect randomization, use of prohibited medication and non-compliance. 
Safety set: will include all patients randomized and treated in the study. Patients will be 
handled by actual treatment in the safety analyses. 
Pharmacokinetic set: will include all patients randomized to ensifentrine, receive at least 
one dose of ensifentrine, and have at least one quantified ensifentrine concentration at a 
scheduled PK time point after the start of dosing without important protocol violations 
and/or events with potential to affect PK concentrations. 
The population PK analysis set will be defined in the modeling analysis plan.  
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 95 of 136 9.4 Statistical Analyses 
9.4.1 Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy analysis will primarily be performed on the mITT population. The primary 
endpoint and key secondary endpoints will also be evaluated using the PP population as a sensitivity analysis. Impact of imputations and various baseline characteristics will also 
be checked.  
The primary endpoint, change from baseline in FEV
1 AUC 0-12h at Week 12, will be 
compared between treatments using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model 
adjusting for treatment, region, background medication strata, and smoking status as 
factors and baseline FEV 1 as covariate. The estimated treatment difference with 95% 
confidence interval and associated (two-sided) p-value will be presented. Missing data will be imputed to get as close to the mITT population as possible. Primarily imputation 
will be based on data collected at visits performed after treatment withdrawal or at early 
termination visits even if outside visit window. When no such data is available, 
imputation will primarily be done using multiple imputation based on baseline characteristics and secondarily, as a sensitivity analysis, by the average change in the 
opposite treatment group as randomized to as a worst-case scenario. Further details on the 
handling of missing data will be given in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
Key secondary endpoints, FEV
1 AUC 0-4h, peak FEV 1, morning trough FEV 1, SGRQ total 
score and weekly mean E-RS total score, and other continuous secondary or exploratory 
endpoints will be assessed repeatedly during the study and the change from baseline to 
pre-specified time point of evaluation will be compared by similar ANCOVA models 
adjusting for treatment, region, background medication strata and smoking status as 
factors and baseline as covariate. Data collected at visits performed after treatment withdrawal or at early termination visits will be used in the analyses. Remaining missing data will primarily be imputed using multiple imputation based on baseline characteristics and data collected at post-randomization visits. Since assessed repeatedly, in contrast to primary endpoint, these data will also be analyzed for sensitivity by mixed model 
repeated measures models with treatment, visit and treatment by visit interaction as 
factors, baseline as covariate, subject as random factor and covariance structure by visit. 
The proportion of responders on the SGRQ, patients with an improvement of at least 4 
units, will be compared between treatment groups using a logistic regression model with 
fixed factors treatment, region, and background medication strata, and smoking status. Imputation of missing data will be done similar as for continuous endpoints. A sensitivity analysis will be performed in which patients with missing data at the required visit will be considered non-responder in the analysis.  
The time to first COPD exacerbation during the 24 or 48 week treatment period, 
depending on stratification, will be visualized using a Kaplan-Meier plot and compared between treatment groups using the log-rank test, stratified by region, background medication strata, and smoking status. As a secondary evaluation a Cox’s proportional 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 96 of 136 hazards model will be used with the same factors. Patients without exacerbations will be 
censored at last day in the treatment period, including period of recording after possible 
treatment withdrawal. The treatment difference in the Cox model will be expressed as a hazard ratio. Assumption of proportional hazards will be checked. The number of COPD 
exacerbations during the 24- or 48-week treatment period will be compared between 
treatments using a negative binomial model adjusting for treatment, region, background 
medication strata and smoking status and further using the log exposure time as an offset. 
The treatment difference from the negative binomial model will be expressed as an 
annualized risk ratio. 
Subgroup analyses will be performed for the primary endpoint and selected secondary 
endpoints by gender, age-class (below or above 65 years), region, background medication strata, smoking status, ICS use, known chronic bronchitis, and FEV
1 reversibility at 
baseline ( 12% and   200 mL). 
9.4.2 Safety Analyses 
Safety analysis will be based on the safety set.  
Adverse events will be analyzed using quantitative and qualitative measures. Treatment-
emergent adverse events will be summarized by treatment group for all AEs, related AEs, 
serious adverse events, deaths, adverse events leading to discontinuation of blinded study 
medication or to withdrawal from study, adverse events of different severity and adverse events of different chronicity. Treatment-emergent adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and summarized by system organ class and preferred term for each treatment group. For selected adverse events, time to first event will be visualized using Kaplan-Meier plots. 
Laboratory data will be summarized by each visit including change from baseline. The 
number of normal, abnormal not clinically significant and abnormal clinically significant 
values on each parameter will be summarized for change over study using shift tables. All data will be listed and values outside reference ranges will be highlighted in the listings. 
Vital signs and continuous parameters from the ECGs will be summarized by each visit 
including change from baseline. Values outside pre-specified ranges (low, high) or 
changes exceeding pre-specified limits will be summarized by visit for each parameter. 
The number of normal, abnormal not clinically significant and abnormal clinically significant values on the ECG overall evaluation will be summarized for change over study using shift tables. All data will be listed and values outside reference ranges will be highlighted in the listings.  
9.4.3 Other Analyses 
The patient flow including total number of screened patients, number of randomized 
patients, completers, withdrawn patients (including reason for withdrawal) and patients 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 97 of 136 included in each of the analysis sets will be summarized by treatment group and for the 
total. 
The number of patients with major protocol deviations will be summarized by category of 
violation and by treatment group including subset of major protocol deviation leading to exclusion from the per-protocol set. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics 
for each treatment group and for the total number of randomized patients. Medical history 
will be coded using MedDRA and summarized by system organ class and preferred term for each treatment group. Prior medications will denote medications used prior to first 
dose of study drug independent of if stopped at randomization or not. Concomitant 
medications will denote medications started prior to but continuing after randomization or 
medications with a start date at or after the randomization date. Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized separately by Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) levels 2 and 4. 
Compliance to blinded study medication will be computed based on the number of 
ampules/foil pouch count dispensed and returned. Non-compliance will be defined as a 
compliance value less than 70% over the full study period. Secondarily, compliance will 
also be computed based on recording of study drug intake in the diary. 
The impact of COVID-19 on the study participation of all patients will captured on a 
separate eCRF page and include items such as attendance at in-clinic study visits. Details 
of presentation will be outlined in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
9.4.4 Missing Data 
All data collected after treatment withdrawal will be used in the analyses. Patients 
withdrawn from study will perform an End-of-Study visit after decision to withdraw the patient has been made. Data collected at such visits will be used for analysis even if outside the visit window for the endpoint. Remaining missing data will primarily be 
imputed using multiple imputation based on baseline characteristics and data collected at 
post-randomization visits. In addition, a worst-case scenario using the average change in 
the opposite treatment group will be used for imputation as a sensitivity analysis. For the 
responder analysis of SGRQ, patients with no available data for imputation will be 
considered non-responders as a sensitivity analysis. In exacerbation analyses, patients are included with data collected up to last day in the treatment period/period of recording following treatment withdrawal. 
9.4.5 Pharmacokinetics 
All reported plasma concentrations will be listed and summarized using appropriate 
descriptive statistics. Graphical presentations of concentration data will be provided, if 
appropriate. 
 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 98 of 136 Ensifentrine concentrations will be used for a population PK analysis of ensifentrine. The 
pharmacokinetics of ensifentrine will be characterized by nonlinear mixed effects modeling based on sparse sampling. From the established model, the influence of various demographic covariates (eg, body weight, gender, genotype) and other patient-specific 
factors on ensifentrine exposure may be assessed. The data from this study may be 
combined with data collected from other studies for a pooled meta-analysis using 
modeling and simulation to estimate PK parameters as well as exposure – response 
(safety) correlations. The population PK (and population PK-PD, if performed) analyses 
will be performed in accordance with a separate modeling data analysis plan and will be reported outside of the clinical study report. 
9.5 Interim Analyses 
There will be no formal interim analysis in the study. Blinded data will be monitored continuously and the assumptions for the variability in data checked as well as the 
withdrawal rate.

Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 116 of 136 11.6 Appendix 6: Guidelines for Identifying COPD Exacerbation 
11.6.1 COPD Exacerbation Signs and Symptoms 
The following are signs and symptoms of an exacerbation of COPD ( Anthonisen, 1987): 
 
Worsening of two or more of the following major symptoms for at least two consecutive 
days: 
x Dyspnea 
x Sputum volume 
x Sputum purulence (color) 
OR 
Worsening of any one major symptom together with any one of the following minor 
symptoms for at least two consecutive days: 
x Sore throat 
x Colds (nasal discharge and/or nasal congestion) 
x Fever (oral temperature >37.5 °C) without other cause 
x Increased cough 
x Increased wheeze 
Patients experiencing worsening COPD symptoms for greater than 24 hours should: 
x Contact the Investigator/study site immediately if they feel they need medical 
assistance.  
x If the patient is unable to contact the Investigator/ study site, they should contact 
their primary care physician (or other health care practitioner as required) and 
contact the study site as soon as possible. 
x Continue to record their symptoms and rescue albuterol/salbutamol use in their 
eDiary. 
x If the patient seeks emergency/acute care for worsening respiratory symptoms, 
he/she should request the Health Care Provider (HCP) to contact the Investigator as 
soon as possible.  
11.6.2 COPD Symptom Verification 
Each exacerbation event will be verified with symptoms as defined in Section 11.6.1 and 
these symptoms will be documented in the case report form as part of the exacerbation 
assessment. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302 Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 117 of 136 11.6.3 COPD Exacerbation Severity:  
The definition of COPD exacerbation severity is as follows: 
11.6.3.1 Moderate 
A moderate exacerbation is defined as worsening symptoms of COPD requiring a minimum 
of three days of treatment with oral/systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotics. 
11.6.3.2 Severe 
A severe exacerbation is defined as worsening symptoms of COPD requiring in-patient 
hospitalization. 
11.6.3.3 Guideline for assessing exacerbations that increase in severity 
If an exacerbation begins as moderate but becomes severe, the exacerbation should be 
captured as severe. 
11.6.4 Onset and Resolution of COPD Exacerbations:  
The date of onset is the first day of the worsening of signs and symptoms of COPD 
exacerbation.  
The date of resolution is when the Investigator and/or patient ascertain the signs and 
symptoms have returned to pre-exacerbation levels or to a new baseline.  
The date of onset and the date of resolution will be recorded in the eCRF. 
11.6.5 Treatment of COPD Exacerbations  
11.6.5.1 Guidelines for Treatment with Corticosteroids 
xThe duration of treatment with oral/systemic corticosteroids should be less than or
equal to 14 days (dose and type according to local practice).
xThe duration of treatment with oral/systemic corticosteroids greater than 14 days
should be discussed with the Medical Monitor and Sponsor to determine if the patient
should remain in the study.
xAny course of oral/systemic corticosteroids started within 7 days of finishing aprevious course will be considered as treatment for a single exacerbation.
11.6.5.2 Guidelines for Treatment with Antibiotics  
If there is evidence of respiratory infection that warrants treatment with antibiotics in the 
opinion of the Investigator or treating physician, the following guidelines should be used: 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302 Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 118 of 136 xThe duration of treatment with antibiotics should be 7 to 14 days (dose and type
according to local practice). If first antibiotic treatment fails and additional antibioticsare warranted, the total duration of antibiotic treatment should not exceed 30 days. Ifthe duration of treatment with antibiotics needs to be greater than 30 days, the
Investigator or treating physician should discuss the patient with the Medical Monitor
and Sponsor to determine if the patient should remain in the study.
xAny course of antibiotics started within 7 days of finishing a previous course will be
considered as treatment for a single exacerbation.
Use of antibiotics for the treatment of upper or lower respiratory tract infections is not considered a COPD exacerbation unless the patient experiences worsening of signs and 
symptoms associated with exacerbations as given above. 
11.6.6 Recording COPD Exacerbations 
Exacerbation details will be recorded in the exacerbation form of the eCRF. COPD 
exacerbations will not be recorded as adverse events (AE), unless they meet the definition 
of a serious adverse event (SAE). Pneumonia details will be recorded in the Pneumonia 
form of the eCRF and will also be recorded as an AE or SAE. Pneumonia should be 
confirmed by chest-x-ray. Every effort should be made to obtain a chest x-ray within 48 hours suspected pneumonia. 
11.6.7 Study Continuation or Withdrawal Due to COPD Exacerbation 
xPatients who experience a single COPD exacerbation during the treatment period
may remain in the study and should continue to take their blinded study medicationif possible and record their symptoms and rescue albuterol/salbutamol usage in theireDiary.
xPatients who experience a second COPD exacerbation and/or a severe COPDexacerbation that requires in-patient hospitalization will be discontinued from studytreatment ( Section 7.0 ).
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 119 of 136 11.7 Appendix 7: Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow-up and Reporting 
Definition of AE 
x An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or subject, temporally 
associated with the use of blinded study medication, whether or not considered related 
to the blinded study medication. 
x NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of blinded study medication. 
Events Meeting the AE Definition 
x Any abnormal laboratory test results (eg, hematology, clinical chemistry) or other 
safety assessments (eg, ECG, radiological scans, vital signs measurements), including 
those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically significant in the medical and 
scientific judgment of the Investigator (ie, not related to progression of underlying 
disease).  
x Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre-existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition. 
x New conditions detected or diagnosed after blinded study medication administration 
even though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
x Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected drug-drug interaction.  
x Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either blinded study medication or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported 
as an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self-harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae. 
x “Lack of efficacy” or “failure of expected pharmacological action” per se will not be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy assessments. However, the signs, symptoms and/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
lack of efficacy will be reported as an AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE 
or SAE. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302 Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 120 of 136 Events NOT Meeting the AE Definition 
xAny clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unless judged bythe Investigator to be more severe than expected for the patient’s condition.
xThe disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms ofthe disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for thepatient’s condition.
xMedical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that
leads to the procedure is the AE.
xSituations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or
convenience admission to a hospital).
xAnticipated day-to-day fluctuations of pre-existing disease(s) or condition(s)
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.
Definition of SAE 
If an event is not an AE per definition above, then it cannot be an SAE even if serious 
conditions are met (eg, hospitalization for signs/symptoms of the disease under study, death due to progression of disease). 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that, at any dose: 
a) Results in death
b) Is life-threatening
The term ‘life-threatening’ in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c) Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
In general, hospitalization signifies that the patient has been detained (usually 
involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation 
and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or 
outpatient setting. Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfills any other serious criteria, the event is 
serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
from baseline is not considered an AE. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 121 of 136 d) Results in persistent disability/incapacity  
x The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
x This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical 
significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, and accidental trauma (eg, sprained ankle) which may interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption. 
e) Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
f) Other situations: 
Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether SAE 
reporting is appropriate in other situations such as important medical events that may 
not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one 
of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These events should usually be 
considered serious.  
Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency 
or drug abuse. 
Recording and Follow-up of AE and/or SAE 
AE and SAE Recording 
x When an AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all 
documentation (eg, hospital progress notes, laboratory reports, and diagnostics 
reports) related to the event.  
x The Investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information in the eCRF. Each event must be recorded separately. 
x It is not acceptable for the Investigator to send photocopies of the patient’s 
medical records to Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee in lieu of completion of the Verona Pharma /AE/SAE eCRF page.  
x There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are requested by groups such as the Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee, Health Authority, or Ethics Committee. In this case, all patient identifiers, with the exception of the 
subject/patient number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before submission to records to the Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee.  
x The Investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE. 
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 122 of 136 Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study and assign it to one of the following categories: 
x Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the patient, causing minimal discomfort and 
not interfering with everyday activities.  
x Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal everyday activities.  
x Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severe is a category utilized for rating the intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  
An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe. 
Assessment of Chronicity  
x Single occasion: Single event with limited duration. 
x Intermittent: Several episodes of an event, each of limited duration 
x Persistent: Event which remained indefinitely. 
Assessment of Causality  
x The Investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between blinded study 
medication and each occurrence of each AE/SAE. The AE must be characterized as unrelated, unlikely to be related, possibly related, probably related, or unknown 
(unable to judge).  
- “Probably related” conveys that there are facts, evidence, and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot be ruled out.  
- “Possibly related” suggests that the association of the AE with the blinded study 
medication is unknown; however, the AE is not reasonably supported by other 
conditions.  
- “Unlikely to be related” suggests that only a remote connection exists between the 
blinded study medication and the AE. Other conditions, including chronic illness, 
progression or expression of the disease state or reaction to concomitant therapy, 
appear to explain the reported AE.  
- “Unrelated” is used if there is not a reasonable possibility that the blinded study 
medication caused the AE.  
- All efforts should be made to classify the AE according to the above categories. The category “unknown” (unable to judge) may be  used only if the causality is not 
assessable (eg, because of insufficient evidence, conflicting evidence, conflicting 
data, or poor documentation). 
x The Investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
Protocol RPL554-CO-302 Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 123 of 136 xAlternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other risk
factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to blinded study medication
administration will be considered and investigated.
xThe Investigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure ( IB) in his/her
assessment.
xFor each AE/SAE, the Investigator must document in the medical notes that he/she
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provided an assessment of causality.
xThere may be situations in which an SAE has occurred and the Investigator has
minimal information to include in the initial report to the Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee.However, it is very important that the Investigator always make an assessment of
causality for every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to theSponsor/Sponsor’s designee.
xThe Investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow-up
information and send a SAE follow-up report with the updated causality assessment.
xThe causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory
reporting requirements.
Action and Outcome  
xAction taken with blinded study medication (none, blinded study medication
stopped, blinded study medication temporarily interrupted)
xOther actions (none, concomitant medication, study discontinuation,hospitalization, other)
xThe outcome and date of outcome according to the following definitions:
-Recovered or resolved (adverse event disappeared)
-Recovered or resolving (patient is recovering)
-Not recovered or not resolved (adverse event remains without signs ofimprovement)
-Recovered or resolved with sequelae (adverse event has resulted in
permanent disability or incapacity)
-Fatal
-Unknown (only applicable if patient has been lost to follow-up)
xSeriousness (yes or no)
Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
xThe Investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by the
Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAEas fully as possible. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations,
histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.
xIf a patient dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow-up
period, the Investigator will provide the Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee with a copy of
any postmortem findings including histopathology.
xNew or updated information will be recorded in the originally completed eCRF.
Protocol RPL554-CO-302   Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 124 of 136 x The Investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the Sponsor/Sponsor’s 
Designee within 24 hours of receipt of the information. 
Reporting of SAEs 
SAE Reporting to the Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee via an Electronic Data Collection 
Tool 
x The primary mechanism for reporting an SAE to the Sponsor/Sponsor’s designee 
will be the electronic data collection tool.  
x If the electronic system is unavailable, then the study center will use the paper 
SAE data collection tool (see next section).  
x The study center will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it 
becomes available.  
x After the study is completed at a given study center, the electronic data collection 
tool will be taken off-line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing 
data. 
x If a study center receives a report of a new SAE from a patient or receives updated 
data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic data collection tool has 
been taken off-line, then the study center can report this information on a paper 
SAE form (see next section) or to the Medical Monitor/SAE coordinator by 
telephone.  
x Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in Section 11.2 on the Medical Monitor 
Contact Information page. 
SAE Reporting to Sponsor/ Sponsor’s Designee via Paper CRF if eCRF is not 
available 
x If the eCRF is not available, facsimile transmission of the SAE paper CRF may be 
used to transmit this information to the Medical Monitor or the SAE coordinator.  
x In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notification by 
telephone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by overnight mail or courier service.  
x Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the Investigator to complete and sign the SAE CRF pages within the designated reporting time frames.  
x Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in  Section 11.2 on the Medical Monitor 
Contact Information page.

Pregnancy Information 
Definitions:  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming postmenopausal 
unless permanently sterile (see below).  
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP 
1. Premenarchal: Note premenarchal females ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE
in this study.2. Premenopausal female with 1 of the following:
a) Documented hysterectomy.b) Documented bilateral salpingectomy.
c) Documented bilateral oophorectomy. Note: Documentation can come from the study
center personnel’s: review of the patient’s medical records, medical examination, or
medical history interview.
3. Postmenopausal female:
a) Postmenopausal females are defined as amenorrhoeic for greater than 1 year with an
appropriate clinical profile, eg, age appropriate, > 45 years, in the absence of hormonereplacement therapy.
Contraception Guidance  
Male Patients 
xMale patients with female partners of childbearing potential are eligible to
participate if they agree to ONE of the following from the first dose up to 30 daysafter the last dose of study medication:
-Are abstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse as their usual and preferred
lifestyle (abstinent on a long-term and persistent basis) and agree to remain
abstinent.
-Agree to use a male condom plus partner use of a contraceptive methodwith a failure rate of < 1% per year as described in Table 14  when having
penile-vaginal intercourse with a woman of childbearing potential who is
not currently pregnant.
xIn addition, male patients must refrain from donating sperm for the duration of the
study and for 30 days after the last dose of study medication.
xMale patients with a pregnant or breastfeeding partner must agree to remainabstinent from penile-vaginal intercourse or use a male condom during each
episode of penile penetration during the study and for 30 days after the last dose
of study medication.

Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective birth control method provided that the 
partner is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be 
used. 
Sexual abstinence 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective method only if defined as refraining 
from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study 
treatment. The reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the 
duration of the study and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. 
NOTES: 
a Typical use failure rates may differ from those when used consistently and correctly. 
Use should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for patients participating in clinical studies.

bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interaction with the study treatment, 
which may reduce the efficacy of the contraceptive method. In this case, 2 highly 
effective methods of contraception should be utilized during the treatment period and 
for at least 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. 
Pregnancy Testing: 
x WOCBP should only be included after a negative highly sensitive pregnancy test. 
x Additional pregnancy testing should be performed at times specified in the SoA 
(Section 1.3 ). 
Pregnancy testing should be performed when ever a menstrual cycle is missed or when 
pregnancy is otherwise suspected.  
Collection of Pregnancy Information  
Male patients with partners who become pregnant 
The Investigator will attempt to collect pregnancy information on any male patient’s 
female partner who becomes pregnant while the male patient is in the study. This applies 
only to male patients who receive ensifentrine. 
After obtaining the necessary signed informed consent from the pregnant female partner 
directly, the Investigator will record pregnancy information on the appropriate form and 
submit it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of the partner’s pregnancy. The female partner will also be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
Information on the status of the mother and child will be forwarded to the Sponsor. 
Generally, the follow-up will be no longer than 6 to 8 weeks following the estimated 
delivery date. Any termination of the pregnancy will be reported regardless of fetal status 
(presence or absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure. 
Female Patients who become pregnant 
x The Investigator will collect pregnancy information on any female patient who 
becomes pregnant while participating in this study. Information will be recorded on 
the appropriate form and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours of learning of a patient’s pregnancy. 
x The patient will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
Investigator will collect follow-up information on the patient and the neonate and the information will be forwarded to the Sponsor. Generally, follow-up will not be 
required for longer than 6 to 8 weeks beyond the estimated delivery date. Any termination of pregnancy will be reported, regardless of fetal status (presence or 
absence of anomalies) or indication for the procedure.  
x While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy will be reported as an AE or SAE. A spontaneous abortion is always considered to be an SAE and will be reported 
as such.  
Protocol RPL554-CO-302 Version 5.0; 30 Apr 2021 
Verona Pharma plc CONFIDENTIAL Page 128 of 136 xAny post-study pregnancy related SAE considered reasonably related to the blinded
study medication by the Investigator will be reported to the Sponsor as described in
Section 8.7.5 . While the Investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information
in former patients, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous reporting.
xAny female patient who becomes pregnant while participating in the study willdiscontinue blinded study medication and be withdrawn from the study.

Phase III-IV liver chemistry stopping and follow-up criteria have been designed to assure 
patient safety and evaluate liver event etiology (in alignment with the FDA premarketing 
clinical liver safety guidance). Phase III-IV liver chemistry stopping criteria 1-5 are 
defined below. Investigators may at their discretion refer patients meeting liver safety 
criteria below to a specialist who may determine the appropriate or medically necessary 
additional or confirmatory laboratory tests or procedures as required by the protocol or 
otherwise deemed necessary (e.g. liver imaging). 
1. ALT  3xULN and bilirubin  2xULN (35% direct bilirubin) (or ALT  3xULN 
and INR > 1.5, if INR measured. 
Note: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately available, withdraw study drug for that patient if ALT  3xULN and bilirubin  2xULN. Serum bilirubin 
fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick, indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury. 
2. ALT  8xULN. 
3. ALT  5xULN but < < 8 xULN persists for  2 weeks. 
4. ALT  3xULN if associated with symptoms (new or worsening) believed to be 
related to hepatitis (such as fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or 
tenderness, or jaundice) or hypersensitivity (such as fever, rash or eosinophilia). 
5. ALT  5xULN but < 8 xULN and cannot be monitored weekly for  2 weeks. 
When any of the liver stopping criteria 1-5 is met do the following: 
x Immediately  discontinue blinded study medication/investigational product for 
that patient. 
x Report the event to IQVIA within 24 hours of learning its occurrence. 
x Complete the liver event CRF and SAE data collection tool if the event also meets 
the criteria for an SAE. All events of ALT  3xULN and bilirubin  2xULN (35% 
direct bilirubin) (or ALT  3xULN and INR > 1.5, if INR measured); INR 
measurement is not required and the threshold value stated will not apply to 
patients receiving anticoagulants), termed ‘Hy’s Law’ must be reported as an SAE (excluding studies of hepatic impairment or cirrhosis). 
Note: if serum bilirubin fractionation is not immediately available, discontinue blinded 
study medication/investigational product for that patient if ALT  3xULN and biliru bin  
2xULN. Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick, indicating direct bilirubin elevations and suggesting liver injury.

xPerform liver event follow-up assessments and monitor the patient until liver
chemistries resolve, stabilize, or return to baseline values as described below.
xDiscontinue blinded study medication/investigational product after completion ofthe liver chemistry monitoring as described below.
xDo not restart investigational product.
In addition, for criterion 1: 
xMake every reasonable attempt to have patients return to clinic within 24 hoursfor repeat liver chemistries, liver event follow-up assessments (see below), andclose monitoring.
xA specialist or hepatology consultation is recommended.
xMonitor patients twice weekly until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkalinephosphatase, bilirubin) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values.
For criteria 2, 3, 4, and 5:  
xMake every reasonable attempt to have patients return to clinic within 24-72 hoursfor repeat liver chemistries and liver event follow-up assessments (see below).
xMonitor patients weekly until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase,bilirubin) resolve, stabilize, or return to within baseline values; criterion 5 patients
should be monitored as frequently as possible.
Patients with ALT   5xULN and < 8xULN which exhibit a decrease to ALT 3xULN, 
but <5xULN and bilirubin <2xULN without hepatitis symptoms or rash, and who can be 
monitored for 4 weeks: 
xNotify the IQVIA Medical Monitor within 24 hours or learning of the abnormalityto discuss patient safety.
xCan continue investigational product
xMust return weekly for repeat liver chemistries (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase,bilirubin) until they resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline.
xIf at any time these patients meet the liver chemistry stopping criteria, proceed asdescribed above.
xIf, after 4 weeks of monitoring, ALT <3xULN and bilirubin <2xULN, monitorpatients twice monthly until live chemistries normalize or return to within baseline

Definitions of a Medical Device Incident 
The detection and documentation procedures described in this protocol apply to all 
Sponsor medical devices provided for use in the study (see Section 6.2.2 ) for the list of 
Sponsor medical devices).  
Medical Device Incident Definition 
xA medical device incident is any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics
and/or performance of a device as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the
instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led
to the death of a patient/user/other person or to a serious deterioration in his/her
state of health.
xNot all incidents lead to death or serious deterioration in health. The
nonoccurrence of such a result might have been due to other fortunate
circumstances or to the intervention of health care personnel.
It is sufficient that: 
xAn incident associated with a device happened.
AND
xThe incident was such that, if it occurred again, might lead to death or a serious
deterioration in health.
A serious deterioration in state of health can include any of the following: 
xLife-threatening illness.
xPermanent impairment of body function or permanent damage to body structure.
xCondition necessitating medical or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the above.
xFetal distress, fetal death, or any congenital abnormality or birth defects.
Examples of Incidents 
xA patient, user, caregiver, or healthcare professional is injured as a result of a
medical device failure or its misuse.
xA patient’s blinded study medication is interrupted or compromised by a medical
device failure.
xA misdiagnosis due to medical device failure leads to inappropriate treatment.
xA patient’s health deteriorates due to medical device failure.

Medical Device Incident Documenting 
xAny medical device incident occurring during the study will be documented in the
patient’s medical records, in accordance with the Investigator’s normal clinicalpractice, and on the appropriate form of the CRF.
xFor incidents fulfilling the definition of an AE or an SAE, the appropriate
AE/SAE CRF page will be completed as described in  Section 11.7.
xThe CRF will be completed as thoroughly as possible and signed by theInvestigator before transmittal to the Sponsor or designee.
xIt is very important that the Investigator provides his/her assessment of causality
(relationship to the medical device provided by the Sponsor) at the time of the
initial AE or SAE report and describes any corrective or remedial actions taken to
prevent recurrence of the incident.
xA remedial action is any action other than routine maintenance or servicing of amedical device where such action is necessary to prevent recurrence of an
incident. This includes any amendment to the device design to prevent recurrence.

There is a small degree of discomfort associated with wearing the Oxalert device, and 
we ask patients to bring the device back to the Clinic or mail it back to us in pre -paid 
envelopes. As an incenti ve to wear the Oxalert, we propose to pay patients $3/hour of 
use, up to $500 which will fully cover the pre -hospital and post -hospital days, along with 
up to five days of hospitalization.

Specific Aims  
We propose a pilot randomized trial of the Oxalert EPO (Enhanced Pulse 
Oximeter) in surgical patients who are at high risk of opioid -induced respiratory 
compromise. Primarily, we will determine the feasibility of  a full randomized control trial 
to assess the extent to which the Oxalert EPO reduces postoperative hypoxemia. The 
anticipated primary hypothesis for the full future trial is that Oxalert EPO alerts will reduce 
the time -weighted average of SpO 2 below a th reshold of 90%.  
Aim 1  
 We will evaluate the feasibility of a fully randomized validation trial for the Oxalert 
EPO. All patients will wear the Oxalert for 24 hours preoperatively in the monitoring only 
mode (no alerts), throughout hospitalization up to six  days, and for 24 post -discharge 
hours. Randomization will be to Oxalert in monitor -only mode or to its normal mode which 
provides progressive audible and tactile alerts for hypoxemia. Randomized assignment 
will start after surgery and continue through up to six days of hospitalization and 
after discharge.   
Feasibility will be defined by:  1) a single -center enrollment rate of at least two 
patients per week at the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus; 2) the extent to which the system 
is tolerated, defined as the f raction of time during the initial six post -operative in -hospital 
days that patients wear the device; and, 3) the frequency of hypoxemic episodes detected 
by the Oxalert EPO that generate an alert in the hospital.    
Aim 2   
We will evaluate  efficacy  outcomes  that might be  included in a future definitive trial. 
While under -powered in this pilot, the results will guide a realistic sample -size estimate 
for the future trial.

Version 24, 3/18/21  
  5 Background  
There are over 70 million surgeries performed annually in USA. Postoperative pain 
is a ubiquitous problem among the US population. Up to 70% of surgery patients have 
moderate to severe pain, especially within the first 72 hours1,2.  Opioid analgesics are the 
most effective analgesics, especially for management of the moderate to severe 
postopera tive pain. On the other hand, sleep apnea is common, largely because obesity 
is common3. Both increase sensitivity to opioids and presumably increase the risk of 
postoperative insufficiency5.  
Some opioid -induced complications are common, but not especially serious, 
including nausea, vomiting, ileus, confusion, and dizziness6. Of importance, opioids also 
decrease the respiratory rate and alveolar ventilation, resulting in hypercarbia, respiratory 
acidosis, and hypoxemia6. Hypoxemia (low hemoglobin saturation) from opioid -induced 
respiratory depression is usually not clinically apparent, compromise wound healing, 
cause brain dysfunction, promote myocardial ischemia, and even progress to death7-9. All 
these outcomes are considered important measures of hospital quality and safety10,11.   
Postoperative respiratory compromise is common as well as respiratory arrests12. 
Standard post -operative monitoring is based on a “spot -check” model, in which vita l signs, 
including oxygen saturation, are determined and recorded every 4 -6 h13,14.  From Sun et 
al 15, we know that 37% of postoperative patients have cont iguous SpO 2 <90% lasting at 
least an hour. 21% of the patients experienced ≥ 10 min /h with SpO 2 <90%. Disturbingly , 
nurses monitor at 4 -hour intervals missed 90% of all serious desaturation episodes15. 
Even if increasing the frequency of nursing assessments were practical, it would be 
unlikely to detect all respiratory insufficiency events.  
According to Stone16, the incidence of nocturnal hypoxemia is 50% with patient -
controlled anal gesia. Since patients undergoing surgical procedures are being 
discharged earlier and earlier17, it is likely that many continue to experience hypoxemic 
episodes at home, especially during sleep.    
Version 24, 3/18/21  
  6 FDA-cleared continuous saturation monitoring systems for in -hospital use are 
currently  commercially available18-20. They are battery powered, untethered, and can 
directly be connected to electronic record systems. However, monitoring alone may not 
prevent ventilator complications if clinicians do not recognize desaturation quickly and 
intervene appropriately. An alternative is a device that both detects hypoxemia, a nd alerts 
patients to the problem. Arousal is often sufficient to awaken patients’ robust voluntary 
control of breathing, reverse hypoxemia and respiratory arrest. Consistent with this 
theory, it is fairly easy to give patients sufficient opioid to decreas e or stop normal 
ventilation, but preserve voluntary breathing in response to command. Even when audible 
commands fail, patients will often breathe in response to tactile stimulation.  
One such device is the Apnea Prevention Device (APD)21, which is a prototype 
that has a continuous mon itor, alarm headphone, and tactile nerve stimulation. However, 
the system tethers patients and is thus impractical even in hospitals, much less at home. 
An alternative is the Oxalert EPO which is a small (92 X 53 X  21 mm), battery -powered, 
and wrist -worn a pnea prevention device. The system continuously monitors SpO 2 and 
generates audible voice prompts when the saturation is <90% for at 2 min . The audible 
prompts will then continue until saturation increases to ≥90% . When saturation remains 
low for an additi onal 1 min , a mild electrical shock will provide tactile stimulation, with 
intensity increasing four times every 20 seconds to an intense, but safe maximum.  
Compared to existing proven alternatives, the “point -of-care” Oxalert EPO 
provides a more tolerable , effective, promptly diagnosis of opioid -induced hypoxemia . 
Then the Oxalert EPO automatically evokes arousals to terminate respiratory depression 
and prevent  arrest from relatively opioid overdose. It might make opioids safer both in 
hospital and home se tting.  
Methods  
The trial will be conducted with IRB approval and a written informed consent will 
be obtained from adults scheduled for non -cardiac surgery with general anesthesia.  All 
Version 24, 3/18/21  
  7 patients will be enrolled at the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus. The tria l will be registered 
at ClinicalTrials.gov before the first patient is enrolled.   
Subject selection  
We will enrich the study population to enhance the number of desaturation events 
by enrolling patients who are at increased risk for respiratory insufficie ncy. Specifically, 
we will focus on patients scheduled for laparoscopic or open major abdominal or pelvic 
surgery whose analgesia is primarily opioid -based. We will further restrict enrollment to 
obese patients (body mass index ≥25  kg/m2) who are likely to  have respiratory 
compromise. Sample size for the proposed pilot trial will be 40 valid patients.  We will also 
enroll up to 25 pre -pilot patients which will allow us to better understand and “de -bug” the 
system and therefore maximize effective data acquis ition for the trial itself.  Both men and 
women will be recruited, and we will encourage under -represented minorities to 
participate.  
Inclusion criteria  
1) Adults having major laparoscopic and open abdominal or pelvic surgeries;  
2) Body Mass Index ≥25 kg/m2 
3) American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 -3; 
4) Age 18 -85 years old;  
5) Able to understand and consent to the trial and fully participate;  
6) Anticipated primary opioid analgesia after surgery;  
7) Expected duration of hospitalization at least 24 hours after  surgery;  
8) Consenting at least a day before anticipated surgery.  
Exclusion criteria  
1) Epidural analgesia (field and fascial plane blocks permitted);  
2) Pre-operative SpO 2 <95%;  
3) No wrist available for the study;  
4) Severe hearing loss;  
5) Lack of English language fluency ; 
Version 24, 3/18/21  
  8 6) Serious hearing deficit (unable to understand normal speech in a quite 
environment);  
7) Serious peripheral neuropathy (unable to feel pin prick at wrist) . 
Protocol  
At least a day before surgery, patients will be approached an d consented in the 
pre-anesthetic consult and evaluation (PACE) clinic. Vital signs will be measured, per 
routine, including SpO 2. The protocol will be explained, and interested patients will be 
given a brief demonstration of the Oxalert, including audible  prompt s and the sensation 
produced by the electrical stimulator.  
Participating patients will be given an Oxalert to take home with them. The device 
will be set to a record -only mode, with no alerts will be generated. Patients will be asked 
to wear the de vice for at least 24 hours. The device will thereafter be  turned off in time, 
brought to the hospital on the day of surgery or sent back to the investigators in a pre -
paid mailer. Only those who wish to continue will remain in the study.   
Enrolled patient s will receive routine nursing care, standard physiologic 
monitoring, and analgesic administration. Supplemental oxygen will be administered 
according to nurse discretion.  Participation in the study will not alter the types or amounts 
of analgesics provid ed which will follow clinical routine. The PACU and ward nurses 
caring for study patients will be introduced to the protocol and the device. Vital sign and 
other monitoring will be exactly per clinical routine, usually at 4 -hour intervals, but more 
often a s clinically indicated.  
On the day of surgery, enrolled patients will be randomized 1:1 without 
stratification. Randomization will be based on computer -generated codes using random -
sized blocks. Investigators will receive individual assignments from a web -based system 
that will be interrogated in the recovery unit after surgery. Allocation will thus be concealed 
until the last practical moment. Randomization will be to monitor -only (no alerts) or Oxalert 
in normal mode which includes progressive audible an d tactile stimulation in response to 
saturation <90%  lasting more than 2 min .  
Version 24, 3/18/21  
  9 An Oxalert EPO will be strapped to each patient’s wrist, and standard 
electrocardiogram surface electrodes will be placed on the dorsum of the hand and 
connected to the nerve st imulator. The Oxalert devices will be programmed per 
randomization (monitoring and alerts versus  monitoring  without alerts ) and data collection 
will be set to “on.” Data collection will continue throughout hospitalization, up to 6 
postoperative days. As ne cessary, de -identified data will be down -loaded onto a secure 
Cleveland Clinic computer and transferred to Redcap. The memory card of the Oxalert 
EPO will then be refreshed.  
Patients will be monitored for an additional ≈24 hours after discharge. Monitoring  
after discharge will be done according to the assigned group for each patient. The study 
will be blinded to the extent practical. Devices with active and deactivated alerts will look 
identical. Patients who receive alerts will know that they have active s ystems, but those 
who have yet to receive an alert will not know if their system is deactivated or if an alert 
simply was not necessary.  
The high saturation alarm will be disabled. Alarms for heart rate will be set to the 
minimum (≈30 beats/min) and maxim um (≈120 beats/min) since heart rate is not an 
outcome of interest . For purposes of the proposed trial, the threshold will be a saturation 
<90% continuously maintained for 2 min . When these criteria are met, the Oxalert EPO 
will trigger contin uous audible prompts  (“Please take a breath and check the finger 
sensor”)  will be gin. Tactile stimulation will begin 1 min later at a low level, and ramp up 4 
times at 20 -second intervals, to a safe but uncomfortable maximum intensity. The brief 
290-micro -second pulses are delivered 2/second (120 Hz) through electrode pads on the 
dorsu m of the wrist . Both audible prompts and stimuli of up to 35 milli -amperes will 
continue until SpO 2 rises above 90% whereupon the device will reset and audible and 
tactile prompts cease. Patients can discontinue alerts by pressing a button at any  time.  
Measurements  
Demographic and morphometric characteristics will be recorded at PACE clinic, 
including sex, age, race, height and weight. Vital signs will be recorded, including baseline 
of SpO 2.  
Version 24, 3/18/21  10 Oxalert  EPO  co mfort  and tolerability  will be evaluated  by phone  shortly  after 
patients  complete  their home  monitoring.  Patients  will also be reminded  to turn off the 
machine, bring or send the machine back. 
Anesthe tic and procedu ral detail s will be recorded electronicall y as usual. 
Intraoperative and postoperative opioid use will be calculated in equivalen t amount.    
Monitoring  with Oxalert  EPO  will begin  in the postanesthesia  care unit and 
continue  until the patient  is discharged  from the hospital  (from  surgery  day until up to 
postoperative  day 6). During  hospital  stay,  the equipment  status  checking  and data 
download will be completed once a day. The Oxalert EPO will be continued to be used 
for 24 hours  after discharge  according  to the subject’s  assigned  group  after randomization. 
Therefore, the configuration of either active alerts or blinded monitoring without alerts will 
be performed throughout hospital stay as well as discharge. 
 Patients’ evaluation of device comfort and tolerability will be queried at discharge 
day. During hospitalization, one nursing staff responsible for the enrolled subject will be 
given  inform  sheet,  voluntary  to participate  in an anonymous  questionnaire  to evaluate 
the convenience of the device near the end of a nursing shift. 
Patients  will be called  on the second  discharged  day to ask about  24-h opioid 
consumption and evaluate adverse events. Patients will also be reminded to send back 
the Oxalert  EPO  using  a prepaid mail.   De-identified  data from the Oxalert  EPO  will be 
downloaded to a trial computer, and from there to a secure RE DCap trial database.  
Data Analysis 
SpO 2 trends will be recorded and averaged in 1-minute increments for analysis. 
SpO 2 values <60% will be discarded as artifact (only 0.09% of all values). 
The demographic and morphometric characteristics of patients in the blinded and 
un-blinded groups will be tabulated and absolute standardized differences will be 
computed. POD1-POD6 or discharge, whichever first. Summarize after removing gaps.  
The frequency and duration of desaturation events (SpO 2< 90%) will be compared using 
Version 24, 3/18/21  11 two-tailed t-tests if normally distributed, or Wilcoxon tests if not, with P<0.05 
being considered statistically significant. Patient’s tolerance and nursing experience 
will be compared qualitatively. 
Version 24, 3/18/21  12 Detailed Statistical Analysis Plan (outline. 
The demographic and morphometric characteristics o f patien ts will be tabulated and 
absolute standardized differences will be computed. 
We will also report the number of patients in each group who dropped out of the trial, 
and the reason (s).    [technical failure / one patient dropped out after 5 minutes.  
Remove this one from all analyses, but report as a technical failure.]

Version 24, 3/18/21  13 Secondary outcomes  
3.Patient evaluation of device comfort/tolerability, including discomfort from the
alerts.
     --- summary stats and WRS test.     5 levels. 
4.Nursing evaluation of device convenience and function  – WRS test.
    --  summary stats .     5 levels.  
Feasibil ity will be defined by:  
1)a single -center enrollment rate of at least two patients per week at the Cleveland
Clinic Main Campus;
-Summarize enrollment: total N enrolled over what time period, and average N/week.
2) the extent to which the system is tolerated , defined as the fraction of time during the
initial six post -operative in-hospital days  that patients wear the device ; and,
3)Percent of time successful records were made , defined as the percent of time in
each period that usable SpO2 monitoring data was retrieved and usable – independent
of whether the device was being worn or not.
Record separately for the three periods:   the pre-hospital 24 hours;  the initial six po st-
surgical hospital days; and the po st-discharge 24 hours.   
     -- summarize time that patient should have been able to records data,  time of 
   successful recording  and percent of total time there were successful recordings . 
     -- compare groups on percent of total time there were successful recordings using 
  WRS test.  
4) Estimate  t he frequency of hypoxemic episodes detected by the Oxalert EPO that
generate an alert in the hospital.  Since device does not record if alerts were given, we
use the collected SpO2 data to summarize for each group the frequency of desaturation
events lasting 1, 2, 3, 4 …. ≥10 minutes numerically and using histograms. 
Human Subjects Protection 
The study will be approved by the IRB at the Cleveland Clinic. Written informed 
consent will be obtained. Patients will be free to exit the trial at any time. They will also 
Version 24, 3/18/21  14 be given the option to have the frequency of awakenings decreased, if poorly tolerated, 
by lowering the SpO 2 thresholds used to trigger those awa kenings. The trial will be 
registered at ClinicalTrials.gov.  
All routine nursing assessments and clinical treatments (including supplemental 
oxygen if necessary) will continue as usual. Therefore, nothing about the proposed study 
will in any way increase p atient risk except for the Ox alert itself which is powered by a 
rechargable 3.7-volt battery. Patients will thus be untethered and free to move around. 
The device consists of essential ly a commercial pulse oximeter connected to a circuit 
resembling a nerve  stimulator of the type that is used routinely during anesthesia. Please 
see the Electrical Engineering Analysis provided with this application.  
The Ox alert EPO is not yet cleared  by the Food and Drug Administration; we 
therefore request a non -significant -risk (NSR) device exemption. A Data Development 
Plan has been submitted to and discussed with the FDA/CDRH Anesthesia Division.  In 
support of the NSR exemption , the Anesthesia Division  of the FDA  has agree d to consider 
a De Novo or PMA submission without the results of a full clinical  outcome t rial being 
completed before pre -marketing approval because of its great potential benefit to 
patients.  At this point they are not requiring an Investigational Device Exception (IDE). 
The proposed pilot trial is designed to provide information that will help the investigators, 
and the FDA optimally design a trial that might support FDA clearance . We provide three 
documents related to electrical safety, including two ind ependent engineering analyses.  
At the Cleveland Clinic Main Campus, 21% of patients have postoperative  
saturation s below 90% for at least  10 minutes ; 8% of patients have postoperative 
saturation below 90% for at least 20 minutes;  and 8% of patients have saturation s below 
85% for more than 5 minutes. Post -operative desaturation is thus common and 
prolonged . Routine vital signs, usually at  4-hour intervals miss 90% of serious 
desaturation episodes.15 The only aspect of our protocol that is non -standard is an extra 
saturation m onitoring with Oxalert EPO, and the associated audible and tactile stimuli. 
Standard vital signs monitoring will continue to be used per current routine care.  
Version 24, 3/18/21  15 Participation in the proposed trial is thus likely to benefit patients, at least in the alert 
group, whereas those assigned to monitoring only will be no worse off.   
There is a small degree of discomfort associated with wearing the Oxalert device, 
and we ask patients to bring the device back to the Clinic or mail it back to us in pre -paid 
envelopes. As an incentive to wear the Oxalert, we propose to pay patients $3/hour of 
use, up to $500 which will fully cover the pre -hospital and post -hospital days, along with 
up to five days of hospitalization.

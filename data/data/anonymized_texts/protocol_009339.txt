Principal Investigator (s): Javier Bolaños Meade, MD and Bronwen Shaw, MD, PhD  
 
Study Design:   This  is a multi -center, single arm Phase II study of hematopoietic cell 
transplantation  (HCT) using human leukocyte antigen ( HLA )-mismatched unrelated bone 
marrow transplantation donors  and post -transplantation cyclophosphamide  (PTCy), sirolimus 
and mycophenolate mof etil (MMF) for graft versus host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis  in patients 
with:  
1. Acute lymphoblastic leukemia  (ALL) /T lymphoblastic lymphoma  (T-LBL) , acute 
myelogenous leukemia  (AML) , acute b iphenotypic  leukemia (ABL), or acute 
undifferentiated leukemia  (AUL)  in 1st or subsequent complete remission ( CR) 
2. Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) , fulfilling the following criteria:  
a. Subject s with de novo MDS who have or have previously had Intermediate -2 or 
High risk disease  as determined by the International Prognostic Scoring System 
(IPSS ). Current Intermediate -2 or High risk disease is not a requirement . 
b. Subjec ts must have < 20% bone marrow blasts , assessed  within 60 days of 
informed consent . 
c. Subjec ts may have received prior therapy for the treatment of MDS prior to 
enrollment . 
3. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in complete re sponse  (CR)  (if reduced intensity 
conditioning  [RIC] is to be used) , or complete or partial re sponse  (PR)  (if full intensity 
conditioning  [FIC] is to be used) . 
4. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in 1 st or subsequent chronic phase characterized by 
<10% blasts in the blood or bone marrow . 
5. Chemotherapy -sensitive lymphoma  in status other than 1st CR. 
 
Primary Objective:   The primary objective is to determine overall survival (OS) 1-year after 
HLA -mismatched unrelated donor (MMUD ) bone marrow transplantation  using PTCy, sirolimus 
and MMF  to prevent GVHD.  
 
Secondary Objectives:  Subjec ts enrolled in this study will also be followed for the following 
endpoints: progression -free survival  (PFS)  at Da y+180 and 1-year post-HCT , cumulative 
incidence of neutrophil recovery , cumulative incidence of platelet recovery, cumulative 
incidence of primary graft failure, donor chimerism, cumulative incidences of acute GVHD  
(aGVHD)  and chronic GVHD  (cGVHD) , cumulative incidence s of viral reactivations  and 
infections , transplant -related mortality  (TRM)  at Day+100, Day+180, and 1-year post-HCT , 
cumulative incidence of relapse/progression, cumulative incidence s of thrombotic 
microangiopathy (TMA) and hepatic veno -occlusive disease (VOD )/ sinusoidal obstruction

NMDP IRB Approv ed 1 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
1.1  Background  
Allogeneic HCT  is a potentially curative therapy for a variety of hematologic diseases, including 
the acute and chronic leukemias, myelodysplasia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma .  Clinical 
data now confirm that T -cells contained within the donor graft are capable of exerting a “graft -
versus -malignancy” effect  (Horowitz et al.,  1990) .  However , successful application of 
allogeneic HCT  to patients with hematologic diseases is limited by the toxicity related to the 
allogeneic donor cells which result in GVHD, a life threatening complication. Development of 
GVHD is associated with lower OS and thus the prevention of GVHD is a cornerstone of 
allogeneic HCT  therapy  (Choi & Reddy, 2014) .  
 
Transplantation using cells from HLA -identical sibling donors results in the lowest incidence of 
GVHD, and such donors are prioritized; however, only approximately 30% of patients have an 
HLA -identical sibling donor. Alternative sources of stem cells for t hose without an HLA -
identical sibling include unrelated donors, umbilical cord blood and HLA -mismatched 
(haploidentical) related donors  (Kekre & Antin, 2014) . When using these donor sources, more 
intensive strategies are required to reduce the incidence of  rejection and/or GVHD resulting from 
greater differences in both major and minor histocompatibility antigens.  
 
Several methods may overcome the drawbacks associated with HLA -mismatched 
transplantation. In vivo T -cell depletion using alemtuzumab or anti -thymocyte globulin (ATG) is 
well recognized to reduce the incidence of both acute and chronic GVHD and graft rejection but 
is associated with delayed immune reconstitution and subsequent problems with infection, 
particular ly reactivation of viruses  (Potter et al. , 2014; Chakraverty et al., 2010; Walker  et al. , 
2016; Bacigalupo  et al. , 2006) .  
 
Several studies indicate that administering high dose, PTCy decreases the incidence of acute and 
chronic GVHD after HLA -mismatched transplantation without an adverse effect on immune 
reconstitution.  The immunobiologic rationale for administering Cy after HCT  is that recently 
activated, alloreactive T -cells (the cells most responsible for GVHD) are selectively sensitive to 
the toxic effects of this drug  (Mayumi, Umesue, & Nomoto, 1996) .  
 
This strategy was initially tested in HCT  using cells from partially HLA -mismatched (HLA -
haploidentical) relative s in two independent single center clinical trials with favorable results  
(Luznik et al., 2008) . Eighty -eight consecutive patients of all ages with high -risk hematologic 
malignancies were accrued to these trials between 1999 and 2006. Transplantation conditioning 
consisted of Cy 14.5 mg/kg/day IV on Days –6 and –5, fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day IV on Days –6 
to –2, and 200 cGy of TBI on Day –1.  On Da y 0, patients received donor bone marrow, which 
was obtained in a targeted collection of 4 x 108 nucleated cells/kg recipient weight and depleted 
of red blood cells by processing on a Gambro Spectra apheresis instrument. On Day +3, 50 mg/kg 
Cy was administered. A subset of patients received an additional dose of Cy on Day +4.  
Pharmacologic prophylaxis of GVHD was initiated on the day following completion of PTCy.  
All patients received tacrolimus and MMF.  Patients received filgrastim 5 mcg/kg daily starting 
at Day+5 and continuing until recovery of neutrophils to >1000/ L for three days. The outcomes 
of these studies showed: graft failure in 18% (73% of whom had measurable disease); complete 
donor chimerism (>95%) in patients with sustained engraftment by 2 months after HCT ; 
RCI BMT Protocol #15 -MMUD

NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed cumulative incidences of grades II -IV and III -IV aGVHD by Day +200 of 35% and 10%, 
respectively; cumulative incidences of overall and extensive cGVHD in the first year after HCT  
of 22% and 14%, respectively. The cumulative incidences of non -relapse mortality (NRM) at 
180 days and 1-year after HCT  were 13% and 19%, respectively.  The cumulative incidences of 
relapse at 1 and 2 years after HCT  were 50% and 57%, respectively.  At a median follow -up of 
survivors of 817 days (range, 112 -1808 days), the actuarial OS of the entire group at 1 and 2 
years were 45% and 35%, respectively.   
 
Based on these encouraging results, the BMT CTN initiated a Phase II study to test this approach 
in a multi -center setting ( Brunstein, et al., 2011 ). Fifty patients (<70 years) with high -risk 
leukemia or lymphoma were included. Only one patient had primary graft failure and all 
engrafting patients had 100% donor chimerism at Day+56. The 100 -day cumulative incidence of 
grade II -IV aGVHD was 32%.The 1 -year cumulative incidences of NRM and relapse were 7% 
and 45%, respectively, with 1 -year probabilities of OS and PFS of 62% and 48%, respectively.  
 
Some disease states continue to have a higher non -engraftment rate in this setting. U npublished 
data from Johns Hopkins University reveals that in the haploidentical non-myeloablative setting, 
patients with active CLL have a 7 -fold increase risk of graft -failure. Other groups have found 
higher rates of graft failure in patients with CLL in the non -myeloablative setting (Delgado et al., 
2006) . 
 
These studies, and others, show that use of PTCy with additional post -HCT  immune suppression 
allows successful outcomes using very mismatched donors. Clinical practice has now evolved to 
include PTCy as standard of care GVHD prophylaxis for patients receiving cells from 
haploidentical donors  (Bashey & Solomon, 2014) . However, there are several drawbacks to use 
of haploidentical related donors. Related donors often fall outside the norms used for accepting 
unrelated donors (i.e. >60 or <18 , or presence of co morbidities ) with several important 
consequences for both the patient and the donor.  
 
The use of older donors is associated with worse clinical out comes for recipients.  Kollman et al . 
(2001)  showed, in a retrospective analysis of 6978 unrelated bone marrow transplants,  that 
patients receiving cells from an unrelated donor under the age of 30 had significantly better 
survival than those with older donors  ( p = 0.0002 ). Younger donors were associated with a 
significantly lower risk of severe aGVHD among HLA -mismatched pairs. Incidences at 
Day+100 were 30%, 41%, and 40%, respectively, with donors aged 18 to 30 years, 31 to 45 
years, and more than 45 years ( p < 0.0001). A significantly lower risk of cGVHD was also found 
with younger donors (p  = 0.02).  These data were confirmed in a later study (Kollman et al., 
2015) including 6349 unrelated donor transplant recipients, which again showed that using 
donors under the age of 32  conferred a significant survival advantage (p  <0.001). As in the 
previous study, the incidence of GVHD was lower with a younger donor. This publication 
included a recent validation subset of 4690 HLA -matched (8/8 HLA -A, -B, -C, and –DRB1 loci) 
donor -recipient pairs which showed a linear impact of donor age on patient survival, with 
younger donor ages associated with higher survival (p  = .006). Importantly, all three of these 
studies showed that the effect of donor age was present irrespective of the degree  of HLA 
matching between the pair, suggesting that it is an ind ependent  risk factor for survival and 
GVHD.

NMDP IRB Approv ed  
Finally, a  European Blood and Marrow Transplant group study (Kroger et al., 2012) of 719 MDS 
patients over the age of 50 years showed that patients transplanted from a younger unrelated 
donor (<30 years) had significantly higher 5 -year OS in comparison with those transplanted from 
a related donor or an older unrelated donor (>30 years): 40 % vs 33 % vs 24 % (p = 0.04).  Other 
data do not confirm this finding of better outcomes with an unrelated compared to a related 
donor (Alousi  et al. , 2013).  
 
Additionally, other non -HLA donor selection factors (such as ABO status, sex and parity), which 
are variably associated with differences in HCT outcomes, can often not be prioritized in the 
related donor setting  (Kollman et al., 2015) . Although there is controversy about the impact of 
ABO matching on HCT outcome, large recent CIBMTR studies suggest a surviv al advantage 
with ABO matching (Pidala, et al., 2014).  Although the impact of ABO matching  has not been 
studied in the haploidentical setting, it is an i mportant logistical issue when transplanting bone 
marrow, as mismatching requires red cell depleting procedures, which may result in a loss of 
stem cells, potentially increasing the risk of poor engraftment. The ability to sel ect amongst 
donors to avoid ABO  mismatching is an attractive option, seldom available when choosing 
among related donors. Use of female donors is also associated with reduced engraftment and 
parous donors are associated with increased cGVHD  (Shaw  et al. , 2005; Kollman  et al. , 2001) . In 
the haploidentical PTCy setting, transplanting female donor bone marrow into a male recipient is 
associated with an increase in the probability of graft failure  (Kongtim, Cao, & Ciurea,  2016) . 
 
There are also potential ethical and logistic considerations when using related donors. While any 
potential coercion and conflicts of interest are removed in the unrelated donor setting due to 
anonymity between patients and donor and the separation of pati ent and donor care, this is not 
always the case in the related donor setting. Additionally, older donors are much more likely to 
have co -existent health issues, which may increase the risks of adverse events  (AEs)  post 
donation or require peripheral blood rather than bone marrow harvest  (Anthias, et al., 2015a) , 
though most of the experience with PTCy is with HCT using bone marrow grafts . Recently, 
concerns have been raised about the psychologic impact of donation in pediatric donors  (Bitan et 
al., 2015) . Conflicts of interest may arise where the donor and recipient are both managed by the 
same team. Although health assessment and consent are not separated in many centers, this is 
almost always  not the case with the bone marrow harvest, since  only transplant  teams are trained 
in this intervention  (Anthias et al., 2015b) . There is evidence that donor AEs are increased in 
centers where harvest numbers are low (Shaw et al., 2015) which may be an issue in centers 
performing only infrequent bone marrow harvest on related donors. In this protocol utilizing 
unrelated donors, bone marrow collection will be centralized using facilities performing large 
numbers of procedures for the NMDP. Operators are likely to have appropriate levels of 
expertise thus minimizing  donor AEs. 
 
A perceived restriction in the use of unrelated donors is the time necessary to find a donor, a 
delay which is thought to be associated with inferior patient outcomes. The ability to select a 
MMUD would remove this barrier by greatly increasing the appropr iate donor pool for each 
patient, thereby increasing the likelihood of finding a donor available to donate in a timely 
manner . The ability to select a MMUD would also benefit patients from ethnic minorities who 
are also more likely to find a mismatched tha n a matched unrelated donor on international donor

NMDP IRB Approv ed registries.  With currently over 20 million unrelated donors listed on the international donor 
registries, multiple mismatched dono rs are expected to be available  for each patient ; thus, donor 
selection can be optimized and expedited.  
 
A recent single center feasibility study at Johns Hopkins University is evaluating the use of 
MMUD  bone marrow transplantation using PTCy, sirolimus and MMF to prevent GVHD 
(Kasamon  et al. , 2015) . The conditioning regimen used is non -myeloablative and includes 
fludarabine, Cy and low dose TBI with two doses of PTCy (Day+4 and +5). Sirolimus and MMF 
are started on Day+5. The primary objectives include estimating that 6 month probability of 
survival without grade III -IV GVHD or graft failure. The disease and age inclusion criteria are 
broad. Patients are eligible if they lack a first degree related donor or haploidentica l donor. 
Potential donors in this protocol could be unrelated donors, first cousins and second -degre e 
relatives. HLA matching at 6 HLA loci is considered. Patients with donor specific antibodies are 
excluded.  
 
Thus far 16 patients have been enrolled onto the protocol with a MMUD. Most (N=9 ) received 
the HCT  for AML . The unrelated grafts had a median of 2 HLA mismatches and included three 
7/10 matches, one 6/10 match, and one 5/10 match. HLA -C mismatch was present in 10 grafts 
(63%) and complete -DP mismatch in 6 (38%).  By revised Disease Risk Index, 25% of p atien ts 
were high risk, 69% intermediate risk, and 6% low risk; 69% were in CR at time of transplant . 
The median graft doses were 3.36 x 108 total nucleated cells/kg and 3.87 x 107 CD3+ cells/kg. 
All p atien ts engrafted, and there were no non -relapse deaths or prohibitive toxicities. By 
competing -risk analysis, the estimated cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery was 100% by 
Day+29, with a median of 20 (range 14 -29) days. Platelet recovery ≥ 20,000/µL was 100% by 
Day+46, with a median of 32 (range 12 -46) day s. By Day+60, 14/15 (93%) evaluable patients 
achieved full donor chimerism in either CD3+ or unsorted cells. Notably, there were no cases of  
grade III-IV aGVHD. Grade ≥ II aGVHD was limited to 2 cases of skin -only grade II aGVHD 
and 1 case of grade II skin and ungradable visceral aGVHD. By competing -risk analysis, the 
estimated cumulative incidence of grade II aGVHD was 12% at Day+100 (90% confidence 
interval ( CI), 0-27%) and 19% at Day+180 (90% CI, 2 -37%). The cumulative incidence of any 
cGVHD at 1 and 2 years was 7% (90% CI, 0 -18%). Critical illness prior to relapse was limited to 
1 case of sepsis which resolved. With a 3 -year median follow -up, the probability of PFS was 
56% at 1-year and 50% at 3 years. The cumulative incidence  of relapse was 44% at 1-year. 
Median OS has not been reached, with an estimated 1 -year and 3 -year OS of 68% .  
 
In order to broaden the expanded access which this protocol will provide to patients without a 
matched donor to additional patients, we have included the option of myeloablative conditioning 
(Shabbir -Moosajee, Lombardi, & Ciurea, 2015).  Although this PTCy approach has not been 
tested using mismatched unrelated donors, there is evidence for its efficacy in the haploidentical 
setting . Data  published in abstract ( Symons  et al. , 2015) from Johns Hopkins University is 
presented here (personal communication: Heat her Symons). 96 patients have been transplanted 
using the PTCy, CNI and MMF approach using unmanipulated BM from haploidentical donors. 
73 patients received Busulfan (Day -6, -5, -4 and -3, adjusted to AUC) and Cytoxan (day -2 and -
1, 50mg/kg/day) (Symons  et al. , 2015); 23 received standard CyTBI conditioning (Thomas  et al. , 
1977).  Median patient age was 42 (range: 1 -65), and transplants were done for diverse 
hematological malignancies. 80/88 patients were eligible for assessment of chimerism at day 60,

NMDP IRB Approv ed with 91% having >95% donor chimerism at that time. Rates of grade II -IV and III -IV acute 
GVHD were 17% and &% respectively. Chronic GVHD occurred in 15% of patients (5% 
moderate/severe). The TRM at 100 days and 1-year was 6% and 11%, and relapse at the 1-year 
and 3 years was 36% and 44%. Overall survival at 1-year is 72%. Based on these encouraging 
results we include the option of a myeloablative approach in this study.  
 
Given that this is the only current experience with PT Cy in the unrelated donor  setting, and the 
lack of increased toxicity with PTCy and sirolimus as described above, we will use a harmonized 
approach to GVHD prophylaxis for all patients in this study irrespective of conditioning 
regimen. This approach is also supported by in vitro data showing synergi sm between PT Cy and 
sirolimus  (Fitzhugh et al., 2013) . Additionally , sirolimus promotes Treg expansion, and may 
inhibit graft rejection and GVHD by promoting T -cell tolerance  (Cutler & Antin, 2004 ). There 
may also be positive antiviral and graft versus leukemia effects ( Kasamon et al., 2012).  
 
Based upon the encouraging safety and efficacy data from the Johns Hopkins University study  and 
the potential advantages of using HLA -mismatched unrelated versus related donors , we wish to 
test the safety and anti -tumor efficacy of HLA MMUD bone marrow transplantation with PTCy, 
sirolimus and MMF in a national, multi -center Phase II trial.  
 
1.2 Rationale for Study  
The proposed study wi ll evaluate outcomes in MMUD bone marrow transplant recipients using 
either FIC or RIC regimens with PTCy, sirolimus and MMF for GVHD prophylaxis , where 
patients do not have an HLA -identical sibling or 8/8 matched unrelated donor  available. This 
study will extend the single center  approach used at Johns Hopkins  University  in the non -
myeloablative setting  to a multi -center setting.  In addition, it will test the encouraging results of 
myeloablative conditioning in the haploidentical setting to that of MMUD.  
  
2 STUDY DESIGN  
2.1  Study Overview  
This is a multi -center, single arm  Phase II study to assess the safety and efficacy of MMUD bone 
marrow transplantation using PTCy, sirolimus and MMF for GVHD prophylaxis .  The purpose is 
to determine whether results in a single center setting can be duplicated in a multi -center setting  
with survival outcomes similar to those achieved with haploidentical bone marrow HCT  using a 
similar approach .   
 
2.2 Hypotheses and Objectives  
2.2.1 Primary Hypothesis  
Our primary hypothesis is that 1-year survival after HLA MMUD bone marrow 
transplantation  is 65%  or higher , similar to the 1-year survival observed after 
haploidentical (related) donor bone marrow transplantation . 
 
2.2.2 Secondary Hypotheses  
1. Greater than 90% of subjects will engraft and more than 80%  of engrafting subjects 
will achieve  95% donor chimerism by Day+56.

–DRB1,  -DQB1, -DQA1, -DPB1, -DPA1 ) with MFI >1000 by solid phase 
immunoassay  
 
2.5 Donor Prioritization Schema  
The donor search will be coordinated centrally by the NMDP but the fina l donor selection will be 
made by the study site . The following donor selection characteristics must be considered to 
perform the selection : number of mismatches at HLA -A, -B, -C, -DRB1, -DQB1, -DPB1, donor 
age, donor -recipient  CMV serostatus  match , donor weight, donor -recipient  sex match , and 
donor -recipient  ABO group  match . In addition, CCR5delta32 genotype should be assessed in 
donors being considered for HIV-positive  patients . 
 
The MMUD selection algorithm (Appendix J) is the proposed search strategy that prioritizes 
donor age, CMV serostatus, and ABO match over HLA match. This strategy should not be 
considered the prescribed search strategy for potential study subjects. Study sites may instead 
utilize institutional donor selection practices.

MMF  
MMF begins on Day +5, at least 24 hours after completion of PTCy. The  MMF dose is 15 
mg/kg PO TID ( according to adjusted IBW  (Appendix K) ) with total daily dose not to 
exceed 3  g (i.e. maximum 1 g PO TID). An equivalent IV dose (1:1 conversion) may  
instead be given. Dose modification guidelines are provided in section 2.6.4. MMF  
prophylaxis is discontinued after the last dose on Day +35, or may be continued if there is  
GVHD.  
 
Growth factors  
G-CSF (filgrastim) or a biosimilar begins on Day +5 at a dose of 5 mcg/kg/day ( according 
to actual body weight) IV or  SC (rounding to the nearest vial dose is allowed), until the 
ANC is ≥ 1,000/mm3 over the course of 3 consecutive days. Additional G -CSF may be

NMDP IRB Approv ed 2.6.2 Supportive Care  
Subjec ts should receive supportive care including transfusions, antiemetics, infection 
prophylaxis and nutritional support according to institutional guidelines. Infection 
prophylaxis should include, but is not limited to, agents or strategies to prevent herpes 
simplex, CMV, Pneumocystis jirovecii , and fungal infections.  
Seizure prophylaxis must be given with busulfan containing regimens per institutional 
guidelines.  
Herbal supplements and nutraceuticals are contraindicated.  
HIV-positive  subjec ts: ARV is only effective when administered in combination and with 
consistency. Single agent therapy or repeated interruptions in therapy lead to drug 
resistance. The ARV guidelines (Appendices D and E)  are designed to minimize the 
possibility of drug interactions with high dose chemotherapy. ARV should be 
administered only when it is anticipated that the ARV regimen can be taken on a 
consistent basis (i.e., conditioning  regimen toxicities such as nausea and mucositis will 
not interfere with dosing s chedules). In cases where the subject receives an HCT using a 
CCR5delta32 homozygous donor, ARV should be continued through  at least  Day+100.  
• Subjec ts on RIC Regimens : Subjec ts will continue on ARV therapy.

2.6.4 Risks and Toxicities  
Below is a list of the most common toxicities for therapies used in this study. See the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration ( FDA )-approved package insert for each drug for a 
comprehensive list of AEs. 
 
Busulfan  (Busulfex®)  
Busulfan (1, 4 -dimethanesulfonoxybutane) is an alkylating agent. The drug is extensively 
metabolized by the liver and its metabolites are eventually excreted in the urine.  
 
Busulfan toxicities  include:  
• Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, constipation, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, 
anorexia, dyspepsia, mucositis , stomatitis  
• Hepatobiliary: VOD/SOS  
• Neurologic: h eadache, insomnia, seizures , dizziness  
• Cardiovascular: hypertension, hypotension and tachycardia  
• Pulmonary: dyspnea, lung fibrosis , cough  
• Endocrine and metabolic: electrolyte imbalance  
• Genitourinary: amenorrhea,  dysmenorrhea,  infertility  
• Dermatologic: rash, urticarial  
• Miscellaneous: rhinorrhea, cataracts , fluid retention  
 
PK monitoring of Busulfan is required  to achieve a daily AUC target of 4800 -5300 
μM*min (Perkins et al., 2012 ). Busulfan  dosing is based on adjusted IBW (Appendix K), 
unless the subject weighs less than IBW, in which case dosing is based on  actual body 
weight.  
 
Fludarabine (Fludara®) 
Fludarabine is a fluorinated nucleoside analog. After phosphorylation to fluoro -ara-
adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) the drug  appears to incorporate into DNA and inhibit DNA 
polymerase alpha, ribonucleotide reductase and  DNA primase, thus inhibiting DNA 
synthesis. Excretion of f ludarabine is impaired in subjec ts with  impaired renal function.  
 
Fludarabine toxicities include:  
• Hematologic: hematopoietic suppression including neutropenia with increased 
risk of infection and immunosuppression  
• Neurologic: peripheral neuropathy and encephalopathy manifested by fatigue, 
weakness, paresthesia, visual disturbances, somnolence and coma  
• Gastrointestinal: nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomatitis  
• Dermatologic: rash, urticarial  
• Pulmonary: cough, idiopathic pneumonitis , dyspnea  
• Miscellaneous: fever   
 RCI BMT Protocol #15 -MMUD  
  Version 4.0 March 14, 2018  
42 
NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed Dose adjustments of fludarabine are required for renal insufficiency if the estimated CrCl 
is < 60  mL/min ( per section 2. 6.1). Fludarabine BSA dosing is based on adjusted ideal 
body weight (IBW) (Appendix K), unless the subject weighs less than IBW, in which 
case dosing is based on actual body weight.  
 
Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan®) 
Cyclophosphamide  (Cy) is an alkylating agent. It is activated by the liver cytochrome 
P450 system to  cytotoxic metabolites, which form cross -links with DNA. It is cell cycle -
nonspecific.  
 
Cy toxicities include:

Mesna  (Mesnex®) 
Mesna (sodium -2-mercaptoethanesulphonate) is a prophylactic agent used to prevent 
hemorrhagic  cystitis induced by the oxa zophosphorines ( Cy and ifos famide). It has no 
intrinsic  cytotoxicity and no antagonistic effects on chemotherapy. Mesna binds with 
acrolein, the urotoxic  metabolite produced by the oxa zophosphorines, to produce a non -
toxic thioether and slows the rat e of acrolein formation by combining with 4 -hydroxy 
metabolites of oxa zophosphorines.  
 
Mesna t oxicities  include :  
• Cardiovascular: hypotension  
• Dermatologic: rash, urticarial  
• Gastrointestinal : nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, altered taste  
• Neurologic: headache, joint or limb pain  
• Miscellaneous: fatigue

Pre-HCT  Mesna : pre-transplant use of mesna and dosing will be done according to 
institutional standards. A recommended approach is as follows: mesna IV dose ≥ 80% of 
the total daily dose of Cy and given in divided doses 30 minutes before and at 3, 6, and 8 -
9 hours after completion of C y. Mesna is dosed according to adjusted IBW (Appendix 
K), unless the subject weighs less than IBW, in which case mesna will be dosed 
according to actual weight.  
 
Post-HCT  Mesna : the recommended approach is mesna IV dose ≥ 80% of the total daily 
dose of Cy, given in divided doses 30 minutes before and at 3, 6, and 8 -9 hours after 
completion of Cy . Institutional standards for mesna use and dosing may  be used when 
necessary.  Mesna is dosed according to IBW, unless the subject weighs less than IBW, in 
which case mesna will be dosed according to actual body weight.   
 
 
MMF  (Cellcept®) 
MMF is an ester prodrug of the active immunosuppressant mycophenolic acid (MPA).  
 
MMF t oxicities include:  
• Hematologic: pancytopenia  with increased risk of infection and 
immunosuppression , anemia  
• Cardiovascular: hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia  
• Dermatologic: rash, urticarial  
• Gastrointestinal : nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, altered taste,

effectiveness of birth control  
• Endocrine and metabolic: hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalances  
• Pulmonary:  dyspnea  
• Miscellaneous: fatigue, changes in vision, edema , unusual contusions, allergic 
reaction, leg cramps  
 
Drug interactions: MMF activity is decreased with oral antacids and cholestyramine. 
There are no  pharmacokinetic interactions with cotrimoxazole, oral contraceptives, or 
cyclosporine. Acyclovir or  ganciclovir blood levels may increase due to competition for 
tubular secretion. High doses of  salicylates or other highly protein -bound drugs may 
increase the free fraction of MPA and  exaggerate the potential for myelosuppression.  
 
Dose adjustments: No dose adjustments are required for liver dysfunction. For renal 
insufficiency,  MMF dosing should not be modified unless dialysis is needed, in which 
case MMF can be reduced  to 25 -50% of the starting dose.

not to exceed 3 g (i.e. maximum 1 g PO TID). An equivalent IV dose (1:1 conversion) 
may instead be given.  
 
 
Sirolimus (rapamycin, Rapamune®) 
Sirolimus is an immunosuppressant that inhibits cytokine -stimulated T -cell activation and  
proliferation, and also inhibits antibody formation.  
 
Drug formulations: The mean bioavailability of sirolimus after administration of the 
tablet is ~27%  higher than the oral solution. Sirolimus oral tablets are not bioequivalent 
to the oral solution. Clinical  equivalence has been demonstrated at the 2 -mg dose level; 
however, it is not known if higher doses  are clinically equivalent on a mg to mg basis.  
a. Sirolimus oral solution: sirolimus oral solution (1 mg/mL) should be stored 
protected  from light and refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). For dilution, 
the appropriate dose  should be measured using an amber oral syringe, then added 
to a glass or plastic container  that holds at least 60 mL. Before taking the dose, it 
should be diluted with water or orange  juice then taken immediately; it should not 
be diluted with grapefruit juice. The syringe  should be discarded after one use. 
Sirolimus oral solution provided in bottles may develop a  slight haze when 
refrigerated, which does not affect product quality; allow the product to  stand at 
room temperature and shake gently until the haze disappears.  
b. Sirolimus tablets: sirolimus tablets are available in 1 mg and 2 mg tablets that 
cannot be  crushed or broken. Sirolimus tablets should be stored at 20° to 25° C 
(68°–77°F), protected  from light.  
 
Sirolimus t oxicities  include :  
• Gastrointestinal: constipation, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea , dyspepsia, 
vomiting , anorexia , stomatitis , ascites

c Lipid -lowering agent may be required; consider if fasting serum triglycerides are > 2.5 x ULN, and  recommend 
starting if > 800 mg/dL.  
 
Drug interactions:  
• Sirolimus is known to be a substrate for both cytochrome CYP3A4 and 
Pglycoprotein.  
 RCI BMT Protocol #15 -MMUD  
  Version 4.0 March 14, 2018  
46 
NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed • Agents that may increase sirolimus levels include tri -azole drugs (especially  
voriconazole and posaconazole*), amiodarone, calcium channel blockers, 
macrolide antibiotics (but  not azithromycin), micafungin, gastrointestinal 
prokinetic agents (cisapride, metoclopramide),  cimetidine, cyclosporine, 
grapefruit juic e, and HIV protease inhibitors.  
• Agents that may decrease  sirolimus levels include anticonvulsants 
(carbamazepine , phenobarbital, phenytoin), rifamycins, St.  John’s Wort.  
Dose adjustments:  
• The sirolimus dose is adjusted to maint ain a serum trough level of 5 -15 ng/mL.   
• Changes in levels due to altered bioavailability should be apparent wit hin 24 -48 
hours.  
• For sirolimus  without CNI as in this study, a 20 -25% reduction of sirolimus dose 
is recommended for trough levels  >12 – 18 ng/mL, and a 20 -25% increase is 
recommended for trough levels < 5 ng/mL.  
• Renal failure does not affect the excretion of sirolimus.  
• Excretion is reduced in liver failure;  impaired hepatic function should prompt 
consideration of reduction in sirolimus maintenance doses  but no dose adjustment 
of the loading dose is necessary.  
 
Due to extreme interactions with triazole antifungal agents (fluconazole, itraconazole, 
clotrimazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, ketoconazole) sirolimus should be 
administered cautiously together with fluconazole, itraconazole, or posaconazole, 
and with extreme caution if administered together with voriconazole .  If co -
administration is unavoidable, then the dose of sirolimus should be greatly reduced when 
used in combination with an azole  antifungal medication as recommended in  Table 2.6 D 
(Pidala, Alousi,  & MacMillan, 2015) and that there should be very frequent monitoring of 
trough concentrations of sirolimus in whole blood.  Sirolimus concentrations should be 
measured upon initiation, during co-administration, and at discontinuation of antifungal 
treatment, with sirolimus doses adjusted accordingly.

Subjects must be consented  prior to study -specific  
evaluations/procedures/tests/interventions  (i.e. evaluations/procedures/tests/interventions 
that are beyond standard of care and directly required per protocol) .  Subjec ts having 
documented informed consent and meeting all eligibility criteria for the study should  be 
enrolled at least 7 days prior to the start of conditioning.  
• Note: HIV -positive subjects must be enrolled prior to col lection of the pre -
conditioning  Latent HIV R eservoir sample  (sample collection to take place within 
8 weeks prior to the start of conditioning).  
 
Subjects are to be registered using the following procedures:  
• If not yet establish ed, generate a CIBMTR Research Identification Number 
(CRID) using the tool in the FormsNet3 data entry system.  
• An authorized user at the center completes the 15 -MMUD Demograp hics and 
Inclusion/Exclusion  forms in the Rave module .  
 
3.2 Withdrawal Procedures   
Subjects have the right to withdraw consent for study participation at any time and for any 
reason.  If a subject withdraws prematurely after HCT,  all data normally collected at the 1-year 
study time point  should be gathered at the time of premature discontinuation and reported  in the   
forms in the  Rave module .   
An explanation of why the subject is withdrawing from the study  must be documented in the 
medical record and the Study Exit form in the Rave module .  All subjects who withdraw from 
the study with an ongoing AE must be followed until resolution of the event, death, or until the 
investigator concludes that the event is stable with no further improvement anticipated.  
Subjects lost to follow -up must be reported on the Study Exit form in the Rave module . 
In the case that the subject decides to prematurely discontinue study treatment (“refuses 
treatment”), the subject must be asked if he or she can be contacted for further information. The 
outcome of that discussion must be documented in the medical record.  
 
4 STUDY ENDPOINTS  
4.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for the study is OS at 1-year post-HCT.  Subjects who are lost to follow -up 
prior to 1-year will be censored at the time of the last observation, and the OS proportion will be 
estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method.

5 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
5.1 General Considerations  
All available data will be used and missing data will not be estimated or carried forward in any 
statistical summary or analyses. Descriptive summary statistics include the number of subjects, 
mean, median, percent coefficient of variation (if required), s tandard deviation, and minimum 
and maximum values (quantitative variables) or the number of subjects and percentages by 
category (qualitative variables). Baseline is defined as the last non -missing value prior to the 
receipt of study regimen.  
 
5.2 Study Design  
This study i s a single arm  Phase II, multi -center trial. It is designed to assess OS 1-year after 
HLA -MMUD  bone marrow HCT  and PTCy.  The sample size is 80 subject s split into two strata 
of 40 subjec ts each for separate analysis.  One stratum will include subjec ts receiving FIC, and 
the other will include  subjec ts receiving RIC.   
 
5.2.1 Accrual  
The target sample size is 80 subject s accrued into two strata: 4 0 subjec ts receiving FIC 
and 40 subjec ts receiving RIC. It is estimated that two years of accrual will be necessary 
to enroll the targeted sample size. Accrual will be reported by race, ethnicity, sex, and 
age.  If accrual to one of the strata occurs faster than for the other stratum, we will 
conduct the analysis for th e stratum which is accrued faster without waiting for the other 
stratum to close and complete follow up.  
  
5.3 Sample Size and Power Considerations   
The sample size is 80 subject s for this trial, split into two strata of 40 subject s each (subjec ts 
receiving FIC and subjec ts receiving RIC will be analyzed separately ).  Ninety percent CIs were 
calculated for varying probabilities based on the sample si ze.  Table 5.3A  provides CIs for a 
variety of true underlying proportions.  Of particular interest is where the OS probability is 65%, 
which is the targeted 1-year survival probability.  For this setting, the CI length is 2 7%.  The 
percentages above and below this range are meant to represent other plausible PFS percentages.   
 
 RCI BMT Protocol #15 -MMUD  
  Version 4.0 March 14, 2018  
55 
NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed The precision of the estimates alternatively could be viewed as a lower bound on the probability 
of OS.  The probability to rule out OS percentages of a certain size is known as “power.”  Table 
5.3B  provides the probability (or power) that the lower bound of a 90% two -sided CI for the OS 
probability will be greater than various OS thresholds between 40% and 55%.  In particular, 
when the true OS percentage is 65%, there is 80% power to rule out an OS percentage of ≤ 45%.  
This can equivalently be viewed as t esting the following hypothesis: H o: p = 0. 45 versus H 1: p ≠ 
0.45.  Based on table 5. 3B below, there is 8 0% power at = .10 (two -sided) to reject the null 
hypothesis if the true OS percentage is 65%.

40 60 27.3 45.8 73.1 
40 50 27.8 36.1 63.9 
 
The OS probability estimate will be based on the Kaplan -Meier product limit estimator using 
Greenwood’s formula as the variance estimate.  In the absence of censoring, the Kaplan -Meier 
estimate reduces to the simple binomial proportion.

5.4 Interim Analysis and Stopping Guidelines   
There will be no formal interim analyses for efficacy.  Monitoring of two key safety endpoints 
(overall mortality and grade III-IV aGVHD by Day+100) will be conducted  week ly. If a 
stopping rule as described below is triggered, enrollment will be paused while the DSM B 
conducts a review of the safety data.  Both grade III-IV aGVHD and overall mortality within 100 
days are expected to occur no more than 15% of the time; therefore, the same stopping rules will 
be applied to each safety endpoint.  The detailed s topping rule is shown in the table below . 
 
 RCI BMT Protocol #15 -MMUD  
  Version 4.0 March 14, 2018  
56 
NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed The DSMB has regularly scheduled meetings at least annually and as frequently as quarterly. 
Emergency meetings may be called at any time by either Monitoring Board Chairperson, Vice -
Chairperson or appropriate CIBMTR representative.

This toxicity pausing rule has a 10% chance of being triggered if the true toxicity rate is 15%, and 
a 92% chance of being triggered if the true toxicity rate is 35%.  If the true toxicity rate is 35%, 
the stopping rule will be triggered on average after a pproximately 16 subject s are evaluable for the 
safety endpoint.  Note that the pausing guidelines serve as a trigger for consultation with the DSMB 
for additional review, and are not formal “stopping rules” that would mandate automatic closure 
of study enr ollment.  
 
5.5 Analysis of Study Endpoints  
5.5.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary analysis will consist of estimating the 1 -year OS probability based on the Kaplan -
Meier product limit estimator, separately in the two strata (subjects receiving FIC; subjects 
receiving RIC).  The event is death from any cause.  The time to this event is the time from 
HCT to death, loss to follow -up, or end of study (whichever comes first). The 1 -year OS 
probability and 90% CI  will be calculated.  All transplanted subjects will be included in this 
analysis.   
 
5.5.2 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
Progression -free survival  
Death or relapse/progression will be considered events, and the PFS distribution will be 
estimated by the Kaplan -Meier curve, starting from the time of HCT .  A 90% CI will be 
constructed at Day+180 and +365.   
 
Transplant -related mortality  
TRM is death occurring in subject s in the absence of disease progression or relapse.  A 
cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 90% CI at Day+100, +180, 
and +365.  Progression/relapse will be considered as a competing risk.   
 
Cumulative i ncidence of neutrophil  recovery  
To assess the incidence of neutrophil recovery  from day of HCT , a cumulative incidence 
curve will be computed along with a 90% CI.  Death prior to neutrophil recovery  will be 
considered a competing risk.  
Cumulative i ncidence of platelet recovery

curve will be computed along with a 90% CI.  Death prior to platelet recovery will be 
considered a competing risk.  
 
Cumulative i ncidence of primary graft failure  
The frequency and proportion of subject s experie ncing primary graft failure by D ay+56 
will be described with a 90 % CI.  Death prior to primary graft failure  will be considered a 
competing risk.  
Donor Chimerism  
Peripheral blood donor chime rism will be measured at Day+28, +56, +100, +180, and 
+365.  The degree of donor chimerism will be summarized at each time point using 
descriptive statistics.   
Peripheral blood chimerism at Day +56 
The percentage of patients with peripheral blood chimerism  >95% by Day +56 will be 
summarized . 
 
Cumulative  incidence of a GVHD  
We will assess the incidence of grades II -IV and grades III -IV aGVHD from day of HCT .  
The first day of aGVHD onset at a certain grade will be used to calculate a cumulative 
incidence curve for that aGVHD grade.  An overall cumulative incidence curve will be 
computed along with a 90% CI at Day+100 with death and relapse considered as 
competing risks.  
 
Cumulative incidence of cGVHD  
To assess the incidence and severity of cGVHD from day of HCT , a cumulative 
incidence curve will be computed along with a 90% CI at Day+180 and 365 .  Death and 
relapse prior to occurrence of cGVHD will be considered as competing risks.  
 
Cumulative i ncidence s of viral reactivations  and infections  
To assess the i ncidence of CMV, EBV, BK, ADV , and HHV -6 viral activations  and 
infections , a cumulative incidence curve will be computed along with a 90% CI at 
Day+100, +180 and +365. 
 
Cumulative incidence of relapse/progression  
To assess the incidence of progression/relapse from day of HCT , a cumulative incidence 
curve will be computed along with a 90% CI at Day+180 and +365.  Death prior to 
progression/relapse will be considered as a competing risk.   
 
Cumulative incidence s of TMA and VOD /SOS  
The cumulative incidence of TMA  and VOD /SOS  will be described in transplanted 
subject s, treating death as a competing risk.  
 
Proportio n of subjec ts proceeding to transplant   
The proportion of subjec ts proceeding to HCT will be described , along with a breakdown 
of the reasons for not proceeding to HCT and their frequencies.

6.2 Adverse Event and Unanticipated Problem Reporting  
6.2.1 Event Definitions  
Adverse Event  – Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical 
treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to the medical 
treatment or procedure (attribution of definite, probable, possible, unlikely, or unrelated).  
 
Expected Adverse Event – Any AE listed in the informed consent, product inserts, or 
study materials.  
 
Life-Threatening Adverse Event – Any AE that places the participant, in view of the 
investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) – Any AE that results in any of the following outcomes: 
death, a life threatening AE, in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
 RCI BMT Protocol #15 -MMUD  
  Version 4.0 March 14, 2018  
61 
NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed hospitalization, a persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event  – Any AE, the specificity or severity of which is NOT listed 
in the study protocol, product inserts or informed consent document.  
 
Unanticipated Probl em – any incident, experience, or outcome that meets  all of the 
following criteria:  
1. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the 
Institutional Review Board  (IRB)-approved research protocol and informed 
consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being 
studied;  
2. related or possibly related to participation in the research; and  
3. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was 
previously known or recognized.  
 
See Appendix L  for further details and examples.  
 
Attribution  – The determination of whether an AE is related to a medical treatment or 
procedure.  Attribution categories:  
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study procedure/treatment(s).  
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study procedure/treatment.  
o The AE is not likely to be caused by the subject’s underlying medical 
condition or other concomitant therapy, and the nature of the AE or the 
temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and study 
procedure /treatment administration lead the investigator to believe that 
there is a reasonable chance of causal relationship.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study procedure/treatment(s).  
o The AE could be attributed to the subject’s underlying medical 
condition or other concomitant therapy, but the nature of the AE or the 
temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and study 
procedure/ treatment administration lead the investigator to believe that 
there could be a causal relationship.  
• Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related  to the study procedure/treatment(s).  
• Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related  to the study 
procedure/treatment(s).  
o The AE is most plausibly explained by the subject’s underlying medical 
condition or other concomitant therapy, or the AE has no plausible 
biological relationship to study procedure/ treatment.  
 
Grade  – Severity of the AE.  All toxicities will be graded using the Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE) Version 4.03.  The CTCAE includes 
a grading (severity) scale for each AE term :

7.1 Investigator Reporting Responsibilities   
Circumstances may arise whe n it is necessary for subject safety to deviate from the study 
protocol. When feasible, Investigators should contact the protocol chair s and CIBMTR 
Protocol Coordinator beforehand to discuss the intended deviation (s). All deviations, whether 
approved beforehand or not, are required to be  documented and explained by the 
Investigator, and  reported to the study sponsor within 7 business  days.  
All protocol deviations will be documented in the Rave module by the study s ponsor.  
Study sites  are also required to note deviations in patient medical records and report them to 
their local IRB in accordance with local policies. All protocol devia tions will be compiled 
centrally by the CIBMTR Protocol Coordinator  and reported to the NMDP DSMB.  
Non-emergency minor deviations from the protocol will be permitted with approval from  the 
CIBMTR Protocol Coordinator.  
 
7.2 Study Monitoring

NMDP PROCEDURE FOR IDENTIFIC ATION OF CCR5DELTA32 MUTATION 
HOMOZYGOUS DONORS RELATED TO THIS PROTOCOL  
 
Background  
A recent case report by Hütter et al. (NEJM, 2009) documented the outcome of an allogeneic 
HCT performed for the treatment of AML in which the well -matched donor was selected for 
homozygosity for the CCR5delta32 mutation. The recipient had been known to be  HIV-
infected prior to developing AML and the German transplant team hypothesized that 
hematopoietic cells from such a donor could confer natural resistance to HIV infection in the 
transplanted hematopoietic and immune cells. A single HLA -matched donor hom ozygous for 
the CCR5delta32 mutation was identified among approximately 80 well -matched donors and 
an allogeneic HCT for the treatment of the patient’s AML was performed using that donor. 
Following HCT , the recipient’s ARV medications were discontinued and viral titers were 
monitored. No subsequent recrudescence of HIV replication was detected. The recipient 
relapsed with AML approximately one year later but a second HCT using the same donor 
was successfully performed with c ontinued primary disease remissio n and HIV control with 
undetectable HIV viral loads two years following the second HCT (Hütter, personal 
communication).  
 
The 15 -MMUD Protocol Team would like to replicate these findings in the context of 
allogeneic HCT  as proposed under this protocol. It is known that the incidence of 
CCR5delta32 homozygosity is essentially limited to European populations, with highest 
incidence in Northern Europeans (Galvani and Novembre, 2005); from these data, it is 
apparent that non -European populations manifest hom ozygosity too rarely to warrant 
evaluation. Additionally, it is also known that donor ethnicity strongly correlates with 
recipient ethnicity.  
 
In view of that fact that this protocol allows the use of HLA MMUDs  there is a statistically 
higher chance of finding a CCR5 delta 32 mutation homozygous donor  for the patient.  
 
Assessment of donor CCR5delta32  homozygosity  should be considered  for any HIV -positive  
patient who meets the criteria for inclusion in the 15-MMUD  protocol . 
 
CCR5delta32 homozygosity status will be considered for  donors who have been previously 
typed for this polymorphism and have the information available at the time of the search. No 
additional sample collection  or informed consent is required  for these donors .

TREATMENT REVIEW COMMITTEE FOR HIV -POSITIVE  SUBJECT S 
 
Due to the complex nature of the patient population and the potential for numerous drug -drug 
interactions between the ARV  regimen and the allogeneic HCT  conditioning regimen, each 
subject’s conditioning regimen must be reviewed with the Treatment Review Committee. 
This review should typically occur at least 4 weeks prior to the planned conditioning regimen 
start date in order to allow sufficient time for any necessary adjustments to the subject’s 
medication regimen.   
 
The treating institution will review subject s with the Treatment Review Committee prior to 
the initiation of HCT therapy by a review panel composed of experts in HIV drug resistance, 
HIV care, pharmacology, HCT infectious diseases and oncology. Recommendations for HCT 
are based on the following supporting documentation:  
 
− Current diagnosis  
− Past medical history  
− Prior ARV history  
− Documented ARV drug toxicities  
− Drug allergies  
− History of HLA B57 antigen testing, if available  
− Current creatinine and liver function test s  
− Past and recent HIV drug resistance test results  
− Current ARV drug regimen  
− Current concomitant medications  
 
The Committee will review available past and current HIV -1 genotype results for subject s 
with detectable  viremia so as to exclude subjec ts with multi -drug resistant HIV -1 who are 
unlikely to achieve viral suppression on alternate ARV regimens . The Committee will also 
advise with regard to various drug interactions anticipated during the course of HCT . The 
Treatment Review Committee will include well -qualified investigators from the Johns 
Hopkins University. Review materials will be sent to the panel 4 weeks  prior to initiation of 
HCT therapy to allow sufficient time for implementation of recommendations for the ARV 
regimen.  The Treatment Review form and de -identified copies of the supporting 
documentation (noted above) must be submitted to the CIBMTR Protocol Coordinator. The 
CIBMTR Protocol Coordinator will then provide these materials to the Treatment Review 
Committee to conduct their review.

SUGGESTED PROPHYLAXIS FOR HIV -POSITIVE  SUBJECT S 
 
Infectious prophylaxis for HIV -positive  subject s undergoing HCT will include prophylaxis 
for:  
1. Bacteria : In keeping with the BMT CTN MOP and local institutional standards.  
2. Pneumocystis Jiroveci Pneumonia:  Prophylaxis will be administered until CD4 counts are 
>200 and for a minimum of 6 months. Several effective regimens are available. Subject  
tolerance (nausea, allergic reaction, G6PD or other considerations) may contraindicate a 
particular regimen. Choices in order of preference are: 1) TMP/SMX 1 double -strength 
daily; 2) TMP/SMX 1 single strength  daily; 3) dapsone 100 mg daily (may be decreased 
to 50 mg daily if given in combination with pyrimethamine as described below for 
toxoplasmosis prophylaxis; 4) atovaquone 1500 mg daily; and, 5) aerosolized or IV 
pentamidine monthly, or per institutional standard.  
3. Toxoplasmosis:  Subject s on TMP/SMX do not require additional prophylaxis. If 
toxoplasma IgG is positive and TMP/SMX cannot be used subject s should be 
prophylaxed for at least 3 months after HCT and until CD4>100. This prophylaxis may 
be either: 1) dapsone 50 mg PO daily and pyrimethamine 50 mg/week and leucovorin 25 
mg/week or 2) atovaquone 1500 mg daily plus pyrimethamine 25 mg/day plus leucovorin 
10 mg/day. Since all medications for toxoplasmosis prophylaxis are oral, and some 
subject s may be unable to ta ke PO medications in the peri -HCT period, polymerase chain 
reaction ( PCR ) for toxoplasmosis should be checked at least weekly whenever 
prophylaxis must be held in toxoplasma IgG positive subject s for more than a week and 
the CD4 is < 100.  
4. Fungi : Anti -fungal prophylaxis will be per local institutional practice. It is noted that in 
histoplasma endemic areas (Midwest and Puerto Rico) antifungal prophylaxis is standard 
for CD4 <150 and would be appropriate for at least 3 months after HCT and until 
CD4>150 ( see Appendix F for detailed interactions with ARVs ).  
5. Herpes simplex virus ( HSV )/varicella –zoster virus  (VZV ): One of the following 
regimens should be used for 1-year after HCT, or per institutional standard, unless the 
subject  remains on immunosuppressive acyclovir 400 - 800 mg PO BID, valaciclovir 500 
mg PO BID, or famciclovir 500 mg PO BID.  
6. M. Avium Complex (MAC ): If CD4 < 50, azithromycin suggested at 1200 mg q week or 
600 mg twice weekly.  
7. Hepatitis:  
a. Subject s with positive hepatitis B surface antigen should be evaluated for viral DNA 
replication (viral load) by a quantitative PCR me thod before enrolling the subjec t on 
the study.  
b. Lamivudine or newer generation of anti -hepatitis B agents, like tenofovir, should be 
started in those with detectable hepatitis B viral load according to institutional 
preferences. The goal of the treatment should be achieving undetectable (<500 
copies/ml) viral load status.  
c. Subject s should be maintained on anti -hepatitis B treatment throughout 
chemotherapy, throughout the HCT , and at least 1-year post-HCT .  
d. Subjects with hepatitis C must have achieved a sustained virologic response for 12 
weeks after cessation of antiviral treatment to be eligible for the study.

CORRELATIVE STUDY PROCEDURES  
 
The research samples supporting the correlative laboratory studies described below  in 
sections A, B, and C  will be required of all subjects  enrolled on this trial.  The laboratory 
study described in section D below applies only to HIV -positive subjects. All correlative 
studies were designed to address very specific questions relevant to this HCT trial. Detailed 
instructions regarding sample collection, packaging and shipping can be found in the 15 -
MMUD Clinical Trial Laboratory  Manual provided to study  sites.  
 
A. Gene Expression Profile Based Model to Predict Donor Cell Immune Tolerance  
In a previous investigation, Pidala and colleagues  examined peripheral blood 
transcriptional markers in tolerant and non -tolerant HCT recipients with the goals of 
developing an accurate phenotypic classifier and dissecting biologic mechanisms of 
immune tolerance following HCT with promising results. We will use this approach in 
this correlative study to prospectively investigate tolerance development following 
PTCy/sirolimus/MMF therapy among MMUD HCT.  
 
Aim 1: Identify and verify transcriptional markers predictive of immune tolerance 
development  
(a) Day+100 and/or Day +180 samples will be used for prediction of immune tolerance, 
defined by complete discontinuation of immunosuppression and absence of GVHD.  
 
Aim 2:  Investigate longitudinal change in transcriptional markers for prediction of 
immune tolerance development   
(a) Change in gene expression from Day+21 to Day+180 will be examined for prediction 
of immune tolerance development.  
 
Research blood samples will be collected from recipients  on Day+21, Day+100, and 
Day+180. Two PAXgene 2.5 mL -fill Blood RNA (IVD) tubes will be drawn at each time 
point. This whole blood collection system stabilizes RNA, and thus is ideal for collection 
and shipment from multiple study sites to H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center and Research 
Institute for analysis. Based on expected yield of 0.5 -1ug RNA/mL whole blood, total 
RNA isolated (~ 2.5 -5ug) will be more than sufficient for planned mRNA profiling 
platforms (Affymetrix ge ne array, Nanostring nCounter technology). RNA will be 
isolated from whole blood (total RNA, inclusive of small RNA to permit microRNA 
analysis), and RNA integrity confirmed.  
 
The collection of these samples should  be scheduled for Monday -Thursday of any given 
week . Samples must be stored at room temperature and shipped on the day of c ollection 
in an ambient sample shipping kit  for next morning receipt at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer 
Center and Research Institute .  
In rare cases where  samples must be  collected on Friday, Saturday,  or Sunday, samples 
must be sto red in the  refrigerator at 2 – 8°C until  shipped in a validated insulated cooled

Monday  or the next business day in the case of a holiday . 
 
B. Clonal Hematopoiesis Assessments  
Age-related clonal hematopoiesis has recently been found to affect significant proportion 
of otherwise asymptomatic older individuals. In order to examine the incidence of  HCT 
recipients  developing donor clonal hematopoiesis and potential functional and clinical 
consequences we will study post -HCT  DNA obtained from HCT recipients in the current 
study. Post -HCT  DNA will be obtained from recipient bone marrow research samples 
collected at the time of standard of care bone marrow aspirates performed on Day +100 
and Day +365. A custom panel (TBD) designed as a clinical leukemia panel  of genes 
important in oncogenesis will be evaluated  by targeted next -generation sequencing . To 
investig ate the propensity of donor clones for expansion and malignant transformation we 
will analyze the clonal architecture of donor -derived hematopoiesis in the recipients over 
time. We will apply targeted next -generation sequencing (as described above) to bett er 
understand the clonal dynamics in the recipients. We will analyze the changes in variant 
allele frequency of previously identified premalignant clones as well as the occurrence of 
additional cooperating mutations.  
 
Aim 1: To define the population of bone marrow recipients who develop donor clonal 
hematopoiesis  
 
Aim 2:  To determine the clinical and functional consequences of the hematopoietic 
clones marked by somatic mutations in donor -derived hematopoiesis post -HCT  
 
A 4 mL research bone marrow aspirate aliquot will be collected at the time of standard of 
care bone marrow aspirates performed at Day +100 and Day +365. The 4 mL aliquot of 
bone marrow will be added to two 2 mL -fill PAXgene Blood DNA tubes ( IVD) and 
shipped priority overnight to the CIBMTR Biorepository.  Samples will be frozen for 
later use for this correlative study, which will be conducted by a qualified investigator 
(TBD) .  
 
The collection of these samples should  be scheduled for  Monday -Friday  of a given week.  
Samples must be stored at room temperature and shipped on the day of c ollection in an 
ambient sample shipping kit  for next morning receipt at the CIBMTR Biorepository . If 
shipped on a Friday for Saturday delivery, the shipment must be designated for Saturday 
delivery.  
In rare cases where samples must be  collected on Saturday or Sunday, samples must be 
stored  upright  in the refrigerator at 2 – 8°C until ambient temperature shipment to the 
CIBMTR Biorepository  on Monday  or the next business day in the case of a holiday.  
 
C. Immune Reconstitution Studies  
Immune system reconstitution dynamics will be assessed by measuring absolute number 
of leukocytes and the percentage of T, B, NK, monocyte, and dendritic cell subsets as 
defined by multiparameter flow cytometry.  Post -HCT  peripheral blood samples will be

NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed collected to explore the relationships of immune cell populations with the development of 
acute and/or chronic GVHD, and with outcomes including PFS, TRM and OS.  
 
A peripheral blood research sample ( 10 mL ) will be collected  from recipients on  
Day+100 and Day +365. The 10 mL blood sample will be added to one 10 mL (or two 
6mL) sodium heparin blood tube and shipped priority overnight to Roswell Park Cancer 
Institute.  
 
The collection of these samples must be scheduled for Monday -Friday of a given week.  
Samples must be stored at room temperature and shipped on the day of c ollection in an 
insulated ambient  sample  shipping kit  for next morning receipt at Roswell Park Cancer 
Institute . If shipped on a Friday for Saturday delivery, the shipment must be designated 
for Saturday delivery.  
 
D. Latent HIV Cellular Reservoir Analysis  (HIV -positive patients only)  
In patients with undetectable viral load as measured in conventional assays, there is 
persistent viremia that can be measured at single copy/mL by specialized PCR analysis.  
This viremia may reflect virus being released by the decay of latently infected ce lls or 
possibly ongoing viral replication.  Therapies that impact on the latently infected 
reservoir might be expected to change the viremia if it mainly reflected the decay of 
latently infected cells. Pre -HCT conditioning therapies may kill cells that con stitute the 
latency reservoir and thus might thus be expected to impact on the reservoir and the very 
low level viremia that can be assessed by this assay.  
 
Required Latent HIV Research Sample Collections on HIV -positive Patients  
Once an HIV -positive patient  with one or more available MMUDs  that are homozygous 
for the CCR5delta32 mutation is consented and enrolled on the trial, a required peripheral 
blood research sample will be collected at approximately 8 weeks prior to initiation of 
ablative therapy.  The peripheral blood research sample (180 mL) will be collected and 
placed into eighteen (18) 10 mL EDTA containing, lavender -top Vacutainer tubes.  
Additional scheduled required Latent HIV research samples will be collected at Day +180 
and Day+365.   
HIV-positive patients may be contacted by researchers at the Sidney Kimmel 
Comprehensive Cancer Centre at Johns Hopkins regarding additional research requests 
after study completion. A separate  informed  consent would be required to participate in 
that research.  
The collection of these samples should be scheduled on only a Mon day, Tuesday or 
Wednesday of a given week. Samples must  be stored at room temperature and shipped on 
the day of collection in an insulated ambient shipping kit  for next morning receipt at the 
Johns Hopkins Laboratory . In all cases, this large volume peripheral blood sample 
collection should be scheduled with consideration of other standard of care and required 
research sample collections so that the collection of the entire sample volume might be 
possible. Study sites must notify  the CIBMTR Protocol Coordinator prior to sample 
collection at each time point  to advise of the planned collection date.

MMUD  SELECTION ALGORITHM  
  
Given no available suitable  8/8 m atched related or unrelated donor, study sites may utilize 
the proposed  MMUD  search strategy  process  noted below. This selection algorithm 
prioritizes donor age, CMV serostatus, and ABO match over HLA.  
 
1. Among donors who are at least 4/8 allele matched (HLA -A, -B, -C, -DRB1), exclude 
any donor with HLA alleles against  which the patient has specific antibodies.    
2. Attempt to find a donor that meets all following criteria:  
a. Young donor <30  years  over 31 -40 years over 41 -50 years  over 51 -60 years  
b. ABO m atched to patient over minor ABO mismatch over major ABO mismatch  
c. CMV serostatus matched to patient CMV (i.e. CMV positive donor for CMV 
positive patie nt) over CMV mismatch  
3. If donor mee ting all criteria in #2 above  is not available , the transplant team may 
choose among  donors using institutional practices regarding priorit izing  among these  
characteristics . 
4. Once donor age, ABO match and CMV status have been optimized , the following 
characteristics should be pursued (if possible ): 
a. Male over nulliparous female over parous female   
b. Donor having body weight sufficient for adequate cell collection per patient size, 
if data available  
c. Donor availability information (last donor contact date  with NMDP ) 
5. After optimizing non -HLA criteria, the transplant team may select  the donor based on 
HLA factors : 
a. Best allele match out of 8 alleles (HLA -A, -B, -C, -DRB1; 7>6>5>4)  
b. Consideration of -DPB1 allele matching (allele matching or T-cell-epitope   
permissive)  
c. Consideration of -DQB1 matching  
d. Consideration of other HLA -loci or genetic markers (e.g. -DRB3/4/5, Killer 
Immunoglob ulin-like Receptor)  
 
Selection for any HIV-positive patient  will prioritize donors homozygous for CCR5delta32 
mutation as the primary selection criteria.   Additional donor selection criteria with 
consideration of a ge, gender, donor weight, ABO matching, CMV matching and donor 
availability will be made by the transplant team.  
 
Multiple NMDP  resources are  available to assist study sites with donor selection assistance:   
• Traxis application : may  be used by study sites to search for donors. P lease note  the 
following  limitations : 
o Traxis results do not include  donors  <5/6 HLA -A, -B, -DRB1 antigen level match  
to the recipient .  
o This protocol allows for lower overall matching; many potential donors will not 
be available in the  default NMDP HapLogic listing  in Traxis .

  Version 4.0 March 14, 2018  
 
93 
NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed • NMDP Immunogenetic Operations group : may  use additional methods  to identify 
donors .  
• NMDP Case Management group : may use the MMUD selection algorithm with 
specific search factor(s) at the request of the study site. NMDP Case Management then 
provides a Search Strategy Advice (SSA)  report to the study site within 5 business days 
of the request. The results included in the SSA balance the MMUD algorithm with the 
study site’s specifications.  
 
During donor selection, study sites may consider other factors that may impact the product 
and/or the infusion:     
• Plans for c ell processing/manipulation may increase the potential for a reduction in TNC 
yield . 
• Product travel time may delay the planned  infusion date (and conditioning regimen 
schedule in relation to the infusion date) . 
o Late product pick -up time: some collection centers do not allow product pick -up 
until later in the day , which may result in product delivery  delay . 
• In instances where the product requires processing prior to infusion, it may be beneficial 
to delay Day 0 by one day (especially if t he product requires transcontinental travel ).

 Adjusted IBW  = IBW + 0.25 (Actual weight – IBW)   
 
The following formulas for pediatric and adult IBW calculations are 
recommended, but IBW may be calculated according to institutional SOPs.  
 
• Recommended I BW Calculation for Age 1 5 - 17 years  (Traub -Johnson 
Equation for Children):  
 
IBW = [(Height in cm)2 x 1.65]/1000  
 
• Recommended I BW Calculation for Age > 18 years :  
 
IBW (men)=50kg +2.3kg∗(heightover 60inches ) 
 
IBW (women )=45.5kg +2.3kg∗(heightover 60inches )

GUIDANCE ON REVIEW ING AND REPORTING  
UNANTICIPATED PROBLEMS  
 
For more information, see http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/policy/advevntguid.html#Q1.  
 
Below are pertinent excerpts from the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) Guidance on 
Reviewing and Reporting Unanticipated Problems Involving Risks to Subjects.  
 
I. What are unanticipated problems ? 
The phrase “unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others” is found but not defined in 
the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services ( HHS ) regulations at 45 CFR part 46.   OHRP 
considers unanticipated problems , in general, to include any incident, experience, or outcome that 
meets all of the following criteria:  
1. unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that are 
described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol and 
informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
2. related or possibly related to participation in the research (in this guidance document, possibly 
related  means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may 
have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and  
3. suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, 
psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
OHRP recognizes that it may be difficult to determine whether a particular incident, experience, or 
outcome is unexpected and whether it is related or possibly related to participation in the research.  
 
II. How to determine which AEs are unanticipated problems ? 
In OHRP’s experience, most IRB members, investigators, and institutional officials understand the 
scope and meaning of the term AE in the research context, but lack a clear understanding of OHRP’s 
expectations for what, when, and to whom AEs need to be reported as unanticipated problems, given 
the requirements of the HHS regulations at 45 CFR part 46.   
The following Venn diagram summarizes the general relationship between AEs and unanticipated 
problems:

NMDP IRB-2016 -0365  
NMDP IRB Approv ed  
To determine whether an AE is an unanticipated problem, the following questions should be asked:   
• Is the AE unexpected?  
• Is the AE related or possibly related to participation in the research?  
• Does the AE suggest that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm than 
was previously known or recognized?  
If the answer to all three questions  is yes, then the AE is an unanticipated problem.  
 
 
 
 
 
III. Some examples of unanticipated problems:  
 
• A series of related AEs that individually may not be unexpected but indicate a trend that 
places research participants or others at a greater risk of harm than was previously known or 
recognized.  
• A breach of confidentiality.  
• Incarceration of a participant in a protocol not approved to enroll prisoners.  
• Complaint of a participant when the complaint indicates unexpected risks.          
• A paper published from another study that shows that the risks or potential benefits of the 
research may be different than initially presented to the IRB.

Protocol Number: 017007
Protocol Title: A Safety Trial of Lisocabtagene Maraleucel (JCAR017) for Relapsed and Refractory (R/R) 
B-cell Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) in the Outpatient Setting (TRANSCEND -OUTREACH -007)
Sponsor: Juno Therapeutics ,Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Celgene Co rporation.
Study Rationale: 
JCAR017 is a CD19 -directed genetically modified autologous T -cell immunotherapy consisting of a defined 
composition of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T -cell product with flat dosing of both CD4+CAR+ and 
CD8+CAR+ T-cell subset s. Clinical trials of JCAR017 and other CAR T -cell products to date have been 
performed in tertiary care centers that have consolidated the site of care for CAR T -cell administration and 
follow -up. In the US, however, about 80% of patients receiving treatm ent for relapsed or refractory (R/R) 
diffuse large B -cell ly mphoma (DLBCL) in third line are treated outside of these centers. The product profile of 
JCAR017 is conducive to administration and monitoring in hospital outpatient clinics and cancer clinic 
networks; however, the safety profile of this product administered in nontertiary care centers has not been 
evaluated. Preliminary data from Juno Study 017001 show that treatment of this patient population with 
JCAR017 demonstrates encouraging efficacy results and a manageable safety profile, includi ng low rates of 
severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and neurotoxicity (NT) events, which support outpatient administration 
and outpatient monitoring for toxicity. Early experience with JCAR017 in Study 017001 suggests that outpatient 
administration of JCAR017 can be provided safely with appropriate education and outpatient monitoring, and
can reduce the duration of inpatient hospital stays by 40% when compared to inpatient administration (Maloney 
2017). Thus, a s afety  study  to assess the use of JCAR017 in no ntertiary  care outpatient settings is proposed to
confirm these initial findings . 
Study Objectives:
Primary :
To evaluate the safety of JCAR017 administered in nontertiary care centers as reflected by Grade ≥ 3 
adverse events (AEs) of CRS, NT, prolonged cytopenias, and infections in adult subjects with R/R
aggressive B -cell non -Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)
Secondary:
To evaluate the overall safety and tolerability of JCAR017 , including toxicit y management and 
outcomes 
To evaluate the safety of JCAR017 treatment in subjects monitored asoutpatient s
To assess the antitumor activity of JCAR017
To assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of JCAR017
To assess health -related quality of life (HRQoL) and health economics and outcome research (HEOR) 
Explo ratory

 
Study Design: 
This is an open -label, multicenter, Phase 2 study to assess the safety and efficacy of JCAR017 administered in 
nontertiary  care centers to adult subjects with R/R DLBCL, transformed DLBCL arising from indolent
histologies (tDLBCL),high -grade B -cell ly mphoma with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements with 
DLBCL histology ,primary  mediastinal B-cel llymphoma (PMBCL) and follicular lymphoma Grade 3B . There 
will be no control group in this study.

A total of 114 subjects may be enrolled to ensure that approximately 80 subjects are treated with JCAR017, with 
a minimum of approximately 50 treated subje cts monitored as an outpatient.
Upon enrollment, subjects will undergo leukapheresis to obtain lymphocytes for JCAR017 product generation. 
While JCAR017 is being manufactured and if required to control their disease, subjects may receive salvage 
low-dose c hemotherapy or 1 cycle of noncurative standard -of-care antitumo r therapy (ie, bridging therapy) .
Upon successful JCAR017 product generation, subjects will enter the treatment phase and will receive 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide (flu/cy) followed by JCAR017 at a dose 
of 100×106CAR T cells administered intravenously (IV) 2to 7days after completion of lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy. 
After treatment with JCAR017 , subjects will enter post -
treatment follow -up, and will be fo llowed on this study 
for up to 2 years for safety, PK and biomarkers, disease status, HRQoL, and survival, as described in more detail 
in the assessments sections below. Assessments for long -term safety, overall survival, and HRQoL will continue 
even after disease progression. After completing the 2 years of post -treatment follow -up in this protocol, long -
term follow -up (LT FU) for survival, long -term toxicity, and viral vector safety will continue under a separate 
protocol for up to 15 years following the last dose of JCAR017 .
Oversight
A Safety Review Committee (SRC), comprised of Principal Investigators , and the Sponsor’s medical monitor , 
safety physician, andstatistician will regularly assess the safety of JCAR017 administration throughout the trial. 
The SRC may make recommendations based on safety.

by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple uptake gated acquisitio n (MUGA) scan performed within
1month of the determination of eligibility 
7.Adequate vascular access for leukapheresis procedure (eithe r peripheral line or surgically placed line) 
8.Subjects who have received previous CD19 -targeted therapy must have CD19 -positive lymphoma 
confirmed on a biopsy since completing the prior CD19 -targeted therapy 
9.Females of childbearing potential*must:
a.Have 2 negative pregnancy tests as verified by the Investigator (one negative serum beta -human 
chorio nic go nadotropin [ß- hCG] pregnancy test result at screening, and within 48 hours prior to the 
first dose of lymphodepleting chemotherapy). This applies even if the subject practices true 
abstinence** from heterosexual contact.
b.Either commit to true abstinence** from heterosexual contact or agree to use, and be able to 
comply  with, effective contraception without interruption. Contraception methods must include 1
highly  effective method from screening until at least 12 months after the lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy.
c.Agree to abstain from breastfeeding during study participation and for at least 12 months following 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy. 
d.There are insufficie ntexposure data to provide any recommendation concerning the duration of 
contraception and the abstaining from breastfeeding following treatment with JCAR017. Any 
decision regarding contraception and breastfeeding after JCAR017 infusion should be discusse d 
with the treating physician.
Note: Highly effective methods are defined as those that result in a low failure rate ( ie, less than 
1% per y ear) w hen used consistently and correctly. The following are examples of highly effective 
and additional effective m ethods of contraception:
Intrauterine device (IUD)
Hormonal (birth control pill, injections, implants)

contraception following treatment with JCAR017. Any decision regarding contraception after 
JCAR017 infusion should be discussed with the treating physician.
* A female subjects of childbearing potential (FCBP) is a female who: 1) has achieved menarche at 
some point, 2) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy or 3) has not been naturally 
postmenopausal (amenorrhea following cancer therapy does not rule out childbearing potential) for at 
least 12 consecutive months (ie, has had menses at any time in the preceding 12 consecutive months).
**True abstinence is acceptable when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
In contrast, periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulatio n methods) and 
withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.
11.Subjects must agree to not donate blood, organs, sperm or semen, and egg cells for usage in other 
individuals for at least 1 year following lymphodepletion chemotherapy. There are insuf ficient 
exposure data to provide any recommendation concerning the duration of refraining from tissue 
donation following treatment with JCAR017. Therefore, subjects treated with JCAR017 should not 
donate blood, organs, tissues, and cells for transplantatio n

Drug Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration: 
The JCAR017 drug product is a defined composition of autologous CD4+CAR+ and CD8+CAR+ T cells that 
express a CD19 -specific chimer icantigen receptor ( CAR ) and a truncated epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFRt) that are provided as frozen cell suspensions for IV administration at a flat dose. The JCAR017 drug 
product is provided as 2 individually formulated CD4+CAR+ and CD8+CAR+ T-cell suspensions in media 
containing dimethyl sulfoxide for direct IV administration in equal CAR T -cell quantities .
JCAR017 is prepared at the site as 2separate T -cell suspensions in syringes at doses of 5 0×106CD8+CAR+ T 
cells and 5
0×106CD4+CAR+ T cells (total dose of 1 00×106CAR+ T cells) that are given IV in a single - dose 
schedule on Day 1 (between 2and 7days following the completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy). 
Duration of Study and Subject Participation: 
The duration of s tudy for each subject is up to 2years, and the estimated total time for all subjects to compl ete 
the study  is approximately years.
Safety Assessments: 
Adverse events/serious AEs (SAEs) and laboratory abnormalities (type, frequency, and severity) will be 
collected. Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) may include, but are not limited to , cytokine release 
syndrome ( CRS),neurological toxicity (NT), prolonged cytopenia , Grade ≥ 3infection, tumor lysis syndrome
(TLS ),macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) , infusion reactions, and hypogammaglobulinemia , autoimmune 
disorder, and second primary malignancy (SPM) .
Safety monitoring boundaries based on the incidence of Grade 3 or above JCAR017 -related AESIs are
established using a Bayesian framework to help detect safety signals during the course of the study . If the safety 
boundaries are crossed, enrollment will be paused and an ad hoc SRC meeting will be held to review the data. 
The study  will remain paused for enrollment pending the SRC’s recommendations. 
Efficacy Assessments: 
Tumo r response will be assessed by diagnostic quality (with contrast) computed tomography ( CT)scans (chest, 
neck, abdomen, and pelvis) and PET scans. Radiographic disease assessments will be performed pretreatment, at 
Day 29, and Months 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, a nd 24 mo nths following the JCAR017 treatment or until disease 
progression. Bone marrow involvement by lymphoma will be assessed by PET scan only; bone marrow aspirates 
and biopsies will not be required for assessment of disease response. Disease response a nd duration will be 
assessed by the Investigators according to the “Recommendations for Initial Evaluation, Staging, and Response 
Assessment of Hodgkin and Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma: The Lugano Classification” ( Cheson 2014 ).
For s ubjects with suspected or confirmed CNS involvement, repeat cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) assessments by 
flow cytometry will be performed.

Confident ial and Propri etary 23 Protocol 017007 Amendment 2.0: 17 Mar 20201. INTRODUCTION
1.1. B-cell Non -Hodgkin Lymphoma
Approximately  72,000 new cases o f non -Hodgkin lympho ma (NHL) will be diagnosed and 
approximately  20,000 pati ents will  die of  their disease in the United States in 201 9 (Siegel 
2019). NHL is the seventh most commo n cancer in the US, accoun ting for 4. 2% of new cancers 
and 3. 3% of all cancer -related deaths ( SEER 2019 ). In the US, 80% to 85% of NHL cases are as 
B cell lympho mas and 15% to 20% are T -cell/natural killer cell lympho mas ( NCCN 2019 ).
Diffuse large B -cell lympho ma (DLBCL) is the most commo n aggressive subt ype, const ituting 
approximately  30% of adul t pati ents wi th NHL in the US, Europe, and Japan ( Aoki 2008, Ferl ay 
2013, Novelli 2013, NCCN 2019 ). DLBCL is a disease o f the elderly, wi th a median age at 
diagnosis of approximately 70 y ears ( Issa 2015, Smit h 2015 ), although i t may  rarely  occu r in 
children and young adults. With current treatments, relapsed or refractory  (R/R) aggressive 
B-cell NHL have poor outcomes and the efficacy of salvage options are dim inished in the era of 
rituximab -containing regimens. As such, there remains a need to develop new therapi es for 
patients wi th R/R B -cell NHL.
Historically, fi rst-line treatment for patients with high -stage aggressive B -cell NHL, including 
DLBCL, primary mediast inal B -cell lymphom a (PMBCL), and follicular lympho ma Grade 3B, 
has been 6 or 8 cycles of rituximab with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, v incrist ine, and 
prednisone (R -CHOP), with reduced- intensity dosing regimens recommended for infirm or 
elderly  patients >80 years of age (NCCN 2019 ). Recently, data have been reported that support 
the use of more intensive therapy  for PMBCL in the upfront setting (NCCN 2019 ), and ongoing 
studi es are evaluat ing the effect of augmented RCHOP regimens on outcomes in high -risk 
subtypes of aggressive B -cell NHL.
Approximately  one-third of  DLBCL patients will be refractory  to or relapse after R -CHOP 
therapy  within 5years of di agnosis 
(Cunningham 2013 ). Pati ents at hi gh risk of  relapse to 
R-CHOP include those with a high internat ional prognostic index (IPI) score (Ziepert 2010 , 
Cunningham 2013 ), those with act ivated B -cell or nongerminal center B -cell (GCB) origin (Fu 
2008, Culpin 2013 ), and doubl e -hit DLBCL, now referred to as high- grade B -cell lymphom a 
with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements (Friedberg 2012, Morgan 2013) . In these 
high-risk groups, 50% or less o f patients ar e disease -free at 2 y ears (Ziepert 2010 , 
Culpin 2013 , 
Morgan 2013) . Overall survival (OS) for all DL BCL patients approaches 75% at 5years 
(Cunningham 2013 ); however, in high -risk pat ients, it may beas low as 25% to 30% (double- hit 
and n on-GCB) to 50% (IPI 3 to 5) at 5years (Ziepert 2010 , Culpin 2013 , Morgan 2013).
For pati ents who are refractory  to or rel apse foll owing f ront-line therapy and are eligible for 
autologous hem atopoiet ic stem cell transplant (auto -HSCT), various high -dose, pl atinum -based 
salvage chemotherapy  regimens are recommended (NCCN 2019 ). It is estimated that 35% to 
50% of R/R patients are not suitable for h igh-dose chemotherapy, for reasons including (but not 
limited to) comorbidit ies, poor performance status, or age, and are thus not eligible for HSCT .
These pat ients may be treated wi th a platinum and/or gemcitabine -based regimen such as 
rituximab, or gem citabine and oxaliplat in (R -GemOx), which may be co mbined with invo lved
field radi ation therapy  (El Gnaoui  2007 ), or preferent ially be enrolled in clinical trials testing the 
activit y of novel drugs or combinat ions of agents. The effect iveness of single -agent or 
combinat ion therapies is limited to a minorit y of those treated.

Protocol  017007 A Celgene Co mpany
Confident ial and Propri etary 24 Protocol 017007 Amendment 2.0: 17 Mar 2020There are 2 Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved treatment as a salvage regimen for 
patients wi th R/R aggressive large B -cell NHL a fter at l east 2 pri or therapi es-axicabtagene 
ciloleucel and tisagenlecleucel (discussed further below). Because th esetherapies wererecent ly 
approved (2017), most data on outcomes in this populat ion are from pat ients treated with 
combinat ions of agents or monotherapy  or experimental  therapies in clinical trials based on 
institutional preferences. The m ost comm only used t reatment is a combinat ion of ri tuximab wi th 
bendamustine (~25%) (Crump 2017 ). The effect iveness of co mbinat ion and single -agent 
therapi es for m ultiply relapsed, aggressive B -cell NHL is limi ted to a minori ty of those treated; 
specifically, the ORR (12% to 46%) and complete response ( CR) rates (6 %to 38%) are low; 
median PFS (< 6months) and median OS (< 12months) results are equally poor (Pettengell 
2012, Rigacci 2012 , Mounier 2013, Nagle 2013, Wang 2013, Czuczman 2014, Jacobsen 2015, 
Van Den Neste 2016 ).In a study  of the m ost comm only used combinat ion, rituximab and 
bendamustine, an ORR of 45% with a 15.5% CR was reported in pat ients with R/R DLBCL; 
median PFS was only 3.6 m onths (Vacirca 2013). Importantly, m ost pati ents in thi s study  had 
only 1prior therapy  (median = 1, range = 1 to9.Overall outcomes for patients who have 
relapsed after m ulti-agent salvage chemotherapy  and auto-HSCT, or were refractory  to sal vage 
therapy  and were not eligible for an auto -HSCT, are equally poor with medi an OS of 9.9 and 4.4 
months, respect ively (Nagle 2013, Van Den Neste 2016). In a recent meta -analysis o f DLBCL 
patients who were refractory  to thei r last chem otherapy -containing regimen or who r elapsed 
within 12 months after auto -HSCT (the SCHOLAR -1 study ), outcom es were even worse, with 
ORR of 26%, CR rate of 7%, and median OS of 6.3 months (Crum p 2017 ).Therefore, there is 
significant unmet need for patients who have R/R B -cell NHL.
1.2. CD19 as a Therapeutic Target
CD19 i s a 95 -kDa glycoprotein present on B -cells fro m early  devel opment until  different iation 
into plasma cells (Stam enkovic 1988) . It is a m ember of the immunoglobulin superfamily  and a 
component of a B -cell surface signal transduct ion complex that posit ively regulates signal 
transduction through the B -cell r eceptor (Stamenkovic 1988; Brent jens 2011) . 
CD19 i s an attractive therapeut ic target because it is expressed by most B -cell malignancies, 
including B -cell NHL ( Li 1993 , Li 1996 , Davila 2012 ). Importantly , the CD19 ant igen is not 
expressed on hematopoiet ic stem cells or on any normal t issue apart from those of the B -cell 
lineage. 
1.3. CD19 -Targeted Chim eric Antigen Receptors
CD19 -specific chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are single chain variable fragments (scFv) 
fused to a transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic signaling domains. Expressio n of the 
CD19 -directed CARs in autologous T cells (CAR T) is achie ved by  ex vivo transducti on using a 
recombinant retroviral or lent iviral vector. The CAR i s expressed on the T -cell surface and 
redirects the transfected T cells to CD19- expressing lympho ma cells, leading to CD19 -specific 
tumor cell recognit ion, lysis, cy tokine secret ion, and T -cell pro liferat ion (Sadelain 2013) . In 
clinical studies, CD19 -targeted CAR T cells have demonstrated encour aging act ivity in adult and 
pediatric subjects wi th R/R B -cell acute lymphoblasti c leu kemia (ALL) and B -cell NHL (Porter 
2011, Davila 2014a, Maude 2014, Kochenderfer 2015, Lee 2015, Park 2016, Turtle 2016a, 
Turtl e 2016b, Turtl e 2016c, Neel apu 2017, Schuster 2017 ).

1.4. JCAR017 Drug Product
The final JCAR017 investigational drug product includes 2individually formulated CD4+ CAR+
and CD8+ CAR+ T-cell suspensio ns in media containing dimethyl sulfo xide (DMSO ) that are 
thawed and infused separately. JCAR017 is administered by  intravenous (IV) infusio n.
The CD19 -specific CAR is introduced into autologo us CD4+ and CD8+ T cells ex vivo using a 
replicat ion-incompetent, self -inactivating lent iviral vector. The CD19 -specific CAR consists of 
an scFv binding do main derived fro m a murine CD19 -specific mo noclonal  antibody  (FMC63) 
and the 4- 1BB and CD3ζ chain sig naling do mains. Thetruncated epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFRt )protein is expressed as a separate cell surface protein for purposes of cell 
tracking.
Please refer to the JCAR017 Invest igator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed informat ion concerning the 
available pharmaco logy, toxi cology, clinical studi es, and adverse event (AE) profile of 
JCAR017.
1.5. Clinical Experience with JCAR017
Clinical study  017001 i s an ongoing open -label, mult icenter, pivotal Phase 1 study to determine 
the efficacy and safet y of JCAR017 in adults wit h R/R aggressive B -cell NHL, including 
DLBCL -NOS (de novo and transformed fro m indolent lympho ma), high -grade B -cell lympho ma 
with MYC and BCL2 and/or BCL6 rearrangements with DLBCL histology , PMBCL, fo llicular 
lympho ma Grade 3B, and mantle cell  lymphom a (MCL ). Two disease -specific cohorts are being 
enrolled: the DLBCL cohort and the MCL cohort. Subjects in the DLBCL cohort must have been 
treated with an anthracycline and rituximab (or other CD20 -targeted agent) and have R/R disease 
afterat least 2 lines of therapy or after auto -HSCT.
As of 12 April 2019, 255 subjects with DLBCL have undergone lymphodeplet ion chemotherapy  
with low-dose fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day for 3 days) + cycl ophosphamide (300 mg/m2/day for
3days) (fl u/cy) and were treated with JCAR017 at Dose Level 1 (5 0×106JCAR017 cells) ,Dose

2. STUDY PURPOSE AND RA
TIONALE
The purpose of this Phase 2 study  is to eval uate the safet y and antitumor activit yof JCAR017
administered in nontertiary  care centers in adult subjects with R/R aggressive B -cell NHL who 
have failed 2 or m ore lines o f therapy. 
Clinical trials o f JCAR017 and other CAR T -cell products to date have been performed in 
tertiary care centers that have consolidated the site of care for CAR T -cell administration and 
follow-up. In the US, however, about 80% of patients receiving treatment for R/R DLBCL in 
third lin e are treated outside of these centers (data on file) . The product profile o f JCAR017 is 
conducive to outpatient administration and toxicit y monitoring in hospital outpatient clinics and 
cancer clinic networks with toxicit y management in an associated hosp ital setting; however, the 
safet y profile of this product administered in nontertiary care centers has not been evaluated. 
Preliminary data from the ongoing Juno Study  017001 show that treatment of this patient 
popul ation with JCAR017 demonstrates encoura ging efficacy results and a manageable safet y 
profile, including low rates of all grade and severe CRS and NT events. This supports outpatient 
administration and toxicit y monitoring, wi th hospital admissio n upon symptom s of toxi city. 
Experi ence to date wi th JCAR017 in Study  017001 suggests that outpatient administration of 
JCAR017 can be provi ded safely  with appropri ate educati on and outpatient monitoring and can 
reduce the duration of inpatient hospital stays by 40% when co mpared to inpat ient administratio n 
(Maloney 2017 ). Thus, a safet y study  to assess the use of JCAR017 in nontertiary outpatient 
settings is designed to confirm these init ial findings.
2.1. Rationale for JCAR017 Dose Level
In Study  017001, JCAR017 at flat doses of 5 0×106CAR+ T cells and 1 00×106CAR+ T cells 
resul ted in durable responses and demonstrated an acceptable safet y profile in the third -line or 
greater treatment of R/R aggressive DLBCL. 
Addit ionally , as of  09 Oct 2017, a trend toward improved ORR at 3 month s was observed in 
patients treated at Dose Level 2 (1 00×106CAR T +cells) compared to Dose Level 1 
(50×106CAR + Tcells): 62% (16/26; 95% CI :41, 80) v ersus 48% (19/40; 95% CI :31, 64). 
Based on these results, the dose of 1 00×106CAR +T cells has been cho sen for development in 
the third -line setti ng. 
2.2. Rationale for Study Design
The purpose of this Phase 2 study  is to eval uate the safet y and efficacy of JCAR017 administered 
in nonterti ary care centers in adult subjects with R/R aggressive B -NHL (non-Hodgkin ’s 
lympho ma)who have failed at l east 2prior lines of therapy . There is no approved standard of 
care for this populat ion. A nonrando mized design was chosen because of the lack of effect ive 
therapi es in this popul ation (see Secti on1.1), leading to concerns about comparing against an 
ineffect ive therapy given the promising preliminary efficacy results in third -line subjects (see

likely  to be difficul t, given the lack of efficacy of cu rrently used regimens and the number of 
clinical studies ongo ing in this population. 
2.3. Rationale for Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
As noted in Section 1.5, preliminar y data available fro m subjects wi th R/R NHL in 
Study 017001 suggest that the low- intensit y lymphodepl eting chemotherapy regimen used, 
cyclophosphamide (300 m g/m2/day × 3 day s) combined with fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day × 
3days) in co mbinat ion with JCAR017 , has adequate safet y and good efficacy in subjects wi th 
R/R NHL. This lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy regimen was selected to limit toxicit y and retain 
efficacy , as well as to optimize cellular expansion and efficacy after treatm ent wi th JCAR017 . 
See the JCAR017 IBfor more informat ion. This same flu/cy dose is planned for the current 
017007 study . 
2.4. Rationale for Endpoints
The safet y to be assessed in this trial are standard assessments for oncology  clinical trials and are 
appropriate for monitoring the sa fety of patients in the study . Several  AEs of  special interest 
(AESIs) are defined for this study , including CRS, NT, prolonged cy topenia, Grade ≥ 3 
infect ions, m acrophage act ivation syndrome (MAS), tumor lysis syndro me (TLS), infusion 
reacti ons, hypogamma globulinemia , autoimmune di sorders, and second primary  malignancies
because these events have been ident ified as potential risks associated with JCAR017 treatm ent 
as well as other CAR T -celltherapies.
The efficacy endpo ints to be assessed in this study  are standard endpoints for the assessment of 
aggressive B -cell NHL. Di sease response will be determined according to the 
“Reco mmendat ions for Initial Evaluat ion, Staging, and Response Assessment of Hodgkin and 
Non-Hodgkin Lympho ma: The Lugano Classificatio n” (Cheson 2014 ). 
2.5. Risk/Benefit Summary
As di scussed in Sect ion 1.1, options for treatment of R/R DLBCL are limi ted and few patients 
respond to chemotherapy  in the thi rd-line setting and beyo nd. Preliminary data on JCAR017
treatm ent from the ongoing Juno Study  017001 show that treatment of this patient populat ion 
with JCAR017 demonstrates encouraging e fficacy  resul ts and a m anageable safet y profile, 
including low rates of all grade and severe CRS and NT events, which support outpatient 
administration and toxicit y monitoring. 
Cytokine release syndro me is characterized by high fever, fat igue, nausea, hea dache, dy spnea, 
tachy cardi a, rigors, hy potensi on, hypoxia, myalgia/arthralgia, and anorexia. Unique NT events 
have also been reported and may include neurologic symptoms such as altered mental status, 
aphasia, altered level o f consciousness, and seizures o r seizure- like act ivity. In Study  017001, 
these toxicit ies have generally  been f ound to be manageable and reversible. Guidance regarding 
management of other safet y events is provided in Secti on7. A detailed management algorithm 
for the assessment and treatment of signs of CRS and NT is provided in 
Experi ence wi th JCAR017 to date i n Study  017001 further suggest s that outpatient 
administration of JCAR017 can be provided safely with appropriate education and outpatient

this strategy  can reduce the duration of inpat ient hospital stays by 40% when co mpared to 
inpat ient administration (Maloney 2017 ). 
Thus, a safet y study  to assess the use of JCAR017 in nonterti ary outpati ent settings has been 
designed to confirm these init ial findings.
Overall, consi dering the poor prognosis in R/R subjects receiving third- line treatment and the 
potenti al for good responses wi th a manageable safety  profile wi th JCAR017 , the benefit/risk is 
considered to be posit ive in this populat ion treated in nontertiary  outpat ient settings.

4.1. Overall Study Design
This is an open -label, mult icenter, Phase 2 study to determine the safet y and efficacy of 
JCAR017 in subjects who have R/Raggressive B -cell NHL who will be treated in the outpatient 
setting . Subjects will be treated with JCAR017 after com pleting lymphodepl eting chemotherapy. 
There will be no control group for this study .
A total o f 114 subjects may be enrolled to ensure that approximately 80 subjects are treated with 
JCAR017, with a minimum of approximately 50 treated subjects monitored as an outpatient.
A schemat ic of treatm ent for each subject is provided in Figure 1. Subjects will underg o 
leukapheresis to collect peripheral blood mononuclear cells to enable JCAR017 product 
generat ion. Subjects who commence leukapheresis are considered enro lled on the day  of 
leukapheresis . While JCAR017 is being manufactured and if required to control disease, subjects 
may receive salvage low-dose chemotherapy  or1 cycle of noncurat ive standard -of-care 
antitumor therapy  as described in Sect ion 8.2.2 . 
Upon successful JCAR017 product generation, subjects will enter the treatment phase and will 
receive JCAR017 treatm ent. Treatm ent includes lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy wit h 
fludarabine/cyclophosphamide (flu/cy) fo llowed by  JCAR017 administration 2 to 7 days after 
completing lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy. 
After complet ion of JCAR017 treatm ent, subjects will enter post -treatment follow -up, and will  
be followed on this study  for 2 y ears f or safet y, disease status, healt h-related quali ty of life 
(HRQoL ), and survival, as described in more detail in Sect ion 8. After completion of 2 years of 
assessments in this protocol, long -term follow-up (LTFU) for survival, lo ng-term toxici ty, and 
viral vector safet y will cont inue under a separate protocol for up to 15 years after JCAR017
treatm ent.
Toxicit y will be evaluated on an ongoing basis by  the study  team  and reviewed at regularly  
scheduled Investi gator Safety  calls. Addit ionally, safet y monitoring boundaries based on the 
incidence of Grade 3 or above JCAR017 -related adverse events of special interest (AESI) will be 
established using a Bayesian framework (Thall 1994 )as described in Section10.3.5.4 and the 
statist ical analysis plan .If the safet y boundaries are crossed, enrollment will be paused and an ad 
hocSRC will meet to review the data. The study will remain paused for enrollment pending the 
SRC’s recommendat ions.

The end o f the study  is defined as the date of the last scheduled assessment shown in the 
Schedule of Evaluations for the last subject in the trial.
4.4. Study Oversight
A Safet y Review Committee (SRC), comprised of Principal Invest igators and the Sponsor’s 
medical mo nitor, safety phys ician, andstatistician,will regularly assess the safet y of JCAR017
administration throughout the trial. The SRC may  make recommendat ions based on safet y.
4.5. Suspension or Early Termination of the Study
The study  can be suspended or terminated at any  time bythe Spon sor, the FDA, or at the 
recommendat ion of the Invest igational Review Board ( IRB) . Circumstances that may warrant 
suspension or terminat ion include, but are not limit ed to:
Determinat ion of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects
Dem onstrati on of  efficacy  that woul d warrant stopping
Determinat ion that the primary  endpoint has been met 
Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements
Data that are not sufficient ly complete and/or evaluable
If the study  is suspended or terminated f or safet y reasons, the Sponsor will prompt ly inform  the 
Invest igator, and will also inform the regulatory authorities of the suspension or terminat ion of 
the study  and the reasons for the action. The Investigator may be informed of addit ional 
procedures to be followed in order to ensure adequate protection of subjects. The Investigator 
will be responsible for promptly informing the IRB, other applicable regulatory  committees, and 
study  subjects of the suspensio n or early terminat ion of the trial, including the reasons for 
suspension or terminat ion and any other regulatory committee, as applicable.
The study  may resume once concerns about safety , protocol  com pliance, and data qualit y are 
addressed to the satisfact ion of the Sponsor, IRB, and/or FDA .

JCAR017 will be encouraged to continue all study  evaluat ions through t he End -of-Study  (EOS) 
visit as well as participate in the LTFU study . The Sponsor must be notified if a subject has 
withdrawn consent from  the study  or has requested to discont inue treatment, and the reason(s) 
must be documented. 
5.3.1. Screen Failures
Screening failures are defined as subjects who consent to participate in the clinical study  but are 
not subsequently enro lled in the study  (Enrollment  is described in Sect ion 8.2.1 ). A minimal set 
of screen failure information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure subjects 
to meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials publishing requirements and to respond 
to queries from regulatory  authori ties. Minimal inform ation includes dem ography , eligibili ty 
criteria assessment, and any protocol procedure -related serious adverse event (SAE).
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study  (screen failure) m ay be 
rescreene d with a new subject number.

6. STUDY TREATMENTS
6.1. Leukapheresis
Following enro llment on the study , a leukapheresis collect ion will be performed on each subject 
to obtain a sufficient quant ity of peripheral  blood m ononuclear cells (PBMCs) for the production 
of the JCAR017 invest igational p roduct. Shoul d a technical issue arise during the procedure or in 
the processing o f the product such that it cannot be used for JCAR017 administration, the subject 
may have subsequent collect ion procedure(s) performed. Subjects must con tinue to m eet 
eligib ility requi rements for repeat l eukapheresis; see Section 8.2.3.1 for informat ion about 
assessments that do not need to be repeated for addit ional ap heresis.
Please refer to the PBMC collect ion manual for further details.
6.2. Anticancer Treatments between Leukapheresis and 
Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
If necessary, ant icancer treatment is allowed for disease control while JCAR017 is being 
produced (ie, aft er leukapheresis and prior to lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy). Low dose 
chemotherapy (eg, vincristine, rituximab, cy clophosphamide ≤ 300 mg/m2) isallowed if 
completed at l east 7days prior to the start of lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy. If other agents are 
used, the washout periods noted in the exclusio n criteria (see Section 5.2) must be m et. The use 
of therapeuti c agents wi th little/no evi dence in the scientific literature for DLBCL should be 
discussed wi th the Sponsor. Local  radiation is allo wed to a single lesio n or subset of lesio ns if 
other un -irradiated PET -positive lympho ma lesio ns are present. If ant icancer treatment is 
necessary  during this time , the pretreatm ent PET and computed tomography ( CT)assessments 
and other pretreatment study  procedures (see Section 8.2.4) m ust be performed after the 
anticancer treatment has been completed. The subject must continue to have PET
-posit ive 
disease and meet eligibilit y criteria pertaining to adequate organ funct ion, active infections, 
pregnancy, and washout of prior therapy  before initi ation of lymphodepl eting chemotherapy.
6.3. JCAR017 Investigational Drug Product
The JCAR017 invest igational drug product is co mprised of autol ogous CD8+ and CD4+ T cells 
that express a CD19- specific CAR that are provided as frozen cell suspensio ns for intravenous 
(IV) administration. The JCAR017 invest igational drug product is provide d as 2 individually  
formulated CD4+CAR+ and CD8+CAR+ T-cell suspensio ns in media containing DMSO for 
direct IV administration in equal CAR T -cell quantit ies into the subject.
The CD19 -specific CAR is introduced into autologous CD8+ and CD4+ T cells ex vivo using a 
replicat ion-incompetent, self -inactivating lent iviral vector. The CD19 -specific CAR consists of 
an scFv binding do main derived fro m a murine CD19 -specific mo noclonal  antibody  (FMC63) 
and the 4- 1BB and CD3ζ chain signaling do mains.

6.3.1. Protocol Product Deviation Plan 
The JCAR017 Protocol Product Deviat ion Plan (PPDP) addresses the use of non -conforming 
investigat ional product in global clinical trials. The JCAR017 PPDP defines an assessment and 
decisio n-making process that permit s release to the invest igator and clinical site of drug product 
that does not meet the specificat ion for certain non-s afety related attributes (non -conforming 
JCAR017). In this process, the Celgene Medical Monitor and the Primary  Invest igator at the 
clinical site agree that the health o f the subject and the risk/benefit profile is acceptable for the 
subject to receive tre atment with the non -conforming invest igational product. Development 
Qualit y Assurance then assesses the recommendat ion and is ult imately responsible for the drug 
product lot disposit ion. The JCAR017 PPDP is a standalo ne docum ent.
6.3.2. Exception Use of Non -confo rming Product
Once a decisio n is made for the except ion use of non -conforming JCAR017, country  specific
requi rements will be fo llowed for the rel ease of a non -conforming JCAR017 product to treat a 
subject enrolled in a JCAR017 clinical trial. For example, approval  from local health authori ties 
and/or IRBs/ECs will be obtained where required. Any subject will need to provide consent by  
signing the si te’s IRB approved non -conforming product ICF prior to receiving the non -
conforming JCAR017 product. While subj ects treated wi th non-conforming product will be 
followed as per the Table of Events ( Appendix A ) listed in the protocol, their data will be 
excluded fro m the primary  safety/efficacy evaluable analysis. Their data will be analy zed 
separately  (Secti on 10.2.4 ). 
Subjects treated with non -conforming product will be replaced for the purposes of study  
enrollment of per protocol evaluable subjects.
6.3.3. Dose and Schedule
The dose of JCAR017 will be 100×106CAR+ T cells. JCAR017 will be administered 2 to 7 days 
after completion of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, described in Section 8.2.5.2 . Subjects mus t 
meet the criteria for treatment specified in Sect ion8.2.5.3 .
6.3.4. Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
Subject eligibilit y criteria must be confi rmed immedi ately pri or to starting the first cy cle of 
lymphodepl eting chemotherapy (see Sect ion8.2.5.1 ). The l ast dose of lymphodeplet ing 
chemotherapy must be admin istered 2 to 7 days before JCAR017 administration.
Subjects will be treated with fludarabine (30 mg/m2/day for 3 day s) plus cycl ophosphamide 
(300 mg/m2/day for 3 days) prior to treatment with JCAR017. The fludarabine dose should be 
reduced based on renal f unction. See Section 8.2.5 for the recommended schedule of 
administration and for the assessments that will be performed during lymphodeplet ing 
chemotherapy. Refer to the most recent package inserts for further details on administration of 
these agents.

6.3.6. JCAR017 Preparation and Cell Thawing
See the JCAR017 Product Administration Manual for details.
6.3.7. JCAR017 Administration
JCAR017 may  be delivered in an outpatient setting at the Invest igator’s discreti on. This setting is 
not recommended for the fo llowing subjects:
Subjects who do not have adequate caregiver support
Subjects who are staying greater than 60 minutes from the clinical trial site at the time 
of treatm ent.
Each JCAR017 dose consists o f CD4+ CAR+ T cells and CD8+ CAR+ T cells, administered 
separately  via IV. The subject m ust be continuously  monitored during each IV administration of 
JCAR017. Vital signs (temperature, respiratory  rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and SaO 2by 
pulse oximet ry) will be measured wit hin 15 minutes prior to, and within approximately 15 
minutes after the last IV administration, and then approximately  every 15 minutes thereafter for 
the first hour, and hourly for the next 2 hours. If the subject’s vital signs are not stabl e 4 hours 
following the final IV administration, vital signs should be monitored as clinically indicated until 
stable. 
Each T -cell suspensio n (CD8+ cells or CD4+ cells) must be thawed and the labeled dose vo lume 
administered into the subject with in the specified expiration t ime after removal fro m shipping 
container or liquid ni trogen (LN2) freezer (if storing product on -site). If JCAR017 has been 
outsi de of  the shipping container or LN2 freezer for longer than 2 hours , the product should be 
withheld,and the Sponsor study  team  immediately notified.

Acute infusio n reactions may occur with administration of JCAR017. Guidelines for the 
treatm ent of acute infusio n react ions are provided in Section 7.7.
6.4. Recommended Supportive Care, Additional Treatment, and 
Monitoring
Prophylactic treatment/measures are strongly recom mended for subjects at risk for TLS , per 
institutional or clinical  standards. Supportive care for the management of CRS is detailed i n 
 In som e cases, tocilizumab, an anti -IL-
6R-antibody , may be requi red to treat 
toxicities such as severe cy tokine release syndrome ( sCRS ).  Please refer to currently approved 
RoActem ra® Summary  of Product Characteristics ( RoActemra SmPC, 2015). It is important to 
understand that the JCAR017 Management Guideli nes f orCytokine Release Syndro me and 
Neurotoxi city and the recommended use of tocilizumab is different from the CRS management 
algorithms for the approved CAR Ts. The Sponsor requires that all JCAR017 sites must have at 
least 2 doses of tocilizumab available prior to infusio n for each subject in the init ial 30 -day post -
JCAR017 infusio n peri od. If site utilizes more than one pharmacy facilit y, 2 doses of tocilizumab
per subject are required in each pharmacy  facility. It is recommended to resupply in case 
tocilizumab is given.
The preferred dose to intervene in subjects with sCRS is 8 mg/kg. Other anti -IL-6 antagonist 
shoul d be considered in the event of sCRS not resp onding to tocilizumab. Dosing of any other 
anti-IL-6 agent should be per prescribing informat ion.
Prophylactic treatment measures for neurological toxicit ies are detailed in 
The use of red blood cells and platelet t ransfusio ns, and/or colony -stimulat ing factors is 
permitted per inst itutional or clinical standards. 
The use of prophylact ic or empiric ant i-infective agents (eg, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazo le for 
pneumocyst is pneumonia prophylaxis [PJP] , broad spectrum a ntibiotics, antifungals, or antiviral 
agents for febrile neutropenia) is permitted per institut ional standards.
Hospitalization may be required after treatment with JCAR017 to manage any  treatm ent-
associ ated toxi cities. Subjects who do not have adequate su
pport outside of the hospital or do not 
meet outpati ent m onitoring guidelines as per Section 8.2.5.5 shoul d be consi dered f or

7. POTENTIAL RISKS AND MANAGEMENT OF TOXICI TIES 
A summary  of management of potential treatment toxicit y is provided below.  See th e JCAR017
IB for a complete discussio n of potenti al risks associ ated wi th JCAR017 .Cytokine rel ease 
syndro me (CRS) and neuro toxicity(NT) are associated with CAR T -cell therapies. Celgene has 
developed specific toxicit y management guidelines (TMG) for CRS and NT associated with 
Celgene cellular products based on current clinical experience across the clinical development 
programs  These reco mme ndations are based on the CRS revised grading system 
(Lee, 2014 ) and the CTCAE and need to be used for grading of CRS and NT to guide 
management in thistrial. 
If available and adopted as per site standard practice, CRS and N T grading according to the 
American Societ y for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy  (ASTCT) Consensus Grading 
System  (Lee, 2019 ) shoul d also be recorded in the e CRF to i nform  future m odificati ons of  the 
management guidelines.
7.1. Cytokine Release Syndrome 
Administrati on of  CAR T cells, such as JCAR017 , is associated with CRS. Cytokine release 
syndro me is characterized by high fever, fat igue, nausea, headache, dyspnea, tachycardia, rigors, 
hypotension, hypoxia, myalgia/arthralgia, and anorexia. Clinical symptoms and severit y of CRS

Confident ial and Propri etary 43 Protocol 017007 Amendment 2.0: 17 Mar 2020are highly variable ( Lee 2 014), and m anagement can be complicated by  concurrent condi tions. 
With JCAR017 , CRS usually occurs within 2 weeks after infusio n (Abramson 2017 ).
Fever, especially  high f ever ( ≥38.5°C or ≥101.3 °F), is a commo nly-observed 
hallmark of CRS, and many  features of CRS mimic infection. Hence, infect ion must 
be considered in all subjects presenting wit h CRS symptoms and appropriate cultures 
must be obtained and empiric ant ibiotic therapy initiated per inst itution standard of 
care.
Less commo n symptom s associ ated wi th CRS include cardiac dysfunct ion, adul t 
respi ratory  distress syndrome, renal and/or hepatic failure, coagulopathies, 
disseminated intravascular coagulation, and capillary  leak syndrom e. 
Neurotoxi cityhas been observed con current ly wit h CRS.
CRS has been reported in a few cases to be associated with findings of 
MAS /hemophag ocytic lymphohist iocytosis ( HLH), and the physio logy of the 
syndro mes may overlap.
Please refer to for a detailed description of CRS, grading, and treatment 
recommendat ions.If available and adopted as per site standard practice, CRS and neurological 
toxicity (NT) grading according to the ASTCT Consensus Grading System ( Lee, 2019 ) should 
also be recorded in the eCRF to inform future modificat ions of the management guidelines.
7.2. Fever
The possibilit y of CRS shoul d be considered for all subjects with fever (≥38.0ºCor ≥100.4 ºF) 
following JCAR017 treatment. Subjects should be mo nitored cl osely  for hem odynamic 
instabilit y and changing neuro logic status. Febrile subjects, neutropenic or otherwise, shoul d be 
evaluated promptly andmanaged per inst itutional or standard c linical practice. 
The possibilit y of CRS shoul d be considered for all subjects with fever fo llowing JCAR017
infusio n. Subjects should be monitored closely for hemodynamic instabilit y and changing 
neuro logic status.
7.3. Neurologic Toxicities
CAR T -cell therapy is associated with unique neurologic toxicit ies. Neurol ogic symptoms may 
include altered mental status, aphasia, altered level of consciousness, and seizures or seizure -like 
activit y. With JCAR017 to date, the start of neurologic symptoms has been noted b etween 3 to 
23 day s (median 10 days) ( Abramson 2017 ) after CAR T -cell infusio n and, in severe cases, may  
requi re admissio n to the ICU for frequent monitoring, respiratory  support, or intubat ion for 
airway protecti on. The sympt oms are variable and generally  occur as CRS i s reso lving or after 
CRS resolut ion.
Please refer to for detailed descript ions of neuro logic toxi cities, grading, and 
treatm ent recommendat ions. Note: Tocilizumab is not indicated for the treatment of neuro logic 
toxicities.

Confident ial and Propri etary 44 Protocol 017007 Amendment 2.0: 17 Mar 20207.4. Macrophage Activation Syndrome
Macrophage activation syndro me is a serious disorder potentially associated with uncontrolled 
activat ion and proliferat ion of CAR T cells and subsequent activation of macrophages (See the 
JCAR017 IB for further background about MAS). Macrophage activat ion syndrome is t ypically 
characterized by  high -grade, n on-remitt ing fever, cytopenias, and hepatospleno megaly. 
Laboratory  abnorm alities found in MAS include elevated inflammatory  cytokine levels, serum 
ferritin, soluble IL -2 receptor (sCD25), triglycerides, and decreased circulat ing NK cells. Other 
findings in clude variable levels of transaminases, signs of acute liver failure, coagulopathy , and 
disseminated intravascular coagulopathy . There are no definit ive diagnost ic criteria for MAS; it 
is typically diagnosed using published criteria for hemophagocyt ic lymp hohist iocytosis 
(Schulert, 2015). While there is considerable overlap in clinical manifestations and laboratory  
findings between MAS and CRS, other dist inguishing MAS physical findings such as 
hepatospl enomegaly and lymphaden opathy  are not comm on in adul t subjects treated wi th 
activated T cell therapies.
Subjects treated with JCAR017 should be monitored for MAS, and cytokine -directed therapy  
shoul d be considered as clinically  indicated .
7.5. Infusion Reactions
Administrati on of  JCAR017 m ay cause infusio n reactions, including fever, rigors, rash, urticaria, 
dyspnea, hypotension, and/or nausea. To minimize the risk of infusio n reactions, all subjects 
shoul d be prem edicated wi th acetaminophen and diphenhydramine. In case a subject cann ot 
tolerate di phenhydramine, an equivalent ant ihistamine may be substituted. Mild infusio n 
reacti ons shoul d be managed expectant ly wit h ant ipyretics, ant ihistamines, and ant iemetics. 
Corti costeroi ds shoul d be avoi ded because o f the potenti al impact on effi cacy o f infused 
JCAR017 cells. Rigors may be treated with meperidine.
The fo llowing gui delines shoul d be f ollowed for infusio n reactions:
Grade 1: administer symptomat ic treatment; continue JCAR017 administration both 
CD8+CAR+ and CD4+CAR+ co mponents at th e sam e dose and rate
Grade 2: stop administration of JCAR017; administer symptomatic treatment; resume 
JCAR017 administration of both CD8+CAR+ and CD4+CAR+ components at a reduced rate

Confident ial and Propri etary 45 Protocol 017007 Amendment 2.0: 17 Mar 20207.6. Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Both the lympho depleting chemotherapy emplo yed in this protocol and JCAR017 therapy  have 
caused TLS in adult B -NHL subjects with high disease burden. Subjects should be closely 
monitored for l aboratory  evidence of TLS (hyperuricemia, hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, 
and hypocalcemia), and subjects at high risk for developing TLS, such as those with high disease 
burden and high cell turnover, should receive prophylact ic treatment, including administration of 
allopurino l, rasburi case or equivalent ,and hydration, per standa rd clinical pract ice. 
7.7. B-cell Aplasia
B-cell aplasia is an expected potential o ff-tumor, on -target toxi city. Prol onged B -cell aplasia has 
been observed in other CD19- directed CAR T cell programs ( Davila, 2014; Grupp, 2013 ). Serum
immunogl obulin levels will be obtained fro m all subjects prior to and at various timepo ints 
following JCAR017 infusio n. Hy pogammaglo bulinemic subjects (serum IgG < 500 mg/dL) 
shoul d be considered for IV immunoglobulin replacement therapy  per inst itutional guidelines. 
7.8. Cytopenias
Severe (Grade ≥ 3) cy topeni as including anemia, leukopenia, neutropenia, and 
thrombocy topenia, can occur wi th JCAR017 andlymphodepl eting chemotherapy and delayed 
recovery  has been observed. Complete blood counts (CBCs) should be monitored after JCAR017
infusio nsuntil count recovery . Foll ow insti tu
tional gui delines in the event of Grade ≥ 3 
cytopeni as. 
7.9. Infections
Life-threatening and fatal infect ions have been observed. Severe infect ions m ay include 
bacteri al, fungal  (including pneumocystis jirovecii ), and viral infections (eg, CMV, HBV, 
respi ratory  viruses, and other viruses). A high index of suspicion is warrante d in the event of 
prolonged or recurrent cy topenias, especially  in conjunct ion with hypogammagl obuline mia, 
severe lymphopenia, and/or recent use of corticosteroids. Viral reactivation and other serious 
opportunist ic infect ions should be considered in these settings, and prophylactic, pre -empt ive, or 
symptom atic treatment with antimicrobial, ant ifungal, ant i-pneum ocyst ic, and/or antiviral 
therapi es shoul d be considered per l ocal institutional guidelines.
7.10. Graft -versus -host Disease
The likelihood of GVHD occur ring with CAR T -cell therapy  is low, and while i t rem ains a 
theoreti cal risk, i t does not apply to patients enrolled in this protocol (exclusio n criteria #2, 8). 
See the JCAR 017 IB for further details. 
7.11. Uncontrolled T Cell Proliferation
JCAR017 could theor etically proliferate out of control. If uncontrolled JCAR017 T-cell 
proliferat ion occurs, subjects may be treated with high -dose st eroids (eg, methylpredniso lone 1 
to 3g/kg/day, tapered over 1 week) or lymphodepleting doses of cyclophosphamide (1 to 3 g/m2
IV). If an Invest igator suspects uncontrolled proliferation of JCAR017 -transfected cells, the 
Sponsor should be contacted immediately.

Confident ial and Propri etary 46 Protocol 017007 Amendment 2.0: 17 Mar 20207.12. Replication -competent Lentivirus, Clonality, and Insertional 
Oncogenesis 
Lentiviral vectors used in gene transfer are engineered to be replicat ion-defect ive; however, 
generat ion of replication -competent lent iviruses (RCL) during manufacturing is st ill a 
possibilit y. Modern vector production systems have been improved to reduce the risk of RCL 
generat ion. To date, there have been no reports of RCL generated during lentiviral vector 
manufacturing, which may be due in part, to the use of self- inact ivating vectors such as the 
lentiviral vector used in the production of JCAR017 (Rothe 2013 ).
Concerns for possible vector integration into the host genome have arisen due to preclinical 
studi es that have shown retrovirus -mediated malignant tr ansformat ion in mice (Li 2002 ,Modlich
2005) and monkeys (Donahue 1992 ), and a single clinical study  reporting development of 
leukem ia in subjects wi th X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency who received retroviral -
modified CD34+ hematopoiet ic stem cells (Hacein -Bey-Abina 2003 ), including 1 subject who 
died (Couzin 2005) . Of note, no instances of RCL generat ion during production or lent ivirus -
mediated m alignant transformation in animals or humans have been reported to date.
Data has recent ly been published on the integration sites o f retroviral and lent iviral vectors used 
for T-cell modificat ion in clinical trials (Wang 2009, Scholler 2012 , McGarrit y 2013) . No 
clonali ty of integrati on si tes was observed. In addi tion, there di d not appear to be enrichment of 
integrat ion sites near genes invo lved in clo nal expansio n or persistence.
Per the FDA Reco mbinant DNA Advisory Co mmittee guidelines (FDA 2000 ), all subjects will 
be followed in this study  for RCL and vector sequences for up to 15 years fo llowing JCAR017
treatm ent as part of a LTFU protocol. All subjects will be mo nitored f or evi dence o f unexpected 
JCAR017 expansi on and the em ergence of a new second primary malignancy (SPM) , 
particularly one of T-cell origin. Invest igators must con tact the Sponsor immediately if an 
unexpected pattern of JCAR017 expansio n and/or a new SPM arises. 
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be reported as 
serious adverse events. This includes any  new malignancies, regardless of causal relationship to 
JCAR017, occurring throughout the subject’s ent ire par ticipati on in the study . If a subject 
develops a new malignancy, the Sponsor will request that a tumor sample, and blood samples are 
collected (see 017001 laboratory  manual ).See Secti on8.3.12 .
7.13. Risks Associated with Lymphodepleting Chemotherapy
Subjects will receive fludarabine and cyclophosphamide prior to treatment with 
JCAR017 to 
facilitate lymphodeplet ion and CAR T -cell engraftm ent. Refer to the local package inserts for 
specific details surrounding the risks of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide.

Confident ial and Propri etary 47 Protocol 017007 Amendment 2.0: 17 Mar 20208.1. Schedule of Evaluations
There are 3 parts to this study : pretreatm ent, treatment, and post -treatment. 
Pretreatment includes screening, leukapheresis, and pretreatment evaluat ion, and begins with 
assessing subject eligibilit y for study  enro llment. If eligible, the subject will undergo 
leukapheresis as soon as possible , followed by  pretreatm ent evaluat ion prior to lymphodeplet ing 
chemotherapy and JCAR017 administration. If needed, subjects may receive treatment between 
leukapheresis and lymphodeplet ion as described in Section 8.2.2 .
All subjects will receive lymphodeplet ing chemotherapy prior to JCAR017 . All subjects will  be 
assessed for response at approximately Day 29.
Post-treatm ent includes safet y and disease fo llow-up visits at approximately 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 
and 24 m onths after receiving JCAR017 . The Month -24 vi sit will be the EOS vi sit.
8.2. Study Visits
8.2.1. Screening (Approximately 1 to 2 Weeks Prior to Leukapheresis) 
The screening process begins when the subject signs the IRB- approved informed consent 
docum ent and c ontinues unt il the subject is determined to be eligible and the subject is enro lled, 
or until screen failure is determined. If a subject has had a screening procedure as standard of 
care wi thin 30 days of consent, it may  be used to evaluate study  eligibili ty. 
The fo llowing assessments will be performed during screening:
Obtain informed consent (obtained any time before study -related procedures are 
perform ed).
Assess eligibilit y per inclusio n/exclusio n criteria. All  inclusi on/exclusio n criteria 
must be met in order for subjects to continue in the study. 
Obtain medical history , including: disease diagnosis and history , HSCT history , 
chemotherapy, radiat ion and surgical history . If applicable, report/record history  of 
toxicities related to prior treatments an d allergies.
ECOG performance status assessment (see
Physical examinat ion (see Section 8.3.2 )
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG)
ECHO or MUGA scan
Local  laboratory  assessments (see Section 8.3.7 ):

8.2.2. Optional Bridging Therapy for Disease Control Prior to Lymphodepleting 
Chemotherapy
Subjects m ay undergo an opti onal cycle of salvage l ow-dose chemotherapy (eg, vincrist ine, 
rituximab, cyclophosphamide ≤ 300 m g/m2) or noncurat ive standard -of-care chem otherapy for
disease control  prior to l eukapheresis and/or while JCAR017 is being manufactured (ie, between 
leukapheresis and lymphodeplet ing ch emotherapy ). Exam ples of acceptable regimens include:
Bendamust ine plus rituximab (BR)
Rituximab, cy clophosphamide, etoposi de, procarbazine, and prednisone (R -CEPP)
Rituximab, cy clophosphamide, epi rubicin, and prednisone (R -CEOP)
Rituximab, gem citabine, ci splat in, and dexamethasone (R -GDP)
Rituximab and l enalido mide
Other regimens may be acceptable after discussio n with the Sponsor. 
Any selected regimen should be administered per inst itutional guidelines. Chemotherapy given 
after leukapheresis to m aintain disease control  must be stopped ≥ 7 day s prior to 
lymphodepl eting chemotherapy, and the washout periods noted in the exclusio n criteria (see 
Secti on 8.2.3 ) must be m et. The use of therapeutic agents with litt le/no evidence in the scient ific 
literature for DLBCL should be discussed wit h the Sponsor. If clinically indicated, local 
radiation is allowed to a single lesio n or subset of lesio ns if other un -irradiated PET -posit ive 
lympho ma lesions are present.
If bridging ant icancer treatment is given, subjects must continue to meet eligibilit y criteria 
pertaining to adequate organ funct ion, active infectio ns, pregnancy , washout of pri or therapy  
prior to lymphodeplet ion, and PET -avid disease. If the subject has not had any cardiotoxic 
medicat ions or radi otherapy  in which fields include the heart, screening assessments of cardiac 
funct ion (MUGA/ECHO) do not need to be repeated. The pretreatment evaluat ions in 
Secti on8.2.4 noted as required after any intervening anticancer therapy must be repeat ed. 
If lymphodepl eting chemotherapy is delayed more than 14 days due to recovery fro m anticancer 
treatm ent, the subject must repeat eligibilit y assessments (some procedures may not be required 
after di scussio n with the Sponsor).

All subjects who ei ther com plete the post -treatm ent follow-up peri od specified in this protocol or 
who prematurely withdraw after a dose of JCAR017 will be asked to enroll in the LTFU protocol 
at the EOS visit or at the time of withdrawal, respectively. A separate informed consent form will 
be provided for the LTFU protocol. Subjects who discontinue early  from this study  and do not 
consent to pa rticipate in the LTFU protocol will be followed for survival through public record
until their projected end of study visit .
8.2.11. Second Primary Malignancies Follow -upPeriod
Second primary malignancies will be monitored as events of interest and must be report ed as 
serious adverse events. This includes any  new malignancies, regardless of causal relationship to 
JCAR017 , occurring throughout the subject’s ent ire participation in the study . If a subject 
develops a second primary malignancy, the Sponsor will reques t that a tumor sample (refer to 
017007 laboratory  manual ) and bl ood sam ples are collected (See also Section 8.3.12.2 and
Secti on8.3.12.6 ).
8.3. Study Assessments
All study  assessments should be performed at the times indicated in the Schedule of Evaluat ions 
in Appendix A.
8.3.1. Efficacy Assessments 
Treatment response will be assessed by radiographic tumor evaluat ion at protocol -specified 
timepo ints by diagnostic qualit y (with contrast) CT scans (chest, neck, abdomen, and pelvis) and 
PET scans. PET scans are not required after a subject achieves a CR unless progression is 
suspected on fo llow-up CT. Confirmat ion of PD and assessment of bone marrow invo lvement by 
lympho ma will be by PET scan only; bone marrow aspirates and biopsies will not be required for 
assessment of disease response. Upon documentati on of disease progression or treatment with 
additional anticancer therapies, radiographic tumor evaluat ion is no longer required (Note, PET 
and CT scans will be read locally). Disease response will be determined according to the 
“Reco mmendat ions for Initial Evaluat ion, Staging, and Response Assessment of Hodgkin and 
Non-Hodgkin Lympho ma: The Lugano Classificatio n” (Cheson 2014 )as described in 
aswell as other pertinen t clinical data, as appropriate.

8.3.3. Routine Neurolog ical and Mini -Mental State Examinations
A routine neurological exam shoul d include, at minimum, a physical exam to assess cranial 
nerves, motor and sensory  skills, coordinat ion and balance (see  In the event a 
subject experiences neurotoxicit y, a Mini Mental State Examinat ion (MMSE) should be done at 
time of onset of neurotoxicit y and then daily  until resol ution of  symptom s, unless the subject is 
medically incapacitated and/or medically unable to complete the MMSE. The MMSE may be 
administered by  an appropri ately trained provi der ( ie, physician, nurse); a neurologist is not 
requi red. Efforts should be made to have the same provider perform the MMSE on a given 
subject to maintain consistency of assessment.
8.3.4. Vital Signs
Vital signs include temperature, respiratory  rate, heart rate, blood pressure, and SaO 2by pulse 
oxime try.
In addit ion, subjects will be required to monitor their body  temperature at home and record it in a

8.3.12.1. Pharmacokinetic Assessments
JCAR017 PK in blood (and bone marrow, when available) will be assessed by qPCR .
8.3.12.2. Viral Vector Sequence Testing
Details regarding sample collection and processing are provided in the 0170 07 laboratory  
manual. The presence of vector sequences will be determined by evaluat ion of blood samples for 
the JCAR017 transgene by qPCR. If more than 1% of cells in test samples collected at the Month 
12 visit or later test posit ive for vector sequences , the pattern of vector integration sites will be 
analyzed. If a predominant integration site is detected, then the subject will be asked to provide 
another blood draw 3 months later for fo llow-up testing.
If a subject develops disease recurrence or a SPM ,the Sponsor will request a sample of the 
neopl astic ti ssue (see 017007 laboratory  manual), and an unscheduled peripheral blood draw for 
RCL and viral vector sequence testing (see also Section 8.2.11 ).
8.3.12.3. Pharmacodynamic Assessments
Peripheral  blood B-cell counts will be assessed to determine how JCAR017 impacts normal 
CD19+ B cells. In addit ion, levels of serum immunoglobulins will be monitored as another 
method to determine how normal B cells respond to treatment.
8.3.12.4. Biomarker Assessments
Biomarker assessments may be performed to evaluate JCAR017 , tum or, and immune system

Cytokines and chemokines may be measured i n serum , plasma, and CSF (as available) as 
markers of immune act ivation. Potenti al correl ations between cy tokine/chemokine production 
and efficacy  and severi ty of CRS and NT will be assessed. 
Immunoregul atory  pathways operati ve in the tum or microenvironme nt may influence the fate 
and function of adoptively transferred JCAR017 T cells. If a tumor biopsy  is being obtained for 
clinical purposes and there is available tissue, assessment of specific cellular elements within the 
tumor and the tum or microenvironm ent will  be perform ed on bi opsy  samples to correl ate the 
presence of these factors with response, duration of response and/or JCAR017 persistence and 
funct ion. This will include evaluat ion of JCAR017 infiltration and prevalence, markers of 
JCAR017 phenoty pe and funct ion, and location o f JCAR017 relative to CD19+ tumor cells . 
Immunosuppressive bio markers on other cell t ypes in the tumor microenvironment may also be 
assessed.
Flow cy tometrywill be performed to characterize the expansion and persistence of JCAR017
CAR T -cellsubsets and to enumerate immune cell subsets in the blood, and if applicable, bone 
marrow and CSF. Analyses to detect tumor cells in peripheral blood and to analyze tumor cells 
by flow cy tometry may also be performed. These studi es aim  to identify cellular markers 
associ ated wi th JCAR017 persistence as well as safet y and efficacy . 
Molecular profiling assessments, including single nucleotide po lymo rphism (SNP), ATACseq, 
AbSeq, targeted mutational analysis, who le exo me/geno me sequencing, a nd/or gene expression

shoul d, whenever possible, complete the questionnaires at the init iation of study  visit, pri or to 
any procedure or clinical evaluat ion. For subjects that do not complete the questionnaire at any 
given timepo int, reason for not collecting will be recorded (eg, too sick/unable to complete, 
administration error, subject refusal). 
If the subject withdraws from the study  prem aturely , all attem pts shoul d be made to obtain final 
qualit y-of-life questionnaires prior to subject discont inuat ion.
8.3.13.1. EORTC QLQ -C30
The EORTC QLQ -C30 i s a 30 -item scale co mposed of both mult i-item scales and single -item 
measures. All o f the scales and single -item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A higher scale 
score represents a higher level of well- being and better abilit y of daily  functioning. Thus, a high 
score for a funct ional scale represents a high/healt hy level  of functioning; a high score for the 
global heal th status/HRQoL represents a high HRQoL, but a high score for a symptom scale/item 
represents a high level o f symptom atic problem.

9.1. Definitions
9.1.1. Adverse Event
In accordance with the Internat ional Council for Harmonisat ion (ICH) E2A guideline, and 
21Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) §312.32, an AE is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence in a clinical study  subject administered a pharmaceut ical product which does not 
necessarily have a causal relat ionship wi th this trea tment.
9.1.2. Serious Adverse Event
An SAE is defined as an event that, at any  dose, meets any  of the cri teria in Table 5. Special 
considerations for SAE reporting are presented in Table 6.
Table 5: Definitions of Serious Adverse Events
Criteria Description
Fatal: The AE resulted in death
Life-threatening: The AE placed the subject at immediate risk of death (This classification does 
not apply to an AE that hypothetically might have caused death if it had been 
more severe).
Hospitalization/prolongation of 
Hospitalization:The AE resulted in hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization (See 
Table 6below).
Disability/incapacity: The AE resulted in a disability, significant incapacity, or substantial disruption 
of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions
Congenital Anomaly/birth 
Defect:The AE was an adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a sub ject exposed to the 
study treatment regimen before conception or during pregnancy
Medically Important : The AE was a medically important event that did not meet any of the above 
criteria, but may have jeopardized the subject and may have required medical 
or surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed above (examples 
include allergic bronchospasm that required treatment in an emergency room, 
seizures that do not result in hospitalization, or blood dyscrasias)

9.1.3. Adverse Events of Special Interest
An AESI (serious or nonserious) is one of scient ific and medical concern specific to the 
Sponsor’s product, for which ongo ing monitoring and rapid co mmunicat ion by the Invest igator 
to the Sponsor can be appropri ate. Such an event might warrant further invest igation in order to 
characterize and understand it.
Adverse events of special interest may include, but are not limited to ,CRS, NT, prolonged 
cytopeni a,Grade ≥ 3infect ions, TLS, MAS, infusion reacti ons, hypogammaglo bulinemia ,
autoimmune disorders, and second primary malignancies (see for CRS/NT). These 
events have been ident ified as potential risks associated with JCAR017 treatm ent as well as other 
CAR T -cell t herapies. Details of the AESIs definit ions are provided in the SAP.
Prolonged cy topeni a(laboratory  values), is define d as the occurrence of Grade ≥ 3 cytopeni a not
resolved by  theDay 29 visit, based on l aboratory  resul ts of low hem oglobin, absol ute neutrophil 
count decreased, and platelet count decreased . The frequency of subjects experiencing each 
individual laboratory  abnorm ality and the total  number wi th at least1abnormalit y will  be 
summarized, as will recovery  from prolonged cy topenia after Day 29. 
9.1.3.1. Grading and Intensity of Adverse Events
Adverse events, with the except ion of CRS, will be graded using the CTCAE, Version 4.03
(https://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applicat ions/ctc.ht m
). CRS will be 
graded according to the grading scale adapted from Lee (Lee 2014) ,  
The reported verbat im term should be the most descript ive medical diagnosis , even if it does not 
match the CTCAE term used for assigning severi ty.

Confident ial and Propri etary 65 Protocol 017007 Amendment 2.0: 17 Mar 2020AE severit y and seri ousness will  be assessed independent ly. ‘Severit y’ refers to the intensit y of 
an AE, while ‘serious’ is a regulatory  defini tion and serves as a gui de to the Sponsor for defining 
regul atory  reporting obligations.
9.2. Relationship to Study Drug
The assessment of the relationship of an AE/SAE to lympho depleting chemotherapy  and 
JCAR017 (related or not rel ated) is a clinical decisio n based on all available informat ion and the 
following considerations:
Related: There i s a reasonable possibilit y and/or evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship 
between the study  drug and the AE/SAE and no other more likely alternat ive 
cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, disease complicat ions, etc.) is suspected.
Not 
related:There i s no reasonable possibilit y and/or evi dence to suggest a causal relat ionship 
between study  drug and the AE/SAE and another more likely alternative cause 
(concomitant drugs or therapies, disease complicatio ns, etc.) is suspected.
9.3. Recording Adverse Events 
Adverse events/SAE are recorded on the eCRF in accordance with the reporting criteria for 
different time periods as defined in Section 9.4. Each AE/ SAE i s to be evaluated for:
Durati on (onset and resolut ion dates) 
Severit y, including grade changes during the 90 -day period fo llowing JCAR017
administration, as per the eCRF complet ion gui delines (see Section 9.1.3.1 )
Outcom e 
Seriousness (see Sect ion 9.1.2 )
Causal relat ionship wi th lymphodepl etingchem otherapy  or JCAR017 (see 
Secti on9.2)
9.3.1. Recording a Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms
Whenever possible, a unifying diagnosis should be reported, as opposed to a list ing o f individual 
symptoms. However, symptoms should be grouped into a diagnosis only if each sign or symptom 
is a medically  confirmed com ponent of that diagnosis as evidenced by  current standard m edical 
textbooks. If any aspect of a sign or sym ptom  does not fi t into a cl assic pattern of the diagnosis, 
the individual symptom should be reported as a separate AE/SAE.
One except ion to reporting a diagnosis as opposed to symptoms is the event of CRS. If a subject 
experiences an event of CR S, a di agnosis of CRS and any  grade changes for the event of CRS 
shoul d be reported as an AE. Individual signs and symptoms of CRS and grade changes for those 
signs and symptoms should be entered as CRS Symptoms in the eCRF. 
When manifestations o f neuro logical toxicities appear in the presence of CRS or alone, those 
manifestations should be reported as separate AEs.

Any laboratory  abnorm ality (eg, clinical chemistry or hematology ) or other ab norm al assessment 
findings (eg, ECG or vital signs) that meets any o f the following cri teria shoul d be recorded as an 
AE or SAE:
Requi res m edical  or surgi cal interventi on (incl uding transfusio ns or growth factors)
Leads to product discont inuat ion, del ay, or interruption
Associ ated wi th clinical signs and/or symptoms
Otherwi se clinically  significant as determined by the Invest igator
The clinical diagnosis, rather than the laboratory  resul tor CTCAE , should be reported by  the 
Invest igator (eg, anemia versus l ow hematocri t; neutropenia versus neutrophil count decreased ). 
9.3.3. Recording Serious Adverse Events
The fo llowing shoul d be considered when recording SAEs:
Death i s an outcome of an event. The event that resulted in death should be recorded 
in the eCRF and reported on the SAE Report Form.
For hospitalizations for surgical or diagnostic procedures, the illness leading to the 
surgi cal or di agnosti c procedure shoul d be recorded as the SAE, not the procedure 
itself. 
When progression of the disease under invest igation meets any o f the seri ousness 
criteria, i t will  be reported as an individual SAE. When reporting SAE terms related 
to disease progression, specific manifestations of the progression (eg, “malignant 
pleural  effusi on,” “lymphadenopathy  from underlying non-Hodgkin lympho ma”) 
shoul d be reported, rather than the general term “disease progression.”
9.3.4. Death Reports
All deaths must be reported on the Death eCRF. Deaths due to PD will not be reported as an 
SAE unless considered related to a study  drug.
Any AEs l eading to death from the time the subject provides informed consent through 90 days 
after the JCAR017 infusio n shoul d be reported according to Table 7.
Deaths that occur more than 90 day s after JCAR017 infusio n will  be captured on the Death 
eCRF and reported as an SAE only  if considered rel ated to any  study  procedure or JCAR017 .
9.3.5. Safety Queries
Queri es pertaining to SAEs will be co mmunicated fro m the Spons or Drug Safet y to the site via 
facsimile or electronic mail. The response t ime is expected to be no more than ten (10) business 
days. Urgent queries (eg, missing causalit y assessment) m ay be handled by phone.

bAny clinically  significant conditions/events unrelated to study procedures should be reported either in medical 
history  or as an adverse event as described in the CCGs.
SAEs will be fo llowed until they  resolve or return to baseline; the event stabilizes or is no longer 
considered clinically significant by  the Invest igator; the subject dies or withdraws consent; or 
study  closure. All nonseri ous AEs will be followed through the safety  reporting peri od. Certain 
nonserious AESIs m ay be fo llowed until they  resolve, return to baseline, or study  closure. 
9.4.2. Reporting Timelines for Serious Adverse Events
All SAEs must be reported within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event by  
facsimile or other appropriate method ( egvia email), using the SAE Report Form, or approved 
equivalent form. This instruction pertains to init ial SAE reports as well as any fo llow-up reports.
The Investigator is required to ensure that the SAE form is completed in its ent irety and tha t the 
data on the form is accurate and consistent. This requirement applies to all SAEs (regardless of 
relationship to invest igational product) recorded in the CRF 
The SAE Report Form should provide a detailed descript ion of the SAE and include a concise 
summary of hospital records, discharge reports, and other relevant documents. If a subject died 
and an autopsy  was perform ed, copi es of  the autopsy  report and death certificates are to be sent 
to Cel gene Drug Safet y as soon as these beco me available. If a subject develops a second 
primary  malignancy , copi es of  the pathol ogy and histol ogy reports are to be sent to Celgene 
Drug Safet y as soon as these beco me available.
The Investigator is responsible for informing the Inst itutional Review Board/Ethi cs Committee 
(IRB/EC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant init ial and fo llow-up inform ation 
about the event. The Invest igator mu st keep copi es of all SAE informat ion on file including 
correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/EC.
Queri es pertaining to SAEs will be co mmunicated fro m Celgene Drug Safet y to the si te via 
facsimile or electronic mail. The response t ime is expected to be n o more than 10 business days. 
Urgent queries (eg, missing causalit y assessment) may be handled by  phone .

tumor burden (m easured by  the sum of product of the perpendicular diameters (SPD) or high 
serum LDH prior to the start of lymphodeplet ion), age, and CNS disease status. These as well as 
additional subgroup analyses, which may be performed, will be described in the SAP prior to 
database lock. Subgroup a nalyses will only be performed if there are at least 5 subjects in each 
subgroup. Some grouping of classes will be considered if there are too few subjects in so me 
subgroups. Other subgroup analyses will also be performed if deemed appropriate.   
10.3.5.4. Safety Mo nitoring Boundaries
Safety monitoring boundaries based on Bay esian fram ework (Thall 1994 )have been included to 
help detect signals that may occur in the study .  These boundaries are non -binding and the 
following toxi city events occurr ingwithin 30 days of a JCAR017 cell product infusio n will  be 
considered as safet y events of interest for moni toring:
A Grade 3 or above, JCAR017 -related, treatm ent-emergent neurological toxicit y
Prolonged Grade 4 and Grade 5 individual safet y events 
Life-threatening (Grade 4) toxicit y attributable to JCAR017 that is unexpected, 
unmanageable (ie, does not resol ve to Grade 3 or lower within 7 days), and 
unrelated to chemotherapy
Death rel ated to JCAR017 therapy
Whenever the safet y boundaries are crossed, enrollment will be paused and an ad hoc SRC
meet ing will be held to review the data. The study will remain pau sed for enrollment pending the 
SRC recommendat ions. More informat ion is available in the 017007 Statistical Analysis Plan

Protocol  017007 A Celgene Co mpany
Confident ial and Propri etary 75 Protocol 017007 Amendment 2.0: 17 Mar 2020This study  is designed for estimation and does not include formal hypothesis testing or 
adjustm ent for multiplicity. For any  individual incidence rate (eg, AEs, ORR, CR), 80subjects 
woul d provi de a precisio n of ± 11.4%and50 subjects would pro vide a precisio n of ± 14.5%, to 
estimate each endpo int assuming a confidence level o f 95%. Thi s is based on an event rate of 
50% using the exact Clopper- Pearson method. Other rates would have narrower confidence 
intervals .
In Juno Study  017001, treatm ent wi th JCAR017 in subjects with R/R aggressive B -cell NHL 
resul ted in observed incidence rates for Grade ≥3 CRS or NT, infections, and prolonged 
cytopeni as of  12%, 9%, and 38%, respectively  (data on file ). If similar rates ar e observed in this 
study , this woul d provi de sufficient precisio n for meaningful interpretation of the observed rates. 
Example rates and associated 95% confidence intervals are given in Table 8.

10.5. Timing of Analyses 
Interim data may be analyzed and presented at scient ific meet ings.
Ananalysis is anticipated after at least 80 subjects have been treated with JCAR017 and these 
subjects have been fo llowed for at l east 6months or until death, PD, or withdrawal fro m study .  
Subjects treated with nonconforming product will not coun t towards the 80 subjects.
The final analyses will be carried out after all subjects have completed or discont inued the study  
due to any  reason. No form al hypothesis testing will be performed for this study .

Protocol  017007 A Celgene Co mpany
Confident ial and Propri etary 94 Protocol 017007 Amendment 2.0: 17 Mar 2020Schedule of Evaluations Footnotes:
a) Serum pregnancy test must be done within 48 hours prior to lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy. 
b) Not done for subjects who have received subsequent anticancer therapy .
c) Not required if done at the study site for screening and no intervening antitumor 
therapy  has been administered. If required, recommended within 14 days prior to the 
start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy and must be done within 6 weeks prior to the 
start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy. For subjects that receive anticancer 
treatment for disease control while JCAR017 is being produced, these assessments 
must be performed after completion of the intervening anticancer treatment and as 
close as possible to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy (recommended within 
7-14 days prior to start).
d) If clinically indicated .
e) Required only for subjects with suspected or confirmed CNS involvement, or as 
clinically indicated .
f) All evaluations and laboratory as sessments must be done prior to administration of 
lymphodepleting chemotherapy or JCAR017 .
g) To be done on each day of lymphodepleting chemotherapy .Prior to first dose, it 
must be confirmed that the subject meets criteria for lymphodepleting chemotherapy
as described in Section 8.2.5.2 .
h) Weight only .
i) Measured within approximately 5 minutes before and 15 minutes after infusion, then 
approximately every 15 minutes thereafter for the first hour and hourly (±15 
minutes) for the next 2 hours. Continue to monitor vital signs after this point until 
stable and as clinically indicated .
j) Routine neurological examination only .
k)For subjects with tDLBCL, a pathology report from the biopsy of their current 
relapsed disease is requi red.
l) PET and CT scan may be performed Day 22 to Day 29.
m) If CR is achieved, only CT scans will be required. Upon progression/relapse or 
initiation of another anticancer treatment, PET and CT scans are no longer required. 
Subjects who receive HSCT post-JCAR017 but no other anticancer treatment should 
continue to undergo PET and/or CT scans in accordance with the previous 
2sentences. PET scans should be performed to verify PD.
** MUGA/ECHO must be repeated after any intervening cardiotoxic anticanc er 
therapy .n) Not required if CR previously documented. 
o) If more than 1% of cells in test samples collected at the Day 365 visit or later test 
positive for vector sequences, the pattern of vector integration sites will be 
analyzed. If a predominant integration site is detected, then the subject will be asked 
to provide another blood sample 3 months later for follow -up testing.
p) If a subject receives lymphodepleting therapy but not JCAR017 , all AEs/SAEs 
should be recorded/reported for 30 days following the last dose of lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy. For subjects starting a subsequent nonchemotherapy -containing 
anticancer therapy (eg, checkpoint inhibitors, IMIDs) prior to 90 days following 
final JCAR017 administration, all AE/SAEs will be collected after initiation of the 
subsequent therapy for 90 days following final JCAR017 infusion or 30 days 
following subsequent therapy, whichever is longer. For subjects starting a 
subsequent chemotherapy -containing anticancer therapy prior to 90 days following 
final JCAR017 administration, only AEs and SAEs related to JCAR017 and/or 
protocol -mandated procedures must be recorded/reported after initiation of 
subsequent therapy.
q) Starting from 91 days after the last dose of JCAR017 until EOS visit .
r) Ifany of the following clinical conditions are observed, an SAE should be reported 
unless the event can be definitely attributed to an alternative cause: new/secondary 
malignancies; new onset or exacerbation of a pre -existing neurologic disorder; new 
onset of a rheumatologic or other autoimmune disorder; new onset of a hematologic 
disorder; rare and unexpected disorders with an unknown etiology (eg, Guillain -
Barré, Stevens -Johnson syndrome) .
s) Not required if B -cell recovery documented without recent admini stration of 
intravenous immune globulin .
t) Samples may be archived if all samples collected within the first year after the last 
dose of JCAR017 were tested and were negative for RCL.
u) Prior to dose, it must be confirmed that the subject meets criteria for JCAR017
treatment as described in Section 8.2.5.3 .
v) Not required if the subject is medically incapacitated and/or medically unable to 
complete .
w) Pregnancy test and contraceptive counseling for women of childbearing potential. 
x) Immunogen icity Assessment; samples will be processed to plasma and analyzed 
for the presence of antibodies that bind to the extracellular region of JCAR017.

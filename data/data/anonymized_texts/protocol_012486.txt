Replication of the RECORD1 Anticoagulant 
Trial in Healthcare Claims Data

Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making 
1. RCT Details
This section provides a high-level overview of a published  RCT that the described real-world evidence study is trying to replicate
as closely as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in the healthcare databases.
1.1 Title 
Rivaroxaban versus Enoxaparin for Thromboprophylaxis after Hip Arthroplasty ( RECORD1 ) 
1.2 Intended aim(s) 
To compare the risk of any deep vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death in patients who underwent 
elective total hip arthroplasty for rivaroxaban versus standard therapy of enoxaparin. 
1.3 Primary endpoint for replication  
The primary outcome of the study was the composite of any deep-vein thrombosis, nonfatal pulmonary embolism, or death 
from any cause 
1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable) 
With an assumed outcome rate of 8% and non-inferiority absolute margin of 3.5%, it was determined that 1,562 patients 
per study group would be needed to achieve 95% power to conclude noninferiority of rivaroxaban over standard therapy at 
one-sided alpha level of 0.025.  
1.5 Secondary endpoint for replication (assay sensitivity) and RCT finding Major bleeding; 0.3% risk in rivaroxaban group and 0.1% risk in enoxaparin group, with an absolute increase in risk of 0.2% 
(95% CI -0.1-0.5) 
1.6 Trial estimate 
0.8% risk of primary outcome in rivaroxaban group and 3.8% risk in enoxaparin group, with a risk reduction of 2.5 
percentage points with 95% CI 1.5 to 3.6 (Eriksson et al., 2008)

5. Cohort Identification
5.1 Cohort Summary 
This study will involve a new user, parallel group, propensity score-matched, retrospective cohort study design comparing 
rivaroxaban to enoxaparin users. The patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during a baseline period of 180 
days before initiation of rivaroxaban or enoxaparin (index date). We will restrict the analyses to patients who underwent a total 
hip arthroplasty. 
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation  New use of rivaroxaban, exposure, and enoxaparin, comparator, is defined as no use of either therapy in the 180 days prior to 
index date. 
5.2.1 Eligible cohort entry dates

replacement surgery on July 1, 2011

6. Variables
6.1 Exposure-related variables: 
Study drug:  
The study exposure of interest is initiation of rivaroxaban. New initiation will be defined by no use of rivaroxaban or enoxaparin in 
the prior 6 months before treatment initiation (washout period). 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making 
Comparator: 
New initiators of enoxaparin, defined by no use of rivaroxaban or enoxaparin in the prior 6 months. 
6.2 Covariates: 
Age
Sex
Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the baseline covariate assessment period, defined as 180 days prior to
and including index date
Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and 
analysis. We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient overlap 
between treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the 
initial feasibility analysis and the initial power assessment and are listed in Table 1 ( Appendix B ).  
6.3 Outcome variables and study follow-up:  
6.3.1 Outcome variables 
Primary Effectiveness outcomes of interest: (definitions provided in Appendix A ): 
Primary Outcome:  any deep vein thrombosis, non-fatal pulmonary embolism, or death from any cause
Safety outcome of interest: 
1. Major bleeding
6.3.2 Study follow-up 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making 
Both as-treated (AT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on the day of 
cohort entry. Because adherence in the real-world databases is expected to be much worse than in the trial, the AT analysis is the 
primary  analysis, as it targets the relative hazard of outcomes on treatment.  
For the AT analyses, the follow-up will start the day after initiation of apixaban and comparator and will continue until the earliest 
date of the following events: 
The first occurrence of the outcome of interest, unless otherwise specified for selected outcomes,
The date of end of continuous registration in the database,
End of the study period,
Measured death event occurs,
Nursing home admission
oNursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typically provide little to
no data on a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for
cohorts for the same reason.
The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatment episode of the index drug (apixaban
and comparator) plus a defined grace period (i.e., 10 days after the end of the last prescription’s days’ supply in main
analyses).
The date of augmentation or switching from exposure to comparator or vice versa or augmentation/switching to any other
NOAC (e.g. switching from rivaroxaban to apixaban would be a censoring event) or warfarin;
oA dosage change on the index treatment does not fulfill this criterion
oAn added treatment that is not part of the exposure or comparator group does not fulfill this criterion
The occurrence of a bilateral hip arthroplasty
For the intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses, the censoring based on the augmentation/switching and treatment discontinuation will be 
replaced with a maximum allowed follow-up time of 36 days.

In order to complete the initial power analysis, the dummy outcome of a 90-day gap in database enrollment will be used. This 
outcome is used to ensure that no information on the comparative risks of the outcomes of interest are available at this stage. 
Complete a 1:1 PS-matched comparative analysis using this outcome. PS should include only 3 covariates: age, sex, and combined 
comorbidity index. Power calculations are based on the formulas from Chow et al. (2008). 
Stop analyses until feasibility and power are reviewed by primary investigators and FDA. Reviewers evaluate the results of the
analyses described above in Sections 7 and 8, including numbers of patients, patient characteristics, follow-up time, and reasons
for censoring by treatment group, as well as overall rates of outcomes and study power. These parameters are re-evaluated and
reported in the subsequent sections, after incorporating feedback and refining the protocol.

 Re-calculate power in the appropriate excel table, using the revised number of matched patients from the PS-match in Section 9. 
All other parameters in the table should be the same as in Section 8. 
 
Note: Although the pooled power calculation from the emulation is below the 95% power threshold under similar assumptions as 
the trial, we saw the trial was overpowered for noninferiority, given the actual size of the effect. Given the trial finding of a 70% 
lower risk, we expect to have enough power in this trial emulation.

95% and a one-sided type I error rate of 2.5%. It
was assumed that 25% of patients would not have
valid venograms, resulting in a target sample size
of 4200 patients.Appendix A

1.0 Introduction  
1.1   
Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are relatively rare, heterogeneous malignancies that may a rise almost 
anywhere in the body. However, the most common sites for STS are in the extremities and trunk. 
Kattan et al reported on 2136 patients treated at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and 
observed these distributions: lower extremity (40.5%), u pper extremity (16.6%) and thoracic or 
trunk (17.5%).1  The mainstay of treatment for low-grade sarcomas  is surgery with wide resection , 
which yields a  high likelihood of local control ; radical resection is required for high -grade lesions to 
achieve similar outcomes.2-3 The goal of surgery is to obtain a tumor -free margin ; if that is not 
possible due to adjacent structures, adjuvant radiation is often employed.  
Although delivery of radiotherapy in large or high -grade extremity sarcoma is considered st andard, 
there is controversy regarding the appropriate timing of radiation delivery in relation to surgery. 
Nonetheless, data support preoperative radiotherapy as one of the standard options in t he 
management of extremity STS. The advantages of preoperativ e (as opposed to postoperative) 
radiotherapy are that , generally, a lower dose and smaller radiation volumes may be used with 
potential  improvement of long -term side effects and extremity function.4-6  Another potential 
advantage is assisting surgery throu gh tumor shrinkage and reduction of tumor cell seeding.7-8  A 
retrospective review of 317 patients treated at the University of Florida from 1980 -2007 with 
preoperative radiotherapy as part of a limb -conservation strategy showed that marginal resection 
(no tumor at inked margin) after preoperative radiation does not compromise local control or 
amputation -free survival when compared to wide/radical margins.9  This was felt to be related to 
radiosterilization of tumor cells within the reactive zone following preoperative radiation.  
The disadvantage of preoperative radiation is the higher likelihood of postoperative wound 
complications.6-12   A prospective randomized trial of preoperative versus postoperative 
radiotherapy by the NCIC CTG showed that the rate of  wound complications increased from 17% 
to 35% with preoperative radiation therapy ,6 albeit  these complications were generally temporary , 
without significant effect on long -term function . Additionally, the NCIC trial showed that more 
serious chronic side e ffects occurred in the cohort receiving postoperative radiotherapy because 
those patients were generally treated to higher doses with larger treatment volumes .13 
Combined conservative surgery and radiotherapy has been shown to achieve excellent local 
contr ol in sarcoma patients following margin -negative surgery, but late radiation morbidity and 
reduced quality of life may result from adjuvant radiation.13-15 In the NCIC CTG trial, patients that 
received postoperative radiation had higher rates of grade 2 or greater fibrosis (48% v ersus 
31.5%), increased edema (23% v ersus 15.1%) and joint stiffness (23% v ersus 17.8%).13 Although 
patients in the preoperative group had a lower rate of late effects, these effects  were still 
substantial , occurring in  64.4% in t he preoperative arm at 2 years following treatment.Increased 
field size and higher radiation dose were  predictive of increased late effects.  A prospective trial of 
sarcoma patients at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, which randomized patients to 
postoperative adjuvant brachytherapy versus observation, showed a significant improvement in 
local control for patients receiving brachytherapy.7 The b rachytherapy  target region was determined 
by adding 2 cm margins in the superior and inferior dimensions of  the tumor bed, with 1.5 -2 cm

  5 
added in the medial and lateral directions.  Among those patients with a local recurrence after 
adjuvant brachytherapy, the majority had “in -field” local recurrences. A retrospective review of 
patients treated in prospective t rials at Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto, Canada, for extremity 
soft tissue sarcoma with preoperative radiotherapy excised with a positive margin (including 
patients treated in the NCIC CTG trial) showed that including the postoperative radiation boost  for 
patients treated with preoperative radiation and margin -positive excision did not provide an 
advantage in preventing local recurrence for patients treated with external -beam radiotherapy.16 
Given that higher radiation doses also place patients at high er risk for late radiation morbidity, 
patients on the proposed trial will not undergo an additional postoperative radiation boost after 
adequate preoperative proton radiation.  
More r ecently the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) has completed a phase II trial to 
determine whether a  reduced radiation volume preoperatively with image -guided , intensity -
modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) can improve upon late effects of lymphedema, subcutaneous 
fibrosis , and joint stiffness. This study will provide importa nt information about whether late 
radiation morbidity is further reduced without compromising tumor control using reduced -field-
volume preoperative radiotherapy. Preliminary results presented in an abstract at the 53rd annual 
meeting of the American Societ y for Radiation Oncology in October 2011 show ed that acute 
toxicity profiles in patients with extremity STS treated with preoperative image -guided radiation 
therapy followed by surgery were  acceptable , with 37% of patients experiencing m ajor acute 
wound co mplications.16 Longer follow -up is required to show improvement in late toxicity and/or 
possible reduction in local control with smaller volumes irradiated.  
The rationale for using proton beam radiotherapy is the superior dose distribution t hat can be 
achieved in comparison with photon -based techniques. Protons and other charged particles 
deposit little energy in tissue until near the end of the proton range ; there,  the residual energy is 
lost over a short distance, resulting in a steep rise in the absorbed  dose known as the Bragg peak. 
Proton dose distributions are characterized by a lower -dose region in normal tissue proximal to 
tumor, a uniform high -dose region in the tumor, and zero dose beyond the tumor.18-20 Also, IMRT 
treatment plans often include localized areas within the high -dose volumes where dose 
inhomogeneity can be as high as 15 -20% above the target dose. Depending on the location of 
these “hot spots ,” there can be unanticipated acute normal -tissue toxicit y.21  Whether there are late 
effects attributable to these focal hot spots is unclear. Proton dose distributions are generally more 
homogenous. The dosimetric advantage of proton radiotherapy may translate into improved acute 
and late effects due to improv ed normal -tissue sparing in the treatment of extremity and truncal 
soft tissue sarcoma. However, these potential advantages need to be validated in clinical trials.   
We propose a phase II study to evaluate the effect of preoperative proton radiotherapy on the 
reduction of late radiation morbidity, patterns of failure, local failure rate, and impact of late 
radiation morbidity on general quality of life (QOL).

IRB# A phase II study of preoperative proton therapy in soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities and body wall  
  9 
5.2.2 –Margin status. Sarcomas require resection of the entire tumor as well as a margin of normal 
tissue.22  A positive margin or a negative margin of 2 mm or less has been shown to have a higher 
risk of local recurrence and decreased long -term survival.23 The goal of radiation is to “sterilize” the 
periphery of the tumor to kill or disable tumor cells most at ris k of remaining in the wound. In areas 
with ample soft tissue that can be removed without compromising future function or wound closure, 
wide margins is the goal of treatment; associated rates of local failure are low in such instances. 
Margins will be dete rmined by the  surgeon ; the goal is  to achieve  at least a 2 mm  negative margin 
resection. The s urgeon should determine and document a high possibility of limb preservation 
approach after preoperative radiation to obtain local control.  
However, smaller margi ns can be acceptable if it allows for limb -sparing surgery with conserved 
functional outcomes. A retrospective review of 132 patients treated at Massachusetts General 
Hospital from 1974 -1998 for extremity STS with preoperative RT and limb -sparing surgery s howed 
that 5 -year local control was inferior in  patients with positive margins (82%) compared to negative 
margins ≤ 1 mm (94%) and > 1 mm (97%).24  A modern series from Massachusetts General 
Hospital of 56 similarly treated patients reported a 5 -year loca l control rate of 93.2%, with all local 
failures observed occurring in patients with positive margins or <1 mm margins.25  Similarly treated 
patients at MD Anderson Cancer Center showed decreased local control (62% vs 91%) for positive 
surgical margins com pared to negative margins.26  When radiation is used, margins that are 1 mm 
or less can be accepted, allowing for limb -sparing surgery and decreased morbidity.  
Additionally, when the tumor grows close to a critical structure such as a major motor nerve or 
bone, the margins will be unavoidably close for function preservation. Careful dissection of these 
fixed structures, such as epineural dissection of a major nerve or periosteal resection along bone, 
is possible when combined with adjuvant radiatio n therapy.27,28 These “planned positive” margins 
have similar local recurrence rates to those observed with negative margins.29  After radiation, 
every effort should be made to have limb preservation surgery unless there is documented 
evidence of tumor pro gression during or after the course of radiation that would require amputation 
for an appropriate margin resection.  
6.0 Radiation Therapy  
6.1 Dose Specification  
6.1.1 – Preoperative proton radiation ther apy. The total dose will be  50 Gy in 2 5 fractions, with a 
minimum of 90 % of PTV r eceiving 50 Gy.  
6.2 Technical factors  
6.2.1 -Treatment will be delivered with selection of appropriate proton energies to optimize the 
radiotherapy dose distribution within the target volume and minimize dose to no n-target tissues  
6.2.2 – PTV includes setup uncertainty and lateral uncertainties perpe ndicular to the beam 
direction.  Each beam will be optimized to adjust for range uncertainties to guarantee adequate 
coverage of the PTV .

  10 
6.3 Localization, Simulation, an d Immobilization  
6.3.1 – Patient positioning will be based on clinical judgment to best achieve the ideal dose 
distribution using a variety of devi ces for limb/body immobilization  
6.4 Treatment planning/Volume definitions  
6.4.1 –CT-based 3D treatment plann ing will be used for all patients. Simulation will be done on a 
CT scan with limb/body immobilization  
6.4.2 – Gross Tumor Volume (GTV): Gross tumor will be defined as MRI T1 plus contrast image 
(MRI with contrast is required). Fusion of MRI and CT will be used to delineate the GTV for 
radiotherapy planning . 
6.4.3 – Clinical Target Volume (CTV): Include gross tumor and clinical microscopic margins. 
Typically CTV = GTV and suspicious edema (defined by MRI T2 images) plus 2 cm margins in the 
longitudinal direc tions. If this causes the radiation field to extend beyond the compartment, the field 
can be shortened to include the end of the compartment. The radial margin from the lesion should 
be 1 cm , including any portion of the tumor not confined by an intact fas cial barrier or bone or skin 
surface.  
6.4.4 – Planning Target Volume (PTV): Includes CTV and error of setup and organ motion. The 
PTV will include setup uncertainties , depend ing on immobilization method and daily image 
guidance.  
6.4.5 – Skin surfaces shoul d not be contoured in CTV or PTV unless these are involved by gross 
tumor. If the incisional biopsy scar is small and will be resected at the time of surgery, it may or 
may not be contoured as CTV.  
6.5 Critical Structures  
6.5.1 – Radiation dose to normal t issues should be kept within accepted normal tissue tolerances 
when using standard 2 Gy fractionation schedules. Every effort will be made to avoid treating the 
full circumference of an extremity ; avoid treating  the anus, vulva, scrotum, or lung; and avoid  
treating the skin to the full dose over areas commonly traumatized (e.g. elbow, knee, etc.), and 
femoral head/neck.  
6.5.2 – If tumor is close to the structures  mentioned in 6.5.1 , typically less than 50% volume of the 
anus and vulva should re ceive 30 Gy; less than 50% volume of  the testis should receive 3 Gy, if 
fertility preservation is desired; 20% of lung  should receive less than 20 Gy (V20); and less than 
5% of the femoral head/neck should receive 60 Gy. Less than 50% of any joints (including 
shoulder,  elbow, and knee) should receive 50 Gy. Less than 50% of kidn ey volumes should 
receive 14 Gy. For any other normal -tissue structures, no radiation dose more than established TD 
5/5 limits should be given.  
6.5.3 – No more than 50% of a longitudinal strip of skin and subcutaneous tissue of an  extremity 
should receive 20 Gy. This strip of normal tissue will be  contoured by the treating radiation 
oncologist. Full prescription dose to skin over areas commonly traumatized should be avoided.  
IRB# A phase II study of preoperative proton therapy in soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities and body wall  
  11 
6.5.4 – No more than 50% of weight -bearing bone within the radiation field should receive 50 Gy , 
except when the tumor invades the bone or when there is circumferential involvement of the tumor 
in more than a quarter of the bone , or when the bone will be resected in a subsequent surgical 
resection after radiation.  
6.5.5 – There is no special requirement for skin dose limit. However, skin s paring is recommended 
if possible. Skin surface (5  mm thickness) including scar for incision biopsy is not included in CTV 
or PTV and is not bolused, unless the biopsy scar is not subsequently resected after preoperative 
radiotherapy.  
6.6 Radiation adverse  events  
6.6.1 – Acute: Wound complications are expected in about a third of patients. Other common 
adverse events include: fatigue, regional alopecia, diarrhea, skin erythema , and desquamation in 
treatment fields.  
6.6.2 – Long -term: Common long -term events include: lymphedema of the extremity receiving 
radiation and surgery, subcutaneous fibrosis, and joint stiffness. Less common events include 
bowel injury, osteoradionecrosis, and bony fracture in the radiation field.  There is also  a risk of 
secondary cancer in previously irradiated field s. 
6.7 Radiation adverse even t reporting  
6.7.1 – This study will utilize the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.0 for reporting of adverse events. A copy of the CTCAE v4.0 can be downloaded from 
the CTEP web site.

7.8.1 – The MSTS30 is a measure of physical function across 7 items, completed by th e physician 
(preferably by the o rthopedic  surgeon or Surgical Oncologist) or the physician’s designated staff. 
The 7 items are: pain, range of motion, strength, joint stability, joint deformity, emotional 
acceptance, and overall function. Each item is score d from 0 -5 with a maximum possible score  of 
35. The MSTS has been in use for over 20 years and is a widely recognized and utilized tool used 
to evaluate physical function. The MSTS can be completed in approximately 10 minutes by a 
clinic ian familiar with the rating. The MSTS rating will be perfo rmed at the following time points: 
prior to start  offing on  protocol (baseline), and at 12, 18, and 24 months after start of proton 
radiation therapy.  
7.9 Quality of Life  
7.9.1 – Patient quality of life will be assessed using the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy 
– General (FACT -G) assessment. The FACT -G31 is a commonly used tool measuring general 
quality of life across 4 scales: physical, emotional, social/family and functional well -being.  It has 
been written at a 4th grade reading lev el, and a patient can generally complete the survey in 5 -10 
minutes. The FACT has been translated into 26 languages, and translations are accessible at the 
FACIT web site, http://www.facit.org/translation/licensure.aspx . 
8.0 Statistical considerations  
8.1 Study endpoints  
8.1.1 – Primary endpoint – To determine the effect of reduced radiation volume with proton 
radiotherapy on combined late radiation toxicities (>grade 2 lymphedema, subcutaneous 
fibrosis, and joint stiffness) at 2 years from the start of rad iation treatment using 
EORTC/RTOG criteria. See section 7.6.3 -7.6.4.  
8.1.2 – Secondary endpoints  
IRB# A phase II study of preoperative proton therapy in soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities and body wall  
  16 
8.1.2.1 – To estimate the effect of reduced radiation volume with proton radiotherapy on 
late radiation morbidity at 2 years from start of radiation treatment using CTCAE, v.4.0 
criteria.  
8.1.2.2 – Other CTCAE, v.4.0 grade 3 -5 events  
8.1.2.3 – To determine pattern of first failure  
8.1.2.4 – Time to local failure  
8.1.2.5 – Time to regional failure  
8.1.2.6 – Time to distant failure  
8.1.2.7 – Distant -disease free s urvival ( distant failure or death due to any cause).  
8.1.2.8 – Disease free survival ( local, regional or distant failure or death due to any cause)  
8.1.2.9 – Overall survival (death due to any cause)  
8.1.2.10 – Time to second primary tumor  
8.1.2.11 – Estim ate the rate of wound complications  
8.1.2.12 – To assess the impact of late radiation morbidity at 2 years on clinical measure, 
MSTS  
8.1.2.13 – To correlate late radiation morbidity at 2 years with quality of life assessment, 
FACT -G 
8.1.2.14 – Estimate the rate of tumor necrosis  
 
8.2 Overview and Sample size  
8.2.1 – This prospective study is designed to assess late radiation toxicity. The primary 
endpoint is whether or not a patient experiences at least 1 of the 3 toxicities at a severity of 
grade 2 or greater at 2 years from start of radiation treatment. The NCIC study showed 
31.5% grade 2 or greater fibrosis, 15.1% lymphedema and 17.8% joint stiffness in the 
preoperative arm at 2 years following treatment, and 37% of patients had at least one of 
these 3 toxicities at 2 years.  
8.2.2 – We will test for a 20% absolute decrease in combined toxicity. A sample size of 41 
patients is required to show a 20% decrease with a significance level of 0.05 and 90% 
power. Assuming that 5% of patients will be r etrospectively ineligible and an additional 15% 
will not have a 2 -year assessment for the primary endpoint due to death or loss to follow up, 
the total targeted sample size in this study is 51 patients.  
 
8.3 Safety Monitoring and Data Reporting  
8.3.1 – The overall safety data will be monitored regularly and incorporated into interim 
reports prepared at regular intervals during study enrollment and follow -up. Interim reports 
will be prepared every six months until the primary endpoint has been evaluated in a ll 
participants and made available to the institutional review board. Overall safety monitoring 
will occur  weekly during treatment and  at each follow -up visit.  The principal investigator will 
be responsible for collection of data and preparation of interi m reports.  In general, these 
reports include:  
8.3.1.1 – Institutional accrual, accrual rate with projected completion date  
IRB# A phase II study of preoperative proton therapy in soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities and body wall  
  17 
8.3.1.2 – Pretreatment characteristics  
8.3.1.3 – Compliance rates of treatment delivery with respect to the protocol prescription  
8.3.1.4 – Frequency and severity of reported adverse events

5. Cohort Identification  
 
a. Cohort Summary  
This study will employ a new user, active comparator, observational cohort study design comparing tofacitinib to 
abatacept . The patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during the baseline period of 365 days before 
initiation of tofacitinib or abatacept  (index date).  Follow -up for the outcome ( dementia ) differs between analyses. 
Follow -up begins the day after drug initiation  (analysis 1 , 3, 4 ); 180 days after drug initiation (analysis 2 ).

c. Outcome variables  and study follow -up:  
 
• Primary outcome : incident dementia, i.e., Alzheimer’s disease, vascular dementia, senile, presenile, or 
unspecified dementia, or dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere . Outcome will be defined by 1 inpatient 
claim or 2 outpatient claims  in analysis 1, 2, 3. In analysis 4, the outcome will be defined by 1 inpatient or 1 
outpatient claim s and 1 prescription claim  for a symptomatic treatment [donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine, and 
memantine ] within 6 months of each other with outcome date assigned to second event in the sequence .  
• Secondary outcomes: Individual component:  
Alzheimer’s di sease  
 
Condition  ICD-9 and ICD -10 codes  
Alzheimer’s disease  331.0*, F00*, G30*  
Vascular dementia  290.4*, F01*  
Senile, presenile, or unspecified dementia  290.0*, 290.1*. 290.3*, 797*, F03*  
Dementia in other diseases classified elsewhere  331.1*, 331.2*, 331.7*, 294.1*, F02*  
 
For analysis 1, 3, and 4  the follow -up will start the day after initiation of tofacitinib and abatacept and will continue until 
the earliest date of the following events:  
• The first occurrence of the outcome of interest  
• The date of end of continuous registration in the database , 
• End of the study period,  
• Measured death event occurs,  
• The date of drug discontinuation, defined as the date of the last continuous treatment episode of the index drug 
(tofacitinib and abatacept ) plus a defined grace period (i.e., 90 days after the end of the last prescription’s days’ 
supply in main analyses).

 10 8. Propensity score  analysis   
We will use a propensity -score (PS) 1-based approach to account for measured confounding in this study. The PS will 
be calculated as the predicted probability of initiating the exposure of interest (i.e., the repurposing cand idate) versus 
the reference drug conditional on baseline covariates using multivariable logistic regression constructed separately 
in each data source. On average, patients with similar PSs have similar distribution of potential confounders used to 
estimat e the PS. Therefore, analyses conditioned on the PS provide effect estimates that are free from measured 
confounding. For all our analyses, initiators of each exposure of interest will be matched with initiators of the reference 
exposure based on their PS within each data source. 2 Pair matching will be conducted using a nearest -neighbor 
algorithm, which seeks to minimize the distance between propensity scores in each pair of treated and reference 
patients, 3 and a caliper of 0.025 on the natural scale of the PS will be used to ensure simila rity between the matched 
patients. 4  
 
We report  multiple diagnostics for PS analysis in this protocol . First, the PS distributional overlap  is provided  between 
two groups  before and after matching  to ensure comparability of these groups. 5 Next, balance in each individual 
covariate between two treatment groups is reported using standardized differences. 6

 18 9. Statistical analysis plans  
Incidence rates for the outcome will be estimated for the treatment and reference groups before and after PS 
matching. The competing risk of death could be of concern for the current set of analyses if mortality is frequent 
among patients included in the c ohort and if differences in the risk of mortality between treatment and reference 
groups are substantial. In the PS -matched sample, we will use cause -specific hazard models 7 to provide hazard 
ratios averaged over the entire follow -up period as well as interval specific hazard ratios (1, 2, and 3 years)  for the 
association between the treatment of interest and risk of ADRD after considering all -cause mortality as a competing 
event. Pre -specified subgroup analyses will be conducted based on age, sex, and baseline cardiovascular disease.

SUMMARY  
 
You are being asked to be in a research study  because you are a p erson with diabetes who has a 
non-healing wound on your foot (Diabetic Foot Ulcer or DFU) . The purpose of this consent form 
is to help you decide if you want to be in the research study . 
 
You should not join this research study until all your questions are  answered , and you understand 
the answers to those questions . 
 
Things to know before deciding to take part in a research study:  
   
• The main goal of a research study  is to learn things to help patients in the future.  
• The main goal of regular medical care  is to help each patient.  
• The decision to join or not join the research study will not cause you to lose any medical 
benefits . If you decide not to take part in this study, your doctor will continue to treat 
you. 
• Parts of this study may involve standard medic al care . Standard medical care (also called 
Standard of Care, or SOC) is the treatment normally given for a certain condition or 
illness.  
• After reading the consent form and talking  with the research staff, you should know 
which parts of the study are exper imental and which are standard medical care.

medical records may be looked at and/or copied by the sponsor of this study and 
government agencies or other groups associated w ith the study.  
• Your medical insurance may be billed for any standard medical care you receive during 
the research study . If your insurance company is billed , then it may have access to the 
research records . Insurance companies may not pay for treatment tha t is part of a research 
study . Taking part in a research study could affect your current or future insurance 
coverage.  
 
PURPOSE OF THE STUDY  
 
The treatment  of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) continues to be part of the major economic burden 
of chronic wounds w orldwide with costs of at least $50 billion in the U.S. While many DFUs 
will heal with good standard of care (SOC) , the process can take many months.  During this time , 
wounds can become infected and at higher risk for lower extremity amputation. Adding 
treatments that can speed the healing process will result in lower treatment costs as well as 
lowering risks of complications.  
 
There is a wealth of evidence to support the benefits of oxygen therapy on wound healing1-7.  
Oxygen is required for all major pro cesses of wound healing and wound hypoxia is common.  
Skin wounds can receive oxygen from the blood stream via perfusion and from oxygen uptake 
through the skin.  Yet, both wound perfusion and blood oxygen levels are frequently insufficient 
in patients wit h chronic wounds due to poor circulation, vascular disruption, and 
vasoconstriction, thereby reducing the wound’s capacity to heal.  
 
The purpose of this study is to find out if adding Natrox® Oxygen Wound Therapy to Standard 
of Care in chronic Wagner Grad e 1 and 2 diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) makes those wounds heal 
faster than when they are treated with SOC alone.  
 
PROCEDURES  
 
You will sign and date th is informed consent  form before the study doctor does  any study -related 
procedures.  Once the informed con sent is signed, the 2 -week long Screening Period starts.  The 
purpose of the Screening Period is to make sure you meet all the requirements to be in the study.  
The Screening Period for this study has 2 visits, each one week apart.  
 
If your wound is on the  bottom of your foot a cast will be used to offload (take pressure off) the 
wound. The cast will be changed 7 days later at your second screening visit. This type of cast is 
called a Total Contact Cast (TCC). If you have never worn a TCC before you will ha ve an extra 
visit 3 days after your first screening visit for a cast change and to make sure you’re not having 
problems with it. After the screening period, the TCC will be changed weekly at your scheduled 
treatment visit.

Page 3 of 12 During the Screening Period,  the study doctor will perform the following assessments and 
procedures : 
 
• Demographics  such as age, sex and race  
• Medical and surgical history , including foot ulcer history and any other wounds  
• Find out what medications you take and if you have any changes  
• Phys ical examination , including vital signs  
• Check how much pain you’re having from the study ulcer  
• Study ulcer history and assessment  e.g. how long you’ve had the wound, how much 
drainage and what type of drainage  
• Check for infection in the study wound  
• Measure  the blood -flow to your foot by getting an ABI ( Ankle -Brachial Index), SPP 
(skin perfusion pressure), TCOM (transcutaneous oximetry) measurement, TBI (Toe -
Brachial Index) or Arterial Doppler Study if you don’t have test results within the past 90 
days 
• Test your HbA1c with a fingerstick if you don’t have test results within the past 90 days  
• Pregnancy test (blood or urine) if you are a female of childbearing potential  
• Debride (remove dead, damaged or infected tissue) the study ulcer, if necessary  
• Clean the st udy ulcer  
• Take a d igital photo graph and measurement  of the study ulcer  
• Place SOC dressings on your wound (absorbent dressings of hydrofiber/alginate)  
• Offload (take pressure off the wound) with a TCC, if the wound is on the bottom of your 
foot 
• Check that yo u’ve been wearing the cast correctly and not having any problems with it, 
(if applicable)  
• Review  your eligibility to continue in the screening period  
•  
If you successfully complete the Screening Period, you will immediately move to the Treatment 
Period whic h has 13 scheduled visits.  
 
At Treatment Visit 1,  the study doctor will perform the following assessments and procedures : 
• Check how much pain you’re having from the study ulcer  
• Check that you’re wearing the TCC correctly and not having any problems with it , (if 
applicable)  
• Check for any changes in your health  
• Check for any changes in your medications or treatments  
• Assess  the study ulcer , e.g. how much drainage and what type of drainage  
• Check for infection in the study wound  
• Clean the study ulcer  
• Debride the  study ulcer, (if necessary)  
• Take a d igital photo graph and  measurement  of the study ulcer  
• Measure the change in wound size over the past 2 and 4 weeks  
• Confirm you meet all the requirements to continue in the study  
• Randomization

• Offload (take pressure off the wound) with a TCC if the wound is on the  bottom of

If, after reviewing the information from the screening period the study doctor finds that you do 
not meet all the requirements to continue in the study, you will be finished with the trial.  
 
If the study doctor finds that you do meet all requirements to be in the study, you will be 
randomized to one of two treatment  group s: 
 
• Group 1 will receive standard of care therapy and Natrox® Oxygen Wound Therapy .   
• Group 2 will receive standard of care therapy alone.   
 
Randomization is like fli pping a coin: you have an equal chance of being placed in either group.  
Neither you, your study doctor, nor the research staff can choose the group you will be in. Your 
study doctor has a sealed envelope assigned to your study number that contains a lette r saying 
which study group you will be in.  You must be okay with being in either group.  
 
The study doctor will apply the treatment that you are randomized to and make sure offloading 
of your wound (if applicable) is satisfactory.  You will then be seen on ce a week up to 1 2 more 
weeks for additional treatment visits.  
 
At weekly Treatment Visits 2 -12, the study doctor will perform the following assessments:  
• Check how much pain you’re having from the study ulcer  
• Check that you’ve been wearing the TCC correctl y and not having any problems with 
it, (if applicable)  
• Check for any changes in your medications or treatments  
• Check for any changes in your health  
• Check if the study ulcer is fully healed  
o If the study ulcer is 100% healed , you will be finished with the tr ial  
• Assess the study ulcer, e.g. how much drainage and type of drainage  
• Check for infection in the study wound  
• Clean the study ulcer  
• Debride the study ulcer, if necessary  
• Take a d igital photo and measurements of the study ulcer

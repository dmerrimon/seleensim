pneumonia, bacteremia/sepsis, bacterial meningitis, 
visceral abscess , osteomyelitis/septic arthritis) . 
2) Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
 The incidence of infections other than acute serious 
bacterial infections  meeting FDA guidance criteria. 
 The number of days missed from 
work/school/kindergarten/daycare, or days unable to 
perform normal daily activities due to infection s. 
 The number of days that the care  provider of the 
pediatric subject had to miss work in order to care for 
the child due to infections .

infections. 
 The number of days of intravenous (IV) therapeutic 
antibiotics.  
 The number of days of oral therapeutic antibiotics.  
 Time to resolution of infections . 
 The incidence of infections other than serious bacterial

SAFETY ENDPOINT S 1) Primary Safety Endpoint:  The proportion of 
infusions with temporally associated adverse events 
Clinical Study Protocol Green Cross Corporation 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol Number: GC5107B_P3 
Version 2.0 Amendment 3  Page 7 of 75 (AEs) that occur during or within 1  hour, 24 hours , and 
72 hours following an infusion of investigational 
product (including AEs that were determined to be 
unrelated to the product) . 
2) Secondary Safety Endpoints  
 The overall incidence of all AEs that occur during or 
within 1 hour, 24 hours ,and 72 hours following an 
infusion of investigational product .  
 The frequency of all AEs that occur during the study  
regardless of the investigator’s assessment of thei r 
relationship to investigational product . 
 The frequency of suspected adverse reaction s as 
defined by all AEs  either classified by investigator or 
sponsor as at least possibly related to GC5107. 
 Changes in vital signs, physical examinations , and 
laboratory test results . 
 The number and proportion of  GC5107 infusions for 
which the infusion rate was decreased due to AEs . 
 The proportion of AEs considered by the investigator 
to be investigational product  related. 
 Viral safety (freedom from transmission of 
blood-borne viral diseases) : the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) 1&2, hepatitis A virus 
(HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus 
(HCV), and parvovirus B19 . 
PHARMACOKINETIC 
ENDPOINTS  1) Primary PK Endpoints

population) . 
 Trough serum total IgG levels before each infusion of 
GC5107 in all subjects and the interval between 
infusions will be recorded .  
2) Secondary PK Endpoints

population)  
 Trough serum level  of IgG subclasses and specific IgG 
antibodies  before Infusion 1, 5, 9, 13 (for 28 -day

infusion subject)  
o anti-Hemophilus influenza  type b 
Clinical Study Protocol Green Cross Corporation 
CONFIDENTIAL Protocol Number: GC5107B_P3 
Version 2.0 Amendment 3  Page 8 of 75 o anti-Streptococcus pneumonia  serotypes  
o anti-Tetanus toxoid  
o anti-Cytomegalovirus (CMV)  
 Number and proportion of subjects who failed to meet 
the target IgG trough level (500  mg/dL) at any time 
point equal to or subseque nt to 5th infusion (estimated 
5 half-lives). 
ANALYTICAL PLAN / 
STATISTICAL METHOD  Efficacy data will be evaluated by comparing the number 
of acute serious bacterial infections per subject per year  
according to the FDA guideline of an upper one -sided 99%  
confidence limit < 1.0 per subject per year. The primary 
safety endpoint will be analyzed with the objective of 
demonstrating that the percentage of infusions with one or 
more infusion -related AE is less than 40% . 
Pharmacokinetic parameters (clearance, mean residence 
time, volume of distribution, and terminal half -life) will be 
estimated by fit ting noncompartmental analysi s 
individually to the data for each subject in the PK 
population, except for the AUC which will be determined 
using a (log -) trapezoidal rule as the area above the 
previous trough level.  Pharmacokinetic parameters will  be 
derived from serum IgG levels and presented descriptively.  
Trough levels of IgG subclasses will be summarized 
relative to  dosing interval. All other data will be reported 
descriptively.

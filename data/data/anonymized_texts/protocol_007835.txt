 123 
1.1 Background and Rationale  124 
1.1.1 Public Health Impact of Diabetic Retinopathy  125 
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of visual loss and new -onset blindness in the 126 
United States for those 20 through 74 years of age .1 As of 2010, 3.63 million people worldwide 127 
are estimated to have at least moderate vision loss due to the complications of DR , and 850 128 
thousand are estimated to suffer from blindness due to DR.2  Proliferaitve diab etic retinopathy 129 
(PDR)  can lead to vitreous hemorrhage (VH) which may affect vision and is a lead ing indication 130 
for vitrectomy. V itreous hemorrhage  also can preclude performing panretinal photocoagulation 131 
(PRP), as well as the evaluation and treatment of o ther diabetic and non -diabetic retinal 132 
pathology such as diabetic macular edema (DME) and age -related macular degeneration.  Even 133 
in the modern era of using either PRP or anti -vascular endothelial growth factor (anti -VEGF ) 134 
therapy to treat PDR, a Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network ( DRCR.net ) clinical 135 
trial showed that 27% to 34% of eyes developed VH over 2 years even after treatment was 136 
initiated with either anti -VEGF or PRP, respectively.3  Given the increasing  prevalence of 137 
diabetes  in the U nited States and worldwide , the public health impact of PDR and its 138 
complications  are large.2, 4  139 
 140 
1.1.2 Treatment Options for VH from PDR  141 
Although VH by itself is not detrimental to the eye, rapid clearance of the hemorrhage is 142 
desirable for both functional and anatomic reasons and also allows evaluation and treatment of 143 
the eye for other pathology such as DME.  Functional central and periph eral visual acuity (VA) 144 
is commonly affected adversely by intraocular hemorrhage. As long as the retinal status remains 145 
stable, VA usually improves once the blood resolves.  However, vitreous traction on or 146 
contraction of fibrous proliferans associated wit h retinal neovascularization, leading to VH, can 147 
lead to further complications causing VA loss if left unchecked.  Prior to the advent  of anti - 148 
VEGF therapy , in most cases of VH, PRP was performed as soon as the media clear ed 149 
sufficiently to allow visibilit y and laser uptake.  The goal of the PRP was to achieve regression 150 
of new vessels or at least stabilization of the neovascularization in order to decrease the 151 
probability of new or worsening VH or traction or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment while 152 
further  clearing of the hemorrhage occu rred.  PRP generally leads to regression or quiescence of 153 
retinal neovascularization after a limited number of treatments and result s in a reduction of 154 
severe vision loss over 5 years to rates as low as 4% . 5  155 
 156 
Although PRP has been the standard care for PDR for several decades, results from the 157 
DRCR.net Protocol S (Prompt  Panretinal Photocoagulation versus Intravitreal Ranibizumab with 158 
Deferred Panretinal Photocoagulation for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy) published in 159 
November 2015 suggest that anti-VEGF  therapy is a safe and effective treatment alternative for 160 
PDR, with advantages over PRP in reductions in visual field sensitivity loss, need for vitrectomy 161 
and development of DME.3  This study demonstrated  non -inferiority of mean visual acuity letter 162 
improvement at 2 years for eyes treated with ranibizumab and deferred PRP as compared to 163 
those given prompt PRP for baseline PDR (difference +2.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.5 to  164 
+5.0, non -inferiority P<0.001).  Although visual change at 2 years was not superior in the anti - 165 
VEGF group, the average visual acuity over 2 years (area under the curve) was significantly 166 
better in eyes that received anti -VEGF with a mean treatment group difference of +4.2 (95% CI: 167 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  1-2  +3.0 to +5.4, P<0.001).  In addition, eyes that underwent prompt PRP had greater visual field 168 
sensitivity loss (mean dB difference 372; 95% CI: 213 to 531, P<0.001), more frequent 169 
vitrectomy (15% versus 4%, difference 9%, 95% CI : 4% to 15%, P<0.001), and, among those 170 
without DME causing VA loss at baseline, were more likely to develop DME causing VA loss 171 
(28% versus 9%, difference 19%, 95% CI: 10% to 28%, P<0.001) over the course of 2 years.  172 
 173 
Two approaches for the management of VH from PDR are vitrectomy and treatment with anti - 174 
VEGF agents, the latter being  highly effective even at small doses in regressing PDR.6 Although 175 
clinical results suggest that both these methods are effective at improving retinal 176 
neovascularization, to date there has not been a randomized clinical trial with head to head 177 
comparison of their relative ef ficacy in improving VA in eyes with VH from PDR.  178 
 179 
A standard approach for treatment of VH associated with PDR is to proceed to prompt 180 
vitrectomy in order to provide the fastest possible improvement in VA.  Vitrectomy, or surgical 181 
removal of the vitreous g el and associated hemorrhage, enables rapid clearance of VH and 182 
concurrent delivery of panretinal endolas er.  In cases in which traction  retinal detachments or 183 
rhegmatogenous detachments occur, vitrectomy can also eliminate extensive neovascularization 184 
and treat existing retinal detachments.7  Many advances in instrumentation and technique have 185 
resulted in dramatically faster surgical times, easier patient recovery and a reduction in 186 
complications over the last few decades.8  In particular, the advent of 23 gauge surgical 187 
techniques , and smaller,  have  resulted in smaller surgical incisions and the possibility of 188 
sutureless surgery in addition to smaller instruments that allow more delicate manipulations of 189 
fibrovascular retinal tissue.8  According to Castellarin et al,  surgical complications still remain , 190 
including recurrent hemorrhage,9 neovascular glaucoma, retinal detachment, fibrinoid syndrome, 191 
endophthalmitis and hypotony with subsequent phthisis bulbi.10  It should be noted that many 192 
reports of vitrectomy outcomes in the diabetic population c ombine results from eyes with 193 
complex traction retinal detachments together with those from uncomplicated VH.11, 12  194 
However, data acq uired from a cross -sectional population based study in the United Kingdom 195 
suggest that eyes with simple VH have substantially better functional and anatomic outcomes 196 
than those with any component of traction retinal detachment.13   197 
 198 
The Diabetic Retinopathy Vitrectomy Study from the 1980s found a benefit for early vitrectomy 199 
within 6 months as compared to delayed vitrectomy after 12 months, particularly in eyes of type 200 
1 diabetic patients with severe vision loss from dense VH.14  In addition, a retrospective 201 
comparison of immediate versus delayed vitrectomy for VH from PDR found that although final 202 
vision did not differ significantly between the groups, the area under the curve for logMAR  203 
visual acuity from first presentation to last foll ow-up was significantly greater, meaning more 204 
time with decreased vision, for eyes that had delayed versus immedia te vitrectomy, suggesting a 205 
possible visual benefit over time in eyes undergoing vitrectomy sooner.15  Recent large scale, 206 
multi -center randomized trials of vitrectomy for the sole indication of VH from PDR are lacking. 207 
At th is time, there is rationale for comparing current outcomes utilizing newer surgical 208 
techniques to alternative treatment modalities for PDR associated VH, including anti -VEGF 209 
therapy.  210 
 211 
VEGF is a major causative factor in eye diseases that are characterized by neovascularization or 212 
increased vascular permeability, such as DR.16-25  Anti-VEGF drugs are highly effective at 213 
causing regression of retinal neovascularization, and therefore can be useful in cases of VH due 214 
to PDR by reducing the chance of additional VH or traction or rhegmatogenou s retinal 215 
detachments from new vessels. Once the hemorrhage is reabsorbed and the neovascularization is 216 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  1-3  temporarily stabilized by the anti -VEGF drug, either PRP can be completed or a longer -term 217 
course of anti -VEGF can be initiated to increase the chance o f permanent regression of the PDR 218 
and lower the likelihood of subsequent VH or traction detachment of the macula or both without 219 
having to perform vitrectomy.   220 
 221 
Anti-VEGF therapy has been evaluated in eyes with VH from PDR in the DRCR.net Protocol N 222 
(An E valuation of Intravitreous Ranibizumab for Vitreous Hemorrhage Due to Proliferative 223 
Diabetic Retinopathy), although the endpoint of this study was short -term avoidance of 224 
vitrectomy (16 weeks after randomization) rather than VA recovery.26 This study compared the 225 
safety and efficacy of anti -VEGF treatment with saline injection for prevention of vitrectomy in 226 
eyes with VH from PDR.  Although Protocol N did not show a difference in  vitrectomy rates at 227 
16 weeks comparing ranibizumab with saline injections, both treatment groups had lower than 228 
expected vitrectomy rates (12% vs. 17% respectively), and the ranibizumab group had greater 229 
visual acuity improvements (22±23 vs. 16±31, P  = 0.04), increased PRP completion rates (44% 230 
vs. 31%, P = 0.05), and a reduced rate of recurrent VH (6% vs. 17%, P = 0.01) compared with 231 
saline injections.  26  Therefore, it is possible that anti -VEGF drugs have at least a short term 232 
biologic effect.  Rates of vitrectomy at 16 weeks in Protocol N were substantially lower than 233 
those suggested by pre vious studies with observation arms, suggesting that the management of 234 
eyes with VH from PDR with anti -VEGF therapy might avoid further surgical intervention in 235 
many eyes.  Indeed, by 52 weeks (with 12 weeks through 52 weeks of treatment at investigator 236 
discretion), only 40% of eyes in both groups received vitrectomy; thus, by 1 year approximately 237 
60% of eyes did not need vitrectomy. The efficacy of anti -VEGF treatment in allowing clearance 238 
of VH while avoiding surgery, especially in eyes that have already received PRP is supported by 239 
another recent case series, which reported treatment with bevacizumab in 18 eyes of 18 patients 240 
with new onset VH after previous full PRP.27  By 12 months, 72.2% of eyes had complete 241 
clearing of VH.  However, although 9 (50%) of the eyes gained vision, overall there was no 242 
statistically significant visual gain over 12 months (mean best correct ed VA improved from 243 
1.32±1.03 to 1.09±1.10 logMAR, p = 0.433), and 2 eyes (11%) had severe vision loss of 3 or 244 
more lines of vision due to traction retinal detachment.   245 
 246 
1.1.3 Aflibercept  247 
The anti -VEGF agent to be used in this trial is intravitreous aflibercept injection, also known as 248 
VEGF  Trap -Eye or Aflibercept (Eylea®), which is a soluble decoy receptor fusion protein that 249 
has a high binding affinity to all isoforms of VEGF as well as to placental growth factor.  250 
Aflibercept received  approval by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the 251 
treatment of neovascular age -related macular degeneration in 201128, treatment of macular 252 
edema due to central retinal vein occlusion in 201229-31, and treatment of macular edema due to 253 
branch retinal vein occlusion and treatment of DME in 2014 .32   254 
 255 
Based on data from the VIVID and VISTA phase III DME studies, aflibercept also became  256 
approved for treatment of diabetic retinopathy in patients with DME  in 2015 .  Change in diabetic 257 
retinopathy severity level  among eyes with DME and DR at baseline  was a pre -specified 258 
secondary efficacy outcome, and the proportion  of patients improving by at least 2 steps was 259 
significantly greater in aflibercept -treatment groups compared to the control group at 10 0 weeks  260 
in both trials .33 261 
 262 
Although there is no currently available head -to-head data on the available anti -VEGF agents for 263 
treatment of PDR, a compara tive effectiveness trial in DME reported that aflibercept was more 264 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  1-4  effective than ranibizumab and bevacizumab in improving vision in eyes starting with CI -DME 265 
and worse levels of visual acuity (approximately 20/50 or worse).34    266 
 267 
1.1.4 Summary of Study Rationale  268 
Although VH from PDR can cause acute and dramatic vision loss for patients with diabetes, 269 
there is no cur rent, evidence -based clinical guidance as to what treatment method is most likely 270 
to provide the best visual outcomes once intervention is desired.  Intravitreous anti -VEGF 271 
therapy alone or vitrectomy combined with intraoperative PRP each provide the oppor tunity to 272 
stabilize or regress retinal neovascularization.  However, clinical trials are lacking to elucidate 273 
the relative time frame of visual recovery or final visual outcome in prompt vitrectomy compared 274 
with initial anti -VEGF treatment.  The DRCR.net P rotocol N demonstrated short -term trends 275 
consistent with a possible beneficial effect of anti -VEGF treatment in eyes with VH from PDR, 276 
including greater VA improvement and reduced rates of recurrent VH as compared with saline 277 
injection.  It is possible tha t a study with a longer duration of follow -up with structured anti - 278 
VEGF retreatment would demonstrate even greater effectiveness of anti -VEGF for VH to avoid 279 
vitrectomy and its attendant adverse events while also improving visual acuity.  On the other 280 
hand , advances in surgical techniques leading to faster operative times, quicker patient recovery, 281 
and reduced complication rates may make prompt  vitrectomy a more attractive alternative since 282 
it results in the immediate ability to clear hemorrhage and to perf orm PRP if desired, often as 283 
part of one procedure.  This proposed study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of two treatment 284 
approaches for eyes with VH from PDR:  prompt vitrectomy + PRP and intravitreous aflibercept 285 
injections . 286 
1.2 Study Objectives  287 
The objectives of this study are to 1) evaluate and compare visual acuity outcomes over the 288 
course of the study of a prompt vitrectomy + PRP regimen and an intravitreous aflibercept  289 
regimen in eyes with VH from PDR for which intervention is deemed necessa ry, and 2) 290 
characterize the follow -up course for the two treatment regimens, including but not limited to 291 
post-operative complications for the vitrectomy group, and number of injections needed and 292 
percent requiring vitrectomy in the intravitreous afliberce pt group .   293 
1.3 Study Design and Synopsis of Protocol  294 
 295 
A. Study Design  296 
• Multi-center randomized clinical trial  297 
 298 
B. Major Eligibility Criteria  299 
• Age >=18 years  300 
• Type 1 or type 2 diabetes  301 
• Study eye with :  302 
o Vitreous hemorrhage causing vision impairment, presumed to be from 303 
proliferative diabetic retinopathy, for which intervention is deemed necessary  304 
• Note: Prior PRP is neither  a requirement nor an  exclusion  305 
o Best corrected visual acuity letter score 78 or worse (approximate Snellen 306 
equivalent 20/32 or worse)  with at least light perception  307 
• Investigators should use particular caution when considering enrollment 308 
of an eye with visual acuity letter score 78 to 69 (approximate Snellen 309 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  1-5  equivalent 20/32 to 20/40) to ensure that the need for vitrectomy and its 310 
potential  benefits outweigh the potential risks.   311 
o No evidence of  rhegmatogenous retinal detachment or evidence of traction retinal 312 
detachment involving or thre atening the macula  313 
• If the density of the hemorrhage precludes a visual  assessment on clinical 314 
exam  to confirm eligibility , then it is recommended that  assessment be 315 
performed  with ultrasound  as standard care . 316 
o No history of vitrectomy  317 
 318 
C. Treatment Groups  319 
Eligible eyes , one per participant,  will be assigned randomly (1:1) to one of the  following 320 
groups:  321 
 322 
A. Intravitreous  2 mg aflibercept injections  323 
B. Prompt vitrectomy  + PRP  324 
 325 
For the intravitreous  aflibercept  group, the initial injection must be given on the day of 326 
randomization.  Follow -up injections will be performed as often as every 4 weeks unless criteria 327 
for deferral are met (see section 4.3.1).  Vitrectomy and PRP can only be performed if protocol 328 
criteria are met (see sections 4.3.2 and 4.3.3). 329 
 330 
For the prompt vitrectomy + PRP  group, the vitrectomy must be scheduled to be  performed  331 
within 2 weeks of randomization.  Vitrectomy will be performed  according to the investigator’s 332 
usual routine , including pre -operative care, surgical procedure, and post -operative care , although 333 
anti-VEGF may not be given post-operatively unless there is recurrent hemorrhage (see section 334 
4.5.2). 335 
 336 
D. Sample Size  337 
A minimum of  200 study eyes , one per participant,  will be randomized.   338 
 339 
E. Duration of Follow -Up 340 
Primary outcome : 24 weeks  341 
Total duration : 104 weeks   342 
 343 
F. Follow -up Schedule  344 
➢ Outcome Visits:  345 
All participants in both groups will have visit s at the following times post-randomization : 346 
• Year 1: 4, 12, 24, 36, 52 wee ks 347 
• Year 2: 68 weeks, 84 weeks, 104 weeks  348 
 349 
It is recognized that the time between initial treatment and outcome visits will differ 350 
between the two groups due to the timing of the initial treatment; however, the 351 
differential timing of treatments is representative of clinical care in which anti -VEGF can 352 
be given immediately  and vitrectomy would need to be scheduled in advance.  Therefore, 353 
the area under the curve analysis will be representative of clinical care based on the time 354 
point that the decision is made to intervene.   355 
 356 
➢ Treatment Visits:  357 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  1-6  • Participants  receiving intravit reous aflibercept  also will have  treatment 358 
assessment visits  as often as every 4 weeks , depending on  recent  treatment 359 
administered.  360 
 361 
➢ Additional Visits:  362 
• Participants  undergoing vitrectomy will have a study visit 1 week post -vitrectomy 363 
for safety evaluation .  Investigators may schedule an initial  (e.g. 1 day) post- 364 
operative visit earlier as standard care  at their discretion . 365

G. Main Efficacy Outcome s 367 
 368 
Treatment Group Comparisons  369 
 370 
Primary Outcome:   Visual acuity area under the curve between randomization and 24 weeks   371 
 372 
Additional Key Outcomes (at 24, 52, and 104 weeks  unless otherwise indicated):  373 
• Visual acuity area under the curve between randomization and 52 and 104 weeks  374 
• Mean visual acuity at 4, 12, and 24 weeks, and annual visits  375 
• Percent 20/20 or better, 20/32 or better, 20/40 or better, 20/200 or worse, and 20/800 376 
or worse  at 4, 12, and 24 weeks, and annual visits   377 
• Proportion of eyes with at least 15 and at least 30 letter gains or losses from baseline  378 
• Rates of recurrent VH on clinical exam  379 
• Percentage of eyes with retinal neovascularization  380 
• Mean OCT central subfield thickness  381 
• Treatment and follow -up costs  382 
• Mean chan ge in four Workplace Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire 383 
(WPAI Q) scales and area under the curve analyses  of the Work Productivity Loss and  384 
Activity Impairment scales at 4, 12, and 24 weeks, and annual visits   385 
 386 
Key Outcomes within Treatment Groups  387 
• Percent undergoing  vitrectomy (initial vitrectomy in aflibercept  group or repeat 388 
vitrectomy in vitrectomy group)  389 
• Number of aflibercept  injections performed  390 
• Percent receiving PRP ( aflibercept  group only)  391 
 392 
The primary outcome of visual acuit y area under the curve at 24 weeks was primarily selected 393 
for sample size considerations.   The long -term additional key outcomes and within -group 394 
outcomes will be equally important as the area under the curve outcome for evaluating the 395 
overall follow -up co urse for these two treatment approaches.   Therefore, publication is not 396 
planned until the full 104 week follow -up has closed.   397

1.4 General Considerations  423 
The study is being conducted in compliance with the policies described in the DRCR.net Policies 424 
document, wi th the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki, with 425 
the protocol described herein, and with the standards of Good Clinical Practice.  426 
 427 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  1-8  The DRCR.net Procedures Manuals (Visual Acuity -Refraction Testing Procedures Manual, OCT  428 
Procedures Manual, and Study Procedures Manual) provide details of the examination 429 
procedures and intravitreous  injection procedure.   430 
 431 
Visual acuity testers will be masked to treatment group at all outcome  visits.  Investigators and 432 
study participants ar e not masked to treatment group.  433 
   434 
Data will be directly collected in electronic case report forms, which will be considered the 435 
source data.  436 
 437 
There is no restriction on the number of study participants to be enrolled by a site.  438 
 439 
A risk -based monitoring a pproach will be followed, consistent with the FDA “Guidance for 440 
Industry Oversight of Clinical Investigations — A Risk -Based Approach to Monitoring” (August 441 
2013).  442 
 443 
The risk level is considered to be research involving greater than minimal risk.  444 
 445 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  2-1                                                                                                                                     446 
CHAPTER 2.  STUDY PARTICIPANT ELIGIBILITY AND ENROLLMENT  447 
2.1 Identifying Eligible Participant s and Obtaining Informed Consent  448 
A minimum o f 200 eyes (1 per participant) are expected to be enrolled into the randomized trial.  449 
As the enrollment goal approaches, sites will be notified of the end date for recruitment.  Study 450 
participants who have signed an informed consent form can be randomized  up until the end date, 451 
which means the recruitment goal might be exceeded.   452 
 453 
Potential eligibility will be assessed as part of a routine -care examination.  Prior to completing 454 
any procedures or collecting any data that are not part of usual care, written  informed consent 455 
will be obtained.  For patients who are considered potentially eligible for the study based on a 456 
routine -care exam, the study protocol will be discussed with the potential study participant by a 457 
study investigator and clinic coordinator.  The potential study participant will be given the 458 
Informed Consent Form to read.  Potential study participants will be encouraged to discuss the 459 
study with family members and their personal physician(s) before deciding whether to participate 460 
in the study.    461 
 462 
Consent may be given in two stages (if approved by the IRB).  The initial stage will provide 463 
consent to complete any of the screening procedures needed to assess eligibility that have not 464 
already been performed as part of a usual -care exam.  The second  stage will be obtained prior to 465 
randomization and will be for participation in the study.  A single consent form will have two 466 
signature/date lines for the study participant:  one for a study participant to give consent for the 467 
completion of the screening  procedures and one for the study participant to document consent for 468 
the randomized trial.  Study participants will be provided with a copy of the signed Informed 469 
Consent Form.  470 
 471 
Once a study participant is randomized, that participant will be counted rega rdless of whether the 472 
assigned treatment is received.  Thus, the investigator must not proceed to randomize an 473 
individual until he/she is convinced that the individual is eligible and will accept assignment to 474 
either of the two treatment groups , including ability to undergo vitrectomy within 2 weeks of 475 
randomization .   476 
 477 
2.2 Participant  Eligibility Criteria  478 
2.2.1 Participant -level Criteria  479 
Inclusion  480 
To be eligible, the following inclusion criteria must be met:  481 
1. Age >= 18 years  482 
• Participant s <18 years old are not being included because proliferative diabetic 483 
retinopathy  is so rare in this age group that the diagnosis may be questionable.   484 
2. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2)  485 
• Any one of the following will be considered to be suf ficient evidence that diabetes is 486 
present:  487 
➢ Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes  488 
➢ Current regular use of oral anti -hyperglycemia agents for the treatment of diabetes  489 
➢ Documented diabetes by ADA and/or WHO criteria (see Procedures Manu al for 490 
definitions)  491 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  2-2  3. At least one eye meets the study eye criteria listed in section 2.2.2.  492 
4. Able and willing to provide informed consent.  493 
5. Patient is willing and able to undergo vitrectomy  within next 2 weeks  and the vitrectomy can 494 
be scheduled within that t ime frame . 495 
Exclusion  496 
A potential participant  is not eligible if any of the following exclusion criteria  are present:  497 
6. History of chronic renal failure requiring dialysis  (including placement of fistula  if performed 498 
in preparation for dialysis ) or kidney transplant . 499 
7. A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in the study 500 
(e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, and glycemic 501 
control).  502 
8. Initiation of  intensive insulin treatment (a pump or multiple daily injections) within 4 months 503 
prior to randomization or plan s to do so in the next 4 months.  504 
9. A condition that, in t he opinion of the investigator, would preclude participant  underg oing 505 
elective vitrectomy surgery if indicated during the study.  506 
10. Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of randomization that involved 507 
treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval for the indication being 508 
studied.  509 
• Note : participant s cannot receive another investigational drug while participating in the 510 
study.  511 
11. Known allergy to any component of the study drug  or any drug used in the injection prep  512 
(including povidone iodine).   513 
12. Blood pressure > 180/110 (systolic above 180 or diastolic above 110).  514 
• If blood pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti -hypertensive treatment, potential 515 
participant  can   become eligible.  516 
13. Systemic anti -VEGF or pro -VEGF treatment within 4 months prior to randomization.  517 
• These drugs cannot be used during the study.  518 
14. For women of child -bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant 519 
within the next two years . 520 
• Women who are potential participant s should be questioned about the potential for 521 
pregnancy.  Investigator judgment is used to determine when a pregnancy test is needed.  522 
15. Potential participant  is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center to an area not 523 
covered by another clinical center during the two years.  524 
 525 
2.2.2 Study Eye Criteria  526 
The participant  must have at least one eye meeting all of the inclusion criteria and none of the 527 
exclusion criteria listed below.   528 
 529 
A participant can have only one study eye.  If both eyes are eligible at the time of randomizatio n, 530 
the study eye will be selected by the investigator and participant before randomization.  531 
 532 
The eligibility criteria for a study eye  are as follows:  533 
 534 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  2-3  Inclusion  535 
a. Vitreous hemorrhage causing vision impairment, presumed to be from proliferative diabetic 536 
retinopathy, for which intervention is deemed necessary.   537 
• Note: Prior PRP is n either  a requirement nor an exclusion . 538 
• Subhyaloid hemorrhage alone does not make an eye eligible; however, presence of 539 
subhyaloid hemorrhage in addition to the criteria above will not preclude participation 540 
provided the investigator is comfortable with either treatment regimen.  541 
b. Immediate vitrectomy not required (investigator and participant  are willing to wait at least  4 542 
months  to see if hemorrhage clears sufficiently with anti -VEGF without having to proceed to 543 
vitrectomy ). 544 
c. Visual acuity  letter score ≤78 (approximate Snellen equi valent 20/32) and at least light 545 
perception .  546 
• Investigators should use particular caution when considering enrollment of an eye with 547 
visual acuity letter score 69 to 78 (approximate Snellen equivalent 20/32 to 20/40) to 548 
ensure that the need for vitrectomy and its potential  benefits outweigh the potential risks.   549 
 550 
Exclusion  551 
d. Evidence of traction detachment involving  or threatening  the macula .  552 
• If the density of the hemorrhage precludes a visual assessment on clinical exam to 553 
confirm eligibility, then it is recommended that assessment be performed with ultrasound 554 
as standard care.  555 
e. Evidence of r hegmatogenous  retinal detachment . 556 
• If the density of the hemorrhage precludes a visual assessment on clinical exam to 557 
confirm eligibility, then it is recommended that as sessment be performed with ultrasound 558 
as standard care.  559 
f. Evidence of neovascular glaucoma  (iris or angle neovascularization is not an exclusion) . 560 
g. Known diabetic macular edema (DME), defined as  either  561 
i. OCT central subfield thickness (microns):  562 
1. Zeiss Cirrus: ≥ 290 in women ; ≥305 in men  563 
2. Heidelberg Spectralis: ≥ 305 in women ; ≥320 in men   564 
OR 565 
ii. DME on clinical exam that the investigator believes currently requires treatment .  566 
h. History of intravitreous  anti-VEGF  treatment  within 2 months prior to current vitreo us 567 
hemorrhage onset  or after onset .   568 
i. History of intraocular corticosteroid treatment  within 4 months prior to current vitreous 569 
hemorrhage onset  or after onset .   570 
j. History of major ocular surgery (including cataract extraction, scleral buckle, any intraocular 571 
surgery, etc.) within prior 4 months or major ocular surgery other than vitrectomy anticipated 572 
within the next 6 months following randomization.  573 
k. History of vit rectomy . 574 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  2-4  l. History of YAG capsulotomy performed within 2 months prior to randomization.  575 
m. Aphakia.  576 
n. Uncontrolled glaucoma (in investigator’s judgment) . 577 
o. Exam evidence of severe external ocular infection, including conjunctivitis, chalazion, or 578 
substantial bleph aritis.  579 
 580 
2.2.3 Non -Study Eye Criteria  581 
If anti -VEGF treatment is indicated for any condition in the non -study eye at any time during the 582 
study, the investigator must be willing to use the study anti -VEGF drug (2 mg aflibercept) for the 583 
non-study eye.  If th e non -study eye is currently being treated with a different anti -VEGF drug 584 
for any condition, then the investigator and patient must be willing to switch to aflibercept.  If 585 
the investigator or patient is unwilling to change anti -VEGF treatment in the non -study eye, the 586 
patient should not be enrolled.     587 
 588 
2.3 Screening Evaluation and Baseline Testing  589 
2.3.1 Historical Information  590 
A history will be elicited from the participant  and extracted from available medical records.  591 
Data to be collected will include:  age, gender, ethnicity and race, diabetes history and current 592 
management, other medical conditions, medications being used, as well as  ocular diseases, 593 
surgeries, and treat ment.  594 
2.3.2 Baseline Testing Procedures  595 
The following procedures are needed to assess eligibility and/or to serve as baseline measures for 596 
the study.   597 
• If a procedure has been performed (using the study technique and by study certified 598 
personnel) as part o f usual care, it does not need to be repeated specifically for the study 599 
if it was performed within the defined time windows specified below.  600 
• The testing procedures are detailed in the DRCR.net Procedures Manuals (Visual Acuity - 601 
Refraction Testing Procedur es Manual and Study Procedures Manual) .  Visual acuity 602 
testing  and ocular exam will be performed by DRCR.net certified personnel.  603 
 604 
1. Electronic -ETDRS visual acuity testing at 3 meters using the Electronic Visual Acuity Tester 605 
(including protocol refraction)  in each eye . (on day of randomization)  606 
➢ If the E-ETDRS visual acuity letter score is 0, then counting fingers, hand motion, 607 
and light perception are assessed.  608 
2. Workplace Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire ( on day of randomization ).  609 
3. OCT on the study eye (within 8 days prior to randomization )  610 
➢ Unless  insufficient view precludes obtaining an accurate measurement  611 
4. Ocular examination of each eye including slit lamp, measurement of intraocular pressure, 612 
lens assessment, and dilated ophthal moscopy  (on day of randomization ) 613 
5. B-Scan ultrasound as part of standard care on the study eye  if the density of the vitreous 614 
hemorrhage precludes assessment of traction or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment  615 
6. Measurement of blood pressure  616 
7. Laboratory testing - HbA1c  617 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16  2-5  ➢ HbA1c  does not need to be repeated if available in the prior 3 months.  If not 618 
available at the time of randomization, the participant  may be enrolled but the test 619 
must be obtained within 3 weeks after randomization.   620 
2.4 Enrollment/Randomization of Eligible Participant s  621 
1. Prior to randomization, the participant ’s understanding of the trial, willingness to accept the 622 
assigned treatment group, and commitment to the follow -up schedule should be reconfirmed.  623 
2. The baseline inj ection must be given on the day of randomization  and vitrectomy must be 624 
performed within 2 weeks, depending on treatment group ; therefore, a participant  should not 625 
be randomized until this is possible.    626 
3. Randomization is completed on the DRCR .net website.   627 
• Study eye s will be randomly assigned  (stratified by site) with equal probability to one of 628 
two treatment groups:  629 
o Group A: Intravitreous  2 mg aflibercept  injections  630 
o Group B: Prompt vitrectomy  + PRP 631

CHAPTER 3.  FOLLOW -UP VISITS AND TESTING                                                                                                                                       634 
3.1 Visit Schedule  635 
The schedule of protocol -specified follow -up visits  is as follows : 636 
 637 
➢ Outcome Visits:  638 
All participants in both groups will have visit at the following time points post - 639 
randomization:  640 
• Year 1: 4 (±1) weeks, 12 (±4) weeks, 24(±4) weeks, 36 (±4) weeks, 52(±4) weeks  641 
• Year 2: 68 (±4) weeks, 84  (±4) weeks, 104  (±4) weeks  642 
 643 
➢ Vitreous Hemorrhage Treatment Assessment Visits:  644 
 645 
Aflibercept  Group  646 
Participants in the aflibercept  group , will have  treatment assessment visits as often as 647 
every 4 weeks, depending on treatment administered:  648 
• Visits every 4±1 weeks for the first 24 weeks and as long as injections are given 649 
(with a minimum of 21 days between injections).  650 
• After 24 weeks, if the injection is deferred at the current and previous 2 visits (see 651 
section 4. 3.1 for retreatment criteria), the next study follow -up visit is in twice the 652 
time since the last visit up to a maximum of 16 weeks between visits.  Otherwise, 653 
the next study follow -up visit is in 4 weeks.  654 
 655 
Vitrectomy Group  656 
Eyes for which  aflibercept  is initiated for recurrent hemorrhage post -vitrectomy wil l 657 
have treatment assessment visits as often as every 4 weeks until the hemorrhage has 658 
cleared or repeat vitrectomy is performed (see section 4.5.2). 659 
 660 
➢ DME Treatment Visits  661 
• If aflibercept  for DME has been initiated, follow -up visits for DME treatment occur 662 
every 4 weeks for the first 24 weeks  from initial aflibercept  treatment for DME. After 663 
24 weeks , if the injection is deferred at the current and previous 2 visits  (see section 664 
4.7 for retrea tment criteria) , the next study follow -up visit is in twice the time since 665 
the last visit up to a maximum of 16 weeks between visits.  Otherwise, the next study 666 
follow -up visit is in 4 weeks.  667 
 668 
➢ Additional Protocol Visits:  669 
Participants undergoing vitrectomy  will have a study visit 1 week (±3 days) post - 670 
vitrectomy for safety evaluation  only. Investigators may schedule an initial  (e.g. 1 day) 671 
post-operative visit  earlier  as standard care.   672 
 673 
Additional visits may occur as required for usual care of the study participant.  674 
3.2 Testing Procedures  675 
The 1 -week post -operative visit will include a safety evaluation only.  Otherwise, t he following 676 
procedures will be performed at each protocol -specified  visit on the study eye only , unless 677 
otherwise specified.  A grid in section 1.3 summarizes the testing performed at each visit.   678 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16       3-2  679 
1. E-ETDRS visual acuity testing (best corrected)  in each eye.  680 
• A protocol refraction  in the study eye  is required at Outcome V isits (listed above) and 681 
DME treatment visits .  Refraction in the non -study eye is only required at annual visits.  682 
When a refraction is not performed, the most recently performed refraction is used for the 683 
testing.  684 
2. Workplace Productivity and Activi ty Impairment Questionnaire (WPAIQ) at all outcome 685 
visits (listed above) .  686 
3. OCT at the 24-week  visit, annual visits , and DME treatment visits only.  687 
➢ Unless insufficient view precludes obtaining an accurate measurement .   688 
4. Ocular exam, including slit lamp examination (including lens assessment), measurement of 689 
intraocular pressure, and dilated ophthalmoscopy .  690 
• Undilated exam of the iris is at the discretion of the investigator; examination of the 691 
angle is required if neovasc ularization of the iris is present or increased IOP (defined 692 
as one of the following: a) IOP ≥ 30mm Hg b) first time IOP has increased at least 693 
10mm Hg since baseline c) IOP has increased at least 10mm Hg since last visit or d) 694 
IOP lowering medication init iated since last visit).  695 
5. B-Scan ultrasound as needed as part of standard care  if vitreous hemorrhage precludes ability 696 
to assess for traction  or rhegmatogenous  retinal detachment . 697 
 698 
6. Laboratory testing of Hemoglobin A1c  at the 24-week  visit and annual visits only.  699 
• HbA1c does not need to be repeated if available in the prior 3 months.  700 
7. Blood pressure at the 24-week  visit and annual visits only.  701 
 702 
All of the testing procedures do not need to be performed on the same day, provided that they are 703 
completed within the time window of a visit and prior to initiating any retreatment.  704 
 705 
Testing procedures at unscheduled visits are at investigator discretion .  However, it is 706 
recommended that procedures that are performed should follow the standard DRCR.net protocol 707 
for each procedure  708 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16       4-1 CHAPTER 4.  TREATMENT REGIMEN     709 
4.1 Introduction  710 
All study eyes will be randomly assigned to one of the following two treatment groups:    711 
• Intravitreous  2 mg aflibercept injections   712 
• Prompt vitrectomy  + PRP  713 
 714 
For the intravitreous  aflibercept  group, the initial injection must be given on the day of 715 
randomization.  Follow -up injections will be performed as often as every 4 weeks according to 716 
the retreatment criteria below.  Vitrectomy and PRP can only be performed if protocol criteria 717 
are met.  718 
 719 
For the prompt vitrectomy  + PRP  group, the vitrectomy must be scheduled within 2 weeks of 720 
randomization.  The vitrectomy procedure and follow -up treatment are described below.  721 
 722 
4.2 Intravitreous Injections  723 
4.2.1 Inravitreous Aflibercept Injection (Eylea®)  724 
Eylea® (intravitreal aflibercept injection) is made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and is 725 
approved by the FDA for the treatment of neovascular age -related macular degeneration, 726 
macular edema due to central retinal vein occlusion, macular edema  due to branch retinal vein 727 
occlusion, diabetic macular edema, and diabetic retinopathy in eyes with diabetic macular 728 
edema.   729 
 730 
Study eyes that receive anti -VEGF will receive a dose of 2 mg aflibercept in 0.05 cc each time a 731 
study injection is performed.  The physical, chemical and pharmaceutical properties and 732 
formulation are provided in the Clinical Investigator Brochure. Aflibercept for the study and 733 
non-study eye will be distributed by the Network.  734 
 735 
4.2.2 Intravitreous  Injection Technique  736 
The injection is preceded by a povidone iodine prep of the conjunctiva.  In general, topical 737 
antibiotics in the pre -, peri -, or post -injection period should not  be used.   738 
 739 
The injection will be performed using sterile technique.  The f ull injection procedure is described 740 
in the DRCR.net Study Procedures Manual.  741 
 742 
4.2.3 Delay in Giving Injections  743 
If a scheduled injection is not given by the end of the visit window, it can still be given up to 1 744 
week prior to the next visit window opening.   If it is not given by that time, it will be considered 745 
missed.  746 
 747 
If an injection is given late, the next scheduled injection should occur no sooner than 3 weeks 748 
after the previous injection.  749 
 750 
4.2.4 Deferral of Injections Due to Pregnancy  751 
Female study participants of child -bearing age must be questioned regarding the possibility of 752 
pregnancy prior to each injection. In the event of pregnancy, study injections must be 753 
discontinued during the pregnancy and any post -partum period of breastfeed ing.   754 
 755 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16       4-2 4.2.5  Non-Study Eye Injections  756 
If the non -study eye is going to be treated for any condition which requires treatment with an 757 
anti-VEGF agent, study provided aflibercept must be used.  However, if intravitreous treatment 758 
is planned on the same day as an intravitreous injection in the study eye, the study eye will be 759 
injected first, followed by the non -study eye (see Procedures Manual for additional details).  If a 760 
non-study anti -VEGF medication is desired to be administered by intravitreous inje ction in the 761 
non-study eye, a discussion with the Protocol Chair is required first.  762 
 763 
4.3 Aflibercept  Group Follow -Up Treatment  764 
4.3.1 Retreatment with Intravitreous Injections of Aflibercept for Vitreous Hemorrhage 765 
and underlying PDR  766 
All eyes will receive a n injection of aflibercept at the 4 -week , 8-week  and 12-week visits, unless 767 
an adverse event precludes treatment.  768 
  769 
Starting at the 16-week visit, eyes with no c ontraindication to additional aflibercept  injections 770 
will be evaluated for retreatment based on the status of the hemorrhage and neovascularization.  771 
In general, the eye will receive an injection at each treatment assessment visit unless one of the 772 
below criteria is met :  773 
1. Success: t he vitreous hemorrhage has suff iciently cleared such that there is an 774 
adequate view of the entire fundus and neovascularization  is absent  775 
➢ Injection is deferred.  776 
2. Stability: it has been at least 24 weeks  since the initial injection, the eye has received 777 
at least 2 prior consecutive inject ions, and the size and density of the hemorrhage and 778 
any neovascularization is clinically unchanged since the last visit.   779 
➢ Injection is deferred.  780 
3. A vitrectomy has already been performed  781 
➢ Eyes in the aflibercept  group that receive vitrectomy will follow the intra - and 782 
post-operative anti -VEGF treatme nt regimen described in sections 4.4 and 783 
4.5.2 for the Vitrectomy Group.  784 
 785 
4.3.2 PRP during Follow -Up 786 
PRP must not be given unless failure criteria are met  (see below for cases that first require 787 
discussion with the Protocol Chair or Coordinating Center designee ).  In addition, if any future 788 
treatment with aflibercept  is contraindicated based on a previous adverse reaction, treatment with 789 
PRP for PDR is at investi gator discretion after discussion with and approval from the Protocol 790 
Chair or Coordinating Center designee.   791 
 792 
• Failure criteria are defined as  793 
1. growth of NV or new NV of the retina, disc OR iris since the last visit such that 794 
the NV, including fibrosis, i s greater than when first adequately visualized  and at 795 
least 4 study injections have been given over the previous 4 months.  The 796 
investigator may perform PRP.   797 
 798 
OR 799 
 800 
2. New or worsened NV of the angle* has developed since the last visit. The 801 
investigator may perform PRP.   802 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16       4-3  803 
OR  804 
 805 
3. definite worsening of NV or fibrous proliferation of the retina, disc OR iris at 806 
least 1 day after the last injection that the investigator believes is likely to lead to 807 
substantial vision loss if PRP is not performed within 1 week.  P RP may only be 808 
performed after discussion with and approval from the Protocol Chair or 809 
Coordinating Center designee.  810 
 811 
4.3.3 Vitrectomy during Follow -Up 812 
Vitrectomy may be performed in the aflibercept  group according to the criteria below.  See 813 
section 4.4 regarding the vitrectomy procedure. Eyes in the aflibercept  group that undergo 814 
vitrectomy must also receive intraoperative PRP  until “complete” .   815 
 816 
4.3.3.1 Prior to 16 Weeks  817 
Vitrectomy prior to 16 we eks should not be performed unless one of the following is present:  818 
➢ Traction retinal detachment involving (within 1 disc diameter) or actively  threatening the 819 
macula  820 
➢ Rhegmatogenous  retinal detachment  821 
➢ Neovascular glaucoma resulting in increased intraocula r pressure that cannot be 822 
controlled medically,  angle neovascularization, or progressive neovascularization of the 823 
iris (at least 2 clock hours)  824 
➢ Ghost cell glaucoma resulting in increased intraocular pressure that cannot be controlled 825 
medically  826 
 827 
If other circumstances develop for which vitrectomy is being considered prior to 16 weeks , the 828 
Protocol Chair will be contacted for approval.  829 
 830 
4.3.3.2 At and After 16 weeks  831 
After the 16 week visit, vitrectomy may be performed (but is not required) if there is 1) persistent 832 
vitreous hemorrhage causing vision impairment and 2) the eye has received at least 2 consecutive 833 
prior injections.  However, if this is the 3rd or more time the hemorrhage recurred after a period 834 
of clearance  during the study , vitrectomy may be performed at investigator discretion without 835 
first performing 2 additional injections.   836 
 837 
If the investigator believes vitrectomy is required for the safety of the participant and the study 838 
eye does not meet these criteria, protocol chair approval is requi red to proceed.   839 
 840 
4.4 Vitrectomy  841 
For study eyes receiving vitrectomy, vitrectomy will be performed  according to the 842 
investigator’s usual routine , including pre -operative care, surgical procedure, and post -operative 843 
care. However, a 23 or smaller gauge vitrectomy system must be used (20 gauge is not 844 
permitted).   845 
 846 
Optional additional procedures at the discretion of the investigator  include, but are not limited to : 847 
• Removal of the internal limiting membrane.  848 
• Use of agents to improve visual ization of membranes, (e.g. triamcinolone acetonide , 849 
indocyanine  green dye , or other staining agents).  850 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16       4-4 • Use of corticosteroids ( intravitreous , sub -tenon’s, sub -conjunctival) at the close of the 851 
procedure.  852 
• Cataract extraction.  853 
 854 
Study i ntravitreous  aflibercept  may be given pre -operatively , but then should not be given 855 
thereafter unless there is recurrent hemorrhage (see section 4.5.2 below) . If pre -op aflibercept  is 856 
given, it is strongly recommended that it be  given  between 1 day to  1 we ek prior to  the 857 
procedure , although it can be administered up to 2 weeks prior if necessary .   858 
     859 
4.4.1 Vitreous and Aqueous Sample Collection  860 
Participation in the ancillary sample collection component  is not a requirement for participation 861 
in this study .  It is expected that sites with the capability  to obtain and ship intraocular fluids  will 862 
participate.  At the time of consent into the main study, participants will have the option of 863 
signing the anci llary sample collection portion of the informed consent form to indicate their 864 
willingness to provide either a vitreous sample only (at least 1 cc of undiluted vitreous collected 865 
during the vitrectomy procedure) or to provide both vitreous and an additiona l aqueous sample 866 
(requiring an additional anterior paracentesis to collect at least 0.1 cc of aqueous fluid).    867 
 868 
If consent for vitreous and/or aqueous sampling is obtained, the sample(s) will be collected and 869 
shipped on dry ice to a central laboratory fo r storage until analyses are completed.  Details 870 
regarding  collection,  sample  labeling, storage, and  shipment can be found in the  ancillary  study 871 
procedures manual . 872 
 873 
4.4.2 Deferral  or Cancellation  of Surgery  in the Vitrectomy Group  874 
Surgery may be cancelled  if there is substantial improvement in vitreous hemorrhage such that 875 
visual acuity is no longer affected.  876 
 877 
If surgery is postponed  for reasons other than substantial vitreous hemorrhage improvement , it 878 
should be re-scheduled as soon as possible . 879 
 880 
Whether s urgery is deferred or cancelled, protocol follow -up visits will continue as scheduled 881 
based on time from randomization.   882 
 883 
4.5 Vitrectomy Group Intra - and Post -Operative Treatment  884 
4.5.1 Panretinal Photocoagulation in the Vitrectomy Group  885 
PRP should be placed to the extent that it is considered “complete”.   “Complete ” PRP is defined 886 
as 500 micron size burns on the retina placed no further than 1 to 2 burn widths apart beginning 887 
~3000 microns from the macular center and extending at least to the equator for 12 clock hours . 888 
See procedures manual for additional details, i ncluding use of automated pattern.  889 
 890 
If it is determined during surgery that the eye has already received “complete ” PRP, further PRP 891 
treatment is not required.   PRP treatment can be performed using the investigator’s standard 892 
procedure and may include indi rect delivery.     893 
 894 
If the size or amount of neovascularization increases following completion of the initial PRP 895 
session, additional PRP should be given if possible.  Aflibercept  may be given for 896 
neovascularization in the absence of recurrent hemorrhage after discussion with the protocol 897 
chair  (see below  for treatment of recurrent hemorrhage from NV) .       898 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16       4-5  899 
4.5.2 Treatment for Recurrent Vitreous Hemorrhage in the Vitrectomy Group  900 
If there is recurrent hemorrhage, no treatment should be given within the first 4 weeks post- 901 
vitrectomy.  After 4 weeks,  if the investigator determines there is recurrent hemorrhage from 902 
neovascularization, two  injection s of study aflibercept will be  given, 4 (±1) weeks apart .  903 
Additional aflibercept  may be given every 4(±1) weeks thereafter, at the discretion of the 904 
investigator.   Repeat vitrectomy (or air/fluid exchange) may only be performed if the recurrent 905 
hemorrhage has not cleared  after at least  2 consecutive 4 -week injections .  Otherwise, protocol 906 
chair approval is required to re -operate.    907 
 908 
4.6 Cataract Surgery  (Both Groups)  909 
Investigators should evaluate lens changes throughout the course of follow -up and consider 910 
cataract surgery (or referral  for possible cataract surgery) when a lens change is thought to be 911 
visually significant  based on the investigator’s judgment.  If the visual potential of the study eye 912 
is unknown, the investigator should assume that there is potential for clinically relev ant 913 
improvement in vision.  Cataract surgery may be performed as part of the surgeon’s usual 914 
routine.  Limited data will be collected for the study.   915 
4.7 Treatment for Diabetic Macular Edema (Both Groups)  916 
No anti -VEGF should be given for DME within 6 week s of the initial randomized treatment. For 917 
post-surgical edema, steroid drops or other alternatives may be given at the discretion of the 918 
investigator.  After 6 weeks , if DME is present  (OCT CSF above gender and OCT machine - 919 
specific thresholds and investig ator has confirmed thickening is due to diabetic macular edema 920 
and not post -surgical macular edema or other cause)  and vision is 20/32 or worse, treatment with 921 
intravitreous aflibercept  and deferred  focal/grid laser will be given , using the DRCR.net 922 
intravitreous anti -VEGF retreatment protocol  (section 4.7.1 below).  923 
 924 
For eyes with DME and best-corrected visual acuity  better than 20/32, protocol chair approval is 925 
required to initiate anti -VEGF treatment.  Once initiated, the DRCR.net intravitr eous anti -VEGF 926 
retreatment protocol regimen must be followed.   927 
 928 
4.7.1. Intravitreous  Injection Re treatment for DME  929 
Once aflibercept  treatment has been initiated for DME, the eye will be evaluated at each visit for 930 
retreatment. In general, an eye will cont inue to receive an injection if the eye is improving or 931 
worsening on OCT or visual acuity. The first time an eye has not improved or worsened  the eye 932 
will receive an injection.  If the eye has not improved or worsened for at least 2 consecutive 4 - 933 
week inje ctions and the OCT CSF thickness is less than the gender specific spectral domain OCT 934 
threshold (see below) and visual acuity is 20/20 or better, then injection will be deferred.  If the 935 
eye has not improved or worsened for at least 2 consecutive 4 -week vi sits and the OCT CSF 936 
thickness is ≥ the gender specific spectral domain OCT threshold or visual acuity is worse than 937 
20/20, the following will be done:  938 
• If less than 24 weeks from the initial injection for DME, an injection will be given.  939 
• At and after 24 we eks, the injection will be deferred.  940 
 941 
The protocol chair or designee must be contacted prior to deviation from the injection protocol.  942 
See the DRCR.net Procedure Manual for additional details.  943 
 944 
Spectral domain OCT central subfield gender -specific threshol d: 945 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16       4-6 ➢ Zeiss Cirrus : 290 microns in women, and 305 microns in men  946 
➢ Heidelberg Spectralis : 305 microns in women, and 320 microns in men  947 
 948 
4.7.2. Focal/Grid Laser Treatment for DME  949 
In general, focal/grid laser will be initiated at or after 24 week s from the initial injection for 950 
DME  if 1) the OCT  central subfield thickness is greater than the OCT central subfield gender - 951 
specific threshold (above) or there is edema that is threatening the fovea and 2) the eye has not 952 
improved on OCT or visual acuity from the l ast two consecutive injections.  Once focal/grid 953 
laser has been initiated, retreatment with focal/grid laser will be given unless one of the 954 
following is present: 1) focal/grid laser has been given in the previous 13 weeks, 2) complete 955 
focal/grid laser has  already been given in the investigator’s judgment, 3) the OCT central 956 
subfield thickness is less than the OCT central subfield gender -specific threshold (above) and 957 
there is no edema threatening the fovea, 4) the eye has improved since the last laser trea tment. 958 
The protocol chair or designee must be contacted prior to deviating from the focal/grid laser 959 
protocol.  See the DRCR.net Procedure Manual for additional details.  960

MISCELLANEOUS CONSIDERATIONS IN FOLLOW -UP 964 
 965 
5.1 Endophthalmitis  966 
Diagnosis of endophthalmitis  following intravitreous  injections  is based on investigator’s 967 
judgment.  A culture is required prior to initiating antibiotic treatment for presumed 968 
endophthalmitis.   969 
5.2 Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy  in Non -study Eye  970 
Treatment of diabetic retinopathy , including DME,  in the non -study eye is at investigator 971 
discretion. However, if anti -VEGF treatment will be given in the non -study eye, study aflibercept 972 
must be used.  973 
5.3 Use of Intravitreal Anti -VEGF for Conditions Other than DME in the Study Eye  974 
If an ocular condition other than DME or DR develops in the study eye for which aflibercept is 975 
an FDA approved treatment (e.g. neovascular AMD, macular edema following central retinal 976 
vein occlusion), the use of study aflibercept is at the discretion of the investigator.  Any off -label 977 
use of anti -VEGF in the study eye for an ocular condition other than DR, will require discussion 978 
with and approval by the protocol chair or designee. Study aflibercept must be used for any anti - 979 
VEGF treatment in the study eye.    980 
5.4 Diabetes Management  981 
Diabetes management is left to the study participant’s medical care provider.  982 
5.5 Study Participant Withdrawal and Losses to Follow -up 983 
A study participant has the right to withdraw from the study at any time.  If a study participant is 984 
consideri ng withdrawal from the study, the principal investigator should personally speak to the 985 
individual about the reasons, and every effort should be made to accommodate him or her.   986 
 987 
The goal for the study is to have as few losses to follow -up as possible.  T he Coordinating Center 988 
will assist in the tracking of study participants who cannot be contacted by the site.  The 989 
Coordinating Center will be responsible for classifying a study participant as lost to follow -up. 990 
 991 
Study participants who withdraw will be as ked to have a final closeout visit at which the testing 992 
described for the protocol visits will be performed.  Study participants who have an adverse 993 
effect attributable to a study treatment or procedure will be asked to continue in follow -up until 994 
the adve rse event has resolved or stabilized.  995 
 996 
Study participants  who withdraw or are determined to have been ineligible post -randomization 997 
will not be replaced.  998 
5.6 Discontinuation of Study  999 
The study may be discontinued by the Executive Committee (with approval o f the Data and 1000  
Safety Monitoring Committee) prior to the preplanned completion of follow -up for all study 1001  
participants . 1002  
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16       5-2 5.7 Contact Information Provided to the Coordinating Center  1003  
The Coordinating Center will be provided with contact information for each s tudy participant.  1004  
Permission to obtain such information will be included in the Informed Consent Form.  The 1005  
contact information may be maintained in a secure database and will be maintained separately 1006  
from the study data.  1007  
 1008  
Phone contact from the Coordinat ing Center will be made with each study participant in the first 1009  
month after enrollment, and approximately every six months thereafter.  Additional phone 1010  
contacts from the Coordinating Center will be made if necessary to facilitate the scheduling of 1011  
the st udy participant for follow -up visits.  A participant -oriented newsletter may be sent twice a 1012  
year.  A study logo item may be sent once a year.  1013  
 1014  
Study participants will be provided with a summary of the study results in a newsletter format 1015  
after completion  of the study by all participants.   1016  
5.8 Study Participant Reimbursement  1017  
The study will be providing  the study participant  with a  $25 merchandise or money card  per 1018  
completed protocol visit.   Additional travel expenses may be paid in cases for participants with 1019  
higher expenses. In situations of financial hardship supplemental funds for patient expenses may 1020  
be available on a case by case basis. 1021

ADVERSE EVENTS  1024  
 1025  
6.1 Definition  1026  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a study participant, irrespective of 1027  
whether or not the event is considered treatment -related.  1028  
 1029  
6.2 Recording of Adverse Events  1030  
Throughout the course of the study, all efforts will be made to remain alert to possible adverse 1031  
events or untoward findings.  The first concern will be the safety of the study partici pant, and 1032  
appropriate medical intervention will be made.  1033  
 1034  
All adverse events whether volunteered by the participant , discovered by study personnel during 1035  
questioning, or detected through physical examination, laboratory test, or other means will be 1036  
reporte d on an adverse event form online.  Each adverse event form is reviewed by the 1037  
Coordinating Center  to verify the coding and the reporting that is required.   1038  
 1039  
The study investigator will assess the relationship of any adverse event to be related or unrelate d 1040  
by determining if there is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have been caused 1041  
by the treatment (including treatment of the non -study eye with study treatment).  1042  
 1043  
To ensure consistency of adverse event causality assessments, investigators  should apply the 1044  
following general guideline when determining whether an adverse event is related:  1045  
 1046  
Yes 1047  
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the adverse event and 1048  
administration of the study treatment, and the adverse event cann ot be readily explained by the 1049  
participant ’s clinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the adverse event 1050  
follows a known pattern of response to the study treatment; and/or the adverse event abates or 1051  
resolves upon discontinuati on of the study treatment or dose reduction and, if applicable, 1052  
reappears upon re -challenge.  1053  
 1054  
No 1055  
Evidence exists that the adverse event has an etiology other than the study treatment (e.g., 1056  
preexisting medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent il lness, or concomitant 1057  
medication); and/or the adverse event has no plausible temporal relationship to study treatment 1058  
administration (e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after first dose of study drug).    1059  
 1060  
The intensity of adverse events will be rated on a thre e-point scale: (1) mild, (2) moderate, or (3) 1061  
severe.  It is emphasized that the term severe is a measure of intensity: thus, a severe adverse 1062  
event is not necessarily serious. For example, itching for several days may be rated as severe, but 1063  
may not be cl inically serious.  1064  
 1065  
Adverse events will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary.  1066  
 1067  
Definitions of relationship and intensity are listed on the DRCR .net website data entry form.   1068  
 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16    6-2  1069  
Adverse events that continue after the study participant’s discontinuation or completion of the 1070  
study will be followed until their medical outcome is determined or until no further change in the 1071  
condition is expected.   1072  
 1073  
6.3 Reporting Serious or Unexpected  Adverse Events  1074  
A serious adverse event is any untoward occurrence that:  1075  
• Results in death.  1076  
• Is life -threatening; (a non -life-threatening event which, had it been more severe, might have 1077  
become life -threatening, is not necessarily considered a serious advers e event).  1078  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  1079  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability 1080  
to conduct normal life functions (sight threatening).  1081  
• Is a congeni tal anomaly or birth defect.  1082  
• Is considered a significant medical event by the investigator based on medical judgment (e.g., 1083  
may jeopardize the participant or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of 1084  
the outcomes listed above).  1085  
 1086  
Unexpecte d adverse events are those that are not identified in nature, severity, or frequency in 1087  
the current Clinical Investigator’s Brochure.   1088  
 1089  
Serious or unexpected adverse events must be reported to the Coordinating Center immediately 1090  
via completion of the onli ne serious adverse event form. If the study participant required 1091  
hospitalization, the hospital discharge summary must also be sent to the Coordinating Center.   1092  
 1093  
The Coordinating Center will notify all participating investigators of any adverse event that is 1094  
both serious and unexpected.  Notification will be made within 10 days after the Coordinating 1095  
Center becomes aware of the event.   1096  
  1097  
Each principal investigator is responsible for reporting serious study -related adverse events and 1098  
abiding by any other r eporting requirements specific to their Institutional Review Board.  1099  
 1100  
6.4 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee Review of Adverse Events  1101  
A Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) will approve the protocol, template informed 1102  
consent form, and substantive amendments and provide independent monitoring of adverse 1103  
events.  Cumulative adverse event data are tabulated semi -annually for review by the DSMC.  1104  
Following each DSMC data review, a summary will be provided to IRBs.  A list of specific 1105  
adverse events to be reported expeditiously to the DSMC will be compiled and included as part 1106  
of the DSMC Standard Operating Procedures document.   1107  
 1108  
6.5 Risks  1109  
6.5.1 Potential Adverse Effects of Aflibercept  1110  
The most common adverse reactions (≥5%) reported in  patients receiving aflibercept  were 1111  
conjunctival hemorrhage, eye pain, cataract, vitreous  floaters, i ntraocular pressure increased, 1112  
vitreous detachment , and vitreous floaters .   1113  
 1114  
Serious adverse reactions related to the injection procedure have  occurred in <0.1% of 1115  
intravitreal injections with aflibercept  including endophthalmitis and retinal detachment.  1116  
 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16    6-3  1117  
 1118  
Safety data specific to the diabetes p opulation  were published from phase III studies VISTA and 1119  
VIVID, which included 872 eyes  with DME  with central involvement that received either 1120  
intravitreal aﬂibercept every 4 weeks , intravitreal aflibercept every 8 weeks after 5 initial 1121  
monthly doses , or macular laser photocoagulation.   Overall, the incidences of ocular and non - 1122  
ocular adverse events were similar across treatment groups at 52 weeks.32  The incidence of 1123  
APTC -defined thromboembolic events was similar across treatment groups.  There were no 1124  
reported cases of endophthalmitis, and intraocular inflammation occurred in less than 1% of 1125  
injections.  Thr ough 100 weeks, an integrated safety analysis found that the most frequent 1126  
serious ocular adverse event was cataract (2.4% and 1.0% in the aflibercept groups compared 1127  
with 0.3% in the laser group).33   The incidence of APTC ATEs in VISTA  and VIVID  1128  
during the  100 weeks study duration was 6.4% (37out of 578) in the combined EYLEA groups 1129  
compared with 4.2% (12 out of 287) in the control group.33 1130  
 1131  
There may be side effects and discomforts that are not yet known.   1132  
 1133  
6.5.2 Potential Adverse Effects of Intravitreous  Injection  1134  
Rarely, the drugs used to anesthetize the eye before the injections (proparacaine, tetracaine, or 1135  
xylocaine) can cause an allergic reaction, seizures, and an irregular heartbeat less than 1% of 1136  
the time.   1137  
 1138  
Sub-conjunctival hemorrhage or floaters will commonly occur as a re sult of the intravitreous  1139  
injection.  Mild discomfort, ocular hyperemia, increased lacrimation, discharge or itching lasting 1140  
for up to a few days is also likely (more than 10% of the time).  1141  
 1142  
Immediately following the injection, there may be elevation of in traocular pressure. It usually 1143  
returns to normal spontaneously, but may need to be treated with topical drugs or a 1144  
paracentesis to lower the pressure.  The likelihood of permanent loss of vision from elevated 1145  
intraocular pressure is less than 1%.  1146  
 1147  
As a result of the injection, endophthalmitis (infection in the eye) could develop.  If this occurs, it is 1148  
treated by intravitreous  injection of antibiotics, but there is a risk of permanent loss of vision including 1149  
blindness. The risk of endophthalmitis i s less than 1%.  1150  
 1151  
As a result of the injection, a retinal detachment could occur.  If this occurs, surgery may be 1152  
needed to repair the retina.  The surgery is usually successful at reattaching the retina.  1153  
However, a retinal detachment can produce permanent  loss of vision and even blindness.  The 1154  
risk of retinal detachment is less than 1%.  1155  
 1156  
The injection could cause a vitreous hemorrhage.  Usually the blood will resolve 1157  
spontaneously, but if not, surgery may be needed to remove the blood.  Although the surge ry 1158  
usually successfully removes the blood, there is a small risk of permanent loss of vision and 1159  
even blindness.  The risk of having a vitreous hemorrhage due to the injection is less than 1%.  1160  
6.5.3  Risks of Vitrectomy  1161  
6.5.3.1 Anesthesia  1162  
 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16    6-4 Anesthesia may be  general endotracheal or local retrobulbar/peribulbar, usually with systemic 1163  
sedation.  Risks of systemic sedation and general anesthesia include cardiac arrhythmia and 1164  
death.  The risks of retrobulbar/peribulbar anesthesia include:  retrobulbar hemorrhage ; 1165  
perforation of the eye by the needle; damage to the optic nerve; double vision lasting up to 24 1166  
hours or more; drooping of the eye lid lasting up to 24 hours or more; difficulty speaking or 1167  
breathing; lightheadedness/syncope/vasovagal response; allergy t o any components of the 1168  
injection; life threatening response due to the spread of anesthesia to the brain stem, resulting in 1169  
epileptic fits, drowsiness, confusion, loss of verbalization, convulsions, respiratory arrest, or 1170  
cardiac arrest.   1171  
 1172  
6.5.3.2 Surgic al Procedure  1173  
Risks of the vitrectomy procedure include a retinal tear (5%) and retinal detachment (1%).  1174  
Uncommon risks include infection (1/5,000) and serious hemorrhage (1/5,000).  Very rare risks 1175  
include visual field defect, visual loss due to macular t oxicity of light or dye (if used) or 1176  
manipulation, and optic neuropathy.  In phakic eyes, cataract progression is likely.   1177  
6.5.4  Risks of Panretinal  Photocoagulation Treatment  1178  
Panretinal photocoagulation can reduce peripheral and night vision. In additio n, it can reduce 1179  
transient or permanent central vision loss. Rarely, it can cause transient increase in intraocular 1180  
pressure, presumably through secondary angle closure as the lens -iris diaphragm shifts forward 1181  
with transient swelling of the posterior tiss ues. 1182  
 1183  
In some cases retrobulbar  or peribulbar  injection may be used to anesthetize the eye and to 1184  
reduce eye movements.  Complications of retrobulbar  and peribulbar  injections are rare.  They 1185  
include, but are not limited to, the following: retrobulbar hemorrhage (bleeding behind the 1186  
eyeball); perforation of the eye by the needle; damage to the optic nerve; diplopia lasting up to 1187  
24 hours or more; ptosis lasting up to  24 hours or more; difficulty speaking or breathing; 1188  
lightheadedness/syncope/vasovagal response; allergy to any components of the injection; life 1189  
threatening response due to the spread of anesthesia to the brain stem, resulting in seizures, 1190  
drowsiness, con fusion, loss of ability to talk, convulsions, stoppage of breathing, or stoppage of 1191  
heartbeat. All of these complications are rare.  1192  
 1193  
6.5.5 Risks of Eye Examination and Tests  1194  
There is a very rare risk of an allergic response to the topical medications used to anesthetize the 1195  
eye or dilate the pupil that occurs in less than 1% of eyes. Dilating drops rarely could cause an 1196  
acute angle closure glaucoma attack (less than 1 in 1000)35, but this is highly unlikely since the 1197  
participants in the study will have had their pupils dilated many times previously .   1198  
 1199  
There are no known risks associated with OCT .  1200

STATISTICAL METHODS  1204  
The approach to sample size and statistical analys is is summarized below.  1205  
7.1 Sample Size  1206  
The sample size has been chosen for the primary study objective, which is to compare visual 1207  
acuity outcomes  over time of prompt vitrectomy  + PRP regimen versus intravitreous aflibercept  1208  
regimen  in eyes with vitreous hemorrhage from PDR for which intervention is deemed 1209  
necessary . The primary outcome is visual acuity area under the curve (AUC) from baseline to 24 1210  
week s. The resulting analysis is a treatment group comparison of mean AUC adjusting f or 1211  
baseline visual acuity and baseline lens status.  1212  
7.1.1 Sample Size Assumptions  1213  
Aflibercept  Group :  To provide estimates for the aflibercept  arm, data from the DRCR.net 1214  
Protocol N trial ( An Evaluation of Intravitreal Ranibizumab for Vitreous Hemorrhage D ue to 1215  
Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy ) were reviewed for eyes with baseline visual acuity 20/32 or 1216  
worse. Eyes in Protocol N had structured treatment through 16 weeks and visits at 4, 8, and 12 1217  
weeks. Treatment was at investigator discretion between 16 and 52 weeks, at which time visual 1218  
acuity was measured. Based on visual acuity data (Table 1), the standard deviation of the AUC at 1219  
12 weeks was 19.2 (95% CI 17.1, 22.0) and the correlation with baseline visual acuity was -0.39 1220  
(95% CI -0.53, -0.23). Assum ing a true standard deviation of 19.2, this adjustment yields an 1221  
effective standard deviation of 17.7 (95% CI 16.3 to 18.7).  1222

visual acuity 20/32 or worse. Visits in common with this protocol are in boldface.  1224

12-week  56 27 
52-week  64 22 
Vitrectomy Group :  For the vitrectomy arm, data from a randomized trial comparing vitrectomy 1225  
with and without bevacizumab for proliferative diabetic retinopathy were reviewed (Manabe et 1226  
al., 2015).36 In the sham group, mean baseline visual acuity was 1.14 logMAR (28 letters) and 30 1227  
of the 34 participants (88%) were enrolled to treat persistent vitreous hemorrhage. At  one month 1228  
after surgery, mean visual acuity improved to 0.43 logMAR (64 letters). Without participant - 1229  
level data, the standard deviation of the AUC cannot be estimated. However, the standard 1230  
deviation of visual acuity at one month was 0.48 logMAR (24 lett ers), which is less than the 29 1231  
letter standard deviation for visual acuity observed in the ranibizumab group at 4 weeks in 1232  
Protocol N (Table 1). Therefore, assuming the standard deviation of AUC for this group is 1233  
similar to the anti -VEGF group is likely a  conservative approach.  1234  
Projected Difference :  The estimated treatment group difference in AUC at  24 week s (6 months ) 1235  
was calculated using the above data, assuming that both groups have baseline visual acuity of 33 1236  
letters, and the aflibercept  arm reaches a visual acuity of 64 letters by 6 months (Figure 1). These 1237  
 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16 7-2 calculations projected an AUC difference of +8.3 letters in favor the of the vitrectomy arm. If 1238  
visual acuity in the aflibercept  arm did not reach 64 letters until 1 year, and had a visual acuity of 1239  
only 60 letters at 6 months, the difference would be +9.3 letters.  1240

 1242  
7.1.2 Sample Size Estimation  1243  
Table 2 shows sample sizes estimates under several scenarios. The final sample size has been 1244  
computed with type 1 error rate of 0.049 (0.001 adjustment for DSMC review) and 80% power . 1245  
Assuming an effective standard deviation of 18 (after adjusting for correlation between baseline 1246  
and outcome), and a true difference in mean AUC of 8 letters, the required total sample size is 1247  
162 eyes. This will be increased to 200 eyes to account for u ncertainty in our projections and loss 1248  
to follow -up; if the rate of loss to follow -up is 7.5% , then the power for an effective sample size 1249  
of 185 would be 85%.   1250  
Table 2. Sample size estimates for a range of true mean differences and effective standard 1251  
deviations (after adjustment for correlation between baseline and outcome). Total number of 1252  
eyes required for 80% / 90% power are shown in cells. The type I error rate is 0.049.  1253

Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16 7-3 7.1.3 Statistical Power  1255  
As there are several binary variables of interest as secondary outcomes (Section 7.3), confidence 1256  
interval half -widths (Table 3) and statistical power (Table 4) for the difference of two 1257  
percentages have been calculated based on an effective total sample s ize of 186 eyes (200 eyes 1258  
enrolled with  7% loss to follow -up). In Protocol N, among eyes in the ranibizumab group with 1259  
baseline visual acuity of 20/32 or worse, 37% achieved 20/32 vision or greater by one year. As 1260  
power for the difference of two percentage s is dependent upon the absolute value of the 1261  
percentages, this estimate is used as a starting point for the calculations below.  1262

Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16 7-4 7.2 Primary Analysis Plan  1276  
7.2.1 Principles for Analysis  1277  
The primary analysis will consist of a treatment group comparison of mean visual acuity AUC 1278  
from baseline to 24 week s between the two treatment groups adjusting for baseline visual acuity 1279  
and phakic status using analysis of covariance. Only  baseline and  outcome visits ( 4, 12, 24, 36, 1280  
52, 68, 84, and 104 weeks ), which are common to both groups,  will be used to calculate AUC 1281  
through the appropriate visit for the primary and secondary outcomes (e.g., 24 week s for primary 1282  
outcome). AUC will be calculated for each participant by the trapezoidal rule using the following 1283  
formula:  1284  
𝐴𝑈𝐶 = ∑(𝑉𝑖+𝑉𝑖+1
2×𝑑)𝑛
𝑖=1  1285  
Where Vi is the visual acuity from baseline measured at the ith visit, d is the number of days 1286  
between visi ts i and i+1, and n is the number of outcome visits included in the analysis. For 1287  
example, the primary outcome has n = 4 as the analysis will include visits at baseline, 4 weeks , 1288  
12 weeks , and 24 week s. For presentation, AUC will be divided by the number o f days between 1289  
baseline and the nth visit so that the value shown will have units of letters rather than letter days. 1290  
This statistic can then be interpreted as the average visual acuity over the time period between 1291  
baseline and the nth visit.  1292  
The primary analysis will include all randomized eyes according to treatment group assignment 1293  
at randomization. Rubin’s multiple imputation will be used to handle missing data. A sensitivity 1294  
analysis using only observed data will also be conducted. If the anal yses of imputed and 1295  
observed data differ substantially, then exploratory analyses will be performed to evaluate 1296  
factors that may have contributed to the differences.  1297  
Pre-planned subgroup analyses will be described in the detailed Statistical Analysis Plan and 1298  
include analyses by history of PRP, treatment for DME, and phakic status.  1299  
Imbalances between groups in important covariates are not expected to be of sufficient 1300  
magnitude to produce confounding. However, the presence of confounding will be evaluated in  1301  
the primary analysis by including factors potentially associated with the outcome for which there 1302  
is an imbalance between groups.  1303  
There are no data to suggest that the treatment effect will vary by gender or race/ethnicity. 1304  
However, both of these factors will be evaluated in exploratory analyses.  1305  
The primary outcome was primarily selected for sample size considerations.  The long -term 1306  
additional key outcomes and within -group outcomes will be equally important as the area under 1307  
the curve outcome for evaluating the overall follow -up course for these two treatment 1308  
approaches.  Therefore, publication is not planned until the f ull 104 week follow -up has closed.  1309  
7.2.2  Per-Protocol Analysis  1310  
A per -protocol analysis will be conducted that will include all randomized eyes except those in 1311  
the prompt vitrectomy  + PRP  group that never receive vitrectomy  and eyes from the aflibercept  1312  
group that missed an injection . The intent -to-treat analysis is considered the primary analysis. If 1313  
 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16 7-5 the results of the primary and per -protocol analyses differ  substantially , then exploratory 1314  
analyses will be performed to evaluate the factors that have contri buted to the differences.  1315  
7.2.3 Interim Analysis Plan  1316  
There is no formal  interim data monitoring for efficacy or futility planned .   1317  
7.3 Secondary Outcomes  1318  
Additional analyses of visual acuity and other outcomes are summarized in the table below. 1319  
Analyses will include adjustments for baseline visual acuity and phakic status. Analyses will be 1320  
conducted at 24, 52, and 104 weeks  (note that visual acuity AUC at 24 weeks  is the primary 1321  
outcome, not a secondary outcome) . In addition, mean visual acuity , visual acuity AUC , and 1322  
percentage of eyes with various visual acuity cutoffs will also be compared at the 4 and 12 week  1323  
visits as the between -group difference in vision is expected to be greatest during the first months 1324  
of the trial . 1325

Within each treatment group, the following outcomes and their 95% confidence intervals will be 1331  
tabulated:  1332  
• Percentage of eyes undergoing  vitrectomy (initial vitrectomy in aflibercept  group and 1333  
repeat  vitrectomy in vitrectomy group)  1334  
• Number of intravitreous aflibercept  injections performed  1335  
• Percentage of eyes receiving PRP ( aflibercept  group only)  1336  
7.3.2 Economic Analysis  1337  
The purpose of the economic analysis is to compare the treatment groups with respect to cost , 1338  
cost-effectiveness  and workplace productivity loss. The analysis plan is briefly described and 1339  
will be detailed in a separate document.  1340  
Data from the clinical trial on number of clinic visits completed, number of procedures 1341  
performed (e.g. vitrectomy, OCT, exam), and number of study aflibercept  injections will be used 1342  
to estimate an average cost per patient for each treatment arm, using the Medicare Fee Schedule 1343  
 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16 7-6 to estimate medical costs. The cost estimates in combination with the percent productivity loss 1344  
for each treatment arm will be incorporated into the analysis.  1345  
Scores from the WPAIQ, administered at baseline , 4, 12, 24, 52, and 104 weeks , will be 1346  
analyzed by tre atment group using analysis of covariance to adjust for baseline score and phakic 1347  
status. Adjusted 95% confidence intervals for treatment group differences will be calculated. 1348  
Mean change at each visit in the following four scores will be analyzed:  1349  
• Absente eism:  percent work time missed due to vision  1350  
• Presenteeism:  percent impairment while working due to vision  1351  
• Work Productivity Loss:  percent overall work impairment due to vision  1352  
o Combination of absenteeism and presenteeism scores  1353  
• Activity Impairment:  pe rcent activity impairment due to vision  1354  
In addition, area under the curve analyses will be conducted using data from all available 1355  
outcome visits for the Work Productivity L oss and Activity  Impairment scores.  1356  
7.4 Safety Analysis Plan  1357  
Adverse events will be categorized as systemic, study eye, or non -study eye. The events will be 1358  
tabulated by treatment group . As only one study eye shall be enrolled, there is no group of 1359  
patients with two study eyes, which would need to be tabulated separ ately. The frequency of the 1360  
event occurring at least once will be calculated.  Rates of adverse events will be compared 1361  
between treatment groups using Barnard’s unconditional exact test.  1362  
The following ocular adverse events will be assessed:  1363  
o Endophthalmitis  1364  
o Any retinal detachment  1365  
o Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment  1366  
o Tractional retinal detachment  1367  
o Retinal tear  1368  
o Ocular inflammation (defined as anterior chamber cell, anterior chamber flare, 1369  
choroiditis, episcleritis, uveitis, iritis, or vitreal cells)  1370  
o Adverse intrao cular pressure (IOP) events  1371  
▪ Increase in IOP ≥ 10 mmHg from baseline  1372  
▪ IOP ≥ 30 mmHg  1373  
▪ Initiation of medication to lower IOP that was not in use at baseline  1374  
▪ Glaucoma surgery  1375  
o Neovascularization of the iris  1376  
o Cataract  extraction in eyes phakic at baseline  1377  
o Visually significant cataract on clinical exam  1378  
The following serious systemic adverse events will be assessed:  1379  
o Primary:  1380  
▪ Death  1381  
▪ Serious adverse event (at least one)  1382  
▪ Hospitalization (at least one)  1383  
 
Vx for Vitreous Hemorrhage Protocol 1.0 7 -28-16 7-7 ▪ Cardiovascular/cerebrov ascular events according to Antiplatelet Trialists’ 1384  
Collaboration (excerpted from BMJ Jan 8, 1994):  1385  
• Non-fatal myocardial infarction  1386  
• Non-fatal stroke (counted only if symptoms lasted at least 24 hours)  1387  
• Death attributed to cardiac, cerebral, hemorrhagic, emb olic, other 1388  
vascular (does not need to be ischemic in origin) , or unknown cause  1389  
• At least one event (non -fatal myocardial infarction, non -fatal stroke, or 1390  
death attributed to potential vascular or unknown cause)  1391  
APTC Notes:  Transient ischemic attacks, angi na, and possible myocardial 1392  
infarction  or stroke are not counted. ‘Nonfatal’ myocardial infarction  or 1393  
stroke required that the participant  was alive at the end of the study.  If not, 1394  
only the death is counted.  1395  
o Secondary:  1396  
▪ Frequency of at least one event per participant in each Medical Dictionary for 1397  
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) system organ class  1398  
 1399  
An additional tabulation will be made for adverse events possibly related to study treatment.  1400  
7.5 Additional Tabulations and Analyses  1401  
The following will be tabulated according to treatment group:  1402  
• Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics  1403  
• Visit completion rate  1404  
• Treatment completion  1405  
7.6 Statistical Modeling Techniques  1406  
All model assumptions, including linearity, normality of residuals, and homoscedasticit y will be 1407  
verified where applicable. If model assumptions are not reasonably satisfied, then a 1408  
transformation, nonparametric analysis, or other appropriate approach will be considered.  1409

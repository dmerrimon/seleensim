Dermatology Consulting Services, PLLC  Zoe Diana Draelos, MD 3.  INTRODUCTION 
Acne medications are a common source of facial dryness resulting in skin barrier damage 
and poor patient compliance.  Retinoids and benzoyl peroxide are some of the most 
frequently prescribed and effective acne medications, however, dryness is an unwanted 
side effect.  A new acne medication, 1% clascoterone, has been placed in a novel vehicle 
for excellent drug delivery in combination with excellent barrier properties.  The barrier 
properties of 1% clascoterone have never been demonstrated.  This study is aimed at 
better understanding the positive barrier effects of 1% clascoterone. 
4. STUDY OBJECTIVE 
The objective of this study is to demonstrate the lack of barrier damage induced by Winlevi as 
measured by corneometry and TEWL. 
 
5. STUDY DESIGN OVERVIEW
Female or male subjects with acne prone skin will be enrolled in this split face single site 
study evaluating the barrier effects of Winlevi.  Subjects who sign consent and meet all 
inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be enrolled at the baseline visit.  
Subjects will be asked to continue their own, self-selected cleanser and sunscreen 
throughout the 2-week study with equal application to both sides of the face.  The 
sunscreen and cleanser must have been used for 30 days prior to study enrollment without 
difficulty.  Subjects must apply Winlevi twice daily to the randomized right or left face. 
Subjects will receive a compliance diary and the blinded study treatment product to be 
applied to the randomized half face following cleansing, every morning and evening.  
The assessing dermatologist investigator will be blinded as to which side of the face is 
receiving the Winlevi treatment.  Subjects will be seen at baseline, 24 hours, week 1, and 
week 2.  The dermatologist investigator and subjects will assess tolerability for each side 
of the face separately at each visit on a 5 point ordinal scale.  Noninvasive TEWL and 
corneometry assessments of both sides of the face will be conducted at baseline, 24 
hours, week 1, and week 2. 
Subjects will complete their study participation at week 2.  The compliance diary and all 
study products will be collected at this time. Women of child bearing potential will be 
administered a urine pregnancy test at baseline and week 2.

The study products will be stored at room temperature in a locked, limited access 
area at the study site.  Only the investigator and staff members designated to 
dispense study medication will be allowed access to the study products.  Study 
product logs will be used to record the dispensation and return of all study 
products.  The subject number/initials, and the initials and date of the person 
dispensing and receiving the returned study products will be documented on this 
form.  
 
10.6 CODE DISCLOSURE 
A randomization code will be maintained indicating which side of the face 
received the currently marketed Winlevi.  An independent blinded dispenser who 
is not associated with other study activities will randomize the study products 
and maintain the randomization until data lock occurs. 
11.  ADVERSE EVENTS
11.1 ADVERSE REACTIONS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED
The study products have been reported to rarely produce skin irritation. 
 
11.2 ADVERSE EXPERIENCES 
An adverse experience is defined as any untoward medical occurrence (sign, 
symptom or laboratory finding), regardless of severity and whether or not 
attributed to the study product. 
 
The investigator/coordinator will report all adverse experiences (AEs) that occur 
throughout the study.  All AEs will be recorded in the appropriate AE log.  The 
report will include: date of onset, a description of the AE, severity, seriousness, 
action taken, relationship to the study drug, outcome of the event, and date of 
resolution. 
 
11.2.1 ASSESSMENT OF SEVERITY 
The intensity or severity of an AE is characterized as: 
Mild: AE which is easily tolerated. Moderate: AE sufficiently discomforting to interfere with daily activity. 
Severe: AE which prevents normal daily activities. 

CONFIDENTIAL  DCS-94-23 
Page 16 of 22
Dermatology Consulting Services, PLLC  Zoe Diana Draelos, MD Subjects who are withdrawn from the study due to any AE will be followed by 
the investigator until the outcome is determined.  The investigator will 
summarize and will document all information relating to the AE and follow up. 
11.2.2 RELATIONSHIP TO STUDY PRODUCT 
The relationship is characterized as: 
Not Related - applies to any adverse experience that is clearly not related to use of the study product. 
Possible - means the association of the adverse experience with the study 
product is unknown; however, a relationship between study product and 
experience cannot be ruled out.   
Probable - there is a reasonable temporal relationship between the use of the study product and the adverse experience.  Based upon the investigator’s 
clinical experience, the association of the event with the study product seems 
likely. 
Definite - The AE occurs following the application of the study product and it cannot be reasonably explained by any other known characteristics of the 
subject’s clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the subject.  It disappears or decreases upon 
discontinuation of the study product and reappears on a re-challenge of the 
study product.  This is necessary to evaluate allergic or irritant contact 
dermatitis. 
11.3 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS 
Definition:  An SAE is defined as any adverse experience occurring that results 
in any of the following outcomes:   
 
1. death  
2. immediately life-threatening illness
3. hospitalization ( > 24 hours) or prolongation of existing hospitalization
4. a persistent or significant disability 
5. a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
6. “other” important medical event  
 
These are not anticipated, however, should an SAE occur, the primary 
investigator (Zoe Diana Draelos, MD) will accept responsibility to notify the 
sponsor. 
 
12. STATISTICAL METHODS  
Along with descriptive statistics (means, standard deviations and percentages), 
investigator and subject ordinal nonparametric results will be analyzed using 
Wilcoxon signed rank test and sign test for paired comparison at different time 
points.  The noninvasive parametric results will be analyzed using paired t-test. 
Changes will be considered significant at the alpha level of 0.05. 

CONFIDENTIAL  DCS-94-23 
Page 17 of 22
Dermatology Consulting Services, PLLC  Zoe Diana Draelos, MD 12.1 SAMPLE SIZE RATIONALE 
A sample size of 50 study subjects was chosen by the study sponsor. 
12.2 SIGNIFICANCE LEVEL 
Significance is defined at the p<0.05 level based on a two-sided test. 
 
12.3 DROP-OUT (PRODUCT TOLERABILITY) ASSESSMENT 
Subjects who discontinue will be queried as to any side effects experienced by 
the study products. 
 
12.4 SAFETY ASSESSMENT 
Incidence of all adverse events reported during the study will be summarized.  
Tabulated summaries will include adverse events grouped by relation to study 
product. 
 
12.5 ENDPOINTS 
12.5.1 PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT 
The primary endpoint is the change in corneometry reading between the side of the face 
treated with Winlevi versus no treatment. 
 
12.5.2 SECONDARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT 
The secondary endpoint is the change in TEWL reading between the side of the face 
treated with Winlevi versus no treatment. 
 
 
13. ETHICS 
13.1 INFORMED CONSENT 
The principles of Informed Consent, according to FDA Regulations and ICH step 
5 guidelines on GCPs, will be followed.  
 
Subjects must provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures 
being completed.  Subject signed informed consents will be kept on file by the 
Investigator for Regulatory Authorities’ inspection at any time.  A copy  of the 
signed and dated consent forms will be given to the subject. 
 
13.2 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD (IRB) 
The study documents will be submitted to an IRB selected by Dermatology 
Consulting Services for approval to ensure the safety of the human subjects 
enrolled in the study.

CONFIDENTIAL  DCS-94-23 
Page 18 of 22
Dermatology Consulting Services, PLLC  Zoe Diana Draelos, MD 13.3 SUBJECT CONFIDENTIALITY 
All participants are concerned for the individual subject’s privacy and, therefore, 
all subject results will be identified only by a subject identification number.  
However, in compliance with federal guidelines regarding the monitoring of 
clinical studies and in fulfillment of his/her obligations to the Sponsor, it is 
required that the Investigator permit the study monitor and/or FDA representative 
to review that portion of the subject’s medical record that is directly related to the 
study.  This shall include all study relevant documentation including subject 
medical histories to verify eligibility, laboratory test result reports to verify 
transcription accuracy, admission/discharge summaries for hospital stays 
occurring while the subject is enrolled in the study, and autopsy reports for 
deaths occurring during the study. 
 
As part of the required content of informed consent, the subject must be informed 
that his/her medical chart may be reviewed by the sponsor, the Sponsor’s 
authorized representative, or a representative of the FDA.  Should access to the 
medical record require a separate waiver or authorization, it is the investigator’s 
responsibility to obtain such permission from the subject in writing before the 
subject is entered into the study. 
 
14. DOCUMENTATION 
14.1 SITE DOCUMENTS REQUIRED FOR INITIATION
Prior to the initiation of the study, the following items must be received: 
a) Sponsor approval of study

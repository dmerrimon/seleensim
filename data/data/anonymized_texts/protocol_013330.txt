Protocol Title:   A Phase 3b Study to Evaluate the Long -Term Safety of Elagolix in Combination with 
Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate for the Management of Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Associated w ith 
Uterine Fibroids in Premenopausal Women
Objective s:
The objectives of this study are 1) to assess the safety of elagolix 300 mg BID in combination with 
E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD) compared to placebo at 12 -months in 
premenopaus al woman with heavy menstrual bleeding associated w ith uterine fibroids, 2) to characterize 
the impact of elagolix 300 mg BID w ith E2/NETA on bone mineral density (BMD) in women with 
heavy menstrual bleeding associated w ith uterine fibroids after up to 48 -months of treatment.
Investigators:  Multicenter
Study Sites:  Approximately 175 sites
Study Population:   Premenopausal female subjects (aged 18 to 50 years, inclusive) with uterine fibroids 
and HMB (> 80 mL blood loss per menstrual cycle).
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 500
Methodology:   
This Phase 3b, sequential, randomized, 12 -month double -blind placebo -controlled, 36 -month open -label, 
multi -center study is designed to evaluate the long term safety of elagolix with add back ther apy in 
women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Approximately 500 subjects w ill be randomized in a 
2:1 ratio to one of the following two treatment groups:
1.Elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD) (n = 335) 
for 48 -months
2.Placebo (n = 165) for 12 -months, follow ed by  elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 
1.0mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD) for 36 -months
Subjects randomized to elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA in the 1 2-month Treatm ent Period w ill 
receive the same treatment during the open label Treatment Period.  Subject randomized to placebo in 
the 1 2-monthTreatment Period w ill switch to elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA during the open label 
Treatment Period after completing the 1 2-month Treat ment Period.
Study Duration:
The total duration for this study is up to 77 months.
The study consists of 4 periods:
Washout Period – up to 10 months prior to Screening (only applicable if subject is taking 
exclusionary medication at the time of consent; duration of washout depends on the type of 
exclusionary medication being taken).
Screening Period – approximately 2.5 to 5 Months prior to first dose of study drug.
Treatment Period – up to 48 -month treatment duration.

Study Duration (Continued):  
Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period –up to 12 -month duration following the last dose of the 
study drug.  Subjects are expected to enter Post -Treatment Follow -Up after completing 
Treatment Month 48, or at any time a subject prematurely discontinues during the Treatment 
Period.
Washout Period:
Follow ing informed consent, subjects, who have been taking exclusionary medications, must enter a 
Washout Period.  Subjects must complete the Washout Period and then have at least 1 menses (refer to 
Table 2) after complet ion of washout, prior to entering the Screening Period.  The duration of w ashout 
period is based on the excluded medication as described in the protocol.  The follow ing study procedures 
may be performed:  medical, social and gynecological history, a physical examination with vital signs, 
urine pregnancy testing; protocol -related adverse event review and documentation of current 
medications and a pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal [TAU] and transvaginal [TVU]) may be performed 
after obtaining informed consent and prior to a subject entering the Washout Period in order to establish 
the presence of a qualifying fibroid(s) or uterine volume to avoid an unnecessary and lengthy washout 
period.  Subjects w ill also begin the use of dual non -hormonal contraception and receive counseling on 
the importance of consistent, appropriate and effective use of birth control and w ill have contraceptives 
dispensed as necessary.
Screening Period:
Follow ing informed consent (if Washout was not required), subjects w ill enter into the approximately 
2.5to 5 Months Screening Period to establish eligibility based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
including the following assessments:  a pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU); a saline infusion 
sonohysterography (SIS); an endometrial biopsy ; a Pap test; a mammogram in subjects 39 years of age 
or older (at the time of randomization) if one was not performed w ithin 3 months prior to Screening; a 
dual energy x -ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (for BMD).  During the Screening Period, subjects must 
demonstrate MBL of > 80 mL for each of two menses as measured by the Alkaline Hematin method 
which quantifies the amount of blood loss on sanitary products.  Subjects will be dispensed sanitary 
product collection kits for 2 to 3 menstrual cycles and w ill be required to collect all sanitary products 
(with or w ithout visible blood) on days with menstrual bleeding or spotting, and must return the products 
to the site within approximately 5 days after cessation of menses.  Subjects are required to use dual non -
hormonal contraception (as applicable), contraceptive counseling will be provided and contraceptives 
dispensed, as necessary.
Year 1 Treatm ent Period:
The Treatment Period begins with Day 1, which will occur betw een cycle Days 1 to 10 of the first day of 
menses (defined as full menstrual flow ), for all subjects who meet eligibility criteria during the 
Screening Period.
On Day 1 of the 1 2-monthTreatment Period, subjects will be randomized to receive either placebo 
(n=165), or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/ NETA (n = 335).  Study drug kits will be dispensed to 
subjects at each on -site visit.  Subjects entering the 1 2-monthTreatment Period will have on -site visits at 
Day 1, Months 3, 6, 9 and 12; phone visits will be made at Months 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 11 .
A mammogram, pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) and endometrial biopsy (based on TVU finding) will 
be performed in subjects at Month 12 or Premature Discontinuation Visit, if applicable; DXA scan will 
be performed at the Months 6, 12 and Premature Discontin uation Visit (if applicable); Vital signs 
assessments will be conducted at all on -site study visits, and a baseline ECG will be obtained.

3.0 Introduction
3.1 Uterine Fibroids
Uterine fibroids (leiom yomata) are the most common benign tumors in women and occur 
in up to 80% of women of reproductive age.1  The incidence increases with age and 
uterine fibroids are the most common reason for hysterectom y in the United States.2  
Uterine fibroids may  develop in African -American women on average 10 y ears earlier 
than in white women.3  The overall cost of s ymptomatic uterine fibroids exceeds 
$2billion per y ear in the United States.4
The growth of uterine fibroids is highly  dependent on both estrogen and progesterone.5
Although often as ymptomatic, fibroids may  cause sy mptoms severe enough to warrant 
therap y in 20% to 50% of women3and the most common sy mptom is heavy  or prolonged 
menstrual bleeding.  Other sym ptoms may  include anemia, pelvic pressure and pelvic 
organ compression, back pain, and adverse reproductive outcomes.  Heav y menstrual 
bleeding (HMB) (menorrhagia, defined as greater than 80 mL  per menstrual cy cle) is 
extremely  inconvenient, can significantl y impact quality of life and may lead to iron -
deficiency  anemia.
While there are numerous surgical options available to manage s ymptomatic uterine 
fibroids, at present there is no long -term medical treatment for sym ptomatic uterine 
fibroids.
The ideal medical treatment for s ymptomatic uterine fibroids, as an alternative to surgical 
interventions, should control HMB, improve non- bleeding s ymptoms and quality  of life, 
and prove safe and tolerable as a chronic therap y.  Unfortunatel y, currentl y available 
medical options provide only  short -term improvement of sy mptoms, and as such, are onl y
indicated prior to surgery, and/or their side -effects limit their long -term use.  A safe and 
effective chronic medical therap y for the management of HMB associated with uterine 
fibroids, as an alternative to hy sterectom y or other surgical intervention, ha s not y et been 
approved. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6

3.2 Elagolix
Elagolix sodium (hereinafter "elagolix," also referred to as ABT -620) is a novel, oral, 
short -acting, non -peptide, gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist that 
competitively  inhibits the GnRH receptors in the pitu itary gland and is being developed 
by AbbVie for the management of endometriosis -related pain and the chronic 
management of heav y menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with s ymptomatic uterine 
fibroids.  The initial preclinical and clinical evaluation of ela golix was conducted b y 
Neurocrine Biosciences Inc. (NBI).  Safet y results from these studies show that elagolix is 
generall y well tolerated.  Elagolix, unlike injectable GnRH analogs, produces a dose 
dependent suppression of pituitary  and ovarian hormone l evels in women, i.e., from 
partial ovarian suppression at lower doses to nearly  full suppression at higher doses.  A 
detailed discussion of the preclinical toxicology , metabolism, pharmacology  and 
pharmacokinetics of elagolix in humans and a summary of clinical studies can be found in 
the Investigator's Brochure.6
3.2.1 Preclinical Experience
3.2.1.1 Toxicology
Please r efer to the most recent edition of the elagolix I nvestigator Brochure for complete 
information on toxicology studies for elagolix.
3.2.2 Clinical Experience
Refer to the most recent version of the Investigator's Brochure for the complete 
information on clinical studies, exposure to study  drug, and safet y.
Clinical Program Overview
As of 20 August 2018, a total of 4,569 subjects have received at least 1 dose of elagolix in 
clinical studies conducted by  NBI and AbbVie (39 Phase 1 studies, 6 Phase 2 
endometriosis st udies, 2 Phase 2 uterine fibroid studies [Studies M12 -663 and M12 -813], 
2 Phase 3 endometriosis studies [Studies M12 -665 and M12 -671], 2 Phase 3  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
21
endometriosis extension studies [Studies M12 -667 and M12 -821]), and ongoing Phase 3 
endometriosis studies [Stud y M14 -702 and Study  M16 -383].
In women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids, 2 Phase 2 studies have been 
completed b y AbbVie, Study M12 -663 and Study  M12 -813.  The Phase 3 uterine fibroid 
registration program consists of 2 pivotal studies, Study  M12 -815 and Study  M12 -817, 
and a single planned associated 6 -month safety /efficacy  extension study , Study  M12 -816.  
The Phase 3 uterine fibroid registration program has 790 subjects.
Clinical Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Summary
See Investigator Brochure Section for detailed discussion regarding the 
pharmacod ynamics of elagolix including results of the multiple -ascending dose study , 
Study  M12 -790, in premenopausal healthy  female subjects.
As discussed in the Investigator Brochure, treatment of women with elagolix does not 
block ovulation so women may  become pregnant while taking elagolix.  There is a dose -
dependent inhibition of ovulation with increasing elagolix dosing such that, for example, 
the 300 mg BID dose appeared to have a slightl y lower ovulation rate than 200 mg BID 
(27% versus 32%), and when the standard -dose estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 
0.5mg (standard- dose E2/NETA) was co- administered with elagolix 300 mg BID, the 
formulation for the current study , the ovulation rate decreased furth er to approximately  
10%.
Efficacy in Phase 2 Uterine Fibroid Studies
Please see the most recent version of Investigator Brochure for detailed description of the 
elagolix Phase 2b (Study  M12 -813) protocol and results.  Results from Study  M12 -813 
show that a ll treatment arms (both doses of elagolix [300 mg BID and 600 mg QD] alone 
or in combination with both strengths of E2/NETA in the form of Activella) met the 
primary  endpoint, which was the proportion of subjects who achieved a Menstrual Blood 
Loss (MBL) v olume of < 80 mL  at the Final Month and50% or greater reduction in MBL   
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
22
volume from Baseline to the Final Month compared to that of placebo (all P < 0.001), as 
measured b y the alkaline hematin method.
Additional results from Cohort 1 demonstrated that trea tment with elagolix 300 mg BID 
plus E2/NETA showed the following:
●Clinically  meaningful improvement in quality  of life measures and s ymptom 
severit y scores as assessed by UFS- QOL
●Mitigation of BMD loss at the lumbar spine, with standard -dose E2/NETA
●Substa ntial dose -dependent reduction in the incidence of vasomotor s ymptoms, 
e.g., hot flushes
●No evidence of endometrial safet y concerns
● Overall safet y profile remains unchanged, with no new or unexpected findings 
to date .
The conclusion from the Phase 2b stud y suggest that standard- dose E2/NETA as add- back 
therap y ma y be effective in preventing BMD loss during treatment with elagolix 300 mg 
BID, with minimal impact on primary  efficacy  bleeding endpoints in premenopausal 
women with HMB associated with uterine f ibroids.  This dosing regimen could 
potentially  meet the objective of a long -term therapy  for the management of sy mptomatic 
uterine fibroids in premenopausal women.
Adverse Events in Elagolix Uterine Fibroid Studies
Please see Investigator Brochure Section 8.3.3.1.5 for details of adverse events after 
elagolix treatment across the elagolix clinical program.  This section will summarize the 
adverse event data in the elagolix Uterine Fibroid Phase 2b study .
Data from the completed Phase 2b study , Study  M12 -813, represent the most extensive 
single stud y data set that examined the tolerability of elagolix at dosing to be used in 
Phase 3, including the present study  and show that, overall, the percentage of subj ects 
who reported treatment -emergent adverse events was generall y similar across all  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
23
treatment groups in both cohorts, ranging from 67.9% to 87.0%, with the highest values in 
the elagolix alone groups (300 mg BID, 80.0%; 600 mg QD, 87.0%).  Estrogen -depend ent 
adverse events from elagolix treatment were ameliorated significantl y with the estrogen -
progestin add -back regimens as detailed below.
The most common adverse events in both cohorts were hot flush, insomnia, and headache.  
The rates for hot flush in Cohort 1 were 3.1% for placebo and 44.6% for elagolix 300 mg 
BID alone, and the addition of low -dose or standard- dose E2/NETA significantly  
decreased the rates b y approximately  20% and 34%, respectively  (25.0% for elagolix 
300mg BID + low -dose E2/NETA and 1 0.8% for elagolix 300 mg BID + standard- dose 
E2/NETA).  In Cohort 2, the rates of hot flush were 5.1% for placebo and 49.4% for 
elagolix 600 mg QD alone.  Addition of low- dose or standard- dose E2/NETA 
significantl y decreased the rates b y approximately  31% and 35%, respectively  (18.4% for 
elagolix 600 mg QD + low -dose E2/NETA and 14.3% for elagolix 600 mg QD + 
standard- dose E2/NETA).
Adverse events of special interest in elagolix clinical studies are discussed in the 
Investigator Brochure and include hot flu sh, cutaneous adverse events, ovarian -related 
events, BMD decrease, fractures, uterine bleeding, mood changing disorders (suicidality 
and depression) and changes in serum lipids.
In the completed Phase 2 studies in uterine fibroids, there were a higher per centage of 
women experiencing cutaneous/h ypersensitivity  events and hot flush with elagolix 
treatment compared with placebo.  Adverse events of special interest will continue to be 
monitored in all clinical studies including the present study.
Serious Adve rse Events in the Elagolix Uterine Fibroid Program
Please see Investigator Brochure Section 9.2.3.1.1 for details regarding Serious Adverse 
Events seen across the elagolix clinical program.  This section will summarize the SAEs 
noted in the elagolix Phase 2b study , Study  M12 -813. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
24
In Cohort 1 of the Phase 2b study  in women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids, 
there were 13 serious adverse events (SAEs) that either occurred during the Treatment 
Period or within 30 day s of last dose in 8 subjects randomi zed to receive active treatment.  
There were six SAEs in placebo treated subjects (9.2%), 3 (4.6%) in the elagolix 300 mg 
BID group, 3 (4.7%) in the elagolix 300 mg BID + LD E2/NETA group, and 1 (1.5%) in 
the elagolix 300 mg BID + SD E2/NETA group.  Treatm ent-emergent SAEs were 
reported for 13 subjects in Cohort 2, including 1 subject (1.3%) in the placebo group, 
5(6.5%) in the elagolix 600 mg QD group, 3 (3.9%) in the elagolix 600 mg QD + LD 
E2/NETA group, and 4 (5.2%) in the elagolix 600 mg QD + SD E2/NE TA group.  In both 
cohorts, the majority  of SAEs were reported by  1 subject each in an y treatment group.
One subject in the elagolix 600 mg QD + LD E2/NETA group had an SAE of uterine 
leiomy oma that was considered reasonabl y possibly related to study drug.
Effects of Elagolix on Bone Mineral Density (BMD) in the Uterine Fibroid Phase 2b 
Study
In the 6 -month Phase 2b study  BMD was assessed at the lumbar spine (L1 –L4), femoral 
neck, and total hip via DXA at Screening and at Month 6 of the Treatment Period, or 
Premature Discontinuation.
Results from the Phase 2b uterine fibroid stud y demonstrate that treatment with elagolix 
300 mg BID and 600 mg QD significantly decrease BMD, which is partially mitigated b y 
addition of E2/NETA in a dose -dependent manner.  I n Cohort 1, the mean percentage 
change from Baseline to Month 6 in BMD in the lumbar spine for the elagolix 300 mg 
BID alone group was –3.8% at Month 6; 19% of subjects had a 3 to ≤ 5% BMD decrease, 
29% had > 5% to < 8% BMD decrease, and 8% had a ≥8% BMD de crease.
In Cohort 2, the mean percentage change from Baseline to Month 6 in BMD in the lumbar 
spine for the elagolix 300 mg BID alone group was –3.4% at Month 6; 25% of subjects 
had a 3 to ≤ 5% BMD decrease, 21% had > 5% to < 8% BMD decrease, and 7% had a 
≥8% BMD decrease.  The addition of standard -dose E2 (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
25
acetate 0.5 mg) substantially mitigated BMD loss at the lumbar spine at Month 6 
compared with the elagolix alone group.  In Cohort 1 the mean change from baseline 
–0.1% v ersus –3.8%), while in Cohort 2 standard dose E2/NETA resulted in a mean 
change from baseline was –1.1% vs –3.4%.
After 6 months treatment in Cohort 1 in the standard E2/NETA (estradiol 
1.0mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) group 6.3% of subjects had a 3 to ≤ 5% BMD 
decrease, 1 subject (2%) had a 5% – 8% BMD decrease and no subjects had ≥ 8% BMD 
decrease at the lumbar spine.  Similarly  after 6 months treatment in Cohort 2 in the 
standard E2/NETA group 9.6% of subjects had a 3 to ≤ 5% BMD decrease, 3 subjects
(5.8%) had a 5% – 8% BMD decrease and 1 subject (1.9%) had ≥ 8% BMD decrease at 
the lumbar spine.
Taken together results from the Study  M12 -813 indicated that the standard E2/NETA 
dose would ameliorate bone loss observed during treatment of heav y menstrua l bleeding 
in women with uterine fibroids using elagolix 300 mg BID.
Effects of Elagolix on Clinical Laboratory Parameters
In the Phase 2 studies, changes in serum lipids, in particular total cholesterol and low -
density  lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL -C), wer e observed in this study , similar to those in 
which occur as women enter menopause7and these changes, as expected, were somewhat 
attenuated by E2/NETA in a dose- dependent manner.  Mean percentage increases from 
Baseline in total cholesterol, high densit y lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C), L DL-C, and 
triglycerides were observed across each of the elagolix tr eatment groups over the 6 -month 
treatment duration.  Generally  these mean changes were changes within the normal range 
of these laboratory  tests.  I n all these studies, the increased lipid values usually  occur 
during the first 1 to 2 months of elagolix use , stabilize or plateau, and return to 
pretreatment baseline levels within 1 to 3 months after elagolix is discontinued.  Please 
see the latest version of the Investigator Brochure for details.

Uterine Bleeding in Phase 2 Studies in Uterine Fibroids
Studies with elagolix have shown that overall patients on elagolix experienced fewer days 
of bleeding per month, reduced bleeding intensit y, and extended intervals between 
bleeding episodes compared with patients on placebo.  Some subjects experienced periods 
of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea with evidence of irregular bleeding as well, in particular 
at lower doses.  The effect of elagolix on bleeding appeared to be dose -dependent.
Data from Phase 2b uterine fibroid study  demonstrates that subjects reported no bleed ing 
during the last 90 day s on treatment most frequently  in the elagolix 300 mg BID alone 
group and the elagolix 600 mg QD alone group, while the reports of no bleeding declined 
in a dose -dependent fashion with the addition of E2/NETA.
Of subjects who rece ived elagolix and were amenorrheic upon entering the Post -treatment 
Follow -up Period, the majority  of subjects (52% in Cohort 1 and 59% in Cohort 2) 
returned to menses at Month 1, and an additional 42% in Cohort 1 and 38% in Cohort 2 
returned to menses at Month 2.
Endometrial Safety in Phase 2 Studies in Uterine Fibroids 
Endometrial biopsies were conducted at Baseline and at Month 6 in Study  M12 -813.  
Results from Cohort 1 show that, among subjects in elagolix treatment groups, 39% to 
43% had normal quiesc ent/minimally  stimulated endometrium and 14% to 28% had 
normal proliferative endometrium at Month 6.  No clinically  significant findings were 
observed.
Results from Cohort 2 are similar.  Among subjects in elagolix treatment groups, 21% to 
36% had normal q uiescent/minimally  stimulated endometrium and 20% to 32% had 
normal proliferative endometrium at Month 6.  No clinically  significant findings were 
observed. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6

As would be expected from a molecule that decreases serum estradiol, there was no 
endometrial h yperplasia in women treated with elagolix alone in the Phase 2b uterine 
fibroid study  nor was this observed after 6 months treatment with either addback arms.
3.2.3 Pregnancy  in Elagolix Studies
Please refer to Section 8.3.3.10 of the most recent edition of the elag olix I nvestigator 
Brochure of a complete discussion of Pregnancies in the Elagolix Clinical Development 
Program.  As discussed above and in the Investigator Brochure, elagolix does not block 
ovulation although there is a dose dependent inhibition of ovulat ion with increasing 
dosage.
Pregnancies have been observed in the elagolix clinical studies.  Although there were no 
congenital malformations observed in the elagolix Phase 3 endometriosis program, earlier 
Phase 2 studies with elagolix did reveal 2 pregnan cies with congenital malformations.
In the aforementioned Phase 2b UF (Study  M12 -813) study , 1 on -treatment pregnancy  
was reported.  In the elagolix Phase 3 studies 4 on -treatment pregnancies were observed.
Extensive counseling on pregnancy  prevention alon g with a requirement for dual non -
hormonal barrier contraception is utilized in all ongoing and planned elagolix clinical 
trials.  Pregnancies must be reported immediately and study drug discontinued.  
Information on the outcome of the pregnancy  will be c ollected.  For live infant births, 
information on the health of the infant will be collected 6 to 12 months after delivery.
Pregnancy  outcomes must also be monitored vigilantly  across the entire development 
program, including adverse events related to pregnancy  outcomes.  Women should also be 
counseled on the unknown, thus potential, risk to children born to mothers exposed to 
elagolix during pregnancy, including the possibility of malformations.

Phase 3 Clinical Development Program for Uterine Fibroids
The overall objective of the Phase 3 registration clinical development program is to 
generate requisite safet y, tolerability, and efficacy data in 2 replicate 6 -month Phase 3 
pivotal studies and 1 safety  and efficacy extension study  (total 12 -month treatm ent period) 
to support use of elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone 
acetate 0.5 mg) for the intended indication of the chronic management of HMB associated 
with uterine fibroids.
The primary  objective of this current Phase 3b (St udy M16 -283) study  in women with 
HMB associated with uterine fibroids is to obtain extended data on the safety  of elagolix 
300 mg BID with standard dose E2/NETA .  All subjects will have the opportunity  to be 
treated with elagolix 300 mg BID with standard dose E2/NETA for the second, third and 
fourth y ears of the study  enabling a careful examination of the long term safet y of this 
dose over 48 months, particularly  with respect to bone loss compared to baseline.
3.3 Estradiol/Norethindrone A cetate
E2/NETA (1.0 m g E2 and 0.5 mg NETA) is a continuous combined oral 
estrogen/progestin regimen.  E2/NETA is approved in the United States as 
postmenopausal hormone replacement therap y for the treatment of moderate to severe 
vasomotor sy mptoms associated with menopause and the prevention of postmenopausal 
osteoporosis.  E2/NETA is also approved in the United States for the treatment of 
moderate to severe s ymptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy  associated with menopause.  
The Phase 2b Study M12 -813 demonstrated that elagolix 300 mg BID with full dose 
add-back therap y showed continued robust efficacy while mitigating bone loss in most 
study  subjects.  For this reason estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg is the only  
add-back therap y in this long -term treatment study.
3.4 Differences Statement 
Phase 2 studies in women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids demonstrated that 
elagolix 300 mg BID provides the most robust efficacy in reducing HMB and E2/NETA  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
29
is the optimal regimen for managing and limiting BMD loss, such that longer term dosing 
is feasible.
Continued assessments of this treatment regimen in the pivotal Phase 3 trials will provide 
the requisite data to support registration of elagolix 300 mg BID + E2/NETA as safe and 
efficacious treatment for the chronic manage ment of HMB associated with uterine 
fibroids.
This long -term stud y will demonstrate safet y data of elagolix 300 mg BID plus estradiol 
1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg versus placebo over a 12 -month period and the long 
term safet y of this dose over 48 mo nths, particularly  with respect to bone mineral densit y.
3.5 Benefits and Risks
The most common sy mptom of premenopausal women with uterine fibroids is heavy  
menstrual bleeding (HMB).  A safe and effective chronic pharmacologic therap y for 
symptomatic uterine fibroids, as an alternative to hy sterectom y or other surgical 
intervention, has not y et been approved, which is the objective of the elagolix Phase 3 
clinical development program.  Results from Phase 2 studies in women with HMB 
associated with uterine fibr oids demonstrated that treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID 
alone and in combination with E2/NETA provided robust efficacy  in reducing HMB 
associated with uterine fibroids.  I mportantly , when co -administered with elagolix 300 mg 
BID, E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 m g/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD) mitigated BMD loss 
observed with elagolix 300 mg BID alone and substantially  reduced other hy poestrogenic 
adverse events such as hot flushes.  Also co -administration of elagolix and E2/NETA 
attenuated increases in serum l ipid parameters observed with elagolix 300 mg BID alone.  
Furthermore, there was no evidence of endometrial safet y concerns and the overall safety 
profile remained unchanged, with no new or unexpected findings to date.
This therapeutic approach, if successful, could provide an alternative to surgical 
interventions as a chronic pharmacologic treatment for heav y menstrual period associated 
with uterine fibroids.  Based on the totality  of data to date from the Phase 2 clinical  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
30
development program, the overall benefit/risk profile of elagolix 300 mg BID with 
E2/NETA appears to be favorable for the chronic management of HMB associated with 
uterine fibroids, and will be established in the Phase 3 pivotal trials.  This Phase 3b study 
will extend understanding of th e safet y of elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA compared 
to placebo for 12 months and the long term tolerability  of this dose over 48 months, 
particularl y with respect to bone mineral densit y compared to baseline.
Considering the coronavirus disease -2019 (COVID -19) pandemic, the benefit and risk to 
subjects participating in this study  has been re -evaluated.  Based on the information to 
date, no additional risk to study  participants is anticipated with the use of elagolix in 
combination with E2/NETA .
4.0 Study  Objectives
The objectives of this study are to:
1. Assess the safet y of elagolix 300 mg administered twice dail y (BID) in 
combination with E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD) 
compared to placebo at 12 months in premenopausal women with he avy menstrual 
bleeding associated with uterine fibroids,
2. Characterize the impact of elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA on bone mineral 
density  (BMD) in women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids after up to 
48months of treatment.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
During the COVID- 19 pandemic, it has been necessary  to employ  mitigation strategies to 
enable the investigator to ensure subject safet y and continuity o f care.  Acceptable 
mitigation strategies are identified and included throughout the protocol. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
31
The investigator should contact the TA MD before discontinuing a subject from the study 
for a reason other than "planned per protocol," (refer to Section 5.4) to ensure all 
acceptable mitigation steps have been explored.
This Phase 3b, randomized, sequential 12 -month double -blind placebo- controlled, 
36-month open- label, multi- center study is designed to evaluate the safet y of elagolix with 
add-back therap y in women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.
Approximately  500 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to one of the following 
2treatment groups:
1. Elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 
0.5mg QD) (n = 335) for 48 months
2. Placebo (n = 165) for 12 months
Subjects randomized to elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA in the 12 -month Treatment 
Period will receive the same treatment during the open -label Treatment Period.  Subjects
randomized to placebo in the 12- month Treatment Period will switch to elagolix 300 mg 
BID plus E2/NETA during the open- label Treatment Period after completing the 
12-month Treatment Period.
The study  was designed to enroll approximately  500 subjects across approximately  
175clinical study  sites to meet scientific and regulatory  objectives without enrolling an 
undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.  Therefore, if the 
target number of subj ects has been enrolled, there is a possibility  that additional subjects 
in screening will not be enrolled.  The total duration for a subject's participation in this 
study  is approximately  77 months, consisting of the following 4 stud y periods:
1. Washout Peri od – up to 10 months prior to Screening (onl y applicable if subject is 
taking exclusionary  medication at the time of consent; duration of washout depends 
on the ty pe of exclusionary  medication being taken). 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
32
2. Screening Period –approximately  2.5 to 5 months prior to first dose of study drug.
3. Treatment Period – up to 48 -month treatment duration
4. Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period – up to 12 months duration following the last 
dose of study  drug.  Subjects are expected to enter Post -Treatment Follow -Up after 
complet ing Treatment Period Month 48, or at an y time a subject prematurely 
discontinues during the Treatment Period.

Washout Period
Following informed consent, subjects who have been taking exclusionary medications 
such as hormonal medications or antifibrinolytics must enter the Washout Period to 
discontinue medications that may  confound efficacy  analy ses and which must be 
completed prior to the Screening Period.  The duration of the required washout period is 
based on the excluded medication that the subject had been taking.  Additional details 
about washout intervals for exclusionary  medication is provided in Section 5.2.3.1 .  Study  
procedures to be performed during the Washout Period are specified in Appendix C, 
Study  Activities and described in Section 5.3.1.1 .  Subjects must complete the Washout 
Period and then have at least 1 menses (refer to Table 2) prior to entering the Screening 
Period.  A pelvic ultrasound (transabdominal [TAU] and transvaginal [TVU]) may be 
performed prior to the Washout Period to establish the presence of a qualifying fibroid(s) 
or measure the uterine volume to avoid the subject unnece ssarily  undergoing a lengthy  
washout of hormonal medications.
Subjects will also begin the use of dual non -hormonal contraception during the Washout 
Period and receive counseling on the importance of consistent, appropriate and effective 
use of birth contr ol and will have contraceptives dispensed, as necessary .
Screening Period
Subjects who do not require washout will enter the Screening Period (approximately  
2.5to 5 months) and will provide written informed consent before an y study -related 
procedures are performed.  Subjects will undergo screening procedures as outlined in 
Appendix C, Study  Activities and described in Section 5.3.1.1 , to establish eligibility 
based on inclusion and exclusion criteria.
A pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) will be performed during screening, if not 
performed in the Washout Period, to determine the presence and size of qualify ing uterine 
fibroids and uterine volume and to rule out exclusionary criteria.  A saline infusion  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
35
sonohy sterograph y (SIS) will be conducted to rule out exclusionary gynecological 
disorders such a s intracavitary  submucosal pedunculated fibroids and endometrial polyps.
Subjects who have qualifying uterine fibroids and uterine volume as assessed by 
ultrasound and have SIS images but are unable to fully  assess the endometrial cavity  after 
2 separate S IS attempts have been made, may  undergo an MRI for further evaluation 
during Screening (per imaging vendor request).
Subjects with previous invasive testing (e.g., endometrial biopsy, pelvic ultrasound, Pap 
test and SI S) in addition to DXA assessments within the last 3 months prior to screening
and original results available may  qualify  to participate in this study .
Eligibility  based on MBL (> 80 mL for each of 2 menstrual cy cles) will be established 
using the alkaline hematin method.  Sanitary  products and the collection kits will be 
dispensed during Screening.  Training will be provided to subjects to ensure collection of 
sanitary  products for menstrual bleeding assessment at the start of the subject's 
firstmenses in the Screening Period (Screening Menstr ual Cy cle 1).  Subjects will be 
required to collect all used or worn sanitary products (including products with no visible 
blood on them) on day s with menstrual bleeding or spotting over the course of 2 or 
3menstrual cy cles during Screening to determine e ligibility  for entry  into the Treatment 
Period.  Sanitary  products will be returned to the site within approximately  5 day s after 
cessation of menses for each menstrual cy cle at a Screening Product Collection Visit.
Reminders regarding the consistent use o f acceptable forms of dual non- hormonal birth 
control and collection of all used or worn sanitary products on days with bleeding or 
spotting will be provided on a routine basis b y the Study  Staff.
Subjects who have signed the informed consent and did not randomize because they  either 
did not complete the Washout Period (if applicable), did not complete the study -specific 
procedures during the Screening Period (e.g., TAU/TVU or SI S) or did not meet all entry  
criteria will be considered Screen Failures.  The reason(s) for screen failure will be 
recorded in the source documents and in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
36
Subjects who screen fail for this study  or other AbbVie studies may  be re -screened with 
the TA SD's approval.
Screening Sanitary Product Collection Visits
At each Screening Product Collection Visit, sanitary  products to measure menstrual blood 
loss will be collected and a venous blood sample will be obtained.  The site will submit 
the sanitary  products and venous blood sample to the alkaline hematin laboratory  for 
analysis of blood loss to determine eligibility .
Vital signs, a urine pregnancy  test, contraception counseling and adverse event and 
concomitant medication review will also be performed during these visits.  Additional 
sanitary  collection kits and contraceptives will be dispensed at each on -site visit.
Year 1 Treatment Period
The Treatment Period begins with Day  1, which will occur between cy cle Day s 1 to 10 of 
the first day  of menses (defined as the first day  with full menstrual flo w), for all subjects 
who meet eligibility  criteria during the Screening Period.
Subjects will be randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive either elagolix 300 mg BID 
plus E2/NETA (n = 335) or placebo (n = 165).  The first dose of stud y drug will be 
administered at the stud y site on Day  1 (whether subject has a morning or afternoon visit 
scheduled).  The subject will take her second dose on the first day  that evening according 
to instructions.  Thereafter, subjects will be instructed to self -administer s tudy medication 
or matching placebo twice daily (once in the morning and once in the evening 
approximately  12 hours apart) orall y without regard to food throughout the 12 -Month 
Year 1 Treatment Period.  Subjects entering the 1 2-month Treatment Period will have on -
site visits at Day  1 and Months 3, 6, 9 and 12.  Phone visits will be made at Months 1, 2, 
4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11.
A urine pregnancy  test will be performed at each visit throughout the 1 2-month Treatment 
Period.  Subjects will be counseled at each visit on consistent, appropriate and effective  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
37
forms of dual non -hormonal contraception to promote pregnancy  prevention.  A positive 
urine pregnancy  test must be confirmed with a serum pregnancy  test.  A positive serum 
pregnancy  test at any  time will neces sitate discontinuation from the Treatment Period.
During the phone visits, site staff will assess ongoing adverse events, concomitant 
medications (if applicable), obtain the results of the subject's self -administered urine 
pregnancy  test, and remind subjec ts of the importance of consistent use of appropriate and 
effective use of dual non- hormonal contraception.
A pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) will be performed during the Treatment Period as 
outlined in Appendix C, Study  Activities.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue at an y time during the 1 2-month Treatment Period 
will be asked to complete Premature Discontinuation procedures as outlined in 
Appendix C, Study  Activities Table and will enter the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period.
Year 2, 3 and 4 (Open -Label) Treatment Period
Eligible subjects, wh o complete the 12- month Year 1 Treatment Period, will continue 
participation in the 36- month open label Treatment Period.  Subjects randomized to 
elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA or placebo in the 1 2-month Treatment Period will 
receive elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA during the open- label Treatment Period.
For subjects entering the open -label Treatment Period, visits will occur either b y phone or 
on-site as outlined in Appendix C, Study  Activities.
Subjects may  begin taking hormonal contraceptive preparations only after completing the 
open -label Treatment Period and has a negative urine pregnancy  test after 1 month off of 
study  drug and return to mens es.
Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period 
Subjects will enter the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period for up to 12 months to assess 
bone recovery  after up to 48 months of treatment.  Subjects who prematurely discontinue  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
38
from the study  at any  time during the Treatme nt Period will enter the Post -Treatment 
Follow -Up Period.
Adverse event collection and concomitant medication review is detailed in Section 6.1.4
and Appendix C.
DXA scans and additional detail regarding study procedures during the Post -Treatment 
Follow -Up Period is provided in Section 5.3.1.1 and Study  Activities, Appendix C.
Study visits may  be impacted due to the COVID -19 pandemic.  This may  include changes 
such as phone or virtual visits, visits at alternative locations, or changes in the visit 
frequency  and timing of study  procedures, among others.  Additional details are pro vided 
for certain procedures.  Every  effort should be made to ensure the safet y of subjects and 
site staff, while maintaining the integrit y of the study.  If visits cannot be conducted onsite 
due to travel restrictions or other pandemic -related reasons, st udy visits may  be conducted 
over the phone where feasible and AbbVie should be notified.
Visit Windows
Visit windows will be allowed during the Treatment and Post Treatment Follow -Up 
Periods.  Each subsequent visit during the Treatment Period ( Months 1 thr ough 48 ) should 
be scheduled based on the date of the Day  1 (Randomization) visit.
Specific assessment -related visit windows are allowed.  Please refer to Table 1, Visit and 
Assessment Windows, for assessment -specific visit windows.

criteria and do not meet any  of the exclusion criteria will be eligible for randomization 
into the study .
Each Investigator will employ  their clinical judgment in conjunction with protocol 
specified inclusion/exclusion criteria to determine if subject meets eligibility.  Questions 
should be directed to the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Scientific Director (TA SD) listed on 
the title page if further clarification is required.
Due to the long Screening Period, eligibility should be assessed throughout the Screening 
Period and just prior to Randomization to ensure that subject continues to meet eligibility .

43
11. Subject has not taken exclusionary hormonal therapies within the specified 
washout interval as specified in Section 5.2.3.1 prior to the initiation of any  
screening procedures and must have at least 1 menses prior to initiation of any 
screening procedures.
Rationale for Inclusion Criteria:
1 This is standard criterion in accordance with harmoni zed Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP).
2 – 5 These criteria were selected to ensure an appropriate subject population of 
premenopausal women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids
6, 7 The impact of elagolix on pregnancies or breastfed infants is unknown and 
there is a possible risk of miscarriage due to changes in hormone levels; 
therefore, these criteria ensure pregnant women are not enrolled into the 
study  and adequate precautions are taken to avoid pregnancy  during study  
participation
8 – 9 These are standard criteria to ensure general good health and the safet y of 
the subjects
10, 11 To avoid bias for the evaluation of safet y by concomitant use of other 
medications

1mens es, the subject can be screened for eligibility to be considered for 
randomization.
26. Subject is using an y systemic corticosteroids for over 14 day s within 3 months 
prior to Screening or is likely  to require treatment with sy stemic corticosteroids 
during the course of the study .  Over -the-counter and prescription topical, inhaled, 
intranasal or intra -articular injectable (for occasional use) corticosteroids are 
allowed.
27. Subject is using oral retinoid preparations such as Accutane®(isotretinoin).  
Topical isotretinoin applications are permitted.
28. Subject has a history  of drug abuse and/or alcohol abuse within 12 months prior to 
Screening that may  affect the safet y, data collection, or have an adverse effect on 
the study  participation.
29. Subject previously  receive d Elagolix/an investigational GnRH antagonist less than 
1 year prior to entry  into the Screening period.
30. Subject is currentl y participating in another investigational stud y (drug or device) 
or has participated in an investigational drug stud y (i.e., receiv ing or has received 
investigational product) within 1 month or five times the investigational drug 
half-life, whichever is longer, prior to Screening procedures.  If a subject has 
participated in an investigational trial with hormonal treatment, the washou t 
interval specified in Section 5.2.3.1 applies.

31. Subject, who in the judgment of the investigator, will be unable or unwilling to 
comply  with study -related assessments and procedures, including collection of 
sanitary  products and consistent use of dual non -hormonal contraception 
throughout the required time period.
Rationale for Exclusion Criteria: 
1 –4, 24 These criteria were selected to ensure a n adequate subject 
population of women with HMB and uterine fibroids and no 
clinically  significant gy necological disorders
5 –13, 15 – 23, 28 These are standard criteria to ensure general good health and 
the safet y of the subjects
14 The impact of elagolix on pregnancies or breastfed infants is 
unknown and there is a possible risk of miscarriage due to 
changes in hormone levels; therefore, these criteria ensure 
adequate precautions are taken to avoid pregnancy or 
breastfeeding while receiving elagol ix
25 – 30 These criteria were selected to ensure that safet y can be 
adequatel y assessed
31 This criterion was added to ensure the population of subjects 
enrolled will comply  with study -related procedures and 
subject collection requirements throughout th e entire study
5.2.3 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Any medication administered to treat uterine fibroid sy mptoms or HMB associated with 
uterine fibroids within 6 months prior to Washout or Screening must be recorded in 
source documents and the eCRFs.  The date (s) of administration (including start and stop 
dates), dose, route, and reason for use and discontinuation must be recorded in source 
documents and on the Prior Uterine Fibroid Medication eCRFs.
Please refer to Section 5.2.3.2 for details regarding concomitant medication use.

The AbbVie TA MD should be contacted if there are any questions regarding concomitant 
or prior therap y(ies).
5.2.3.1 Prior Hormonal/A nti-Hormonal Medications
Subjects using hormonal contraception or other hormonal/anti hormonal therapies may be 
considered for stud y participation provided they complete the required washout.  Subjects 
must have at least 1 menses after completion of Washout before entering into the 
Screening Period.  Subjects currentl y using hormonal/anti -hormonal therapies will sign an 
ICF before they  discontinue the hormonal medication.  Subjects who discontinued taking 
hormonal contraception or other hormonal/a nti-hormonal therapies before they  were 
approached to participate in the study  must sign the I CF and complete the remainder of 
the required washout.  Discontinuation of hormonal contraception should be done 
according to prescribing information (e.g., complete current cy cle of birth control pills) 
and per the investigator's discretion.
Subjects entering washout will be required to undergo stud y specific procedures, as 
outlined in Appendix C, Study  Activities.
Subjects using an LNG -IUS, who agree to have the LNG -IUS removed, must complete 
the washout period and have at least 1 menses during the washout prior to Screening.  
Subjects using a CU- IUD, who a gree to have the IUD removed may  also enter screening 
(no washout required) and must have at least 1 menses after removal of the CU -IUD prior 
to collecting sanitary  products for assessment of menstrual blood loss as the removal of 
the CU -IUD may  cause abno rmal menstrual bleeding that may  interfere with the 
assessment of eligibility  criteria and also to ensure there is no pregnancy .
The minimum washout intervals for hormonal medications (including LNG- IUS) prior to 
Screening are described in Table 2.  If the t ype of hormonal product and the length of 
Washout Period are not listed in the table below, consult the AbbVie TA MD.

than a full course of therapy is administered, the investigator should contact the AbbVie TA MD listed in 
Section 6.1.5 to discuss and confirm the required washout interval.
*** Subjects must complete the mandatory month of washout from oral contraceptives and subsequently have a 
menses.  Bleeding due to withdrawal of the oral contraceptives cannot be considered the required menses.

5.2.3.2 Concomitant Therapy
All other medications or vaccines (including over -the-counter or prescription medicines, 
vitamins and/or herbal supplements) that the subject is receiving at the time of entering 
into the Washout Period (if requir ed) or Screening Period and during the Treatment and 
Post-Treatment Follow -Up Periods must be recorded in source documents and on the 
Concomitant Medication eCRFs.  The reason for use, date(s) of administration (including 
start and end dates) and dosage in formation (including dose and frequency ) must be 
recorded.
Given the ongoing COVID -19 pandemic, selected non- live vaccines (e.g., mRNA, non-
replicating viral vector, protein subunit, etc.) to prevent SARS -CoV -2 infection may  be 
administered during the Trea tment and Post -Treatment Follow -Up Periods, as long as 
components of the vaccine are not contraindicated.
The decision to receive a locally  available vaccine should be based on local guidance and 
an individual discussion between the treating ph ysician and the subject.
5.2.3.3 Iron Supplementation
Excessive blood loss from heav y menses may result in iron deficiency anemia.  Iron 
deficiency  anemia is defined by  the World Health Organization (WHO) as an Hgb 
concentration below 12 g/dL  (120 g/L) for non -pregnant women.   Subjects entering the 
study  with anemia or who develop anemia during the study , if not alread y taking iron 
supplements, should be prescribed iron supplementation by  the Investigator, as per 
standard of care.  If the Investigator does not prescribe iron s upplements for subjects with 
a Hgb < 12g/dL, the reason should be documented in source documents.
The recommended oral dose of ferrous sulfate is 300 to 325 mg following the diagnosis of 
anemia.  During Screening, all subjects with an Hgb level < 7 g/dL wi ll be retested after 
receiving iron supplements; these subjects will only be eligible to randomize if their Hgb 
results meet eligibility  prior to Day  1 (Randomization) and has not required a blood 
transfusion within 60 days prior to Day  1.  If a subject is unable to tolerate ferrous sulfate  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
52
then ferrous gluconate, liquid iron or intravenous (IV) iron may be prescribed.  If subjects 
experience constipation from iron supplement use, stool softeners may  be prescribed.  All 
iron supplements taken during the study , from Screening through the final visit, must be 
recorded on the concomitant medications eCRF.
Further instructions on the provision of iron supplementation and stool softeners will be 
provided separately from this protocol.
5.2.3.4 Concomitant Use of Corticost eroids
Chronic use (> 14 day s) of sy stemic corticosteroids is prohibited during the Washout, 
Screening and Treatment Period, however inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of 
asthma are permitted.  Over -the-counter and prescription topical, inhaled, int ranasal or 
intra-articular injectable (for occasional use) corticosteroids are allowed.  Subjects, who 
based on medical history , may  potentiall y require long- term oral treatment with 
corticosteroids during the course of the stud y, should not be enrolled.  If the subject 
requires s ystemic corticosteroid use for > 14 day s, the AbbVie TA MD must be notified.
5.2.3.5 Prohibited Therapy
All hormonal forms of birth control (except the emergency contraceptive pill, 
levonorgestrel 1.5 mg [such as Plan B®], or ulipristal ac etate 30 mg [such as Ella®or 
EllaOne®]) are prohibited during the Washout, Screening, Treatment Periods and until the 
Post-Treatment Follow -Up Period Month 1.  Subjects may  start hormonal contraception 
after completion of Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period M onth 1, and having a negative 
urine pregnancy  test after 1 month off of study  drug and returned to menses .  If the 
Subject has not returned to menses by Month 1 in the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period, 
the Investigator would use acceptable medical practice to reinitiate hormonal 
contraceptive (e.g., pregnancy  test, FSH, induction of withdrawal bleed, etc.).
For subjects who are prescribed/administered the emergency  contraceptive pill during the 
study , the information should be captured in the source document s and eCRF and the 
AbbVie TA MD must be informed. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
53
Tranexamic acid should not be taken during the Screening and Treatment Periods, 
however tranexamic acid, if necessary , can be prescribed following completion of the 
Treatment Period and the subject has returned to first full menses.  Should the subject be 
prescribed tranexamic acid during the Treatment Period, they will be discontinued and 
will enter the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period.
Any supplements or herbal remedies used to treat premenstrual or gy necol ogical 
problems, such as black cohosh, are excluded.
The following medications should not be taken during the Washout (if applicable), 
Screening, and the Treatment Periods. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
56
If a prohibited medication is necessary to treat an adverse event or a pre -existing 
condition other than uterine fibroids, the AbbVie TA MD noted on the title page should 
be consulted; however, if clinically  requir ed and to prevent an immediate hazard to the 
subject being treated, the AbbVie TA MD should be notified as soon as possible after the 
start of use.  Additionally, if a subject takes a prohibited medication during the study, 
except as permitted per protocol , her continued participation in the study  will be evaluated 
by the Investigator and the AbbVie TA MD.  If there are an y questions regarding prior or 
concomitant therap y, please contact your Study Monitor.
5.2.4 Contraception Recommendations
Contraception Counse ling/Dispensing Contraceptives
Investigators and stud y staff will be trained b y the Sponsor on the importance of 
contraception in this clinical trial.  Subjects (excluding those subjects who have had a 
bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal occlusion) will be counseled b y the Investigator or 
designated study  staff at every  visit throughout study  participation on the importance of 
pregnancy  prevention and the use of appropriate and effective methods of contraception.
Subjects must agree to use two forms of non -hormonal contraception (dual contraception) 
consistently  throughout the Washout (if applicable), Screening and Treatment Periods and 
the first month of the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period.  Subjects may  begin the use of 
hormonal contraception (e.g., oral or IUD) after completion of the Post- Treatment 
Follow -Up Month 1 visit and has a negative urine pregnancy  test after 1 month off study  
drug and return to menses.
Acceptable methods of dual non- hormonal contraception include the following 
combination s:
●Condom with spermicide (foam, gel or pol ymer film)
●Diaphragm with spermicide (condom may  or may  not be used)
●Cervical cap with spermicide (condom may  or may  not be used) 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
57
Subjects are not required to use dual contraception methods if:
●Sexual partner(s) is vasectomized at least 6 months prior to screening
●Subject practices total abstinence from sexual intercourse, as the preferred 
lifesty le of the subject; periodic abstinence is not acceptable
●Subject had a bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal occlusion at least 
4months prior to screening.
●Subject is not sexually  active with men; however, periodic sexual 
relationship(s) with men requires the use of dual non -hormonal contraception 
as indicated above.
●Subject has begun the use of hormonal contraception after the Post -Treatment 
Follow -Up Month 1 visit .
●Subjects may  begin the use of hormonal contraception after the Post -Treatment 
Follow -Up Month 1 visit, provided she hasa negative urine pregnancy  test 
1month off of study  drug and has returned to mense s.  If the Subject has not 
returned to menses b y Month 1 , the I nvestigator would use acceptable medical 
practice to reinitiate hormonal contraceptive (e.g., pregnancy  test, FSH, 
induction of withdrawal bleed).
The following measures will be taken to help ensure pregnancy  prevention during the 
study .
1. The informed consent form will include an attestation requiring the subject to 
confirm in writing (via signature) her full awareness that the potential risks of study 
drug on the unborn child are unknown and th erefore she must not get pregnant 
during the entire time of study  participation, and that she agrees to consistently  use 
protocol required dual non -hormonal contraception throughout her study  
participation.
2. The Investigator or designated study  staff will c ounsel the subject that the study  
drug is not contraceptive, that ovulation may occur even though the study drug may 
have altered menstrual cycle patterns, and that fetal abnormalities have been  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
58
reported in women who have received elagolix in clinical stud ies however, it is 
unknown whether these abnormalities were the result of taking elagolix.
3. The Sponsor will provide training materials to the sites for instructing subjects on 
the ty pes of protocol -allowed contraception methods, their effectiveness and pro per 
use.
●The Sponsor will provide all investigative sites with a supply  of materials to 
promote pregnancy  prevention, including contraceptives ( e.g., condoms and 
spermicides) to provide to subjects at no charge.
●Subjects should only  use the pregnancy  preve ntion material s provided b y the 
Sponsor as these products have undergone analytical testing b y the anal ytical 
lab to confirm there is no or limited interference with the alkaline hematin 
method.
●Subjects will be allowed to choose a n acceptable contraceptio n method of their 
choice from the contraceptives provided by the Sponsor and will be expected to 
consistently practice the allowable methods of contraception.  The site will 
assess the subject's basic understanding of the proper contraceptive use through 
discussion and demonstration of proper techniques, if needed, including proper 
diaphragm use.
●The site will provide contraceptives (and other supplies (e.g., lubricants) to 
subjects throughout Washout, if applicable, Screening and Treatment Periods, 
as needed.
●The source documents will capture date initial contraception counseling was 
performed , whether the subject meets protocol criteria for not requiring use of 
dual contraception and the ty pe of contraceptive provided to the subject (as 
applicable). At subsequent study  visits, the source documents will ca pture if 
there was a change in contraceptive method, use of a non -study  supply  brand, 
and whether additional contraceptives were provided to the subject.
●The subject will be asked to attest by signature at the time of consent, and 
subsequently  in a stand -alone attestation form at all on-site study  visits that 
allowable methods of contraception, as described during the pregnancy 
prevention counseling, are being practiced. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
59
●For subjects who have had a bila teral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal occlusion, 
(including Essure®), attestation is only  required to be collected once during the 
study  prior to randomization, ideally  at the time of consent.  Additionally , these 
subjects do not require contraception co unseling at any  study  visit or the 
associated documentation of that counseling.
4. On-site and phone visits are used to promote frequent interaction with site staff and 
opportunities for continued education.
5. At each Treatment Period visit (on -site and phone v isits), the proper use of 
contraception will be reinforced to address possible ineffective use and the risk of 
unexpected pregnancy due to unprotected sexual activity .
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Due to the COVID -19 pandemi c, if the subject is unable to come on -site, the 
contraception counseling should be conducted during the phone visits (as applicable). 
The site should ship a reasonable quantity of contraceptive supplies for subject use until 
next on -site visit.  The ty peand quantit y of contraceptives shipped to the subject must be 
documented along with the shipping tracking number and documentation.  When subject 
is able to go to the site, site should make sure that enough contraceptives are dispensed to 
the subject.

Study  procedures during the Washout (if applicable), Screening, Treatment and Post -
Treatment Follow -Up Periods described in this protocol are summarized in Appendix C. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
60
5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
The study  procedures outlined in Appendix Care discussed in detail in this section, with 
the exception of monitoring stud y drug accountability  (Section 5.5.7), contraception 
counseling/contraceptive dispensing (Section 5.2.4), the collection of concomitant 
medication (Section 5.2.3 ) and adverse event information (Section 6.0).  All study  data 
will be recorded on the eCRFs with the exception of the select ePRO data and data from 
the central lab/imaging ve ndor.
The Screening Period will occur within approximately 2.5 to 5 months prior to 
administration of the first dose of study drug on Day 1 (Randomization).  For procedures 
performed during the Screening Period and subsequently repeated (as allowed per 
protocol or at the discretion of the AbbVie TA SD), the procedure performed closest to 
dosing will serve as a baseline for clinical assessment.
Study  procedures during the Treatment and Post -Treatment Follow -Up Periods should be 
performed within the visit windows specified in Table 1.  Scheduled monthly  visits during 
the Treatment and Post -Treatment Follow -Up Periods are based on a 28 -day month.
This protocol provides recommendations regarding the sequence of procedures to be 
performed during the study .  In no case should these recommendations outweigh clinical 
judgment or standard of care.  If the protocol indicates that the AbbVie TA SD or MD is
to be contacted prior to performing a procedure, yet the timing of the request would either 
interrupt a procedure or would interfere with standard of care and clinical judgment, then 
clinical judgment should prevail and the AbbVie TA MD should be notified afterwards.
Due to the long Screening Period, eligibility should be assessed throughout the Screening 
Period, including just prior to randomization to ensure that the subject continues to meet 
eligibility  and that the results from all screening procedures are available prior to 
randomization.

Informed Consent
The I RB/IEC approved informed consent will be signed b y the subject before beginning 
any study -specific procedures or discontinuing any  hormonal contraception/therapies or 
other prohibited medications .  Exploratory  research testing is optional and a subject must 
be provided a separate informed consent option for this blood collection.  Details about 
how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Medical/Social History
A complete medical history , including documentation of an y clinicall y significant medical 
conditions and medications, history  of tobacco and alcoho l use, and drug abuse will be 
collected during the Washout Period (if applicable) or during the Screening Period for 
those subjects who do not require washout.  The medical history  will be reviewed and 
should be updated if significant clinical findings are noted on Day  1 prior to dosing and 
will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
Gynecological/Obstetrical and Uterine Fibroid History
A detailed gy necological/obstetrical and uterine fibroid history  will be collected either 
during the Washout Period (if applicable) or during the Screening Period for those who do 
not require washout, and will include the following:
●History  of uterine fibroids, including y ear of diagnosis and uterine fibroid 
symptoms
●History  of endometriosis, ovarian cy sts, endometria l poly ps, or other relevant 
gynecological conditions
●History  of gy necological surgeries and gy necological diagnostic procedures
●History  of bleeding including average cy cle length and average number of day s 
with bleeding/cy cle over the last 6 months and ty pical intensity  of menstrual 
periods 
●History  of irregular bleeding or prolonged bleeding

●Prior hormonal medications including those taken for treatment of uterine 
fibroids or other gy necological conditions
●Prior use of non -hormonal medications for the trea tment of uterine fibroids, 
including dates of use for 6months prior to either Washout (if applicable) or 
Screening
●History  of sexually  transmitted infections
●Obstetrical History
●Pregnancy  history  including:
○Total number of pregnancies
○Number of live births
○Number of abortions (including elective, therapeutic and spontaneous 
abortions )
○Delivery  outcomes (specifically , anomalies including congenital 
malformations and chromosomal abnormalities).
The gy necological/obstetrical and uterine fibroid history will be reviewed and should be 
updated if needed prior to dosing on Day 1 (Randomization) and will serve as the baseline 
for clinical assessment.
Physical Examination
A complete ph ysical examination will include height (at Screening onl y) and weight 
measuremen ts (the subject should wear lightweight clothing and not wear shoes) and will 
serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
A brief, s ymptom -directed phy sical examination will be performed at Washout (if 
applicable), Day  1 and Post Treatment Follow -Up Mon th 1.
Visits requiring either the complete ph ysical examination (including weight) or a brief, 
symptom -directed ph ysical examinations are outlined in the Study  Activities Table, 
Appendix C. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
63
Clinically  significant physical examination findings prior to randomization will be 
recorded as medical history .  Any  clinicall y significant ph ysical examination findings 
after initiation of dosing will be recorded in the source documents and in the eCRFs as 
adverse events.  The complete phy sical examination performed during Screening will 
serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, if the subject is unable to come on- site for the phy sical 
exam, it can be delay ed up to 1 month from their scheduled time. Should the delay  be 
longer, AbbVie should be notified.
Gynecological (Pelvic and Breast) Examination
A complete breast and pelvic examination, including external genitalia, will be performed 
during the Screening and Treatment periods as listed in Appendix C.  Timing of b rief 
symptom -directed gy necologic examinations are outlined in Appendix C, but may also be 
performed at an y time throughout the study as deemed cli nically  necessary .  The complete 
breast and pelvic examination completed during Screening will serve as the baseline for 
clinical assessment.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, if the subject is unable to come on- site for the 
gynecological exam, it can be delay ed up to 1 month from their scheduled time. Should 
the delay  be longer, AbbVie should be notified.
Vital Signs
Vital sign determination of pulse, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and body temper ature 
will be obtained at all on- site visits during the study  as indicated in Appendix C.  The 
blood pressure and heart rate measurements should be taken prior to scheduled blood  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
64
collections (if applicable).  Measurements should be assessed consistently throughout the 
study  and will be recorded in the source documents and eCRF.
The vital signs measurements obtained prior to dosing on Day  1 will serve as the baseline 
measurements for clinical assessment.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, if the subject is unable to come on- site for the vit al 
signs, it can be delay ed up to 1 month from their scheduled time. Should the delay  be 
longer, AbbVie should be notified.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
A resting 12 -lead ECG will be conducted during the Screening Period.  The ECG should 
be obtained pr ior to an y blood collection.
For an y abnormal screening test results, the ECG may  be repeated one time prior to/on 
Day 1, however the subject may  not be enrolled if any  clinically  significant findings are 
noted on the repeat ECG.  Final results (i.e., resu lts used to determine eligibility) will be 
entered into the eCRF.
The Investigator or qualified designee at the study site will determine if any findings are 
clinically  significant (in consultation with a cardiologist if necessary ), and document this 
on the ECG tracing/report, sign and date it.  The original ECG tracing or a certified cop y 
of the original tracing with the phy sician's assessment will be retained in the subject's 
records at the study  site.
Mammogram
A mammogram will be obtained during Screeni ng (only  for subjects who will be 39 y ears 
of age or older at the time of randomization unless the subject had a mammogram 
performed within 3 months prior to Screening), and at Months 12, 24, 36, 48 and  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
65
Premature Discontinuation Visit (if applicable).  Loc al mammogram results and final 
interpretation must be entered into the eCRF upon receipt.
If a subject's screening mammogram results are incomplete (BI -RADS 0) and need to be 
repeated, the AbbVie TA MD does not need to be contacted for approval prior to 
conducting the repeat mammogram or other mode of imaging (e.g., ultrasound, spot 
compression).  If results meet entry  requirements, subject would be allowed to continue in 
Screening.
If the repeat mammogram or other breast imaging results indicate further te sting is 
required (e.g., breast biopsy) to rule out an y potential exclusionary findings, the subject is 
not eligible for the study .  Any  further imaging or testing will be performed outside of the 
protocol and should follow standard of care.
Mammograms wil l be read locall y and the local radiologist's interpretation will be used to 
determine if a subject meets eligibility  criteria.  Subjects with normal or benign findings 
or BI -RADS Classifications 1, 2 or 3 (via mammogram or other mode of imaging) as 
outlin ed in Appendix Dwill be eligible for randomization on Day  1.  Subjects with an 
abnormal mammogram or BI -RADS 4, 5 or 6 will not be eligible for ran domization into 
the study .  Subjects should continue with recommended mammograph y testing outside of 
the protocol per local guidelines and standard of care during the stud y.
During the Treatment Period, mammograms will also be performed for subjects who are 
39 years of age or older at the time of the scheduled study  visit at Months 12, 24, 36, 48 
and Premature Discontinuation Visit (if applicable).  A mammogram is not required for 
prematurel y discontinued subjects if the subject had a mammogram within app roximately  
6 months prior to the PD visit.  All mammograms will be read locally.  If a subject has a 
clinically  significant mammogram finding in the opinion of the investigator, or BI -RADS 
Classifications 4, 5, or 6, or there is a recommendation for additi onal testing, the AbbVie 
TA MD should be notified for additional guidance and approval.

Pap Test
Pap test will be performed on all subjects at the visits listed in Appendix C.  A Pap test 
will be performed in subjects ≥ 21 y ears of age during the Screening Period, using the 
Thin Prep®Pap Test™ provided and analy zed by  the central laboratory .  If the subject is 
experiencing menstrual bleedin g that precludes the performance of the Pap test, this 
procedure should be performed as soon as possible after the menstrual bleeding has 
ended.  In the case of an unsatisfactory  sample, the Pap test can be repeated.  The repeat 
Pap test should also be per formed when the subject is not experiencing menstrual 
bleeding.  In order to be enrolled in the study, the Pap test must meet eligibility  
requirements as outlined in Figure 2, Pap Test Eligibility .
Subjects age 25 – 51 years old, with the Pap diagnosis of ASC -US (aty pical squamous 
cells of undetermined significance) with high risk human papillomavirus (HPV), or low 
grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) and those > 30 y ears of age with negative 
(NILM) but absent or insufficient endocervical/transformational zone component will 
have reflex HPV testing as outlined in Figure 2.  Those with high risk HPV, L SIL with 
high risk HPV or LSIL negative for HPV, or subjects > 30 years of age with Negative 
Intraepithelial Lesion or Malignancy  (NILM) but with negative or absent endocervical or 
transformation zone component with high risk HPV will undergo additional evaluation as 
outlined in Figure 2with colposcop y and biops y, if applicable per local guide lines or 
standard of care.
After colposcop y, subjects who have a histological diagnosis of CIN 1 or less with an 
adequate colposcop y and a negative endocervical sample post colposcopy may continue in 
Screening.  For subjects with no lesion identified on colposcop y or when colposcopy  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6

examination is unsatisfactory , endocervical sampling must be performed to confirm a 
negative/benign endocervical sample.
Subjects with the cy tology  screening result of at ypical squamous cells cannot exclude 
HSIL (ASC -H), high -grade intraepithelial lesion (HSIL), or at ypical glandular cells 
(AGC), at ypical endocervical cells or histological diagnosis of CIN 2 or 3 are not eligible 
for the stud y.
During the Treatment Period, a Pap Test will be performed at Months 24, 48 and the 
Premature Discontinuation visit (if applicable).  During Treatment, if the subject has an 
abnormal pap test that indicates a clinically  significant finding in the opinion of the 
investigator and requires additional testing (e.g., colposcopy  or biops y) as foll ow-up, the 
AbbVie TA MD should be notified for additional guidance and approval.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, if the subject is unable to come on- site for the pap test, it 
can be delay ed up to 1 month from their scheduled time. Should the delay be longer, 
AbbVie should be notified. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)

misoprostol for cervical dilatation is allowable.  In addition, L idocaine may  be used as 
local anesthesia on the cervix.  Any  medications used for the procedure should be 
recorded i n source documents and on the appropriate eCRF.  If there is a need for 
consideration for an office hy steroscopy  to obtain the endometrial biops y sample, the TA 
MD should be consulted.
If the endometrial biopsy is performed on the same day as the Pap smear or pelvic 
ultrasound, the endometrial biopsy  should be performed after the Pap smear and pelvic 
ultrasound.
Biopsy  results from the central laboratory  must be obtained and reviewed by  the 
Investigator to ensure eligibility criteria are met before the subj ect can be randomized on 
Day 1.  In case of an insufficient sample the biopsy may be repeated; however, results 
must be available prior to randomization.  Subjects must have an adequate endometrial 
biopsy , (i.e., results show no endometrial pathology to be eligible for randomization).
If an abnormal finding such as endometritis, h yperplasia (with or without atypia) or 
endometrial cancer is reported, subjects will not be eligible for randomization into the 
study .  If the Investigator determines that an abnor mal finding can be treated outside of 
the protocol, the subject will need to be screen failed and can be re -screened.
An endometrial biops y is not required during the Treatment Period if the ultrasound 
findings at Treatment Months 12 or 24 indicate an endometrial thickness < 4 mm.  If the 
ultrasound findings during the Treatment Period Months 12 or24 indicate an endometrial 
thickness ≥ 4 mm, then the subject must have an endometrial biopsy performed at these 
time points.
For this amendm ent (Amendment 6) based upon FDA feedback, endometrial biopsy  at 
Month 36 and 48 is required regardless of the TVU findings at the corresponding visit.
Specificall y, for subjects who have completed Month 36 study visit without the 
endometrial biopsy , subje cts should return for an interval endometrial biopsy as an 
Unscheduled Visit.  Refer to Appendix C, Study  Activities, for more information. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
70
If the Month 12, 24, or 36 biopsy  results are normal or the sample contains scant 
endometrium without abnormalities, the subject may continue in the remaining of the 
open -label Treatment Period.
In the event the Month 12 or 24 biopsy  cannot be performed (e.g., du e to a stenotic cervix 
or location of fibroids) or an insufficient biops y sample is obtained and the concurrent 
TVU indicates a thickness of ≥4 mm ,a repeat biopsy  must be performed.   In the event 
that the Month 36 or 48 biopsy  cannot be performed, or an insufficient biopsy  sample is 
obtained, a repeat biops y must be performed.
If the repeat biops y is performed and the results are normal or the sample contains scant 
endometrium without abnormalities, the subject may continue the open- label Treatment 
Period.
If the repeat biops y sample cannot be obtained or remains insufficient, the AbbVie TA 
MD should be consulted.
An additional e ndometrial biopsy  should be performed if clinically  indicated for 
breakthrough bleeding, taking into account of the subject's pre vious biopsy results, TVU 
findings, patient compliance with study drugs and recognizing subjects are receiving a 
daily  dose of progestin.
Subjects with abnormal endometrial pathology  results (including, endometrial hy perplasia 
with or without aty pia and en dometrial cancer) during the Treatment Period should be 
discontinued and instead will enter the Post -Treatment Follow -up Period.  The 
endometrial pathology  should be managed according to standard of care.
In addition, if there is an abnormal endometrial pa thology  at Treatment Month 48, this 
should be managed according to standard of care.

COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, if the subject is unable to come on- site for the 
endometrial biopsy , it can be de layed up to 1 month from their scheduled time. Should 
the delay  be longer, AbbVie should be notified.
Central Imaging Procedures
Fibroid and uterine assessments will be obtained using pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) 
at Washout (if applicable), Screening, Months 12, 24, 36, 48 or Premature 
Discontinuation Visit and SI S at Screening.  All ultrasound images will be sent to the 
Central I maging Core Lab (central reader) for review to determine eligibility  for 
randomization and to monitor safet y during the Treat ment Period.
The pelvic ultrasound (TAU, TVU and SIS) and MRI  (if applicable) will be performed b y 
the investigative sites' or affiliated Radiology Department.  The ultrasonographer at each 
investigative site will be required to acquire the ultrasound, SI Sand MRI (if applicable) 
images according to the Imaging Acquisition Guidelines provided b y the central reader.  
Images should be sent/transmitted to the central reader to determine eligibility for entry 
into the study  and for subject evaluation during the course of the study.  Refer to the 
Image Acquisition Guidelines for instructions on submitting images to the central reader.
The pelvic ultrasound (TAU, TVU and SIS) and MRI  (if applicable) will be assessed both 
locally  and by  the central reader.  The cen tral reader will issue an Eligibility Form based 
on review of the pelvic ultrasound and SI S indicating the presence or absence of a 
qualify ing fibroid and/or uterine volume and whether an y exclusionary pathology was 
present.  If images are unevaluable, the central reader will inform the investigative site 
and additional images will need to be resubmitted.  If there is a discrepancy between the 
local assessment and the central reader's assessment, this should be brought to AbbVie's 
attention and TA MD will d iscuss the findings with the local site and central reader on a 
case-by-case basis to determine eligibility . 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
72
The Investigator or designee should consult the local ultrasound and SIS reports and/or 
images in order to determine if any  exclusionary  criteria a re present and make safet y-
related judgments concerning the subject.  The interpretation of the local report and/or 
images will be filed or recorded in the subject's source documents.  Data and/or local 
interpretation from the local ultrasound, DXA, SIS and MRI  (if applicable) images will 
not be recorded in the eCRF.
During the Treatment and Post -Treatment Follow -Up Periods, the central reader may  
issue a report if any significant changes are observed that may affect subject safet y during 
the study .  In the se cases, the I nvestigator should review the local ultrasound, SI S and/or 
MRI  (if applicable) images and treat as per standard of care.
The pelvic ultrasound, SIS and MRI  (if applicable) will be performed as outlined in 
Appendix C, Study  Activities.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Due to the COVID -19 pandemic, if the subject is unable to come on- site or to the imaging 
facility, the DXA and TAU/TVU can be delay ed up to 1 month from their scheduled time. 
Should the delay  be longer, AbbVie should be notified.
Pelvic Ultrasound:  TAU and TVU
A pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) will be performed early in the Screening Period and 
should ideally  be performed during the subject's earl y proliferative phase of the menstrual 
cycle (approximately  Day s 4 –8 of the cy cle), or in the Washout Period, if applicable.  
Subsequent pelvic ultrasounds will be performed at the time points indicated in, 
Appendix C, Study  Activities.  The pelvic ultrasound will determine the presence of 
qualify ing uterine fibroids and uterine volume.  The TAU and TVU will be used to 
confirm the presence of qualify ing ut erine fibroids (at least 1 fibroid with diameter ≥ 2 cm 
(longest diameter), or multiple fibroids with a uterine volume of ≥ 200 cm3to 
≤2,500 cm3, and to obtain measurements of the dimensions of the uterus and of the 
largest fibroid.  The TVU will be used to assess gy necological disorders, such as ovarian  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
73
cysts and endometriomas.  However, these assessments can also be made by  TAU, if 
necessary .
Assessments for the pelvic ultrasound include, but are not limited to the following:
●Endometrial thickness 
●Presence of abnormal endometrial appearance or endometrial pathology
●Presence of uterine fibroids
●Number of uterine fibroids
●Volume and location of the 3 largest fibroids
●Uterine volume in cubic centimeters
●Presence of ovarian cy sts 
oNumber
oSize (cm)
oLocation (right or left ovary )
oSimple versus complex
●Endometrioma > 3.5 cm longest diameter
●Solid ovarian lesions > 1.5 cm longest diameter
Saline Infusion Sonohysterography (SIS)
In addition to the pelvic ultrasound, an SI S will also be performed in all subjects during 
the Screening Period, to assess exclusion criteria based on the presence of focal 
intracavitary  lesions including:
●Endometrial poly p ≥ 1 cm
●Intracavitary  submucosal pedunculated fibroid
The SI S should be performed as early  as possible during the Sc reening Period to rule out 
any exclusionary  findings; for subjects entering washout, an SI S will not be performed 
until the subject enters the Screening Period in order to limit the number of invasive 
procedures prior to full y determining eligibility .  The subject must have a confirmed  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
74
negative urine pregnancy test result within 24 hours prior to undergoing the SI S.  It is 
advised that the SI S be performed post -menses to Day  10 of the menstrual cy cle.  
Ibuprofen and antibiotics may be administered prior to conducting the SI S, if standard of 
care.
If a subject is known to have an endometrial pol yp ≥ 1 cm, and desires to have the polyp 
removed outside of the study , prior to entering Screening the subject must have a negative 
pathology  report and return to one normal menses prior to screening.
Subjects who have qualifying uterine fibroids and uterine volume as assessed by 
ultrasound but have SI S images that are unable to fully  assess the endometrial cavity  after 
2 separate SI S attempts have been made, may  underg o an MRI (per imaging vendor 
request) for further evaluation.
Intracavitary Uterine Findings
An SI S may  be performed during the Treatment Period if the pelvic ultrasound (TAU and 
TVU) results suggest an intracavitary  lesion such as a poly p.  The finding of a poly p 
during the Treatment Period should be documented as an adverse event if the Investigator 
considers it to be clinically  significant.
The AbbVie TA MD should be notified of the subject's management plan for an y 
clinically  significant pathologic find ings during the Treatment Period.
Ovarian Findings:
During Screening, if the initial pelvic ultrasound shows a simple ovarian cyst > 5 and 
≤ 7cm in longest diameter, an ultrasound of the ovaries may  be repeated in approximately  
4 to 6 weeks.  The repeat r esults must be evaluated prior to Day  1 (Randomization) and 
not meet exclusion criteria (i.e., persistent simple ovarian cyst > 5 cm).
In Screening, if an y of the adnexal structures, such as an ovary, cannot be visualized on 
the pelvic ultrasound due to, f or example, fibroid location and/or fibroid size, the subject  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
75
may be eligible for randomization provided there are no exclusionary  findings based on an 
alternate imaging that can evaluate that adnexa such as an MRI (per central reader 
agreement).
During th e Treatment Period, if the pelvic ultrasound shows a simple ovarian cy st > 5 cm 
or a complex ovarian cy st (including endometriomas) > 3.5 cm in longest diameter the 
findings should be documented as an adverse event if the I nvestigator considers them to 
be clinically  significant.
Bone Mineral Density (DXA Scan)
DXA scans of the lumber spine, femoral neck and total hip will be performed by qualified 
technologist/radiologists at the site or affiliated imaging facility utilizing GE L unar or 
Hologic equipment and per the acquisition guidelines provided b y the Central Imaging 
Core Lab (central reader).  The DXA technologist/radiologist or designee for each 
investigative site should electronically  submit the subject's DXA images to the central 
reader for review and analy sis following acquisition.  Subject eligibility  and treatment 
management will be made based on the central reader review.  Sites will receive reports 
from the central reader detailing the results (including T -scores and BMD % change from 
baseline, as applicable) of the DXA scans performed.  Site training and qualifications, 
including assessment of instruments, will be evaluated/approved b y the central reader 
prior to screening the first subject.  I nstructions on calibration and standardization of 
instruments and any additional required information will be specified in a manual from 
the central reader that will be provided to all study sites.  Sites will need to obtain 
approval from the central reader prior to initiating study  scans.
A DXA scan will be performed during Screening Period and sent to the central reader to 
determine eligibility  and serve as the baseline scan for subject management.  Subjects 
with a T-score of < – 2.0 at the lumber spine, total hip or femoral neck on the screening 
DXA scan wil l not be eligible to enter the stud y. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
76
During the Treatment Period, DXA scans will be performed for all subjects at Months 6, 
12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42 and 48 and will be submitted to the central reader for review and 
analysis.  The central reader will be blin ded to the subject's treatment assignment (in the 
12-month Treatment Period), but not to the corresponding time point.
If the results of an y post -baseline DXA prior to and including Month 48, as read b y the 
central reader selected for the study, document a T -score of < – 2.5 in the lumbar spine, 
total hip orfemoral neck, the subject must be discontinued from study drug dos ing and 
will enter the Follow -Up Period.
Subjects with a BMD decrease of > 8% in the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck 
(any of the three regions) on any DXA scan performed during the Treatment Period 
(i.e., Months 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 42) must be discontinued from study  drug dosing 
and will enter the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period.
DXA scans are also required if a subject premature discontinues for the following reasons:
●Subjects who discontinue prior to the Treatment Month 6 visit only  if the
reason for premature discontinuation is due to the occurrence of a fracture or 
any newl y diagnosed bone condition
●Subjects who discontinue any  time at the time of or after the Treatment 
Month 6 visit unless a DXA scan has been performed within 3 months of
Premature Discontinuation.
However, if a subject is being discontinued from the study due to a T -score of < – 2.5 in 
any region (the lumber spine, total hip or femoral neck), BMD decrease from baseline of 
>8% in an y region, or TA MD assessment, additiona l DXA scans do not need to be 
performed as a part of the Premature Discontinuation visit procedures.  In these 
circumstances, the subject would enter into the Post- Treatment Follow -Up Period and 
continue with required BMD evaluations. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
77
DXA scans of the lumb ar spine, total hip, and femoral neck will be obtained at Post -
Treatment Follow -Up Period at Months 6 and/or 12, except for subjects who prematurel y 
discontinued less than 3 months during the Treatment Period.
If the BMD percent change from baseline of an ypost-baseline DXA cannot be provided 
by the central reader (i.e., due to scanner changes), then the TA MD must be consulted to 
confirm if the subject can continue study  drug dosing.  A BMD decrease at any  anatomic 
location (lumber spine, total hip orfemo ral neck) that results in discontinuation from the 
study  should be reported as an adverse event (Section 6.1.1 ).
Clinical Laboratory Tests
Samples will be obtained for the laboratory  tests listed in Table 4, at the time points

Laboratory  samples indicated in Table 4will be assessed using a certified central 
laboratory  selected for this study  and these data will be used for data anal ysis.  The central 
laboratory  will provide instructions regarding the collection (including an y fasting 
requirements), processin g and shipping of samples.  Blood draws should be performed 
after vital signs and ECG recording are conducted at a visit.
Clinical chemistry  samples should be obtained in the morning following an overnight fast 
(minimum of 8 hours); however, there may  be c ircumstances when the sample is obtained 
later in the day  and/or not under fasting conditions.  If the sample was obtained with less  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
79
than 8 hours of fasting, the source documents and the lab requisition should be marked to 
indicate that the sample was obta ined under non -fasting conditions.
All clinical laboratory samples will be shipped to the central laboratory , with the 
exception of the venous blood sample for alkaline hematin anal ysis which will be sent to 
the Alkaline Hematin Laboratory  during screening.
The laboratory  results will be provided by  the central laboratory  to the investigative site 
where they  will be reviewed, signed and dated b y the I nvestigator.  For any  value outside 
of the reference range, the Investigator will review and indica te on the report if the result 
is clinically  significant (CS) or not clinically  significant (NCS).  The Investigator will 
evaluate clinically  significant laboratory  values per standard of care which may  include 
repeating the test to verify the out -of-range value.  Clinically  significant laboratory  
abnormalities post randomization may  be documented as adverse events, depending on 
the interpretation of the Investigator (Section 6.0).
All screening laboratory  results must be reviewed prior to randomization, including an y 
repeated test results.  Screening laboratory  tests may  be repeated one time prior to Day  1, 
however, results must satisfy  entry  criteri a prior to randomization.  Subjects will not be 
randomized on Day  1 if Screening laboratory  results do not meet entry  criteria or are 
assessed as clinically  significant by  the Investigator.  The laboratory  test results obtained 
from the Day  1 pre -dose samp les will serve as the baseline for clinical assessment.
The Investigator will receive Sponsor defined alerts from the central lab.  The Investigator 
will review the lab alerts and assess clinical significance for potential adverse events.
Blood samples for biomarker, exploratory  research, and Pharmacokinetic (PK) anal ysis 
will be collected and processed as indicated in Section 5.3.1.2 and Section 5.3.2 (PK).  
Samples will be shipped to the Central Laboratory by  the Study  Site and then shipped b y 
the Central Laboratory  to AbbVie for anal ysis.

COV ID-19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
If travel restrictions or other changes in local regulations in light of the COVID- 19 
pandemic prevent the subject from having blood drawn for laboratory  testing at the stud y 
site, subject can be res cheduled to return within 30 day s to have blood drawn.
Study  drug administration may  be continued provided the investigator has reviewed all 
prior laboratory  results and confirms and discusses with the subject that there areno 
safet y concerns for the subj ect to continue use of the study  drug in the absence of current 
labs. If the Investigator has any concerns the TA MD should be contacted.
Lipid Panel
The lipid panel consists of LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides and total 
cholesterol; and should be obtained in the morning following an overnight fast (minimum 
of 8 hours); however, there may  be circumstances when the sample is obtained later in the 
day and/or not under fasting conditions.  If the sample was obtained with less than 8 hours 
of fasting, the Source Documents and the lab requisition should be marked to indicate that 
the sample was obtained under non -fasting conditions.
Serology Testing for Hepatitis and HIV
Subjects will be tested for HAV- IgM, HBsAg, HCV Ab, HIV and anti -HIV Ab by  the 
central laboratory  for all subjects during the Screening Period.  If an y of these tests are 
positive or reactive, the subject is excluded from study  participation.  Borderline hepatitis 
test results should be repeated.
The results of the HIV and anti -HIVAb testing will be retained confidentially  by the 
study  site.
Optional Testing for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia
Gonorrhea and chlamy dia testing can be ordered at the I nvestigator's discretion during the 
Screening and Treatment Periods, to test for active gonor rhea or chlam ydia prior to  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
81
performing the endometrial biopsy .  These samples will be sent to the central laboratory  
for anal ysis.  If the Investigator determines that an abnormal test result can be treated, 
treatment will be outside of the protocol.  Follo w-up chlamy dia/gonorrhea testing (per 
instructions from the central lab) can be performed after treatment at the Investigator's 
discretion.
Endocrine Panel
The endocrine panel consists of the following analy tes:  FSH and reflexive TSH.
Pregnancy Testing
Urine pregnancy  tests will be performed as outlined in Appendix C, in all subjects 
regardless of sexual activity  status or method of contraception, including subjects who are 
surgically  sterilized.
The urine pregnancy  test result on Day  1 must be reviewed and confirmed to be negative 
prior to randomization.  Prior to performing the SIS and endometrial biopsy procedures, 
the subject must have a confirm ed and documented negative urine pregnancy test within 
24 hours of the procedure(s).  In addition, during the Treatment Period, the urine 
pregnancy  test must be negative prior to providing subjects with their next supply  of stud y 
drug, (including an unsche duled visit at which study drug is dispensed).
Home urine pregnancy  test kits will be provided to subjects during the Treatment Period 
for use at home when subjects are not required to come to the site (e.g., phone contact 
visits and prior to certain study procedures).  Subjects will self -administer the tests and 
report the result to the site during phone visits or within 24 hours prior to undergoing 
certain stud y procedures.  Subjects reported test results will be entered in the source and 
eCRF.
A positive urine pregnancy test result (including a home urine pregnancy test) must be 
confirmed with a quantitative serum pregnancy test.  The subject should temporarily  
discontinue study  drug administration while waiting for the results of the serum  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
82
pregnancy  test.  If a serum pregnancy  test result is positive at any  time during the 
Treatment Period, the site will immediately  inform the subject to discontinue study  drug 
(Section 6.1.6).  If a subject is confirmed as pregnant, the subject will be prematurel y 
discontinued from the study .
If the subject becomes pregnant at an y time after randomization up through 30 days post 
last dose of study  drug, an ultrasound examination will be performed during the 
firsttrimester of pregnancy to assess the gestational age and estimated date of delivery .  
Refer to Section 6.1.6 for instructions on reporting of a pregnancy  to the Sponsor and the 
required follow- up on the subject's fetus, pregnancy and infant outcomes.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
In the event that a subject or study  personne l cannot come to the site for a study  visit 
requiring a urine pregnancy  test because of the COVID -19 pandemic, home pregnancy  
test kits may  be provided to subjects to self -administer at home and report results to study  
site over the phone. Sites should document the results in source.  If a urine pregnancy test 
cannot be completed, the site will need to reach out to the TA MD to determine further 
action and if stud y drug should be discontinued.
Sanitary Product Collection for Alkaline Hematin Assay
Quantitative measurement of the volume of MBL will be performed using the alkaline 
hematin method.  Menstrual blood loss will be assessed in all subjects using validated 
sanitary  products, also referred to as "validated" products.  Validated products have 
undergone anal ytical testing by  the anal ytical lab to confirm adequate precision and 
accuracy  of blood recovery  as well as no or limited interference with the alkaline hematin 
method.
Subjects will start to collect their sanitary products in the Screening Period over the 
course of 2 to 3 menstrual cy cles to determine eligibility  for randomization based on 
MBL. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
83
Starting in Screening, subjects will be dispensed sanitary collection kits that consist of 
validated sanitary  products, product collection bags and a keg with screw -on lid for 
storage as provided by the vendor.  It is important that only the sanitary products provided 
by the Sponsor are used during the stud y.  Validated sanitary products may include:
●Tampax tampons (Regular, Super or Super -Plus absorbe ncy)
●Stayfree Maxi Pads (Regular, Super Long or Overnight absorbency )
●Carefree Original Long Unscented pantiliners 
Subjects will be required to collect and retain all sanitary products on days with menstrual 
bleeding or spotting (subjects must be instruc ted to collect and return all used or 
worn products even if there is no visible blood on the products or if non -validated 
products were used) as described in the Alkaline Hematin Laboratory  Manual.
The dispensation and collection requirements in the Screen ing Period is outlined in

Screening Product Collection Vi sits
Subjects will be dispensed a product collection kit and will collect sanitary products on 
days with bleeding or spotting.  Subjects will visit the site within approximately  5 day s 
after cessation of bleeding or spotting for Screening Menstrual Cycles 1 and 2, and if 
applicable, Screening Menstrual Cy cle 3 Product Collection Visits.  At each Screening 
Product Collection Visit, sanitary  products to measure MBL will be collected and a 
venous blood sample will be obtained.  The site will submit the sanitar y products and 
venous blood sample to the Alkaline Hematin Laboratory  for anal ysis of MBL volume to 
determine eligibility .  To be eligible for the study based on MBL, a subject must 
demonstrate > 80 mL for each of 2 menses in Screening.  Subjects will cont inue to collect 
sanitary  products in screening until the results confirm a second eligible menstrual cycle 
has been met.
Additional screening menstrual cy cles may  be permitted; however the situation must be 
discussed with AbbVie prior to allowing additiona l product collections.  Screening 
Menstrual Cy cle 1 for menstrual bleeding assessment begins with the first day of bleeding 
or spotting associated with menses.
If a subject has a known history  of HMB and her first screening MBL amount is ≤ 80 mL  
due to a v ariety of factors that may  include but is not limited to the following:
●missed collection of products,
●submission of non- validated products (products that have not been tested to 
determine the level of interference with the alkaline hematin assay), or 
●an atypical menstrual cycle, or
●if a subject misses the collection of sanitary  products for one of the screening 
menstrual cy cles
The Study  Site must consult with AbbVie for further instructions, which may include the 
collection of sanitary products for an a dditional menstrual cy cle.  The subject may  still be  
Elagolix (ABT -620)

# There may be instances when a 4thcycle needs to be collected due to certain circumstances.  Study Site must also 
consult AbbVie for approval in the event a 4thcycle is needed to determine eligibility based on MBL.
* If Screening Cycle 1 blood loss is ≤ 60 mL, study site must consult AbbVie for approval to collect sanitary 
products for additional menstrual cycles in screening.  Subjects with a Screening Cycle 1 blood loss between 
60and 80 mL may collect Screening Cycle 2 to determine eligibility.
Sites will contact the I nteractive Response Technology  (IRT) to register the date of the 
visit for the first subject who completes the Screening C ycle 2 Product Collec tion Visit.  
The registration of this visit will trigger the initial shipment of study drug to the study site.
Return of Sanitary  Products to Alkaline Hematin Laboratory
The site will submit the sanitary  products and applicable venous blood sample collecte d 
during the screening period to the Alkaline Hematin L aboratory  for anal ysis as outlined in 
the Alkaline Hematin Laboratory  Manual.
Use of Non -Validated Products
All subjects are required to only  use validated products provided b y the Sponsor, however 
in cases when a subject used non- validated products (a product not provided for use in the 
study ), the subject should be instructed to collect and submit the non -validated products to 
the site.  Site staff is to ensure subject is re -educated on the use of val idated products and 
should be source documented.

Electronic Questionnaires and Quality of Life Assessments
Prior to the start of the study, detailed instructions and training for stud y site staff 
administering these scales will be provided by AbbVie and/or its designee.  The objective 
of this training is to establish uniformity  across sites in administration of these rating 
instruments.  The following questionnaires will be completed b y the Subjects and/or the 
Investigator or Site Staff, as appropriate at t he time points indicated in Appendix C, Study  
Activities, and should be administered prior to an y other study procedures being 
performed at that vis it.  Subjects and Site Staff will be asked to record their responses 
directly  into the electronic device provided to site.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
In the event that a subject or study  personnel cannot come to the site be cause of the 
COVID- 19 pandemic, subject visits may  be conducted via phone or video conference.  
The C -SSRS, UFS -QoL and PGI C-MB may  be administered by  site staff over the phone 
or video conference.  In this situation, sites will read the PRO questions and response 
options to the subject, record the subject's responses on paper (source), and transcribe into 
the electronic device provided to the site.  The subject's ability to view the PRO to 
understand the questions and response options should be preserved. Sites may  share the 
questionnaire b y video conference or send the questionnaires (email or hard copy) to the 
subjects to allow them to read/understand the questions and responses when the subject is 
providing responses over the phone.  The date and time o f PRO data collection should be 
recorded in the source along with who collected the information.
Reason for Study  Participation
In order to better understand the reason why a study participant has decided to enroll in 
this study , subjects will complete the single -question Reason for Study  Participation 
Questionnaire at the Day  1 Visit. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6

Physician Surgery  Questionnaire
Each ph ysician will be asked to complete the Ph ysician Surgery  Questionnaire (PSQ) to 
evaluate the likelihood that the Phy sician would conside r surgery  or a surgical procedure 
as one of the treatment options related to uterine fibroids for the subject.
Uterine Fibroid Sy mptoms Quality  of Life (UFS -QoL) (4 -Week Recall)
The UFS -QoL is a disease -specific self -administered questionnaire used to meas ure 
health- related quality  of life in women with sy mptomatic uterine fibroids.  Each subject 
will be asked to complete a UFS -QoL Questionnaire8using 4 -week recall to report 
fibroid- related sy mptoms experienced during the previous 4 weeks.
Patient Global I mpression of Change –Menstrual Bleeding (PGI C-MB)
Subjects will use the PGIC -MB to assess the change in their severit y of menstrual 
bleeding (from very  much improved to very  much worse) since initiation of study  drug b y 
choosing one of seven responses.
Columbia Suicide Severity  Rating Scale (C -SSRS)
The C -SSRS is a sy stematically  administered instrument d eveloped to track suicidal 
adverse events across a treatment study.  The instrument is designed to assess suicidal 
behavior and ideation, track and assess all suicidal events, as well as the lethality of 
attempts.  Additional features assessed include frequency , duration, controllability , reason 
for ideation, and deterrents.  The Screening -Baseline/Since Last Visit C -SSRS 
questionnaire will be administered by  the site staff using the electronic tablet at the time 
points specified in Appendix C.
During Screening or at the Day  1 visit, prior to randomization, any  subject noted to have 
suicidal ideation with plan within the last y ear, either via answering "yes" to question 4 
and/or question 5 to the suicidal ideation portion of the C -SSRS, or via clinical interview, 
is not eligible for randomization.  If the subject expresses suicidal ideation on the C -SSRS  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
88
or via clinical interview at any  time during the study , the Investigator should take 
appropriate action and then notify  the AbbVie TA MD.  Appropriate steps will be taken to 
protect the subject (including possible discontinuation from the study and referral for 
appropriate ps ychiatric care).  The C -SSRS will be administered by site staff at the time 
points outlined in Appendix C.  The C- SSRS administered at the Day  1 Visit will serve as 
the baseline for clinical assessment.
Return to Menses
Subjects will be asked about return to menses using the Return to Menses Questionnaire 
in the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period, as outlined in the Study  Activities, Appendix C.  
Site staff will ask subjects if they have had a menstrual period since discontinuation of 
study  drug and record subjects' responses on the site tablet.  If the subject indicates she 
has not returned to full menses, site staff will continue assess menstruation and repeat the 
questionnaire at subsequent post -treatment follow -up visits, as applicable.  The date when 
full menses returned will be documented in the source documents and eCRFs .
Randomization and Assignment of Subject Numbers
The site will contact Interactive Response Technology (IRT) during the Washout or 
Screening Period to obtain a subject (Screening) number after the subject has signed the 
informed consent.  Consecutive and unique subject numbers will be assigned.  The same 
subject number will be used to identify  the subject throughout the Screening, Treatment 
and Post -Treatment Follow -Up Periods.  In Screening, the site will contact IRT at the 
Screening C ycle 2 Product Colle ction Visit to register the date of the visit for the first 
subject who completes the Screening C ycle 2 Product Collection Visit.  The registration 
of this visit will trigger shipment of clinical drug supplies to the study  site.  If the subject 
is not randomized into the study , the reason for screen failure will be documented in the 
eCRF and the site will register the subject as a screen failure in IRT.
At the Day  1 Visit, eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups b y 
using IRT and prov iding the subject number the subject received during Screening or  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
89
Washout.  During the randomization contact session, a unique randomization number and 
study  drug kit numbers will be assigned b y the IRT according to a randomization schedule 
generated b y the Statistics department at AbbVie.
During the Treatment Period, sites will register each on -site visit in I RT in order to obtain 
the appropriate amount of scheduled re -suppl y of study drug to dispense to each subject.  
In the event stud y drug becomes lost or damaged, the site can contact IRT to obtain an 
unscheduled re -suppl y of study drug kit numbers to dispense to the subject.  Sites will 
register subjects as "Completed" or "Discontinued" (if the subject prematurely  
discontinues) at the end of the Treatme nt Period and will also indicate whether the subject 
will enter the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period.
5.3.1.2 Collection and Handling of Biomarker and Optional 
Exploratory  Research Samples
Samples for biomarker and optional exploratory research will be collected.  Subjects will 
have the option to provide samples for exploratory research.  Subjects may still participate 
in the main study  even if they  decide not to participate in this optional exploratory  
research.
All research samples should be collected, labeled, an d shipped as outlined in the study  
specific lab manual.  AbbVie (or people or companies working with AbbVie) will store 
the samples in a secure storage space with adequate measures to protect confidentiality.  
The samples will be retained while research on Elagolix (or drugs of this class) or uterine 
fibroids and related conditions continues, but for no longer than 20 years after study 
completion.  The procedure for obtaining and documenting informed consent for 
exploratory  research samples is discussed in Section 9.3.
Biomarker Blood Samples for Estradiol (E2) Assay 
A single blood sample will be collected at each time point indicated in Appendix Cto be 
used for the anal ysis of E2.  The blood samples for assay  of estradiol will be collected in 
one 6 mL  evacuated collection tube without anticoagulant (red cap, no gel separators to be

used).  Sufficie nt blood volume will be collected to provide approximately  3 mL  serum 
from each sample.
On Day  1, estradiol samples will be collected prior to dose.  The date and time of 
collection will be recorded on the Central Laboratory  Requisition Form.  Samples 
collected at all visits other than Day 1 will be drawn at an y time during the visit.
Samples for Pharmacogenetic Exploratory  Research (Optional)
Optional whole blood samples for DNA (Deox yribonucleic acid)  and RNA (Ribonucleic 
acid) isolation will be collecte d on Day  1, Month 12 and Premature Discontinuation Visit 
(if applicable) from each subject who consents to provide samples for exploratory 
research.

Exposures of elagolix and norethindrone will be summarized and elagolix concentrations 
may be used to develop a population PK mode l.  Additional parameters may  be calculated 
if useful for the interpretation of the data.
5.3.6 Biomarker and Exploratory  Research Variables
The ty pes of biomarkers to be anal yzed may  include, but are not limited to, nucleic acids, 
proteins, lipids, metabolites or hormone levels (E2).  The samples may  be analy zed as part 
of a multi -study  assessment of factors influencing the subjects' response to Elagolix (or 
drugs of the same or similar class) or the development and progression of uterine fibroids 
or related conditions.  The samples may  also be used to develop new diagnostic tests, 
therapies, research methods or technologies.  The results from these anal yses are 
exploratory in nature and may  not be included with the study  report.
5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy  or Assessment
Each subject has the right to withdraw from the study  at any  time.  In addition, the 
Investigator may  discontinue a subject from the study  at any  time if the Investigator 
considers it necessary  for any  reason, including the occurrence of an a dverse event or 
noncompliance with the protocol.  Subjects who withdraw from the stud y will not be 
replaced unless it is mutually  agreed upon, in writing, by the Investigator and AbbVie.  
Each subject will be withdrawn from the study  if any  of the followin g occur:
●The subject decides to withdraw consent for an y reason.
●The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject.
●Clinically  significant deterioration of the subject's medical status as determined 
by the investigator.
●The subject requir es surgical intervention for treatment of uterine fibroids and 
menstrual bleeding or other procedures including hy sterectom y, myomectomy, 
uterine artery  embolization, high intensity  focused ultrasound (HIFU), 
endometrial ablation, dilat ion and curettage (D &C), etc. during the Treatment 
Period.  I n the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period these procedures do not  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
93
warrant withdrawal if performed during the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period 
unless a hy sterectomy  with bilateral salpingo -oophorectom y (BSO) is 
performed in the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period and the subject does not 
plan to use Hormone Replacement Therap y within 1 month of the surgery  date.
●The subject becomes pregnant or has a positive serum pregnancy  test.
●The subject has SGPT/ALAT or SGOT/ASAT elevation > 5 times the upper 
limit of normal, confirmed upon repeat testing during the Treatment Period.
●The subject develops clinically  significant gy necological findings or condition 
on either the TAU/TVU (confirmed b y repeat TAU/TVU and/or SIS and/or 
office h ysteroscopy ) or endometrial biopsy  that in the opinion of the 
Investigator or AbbVie TA MD would preclude the subject from continuing in 
the Treatment Period due to safet y reasons.
● The results of an y post -baseline DXA prior to Month 48 document a T -score 
< –2.5 in the lumbar spine, total hip or femoral neck, a BMD decrease of > 8% 
in the lumbar spine, total hip, or femoral neck, or due to TA MD assessment 
when the BMD percent change from baseline cannot be provided b y the central 
reader.
●The subject requires use of prohibited medications to manage or treat bone 
mineral density  changes during the Treatment Period as described in 
Section 5.2.3.5 .  Subject continuation in the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period 
is at the discretion of the AbbVie TA MD.
●Heav y menstrual bleeding during the Treatment Period that requires a blood 
transfusion at an y time after having taken 28 days of study drug .
●In the Investigator' s opinion, the subject is unable or unwilling to comply  with 
study -related assessments and procedures .
●Any other medical reason that AbbVie or the Investigator deems appropriate.
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
In the event that a subject withdraws or is prematurely discontinued from study drug 
treatment, the subject should complete the Premature Discontinuation Visit as soon as 
possible (preferabl y within 2 –7 day s of last dose of study  drug, if possible) and u ndergo  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
94
study  procedures as outlined in Appendix C.  Subjects who prematurel y discontinue 
during the Treatment Period are expected to enter the Post Treatment Follow -Up Period 
for up to 12 months unless discontinuation is due to pregnancy.
These procedures should not interfere with the initiation of any new treatments or 
therapeutic modalities the Investigator determines are necessary  to treat the sub ject's 
condition.  The reason(s) for the discontinuation from the Treatment Period will be 
recorded in source and in the eCRFs.
If a subject becomes pregnant during the Treatment Period or within 30 days of the last 
dose of study  drug, no additional study  procedures, except an ultrasound will be 
conducted.  Refer to Section 6.1.6 for instructions on reporting of a pregnancy to the 
Sponsor and the req uired follow -up on the subject/fetus and live births.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue will have a DXA scan performed at the Premature 
Discontinuation Visit:
●Subjects who discontinue prior to the Treatment Month 6 visit only  if the 
reason for premature discontinuation is due to the occurrence of a fracture or 
any newl y diagnosed bone condition.
●Subjects who discontinue any  time at the time of or after the Treatment 
Month 6 visit, unless a DXA scan has been performed within the prior 
3months of Prematur e Discontinuation.
Subjects who prematurely discontinue from treatment and enter Post -Treatment Follow 
Up Period and have had a TAU/TVU and DXA within the prior 3 months will not be 
required to repeat these procedures at the Premature Discontinuation Visi t.
If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved 
laboratory  result that is clinically  significant (as determined by  the Investigator), the 
Investigator will attempt to provide follow -up until a satisfactory  clinical resolution of the 
laboratory  result or adverse event is achieved. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
95
Upon discontinuation from the Treatment Period, all used, unused and unopened stud y 
drug containers will be returned to the study site.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may  termin ate this study  prematurel y, either in its entirety or at an y study  site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The Investigator may  also terminate the study  at his/her site for reasonable 
cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  
Advance notice is not required by either part y if the study is stopped due to safet y 
concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediatel y 
notify  the investigator b y telephone and subsequently  provide written instructions for 
study  termination.
The following procedures for study  discontinuation will be followed:
●If the Sponsor has decided to prematurely discontinue the study, the Sponsor 
will promptly  notify  in writing the Investigator as well as regulatory  authorities 
of the decision and give detailed reasons for the discontinuation.
●The Investigator must promptly  notify  the IRB/IEC and give detailed reasons 
for the discontinuation.
●The Inv estigator must promptly  notify  the enrolled subjects of the premature 
discontinuation and administer appropriate treatments such as replacement of 
the treatment regimen, if applicable, b y other appropriate regimens.
5.4.3 Treatment Interruption
AbbVie or the Investigator may  request that a subject temporaril y discontinue study drug 
administration, which will be referred to as "treatment interruption."  The following are 
examples for reasons when the AbbVie TA MD must be notified in order to assess 
whether a subj ect should undergo temporary  treatment interruption:
●Adverse event, that based on clinical judgment, requires temporary suspension 
of treatment or prevents a subject from taking study  drug 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
96
●Due to malfunction of barrier contraception or unprotected intercou rse
●After a positive urine pregnancy  test, while waiting for results of the serum test
●Clinical laboratory  findings that require repeating or confirmation of a 
clinically  significant value (e.g., may  necessitate discontinuation from the 
study ).
Additional ly, there may  be times when a subject has had treatment interruption due to 
having forgotten to take study  medication, lost study  medication, etc.  If the subject has 
missed 10 or more consecutive day s of dosing (with either elagolix/E2/NETA or Placebo), 
the AbbVie TA MD must be consulted to determine whether the subject may  resume 
study  drug administration or continue in the Treatment Period.
These examples are not all- inclusive; if the I nvestigator has an y questions, these should be 
directed to the AbbVie TA MD who will provide a recommendation.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments A dministered
Subjects will be randomly assigned b y IRT to receive one of the following treatment 
groups for a total of up to 48 months of treatment:
●elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 
0.5 mg QD) (n = 335) for 48 months 
●placebo (n = 165) for the first 12 months, then switch to elagolix 300 mg BID 
plus E2/NETA QD for the remaining 36 months
Safety  of using elagolix (300 mg BID) in combination with estradiol 
1.0mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg has alread y been evaluated in clinical studies of 
6-month duration as discussed earlier in Section 3.2.3.

The elagolix study  drug, consisting of elagolix or matching placebo, will be supplied in a 
carton.  The E2 /NETA study  drug, consisting of E2/NETA or matching placebo, will be 
supplied in a separate carton.  The subject will take the first elagolix dose (morning dose) 
and first E2/NETA dose of study  drug at the study site on Day  1 (Randomization) whether 
the subjects visit is scheduled in the morning or afternoon.  Subjects will be instructed to 
self-administer their study  drug throughout the 12 -month Treatment Period.
Year 2, 3 and 4 (Open- Label) Treatment Period
Study  drug treatment after Treatment Month 12 wi ll be open- label in which study  drug 
will be dispensed every  3 months (during the on -site visits).  The elagolix study  drug will 
be supplied in a carton and the E2/NETA study  drug will be supplied in a separate carton.
Study  drug will be taken orally  twice daily for the entire 48 -month Treatment Period.  A 
morning dose of 1 tablet (elagolix or placebo) and 1 capsule (E2/NETA or placebo) and 
an evening dose of 1 tablet (elagolix or placebo) should be taken each day approximately 
12 hours apart.  Stud y drug s hould be taken with approximately  8 oz. (240 mL ) of water  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6

without regard to food.  Study  drug should be taken at approximately  the same time each 
morning and evening to promote compliance.
If the subject forgets to take the morning dose, she should be inst ructed to take the 
morning dose as soon as possible and take the evening dose as scheduled.  If the subject 
forgets to take the evening dose, she should be instructed to take the evening dose as soon 
as possible; if the subject misses the evening dose completely  (until the next morning), the 
subject should only  take the next morning dose.
On day s when the subject visits the study  site for the scheduled visits, she will take her 
morning dose at home, prior to the visit.  The evening dose will be taken from t he newly  
dispensed supply  of study  drug.  Subjects must return all study  drug containers at each 
scheduled visit.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
Depending on the local regulations, provisioning of study  drug for direct -to-patie nt (DTP) 
and direct -from ‑patient (DFP) transfer because of the COVID- 19 pandemic will be 
available per request.  AbbVie should be notified.
Sites can utilize Marken and/or another local courier for drug shipment in such 
circumstances.  Shipments may  also i nclude other study  supplies (e.g., pregnancy  tests, 
paper copies of PROs).  AbbVie has set up an agreement with Marken (third -party 
vendor) for sites to use to ship study  drug to (and from as applicable) subjects.  Shipments 
of study  drugs from the study  site to a subject's home will be appropriately  temperature -
controlled (qualified shipper or temperature monitoring) within the labeled storage 
conditions.  Signature is required upon delivery ; due to COVID -19 related social 
distancing, this may  be provided by the courier after delivery .  Documentation of the 
shipment is to be retained by  the clinical site.
●Sites will be responsible for meeting IRB reporting requirements and 
submitting the booking form to the local I RB (as applicable). 
Elagolix (ABT -620)

The investigator must discuss the DTP/DFP process with the subject:
●Obtain consent to provide delivery  information to Marken and/or local courier 
and document this in the source.
●Obtain results of required safet y procedures (e.g., urine pregnancy testing) 
before registering sub ject dispensation of study  drug in IRT.
●Confirm that the subject will be available to accept delivery.
●The site will follow up with the subject after shipment is received.
●The subject should maintain the drug containers, as well as an y unused drug for 
return to site.
Sites will be required to retain documentation of the shipment for the IP accountability  
and monitoring.  AbbVie will not receive subject identifying information related to these 
shipments, as the site will work directl y with the courier.

System (ATEMS) immediately  by the site staff and study drug should not be dispensed 
until ATEMS or AbbVie deems the drug as acceptable .
The investigational products are for investigational use only and are to be used only 
within the context of this study .  The study drug supplied for this study must be 
maintained under adequate securit y and stored under the conditions specified on the la bel 
until dispensed for subject use or returned to AbbVie.  Returned stud y drug should not be 
re-dispensed to the subject.
5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
All subjects will be centrally  randomized using an I RT.  Before the stud y is initiat ed, 
contact information and user guidelines for IRT will be provided to each site.  Study  drug 
will be dispensed at the study  visits outlined in Appendix C, Study  Activities.
As subjects enter into either the Washout Period or the Screening Period, a unique subject 
number will be assigned to each subject b y the IRT.  This unique subject number will be 
used for each subject throughout the stud y.
After confirming that the subject has met randomization criteria and prior to the Day  1 
(randomization) dose, a unique randomization number will be provided via I RT.
Subjects will be randomly assigned b y IRT to receive one of the treatment groups as 
outlined in Section 5.5.1 upon entry  into the 1 2-month Treatment Period.  At the Year 1 
Treatment Month 12, all subjects will be re -assigned by  IRT to receive open label elagolix 
300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD), 
including subjects previously  randomized to placebo.  S ubjects re -assigned by  IRT will 
not be assigned new subject numbers.
Study  drug must not be dispensed without contacting IRT.  Study  drug may only  be 
dispensed to subjects enrolled in the study  according to kit numbers provided by  the IRT. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
103
The randomizatio n schedule will be computer generated b y the Statistics Department at 
AbbVie, North Chicago, IL prior to the start of the study.  A cop y of all of the 
randomization schedules will be kept by the Statistics Department at AbbVie and a cop y 
will be forwarded to the IRT provider.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Selection of the doses used for this study  is discussed in Section 5.6.4.  Subje cts will be 
randomized to one of the two treatment groups as described in Section 5.5.1 .
Study  drug will be initiated at the study  site on Day  1 (R andomization).  Subjects will be 
instructed to self -administer study  drug twice a day  (once in the morning and once in the 
evening approximately  12 hours apart) with approximately  8 oz (240 mL) of water.  
Subjects must return all study  drug containers (use d, unused or unopened) at the 
subsequent on -site visit.
5.5.5 Blinding
5.5.5.1 Blinding of Investigational Product
Each active elagolix dose will be identical in appearance to its matched placebo; each 
active E2/NETA dose will be identical in appearance to its matched p lacebo.  The study  
site staff and subject will remain blinded to each subject's double -blind treatment 
assignment throughout the course of the stud y.  The I RT will provide access to blinded 
subject treatment information during the stud y.
AbbVie must be not ified before the blind is broken unless identification of the study  drug 
is required for medical emergency; i.e., situation in which the knowledge of the specific 
blinded treatment will affect the immediate management of the subject/patient's 
conditions (e.g., antidote is available).  AbbVie must then be notified within 24 hours of 
the blind being broken.  The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded 
in the source documents and eCRF, as applicable. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
104
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
The Investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will 
administer/dispense study drug onl y to subjects enrolled in the study in accordance with 
the protocol.  The stud y drug must not be used for reasons other than that described in the 
protocol.
Subjects wi ll be instructed to return all study drug kits (used/unused/unopened) to the 
study  site staff at study  visits throughout the Treatment Period or Premature 
Discontinuation visit (if applicable).
Subjects should be advised of the importance of treatment comp liance.  Study  drug should 
be taken consistentl y at approximately  the same time in the morning and evening each 
day.
During 1 2-month Treatment Period, daily  recordings of stud y drug dosing will be 
obtained using a compliance packaging blister card for all subjects (for both 
elagolix/E2/NETA and matching placebo).
During the Treatment Period, on -site or phone visit or Premature Discontinuation visit, 
the subject will be asked to confirm whether doses were taken and to provide the dates 
and approximate times of the last 4 scheduled doses prior to the study visit.  The subject 
reported data will be recorded in source and in the eCRF.
Sites should instruct subjects not to remove extra or multiple medications from the blister 
cards all at once (e.g., transferring multiple doses into a separate pill organizer) and 
should only  remove the study  drug from the blister when it is the time to take the dose.  If 
the subject has removed a number of extra medications, sites should re -train the subjects 
on the importance of only  removing study  medication when it is time to take the dose and 
record re -training in the source documents.
Compliance packaging will be used in the 1 2-month Treatment Period onl y and data 
collected from kit scanning will be used for exposure response analyses. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
105
During the Treatment Period, the site staff will review study drug compliance with 
subjects either during an on -site or phone visits.  During the phone visits, subjects will be 
asked if they  are taking the study  drug as indicated and information will be documented in 
source.
During on -site visits any  discrepancies in the number of tablets/capsules to be taken and 
the number of tablets/capsules returned do not add up to the number of tablets/capsules 
dispensed, an explanation and appropriate inform ation, including re -training if provided, 
should be recorded in the source documents.
If a subject missed more than 10 consecutive day s of taking stud y drug, the AbbVie TA 
SD should be notified to determine whether the subject may  continue.
5.5.7 Drug A ccountabi lity
The study  Investigator or designee will verify  via direct recording in IRT or by  signature 
and date that stud y drug supplies are received intact and in the correct amounts indicated 
on the shipping document Clinical Site Shipment Request (CSSR) or sim ilar shipping 
document.  The shipment receipt must be acknowledged in IRT in order to become 
available for dispensation to subjects.  The I RT must also be contacted when any  subject 
completes or discontinues study  drug.
The I RT will maintain a current and accurate inventory  of all clinical drug supplies, 
accountability , reconciliation, returns and destruction for each site.  The IRT will also 
include the lot number, kit number, CSSR number, the number of blister cards/cartons 
dispensed, initials of person w ho dispensed the drug, and the date stud y drug was 
dispensed for each subject.  I n addition to using IRT inventory , an accurate inventory  of 
study  drug can also be kept by  the site.
An overall accountability of the study drug will be performed and verified by the site 
monitor via I RT throughout the study  and at the study  site closeout visit.  Throughout the 
study  and upon completion or termination of the study , all used, unused and unopened 
containers will be returned to AbbVie according to instructions fro m AbbVie. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)

106
The study  investigator or his/her designated representative agrees not to supply  study  
medication to an y persons not enrolled in the study or not named as a sub -investigator.
Study  drug will be dispensed at the study  visits summarized in Appendix C, Study  
Activities.  Returned study drug should not be re -dispensed to the subject.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
In the event that a subject cannot come to the site because of the COVID -19 pandemic, 
the site may  contact the IRT for kit assignment after ensuring subject is eligible to 
continue with study  drug dosing and confirming that a home urine pregnancy test was 
performed and the result was negative.  Stud y drug dispensing can then be undertaken as 
outlined in Section 5.5.1.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study  Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study  Design and Choice of Control Groups
This Phase 3b study  will be conducted as a randomized, sequential, 12 -month double -
blind placebo- controlled, 36 -month open- label, multi- center stud y in premenopausal 
women 18 to 50 y ears of age with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.
This study  will evaluate the long -term safet y of elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA in 
subjects with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  The study will also assess the impact 
of elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA on BMD in women with HMB associated with 
uterine fibroids after up to 48 months of treatment.
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
The safet y assessments used in this study  are standard, widel y used and generall y 
recognized as reliable, accurate and relevant within the c ontext of this study  design.
Regarding efficacy  measures, HMB is the most common sy mptom of women with uterine 
fibroids.  The quantitation of menstrual blood loss using the alkaline hematin method on 
sanitary  products has been validated b y the analytical t esting laboratory .  Pelvic  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
107
ultrasound and SI S are standard methods for assessing uterine fibroid size, fibroid and 
uterine volume.  Endometrial biopsy  is a standard method for assessing endometrial 
safet y.  DXA is the established gold standard method to assess changes in BMD.
5.6.3 Suitability  of Subject Population
Premenopausal women 18 to 50 y ears of age with HMB (> 80 mL  per menstrual cy cle) 
and uterine fibroids were selected for this study because that is the population who suffer 
from HMB associated with ute rine fibroids.  The lower bound of the age limit (18) was 
chosen based on the relative paucit y of adolescent females with s ymptomatic uterine 
fibroids prior to age 18, and the upper age of 50 is included to reduce the risk of subjects 
becoming menopausal during the stud y.  No studies in females outside of the reproductive 
years are necessary  for this proposed indication.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
The results of the 3- month Phase 2a dose finding, Proof -of-Concept (POC) study  indicate 
that elagolix 300 mg BID was the most effective dose in reducing HMB associated with 
uterine fibroids.  The 6 -month Phase 2b safet y/efficacy  study  confirmed these results and 
also demonstrated that E2/NETA (estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD) was 
effective in preventing BMD loss and ameliorating vasomotor s ymptoms due to estrogen 
suppression.  The data (PK/PD) from the multiple ascending dose (MAD) and 
folliculogenesis studies in healthy  subjects also provide additional support for the targeted 
elagolix dose.  All of these studies have demonstrated an acceptable safet y and tolerability  
profile.
Based on the totality  of safet y and efficacy data, elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA 
(estradiol 1.0 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg QD) was selected for further evaluation in 
Phase 3.  The maximum elagolix dose administered in this study  will not exceed a total 
daily  dose of 600 mg.

6.0 Complaints
A Complaint is any  written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies 
related to the ph ysical characteristics, ide ntity, quality , purit y, potency, durability , 
reliability , safet y, effectiveness, or performance of a product/device after it is released for 
distribution.
Complaints associated with any  component of this investigational product must be 
reported to the Spon sor (Section 6.2.2).  For adverse events, please refer to Section 6.1
through Section 6.1.6.  For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1 Medical Complaints
The investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the stud y.  The investigator will assess and record 
any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or 
sign/sy mptom, severity , time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the 
adverse event to study  drug, and any  action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events 
considered as having "no reasonable possibility " of being associated with study  drug, the 
investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For adverse events to be cons idered 
intermittent, the events must be of similar nature and severit y.  Adverse events, whether in 
response to a query , observed b y site staff, or reported spontaneousl y by the subject will 
be recorded.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactor y conclusion.
6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
109
necessarily  have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be an y unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) 
product, whether or not the event is considered causally  related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional overdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  An y 
worsening of a pre -existing condition or illness is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity  of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse 
event.  Laboratory  abnormalities and changes in vital signs are considered to be adverse 
events only  if they  result in discontinuation from the study , necessitate therapeutic 
medical intervention, and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
A BMD decrease at an y anatomic location (lumber spine, total hip or femoral neck) 
during the Treatment Per iod that leads to discontinuation from study  drug should be 
reported as an adverse event.
An elective surgery /procedure scheduled to occur during a stud y will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery /procedure is being performed for a pre -existing condition and 
the surgery /procedure has been pre planned prior to study  entry .  However, if the pre -
existing condition deteriorates unexpectedl y during the stud y (e.g., surgery performed 
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for w hich the elective 
surgery /procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6

6.1.1.2 Serious A dverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the si te being made aware of the serious 
adverse event.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would 
have resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention 
had n ot been taken.  This does not include an event that 
would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe 
form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for 
any length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay .  
This does not include an emergency  room visit or 
admission to an outpatient facility .
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or an y anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study 
subject.  Disability  is not intended to include experiences 
of relativel y minor medical significance such as headache, 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental 
trauma (e.g., sprained ankle).

Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to Prevent 
Serious OutcomeAn important medical event that may  not be immediately  
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but 
based on medical judgment may  jeopardize the subject 
and may  require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent an y of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of 
subject, life -threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of 
hospitalization, congenital anomal y, or persistent or 
significant disability /incapacity ).  Additionally , any  
elective or spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered 
an important medical event.  Examples of such events 
include allergic bronchospa sm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency  or 
drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.1.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest
For some adverse events, such as SAEs and adverse events of special interest (AESI), 
such as elevated liver transaminases, bone mineral den sity decrease/fractures, and mood 
and depression- related events, hot flashes and other non-bone h ypoestrogenic events, lipid 
abnormalities, cardiovascular events, thromboembolic events, hormonall y sensitive 
malignancies, and alopecia, AbbVie may  require ad ditional information, including family 
history , to be collected and recorded in the eCRF.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event: 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
112
Mild The adverse event is transient and easil y tolerated by  the subject.
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the 
subject's usual activities and may  be incapacitating or life 
threatening.
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of stud y drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event , 
biologic plausibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is sufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship.
No Reasonable 
PossibilityAfter consideration of factors including timing of the event, 
biologic pla usibility , clinical judgment, and potential alternative 
causes, there is insufficient evidence (information) to suggest a 
causal relationship
For causality  assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility  of being 
related to the stud y drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no 
reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug will be considered "not associated."  
In addition, when the investigator has not reported a causalit y or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility  of being related to study  drug is 
given, an Other cause of event must be provided by the Investigator for the serious 
adverse event.

following discontinuation of study  drug administration have elapsed will be collected, 
whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.  All nonserious adver se events 
of bone fracture, clinically significant BMD loss, or newl y diagnosed medically -related 
bone condition will be collected during the Post -Treatment Follow -Up Period, until the 
subject discontinues from study  participation.  In addition, serious ad verse events and 
protocol -related nonserious adverse events will be collected from the time the subject 
signed the study- specific informed consent.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 4.

Supplemental study  case report forms should be completed in the event of COVID- 19 
related missed/virtual visits, study  drug interruptions or discontinuations, or adverse 
events (including capture of specific signs/s ymptoms of infection and testing results).
COVID- 19 infections should be captured as adverse events.  If the event meets the criteria 
for a serious adverse event (SAE), then follow the SAE reporting directions per the 
protocol and above.  The following COVID -19 related supplemental eCRFs should be 
completed:
● COVID- 19 Supplemental Signs/Sy mptoms
● COVID- 19 Status Form
If a subject has a confirmed or suspected COVID -19 infection and stud y drug 
was interrupted, the Investigator should contact the Sponsor emergency 
medical contact listed above before reintroducing study  drug.
6.1.6 Pregna ncy
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject must be reported to AbbVie within 1 working day of the site 
becoming aware of the pregnancy .  Subjects who become pregnant during the Treatment 
or Post -Treatment Follow -Up Periods of the study  must be discontinued (Section 5.4and 
Section 5.4.1).  A positive uri ne pregnancy  test result must be confirmed with a serum 
pregnancy  test.  While waiting for the results of the serum pregnancy  test, study  drug 
should be temporaril y discontinued pending results of the serum pregnancy test.  I f a 
serum pregnancy  test result is positive at any  time during the Treatment Period of the 
study , the site will immediately  inform the subject to discontinue study  drug.  However, 
an ultrasound examination will be performed as early  as possible during the first trimester 
of pregnancy  toassess the gestational age and document an intrauterine pregnancy .  
Information regarding a pregnancy  occurrence in a study  subject and the outcome of the  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
116
pregnancy  will be collected for an y stud y subject with a positive serum pregnancy test 
after receivi ng at least one dose of stud y drug through 30 days following the last dose of 
study  drug .  The site will report a positive pregnancy  test to the Sponsor, will follow the 
course of the subject's pregnancy , and report to the Sponsor on the health of the subj ect 
and fetus at each trimester, the newborn at the first post -delivery  pediatrician visit and the 
infant 6 – 12months post -delivery .
If the subject has a positive serum pregnancy test during the Treatment or Post -Treatment 
Follow -Up Periods of the study ,no additional study procedures, including protocol 
required DXA scans, will be conducted.  The following information on the outcome of the 
pregnancy  should be collected:  fetal outcome (e.g., spontaneous or elective abortion, live 
infant or still birth), date and mode of delivery , birth weight, birth length, gender, an y 
congenital anomal y and medically significant complications during pregnancy or labor or 
delivery .  For live infant births, information on the health of the infant will be collected 
from the first post -delivery  pediatrician visit and at 6 to 12 months after delivery.
For each subject with a confirmed pregnancy , the Investigator will provide information 
about the option to participate in an elagolix pregnancy registry (P18 -954) for pregnancy  
outcomes.  The contact information for the Bloom Pregnancy  Registry  is in the 
Oriahnn/Orilissa label (pregnancy registry telephone number: 1 -833-782-7241).
Pregnancy  in a stud y subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical 
outcome for mo ther or infant, meeting any serious criteria including an elective or 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly  is considered a serious adverse 
event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the 
event.
6.2 Product Complaint
6.2.1 Definition
A Product Complaint is any  Complaint (see Section 6.0for the definition) related to the

the open- label Treatment Period;
2. Subjects randomized to placebo in the 12- month Treatment Period, and switched to 
elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA in the Open -label Treatment Period.
Statistical tests will only  be made in the double -blind Treatment Period.  No statistical 
tests will be made in the Open- label Treatment Period and the Post -Treatment Follow -Up 
Period.
8.1.2 Data Sets A nalyzed
Full Analysis Set
Thefull anal ysis set which is comprised of all randomized subjects who took at least 
onedose of the stud y drug will be used for all efficacy anal yses and baseline anal yses 
unless otherwise specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  The data from the full 
analysis set will be presented by  the treatment group assigned at the time of 
randomization. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
120
Safety Analysis Set
The safet y analysis set includes all randomized subjects who took at least one dose of the 
study  drug.  Subjects will be analyz ed accordi ng to the treatment they  actually  received, 
defined as the randomized treatment if the patient took at least one dose of that treatment 
during the 12 -month placebo -controlled double -blind Treatment Period, or the first 
treatment received if the randomized treatment was never received during the 12 -month 
placebo- controlled double -blind Treatment Period.  All safet y anal yses will be performed 
based on the safet y anal ysis set unless otherwise specified in the SAP.
The All Elagolix plus E2/NETA Anal ysis Set is defined as subjects who received at least 
1 dose of elagolix plus E2/NETA in the study  (either in the placebo -controlled or open-
label Treatment Periods).  Subjects will be summarized based on the actual treatment 
received at the time of randomization (ela golix plus E2/NETA or placebo).
8.1.3 End of 12 -Month Placebo- Controlled Treatment Period 
Analysis
An end -of-placebo -controlled treatment period analy sis will be performed after the last 
subject completes the 12 -Month placebo- controlled Treatment Period.  These analyses 
will include data collected during the Treatment Period (placebo -controlled and open-
label Treatment Periods) and the Follow -Up Period up to the data cut -off for the interim 
lock.  The database will be versioned for an interim lock and an y discrep ant data will be 
clarified before the versioning.  Anal yses will be performed b y AbbVie.
Since this end- of-placebo -controlled treatment period anal ysis is the onl y and final 
analysis for the comparison between treatment and placebo group at 12 months of sa fety 
and efficacy  endpoints, no additional adjustment of alpha -level is necessary.
8.1.4 Treatment Month 24, Month 36 ,Month 48 and Other 
Timepoints Analyses
At the end of Treatment Month 24, Month 36, Month 48 or other timepoints during the 
open -label period, a nalysis of the safet y and efficacy safet y variables may  be performed  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
121
after the last subject completes the Treatment Month 24, Month 36, Month 48 visit or 
other timepoint during the open- label period, respectivel y.  For subjects who prematurel y 
discontinued during the treatment period, their data collected during the Follow -up Period 
will be included in the analy sis, as appropriate.  The database will be versioned for an 
interim lock and an y discrepant data will be clarified before the versioning.  Analyses will 
be performed by AbbVie.
8.1.5 Demographic, Baseline Characteristics and Concomitant 
Medications
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by  treatment group.
Medical history  and gy necological medical/surgical history  data will be coded using 
system organ classes (SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) from the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) b y treatment group.  The duration of the study drug 
exposure will be summarized by  treatment group.
Protocol deviations and reasons for discontinuation will be summarized.
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization (WHO) 
dictionary  and summarized with frequencies and percentages.
Unless noted otherwise, the baseline values will be defined as the last non -missing 
assessment obtained prior to the initiation of the study  drug unless otherwise specified.
8.1.6 Efficacy
8.1.6.1 Primary  Efficacy  Variable
8.1.6.1.1 Primary  Analysis

M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
122
8.1.6.2 Other Efficacy  Variables
Other assessments during the placebo- controlled double -bind 12- month Treatment Period 
include the following:
●PGIC for Menstrual Bleeding Sy mptom;
●Change from baseline for the UFS -QoL.
UFS -QoL
Improvement in quality  of life will be assessed on the UFS -QoL Questionnaire (4 -week 
recall).  The change from baseline to each sch eduled assessment will be calculated and 
summarized for each of the UFS -QoL subscales (sy mptom severit y, concern, activities, 
energy /mood, control, self -conscious and sexual function) and the Health Related Qualit y 
of Life Questionnaire (HRQoL ) total.  The change from Baseline to Month 6 and 
Month 12 during the double -blind Treatment Period will be anal yzed using ANCOVA 
with treatment as the main effect and corresponding Baseline UFS -QoL as a covariate to 
compare the elagolix dose group to placebo.
PGIC for Menstrual Bleeding (PGIC-MB):
PGIC-MB is to assess the change in subjects' severity  of menstrual bleeding.  The number 
and percentage of subjects in each response category based on PGIC -MB will be 
summarized at Month 3, Month 6, Month 9 and Month 12 by  treatment group.  The 
number and percentage of subjects with response of (a) "Very Much I mproved" or "Much 
Improved," and (b) "Otherwise" will be summarized by treatment group in the 12- month 
Treatment Period.  Comparisons will be made using a Miettinen –Nurm inen (M-N) test .
8.1.7 Safety
8.1.7.1 General Considerations
All randomized subjects who took at least one dose of the stud y drug will be included in 
the safet y anal yses. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
123
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum) will be summarized by  treatment group.  The treatment group 
differences in change and percent change from baseline will be anal yzed using a one -way 
ANOVA with treatment as the main effect in the 1 2-month Treatment Period unless 
otherwise specified in the SAP.
Categorical data will be summarized with frequencies and percentages b y treatment 
group.  Chi -square test or Fisher's exact test (or its generalization to r × c tables) will be 
used to anal yze treatment group differences for qualitative categoric al variables in the 
12-month Treatment Period unless otherwise specified in the SAP.
Missing safet y data will not be imputed.
Analy sis details will be specified in the SAP.
8.1.7.2 Adverse Events
Unless otherwise specified, all summaries/anal yses involving AEs will only
 include 
treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs).  TEAEs are defined as an y AE with an onset 
or increased severity  after the first dose of study d rug and no more than 30 days after the 
last dose date of study drug.  AEs where the onset date is t he same as the first dose date of 
study  drug are assumed to be treatment -emergent, unless the first dose time of study drug 
and the AE start time are collected and the AE start time is prior to the first dose time of 
study  drug.  If an incomplete onset dat e was collected for an AE, the AE will be assumed 
to be treatment- emergent unless there is evidence that confirms that the AE was not 
treatment -emergent (e.g., the AE end date was prior to the first dose date of study  drug).
AEs starting more than 30 day s following discontinuation of the study  drug will not be 
included in the summaries of TEAEs.
TEAEs will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) 
version 19.0 or higher.  TEAEs will be summarized using MedDRA s ystem organ clas ses 
(SOCs) and preferred terms (PTs) and grouped b y treatment group. 
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
124
For each TEAE summary, the number and percentage of subjects experiencing at least 
one TEAE will be presented.  Subjects reporting more than one TEAE within a SOC will 
be counted onl y onc e for that SOC.  Subjects reporting more than one TEAE for a PT will 
be counted onl y once for that PT.
When summarizing TEAEs by  relationship or severity , if a subject has an event with 
unknown severit y or relationship, then the subject will be counted in the 
severit y/relationship category  of "unknown," even if the subject has a second occurrence 
of the same event with a severit y/relationship present.  The only  exception is if the subject 
has a second occurrence of the same event with the most extreme sever ity (i.e., "severe") 
or a relationship category of "reasonable possibility."  In this case, the subject will be 
counted under these most extreme severit y/relationship categories.
Frequencies and percentages of subjects with TEAEs will be calculated for eac h treatment 
group as follows:
●Any TEAE
●Any TEAE reasonabl y possibly  related to study  drug
●Any TEAE leading to discontinuation of study  drug
●Any treatment -emergent serious AE (SAE)
●Any SAE reasonably  related to study  drug
●Any AESI  (e.g., hy poestrogenic adve rse events)
8.1.7.3 Analysis of Laboratory  Data and Vital Signs
Changes from baseline in laboratory  and vital sign parameters will be summarized by  
treatment group during the Treatment Periods.
Laboratory  values will be categorized as low, normal or high based on normal ranges of 
the central laboratory  used in this study .  Low or high laboratory  values will be flagged in 
the data listings.

in BMD will be summarized for each treatment group with mean, standard deviation and 
two-sided 95% confidence interval.  The between -group differences in percent change 
from baseline to Month 6 and Month 12 in BMD will be sum marized with mean and 
standard error.  The percent change from baseline to Month 6 and Month 12 in BMD will 
be compared between the elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA group and the placebo 
group using a model based approach.  Two- sided 95% confidence intervals will be 
constructed for the between group differences in percent change from baseline to Month 6 
and Month 12 in BMD.
The number and percentage of subjects with categorized percent change from baseline in 
BMD decrease will be summarized by  treatment gro up during the Treatment Periods.
Analy sis details will be specified in the SAP.

estradiol will be listed for each subject b y visit day and dose regimen, as applicable.  
Pharmacokinetic data may be combined with data from other studies in women.  
Exposure -response analyses may be conducted as appropriate.  For example, if 
pharmacokinetic exposures are estimated, anal yses may  be conducted to assess the 
relationship of pharmacokinetic parameters and estradiol concentrations, versus efficacy  
and safet y.  Additional an alyses will be performed if useful and appropriate.
8.2 Determination of Sample Size
Approximately  500 subjects will be randomized (2:1) to elagolix 300 mg BID plus 
E2/NETA (N = 335) and placebo (N = 165).
Based on clinical review, a sample size of 500 was sel ected to gather long term safet y 
exposure data in approximately  50 subjects completing 48 months of stud y drug dosing, 
with approximately  30 subject sreceiving 48 months of active drug elagolix 300 mg BID 
plus E2/NETA 1/0.5 mg QD.

amendments, the Investigator's Brochure, the informed consent and all other forms of 
subject information related to the stud y (e.g., advertisements used to recruit subjects) and 
any other necessary  documents be reviewed by an IEC/IRB.  The IEC/IRB will review the 
ethical, scientific and medical appropriateness of the study before it is conducted.   
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
127
IEC/IRB approval of the protoc ol, informed consent and subject information and/or 
advertising, as relevant, will be obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to a 
study  site.  During the COVID -19 pandemic, virtual/remote monitoring of data may  be 
employ ed if allowed b y the local regulatory  authority , IRB/IEC, and the study  site.
Any amendments to the protocol will require IEC/I RB approval prior to implementation 
of an y changes made to the study design.  The investigator will be required to submit, 
maintain and archive study  essential documents according to ICH GCP and all other 
applicable regulatory  requirements.
Any serious adverse events that meet the reporting criteria, as dictated b y local 
regulations, will be reported to both responsible Ethics Committees and Regulatory 
Agencies, as required b y local regulations.  During the conduct of the stud y, the 
investigator should promptly  provide written reports (e.g., ICH Expedited Reports, and 
any additional reports required by local regulations) to the IEC/I RB of any  changes that
affect the conduct of the study  and/or increase the risk to subjects.  Written documentation 
of the submission to the IEC/I RB should also be provided to AbbVie.
9.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study
The study  will be conducted in accordance with the protocol, Inte rnational Conference on 
Harmonization (I CH) guidelines, applicable regulations and guidelines governing clinical 
study  conduct and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of 
Helsinki.  Responsibilities of the clinical investigator are specified in Appendix A.
COVID -19 Pandemic -Related Acceptable Protocol Modifications
In the event of a state of emergency  due to the COVID -19 pandemic leading to difficulties

personnel in efforts to ensure the safet y of subjects, maintain protocol compliance, and 
minimize risks to the integrit y of the stud y while tryi ng to best manage subject continuity  
of care.  This may  include alternative methods for assessments (e.g., phone contacts or 
virtual site visits), and shipping investigational product and/or supplies direct to subjects  
Elagolix (ABT -620)
M16 -283 Protocol Amendment 6
128
to ensure continuity  of treatment whe re allowed.  Refer to the Study  Procedures sections 
for additional details.  In all cases, these alternative measures must be allowed b y local 
regulations and permitted by  IRB/IEC.  Investigators should notify AbbVie if any urgent 
safet y measures are taken to protect the subjects against an y immediate hazard.
9.3 Subject Information and Consent
The Investigator or his/her representative will explain the nature of the study to the 
subject, and answer all questions regarding this study.  Prior to an y stud y-relate d 
screening procedures being performed on the subject, the informed consent statement will 
be reviewed and signed and dated b y the subject, the person who administered the 
informed consent, and any other signatories according to local requirements.  A cop yof 
the informed consent form will be given to the subject and the original will be placed in 
the subject's medical record.  An entry  must also be made in the subject's dated source 
documents to confirm that informed consent was obtained prior to an y study -related 
procedures and that the subject received a signed copy.
Information regarding incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for 
treating and/or compensating subjects who are harmed as a consequence of participation 
in the study  can be found in the informed consent form.
In the event a subject withdraws consent to participate from the stud y, stored biomarker 
and exploratory  research samples will continue to be used for research and anal ysis.  In 
the event that a subject would like to withdraw consent for research using these samples, 
the subject may  request that their samples be withdrawn.  Once AbbVie receives the 
request, remaining samples will be destro yed.  If the subject changes her consent, and the 
samples have alread y been teste d, those results will still remain as part of the overall 
research data.
An informed consent, approved b y an IRB/IEC, must be voluntarily signed and dated 
before samples are collected and anal yzed for optional exploratory  research.  The nature 
of the testi ng should be explained and the subject given an opportunity to ask questions.   
Elagolix (ABT -620)

‡ If the subject does not demonstrate blood loss > 80 mL during either Screening Cycle 1 or 2, she may qualify for a third cycl e assessment of blood loss ( Table 5).  If required, 
the subject will collect sanitary products for a third menstrual cycle and will visit the site for a Screening Cycle 3 Produc t Collection Visit.
& If performed during Washout, do not repeat dur ing Screening Period.  
* Brief symptom -directed examination.
$ Complete physical examination; including weight (the subject should not wear shoes during weighing).
∞ Only in subjects ≥ 39 years of age at the time of randomization, unless the mammogram was performed within 3 months prior to Screening.  Results must be entered in EDC 
upon receipt.  
@ Subjects with a finding of polyp on pelvic ultrasound during the Treatment Period will undergo evaluation per standard of car e which may include an SIS.
^ Siteshould dispense enough sanitary product collection kits during screening only.  In addition, sites should also dispense contr aceptives to carry subject over to the next on -
site visit.
# Screening Cycle 2 Product Collection Visit will be registered in IRT only for the first subject who completes the Screening Cycle 2 Product Collection Visit to activate drug 
shipment to the study site.
a. Refer to Table 1for Visit and Assessment Windows, for allowable visit and assessment -specific windows during the Year 1 Treatment Period.
b. Visit to occur approximately 5 days after cessation of bleeding or spotting.
c. Day 1 (Randomization) Visit to occur between Days 1 –10 of the first day of menses (first day of menses is the first day with full menstrual flow).
d. Site staff to evaluate subjects compliance with taking study drug per protocol, assess ongoing adverse events, concomitant me dications (if applicable ), obtain the results of the 
subject's self -administered urine pregnancy test, and remind subjects of the importance of consistent use of appropriate and effective use o f dual non -hormonal contraception.
e. To either be updated or performed or collected pr ior to study drug administration.  Measurements should be assessed consistently throughout the study.
f. A Mammogram will be performed for all subjects who are 39 years of age or older at time of the scheduled study visit. 
g. Mammogram, DXA, Pelvic Ultras ound, Pap test, or Endometrial Biopsy not required if subject prematurely discontinues prior to Treatment Month 6, i.e., rece ived 
< 6months of study drug.  Refer to Section 5.3.1.1 , Study Procedures, Bone Mineral Density (DXA scan) for additional details on performing DXA scan at Premature 
Discontinuation Visit.
h. An endometrial biopsy is not required during the Treatment Period if the TVU findings indicate an end ometrial thickness < 4 mm.  If the TVU findings indicate an 
endometrial thickness ≥4 mm then the subject must have an endometrial biopsy performed.
i. Subject must have a confirmed negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to performing the SIS and Endometrial Biopsy. 
j. Ultrasound may be performed prior to Washout (after informed consent is signed) to establish the presence of a qualifying fib roid(s) or uterine volume to avoid subjects from 
undergoing a lengthy washout of hormonal medications u nnecessarily.

k. If subject has had a pelvic ultrasound (TAU/TVU) during washout or screening that is > 120 days from the date the procedure w as performed, the pelvic ultrasound will need 
to be repeated on Day 1.
l. Subjects who have SIS images which were unable to fully assess the endometrial cavity after 2 separate SIS attempts have been made may undergo an MRI for further 
evaluation in Screening (per imaging vendor request only).
m. Optional urine test for gonorrhea or chlamydia should be performed prior to undergoing the endometrial biopsy.  Positive test results will be treated outside of the protocol.
n. Biomarker sample (E2), Pharmacokinetic (PK) (elagolix and NETA) and Pharmacogenetic (DNA and RNA) samples can be drawn at any time during the visit.
o. Study drug must not be dispensed if the subject has a positive urine pregnancy test result at any visit during the Treatment Period.  A positive urine pregnancy test result must 
be confirmed with a quantitative serum pregnancy test.  For any subject who has a positive serum pregnancy test result, a TVU must be conducted as early as possible in the 
firsttrimester in order to assess the gestational age and estimated due date.  The site will immediately inform the subject to dis continue study drug and the s ubject will be 
discontinued from the study at the point the pregnancy is confirmed.

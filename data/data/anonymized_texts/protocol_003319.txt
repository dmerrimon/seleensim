A PHASE 2 MULTICENTER, RANDOMIZED, CONTROLLED,  
DOUBLE -MASKED CLINICAL TRIAL DESIGNED TO EVALUATE THE 
SAFETY AND EXPLORATORY EFFICACYOF LUMINATE® (ALG-1001) AS 
COMPARED TO AVASTIN®  
IN THE TREATMENT OF DIABETIC MACULAR EDEMA 
 
1. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
Integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane proteins and are important for cell- cell and 
cell-matrix interactions, which act as transmembrane linkers between their extracellular 
ligands and the cytoskeleton. Through the transmembrane links, integrins provide modulation of various outside-in and inside- out signaling pathways essential in the 
biological functions of cells such as: cell migration, differentiation, survival during embryogenesis, angiogenesis, wound healing, immune and non- immune defense 
mechanism, hemostasis and oncogenic transformation (Hynes RO., 2002).  
The molecular events involved in the development of NV and CNV have not been fully 
elucidated; however, while VEGF has been shown to play a major role in the 
development of NV and CNV (Umeda et. al., 2006; Friedlander et. al., 1996), integrins 
α
5β1, αvβ3, and α vβ5 are also implicated in the angiogenic process, and are known to be 
expressed in neovascular ocular tissue from patients with Wet AMD and proliferative D R 
(Umeda et. al., 2006; Friedlander et. al., 1996).  As shown in Figure 1 , targeting integrin 
works against proliferation and invasion, as well as maturation and differentiation (Brooks et. al., 1996).

IGURE 1 
THE ANGIOGENIC CASCADE: TARGETING VEGF VS. INTEGRIN 

ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.   PAGE 11 
PROTOCOL DME -202B Allegro has developed an anti -integrin oligopeptide Luminate® as a first in class 
therapeutic for vascular eye diseases, including wet age- related macular degeneration 
(Wet AMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and focal symptomatic vitreomacular 
traction (VMA) . Specifical ly, Allegro has discovered a peptide sequence , in either linear 
or cyclic form, that effectively binds to α 5β1, αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins. These integrin 
receptors have been found to be intimately involved in the angiogenesis associated with Wet AMD, DME and proliferative DR.  DME is the leading cause of blindness in the working age population (www.diabetes.org). In the United States, 10.2 million people over age 40 have been diagnosed with diabetes (www.diabetes.org), of which 4.1 million have some form of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Further, the prevalence of DME in the U.S. approaches 30% in adults who have had diabetes for 20 years or more (Klein et. al., 1984).  DME is the result of thickening of the center part of the retina due to damage of retinal capillaries from diabetes. Application of laser to damaged capillaries within thickened retina has been the mainstay of treatment for over 25 years (EDTRS Study Group, 1985; AAO 2009) . Recent results from the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network 
demonstrated that in eyes with reduced visual acuity from DME involving the center of the macula, anti -VEGF therapy with Lucentis in combination with focal/grid laser  
provides superior vision outcomes and an acceptable safety profile compared with the previous standard treatment of laser (ETDRS Research Group, 1985).  Luminate
® solution for intravitreal injection approaches DME by collectively suppressing 
the production of aberrant blood vessels; reducing the leakage of aberrant blood vessels; and inhibiting the growth of aberrant blood vessels. The most common treatment for DME is currently ranibizumab (Lucentis
®), aflibercept (Eylea®) and bevacizumab 
(Avastin®). All three of these options are anti- VEGF treatments, and are very large 
antibodies from 20KD to 150KD in size that bind to VEGF receptors . These antibodies 
must be administered at four to six week intervals for Avastin® and Lucentis® and every 
eight weeks for E ylea® at substantial inconvenience, cost, and cumulative risk of 
infection.   The use of Luminate
® solution for intravitreal injection has the potential to be both an 
effective stand -alone product as well as complementary to existing anti -VEGF treatments 
based on its unique mechanism of action and potentially longer duration of treatment 
effect as suggested in Phase 1 DME and wet AMD studies.  
 The purpose of this study is to explore the safety and efficacy of 3 doses of Luminate
® in 
a DME population, as compared to treatment with Avastin . 
 
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.   PAGE 12 
PROTOCOL DME -202B 2. STUDY OBJECTIVE  
The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 4 doses of Luminate in 
a population of patients with active DME, and to compare the outcomes of Luminate 
treatment with Avastin treatment.  
3. STUDY DESIGN 
This is a 2-stage, prospective, randomized, double- masked multicenter , Phase II clinical 
trial:   
Stage 1: One -hundred twenty (120) eligible subjects with active DME will be 
randomized to one of four treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. This includes 3 Luminate 
treatment groups (1.0 mg, 2.0 mg or 3.0 mg), and an Avastin® group. An active focal 
laser group was also present in previous versions of this protocol which has since been removed. At the time that this laser group was actively included in randomization, the randomization design had been a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio.     In addition to the study treatment (Luminate or Avastin with the treatments and  schedules 
defined below), during the course of follow-up, prn retreatment will be allowed for any subject with central subfield thickness ≥ 350
 µm on SD-OCT exam based on review of 
the OCT images by the central  reading center.   Retreatment will be performed using the 
originally assigned treatment, i.e., Luminate with Luminate  and Avastin with Avastin . 
 
Stage 2 (select sites) : Seventy five (75) eligible subjects with active DME will be 
randomized to one of five treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio . These treatment groups 
consist of 2 Luminate treatment groups (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg), 2 Luminate and Avastin adjunctive treatment groups, and an Avastin® (1.25 mg) group. The Luminate monotherapy arms will also include an Avastin intravitreal injection at Week 0 
(Baseline).    
 In addition to the study treatment, during the course of follow-up for Stage 2 , prn Avastin 
retreatment will be allowed, at Week 12 and Week 16, in the Avastin monotherapy arm for any subject with central subfield thickness ≥ 350 µm on SD- OCT exam based on 
review of the OCT images by the central reading center.  
 Rescue treatment can be administered to any study subject who experiences a significant 
decrease in BCVA, as defined below:  
 
• BCVA loss of > 15 letters from baseline regardless of OCT finding. 
OR 
• BCVA loss  of > 10 letters from the prior study visit accompanied by an increase 
in OCT central retinal thickness of > 100 µm  as compared to the previous study 
visit based on the investigator’s judgment.  
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.   PAGE 13 
PROTOCOL DME -202B If one of the above criteri a is met, r escue treatment may be administered at the discretion 
of the unmasked investigator but should not involve unmasking the subject or any 
additional staff.    If a subject meets one of the above criteri a and has not received  the assigned study 
treatment in several weeks , Allegro recommends that the first option  to be considered by 
the unmasked investigator for rescue is the originally assigned study treatment.  Avastin 
rescue is another option. 
 Any subject who receives rescue treatment will continue to be followed  for 4 weeks after 
the rescue therapy for safety evaluations and then will early exit the study after completing exist visit procedures per the protoc ol.    
 
STAGE 1 : 
 The treatment groups are as follows for stage 1 : 
 
Group 1 Luminate  1.0 mg intravitreal injection administered at baseline (Day 0), 
weeks 4 and 8 with prn Luminate injection at week 20 for a total of at least 3 and no more than 4 Luminate injections .  Sham injections will be 
performed at weeks 12 and 16 and may also be performed at week 20 if prn Luminate is not required. 
 
Group 2 Luminate  2.0 mg intravitreal injection administered at baseline (Day 0) , 
weeks 4 and 8 with prn Luminate injection at week 20 for a total of at least 
3 and no more than 4 Luminate injections.  Sham injections will be performed at weeks 12 and 16 and may also be performed at week 20 if prn Luminate is not required. 
 
Group 3 Luminate  3.0 mg intravitreal injection administered at baseline (Day 0),  
weeks 4 and 8 with prn Luminate injection at week  20 for a total of at least 
3 and no more than 4 Luminate injections .  Sham injections will be 
performed at weeks 12 and 16 and may also be performed at week 20 if prn Luminate is not required. 
 
Group 4 Avastin 1.25 mg intravitreal injection administered at baseline (Day 0),  
weeks 4 and 8 with prn Avastin injection at weeks 12, 16, or 20 for a total 
of at least 3 and up to 6 Avastin injections. Sham injections may be  
performed at weeks 12 , 16, and 20 if prn Avastin is not required . 
 An active focal laser  arm was also present in previous versions of this protocol which has 
since been removed. Any patients enrolled into the active laser group prior to approval of protocol amendment 2.64 will remain in that group and follow that applicable treatment schedule accordingly.  A table showing the four treatment arms  and visits is provided 
below, with the treatments to be administered at each visit.

  All study subjects will be masked to the treatment assignment. Additionally, at each clinical site, masked examiners will perform ocular examinations as well as IOP, BCVA, OCT, FA and fundus photography assessm ents. 
 Potential study participants will be asked to sign an informed consent document prior to screening.  Screening will be conducted from -20 days to -3 days prior to randomization and treatment during Week 0.  This timing is intended  to allow OCT images to be

PROTOCOL DME -202B All study subjects will be masked to the treatment assignment.  Additionally, at each 
clinical site, masked examiners will perform ocular examinations as well as IOP, BCV A, 
OCT, FA , and fundus photography assessments.   
 
6.3  INVESTIGATIONAL MATERIALS  
The investigational materials will be labeled by Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC , in a manner 
consistent with the study design.  The medications will be identified as an investigational 
compound and will carry the following statement: “CAUTION: NEW DRUG – LIMITED 
BY FEDERAL LAW TO INVESTIGATIONAL USE ONLY” .  The study code and subject 
number will be identified on the label of the medication bottles, along with the batch number, expiration date and storage requirements for the study drug.   The investigator or a qualified designee will be responsible for keeping current and 
accurate records of the amount of drug received, dispensed, and returned to the study site.  During the course of the study, the investigator must maintain an inventory of all study supplies in stock, as well as those dispensed and administered to study subjects.  The  
study drug must be stored in a secure area in order to prevent unauthorized distribution.  The investigational drug is to be administered only to subjects entered into the study, in accordance with the conditions specified in the protocol.   At the end of the study, and following a full accounting and recording of all study medications, unused supplies of the investigational products will either be returned to the 
Sponsor (or its designee) or disposed of under the direction of the Sponsor or designee.  The sponsor may authorize disposal of unused supplies of the investigational drug 
provided this alternative disposition does not expose humans to risks from the drug. 
6.4 I
NSTRUCTIONS FOR USE AND ADMINISTRATION  OF INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT 
6.4.1 Intravitreal Injection Preparation  - Luminate  
The study drug  is supplied in a 0.30 mL conical -shaped glass vial as a sterile liquid 
product ready for injection. Prior to the injection, the unmasked investigator should 
confirm that the vial to be used matches the vials that have been specifically assigned to the particular study subject. Luminate
® should be stored at refrigerated  temperature.  
 6.4.2 Intravitreal Injection Preparation  – Avastin 
Avastin
® for intravitreal injection is supplied in a 1.0mL tuberculin syringe as a sterile 
liquid product ready for injection. Prior to the injection, the unmasked investigator should confirm the syringe volume and that the syringe to be used matches the randomization number specifically assigned to the particular study subject.   6.4.3 Intravitreal Injection Procedure  
With the exception of the IOP lowering drops pre- injection and cotton swab 
tamponade post-injection, which are required , the rest of the below injection and post-
injection procedures are guidance and sites may use the standard of care procedure at 
their institution .  
 
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.   PAGE 22 
PROTOCOL DME -202B The subject is placed in a SITTING position and the procedure explained again to the 
subject in lay terms prior to beginning.  
 
• Apply one drop of brimonidine or similar IOP lowering agent ophthalmic drops to the eye to be injected.   
• Apply two (2) drops of proparacaine on the surface to be injected, followed by two (2) drops of antibiotic.   
• To disinfect the periocular skin, eyelids, and lashes use 5% povidone iodine swabs in a systemic fashion.   
• The investigator wears gloves and a sterile drape is placed on the eye, then the lid 
speculum is placed over the drape. 
• The injection location is at the investigator ’s discretion, however the inferior 
temporal or superior temporal location is preferred.  
• Expel two (2) drops of 5% povidone iodine on the ocular surface.  Wait 90 
seconds.  Saturate a sterile cotton tip with proparacaine drops and place over the injection site.  Expel excess  drug to 0.1 mL.   
• Insert the needle (30 or 31 gauge needle) 3.5 to  4.0 mm posterior to the limbus 
avoiding the horizontal axis. Inject slowly INTO THE CENTRAL VITREOUS (neither anterior nor posterior) and remove the needle from the eye slowly to avoid loss of drug.  Use the cotton swab as a tamponade to avoid loss of drug at injection site.  
• After injection, the investigator will observe the subject for several minutes to 
ensure that untoward complications have not occurred.   
• Check vision with finger counting and if vision is worse for more than 1 minute, an anterior chamber paracent esis with a 30 or 31- gauge needle should be 
performed .  
• The IOP can be taken at regular intervals, at the i nvestigator’s discretion, until the 
IOP has stabilized and the i nvestigator has determined that the subject is safe to 
leave the clinic.  
     
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.   PAGE 23 
PROTOCOL DME -202B 6.5 RETREATMENT CRITERIA 
During the course of follow- up, retreatment will be allowed for any subject with central 
subfield thickness ≥ 350  µm on OCT based on review of the OCT images by the central 
reading center.  Study subjects will be retreated at the study visits outlined in Section 3 
Study Design with their respective assigned group (i.e., Luminate with Luminate or 
Avastin with Avastin).  
6.6 RESCUE CRITERIA 
At study Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 ( for Stage 1  ONLY) rescue treatment is available for 
all groups should there be a significant decrease in BCVA.    Rescue is to be implemented at the discretion of the principal investigator when: 
• BCVA loss of > 15 letters from baseline regardless of OCT finding. 
OR 
• BCVA loss of > 10 letters from the prior study visit accompanied by an increase 
in OCT central retinal  thickness of > 100 µm  as compared to the previous study 
visit based on the investigator’s judgment  
 If one of the above criteri a is met, rescue treatment may be given at the discretion of the 
unmasked Investigator but should not involve unmasking the subject or any additional staff.   
 If a subject meets  one of the above rescue criteri a and has not received the assigned study 
treatment in several weeks, Allegro recommends that the first option to be considered by 
the unmasked investigator for rescue is the originally  assigned study treatment ,   
 Avastin rescue is an other option, however since Avastin is a final option, any other 
necessary intervention to stabilize the subject should be considered.  Any subject who receives rescue treatment will continue to be followed for 4 weeks after the rescue therapy for safety evaluations and then will early exit the study after completing exist visit procedures per the protoc ol.   
    
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.   PAGE 24 
PROTOCOL DME -202B 6.7 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Subjects will receive pre-injection and post-injection antibiotic eye drops at the discretion 
of the principal investigator at each site .  It is recommended that study subjects receive 
antibiotic eye drops three days pre -injection and up to one week post-injection.  
 
Clinical sites using antibiotic eye drops will call study subjects three days prior to 
possible retreatment by intravitreal  injection on week 4 and week 8 and instruct them to 
restart their antibiotic drops in anticipation of a n injection.   
 Any systemic medications  that are considered necessary for the subject ’s welfare may be 
used.  Additionally, topical anti- inflammatories, antibiotics,  steroids, intraocular pressure 
agents, and/or cycloplegics to treat or assess the ocular condition may be used at the discretion of the investigator. All medications administered shall be reported in the 
appropriate section of the source document and electronic case report form ( eCRF). Any 
intravitreal injections in the study eye must be cleared by the Sponsor prior to administration.   
 Any intravitreal injections of anti -VEGF agents or intravitreal steroids IN THE 
NON-STUDY EYE must be administered at least 1 week  and preferably 2 week s 
after the STUDY EYE treatment or prior to the next scheduled study visit for the STUDY EYE .

CRT result from Visit 6 is determined by the OCT reading center, who will notify 
the sites whether or not the result is ≥ 350 µm . This will allow the site to determine 
which treatment, per the treatment table on page 14 of the protocol, is to be 
administered at Visit 6.1.  All study subjects will receive some form of treatment at 
this visit (either active or sham treatment).

2. The study is considered to be completed when all randomized subjects have either completed or been terminated from the trial.  
8.2 S
UBJECT DISCONTINUATION  
Subjects who experience an unacceptable lack of effecti veness and who have not 
responded to retreatment  (as defined above), or intolerable side effects or adverse 
reactions should be discontinued at the investigators discretion from the study and should receive appropriate treatment at the discretion of the investigator. S ubjects 
who discontinue from the study within the first month (4 weeks) of participation can be replaced.  
 Other reasons for discontinuing a subject from a study include non- compliance with 
the required visits or with the treatment regimen. S ubjects have the right to withdraw 
from participation in the study at any time, for any reason without prejudice to further treatment.  The investigator may elect to discontinue any subject for reasons unrelated to the study product.  The following may be justifiable reasons for the Investigator to withdraw a subject from the study: 
• A subject is uncooperative, or misses two or more consecutive follow-up 
visits. 
• A subject was erroneously included in the study. 
• A subject develops an exclusion criterion or concurrent disease.  
• The Sponsor terminates the study. 
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 36 
PROTOCOL DME -202B Details of a subject’s exit from th e study should be recorded in the subject’s clinical 
records. 
The study subject may be discontinued by an investigator or by the sponsor.  Should 
an investigator decide to discontinue the study subject, based on clinical observations, this should be reported to the sponsor with reasons for the discontinuation.  Appropriate notification will be provided to the sponsor within approximately five working days.   
8.3
  TERMINATION OF STUDY OR PARTICIPATION BY A CLINICAL SITE OR 
SPONSOR 
The Sponsor or Clinical Site reserves the right to discontinue the study at a single site  
for safety or administrative reasons at any time.  If the Sponsor or Investigator 
discovers conditions during the study indicating that the study or participation by a clinical site should be terminated, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between the Sponsor and Investigator.   
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 37 
PROTOCOL DME -202B Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited to: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects 
enrolled in the study. 
• The decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing, 
evaluation, or development of the study at any time.  
 
Conditions that warrant discontinuation of the study at a specific study site include: 
• Failure of the Investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable 
rate. 
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with the Protocol or pertinent 
regulations. 
• Submission by the Investigator of false information from the research facility 
to the Sponsor. 
 Any subject who completes all study visits will be considered to have completed the study.

ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 38 
PROTOCOL DME -202B 9 ADVERSE  EVENT REPORTING  
An adverse event is any untoward and unintended sign, symptom or disease temporally 
associated with the use of an investigational drug  or other protocol- imposed intervention 
whether or not considered drug- related.   
 All treatment-emergent adverse events/adverse reactions occurring during the study should be recorded , regardless of the assumption of causal relationship.  If a subject has an 
ongoing adverse events/adverse reactions  at the time of study completion, the ongoing 
adverse events/adverse reactions  must be followed-up and provided appropriate medical 
care until the signs and symptoms have remitted or stabilized.  
 Conditions or diseases that are chronic but stable should not be recorded on AE pages of the CRF.  Changes in a chronic condition of disease that are consistent with natural disease progression are NOT adverse events and also should not be recorded on the AE pages of the CRF.   
9.1
  ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS  
The following definitions of terms apply to this section: 
 Adverse event  means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.   Life-threatening  adverse event or life-t hreatening suspected adverse reaction . An adverse 
event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life- threatening” if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor , its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death. It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.   Serious adverse event or suspected adverse reaction . An adverse event or suspected 
adverse reaction is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the Inv estigator or 
Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:   
• Results in death. 
• Is life-threatening.  
• Results in a persistent or significant in capacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions. 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization.  
• Prolongs inpatient hospitalization. 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Is a significant medical event (i.e., one that may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one or more of the other outcomes listed above). 
 
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 39 
PROTOCOL DME -202B Sight-threatening adverse events include the following:  
• It caused a decrease in visual acuity of 30 ETDRS letters (compared with the 
last assessment of visual acuity prior to the most recent treatment) lasting >1 
hour. 
• It caused a decrease in visual acuity to the level of Light Perception or worse 
lasting >1 hour. 
• It required surgical intervention (e.g., conventional surgery, vitreous tap or 
biopsy with i ntravitreal injection of anti- infectives, or laser or retinal cryopexy 
with gas) to prevent permanent loss of sight. 
• It is associated with severe intraocular inflammation (i.e., 4+ anterior chamber cell/flare or 4+ vitritis).  
• In the opinion of the investigator, it may require medical intervention to prevent permanent loss of sight. 
Sight-threatening events (as defined above) should be reported as SAEs. 
 
A non-serious adverse event is any AE that does not meet the definitions for SAEs as 
described above.  
 
Suspected adverse reaction  means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘‘reasonable possibility’’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relations hip between 
the drug and the adverse event. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.   Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction. An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it is not listed in the Inv estigator 
brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.   
9.2 C
LASSIFICATION OF ADVERSE EVENTS BY RELATIONSHIP , SEVERITY AND ACTION 
TAKEN 
The study medication relationship for each adverse event/adverse reaction should be determined by the Investigator using these explanations: 
• Not Related:   The event is clearly  related to other factors  such as subject’s clinical 
condition, therapeutic interventions, concomitant disease, therapy administered  or 
accidental trauma of  the subject and does not follow a known response pattern to the 
product. 
  
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 40 
PROTOCOL DME -202B • Possibly Related:   The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of 
study medication administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the study 
medication, but could have been produced by other fac tors such as the subject’s clinical 
state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject.  
• Related:  The event follows a reasonable, temporal sequence from the time of study 
medication administration or placement and/or follows a known response pattern to the study medication and cannot be reasonably explained by oth er factors such as subject’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions or concomitant therapy administered to the subject, and either occur s immediately following study medication administration, or 
improves on stopping the study medication, or reappears on repeat exposure, or there is a positive reaction at the application site.  
 Intensity (severity)  of an adverse event is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level 
of discomfort of an adverse event as is determined by the Investigator or reported to him/her by the subject.  The assessment of intensity is made irrespective of study medication relationship or seriousness of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
1 = Mild:  present, but not distressing, and no disruption of normal daily activity  
2 = Moderate:  discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity 
3 = Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
 
A change in severity for a reported AE will require a stop date for the previous severity and a new start and stop date for the new severity.  For example, a change in severity may go from mild to severe or from severe to moderate.  In either case, the start and stop dates should be recorded.   Action taken in response to an adverse event is coded as:  
1=None 2=Test Article interrupted  
3=Test Article discontinued  
4=Non-drug therapy  
5=New OTC or Rx drug added 6=Hospitalized (< 24 hours) 7=Hospitalized (>= 24 hours) 
 Outcome of an adverse event is coded as : 
1=Recovered without sequelae  
2=Stable and ongoing 3=Ongoing 4=Death 
5=Unknown/ Lost to follow-up 
   
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 41 
PROTOCOL DME -202B Please note: the term “severe” is used to describe the intensity (severity, see above) of an 
event/reaction; the event/reaction itself may be of relatively minor medical signif icance 
(such as severe headache).  This is not the same as a “Serious” Adverse Event, which is based on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to the subject’s life or vital functions.  “Serious” (NOT sev erity) serves as a guide for 
defining regulatory reporting obligations. 
9.3
  ADVERSE EVENTS REQUIRING EXPEDITED REPORTING   
Serious adverse events (SAEs) and suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions 
(SUSARs) require expedited reporting to the Sponsor or designee regardless of relationship 
to study Insert or study procedure.   All SAEs and SUSARs must be reported to the study Sponsor or designee by telephone and  
e-mail or fax within 48 hours of knowledge of the event  and to the IRB within the required 
reporting window of each IRB.  Information on whether or not the event is considered drug 
related, or whether there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event  should be 
included with this report.  All reported AEs should be followed until resolution or until the adverse event has stabilized with no further change anticipated. Subjects who have an ongoing SAE or SUSAR at study completion or at discontinuation from the study will be followed by the Investigator or his or her designee until the event is resolved or determined to be 
irreversible, chronic, or stable by the Investigator. 
9.4  F
OLLOW-UP OF SUBJECTS AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS 
If an adverse events/adverse reactions occu r, the Investigator will institute support and/or 
treatment as deemed appropriate.  If a non -SAE/adverse reaction  is unresolved at the time 
of the last visit, an effort will be made to follow up until the adverse event/adverse reaction 
is resolved or stabilized, the subject is los t to follow -up, or there is other resolution to the 
event.    
10 STATISTICS  
10.1
  SAMPLE SIZE CONSIDERATIONS  
Since this is a Phase 2 exploratory clinical study, no formal hypothesis testing will be 
performed .  The sample size was determined based on establish ing a reasonable number of 
subjects to provide adequate safety and efficacy information to proceed to the next phase of 
clinical development.     
  
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 42 
PROTOCOL DME -202B 10.2  GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Descriptive statistics will be used to tabulate and summarize study outcomes.   
Background and demographic characteristics will be presented.  Continuous variables will 
be summarized by descriptive statistics (sample size, mean  and standard deviation, median, 
minimum and maximum).  Discrete variables will be summarized by frequencies  and 
percentages.  Adverse events will be summarized by presenting the number and percentage of patients having any adverse event.  Any other information collected (such as severity or relationship to study device) will be listed as appropriate.  Any statistical tests performed to explore the data will be used only to highlight any interesting comparisons that may warrant further consideration. 
10.3
  ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
The modified Intent t o Treat (mITT) data set will include all randomized subjects  who 
receive at least one dose of study drug and have at least one follow -up visit.  Last 
observation carry forward (LOCF) will be used to impute missing data from subjects.  If a 
subject receives rescue therapy, that subject’s worst reported value will be imputed for all 
subsequent visits. Data will be analyzed as randomized.   
 
The Per Protocol (PP) data set will include all subjects who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria at the eligibility visit, who are compliant with all study requirements and who complete the study through Week s 20 and 24 (Stage 2 and Stage 1 respectively) .  
Missing data will not be imputed. Data recorded after rescue therapy will be excluded.  Data will be analyzed as treated.  
 The safety dataset will include all subjects who receive study drug.  Missing data will not 
be imputed.  Data will be analyzed as treated.   
10.4
   INTERIM ANALYSES 
An interim analysis might be performed  to support planning of further clinical 
development.  To maintain the integrity of the ongoing study, individuals who are directly involved in study conduct and data management (eg, personnel at investigational sites, Allegro Medical Safety Physician, Clinical Operations, and Data Management) would 
remain masked to treatment assignment of individual patients until study completion . 
 11 ETHICAL AND REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS

PROTOCOL DME -202B Purpose of Study  
You have been asked to participate in this research study, sponsored by 
Allegro Ophthalmics, LLC, to determine whether  an new class of drugs to 
treat bleeding disorders of the eye would be effective as compared to the 
current standard of care drugs or laser treatments used in treating diabetic 
macular edema (swelling in the back of the eye from your diabetes). In this 
study 1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 mg of Luminate® will be co mpared to the current 
standards- of-care of 1.25mg Avastin.®   
 Luminate
® is an experimental product which has been tested in both animals 
and human patients in the past for safety and initial efficacy. In addition, improvements in vision and resolution of macular swelling have been 
observed in human subjects when the drug has been used alone.   
 You are being chosen for this study because your treating physician feels that your Diabetic Macular Edema (swelling in the back of the eye from your 
diabetes) is not resolved with the current standard of care medication (i.e., 
Avastin
®) or without further medical intervention. As the study drug, 
Luminate®, has a different mechanism of action,  meaning it works in a 
different way than the current standard of care drugs on the market, i t has 
been found in animal and other human studies to provide an additional level 
of benefit in treating bleeding disorders of the eye  above and beyond those 
benefits in vision or retinal anatomy seen with Avastin® (the current standard 
of care). Your participation in this study may directly benefit you by further 
improving the anatomy of the eye and improving your ability to see . 
  Luminate
® is experimental when used in the eye, such as for this use, and has 
not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.  The safety and efficacy of Luminate
® will be evaluated in this study.  
 Approximately 120 subjects are expected to participate.  
 Duration of Participation  
You will be in this study for approximately six months.

PROTOCOL DME -202B Study Procedures  
If you agree to take part in this study, you will first sign this Subject 
Information and Consent Form before any study -related procedures are 
performed.  Before enrolling into this study, your study doctor or his staff will 
take your medical history to make sure you have no other medical problems 
that would interfere with your participation in this study, and are not using any medications which might make your participation unsafe.  You will also receive an eye examination.  This exam includes:  
 Slit Lamp Exam  is an examination of your eye by the Study Doctor using a 
special microscope that allows your physician to see both the outside and the inside of your eye under magnification. The doctor will look at your pupil and eye movements. The lens and back of your  eye will also be examined after 
drops have been placed in your eyes to dilate your pupil. This exam will be performed on both eyes at the Screening Visit, but only on the study eye 
during all remaining visits.  
 
Fundus Exam  is an examination with an ophthalmoscope (an instrument with 
a strong light and a magnifying lens) of the interior lining of the eyeball, 
including the retina, optic disc (the head of the nerve to the eye), and the macula. This exam will be conducted by your Study Doctor. This exam will be performed  on both eyes at the Screening Visit, but only on the study eye 
during all remaining visits. .  
 Intraocular Pressure  is a measure of the pressure of the fluid inside your eye. 
This exam will be performed on both eyes at the Screening Visit, but only on 
the study eye during all remaining visits.  
  Visual Acuity  uses letters projected on a screen to measure how well your eye 
can see at a specific distance. This exam will be performed on both eyes at the 
Screening Visit, but only on the study eye  during all remaining visits.   
  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)  uses light to measure the thickness of 
the retina. You may be familiar with ultrasound used to obtain pictures of pregnancies. OCT uses light instead of sound to obtain pictures of the in side 
of your eye. Like ultrasound, it is painless. You will be asked to look into the 
front of the OCT machine. While the instrument acquires an image, you will 
see lights of various colors. This exam will be performed on both eyes at the 
Screening V isit, but only on the study eye during all remaining visits.  
  
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 49 
PROTOCOL DME -202B Fundus Photography, i.e., photographs of your retina, will be taken. Eye 
drops will dilate your pupils, allowing for the inside of your eye to be 
examined. A special camera will then be used to take photographs. The bright flashes used to take the photographs may be annoying, but are not painful and 
cause no damage to the eye. Photography will be performed on both eyes at 
the Screening  Visit, and on the study eye on follow up visits.  
 Fluorescein Angiography  is a test in which pictures of your retina are taken 
using a yellow  dye. The dye, called fluorescein, will be injected into a vein 
(blood vessel) in your arm or hand. This dye will travel through your blood 
vessels to your eyes. The camera will then flash a special light into your eye 
and will take pictures of your retina; the pictures will show the amount of dye leaking out of the blood vessels into your retina. This test will be performed on both eyes at the Screening  Visit, and on the study eye on follow up visits.  
 Intravitreal Injection s will be given in one of your eyes (the “study eye”) 
within 20  days following your screening visit, and  at intervals during the 
course of the study . The pupil of your eye will be dilated, and your eye will be 
anesthetized (numbed). You will then receive an injection into your eye.  
 If you are a woman of childbearing potential (under age 60), you must have a 
negative pregnancy test to participate in this study.  
 
If you are eligible for the study, you will receive injections into your eye of 
1.0, 2.0, or 3.0 mg of Luminate
®, or 1.25mg of Avastin®.  
 
The study drug will be drawn up into a small syringe and with your eye anesthetized (numbed), the drug will be injected into the white of the eye usually under the upper or lower lid.  There will be only a single  injection at 
Baseline.  
 Following the injections, you will need to return for additional examinations 
at study weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24.   At these visits, you will have an eye 
examination.   
 If you decide to participate in the study, it is important that you return to the 
study site at the scheduled times for observation of your overall well- being.

PROTOCOL DME -202B Risks or Discomforts  
Your eye condition may or may not improve or may worsen while 
participating in this study.  
 
If you experience any side effects during the study, you should tell the study 
staff. 
 While there are no known side effects specifically related to the study drug, the potential side effects from an intravitreal injection may include:  
 
• burning/stinging 
• headache 
• foreign body sensation  
• brow-ache 
• photophobia (intolerance  to light) 
• excessive tearing  
• eye inflammation  
• pain 
• lowering of eye pressure  
• transient macular edema  
 
What are the possible risks or discomforts?  
 
Risk of Eye Examination and Dilation  
As part of the eye exam, drops will be put in your eyes to dilate the pupils. 
The drops may blur your vision and make you sensitive to light. The drops 
will wear off over several hours. There is a small risk of an allergic reaction to the drops. There is also a small risk that the drops could cause the eye pressure to rise. If this happens, it will be treated, but there is a very small risk of losing vision from the pressure rise. Due to the blurring effect on your vision and possible light sensitivity, you will be advised not to drive until the 
drops have worn off and, if necessary, have someone come with you who can 
drive after the exam.  
 Risk of Optical Coherence Tomography  
The vast majority of people feel no discomfort on exposure to the light source used to obtain the images of the retina.  However , as with any bright light 
source some people may experience photophobia (sensitivity to light).  
  
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 51 
PROTOCOL DME -202B  
Risks of Intravitreal Injection wit h Luminate® 
Luminate® has been tested in two previous human clinical trials and has been 
found to be safe and well tolerated. In this study, you will be examined for the 
need to receive Luminate® at monthly to quarterly intervals depending on the 
study arm you are enrolled into.  
 Prior to injection, your eye is numbed with an eye drop and it may be cleaned with betadine. You may experience redness or swelling of the eye or eyelid, or bleeding, tearing or watering of your eye. You may experience corneal 
abrasion (scratch on the clear front surface of the eye) if you rub your eye 
while numb. These events are likely to clear up quickly. You may experience an allergy to the numbing drops or betadine . This is usually treated by 
antihistamines that are given by mouth or by injection if your symptoms are severe. 
 In clinical studies conducted with Luminate
® to date, the most common eye -
related side effects were: 
 
1. Conjunctival hemorrhage (bleeding under the clear covering of the eye)  
• Mild eye pain 
• Vitreous floaters (small specks floating in your field of vision)  
2. Transient i ncreased eye pressure  
• Vitreous detachment  (a common condition that occurs natural ly with the 
aging of the eye in which the clear gel that fills the space between the lens 
and the back of the eye separates away from the back of the eye)  
• Intraocular inflammation (swelling and redness inside the eye)  
• Foreign body sensation in eye  
• Eye irritation (redness)  
 Other Risks  
You should be aware that there might be additional risks that are currently 
unknown and unforeseeable. Your condition may not improve, or may worsen 
while participating in the study.  You may still require the current standard of 
care treatment  Avastin
® or focal laser whether you participate in this study or 
not. 
   
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 52 
PROTOCOL DME -202B Additionally, there is the risk of the injection procedure  that is inherent in any 
type of injection into the eye.  These risks include infection, retinal 
detachment, bleeding in the vitreous cavity, temporary rise in eye pressure, and cataract formation, any of which could affect your vision in that eye.  
 If you do not understand what the symptoms of the side effects are, ask your study doctor to explain them to you.  
 Other possible side effects can occur which may have no symptoms.  There may be risks associated with the use of this study drug that are currently 
unknown.  
 
Reproductive Risks  
You must not participate in this study if you are a woman who is breast-
feeding, pregnant, considering a pregnancy, or not using effective birth control methods during the study period.  
 
Medically acceptable forms of birth control include:  
 
• IUD (intrauterine device)  
• Condom + spermicide  
• Diaphragm + spermicide  
• Birth control pills, implants (like Norplant), or injections (like Depo-
Provera) used with a condom or diaphragm  
 If you think you are pregnant during the study, you must tell the study doctor 
immediately.  If you become pregnant, you will be removed from the study 
and your pregnancy will be followed to its outcome.  
 If you are a female between 18 to 60 years old, you will need a negative urine pregnancy test during the screening window to be eligible for enrollment.  
 Alternative Treatment  
The only currently available  definitive treatment option for your condition is 
focal laser or anti-VEGF treatment such as Avastin
®. If you continue to 
deteriorate despite treatment with to your study designated treatment regime during the study the investigator has the option to perform a “rescue treatment” with one of these alternative treatment options. As you consider your participation in this study, your other alternative is not to participate in this 
study.

PROTOCOL DME -202B APPENDIX B:  EXAMINATION PROCEDURES, TESTS, EQUIPMENT, AND 
TECHNIQUES  
 1.    VISUAL ACUITY  Visual acuity will be measured using a standard ETDRS c hart at 4 meters.   
 Visual Acuity Charts  
 ETDRS BCVA   
 BCVA at screening should be determined with a new refraction done with a phoropter or using trial frames  utilizing the ETDRS chart starting at 4 meters . 
Measurement Technique  
The chart should be at a comfortable viewing angle.  The subject should attempt to read each letter, line -by-line, left to right, beginning with line 1 at the top of the chart.  The 
subject should be told that the chart has letters only, no numbers.  If the subject reads a number, he or she should be reminded that the chart contains no numbers, and the examiner should then request a letter in lieu of the number.  The subject should be asked to read slowly, about 1 letter per second, so as to achieve the best identification of each letter.  The subject is not to proceed to the next letter until a definite response is given. 
If the subject changes a response (e.g., that was a “C” not an “O”) before the next letter has 
been read aloud, then the change must be accepted.  If the subject changes a response having read the next letter, then the change is not accepted.  The examiner should never point to the chart or to specific letters on the chart during the test.  
A maximum effort should be made to identify each letter on the chart. This m ay include 
encouraging the subject to guess.  If the subject identified a letter as 1 of 2 letters, he or she should be asked to choose one letter and, if necessary, to guess.  When it becomes evident that no further meaningful readings can be made, despit e encouragement to read or guess, 
the examiner should stop the test for that eye.  However, all letters on the last line should be attempted, as letter difficulties vary and the last may be the only 1 read correctly. The study subject should always try to read the next line down to ensure that they have stopped at the small line possible for them to read. The number of letters missed or read incorrectly should be noted. These values will be used to compute overall number of letters read.   
Please refer to t he Study procedure manual for further details.

LENS PATHOLOGY  
See AREDS 2008 Clinical Lens Opacity Standard Photographs Below 
Nuclear Landmarks  - In the normal or nonsclerotic lens, the “nucleus” consists  
of a central dark interval (sulcus), adjacent bean- shaped brighter areas (lentils - 1 
anterior and 1 posterior to the sulcus), and brighter curved bands (lamellae or nuclear surface bands).  Although nuclear sclerosis Standard 1 shows signs of moderate opalescence, many of these features are visible.  
Grading Rules  - For grading the severity of nuclear sclerosis, two factors are 
considered: 1) the optical density (sometimes described as “opalescence”) of the nuclear landmarks, especially the sulcu s, and 2) the definitions of these structures 
(contrast between light and dark bands).  Optical density is given greater weight.  In the early stages of nuclear sclerosis, increased optical density is noticeable only in the normally dark bands, particular the sulcus, but in advanced stages the density of all bands becomes greater.  With increasing nuclear sclerosis, the definition of nuclear landmarks decreases, and finally disappears.  For grading status the primary 
consideration is the degree of reflectance (sometimes termed “opalescence”) of the 
sulcus, with secondary consideration given to the definition of the nuclear features, 
i.e. contrast of the dark and bright bands. 
Slit Lamp Settings  - Grading of nuclear opalescence is done with the illuminating 
beam of the slit lamp angled at 45 ° to the viewing axis, the slitbeam width set at  
0.3 mm or a comparable slit lamp width  and the slitbeam height set at 9  mm. 
If you believe the severity of the opacity is between 2 standard photos, estimate the percent of the way between the two standards; e.g., halfway between 1 and 2 would 
be 1.5.  If the severity of the opacity is greater than the last standard, estimate the percent of the way between the last standard and a completely opacified lens, e.g., 3.8 or 3.3.

PROTOCOL DME -202B  
 
 
VITREOUS PATHOLOGY  
Vitreous pathology will include an examination of the anterior vitreous that can be visualized with the slit lamp technique.  Special notation should be made for hemorrhage, cells, or flare.  Each condition is to be noted and graded according to the following scale:  
 
               None (Normal)  ...     0             Mild ....................  +1       Moderate……........ +2 
               Severe ..................  +3   
 3.       INTRAOCULAR PRESSURE MEASUREMENTS  
Intraocular pressure will be measured with the aid of a TonoPen™ instrument or Goldmann Tonometer. In either case the intraocular pressure will be recorded in the Case Report forms and the method by which the pressure was obtained will also be recorded.

PROTOCOL DME -202B 4.        INDIRECT OPHTHALMOSCOPY  
Ophthalmoscopy is an examination of the back part of the eyeball (fundus), which 
includes the retina , optic disc, choroid , and blood vessels. 
Indirect ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp ophthalmoscopy are performed afte r eye 
drops are placed to dilate the pupils. Direct ophthalmoscopy can be performed with or without dilation of the pupil. 
The examiner performs this examination by holding the eye open. The examiner 
wears an indirect ophthalmoscope on the head. While holding the eye open each quadrant of the eye will be examined and noted for any pathology utilizing a hand-held lens (preferably 20D). If any pathology is found or suspected in the periphery of the retina a scleral depressed examination will also be performed .  
5.    DILATED FUNDUS EXAM  
All readings will be conducted by the Ophthalmologist at the facility where the study is being conducted.  
Pupillary Dilation  
It is recommended that all subjects whenever possible be dilated to a minimum of  
6 to 8mm.  This wi ll allow for better quality imaging and will assist in obtaining 
high quality stereo images. A proven method is the instillation of 1 drop of 1% 
Tropicamide (or equivalent) followed by 1 drop of 2.5% Phenylephrine (or equivalent). Subjects with heavily pig mented irises will take longer to achieve full 
dilation.

 8.  B- SCAN ULTRASOUND FOR PVD  
The following b- scan instructions are simply additional guidance. The formal b- scan 
protocol for site use throughout this study will be provided directly from Duke 
Reading Center.  Posterior vitreous detachment is a common condition associated with aging.  It occurs when the posterior hyaloid detaches or separates from the retina as the vitreous liquefies.  B-scan is a useful tool for detecting the presence of a PVD in both opaque and clear ocular 
media.  A summary of this protocol can be found in Exhibit A (page 10).    
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 63 
PROTOCOL DME -202B Instrumentation  
The Ellex Innovative Imaging v3 B-scan instrument or similar kinetic B -scan is to be used 
for B-scan examinations  on study subjects.  The Ellex machine provides a 10 MHz 
transducer and allows the storage of both static images (echograms) and video footage 
(movies) in 10 second increments.  The suggested steps  to be followed in the use of the v3 
machine are listed in Exhibit B  (page 13). 
 B-scan Basic s  
The B-scan probe contains a transducer surrounded by fluid.  The transducer oscillates 
rapidly back and forth, producing a focused sound beam.  The sound beam moves to and from a marker located on the probe housing.  Once emitted into the eye, the sound beam is 
reflected from any acoustic interfaces in its path (e.g., vitreous pathology and the retina) 
and corresponding echoes are displayed on the display screen of the instrument. The acoustic section obtained is very thin, much like the slice of the knife.  Therefore, for a 
thorough examination of the posterior segment, the sound beam must be moved throughout the vitreous cavity. 
     
Proper interpretation of a B-scan echogram requires knowing where the probe is positioned and where the probe marker is directed.  The B -scan echogram is demarcated on the left by 
the initial line that represents the location of the probe face on the eye.  The right side of 
the echogram corresponds to the portion of the eye located opposite the center of the probe 
face.  The upper aspect of the echogram represents the region of eye where the probe 
marker is directed.  The lower aspect of the echogram corresponds to the region of the eye located opposite the probe marker (Fig 1 ).   
 Subject Confidentiality and Naming Convention Per established HIPAA guidelines, the identity of study subjects must be masked.  Therefore, no identifiable subject data should be visible on any study materials. 
 
A naming convention is used to identify the site, subject, and visit on each A- or B -scan 
image.  The four components of the convention, separated by an underscore ( _), include the site number, subject number, subject initials, and visit label.  These identifiers are recorded as follows: three- digit site number_, three- digit subject number_, three letter 
subject initials_, and a one-digit visit number (e.g., 001_001_ABC_1).  B- scan images 
must also be labeled according to the area of eye examined (see “Labeling B -scan 
Images”).

 *B-scan examination will be performed per the schedule described above.  Should the subject have an unscheduled visit with a B-scan examination, that visit # is 99.    NOTE:  Whenever the investigator  determines (by clinical exam and B -scan) that a subject 
has a total PVD, then B-scan examinations will not be performed on the subject at subsequent visits to the site.    B-scan Screening Examination of the Posterior Segment 
Before starting the examination, ensure that patient identifiers have been  placed on the 
instrument screen (see “Subject Confidentiality and Naming Convention”).  The gain is set 
at maximum and the screen brightness is adjusted appropriately for the detection of low reflective echoes within the vitreous cavity.  An ophthalmic coupling gel is applied to the 
probe.  A preservative free gel (e.g., Gen Teal Gel)  is recommended to minimize irritation 
to the eye.    The patient is positioned comfortably, preferably in a reclined position, with the eye to be 
examined situated close to the screen display to facilitate hand -eye coordination.  Local 
anesthetic drops are instilled and the room lighting is dimmed.  The subject i s asked to 
fixate away from the probe, toward the portion of eye being examined.  The examination is conducted with the probe placed  directly on the conjunctiva.  Placement of the probe on the 
conjunctiva promotes sound beam penetration and helps determine which area of the eye is being examined.    The posterior segment of the eye is examined systematically using basic screening techniques (i.e., specific transverse and longitudinal scans).  The findings of each patient examination are documented with certain  echograms and movies. 
 Longitudinal Scans  
In a longitudinal probe position, the sound beam produces a radial section.  The beam sweeps perpendicular to the limbus and parallel to a single meridian of the opposite fundus (i.e., one clock hour).  For the screening examination, longitudinal scans are performed along the 12:00, 3:00, 6:00, and 9:00 meridians.  The sound beam passes through the optic nerve posteriorly and sweeps anteriorly toward the ciliary body (Fig 2).  Peripheral aspects of a meridian ar e best displayed with the probe resting near the fornix. 
   
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 65 
PROTOCOL DME -202B The probe marker is always directed toward the center of the cornea and the meridian being 
examined.  As the probe is slowly shifted from limbus to fornix, it is simultaneously rocked slightly fro m side to side to help ensure lesion detection.  Longitudinal scans are performed 
as follows: 
• 12:00 meridian; probe is placed at 6:00 
• Nasal meridian; probe is placed at 9:00 OD or 3:00 OS 
• 6:00 meridian; probe is placed at 12:00 
• Temporal meridian; probe is placed at 3:00 OD or 9:00 OS  
 B-scan Characteristics of a PVD  
A total PVD is a complete separation of the posterior hyaloid from the retina.  As defined in this protocol, a total PVD can either remain adherent to or can be detached from the 
optic disc.  On B-scan, a total PVD produces an extensive, thin, membranous acoustic interface of low reflectivity that typically exhibits undulating mobility.  In many cases, a total PVD can be shown to insert into the vitreous base.  Also, a Weiss ring usually can be identified when a total PVD is detached from the optic disc.  The Weiss ring produces one or two distinct, bright, point-like echoes within the plane of the PVD, typically located in the vicinity of the optic disc (Fig 3).  However, in a highly elevated and/or folded PVD, the  
 Weiss ring will usually be situated more anteriorly (and not necessarily overlying the optic disc).  Therefore, detection of the Weiss ring may be more challenging in this form of total 
PVD. 
 
A partial PVD is attached to the retina in one or more areas and may still be attached to the 
macula and optic disc.  Insertion of the PVD into the vitreous base is sometimes demonstrated.  When limited in extent, a partial PVD typically appears as a smooth, shallow membranous acoustic interface that exhibits little or no mobility.  A Weiss ring 
usually cannot be identified in a partial PVD.  No PVD is detected when the posterior hyaloid is completely attached to both t he retina 
and the optic disc.  Assessment of Mo bility 
An important aspect of diagnosing an extensive PVD with B- scan is the evaluation of 
mobility.  An extensive or total PVD typically exhibits an undulating motion.  The mobility of membranous acoustic interfaces is captured in a movie.  To evaluate mo bility, the area of interest is displayed, the probe is held stationary, and the 
patient is asked to move their eye back and forth two or three times.  Sufficient gel is applied to the probe face and a scan is performed with the patient fixating away fr om the 
probe, toward the area being examined.  IMPORTANT : The area of interest should 
remain on the screen throughout the procedure.  This is accomplished by asking the patient to move their eye in the same direction as the sound beam is oscillating.   
   
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 66 
PROTOCOL DME -202B For longitudinal scans (e.g., LM and  RM), the patient is asked to move their eye in a radial 
manner, toward (but not into) the probe face.  During this procedure, the optic nerve void is 
displayed before, during, and following the eye movement.  Maintaining display of the optic nerve void provides for the assessment of lesion mobility in relation to the optic disc (and the macula for the LM and RM views).    Documentation of Findings The presence or absence of a PVD should be clearly documented in both movies and echograms.  The purpose of documentation is to record all pertinent findings of the B- scan 
examination.  When any membranous acoustic interfaces are detected, the appearance, location (including any insertions into the fundus), presence of a Weiss ring , and mobility 
should be well demonstrated.  Movies and echograms are initially stored on the internal 
hard drive of the instrument (see Exhibit B).   To make a movie for the purpose of demonstrating mobility, the first step is to localize the area of interest.  Once the pathology is clearly displayed, the probe is held steady, the patient is asked to maintain their fixation, and the image is frozen.  The probe is then restarted and the patient is asked to move their eye back and forth two or three times (t o fill 
the 10 second time-frame).  By following this procedure, lesion mobility can be captured adequately in the 10 second movie.    Once all findings have been document ed, the images should be reviewed for quality and 
completeness.  If the required images fail to demonstrate the examination findings or are of inferior technical quality, they should be replaced.  Additional movies are encouraged  if 
necessary to thoroughly document all pertinent findings.      
 The images stored on the internal hard drive a re then archived to a flash drive (see  
Exhibit C).  The final step is to upload the images on the flash drive to a website for grading by the Ultrasound Reading Center (see Uploading B- scan Images to Secure 
Website).  
 Baseline Visit  
Vitreous status and mobility is captured in the movies. The required images are:

PROTOCOL DME -202B APPENDIX E:  WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF 
HELSINKI  
 
Recommendations Guiding Physicians in Biomedical Research Involving Human Subjects  
 I. BASIC PRINCIPLES  
 1. Biomedical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles and should be based on adequately performed laboratory and animal ex perimentation and on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature. 
 2. The design and performance of each experimental procedure involving human subjects should be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol which should be transmitted for consideration, comment and guidance to a specially appointed 
committee independent of the investigator and the sponsor, provided that this independent committee is in conformity with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research experiment is performed. 
 3. Biomedical research involving human subjects should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person.  The responsibility for the human subject must always rest with a 
medically qualified person and never rest on the subject of the research, even though the subject has given his or her consent. 
 4. Biomedical research involving human subjects cannot legitimately be carried out unless the importance of the objective is in proportion to the inherent risk to the subject. 
 5. Every biomedical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by careful assessment of predictable risks in comparison with foreseeable benefits to the subject or to others.  Concern for the interests of the subject must always prevail over the interests of science and society.  
 6. The right of the research subject to safeguard his or her integrity must always be respected.  Every precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject 
and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject’s physical and mental integrity and on the personality of the subject. 
 7. Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects unless they are satisfied that the hazards involved are believed to be predictable.  Physicians should cease any investigation if the hazards are found to outweigh the potential benefits. 
   
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 75 
PROTOCOL DME -202B 8. In publication of the results of his or her research, the physician is obliged to 
preserve the  accuracy of the results.  Reports of experimentation not in accordance 
with the principles laid down in this Declaration should not be accepted for publication. 
 9. In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the  aims, methods, anticipated benefits and potential hazards of the 
study and the discomfort it may entail.  He or she should be informed that he or she is at liberty to abstain from participation in the study and that he or she is free to withdraw his or her consent to participation at any time.  The physician should then obtain the subject’s freely -given informed consent, preferably in writing. 
 10. When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly cautious if the  subject is in a dependent relationship to him or her or 
may consent under duress.  In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a physician who is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this official relationship. 
 11. In case of legal incompetence, informed consent should be obtained from the legal 
guardian in accordance with national legislation.  Where physical or mental incapacity makes it impossible to obtain informed consent, or when the subject is a minor, permission from the responsible relative replaces that of the subject in accordance with national legislation.  
  Whenever the minor child is in fact able to give consent, the minor’s consent must 
be obtained in addition to the consent of the minor’s legal guardian. 
 12. The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate that the principles enunciated in the present Declaration are complied with.  
 II. MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH PROFESSIONAL CARE (CLINICAL RESEARCH)  
 1. In the treatment of the sick person, the physician must be free to use a new diagnostic and therapeutic measure, if in his or her judgment it offers hope of saving life, reestablishing health or alleviating suffering.  
 2. The potential benefits, hazards and discomfort of a new method should be weighed 
against the advantages of the best current diagnostic and therapeutic methods. 
 3. In any medical study, every patient - including those of a control group, if any - 
should be assured of the best proven diagnostic and therapeutic methods.  This does not exclude the use of inert placebo in studies where no proven diagnostic or therapeutic method exists.  
 
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 76 
PROTOCOL DME -202B 4. The refusal of the patient to participate in a study must never interfere wi th the 
physician -patient relationship. 
 
5. If the physician considers it essential not to obtain informed consent, the specific reasons for this proposal should be stated in the experimental protocol for transmission to the independent committee (I, 2). 
 6. The physician can combine medical research with professional care, the objective being the acquisition of new medical knowledge, only to the extent that medical research is justified by its potential diagnostic or therapeutic value for the patient.  
 III. NON-THERAPEUTIC BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH INVOLVING HUMAN 
SUBJECTS (NON- CLINICAL BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH)  
 1. In the purely scientific application of medical research carried out on a human being, it is the duty of the physician to remain the protector of the life and health of 
that person on whom biomedical research is being carried out. 
 2. The subjects should be volunteers - either healthy persons or subjects for whom the 
experimental design is not related to the patient’s illness.  
 3. The investigator or the investigating team should discontinue the research if in his/her or their judgment it may, if continued, be harmful to the individual. 
 4. In research on man, the interest of science and society should never take precedence over considerations related to the well -being of the subject.  
ALLEGRO OPHTHALMIC, LLC.  PAGE 77 
PROTOCOL DME -202B APPENDIX F :  STUDY MONITORING  
 
1. Member(s) of the Sponsor’s clinical research team or designee will meet with the investigator prior to the initiation of the study, in order to assess the adequacy of the investigator’s patient population, facilities, and equipment, and to familiarize the investigator with the protocol. 
 2. A member of the Sponsor’s clinical research team or designee will meet with the investigator after several of the subjects have initiated the study, in order to ensure 
that the subjects are being properly selected, that adequate supplies for the study have been provided and that the assignment of medication is properly recorded.  In addition, the monitor will verify that the investigator follows the approved pr otocol 
and all approved amendments, if any, by reviewing the investigator’s regulatory documents, source documents, informed consent forms, and case report forms of study subjects. 
 3. A member of the Sponsor’s clinical research team or designee will meet with the 
investigator when all subjects have completed the Final Visit of the study, in order to collect the Case Report Forms, unused drugs, and unused supplies and materials. 
 4. Interim monitoring visits and telephone consultations will occur as necessary, to ensure the proper progression and documentation of the study.

including subject identification number and initials, name of investigator, date(s), 
etc.  All applicable questions should be answered and all data requested should be supplied.  Those areas, which require a response but are not filled in correctly are considered incomplete or erroneous entries, and will have to be corrected.  Supplying all the necessary data the first time saves office time for the investigator during subsequent audits and monitoring visits. 
 
3. If the investigator needs to correct an erroneous entry on the source documents, the only acceptable procedure  is to draw a single horizontal line  through the incorrect 
entry, enter the correct data next to it, then initial and date the new entry, explain if 
necessary, without obscuring the original entry.  Even if the correction is made on 
the same date as at the top of the form, the date must still be supplied next to the correction, since there is no other way of identifying when the correction was made.  Correction fluid (“Whiteout”), eraser, or any other correction methods that would obscure the original entry are NOT allowed. 
 4. All medications used should be recorded on the Concomitant Medication form, with the appropriate start and stop date as applicable.  
5. All Adverse Events should be recorded on the Adverse Event form with appropriate event name, start and stop dates, relation to study drug, intensity, and outcome. 
 6. The completed source documents are to be reviewed and signed by the Principal Investigator or designee.

Effects of Sleep -Extend on glucose metabolism in women with a history of gestational diabetes  Version 9 
Page 4 of 21 2/1/2020  1.0 Project Summary/Abstract  
Women with a history of gestational diabetes (GDM) are at high risk of developing 
diabetes in the future. Lifestyle intervention with diet and exercise  have been shown to 
help reduce this risk. Sleep disturbances are emerging as risk factors for incident 
diabetes. Studies have shown that those sleeping <5 -6 hours/day had 5 -45% increase 
in the risk of diabetes. We have also shown that in women with a prior history of GDM, 
those reporting sleeping <6 hours/night had a significantly higher fasting glucose levels. 
In healthy volunteer who were short sleepers, sleep extension in a few studies have 
been shown to improve glucose metabolism. Therefore, in this study, we propose to test 
the effects of 6 -week sleep extension, using technology -assisted sleep intervention, in 
women with a history of GDM and short sleep on glucose metabolism by randomized 
controlled study.  
2.0 BACKGROUND/SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE  
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects 4 -9% of pregnant women 1. Women 
with a history of GDM are at a 7 -fold higher risk of developing future type 2 diabetes 
compared to those with normoglycemia during pregnancy 2. Public health impact of 
GDM is significant as it was estimated that 10 -31% of parous women with type 2 
diabetes had a prior history of GDM3.  While risks of future diabetes include traditional 
factors such as obesity, physical inactivity and family history of diabetes, sleep is 
increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor 4. Despite the findings that 
insufficient sleep in women with a prior history of GDM is common, and associated with 
impaired glucose metabolism , our present understanding of the effects of sleep 
extension on glucose metabolism and future diabetes risk in these women is very 
limited.  
Insufficient sleep has been shown to increase diabetes risk by multiple pathways. 
Experimental sleep restriction resulted in increased insulin resistance without adequate 
compensatory increase in insulin secretion5. This is likely a result of changes in appetite 
regulating hormones promoting hunger and weight gain, alterations in inflammatory 
markers, changes in energy expenditure and abnormal adipocyte function 6. 
The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a sleep extension 
intervention in women with a prior history of GDM and habitual short sleep duration  on 
the outcomes of glucose metabolism . This proposal is based on recent observations 
and newly developed sleep intervention from our group.  (1) Women with a prior 
history of GDM who reported sleeping ≤6h/night  had significantly higher fasting glucose 
and glucose response following oral glucose tolerance test than those sleeping 
>6h/night 7.  (2) Half of the women with a prior history of GDM reported insufficient sleep 
≤6h/night 7  (3) A pilot study of a 2 -week behavioral sleep optimization in adults without 
54 ________________________________ ________________________________ ___________________________   
Effects of Sleep -Extend on glucose metabolism in women with a history of gestational diabetes  Version 9 
Page 5 of 21 2/1/2020  diabetes who had habitual short sleep duration led to improved fasting insulin 
resistance. (4) A pilot trial  of our newly developed  technology -assisted behavioral sleep 
optimization intervention in individuals with short sleep duration demonstrated a 
clinically significant sleep duration increase ( median 35 minutes ). Therefore, this 
proposal  seek s to improve glucose metabolism in women with a prior history of 
GDM and habitual short sleep using sleep extension intervention under a 
randomized controlled design.  
Our novel technology -assisted sleep intervention was developed to leverage a 
rapidly increasing public interest in sleep tracking, especially  wearable sleep tracker use  
by consumers (+500% in 3 years). Our technology employs four elements -- a wearable 
sleep tracker, didactic content, an interactive smartphone application and brief 
telephone counseling  8. This study will randomize 60 non-diabetic women with a history 
GDM who report  short sleep duration to an eight -week  sleep extension intervention 
group or a healthy living information control group. We hypothesize that this sleep 
extension intervention will be feasible, acceptable and improve glucose metabolism.  
 
3.0 Objectives/Aims  
The specific aims are to determine:  
Aim 1:  Feasibility and acceptability of sleep extension intervention . Rationale : Analysis 
of recruitment, retention and participant program evaluation will provide feasibility and 
acceptability data.  Hypothesis:  Sleep extension intervention  will be feasible and 
acceptable to the target population. Approach : Feasibility will be determined through 
analysis of recruitment and retention. Acceptability will be determined through 
participant evaluation.  
Aim 2 : Efficacy of sleep extension intervention  on primary outcomes of glucose 
metabolism . Rationale:  Short sleep duration was associated with abnormal glucose 
metabolism in women with previous GDM . Sleep optimization in short sleeping 
individuals without diabetes resulted in improved insulin resistance. Hypothesis : Sleep 
extension intervention  will result in improved glycemic control. Approach : A randomized 
controlled trial of an 8 -week sleep extension intervention compared to a healthy living 
information control group on glucose metabolism  as measured by an oral glucose 
tolerance test and A1C at baseline and at the end of intervention.  
Aim 3 : Efficacy of sleep extension intervention  on secondary outcomes of weight, 
appetite regulating hormones, energy expenditure, inflammatory markers, depressive 
symptoms and subjective sleep quality .

Page 7 of 21 2/1/2020  4.3 Excluded or Vulnerable Populations  
• Non-English speaking subjects - unable to participate in questionnaires  
 
5.0 Subject Enrollment  
 
• Describe screening and enrollment.  
• Describe from where subjects will be recruited and any advertising or 
recruitment materials that will be used.  
• Describe what happens with screen failures and any data obtained from 
screen failures.  
• Describe the methods to minimize coercion and undue influence on the 
subjects.   
• Describe the procedures to separate clinical responsibilities and influence 
from research responsibilities and influence.  
 
We will employ the following recruitment/enrollment methods:   
1. Passive Advertising: We will distribute study advertisement materials throughout 
UI Health  and local health centers , including clinical environments.  Emails 
through UIC email system will beused.  Individuals will call research assistants 
(RAs) or principal investigator (PI) or co -PIs for eligibility assessment by phone.  
2. Active Recruitment in Clinical Sites  within UIHealth : On-site RAs will receive 
additional referrals directly from staff or patients interested in the study. In these 
situations, PI, co -PIs or RAs will discuss the study and assess eligibility in a 
private exam room within the clinic before or after a clinical encounter.  
Additionally, we will work with Mile Square Health Centers to screen the 
appointment list of patients visiting the clinics. Potential eligible subjects will be 
identified by EMR and PI/RAs will discuss the study at the visit as described.  
3. Active Recruitment from Registries: The research assistants will work from a 
CCTS -approved list of patients with previous GDM , identified from the electronic 
medical record. A list of UIC patients with a history of gestational diabetes or 
abnormal 3 -hour oral glucose tolerant test in the past 10 years will be obtained 
from CCTS. In addition, CCTS will retrieve a list of patients with a diagnosis of 
gestational diabetes from July 2018 onwards throughout the duration of this 
protocol. This is essential to identify potential subjects and without this 
information, the research will be very difficult to conduct. The information from 
CCTS will include diagnoses, laboratory report (of glucose values and HbA1c), 
name, age, medical record numbers, address and phone numbers. Medical 
records will then be reviewed to ensure eligibility. We will send letters informing 
patients that they may be eligible for the study and may opt -out of further contact. 
After one week of mailing the letters, those who do not opt out will be contacted 
by the RAs to assess interest and eligibility.  In addition, if the potentially eligible 
subjects have an appointment at UIC clinic s, a research assistant will go and 
meet with the subjects either before or after the appointments and ask if they 
may be interested in hearing more about the study using the approved script. If 
the subjects express interest but do not have time, a flyer will be given to them if 
54 ________________________________ ________________________________ ___________________________   
Effects of Sleep -Extend on glucose metabolism in women with a history of gestational diabetes  Version 9 
Page 8 of 21 2/1/2020  they would like. If they would like to be contacted at a later time, an arrangement 
will be done with the RA.  
4. Online Recruitment: will be done through https://www.researchmatch.org/ . 
Potential subjects will contact investigators via email or telephone, after which 
eligibility will be determined as above.   
Screening  
• Upon a contact with s ubjects believed to be eligible , PI, co -PI or RA will inquire 
about potential interest in study participation following the IRB approved 
recruitment script. They will be screened verbally for inclu sion/exclusion criteria 
utilizing an IRB approved script  (see Eligibility check list and Recruitment script). 
If the subject  is eligible and interested, study personnel  will review the study in 
detail, using an IRB ap proved consent form as guidance, plan for informed 
consent form (ICF) signing and study participation dates if appropriate.   
• It will be made clear on initial contact that participation is entirely voluntary and 
that acceptance or decline will not impact the care they receive at UIHHSS.  
• A password protected file will be maintained of subjects approached but not 
interested, and those who expressed interest but did not meet inclusion/exclusion 
criteria.  
 
 
6.0 Study Design and Procedures  
 
Additional s creening for eligibility  
• After informed consent is obtained, the participants will undergo additional 
screening including A1C and urine pregnancy test . These will be done 
with spot urine samples and finger stick  or blood tests . If the A1C test from 
the finger stick is abnormal (≥ 6.5%), blood test (5 ml) will be done to 
confirm eligibility.  
 
Study protocol

Study procedures:  are detailed as follow  
1.  Questionnaires:  Participants will complete standardized questionnaires. The 
Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) assesses sleep quality in the past month,9 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) assesses daytime sleepiness,10, PROMIS Sleep 
questionnaire,  Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) assesses insomnia symptoms,11 the STOP 
BANG questionnaire assesses risk of obstructive sleep apnea ,12,13 the Center for 
Epidemiological Studies Depression (CESD) assess depressive symptoms 14, quality of 
life15, anxiety symptoms (GAD -7)16, perceived stress scale17, PROMIS fatigue scale . 
54 ________________________________ ________________________________ ___________________________   
Effects of Sleep -Extend on glucose metabolism in women with a history of gestational diabetes  Version 9 
Page 10 of 21 2/1/2020  Three factor eating questionnaires and Internal Physical Activity Questionnaires (IPAQ) 
will also be collected.   ISI and STOP BANG will be used to screen for eligible 
participants.  PROMIS,  PSQI, ESS , Eating questionnaire, IPAQ  and CESD will be given 
at baseline and at the end of the protocol.  
2. Wrist actigraphy to measure behavioral sleep  Participants will wear an Actiwatch 
Spectrum Plus (Respironics, USA) on their non -dominant wrist for one week during 
baseline assessment, and at week 6 and week 10 . Data will be collected in 30 -sec 
epochs. Subjects will be asked to keep a daily sleep log and press an event marker on 
the Actiwatch at bedtime and wake -up time. Data will be downloaded and reviewed with 
each participant to clarify inconsistencies when the Actiwatch is returned. Rest intervals 
will be set using reported try -to-fall-asleep times and wake -up times on daily sleep logs 
or event markers if these times are missing. Using the Immobile Minutes algorithm in 
the Actiware 6 software, we will derive the following outcome variables: sleep onset, 
sleep offset, sleep duration, sleep efficiency (a measure of sleep quality), mid -sleep 
time (time point between sleep onset and wake time), and standard deviation (SD) of 
sleep duration, an indicator of sleep regularity which we previously showed to be related 
to glucose metabolism.18  
3. Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) . After an overnight fast, the subject will 
arrive at the CRC between 8 -9 am. Blood samples will be obtained at 0 minutes for 
glucose and insulin. Then 75 grams glucose solution will be given orally. Blood samples 
will be obtained at 30, 60, 90, 120 minutes for glucose and insulin. Extra blood samples 
will also be obtained at 0 minutes and stored for further analysis. Total blood volume  
60 ml per one OGTT visit.  
4. Blood samples  will be obtained for lipid panel, creatinine and A1C  at baseline and at 
week 6. CBC will be obtained at baseline.  Fasting glucose and insulin will be obtained 
at week 10 .  Blood will be saved for later assay for genetic analysis, appetite regulating 
hormones (leptin, ghrelin, PYY, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG)), and inflammatory 
markers (CRP, IL -1, IL-6) and metabolomics profiles. Total blood sample 20 ml  at 
each visit.  
5. Microbiome  Stool samples to measure the gut microbiome will b e collected at week 
0 and week 6 . Changes in sleep may alter the gut microbiome and potentially influence 
glycemia. Participants will be provided a collection device (Easysampler®, ALPCO, Inc.) 
and return the specimen at a subsequent visit. Remaining stool samples will be stored 
in a freezer at the College of Medicine for later analysis by UIC researchers.   
6. Resting energy expenditure :  Oxygen consumption will be measured through 
indirect calorimetry using the Vyntus CPX system metabolic cart (Vyaire Medical, 
Mettawa, IL). In this test, a canopy hood is placed over the subject’s head as he/she 
reclines in bed. One end of the canopy has tubing connected to the metabolic cart, 
while the other end of the canopy is open to room air. During the 30 -40 minute 
procedure, expired gases are measured and resting energy expenditure is calculated 
using the Harris -Benedict equations.  This will be performed during fasting.  
54 ________________________________ ________________________________ ___________________________   
Effects of Sleep -Extend on glucose metabolism in women with a history of gestational diabetes  Version 9 
Page 11 of 21 2/1/2020  7. Feasibility and acceptability of Sleep extension:  Feasibility will be determined 
through analysis of recruitment (number recruited, screened, eligible, and consented) 
and retention (% session participation, program completion rates). Acceptability will be 
determined through participant evaluation (written evaluation and interview at program 
completion).  See Appendix B.  
8. Intervention Description: Sleep Extension  The goal of sleep extension  is to 
increase sleep time by ≥ 30 minutes. Participants randomized to the intervention will 
receive: (1) a wearable sleep tracker; (2) a smart phone application with interactive 
feedback and tools; (3) didactic content including weekly email lessons, reminders, and 
notifications; and (4) brief telephone coaching. The components are described below.  
8.1 Wearable sleep tracker:  A Fitbit Alta HR wearable sleep tracker allows participants 
to track their sleep and share results with the coach, not for the main study outcome 
(measured with actigraphy). Consumer sleep trackers provide an estimation of sleep but 
are less precise than actigraphy devices.19,20 Therefore, our main outcome will be 
measured with actigraphy, which is validated but does not provide real -time feedback to 
the wearer.21 Fitbit data will be used in coaching sessions and for providing weekly 
reports. The coach will have access to participants’ sleep tracker data through a 
dashboard using the Fitabase platform.  
8.2 Smartphone application: Participants will download the Fitbit smartphone 
application on their smartphone and participate in brief training in the intervention 
orientation session. Participants will be trained to review and edit their Fitbit sleep log 
each day, increasing the data validity. Though the application has the ability to enter 
sleep goals, these features will not be set on participants’ applications.  
8.3 Intervention content:  Participants will receive automated content, including didactic 
lessons (weekly), individualized progress reports (weekly), and bedtime reminder text 
messages (30 min before scheduled bedtime; can be disabled for Weeks 4 -6). The 
intervention content was developed by psychologists with advanced training in sleep 
and behavior change ( Dr. Duffecy  and Dr. Baron ) and has been piloted in initial user 
testing. The 6 weekly didactic lessons (estimated duration 8 -10 min), of written and 
video didactic content will be delivered via email and can be viewed on a smartphone, 
desktop, or tablet. Content from the lessons will be reinforced in the telephone coaching 
sessions (see Appendix A).  Participants will receive an automatically generated report 
each week detailing their days of device usage, average bedtime, wake time, sleep 
duration, and an encouraging statement linked to weekly didactic content. They will be 
asked to fill the visual analog scale for hunger one day per week (once in the morning 
before breakfast and once before bedtime).  
8.4 Coaching:  All participants will be assigned to a sleep coach to monitor their 
progress during the study and provide weekly telephone coaching sessions related to 
their sleep -related goals . Drs. Duffecy  and Dr. Baron  will act as coaches for this pilot.  
The coaching protocol, developed by Dr. Duffecy, is based on the principles of 
Supportive Accountability.22 The coach will establish legitimacy  by their knowledge of 
54 ________________________________ ________________________________ ___________________________   
Effects of Sleep -Extend on glucose metabolism in women with a history of gestational diabetes  Version 9 
Page 12 of 21 2/1/2020  sleep and basic counseling principles. They will establish goals with the participants 
based on the participants’ values and beliefs, including sleep -related goals and usage 
goals (e.g., number of days wearing the sleep tracker). Performance monitoring  will 
be completed through an online dashboard visible to the coach (Fitabase Inc.). The 
dashboard will contain data from sleep diaries and the wearable sleep tracker. The first 
coaching session will be a 20 -min engagement session, which includes introductions, 
rationale for the program, roles of the coach, and the participants’ goals for the program. 
Coach will provide feedback to the participant based on wearable sleep tracker data. 
For coaching sessions 2 -8, the coach and participant will also have weekly brief (5 -10 
min) follow -up support calls to review progress, problem solve barriers to progress, and 
set goals for the following week. Between sessions, coach will be available to 
troubleshoot any problems. The use of coaching has been demonstrated to improve 
adherence to technology -based interventions.23,24 Drs. Duffecy  and Dr. Baron  have 
extensive experience in the use of coaching to improve adherence to technology -based 
interventions.23,25 -27 
8.5 Hunger rating based on visual analog scale (0 -100) will be given to the subjects to 
fill one day per week, in the morning  before breakfast and before bedtime.  
9. Attention control: Health Education. Use of a control group is to control for the 
coach contact in the intervention group. Participants assigned to the control group will 
be provided weekly health education emails (e.g., nutrition, stretching exercises; 
Appendix A). They will be instructed to maintain their sleep schedule but not monitored 
with diaries or  coaching, a technique that produces little change in sleep timing.28 
Participants will receive weekly brief telephone contact from the coach (≤ 5 min) to 
answer questions. They will be asked to fill the visual analog scale for hunger one day 
per week (once in the morning before breakfast and once before bedtime). After the final 
follow -up, control participants will receive  a Fitbit fitness tracker and PDF files of the 6 
didactic lessons by mail.  
 
All procedures in the protocol are research related. The research will take place at the 
College of Nursing, 845 S. Damen or at the Clinical Research Center.

7.0 Expected Risks/Benefits  
 
Potential  Risks  
The potential  risks to subjects  include:   
1. Bleeding,  irritation,  discomfort,  or infection  at the finger  prick  site (for A1C)  and 
blood draw . The risk for these  problems  is very minor  and is minimized  by following  
standardized  procedures  using  trained  study  personnel.   
2. Loss  of confidentiality.  Standard  procedures  will be used  to avoid  breaches  in 
confidentiality.  We expect  this risk to be low.  
3. Completing  self-report  measures  on sleep  and mood  may cause  subjects  some  
emotional  distress.   
4. Actiwatch  may cause  minor  irritation  but this is a rare event.   
5. Risks  associated  with the intervention  may include  irritation  due to wearing  the 
Fitbit  devices.  No other  risks are currently  identified.  
6. The intervention  intends  to increase  sleep  duration  but it may or may not be able 
to do so. Since  sleep  is linked  to glucose,  it is possible  that the glucose  levels  could 
worsen  if the intervention  could  not increase  sleep.  However,  this is expected  to be 
minimal,  if at all. The precaution  is taken  as subjects  with diabetes  are not eligible  to 
participate.

Page 14 of 21 2/1/2020  7. Privacy and  confidentiality : Despite best efforts, medical record collection could 
be compromised leading to a loss of privacy regarding confidential health 
information. To minimize this risk, no patient identifying information will be 
recorded in any research documents that are created. Indirect identifiers will be 
used to link data obtained from different methods. The key will be stored 
separately from the data and will be destroyed after data collection has been 
completed.  
 
Protections  Against  Risk  
Methods  to minimize  risk include:  
1. Minimization  of bleeding,  irritation,  discomfort,  or infection  at the blood  draw  site. 
The risk for these  problems  is very minor  and is minimized  by following  standardized  
procedures.  Blood draws  will be done  using  sterile  technique  and standardized  
procedures.  These  will be performed  by trained  personnel.   
2. Completing  self-report  measures  on sleep  and depressive  mood  may cause  
subjects  some  emotional  distress.  The risk is minimal.  In our previous  studies  with the 
same  population,  no subjects  reported  emotional  distress  with these  measures.  
However,  study  staff will be aware  of the possibility  and address  any concerns  that are 
voiced.  
3. Actiwatch  could  cause  minor  irritation,  however,  this is rare. Should  this happen,  
the subjects  can choose  to discontinue  the study  at anytime.  
4. Drinking  glucose  solution  may be unpleasant  for some  subjects.  However,  this 
solution  is used  in standard  medical  care to screen  for diabetes.  The subjects  can 
discontinue  their participation  if deemed  intolerable.   
5. Should  a subject  require  medical  or other  professional  intervention  due to an 
adverse  event  or illness,  treatment  may be obtained  through  the UIC Medical  Center,  
the subject’s  regular  doctor,  or the treatment  center  or clinic  of their choice.  Subjects  will 
be provided  contact  information  for the PI should  they want  to talk to her about  their 
illness  or injury.   
6. To prevent coercive contact from the application and coach, all email outreach is 
pre-scripted and user contact information is never revealed. Outreach emails will state 
that the coach has noticed they have not completed sleep diaries or worn the Fitbit in a 
few days and ask if they would like troubleshooting help or to return to the program. It 
will not include any coercive language or pressure. Email communication will be limited 
to pre -scripted content reminders and participant outreach.  
7. Participants will be informed that they may discontinue the intervention at any 
time. In the event that an adverse event is experienced participants will be instructed to 
contact Dr. Reutrakul  or Dr. Duffecy. Phone numbers will be provided through which 
one of the investigators can be reached 7 days/week, 24 hours/day.  
8. If during  the protocol,  the A1C is found  to be >6.5%  but less than 7%, the 
participants  will be kept in the study  but informed  of the test results  at the end of the 
protocol.  If A1C is >7%,  the will be discontinued  from the study  as this will require  
medical  treatment  from their primary  care physician.   
 
Potential  Benefits  of the Proposed  Research  to Human  Subjects  and Others  
54 ________________________________ ________________________________ ___________________________   
Effects of Sleep -Extend on glucose metabolism in women with a history of gestational diabetes  Version 9 
Page 15 of 21 2/1/2020  There  may be no direct  benefits  to participating  in the study.  However,  subjects  in 
the intervention  group  may increase  sleep  duration  and experience  increased  glucose  
control.  The potential to future participants is that this study may advance the 
knowledge of sleep interventions to extend sleep duration and improve glucose control. 
The possible  risks are no greater  than those  experienced  in normal  day-to-day life.  
 
Importance  of Knowledge  to be Gained.   
The risks to the study  participants  are minimal  and no more  than those  encountered  
in daily life. Knowledge  gained  from this study  may provide  an important  intervention  for 
improving  sleep  and glycemic  control  in the future  in women  with previous  GDM . If 
effective,  this intervention  has important  clinical  implications  for improving  glycemic  
control  and improving  quality  of life in this population.  This intervention  is scalable  and 
could  have  public  health  impact.  
 
 
8.0 Data Collection and Management Procedures  
 
Loss  of confidentiality.  Strict  procedures  will be put into place  to minimize  the risk of 
breach  of confidentiality.  All study  staff will be trained  on methods  of maintaining  subject  
confidentiality.  Subjects  will be assigned  a unique  code  number.  A master  list that links 
the subject  identity  to the data will be kept by the principal  investigator  (PI) and stored  in 
a locked  office  separately  from the data.  Data  storage : All data will be stored  and 
analyzed  by code  number.  This consists  of coded  questionnaires,  blood  draw  results,  
actigraphy.  The coded  data will be entered  into a password -protected  computer  with a 
secure  server  for analysis , REDCap . Hard  copy  (paper  copy)  data (blood  draw  results)  
will be stored  in a locked  office.  No identifiers  (except  subject  ID) will be included.  Only 
members  of the research  team  will be able to access  these  data.  Procedures  during  
data collection:  Privacy  will be provided  during  recruitment  by screening  potential  
subjects  in a private  setting.  The screening  data that contain  personal  identifiers  will be 
kept separate  from the coded  study  data and stored  in a locked  office.  All data 
collection  and study  procedures  will take place  in a private  location.  All data collected 
via the intervention (e.g. internet intervention materials, data entry, etc.) will be 
transmitted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption to prevent eavesdropping 
and tampering information while it is in the transmission pipeline. To prevent 
unauthorized access to internet sites, they will be password protected.  
 
 
Signed original informed consent documents and paper questionnaires will be stored in 
a locked cabinet in a locked room in the Division of Endocrinology and accessible only 
to the study PI. Access to the data will be determined by the PI and include study 
personnel at the level appropriate to complete their role in the study.  
 
Samples will be stored as above described in Dr. Layden’s lab at -80degC.  This lab is 
accessible only to approved endocrinology personnel with locked door access only.

Page 16 of 21 2/1/2020  Records (including the ICFs) will be maintained for at least 1 5 years following study 
completion.  
 
9.0 Data Analysis  
• The data will be analyzed by the PI and team. Statistical assistance will be 
obtained from CCTS if needed.  
 
10.0 Quality Control and Quality Assurance  
 
Actiwatch data will be analyzed by a software provided by the manufacturer. Fitbit data 
will be automatically analyzed by the software of the manufacturer.  
Data collected through the EMR will be obtained by study personnel and should a 
question of result validity be raised, the study PI will adjudicate entry or omission.  
 
Dr. Reutrakul and Dr. Duffecy will monitor the research and evaluate the data quality.  
 
11.0 Data and Safety Monitoring  
• Addresses how problems/side effects will be identified and handled. 
• For studies that are minimal risk, describe how potential prob lems will be 
monitored and handled (e.g., breaches of confidentiality, emotional 
upset). 
• For research involving more than minimal risk to subjects, describe: 
• Who will monitor adverse events (AEs) and unanticipated prob lems 
(UPs) involving risks to subjects or others and when events will be 
assessed . 
• How AEs or UPs will be recorded and  communicated amo ngst 
research team members and who is responsible for making the 
reports. 
• The comp osition of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) 
and how frequently the DSMB meets , if one has been formed for the 
study. 
• Identify how often AEs and UPs will be monitored and what events 
will be reported to the sponsor and/or the IRB. 
• Descri be stopping rules for the study. 
• Describe what occurs if a sub ject withdraws prematurely. 
Data  Safety  Monitoring  Plan   
CO PIs: Sirimon  Reutrakul,  Jennifer  Duffecy,  Pamela  Martyn -Nemeth  
 
The risk associated  with this study  is minimal  for the interventions  and data collection  
methods  employed  by the study.  The potential  for a serious  adverse  event  is very low. 
Dr. Reutrakul  will be the primary  monitor,  and a Safety  Monitoring  Committee  will share  
the responsibility  of monitoring  the data.   
 
54 ________________________________ ________________________________ ___________________________   
Effects of Sleep -Extend on glucose metabolism in women with a history of gestational diabetes  Version 9 
Page 17 of 21 2/1/2020  The individuals  responsible  for data safety  and monitoring  will be Dr. Sirimon  Reutrakul,  
Dr. Laurie  Quinn,  Dr. Pamela  Martyn -Nemeth  and Dr. Jennifer  Duffecy,  and a Study  
Monitoring  Committee  (SMC).  A SMC  will be appointed  to provide  oversight  and 
monitoring  of our data on an annual  basis  by individuals  not directly  associated  with the 
study.  The SMC  will consist  of: (1) Cynthia Fritschi  , PhD,  RN, Assistant  Professor,  
Department  of Biobehavioral  Health  Science,  College  of Nursing;  (2) Elena  Baren golts , 
MD, Professor  of Medicine,  Department  of Medicine,  Endocrinology,  Diabetes  and 
Metabolism;  and (3) Mary Kapella , PhD,  RN,  Assistant  Professor,  Department  of 
Biobehavioral  Health  Science,  College  of Nursing;  —all at UIC. Drs. Fritschi,  Dr. 
Barengolts  and Dr. Kapella  have  expertise  in reviewing  the scientific  design,  conduct  of 
study,  intervention  fidelity,  evaluation  of safety  and risks to subjects,  interpretation  of 
data,  and making  recommendations  concerning  continuation,  modification,  suspension,  
or termination  of the study.   
Dr. Sirimon  Reutrakul,  Dr. Laurie  Quinn,  Dr. Pamela  Martyn -Nemeth  and Dr. Jennifer  
Duffecy,  will meet  with the SMC  annually  and provide  a written  and verbal  progress  
report.  The report  will include  a summary  of cumulative  recruitment,  randomization,  
cumulative  retention  and attrition  rate, study  group  demographics,  adverse  events,  and 
data completeness  and quality.  The SMC  will provide  oversight  of the study,  as well as 
consider  factors  external  to the study  that may impact  the safety  of the participants  or 
the ethics  of the study.  A written  report  of the meeting  will be compiled  that summarizes  
the review  of data and outcomes,  as well as any recommendations  with respect  to 
modification  of the protocol.   
 
Subjects feeling uncomfortable with the procedures can choose to terminate their 
participation at anytime.  Should this occur, the PI will record the events and share the 
information with the investigators.  
 
The subjects will be compensated $2 00 for completing the protocol, and they will be 
given a fit bit  that is used during the protocol . If the baseline actigraphy revealed that 
their sleep duration is ≥7 hours during the work days or weekdays, they will receive $30 
but not be able to participate further. The control subjects will receive fitbit as well.   
 
Potential breaches of confidentiality are guarded against by the above measures 
(section 8.0).  How ever should personal information be mistakenly disseminated , action 
will be taken to secure study data, and study procedures for data safety and security will 
be re -evaluated.  If necessary, subjects and the IRB will be notified according to 
Institutional policy.  
 
 
12.0 Statistical Considerations  
54 ________________________________ ________________________________ ___________________________   
Effects of Sleep -Extend on glucose metabolism in women with a history of gestational diabetes  Version 9 
Page 18 of 21 2/1/2020  • If a study incorporates qualitative rather than quantitative methods, indicate 
this and describe qualitative analysis and disregard the rest of this section.  
• Mean differences in glucose parameters between control a nd intervention groups 
will be analyzed using independent t -tests.  
• Using a mean difference in fasting glucose values between women with a history of 
GDM who slept <6 hr vs ≥6 hr of 8  mg/dL, a total of 40 patients will have to be 
randomized to achieve power  of 80% to detect a treatment difference at a two -sided 
0.05 significance.  
• For this pilot study, we will randomize at 2:1 sleep extension: control ratio.  
 
13.0 Regulatory Requirements  
13.1 Informed Consent   
 
Potentially  eligible  interested  subjects  will be screened  by study  personnel  for inclusion  
and exclusion  criteria . Informed consent will be obtained by study personnel who have 
been appropriately trained.  Study personnel will thoroughly review the ICF with 
subjects.  Patients will be given adequate time to review ICF  themselves  and ask 
questions about protocol prior to signing.  All involved study personnel will complete 
necessary ethics and IRB training to participate in research study administration.  
Signed original informed consent documents will be stored in a locked cabinet in a 
locked room in the Division of Endocrinology and  will be  accessible only to the study PI.  
 
The waiver  for recruitment  purposes  will be applied  to facilitate  identification  of potential  
subjects.  There  will be only minimal  risk in allowing  access  to patient’s  diagnosis  only.  
Complete  informed  consent  will take place  once  eligibility  is confirmed  
 
13.2 Subject Confidentiality  
Confidentiality will be maintained by limiting access to only study personnel.  
Additionally, collected data will be stored by subject number rather than by name or 
medical record number, with the exception of one password protected file which will be 
able to link a given subject number to an individual patient.  This file will be maintained 
in a password protected location on REDCap system.  After study completion, the file 
linking de -identified subject number with identifiable patient name and medical record 
number will be maintained but access will be provided only to study PI.

Page 19 of 21 2/1/2020  13.3 Unanticipated Problems  
Procedures  for identifying,  reviewing,  and reporting  adverse  events  and 
unanticipated  problems  to the IRB. 
Throughout  the study,  Dr. Reutrakul  will monitor  the participants  for adverse  events  
(AEs).  Dr. Reutrakul  and study  staff will review  AEs individually  in real time and in 
aggregate  on a monthly  basis  and consult  with co-investigators  as needed.  Dr. 
Reutrakul  will review  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  in real time.  Dr. Reutrakul  will 
ensure  that all protocol  deviations,  AEs,  and SAEs  are reported  to the UIC IRB 
according  to applicable  IRB requirements,  and corrective  actions  will be taken  as 
deemed  necessary  by the IRB. Events  determined  by the PI to be unanticipated  
problems  that are SAEs  involving  risks to subjects  or others  will be reported  by the PI to 
the UIC IRB per IRB policy  or within  1 week.  Unanticipated  problems  that are 
determined  by the PI to be not serious  will be reported  per IRB policy  or within  2 weeks.   
 
All study  staff will be informed  by Dr. Reutrakul  about  AEs.  If any protocol  changes  are 
needed,  a modification  request  will be submitted  to the UIC IRB. Protocol  changes  will 
not be implemented  prior to IRB approval  unless  necessary  to eliminate  apparent  
immediate  hazards  to the research  subjects.  In such  a case,  the IRB will be promptly  
informed  of the change  following  implementation,  according  to IRB policy.

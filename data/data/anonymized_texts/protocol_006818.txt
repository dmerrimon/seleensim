1. Abstract  
a. Provide no more than a one page research abstract briefly stating the problem, the re search 
hypothesis, and the importance of the research.   
Restricted nasal breathing is a common  complaint among patients presenting to Otolaryngology clinics [1]. 
In fact, one in eight people experiences some degree of nasal obstruction, or regular diffic ulty breathing 
through the nose, which is often the result of a narrowing or collapse of the internal n asal valve [2, 3]. This 
condition is a daily source of discomfort that reduces productivity and quality of life [4]. Sufferers report 
labored breathing  throughout the day, difficulty sleeping and habitual snoring, and limited  stamina during 
sports and exercise [4].  
Slight dilation of the nasal passages directly counteracts nasal obstruction and reverses sympt oms in 89% 
of those afflicted [5 ]. To this end, m any patients undergo functional rhinoplasty procedures to surgic ally 
widen the nasal passages [6 ]. However, up to 20% of patients experience unimproved or wors ened 
symptoms postoperatively [7 ]. Moreover, these surgeries are invasive, requiring autologous g rafts taken 
from the nose, ear, or ribs; and they enta il a yearlong recovery period [7 ].  
Nasal dilators such as Breathe Right strips offer a potential alternative to surgery, as they mechanically 
expand the nasal passages to effectively relieve obstructio n. However, existing products are designed as 
sleep aids, and customers find them uncomfortable, difficult to use, and too visible to wear in public [8]. 
Although the mechanism for reversing nasal obstruction is straightforward, surgery is considered the o nly 
viable option for those who struggle to breathe  during the day.   
Engineers from the Johns Hopkins Biomedical Engineering Department, partnered with cli nicians from the 
Johns Hopkins D epartment of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery , have developed Schnozzle , a 
small silicone stent to counteract  nasal valve collapse  and relieve restricted nasal breathing . We 
hypothesize that this device  will improve symptoms of nasal obstruction and provide patients with a viable 
alternative to visible non -invasive de vices or surgical management.  
 
 
 
 
2. Objectives (include all primary and secondary objectives)  
 
Primary objective:   
Determine the effectiveness of the Schnozzle  nasal dilator compared to existing nasal dilator  products and a 
control (unaided breathing) using objective peak nasal airflow (PNIF) measurements and the Nasal 
Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) instrument.

Page 3 of 18 
  
Secondary objective:   
Determine the comfort, inconspicuousness, usability , overall patient satisfaction, device compliance, sizing, 
pricing, and other patient perception of the  nasal dilator  products .  
 
3. Background  (briefly describe  pre-clinical and clinical data, current experience with procedures, 
drug or device, and any other relevant information to justify the research ) 
 
Mechanical nasal obst ruction  is one of the most common complaints heard b y otolaryngologists 
every day [3 ]. In fact, over 73% of the population experiences continually elevated inspiratory resistance as 
a resul t of obstructed nasal airflow [4 ]. In patients seeking treatment, t he primary causes of nasal 
obstruction are chronic inflammation due to allergies (38%) and permanent s tructural abnormalities (62%) 
[9]. While the inflammatory causes of nasal obstruction are generally well controlled with topical and 
systemic pharmacother apy, the structural impedances to airflow must be treated through mechanical 
alteration of  these flow -limiting segments [10 ]. 
The most common structural pathologies that contribute to nasal obstruction are septal deviation 
 (54%) and internal nasal valve c ollapse (14%),  both of which increase resistance through the internal nasal 
valve.  The internal n asal valve is defined by the junction of the nasal septum, caudal border of the upper 
lateral cartilage, and head of the inferior turbinate; it contributes to  two-thirds of the total nasal resistance. 
[3] As per Poiseuille’s law, resistance increases as a factor of the radius to the fourth power. As such, small 
changes to the dimensions of the internal nasal valve cause an exponential change in flow. In septal -
deviation, the septum - the bon y and cartilag inous structure  that divides the nasal cavit y- is deflected, 
dislocated off the maxillary crest, or off -center, causing a reduction in cross -sectional area of the internal 
nasal valve . Valvular collapse occurs wh en the lateral nasal wall paradoxically moves medially on 
inspiration at the level of the internal valve, causing a corresponding decrease in cross -sectional area and 
increase in nasal resistance . The  cause of which can be  congenital  – from weak upper late ral cartilage or 
lack of dilator function , develop as a result of trauma, or occur post -operatively in pat ients following nasal 
surgery [8 ].  
There are a number of over -the-counter consumer products that attempt to relieve this mechanical 
nasal obstruction  in an effort to avoid surgery . One of the most popular external dilators is Breathe Right , a 
flexible strip that is adhered to the nose and stents  the lateral walls of the nose outward to prevent internal 
nasal valve collapse [8 ]. Other existing solutions  take the form of nasal cones and clips that act intra -
nasally to stent  the collapsed nasal valve. While studies show that these products are mostly effective in 
increasing nasal airflow, they are typically described as uncomfortable and carry social stigm a due to 
visibility during use, leaving their use for an extended period of time limited [11 ].  
 During the  2016 to 2017 academic year , a team of undergraduate biomedical engineering students at 
Johns Hopkins partnered with Dr. Patrick Byrne, MD, FACS, MBA , the Director of Facial Plastic and 
Reconstructive Surgery  to design and prototype a discreet silicone nasal dilator  device . A survey including 
the previously validated Nasal Obstruction Sympt om Evaluation (NOSE) instrument  and additional 
questions regard ing nasal obstruction symptoms, management options, and characteristics desirable in a 
nasal dilator device has been developed and previously approved by the Johns Hopkins IRB 
(IRB00122933).  
 Based on this data and interviews with otolaryngologists experie nced in diagnosing and treating 
nasal obstruction patients, the team developed design concepts for a mechanical nasal dilator intended to 
meet patient preferences for effectiveness, inconspicuousness, comfort, and usability. To date, the 
engineering team h as conducted testing on prototypes to verify that upon compression dilators exert a 
dilation force consistent with the range that humans find effective in relieving nasal obstruction yet 
comfortab le for extended periods of time. The team has assessed effectiveness of prototypes in improving 
nasal breathing using  a model nose developed from de -identified patient images and informed by published 
medical research. The team also used this model with a compressed air device to confirm  the stability of the 
dilato r within the nose under extreme conditions, including sneezes and peak inspiratory flow.

 The next step is to collect human data to assess Schnozzle’s effectiveness in relieving nasal obstruction and 
source patient feedback to evaluate the success of thes e prototypes in meeting key design requirements of 
comfort, in conspicuousness, and usability.  The team has conducted initial feasibility testing using the 
device and recording equipment to prepare and refine protocols for human subject testing.  
 
 
 
 
4. Study P rocedures  
a. Study design, including the sequence and timing of study procedures    
(distinguish research procedures from those that are part of routine care ). 
 
Recruitment:   
 
Participants will be recruited from patients presenting to Otolaryngology clinics wi th symptoms of nasal 
obstructi on. The o tolaryngologist in clinic will screen these patients for nasal valve collapse as they would 
in standard clinical practice. This involves  visualizing the nasal cavity through  nasal endoscopy and testing 
the nasal valve  using Cottle maneuver (applying lateral force to the cheek to open the nasal valve) or the 
modified Cottle maneuver (using a cotton tip applicator to open the nasal valve from inside the nasal 
cavity)  and evaluating for improvement in nasal obstruction sy mptoms . Improved nasal airflow  during the 
maneuver suggests nasal valve collapse  contributes to restricted nasal airflow .  
 
The clinical O tolaryngologist will counsel patients with nasal valve collapse regarding the various 
treatment options  as they would in routine clinical practice (management options include to doing nothing , 
using  existing nasal dilator devi ces, or  undergoing  surgery) . Patients will then be invited to participate in 
the study, which would involve a study session in which they are fitted  with six nasal dilator devices , 
instructed in proper care and use, and report on their function and comfort . Additional participants will be 
recruited from patients who present to Otolaryngology clinics with symptoms unrelated to nasal breathing 
to serve as a control group.  Participants will also be recruited via the clinicaltrials.gov website, as well as 
using recruitment flyers and social medial posts.  
 
Study design:   
 
If a patient expresses interest in participating they will be introduced to a member o f the research team to 
discuss the study and complete informed consent. All participation is voluntary and participants are able to 
withdraw from the study at any point. The study participant will be asked to complete a questionnaire, 
which was adapted fro m the previously approved survey ( IRB00122933),  which includes the NOSE 
instrument,  questions regarding the patient’s current treatments , and a ranking of their preferred  
characteristics of an ideal nasal dilator  (see Appendix A).  
 
Patients will then be as ked to inhale rapidly into an airflow transducer to measure baseline peak nasal 
inspiratory flow  (PNIF) . Following the pre -test survey participants will be fitted serially with five 
commercially available  nasal dilator products per manufacturer recommendat ions (Breathe Right strips, 
Max Air nose cones, Sleep Right dilator, Mute  dilator, and Nozovent dilator), and one experimental nasal 
dilator designed by the research team  (“Schnozzle”) . In this crossover design study participants will be 
blinded as to whic h dilators are brand ed and which are experimental, and t he order of fitting nas al dilators 
will be randomized.  Each subject will undergo PNIF testing for all six devices.  
 
After each fitting and use for five minutes to adjust to the device and  confirm there is no immediate 
discomfort or irritation, participants will  undergo repea t PNIF testing with each device and  then will  be free 
to go home and trial the devices  on their own . Participants will be given a schedule specifying one device 
to trial for at leas t one continuous hour per day . This schedule will specify devices in a randomized order , 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 5 of 18 
 and participants will continue to be blinded as to which device they will be using  on a particular day  
(Schnozzle, Breathe Right, Max Air, Sleep Right, Mute , and Nozov ent). The devices will be numbered in a 
random fashion, for participants to be able to identify which device via the assigned number they are 
scheduled to use  on that day . They will similarly use the device number when performing any device 
evaluation.   
 
Participants are free to wear the assigned nasal dilator at their leisure  beyond one hour , but must log the 
hours and activities performed while wearing the device (for example, “10 am-11am exercising ”). Patients 
are not required to wear a device in public a t work or during exercise unless they feel comfortable doing so. 
All devices should  be worn overnight.  When the schnozzle is utilized at night, a modified version will be 
used where each portion inserted into the nares will be connected by an external brid ge. This is to prevent 
posterior displacement of the device  during sleep . Each morning, the participant will complete a survey 
summarizing their experience using the assigned device  (Appendix B ). If there is any discomfort, irritation, 
skin breakdown, or e pistaxis the participant should stop wearing the device and contract the research team 
immediately.  
 
Over the course of the first six days since the initial clinic visit, the participant will trial an d log their use of 
each of the six  nasal dilators. After at least six days (one day per device) participants will return to the 
office for an exit interview with the study team in regards to their subjective experience with each device. 
At the en d of each trial  day they will be asked to fill out a concluding s urvey (see appendix C) . At their exit 
interview they will be asked to submit  both appendix B and C for each device they trialed.  
 
Before returning to the clinic for the conclusion of the study, participants may have several days without an 
assigned device . Participants are free to stop wearing all devices or use any devi ce as they please as long as 
it is consistent with proper care and use of the device(s).  
 
b. Study duration and number of study visits required of research participant s. 
This study requires tw o office visi ts – one to begin the study with baseline PNIF measurements , device 
fitting, PNIF with each device in place,  and a perception survey . This will be followed up with a wrap up 
visit end the study with a concluding survey . Each patient will parti cipate in the study for at least six days 
to trial each device, and the entire duration depends on an individual patients’ ability to return to the clinic, 
no more than two weeks.  
 
Participants  will be free to stop participating at any point during the stu dy. Participants will have the option 
to be included in a list of individuals who would be interested and willing in participating in additional 
study sessions.  
 
c. Blinding , including justification for blinding or not blinding the trial, if applicable.  
Patients will be blinded to the names of the devices tested to limit bias when they complete the surveys . 
They will also be blinded as to which device was designed by members of the research team .  
 
d. Justification o f why participant s will not receive routine  care or will have current therapy 
stopped.  
The standard of care is to do nothing, use existing nasal dilator d evices , or surgery. This one ses sion 
comparison study of  nasal dilators does not prevent patients from proceeding with the standard of care after 
the study session, and will familiarize them more thoroughly with available treatment options.  
 
e. Justification for inclusion of a placebo or non -treatment group.  
Participants will serially wear the prototype Schnozzle device and marketed nasal dilators, all o f which are 
treatments . We will get a baseline NOSE and PNIF score from participants without any assistive devices in 
place, which serves as the placebo/ non -treatment arm of the study. Following the study session participants 
can continue to use currently  marketed nasal dilators or proceed with planning surgery.  
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 6 of 18 
  
f. Definition of treatment failure or participant  removal criteria.  
Participants will be removed from the study if they experience substantial discomfort with the study 
devices, or if they experience  any adverse events,  such as epistaxis, or skin breakdown  or if they would like 
to discontinue testing for any reason.  
 
g. Description of what happens to participant s receiving therapy when study ends or if a 
participant ’s participation in the study end s prem aturely.  
At the end of the study session participants will be able to continue using any of the marketed  nasal dilator 
products currently on the market , and this study will not influence their ability to proceed with scheduling 
surgery if indicated and des ired. They will not be able to continue using the Schnozzle  nasal dilators at this 
time as it is still in early stage development and not widely produced  or available .  
 
5. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects will be recruited from patients who have present ed to Otolaryngology clinics with complaints of 
nasal obstruction. Specifically, patients who have been found to have nasal valve collapse by an 
Otolaryngologist based on performance of the Cottle maneuver will be invited to participate in the study.  
Addi tionally, participants will be evaluated for inclusion in the same manner if they were recruited 
utilizing flyers, social media, or discovered our study via the clinicaltrials.gov website. They will be 
excluded if after examination they are determined by t heir Otolaryngologist to be unsuitable or unsafe for 
an internal nasal dilator (e.g. history of g ranulomatosis with polyangiitis, extensive prior sinus or turbinate 
surgery altering nasal cavity anatomy , pre-existing mucosal injuries or abnormalities ). Included 
participants  will then be asked to complete the survey, NOSE questionnaire, and testing session either at 
the same visit or on another visit depending on patient and tester availability.  Additionally we will include 
a control arm whom do not have evi dence of nasal valve collapse, but are willing to participate  in the 
study. Members of the control arm will also be excluded if they are deemed unsuitable based on nasal 
anatomy and/or the above exclusion criteria listed above.  
 
6. Drugs/ Substances/ Devices  
a. The rationale for choosing the drug and dose or for choosing the device to be used.  
 
The control devices ( Breathe Right strips, Sleep Right dilator, Mute  dilator , Nozovent  dilator , and Max Air 
nose cones ) were selected from several other nasal obstruction  products available on the market based on 
discussions with patients and opinion leaders in nasal airway obstruction due to their popularity and 
reported effectiveness. These are all legally marketed in the United States as Class I 510(k) exempt medical 
devices available over -the-counter.  
 
The Schnozzle  was developed as a non -invasive, discreet alternative to the current products availabl e for 
nasal airway obstruction.  Schnozzle is still in prototype form, and this testing will influence final design 
update s to improve the dilator before full -scale manufacturing and marketing. For this testing, Schnozzle 
prototypes will be produced using an FDA approved silicone.  
 
Schnozzle  is a Class I device not requiring FDA approval prior to use in humans. It fits into t he existing 
internal nasal dilator classification as defined by Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 21, Part 874 - 
Ear, Nose, Throat Devices, Subpart D - prosthetic devices, section 874.3900. According to this definition, a 
nasal dilator “provides reli ef from temporary causes of breathing difficulties resulting from structural 
abnormalities” through a mechanism that “decreases airway resistance and increases nasal airflow”. More 
specifically, the Schnozzle  device fits into the internal nasal dilator sub category . As stated in the FDA’s 
ruling,  “the internal nasal dilator is constructed from metal or plastic and is placed inside the nostrils; it acts 
by pushing the nostrils open or by gently pressing on the columella ”. The Schnozzle  nasal dilator  fits this  
definition, being a prosthetic device placed inside the nostril with the purpose of increasing nasal airflow.

 As confirmed by Greenleaf Health, a regulatory consulting firm, Schnozzle  can be considered Class I 
device  exempt from 510(K) premarket notificat ion. 
 
b. Justification and safety information if FDA approved drugs will be administered for non -FDA 
approved indications or if doses or routes of administration or participant  populations are 
changed.   N/A

7. Study Statistics  
a. Primary outcome variable . 
Peak Nasal In spiratory Flow (PNIF) and Nasal Obstruction Symptom E xamination (NOSE) 
score for each individual before the trial and while using each tested nasal dilator.  
 
b. Secondary outcome variables . 
Comfort, appearance, ease of use, and general favorability of each de vice.  
 
c. Statistical plan including sample size justification and inte rim data analysis.  
The purpose of this pilot study is to understand patient needs and preferences regarding nasal 
dilators, and to use this data to refine the design  before potentially mar keting the product . In this 
pilot st udy we plan to test 70 individuals with nasal valve collapse.  Previous studies have 
demonstrated an ability to detect a statistically significant difference in PNIF with a power of 
80% and an alpha of 0.05 with a sample size of 30 patients with nasal valve collapse. We aim to 
recruit 70 individuals, 35 patients with nasal valve collapse, 35 patients without nasal valve 
collapse with expected attrition of 5 patients in each cohort. [12]  If we proceed to pursue 
statistical evaluation of the data we will use ANOVA with a p < 0.05 predetermined as 
significant.  
 
d. Early stopping rules.  
After 5 and 10 participants complete testing we will evaluate the data to look for themes and 
determine if further testing is likely to yield addi tional information . If a large percentage of 
patients are unable to complete the study due to complaints with device comfort or due to 
previously defined adverse outcomes we will halt the study.   
 
8. Risks  
a. Medical risks, listing all procedures, their major a nd minor risks and expected frequency.  
Application and wearing of any of the experimental or existing nasal dilators could conceivably 
lead to : 
1. Discomfort, including moderate temporary pain, or irritation, including tickling that may 
cause sneezing . Discomfort associated with wearing the devices is expected to be uncommon, 
minor, and self -limited. Participants have the option to refuse or remove any or all of the nasal 
dilator system  at any point . 
2. Epistaxis (nose bleeding), is unlikely given that pati ent with abnormal nasal mucosa are not 
included in the study. Participants will be trained and assisted by study personnel to a -
traumatically apply and remove the nasal dilator devices. Should a participant experience 
epistaxis they will be managed accordi ng to the standard of care, which would involve 
application of manual pressure to the cartilaginous portion of the nose for 20 minutes. Should 
bleeding be severe or persistent they will be seen by an Otolaryngologist for further 
management and treatment.  
3. Migration of nasal dilator device is highly unlikely given the pre -clinical testing of nasal 
dilators in a nose model under extreme conditions of high airflow that could be associated with 
sneezing  and peak inspiratory breathing . Additionally, the normal  nasal anatomy, namely the 
inferior nasal turbinate s, limit  the open space in the nose and should prevent migration of nasal 
dilators. Individuals with markedly abnormal inferior turbinates are excluded from this study.  
4. Nasal dilators may be ineffec tive at improving nasal airflow during the study.  These subjects 
will not be excluded but may leave the study.  
 
b. Steps taken to minimize the risks.  
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 9 of 18 
 Included in each risk  above.  
 
c. Plan for reporting unanticipated problems or study deviations.  
Any unanticipated pr oblems, adverse events, or study deviations will be immediately discussed 
with the principal investigator (PI) and reported to the IRB if deemed appropriate by the PI.  This 
will be done using RF3 and RF4 as needed.  
 
d. Legal risks such as the risks that would  be associated with breach of confidentiality.  
All c ollected data will be stored on an encrypted drive  password protected as per protocol. 
Patient data will be de -identified and not have a name or date of birth associated with it.  
 
e. Financial risks to the participant s. 
Participants ’ only financial risk is the opportunity cost associated with their time spent in office 
at the beginning and end of the trial.  
 
9. Benefits  
a. Description of the probable benefits  for the participant and for society . 
 
By participating in this study,  individuals with nasal valve collapse will have an opportunity 
to trial sev eral existing nasal dilators . In typical clinical practice patients are given 
recommendations for several types of nasal dilators but are not fitted and trained in 
appropriate use. Participants may notice a marked improvement in their ability to breathe 
while wearing the devices and an enhancement in quality of life.  
 
Schnozzle has the potential to improve of the quality of life for the millions of nasal 
obstruction su fferers who currently forgo treatment. Faced with the choice between inaction 
and the appointments, extensive recovery period, and uncertain outcome inherent with 
surgery, the majority of individuals —especially those with minor to moderate obstruction —
elect to live with their symptoms, which present a constant bother, source of embarrassment, 
and long -term health risk .  
 
While existing nasal dilators are effective in temporarily relieving their symptoms, sufferers 
agree that existing products are not an opt ion for use in their daily lives . However, these 
same individuals insist that a comfortable and discreet device would present a preferred 
solution to surgery to aid their breathing during the day. This trial will provide the clinical 
evidence necessary to evaluate and inform redesigns of existing prototypes to aid in the 
development of a finalized product ready for the market.  
 
10. Payment and Remuneration  
a. Detail compensation for participant s including possible total compensation, proposed 
bonus, and any propos ed reductions or penalties for not completing the protocol.  
 
Participants will not be paid, but they will be given  the option to keep any of the marketed  
nasal dilators they trialed (Breathe Right, Max Air, Sleep Right, Mute , Nozovent).  
 
11. Costs  
a. Detail costs  of study procedure(s) or drug (s) or substance(s) to participant s and identify 
who will pay for them.  
 
The cost of the nasal dilators for participants will be borne by the research  team including 
the principal investigator.

 Currently nasal airway obstruction can be managed with no intervention, the use of over the counter 
mechanical nasal dilators, or wi th surgery. We want to determine if use of these over the counter 
devices significantly improves patient symptoms. We also want to determine if different nasal 
dilator devices improve symptoms of airway obstruction to different extents.  
 
Devices we will b e examining include Breathe Right strips, Sleep Right dilator, Mute dilator, 
Nozovent dilator, and Max Air nose cones . These listed devices are commercially available over -
the-counter mechanical nasal dilators. Breathe Right strips, Nozovent, and Max Air a re approved by 
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for relief from temporary causes of breathing difficulties 
resulting from structural abnormalities . Mute and Sleep Right are registered with the FDA and fall 
under the new category that exempts nasal di lators from the FDA 510(k) approval process due to 
their low -risk characteristics.  
 
Additionally, we also want to determine if our team’s investigational design of an internal nasal 
dilator can also improve symptoms of nasal airway obstruction and if it ca n do so to a greater extent 
than the previously listed commercially available devices. As with the Mute and Sleep Right 
dilators, our team’s investigational device is exempt from FDA approval as it fulfills the definition 
of a nasal dilator and is exempt f rom the approval process.  
 
People both with and without mechanical nasal obstruction as diagnosed by an Otolaryngologist 
(Ear, Nose, & Throat doctor) may join.   
 
How many people will be in this study?  
We expect a total of 70 people to be enrolled in this s tudy.   
 
3. What will happen if you join this study?  
 
If you agree to be in this study, we will ask you to do the following things:  
 
In Office Portion  
• You will complete a baseline survey in regards to your symptoms of nasal obstruction, and 
you will then und ergo testing of your nasal airway resistance. This testing is completed by 
breathing in against an airflow measuring tool attached to a small mask worn over your 
mouth and nose. This testing will take no longer than 5 -10 minutes.  
• After baseline testing yo u will then be fit with the appropriately sized nasal dilator by our 
team. You will be fit with 6 total devices: 5 commercially available devices and 1 
investigational device.  
• You will be blinded to the name of each device and as to which device is our in vestigational 
device. This means that you will not know which device you are being fit with or using. We 
do this so that your evaluation of each device is not biased in any way.  
• After we have fit you with the correctly sized device, we will repeat testing  of your nasal 
airway resistance with each device in place.  
• We estimate the fitting period and repeat nasal airway resistance tests with the device in 
place will take about 20 minutes. Therefore the total length of your clinic visit would be 
increased by   about 30 minutes total.  
 
At Home Portion  
• You will then be instructed to take the 6 nasal dilator devices home and begin using each 
device as instructed. Specifically, you will be assigned to use each device in a randomized 
order (like drawing numbers out  of a hat that correspond to the order you should use a 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 14 of 18 
 device in) and asked to wear each device for at least one hour continuously while you are 
awake.  
• You will be asked to document what activities you were doing while wearing the device and 
for how long . 
• You will then be asked to wear the same device overnight. Following your overnight trial 
with the device you will be asked to fill out a survey about your experience with that device. 
We will then ask you to do the same for the 5 other devices over the 5  following days.  
• As there are 6 devices this at home portion of the study will take 6 days: 1 daytime and 1 
overnight trial period for each device.  
 
In Office Debriefing  
• After evaluating all the devices you will be asked to come back in for an additional office 
visit where we will ask you questions about your experience with each device and you will 
be asked to fill out a survey ranking the device from your most favorite to least favorite. 
You will also be asked to hand in your surveys and other documentat ion you completed at 
home for each device at this time.  
• You will be able to keep any of the commercially available devices if you wish to continue 
to use them. You will not be able to keep or continue using our investigational device.  
 
How long will you be in the study?  
The entire study encompasses 2 in office visits and a 6 day at home trial period.  
 
4. What are the risks or discomforts of the study?  
 
Risks of joining the study  
• There are minimal risks of joining the study as using these mechanical nasal di lator devices 
is currently an accepted standard of care for mechanical nasal obstruction. Additionally your 
participation will not prevent you from pursuing the other potential management option of 
surgery at a later date.  
 
Risks with device use  
• The risks  with device use are minimal and all unlikely . They include the following:  
o Skin irritation or breakdown around where the device is inserted or placed on the 
nose 
o Nose bleeding.  
o Device becoming lodged within the nasal cavity requiring removal by your docto r. 
 
If you have any of the above outcomes you will be asked to immediately stop using the 
device(s) and contact Drs. Rowan , Papel and/or Kontis for in -office evaluation. Management 
of each of these potential risks will be on a case -by-case basis based on t hat examination. 
Interventions required or needed may range from nothing and just discontinuation from the 
study, to application of topical ointment (in the case of skin breakdown), to, in the very rare 
and unexpected case of nose bleeds that do not stop o n their own, use of topical thrombotic 
agents (agents that make your blood clot).  
 
 Other Risks:  
You may get tired or bored when we are asking you questions or you are completing questionnaires. 
You do not have to answer any question you do not want to an swer. You may also get tired of using 
the different device, and/or of documenting your use and experience with each one. If at any point 
 
 
JHMIRB eF ormA   01 
Version 3 Dated:   06/2007   
Page 15 of 18 
 you feel this way you may stop documenting or using the devices and leave the trial without any 
consequence.  
 
 
Risks t o Confidentiality Loss:  
There is the risk that information about you may become known to people outside this study. We 
will not be collecting any personal information from you other than the measurements of your nasal 
airway resistance. As such, there is v ery minimal risk of a loss of confidentiality of your personal 
information.  
 
5. Are there benefits to being in the study?  
There is no direct benefit to you from being in the study. If you take part in this study, you may help 
others in the future. We will be  able to understand if mechanical nasal dilators are a reasonable 
alternative to surgery for patients with nasal airway obstruction.  
 
6. What are your options if you do not want to be in the study?  
If you decide not to join this study, other options are avai lable.  You do not have to join this study to 
get treatment.  Other  treatments  include  surgery to correct nasal airway obstruction or no 
intervention at all.  
 
You do not have to join this study.  If you do not join, your care at Johns Hopkins will not be 
affected.  
 
7. Will it cost you anything to be in this study?    
 
You will receive a separate Insurance and Research Participant Financial Responsibility 
Information Sheet (Sheet).  
 
This Sheet will give you the following information:  
 
• The procedures, tests, dr ugs or devices that are part of this research and that will be paid for 
by the study (no cost to you).   
 
• The procedures, tests, drugs or devices that will be billed to you and/or your health insurer.  
If you have health insurance, you will be responsible for any co -pays or deductibles not 
covered by your insurance.  
 
8. Will you be paid if you join this study?  
 
No. However,  you will be able to keep and use any of the commercially available nasal dilators.  
 
9. Can you leave the study early?  
• You can agree to be in the study now and change your mind later.  
• If you wish to stop, please tell us right away.  
• Leaving this study early will not stop you from getting regular medical care .

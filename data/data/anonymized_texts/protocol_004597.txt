 A MULTICENTER, RANDO MIZED, DOUBLE -BLIND, PLACEBO -CONTROLLED 
STUDY EVALUATING THE  EFFICACY AND SAFETY OF MLD10 IN T HE 
PREVENTION OF MIGRAINE HEADACHE IN ADULT S 
 
INDICATION 
For the prophylaxis of migraine headaches in adults 
 
STUDY PURPOSE  
• To evaluate the daily use of MLD10 and placebo for the treatment of migraine, as 
measured by the change from baseline in the number of migraine headache days of subjects treated for 3 months. 
• To compare daily use of MLD10 and placebo as measured by: 
- change in the quantitative and qualitative aspects of migraine headaches from baseline, during treatment, and at the conclusion of a
 3-month treatment period. 
- safety and tolerability measures in migraine headache subjects through the monitoring of adverse events (AEs) and clinical chemistry values.  
 SUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN  
This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, multi- center study.  Subjects agreeing to 
participate in the study and meet the entry criteria assessed at the screening visit, will begin a 28 day baseline period to confirm their diagnosis, as well as establish baseline migraine characteristics.  During this baseline period, subjects will continue treating their migraines as usual, simply recording the information in a daily headache diary.  Subjects who, after completing the baseline, continue to me et entrance criteria will be eligible to enter into the 
treatment phase and be randomized according to the Clinvest generated randomization schedule.  Approximately 142 subjects (71 subjects per arm) will be randomized and enter the treatment phase receivi ng MLD10 or placebo in a 1:1 design at a maximum of 8 US sites.  Diary 
assessments will collect study medication adherence, pain severity, headache symptoms, acute medication usage, and unusual symptoms. Serum samples will be collected and analyzed for ionized Mg, electrolytes, and creatinine.  
 The study consists of 5 visits: Baseline Period:  Visit 1 (Screening/Baseline Period)  
Treatment Period:  Visit 2 (Randomization/Treatment Period Month 1) 
 Visit 3 (Treatment Period Month 2)  
 Visit 4 (Treatment Period Month 3) 
 Visit 5 (Final Visit)  
 
POPULATION SAMPLE  
Subjects in the study are those: 
• who have at least a 3 month history of 3-14 migraines, with or without aura, as 
defined by International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD) - 3 beta 
(Appendix 1) or treat with a ergot or triptan and received relief.  
• who received a diagnosis of migraine before age 50. 
• who have used acute headache medication 14 or fewer days per month in the previous 3 months. 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16

 STUDY MEDICATION 
Subjects will receive Investigational Drug Product MLD10 as follows: 2 MLD10 caplets, oral, 
twice daily or placebo caplets as follows: 2 placebo caplets, oral, twice daily.  
 
BACKGROUND & STUDY RATIONALE  
Magnesium is frequently used in the treatment and prevention of migraine, though there are relatively few clinical trials supporting its efficacy.  While there is a sound scientific rationale for magnesium as a migraine preventative, different forms of magnesium differ significantly in their solubility and bioavailability.  In addition, there are challenges in measuring bioactive magnesium levels in the body.  Consequently, a discussion of the efficacy of magnesium needs to be specific to the formulation of magnesium being studied, its ability to be adequately absorbed, and phy siologically active.  
 Magnesium is recognized to block the N- methyl -D-aspartate ion -dependent channel.  Low levels 
of magnesium increase the sensitivity of the NMDA receptor to glutamate.  Glutamate is an excitatory neurotransmitter and is considered central to the development of cortical spreading depression.  In addition, glutamate is considered to play an excitatory role in the hyper- vigilant 
migraine nervous system.  Thus, magnesium properly utilized physiologically has significant potential to protect the nervous system from migraine. 
 
PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
To compare the change from baseline to treatment period months 1, 2, and 3 in the 
number of migraine headache days of subjects treated with MLD10 versus placebo.   
SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
To compare change from baseline of subjects treated with MLD10 versus placebo on the following parameters during a 3 month treatment period: 
• the number of headache days 
• the average headache duration  
• pain severity at headache onset 
• the use of acute medications 
• Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) scores  
• Subject Global Impression of Change (SGIC) 
• Physician Global Impression of Change (PGIC) 
 
EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES  
To compare the change from baseline of subjects treating with MLD10 versus placebo on the following parameters during a 3 month treatment period. 
• migraine with aura days  
• serum ionized magnesium  
 SAFETY OBJECTIVES  
Safety assessments will include monitoring the parameters during the length of the study.  
• adverse events  
• physical examination  
• urine pregnancy tests for all females of childbearing potential  
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
8 
 • vital signs including blood pressure, pulse rate, and weight 
• Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
• concomitant medications  
• clinical chemistry measurements  
 
SUBJECT SELECTION  
Approximately 142 subjects will be randomized from the clinic and general population with a 
history of mild to severe migraine, with or without aura, that meets the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD -3 beta) definition for episodic migraine with a 
frequen cy of 3 -14 days of migraine (or headache treated with migraine specific medication) per 
month.  Subjects will have a stable history of headaches meeting the above parameters for at least 3 months prior to enrollment.  Subjects on migraine preventative medi cations will be 
required to be on a stable regimen for 30 days prior to and throughout the study period.   
POWER ANALYSIS  
A power analysis, using GPower Version 3.1.7, indicated a total sample size of 128 subjects 
would be needed to detect medium effects ( d = .25) with 80% power using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) test to include fixed effects, main effects, and interactions with alpha being .05.  Given an estimated 10% early termination rate, a total estimated sample size of 142 subjects is needed.

 STUDY MEDICATION RANDOMIZATION  
Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive magnesium L -lactate dehydrate (243 mg of 
elemental mg++ BID for a total of 486mg daily) or placebo at Visit 2.  If at any time during the 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
13 
 study the subject withdrawals from the study, they will be instruc ted to return all used packaging 
and unused medication.   
Group A  
Subjects randomized to MLD10 (Group A) will be dispensed a 28 day supply of 
magnesium L -lactate dehydrate 10 mEq (121.5 mg of elemental mg++ caplets) for 
daily treatment.  A total of 120 caplets will be given each time at Visit 2, 3, and 4.  Additional overage will be given to account for the 3 day window.  Subjects will be instructed to take two caplets of study medication BID at about the same time each day (i.e. 8AM & 8PM for a total of 486mg’s of elemental mg++ per day).  Subjects will be instructed regarding storage requirements and will be asked to return all used/partially used/unused medication containers at the next office visit.   
Group B  
Subjects randomized to placebo (Group B) will be dispensed a 28 day supply of 
matching placebo for daily treatment.  A total of 120 caplets will be given each time at Visit 2, 3, and 4.  Additional overage will be given to account for the 3 day window.  Subjects will be instructed to take two caplets  of study medication BID at about the 
same time each day (i.e. 8AM & 8PM).  Subjects will be instructed regarding storage requirements and will be asked to return all used/partially used/unused medication containers at the next office visit.  
 
RESCUE MEDICATION 
Subjects will be instructed they may take their investigator approved rescue medications for 
headaches, if needed.  Rescue medication usage and dosage will be recorded on the headache diary.  
 CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Therapy considered necessary for the subject’s welfare may be given at the discretion of the 
investigator. Concomitant medication usage and dosage will be recorded on the concomitant medication form.  
 Routine medications, including migraine preventative medications, should be maintained on a stable dose and regimen for the duration of the study period.  Additionally, any concomitant chronic therapies should be maintained at a stable dose and dose regimen during the study. 
 
 Allowed Medications  
1. All acute migraine medications currently taken by subject at Visit 1 will be 
allowed during the study. 
2. All migraine preventative medications, excluding magnesium, that are currently 
taken by subject at Visit 1 will be allowed if on a stable dose for at least 30 days 
prior to Visit 1 and subject agrees to continue at that dose throughout the study.   
 Prohibited Medications  
Any medication containing magnesium 30 days prior to screening.  
 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
14 
 HEADACHE DIARY 
The primary and much of the secondary endpoints will be derived from the electronic dail y 
headache diary.  Site personnel will be responsible for instructing subjects on the requirement for 
timely and daily completion of the electronic diary.  Each day, the subject will be asked to record diary data for the previous day (24 hour period).  If a subject does not experience a headache in the previous 24 hour period, the diary must still be completed and recorded as no headache.  Subject’s diaries may vary day to day based on their responses.  Subjects will be asked to document all headaches exper ienced regardless of severity for one month.  All subjects should 
have at least 80% compliance with diary completion throughout the length of the study.  Subjects will record headache severity, symptoms, use of acute medications, as well as additional questions as required.  Headache severity will be subjectively rated by the subject as follows: no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, or severe pain.  These ratings will be collected at pre- defined 
time points.       
 UNSCHEDULED VISITS  
If a subject has an unscheduled visit, the unscheduled visit form must be completed.  If the visit occurs for safety reasons, all relevant safety data should be captured and reported on the appropriate forms.  If the unscheduled visit results in an early termination, all applicable final study visit procedures will be performed and the early termination form will need to be completed as well.  
 
BLINDING/UNBLINDING  
At randomization (Visit 2), neither the subject nor the investigator will be aware to which 
treatment group the subject has been assigned.  If needed, for safety and proper treatment of the subject, the investigator can unblind the subject’s treatment assi gnment to determine which 
treatment has been assigned and institute appropriate follow-up care.  When possible, Clinvest should be notified prior to unblinding study medication.     Individual unblinding envelopes are shipped with study medication.  Each s tudy medication kit 
has a corresponding unblinding envelope.  Unblinding will include matching the kit and unblinding envelope with the subject drug number.  To unblind a subject without breaking the blind for remaining subjects’ treatment the following instructions described below will be followed: 
 
• Obtain the security envelope containing the unblinding envelopes. 
• Remove the unblinding envelope with the study drug number corresponding with the study medication kit dispensed to the subject. 
• Break the seal o f the unblinding envelope and remove the subjects’ treatment label. 
• Return the subjects’ treatment label to the unblinding envelope. 
• Return the unblinding envelope to the security envelope. 
• Document on the unblinding form located in the eAdmin Binder.  
• Email copy of unblinding form to study@clinvest.com within 24 hours of unblinding. 
• Complete and email or fax the Sterling IRB, unanticipated problem report form, to Sterling IRB within 10 business days of unblinding.

 DISCONTINUATION/WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY 
All subjects who withdraw from the study, for any reason, must return all study medication and 
supplies to the investigator or his/her delegate at the first available opportunity.   Subjects may withdraw at any time or be dropped from the study at the discretion of the investigator or Clinvest if he/she violates the study plan or for administrative and/or safety reasons.  When a subject discontinues/withdraws prior to study completion, all applicable activities scheduled for the final study visit should be performed at the time of discontinuation, as well as the completion of the early termination form and unscheduled visit form (if appropriate).  Any adverse experiences which are present at the time of discontinuation/withdrawal should be followed in accor dance with the safety requirements 
outlined in the adverse event reporting section of this protocol.   
 
REPORTING PREGNANCY  
Although not considered an adverse event, if a female of childbearing potential becomes pregnant during the study, the investigator will notify Clinvest and Pharmalyte Solutions LLC by phone immediately after the pregnancy is confirmed.  The subject will not receive any further treatment and will be withdrawn from the study.  The subject should be followed for 12 weeks after the last study treatment and at least 6 -8 weeks following the report of pregnancy, before 
being exited from the study.  The investigator will (1) notify the subject’s physician that the subject was being treated with an investigational drug MLD10 and (2 ) follow the progress of the 
pregnancy until delivery.  The investigator should document the outcome of the pregnancy and provide a copy of the documentation to Clinvest.  
REPORTING ADVERSE EVENTS  
The investigator will be responsible for the detection, collection, and evaluation of all events 
meeting the definition of an adverse event (AE).  An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study product.  An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the study product, whether or not related to the study product.    An adverse event observed after the initial dose of the study product will be considered a “treatment -emergent adverse event”.  Treatment -emergent adverse events will be analyzed and 
discussed in the clinical study rep ort for this study.  Adverse event terms should include a 
diagnosis, as available, in preference to the listing of individual signs and symptoms.  If a diagnosis is not possible, each sign and symptom should be recorded as an individual adverse event.    All adverse events, whether or not related to the study drug, must be completely documented on the appropriate adverse event eCRF (electronic case report form) page.  If a subject is withdrawn from the study due to an adverse event, this must also be recorded on the appropriate eCRF pages.    The site staff must record all directly observed AEs and all spontaneously reported AEs.  At each visit, the site staff will ask the subject a non -specific question (e.g., “Have you noticed any 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
16 
 change in your health since your last visit?”) to assess AE occurrence since the last report or 
visit.   
 
Non-Serious Adverse Event (NSAE)  
NSAE’s will be collected beginning after the first dose of study medication or within 14 days following cessation of treatment and will includ e any change from the subject’s 
condition at Visit 2.  These include physical findings, clinical signs and symptoms, or sequelae.  Any worsening (i.e. any clinically significant adverse change in the frequency and/or intensity) of a preexisting condition w hich is temporally associated with the use of 
the provided product, is also considered to be an adverse event.  Events such as medical/surgical procedures or anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre- existing 
conditions present at screening that do not worsen are not considered NSAE’s.  All NSAE’s noted will be captured on the non-serious adverse events eCRF.  Information captured will include start date/time, end date/time, severity, relationship of causality to study drug, course of action taken, and out come.  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurring after signing of the informed 
consent and until cessation of the study which: 
1. results in death. 2. is life threatening (Note: The term “life -threatening” in the defin ition of 
“serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.).  
3. requires subject hospitalization or prolonga tion of existing hospitalization.  
4. results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; or a congenital 
anomaly/birth defect. 
 Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition  above.  These should also be considered serious. 
SAE’s will be reported in compliance with all applicable safety reporting requirements as set forth in the Code of Federal Regulations.  SAE’s assessed as life threatening or death “possibly related to the study medication” will be reported to Clinvest, Pharmalyte Solutions LLC, and Sterling IRB within 24 hours of knowledge of the event by study staff.  All other SAE’s (such as hospitalization, disability, congenital anomaly, and an important medical event) will be reported to Clinvest, Pharmalyte Solutions, and Sterling 
IRB within 48 hours of knowledge of the event by study staff.  A MedWatch Form FDA 3500A will also be completed and forwarded to Pharmalyte Solutions LLC and Clinvest.    Included in the SAE Report Form will be an assessment of the causal relationship between the Pharmalyte Solutions LLC Materials and the SAE.  SAE’s will be followed 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
17 
 by study staff until the event(s) have returned to normal, stabilized, or have been 
otherwise explained, for at least 2 weeks following the last dose of study drug. If the investigator learns of any SAEs after a subject has been discharged from the study and he/she considers the event reasonably related to the investigational product, the investigator will notify C linvest and Pharmalyte Solutions LLC. 
 
CLINICAL SUPPLIES  
Clinical supplies will be packaged for subjects in accordance to an allocation schedule generated by Clinvest.    
LABORATORY ANALYSIS  
Laboratory specimens for the serum ionized magnesium test will be  shipped to the Center for 
Biomedical and Life Sciences for analysis.  Laboratory specimens for the serum electrolytes and 
creatinine will be sent to the sites local laboratories for analysis. The collection, storage, shipping, and processing of the specimens will be documented. 
 
STORAGE REQUIREMENTS  
The study medication and clinical supplies must be received by a designated person at the study site, handled and stored safely and properly, and kept in a secured location to which only the investigator and de signated assistants have access.  Clinical supplies and medications are to be 
dispensed only as defined in the protocol.  It is the investigator’s responsibility to keep accurate records of the supplies received, the amount dispensed to and returned by subjects, and the remaining amount at the end of the study.  Study staff should not open individual study medication containers prior to dispensing to the subject.    Study medication received from the Sponsor will be inventoried and accounted for throughout the study.  Drug Accountability will be maintained for subjects randomized in the study.  Study staff will record the amount of study medication dispensed and amount returned at each appropriate office visit.  Any missing caplets or discrepancies will be a ddressed and reconciled 
as needed.  
 Study medication should be kept in a secure location and stored according to the package insert.     The study medication storage area at the site must be monitored by the site staff for temperature consistency with the acceptable storage temperature range specified on study medication temperature log.  Documentation of temperature monitoring should be maintained.    
CONFIDENTIALITY 
By signing this protocol, the investigator affirms to Clinvest information furnished to the 
investigator by Clinvest will be maintained in confidence.  Likewise, data generated by this study will be considered confidential by the investigator, with the exc eption of information included in 
a publication.    The investigator also agrees that Clinvest, Institutional Review Board (IRB), or Regulatory Agency representatives may consult and/or copy study documents in order to verify data.  By signing the consent form, the subject agrees to this process.  If study documents will be 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
18 
 photocopied during the process of verifying information, the subject will be identified by a 
unique subject number only.  Full names will be masked prior to transmission to Clinvest.   Signing of this protocol also means the investigator agrees to treat all subject data used and 
disclosed in connection with this study in accordance will all applicable privacy laws, rules and regulations, including applicable provisions of Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA).   
 
COMPLIANCE WITH LAW, AUDIT, AND DEBARMENT  
By signing the protocol, the investigator agrees to conduct the study in a diligent manner and in 
conformance with the protocol, standards of the Declaration of Helsinki under its most recent amendment and including Good Clinical Practice (GCP) according to the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, and all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules and regulations relating to the conduct of the clinical study.   
 Prior to trial initiation, the investigator at each site will provide Clinvest a fully executed and signed Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Form 1572 and curriculum vitae (CV).  The investigator also agrees to allow monitoring, audits, IRB review, and regulatory agency inspection of trial-related documents and procedures.  Centralized monitoring will be performed to verify accuracy of data entered into the electronic data capture system (EDC).   
 Additionally, the investigator agrees not to seek reimbursement from subjects, their insurance providers, or from government programs for procedures included as part of the study that are reimbursed by Clinvest.    Persons debarred from conducting or working on clinical studies by any court or regulatory agency will not be allowed to conduct or work on Clinvest studies.  The investigator will immediately disclose in writing to Clinvest if any person who is involved in study conduct is debarred, or if any proceeding for debarment is pending or threatened.   
 QUALITY CONTROL/ASSURANCE  
It is Clinvest’s responsibility for implementing and maintaining quality control and assurance with written SOPs to ensure the trial is conducted in compliance with GCP standards and all applicable federal, state, and local laws, rules, and regulations.  Appropriate tools will be 
provided to the site to facilitate quality management of the subject and continuity through the trial.   
 Quality control should be applied by all parties and to each stage of subject manag ement, 
investigational product management and data handling to ensure all data are reliable and have been processed correctly.  All clinical data are to be generated and processed by personnel with relevant clinical and GCP knowledge.  Subject generated data should be preceded with appropriate subject training and technical support for questions that arise during the trial.     Agreements, made by the sponsor, or their designee, with the investigator, institution and/or with any other parties involved with clinical trial should be in writing in a separate agreement.  
 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
19 
 Pharmalyte Solutions LLC has transferred trial -related duties and functions to Clinvest, but 
ultimate responsibility for the quality and integrity of the trial data resides with Pharmalyte 
Solutions LLC.  The investigator agrees to be responsible for the integrity of all study conduct at their site.   
 During the trial Clinvest will conduct remote monitoring and safety oversight periodically.  The clinical monitors may review eCRFs, central labor atory findings, etc. at intervals throughout the 
study to verify appropriate inclusion of subjects, adherence to the protocol, and completeness, correctness, and accuracy of eCRF entries.  Any source upload should be reviewed for privacy elements and remov ed.  Source uploads should only include the subject enrollment number as 
identifying information.  
 The study will be registered on www.clinicaltrials.gov
 by Clinvest.  
   
STUDY DOCUMENTATION  
Data for this trial will be primarily collected in a web -based electronic data capture (EDC) 
REDCap platform.  The EDC access will be supplied by Clinvest with relevant training support 
to sites.  Sites will be responsible for training study subjects in the EDC system.  All data specified should be captured by the site personnel or subjects in the EDC system.  All eCRFs are to be completely filled out by personnel administering the study procedures at the time of the visit.  The eCRF will be considered the source document for all data collected other than laboratory and procedure findings, which will be uploaded into the eCRF as source.  All data must be reviewed and signed by the investigator or sub-investigator at the conclusion of the study for each subject.  The eCRFs should not be made available in any form to third parties, without written permission from the sponsor.    It is the investigator’s responsibility for the collection and reporting of all clinical, safety, and laboratory data entered on the eCRF and confirmation the data is accurate, authentic, attributable, complete, and consistent.  The investigator or sub- investigator must sign the eCRFs within the 
EDC system to attest the information contained with the eCRF is true and causality of any saf ety 
information has been assessed.    
RECORD RETENTION 
Study documentation includes all workbooks, worksheets, forms, lab reports, logs, signature 
pages, appointment schedules, investigator correspondence, electronic data (i.e. data stored on cds, flash drives, etc.), and regulatory documents.  The original recording of an observation should be retained as the source document.

INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD 
Clinvest is responsible for obtaining IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent document, 
written information provided to the subject, recruiting material, and all other appropriate documents.  The trial will not be initiated until IRB approval of all trial documents.  The investigator will provide Pharmalyte Solutions LLC with documentation that the IRB has approved the protocol, informed consent, and any study-related materials to be provided to the subject before the study begins.  In the event an amendment is needed to any document, Clinvest will also be responsible for the approval of all subsequent major changes.  The investigator is responsible for obtaining initial and continuing review (annually if necessary) of the study by an IRB.  Written ap proval must be forwarded to Clinvest before clinical supplies will be shipped.  
For continuing studies, written approval from the IRB must be sent to Clinvest at intervals not to exceed 1 year.  All other appropriate reports on the progress of the study wi ll be made to the IRB 
and the Sponsor by Clinvest in accordance with applicable governmental regulations and in agreement with the policy established by the Sponsor and the IRB.    
TRAINING  
Each approved study site will participate in a protocol training program prior to enrollment of 
any subjects in the study.  The program must be attended by the principal investigator at the site, and at least one research coordinator, including the coordinator who will have the lead responsibility for coordination of the study at the site.  
 Comprehensive training will be provided by Clinvest to site personnel.  Training topics will include protocol, study design, study documents, electronic data capture system, reporting of AEs and pregnancy, and any other study related tasks.   
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
21 
 SAFETY MEASURES  
 
Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs) will be monitored throughout the study. All reported AEs 
will be documented on the appropriate eCRF. 
 
Physical Examination 
At screening and study exit, the investigator will examine the patient for any 
detectable abnormalities of the following body systems: general appearance; neck (including thyroid); head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat; lungs; heart/cardiovascular; abdomen; neurologic; extremities; back; musculoskeletal; lymphatic; skin; and other. The neurologic examination should be conducted to detect the presence of any significant sensory/motor abnormalities. A digital rectal examination is not required. Gynecological examinations are not required.  
 
Weight should be measured at screening, day 1, and each subsequent office visit using the same scale for all patients at a given investigator site when possible.  
 
Pregnancy tests for all females of childbearing potential.  Urine pregnancy testing will be conducted at screening, on day 1, and each subsequent office visit to confirm continued non-pregnant status prior to study drug administration or study completion.  
 
Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples will be collected for clinical laboratory testing at Visits 2 -5 for all 
patients qualifying f or randomization.  Non-fasting blood samples (approximately 
10 mL for Electrolytes, Creatinine, and Ionized Magnesium) should be collected using standard laboratory instructions and procedures provided by the laboratories.   
 
Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured at screening, day 1, and each subsequent office visit. 
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse rate over 30 seconds should be taken after patients have been at rest (seated) for at least 2 minutes. Blood pressure should be recorded in mmHg. Pulse rate should be measured in beats per minutes.  
 
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C -SSRS)  
The C -SSRS will be conducted at the screening visit and each subsequent office 
visit.  The C- SSRS is a semi -structured interview designed to assess t he severity 
and intensity of suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and non- suicidal self -
injurious behavior over a specified time period (e.g., prior year, since last visit). The measurement of suicidal ideation is based on 5 “yes” or “no” questions (plus a description if answered “yes”) arranged in order of increasing severity. If the patient answers “yes” to either question 1 or 2, the intensity of ideation will then be assessed in 5 additional questions relating to the frequency, duration, 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
22 
 controllabilit y, deterrents, and reasons for the most severe ideation. Suicidal 
behavior is then assessed by asking further questions to categorize the behaviors 
into actual, aborted, and interrupted attempts; preparatory behavior; and non-suicidal self -injurious behavior. The interview is used in full only if the initial 
questions are positive; this assessment is completed at all scheduled clinic visits at which other clinical assessments are to be carried out.   
  
If any item(s) on the C -SSRS are answered with “yes”, a clinician 
investigator must review patient’s responses in order to:  
a) at screening and baseline determine patient’s study eligibility and potential need for referral to a mental health professional AND  
b) during the study evaluate patient’s need for appropriate medical management such as referral to a mental health professional.  
 
A significant risk of suicide is defined as a “yes” in answer to:  
a) questions 4 or 5 on the suicidal ideation section; OR b) any questions on any item in the suicidal behavior section.  
This must be reported as a serious adverse event and followed up accordingly.  Additionally, if a patient responds “yes” to any of the suicidal ideation questions 1 to 3, a clinician investigator should apply clinical judgment to determi ne the need 
for reporting as an adverse event or serious adverse event and the need for any referral.  
 SUMMARY OF METHODS OF DATA COLLECTION  
Data required for the evaluation of the primary and some secondary measures will be recorded by subjects using a daily e -diary.  The following data will be collected daily with the e -diary 
(subject instructions and training for completion of the e-diary will be provided): 
• Estimated total duration of headache that day (if no headache, subject will report 0 hours) 
• Severity of headache at the time of onset (mild, moderate, or severe) only for subjects who report a headache duration > 0)  
• Acute headache pain medication(s) usage  
• Study medication usage 
• Unusual symptoms 
 
Should a subject skip a day of e- diary entry, the subject will be able to provide the missing 
information for up to 1 calendar day.  The e-dairy should not be completed on the day of the office visit; the last e -dairy entry for the preceding period should be completed the day prior to 
the office visit.   
Questionnaire data required to be directly collected from subject will be obtained at each appropriate visit using an electronic device as defined in the protocol.  Questionnaires are to be completed by the subject and the answers to the questions on the questionnaires should come from the subject directly, not from family, friends, or the study support personnel.    
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
23 
 Questionnaire data required to be collected directly from clinicians will be obtained at the 
appropriate visit and recorded in the eCRF per protocol.   
 
STATISTI CAL ANALYSIS  
Subjects will be randomized 1:1 into the treatment groups.  Randomization will not include any type of stratification.    An alpha of .05 will be used for statistical significance. All statistical tests will be two -sided.  All 
data will be analyzed using JMP (SAS Institute, Inc.).    Descriptive statistics will establish baseline characteristics and adverse event frequency.  Data for the primary endpoint will be statistically  analyzed via a repeated measures ANCOVA 
controlling for ionized serum Mg levels.  Data for each of the secondary outcome measures will be statistically analyzed for both within and between group changes via a 2- tailed Repeated 
Measures ANOVA and/or independent or dependent t- tests as appropriate.  All ANOVAs will be 
followed by univariate post- hoc tests as appropriate. Multiple comparison adjustments will be 
made if needed.  
 An interim analysis will be performed when approximately 60 subjects have completed the study.  The results of the interim analysis may lead to stopping the study for safety or futility.  The interim analysis will not lead to stopping the study for efficacy.  Only the primary endpoint and first secondary endpoint of migraine and headache day reduction will be assessed at the time of the interim analysis, as well as adverse events for safety purposes.     
 Modified Intent -to-Treat Population (mITT) 
The modified intent- to-treat (mITT) population will include all randomized subjects who 
received at least one dose of study drug and obtained at least one endpoint measurement 
(mean change from baseline in the number of hours with headaches) after treating.  The mITT population will be used for efficacy analyses. 
 
 Safety Population 
The safety p opulation will include all randomized subjects who received at least one dose 
of study drug (active or placebo).  
 
A last observation carried forward (LOCF) method will be utilized to impute missing values for 
subjects continuing in the study, but missing values for this analysis.  This type of imputation replaces the missing value with the last observation value obtained.  Baseline observation carried forward (BOCF) method will be used if a subject discontinues the study.  Thus, if a subject has a missing value at month 2 due to discontinuation, the baseline value will be utilized and the subject will be considered a non-responder.   
 
PRIMARY ENDPOINT  
To compare the mean change from baseline in the frequency of migraine headache days per 28 -
day period ending with the cessation of treatment period month 3 in subjects treated with MLD10 versus placebo.  
 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
24 
 A migraine headache day will be defined as a calendar day (00:00 to 23:59) with 4 or more hours 
of migraine headache, fulfilling ICHD- 3 beta criteria, and/or any headache of any duration with 
the use of migraine- specific acute medications(s) (i.e. ergot alkaloids, ergot co mbinations, 
opioids, triptans, combination analgesics [simple analgesics combined with opioids or barbiturate with or without caffeine]).   
SECONDARY ENDPOINTS  
1. To compare change from baseline of subjects treated with MLD10 versus placebo on 
the following parameters during or after a 3 month treatment period: 
• the frequency of headache days  
• the average headache duration after 1, 2, and 3 months of treatment 
• reduction of pain severity at the time of headache onset  
• the use of acute medications after 1, 2, and 3 months of treatment 
• Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) scores at Visits 2 and 5  
• Subject Global Impression of Change (SGIC) at Visit 5  
• Physician Global Impression of Change (PGIC) at Visit 5 
2. To assess the safety and tolerability of magnesium -L-lacate- dihydrate versus placebo 
in migraine headache subjects through the comparison of adverse events. 
 
EXPLORATORY ENDPOINTS  
To compare the change from baseline of subjects treating with MLD10 versus placebo on the following parameters during a 3 month treatment period.  
• migraine with aura days  
• serum ionized magnesium 
 
SAFETY ENDPOINTS  
Safety assessments will include:  
• adverse events  
 COLLECTION AND DERIVATION OF ENDPOINTS  
Data required for the evaluation of endpoints will be recorded for the duration of the study using 
electronic data capture and included subject and clinician reported outcomes.   Following visit 2, subsequent visits will occur every 28 days for 3 months.  However, in practice, there may or may not be an exact 28 -day duration between 2 consecutive visits.  For data 
analysis purposes, the number of migraine headache days during the first 28 continuous days of the run- in period will serve at the “baseline” for  calculating change from baseline for 28 -day 
periods subsequent to each office visit.  If the run- in period (starting with the screening visit and 
preceding the day before visit 2) exceeds 28 days, the run- in period will include the last 28 -days.  
In order to be randomized, a subject must meet 80% diary completion compliance (22 days recorded unless otherwise approved by the Sponsor and/or Clinvest).   
Primary Efficacy Variable 
The primary efficacy variable is the mean change from baseline in the frequency of 
migraine headache days per 28 -day period ending with the cessation of treatment period 
month 3 in subjects treated with MLD10 versus placebo. This variable is derived from 
1/2/15, Revised 4/20/16  
25 
 the e-dairy.  It is based on the count of days with migraine headaches, fulfilling ICHD -3 
beta criteria, and/or headaches of any duration with the use of migraine- specific acute 
headache medication(s).  The primary time point is treatment month 3, encompassing the 
last 28 -day period before study end.   
 
 Secondary Efficacy Variables 
• Change from baseline in the frequency of headache days per 28 -day period.  
This variable will be derived from daily e-diary reports.  It will be based on 
the count of days with headaches.  
• Change from baseline in the total cumulative hours of headache per 28- day 
period.  This variable will be derived from daily e- diary reports.  It will be 
based on the sum of total headache duration for days with any headache.   
• Change from baseline in the average pain severity at time of onset compared to each 28 -day period.  This variable will be derived from the daily e -diary 
reports.   
• Reduction from baseline in the total number of acute headache pain medications used.  This variable will be derived from the daily e-diary reports.  
• Change from baseline in the total MIDAS score.  This variable will be derived from the subject questionnaire. 
• SGIC score at the end of treatment.  This variable will be derived from the subject questionnaire. 
• PGIC score at the end of treatment.  This variable will be derived from the clinician re ports.

 APPENDIX II  
Proposed Revised International Headache Society  
Criteria for Medication -Overuse Headache  
 
Headache Classification Committee: J Olesen, et al. The International Classification of 
Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (beta version). Cephalalgia. 2013, 33:629-808. 
Description:  
Headache occurring on 15 or more days per month developing as a consequence of regular 
overuse of acute or symptomatic headache medication (on 10 or more, or 15 or more days per month, depending on the medication) for more than 3 months. It usually, but not invariably, resolves after the overuse is stopped. 
 
General comment:  
In the criteria set out below for the various subtypes, the specified numbers of days of medication use considered to constitute overuse are based on expert opinion rather than on formal evidence.  
 
Diagnostic criteria:  
A. Headache occurring on _15 days per month in a patient with a pre-existing headache disorder 
B. Regular overuse for >3 months of one or more drugs that can be taken for acute and/or 
symptomatic treatment of headache  
C. Not better accounted for by another ICHD-3 diagnosis.

 3. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE  
Carp al tunnel syndrome (CTS) is the most common peripheral neuropathy, affecting 
approximately 5% of the population 1.  A multitude of treatments are available to  treat CTS, 
including activity modification, bracing/splinting, hand therapy, modalities (e.g., therapeutic 
lasers or ultrasound, iontophoresis), ac upuncture, corticosteroid injections, and carpal tunnel 
release ( CTR ) surgery  performed  using an open or an endoscopic approach 2-7.  Currently, there 
is no universally accepted algorithm to guide treatment for pat ients suffering with CTS.  T he 
American Academy of Orthopedic Surgery (AAOS)  CTS Clinical Practice Guidelines reported 
that only three treatments are strongly supported in the literature: splinting, corticosteroid injections, and CTR  
4.  Although some patients with mild -moderate symptoms are successfully 
treated with splinting and/or corticosteroid injections, those with progressive, refractory, or 
severe symptoms generally proceed to CTR for definitive management  2,3,5 -9. 
 
The goal of CTR is to reduce median nerve pressure by  dividing the transverse carpal ligament  
(TCL)  while avoiding iatrogenic injury to surrounding neurovascular structures.  Among the 
~600,000 CTR procedures performed in the United States annually 1,10, most  (70-80%) use  a 
traditional open technique  (OCTR)  during which a palmar incision is made to dissect down to 
the TCL and transect it using a scalpel, scissors, o r a similar cutting device  11-13.  The OCTR 
technique require s a relatively large (3 -5 cm) incision and may be  associated with a prolonged 
recovery period due to palmar pain and the need to protect the wound 12,14 -17.   
 
Over time, there has been a trend to use smaller incisions (1- 3 cm) to reduce surgical morbidity 
using mini -OCTR (mOCTR)  or endoscopic CTR  11,16,17 ,19.  Because long -term outcomes and 
complication profiles are generally equivalent among these CTR procedures  18, factors related to 
patient recovery time such as time to return to normal activities and work absenteeism are 
important  considerations that may assist in shared decision- making between physicians and 
patients.  
 In recent y ears, mult iple studies have demonstrated the feasibility of using ultrasound to perform 
CTR through even  smaller incisions while maintaining or even improving visualization of the 
carpal tunnel region, including its at -risk neurovascular structures.  During CTR with  ultrasound 
guidance  (CTR -US), the carpal tunnel is typically accessed through a single small wrist or 
palmar incision  <5 mm  length and the TCL is transected using a small knife or similar cutting 
instrument while the carpal tunnel structures are continuously monitored using US.  To date, a total of 1 3 clinical studies have been published reporting results on over 1 300 hands in over 1000 
patients at up to 2 years post -treatment  compar ing recovery time, effectiveness, and safety in 
subjects with CTS treated with CTR -US or mOCTR with US guidance  
19-31.  Among these over 
1300 hands , there were no major neurovascular complications, and the clinical success rate was 
>95%.  Furthermore, two  randomized controlled trials and  one prospective non-randomized trial 
demonstrated superior early outcomes for CTR -US compared to mOCTR 21,24,28.  However, these 
trials were limited by small sample size, short follow -up duration, or both.  No randomized 
controlled trial comparing CTR -US to mOCTR ha s been performed with a samp le size over 100 
patients and with at least 1 year of follow -up.  Thus, the objective of this randomized controlled 
trial is to compare the safety and effectiveness of CTR -US vs. mOCTR in a large cohort of 
patients (n=120) with symptomatic CTS followed for  1-year post -treatment.

 4. DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
The UltraGuideCTR (Sonex Health, Inc., Eagan, MN) is a commercially available medical 
device specifically developed to facilitate C TR-US.  The device is a single -use, hand- held device 
that is inserted into the ca rpal tunnel through a small (typically < 5 mm) wrist incision using 
continuous US guidance.  The working tip of the UltraGuideCTR consists of two inflatable balloons that border a centrally located, retractable retrograde cutting knife. When inflated with sterile saline , the balloons increase the diameter of the tip from 4 mm to 8 mm.  After the tip is 
positioned within the t ransverse s afe zone, the balloons are inflated to cre ate space in the carpal 
tunnel, the blade is activated, and the TCL is transected in a retrograde manner.  Following TCL transection, the blade is recessed, the balloons deflated, and the device is removed. The TCL is probed to ensure a complete release.  The entire procedure is performed using US guidance.  The  
first commercial CTR -US procedure with the device was performed  in February 2017.   Since 
then, over 100 different physicians have been trained to use the UltraGuid eCTR , who 
collectively  have perfor med over 15,000 procedures.  Labeled images of the device are provided 
below.

 5. SUMMARY OF PRIOR CLINICAL EXPERIENCE  
Representative prior experience with CTR -US using the UltraGuideCTR is derived from the 
APEX- CTR post market  registry  31.  This m ulticenter , observational post -market registry 
enrolled patients treated with CTR -US in routine clinical practice in the United States.   Data 
collection in this reg istry began after FDA clearance to collect post -market  safety  and 
effectiveness information on the device  and patient outcomes . The research methods adhered to 
the guidelines set forth in the  Declaration of Helsinki.   This study was granted a waiver of 
consent exemption from WCG IRB (Puyallup, WA) . 
 
The eligibility criteria were purposely  broad to reflect a heterogenous sample of CTS patients  
treated in routine clinical practice.   Patient diagnosis was determined  according to the practice 
patterns of each participating physician, all of whom were experienced in the diagnosis and management of CTS. CTS  was diagnosed primarily on clinical  grounds, with ancillary testing 
such as electrophysiological studies ordered a t the discretion of the physician. Eligible patients 
were adults (age ≥18 years) who were treated with CTR -US and demonstrated a willingness to 
participate in the registry and participate in specified follow -up activities.   No limitations were 
imposed on m aximum patient age, medical or surgical history, or clinical presentation.  
 
All patients were treated with CTR -US using the UltraGuideCTR  device, which was inserted 
into the car pal tunnel through a small (typically <5 mm) wrist incision using real- time ultrasound 
guidance.  The physicians in this study represented a variety of specialties and procedur al 
experience and  completed a formal cadaver -based training program prior to per forming CTR -US 
in clinical practice.   Factors such as patient  selection, anesth esia, and postoperative care were 
determined by practice -specific preferences.  Face -to-face follow -up visits  varied according to 
the usual practice patterns of each participati ng physician and were not dictated by the study. 
There was no requirement for r eturn follow -up visits as all data were  collected via text message, 
e-mail,  or chart review.  
 Patients completed a preoperative questionnaire, daily post -operative text message questions for 
up to 14 days post  procedure, and emailed questionnaires at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 
months postoperatively. Pre -treatment  patient assessments included demographic data, medical 
and surgical history, work status, and patient -reported  outcomes including the Quick form of the 
Disabilities o f the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand Questionnaire (QDASH), and the  BCTQ -SSS and 
Functional Status Scale (BCTQ -FSS). Return to normal  activities and return to work were 
collected via daily text messages for the first 14 days. Thereafter, postoperative outcomes we re 
collected via e -mail or text message and included QDASH, BCTQ -SSS, BCTQ -FSS, return to 
normal activities,  return to work, and patient satisfaction. 
 Co-primary endpoints of this study were QDASH, B CTQ -SSS,  and BCTQ -FSS. The QDASH is 
an 11- item patient- reported  questionnaire that has been validated for CTS where the  total score 
ranges from 0 (indicating no disability) to 100 (indicating most severe disability) 
32. The BCTQ 
is a CTS  specific questionnaire consisting of 11 symptom severity questions and 8 functional 
status questions. Scoring for the BCTQ - SSS and BCTQ -FSS ranges from 1 to 5, wit h higher 
scores  indicating more severe symptoms 33.  Minimal clinically  important differences (MCIDs) 
for the postoperative change  in patient -reported outcomes were 15 points  for QDASH 34, 1.14

 points for BCTQ -SSS 35, and 0.74 points for BCTQ -FSS 35.  Return to normal activi ties was 
ascertained  by asking patients when they had returned to normal daily activities outside of work.  
Return to work was ascertained by asking employed patients when they had returned to work in 
any capacity, a definition that is commonly used among CTS studies 36,37.  Patient satisfaction 
with the procedure was  reported on a 5 -point Likert scale ranging from 1 (very diss atisfied)  to 5 
(very satisfied); a score of 4 or 5 indicated that  a patient was satisfied with the procedu re.  
Postoperative complications were recorded via chart review  performed by the treating physician.  
 Among 535 patients who enrolled in the registry and provided postoperative follow -up, data 
were available on 499 (93%) patients at 2 weeks, 475 (89%) at 1 month, 446 (83%) at 3 months, and 373 (70%) at 6 months.  The cohort of 373 patients with 6- month follow -up form the basis 
for this report.  Between November 2019 and July 2021, 373 patients (427 hands, mean age 55 
years, 71% female, 62% employed) underw ent CTR -US at 24 sites in the United States .  A total 
of 329 (88.2%) procedures were performed using local anesthesia, 44 (11.8%) were perform ed 
using monitored anesthesia care, and no procedures were performed using general anesthesia.  There were 217 uni lateral CTR -US procedures, 51 bilateral staged CTR -US procedures, and 54 
bilateral simultaneous CTR -US procedures.  Bilateral simultaneous procedures consisted of 
14.5% of cases and 25.3% of treated hands.   
 
Patient -reported measures of symptom severity a nd physical function demonstrated rapid 
improvement following CTR -US.  Mean QDASH scores were 41.7±20.1 at baseline, 21.4±15.9 
at 2 weeks, 17.7±15.1 at 1 month, 13.3±15.0 at 3 months, and 11.0±15.2 at 6 months.  QDASH scores decreased by 20.3 (95% CI: 17.5 to 23.0) points at 2 weeks and 30.8 (95% CI: 28.1 to 
33.4) points at 6 months (p<0.001 at each follow -up interval).   
 
Mean BCTQ -SSS scores w ere 3.0±0.7 at baseline, 1.7±0.6 at 2 weeks, 1.7±0.6 at 1 month, 
1.5±0.6 at 3 months, and 1.4±0.6 at 6 months.  BC TQ-SSS scores decreased by 1.3 (95% CI: 
1.2-1.4) points at 2 weeks and 1.6 (95% CI: 1.5- 1.7) points at 6 months (p<0.001 at each follow -
up int erval).  Mean BCTQ -FSS scores were 2.4±0.8 at baseline, 1.7±0.6 at 2 weeks, 1.6±0.5 at 1 
month, 1.4±0.5 at 3 months, and 1.3±0.5 at 6 months.  BCTQ -FSS scores decreased by 0.7 (95% 
CI: 0.5- 0.8) points and 1.0 (95% CI: 0.9- 1.1) points at 2 weeks and 6 month s, respectively 
(p<0.001 at each follow -up interval).  
 
The median time to return to normal activities following C TR-US was 3 days ( interquartile range  
[IQR]: 2-5 days), with 96.5% of patients reporting return to normal activities within 2 weeks of 
the procedure.  Among employed patients, the median time to return to work following CTR -US 
was 5 days (IQR: 3- 9 days), w ith 92.3% of patients reporting return to work within 2 weeks of 
the procedure.  The median time to return to work based on employment type was 4 days (IQR: 
3-6 days) for desk- based occupations, 6 days (IQR: 4- 11 days) for light manual occupations, and 
5 days (IQR: 3 -14 days) for heavy manual occupations.  The percentage of patients who were 
satisfied or very satisfied with the procedure was 91.6% at 2 w eeks, 88.2% at 1 month, 88.0% at 
3 months, and 89.8% at 6 months.   
 
Among 346 (93%) patients with availa ble complication data, no major neurovascular 
complications were reported.  Specifically, there was 1 (0.3%) incomplete release confirmed during reoper ation and no reports of superficial infection, deep infection, arterial laceration, or 
permanent nerve injury.

Overall, the results of the APEX- CTR post market  registry confirmed that patients treated with 
CTR -US reported clinically meaningful improvements in symptoms and function, rapid return to 
normal activities, and minimal work absenteeism, with an exce llent safety profile.   Given the 
promising results with  CTR -US in this registry, comparison of clinical outcomes with CTR -US 
vs. mOCTR in a randomized controlled trial is warranted.

 6. STUDY PROCEDURES  
6.1 INVESTIGATIONAL SITE SELECTION  
Investigational sites will be selected based on the availability of the subject  pool to be included 
in the study, the ability of the study site to perform the research in compliance with the 
investigational plan, and agreement to comply with the institutional review board (IRB) requirements.  All investigators will be board certified  orthopedic or plastic surgeons 
experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of CTS, including CTR- US and mOCTR.  Each 
surgeon will complete a structured training program in musculoskeletal ultrasound including ultrasound machine controls, sonographic anatomy of the carpal tunnel region, identification and cross -sectional measurement of the median nerve, and CTR-US using the UltraGuideCTR 
device.  In addition, all investigators must have treated a minimum of 10 procedures  using CTR-
US and 10 patients using mOCTR prior to treating subjects in the clinical trial.  
 
6.2 SUBJECT SELECTION  
Patients with suspected CTS will be consecutively evaluated for study eligibility at each site.

 6. Clinically significant d egenerative arthritis  of the upper limb (shoulder to hand) on the 
target  side 
7. Clinically significant inflammatory disease (including tenosynovitis) of the upper limb 
(shoulder to hand) on the target  side 
8. Clinically significant trauma or deformity of the upper limb (shoulder to hand) on the target  side 
9. Clinically significant vascular disease (including Raynaud’s phenomenon) of the upper limb (shoulder to hand) on the target  side 
10. Clinically significant neurological disorder (including complex regional pain syndrome) of the upper limb (shoulder to hand) on the target  side 
11. Planned surgical or interventional procedure on the contralateral  wrist or hand 
12. Systemic inflammatory disease (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, lupus)

19. Inability to provide a legally acceptable Informed Consent Form and/or comply with all follow-up requirements 
20. Subject has other medical, social or psychological conditions that, in the opinion of the investigator, preclude them from receiving the pre- treatment, required treatment, and 
post-treatment procedures and evaluations  
6.2.3 Screen Failures  
Participants who are consented to participate in the clinical trial, but who do not meet one or more criteria required for participation in the trial during the screening procedures, are considered screen failures.  Screen failures will be immediately discontinued from the trial and will not be randomized to receive CTR -US or mOCTR.   Participants who are discontinued from 
the study due to screen failure may not be reconsidered for study enrollment at a later date.  Study sites will document screen failures by recording the date of screening, an anonymized patient iden tifier, and the primary inclusion and/or exclusion criterion failure that resu lted in the 
decision to discontinue the patient from the study.   
6.2.4 Timing of Patient Screening  
All baseline testing and evaluations should be performed as close to the time of the procedure as 
possible .  If the subject’s procedure date is more than 30 days from the screening evaluation, 
subject screening  validated questionnaires must be repeated to ensure accuracy of baseline 
condition at the time of procedure.    
6.3 RANDOMIZATION  
Subjects meeting all study inclusion/exclusion criteria after their screening evaluation will be 
randomized .  This study will enroll 120 subjects who will be randomized in 2:1 fashion to 
receive C TR-US (n≈80) or mOCTR (n ≈40).  The randomization sequence for this trial will be 
computer- gener ated by the electronic data capture system (Viedoc).  The randomization

No. 9007 9-TP , Rev.0 5 
 sequence will be stratified by site with variable block sizes.  Treatment assignment will be 
concealed until it is presented to authorized site personnel at the time of randomization.  Only 
randomized and treated subjects will be considered enrolled in the study.  Randomized patients who do not receive their assigned  treatment will be discontinued from the trial.  
 
6.4 BLINDING  
Owing to obvious differences in surgical technique, it is not possible to blind the treating 
physicians.  Owing to notable visual differences in the postoperative scar between surgical techniques (3- 5 mm for CTR -US and approximately 3 cm for mOCTR), it is not possible to blind 
the subjects.  Owing to the fact that all data collected in this trial will be self -reported, it is not 
possible to blind outcome assessors (i.e., subjects).  
6.5 PROCEDURE  
The key  procedural steps involved in CTR- US are listed below.   
1. Using direct US visualization, identify relevant anatomical structures within the carpal 
tunnel. 
2. Dissect synovial tissue from the undersurface of the TCL via hydrodissection. 
3. Insert the device through a small wrist incision and advance into the carpal tunnel. 
4. Position the tip of the device distal to the distal TCL so th at the TCL Blade will engage 
the distal TCL.  
5. Confirm the position of the device under ultrasound. 
6. Activate the Stealth MicroGuard balloons to create space within the carpal tunnel.  
7. Deploy the TCL Blade by moving the slide button proximally to transect the TCL from distal to proximal until the TCL Blade passes into its proximal recessed position.  
8. With the device or an elevator, probe the TCL to ensure a complete release.  
Complete procedural details are provided in the Instructions for Use (https://sonexhealth.com/physicians/ultraguidectr/instructions- for-use
). 
 
6.6 POST -TREATMENT ASSESSMENTS  
Postoperative patient care instructions will be standardized for each treatment group and among all participating sites to minimize bias. Investigators will instruct subjects to “participate in activities and return to work, as tolerated, based on pain, function, and wound healing status”.

 6.7.1 Unscheduled Follow- up Visits  
If subjects are seen for unscheduled visits because of an AE or additional hand surgery, 
appropriate Case Report Form(s) , will be completed , if applicable.  
6.7.2 Loss to Follow- up 
If a subject fails  to comply with follow-up evaluations, the investigational site mus t make at least 
two repeated attempts  to contact the subject.  Each attempt to contact the subject and the method 
used (e.g., telephone contact, registered letter) must be documented in the subject’s records.    
6.8 SUBJECT WITHDRAWAL FROM STUDY 
6.8.1 Voluntary With drawal 
A subject may voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time.  If a subject officially withdraws 
from the study, the investigator must ensure that the reason for the withdrawal is d ocumented .  If 
the subject had an AE, the subject should be followed until the resolution of the AE, if possible.  Data from these subjects will be included in the analysis up to the point of each subject’s withdrawal.  
6.8.2 Involuntary Withdrawal 
A subject also  may be withdrawn by the investigator if the investigator determines that continued 
subject participation in the study will have a negative effect on the safety of the subject.  Data obtained up to the date of subject withdrawal will be included in the study.   
6.8.2.1  During First 3  months following Surgery  
• Subjects who have any  subsequent surgery on either  hand during the first 3 months 
following their procedure will be withdrawn from the study.   
6.8.2.2  After 3 month eVisit : 
• Treated Subjects  
o Surgery in the Contralat eral Hand - Subjects who have subsequent surgery on the 
contralateral hand  (i.e., non-study hand), including CTR, will not be involuntarily 
withdrawn from the study.  Note that a subsequent CTR in the contralateral hand 
is still not eligible for enrollment in TUTOR . 
o Surgery in the Study Target Hand –  
• Subjects who have subsequent surgery on the TUTOR  hand that includes 
the wrist or carpal tunnel region, metacarpals, or thumb (with the 
exception of trigger thumb release) will be withdrawn from the study.   
• Subjects who have subsequent finger surgery (including trigger finger 
release) or trigger thumb r elease that does not affect the wrist or carpal 
tunnel region will not be withdrawn from the study.

 6.9 END OF STUDY 
Subjects may exit the study at the end of the study (i.e., the study is discontinued by the Sponsor) 
or when the subject has completed the 12- month follow -up visit, whichever comes first , unless 
the subject opted to find an alternative treatment .   
 An End of Study CRF will be completed at the time the study is completed, discontinued, or lost 
to follow -up for each subject.

 7. OUTCOMES 
 
7.1 MAIN OUTCOMES  
7.1.1 Time to Return to Normal Daily Activities within 3 Days  
Time to return to normal daily activities  will be collected through the ViedocMe ePRO module 
which asks whether the subject has returned to normal daily activities outside of work.  
Reminders will be sent to the subjects either by email or text messaging to minimize the ris k of 
missing data.  The time to return to normal daily activities will be defined as the number of days between treatment and the time the subject reports returning to normal daily activities, irrespective of work status.    
7.1.2 Time to R eturn to Work Among E mployed Subjects  
Among study subjects who report full- time or part- time employment, time to return to work will 
be ascertained through the ViedocMe ePRO module by ask ing whether the subject has returned 
to work in full or limited capacity.  Return to work wi thin 3 days postoperatively will represent a 
secondary endpoint of the study.  The  time to return to work will be defined as the number of 
days between treatment and the time the subject reports returning to work in any capacity. 
7.1.3 BCTQ -SSS Change at 3 M onths  
The BCTQ is a CTS specific questionnaire that has been shown to be highly reproducible, internally consistent, valid, and responsive to clinical change in CTS and subject status post-CTR.   The BCTQ consists of 11 symptom severity questions (BCTQ -SSS) .  Scoring for the 
BCTQ - SSS ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms, and is 
calculated as the mean of each response.  The  between -group mean di fference in BCTQ -SSS 
change scores at the 3-month follow-up will represent a secondary endpoint of the study. 
7.1.4 BCTQ -FSS Change at 3 M onths  
The BCTQ additionally consi sts of  8 functional status questions (BCTQ -FSS).  Scoring for the 
BCTQ -FSS ranges from 1 to 5, with higher scores indicating more functional limitation, and is 
calculated as the mean of each response.  The  between -group mean difference in BCTQ -FSS 
change s cores at the 3-month follow-up will represent a secondary endpoint of the study. 
7.1.5 Numeric Pain Scale Change at 3 M onths  
Subjects will be asked to rate their wrist pain severity on a scale of 0 to 10, where 0 represents 
“no pain” and 10 represents “worst pos sible  pain”.  The  between -group mean difference in 
Numeric Pain Scale change scores at the 3-month follow-up will represent a secondary endpoint 
of the study. 
7.1.6 EQ-5D- 5L Change at 3 M onths  
The EuroQol 5- Dimension 5 -Level  (EQ-5D- 5L) is a generic preference-based questionnaire 
developed by the EuroQol Group to measure health- related quality of life.  The EQ -5D- 5L 
measures quality of life across 5 domains: mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
and anxiety/depression.  Each dimension is scored on a 5 -level severity ranking consisting of: no

 problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, unable to/extreme problems.  
The between -group mean difference in EQ -5D- 5L change score at the 3-month follow-up will 
represent a secondary endpoint of the study. 
7.1.7 Device- or Procedure- related A dverse E vents  at 3 M onths  
Adverse events  (AEs) occurring within 90 days of treatment and  that are adjudicated as 
definitely  related or probably related to the device , or definitely  related or probably related to the 
procedure will be included in this endpoint.  The incidence of device- or procedure- related AEs 
within 90 days of treatment in each study group will represent a secondary endpoint of the study. 
 
7.2 ADDITIONAL OUTCOMES  
Additional outcomes of the study w ill include: 
• Median time to return to normal activities  
• Median time to return to work 
• BCTQ -SSS change at 2 weeks, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months 
• BCTQ -FSS change at 2 weeks, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months 
• Numeric Pain Scale change at 2 weeks, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months 
• EQ-5D-5L change at 2 weeks, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months 
• Device- or procedure- related AEs at 2 weeks, 1 month, 6 months, and 12 months 
• Serious device- or procedure-related AEs at 2 weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 
12 months

 8. ADVERSE EVENTS  
An AE  is de fined as any adverse change (i.e., de novo  or preexisting condition) from the 
subject’s baseline medical condition occurring after the  initial procedural  incision has been 
initiated.   Any AE which resolved and then recurred w ill be reported as a separate AE.   A pre -
specified listing of AEs will be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
 
8.1 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as one that suggests a significant hazard or side effect, 
regardless of the relationship to the devic e or procedure .  This includes, but may not be limited 
to, any event that:  
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening, or places the participant at immediate risk of death from the event as it occurred  
• Requires or prolongs hospitalization  
• Causes persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
• Results in congenital anomalies or birth defects  
• Is another condition which investigators judge to represent significant hazards  
 Important medical events may be considered serious by the investigator although they may not be immediately life threatening or result in death or prolong hospitalization.  Such important medical events are those that may jeopardize the subject, require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above, or result in urgent inve stigation.   
  SAEs  should be reported to the study Sponsor as soon as possible (24 hours recommended), but 
no more than 10 working days after the date the site becomes aware of the event.  Sites are also required to adhere to the reviewing IR B requirements for reporting of SAEs. 
 
8.2 UNANTICIPATED ADVERSE DEVICE  EFFECT 
An unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) is any serious adverse effect on the health or 
safety  of a subject , any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with a  device, 
if such  effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan (e.g., ICF, Study Protocol, Instructions for Use (IFU), publications, etc.), or any other unanticipated serio us problem associated with a device that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects . 
 If an unanticipated adverse effect associated with the device occurs, the investigator shall notify the Sponsor  and the IRB as soon as possible.   
 The Sponsor  will investigate the event and notify the FDA and all other participating IRBs and 
investigators.  Should the Sponsor  determine that an unanticipated adverse effect presents an

TUTOR                                             Confidential Information   Page 22 of 35 
No. 9007 9-TP, Rev.0 5 
 unreasonable risk to all participating subjects, the Sponsor will suspend the cl inical investigation 
and notify all partici pating investigators, IRBs , country regulatory bodies and FDA.  
 
8.3 RELATION SHIP OF ADVERSE EVENTS TO THE DEVICE OR PROCEDURE  
A description of how an AE relates to the study device or  procedure will be reported on th e 
Adverse Event CRF . 
 
• A device- related AE is directly attributable to the device or to improper use of the device.   
• A procedure -related AE is directly attributable to the procedure, irrespective of the device, 
including complications from anesthesia or other procedures incidental to the main 
procedure.  
 
The relationship of the AE to the device or procedure will be  determined by the Investigator using 
the following definitions:  
 
• Definite :  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from t he time of the  index 
procedure, which includes AEs that occur during the index procedure or during the follow -up period.  
• Probable :  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of the index 
procedure, and the possibility can be excluded that factors other  than the index procedure, 
such as underlying disease, concomitant drugs, or concurrent treatment caused the AE.  
• Possible :  The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of the index procedure 
and the possibility of  index procedure involvemen t cannot be excluded.  However, other factors 
such as underlying disease, concomitant medications, or concurrent treatment are presumable.  
• Unlikely :  The AE has an improbable temporal sequence from the time of the index 
procedure , or such AE can be reasona bly explained by other factors, including 
underlying disease, concomitant medication, or concurrent treatment.  
• Not related : The AE has no temporal sequence from the time of the index procedure, or it 
can be explained by other fac tors, including underlying disease, concomitant medication, 
or concurrent treatment.  
 
8.4 DEVICE FAILURES, MALFUNCTIONS AND NEAR INCIDENTS  
Device failures or malfunctions will be reported to Sonex Health  by the clinical sites.  If the 
failure or malfunction re sults in an AE , the event s hall be reported to the Sponsor within two ( 2) 
working days  after the Investigator becomes aware of the event  and reported to the IRB (if 
required) within the IRB  required timeframe.  The device involved in the incident should be  
returned to the Sponsor fo r evaluation.   
 8.5 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
AEs will be recorded on the Adverse Event  CRF and described by (a) duration ( onset  and 
resolution dates); (b) relationship to the study device or procedure; (c) action taken to resolve  the 
event; (d) outcome of the event; and (e) whether or not such event is considered to have been

No. 9007 9-TP, Rev.0 5 
 serious.  Additional information, such as procedural notes, treatment notes, or a signed clinical 
summary  may be required as supporting documentation for the reported AE. 
 During the s tudy, all deaths must be reported to the Sponsor within 48 hours and  should also be 
reported on the End of Study CRF.  A copy of the subject’s death records, medical records for the events that led to the subject’s death, and a death certificate (if available) should be provided.  
 
Determination of whether a subject experienced  an AE can be made in  three different ways .  
First, an AE can be documented  by the site  during the study procedure.  Second, a subject m ay 
report an AE directly via phone call to the i nvestigative site.  Third, an AE can be identified by 
the site during the review of the subject -uploaded wound healing images . If the site identifies a 
potential AE based on image review or is notified of a potential AE by the subject, confirmation of the AE will occur by a phone call with the subject or, if necessary, by asking the subject to 
return for a follow -up clinical evaluation.   
 
8.6 INDEPENDENT MEDICAL REVIEWER 
Evaluation and adjudication of all AEs  will be performed on an ongoing basis by an independent 
medical reviewer.   The independent medical reviewer  will review AEs for AE classification, 
seriousness, and relationship to the device or procedure.  Discrepancies  between the 
investigational site and th e independent medical reviewer will be handled by discussion, with the 
determination by independent medical reviewer serving as the final classification.  
 8.7 DATA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will oversee  enrollment and safety of the subjects for  
the study.  Members of DSM B will be independent of the sponsor  and investigational sites .  The 
DSMB for the study will consist of three  (3) clinicians with expertise  in orthopedic or plastic 
surgery , and with experience and expertise in clinical trials.   The DSMB will convene at least 
once during the subject enrollment period and will review, at a minimum, subject enrollment 
status and incidence of AEs.  Based on a review of these data, t he DSMB  will advise the Sponsor 
to continue the trial  with no modification, or to modify the tri al as appropriate if enrollment or 
safety concerns are identified.

 9. RISK -BENEFIT ANALYSIS  
9.1 RISK ANALYSIS  
Complications and risks that exist for other CTR treatments may also exist for the 
UltraGuideCTR technique.   The  UltraGuideCTR technique has undergone extensive risk 
analysis testing and is designed with safeguards built into the device to mitigate the serious risks.  The full list of anticipated adverse events is provided on the A dverse Event  CRF.   All 
complications that can occur with mOCTR may  also occur with CTR -US. 
 
9.2 POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
The data obtained from this study will be used to document the safety and effecti veness of 
UltraGuideCTR and compare it to mOCTR.  The data derived from this study may benefit 
individuals with CTS in the context of a  shared -decision making process when contemplating 
CTR.  In addition, subjects potentially could directly benefit from pa rticipation in this study.  
UltraGuideCTR is designed to provide relief from CTS through a less invasive approach than mOCTR.  Previous  publications reported that patients may experience significant symptom 
relief and return to activities within 3 -5 days post -procedure, which is faster than typically 
reported for mOCTR.

 10. DATA ANALYSIS  
This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled trial d esigned to evaluate the safety and 
effectiveness of CTR -US compared to mOCTR in treating subjects with symptomatic CTS.  
Eligible subjects will be randomized (2:1) to receive CTR- US (n≈80) or mOCTR (n ≈40). 
 
10.1 SAMPLE SIZE JUSTIFICATION  
The results of the power analysis provided a sample size consisting of 10 2 evaluable subjects.   
Group sample sizes of 68 and 34 achieve 80% power to reject the null hypothesis of zero effect 
size when the population effect size is 0.60 and alpha is 0.05 using a two-sided two- sample  
equal -variance t -test with a 2:1 randomization allocation .  To account for reasonable subject 
attrition, 120 subjects (n≈ 80 CTR-US, n≈ 40 mOCTR) will be enrolled  in the trial.  
 10.2 ANALYSIS P OPULATIONS  
The primary statistical analyses will be performed on a modified intention -to-treat population, 
which will be comprised of all subjects who meet all study eligibility criteria, are subse quently 
randomized, and receive their assigned treatment.  Randomized subjects who withdraw from the 
study prior to treatment or who receive the incorrect treatment will not be included in the modified intention -to-treat population. 
 
10.3 DURATION VARIABLES  
Study day 0 is the day the subject receives CTR- US or mOCTR.  Postoperative study day will be 
calculated relative to day 0 as follows:  
 
Study Day = (Date of Event – Date of Treatment)  
 
10.4 ANALYSIS WINDOWS  
Study data will be categorized into discrete, contiguous reporting windows to ensure that all 
available data are in cluded in the analyses.  The analysis windows for this study are defined 
below:

 10.5 DATA ANALYSIS METHODS  
Baseline data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics.  Continuous data will be summarized 
using mean and standard deviation for normally distributed data, median and interquartile range for non-normally distributed data, and counts and percentages for categorical data.  For categorical variables, percentages will be calculated based on non -missing data.  
 
The percentage of patients in each treatment group that return to normal daily activities within 3 
days postoperatively, and the percentage of  employed patients in each treatment group that return 
to work within 3 days postoperatively will be reported and compared using the Fisher’s exact test.  
These outcomes will  also be reported as the median and interquartile range in each treatment 
group.  Due to the likelihood that the data distribution may be positively skewed, the 
nonparametric Mann -Whitney U test will be the statistical test used to assess  these endpoints.   
 Differences between the CTR -US and mOCTR groups with respect to longitudinally measured 
continuous outcomes (i.e. BCTQ -SSS, BCTQ -FSS, Numeric Pain Scale, EQ-5D- 5L) will be 
analyzed using mixed model analysis and adjusting for the basel ine score.   
 Adverse events will be reported using counts, percentages and exact 95% confidence intervals using Clopper- Pearson’s method.  The incidence of AEs in each group will be calculated on a 
per-subject basis and analyzed using Fisher’s exact test. 
 Statistical analyses will be performed using a two -sided hypothesis test at a 5% level of 
significance.  No adjustments for multiplicity are planned .  Missing data imputation will not be 
performed.

 11. STUDY RESPONSIBILITIES AND MANAGEMENT  
This study will  be performed in accordance with all requirements set forth in the U.S. 
regulations, 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Parts 812, 50, 54, and 56, the Declaration of 
Helsinki, and any other applicable local laws, regulations, or guidelines.  
 
11.1 INVESTIGATO R RESPONSIBILITIES  
Each  investigator will be  responsible for ensuring the investigation is conducted according to all 
signed agreements, the study protocol , IRB requirements, and applicable la ws and r egulations.  
Investigator s may not begin enrollment until the Sponsor  or its designee receives and approves 
(when necessary) the following documents:  
 
• Signed Investigator Agreement  
• Financial disclosure f orms for all participating investigators  
• IRB r oster  (or IRB registration number  from the Office of Hum an Research Protection)  
• IRB protocol and ICF a pprovals  
• Investigators’ current curricula vitae and medical license  
• Signed Site Delegation Log 
 
It is acceptable for Investigator s to delegate one or more of the above functions to a Co - or Sub-
Investigat or, or a trained Research Coordinator; however, the Investigator remains responsible 
for the proper conduct of the clinical investigation, including obtaining and documenting proper study informed consent, collecting all required dat a, submitting accurate and complete CRFs, etc.  
 At each  study site, appropriate procedures must be followed to maintain subject confidentiality 
according to appropriate local regulations (e.g., Health Insurance Portability and Accountability 
Act (HIPAA)  in the U.S.).  Each site may have its own internal procedures or requirements for 
use and release of subject medical information in research studies.  Each Investigator is responsible for obtaining appropriate approvals, consents, or releases of medical information as dictated by their relevant subject privacy laws.  
 The study is not transferable to other sites attended by the Investigator unless prior approval is obtained from the appropriate IRB and the Sponsor . 
 
11.2 SUBJECT ENROLLMENT PROCESS  
All study candida tes must appropriately consent to participate in the study, as administrated by 
qualified study site personnel using an IRB and Sponsor -approved informed consent form (ICF) 
prior to beginning any aspect of the study procedure or tests that are not standard of care for the 
site.  Investigational sites will be required to document the consent process within each enrolled subject’s  medical record.

No. 9007 9-TP, Rev.0 5 
 11.3 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD 
Investigators must submit the study protocol to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and obtain 
the IRB’s w ritten approval before being allowed to conduct and participate in the study.  Each 
Investigator is responsible for fulfilling any conditions of appr oval imposed by the  IRB, such as 
regular reporting, study timing, etc.  Investigators will provide the Sponsor with copies of such 
approvals and reports . 
 
11.4 INFORMED CONSENT FORM  
The Sponsor will provide a template informed consent form (ICF) to each study s ite for IRB 
submission.  The template may be modified to suit the requirements of the individual study site , 
but the Sponsor must pre -approve all changes to the ICF prior to initial submission to the IRB .   
 
Each  Investigator or assigned designee must admi nister this approved ICF to each prospective 
study subject and  obtain the subject's signature or a legally approved designee’s signature along 
with the date of consent prior to enrollment in the study.  The ICF must be obtained in 
accordance with the appli cable guidelines on 21 CFR 50, 52 and 56, the Declaration of Helsi nki, 
ISO 14155 or local regulations and l aws, whichever represents the greater protection of the 
individual.  Subjects must be informed about their right to withdraw from the study at any ti me 
and for any reason without sanction, penalty, or loss of benefits to which the subject is otherwise entitled and  be informed that withdrawal from the study will not jeopardize their future medical 
care.  A copy of their signed ICF must be given to each subject enrolled in the study.  The institutional standard subject consent form does not replace the TUTOR study ICF . 
 
11.5 CASE REPORT FORM  
The Sponsor will provide standardized case report forms (CRFs) for each individual subject.  
The CRFs will be electronic (EDC, 21 CRF Part 11 compliant), and will be used to record study data, and are an integral part of the st udy and subsequent reports .   
 The electronic CRFs for individual subjects will be provided by the Sponsor via a web portal.  After the data has been  submitted,  reviewed , and centrally monitored, corrections will be 
initiated via automatic data queries and /or manual data queries  answered  by appropriate study 
site personnel.  The Investigator will provide  his/her electronic signature on the appropriate 
eCRFs in compliance with local regulations . 
 
11.6 CENTRAL DATABASE

No. 9007 9-TP, Rev.0 5 
 11.9.1 Confidentiality  
All information and data sent to the Sponsor concerning subjects or  their participation in this 
study will be considered confidential according to HIPAA  regulations.  Data used in the analysis 
and reporting of this evaluation will be used in a manner without identifiable reference to the 
subject.     
11.9.2 Amending the Investig ational Study Protocol  
Only the study Sponsor can amend the Investigational Protocol.  All changes to the 
Investigational Protoc ol must be submitted to the IRB for review and approval.  Any change that 
would require alteration to the ICF must receive approval from the applicable IRB prior to 
implementation.  Following approval, any Investigational Protocol amendment must be  
distrib uted to all protocol recipients at the site . 
11.9.3 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is an unplanned excursion from the protocol that is not implemented or intended as a systematic change.   If an investigator failed to perform tests or examinations as 
required by the protocol or there were failures on the part of study subjects to complete 
scheduled visits as required by the protocol, would be considered protocol deviations. These types of deviations  are reported to the sponsor and in accordance with the IRB policy.  
A Protocol Deviation CRF must be completed by the site  for each study protocol deviation (e.g., 
failure to obtain inf ormed consent, enrolling a subject who does not meet inclusion / exclus ion 
criteria, not performing required testing, missed follow -up window, etc.).  An Investigator must 
notify the Sponsor and the reviewing IRB of any deviation from the s tudy protocol that was done 
to protect the life or physical well- being of a subject.  S uch notice should be given as soon as 
possible, but no later than five  (5) working days after the emergency occurred.  
11.9.4 Site Noncompliance  and Nonperformance  
Repeat protocol deviations wi ll be closely monitored.  If excessive deviations or a failure to 
reduc e deviations are noted, the Sponsor reserves the right to suspend study enrollment at that 
site until a sufficient system is in place at the site to reduce further deviations.   After a  site complete s all required approvals and training, a site initiation visit will be conducted 
as a final check of the site readiness.  If a site is not able to enroll its first subject 3  months after 
“Ready to Enroll” status, the Sponsor may elect to term inate the investigational site and allocate 
the slot to an other candida te site.   
11.9.5 Device Accountability  
The UltraGuideCTR  is an FDA 510k cleared device, will be purchased by the investigational 
sites for use in the study, and does  not r equire device accoun tability tracking within the study.

 12. STUDY MONITORING  
The study sponsor is responsible to ensure that proper monitoring of this investigation is  
conducted.  Appropriately trained personnel, appointed by the study sponsor, will perform  
monitoring.  Monitor s will ensure that the investigation is conducted in accor dance with:  
 
• The signed Investigator’s Agreement  
• The Investigational Plan  
• Appropriate laws and regulations  
• Any conditions of approval imposed by the reviewing IRB and/or other regulatory agencies  
 
The clinical study will be monitored using electronic central monitoring processes .  On -site 
monitoring may occur as needed.  The sponsor may choose to perform random inspections 
throughout the study as an element of quality assurance.  Investigators sha ll allow auditing of 
their clinical investigation procedur es, if necessary . 
 
A study specific Monitoring Plan will be  created and implemented to standardize monitoring 
activities across centers and to ensure human subject protection and verify data integri ty.  The 
monitors shall receive study specific and SOP training prior to conducting any monitoring visits.  Study monitors are selected based on their training, qualifications , and experience to monitor the 
progress of an investigation.  Study monitors may be Sponsor’s employees or representatives.  
All study monitors will be required to follow the Sponsor’s monitoring plan and monitoring standard operating procedures (SOPs).  
Study closure is defined as a specific date that is det ermined by study completion and/ or 
regulatory requirements that have been satisfi ed per the study protocol and/or by decision of the 
Sponsor.  Study closure visits will be conducted via telephone call for all  enrolling clinical sites 
to review record retention requirements with site personnel.

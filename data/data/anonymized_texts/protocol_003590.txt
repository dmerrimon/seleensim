Version 1, September 4, 2024  
Page 5 of 26 3. ABSTRACT  
GREAT - HF Care  
 
• B ackground and Rationale - Heart failure with reduced E jection Fraction (HFrEF) is 
associated with high mortality and adverse events (hospitalization or urgent outpatient 
visits for heart failure ( HF)), along with diminished quality of life. Despite convincing 
data that evidenced -based, guideline- directed medical therapies (GDMT) improve 
mortality and heart failure -related events, there remains insufficient utilization of these 
life-saving drugs (evide nce-based beta -blockers (EBBB), angiotensin-neprilysin 
inhibitors (ARNI)/ angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i)) in patients with HFrEF. 
• Objectives  -
  The primary objective of this study is to implement and evaluate a 
multifaceted, interdisciplinary intervention to improve GDMT use, reduce mortality, and 
reduce future heart failure events in patients  with HFrEF . 
• Study Design – We will conduct a cluster-randomized controlled trial at the level of the 
clinician comparing two multi- faceted interventions to usual care with or without 
systemic education within a population of patients with HFrEF seen at a Geisinger cardiology clinic who are not on complete GDMT.  
• Population - Patients at least 18 years of age with documented HFrEF or Left Ventricular 
Ejection Fraction (LVEF) < 40 (within two years prior to the triggering visit) who have 
an outpatient encounter with the Geisinger Cardiology department (office visit or 
telemedicine). Patients must also not currently be on optimal GDMT according to their electronic health records (EHR), as reflected in use of medications in fewer than four of 
the recommended classes or in all four classes but not ARNI. And patients must not currently be in hospice or palliative care or allergic to all non- prescribed GDMT. The 
clinician target population comprises clinicians practicing at one or more Geisinger outpatient cardiology clinics who manage care for patients with HFrEF and include cardiologists (MD/DO), nurse practitioners, and physician assistants. 
• Interventions – We w
 ill implement the following interventions : 1) focused education 
through a series of focused  in-person or virtual sessions (randomized to receive early or 
late education) ; 2) multi-pronged clinical decision support ( CDS ) inclusive of a patient 
portal message, an interruptive advisory upon chart entry notifying clinicians to consider GDMT, and a Best Practice A dvisory (BPA) that opens a GDMT order set ; and 3) the 
same CDS as #2 but replacing the GDMT order set with a referral to integrated clinical pharmacist co -management .  
• Control – Patients seen by clinicians randomized to us u
 al care will be labeled as control 
patients  and receive care as per usual standard  practice, which may also include referral 
to Medication Therapy Disease Management  (MTDM ). 
Geisinger – GREAT -HF Care Study Protocol  
Version 1, September 4, 2024  
Page 6 of 26 • Outcomes  – The primary outcome will be whether or not improvements in GDMT 
prescribing occur within 30 days of index date . Additional outcomes will include the 
primary outcome at 60 and 90 days , GDMT changes at 30, 60 and 90 days , healthcare 
resource utilization, and total costs of care. 
• Data analysis  – Analyses are described in detail below. Primary analyses will assess 
whether outcomes improve between each interventional arm versus control .  
 
4.
 BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  
HFrEF is associated with high mortality and events (hospitalization or urgent outpatient visit 
for HF), along with poorer quality of life.1 Newer agents (ARNI, SGLT2i) have been 
demonstrated to improve outcomes in multiple trials2-4 and are strongly advocated by 
ACC/AHA Guidelines1 Despite evidenced -based, guideline- directed medical therapies 
(GDMT) including evidence- based beta -blockers (EBBB), angiotensin-neprilysin inhibitors 
(ARNI) /Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), mineralocort icoid receptor antagonists (MRA) and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
inhibitors (SGLT2i), there remains insufficient utilization of these life -saving drugs in 
patients with HFrEF.
1  
Some background research taught us the following:  
- A review of Geisinger data on 7,144 patients with HFrEF from 2018-2021 demonstrated that ~80% of patients were on EBBB; ~50% on ARNI/ACEi/ARB; (3.2-9.7% ARNI), 16-22% on an MRA and 1.3-4.6% on SGLT2i.
5 
- Machine learning algorithms derived from Geisinger data suggest prioritization of patients and closure of treatment gaps will result in lower patient mortality.
6 
- Interviews with 20 Geisinger cardiologists identified “familiarity with newer medications” and “recollection at time of prescribing” as barriers to prescribing GDMT and “assistance by a clinical pharmacist” as a facilitator.
7 
 
Electronic health record functionality and clinical pharmacy services may help to address underlying barriers that presently exist to GDMT optimization. Although c linical decision 
support (CDS) and best practice alerts (BPAs) are ubiquitous in the EPIC system and  may 
assist with broad efforts to improve GD MT prescribing, many barriers exist to their 
effectiveness in practice.  
- HF BPAs do not lead to action: A recent analysis identified 454 BPAs fired for HF for 257 unique patients. There were zero actions taken and 66 overrides of the BPA.
8 
- HF BPAs are not comprehensive: Present BPAs firing for HF at Geisinger are limited to single drug recommendations, do not provide sufficient context for adequate decision -making, and do not include newer agents (i.e., ARNI or SGLT2i) with 
strong evidence for use. 
- HF BPAs are not designed with best evidence principles: Alerts can be ineffective due to multiple design factors that affect behavior, such as inappropriate workflow placement, passive alerting, and alert fatigue.

Geisinger – GREAT -HF Care Study Protocol  
Version 1, September 4, 2024  
Page 7 of 26 Having identified the problems above , we have investigated  solutions to help guide us to 
improve GDMT prescribing. Solutions include : 
- Education and engagement of the clinical staff (physicians, nurse practitioners, 
physician assistants, clinical pharmacists, nurses). 
- Electronic facilitation to overcome clinical inertia . 
o Recent evidence from the PROMPT -HF study suggests a more tailored 
advisory presented to prescribers increases GDMT.10 
o Additional evidence from the BETTER CARE-HF study suggests that alerting informed by evidence-based design principles can substantially increase MRA prescribing in HFrEF.
11  
o Principles guiding lightweight interventions (behavioral “nudges”), from the fields of psychology and economics—including loss framing, social norms, optimal defaults, and other means of changing choice architecture— can be 
implemented using tools such as E HR-based CDS to increase the likelihood 
that clinicians and  patients engage more consistently in optimal behaviors.

5. OBJECTIVE AND HYPOTHESIS  
5.1 Objective  
The primary objective of this study is to implement and evaluate a multifaceted, 
interdisciplinary intervention to improve GDMT use, reduce mortality, and reduce future 
heart failure events in patients  with HFrEF . 
5.2 Hypothesis 
H0: The implementation of a multifaceted, interdisciplinary intervention will not improve 
GDMT for patients with HFrEF.  
HA1: The implementation of a multifaceted, interdisciplinary intervention  incorporating an 
order set  will improve GDMT for patients with HFrEF  more than usual care. 
HA2: The implementation of a multifaceted, interdisciplinary intervention  incorporating a 
pharmacist referral  will improve GDMT for patients with HFrEF more than usual care.   
 6. STUDY METHODS  
6.1 Study D esign   
This is a cluster randomized study designed to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions 
aimed at improving GDMT in patients with HFrEF. Clinicians  were stratified based on 
practice specialty, location, and pharmacist referral habits (see details below) and were permuted block randomized to achieve 45%/45%/10% proportional distribution across the following arms respectively: (1) usual care (Control arm);  (2) multi-pronged CDS inclusive 
of a patient portal message about GDMT, an interruptive advisory upon chart entry advising clinicians of the need to optimize treatment,  and a BPA that links to a GDMT order set  
Geisinger – GREAT -HF Care Study Protocol  
Version 1, September 4, 2024  
Page 8 of 26 (CDS -OS arm ); and (3) multi-pronged CDS as in #2 but replacing GDMT order set with 
referral to integrated clinical pharmacist co -management  (CDS -MTDM arm ). Secondarily, 
each of the 5 clinical practice sites of roughly equal HFrEF patient loads were assigned to 
receive either an early or delayed education rollout.  
6.2 Randomization details  
Permuted blocked randomization was completed once at the beginning of the study.  
 Randomization was stratified as described below given concerns about imbalances in GDMT prescribing practices across clinics, certain roles, and current MTDM referral practices.  
 Clinicians were divided into HF specialists and non- HF specialists given differences in 
practicing patterns and propensity for increased GDMT prescribing patterns among specialists.  
 Within Non- HF specialists, randomization was stratified on the following variables:  
• Role: electrophysiology, interventional, non-invasive  
• MTDM referral history: none/0%, 1%-100% 
• Primary practice location: Northeast (GCMC, GWV, Orwigsburg), Central (GMC, Shamokin, Lewisburg), and West (GLH, Gray's Woods)  
 Within HF specialists, randomization was stratified on MTDM referral history. They were NOT stratified on practice location because there was not hypothesized to be a significant difference in practice as a function of location in this group.  We also generated permuted block randomized sequences for allocating any new clinicians who enter the system during the study. The study team collected information about role and primary practice location for any new clinician joining the system monthly. However, all new clinicians were assigned to the 0% MTDM referral history stratum, because new clinicians do not have an MTDM referral history in the system. Based on the pre-randomized sequence generated, the clinician would be assigned to an interventiona l arm. In generating 
these sequences, we assumed turnover rates would be equal across strata.  
 One hundred and fifty-five clinicians (103 current and 52 hypothetical) were randomized into control (45%), CDS -OS (45%) and CDS -MTDM arms (10%).  
 
6.3 Setting  
This study is being implemented at Geisinger, an integrated health delivery network in 
Central and Northeastern Pennsylvania, that serves more than 1 million patients per year . The 
system includes 10 hospital campuses, a health plan with more than half a million members, two research centers, an addiction treatment center, and the Geisinger Commonwealth School of Medicine. Geisinger’s Cardiology Department includes 35 outpatient clinics with over 120 providers engaged in care delivery.

Page 9 of 26 6.4 Targeted C linician I nclusion  
Clinicians practicing within a Geisinger cardiology clinic and car ing for patients with HFrEF 
were included. These include Cardiologist Physicians (MD, DO), Nurse Practitioners , and  
Physician Assistants . The lead P rincipal Investigator  on this study was  excluded from 
participation.  
 
6.5 Inclusion Criteria   
Patients  are included if: 
1. Patients are aged 18 years or older  
AND  
2. Completed visit at included Geisinger cardiology outpatient clinics (office visit or 
telemedicine)  
AND  
3. Patients’ clinicians are on a list of currently active Geisinger clinicians in outpatient cardiology clinics who can prescribe heart failure medications  
AND  
4a. Active problem list diagnosis of HFrEF at time of Cardiology clinic encounter,  
OR  4b. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) < 40: most recent to the cardiology clinic 
encounter within 2 years of the visit.   
 
6.6 Exclusion Criteria  
Currently in hospice or palliative care. (ICD 10 code: Z51.5)  
Patient has been prescribed medications from all four categories of GDMT , including ARNI 
specifically.  
Patient has a documented allergic reaction to each class of GDMT not presently prescribed.   
 6.7 Interventions  
The study includes the following three intervention arms, crossed with the presence or 
absence of focused education:  
Geisinger – GREAT -HF Care Study Protocol  
Version 1, September 4, 2024  
Page 10 of 26 1. Control:  Clinicians in this arm do not receive CDS and instead experience usual care. 
To index targeted patients, we initiated a BPA  during eligible encounters for patients 
meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria that is not seen by clinicians but is recorded with 
date and time for the study team.  No additional interventions are provided (i.e., no 
order sets or referral notices), although pharmacist services are available to clinicians that are allocated to this group. 
2. Multiprong CDS with GDMT order set  (CDS -OS), including: 
a. A patient -facing nudge to improve GDMT prescribing is delivered to patients 
14 days prior to their  scheduled cardiology encounters. The questionnaire 
includes a statement about their cardiac mortality risk and a prompt inquiring if the patient would like to  discuss GDMT options with their provider. For 
those without portal access, an in- clinic questionnaire delivered at the time of 
rooming with the nurse is  available.  See Figure 1 below.  
Figure 1.  Patient -facing questionnaire presented through patient portal.  
 
b. A clinician -facing “Heads -Up” BPA that fire s upon initial launch of the 
encounter in Epic. The BPA notifie s the clinician of the patient’s diagnosis of 
HFrEF and encourages assessment of present GDMT. Patient response to the pre-visit questionnaire is provided in alternate color font if completed in the 
affirmative by the patient. See Figures 2 and 3 bel ow.

information). 
 
Figure 3.  Provider-facing EHR alert upon entry into patient chart (with portal information). 
 
c. A BPA  during the encounter that supplies a multitude of relevant heart failure -
related metrics (e.g. Left Vent ricular Ejection Fraction, heart rate, glomerular 
filtration rate,  etc.) and indicates present use or non- use of GDMT  along with 
the medication information . If a class of GDMT is not active on the EHR 
medication list, a lternative text is conveyed  to the provider, in bolded and 
alternate color font, the mortality reductions expected with drug class 
initiation, as observed in published studies. The preferred action within the BPA is  to open the GDMT order set , which has been informed by prior 
studies and by behavioral science nudge principles. Classes least likely to be prescribed ( i.e., ARNI, SGLT2i , and MRA) a re listed before the more 
commonly prescribed EBBBs . One-click ordering options a re available within 
the order set  that link to a medication order if selected . If this option is not 
selected, the clinician must document their reason for not selecting a GDMT change in the acknowledgement section of the BPA. This section includes one option for patient declining treatment ( where a written reason is not required ), 
one for a contraindication to prescription (with required open text response), 
and an “other” category ( with required open text response). See figure 4 
below for one example of how a BPA may appear.

Page 12 of 26 Figure 4.  Provider-facing EHR alert upon order entry for GDMT prescribing. 
 
3. Multiprong CDS with referral to pharmacist co -management (CDS -MTDM) , 
including: 
a. A patient -directed questionnaire administered as above in the multi-prong 
CDS intervention.   
b. A clinician -facing “Heads -Up” BPA that fires upon initial launch of the 
encounter in Epic. The BPA notifies the clinician of the patient’s diagnosis of 
HFrEF and encourages referral to pharmacy for co -management. Patient 
responses to the pre-visit questionnaire are provided in alternate color font if completed  as affirmative  by the patient. See Figures 5 and 6 below.

information). 
 
Figure 6.  Provider-facing EHR alert upon entry into patient chart (without portal 
information). 
 
c. A BPA during the encounter that presents information exactly as in the 
GDMT order set version described above . The preferred action within the 
BPA is to refer patients to embedded pharmacist co- management , which is 
already highlighted for the clinician with an urgent referral sent to pharmacy. Pharmacists are expected to schedule patients within 3 days and meet with patients and optimize GDMT through a CPA . If this option i s not selected, the 
clinician must document their reason for not selecting referral  in the 
acknowledgement section of the BPA. This section included one option for patient declining treatment ( will manage  Rx on their  own ), and an “other” 
category ( with required open text response ). See Figure 7 below.

management.  
 
 
The main interruptive BPA is located in the Best Practice Advisory section of the 
patient charts. If no action is taken, the BPA fires at the time of first order or when the 
clinician tries to close out of the chart. Once an action has been taken , the BPA is 
suppressed for a period of 30 days for that patient (except for contraindications, which result in a 90-day lockout period), to avoid repetitive firing and resultant  alert 
fatigue. This suppression logic is applicable both to the order set and the referral -
specific BPAs.  A silent BPA is  triggered for clinicians assigned to the no- BPA 
control arm and for all included clinicians  and sites between the time when clinicians 
are randomized across the interventional and control  BPA s and in the 2 months prior, 
when the initial round of education has been  rolled out. This is intended to assist with 
tracking  prescribing behavior accurately .

The mechanism to refer patients to MTDM who were eligible was agreed upon by the 
study team and clinical leadership in advance of intervention implementation. Since individual clinician referral rates to MTDM varied prior to study initiation, those with none or few MTDM referrals were educated on the role of the MTDM pharmacist and referral process. To assist with implementation, feedback on referral rates among eligible patients is  provided to pharmacy leadership and clinical pharmacists 
throughout the study. In some cases, 1:1 discussions with clinicians on referring patients into MTDM care are made to address barriers  to placing MTDM referrals 
within  the CDS .  

Geisinger – GREAT -HF Care Study Protocol  
Version 1, September 4, 2024  
Page 17 of 26 4. Focused Education:  A series of focused, interactive education sessions were  
developed by study team members and clinical personnel to educate cardiology  
clinicians on why, when, and how to prescribe GDMT to patients. The objectives of 
the sessions are to : address previously identified barriers to GDMT such as  clinician 
knowledge and comfort with use of GDMT, encourage clinician prescribing of GDMT , and  improve attention  to MTDM to work cohesively to improve GDMT  
prescribing.  The target audience for this education program are Cardiology clinicians (physicians 
(MD, DO)  and advanced practitioners (PA, CRNP) ) at Geisinger. Three  clinics were 
selected for early education (i.e. before additional CDS and pharmacist r eferral 
interventions) and t wo clinics were reserved for late education ( timed to occur after 
sufficient time has elapsed to assess the impact of the early education on its own ). 
The early education programs were delivered over one month to each clinic with in-person attendance being encouraged .  
 
Topics delivered  in the early education sessions included: 
1. Sacubitril / Valsartan (ARNI) in CHF  
2. SGLT2 inhibitors in CHF  
a. SGLT2i in Cardiovascular Disease & HFrEF  
b. SGLT2i in HFrEF with Diabetes: What the Cardiologist should know  
3. Management of HFrEF and chronic kidney disease (CKD)  
4. Geisinger Pharmacist role in HFrEF  
 The early education sessions were delivered live , at each clinic location separately on 
a given date (either in -person or virtually depending on clinic preference). 
Participants were encouraged by the lead PI to attend the live sessions if they were 
being offered at their clinic location . Continuing medical education (CME) credits 
were provided to attendees where applicable and lunch was provided during the live  
sessions. Presentations lasted  about 30 minutes with a question- and-answer session to 
follow. An RSVP request was  asked  of those attending. Those missing their  sessions 
were invited to a virtual session  being held to try to increase attendance rates . The 
virtual sessions were recorded. The same approach will be used for delayed education. 
 
6.8 Outcome Measures  
Primary effectiveness  outcome:  HF GDMT prescription increased (new class added, dose 
titrated upward on existing medication, or switch to ARNI from ACEi/ARB), within 30 days of index visit.   Secondary effectiveness outcomes :
 
• HF GDMT prescription increased (new class added, dose titrated upward on existing medication, or switch to ARNI from ACEi/ARB), within 60 and 90 days of index visit. 
• Addition of SGLT2i or ARNI (including switch from ACEi/ARB to ARNI), within 30, 60, and 90 days of index visit.  This will be analyzed primarily using the entire eligible 
Geisinger – GREAT -HF Care Study Protocol  
Version 1, September 4, 2024  
Page 18 of 26 sample and secondarily only among those who have not already been prescribed SGLT2i 
or ARNI prior to the intervention. 
 Other pre- specified effectiveness outcomes : 
• All-cause mortality or emergency visit or hospitalization for heart failure, within 365 
days of index visit. This will be assessed as patient death (yes/no), patient with emergency visit with a primary diagnosis of heart failure (yes/no), or admission for inpatient hospitalization with primary diagnosis of heart failure (yes/no). 
• Optimal GDMT dosing (at least 50% of target dose) on all classes (with or without ARNI), within 180 days of index visit. 
• Increased dosing or initiation for each individual class, within 180 days of index visit. 
• Decreased dosing or removal for each individual class, within 180 days of index visit. 
• Timing of increases in GDMT over 180 days since index visit. 
• Economic outcomes such as (1) return on investment (ROI) and (2) cost effectiveness (CE) of CDS and MTDM interventions compared with standard of care (using modeling approaches specified in the ROI and CE  analysis section above) . 
 
Implementation Outcomes  
• We used the RE -AIM framework to evaluate Reach, Adoption, Implementation and 
Maintenance for each interventional strategy  (effectiveness is measured as noted above).

7. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN  
7.1 Power analysis 
Data will be collected from 4,300 patients assigned to the clinicians in the study. With CDS-
OS and CDS- MTDM  (versus control), we expect to have 80% power to detect approximately 
5 and 9 percentage-point increases, respectively, in prescribing GDMT within 30 days, at two-tailed p < .05 with robust standard errors clustered at the clinician level . With education 
versus delayed education, we expect to have 80% power to detect an approximately 5.5 percentage-point increase in prescribing GDMT, with robust standard errors clustered at the clinician level. Power analyses were conducted using DeclareDesign .

7.2 Analysis details 
Analyses described below represent our planned analyses assuming statistical assumptions are met. If assumptions are not met, we will run alternative tests appropriate for the outcome distribution (e.g., non- parametric tests).  
 The analyses will be conducted based on the principle of intention- to-treat (ITT). All patients 
who met the inclusion criteria will be included in the analyses in the arms to which they were assigned. Likewise, all clinicians will be included in analysis in their assigned education arms, regardless of whether they attended their education sessions. Because exposure to pharmacists is dependent upon action by a clinician to refer, we will also conduct a per protocol sensitivity analysis for patients who were consulted to pharmacist care and those patients seen by the pharmacist.    Two-tailed p -values < 0.05 will be used to determine statistical significance in all analyses.  
 
7.2.1 Descriptive statistics  
Descriptive statistics will be computed for baseline socioeconomic and demographic 
characteristics (i.e., sex, age, race, ethnicity, insurance, etc.) , including broken out across 
study arms, with differences compared using the appropriate statistical tests: two -tailed 
Student’s t-tests will be used for continuous data, column proportion z tests or χ2 for categorical data, and Mann -Whitney for non- normal quantitative data.  
 
7.2.2 Approach for comparisons across intervention arms  
CDS analyse s: We will test whether each outcome differs  as a function of each CDS active 
arm (CDS -OS and CDS -MTDM)  relative to no -CDS control. Regressions will include as 
covariates education arm  and interactions between CDS and education . We will retain both 
terms if the interaction is significant and retain the main effect if only it is significant. The 
education variable in CDS analyses will be coded as delayed education (baseline), early 
education, other (for clinicians who were not in the system early enough to be included in an education arm, to avoid either diluting or biasing the education effects).   
Geisinger – GREAT -HF Care Study Protocol  
Version 1, September 4, 2024  
Page 20 of 26 As an exploratory analysis, we will compare CDS- MTDM  against CDS -OS to see which is  
most effective.  
 
Additionally, covariates will be added to exploratory versions of the final models as sensitivity analyses, to adjust for measured differences across clinicians, such as role, number of patients seen, and baseline rates of prescribing each of the GDMT classes. We have no a 
priori  hypotheses about the moderating effects of these covariates. 
 
Education analyses: We will test whether each outcome differs as a function of early education relative to delayed education. Regressions will include as covariates CDS arm and interactions between CDS and education. We will retain both terms if the interaction is significant and retain the main effect if only it is significant. Assignment to early versus delayed education is not random; therefore, regression analysis comparing education to no-education controls will adjust for as many relevant covariates as possible, including baseline prescribing rates.  
 
In these analyses, we will exclude clinicians who were not present throughout the data 
collection period, beginning at assignment to early education. That is, we only intend to include clinicians in early and delayed education arms who theoretically could have been exposed to the education and who then had time to treat patients based on wha t they learned.   
 
7.2.3 Regression  Specifications  
For all outcomes except timing of GDMT increases  and ROI outcomes, ordinary least 
squares (OLS) regressions will be run
15 with heteroskedasticity -robust standard errors 
clustered at the clinician level (to account for clustering of patients within clinicians). We 
will also explore the effect of clustering standard errors at the clinic level.  
 We will run a survival analysis to assess timing of GDMT increases.   
 Cost and outcomes estimate  for the cost-effectiveness model will be obtained using EHR 
data,  claims data , and literature -based  sources.  These data will be used to develop a decision 
tree analytical model with a state transition Markov cohort simulation to compute 
incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICER), cost -effectiveness acceptance curves will be 
generated for all cost -effectiveness measurements. The effects of uncertainties from the 
model parameters will be evaluated by deterministic and stochastic s ensitivity analyses. 
Following the World Health Organization’s guidelines,
16,17 we will define the willingness -to-
pay (WTP) threshold as 1 to 3 times the local gross domestic product per capita.16,18 
Interventions with an ICER below the threshold will be considered cost- effective. We will 
also compare the total dollar amount spent on implementing this program against the cost savings, if any, attributable to the interventions (CDS- OS + CDS -MTDM) to calculate the 
corresponding ROI.   
Geisinger – GREAT -HF Care Study Protocol  
Version 1, September 4, 2024  
Page 21 of 26 7.3 Variables  
We will explore demographic information, past medical history, clinical procedures, 
medications, encounters (ambulatory, ED, and hospital), and administrative claims (inclusive of costs of care) among the HF population. Examples of variables of interest include age, sex, BMI, comorbid conditions, medication use, healthcare utilization, and costs of care.   
7.4 Data Sources  
A data broker in Geisinger’s Phenomic Data Analytics and Clinical Data Core (PACDC) will 
extract EHR data, Geisinger Health Plan (GHP) medical and prescription claims, and patient reported data necessary for the study. Approved study personnel may need to consult individual patient medical records for manual chart review and abstraction if further investigation/validation of the data is needed.  Protected Health Information (PHI) will be limited to medical record numbers (MRNs), dates, GHP insurance numbers, and department and clinician IDs. Approved study personnel conducting the manual chart reviews will be exposed to other elements of PHI, but these elements will not be collected as part of chart abstraction. In addition to PHI, we will also collect data including but not limited to the following: 
• Demographics (e.g., age, sex) 
• Vitals (e.g., body mass index, blood pressure) 
• Encounter and Problem list diagnosis 
• Patient -reported data  
• Health behaviors (e.g., smoking status) 
• Medications (ordered and dispensed) 
• Procedures (e.g., surgery) 
• Laboratory values 
• Utilization of health services (e.g., inpatient, outpatient, emergency room) 
• Cost of care  
• Social determinants of health data (when available)  
 
7.5 Data Management  Members of the Geisinger approved study team will coordinate with the data broker to pull 
the necessary data for the study. Members of the Geisinger approved study team who have been trained in chart abstraction will conduct chart reviews as needed. Study data will only be directly accessible to Geisinger approved study team members and stored on password protected computers and/or locked in filing cabinets. Any data shared externally will be de-identified and/or aggregated.   
7.6 Record Retention  
Records of data generated during the study may be retained indefinitely.

Anticipated risk to participants will be minimal. This study will not affect patient care or 
access to care. While PHI will be requested, it will only be available to approved study team members to limit the risk of breaching confidentiality. All electronic study data will be kept in password-protected locations and any hard copy data will be locked in filing cabinets and only accessible to approved study team members on an as needed basis. Only group- level 
information without personal identifiers will be included when presenting results or submitting manuscripts for publication. We intend to permanently and securely archive a fully deidentified dataset at a research repository such as Open Science Framework (OSF) in order to be consistent with the best practices for open and reproducible science.  
8.1 Patient Information  All parties will comply with all applicable laws, including laws regarding the implementation 
of organizational and technical measures to ensure protection of patient personal data. Such measures will include omitting patient names or other directly identifiable data in any reports, publications, or other disclosures, except where required by applicable laws.   The personal data will be stored at the study site in  electronic and/or paper  form and will be  
password- protected and/or secured in a locked filing cabinet to  ensure that only authorized 
study staff have access.  The study site will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that the personal data can be recovered in the event of disaster. In the event of a potential personal data breach, the study site shall be responsible for determining whether a personal data breach has in fact occurred and, if so, providing breach notifications as required by law.  
9. PLANS FOR DISSEMINATING STUDY RESULTS  
We plan to disseminate our findings as abstracts and presentations at national meeting(s) and 
in peer -reviewed journal(s). 
10. PROJECT STATUS  
Early education was launched on 8/1/2023 and data collection is ongoing. CDS and MTDM arms launched on 10/9/2023. Outcome data have not yet been extracted or examined as a function of study arms, except in a very limited way for the initial BPA investigation described below.    We removed non -telemedicine telephonic encounters as an inclusion criterion partway into 
data collection (as of  11/4/2023), based on immediate post-launch investigations of BPAs 
that were intended to help ensure BPAs were functioning correctly and firing appropriately in terms of patients, clinicians, and encounters. These investigations included chart reviews to examine ack nowledgement reasons and prescribing patterns in the referral and order set 
arms. The results suggested that telephonic encounters were inappropriate occasions in which to expect clinicians to make prescription adjustments, given other pressing reasons for a majority of these calls (e.g., review of lab results, scheduling appointments) and very low rates of prescribing during these encounters. Prescribing rates were not compared between the no-BPA control arm and the CDS arms, and no other outcomes were examined. 
Geisinger – GREAT -HF Care Study Protocol  
Version 1, September 4, 2024  
Page 23 of 26 Telemedicine telephonic encounters remain a valid inclusion criterion, as those are scheduled 
appointments appropriate for prescribing.    Within the referral arm only, data on referral rates across clinicians were monitored and chart reviews conducted to better understand where and why referrals to MTDM were not occurring for certain clinicians. These data were used to inform follow-up by MT DM 
pharmacists and potential escalation by clinical leadership to overcome lack of awareness and educate clinicians on the purpose and appropriate use of the referral. For example, if referral  rate to MTDM  for a given clinician was below 50% in February 2024, the study PI 
contacted the clinicians to educate or r emind them about the benefits of pharmacy co -
management . 
 Delayed education sessions began in early August 2024. This was anticipated to occur after 
final data were collected, but enrollment was still incomplete at the time. We will limit our primary education analysis so it only includes encounters before the delayed education sessions began (i.e. the period where the delayed education group had not yet experienced education), so the delayed education encounters can be used as controls. However, follow -up 
exploratory analyses will include encounters after delayed education so we can examine main effects of delayed education, or interactions between delayed education and ongoing CDS 
interventions.

3 INTRODUCTION  
3.1 Overview of Psoriasis  
Psoriasis is a chronic immunological disease characterized by infiltration of the skin with 
activated T cells and by abnormal keratinocyte proliferation and differentiation, resulting 
in marked inflammation and thickening of the epidermis.  Psoriasis affec ts 1-3% of the 
world population, making it one of the most prevalent inflammatory immunological 
diseases.1 There are several clinical subtypes of psoriasis: plaque, guttate, 
erythrodermic, inverse, and pustular.  Plaque psoriasis is the most common type of 
 
 
AP-CL-PSOR -PI-13156                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]    Version 1 30 December 2017

 psoriasis affecting 75 -80% of psoriasis sufferers. ² It presents as raised silvery scale, 
which can cover large areas, with underlying erythema, itching, and discomfort.  
 
3.2  Rationale for Treating Plaque Psoriasis with OTEZLA ® + Enstilar®  
OTEZLA ® and Enstilar®  are both ef fective in treating psoriasis.  The pivotal OTEZLA ® 
Phase III trials (ESTEEM)  determined that apremilast was effective in treating moderate 
to severe plaque psoriasis.  The primary endpoint at week 16 demonstrated significantly 
more apremilast -treated patients (33.1%) achieved the primary end point (PASI -75 at 
week 16) than did placebo patients (5.3%).3  Combination regimens that utilize a 
systemic agent with light therapy and/or a topical agent are becoming the standard of 
care in the United States4 and Europe5, confirming the observation of Lebwohl et al6 in 
2004 , that the use of two or more therapies to treat patients with moderate to severe 
psoriasis seems to be the rule rather than the exception.  Topical steroids play a n in 
important role in the long  term management of psoriasis and data from the COBRA trial 
suggests that super potent topical corticosteroids are appropriate and well tolerated for 
use when added to existing therapeutic regimens i.e. phototherapy, systemic and 
biologic therapy.7   A post hoc analysis of the Phase 3 ESTEEM 1 trial of apremilast was 
conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of apremilast with and without topical 
therapies and/or UVB phototherapy.  The analysis focused on the sub -group of patients 
who did not achieve PA SI 75 at week 32.  At week 52, more patients receiving topical  
therapy and/ or phototherapy  achieved PASI 75 than did patients with apremilast alone.8  
This study is being conducted to determine if adding topical Enstilar ® to Otezla® 
therapy can help patients who received a partial response at week 8 reach PASI 75 by 
week 12.  
 
4. STUDY OBJECTIVE  
To explore the effectiveness and safety of combin ing OTEZLA ® and Enstilar® and to 
determine if add -on Enstilar® therapy can help partial responders at week 8 achieve 
PASI 75 at week 12.  
 
5. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan  
50 subjects affected with plaque psoriasis with body surface are a greater than or equal 
to 10%,  and physician’s global assessment greater than or equal to 3 and PASI greater  
than or equal to 12  will receive OTEZLA ® 30 mg twice daily for 8 weeks.  
 
Patients who do not achieve at least a PASI 25 at week 8 will be discontinued from 
treatment and study procedures.  
 
AP-CL-PSOR -PI-13156                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]    Version 1 30 December 2017

 At week 8, subj ects who have achieved a PASI 25 -74 will receive Enstilar ® 
(calcipotriene and betamethasone dipropionate) Foam, 0.005%/0.064% once daily for 4 
weeks in addition to continuing OTEZLA ® BID.  These patients will then discontinue 
Enstilar ® at week 12 and remain on OTEZLA ® monotherapy through week 16.  
 
Patients who achieve PASI 75 at week 8 will remain enrolled in the study and continue 
OTEZLA ® 30mg BID through week 16.  These subjects will not receive Enstilar ® add-
on therapy.

5.5 STUDY TREATMENT  
5.5.1 Apremilast Treatment ( OTEZLA ®) 
5.5.1.1  Apremiliast ( OTEZLA ®) Description  
OTEZLA ® is manufactured by Celgene Corporation.  The active ingredient in OTEZLA ® 
tablets is apremilast.  Apremilast is a small -molecule inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4 
(PDE 4) specific for cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP).  The chemical name of 
apremilast is acetamide, N-[2-[(1S) -1-(3-ethoxy -4-methoxyphenyl) -2-
(methylsulfonyl)ethyl] -2,3-dihydro -1,3-dioxo -1H-isoindol -4-yl].PDE4 inhibition results in 
increased intracellular cAMP levels.   The specific mechanism(s) by which apremilast 
exerts its therapeutic act ion in psoriasis patients is not well defined.  
AP-CL-PSOR -PI-13156                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]    Version 1 30 December 2017  
 
12 
  
5.5.1.2  OTEZLA ® Warnings and Precautions  
 
Diarrhea, Nausea, and Vomiting  
There have been postmarketing reports of severe diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting associated with 
the use of OTEZLA. Most events occurred within the first few weeks of treatment. In some cases 
patients were hospitalized. Patients 65 years of age or older and patients taking medications that 
can lead to volume depletion or hypotension may be at a higher risk of complications from 
severe diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting. Monitor patients who are more susceptible to complications 
of diarrhea or vomiting. Patients wh o reduced dosage or discontinued OTEZLA generally 
improved quickly. Consider OTEZLA dose reduction or suspension if patients develop severe 
diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting.  
 
Depression  
Treatment with OTEZLA is associated with an increase in adverse reactions of depression. 
Before using OTEZLA in patients with a history of depression and/or suicidal thoughts or 
behavior prescribers should carefully weigh the risks and benefits of treatment with OTEZLA in 
such patients. Patients, their caregivers, and families should be advised of the need to be alert for 
the emergence or worsening of depression, suicidal thoughts or other mood changes, and if such 
changes occur to contact their healthcare provider. Prescribers should carefully evaluate the risks 
and benefits of continuing treatment with OTEZLA if such events occur.  
 
Psoriatic arthritis  
During the 0 to 16 week placebo -controlled period of the 3 controlled clinical trials, 1.0% 
(10/998) of subjects treated with OTEZLA reported depression or depressed mood compared to 
0.8% (4/495) treated with placebo. During the clinical trials, 0.3% (4/14 41) of subjects treated 
with OTEZLA discontinued treatment due to depression or depressed mood compared with none 
in placebo treated subjects (0/495). Depression was reported as serious in 0.2% (3/1441) of 
subjects exposed to OTEZLA, compared to none in pl acebo -treated subjects (0/495). Instances of 
suicidal ideation and behavior have been observed in 0.2% (3/1441) of subjects while receiving 
AP-CL-PSOR -PI-13156                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]    Version 1 30 December 2017

 OTEZLA, compared to none in placebo treated subjects (0/495). In the clinical trials, 2 subjects 
who received placebo committed suicide compared to none in OTEZLA -treated subjects.  
 
Psoriasis  
 During the 0 to 16 week placebo -controlled period of the 3 controlled clinical trials, 1.3% 
(12/920) of subjects treated with OTEZLA reported depression compared to 0.4% (2/506) treated 
with placebo. During the clinical trials, 0.1% (1/1308) of subjects t reated with OTEZLA 
discontinued treatment due to depression compared with none in placebo -treated subjects 
(0/506). Depression was reported as serious in 0.1% (1/1308) of subjects exposed to OTEZLA, 
compared to none in placebo -treated subjects (0/506). Ins tances of suicidal behavior have been 
observed in 0.1% (1/1308) of subjects while receiving OTEZLA, compared to 0.2% (1/506) in 
placebotreated subjects. In the clinical trials, one subject treated with OTEZLA attempted suicide 
while one who received placeb o committed suicide.  
 
Weight Decrease  
During the controlled period of the studies in psoriatic arthritis (PsA), weight decrease between 
5%-10% of body weight was reported in 10% (49/497) of subjects treated with OTEZLA 30 mg 
twice daily compared to 3.3% (16/495) treated with placebo [see Adver se Reactions (6.1)]. 
During the controlled period of the trials in psoriasis, weight decrease between 5% -10% of body 
weight occurred in 12% (96/784) of subjects treated with OTEZLA compared to 5% (19/382) 
treated with placebo. Weight decrease of ≥10% of bo dy weight occurred in 2% (16/784) of 
subjects treated with OTEZLA 30 mg twice daily compared to 1% (3/382) subjects treated with 
placebo. Patients treated with OTEZLA should have their weight monitored regularly. If 
unexplained or clinically significant we ight loss occurs, weight loss should be evaluated, and 
discontinuation of OTEZLA should be considered.  
 
Drug Interactions  
Co-administration of strong cytochrome P450 enzyme inducer, rifampin, resulted in a reduction 
of systemic exposure of apremilast, which may result in a loss of efficacy of OTEZLA. 
Therefore, the use of cytochrome P450 enzyme inducers (e.g., rifampin, pheno barbital, 
carbamazepine, phenytoin) with OTEZLA is not recommended . .

investigational product or device may be used during the study.   
5.6  Study Procedures and Assessments  
This protocol will consist of a Screening Period (0 -30 days), followed by an open -label 
treatment period of OTEZLA ® for 8 weeks (Period A). At week 8 (Part B), subjects PASI 
scores will be evaluated and patients who achieve PASI 25 -74 will be given add -on 
Enstilar ® treatment for 4 weeks (through week 12)  followed by OTEZLA® monotherapy 
through week 16 .  
Subjects who do not achieve PASI 25 at week 8 will be discontinued from the study and 
follow standard of care from their provider.  
Subjects who achieve PASI 75 at week 8 will remain on OTEZLA ® monotherapy and will 
not initiate treatment with Enstilar ®.  
5.6.1  Informed Consent  
This Study will be conducted in compliance with CFR Title 21, Part 50 (Informed Consent 
of Human Subjects).  Informed consent will be obtained from each subject in writing 
before participation in the Study.  A signed copy of the Informed Consent Form will be 
provided to each subject.  A provision to obtain a signed authorization to provide protected 
health information to the study sponsor, internal quality assurance agencies, health 
insurance agencies, and other parties as specified in the Federal Health In surance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy regulation will be included in the 
Informed Consent Document.  HIPAA authorization is voluntary.  However, since the use 
and release of health information is critical to the conduct of the study, s ubjects who do 
not provide authorization to use and disclose their health information will not be enrolled 
into the study.  Subjects who withdraw their authorization to use and release health

16 
 information during study participation will be formally discontinued from the study.  The 
investigator may use and release at any time all the information collected prior to a 
subject’s withdrawal of the authorization to all authorized parties to satisfy s cientific, 
regulatory, and financial concerns.  
5.6.2  Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects’ eligibility to participate in the study will be determined according to the Inclusion 
and Exclusion Criteria during the screening period (0 – 30 days prior to the first dose of 
the study drug).  Subjects who ultimately do not satisfy the eligibil ity criteria except 
changing treatments and undergoing a washout period, will not be enrolled into the study.  
Subjects who need to meet eligibility requirements will be asked to make the necessary 
changes.  Subjects who agree and comply will be re -evaluat ed prior to Baseline.   
5.6.3  Demographics and Medical History  
The following information will be obtained for each subject during screening: date of birth, 
sex, race/ ethnic origin, medical and surgical history, including history of alcohol and drug 
abuse, year of diagnosis of plaque psoriasis, and current and previou s anti -psoriasis 
treatments.  All current therapies for other medical conditions will be documented. Medical 
history will be reviewed and updated at the Baseline Visit to ensure that the patient 
remains eligible to participate in the study.  
5.6.4  Urine Pregnancy Test  
Pregnancy testing (urine β -human chorionic gonadotrophin [β -HCG]) will be conducted in 
all female subjects, except those without childbearing potential  at Screening  (-30 to -1) 
and Baseline Visit s (Week 0) prior to the first dose of OTEZLA ®, and then again at week  
16.  An interim urine pregnancy test may be performed if there is reason to believe the 
subject may have become pregnant during the study.  Subjects with a positive pregnancy 
test will not be eligible to participate or to continue to receive study treatment.  
 
A female of childbearing potential is a sexually mature female who 1) has not undergone 
a hysterectomy (the surgical removal of the uterus) or bilateral oophorectomy (the surgical 
removal of both ovaries) or 2) has not been postmenopausal for at least 24 c onsecutive 
months  (that is, has had menses at any time during the preceding 24 consecutive 
months). The female subject’s chosen form of contraception must be effective by the time 
the female subject is randomized into the study (for example, hormonal cont raception 
should be initiated at least 28 days before randomization).

17 
 5.6.5  Physical Examination  
A physical examination, including vital signs mea surements, will be performed according 
to the schedule of events.  Resting pulse and blood pressure (systolic and diastolic) 
measurements should be obtained in the sitting position with the subject resting for at 
least 5 minutes before measurements being taken. The physical examination should 
include a thorough ev aluation of the subject's skin. Blood pressure and pulse should be 
measured before blood draws are performed.  Any clinically significant abnormalit ies 
discovered during physical examinations after the Screening / Baseline v isit should be 
documented and evaluated as potential adverse events.  
5.6.6  Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA)  
PGA will be determined for all subjects throughout the study. PGA is a 6 point scale that 
records the overall disease severity at each clinical e valuation based on the average  
degree of erythema, induration, and scaling  of areas affected by psoriasis.  PGA uses a 
scale of 0 = Clear , 1 = Minimal , 2 = Mild, 3 = Moderate, 4 = Severe , and 5 = Very Severe . 
See Appendix C 
 
5.6.7 Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI)  
PASI will be determined for all subjects throughout the study.  Four anatomical sites 
(head, trunk, upper and lower limbs) are assessed for  erythema, thickness, and scaling 
on a scale of 0 -4 and degree of skin surface area  on a scale of 6 .  The PASI is a validated 
instrument that has become standard in clinical trials for psoriasis. The sum of the scores 
are then totaled for the PASI score. Psoriasis Area Severity Index scores range from 0 to 
72, with higher scores reflecting greater disease severity.9 See Appendix D  
 
 
5.6.8  Body Surface Area (BSA)  
BSA will be determined for all subjects throughout the study. The subjects palm will be 
selected for the measuring unit of body surface area.  The physician will equate the 
number of palms affected by psoriasis to derive the BSA total.  
5.6.9  Patient Reported Outcomes  
Subjects will complete the PRO’s based on the schedule of assessments . Questionnaires 
should be prior to medical procedures and clinical evaluations.   
Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI)10 to assess symptoms and impacts of 
dermatologic diseases on quality of life.   See Appendix E  
AP-CL-PSOR -PI-13156                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]    Version 1 30 December 2017  
 
18 
  
5.6.10   Early Discontinuation Procedures  
Subjects will be prematurely discontinued from the study under the following conditions:  
1. Subject does not reach PASI 25 or greater at week 8 
2. Subject requests to withdraw from the study.  
3. Subject is noncompliant with protocol schedule, re strictions, and/or 
requirements as deemed per investigator.  
4. Subject experiences an adverse event that makes it difficult or intolerable for 
the subject to continue treatment, or increases risk to the subject, or interferes 
with the investigator’s ability to clinically evaluate the progress of the subject’s 
treatmen t. 
5. Subject begins an unapproved concomitant therapy for psoriasis or another 
medical condition that may increase risk to the subject if continuing study 
treatment.  
6. Subject cannot be reached / lost to follow -up. 
7. The study investigator suspends or terminates the study.  
8. Other unanticipated reason.  
 
Any subject who prematurely discontinues the study should complete the week 16 (End 
of Study) assessments.  Any subject who withdraws consent to participate in the study will 
be removed from further treatment and/or study observation immediately upon the date 
of request.  
6 ADVERSE EVENTS  
An adverse event (AE) is any noxious, unintended, or untoward medical occurrence 
occurring at any dose that may appear or worsen in a subject during the course of a 
study. It may be a new intercurrent illness, a worsening concomitant illness, an injury, or  
any concomitant impairment of the subject’s health, including laboratory test values (as 
specified by the criteria below), regardless of etiology. Any medical condition that was 
present prior to study treatment and that remains unchanged or improved shoul d not be 
recorded as an AE. If there is a worsening of that medical condition this should be 
considered an AE. A diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the 
Case Report Form rather than the individual signs or symptoms of the diagnosis o r 
syndrome.  
All AEs will be recorded by the Investigator(s) from the time of signing the informed 
consent through the end of the designated follow -up period.  
 
AP-CL-PSOR -PI-13156                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]    Version 1 30 December 2017  
 
19 
 Abnormal laboratory values defined as adverse events  
An abnormal laboratory value is considered to be an AE if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by any of the following:  
• Results in discontinuation from the study.  
• Requires treatment, modification/interruption of study drug dose, or any other 
therapeutic intervention.  
• Is judged by the Investigator(s) to be of significant clinical importance.  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, then only the 
diagnosis or syndrome should be recorded on the AE page of the CRF. If the 
abnormality was not a part of a diagnosis or syndrome, then the laboratory abnormality 
should be recorded as the AE.  
Serious adverse event  
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any AE which:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening (i.e., in the opinion of the Investigator(s) the subject is at 
immediate risk of death from the AE)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (a substantial 
disruption of the subject’s ability to conduct normal life functions)  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Constitutes an important medical event  
Important medical events are defined as those occurrences that may not be 
immediately life threatening or result in death, hospitalization, or disability, but may 
jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed above.  Medical and sc ientific judgment should be exercised in 
deciding whether such an AE should be considered serious.  
Events not considered to be SAEs are hospitalizations which: were planned before 
entry into the clinical study; are for elective treatment of a condition unrelated to the 
studied indication or its treatment; occur on an emergency outpatient basis and do no t 
result in admission (unless fulfilling other criteria above); are part of the normal 
treatment or monitoring of the studied indication and are not associated with any 
deterioration in condition.  
If an AE is considered serious, both the AE pages of the CRF and the SAE Report Form 
must be completed.  
For each SAE, the Investigator(s) will provide information on severity, start and stop 
dates, relationship to study drug, action taken regarding study drug, and outcome.  
 
AP-CL-PSOR -PI-13156                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]    Version 1 30 December 2017  
 
20 
 Classification of severity  
For both AEs and SAEs, the investigator(s) must assess the severity of the event. The 
AEs will be evaluated for severity according to the following scale:  
Grade 1 = Mild  
Grade 2 = Moderate  
Grade 3 = Severe  
Classification of Relationship/Causality of adverse events (SAE/AE) to study drug  
The Investigator(s) must determine the relationship between the administration of study 
drug and the occurrence of an AE/SAE as Not Suspected or Suspected as defined 
below:  
Not 
suspected : The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study 
drug administration makes a causal relationship 
unlikely or remote , or other medications, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying conditions provide a sufficient 
explanation for the observed event  
Suspected:  The temporal relationship of the adverse event to study 
drug administration makes a causal relationship 
possible,  and other medications, therapeutic 
interventions, or underlying conditions do not provide a 
sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
Immediate reporting of serious adverse events  
Any AE that meets the any criterion for a SAE requires the completion of an SAE Report 
Form in addition to being recorded on the AE pages of the CRF.  The Investigator(s) is 
required to ensure that the data on these forms is accurate and consistent.  This applies 
to all SAEs, regardless of relationship to study drug, that occur during the study, those 
made known to the Investigator(s) within 30 days after  a subject’s last dose of study 
drug, and those made known to the investigator(s) at anytime that are su spected of 
being related to study drug.  
The SAE must be reported immediately (i.e., within 24 hours of the Investigators’ 
knowledge of the event) to Celgene Safety by facsimile.  A written report (prepared by 
the Investigator(s) using an SAE Report Form or a 3500A Medwatch form  is to be 
faxed t o Safety (see below for contact information).

21 
 E-mail:             drugsafety@celgene.com  
 
The SAE report should provide a detailed description of the SAE.  If a subject has died 
and an autopsy has been performed, copies of the autopsy report and death certificate 
are to be sent to Celgene as soon as these become available.  Any follow -up data will 
be detailed in a subsequent SAE Report Form or Medwatch form and sent to Celgene.  
The Investigator(s) is responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board/Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) of the SAE and providing them with all relevant initial and follow -
up information about the event. The Investigator(s) must keep copies of all SAE 
information, including correspondence with Celgene and the IRB/IEC, on file.  All SAEs 
that have not resolved upon discontinuation of the subject’s participation in the study 
must be followed until either the event resolves completely, stabilizes/resolves wi th 
sequelae, or returns to baseline (if a baseline value is available).  
Pregnancies  
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless 
of age or disease state) of a female subject or the female partner of a male subject  
occurring while the subject is on study drug, or within 30 days of the subject’s last dose 
of study drug, are considered immediately reportable events.  Study drug is to be 
discontinued immediately and the subject instructed to return any unused portion of the 
study drug to the investigator(s).  The pregnancy, suspected p regnancy, or positive 
pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Safety immediately facsimile using the 
Pregnancy Report form provided by Celgene.  
The female should be referred to an obstetrician -gynecologist experienced in 
reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling.  
The Investigator(s) will follow the female subject until completion of the pregnancy, and 
must notify Celgene Safety of the outcome of the pregnancy as a follow -up on the follow 
up Pregnancy Reporting form.  
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as a SAE 
(i.e., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion [any congenital anomaly detected in an 
aborted fetus is to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly 
[inclu ding that in an aborted fetus]), the Investigator(s) should follow the procedures for 
reporting SAEs (i.e., report the event to Celgene Safety by facsimile within 24 hours of 
the Investigator’s knowledge of the event).  
In the case of a live “normal” birth, Celgene Safety should be advised by facsimile within 
24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the event.  
All neonatal deaths that occur within 30 days of birth should be reported, without regard 
to causality, as SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator(s) 
suspects is related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should als o be reported to 
Celgene Safety by facsimile within 24 hours of the Investigators’ knowledge of the 
event.  
AP-CL-PSOR -PI-13156                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]    Version 1 30 December 2017  
 
22 
 If the female is found not to be pregnant, any determination regarding the subject’s 
continued participation in the study will be determined by the Investigator.  
Contraception Education  
The risks to a fetus or to a nursing child from apremilast are not known at this time.  
Results of the animal and in vitro studies can be found in the IB.    
All females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must use one of the approved 
contraceptive options as described in eligibility criteria  while on investigational product 
and for at least 28 days after administration of the last dose of the investigational 
product . 
When a female subject of childbearing potential’s contraceptive measures or ability to 
become pregnant changes at the time of study entry or at any time during the study, the 
Investigator will educate the subject regarding options and correct and consisten t use of 
effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully prevent pregnancy.  
 
Overdose  
 
Abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity, or toxicity to an investigational product should be 
reported as an  AE. Overdose, accidental or intentional, whether or not it is associated 
with an AE should be  reported as an AE.  Any sequela of an accidental or intentional 
overdose of an investigational product should be reported as an AE.  
 
If the sequela of an overdose is an SAE, then the sequela must be reported on  
an SAE report form. The overdose resulting in the SAE should be identified as the 
cause of the event on the SAE report form but should not be reported as an SAE itself.  
 
In the event of an overdose, the subject should be monitored as appropriate and should 
receive  supportive measures as necessary. There is no known specific antidote for 
apremilast overdose.  Actual treatment should depend on the severity of the clinical 
situation and the judgment and  experience of the treating physician.  
 
Overdose for this protocol, on a per dose basis, is defined as ingestion of any more than 
the amount prescribed of apremilast (or matching placebo) tablets in any 24 hour period 
whether by accident or intentionally.  
 
 
7 INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  HANDLING  
 
7.1   Investigational Product Receipt  
At study initiation and as needed thereafter, OTEZLA ® and Enstilar ® will be shipped to a 
responsible person (e.g., a pharmacist) at the investigator's institution, who will check the 
amount and condition of the drug, and maintain a record of this information.   
AP-CL-PSOR -PI-13156                              [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]    Version 1 30 December 2017  
 
23 
  
7.2   Investigational Product Storage  
Investigational product will be stored per the storage conditions identified on drug label.  
At the study site, all IP will be stored in a locked, safe area to prevent unauthorized 
access.  
Records of the actual storage conditions during the period of the study will be maintained.  
 
8 RECORD RETENTION  
The investigator must retain these documents according  to local laws or requirements. 
Essential documents include, but are not limited to, the following:  
  
• Signed informed consent documents for all subjects;  
• Subject identification code list, screening log (if applicable), and enrollment log;  
• Record of all communications between the Investigator and the IRB/EC;  
Composition of the IRB/EC;  
• Record of all communications bet ween the Investigator and Celgene.  
• List of Sub -investigators and other appropriately qualified persons  to whom the 
Investigator has delegated significant study -related duties, together with their roles 
in the study, curriculum vitae, and their signatures;  
• Copies of CRFs (if paper) and of documentation of corrections for all subjects;   
• IP accountability records;  
• All other source documents (subject records, hospital records, laboratory records, 
etc);  
• All other documents as listed in Section 8 of the ICH consolidated guideline on 
GCP (Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial).  
 
The Investigator must notify Celgene if he/she wishes to assign the essential 
documents to someone else, remove them to another location or is unable to retain 
them for a specified period.  The Investigator must obtain approval in writing from 
Celgene prio r to destruction of any records.  If the Investigator is unable to meet this 
obligation, the Investigator must ask Celgene for permission to make alternative 
arrangements.  Details of these arrangements should be documented.  All study 
documents should be made available if required by relevant health authorities.  
Investigator/Institution should take measures to prevent accidental or premature 
destruction of these documents.

24 
 8.1 Study Monitoring  
The investigator will self -monitor all study records for accuracy, completeness, and 
compliance with the protocol and GCPs and federal regulations.  All study records will be 
made available to Celgene Corporation representatives upon request.  Study site f acilities 
and study records will be made available to regulatory authorities’ inspectors if an 
inspection takes place.  The investigator will notify Celgene Corporation if this occurs.   
 
8.2  Statistics  
It is desired to enroll 50 patients based on the data from the Esteem trial which showed 
55% of subjects achieved between a PASI 25 - PASI 74 response at week 8, hence it is 
expected that 30-40 patients will fit the continuation criteria at week 8 and be followed 
through week 16.   
The study will analyze data based on the non -responder imputation (NRI) method. This 
will be performed for each arm of the study  (PASI 75 responders at week 8 and PASI 25 -
74 responders at week 8 . Subjects who do not complete week 16 assessments will be 
classsifed as non -responders.   
Since this is a pilot study with no formal hypothesis testing, statistical power/sample size 
is not formally presented in this protocol.  
 
Analysis will be performed by the Investigator on proportion of subjects achieving 
Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI) 75 response at week 12   
The investigator will also analyze PASI 25 -74 at week 8, PASI , PGA, BSA , PGAxBSA 
and DLQI improvement at week 8, BSA, PGA and B SA x PGA and DLQI improvement at 
week 12.  PASI, BSA, PGA, BSA x PGA and DLQI at week 16.    This analysis will be 
done separately for both cohorts (PASI 75 responders at week 8 and PASI 25 -74 
responders at week 8) using summary statistics. The Investigator will also analyze SAE’s  
by cohort.  
 
8.2.1  Additional Statistical Considerations  
Additional statistical procedures may be detailed in and performed according to a 
separate statistical plan at the discretion of sponsor -investigator.

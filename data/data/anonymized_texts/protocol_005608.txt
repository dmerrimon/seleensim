Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 administered Day 2 of each of the following 3  chemotherapy cycles.  
Randomization will occur in a 2:1 (Arm 1:Arm 2) ratio using a central  
randomization system (IWRS) on Day 1 of the first chemotherapy cycle. 
A central lab will conduct all ANC measurements used for analysis, 
however local lab ANC values may  be used  if central lab samples are 
compromised in quality.  Local Labs maybe used to monitor subject 
safety during the course of the study. 
Subjects randomized to Arm 2, Placebo study arm for chemotherapy 
Cycle 1 , will be dosed with F-627 for each of the following 3 
chemotherapy cycles. Subjects will return for a final study visit 3 weeks 
after the final study drug administration.  
A 12- lead ECG at baseline, before each subsequent dose,  and at the end 
of study.  A Central ECG laboratory utilizing blinded ECG readers will 
be employed to control variability and bias in interpretation . 
Study Site s: This study will be conducted in up to 30 cli nical centers in North 
America  and Europe  
Subject Population:  The study population will  consist of approximately  120 female subjects ≥  
18 to ≤ 75 years of age diagnosed with S tage II-IV breast cancer . 
Eligibility:  Subjects are eligible for study entry if they meet the following inclusion 
criteria: ≥ 18 and ≤  75 years of age; diagnosis S tage I I-IV breast cancer  
in the adjuvant or metastatic setting ; Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 2; white blood cell (WBC) count ≥ 4.0 × 10
9/L; hemoglobin ≥ 11.5 g/dL; platelet count ≥ 150 × 109/L; 
adequate renal, hepatic and cardiac fun ction; scheduled for 
chemotherapy. Patients will be excluded from the study if their disease 
had progressed while receiving a taxane regimen, if they have undergone 
radiation therapy within 4 weeks of enrollment, or if they have 
undergone a bone marrow or stem -cell transplantation.   
Subjects with a history of prior malignancy other than breast cancer may enter the study if the malignancy is in remission and not  receiving active 
treatment.   Subjects that have used or may have to use of G -CSF within 6 
weeks of the screening period or a drug or substance that may potentiate 
the release of neutrophils are excluded (i.e. sargramostim or filgrastim).  
Duration of Treatment  The duration of study treatment will be a total of approximately 84 days 
in addition to a 14 day screening phase. 
Subjects will be dosed according to their Treatment Arm randomized on 
Day 1 of chemotherapy C ycle 1. Subjects randomized to Placebo study 
arm for chemotherapy Cycle 1 will be dosed with F-627 for each of the 
following 3 chemotherapy cycles. To begin full -dose chemotherapy on 
Day 1 of the next cycle (day 22 of the previous cycle), it is recommended that patients have a base hemoglobin of at least 11.5 g/dl, ANC more 
than 4 x 10
9/L and platelet c ount more than 100 x 109/L.   
Clinic al assessments will oc cur for all subjects during the screening 
period ( Day -15 to Day  -1). Clinical assessments are Cycle specific upon 
study entry: 
Chemotherapy Cycle 1:   Subjects are required to return 24 hours after 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________   
Protocol: GC -627-04 Proprietary and Confidential  Page 7 of 58 
Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 chemotherapy administration for study drug dosing.  This will typically 
occur on study days 2, 23, 44 and 65 but may differ slightly as the actual 
time frame will be dependent upon the subject’s individual chemotherapy 
schedule, as noted above.  
For the fir st chemotherapy cycle, study subjects are required to return to 
the study site for daily blood draws to track ANC behavior post chemotherapy until ANC levels reach ≥ 2.0 × 10
9/L, post -nadir and then 
three days later.  
Chemotherapy Cycles 2, 3, 4:   
Subjects  are required to return 24 hours after chemotherapy 
administration for study drug dosing.  For cycles 2, 3, 4, subjects are required to return every other day  to the study site for blood draws to 
track ANC behavior post chemotherapy until ANC levels reach ≥ 2.0 × 
10
9/L, post- nadir and then three days later.   
If the ANC level of a subject is < 0.5 ×109/L, a daily ANC blood draw 
must be done until the ANC level is > 0.5  × 109/L. 
If patient’s ANC < 0.5 × 109/L for more than 6 consecutive days  in that 
chemotherapy cycle, a rescue therapy maybe initiated based on investigators discretion.    
Subject Assignment:  Eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 study arms:  
Arm 1:  F-627, 20 mg fixed dose pre filled syringe administered Day 2 of 
each of 4 chemotherapy cycles.  
Arm 2:  Placebo, pre filled syringe, administered Day 2 of the first 
chemotherapy cycle.  F-627, 20 mg fixed dose pre filled syringe 
administered Day 2 of each of following 3  chemotherapy cycles.  
Sample Size:  The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate the efficacy of F -
627 given as a single fixed dose (20 mg) pre- filled syringe in the first 
chemotherapy cycle as compared to Placebo. The primary end point will 
be the duration of severe neutropenia (ANC < 0.5 x 109/L) observed in 
chemotherapy cycle 1.  
Assuming an expected difference in the duration of severe neutropenia 
for F -627 as compared to Placebo of 2.0 days, with a common standard 
deviation of 3 days, this Phase III global clinical study will randomize approximately 120 subjects in a 2:1 ratio to Arm 1 ( F-627 in all 
chemotherapy cycles) and Arm 2 ( Placebo  in Cycle 1 , and F-627 in the 
following 3 chemotherapy cycles) respectively. The dropout rate for the trial is assumed to be 10%. Under these assumptions, enrollment of 80 
subjects for the F -627 arm and 40 subjects for the Placebo arm for Cycle 
1 would be required to realize 90% power. 
Efficacy Assessments:  Evaluation of efficacy of F -627 given as a single fixed dose (20 mg) pre-
filled syringe in the first chemotherapy cycle in comparison to Placebo  
by means of a subject’s ANC.  
Safety Assessments:  • AEs and SAEs  
• Vital signs  
• Clinical laboratory tests (to include hematology, serum chemistry, 
and urinalysis)

Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 2 BACKGROUND I NFORMATION 
 
2.1 Name and Description of Investigational Product 
2.1.1 Characteristics and Description  
The F -627 phase III clinical drug product is supplied in a prefilled syringe (PFS) 
containing 20.0 mg F-627 as a sterile, single use, preservative free solution for 
convenient subcutaneous injection. 
2.1.2 Physical and Chemical Characteristics of the Drug Substance  
F-627 is a recombinant fusion protein consisting of human G-CSF and human IgG2 
Fc fragments. F-627 is glycosylated with a molecule weight of approximately 93.4 
kDa and is produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells and is produced via a 
cell culture process in a serum free medium (containing no animal products ) 
followed by a series of purification steps. F-627 is manufactured according to Good Manufacturing P ractice (GMP) for P harmaceutical Products, 1998. The test 
procedure and acceptance criteria followed ICH Guideline, Q6B, 1999. 
  
2.2 Studies and Findings  
2.2.1 Non-Clinical Studies  
F-627 exhibits pharmacological effects in a dose-dependent manner in vitro  and in 
vivo.  Similar to the existing recombinant human granulocyte CSFs (rhG- CSFs), F-
627 was able to stimulate neutrophil production in normal and neutropenic ani mals. 
For cyclophospha mide (CP) -induced neutropenia in monkeys, F- 627 generated faster 
neutrophil recovery and reduced the severity of neutropenia when compared to 
Filgrastim and Pegfilgrastim (1).  
 
F-627 exhibits non-linear pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. A correlation of 
pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic ( PD) responses was demonstrated in rats and 
monkeys(1). 
 
Preclinical safety studies were conducted including safety pharmacology studies, single dose acute toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, repeat dos ing 3 -month 
toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, and a series of local tolerance tests to determine  
the clinical formulation. The safety profile for F -627 was established in these studies. 
In the 3-month repeat ed dose  toxicity studies that had  weekly subcutaneous 
injection s, the No Observable Adverse Effect Levels ( NOAELs ) were determined to 
be 1,000 µg/kg in rats and 675 µg/kg in monkeys.  
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________   
Protocol: GC -627-04 Proprietary and Confidential  Page 16 of 58 
Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 The Phase I clinical study  in healthy male subj ects demonstrated that F -627 w as well 
tolerated at doses up to . Favorable PK 
properties and dose-dependent PD response were demonstrated. The Phase  I study 
results provide support for further clinical studies in chemotherapy -induced 
neutropenic cancer patients. 
 
The Phase II clinical trial , GC -627-02, was  an open label, active-controlled, dose 
finding study that enroll ed 232 women with breast cancer receiving myelotoxic 
chemotherapy.  The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the 
F-627 given as a  
μ in each chemotherapy cycle in comparison to the standard dosing of 
Neulasta® (Neulastim®, pegfilgrastim; 6 mg; hereafter referred to as pegfilgrastim) in 
breast cancer subjects experiencing myelotoxic chemotherapy, either TC (Taxotere® 
+ cyclophosphamide) or TAC (Taxotere® + doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide). 
Myelotoxicity in this study was defined by the duration of moderate neutropenia; the number of days in which the subject had an ANC <1.0 × 10
9/L during Cycle 1 of 
their chemotherapy treatment. This, by definition, included Grade 3 (moderate) and Grade 4 (severe) neutropenia.  The following conclusions were drawn from the study:  
 
Efficacy  results of GC -627-02 
F-627 was not inferior to pegfilgrastim with respect to the duration of moderate to 
severe neutropenia at all doses. The duration and incidence of neutropenia and ANC profiles were comparable between pegfilgrastim and F-627 doses. 
A more myelotoxic chemotherapy regimen such as TAC provided a better model for 
evaluation of F-627 efficacy compared to pegfilgrastim. 
F-627 was as efficacious as pegfilgrastim in providing prophylactic neutrophil 
support in women with breast cancer undergoing myelotoxic chemotherapy. Further clinical studies with a larger patient population are recommended.  
 
Safety  results of GC -627-02 
The overall rates of AEs, SAEs, FN, injection site reactions, and laboratory values 
for F -627 doses were lower or similar to those for pegfilgrastim in this study. No 
differences in laboratory values between treatm ent groups were apparent. 
Further studies are required to fully examine the safety profile of F -627 in cancer 
patients.   
 
In addition a Phase II  study, SP- CDR -1-1302, was conducted to examine the two 
fixed doses of F-627.  This study was an active-controlled, dose-finding study that 
demonstrated F-627 to be statistically non -inferiority to Filgrastim for two fixed 
doses of F-627  the duration of moderate and severe 
neutropenia.   The  ANC profiles were comparable  between the F-627 doses  
 and the standard dose of Filgrastim.

4 TRIAL  DESIGN AND R ATIONALE   
 
4.1 Trial Design  
This Phase III, global, two arm, double- blinded clinical study will randomize 
approximately 120 subjects with Stage II - IV breast cancer in the adjuvant or metastatic 
setting,  who are to receive myelotoxic TA chemotherapy treatment (docetaxel + 
doxorubicin, 75 and 60 mg/m2, respectively).  The 120 subjects will be randomized in a 2:1  
ratio of F -627 and Placebo, respectively. The dropout rate for the trial is assumed to be 
10%. Under these assumptions, enrollment of 80 subjects for the F-627 arm and 40 
subjects for the Placebo arm for Cycle 1 would be required to realize 90% power. 
The patient population in this study is similar to the studies conduc ted by  Jones et al  (3),(4).  
Subjects in this study will be those who are scheduled to undergo at least 4, 21-day cycles 
TA (docetaxel  and doxorubicin 75 and 60 mg/m2) chemotherapy . The recommended 
steroid use the day before, the day of and the day after chemotherapy is dexamethasone at a dose level of no more than 8 mg BID.  Subjects maybe scheduled for more than 4 cycles of chemotherapy, however, study participation will be limited to a subject’s first 4 cycles.   
Since all subjects will receive F -627 from cycle two, chemotherapy  dose reduction at cycle 
two should be carefully evaluated. The design is similar to the Phase III trial conducted with Neulasta® (Neulastim®, pegfilgrastim) 
(5-7). 
The screening period for this trial is approximately 14 days.  During this time the subject will be consented and then evaluated for study eligibility via the study screening tests. 
Qualified subjects will be randomized to one of two arms in a 2:1 ratio (F -627:Placebo in 
Cycle 1) using a central randomization system (IWRS)  on Day 1 of the first chemotherapy 
cycle.    Each randomized subject will have 12- lead ECG measurements will be performed  
at baseline, prior to study drug dosing and at th e end of study.  The ECGs will be centrally 
read by a blinded team of readers.  
Approximately 24 hours after chemotherapy administration in each cycle (Day 2 of each 
cycle) , subjects will be administered study drug according to their randomization arm: 
Arm 1: F-627, 20 mg fixed dose pre filled syringe administered Day 2 of each of 4 
chemotherapy cycles.  
Arm 2:  Placebo, fixed dose pre filled syringe administered Day 2 of the first chemotherapy 
cycle, and F-627, 20 mg fixed dose pre filled syringe administered Day 2 of each of the following 3 chemotherapy cycles. 
To begin full-dose chemotherapy on Day 1 of the next cycle (day 22 of the previous cycle), it is recommended that patients have a base hemoglobin of at least 11.5 g/dl, WBC  more 
than 4 x 10
9/L and platelet count more than 100 x 109/L.   
Clinical assessments will occur for all subjects during the screening period (Day -15 to Day - 1). Clinical assessments are Cycle specific upon study entry:

Protocol: GC -627-04 Proprietary and Confidential  Page 22 of 58 
Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 For the first chemotherapy cycle, study subjects are required to return to the study site for 
daily blood draws to track ANC behavior post chemotherapy until ANC levels reach ≥ 2.0 × 10
9/L, post- nadir and then three days later.  
Chemotherapy Cycles 2, 3, 4:   
Subjects are required to return 24 hours after chemotherapy administration for study drug dosing.  For cycles 2, 3, 4, subjects are required to return every other day to the study site for blood draws to track ANC behavior post chemotherapy until ANC levels reach ≥ 2.0 × 10
9/L, post- nadir and  then three days later.   
If the ANC level of a subject is < 0.5 ×109/L, a daily  ANC blood draw must be done until 
the ANC level is > 0.5 × 109/L. 
Subjects will return for a final study visit 3 weeks after the final study drug administration. Any AEs should be noted and followed to resolution or stabilization. 
 
4.2 Rationale 
Recombinant human G- CSF (rhG -CSF) was developed and used to treat neutropenia, 
particularly  for the management of neutropenia in patients with cancer  (8),(9). The first 
generation rhG -CSF, f ilgrastim, received FDA approval in the US in 1991 for treat ing 
neutropenia (10-12). The rhG- CSF produced in mammalian cells, lenograstim,  is a 
glycosylated form  that received approval in Europe in 1993 for treat ing neutropenia. Both 
filgrastim and l enograstim have a half -life of approximately 3 hours and require daily 
administration.  
 A new generation of rhG- CSF is a pegylated rmetHuG -CSF, pegfilgrastim, which received 
FDA approval in 2002 
(13).  Pegfilgrastim has an extended half-life of 30 to 80 hours and 
requires less frequent administration than  filgrastim and lenograstim (14-16).  However, the 
addition of PEG appeared to reduce the affinity for receptor binding compared to parent 
rhG-CSF protein. The b ioactivity of p egfilgrastim is reduced when  compared to f ilgrastim. 
Filgrastim is dosed daily at 300 µg , while a higher dose, 6 mg , of p egfilgrastim is required  
to achieve comparable clinical efficacy.  
  
Reducing the duration and severity of neutropenia following chemotherapy remain s a 
challenge for cancer treatment  (17).  The sponsor is investigating the efficacy of F- 627, a 
dimeric rhG -CSF that is a stronger G- CSFR activator in treating neutropenia.  F-627 may 
bring additional benefits to cancer patients by shortening the duration and lessening the 
severity of chemotherapy -induced neutropenia. Thus, F-627 could be used to better 
manage severe neutropenia, which would fulfill an unmet medical need.

Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 6 TRIAL  PROCEDURES  
 
See Section 18.1 and 18.2 (Study Flow Chart). 
  
6.1 Measures to Avoid Bias  
6.1.1 Randomization 
This study is a double blind study for the first cycle of chemotherapy.  Eligible 
subjects in this study will be randomized to either F -627 20 mg/dose or Placebo in a 
2:1 ratio, respectively in Cycle 1 .  Treatment randomization will be stratified by 
countr y/region . All subjects will be placed on the F -627 study drug for the following 
3 chemotherapy cycles.  An interactive web -based response system (IWRS) with a 
24-hour live support Helpdesk will be used in the study. Authorized study site personnel will access the randomization system using a user ID and password. Prior training and a user’s manual  will be provided to all the study participating sites.  
 
6.1.2 Simultaneous Utilization of All Arms  
All arms will be utilized concurrently.  
6.2 Trial Treatment and Dosage and Regimen of Investigational Products  
6.2.1 Treatment Dose  
Subjects will be dosed subcutaneously  24 hours after receiving TA chemotherapy.  
Subjects will be dosed with either the F-627 20mg/dose fixed dose pre filled syringe 
or placebo  in the first chemotherapy cycle, depending on the randomization arm 
assigned . All subjects will receive the F-627 20mg/dose fixed dose pre filled syringe 
for chemotherapy cycles 2 -4.  A subject’s chemotherapy dosing regimen should 
remain unchanged for the first two chemotherapy cycles.  
 
 
6.2.2 Description of the Dosage Form, Packaging and Labeling of the Investigational 
Product  
Each site will receive enough F-627 drug kits and enough placebo kits for their 
subjects for the duration of the clinical trial.  Each F -627 kit will contain one 
prefilled syringe (PFS) containing 20.0 mg F-627 as a sterile, single use, preservative 
free solution for convenient subcutaneous injection. Each placebo kit will consist of an identical model prefilled syringe with saline.  The clinical drug product should remain at a temperature between 2 -8
oC.  Any temperature excursions from this 
storage condition should be recorded for time and duration and the study coordinator notified .  
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________   
Protocol: GC -627-04 Proprietary and Confidential  Page 28 of 58 
Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 The investigational drug product will be sent to the clinical sites in kits containing 1 
uniquely labeled PFS each . Each kit will be labeled with the following information: 
 
 Caution: New Drug - Limited by Federal (US) Law to Investigational Use.  
Sponsor’s name and address 
Drug Substance Name and Strength  
Protocol number  Dosing instructions Storage conditions  
Lot Number 
 Manufacturing Date  
 Additional text will be added or removed from the label(s) as required by local 
regulations or provided in the subject’s information and informed consent docum ent. 
 
6.2.3 Investigational Dose Schedule  
Dosing of study drug will commence on the second day of each chemotherapy cycle (up to 4 cycles) the subject enters.  The dosing should occur at approximately 24 hours after the chemotherapy treatment is administered.  
 
6.3 Duration of Subject Participation  
Prior to randomization, there is a screening period of up to two weeks for completion of 
consent form, collection of medical history, clinical signs and symptoms, and laboratory 
tests.   The duration of subject participation once randomization has occurred is 
approximately 12 weeks , depending on the chemotherapy schedule deemed appropriate by 
the investigator . To begin full -dose chemotherapy on day 1 of the next cycle (day 22 of the 
previous cycle), it is recommended that patient s have a base hemoglobin of at least 11.5 
g/dl, WBC of  more than 4 x 109/L and platelet count more than 100 x 109/L.   
 
6.4 Hold and Stop Rules 
6.4.1 Stop Rules for Subjects (Study Drug Discontinuation)   
Any hospitalization, serious uncontrolled infection requiring antibiotics, possibly drug 
related SAE , or demonstrated drug hypersensitivity is cause for subjects to discontinue 
drug if the investigator feels it is appropriate.  In addition, the subject’s chemotherapy regimen may be discontinued at the Investigator’s discretion and thus there would be no additional study drug administration.  
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________   
Protocol: GC -627-04 Proprietary and Confidential  Page 29 of 58 
Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 Since subject s maybe randomized to  the placebo arm for their first chemotherapy 
cycle, the ir ANC level should be monitored closely. If a subject ’s ANC is < 0.5 × 
109/L for more than 6 days  during that chemotherapy cycle or the subject develops 
febrile neutropenia, a rescue therapy maybe initiated at the  investigators discretion. 
The subject maybe considered discontinued/withdrawn  from the study if the rescue 
therapy includes a short acting GCSF.  Any use of concomitant medication should be 
documented and the subject’s ANC level should be closely monitored until recovered. 
 
6.4.2  End of Treatment and Follow -up Visits  
All subjects will receive an end o f study assessment on Day 8 4 (or 3 weeks after the 
patient’s last dose of investigational agent) .  All adverse events will be followed  until 
stabilization or resolution.  Note: these dates are approximate as they are dependent 
upon an individual’s chemother apy treatment schedule.  
6.5 Unblinding  
If a serious and  life-threatening adverse event occurs and determination of subject 
treatment arm is required, the regional medical monitor must be contacted and notified of 
the event immediately. This study is a placebo controlled double blind study for a subject’s first chemotherapy cycle only.  A subject will receive F -627 for their following 
three chemotherapy cycles.  If Investigators have a subject with a serious and life -
threatening adverse even t, the Investigator should request the medical monitor to unblind 
the subject via the IWRS . It is recommended that subjects are not in general unblinded for 
febrile or severe neutropenia as this is an expected event, which should be controlled by rescue therapy.  Investigators will, however, have the ability to un- blind patient treatment 
via the IWRS for emergency purposes.  For all other events that may require un-blinding of the subject  treatment assignment, the medical monitor must be contacted before any un -
blinding occurs. In all cases, the regional medical monitor will notify the Sponsor immediately. The Investigator or the regional medical monitor may carry out emergency un-blinding through the IWRS only.  
The subject is considered discontinued from the study after un -blinding. The safety will be 
followed until it is resolved. There will be no replacement of discontinued subjects due to 
un-blinding. 
6.6 Accountability Procedures 
Study medication will be shipped to each institution at the time of site initiation. The 
IWRS will be used to monitor the inventory level of investigational drug supply at clinical sites. The Investigator is also responsible for monitoring the inventory of  medication 
supplies , to ensure sufficient supply for the site . The study monitors will also verify the 
drug accountability during each site monitoring visit. At the end of the study, all study drug supplies will be returned to the Sponsor/designee by the study monitor for each site , 
or destroyed on- site per local documented procedures  or requirements.

Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 6.7 Electronic Case Report Forms   
Each site is responsible for collecting and maintaining the source documentation describing 
the clinical information.  
 
eCRF S are to be completed using the EDC system iDataFax 4. 3. Sites will receive training 
and guidelines for appropriate eCRF completion.   All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained examining personnel or the study 
coordinator as appropriate, and should be completed in a timely manner for each enrolled 
subject. It is expected that sites will enter data as per the industry time standard, 5 business 
days after the subject visit.  The completed eCRFs are the sole property of the trial sponsor 
and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of the trial sponsor or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from the sponsor. 
It is the Principal Investigator's responsibility to ensure c ompletion and to review and 
approve all eCRFs. eCRFs must be signed by the Principal Investigator or by a sub-
Investigator who has official authorization in accordance with local regulatory authorities. These signatures serve to attest that the information  contained on the eCRFs is correct and 
complete. At all times, the Principal Investigator has final personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered on the eCRFs. Subject source documents are the physici an's subject records maintained at the trial sites. The 
information collected on the eCRFs must match the subject source documents. 
 
7 TREATMENT  OF SUBJECTS 
7.1 Dosing 
Subcutaneous administration of study drug will occur on day 2 of each chemotherapy cycle that the subject undergoes (up to 4 cycles).  See Appendix sections 18.1 and 18.2 for specific details.   Chemotherapy dosage should remain unchanged for the first two 
chemotherapy cycles.  
7.2 Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications are permitted as deemed appropriate by the investigator. 
 
7.3 Approved Medications 
Any FDA approved prescription medication may be given as needed, including th ose 
necessary to treat symptoms  
7.4 Medications Not Permitted 
F-627 is similar to Neulasta®  (Neulastim®, pegfilgrastim) , which is an other type of long 
acting GCSF, and stimulates neutrophil production in vivo .   No formal drug interaction 
studies have been performed with Neulasta® (Neulastim®, pegfilgrastim) so there are no 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________   
Protocol: GC -627-04 Proprietary and Confidential  Page 31 of 58 
Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 drugs specifically contraindicated for this study, however, any type of long  acting GCSF is 
prohibited.  Short acting G- CSF drugs are not permitted  during the normal course of the 
study, however, a short acting G -CSF maybe used if  rescue therapy is  needed due to the 
development of febrile neutropenia or pr olonged severe neutropenia (>6 days) . If short 
acting GCSF being used,  it should be documented as a concomitant medication  and 
recorded  in the study eCRFs. Drugs such as lithium may potentiate the release of 
neutrophils and thus are not permitted in this study.  
 
7.5 Compliance 
Subject compliance will be monitored by reviewing the study medication accountability 
inventory logs.   Source documentation will be reviewed to verify protocol compliance 
throughout the duration of the study. 
 
8 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
 
8.1 Efficacy Parameters 
The primary efficacy parameter will be the duration o f grade 4 neutropenia ( ANC  < 0.5 x 
109/L) observed in chemotherapy cycle 1.  
Secondary e fficacy parameters will include the duration of grade s 2, 3 and  4 neutropenia 
(ANC < 1.5 × 109/L, ANC < 1.0 × 109/L, ANC  < 0.5 x 109/L, respectively ) observed in all 
chemotherapy cycles  as determined by ANC levels derived from daily blood sampling.  
Central lab results will be used for any statistical analysis performed in this trial to ensure 
consis tent measurements throughout the duration of the clinical trial.   Local lab results 
may be used in instances where the central lab results are unavailable or have been compromised due to sample quality.

Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 9  ASSESSMENT OF  SAFETY  
9.1 Safety Parameters 
9.1.1 Standard Safety Parameters  
Standard safety parameters include hematology, blood chemistry and urinalysis 
parameters, vital signs , physical examination, and symptom/toxicity assessment. 
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)  v 4.03 will be used to grade potential adverse events.  
 
Local blood samples will be used to determine the status of a subject’s ANC level  
for local safety monitoring and local evaluation.   Locally determined ANC values 
can be used  in instances where the c entral lab value is unavailable or 
compromised due to sample quality. 
 
9.2 The Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording and Analyzing Safety 
Parameters  
9.2.1 Medical History and Clinical Signs and Symptoms  
A medical history is collected at the screening visit .  Clinical signs and symptoms 
will be taken at each scheduled visit during which adverse events data will be 
collected. If other unscheduled activities are performed, such as physical examination or laboratory studies, the results must be provided on the electronic 
case report forms (eCRFs) . 
 
9.2.2 Physical Examination 
A physical examination will take place at screening and at each clinical visit as 
presented in the Study Flow chart  (section 18.2) . Any change from baseline will 
be evaluated  and assessed by the Investigator. An abbreviated physical exam may 
be completed at any visit as deemed appropriate by medical staff.  Results of such 
abbreviated physical exam s must be included in the eCRFs . 
9.2.3 ECG Measurement  
 
A standard 12- lead ECG should be obtained using equipment provided by the 
sponsor.  The ECG will be obtained after the subject has been in a semi -
recumbent position for approximately 10 minutes at the following times: screening , prior to each administratio n of study  drug dose, and at the end of study. 
For each 12 Lead ECG procedure, the designated iCardiac study cardiologist will provide a comprehensive diagnostic interpretation along with evaluation and confirmation of the semi -automated interval analysis.  (QT, QTcF, RR, PR, QRS, 
HR), and T and U wave assessment. Reading and interpretation of the ECG will be performed centrally and provided to the investigator.  The investigator is

Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 responsible for reviewing interpretations and for retaining hard copies of t he 
reports.   
 
9.2.4 Reporting  
For each subject, all clinical laboratory assessments will be reported on an eCRF. 
 
9.3 Procedures for Eliciting Reports of and Recording and Reporting Adverse 
Events and Intercurrent Illnesses 
At each visit, a history of any adverse events occurring since the last visit needs to be  
collected. Also, s pecimens are collected for specified laboratory tests as needed and results 
should be  reviewed. Physical examinations are performed at each clinical  visit as presented 
in the Study Flow chart  (section 18.2) and  more frequently as clinically indicated.   
 
9.4 Type and Duration of Follow-Up of Subjects after Adverse Events 
Subject s will have their last study visit (Day 84) and all adverse events  occurring since the 
last study drug dose should be identified and recorded .   Any grade 3 or 4 adverse events or 
serious adverse event s should be  followed up until they have  resolved or stabilized and 
proper documentation of the follow up must be provided, i.e. site call log . The s ponsor 
must be advised of all grade 3 or 4 adverse events within one week of their identification, 
and of all serious adverse events within 24 hours of identification. Subjects will be 
followed up until the adverse event resolves or stabilizes. 
 
9.5 Defining, Grading and Reporting Adverse Events 
9.5.1 Adverse Events  
All adverse events, whether observed by researchers or reported by subjects, 
regardless of treatment group or suspected causal relationship to the investigational product(s), will be recorded on the adverse event page(s) of the eCRF.  
 
For all adverse events, the Investigator must obtain adequate information to determine the cause and outcome of the adverse event, and to assess whether it meets the criteria for classification as a serious adverse event requiring immediate notification to  Generon and its designated representative (see Section 9.5.9). The 
Investigator is required to assess the causality and indicate that assessment on the eCRF. Follow -up of the adverse event, after the date of therapy discontinuation, is 
required until the adverse event or subsequent resulting AEs attributed to an ongoing AE resolves or stabilizes at a level acceptable to the Investigator and the Generon clinician and safety officer.  
 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________   
Protocol: GC -627-04 Proprietary and Confidential  Page 34 of 58 
Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 9.5.2 Definition  
An adverse event (AE) is any occurrence or worsening of an unde sirable or 
unintended sign, symptom (including an abnormal laboratory finding), or disease 
temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. Worsening of underlying disease will not be considered to be an adverse event, since it will be class ified as a treatment 
failure. Pregnancy will not be considered to be an adverse event, but will be collected separately. However if the resultant child has a birth defect, this will be considered to be an SAE.  
 
Throughout the study, the Investigator must record all adverse events on the eCRF adverse event pages, regardless of the severity or relationship to study 
medication or procedure. The Investigator should treat subjects with adverse events appropr iately and observe them at suitable intervals until the events resolve 
or stabilize.  
 
Adverse events can be discovered by observing the patient, questioning the 
patient objectively and/or receiving an unsolicited complaint from the patient.  
 
A subject’s AE ’s will be collected from the start of the study medication until the 
subject’s last study visit. AE’s that  are unresolved at the time of study termination 
will be followed until they resolve or stabilize.  
 
9.5.3 Serious Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events (SA E) are defined as any adverse events occurring at any 
dose that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. 
This includes, but may not be limited to any of the following events: 
 
Death: A death occurring during the study , or which comes to the attention of 
the Investigator during the protocol -defined follow -up after the completion of 
therapy, must be reported whether or not considered treatment- related . 
 
Life-threatening: Any adverse therapy experience that places the subject, in 
the view of the Investigator, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it 
occurred . 
 
1. Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization . 
 
2. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity . 
 
3. Congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________   
Protocol: GC -627-04 Proprietary and Confidential  Page 35 of 58 
Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0  
4. Spontaneous abortion or death of the infant within 1 month of birth. 
 
5. An event that required intervention to prevent permanent impairment or 
damage.  
 6. An important medical event that does not result in death, that may not 
necessarily be life threatening and that does not  require hospitalization 
may still be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, it may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
 
Pregnancy is NOT an SAE .  However if the resultant child has a birth defect, this 
will be considered to be an SAE. (S ee section 9.5.5.) 
 
SAEs will be collected from the time of randomization until 28 days after 
completion of the trial or 28 days after premature withdra wal of a subject from the 
trial. 
 
If an event meets any of the criteria listed above, it must be reported as a serious 
adverse event regardless of its presumed relation to the study drug. 
 
9.5.4 Grading Adverse Events  
Toxicity grades are assigned by the study site to indicate the severity of adverse events occurring in study participants. To do this, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.03 
grading system will be used in adverse event reporting. The purpose of using the 
CTCAE system is to provide a standard language to describe toxicities, to facilitate tabulation and analysis of the data, and to facilitate the assessment of the clinical significance of all adverse  events. Adverse events should be recorded and 
graded 1 to 5 according to the CTCAE grades provided below: 
 
 Grade 1 = Mild adverse event  
 Grade 2 = Moderate adverse event  
 Grade 3 = Severe and undesirable adverse event  
 Grade 4 = Life -threatening or disabling adverse event  
 Grade 5 = Death

Protocol: GC -627-04 Proprietary and Confidential  Page 36 of 58 
Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 9.5.5 Exposure i n Utero  
For investigational products within clinical trials and for marketed products, an 
exposure  in-utero  (EIU) occurs if a female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant 
either while receiving or having been exposed to (e.g., environmental) an investigational medication or product, or if the female becomes, or is found to be, pregnant after discontinuing and/or being exposed to the investigational medication or product. 
If any trial subject becomes or is fo und to be pregnant while receiving an 
investigational medication/product, the Investigator must submit this information 
to the Generon Safety Officer or sponsor designee using the Exposure I n Utero  
(EIU) eCRF within 24 hours of awareness of the pregnancy. This must be done irrespective of whether an adverse event has occurred. The information submitted should include the anticipated date of delivery (see below for information related to induced termination of pregnancy).  
The Investigator will follow the su bject until completion of the pregnancy or until 
pregnancy termination (i.e., induced abortion) and then notify the Generon 
Medical Officer or sponsor’s designee of the outcome. The Investigator will provide this information as a follow up to the initial E xposure in Utero  Form. The 
reason(s) for an induced abortion should be specified. An EIU report is not created when an ectopic pregnancy report is received since this pregnancy is not usually viable. Rather, an SAE case is created with the event of ectopic pregnancy. 
If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification as 
a serious adverse event (i.e., spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly, including that found in an aborted fetus, stillbirth or n eonatal 
death), the Investigator should follow the procedures for reporting serious adverse events.  
In the case of a live birth, the “normality” of the newborn can be assessed at the time of birth (i.e., no minimum follow -up period of a presumably normal i nfant is 
required before an Exposure  In Utero  Form can be completed). The “normality” 
of an aborted fetus can be assessed by gross visual inspection, unless pre -abortion 
test findings are suggestive of a congenital anomaly. 
Additional information about pre gnancy outcomes that are classified as serious 
adverse events follows:  
•    “Spontaneous abortion” includes miscarriage and missed abortion. 
•     All neonatal deaths that occur within 1 month of birth should be reported, 
without regard to causality, as serious adverse events. In addition, any infant 
death after 1  month that the Investigator assesses as possibly related to the in 
utero  exposure to the investigational medication should be reported.

Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 9.5.6 Relationship to Study Therapy  
The relationship between an adverse event and an investigational product is 
determined by the site Investigator and recorded on the appropriate eCRF and/or 
SAE Reporting Form. The CTCAE provides the following descriptors and definitions. Code 1 is classified as unrelated and Codes 2- 5 as related. ( See Table 
11-1.) 
The Investigator’s determination of drug -relatedness (attribution) for each adverse 
event should be recorded in the source documentation.   For additional information, please consult the Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.03 and the Common Toxicity Criteria Document at

agent(s).  
3 Possible  The adverse event may be related to the investigational agent(s).  
4 Probable  The adverse event is likely related to the investigational agent(s).  
5 Definite  The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s).  
 
9.5.7 Abnormal Laboratory Findings 
The criteria for determining whether an abnormal  objective test finding should be 
reported as an adverse event are as follows:  
 
1. Test result is associated with accompanying symptoms, and/or  
 
2. Test result requires additional diagnostic testing or medical/surgical intervention, and/or  
 3. Test result leads to a change in trial dosing , discontinuation from the 
study, or significant additional concomitant drug treatment or other 
therapy, and/or  
 4. Test result is considered to be an adverse event by the Investigator or Sponsor.  
 
An abnormal test result, even if repeated, does not constitute an adverse event in the absence of any of the above conditions. Any abnormal test res ult that is 
determined to be an error does not require reporting as an adverse event.

Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v 4.03 will be used 
to grade the severity of laboratory abnormalities.  
 
9.5.8 Eliciting Adverse Event Information  
The Investigator is to report all directly observed adverse events and all adverse 
events spontaneously reported by the trial subject. In addition, each trial subject will be questioned about adverse events at each clinic visit. The question asked will be “Since your last clinic visit have you had any health problems?”, or a similar question.  
 
9.5.9 Reporting Requirements (Serious and Non-S erious)  
Each adverse event is to be classified by the Investigator as serious or non -
serious. This classification determines  the reporting procedures to be followed. If 
a serious adverse event occurs, expedited reporting will follow local and international regulations.  
 SAEs are reportable from the time that the subject is randomized in the clinical trial up to and including 30 calendar days after the last administration of the investigational product. Any serious adverse event occurring more than 30 calendar days after completion of the study must be promptly reported if a causal relationship to study drug is suspected.   If a serious adverse event occurs, the Generon Safety Officer and/or his/her agent 
are to be notified within  24 hours of awareness of the event by the Investigator. In 
particular, if the serious adverse event is fatal or life- threatening, notification must 
be made to the Generon Safety Officer or his/her agent immediately, irrespective of the extent of available adverse event information. This time frame also applies to additional new information (follow -up) on previously forwarded serious 
adverse event reports.  
 In the rare event that the Investigator does not become aware of the occurrence of a serious adverse event immediately (e.g., if an outpatient trial subject initially seeks treatment elsewhere), the Investigator is to report the event within 24  hours 
after learning of it and document the time of his/her first awareness of the adverse 
event.  
 For all serious adverse events, the Investigator is obligated to provide information to the Generon Safety Officer and his/her agent in accordance with the time frame s for reporting specified above. In addition, the Generon study clinician or 
the Generon Safety Officer may request an Investigator to obtain specific follow- up information in an expedited fashion. This information may be more 
detailed than that captured on the adverse event electronic case report form. This will include a description of the adverse event in sufficient detail to allow for a complete medical assessment of the case and independent determination of possible causality. Information on other poss ible causes of the event, such as 
 
_______________________________________________________________________________________________   
Protocol: GC -627-04 Proprietary and Confidential  Page 40 of 58 
Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 concomitant medications and illnesses, must be provided. In the case of a subject 
death, a summary of available autopsy findings must be submitted as soon as possible to the Generon Safety Officer and his/her designated re presentative.  
 The Investigator’s causality assessment must be included in all reports of serious adverse events. An Investigator’s causality assessment is the determination of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product  
caused or contributed to an adverse event. If the Investigator’s final determination is that causality is unknown and the Investigator cannot determine whether the event is related to study drug, then the event will be handled as “related to study drug” for reporting purposes. If the Investigator's causality assessment is 
"unknown but not related to study drug", this should be clearly documented on study records. In addition, if the Investigator determines the adverse event is associated with trial procedu res, the Investigator must record this causal 
relationship in the source documents and eCRF, as appropriate, and report such an assessment in accordance with the serious adverse event reporting requirements.   
 All adverse events will be reported on the adverse event page(s) of the eCRF. It should be noted that the form for collection of serious adverse event information is not the same as the adverse event eCRF. Where the same data are collected, the forms must be completed in a consistent manner. For example, the same adverse event term should be used on both forms / eCRFs. Adverse events should be reported using concise medical terminology as defined in the CTCAE short names on the eCRFs as well as on the form for collection of serious adverse event inform ation. 
 Non-serious adverse events are to be reported on the adverse event page of the 
eCRFs, which are to be submitted to Generon as specified in the adverse event report submission procedure for this protocol.   If a subject begins a new therapy, the adverse event -reporting period will end at 
the time that the new treatment is started. Death must be reported if it occurs within 30 days after the date of last dose of investigational product, irrespective of any intervening treatment.  
 
10 STATISTICAL  ANALYSIS  
 
Detailed methodology for summary and statistical analyses of the data collected in this trial will be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan, which will be signed and maintained by the Sponsor. This document will expand upon and may modify the plans outlined in the 
protocol; however, any major modifications of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment.

10.2.5 Sample Size Calculation  
Assuming an expected difference in the duration of severe neutropenia for F-627 as compared to Placebo of 2.0 days, with a common standard deviation of 3 days, this Phase III global clinical study will randomize approximately 120 su bjects in a 
2:1 ratio of F-627 and Placebo, respectively. The dropout rate for the trial is assumed to be 10%. Under these assumptions, enrollment of 80 subjects for the F-627 arm and 40 subjects for the Placebo arm for Cycle 1 would be required to realize 90% power  
 
10.3 Criteria for Termination and Sponsor Discontinuation Criteria 
Premature termination of this clinical trial may occur because of a regulatory authority decision, change in opinion of the IRB/IEC, drug safety problems, or at the discretion of Generon. In addition, Generon retains the right to discontinue development of F -627 at any 
time.  
 
Generon reserves the right to discontinue the trial prior to inclusion of the intended number of subjects, but intends only to exercise this right for valid s cientific or administrative 
reasons. After such a decision, the Investigator must contact all participating subjects within a time period set by Generon. As directed by Generon, all trial materials must be collected and all e CRFs completed to the greatest extent possible.

access to source documents to perform this verification.  The trial sites may be subject to review by the institutional review board (IRB)/independent 
ethics committee (IEC), quality assurance audits performed by Generon and/or inspection by appropriate regulatory authorities from the US or other countries.  Investi gator(s) and their relevant personnel must be available during the monitoring visits 
and audits or inspections. Sufficient time must be devoted to these inspections.  
The Investigator is required to keep accurate records to ensure the conduct of the study is 
fully documented. The Investigator is required to ensure that all electronic Case Report 
Forms are complete, accurate and legible for every subject entered in the trial.  
 
The Sponsor is responsible for regular inspection of the conduct of the trial, for  verifying 
adherence to the protocol, and for confirming the completeness, consistency and accuracy of 
all documented data. 
 
13 ETHICS 
  
13.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) 
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain prior approval of the trial protocol, protocol amendments, informed consent forms, and other relevant documents, e.g., advertisements, if applicable, from the IRB/IEC. All correspondence with the IRB/I EC 
should be retained in the Investigator File. Copies of IRB/IEC approvals should be forwarded to Generon  or its designees.  
 The only circumstance in which an amendment may be initiated prior to IRB/IEC approval is where the change is necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazards to the subjects. In that event, the Investigator must notify the IRB/IEC and Generon  or its designees in 
writing within five  working days after the implementation.  
 
13.2 Ethical Conduct of the Trial 
The trial will be performed in a ccordance with the protocol, International Conference on 
Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, and applicable local regulatory requirements and laws.

Protocol: GC -627-04 Proprietary and Confidential  Page 47 of 58 
Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 13.3 Patient Information and Consent 
The informed consent form must be agreed to by Generon and the  IRB/IEC and must be in 
compliance with ICH -GCP, local regulatory requirements, and legal requirements.  
 
The Investigator must ensure that each trial subject, or his/her legally acceptable 
representative, is fully informed about the nature and objectives of the trial and possible risks associated with participation. The Investigator will obtain written informed consent from each subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative before any study- specific activity is performed. The informed consent form used in this trial, and any 
changes made to it during the course of the trial, must be approved by both the IRB/IEC and Sponsor before use. The Investigator will retain a copy of each subject's signed consent form. 
 
A Sponsor recommended sample informed consent form will be provided to the investigational site as a s eparate document. Modifications to the consent required by ethics 
committee/IRB should be reviewed by the Sponsor. 
 
14 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
 
14.1 Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) 
Each site is responsible for collecting and maintaining the source documentation 
describing the clinical information.  
eCRFS are to be completed using the EDC system iDataFax 4. 3. Sites will receive training 
and guidelines for appropriate eCRF completion.  All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained examining personnel or the study 
coordinator as appropriate, and should be completed in a timely manner for each enrolled subject. The completed eCRFs are the sole property of the trial sponsor and should not be made available in any form to third parties, except for authorized representatives of the trial sponsor or appropriate regulatory authorities, without written permission from the sponsor. 
It is the Principal Investigator's responsibility to ensure completion and to review and 
approve all eCRFs. eCRFs must be signed by the Principal Investigator or by a sub-Investigator who has official authorization in accordance with local regulatory authorities. These signatures serve to attest that the informatio n contained on the eCRFs is correct and 
complete. At all times, the Principal Investigator has final personal responsibility for the accuracy and authenticity of all clinical and laboratory data entered on the eCRFs. Subject source documents are the physic ian's subject records maintained at the trial sites. The 
information collected on the eCRFs must match the subject source documents.

Protocol: GC -627-04 Proprietary and Confidential  Page 48 of 58 
Date: 07 May 2017    Version: Amendment 1.0 14.2 Record Retention 
To enable evaluations and/or audits from regulatory authorities or Generon, the 
Investigator agrees to keep complete records, including the identity of all participating subjects (sufficient information to link records, e.g., eCRFs and hospital records), all original signed informed consent forms, copies of all eCRFs, source documents, and detailed records of  treatment disposition. The records must be retained by the Investigator 
according to ICH and local regulations as well as the Clinical Study Agreement.  
 If the Investigator relocates, retires, or for any reason withdraws from the trial, Generon 
should be notified in advance. The trial records must be transferred to an acceptable 
designee, such as another Investigator, another agreed- upon institution, or to Generon. The 
Investigator must obtain written permission from Generon before disposing of any records , 
even if retention requirements have been met. 
 
15 FINANCING AND I NSURANCE  
 
The Sponsor, Generon, will ensure sufficient funding for completion of this trial and will provide adequate insurance for trial conduct.  
 
16 PUBLICATION POLICY 
 
Publication of study re sults is discussed in the Clinical Study Agreement. All publications to 
be submitted to scientific journals or presentations to be given at scientific meetings must be 
submitted to Generon (Shanghai)  at least one month prior to submission. Planned 
presentations must include all slides. This includes presentations given at the presenters’ own institution (such as Grand Rounds). However, presentations given to the study team are not required to be approved in advance.

 STUDY SYNOPSIS  Study Title: Comfort Start: A Prospective, Randomized, Single Blind, Crossover Study to Evaluate Treatment Effects Associated with the NeuroStar SoftStartTM Treatment Feature Study Rationale: SoftStart is an exclusive feature available on the NeuroStar® Advanced Therapy System. This feature introduces a series of stepped pulses within each pulse train ramping up the pulse magnitude to the prescribed treatment level. The study hypothesizes that altering the pulse magnitude in this way will provide patients a more comfortable treatment and assist in reaching the prescribed treatment intensity with less discomfort or in a shorter time. Trial Design: This is a randomized, single center, single blind study conducted in an adult population being treated for MDD. Eligible subjects will have already been determined suitable to receive rTMS stimulation for MDD as assessed against the established inclusion and exclusion criteria by their independent physician. Eligible subjects will sign the informed consent form for participation. Each subject will be treated with rTMS for MDD as diagnosed and prescribed by their treating physician. Following consent and successful study qualification, study subjects will be randomized to the standard Dash protocol or the modified Dash protocol with the SoftStart feature enabled. After reaching the prescribed treatment level with the first treatment protocol per the randomization schedule, the subject will then be switched to the alternative treatment protocol for the next day’s treatment. This treatment alternation will continue 3 more times. During treatments, the subject will be asked to complete several questionnaires, including comfort/pain, treatment preference, and depression questionnaires.  Approximate Duration of  Subject Participation: Up to approximately 14 days, one hour for screening and 30 minutes during each daily treatment session. Approximate Duration of Study: Approximately 4-6 Months

 CLINICAL SECTION 
 Introduction TMS and SoftStart Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is defined as the administration of a series of magnetic stimuli to the brain for the purpose of altering brain function. NeuroStar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) Therapy was FDA cleared in 2008 for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adult patients who have not received benefit from prior medication. This procedure is non-invasive, does not require anesthesia, and may be delivered in an appropriately staffed outpatient setting. Although generally regarded as safe and without lasting adverse effects, patients treated with rTMS may experience minor side effects. The most common side effects are discomfort due to stimulation of the scalp musculature under the site of stimulation and muscle tension headaches which may persist for 1-2 hours post stimulation.8,9 These effects are thought to be due to the direct activation of muscles and nerves near the stimulating coil and both duration and intensity of stimulation impact the incidence of these effects. Stimulus intensity is based on individually determined resting motor threshold (RMT or MT, minimum intensity to elicit muscle twitches at relaxed upper or lower extremities, by visual inspection or electromyography). The recommended stimulation intensity range is 110-120% MT. 21 According to the original NeuroStar protocol, after determining the MT, a treatment session included stimulation at 120% motor threshold with a pulse sequence of 10 Hz for 4 seconds, followed by a 26 second inter-train interval (quiet period). A session lasted for a total of 37.5 minutes with a total of 3,000 pulses. A full NeuroStar treatment includes 30 daily sessions over 6 weeks with an additional 6 session ramp down over 3 weeks for a total of 9 weeks.15 In clinical practice, during the first 5-10 treatment sessions clinicians typically “ramp up” patients to the prescribed treatment intensity (% MT) to minimize side effects. Treatment sessions often start at 80-90% MT and stimulation intensity is increased to the prescribed level based on individual patient tolerance. Over time, cumulative clinical trial experience has revealed that a variety of alterations to the stimulation protocols, delivering different doses and timing of stimulation, can produce beneficial antidepressant effect without jeopardizing safety.10 In 2016, FDA cleared a new treatment protocol termed “Dash”. The Dash protocol was introduced to improve the acceptability and convenience of TMS therapy by reducing the duration of a 3000-pulse session to as short as 18.75 minutes, which is half the time required for the Standard protocol FDA cleared in 2008. 
  Protocol Number 44-03054-000  
CONFIDENTIAL 14 09Sept2022 Rev 1   In 2021, several optional features were added to the NeuroStar TMS system including a feature called “SoftStart”. When enabled, SoftStart introduces a series of stepped pulses within each pulse train which alters the pulse magnitude during the beginning and ending of a treatment pulse train. The pulse train gradually increases (ramps up) in magnitude (MT Level) until the prescribed MT treatment level has been obtained. At the conclusion of the 40 pulses in the train at the prescribed MT level, a series of pulses ramp down before the intertrain interval rest period begins.  For some patients, sensitivity at the treatment site can cause discomfort and studies have been conducted to investigate ways to improve patient comfort and prevent dropout due to intolerance of treatment.21 Patient intolerance can not only increase drop-out but also prevent patients from reaching the prescribed dose or reduce the number of treatments delivered at the prescribed dose. For accurate, safe, and effective application of brain stimulation, it is essential that an appropriate level of electric current be induced within a target region. Under stimulation reduces the probability of detecting significant results and deprives patients of necessary treatment dosages. 20   By ramping pulses from 60% to 100% of the programmed treatment level, SoftStart was designed to improve treatment comfort, which could also allow patients to reach the prescribed treatment intensity more easily or reach that intensity in a shorter time which will provide patients with a greater percentage of their pulses at the full prescribed dose.    The objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of SoftStart on patient comfort when treated with TMS for major depression. The impact of SoftStart on the ability and the time taken to reach the prescribed dose of TMS and other secondary factors associated with patient comfort will also be evaluated. 
 STUDY DESIGN 
 General Description This study is a prospective, randomized, single blind study to be conducted in 40 adults who have been prescribed treatment for MDD with rTMS. The study will be performed at a single site, where MDD patients, if eligible, may provide consent and participate. Prior to rTMS stimulation, the Motor Threshold (MT) will be established for each subject individually. Each subject will be evaluated for up to 2 weeks during their normal TMS treatment protocol, then exited from the study. The total study duration is expected to be approximately 6 months depending upon enrolment rate. The goal of the study is to monitor and compare patient comfort (treatment area sensitivity) using two different treatment protocols at the start of TMS 
  Protocol Number 44-03054-000  
CONFIDENTIAL 15 09Sept2022 Rev 1   therapy where the stimulation intensity is typically escalated over 1-10 treatments until the patient is comfortable with the prescribed treatment dose (% MT; typically, 120%). Each subject will be treated with rTMS for MDD as diagnosed and prescribed by their treating physician. All study visits will occur during the subject’s normal pre-treatment evaluation and within the first 10 TMS treatment sessions.  Study questionnaires will be administered during screening and during each treatment to evaluate the subject’s perception of comfort specifically related to the TMS therapy provided that day.   Patients will be randomized after consent to receive either the standard Dash protocol (Treatment Y) or the modified Dash protocol with the SoftStart feature enabled (Treatment X). During all treatments, the subject will be blinded to whether they are receiving “Treatment X” or “Treatment Y”.  Ramp Phase: Since during the first few treatment sessions patients are typically ramped up to the desired treatment intensity (%MT) in a subjective manner by the treater, this process will be standardized during the study to minimize this confounding factor on perception of comfort.  For all treatments, the first session will begin at 90% MT and the treater will ask the subject if they can tolerate the treatment intensity at 5 equal time intervals per treatment session (a treatment interval is 3 minutes and 45 seconds (3:45)). If tolerance is acceptable, the treater will increase the treatment intensity by 10% with the objective of reaching 120% by the end of the first treatment session. Dosage escalations during treatment will be limited to these 5 equal time intervals; however, dosage decreases can be done at any point due to patient intolerance.  Treatment intensity changes will not be communicated to the subject.  The treatment intensity achieved at each interval will be logged and documented in the study CRF.  After the first interval (3:45), and after each stimulation session the subject will be asked to complete a “Comfort/Pain” VAS scale from (0-10cm). Once the subject completes the last 3:45 of a treatment session at 120%MT, they will begin their Crossover phase at the start of the next session.  If a subject does not reach 120% MT by the end of the fifth treatment session, dose escalation attempts will continue, but they will transition to the Crossover phase. Refer to Attachment D for details of the Dose Escalation process. Crossover Phase: At the start of the 6th Treatment session or the session after the subject reaches the prescribed dose, the subject will be crossed over to the alternative treatment protocol and continue to alternate treatment each day for the next 3 treatments. Each day of these 4 treatment sessions, 
  Protocol Number 44-03054-000  
CONFIDENTIAL 16 09Sept2022 Rev 1   at the first time interval (3:45) and the end of the session the subject will complete the comfort/pain questionnaire and be asked whether they preferred the current treatment, or the treatment received at the previous session (Todays Treatment, Last Treatment, No Difference).  After the final study treatment, the treatment protocol planned for remaining TMS sessions, and reason for choosing it, will be documented as a secondary study endpoint and the subject will be exited from the study.  All further treatments will be conducted at the discretion of the treating physician. After the full study is over, subjects may be informed of the actual difference in treatments they received but will be informed that other patients may have received different treatments and the assignment was randomized. Subjects will be encouraged to complete the study, however, upon request, subjects may discontinue the study and protocol assigned treatment at any time. The treatment protocol for further TMS sessions will be determined by the clinician and the patient as part of their normal care.  
 Treatment Selection, Risk and Discontinuation In this study, only patients who are prescribed and treated with the Dash protocol (rTMS stimulation in the Left Dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (L-DLPFC)) are eligible to participate the study. In clinical practice the choice to utilize the SoftStart feature with Dash is up to the treating physician.  In this study, initial treatment with the Dash protocol or Dash with the SoftStart feature enabled will be assigned by randomization. Both these treatment options are commercially available, and none of the treatment parameters required by the study are experimental.  The protocol requirement of randomization and all subjects alternating between SoftStart and standard Dash treatments will not impose additional risk to the subject other than the potential for minor additional discomfort for those patients who receive the first few treatments with the standard Dash protocol when they may have been treated with the SoftStart feature if not part of this study.  MT determinations and rTMS stimulation sessions will be administered under the supervision of the study physician.  Patients may discontinue the study, in consultation with their treating physician, at any time. All personnel performing these specific activities must have clinical experience sufficient to provide immediate clinical support in the event of a seizure, or other adverse events.

 STUDY PROCEDURES 
 Study Visits This is a prospective, randomized, single blind, cross-over study in an adult population. Only patients who have already consented to treatment with rTMS for MDD as diagnosed and prescribed by their treating physician will be enrolled in this study. The study consists of up to 10 visits; Visit 1 for subject screening and Visits 2-10 for treatment administration which will be conducted concurrently with the subjects scheduled rTMS stimulation sessions.  Study visits are estimated to take approximately 30 minutes in addition to the patient’s regular rTMS treatment visits. The study visits will be conducted in 2 phases:  Ramp Phase: The intent of the first 1-5 treatment visits is to evaluate the differences between treatment groups on subject comfort as the subjects are ramped to the prescribed treatment dose.  This phase will also evaluate the impact of the two treatments on the ability and the time to achieve the prescribed treatment dose. Crossover Phase: The intent of the crossover phase is to evaluate comfort differences and subject treatment preference between treatment groups and within subjects. In addition, the ability, and the time to reach the prescribed dose for those subjects who may not have reached it in the first 5 treatment sessions will continue to be assessed. Details of the study visits are described below and on the subject flow diagram in section 14.2. Screening/Baseline Study Visit During Visit 1, the subject will be informed about the study and will be screened for eligibility to participate against the inclusion and exclusion criteria (including medication and medical 
  Protocol Number 44-03054-000  
CONFIDENTIAL 19 09Sept2022 Rev 1   history). Eligible subjects will have the study and consent process explained to them and be provided the informed consent form to sign, or to return signed on Day 1 of TMS Treatment. Ramp Phase: Treatment Visit 1 Once signed consent is obtained, in addition to the treating clinicians’ normal TMS instruction, subjects will receive instruction about the study procedures including the completion of comfort, preference and depression scales at the time of treatment for up to 9 treatments. Medication changes and recent medical history, including adverse events will be reviewed. Next, the PHQ-9 questionnaire will be completed, and subjects will have their Motor Threshold determined by the standard of care practice of the treating clinician and be randomized to receive their first rTMS stimulation with either treatment X or treatment Y. The %MT treatment goal of 120% will be established by the physician. Subjects will have their Motor Threshold determined by the standard of care practice of the treating clinician and the first stimulation will be programmed to begin at 90% MT. Subjects will then be randomized to rTMS stimulation with either treatment X or treatment Y and have their first randomized stimulation treatment with the NeuroStar TMS Therapy System. Subject MT may be re-established and documented at the discretion of the treating physician at any time. Treatment Assessments: Once TMS therapy begins, adjustments to lower the stimulation intensity can begin immediately, as needed, for subject tolerance. Every 3:45 minutes the TMS treater will assess if the subject can tolerate escalating the treatment MT by 10%. At each interval and the end of treatment, the treater will record the current %MT achieved. The goal will be to reach and sustain the target MT established by the treating physician of 120%MT. Once the target MT has been achieved and sustained for 3:45 minutes, recording and increases of %MT may be discontinued, but re-started at 3:45 minute intervals if %MT is subsequently reduced. At minute 3:45, and at the end of the treatment session, the subject will be asked to complete a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), for Comfort/Pain. If the subject reaches the prescribed %MT at Treatment Visit 1, the next study visit will be the start of the crossover phase of the study (Crossover Treatment 1), if not, they will continue to the next visit of the Ramp Phase.  
  Protocol Number 44-03054-000  
CONFIDENTIAL 20 09Sept2022 Rev 1   Treatment Visits 2-5  Subjects will start treatment at the %MT established in the previous session and all study treatment procedures completed on Treatment Visit 1 will be repeated and documented for Treatment Visits 2-5. In addition, at the first time interval of 3:45, subjects will be asked a preference question - if they prefer the current treatment, last treatment, or if they cannot determine a difference. This question will be repeated at the end of the treatment visit. If the subject reaches the prescribed %MT at any of these visits and sustains that MT through the final 3:45 minute time interval, the next study visit will be the start of the crossover phase of the study (Crossover Treatment 1). If the subject does not achieve the prescribed MT by the end of the 5th Treatment session, they will continue to Crossover Treatment 1 at the next visit, however, attempts to achieve the prescribed %MT should continue and be documented. Crossover Phase Visit 1  Subjects will be crossed over to the alternative treatment protocol, those who had received treatment X will then receive treatment Y and vice versa. Subjects will start treatment at the %MT established in the previous session and all study treatment assessments completed on Treatment Visits 2-5 of the Ramp Phase will be repeated and documented for each visit of the Crossover Phase.  Visits 2-4 Subjects will be crossed over to the alternative treatment protocol, those who had received treatment X will then receive treatment Y and vice versa. At the start of treatment, subjects will start treatment at the %MT established in the previous session and all study treatment assessments completed on Crossover visit 1 will be repeated. Visit 4: Final Crossover Visit At the start of treatment for Crossover visit 4, subjects will be crossed over to the alternative treatment protocol, subjects will start treatment at the %MT established in the previous treatment and all study treatment assessments completed on Crossover visit 1 will be repeated. At the end of the final treatment, the treatment protocol for further TMS sessions will be determined by the clinician and the patient as part of their normal care. The treatment choice will be documented, and the subject will be exited from the study. See subject flow diagram in section 14.2 for additional information.

 Discontinuation and Withdrawal of Subjects Subjects may withdraw voluntarily from the study at any time. They may be withdrawn from the study by the Investigator if: • A serious adverse event (SAE) occurs. • The Investigator believes that for safety reasons it is in the best interest of the subject to be withdrawn. • The subject withdraws consent. • A positive urine drug screen at any visit. • A positive pregnancy test at any visit; the subject reports pregnancy. • Inability to locate and quantify a motor threshold as defined in the protocol or a motor threshold above 1.6 SMT. • Investigator sets a treatment goal below 120% of MT. Discontinuation information [e.g., date and the reason(s) for discontinuation] must be recorded in the subject’s CRF (i.e., Study Termination Record page).  Follow-up information will be obtained for subjects who experience an SAE. Subjects withdrawn from the study will not be replaced. 
 Compensation As an incentive to complete the study and compensation for their time and effort, participants will be offered a $50 stipend if they complete all study treatment visits or discontinue due to intolerance of treatment. 
 DEVICE DESCRIPTION AND RTMS ADMINISTRATION 
 Device Description The NeuroStar TMS Therapy System is a computerized electromechanical instrument that produces and delivers brief duration, rapidly alternating (pulsed) magnetic fields to induce electrical currents in localized regions of the cerebral cortex. The NeuroStar TMS Therapy System is offered in the following configurations:  • Single mobile console configuration: mobile console, rTMS stimulation coil, head support system, chair, and TMS TrakStar practice data management system.  
  Protocol Number 44-03054-000  
CONFIDENTIAL 22 09Sept2022 Rev 1   • Multiple mobile consoles/TMS TrakStar system configurations to address the needs of facilities with large subject populations.  During TMS, the conductive substance of interest is the brain, in particular the region of the cortex that lies beneath the NeuroStar TMS Therapy System treatment coil. This is the NeuroStar TMS Therapy System component that rests against the subject’s head and transmits magnetic pulses to the subject’s brain. The induced current is tangential to the scalp at the cortical surface and diminishes in magnitude with increasing depth.  For further detailed description on the NeuroStar TMS Therapy System, see the User Manual.

 MEASURES TO AVOID STUDY BIAS 
 Subject Identification Each subject will be assigned a unique screening number after signing the study consent. This number will consist of an assigned unique, 3-digit subject identifier. For example, the first subject screened would be subject 001.  Subjects should be identified to the Sponsor only by their assigned number, age and sex. The Investigator must maintain a master list linking subject names and the identifying information indicated above. 
 Randomization A randomization schedule will be generated by Neuronetics or a designated contract research organization (CRO). Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to the Dash treatment protocol (Y) or Dash with the SoftStart feature enabled (X). Randomization numbers will be recorded in the screening log and on the subject’s CRF. Randomization numbers may not be reassigned. 
 Blinding Subjects will be blinded to all treatments. Subjects will be randomized to begin with either treatment X or treatment Y. Treaters and Clinicians will be aware of the treatment protocol assignments once assigned to subjects. Treaters will administer the Comfort scale but will not score the scales. Subjects will not be able to view previous responses to the Comfort, Preference or Depression questionnaires. Treater scripts will be used to administer the TMS changes and subject questionnaires. 
 Treatment Consistency The same treater and same TMS treatment unit will be utilized for each subject whenever possible over the course of the study treatments.  
 COMFORT EVALUATIONS Primary endpoint: The difference in the change in VAS scores for Comfort after rTMS stimulation between treatments administered with the Dash protocol and treatments administered with the Dash protocol with SoftStart feature enabled. Comfort will be evaluated as a change for all observations between groups, observations from Baseline to end of escalation phase, observations between groups during the crossover phase and observations 
  Protocol Number 44-03054-000  
CONFIDENTIAL 25 09Sept2022 Rev 1   within a patient between treatments in the cross-over phase. Comfort will also be analyzed over time and by number of treatments between groups. See also section 18. In the event that adverse events occur, those data will be summarized using standard descriptive statistics (frequency distributions, percentages, listings). 
 SAFETY EVALUATIONS A medical history will be obtained at the screening visit including a list of medications and history contraindicated for TMS therapy and this protocol.  All spontaneous adverse events, serious or non-serious will be recorded during and after the rTMS stimulation procedures. Serious Adverse Events will be reported to Neuronetics by the study center within one business day of notification.  Neuronetics will report any and all SAEs and other safety events, as applicable, to the IRB and/or the FDA within the pre-specified timeframes, as applicable.   
 Adverse Event Definitions An adverse event is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiological observations occurring in a person who has received rTMS stimulation with a Neuronetics device or in a Neuronetics clinical study. The event need not be causally related to the Neuronetics device or Neuronetics clinical trial. An AE includes, but is not limited to: • Any clinically significant worsening of a pre-existing condition. • An AE occurring from overdose (i.e., a dose higher than that described in the protocol) of a Neuronetics device, whether accidental or intentional. • An AE occurring from abuse (e.g., use for non-clinical reasons) of a Neuronetics device. • An AE that has been associated with the discontinuation of the use of a Neuronetics device; A preexisting condition is a clinical condition (including a condition being treated) that is diagnosed before an informed consent form is signed and is documented as part of the subject’s medical history. A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined by Neuronetics as an AE that: • Results in death: • Is life threatening (see below). • Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an existing hospitalization.  
  Protocol Number 44-03054-000  
CONFIDENTIAL 26 09Sept2022 Rev 1   • Results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure. • Necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude such impairment. • Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect. Additionally, important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization, may be considered SAEs, based upon appropriate medical judgment. Life threatening refers to immediate risk of death as the event occurred per the reporter. A life-threatening event does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death, but as it actually occurred, did not create an immediate risk of death.  Hospitalization is to be considered only as an overnight admission. Hospitalization or prolongation of a hospitalization constitutes an AE to be classified as serious. Note that hospitalizations planned before the start of the study, for a preexisting condition that has not worsened, do not constitute an SAE (e.g., elective hospitalization for a total knee replacement due to a preexisting condition of osteoarthritis of the knee that has not worsened during the study). Anticipated adverse events: Anticipated events such as Headache, Dizziness, and Ear popping do not need to be recorded unless they are higher in frequency, severity, or duration than considered normal for TMS therapy.  For this study, these events should be noted on the patient treatment form in the comments area. Adverse Events of Special Interest: An adverse event of special interest is a device-specific adverse event designated by Neuronetics to be reported in the same time frame as an SAE, even if it does not meet serious reporting criteria.  For this protocol, seizure should be reported as an adverse event of special interest. If there is any doubt whether the information constitutes an SAE, the information should be treated as an SAE for the purpose of this study. Definition of Severity The seriousness and severity must be evaluated independently when documenting the AEs in the records.  There are three definitions of AE severity: Mild:  Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  Moderate:  Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  Severe:  Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity 
  Protocol Number 44-03054-000  
CONFIDENTIAL 27 09Sept2022 Rev 1    Determining the Relationship: (if any) Between an Adverse Event and the Study Device:  Not related:  The AE is unlikely to have been caused by study device. Possibly related:  It is unclear whether the AE may have been caused by study device. Related:  The AE is likely to or definitely have been caused by study device. When assessing the relationship between an investigational product/protocol and an AE, the following parameters are considered: • Temporal relationship between the investigational device/protocol and the AE • Biologic plausibility of relationship • Subjects’ underlying clinical state or concomitant agents/therapies • Where applicable, whether the AE abates on discontinuation of the investigational device (dechallenge) SAEs that are not device-related may nevertheless be considered by the participating Investigator or Neuronetics Medical Affairs to be related to the conduct of the clinical study, i.e., to a subject’s participation in the study. 
 Timing for Reporting of Serious Adverse Events Any SAE (as defined above) regardless of causal relationship, must be reported immediately to Neuronetics Medical Affairs (within one business day) by emailing to Neuronetics a completed serious adverse event form to customersupport@neurostar.com and then confirming by telephone (870-600-7555) that the email was received. If no direct phone contact is made, the investigator should repeat attempts to notify Neuronetics Inc. or designated representative until receipt is acknowledged. The SAE may be reported using IRB required forms, or Neuronetics forms 25-44028-000, Serious Adverse Event Form, or 25-80031-000, Medical Event Form. Compliance with this time requirement is essential so that Neuronetics may comply with its regulatory obligations.  Follow-up information relating to an SAE must also be reported to Neuronetics Medical Affairs within one (1) business day after the information is received. The patient should be observed and monitored carefully until the condition resolves or stabilizes or its cause is identified. Any emergency must be reported to the Neuronetics Medical Affairs immediately (within one business day). For all other inquiries and information about this study, contact the Clinical Operations representative identified in Section 1.1 of this protocol. 
  Protocol Number 44-03054-000  
CONFIDENTIAL 28 09Sept2022 Rev 1   
 Reportable Events All AEs and SAEs, regardless of relationship to the protocol or rTMS device, that are collected during the rTMS stimulation procedure will be recorded on source documents and recorded on the subject’s CRFs. Neuronetics will instruct the Investigator to follow all AEs, SAEs, and other reportable events until the event has subsided or values have returned to baseline, or in case of permanent impairment, until the condition stabilizes.  The Investigator will provide all documentation pertaining to an SAE (e.g., additional laboratory tests, consultation reports, discharge summaries, postmortem reports, etc.) to the medical monitor in a timely manner. Reports relative to the subject’s subsequent course must be submitted to the Sponsor until the event has subsided or, in case of permanent impairment, until the condition stabilizes. Other information reportable to Neuronetics, while not meeting the definition of an AE, is reportable to Neuronetics with the timeliness of an SAE. This includes: • Pregnancy occurring during the study period in which the subject was exposed to the rTMS device. • Overdose (e.g., a dose higher than that prescribed by a healthcare professional for clinical reasons) with or without AEs. • Abuse (e.g., use for non-clinical reasons) with or without an AE. • Inadvertent or accidental exposure with or without an AE. • Device malfunction that would likely result in death, serious injury or other significant adverse event. 
 Reporting Procedures  All AEs collected during stimulation visits will be recorded in the adverse event record of the subject’s CRF. The information recorded should be based on the signs or symptoms detected during the physical examination and clinical evaluation of the subject. Signs and symptoms should be recorded using standard medical terminology. The following AE information must be included (when applicable): the specific condition or event and direction of change; whether the condition was preexisting (i.e., an acute condition present at the start of the study or history of a chronic condition) and, if so, whether it has worsened (e.g., in severity and/or frequency); the dates and times of occurrence; duration; severity; causal relationship to the product under study ; action taken; and outcome.  
  Protocol Number 44-03054-000  
CONFIDENTIAL 29 09Sept2022 Rev 1   IRB Reporting:  Any AE’s/SAE’s should also be reported in writing to the reviewing IRB, per their requirements. MDR Reporting:  As the study device is commercially available, all adverse events also need to be reported through FDA’s MDR reporting system. https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/ Follow-up of Adverse Events All AEs recorded during the study are to be followed in accordance with good medical practice until they are: • resolved, stabilized, or judged no longer clinically significant, or • if a chronic condition, until fully characterized, or • for 30 days, which may extend through the follow-up phase for treatment related AEs or SAEs that occur or are ongoing at the last treatment session.  
 Safety Monitoring for Potential Seizure Risk All treatment protocols in this study do not deviate from FDA cleared treatment parameters for NeuroStar TMS. All subjects will be assessed during the screening phase for neurologic disease, concurrent medication use, or other clinical factors that may contribute to the risk of seizure. Stimulation parameters maintain a safety level within the guidelines consistent with the 1998 NINDS workshop recommendations. All personnel involved in the administration of rTMS in this study will be required to participate in individual site initiation visits and/or complete other sponsor training requirements and be able to demonstrate understanding of these issues for the sponsor prior to initiation of subject enrollment at the site. 
 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS PLAN Statistical analyses will be performed by the Biostatistics Section of the Sponsor or its designee. Any additional or supplemental data analyses performed independently by the Investigator should be submitted to the Sponsor for review and approval.  
 Sample Size Considerations  A sample size of 40 total subjects, twenty to begin treatment with each of Treatments X and Y was selected as sufficient to perform a preliminary assessment of the differences between the two repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapies for MDD. The sample size is 
  Protocol Number 44-03054-000  
CONFIDENTIAL 30 09Sept2022 Rev 1   not based on formal power requirements for a statistical hypothesis test but is based on a desire to obtain a reasonable initial data set for exploratory and planning purposes. 
 Analysis Plan The primary outcome is the difference in comfort and pain observed between rTMS stimulation protocols using VAS comfort scores. The analysis will be performed on the sample of evaluable subjects, meaning those subjects with at least one post-treatment time point. • Descriptive analysis of subject demographics and other baseline variables.  • Primary Outcome Assessment:  The Primary study outcome will be determined based on differences in the mean VAS ratings on a 0-10cm VAS scale for comfort between treatment arms. • Secondary Outcome Assessment: The Secondary objectives are to evaluate the ability to reach the prescribed treatment intensity, the time it takes to reach the prescribed treatment intensity, maximum treatment intensity reached, patient treatment preference and discontinuations due to treatment discomfort. Other treatment effects between the two treatment protocols will be explored. • Comparison of the incidence, severity, and frequency of Adverse Events (AE) between the experimental and the control group will be made descriptively. • Statistical methods employed to detect differences between the experimental and the control groups, for the above outcomes, may include a t-test, Chi-Square test, and Fisher’s Exact test. For assessments including crossovers, a relevant method accounting for period effect, repeated measures, and randomized order will be utilized.   • Subgroup analysis will be performed based on initial comfort scores, group assignments or other variables. • More detailed descriptions of the statistical methodology and analyses will be supplied in a separate SAP (statistical analysis plan).

CONFIDENTIAL 34 09Sept2022 Rev 1   
 Protocol Amendments Any significant change in this protocol requires a protocol amendment. The Investigator and the medical monitor will indicate their approval by signing the approval page of the amendment. After sponsor approval of a protocol amendment, the Investigator will submit the amendment to the IRB for written approval. The approval letter must refer specifically to the Investigator, the sponsor protocol number, the protocol title, the protocol amendment number, and the date of the protocol amendment. The Sponsor will submit a copy of the protocol amendment to the appropriate regulatory agency.  A protocol amendment may be implemented following IRB approval. In some cases, an amendment must receive a favorable opinion from the regulatory agency. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to subjects may be implemented immediately, but the change must then be documented in an amendment, reported to the IRB within 5 working days, and submitted to the appropriate regulatory agency in the required time frame. 
 Change in Investigator If any Investigator retires, relocates, or otherwise withdraws from conducting this study, the responsibility for maintaining records may be transferred to the Sponsor, IRB, or other Investigator. The Sponsor must be notified of and agree to the change. Regulatory agencies will be notified with the appropriate documentation. 
 Termination by the Sponsor The sponsor may terminate the study at any time for any of the following reasons: 1. Failure to enrol subjects. 2. Protocol violations. 3. Inaccurate or incomplete data. 4. Unsafe or unethical practices. 5. Questionable safety of the test article. 6. Suspected lack of efficacy of the test article. 7. Administrative decision. 
 Termination by the Investigator If the Investigator terminates the study prematurely, he/she must: 
  Protocol Number 44-03054-000  
CONFIDENTIAL 35 09Sept2022 Rev 1   1. Return all investigational devices, CRFs, and related study materials to the Sponsor. 2. Provides the IRB and the sponsor with a written statement describing why the study was terminated prematurely. Note: Prompt compliance with this requirement is essential so that the sponsor may comply with its regulatory obligations. 
 Final Study Report The Investigator will complete a report notifying the IRB of the conclusion of the clinical study. This report should be made within 3 months of completion or termination of the study. The final report sent to the IRB will also be sent to Neuronetics and, along with the completed CRFs, will constitute the final summary to Neuronetics, thereby fulfilling the Investigator’s regulatory responsibility. When the Sponsor generates reports for presentations to regulatory agencies, one or more of the Investigators who have contributed significantly to the study will be asked to endorse the final report. The endorsement is required by some regulatory agencies. 
 Confidentiality All unpublished information provided to the Investigator by the Sponsor shall be kept confidential and shall not be published or disclosed to a third party without the prior written consent of the Sponsor.  The Investigator shall not make a patent application based on the results of this study and shall not assist any third party in making such an application without the written authorization of the sponsor unless otherwise specified in the study agreement. 
 Publications The institution and Investigator shall not publish or present data from the study center until the study has been presented in full or for two years after the termination of the study, whichever occurs first. Subsequent publications must refer to the multicenter findings. Thereafter, if the Investigator expects to participate in the publication of data generated from this site, the institution and Investigator shall submit reports, abstracts, manuscripts and/or other presentation materials to the Sponsor for review prior to submission for publication or presentation.  The Sponsor shall have 60 days to respond with any requested revisions, including without limitation, the deletion of confidential information.

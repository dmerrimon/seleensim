  1  1. RCT Details This section provides a high-level overview of the RCT that the described real-world evidence study is trying to replicate as closely as possible given the remaining limitations inherent in the healthcare databases.   1.1 Title Ticagrelor versus Clopidogrel in Patients with Acute Coronary Syndromes (PLATO trial)  1.2 Intended aim(s)  Compared ticagrelor (180-mg loading dose, 90 mg twice daily thereafter) and clopidogrel (300-to-600-mg loading dose, 75 mg daily thereafter) for the prevention of cardiovascular events in 18,624 patients admitted to the hospital with an acute coronary syndrome, with or without ST-segment elevation.  1.3 Primary endpoint for replication and RCT finding  a composite of death from vascular causes, myocardial infarction, or stroke  1.4 Required power for primary endpoint and noninferiority margin (if applicable)  Estimated that 1780 such events would be required to achieve 90% power to detect a relative risk reduction of 13.5% in the rate of the primary end point in the ticagrelor group as compared with the clopidogrel group, given an event rate of 11% in the clopidogrel group at 12 months.  1.5 Primary trial estimate targeted for replication  HR = 0.84 (95% CI 0.77–0.92) comparing ticagrelor to clopidogrel (Wallentin et al., 2009)  2.

 4  5. Cohort Identification   5.1 Cohort Summary This study will involve a new user, parallel group, cohort study design comparing ticagrelor 90mg twice daily to clopidogrel 75mg daily. The patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during the baseline period of 180 days before initiation of ticagrelor 90mg or the comparator drug (cohort entry date). Follow-up for the outcome (3P-MACE), begins the day after drug initiation.    5.2 Important steps for cohort formation  New users (defined as no use in 180 days prior to index date) of an exposure and a comparator drug will be identified.  5.2.1 Eligible cohort entry dates Market availability of ticagrelor in the U.S. started on 2011-07-20.       • For Marketscan: 2011-07-20 to 2017-12-31 (end of data availability).  • For Optum: 2011-07-20 to 2019-03-31 (end of data availability).  5.2.2 Specify inclusion/exclusion criteria for cohort entry and define the index date  Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible.

 6 Final cohort   41,446   40,849   6. Variables   6.1 Exposure-related variables:   Study drug:  The study exposure of interest is initiation of ticagrelor. Initiation will be defined as starting treatment with ticagrelor or a comparator drug with no prior use of the corresponding drug in the past 6 months (washout period).   Comparator agents: • Initiators of ticagrelor 90mg will be compared to initiators of- o Clopidogrel 75mg   6.2 Preliminary covariates: • Age • Sex • Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the default baseline covariate assessment period, defined as 180 days prior to and including index date  Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and analysis. We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient overlap between treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the initial feasibility analysis and the initial power assessment and are listed in Table 1 (Appendix B).  6.3 Outcome variables and study follow-up:   6.3.1 Outcome variables

 8  6.3.2 Study follow-up Both as-treated (AT) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses will be conducted with treatment defined as the index drug on the day of cohort entry. Because adherence in the real-world databases is expected to be much worse than in the trial, the AT analysis is the primary analysis, as it targets the relative hazard of outcomes on treatment.   For the AT analyses, the follow-up will start the day after initiation of ticagrelor and comparator and will continue until the earliest date of the following events: • The first occurrence of the outcome of interest, unless otherwise specified for selected outcomes,  • The date of end of continuous registration in the database, • End of the study period, • Measured death event occurs, • Nursing home admission o Nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized typically provide little to no data on a patient, particularly on drug utilization, after admission. We will utilize this as an exclusion reason for cohorts for the same reason. * 482.39 - PNEUMONIA DUE TO OTHER STREPTOCOCCUS * 482.4 - PNEUMONIA DUE TO STAPHYLOCOCCUS * 482.40 - PNEUMONIA DUE TO STAPHYLOCOCCUS UNSPECIFIED * 482.41 - METHICILLIN SUSCEPTIBLE PNEUMONIA DUE TO STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS * 482.42 - METHICILLIN RESISTANT PNEUMONIA DUE TO STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS * 482.49 - OTHER STAPHYLOCOCCUS PNEUMONIA * 482.8 - PNEUMONIA DUE TO OTHER SPECIFIED BACTERIA * 482.81 - PNEUMONIA DUE TO ANAEROBES * 482.82 - PNEUMONIA DUE TO ESCHERICHIA COLI [E.COLI] * 482.83 - PNEUMONIA DUE TO OTHER GRAM-NEGATIVE BACTERIA * 482.84 - PNEUMONIA DUE TO LEGIONNAIRES' DISEASE * 482.89 - PNEUMONIA DUE TO OTHER SPECIFIED BACTERIA * 482.9 - BACTERIAL PNEUMONIA UNSPECIFIED * 483.0 - PNEUMONIA DUE TO MYCOPLASMA PNEUMONIAE * 483.1 - PNEUMONIA DUE TO CHLAMYDIA * 483.8 - PNEUMONIA DUE TO OTHER SPECIFIED ORGANISM * 507.0 - PNEUMONITIS DUE TO INHALATION OF FOOD OR VOMITUS * 507.1 - PNEUMONITIS DUE TO INHALATION OF OILS AND ESSENCES * 507.8 - PNEUMONITIS DUE TO OTHER SOLIDS AND LIQUIDS

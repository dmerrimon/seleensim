CONFIDENTIAL  11  3/25/2021  1 STUDY SUMMARY  
Study Number  OPI-NYXDLD -301 
Clinical Phase  Phase 3  
Type of Study  Randomized, placebo -controlled, double -masked , multiple -
dose study of the safety and efficacy of Nyxol (0.75% 
Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution) in subjects with dim light 
vision disturbances (DLD).  
Name of 
Investigational 
Product  Nyxol® Eye Drops – 0.75% Phentolamine Ophthalmic 
Solution  
Duration of Study  Approximately 3 weeks, including screening , treatment , and 
follow -up. 
Rationale  DLD , which includes night vision disturbances,  affects patients 
under mesopic or scotopic conditions.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
When the pupil dilates in people with DLD , peripheral 
aberrations scatter light rays res ulting in these visual 
aberrations , a loss of mesopic low-contrast visual acuity 
(mLCVA) and contrast sensitivity (CS). It is proposed that a 
moderate pharmacologic reduction of pupil size (20 -25%) by 
the application of an alpha -1 antagonist has the potential to 
mitigate DLD in many affected individuals.  
Phentolamine is a non -selective a lpha-1 and alpha -2 adrenergic 
antagonist acting on the adrenergic receptors and inhibiting 
contraction of the smooth muscle. When topically applied, 
phentolamine inhibits contraction of the iris dilator muscle, 
resulting in a smaller pupil size.  
Previous P hase 2 clinical trials showed that Nyxol  significantly 
decreases pupil diameter (PD) and improve s mLCVA  in DLD  
subjects after single - and multi -dose (14 days) treatment.  
Nyxol  was generally well -tolerated in the eye (most common 
complaint was transient mild-to-moderate ocular hyperemia 
and eye irritation) and there were no clinically meaningful 
systemic effects as measured by heart rate (HR) and blood 
pressure (BP) .

OPI-NYXDLD -301 LYNX -1 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  12  3/25/2021  Study Objectives  The objectives of this study are:  
• To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol  to improve m LCVA  
in subjects  with DLD  
• To evaluate the efficacy of Nyxol  to improve visual 
performance  
• To evaluate the safety of Nyxol  
• To evaluate any additional benefits of Nyxol in 
treating DLD subjects  
The Sponsor intends to use this first Phase 3 registration study 
to evaluate Nyxol for the indication of “treatment of symptoms 
associated with dim light or night v ision disturbances.”  
Design  Placebo -controlled, double -masked, multiple -dose, Phase 3 
study in approximately  160 randomized subjects with DLD  
(approximately 136 that are  evaluable for efficacy ), evaluating 
safety and efficacy of Nyxol in subjects with DLD  following 
administration of Nyxol  once daily ( QD) at or near bedtime (at 
8PM to 10PM ) in both eyes  (OU) for 14 days . 
Following the successful completion of screening, each subject 
will be stratified by iris color  (light/dark irides)  and will then 
be randomized  to treatment (masked)  1:1, Nyxol or placebo 
(vehicle).  
Treatment ( Nyxol or placebo) will be administered OU by the 
subjects at or near bedtime  each day.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The study eye and non -study eye , as well as 
binocular , will be evaluated at all appropriate assessments.  
Subject  Population  Approximately 160 randomized ( approximately 136 that are 
evaluable for efficacy ) subjects  experiencing DLD  
Inclusion Criteria  1. Males or females ≥ 18 years  of age

conjunctival hyperemia on the biomicroscopy 
electronic Case Report Form at screening)  
• Slit lamp biomic roscopy  
The subject must also meet dry eye Exclusion Criteri on #13 to 
be included in the study  at the determination of the 
investigator . Specifically, subjects with undiagnosed dry ey e 
may undergo a dry eye test. 
Final screening must  include IOP measurement (using a Tono -
Pen) and ophthalmoscopy . 
With the subject passing all eligibility criteria, the Screening 
Visit becomes the Baseline Visit. The subject will then be 
assigned a randomization number and randomized into the 
study.  
See Table  2 for details on measurements expected at each visit.   
The first dose of study medication must  be taken by the subject 
at 8PM to 10PM on the Baseline Visit (Day 1).  
All treatments will be administered OU.  
Treatment Visits  Treatment visits will occur 2 times : Day 8 (±1 day)/Visit 2  and 
Day 1 5 (±1 day)/Visit 3 . mLCVA evaluations shall be 
performed on each of these days.  
 
 Other assessments as defined in Table  2 shall  be 
performed at these visits .

Sample Size 
Justification  A sample size of approximately  136 subjects (68 per treatment 
group)  that are evaluable for efficacy  (i.e. who have a Day 8 
mLCVA measurement ) is needed for the study.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All subjects will be randomized into the study in a 1:1 ratio to 
one of the  treatment  arms  (Nyxol or placebo) , with a 
 
It is assumed that there will be approximately  15% drop -out. 
To account for this drop -out, a total of  approximately 160 
subjects will be randomized into the study.  
Primary Efficacy

Subject will be 
allowed to acclimate to these lighting cond itions (with the eyes 
open normally for a minimum of  prior to the  set of  
PD, BCDVA , DCNVA, and wavefront error measurements ). 
Subject will sit in the exam chair facing directly  at the 
illuminated  chart  during the acclimation period and for all 
assessments. Room lights may be turned on for the scheduled 
remaining safety assessments (e.g. , conjunctival hyperemia, 
AEs, subject questionnaire, etc.). The subject will be in the 
same room for all assessments, and every effort will be made 
to have the same person perform the measurements at all visits . 
All of the efficacy endpoints will be analyzed  overall, and by 
 at all timepoints . The mLCVA endpoints will  
be analyzed by baseline  PD  and higher -
order aberrations subpoint . 
All efficacy endpoints wi ll be analyzed by Modified Intention 
to Treat  (mITT ) and Per Protocol (PP)  population s. 
 Safety Endpoints  The primary safety measures are conjunctival hyperemia  and 
AEs.  
Analysis for conjunctival hyperemia includes change from 
baseline (Day 1) in the conjunctival hyperemia grading scale 
(CCLRU images) at each visit (Day 8 and Day 15), for study 
eye and non -study eye. Any increase of 2 units in conjunctival 
hypere mia between consecutive visits is considered an AE.  
Other  safety  measures  include  intraocular  pressure  (IOP) , 
biomicroscopy,  ophthalmoscopy,  dry eye measurements,  and

CONFIDENTIAL  25  3/25/2021  2 INTRODUCTION  
2.1 Investigational Products  
The test product is Nyxol® Eye Drops – 0.75% Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution 
(Nyxol), a non -selective alpha -1 and alpha -2 adrenergic antagonist. Note that the 
concentration of 0.75% refers to phentolamine free base and  is the same and used in place 
of 1% phentolam ine mesylate drug substance, which was how Nyxol had been described 
in all prior studies. Placebo control is Nyxol vehicle alone.  
2.2 Findings From Nonclinical and Clinical Studies  
Detailed findings from nonclinical and clinical studies and potential risk are provided in 
the Investigators’ Brochure (IB ) (2020). 
Nyxol has been assessed in 7 investigator -initiated and sponsored Phase 1 and Phase 2 
clinical trials. Across all trials, 168 of 232 adult patients were exposed to at least one dose 
of Phentolamine Mesylate Ophthalmic Solution . 
In prior clinical trials, Nyxol has demonstrated a consistent ability to decrease pupil by 
approximately 20% (~1 –1.5 mm) under  both mesopic and photopic conditions . Key pupil 
diameter  (PD) data are summarized below ( Table  1).

monitoring, physical examinations, and vital sign assessments. Across all trials, no healthy 
volunteers or patients reported a treatment -emergent serious adverse event ( SAE ). No 
deaths occurred in any of the trials. No clinically meaning ful changes were observed in 
physical examinations or vital signs, including blood pressure  (BP)  and heart rate  (HR) . 
AEs reported were mild to moderate in intensity , with the most common being transient 
conjunctival hyperemia and ocular irritation; howeve r, Nyxol dosing at or near bedtime  in 
the evening was observed to mitigate or minimize these side effects during the daytime.  
Phase 2 Trial in Patients With Severe NVD (NYX -SNV):  
NYX -SNV was a double -masked, randomized, placebo -controlled, single -dose tria l 
assessing the tolerability and effect of a single topical drop of 1.0% solution of 
phentolamine mesylate in Tears Naturale II in each eye or Tears Naturale II (placebo) on 
PD, contrast sensitivity (CS), visual acuity (VA), and wavefront aberrometry. A to tal of 
24 patients (median age of 39) with severe night vision complain ts were randomly 
assigned 2:1 to treatment groups (active treatment, n = 16; placebo control, n = 8). Patients 
had to demonstrate at least a 2 -line improvement in low -contrast visual ac uity (LCVA) in 
dim light during illumination of the contralateral eye at screening. Each group was treated 
with one drop of test article in each eye. The primary endpoint was a statistically 
significant improvement in the mean change in monocular CS scores  under mesopic 
conditions at each of 5 spatial frequenci es. Key secondary endpoints included 
measurements of LCVA under mesopic and photopic conditions, change in PD, and 
percent of subjects with an improvement in CS (at multiple frequencies), which were 
recorded at baseline (prior to treatment administration) and approximately 2 hours after 
administration.  
The planned United States (US)  Food and Drug Administration  (FDA ) primary endpoint 
was percent of subjects with 15 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study  (ETDRS) 
letters (3 lines)  of improvement in m esopic LCVA  (mLCVA)  at a single timepoint. In this 
trial, even with a small sample size, there was a positive trend of 15-letter (3-line or 
greater) improvement in mLCVA (19% Nyxol vs 0% for pl acebo, p = 0.16) and photopic 
low-contrast visual acuity ( pLCVA) (19% Nyxol vs 0% for placebo, p = 0.16). 
Additionally, greater fractions of Nyxol -treated eyes registered a 1 -line (5 -letter or greater) 
improvement in mLCVA (69% vs 31% for placebo, p = 0.02 9) and pLCVA (63% vs 13% 
for placebo, p = 0.017), as well as a 2 -line (10 -letter or greater) improvement in mLCVA 
(34% vs 6% for placebo, p < 0.03) and pLCVA (28% vs 0% for placebo, p < 0.02) . 
Other distance VA measurements were made , including mesopic dis tance high -contrast 
visual acuity ( mHCVA) and photopic distance high -contrast visual acuity ( pHCVA). 
Greater fractions of Nyxol -treated eyes registered a 2 -line (10 -letter or greater) statistically 
significant improvement in mHCVA (25% vs 0% for placebo, p  < 0.03), with a notable but 
not statistically significant trend in pHCVA (19% vs 0% for placebo, p = NS). Differences 
in mean change in VA between treatments were also seen. There were statistically 
significant improvements with 1% Nyxol from pre -treatmen t across all mean VA 
measurements (p < 0.0001). Further, mean mLCVA showed statistically significant 
improvement for both treatment groups 2  to 3 hours post -treatment, with the mean 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc.  Clinical Protocol

CONFIDENTIAL  27  3/25/2021  magnitude of improvement for phentolamine mesylate –treated  patients being over twice 
that of placebo -treated  patients (8.0 vs 3.1 letters, respectively; p =  0.035).  
Additionally, mean PD decreased at a statistically significant amount of an average of 
1.3 mm (p < 0.0001), or ~20%, for phentolamine mesylate –treated patients, whereas mean 
PD of placebo -treated  patients did not significantly change between pre -treatment and 
post-treatment. The difference in mean change between treatment groups was also 
statistically significant (1.1 mm, p < 0.0001) ( Table  1). In a post-hoc analysis that helped 
inform the Phase 3 trial design, there was an average of ~1.5 mm PD reduction in patients 
with baselines abov e 6 mm, compared to ~1 mm reduction in patients with baselines 
below 6 mm. Measurements were taken 2  to 3 hours after dosing.  
Total wavefront root -mean square  (RMS ) error is the summation of all aberrations 
measured with a wavefront device (VISX -CustomVue  Aberrometer), delineated in µm 
(microns), RMS error for short. Higher -order RMS error is the summation of higher -order 
aberrations , including trefoil, coma, and spherical aberrations that because of their 
complex nature cannot be corrected with regular co rrective lenses. Reduction in higher 
“errors” would be consistent with improvements in dim light vision disturbances ( DLD ). 
In a post-hoc analysis with the purposes to help inform future trials and commercial 
efforts, the difference in change between Nyxol and placebo treatment arms for both total 
RMS (0.42 µm, p  = 0.0004) and higher -order RMS (0.17  μm, p  < 0.0001) were 
statistically signif icant, with Nyxol -treated eyes showing improvement with a larger 
reduction in error . 
In summary, in NYX -SNV , 1% Nyxol demonstrated statistically significant reductions in 
PD and improvement in LCVA under  photopic and mesopic lighting conditions, as well as  
individual CS frequency improvements . Treatment with 1% Nyxol further exhibited a 
statistically significant reduction in aberration errors (errors that affect light transmission 
in specific PD sizes).  
It is important to note that s imilar  results were foun d in NYX -01a2, which was a 15-day, 
double -masked, randomized, placebo -controlled trial in patients with severe DLD.  The 
NYX -01a2  trial demonstrate d a dose response favoring 1% Nyxol. Further, statistically 
significant reductions in PD, trends in improvemen t in LCVA  under  bright and dim 
lighting conditions were shown. Durability of effect on PD was observed 24 hours later for 
Nyxol with daily morning doses.  
Phase 2 Trial in a Glaucomatous and Presbyopic Population  (ORION -1, NYX G-201): 
ORION -1 (NYXG -201) was a double -masked, randomized, placebo -controlled, 
multi -center trial of 1% Nyxol compared with placebo ophthalmic solution for 14 days in 
patients with open -angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. After screening was performed 
based on inclusi on and exclusion criteria, a total of 39 elderly patients (median age of 63) 
were randomized into the trial (Nyxol arm, n = 19; placebo arm, n = 20). These patients 
were either treatment -naïve or were previously taking intraocular pressure (IOP) -lowering 
medication that was  washed out for 30 days prior to dosing. Patients took their study 
medication (Nyxol or placebo) in both eyes  (OU)  between 8PM to 10PM every evening 
for 14 days. Assessments were made on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15, and Day 16. The primary 
efficacy endpoint was change in mean diurnal IOP at Day 15 from baseline. Mean diurnal

CONFIDENTIAL  28  3/25/2021  IOP is the mean of the IOP measurements at 3 timepoints (8AM, 10AM, 4PM). Secondary 
efficacy endpoints included change in PD, change in distance -corrected near visual acuity 
(DCNVA), and change in best -corrected distance visual acuity (BCDVA), as well as 
additional IOP analyses. Safety assessments included measurements of conjunctival 
redness (using the Cornea and Contact Lens Research Unit [CCLRU ] grading 4 -point scale 
[0-3]), AEs, HR, BP, concomitant medications, and pregnancy. Highlights of this trial 
were presented at the 2020 annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and 
Ophthalmology (ARVO) . 
In this study, Nyxol  had statistically significant PD reductions under photopic and mesopic 
conditions that were sustained for 36 hours post -dosing. A statistically significant number 
of patients with Nyxol  compared to placebo demonstrated ≥ 1 line of improvement in 
DCNVA, with a trend for 2 - and 3 -line improvements at a ll time points. There was no 
statistical difference in conjunctival hyperemia compared to placebo.  In summary, daily 
evening dosing of Nyxol  was found to be well tolerated with no daytime conjunctival 
redness and demonstrated improvement in DCNVA with sust ained PD reduction in a 
glaucomatous and presbyopic population. Smaller pupil size can have beneficial effects in 
improving symptoms of patients with DLD , which is relevant to the LYNX -1 trial.  
2.3 Design Justification  
DLD, which includes night vision disturbances,  affects patients under mesopic or scotopic 
conditions. DLD  involves photic phenomena, such as glare, halo s, and starbursts, which 
can be a result of a combination of ocular aberrations and light scatter, as well as the effect 
of multiple imag es simultaneously superimposed onto the retina, as in the case of 
multifocal intraocular lenses  (IOLs ; Rosen 2005 ). 
These visual disturbances can be debilitating to a variety of everyday activities, especially 
driving. The ligh t emitted by traffic lights and other cars scatters and obscures most of the 
visual field, making driving in dim light conditions hazardous. Glare, in particular, can be 
dangerous while driving.  
Several surveys suggest that DLD  are a clinically relevant co ncern.  
• More than half (53%) of vision -corrected Americans admit they feel uncomfortable 
when driving in the dark ( Fejer and Girgis, 1992 ). 
• Up to 3% of patients with refractive procedures are unable to function visually at 
night  (Pop and Payette, 2004 ; Fan-Paul, 2002 ; Holladay, 1999 ; Monestam and 
Lundqvist, 2006 ). 
• As many as 20% of people with multifocal IOLs complain of night vision 
disturbances ( van Alphen, 1976 ). 
• In one study of 297 drivers given vision tests that correlate with accidents, 45% of 
the drivers who reported difficulty driving at night were unable to perform any of 
the tests with glare ( Puell, 2004 ).

CONFIDENTIAL  29  3/25/2021  The effects of DLD  can be mitigated by miosis, where the smaller pupil blocks the 
unfocused, peripheral aberrant rays of light, selectively allowing passage of the more 
centrally focused rays (Martinez, 1998 ). A miotic change in the pupil size can be achieved 
by modulating 1 of 2 or both opposing sets of muscles – the iris sphincter muscles 
controlled by the cholinergic nervous system and the iris dilator muscles controlled by the 
adrenergic nervous system  (Yoshitomi, 1985 ; Steinhauer, 2004 ). An alpha -1 antagonist 
approach will act on the iris dilator muscle and produce a miotic effect  (Yu, 2002 ). It is 
proposed that a moderate pharmacologic reduction of pupil size (20 –25%) by the 
applicati on of an alpha -1 antagonist has the potential to mitigate DLD  in many affected 
individuals.  
The biggest challenge for the treatment of DLD  is the lack of safe, tolerable, convenient, 
and effective treatments. Despite a large number of addressable patients with moderate -to-
severe DLD , there is no FDA -approved treatment on the market for DLD . Some 
commonly used tools such as tinted glasses are not effective, and in fact, may worsen 
patients’ vision at night. Off -label use of approved miotic agents, such as re gular -strength 
pilocarpine, are unsuitable for the treatment of DLD  because they reduce pupil size to a 
degree that may impede safe night vision and may cause loss of accommodation  
(Isopto  prescribing information ). 
Phentolam ine is a non -selective alpha -1 and alpha -2 adrenergic antagonist acting on 
adrenergic receptors and is known to inhibit contraction of the iris dilator muscle, resulting 
in a smaller pupil size.  
Previous Phase 2 clinical trials showed that 1.0% Phentolamine Mesylate Ophthalmic 
Solution  (0.75% Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution) significantly decreases PD and 
improve s mLCVA in DLD subjects after single - and multi -dose (14 days) treatment.  
Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution  was generally well -tolerated  in the eye ( the most 
common complaint was mild -to-moderate ocular hyperemia and eye irritation) and there 
were no clinically meaningful systemic effects as measured by HR and BP.  
2.4 Route of Administration, Dosage Regimen, and Treatment Period  
As the intende d route of administration for Nyxol  is topical ocular, this is the route to be 
used in this study.  
The dose for one drop of Nyxol selected for this study, 0.75%, was based upon : 1) 
preclinical safety studies , 2) the results of the previous ophthalmic clini cal studies  
described above  and in the IB, and 3) clinical studies conducted with varying doses of 
drugs in the same class  (Hogan, 1997 ). 
Treatment ( Nyxol or placebo) will be administered OU. Subjects will have one drop of 
treatment administered in each eye.  
Note that 0.75% Phentolamine Ophthalmic Solution, which expresses the phentolamine 
mesylate concentration in free base, is the new nomenclature being used in place of 1% 
Phentolamine Mesylate Ophthalmic Solution, which w as how Nyxol had been described 
in prior studies.

CONFIDENTIAL  37  3/25/2021  be protected  from light. All investigational study medication must be stored in a secure 
facility, with access limited to the Investigator and authorized staff.  
4.4.3 Study Medication  Administration  
Study medication  will be dispensed by the Investigator or designee  at the site on Visit 1 
(Screening/ Baseline ). 
The subject  will instill  one drop once daily ( QD) at or near bedtime  (8PM to 10PM) OU 
for 14 days (+ 1 day). The first dose of study medication will be taken at 8PM to 10PM on 
the evening of the Baseline Visit (Day 1). If the subject wears contact lenses, they must be 
removed prior to dosing and not replaced until the next morning at the earliest.  
4.4.4 Study Medication Accountability  
 Receipt and Disposition of Study Medication  
The Investigator or designee (e.g., study coordinator or pharmacist) shall  maintain a full 
accountability record for the study medication and will be responsible for recording the 
receipt, dispensing, and return of all supplies of the study drug using the inventories 
supplied by the Sponsor. Each subject will receive sufficient study medication for the 
duration of the trial. A study medication box will be dispensed at Visit 1 
(Screening/ Baseline ; Day 1). As described in Section 7.2.1 , the subject will empty any 
remaining contents from the unit -dose dropper bottle following each instillation . The 
subject should then empty the remaining contents and return the opened bottle to its foil 
pouch and place it in the medication box for return to the study site . All opened bottles as 
well as any unopened study medication will be returned at Visit  2 (Treatment; Day 8 ) and 
Visit 3 (Treatment; Day 15).  
At Visit  2, the box will be re-dispensed to the subject following study drug accountability 
and removal of opened study medication materials. Study medication accountability shall  
again be conducted at Visit  3, but the box will not be re -dispensed. The Investigator or 
designee  must  account for all received and returned study medication. The monitor will 
review dispensing and study medication accountability records during site visits and at the 
completion of the study and note any discrepancies.  
 Return of Study Medication  
When the study is completed or is terminated by Ocuphire, all study material s, including 
used and unused study medication bottles , must be returned to Ocuphire (or its designee) 
or destroyed under the direction of same. All study medication accounting procedures 
must be completed before the study is considered completed . A final study medication 
disposition will be completed by the study coordinator.

CONFIDENTIAL  38  3/25/2021  4.5 Expected Duration of Subject  Participation  
The total length of subject participation is approximately 3 weeks , with 3 clinic visits and 
one telephone call follow -up summarized below:  
• Visit 1 ( Screening /Baseline )/Day 1 
• Visit 2 ( Treatment )/Day 8 (±1 day)  
• Visit 3 ( Treatment )/Day 1 5 (±1 day)  
• Follow -up telephone call 1 to 3 days after Visit 3 
 
The execution of the entire study (first subject screen ed through last randomized subject 
completed) is expected to be approximately 9  to 12 months.  
4.6 Randomization and Procedure for Breaking the Code 
A randomization code for allocating subjects to treatment will be prepared by a masked 
biostatistician not  connected with the study.  Subjects will be stratified by iris color 
(light/dark irides ). 
At the initiation of study -related procedures, every subject  who is screened  is assigned a 
subject identification number  in numerical order  within site . Once a subject  is qualified 
for the study , the subject  is assigned a randomization number  in the order provided by the 
biostatistician.  
The study medications will be masked to Investigator s, study staff , study subject s, the 
clinical research organization (CRO ), and Ocuphire . Only in case of medical emergency or 
occurrence of SAE s will the randomization code be unmasked by the Medical Monitor  and 
made available to the Investigator, Ocuphire, and/or other personnel involved in the 
monitoring or conduct of this study.  
4.7 Collection of Data 
Study -specific data that ha ve been outlined in the protocol will be entered into the clinical 
database by indi vidual(s) designated by the Investigator. Data are verified electronically 
using a series of online programmed edit checks that have been created by the Clinical 
Data Manager and programmed by the Clinical Data Programmer or designee. Data 
discrepancies wi ll be brought to the attention of the clinical team and investigated by the 
study monitor  and site staff. Study monitors  will review and verify a  targeted subset of  
data collected in the electronic Case Report Form ( eCRF ) against  any applicable  source 
docu mentation during remote review or scheduled monitoring visits. The specific data 
selected for source data verification will be detailed in Clinical Monitoring Plan. The study 
monitor  will work closely with the site staff to address any discrepancies that have been 
found so that proper resolutions  can be made and documented in the clinical database. An 
audit trail within the system will track all changes made to the data.

CONFIDENTIAL  44  3/25/2021  6 TREATMENT OF SUBJECT S 
Approximately 160 DLD subjects  ≥18 years of age will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 1 
of 2 treatment arms  (Nyxol or placebo) , with the expectation that approximately 
136 subjects will be evaluable for efficacy . Randomization will be stratified  
. There will be no treatment administered on Visit 4 (follow -up phone 
call). 
6.1 Treatment Adherence  
All subjects must  be instructed on the importance of following the once -daily dosing 
regimen  and ma intaining their dosing diaries . Beginning the day of Visit 1 
(Screening/ Baseline ; Day 1) subjects will instill one drop of study medication in the 
evening  (at 8PM to 10PM ) at or near bedtime OU . Subjects will  repeat this instillation, 
using one bottle per day,  13 or 14 more times for a total of up to 15 doses over the course 
of the study . Subjects are to bring all opened bottles as well as a ny unopened study 
medication  into the study site at Visit  2 and Visit  3. Treatment adherence will be measured 
by counting the dropper bottles at the start of the study and those remaining at each study 
visit. Subjects will also bring their diary to Visit 2 and Visit 3 and d osing will be reviewed 
by study staff.  
6.2 Concomitant Medications  
As noted in the exclusion criteria ( Section 5.1), use of any topical prescription or OTC 
ophthalmic me dications of any kind within 7  days of screening, with the exception of lid 
scrubs with OTC products (e.g., OCuSOFT® lid scrub, SteriLid®, baby shampoo, etc.) , is 
prohibited . Many  drugs, both prescription and OTC, contain active ingredients that can 
affect PD. This would include many eye drops, such as Visine®, that would be used to 
reduce redness, most cough or cold preparations, antihistamines and bronchodilators, most 
nose drops , most BP medications, many drugs used for migraines, and many other 
products.  
Additionally, initiation of treatment with or any changes to the current dosage, drug , or 
regimen of any systemic adrenergic or cholinergic drugs (Appendix 4) within 7 days prior 
to screening, or during the study , is prohibited . However, a subject can be treated with a 
systemic adrenoceptor antagonist , for example,  as long as the particular agent and its dose 
and regimen had been consistent for the 7 days prior to screening, and there was no reason 
to believe that alteration would be necessary at some point later during the study.  
If there is any question about whether a medication is acceptable, the Medical Monitor  
should be consulted before proceedin g. 
Use of all medications shall  be documented on the appropriate eCRF. Investigators are 
encouraged to contact the Medical Monitor  for any questions regarding allowed 
medications. Judgment of continued study participation by the subject  and inclusion of this 
subject ’s subsequent visits in the safety and efficacy analysis will be made by Ocuphire.  
All medications taken by  the subject  within 30 days  prior to the Screening Visit and  during 
the study will be recorded in the eCRF. The name of the drug, dose, route of

For combination products (e.g., C ontac®, Cosopt®), the brand name is required. For 
non-combination products, the generic name is desired. The use of routine ophthalmic 
diagnostic pharmaceutical agents (e.g., fluorescein and local anesthetic) will be allowed 
and should be documented . Any c hange in dosing parameters should also be recorded in 
the eCRF.

CONFIDENTIAL  46  3/25/2021  7 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
7.1 Specification of the Efficacy Parameters  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the percent of subjects with ≥  15 ETDR S letters  
(≥ 3 lines ) of improvement in the study eye compared to baseline in monocular mLCVA at 
Day 8. 
 
 
 
 
 
The study  eye and non -study eye , as well as binocular,  will be evaluated at 
all appropriate assessments . Secondary efficacy endpoints can be found in Section 4.1. 
All of the efficacy endpoints will be analyzed overall , and by light/dark irides  at all 
timepoints . The mLCVA endpoints will be analyzed by baseline PD  
) and  subpoint.  
7.2 Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Efficacy Parameters  
VA, PD, and wavefront  error (total and higher order ) will be measured at Visit 1 
(Screen ing/Baseline ), Visit 2  (Treatment) , and Visit 3  (Treatment)  as described in 
Section  4.1. 
 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 to the set of  PD, BCDVA , DCNVA , and wavefront error  measurements ). 
Subject will sit in the exam chair facing directly at  the illuminated chart  during the 
acclimation period and for all a ssessments.  Room lights may be turned on for the 
scheduled remaining safety assessments (e.g. , conjunctival hyperemia, AEs, subject 
questionnaire, etc.). The subject will be in the same room for all assessments, and every 
effort will be made to have the sa me person perform the measurements at all visits . 
7.2.1 Visit 1 ( Screening /Baseline) /Day 1  
Individuals who are potential subjects are identified by the study center to schedule the 
Screening Visit. The Screening Visit should occur the same day as the Baseline Visit, 
where the dose of study treatment is given.  

Ocuphire Pharma, Inc.  Clinical Protocol  
OPI-NYXDLD -301 LYNX -1 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  47  3/25/2021  Once a subject  arrive s at the study center, a member of the study center staff will interview 
the individual as to their qualifications for partici pation in the study, and if the subject  
wishes to continue, the informed consent form  is signed,  and a subject identification  
number is assigned . 
If the subject wears soft contact lenses , they must be removed for at least 1 hour prior to 
ophthalm ic assessments . If the subject wears hard gas -permeable contact lenses, they m ust 
be removed for at least 8 hours prior to testing.  
The start of  screening includes an explanation of the study, a me dical and ophthalmic 
history, demographics, and a review of prior/concomitant medications . During this time, 
eligibility for  must  be determined  first. Then, ophthalmic and 
non-ophthalmic criteria ( ) shall be determined  and only 
eligible subjects will continue.  This shall  be followed by a urine pregnancy test for females 
of childbearing potential   and HR/BP (  
). 
Prior to further screenin g, the subject  must be asked to complete the subject questionnaire . 
Subjects should then have their refraction confirmed using the High contrast distance chart 
as detailed in the Study Procedures Manual. Following a

 OD shall be the study 
eye. Investigators should frequently remind subject s to blink between visual acuity 
assessments.  
The study eye of the subject must meet  in order for the 
subject to not screen fail.  
Before further screening criteria , the following assessments shall be performed  to establish 
baseline values : 
• mHCVA, pLCVA, and mesopic high -contrast DCNVA  
•  
 corneal topography 
measurements  under , and other data captured  
• Conjunctival hyperemia, assessed visually with a grading scale (0 –3) using images 
from the CCLRU  (Investigators are cautioned to appropriately note all observations 
of conjunctival hyperemia on the biomicroscopy eCRF at screening ) 
• Slit lamp biomicroscopy

CONFIDENTIAL  48  3/25/2021   
The subject must also meet dry eye Exclusion Criteri on #13 to be included in the study  at 
the determination of the investigator . Specifically, subjects with undiagnosed dry eye  may 
undergo a dry eye test (one of the below):  
a. TearLabs osmolarity test (> 308 mOsm/L in either eye or an inter -eye 
difference ≥ 10 mOsm/L)  
b. Corneal fluorescein staining (≥ grade 2 in the inferior or ≥ grade 1 in the central 
zone using the National Eye Institute scale)  
c. Tear break -up time of < 5 seconds  
 
Final screening must  includ e IOP measurement (using a Tono -Pen) and ophthalmoscopy . 
With the subject passing all eligibility criteria, the Screening Visit becomes the Baseline 
Visit. The subject will then be assigned a randomization number and randomized into the 
study.  
Through the screening process at Visit 1, al l assessments will have been completed as 
defined in Table  2. A summary of the screening process is outlined in Appendix 5.  
If the subject meets all eligibility criteria , they will be randomized to a treatment group. If 
a subject fails the screen, they can return for a rescreening  (signing a new informed 
consent and assigning  a new subject number) at  the investigator’s discretion.  
Site personnel  will then demonstrate  the proper  instillation  technique  to the subject . The 
subject  at home  should  be in a seated  position  and should  tilt his or her head  backward  for 
administration  of the study  medication.  The bottle  of study  medication  should  be held at an 
almost  vertical  position  above  the eye while  the lower  eyelid  is pulled  down  gently,  and 1 
drop is placed  into the conjunctival  cul-de-sac. The tip of the bottle  should  not touch  the 
eye. After  a drop is instilled  in each eye, the subject  should  keep  the eyes gently  closed  for 
approximately  30 seconds.  After  successful  instillation  of the drop in each eye, the subject  
should  carefully  empty  any remaining  contents  as directed.  
The subject  is given  their medication  dropper  bottles  in a kit and instructions  regarding 
when  to administer  the eye drop (8PM  to 10PM  QD), and when  to return  to the clinic.  All 
treatments will be administered OU. 
 
 
 
The first dose of study medication will be taken at 8PM to 10PM on the evening of the 
Baseline Visit (Day 1).  If the subject wears contact lenses, they must be removed prior to 
dosing and not replaced until the next morning at the earliest.  
Each  subsequent  evening  of dosing,  the subject  will administer  1 drop to each eye from  a 
single  new unit-dose bottle  and close  the eyes gently  for 30 seconds,  then empty  the

medication  box for return  to the study  site at Visit  2 (Day 8) . Each  subsequent  evening  of 
dosing (approximately  24 hours  between  doses),  the subject  will follow  the same  
procedures.  
The subject should be instructed to contact the Investigator should AEs of concern occur 
(e.g., shortness of breath, fainting, etc.). If the event is life -threatening , then the subject 
should go to the emergency room.  
7.2.2 Visit 2 (Treatment)/Day 8 (± 1 day) 
If the subject wears contact lenses,  prior 
to ophthalm ic assessments . At Visit  2, the medication box, complete with opened bottles 
and any unopened study medication, and diary will be returned to the study site where the 
site will account for opened and unopened study medication and the study medication box 
will be re -dispensed with the unopened medication.  
The subjects will be asked if they had any problems with their eyes since  the last visit, and 
if there have been any changes in their medical condition or concomitant medications 
since their last visit. Any adverse changes in the condition of the subject a re recorded as 
an AE. 
In addition, at Visit 2  subjects shall have the following  assessments , as defined in Table  2: 
•Females of childbearing potential must  take a urine pregnancy test .
•Subject  must  have  HR and BP assessments .
•Subject shall  be assessed using the subject questionnaire .
•Pupil diameter
•Subject shall  be assessed for mLCVA, mHCVA, pLCVA and DCNVA  (mesopic ,

any unused medications and diary with them for purposes of drug accountability. The last 
day of study treatment is the day before Visit 3; no further study medication will be 
dispensed at Visit 3.  
The sub jects will be asked if they had any problems with their eyes from the last visit, and 
if there have been any changes in their medical condition or concomitant medications 
since their last visit. Any adverse changes in the condition of the subject are recor ded as 
an AE. 
In addition, at Visit 3 subjects will have the following  assessments , as defined in Table  2: 
•Females of childbearing potential must take a  urine pregnancy test .
•Subject must  have HR and BP assessments .
•Subject shall  be assessed using the subject questionnaire .

Up to 3 days after Visit 3, subjects will be called and asked if they had any problems with 
their eyes from the last visit , including whether their eyes are red, and if there have been 
any changes in their medical condition or concomitant medications since their last visit. 
Any changes in the condition of the subject are recorded as an AE. 
If an AE/adverse reaction is unresolved at the time of the last visit or if a subject reports a 
worsening of symptoms, every effort should be made to follow up until the AE/adverse 
reaction is resolved or stabilized, the subject is lost to follow -up, or there is ot her

8.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
The assessment of safety and tolerability is the  secondary objective of this study. The 
assessment of safety will be evaluated by:  
• Conjunctival hyperemia  measured with CCLRU images  using a 4-point scale  (0-3) 
(Appendix 6). 
o None (0) = Normal ; appears white with a small number of con junctival 
blood vessel  easily observed  
o Mild (+1) = Prominent , pinkish -red color of both the bulbar and palpebral 
conjunctiva  
o Moderate (+2) = Bright, scarlet red color of the bulbar and palpebral 
conjunctiva  
o Severe (+3) = Bee fy red with petechiae, dark red bulbar and palpebral 
conjunctiva with evidence of subconjunctival  hemorrhage  
• Biomicroscopy of the anterior segment includes evaluation of cornea, conjunctiva , 
and anterior chamber. Fluorescein staining will be used.  
• IOP is m easured with the Tono -Pen. 
• Ophthalmoscopy  direct or indirect fundus exam without dilation includ es optic 
nerve, macula, vessels , and periphery  (note: Use of 90 D lens (indirect) is allowed ). 
• HR and BP are measured as per the site’s normal equipment and procedure s. 
• AEs 
• Brief subject  questionnaire  (Appendix 3) 
 
8.2 Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety Parameters  
The timing for recording safety parameters may be found in Table  2. 
8.3 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
All AEs and SAEs that occur following con sent and until the final study visit should be 
collected and recorded on the AE or SAE eCRF page . Only treatment -emergent adverse 
events/adverse reactions (TEAEs) will be summarized  (Section 9.3.5 ). 
All AEs/adverse reactions occurring during the study (i.e. , once the subject  has signed the 
informed consent /assent ) must be documented, regardless of the assumption of causal 
relationship, on the respective eCRF. All  TEAEs/adverse reactions must be documented 
from the time the subject  receives the study medication until the subject ’s participation in 
the study has been compl eted. If a subject  has ongoing AEs/adverse reactions at the time 
of study completion  or discontinuation from the study , the ongoing AEs/adverse reactions 
must  be followed -up and provided appropriate medical care until the signs and symptoms 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc.  Clinical Protocol  
OPI-NYXDLD -301 LYNX -1 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  53  3/25/2021  have remitted o r stabilized or until medical assessments  have returned to acceptable or 
pre-study limits.  
Documentation of AEs/adverse reactions includes start date and end date, severity, 
relationship to study medications , action(s) taken, seriousness , and outcome.  
8.3.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
The following definitions of terms apply to this section:  
Adverse event . An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a 
study medication  in humans, whether or not considered drug related . An AE  can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory findings), 
symptom, or disease temporari ly associated with the use of the study medication, whether 
or not related to the study medication. Study medication includes the i nvestigational drug 
under evaluation and the comparator product or vehicle placebo that is given or 
administered during any phase of the study.  
Medical conditions/diseases present before starting the investigational treatment are only 
considered AEs if they worsen after starting the investigational treatment. Abnormal test 
results constitute AEs only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered 
clinically significant, or require therapy.  
The occurrence of AEs should be sought by open -ende d questioning of the subject at each 
visit during the study. At each clinic assessment /visit, study personnel should ask the 
following question: “Have you had any problems since your last assessment /visit?”. AEs 
also may be detected when they are volunteer ed by the subject during or between visits or 
through study assessments.  
Life-threatening AE or life -threatening suspected adverse reaction . An AE or suspected 
adverse reaction is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the Investigator or 
Ocuphire , its occurrence places the subject  at immediate risk of death. It does not include 
an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death.  
SAE or serious suspected adverse reaction . An AE or suspected adverse reaction is 
considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the Investigator or Ocup hire, it results in any 
of the following outcomes:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  AE 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life function s 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc.  Clinical Protocol  
OPI-NYXDLD -301 LYNX -1 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  54  3/25/2021  • Other medically important serious event  
 
Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Treatment on an outpatient emergency basis that does not result in hospital admission, or a 
hospitalization  that is elective or is a preplanned treatment for a pre -existing condition  that 
is unrelated to the medication under study and has not worsened since the start of the 
study, is not considered an SAE.  
Suspected adverse reaction  means any AE for which there  is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the AE. For the purposes of Investigational New Drug ( IND) safety 
reporting, “reasonable possibility ” means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the AE. Suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of 
certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug.  
Unexpected adverse event or unexpected suspected adverse reaction . An AE or suspected 
adverse reaction is considered  “unexpected ” if it is not listed in the IB or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an IB is not required or available, is 
not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or 
elsewhere in the current application, as amended.  “Unexpected,” as used in this definition, 
also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the IB as occurring 
with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug but 
are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.  
The study medication relationship  for each AE/adverse reaction should be determined by 
the Investigator using these explanations:  
• Not related  
• Unlikely related  
• Possibly related  
• Probably related  
• Definitely related  
• Unknown  
 
Unless the relationship is consider ed to be “Not related” or “Unlikely related” and there is 
any valid reason, even if undetermined , for suspecting a possible cause -and-effect 
relationship between the study medication and the occurrence of the AE, then the AE 
should be considered “ related ”. 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc.  Clinical Protocol  
OPI-NYXDLD -301 LYNX -1 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  55  3/25/2021  If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined by 
Ocuphire  to be anything other than “Not related ” or “Unlikely related” the event will be 
considered to be related to the investigational product for the purposes of expedited 
regulatory reporting . 
Severity  of an AE is defined as a qualitative assessment of the level of discomfort of an 
AE as is determined by the Investigator or reported to him/her by the subject . The 
assessment of severity  is made irrespective of study medication relationship or seriousness 
of the event and should be evaluated according to the following scale:  
• 1 = Mild: present, but not distressing, and no dis ruption of normal daily activity  
• 2 = Moderate: discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity  
• 3 = Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform normal daily activity  
 
A change in severity for a reported AE will require a n end date for the previous severity 
and a new start and end date for the new severity. For example, a change in severity may 
go from mild to severe  or from severe to moderate. In either case , the start or  end 
times/ dates should be recorded.  
The term “severe” is used to describe the intensity of an event/reaction; the event/reaction 
itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache) . This is 
not the same as a “Serious” AE, which is based on a subject/event outco me or action 
criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to the subject’s life or vital 
functions. “Seriousness ” (NOT severity) serves as a guide f or defining regulatory reporting 
obligations.  
Action  taken in response to an AE is coded as:  
• Dose increased: An indication that a medication schedule was modified by 
addition; either by changing the frequency, strength , or amount.  
• Dose not changed: An indication that a medication schedule was maintained.  
• Dose reduced: An indication that a medicatio n schedule was modified by 
subtraction, either by changing the frequency, strength , or amount.  
• Dose interrupted: An indication that a medication schedule was modified by 
temporarily terminating a prescribed regimen of medication.  
• Drug withdrawn: An indicat ion that a medication schedule was modified through 
termination of a prescribed regimen of medication.  
• Not applicable: Determination of a value is not relevant in the current context  
• Unknown: Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused  
 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc.  Clinical Protocol  
OPI-NYXDLD -301 LYNX -1 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  56  3/25/2021  Additional other action taken:  
• Concomitant medication  
• Hospitalization  
 
Outcome  of an AE is coded as:  
• Fatal: The termination of life as a result of an AE 
• Not recovered/not resolved: One of the possible results of an AE outcome that 
indicates that the event has not improved or the subject recuperated  
• Recovered/resolved: One of the possible results of an AE outcome that indicates 
that the event has improved o r the subject has recuperated  
• Recovered/ resolved with sequelae:  One of the possible results of an AE outcome 
where the subject recuperated but retained pathological conditions resulting from 
the prior disease or injury  
• Recovering/resolving: One of the poss ible results of an AE outcome that indicates 
that the event is improving  
• Unknown: Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused  
 
In previous clinical studies of Nyxol , the most frequently reported AE was conjunctival 
hyperemia.  
In the present study,  any increase of 2 units in conjunctival hyperemia between 
consecutive visits is considered an AE.  
Investigators are cautioned to use the appropriate verbatim term on the AE form to 
describe this observatio n: 
• Redness related to instillation that is transient (i.e., is no longer present 2 hours 
after instillation) = “conjunctival erythema upon instillation”  
• Redness that is NOT transient (i.e., is present ≥ 2 hours after instillation) = 
“conjunctival hyperemia ” 
 
Expedited reporting of Serious and Unexpected Adverse  Events : All SAEs (related and 
unrelated) will be recorded following subject signature of the informed consent /assent  and 
until the Follow -up Visit . Any SAEs “suspected” to be related to the study medication  and 
discovered by the Investigator at any time after  the study should be reported.  
Any SAE that occurs must be reported to the CRO  within 24 hours of its occurrence or 
within 24 hours of learning of its occ urrence. Recurrent episodes, complications, or 
Ocuphire Pharma, Inc.  Clinical Protocol  
OPI-NYXDLD -301 LYNX -1 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  57  3/25/2021  progression of the initial SAE must be reported to the CRO  as follow -up to the original 
episode within 24 hours of the Investigator receiving the information.  Information about 
all SAEs will be collected and r ecorded on the SAE form. All pertinent medical records 
and information collected during the treatment and follow -up of the subject  should be 
maintained at the site with a copy emailed to   The 
Investigator must assess the SAE rela tionship and complete the SAE form. The CRO  may 
request additional information. Follow -up information ( e.g., discharge summary) will be 
retained in the subject ’s chart and a copy will be emailed  to 
 In addition, all SAEs should be recorded on the AE 
eCRF page with the serious question marked “Yes”.  
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to notify the approving IRB of any SAEs on a timely 
basis as instructed by Ocuphire  following Ocuphire ’s determinat ion of causality. All 
subjects  who experience an SAE should be followed clinically and undergo the appropriate 
diagnostic evaluations until stabilization or resolution of the event. Ocuphire  will report all 
SAEs to the FDA on the appropriate schedule depen ding if the event is drug related or not 
drug related, expected, unexpected (based on the available information in the I B). 
Any death occurring during the study and follow -up period must  be reported as an SAE. 
For any death occurring through the end of the  study, regardless of the degree of 
relationship to study medication , the SAE resulting in the death must be reported to the 
CRO . A death occurring after completion of the study , including the Safety Follow -up 
Visit s, that is not reasonably associated with study medication administration does not 
require completion of the SAE form.  
8.3.2 Follow -Up of Subjects  After Adverse Events  
If an AE/adverse reaction occurs, the Investigator will institute support and/or treatment as 
deemed appropriate. All SAEs  ongoing  at the time of the last visit or discontinuation from 
the study will be followed up  until the AE/adverse reaction is resolved or stab ilized, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or there is other resolution to the event.

9.1 Sample Size 
A sample size of approximately 136 subjects (68 per treatment group)  that are evaluable 
for efficacy  (i.e. who have a Day 8 mLCVA measurement ) is needed for the study.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All subjects will be randomized into the study in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of the  2 treatment  arms  
(Nyxol or placebo),  
It is assumed that there will be a pproximately  15% drop -out. To account for this drop -out, 
a total of approximately 160 subjects will be randomized into the study.  
9.2 Analysis Populations  
Modified Intention -to-Treat : The mITT  will include all randomized subject s who 
received at least 1 dose of study medication . The mITT  will be used for the primary 
endpoint analysis and to analyze efficacy endpoints.  
Per Protocol Population:  The PP population include s all subjects in the mITT  who 
received at least  5 doses of study medication  during the first 7 days of dosing  including the 
day prior to Day 8 , have a Baseline and a Day 8 mLCVA measurement , and have no major 
protocol deviations . The PP population will be used to analyze  efficacy endpoints . 
All Randomized Population (AR P): The AR P will include all randomized subject s. This 
population is also known as the intent ion-to-treat (ITT) population . The AR P will be used 
in confirmatory efficacy analyses . 
Safety Population  (SP): The SP will include all randomized  subject s who have received 
at least 1 dose of study medication . The SP will be used to summarize safety variables.  
9.3 Statistical Methods  
9.3.1 General Considerations  
All continuous variables will  be summarized by treatment and timepoint (as applicable) 
using descriptive statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and 
maximum). All categorical variables will  be summarized by treatment and tim epoint (as 
applicable) using frequency counts and percentages.  
All study data will be listed by treatment, subject  and timepoint (as applicable).

OPI-NYXDLD -301 LYNX -1 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  59  3/25/2021  All statistical tests will be performed using a  significance level of 5% (two -tailed). The 
p-values for the an alysis of secondary efficacy endpoints will be considered descriptive.  
9.3.2 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographic and baseline characteristics such as age, race, and sex will be summarized 
by treatment group using the mITT , PP population , ARP , and the SP. These data will also 
be provided in by -subject  listings . 
9.3.3 Subject  Disposition  
Subject  disposition, including randomization, and completion  and withdrawal from the 
study will be summarized using the AR P. These data will also be provided in by -subject  
listings . 
9.3.4 Medical History and  Prior/Concomitant Medications  
Medical history will be coded using the latest version of Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA)  and will be summarized by treatment group using the 
SP. 
Prior medications (medications with an end date prior to the date of randomization) and 
concomitant medications (medications with a start or end date after the date of 
randomization) will be coded using World Health Organization  Drug  Dictionary and will 
both be summarized by treatment group using the SP. 
Medical history  and prior and concomitant medications wil l also be provided in by-subject  
listings . 
9.3.5 Analysis of Efficacy  
Efficacy will be assessed using the mITT  and PP  populatio n with subject s included in the 
treatment arm in which they were randomized . For the analysis of the primary efficacy 
endpoint, appropriate imputation techniques will be performed for missin g observations if 
applicable; details will be provided in the study Statistical Analysis Plan.  If the analysis 
using the PP population shows a positive  effect for Nyxol at the 0.05 level of significance, 
the primary endpoint will be considered met.  Confirmatory analyses may be performed 
using the AR P, with imputation performed for missing data. For the analysis of the 
secondary efficacy endpoints, only observed case data will be used. If warranted, 
confirmatory analyses using the AR P with imputation for missing data will also be 
performed for the secondary efficacy endpoints.  
For all efficacy endpoints, Baseline values are defined  as the screening assessment values  
on Visit 1  (Day 1) .

Secondary efficacy endpoints are indicated in Section 4.1. 
Each of the continuous secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA)  with change from baseline as the dependent variable, t reatment , 
, and the respective baseline value included as the covariate. 
Each ANCOVA will be performed using the mITT  and PP population , with subjects 
included in their randomized treatment regardless of the treatment they a ctually received. 
The output from each ANCOVA will include the least squares mean ( LSM ) and standard 
error  for both treatment groups, along with the placebo -corrected LSM, its 95% CI and 
associated p -value.  
For each of the secondary endpoints related to percent of subjects achieving certain 
criteria, the analysis will be performed using a logistic regression model with treatment, 
light/dark irides,  and the respective baseline as a covariate. For each analysis , the 
percentage of subjects in each treatment group meeting the criteria, the OR with 95% CI 
and p -value will be provided. For these endpoints, the mITT  and PP  population will be 
used with subjects included in their randomized treatment regardless of the treatment they 
actually received.  
In addition, each secondary efficacy endpoint will be analyzed  using 
the same model and sensitivity analysis indicated above , as appropriate . Other subgroups , 
such as age, sex, and race, may be analyze d as well.  
9.3.6 Analysis of Safety  
Safety will be assessed using the SP with subject s included in the treatment group they 
actually received, regardless of their randomized treatment. Observed case data will be 
used; no imputation will be performed for missing safety data.  A statistical analysis of 
conjunctival hyperemia will be conducted as described below; otherwise, no statistical 
analysis of safety data will be performed . 
For HR and BP, baseline  value  is defined as the screening  value. HR and BP values  and 
change from baseline in the values  will be summarized by treatment group and timepoint  
(Day 1, Day 8 , and Day 15 ). 
Observed values and change from baseline (Day 1 ) in conjunctival hyperemia at each visit 
(Day 8 and Day 15 ), will  be summarized for the study eye , the non -study eye , and the best 
of either eye . Treatments will be compared using the same ANCOVA model proposed for 
the continuous secondary efficacy endpoints.  
For IOP, baseline is defined as the baseline value  of Visit  1 (Day 1) . Observed values and 
change from baseline in IOP at Day 8  and Day 15  will be summarized for the study eye , 
the non -study eye , and the best of either eye .

CONFIDENTIAL  61  3/25/2021  Subject  questionnaire values will be summarized by treatment group and timepoint ( Day 1 , 
Day 8, and Day 15 ). 
Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be coded using  MedDRA.  Only TEAEs  (those  that 
occur after the first dose of study medication or increasing in severity after initiation of 
study medication ) will be summarized . TEAEs and SAEs will be summarized  by treatment 
group, by system organ class (SOC) , severity, and relationship to study medication. 
Deaths, withdrawal from study medication due to AEs, and withdrawal from the study due 
to AEs will each by summarized by treatment group. Note that in MedDRA, ocular events 
are coded to the SOC of “special senses” . Thus, using SOC in the summaries will provide 
a separation of ocular and non -ocular AEs. 
All safety data will be provided in by -subject  listings.  
9.4 Procedure for Accounting for Missing, Unuse d, or Spurious Data 
For the summarization and analysis of efficacy data, the focus will be on observed case 
data only. As appropriate, confirmatory efficacy analyses will be performed using 
imputation for missing data; details of the imputation , if perform ed, will be included in the 
study Statistical Analysis Plan. For the summarization of safety data, observed case data 
only will be used . 
9.5 Procedure for Reporting Deviations From the Statistical Plan 
Any deviations from the statistical plan will be described  and a justification given in the 
final Clinical Study Report.

informed consent, monitoring of the conduct of the study and the completeness of the 
eCRFs  by Ocuphire or its designee(s), and appropriate record retention by the Investigator.  
12.2 Institutional Review Board  
This protocol, materials used to recruit subject s, and materials used to document 
consent /assent  must be approved by the IRB prior to initiation of the study. Written IRB 
approval must adequately identify the protocol and informed consent /assent . In addition to 
approving the protocol, the IRB must also approve the Subject  Information and 
Consent /Asse nt/Parental Consent  Form, as well as any advertising tools that will be used 
for the study. Copies of all approved materials, all correspondence with the IRB and 
written approval from the IRB must be made available to Ocuphire, prior  to the start of 
subjec t enrollment into the study.  
12.3 Protocol Deviations/Violations  
The Investigator should not deviate from the requirements of this protocol without prior 
written approval of the Medical Monitor or Sponsor except in the event of a medical 
emergency.  
A reportable  protocol deviation is defined as nonadherence to the protocol that involves 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, affects subject safety, rights or welfare, or has the potential to 
affect the integrity of the data. Examples of major protocol deviations  include study 
enrollment  by ineligible subject , loss of key data such as equipment  malfunction  (e.g., 
pupillometer), and/or use  of a prohibited medication during the study . 
All protocol deviations will be reported by entering the event in the appropriate eCRF 
page. Protocol deviations should be reported to the IRB in accordance with IRB -specific 
guidelines. If there is any question as to whether the deviation is reportable, Ocuphire or 
designee and the IRB should be contacted.  
All changes to the protocol will b e made by the Sponsor or designee as an approved 
amendment to the protocol, submitted to the FDA, and approved by the IRB prior to 
implementation.  
Changes implemented without prior approval will be considered protocol violations.  
12.4 Informed Consent  and Assent Requirements  
Written informed consent will be obtained from each adult subject . A copy of the signed 
and dated consent /assent  document will be given to each subject  or parent guardian . The

The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that no subject  is subject to any study -related 
examination or activity before that subject  has given informed consent /assent . The subject  
must give wr itten consent /assent  after the receipt of detailed information. The verbal 
explanation will cover all the elements specified in the written information provided for 
the subject . 
It should be emphasized that the subject  is at liberty to withdraw consent /assent  to 
participate at any time, without penalty or loss of benefits to which the subject  is otherwise 
entitled. Subject s who refuse to give, or withdraw, written informed consent /assent  may 
not be included or continued in this study, but this will not impact their subsequent care.  
The Investigator will inform the subject  of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits , and 
potential hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may entail.  The subject  must be 
given every opportunity to clarify any points  he/she does not understand and , if necessary, 
ask for more information. At the end of the interview, the subject  may be given time to 
reflect if this is required, or if the subject  requests more time.  Subject s and/or legal 
guardian will be required to sig n and date the informed consent form.  
A copy of the signed and dated consent /assent  document will be given to each subject . The

All procedures for the handling and analysis of data will be conducted using good 
computing practices meeting ICH and US FDA gui delines for the handling and analysis of 
data for clinical trials.  
13.1 Data Entry 
Study -specific data that ha ve been outlined in the protocol will be entered into the clinical 
database by individual(s) designated by the Investigator.  
13.2 Data Quality Control and Reporting  
Data are verified electronically using a series of programmed edit checks that have been 
created by the Clinical Data Manager and programmed by the Clinical Data Programmer 
or designee. Data discrepancies will be brought to the attenti on of the clinical team and 
investigated by the clinical research associate ( CRA ) and site staff. CRAs will review and 
verify a  targeted subset of  data collected in the eCRF against source documentation during 
remote review or scheduled monitoring visits. The specific data selected for source data 
verification will be detailed in Clinical Monitoring Plan. The CRA will work closely with 
the site staff to address any discrepancies that have been found so that proper resolutions 
can be made and documented in t he clinical database. An audit trail within the system will 
track all changes made to the data.  
13.3 Archiving of Data 
Archived versions of the database will be saved by Ocuphire consistent with ICH GCP 
guidelines, complying with whichever of the requirements i s longer. Ocuphire will notify 
the Investigator when documents should be returned.  
13.4 Records Retention  
The Investigator’s site and clinical laboratory will retain all records related to the study in 
compliance with ICH GCP  guidelines.  
13.5 Amendments to the Protocol 
Modifications of the signed protocol are only possible by approved protocol amendments 
and with the agreement of all responsible persons. The procedure for approval of a 
protocol amendment is identical to that for approval of the protocol. The IRB must  be 
informed of all protocol amendments and should be asked for its opinion as to whether a 
full re -evaluation of the ethical aspects of the study is necessary by the committee. This 
should be fully documented.  
The Investigator must not implement any devia tion from or change to the protocol, without 
discussion with and agreement by Ocuphire and prior review and documented 
approval/favorable opinion of the amendment from the relevant ethics committee, except 
where it is necessary to eliminate an immediate ha zard to study subject s, or where the 
change(s) involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the study (e.g., change in 
monitor, change of telephone number ).

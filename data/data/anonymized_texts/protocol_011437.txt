PRÉCIS  
Background:  
• Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most comm on malignancy with a 
median survival of 6 -9 months. The SHARP study established sorafenib  as a standard 
consideration in this disease and set the bar for future studies of systemic therapy.  
• TRC105 is a chimeric anti -angiogenic monoclonal antibody that bin ds CD105, a 
transmembrane receptor selectively expressed by proliferating endothelial cells. TRC105 
binds to CD105- expressing endothelial cells and mediates growth inhibition, apoptosis 
and antibody -dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC).  
Objectives:  
Primary:  
• Phase I: To  establish the maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) of TRC105 when given with 
standard -dose sorafenib for HCC.  
• Phase II: To determine the estimate response rate according to RECIST criteria for the 
combination of TR C105 with sorafenib in HCC.  
Eligibility:  
•  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of HCC.   
• Childs -Pugh A or B (7 points) cirrhosis is allowed.  
• Patients must have disease that is not amenable to potentially curative resection , 
radiofrequency ablation, or liver transplantation . 
• In phase I, p rior systemic therapy is  allowed .   
• In phase II, prior systemic therapy for HCC (including sorafenib) is allowed.  
• No history of bleeding varices  in previous 1 year (unless subsequent liver transplant) . 
• No anti -coagulation  (except low -dose aspirin).  
Design : 
• TRC105 will be administered intravenously every two week s, on days 1  and 15 of each 
28 day cycle.   Sorafenib will be self -administered twice daily by mouth.  
• Phase 1: The first part of this study was a standard 3+3 dose escalation phase I study 
with the primary objective of establishing MTD for TRC105 when given in  combination  
with standard -dose sorafenib . Sorafenib  is taken orally at a dose of 400  mg twice daily. 
TRC105 is administe red as an intravenous infusion every two week s.  Patien ts will be re -
staged including imaging studies to assess for response and progression every 8 weeks.  
The TRC105 dose  was escalated in cohorts  of 3 to 6 patients  up to a maximum of 15 
mg/kg every two weeks (see table below ).  Intra-patient dose escalation was not allowed.  
• Phase II: TRC105 will be administered as a n intravenous infusion every two weeks  at 
the recommended phase II dose, 15 mg/kg of TRC105 ever two weeks in combination 
with standard dose sorafenib,  defined in phase I.  The sample size and inter im stopping 
rule will be determined using a Simon optimal two -stage design.

Amendment:  N 
The first stage will initially enroll 6 evaluable patients, and if 0 of the 6 have a clinical 
response, then no further patients will be accrued. If 1 or more of the first 6 patie nts ha s a 
clinical response, then accrual would continue until a total of 23 patients have been 
enrolled. As it may take several weeks to determine if a patient has experienced a 
response, a temporary pause in the accrual may be necessary to ensure that en rollment to 
the second stage is warranted. If there are 1 to 2 clinical responses in 23 patients, this 
would be an uninterestingly low response rate. If there were 3 or more  complete  
responses in 23 patients ( 13.0%), this would be sufficiently interesting to warrant further 
study in later trials. Under the null hypothesis ( 5% response rate), the probability of early 
termination is 73.5%.

1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.1.1 Primary Objective(s):  
1.1.1.1  Phas e I: To establish the MTD for TR C105 when given with sorafenib  in HCC.  
1.1.1.2  Phase II: To determine the estimateresponse rate according  to RECIST criteria  for the 
combination of TR C105 with sorafenib  in HCC.  
1.1.2 Secondary Objective(s):  
1.1.2.1  To evaluate the safety of the combination of TR C105 and sorafenib  in HCC.  
1.1.2.2  To evaluate the immunogenicity of TRC105 as measured by human antichimeric 
antibody (HACA) and human antimouse antibody formation.   
1.1.2.3  To evaluate overall  response  rate (ORR)  as determined by both standard and EASL -
modified RECIST criteria.  
1.1.2.4  To determine progression -free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) for TRC105 and 
sorafenib  in HCC.  
1.1.2.5  To perform correlative studies assessing 1) potential biomarkers of response to 
angiogenic therapy , 2) changes in frequency an d function of immune cells upon 
treatment and 3 ) molecular characterization of tumors.  
1.2 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE : 
1.2.1 Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): Current standard of care.  
Worldwide, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common malignancy with a 
median survival of 6 -9 months1, 2.  There is a marked geographic heterogeneity with regard to the 
etiology of this disease and this complicates the design and interpretation of clinical trials.  In 
addition, for the  majority of patients with HCC , the presence of underlying cirrhosis is an 
additional non -cancer factor that is prognosis -determining and must be taken into account.  The 
approach to treating HCC has traditionally comprised of locoregional strategies: surg ery (partial 
resection or transplantation) or interventional radiologic procedures, such as chemoembolization or ablative techniques.  These approaches still have primacy and the surgical and ablative 
techniques remain the only real possibility of cure.  However , the publication of the landmark 
SHARP study established sorafenib  as a standard consideration in this disease and set the bar for 
future studies of systemic therapy
3. 
1.2.1.1  Cytotoxic chemotherapy.  
A clearcut survival benefit for chemotherapy compared to best supportive care has never been satisfactorily established in HCC.  Doxorubicin became the most widely studied 
chemotherapeutic agent based on older flawed studies that suggested good single- agent activity. 
A mo re reliable indicator of its efficacy was demonstrated in a phase III study comparing

doxorubicin to nolatrexed, a thymidylate synthetase inhibitor4.  Median overall survival was 
better for the doxorubicin arm (32.3 v 22.3 weeks; P = .0068)  with a response rate of 4% (v 1.4% 
in the nolatrexed which was considered inactive).  Doxorubicin was then used to form the 
backbone of the so -called PIAF regimen, in combination with cisplatin, interferon and 
fluorouracil.  This regimen appeared to be active based on a single- arm phase II study 
demonstrating a partial response rate of 26% and a median survival of 8.9 months5.  What was 
particularly striking in that study was that of the 9 patients who were able to undergo resection 
after achieving a response, no viable tumor cells were found in 4 of the resected specimens.  A 
phase III study was performed to compare the PIAF regimen with the de facto standard, single-
agent doxorubicin6.  Although there was a trend towards improved response rate (20.9% v 
10.5%) and median survival (8.7 v 6.8 months) in the PIAF group, these were not statistically significant (P=.83).   In addition the PIAF regimen had a significant increase in serious toxicity. 
One interpretation of the role of the PIAF regimen is for its very select use in patients of good performance status and hepatic function in whom cytoreduction is being attempted prior to potential resection
7.  There has been a paucity of phase III studies evaluating other chemotherapy 
combinations.  Single -arm phase II studies have evaluated gemcitabine -based combinations, 
standard in pancreatico -biliary cancers, suggesting modest activity only.   For example a small 
phase II study (N=34) of gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin revealed a response rate of 
18% and a median survival of 11.5 months (95% CI: 8.5- 14.3 months)8.  There is a consensus in 
the field that chemotherapy combinations by themselves are unlikely to resul t in significant 
progress.  
1.2.1.2  The SHARP and Asian- Pacific studies  
The first systemic medical therapy to demonstrate a prolongation of survival in hepatocellular 
carcinoma was sorafenib  - an oral multi -kinase inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF) receptor, the platelet -derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, and Raf3.  A landmark 
phase III randomized, placebo -controlled study demonstrated – after closure of the study at the 
second pre- specified interim an alysis – a median overall survival benefit in favor of the sorafenib 
arm (10.7 months v 7.9 months; HR 0.69; 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.87; P<0.001) and has resulted in the 
adoption of sorafenib  monotherapy as the standard of care for patients with HCC who are not 
eligible for, or have had disease progression after, surgical or locoregional therapies.  Of note , in 
this study was the inclusion of ‘symptomatic progression’ (measured by a questionnaire) as a co -
primary endpoint.  Also of note was the fact that 95 -98% o f patients had Child- Pugh class A 
cirrhosis.  A second major study confirming the role of sorafenib  – albeit with ostensibly less 
impressive results – was a study conducted in Asia in predominantly Hepatitis B patients9.  In 
that study overall survival was 6.5 months versus 4.2 months in favor of the sorafenib  arm 
(P=0.014). 
1.2.1.3  Augmenting sorafenib  by combining with chemotherapy.  
Abou -alfa, et al. conducted a randomized placebo -controlled phase II study (N=96) evaluatin g 
sorafenib  in combination with the prior (de facto) standard, doxorubicin10.  Median OS was 13.7 
months versus 6.5 months in favor of the sorafenib -containing arm, thus providing further 
evidence in favor of sorafenib , although unable to define what additional benefit, if any, was due 
to the contribution of doxorubicin.  Shen and  colleagues performed a phase II study combining 
metronomic UFT/tegafur chemotherapy with sorafenib  in a predominantly BCLC stage C

(advanced stage) population demonstrating a 6% partial response rate, median progression- free 
survival of 3.7 months (95% C. I., 1.9 - 5.5) and overall survival of 7.4 months (95% C.I., 3.4 - 
11.4)11.  Similarly Petrini and colleagues performed a study of continuous infusional 5- FU at 200 
mg/m2/day for 14 days of a 21 day cycle demonstrating a median TTP of 7.6 months (CI 
95%=5.3–9.9) and median overall survival of 12.2 months (CI 95%=4.45–19.8)12.  Other 
chemotherapy combinations of sorafenib  currently being evaluated consist of capecitabine with 
oxaliplatin (XELOX)  and gemcitabine with cisplatin (clinicaltrials.gov).  
1.2.1.4  Augmenting the anti -angiogenic effects of sorafenib . 
The difficulty in combining anti -angiogenic agents was demonstrated in a phase I study of 
sorafenib  and bevacizumab in which overlapping toxicity res ulted in an inability to dose -
escalate, albeit with some evidence of clinical benefit13.  As a result of this and a possible plateau 
effect with anti -VEGF therapy14, interest has focused on overcoming the escape mechanisms 
employed by tumors rather than merely trying t o saturate with anti -VEGF stategies.  For 
example , fibroblast growth factor (FGF) levels have been shown to increase after anti -VEGF 
therapy and to modulate resistance to VEGF inhibition15.  Brivanib is a dual inhibitor of VEGF 
and FGF receptors which is currently being compared to sorafenib  in a phase III study16.  An 
earlier phase II study demonstrated single -agent activity  for brivanib  in both sorafenib -naïve and 
pretreated patients with HCC17.  Perhaps the most important escape mechanism employed by 
tumors in response to antiangiogenic therapy is hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) -1α, which plays a 
central role in tumor progression, acting as a master regulator of how cancer cells adapt to 
hypoxic conditions.  HIF-1α therefore represents an attractive target in oncology, particularly in 
concert with anti -angiogenic strategies18.  In preclinical models, anti-VEGF therapy with 
bevacizumab has  been shown to cause an increase in intratumor -hypoxia – without the induction 
of apoptosis – and to result in a significant increase of HIF -1α-dependent gene expression19. 
Numerous strategies of targeting HIF -1α, including antisense oligonucleotides and use of 
topoisomerase -1 poisons (which appear to inhibit the translation of  HIF-1α) are currently in the 
clinic20. 
1.2.2 CD105  
CD105 (endoglin) is a 180 kDa homodimeric transmembrane receptor overexpressed by 
proliferating endothelial cells21.  It appears that CD105 is specific to endothelial cells that are 
proliferating, as anti -CD105 monoclonal antibody reacts with activated endothelial cells in 
tumors but weakly or not at all in the endothelium of normal, stable vasculature21.  The CD105 
pathway is essential for angiogenesis during fetal development and cell -surface expression of 
this molecule is required for the formation of new blood vessels22.  This is evidenced by CD105 
null mice that die in utero as a result of impaired angiogenesis in the yolk sac22. 
CD105 acts as an accessory protein that interacts with the signaling receptor complex of the TGF - ß superfamily, thus modul ating the effects of TGF - ß
23.  CD105 expression protects 
endothelial cells from the growth -inhibitory effects of TGF -β signaling24.  When engaged by the 
TGF - ß/T GF-ßRII complex, CD105 preferentially activates Alk -1 which in turn phosphorylates 
Smad proteins 1, 5 and 8.  This ultimately leads to stimulatory effects on endothelial c ell 
proliferation, migration and transcription of pro -angiogenic genes . CD105 expression is induced 
by hypoxia through HIF -1α and protects hypoxic endot helial cells from apoptosis25.

Amendment:  N 
Additionally, CD105 regulates co mponents of the extracellular matrix to facilitate endothelial 
cell migration and promote formation of neo -vessels26. 
Anti-VEGF therapy up -regulates CD105 expression, indicating that a therapeutic strategy which 
targets CD105 may complement VEGF -inhibition27.  
Mutations in CD105 or its downstream signaling mediator lead s to haplotype insufficiency 
causing a well- described syndrome known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia type 1 
(HHT -1 or Osler -Weber -Rendu Syndrome).  HHT -1 is a rare autosomal dominant genetic 
disorder characterized by vascular dysplasias, frequent episodes of epistaxis, mucocutaneous 
telangiectasias and arteriovenous malformations of the lung, brain, liver and gastrointestinal 
tract.  The genotype is manifested in utero, but the phenotype does not become apparent for 
many years following birth.  Affected patients most commonly present with epistaxis in the 
second decade of life.  The phenotype of this diso rder is limited to vascular effects, indicating the 
specific role of CD105 in the vasculature.  Most patients affected with HHT -1 experience 
epistaxis by the age of 10 to 20 years, while telangiectasias of the skin and mucosa first appear 
by the age of 20 to 40 years.  Visceral arteriovenous malf ormations are less common seque lae 
but may result in significant morbidity, including pulmonary shunting and intracranial hemorrhage.  
1.2.2.1  CD105 in HCC  
The specificity of CD105 expression in HCC tumor tissue was studied  by Yang , et al. who 
analyzed CD105 expression levels in para -carcinomatous and tumor tissue in 113 HCC resected 
specimens.  In addition, in 14 of these cases areas of distinct normal liver tissue were also 
resected.  It was found that CD105 was expressed in 100% of the HCC levels but 0% of either 
the normal or para -carcinomatous tissue
21.  This was in contrast with the pan -endothelial anti -
CD34 staining which - in addition to being present in 100% of tumor tissue – was also present in 
94% and 87% of para -carcinomatous and normal liver tissue respectively.  
Preclinical data in support of the concept:  
CD105 and HCC: Studies performed in different laboratories using various antibodies to CD105 
(endoglin) have revealed e xpression and upregulation in a wide range of tumor endothelia, but 
seldom found in the endothelia of normal tissues, suggesting that CD105 is highly related to tumor angiogenesis
28.  CD105 expression is an importan t prognostic factor in solid tumor 
patients including HCC21.  In two mouse models of hepatoma - formed from Hepal -6 and H22 
cell lines - tumor growth suppression, inhibition of angiogenesis, increased survival and t umor

1.2.3 TRC105  
All data cited in this section (unless otherwise noted) has been obtained from Tracon 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc and is found in the Tracon Pharma Investigator’s Brochure, Project 
TRC105 Oncology, version 2.0: May 11, 2009. Edition 2.0.  
TRC105 is a human/murine chimeric  anti-CD105 IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody consisting of 
human Cκ and Cγ1 constant regions with murine Vκ and V H regions.  TRC105 is composed of 
two light chains of 213 amino acids and two heavy chains of 448 amino acids and has an approximate molecular we ight of 148 kDa.  This monoclonal antibody binds with high avidity to 
human CD105 (endoglin), thus inhibiting angiogenesis and tumor growth . 
1.2.3.1    Nonclinical Pharmacology, Efficacy and Toxicology  
Pharmacology studies include in vitro and in vivo studies perf ormed with the murine parent 
antibody (SN6j) and TRC105.  These antibodies share identical variable regions.  SN6j, the 
murine parent monoclonal antibody of TRC105, was generated by immunizing mice with an 
isolated CD105 preparatio n from human leukemia cel ls. 
Pharmacology studies were conducted in murine and human models.  Collectively, the studies 
demonstrate that TRC105 (or SN6j) binds with higher avidity to human than murine endothelial 
cells, and reacts more strongly with proliferating than quiescent en dothelial cells.  Studies also 
indicate that these anti -CD105 antibodies are able to mediate TGF -β dependent growth 
inhibition, induce apoptosis of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), mediate 
antibody dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) of HUVECs, satur ate CD105 binding at 
concentrations ≥ 250 n g/mL, and inhibit the growth of human tumor xenografts.  
TRC105 binds to purified human CD105 with high avidity by surface Plasmon resonance assay 
(5 - 35 pM).  As expected, binding studies indicate that both SN6j and TRC105 bind with nearly 
identical avidity to human endothelial cells that express CD105 as determined by Scatchard analysis . 
In Vitro Pharmacology of SN6j  
Using Scatchard plot analyses performed by incubating fixed combinations of radiolabeled and 
native antibody with KM -3 cells, the avidity of SN6j was calculated by regression analysis to be 
2.85 x 10
9 liter/mole (or 3.51 x 10-10 mole/liter) . 
TGF -β Dependent Growth Inhibition of HUVECs 
SN6j was studied for its ability to inhibit the growth of HUVECs in vitro in the presence of TGF - 
β.  HUVEC cells were cultured at 37 °C overnight prior to the addition of SN6j and TGF -β. Cells 
were then exposed to antibody or TGF -β for 72 hours, during which time the media containing 
antibody and/or growth factors was replaced every 24 hours.  Cell growth was then quantified by 
assaying tritiated thymidine incorporation for 20 hours.  The concentration of SN6j ne eded to 
inhibit HUVEC growth by 50% was 90 μg/mL  in the absence of TGF -β.  However, the 
13 
Abbreviated Title:  Sorafenib and TRC105 in HCC  
NCI Protocol #:  11-C-0102  
Version Date:  June 10, 2016  
Amendment:  N 
concentration of SN6j needed to inhibit HUVEC growth by 50% was much lower when cells 
were incubated with antibody in the presence of TGF -β.  These data indicate that anti -endoglin 
antibody potently inhibits HUVEC growth in the presence of TGF -β.  At physiologic 
concentrations of TGF -β (>100 pg/mL), the amount of SN6j needed to inhibit HUVEC cell 
growth was <10 μg/mL. 
Induction of Apoptosis of Proliferating HUVECs  
SN6j w as studied for its ability to induce apoptosis of proliferating HUVECs in vitro .  HUVEC 
cells were seeded and then incubated at 37 °C with SN6j (50 or 100 μg/mL) or 100 μg of MOPC, 
an IgG1 -kappa isotype -matched control antibody.  Following incubation, cells were washed and 
then lysed.  The cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were separated by centrifugation and 
nucleosomes contained in the cytoplasmic fraction were then detected via their histone 
components. Apoptosis was determined by assaying the fragmented nucleosome content of 
cytoplasmic fractions using a commercial ELISA (Roche Diagnostics).   The degree of apoptosis 
induced by SN6j on proliferating HUVECs from multiple donors was 9 .1% at 50 μg/mL and 
25.6% at 100 μg/mL concentrations, relative to the value induced by camptothecin.  Apoptosis of 
SN6j (100 μg/mL) treated HUVECs was 4.58 times as large as that of MOPC control IgG (100 μg/mL) treated HUVECs, while apoptosis of SN6j (50 μg/mL) treated HUVECs was 2.28 times 
as large as that of MOPC control IgG (100 μg/mL) treated HUVECs.  
In a separate experiment using HUVECs from a single donor, the degree of apoptosis induced by 
SN6j was 31.5% at 50 μg/mL and 43.7% at 100 μg/mL concentrat ions, relative to the value 
induced by camptothecin.  Apoptosis of SN6j (100 μg/mL) treated HUVECs was 2.53 times as 
large as that of MOPC control IgG (100 μg/mL) treated HUVECs, while apoptosis of SN6j (50 
μg/mL) treated HUVECs was 2.10 times as large as that of MOPC control IgG (100 μg/mL) 
treated HUVECs.  Overall, SN6j induced significant levels of apoptosis (although lower than 
those induced by camptothecin) on HUVECs at concentrations of ≥ 50 μg/mL. 
In Vitro Pharmacology of TRC105  
The constant regions of SN6j were humanized to yield TRC105 for full -scale development and 
evaluation in clinical studies.  TRC105 (c -SN6j) is a chimeric IgG1 kappa antibody made by 
grafting the constant regions of human IgG1 heavy chain and kappa light chain onto the murine 
variable regions of monoclonal antibody SN6j that binds human CD105.   Using Scatchard plot 
analyses performed by incubating  fixed combinations of radiolabeled and native antibody with 
KM-3 cells, the avidity of TRC105 (c -SN6j) was calculated by regression a nalysis to be 2.98 x 
10
9 liter/mole (or 3.36 x 10-10 mole/liter).  
TRC105 Avidity to Human CD105 
A study of binding of TRC105 with human CD105 using a surface plasmon resonance assay 
indicated that avidity and affinity of TRC105 for human CD105 were approxi mately 5 x 10-12 
and 35 x 10-12 mole/liter, respectively.  
TRC105 Binding Potency to Human CD105  
An ELISA assay was performed using plates coated with human CD105.  TRC105 was found to 
half-saturate human CD105 at concentrations of approximately 34 -50 ng/mL  and to fully saturate 
human CD105 at concentrations of ≥ 250 ng/mL.  TRC105 concentrations of ≥ 250 ng/mL are

expected to saturate CD105 expressed on human  endothelial cells and fully engage effector 
functions.  
TRC105 Avidity to HUVECs In Vitro  
A binding assay was performed to determine the avidity of TRC105 to cultured HUVECs. 
TRC105 was found to half saturate non -confluent (or proliferating) HUVECs at 2.3 ng/mL and 
to half saturate confluent (or non- proliferating) HUVECs at 22 ng/mL.  Saturation was achi eved  
at approximately 250 ng/mL in both cases.  
TRC105 Induction of ADCC of Proliferating HUVECs In Vitro  
TRC105 was investigated for its ability to mediate antibody -dependent cell -mediated  
cytotoxicity (ADCC) in vitro .  In the presence of effector cells f rom three different donors,  
concentrations of ≥ 1 μg/mL of TRC105 lysed significant proportions of proliferating HUVECs, 
indicating that TRC105 exhibits ADCC activity in vitro.   Lower concentrations of TRC105 were 
evaluated for ADCC using HUVEC cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells that were activated with interleukin -2 (see graph below).  TRC105 concentrations of < 1 ng/mL lysed 
significant proportions of proliferating HUVECs in the presence of interleukin -2 activated NK 
cells at an effector to targ et ratio of 10:1.   TRC105 did not engage complement -mediated 
cytotoxicity (CDC) on proliferating HUVECs in vitro.  
 
 
In vitro analysis has shown that anti-CD105 antibodies are  internalized following binding to 
CD105.  SN6j and isotype -matched control IgG w ere individually labeled with FITC and then 
incubated with SVEC4 -10 murine endothelial cells for four hours at room temperature.  SN6j 
reacted with viable SVEC4 -10 murine endothelial cells and was internalized into the cells as 
shown by strong FITC -SN6j st aining within the intracellular portion of cells.   In contrast, only 
weak background staining was seen with the cells treated with FITC -labeled isotype -matched

control IgG.  Internalization of bound TRC105 is expected to limit the ability of the antibody t o 
engage effector functions at low CD105 surface densities, such as those on quiescent 
endothelium.  
1.2.3.2  In Vivo  Nonclinical Toxicology Studies of TRC105  
TRC105 Toxicology  
TRC105 was administered by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes weekly for 5 doses to cynomolgus monkeys, at doses of 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg.  Three monkeys of each 
gender were treated at the two lower doses and six animals of each gender were treated at the high dose (30 mg/kg).  Animals tolerated TRC105 at all doses tested.   There was no clinical, 
clinical pathologic or histopathologic evidence of toxicity.  The no observed event level (NOEL) 
was determined to be 30 mg/kg given by 30 minute intravenous infusion weekly for five doses.  
A GLP repeat -dose toxicology study was undertaken i n cynomolgus monkeys to determine the 
onset, reversibility, persistence, or delayed occurrence of toxic effects after five weekly doses of 
TRC105, followed by a four -week recovery period.  Single -dose pharmacokinetic 
characterization of TRC105 was performed after Day 1 and multiple -dose pharmacokinetic 
characterization of TRC105 was performed after Day 29.  In addition, the immunogenicity of 
TRC105 was determined.  Doses were administered by a 30 minute infusion on days 1, 8, 15, 22 
and 29 into 36 adult mon keys.  There were three males and three females per dose at 3 and 10 
mg/kg/dose and six males and six females at control (vehicle) and 30 mg/kg/dose.   All animals 
were dosed on days 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29 via a 30 minute intravenous  infusion.  Three animals p er 
sex per group in Groups 1 through 4 were euthanized on Day 30, and three animals per sex  per 
group in Groups 1 and 4 were euthanized on Day 57.  Toxicity was assessed by monitoring 
mortality, clinical condition, body weight, food consumption, ophthalmic  examination results, 
electrocardiography (including heart rate), blood pressure, body temperature, respiratory rate, clinical pathology (hematology, coagulation, serum chemistry, urinalysis and fecal occult blood). 
All received a comprehensive necropsy; selected organs were weighed and tissues were 
evaluated microscopically. Survival, clinical condition, body weight, food consumption, 
ophthalmology examinations, physiologic parameters (electrocardiograms, blood pressure, body 
temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate), hematology and coagulation, clinical chemistry, 
urinalysis, fecal occult blood evaluations, organ weights, and macroscopic and microscopic 
findings were unaffected by TRC105 administration.  Accordingly, the no observed effect level 
(NOEL)  for intravenous TRC105 under the conditions of this study was 30 mg/kg.  Tissue 
binding assays were conducted on selected tissues from the control and high -dose groups. 
Animals dosed with TRC105 demonstrated binding to endothelial cells consistent with internalization of bound antibody.  While this staining pattern is consistent with CD105 
distribution, internalized antibody may also reflect binding to Fc receptors known to be expressed by endothelial cells.  Roswell Park Cancer Institute sponsored a non-G LP study in 
which cynomolgus monkeys were dosed twice weekly for three weeks with 1.0 mg/kg, 3.0 mg/kg or 10.0 mg/kg of TRC105 (c - SN6j).  In summary, TRC105 was well -tolerated by 
nonhuman primates when dosed up to 30 mg/kg weekly for five doses as a 30 mi nute 
intravenous infusion in a GLP study or up to 10 mg/kg twice weekly for six doses as an 
intravenous bolus.  The highest dose tested, 30 mg/kg weekly for five doses, produced no 
indications of a drug -related effect in a GLP study and is the NOEL.

1.2.3.3  TRC105  Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity  
Toxicokinetics and immunogenicity were studied following the administration of TRC105 by 
intravenous infusion over 30 minutes weekly for five doses to cynomolgus monkeys, at doses of 
3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg.  The mean central distribution volume was 0.029, 0.040 and 
0.038 L/kg in animals given 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg of TRC105, respectively, by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes.  The mean steady -state volume of distribution was 0.075, 
0.087 and 0.076 L/kg in animals given 3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg of TRC105, respectively.  As expected, the central volume of distribution for TRC105 was similar to the 
serum volume in monkeys.  Both the central and steady -state distribution volumes were 
consistent with distribution volumes of  other chimeric antibodies (e.g., rituximab and 
cetuximab).  The mean terminal half -life of TRC105 was 133, 149 and 153 hours among the 
anti-TRC105 antibody negative animals in the 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg dose groups, respect ively. 
Steady -state was attained by 5 weeks in each dose group.  The mean serum TRC105 Cmax was 
83, 135 and 104 µg/mL in the 3 mg/kg dose group on Study Days 1, 22 and 29, respectively.   In 
the 10 mg/kg dose group the mean Cmax values were 212, 346 and 306 µg/mL, and were 834, 
1113 and 957 µg/mL in the 30 mg/kg dose group on Study Days 1, 22, and 29, respectively.  A 
single monkey dosed with 30 mg/kg of TRC105 tested positive for the formation of MACA 
(monkey anti -chimeric antibodies; i.e., antibodies  react ive with the human portion of TRC105) 
on Study Days 36, 43, and 50, but not Study Day 57.  All animals that tested negative for 
MAMA (monkey anti -murine antibodies; i.e., antibodies reactive with the murine portion of 
TRC105) before dose administration on Study Day 1 also tested negative when subsequent 
samples were obtained throughout the remainder of the study.  Several other animals tested 
positive for MAMA prior to the first dose administration on Study Day 1 and also tested positive (at lower titers) a t frequent times throughout the 57 day study period.  
1.2.3.4  TRC105 Non clinical Efficacy  
TRC105 was studied in vivo for its ability to inhibit angiogenesis using a murine model of 
choroidal neovascularization (CNV).  C57B/L6 mice were given an intravitreal inject ion of 
TRC105 in one eye and PBS in the contralateral  eye.  TRC105 demonstrated dose -dependent 
inhibition of CNV in C57B/L6 mice.  The highest dose administered (5 μg in 1 μL) inhibited 
CNV by over 50% versus control.  
1.2.3.5  TRC105 Clinical Pharmacology, Toxicity and Efficacy  
Clinical Studies of TRC105  
Several studies with TRC105 are underway or have been completed.  An open -label, phase 1, 
multicenter study  of TRC105 (Study 105ST101) enrolled fifty patients, who were treated until 
disease progression with TRC105 at 0.01 -15 mg/kg/q2wk or 10 -15 mg/kg/wk.  Studies of 
TRC105 in prostate, bladder, and ovarian cancer and a phase 1b study of TRC105 in 
combination w ith bevacizumab have also been completed.  Ongoing studies besides this phase 
1b study of TRC105 in combination with sorafenib in liver cancer include: a phase 1b/2 study of TRC105 in combination with axitinib in renal cell carcinoma, a phase 1b/2 study of  TRC105 in 
combination with pazopanib, a phase 1b study of TRC105 in combination with bevacizumab in glioblastoma multiforme, and a single -patient study of TRC105 in combination with 
bevacizumab in choriocarcinoma .

TRC105 Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
In Study  105ST101, TRC105 pharmacokinetics were assessed on patients enrolled at doses up to 
15 mg/kg weekly.  Circulating TRC105 was not measurable above the lower limit of quantitation 
of the assay (78 ng/mL) in patients receiving doses below 0.3 mg/kg.  TRC105 was measurable 
above the target concentration based on preclinical data (200 ng/mL) for 4 hours at 0.3 mg/kg, 1 day at 1 mg/kg, 5 days at 3 mg/kg, 7 days at 10 mg/kg TRC105 dosed every two weeks.  Serum 
concentrations expected to saturate CD105 binding sit es (≥ 200 ng/mL) were achieved 
continuously at 15 mg/kg q2wk and 10 mg/kg weekly, and TRC105 accumulated at 15 mg/kg weekly ( Figure 1). 
Figure 1: Single -Dose and Multiple -Dose Pharm acokinetic Data from Study 105ST101 
 
 
TRC105 Clinical Immunogenicity  
In Study 105ST101, serum samples for evaluation of TRC105 immunogenicity, including 
HAMA and HACA, were collected pre- dose on day 1 of each 28 day cycle, at the end of study, 
and then at  4 and 12 weeks after the end of study visit.  
HAMA and HACA data are available from the phase 1 monotherapy TRC105 trial.  Neither 
HAMA nor HACA were detected in patients treated with CHO -produced TRC105, which will be 
used for all future clinical trials, including this study. TRC105 Clinical Safety  
A total of 50 patients were treated on a phase 1 Study 105ST101 with escalating doses of 
TRC105 at 0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 15 mg/kg every two weeks and then 10 and 15 
mg/kg weekly.  Dose escalation proceeded stepwise until the top dose was reached.  The 
maximum tolerated dose was exceeded at 15 mg/kg weekly and the recommended phase 2 dose 
of TRC105 was therefore determined to be 10 mg/kg weekly.  Three of 4 patients at 15 mg/kg 
weekly developed grade 3  hypoproliferative anemia (without leucopenia or thrombocytopenia) in 
18

cycle 2, and one of the three progressed to grade 4 in cycle 3.  Anemia was associated with 
accumulation of TRC105 and characterized by a low reticulocyte production index.  Additional 
laboratory and clinical evaluations excluded common causes of anemia including blood loss, 
hemolysis, plasma volume expansion, inadequate erythropoietin, iron deficiency, and vitamin B -
12 or folate deficiency.  The anemia is believed to result from TRC105-m ediated suppression of  
proerythroblasts, the only cells in the bone marrow known to express substantial levels of CD105.  Anemia was reversible and manageable with dose reduction and standard supportive 
measures including erythropoietin and blood transfus ion.   
Infusion reactions, anemia, fatigue, epistaxis and headache were the most frequently observed adverse events considered related to TRC105.  The majority of treatment -related adverse events 
were grade 1 or 2.  
Infusion reactions, among the most common  adverse events, were usually with the initial 
TRC105 dose and included one or more of the following signs or symptoms: rigors, bronchospasm, urticaria, hypertension, hypotension, tachycardia or bradycardia.  Infusion reactions were initially reported at 1  mg/kg every 2 weeks for patients receiving TRC105 
produced in NS0 cells without premedication.  TRC105 produced in CHO cells was known to more potently engage ADCC in vitro  than TRC105 produced in NS0 cells.  Because of this, the 
initial dose level for pa tients receiving CHO -produced TRC105 was de -escalated to 0.3 mg/kg.  
Despite dose de- escalation, the first two patients at 0.3 mg/kg treated with CHO -produced 
TRC105 experienced grade 2 and grade 3 infusion reactions with the first dose in the absence of premedication.  The protocol was therefore amended to require a glucocorticoids -based 
premedication regimen and extend the initial infusion duration from 1 to 4 hours.   
The amendment mandating premedication and extended initial infusion duration successfu lly 
reduced the frequency and severity of infusion reactions and allowed dose escalation to continue. One additional patient who received CHO -produced TRC105 at 1 mg/kg developed a grade 3 
infusion reaction with the third dose given over 2 hours.  This pat ient had experienced a grade 2 
infusion reaction when the dose was administered over 4 hours.  In all three patients with grade 3 
infusion reactions, TRC105 was not detectable in serum at the time of dosing, which allowed de 
novo binding of TRC105 to CD105 expressing endothelium within the vasculature.  Grade 3 
infusion reactions were not observed in patients dosed at 10 or 15 mg/kg who maintained 
TRC105 serum levels known to saturate CD105 binding sites for the full dosing interval.  At 
dose levels where continuous TRC105 serum levels were achieved, glucocorticoids were safely 
discontinued and the infusion duration reduced to 1 hour.  
Three patients developed grade 1 cutaneous telangiectasia on the trunk early in the course of therapy, all at dose levels of 10 or 15 mg/kg weekly that resulted in continuous serum levels of 
TRC105 known to saturate CD105 sites on human endothelium.  Grade 1 or 2 hemorrhage was reported, including intermittent postcoital vaginal bleeding (that also occurred prior to TRC105 
treatment), epistaxis, and superficial gingival bleeding.    
Grade 1 or 2 headaches were observed, mainly in patients treated at doses of TRC105 above 3 mg/kg.  Headaches began the day following infusion and were generally manageable with 
acetaminophen.  However, grade 2 headache in one patient at 15 mg/kg weekly prompted 
discontinuation prior to completion of the dose -limiting toxicity evaluation period.  Fatigue was

one of the more common adverse events attributable to TRC105 and was more prevalent at doses 
above 3 mg/kg.   
One patient developed dose -limiting toxicity of grade 4 hemorrhage presenting as melena from a 
gastric ulcer within 5 days of the initial TRC105 infusion at 0.1 mg/kg.  He discontinued 
TRC105 treatment, was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells and the bleeding resolved 
with nonsurgical management by the time of upper endoscopy.  Serious bleeding was not 
observed following protocol amendment to exclude patients with a history of peptic ulcer disease 
(unless healing was documented) and patients on ulcerogenic medications including non -
steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs.  
Classic toxicities associated with VEGF inhibition, including hypertension, proteinuria and 
thrombosis were not prominent.  One patient with recurrent anal cancer treated  at 0.1 mg/kg 
developed proteinuria considered possibly related to TRC105, but proteinuria was also noted prior to TRC105 dosing.  Transient hypertension (156/112) without QT changes occurred in a 
single patient one day following infusion of 15 mg/kg, and was controlled by a single dose of 
oral antihypertensive medication. There were no arterial or venous thromboembolic events, nor 
gastrointestinal or other perforations in these patients. TRC105 Clinical Efficacy  
In study 105ST101 stable disease ≥ 2 months was observed in 21 of 45 patients (47%) and stable disease ≥ 4 months in 6 of 44 patients (14%).  Decreases in CEA, PSA, or CA -125 were noted in 
7 of 21 patients (33%) and a global decrease in key angiogenic biom arkers was observed with 
treatment.  One patient with castrate -refractory prostate cancer remains on TRC105 treatment 
after 6 years at a TRC105 dose of 0.01 mg/kg every 2 weeks.  He has an ongoing complete PSA response, with resolution of bone pain and bone scan normalization. One patient with metastatic 
carcinosarcoma, manifested decreased tumor burden on computerized tomographic scanning and 
maintained stable disease for 20 months on therapy. The latter is especially notable when one 
considers that this patient had received three prior treatments -- carboplatin + paclitaxel for 4 
months, anastrozole for 8 months, and ifosfamide for 2 months -- and had manifested tumor 
progression on each.  In effect, TRC105 provided the most favorable clinical outcome and did so 
as a fourth -line therapy.  
1.2.3.6    TRC105 Physical , Chemical , and  Pharmaceutical  Properties and Formulations  
Physical, Chemical and Pharmaceutical Properties  
TRC105 is a chimeric anti -CD105 IgG1 antibody consisting of human Cκ and Cγ1 constant

400 mg TRC105/16 mL single -use vial  
 
TRC105 is formulated as a preserv ative -free solution containing sodium chloride, monobasic 
sodium phosphate monohydrate, anhydrous dibasic sodium phosphate, and Sterile Water for 
Injection.  Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may be added to adjust the pH. TRC105 
is formulated to b e isotonic with a pH of 6.2 – 8.2. 
Storage Conditions  
TRC105 should be stored refrigerated 2 °C to 8 °C (36 °F to 46 °F).  Preparations of TRC105 in 
infusion containers are stable for up to 8 hours at room temperature.  
Manufacturing Process  
The TRC105 production cell line for initial phase I clinical testing was a NS0 cell line.   The 
manufacturing process used bioreactors with media containing bovine sera from the US or New 
Zealand. A high producing CHO cell line was subsequently developed for phase  I and l ater stage 
clinical development using media that is free of animal- derived components.  The manufacturing 
process uses conventional purification and filtration steps and concludes with the formulation of 
TRC105 in phosphate buffered saline.   The purity of TRC105 is greater than 95%.  Only CHO 
derived material will be used in this study.

In vitro  kinase assays demonstrated that sorafenib  is a potent inhibitor of wild type and mutant 
(V599E) B -Raf and c -Raf Kinase isoforms (Investigator’s Brochure).  In addition, sorafenib  did 
not inhibit human EGFR or Her2 kinases at 10 µ M.  Nor were PKC -α, PKC -β, PKC -γ, and PKA 
(rat, rabbit and bovine sources) kinase activity inhibited in vitro .  Sorafenib demonstrated an IC 50 
of 780 nM against p59 (bovine) Fyn kinase (Src family of protein tyrosine kinases).  In non -
kinase targets sorafe nib had moderate potency against the adenosine A3, dopamine D1, and 
muscarinic M3 receptors with IC 50 of 1.6 µM, 2.0 µM, and 3.1 µM, respectively.  Sorafenib  did 
not inhibit MEK -1, ERK -1, EGFR, HER2/neu, c -met, PKA, PKB, Cdk -1/cyclin B, pim -1, GSK

3-b, CK -2, PKC -α (r), PKC -β (r), PKC -γ at concentrations as high as 10 µM.  In summary, 
sorafenib  showed ≥100- fold more selectivity for raf kinase relative to other target proteins.  
Sorafenib also inhibited in vitro  several receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) that ar e involved in 
tumor progression, human VEGFR -2, murine VEGFR -2, murine VEGFR -3, murine PDGFR -β, 
Flt-3, c-KIT, and p38α (MAPK family).  In cellular assays, sorafenib  was found to be a potent 
inhibitor of human and murine VEGFR -2, murine VEGFR -3, and murine PDGFR -β receptor 
phosphorylation (Investigator’s Brochure, 2003).  
VEGF and PDGF receptors are involved in the mechanism of tumor angiogenesis30, 31.  PDGF 
receptors may also play a role in patients with chronic myeloproliferative cancers32.  Flt-3 is 
important in acute myelogenous leukemia 33 and c -Kit plays a critical role in gastrointestinal 
stromal tumors34. 
1.2.4.2  In Vivo  Activity  
Sorafenib has demonstrated in vivo  anti-tumor efficacy as a single agent against a broad range of 
human tumor xenografts as summarized in the  following table.  The models evaluated include 
HCT -116 and DLD -1 colon tumor xenografts, MX -1 mammary tumor xenograft, NCI -H460 and 
A549 NSCLC xenografts, MiaPaCa -2 pancreatic tumor xenografts, and SK -OV-3 ovarian tumor 
xenografts.  In this table, compoun d efficacy is expressed as percent tumor growth inhibition 
(TGI) and is calculated as ((1 -(T/C)) *100, where T and C represent the mean tumor size in the 
Treated and Control groups respectively at the first measurement after the end of treatment.  In 
the N CI-H460 (K -ras mutant) and A549 NSCLC tumor xenografts model, BAY 43- 9600, at 
doses of 10mg/k, 30mg/k and 60mg/kg, induced a tumor growth inhibition of 27, 60 and 68%, respectively.

The majority of the initial anti- tumor efficacy evaluations in vivo  were conducted in the HCT116 
colon tumor model since the tumorigenicity of this cell line was previously shown to be 
depende nt on K -ras activation.  Additional studies indicated that prolonged anti -tumor efficacy 
could be attained by extending the duration of treatment and that, in this tumor model, sorafenib  
was able to arrest tumor growth even if therapy was initiated against  a substantially greater 
tumor burden.  
Sorafenib also showed significant oral activity against two additional human tumor xenograft 
models that contain K -ras mutations: MiaPaCa- 2 pancreatic carcinoma and H460 non -small cell 
lung carcinoma.  The anti -tumor efficacy of sorafenib  was also evaluated against the human 
SKOV -3 ovarian tumor cell line that contains a wild -type Ras but over -expresses both the EGF 
and Her2 growth factor receptors.  These receptors also signal through the Ras/Raf/Mek 
pathway.  
In human tumor xenografts, MDA -MB-231 (breast) and Colo -205 (colon), there was a dramatic 
reduction of tumor neo -vascularization (Investigator’s Brochure).  Recent data also indicated that 
inhibition of c -raf may promote cell death in endothelial cells as a downst ream event of VEGFR -
2 stimulation35. 
Taken together, data suggests that sorafenib may be of therapeutic value not only i n human 
tumors containing ras gene mutations, but also in tumors over -expressing growth factor receptors 
in the Ras/Raf/Mek pathway, and by inhibiting tumor angiogenesis or neo -vascularization 
through inhibition of VE GFR -2, VEGFR -3, and/or PDGFR -β. 
The ability of sorafenib  (or its tosylate salt, BAY 54 -9085) to be combined with paclitaxel, 
irinotecan, gemcitabine, or cisplatin was evaluated in preclinical in vivo  models.  In these studies, 
the focus was to evaluate if the co -administration of  sorafenib  would adversely affect the 
tolerance or anti -tumor efficacy of the ‘standard of care’ agent.  The general health of mice was 
monitored and mortality was recorded daily.  Tumor dimensions and body weights were 
recorded twi ce a week starting with the first day of treatment.  Treatments producing greater than 
20% lethality and/or 20% net body weight loss were considered ‘toxic’.  The results of these combinability analyses are summarized below:

Sorafenib can be safely combined with a variety of standard cytotoxic cancer chemotherapy 
agents, including paclitaxel, irinotecan, gemcitabine and cisplatin with no significant increase in 
the toxicity associated with those agents and without diminishing their an ti-tumor efficacy in 
preclinical models.  
1.2.4.3  Preclinical Pharmacology  
Sorafenib’s absorption in mice and dogs is 92% and 69%, respectively.  The bioavailability in mice and rats was 79% and in dogs was 61%.  Plasma clearance in mice, rats and dogs was low 
(CL< 0.21 l/h/kg) and the Vss was also low (~0.7 – 0.9 l/kg).  Excretion of the compound is 
primarily via the biliary/fecal route in rats and dogs.  Protein binding was high; the mean free fraction was 2.5% in mice, 1.6% in dogs, 1.4% in rats, and 1.2% in human s.  Sorafenib  showed a 
market potency to inhibit several CYP isoforms involved in drug metabolism and clinically relevant drug -drug interactions with substrates of different isoforms appear to be possible.   In 
vitro model of enzyme induction using human h epatocyte showed no significant induction of 
CYP 1A, 2C9, 2C19 and 3A enzymes, but CYP 3A4 is the enzyme responsible for the 
metabolism of sorafenib  in vitro  in man.  
1.2.4.4  Clinical Pharmacology  
Evaluation of data across four different studies has indicated that in consistence with its half -life, 
plasma sorafenib  accumulates upon multiple dosing.  There is no further increase in sorafenib  
Cmax and/or AUC values beyond 7 days of multiple dosing.  There is a less than proportional 
increase in sorafenib  Cmax and AUC values with increasing doses from 100 mg bid to 800 mg 
bid.  Data from four ascending dose studies show that sorafenib  exhibits high inter -patient 
pharmacokinetic variability that is not explained by age, race, gender, or body weight.  Sorafenib  
generally accounts for approximately 64 -86% of the circulating analytes after at least 7 days of 
multiple dosing.  Approximately 19% of the dose is excreted in urine and 76% in feces.  BAY 
68-3472 is the major metabolite in plasma.  The relationship between dose and  anti-tumor 
activity cannot be accurately estimated based on the available data.  The dose of 400 mg bid 
exhibits a similar safety profile in hepatoma patients with either Child’s Pugh A or Child’s Pugh 
B hepatic function status even though preliminary data shows numerical differences in PK.  
1.2.4.5  Preclinical Toxicology  
Single -dose oral toxicity/tolerance studies were conducted in the rat, mouse and dog.  Repeated -
dose toxicity was covered by studies with daily oral treatment of up to 6 months in rats, 3 months 
in mice, and up to 12 months in dogs.  Subacute studies in rats and dogs included a 4- week 
reversibility segment for the high dose level.  The preclinical toxicity profile of sorafenib  short -
term high -dose treatment was well -tolerated clinically by rats, mice and dogs.  Exposure -
dependent mortality (mean time to death ≥ 3 weeks) occurred without preceding specific signs of morbidity in rats.  Dose -limiting toxicity in dogs was gastrointestinal (emesis, bloody diarrhea) 
at 30 mg/kg bid or 60 mg/kg bid.  Aside  from effects on the GI tract (bloody diarrhea) and 
marked effects on the skin (hair loss, inflammation) once daily dosing of up to 60 mg/kg for 3 
months was clinically well tolerated by dogs.  In rats, repeated -dose toxicity studies were all

conducted with once daily oral administration.   Mortality was induced at a dose of 5 mg/kg/d 
sorafenib  in a 3 -month study.  In a chronic 6 -month study, no mortality was induced at the 
highest dose tested of 2.5 mg/kg sorafenib ; this dose is considered the MTD.  Histopa thology 
revealed degeneration/regeneration processes in multiple organ systems including liver, kidneys, 
lymphoreticular/hematopoietic system, GI tract, pancreas, adrenals, reproductive organs, skin, 
teeth, and bone.  No main target organ of toxicity could be identified.  Some morphological 
lesions were not reversible within 4 weeks (e.g., bile duct proliferation, liver fibrosis, adrenal necrosis, effects on lymphoreticular system) following a 4 -week course of treatment.  The 
morphological no- effect -level after 3 months of treatment was below 10mg/kg/d and 1 mg/kg/d 
for dogs and rats, respectively.  Some changes, notably in the liver (bile duct proliferation) and 
skin (degeneration of hair follicles), were observed at this dose level.  Changes in hematology 
and clinical chemistry were poor predictive indicators for specific organ lesions. Serum levels of hepatic transaminases were markedly, but not consistently, elevated.  At the repeated MTD in 
rats (2.5 mg/kg/d) and dogs (30 mg/kg/d), AUC 0- 24 was about 35 mg/h/l at steady stat, 
indicating no substantial difference in toxicity in the two species when compared at systemic 
exposure.  
Based on genotoxicity assays, SORAFENIB  does not demonstrate a significant risk of 
genotoxicity to patients .  Results from the g eneral (repeated dose) toxicity studies indicate that 
BAY43 -9006 has the potential to adversely impair reproduction performance, as well as 
embryonic and fetal development. Various effects, including retardation, were observed in male and female reproducti ve organs of rats.  
1.2.4.6  Clinical Toxicology  
Preliminary anti -tumor activity has been reported in a variety of tumor types with tumor 
shrinkage seen in colorectal carcinoma, melanoma, thyroid, sarcoma, pancreatic cancer, and renal cell cancer.  Sorafenib is well  tolerated at 400 mg bid.  Dose limiting toxicities occurring 
more frequently at higher doses include hand -foot syndrome, diarrhea, fatigue, hypertension, 
pain, and rash.  ≥ Grade 3 and 4 drug- related adverse events were uncommon.  Significant events 
reported included grade 3 or 4 amylase and lipase elevation (not associated with symptoms of pancreatitis), and hand foot syndrome.  In addition, mild to moderate drug -related ad verse events 
reported included flu- like symptoms, fever arthralgia, hypertension, weight loss, anorexia, 
abdominal pain, vomiting, elevated liver function tests, pruritus and alopecia.  
1.2.5 Rationale for combining TRC105 with Sorafenib   
By targeting a unique and important angiogenic pathway, TRC105 has the potential to complement existing antiangiogenic therapies.  One of the reasons postulated for the limited 
efficacy of anti -angiogenic agents is that they cause intra- tumoral hypoxia.  Intra -tumoral 
hypoxia cau ses the induction and up -regulation of hypoxia -inducible factors (HIF) such as HIF -
1α which can result in evasive mechanisms of resistance
18.  CD105, the target for TRC105, is 
expressed at significantly higher levels following VEGF inhibition in animal models of human cancer.  The increase in CD105 expression is likely an attempt to compensate for or escape from 
VEGF inhibition.  This escape mechanism could be inhibited with a combination approach 
targeting both pathways simultaneously.

Our basic  concept is based on two hypotheses: 1) angiogenesis plays a particularly crucial role in 
the pathogenesis of HCC and 2) interrupting the angiogenic pathway at different levels in 
combination will be more effective than targeting one level.  
1.2.6 Summary of Phas e I 
As of July 2014, 15 patients were enrolled onto the phase 1 portion of this study which combined  
TRC105 – a monoclonal antibody that binds CD105, a transmembrane receptor overexpressed 
by proliferating endothelial cells – with standard of care sorafeni b. The dose of sorafenib was 
fixed across all dose levels of the study and was as per standard of care (400mg BI D). TRC-105 
was administered every two weeks  at doses of 3, 6, 10 and 15mg/kg. All patients had HCC with 
either non- cirrhotic livers or cirrhosi s (the majority) with compensated liver dysfunction (Childs 
Pugh A/B7) and an ECOG of 0/1. A recommended phase II dose was established of TRC -105 
15mg/kg in combination with sorafenib 400mg bid. Overall the treatment was well tolerated and the study proceeded as per protocol to testing of the maximum planned dose level, DL4 
(15mg/kg). One DLT was encountered at 10mg/kg – transaminase elevation – which necessitated 
expansion of that cohort. One grade 5 cardiac event was also experienced . The subject had 
severe three vessel disease, which is the most likely cause of his death.   However,  the 
contribution of protocol treatment could not be excluded.  The most common side -effects we 
encountered were hand -foot skin reactions as a result of sorafenib. With regard to efficacy two 
patients - treated at 10 and 15mg/kg dose level - developed a PR by RECIST and the majority of 
patients had tumor reduction.  Median time on study was 4 months and one patient remained on treatment after 22 months.

2.3 REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
2.3.1 On-Study R egistration  
Authorized staff must register an eligible candidate with NCI Central Registration Office (CRO) 
within 24 hours of signing consent.  A registration Eligibility Checklist from the web site 
(http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/intra/eligibility/welcome.htm ) must be completed and sent via 
encrypted email to:  NCI Central Registration Office (HOIS) ncicentralregistration -
l@mail.nih.gov .  After confirmation of eligibility at Central Registration Office, CRO staff will 
call pharmacy to advise them of the acceptance of the patient on the protocol prior to the release 
of any investigational agents.  Verification of Registration will be forwarded electronically via e-
mail to the research team.  Please note, it is very important for all registrars to acquire encrypted  
e-mail from NIH Help Desk, since the verification of registration includes patient’s information.   
A recorder is available during non -working hours.  
3 STUDY IMPLEMENTATION  
3.1 STUDY DESIGN  
For both the phase I and phase II portions of this study TRC105 will be  administered as an IV 
infusion every two weeks .  Sorafenib will be self -administered as a daily oral pill. Patients will 
be reviewed every week in clinic, with labs and routine history and physical performed.   Patients 
will be re -staged every 8 weeks.  Please see the Study Calendar for a detailed summary.  
3.2 PHASE I (DOSE ESCALATION COMPLETE AS OF AMENDMENT L) 
The first part of this study is a standard 3+3 dose escalation phase I study with the primary objective of establishing MTD for the combination.  Soraf enib will be taken orally at a dose of 
400 mg twice daily.  TRC105 will be adm inistered as an infusion every 2 week s.  Patients will be 
re-staged every 8 weeks.  The TRC105 dose  will be escalated as tolerated in cohorts of 3 to 6 
patients  (see table below) .  Intra-patient dose escalation is not  allowed.  However, if a patient has 
had a dose reduction of sorafenib for toxicity and tolerates this dose for 28 days, the sorafenib 
may be re -escalated by one dose- level only, as per standard clinical practice.  
The planned dose -escalation schedule is as follows:  
Cohort  Sorafenib

(mg/kg IV every 2 
weeks )

4 400  15 
Each cohort in the phase I portion of the study is planned to have at least 3 patients to evaluate 
for toxicity.  Three patients will be treated at a given dose level and observed for acute toxicity 
for one course of treatment before any more patients are entered.  The descriptions and grading 
scales found in the revised NCI Common Termin ology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting.  
If none of the three patients at a given dose level experience s dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) , 
accrual will proceed to the next cohort .  
If one of three patients treated at a dose level experiences DLT that is considered to be at least 
possibly related to TRC105, then three more patients will be  enrolled at that same level.  If the 
incidence of DLT among those six patients is one in six, then the next cohort of three pat ients 
will be  treated at the next higher dose.  
In general, if two or more of the six patients treated at a dose level experience DLT, then the MTD is considered to have been exceeded .  The MTD is defined as the highest dose studied for 
which the inciden ce of DLT was less than 33% .  
For MTD determination, dose -limiting toxicities will be evaluated throughout the first 28 days of 
treatment (Cycle 1).  Patients who exit the study for reasons other than drug -related toxicity prior 
to completion of the 28 -day D LT evaluation period will be replaced to ensure an adequate safety 
assessment of each cohort.  If at the first dose level more than one DLT is observed in the first three subjects, or more than two DLTs in six subjects are observed, 3 -6 patients will be ac crued 
to Dose Level - 1.

If >2 patients experience a DLT at any dose level, at any time in phase I, then subsequent 
patients will be enrolled at the next lower dose level.  
3.2.1 Dose Limiting Toxicities   
The following adverse event management guidelines are intended to ensure the safety of each 
patient while on the study.  The descriptions and grading scales found in the revised NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE 
reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a cop y of the CTCAE version 
4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site 
(http://ctep.cancer.gov ).   
3.2.2 Definition of Dose -limiting Toxicities (DLT s): 
3.2.2.1  Dose limi ting toxicity 
• Grade 3 electrolyte toxicities unable to be corrected to Grade 1 or less within 24 hours will be considered dose limiting (proteinuria >3.5 g/24 hour will be defined as a DLT).  
• Drug -related Grade 4 hematological toxicity will be considered do se limiting.  
• Toxicity requiring a dose reduction or a delay in treatment for >7 days will be considered dose limiting.  
• Other Grade 3 or higher toxicity considered related to TRC105 will be considered dose-limiting.  
3.2.2.2  Exclusions to Dose limiting toxicities  
• Grade 3 hypertension that can be controlled with oral medications and does not require treatment delay for > 7 days or dose reduction will not be considered a DLT.  Refer to 
Section 3.4.4.2  for guidelines on managing drug-induc ed hypertension.  
• Grade 3 diarrhea will only be considered dose- limiting if it is refractory to treatment.  
Grade 4 diarrhea will be dose limiting.  
• Nausea and vomiting Grade 3 will only be considered dose -limiting if it is refractory to 
anti-emetic therap y and unable to be corrected to Grade 1 or less within 48 hours.  higher dose level.  
• If 1 or more of this group suffer DLT, then dose escalation 
is stopped, and this dose is declared the maximally 
administered dose.  Three (3) additional patients will be 
entered at the next lowest dose level if only 3 patients were 
treated previously at that dose.  
<1 out of 6 at highest 
dose level below the 
maximally administered 
dose This is generally the recommended phase 2 dose.  At least 6 patients must be entered at the recommended phase 2 dose.

Amendment:  N 
• Grade 3 rise in creatinine, not corrected to Grade 1 or less after 2 liters of intravenous 
fluids within 24 hours, will be considered dose limiting.  All Grade 4 rises in creatinine 
will be d ose limiting.  
• Any grade elevation in transaminases that is attributable as being likely related to 
sorafenib and/or disease alone and will be an exception to DLT.  
• Grade 3 rash will not be considered dose limiting unless it does not return to ≤ Grade 2 
after 1 week of symptomatic treatment.  
• Grade 3 hand -foot syndrome will not constitute DLT.  
• Grade 3 and 4 infusion reactions due to TRC105 administration will be consider ed to be 
dose-limiting toxicity.   
Three patients must  complete at least 1 cycle of therapy prior to considering dose escalation in 
the next cohort of patients.  Determination of DLT for the purpose of dose escalation enrollment 
will be based on toxicities observed in the first 28 days of treatment (cycle 1)  and must be 
considered as at least possibly related to study drug.  Evaluation for toxicity will continue 
throughout the study and should dose limiting toxicities occur beyond the cycle one, 
consideratio n will be given to halting the dose escalation and studying lower dose levels.  
3.3 PHASE II  
The protocol will be reassessed by the IRB before proceeding to the phase II component of the 
study.  Specifically, data from the phase I that supports treatment of larger cohorts in the phase II 
at a specific dose will be presented to the IRB along with a revised consent document that will summarize updated results and toxicities.  
TRC105 and sorafenib will be administered at the 15 mg/kg TRC105 IV every 2 weeks and 400 
mg sorafenib PO twice per day (the recommended phase 2 dose  defined from the phase I 
portion) .  The sample size and interim stopping rule will be determined using a Simon optimal 
two-stage design.   
The first stage will initially enroll 6 evaluable patien ts, and if 0 of the 6 have a clinical response, 
then no further patients will be accrued. If 1 or more of the first 6 patients has a clinical response, 
then accrual would continue until a total of 23 patients have been enrolled. As it may take several 
week s to determine if a patient has experienced a response, a temporary pause in the accrual may 
be necessary to ensure that enrollment to the second stage is warranted. If there are 1 to 2 clinical responses in 23 patients, this would be an uninterestingly lo w response rate. If there were 3 or 
more complete responses in 23 patients (13.0%), this would be sufficiently interesting to warrant further study in later trials. Under the null hypothesis (5% response rate), the probability of early 
termination is 73.5% .Drug Administration  
3.3.1 TRC105 Drug Administration  
All treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.  
Thirty minutes to two hours prior to the start of each TRC105 infusion, all patients will receive 
the following premedications:  
• Acetaminophen 650 mg PO x 1  
34 
Abbreviated Title:  Sorafenib and TRC105 in HCC  
NCI Protocol #:  11-C-0102  
Version Date:  June 10, 2016  
Amendment:  N 
• Dexamethasone 20 mg IV x 1  
• Famotidine 50 mg IV x 1 (or similar H2 blocker)  
• Cetirizine  10 mg IV  or PO  x 1  (or similar oral or intravenous antihistamine)  
• Granisetron  1mg IV x 1  
After completing pre- medications, TRC105 will be administered intraven ously utilizing an 
infusion pump.  TRC105 has been demonstrated to be compatible with polyethylene lined, non -
DEHP infusion sets and polyvinyl chloride, non -DEHP infusion sets.  TRC105 is required to be 
administered with a 0.2 micron downstream filter.  The attachment of the infusion pump 
administration set to the i.v. bag and transport of the TRC105 study drug to the patient will be 
performed as per standard study site procedures.    
On Cycle 1 Day 1, TRC105 will be infused over a period of four hours.  If a patient completes 
one 4 hour infusion without the development of  an infusion reaction, the n subsequent TRC105 
infusion s may be reduced to 2 hours.  If a patient complete s one 2 hour infusion without the 
development of an infusion reaction, subsequent TRC 105 infusions may be reduced to a 
minimum of 1 hour  (7 mg/mL TRC105 material) or 90 minutes (25 mg/mL TRC105 material) .     
After the minimum TRC105 infusion duration of 1 hour  (7 mg/mL TRC105 material) or 90 
minutes (25 mg/mL TRC105 material)  has been saf ely administered, the dexamethasone should 
be gradually tapered as tolerated with each subsequent infusion and eventually discontinued if 
possible .  The dexamethasone dose should not be reduced unless the prior infusion was well -
tolerated (no infusion reaction of any grade).   
Recommended Dexamethasone Taper Schedule  
Infusion  Dexamethasone Dose and Schedule

Subsequent infusions  No dexamethasonea 
aThe dexamethasone dose should not be reduced unless the prior infusion was well -tolerated (no infusion 
reaction of any grade).  
Patients with infusion –related  events of any grade should be ma naged appropriately (Section 
3.3.1.1 ) and are not permitted to reduce infusion duration or pre -medications on the subsequent  
infusion .  Patients who experience a grade 3 or higher hypersensitivity reaction will be taken off 
treatment until toxicity resolution.  Each infusion of TRC105 must be completed within 8 hours 
of reconstitution.  Once the i.v. bag containing TRC105 is empty, the i.v. line should be flushed 
with 2 0 mL of normal saline at the same rate of infusion.  The dose level and infusion start and 
stop times must be recorded in the source documents.   
3.3.1.1  Management of TRC105 Infusion Reactions  
If a patient experiences a grade 2, 3 or 4 adverse reaction during infu sion, the infusion should be 
stopped and the patient treated accordingly.  Antipyretic, antihistamine and other therapies 
should be administered as indicated.  If appropriate, t he infusion may be restarted at half of the

previous rate when the patient is able to continue.  Infusion reactions will be recorded as AEs in 
the case report form.  Interventions should be documented as concomitant medications or 
concomitant treatments as appropriate.   
3.3.2 Sorafenib Administration  
Sorafenib will generally be administered on an  outpatient basis except when admission is 
required for any reason.  No investigational or commercial agents or therapies other than those 
described in the protocol  may be administered with the intent to treat the patient’s malignancy.  
Sorafenib is supplied as 200- mg tablets and is administered orally twice a day.  Patients are to 
swallow the tablets whole with approximately 250 ml (8 oz.) of water, each morning and evening (i.e., 12 -hourly).  Tablets may be taken with or without food.  Sorafenib  will be given as self -
administered oral doses at 400 mg bid continuously in a 28 days cycle  
3.3.2.1  Special Precautions:  
Sorafenib tosylate is metabolized by the P450 CYP3A enzyme and has been shown in preclinical 
studies to inhibit multiple CYP isoforms .  The follo wing medications will be excluded prior to and 
during the study if is indicated: ketoconazole, itraconazole, ritonavir, products containing grapefruit juice, cyclosporine, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital and prophylactic use of 
G-CSF, GM -CSF.  
Soraf enib has the ability to inhibit a variety of liver metabolic enzymes in vitro .  The clinical 
impact of this inhibition in humans taking drugs metabolized by these enzymes is unknown. Therefore, all patients enrolled onto this trial who are taking concomitant medications that are 
known to be metabolized by the liver should be closely observed for side effects of these 
concomitant medications.  Furthermore, patients taking narrow therapeutic index medications, 
(e.g. warfarin, quinidine, or digoxin) should be monitored proactively .

3.4.3 Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications : General Guidelines (See section below for specific 
toxicities).  
3.4.3.1  Grade 1 Toxicity  
Treatment with sorafenib and TRC105 need not be interrupte d.  For symptoms that last more 
than 7 days and have been found to be intolerab le to the patient, the dose of sorafenib and 
TRC105 may be reduced to the next lower dose level.  
3.4.3.2  Grade 2 Non -Hematologic Toxicity  
Patients who have a grade 2 event may have a dose interruption.  However, re -initiation of 
sorafenib and TRC105 at the same d ose is allowed provided the adverse event has resolved  to 
grade 1 or baseline .  
3.4.3.3  Grade 3 Non -Hematologic Toxicity  
Hold sorafenib and TRC105 and re -evaluate at least bi-weekly until toxicity improves to ≤ grade 
1 or pre -treatment baseline.  Reduce dose of either sorafenib or TRC105 by one dose level  based 
on the discretion of the investigator .  Treatment will be discontinued in patients who experience 
grade 3 non -hematologic toxicities that do not resolve to grade 1 or baseline within 4 weeks.  
3.4.3.4  Grade 4 Non -Hematologic Toxicity  
Patients with clinical grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity (except pulmonary embolism without 
significant hypoxia and hemodynamic instability) will be taken off treatment  permanently. 
Patients with intolerable or limiting toxicity followi ng two successive dose reductions will be 
removed from treatment.  Unacceptable toxicities that have not resolved at time of “off 
treatment” must be followed until stabilization or resolution , at which time they will continue in 
follow up for survival .

3.4.4 Dosing Delays/Dose Modifications  for Specific Toxicities:  
3.4.4.1  Dermatologic Toxicities:  
Rash/dry skin: In patients experiencing grade 2 sk in rash or grade 3 dry skin (there is no grade 4 
for dry skin), sorafenib will be held for 1-2 weeks (until rash less than gr ade 2, dry skin  less than 
grade 3) and will be restarted at the same dose after the first occurrence.  Sorafenib will be 
reduced to dose level -1 after a second occurrence and dose level -2 after a third  occurrence. 
Treatment will be discontinued and the patient taken off treatment  if the  patient does not improve 
from a previous episode or has a fourth occurrence in  spite of dose reductions.   In patients 
experiencing grade ≥3 rash, dose reduction will begin with the first occurrence, and treatment 
will be discont inued and the patient taken off treatment  if the patient does not improve from a 
previous episode or has a second occurrence.  
Hand/f oot skin reaction: In patients expe riencing grade 2 hand/foot skin reaction, sorafenib  will 
be held for 1 -2 weeks (unti l skin reaction less than grade 2) and will be restarted at the same dose 
after the first occurrence.  The dose of sorafenib  will be reduced dose level -1 after the second 
occurrence and to dose level -2 after the third occurrence.  Treatment will be discont inued and 
the patient taken off treatment if the patient does not improve from a previous episode or has a 
fourth  occurrence.  However,  if a patient has had a dose reduction of sorafenib for toxicity and 
tolerates this dose for 28 days, the sorafenib may be re- escalated by one dose- level only, as per 
standard clinical practice.  TRC105  may be continue d throughout the episode at the discre tion of 
the PI, and its dose will not be reduced.  
3.4.4.2  Hypertension:  
Whilst hypertension is a potential side -effect of TRC105 this has not been seen so far in the 
phase I study.  On the other hand, this is a well -established side- effect of sorafenib.  Therefor e, 
in the event of hypertension dose modifications will be made for sorafenib.  
Treatment and dose modification guidelines 
for sorafenib - induced hypertension:  Grade of Event Management/ Next Dose

Treatment and dose modification guidelines 
for sorafenib - induced hypertension:  Grade of Event Management/ Next Dose  
** Patients requiring > 2 dose reductions should go off protocol therapy.  
Grade 1: asymptomatic, transient (<  24 hours) increase by > 20 mmHg (diastolic)  or to >150/100 if 
previously WNL; intervention not indicated . 
Grade 2: recurrent or persistent (> 24 hours) or symptomatic increase by > 20  mmHg (diastolic) or to > 
150/100 if previously WNL . 
Grade 3: requiring more than one drug or more intensive therapy than previously,  including increasing 
dose of antihypertensive medication . 
Grade 4: life threatening (e.g. hypertensive crisis)  
3.4.4.3  Nausea/ Vomiting:  
Grade 3 nausea and grade 3 vomiting will only require  dose modifi cation if it is refractory to 
antiemetic therapy.  In the case of refractory nausea/vomiting and grade 4 nausea or vomiting, 
sorafenib  and TRC105  will be held until toxicities resolve to ≤grade 2 nausea and/or ≤grade 1 
vomiting, and then the dose of sorafenib  will be reduced by one dose level.  
3.4.4.4  Diarrhea:  
Grade 3 diarrhea will only require dose modification if it is  refractory to treatment .  In the case 
of grade 3 diarrhea, sorafenib  will b e held unti l diarrhea resolves to ≤grade 2 diarrhea.  Sorafenib 
will be reintroduced at the same dose unless the diarrhea is refractory to therapy in which case 
the dose of sorafenib will be reduced one dose level.  TRC105  may be continued throughout the 
episode, and TRC105 dose will not be reduced.  All patients will be carefully monitored for 
gastrointestinal adverse events.  
3.4.4.5  Electrolyte abnormalities:  
Grade 3 or greater hypokalemia,  hypophosphatemia, or hypomagnesemia will requir e dose 
modification only if not correctable with oral or IV replacement therapy within 48 hou rs.  If the 
abnormality fails to correct to ≤grade 2 after ≤ 48 hours sorafenib  and TRC105 will be held until 
the electrolyte abnormality resolves to ≤grade 2, and th en the dose of both medications will be 
reduced by one dose level.  
Grade 3 or greater hyponatremia will requir e dose modification only  if not correctable within 24 
hours by the administra tion of intravenous 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (0.9% NaCl Inj.).  If 
the abnormalit y fails to correct to ≤ grade 2 after ≤ 24 hours of IV 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection (0.9% NaCl Inj.), sorafenib and TRC105 will be held until the electrolyte abnormality 
resolves to ≤ grade  2, and then the dose of both medications will be reduced by one dose level.  
3.4.4.6  Transaminase abnormalities:  
Grade 3 elevation in transaminases will only require a therapy introduction a nd dose 
modification if they are also ≥ 1.5 times the baseline level. (This is because patients with Grade 2 
transaminase levels are eligible for study entry.)

Patients who experience grade 3 elevation (+ ≥ 1.5x baseline) in transaminases will have them 
rechecked within 96 hours to ensure that they are trending down following interruption of 
sorafenib. 
3.4.4.7  Uric acid:  
No dose modification will be necessary for any grade of  hyperuricemia without physiologic 
consequences.  
3.4.4.8  Glucose:  
Grade 3 or greater hyperglycem ia or hypoglycemia will require dose  modification only if 
believed to be probably related to study medication(s).  
3.4.4.9  Hematologic abnormalities:  
Grade 3 or hi gher leucopenia (excluding lymphopenia) , neutropenia or thrombocytopenia will 
require dose modificati on of sorafenib alone, the dose of TRC105 will be maintained.  
3.4.4.10 Proteinuria : 
Proteinuria, as demonstrated by a 24 hour protein of ≥ 2000 mg.  Urine protein will be 
screened by urine protein -creatinine ratio (UPC).  For UPC ratio > 1.0, a 24 -hour urine 
prote in will need to be obtained and the level should be < 2000 mg for patient enrollment.

3.5 CORRELATIVE STUDIES FOR RESEARCH /PHARMACOKINETIC STUDIES  
The correlative studies which we wish  to perform are outlined below and summarized in the 
table.  All blood and urine samples will be sent to Dr Figg’s laboratory for initial handling and 
processing, before being forwarded to the appropriate lab as indicated.  Tumor tissue will be 
handled by NCI Tissue Core.  
3.5.1 Molecular characterization of HCC using tumor tissue, blood and urine (Xin Wang lab):  
3.5.1.1  Description  
Investigators at the NCI have played a leading role in the molecular characterization of HCC36, 
37.  The heterogeneous nature of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and the lack of appropriate 
biomarkers have hampered patient prognosis and treatment stratification.  Yamashita et al. have identified that a hepatic stem cell marker, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM), which 
may serve as an early biomarker of HCC because its expression is highly elevated in 
premalignant hepatic tissues and in a subset of fully developed HCC. The same investigators 
have also identified novel HCC subtypes that resemble certain stages of liver lineages by searching for EpCAM -coexpressed genes. A unique signature of EpCAM -positive HCCs was 
identified by cDNA microarray analysis of 40 HCC cases and validated by oligonucleotide microarray analysis of 238 independent HCC cases, w hich was further confirmed by 
immunohistochemical analysis of an additional 101 HCC cases. EpCAM -positive HCC was 
found to display a distinct molecular signature with features of hepatic progenitor cells including 
the presence of known stem/progenitor markers such as cytokeratin 19, c- Kit, EpCAM, and 
activated Wnt -beta-catenin signaling, whereas EpCAM -negative HCC displayed genes with 
features of mature hepatocytes. Moreover, EpCAM -positive and EpCAM -negative HCC could 
be further subclassified into four groups with prognostic implication by determining the level of alpha -fetoprotein (AFP). These four subtypes displayed distinct gene expression patterns with 
features resembling certain stages of hepatic lineages.  
This information holds the promise of an easy  classification system defined by EpCAM status 
and AFP to reveal HCC subtypes similar to hepatic cell maturation lineages, which may enable prognostic stratification and assessment of HCC patients in addition to providing new insights 
into the potential ce llular origin of HCC and its activated molecular pathways.  
In order to perform this molecular analysis we will attempt to perform a baseline tumor biopsy. We will also attempt to perform a post -therapy biopsy at 2 months.  This biopsy will be 
performed to assess CD105 staining by IHC.  Molecular analysis will also be performed on this post-therapy sample by the Wang lab to identify any altered gene expression profile. Both 
biopsies are voluntary.  
3.5.1.2  Timing of Tumor Biopsies  (Optional) :  
Biopsies will be perfo rmed at the following time points :  
• At baseline i.e. after consent, prior to treatment.  
• During week 8 of therapy.

3.5.1.3  Biopsy Procedure:  
The tumor biopsy will be obtained through Interventional Radiology by a percutaneous 
approach.  Location of the biopsy with in tumor will be recorded.  A maximum of 2 core biopsies 
18-gauge in diameter and at least 1 cm in length will be obtained at each time point.  Only 
percutaneous biopsies will be performed on patients with solid tumors.  It is estimated that there 
will be between 2 to 5 million cells from each biopsy.  If a site is deemed appropriate for biopsy 
with minimal risk to the participant by agreement between the investigators and Interventional Radiology, an attempt at biopsy will be made.  The use of imaging to facilitate biopsies will be 
decided by members of the Interventional Radiology team and may include ultrasound, CT scan, 
or MRI.  Should CT scan be needed for biopsy, the number of scans for each procedure will be 
limited to the minimum number needed to saf ely obtain a biopsy.  Tumor biopsies will be 
performed under local anesthesia and conscious sedation only if they are considered to be of low risk to the participant as determined by the investigators and Interventional Radiology.   
All cases will be caref ully reviewed with the interventional radiologists who have extensive 
experience in performing such procedures.  Only if the procedure is considered to be low risk then we will proceed with tumor biopsy in a given participant.  If the attempt is unsuccessf ul, the 
patient will still be eligible for treatment.  If a patient declines biopsy he/she will still be eligible for study.  
3.5.1.4  Sample Analysis:  
If two cores are obtained at each biopsy time point, they will be handled as follows:  
1) One core will be flash froze n and shipped on dry ice to Dr . Xin Wang’s laboratory for 
molecular characterization : 
2) The other core (or half of a core if only one is obtained will be divided in two) will be  fixed 
in 10% formalin and submitted to Surgical Pathology, CCR/NCI (Bldg 10, 2N212) and for 
routine diagnostics.  The specimens will have routine H&E stains (including CD105) made as well as 5 additional unstained sections.  
3.5.1.5  Tumor tissue analysis at Dr . Wang’s lab: Gene expression analysis:  
1) Fresh -frozen tissue will be cut into serial 8μm sections  
2) Microdissect tissue into tumor and non -tumor tissue, using laser -captured microdissection 
(LCM). A pathologist will help with the procedure. The equipment for LCM is provided by 
the NCI core facility.  
3) Isolate, amplify and label RNA, using existing protocols. Currently, our laboratory uses a QIAGEN protocol for the isolation of total RNA from microdissected tissue and the small 
sample labeling protocol by Affymetrix to produce biotin -labeled cRNA.  
4) Hybridize cRNA onto the Affymetrix GeneChip Plu s 2 arrays (gene expression)  
5) Array quality assessment will include array image inspection and in -house software 
packages developed by our bioinformatics staff  
6) Data analysis will be performed at Dr. Wang’s laboratory

3.5.1.6  Collection of non -tumor tissue (blood, urine and mouthwash samples) for analysis in the 
Wang laboratory:  
We will collect blood (or mouth wash), urine and tissue specimens. The collected blood (or 
mouth wash) will be used for the analysis of genotypes, single nucleotide polymorphisms, 
methylation  status, and the measurement of cytokine and microRNA concentrations in serum and 
plasma.  Urine samples are collected to study the association between metabolites in the liver and 
risk or progression of the disease.  The tissue specimens are collected for  whole -genome gene 
expression analysis and the preparation of tissue arrays for immunohistochemical analysis of protein expression.  All non- tumor tissue samples will be initially collected and handled by the 
Figg laboratory and assigned a study ID number.  Personal identifiers will not be used on stored 
research samples.   
Genotyping will be performed from whole blood or buffy coat. The genotyping will be performed at the NCI Core Genotyping Facility using a global standard platform (currently, the 
HumanOm niExpress chip) which covers over 700K single nucleotude variants or through 
targeted Taqman assays based on genes of interest found in our gene expression analysis 
described elsewhere in this protocol.  Data will be analyzed and streamlined strictly for t he 
purposes of the research aim(s) and results will not be shared with the patient.  Since samples are de-identified, researchers analyzing the data will be blind to the patient identifiers.  Thus, any 
additional findings that are incidental to the study w ill not be available to, nor benefit the patient 
whose sample was studied.   
3.5.1.6.1  Procedures for collection of blood (or MOUTH WASH) and urine  
Protocol for blood collection : 
1. Collect about 35cc of blood from each patient.  35cc of blood will be collected and div ided

(1:1) and centrifuged followed by processing by MS -based mass spectrometry in both 
positive and negative -ion mode.   
2) Quality will be assessed using control samples including pooled samples, blanks, duplicates 
and endogenous “spike -ins”. 
3) Data analysis will be performed at the Dr. Wang’s lab.  
3.5.7 Genotyping for SNPs in angiogenesis -related genes (eg VEGFR)  (Figg lab):  
3.5.7.1  Description  
Of particular interest in studies evaluat ing anti -angiogenic agents in various cancers has been  the 
finding (albeit often in an exploratory post -hoc analysis) of an improved median survival for 
those patients who experienced hypertension.  For example in a randomized phase II study of axitinib (a n inhibitor of VEGFR) in pancreatic cancer those who experienced a single incident of 
diastolic hypertension  (>90mm HG) during treatment visits had an improved median survival 
compared to those who also received the combination treatment but who didn’t experience any 
recorded hypertension (13.0m [95% CI 8.5 – 16.6] v 5.6m [95% CI 4.8 – 7.2])
38.  This 
association between the onset of hypertension and improved therapeutic outcomes with anti -
angiogenic or anti -VEGF agen ts has also been found in other diseases and studies39-41. It is 
unclear whether the attainment of hypertension is a surrogate biomarker for those patients who would benefit from anti- VEGF therapy or indeed if it is  a marker of efficacy that should be 
strived for. It appears that the former is more likely to be the case based on an analysis of patient tumor blocks from a study in breast cancer comparing paclitaxel with or without bevacizumab. 
In this study there was an association found between VEGF  genotype and median
 overall 
survival as well as grade 3 or 4 hypertension41, 42.  Although the DNA evaluated in this study was

derived from the primary tumor, it was host variabilit y that was being evaluated, which is an 
important difference from other biomarkers, for example EGFR or KRAS mutations, which are 
tumor - related.  Because angiogenesis is a host -mediated process, germline genetic variability 
may be an important contributor  to the heterogeneity of response seen and this variability has the 
potential to be used for better selection of patients for future studies evaluating anti -VEGF 
agents43.  
3.5.7.2  Procedure:  
A single blood tes t will be performed at baseline (after consent, prior to treatment initiation).  
One 6ml EDTA tube  (BD, Franklin Lakes , NJ) will be collected from patients.  
1. Immediately after collection, invert the blood tube 8 -10 times. P lace the tube on  wet ice 
and then r efrigerate. The date and exact  time of each blood draw should be recorded on 
the tube.

Processing Core (BPC) i n 10/5A09 at 301-402- 3622 or 301-594- 6131 with any questio ns. 
Genomic DNA will be analyzed for polymorphisms in angiogenesis -related genes. Genotyping 
will be performed by sequencing analysis, RFLP or gene array analysis.  
3.5.8 Circulating endothelial cells (CECs), Circulating endothelial progenitor (CEP) cells, plasma  levels of angiogenic factors, soluble CD105 (baseline)  and Rat aortic ring 
bioassay.  
3.5.8.1  Brief description of background and rationale for performing this test:  
1. Both TRC105 and sorafenib inhibit  angiogenesis and tumor growth.  However, there are 
no current human clinical data to support such biological activity  in TRC105. 
2. Consistent fluctuations in  plasma VEGF and PlGF (placenta- derived growth factor), as 
well as in CEC’s and CEP’s have been detected following an array of anti -angiogenic 
therapies, incl uding the anti -VEGF antibody bevacizumab, VEGFR2 inhibitors, and their 
combinations in clinical studies.   
3. Such analysis in this study would provide the necessary support for the putative 
mechanism of action of the agent under investigation.  
4. Given the mechanism of TRC105 it is possible that efficacy is related to baseline soluble 
CD105. 
3.5.8.2   Implementation:  
3.5.8.2.1  CEPs and CECs  (Jane Trepel lab ):  
Two 7cc EDTA lavender tubes  will be drawn for analysis of circulating endothelial 
progenitor cells (CEP) and mature ci rculating endothelial cells (CEC). Samples will be 
collected from patients at 30 min prior to dose on cycle 1 day 1, cycle 1 day 15 and cycle 
2 day 15.

The plasma will be  transferred to Dr. Cao’s lab at Bldg 37, Rm. 6134 in batches (tel: 301-
435-9039). Plasma levels of angiogenic factors will be performed for VEGF, PlGF, bFGF 
and sVEGFR1 (soluble VEGF receptor 1).    The analysis will be done with assays 
developed on electr ochemiluminescence platform that provides ultra -high sensitivity and 
very large signal dynamic range.    Purified protein standard will be used for generating 
standard curves for concentration determination.  Data analysis will be performed with 
Prism (Grap hPad, San Diego, CA) to determine the medium value, interquartile range, 
and P value in paired t test.   If the induction of VEGF and PlGF can be observed, 
correlative studies will be performed between the induced levels of angiogenic factors and the dose l evels of TRC105 in the phase I combination segment of the trial.  In the 
phase II study, when the responses can be established, correlative studies will be performed between the initial levels of the angiogenic factors, or the degree of their 
induction with  the clinical responses.   
3.5.8.2.3  Soluble CD105 (Seon Lab) :  
A 5mL K

3.5.10  Fc receptor polymorphisms  (Jane Trepel lab)  
Genotyping of CD16a will be performed using a TaqMan  SNP probe assay.  The assay contains 
two primers for amplifying the  sequence of interest and two TaqMan MGB (minor groove 
binding) probes for detecting specific alleles.  The genotyping assay determines the presence or 
absence of a SNP based on the change in fluorescence of the dyes associated with the probes.  
Pre-design ed TaqMan SNP genotyping assays from the Applied Biosystems database 
(http://www.appliedbiosystems.com ) will be used for rs396991, the relevant SNP of interest on 
CD16a (amino acid 158, V/F).   
 Peripheral blood will be collected in one lavender top tube on C1D1 pre -therapy.  DNA will be 
isolated using the Qiagen Blood DNA isolation kit, and quantified using NanoDrop instrumentation.  For each DNA sample PCR amplification will be performed using the TaqMan
 
SNP probe assay  reagents.  After PCR amplification an endpoint plate read on an ABI 7500 
instrument will be performed and analyzed using SDS software provided by Applied 
Biosystems.  The results of the allelic discrimination assay will be displayed as a scatter plot of 
the fluorescence intensity of allele 1 versus allele 2.  
3.5.11  Immunogenicity Testing  (Tracon) :

3.5.12.1 Description  
Non-immune based therapies have been shown to have significant effects on tum or-specific 
immune responses.  While it was always a general believe that chemotherapy impairs immune 
responses in patients with cancer, there is increasing evidence demonstrating that under certain 
circumstances chemotherapy might have potential beneficia ry effects on tumor specific immune 
responses
45.  Until today the mechanism of how chemotherapy might support immune responses 
remains unclear.  While it has been shown in different mouse models that chemotherapy induced 
cell death supports T cell priming through cross -priming46 others have  been able to demonstrate 
an effect of targeted therapies on different immune suppressor mechanisms including regulatory T cells as wells as MDSCs.  Sunitinib has been shown to impair both, the function of regulatory 
T cells as well as MDSCs
47, 48.  Although the direct mechanism remains unclear how sunitinib 
impairs MDSCs and Treg function.  Previ ous studies have shown that VEGF  plays a major role 
in abnormal dendritic cell differentiation and function in cancer.  It has been proposed that 
inhibition of VEGF may result in improved immune responses  and that anti -VEGF based 
therapies improve immune responses in patients with cancer.  
In this study we plan to monitor immune effector function in detail.  For this PBMC wil l be 
analyzed from patients prior to first treatment and 4 and 10 weeks after initiation.  Blood will be 
collected and processed by the Figg lab and frozen until later analysis.  Frequency, phenotype and function of different immune cells (including B cells, CD8+ T cells, CD4+ T cells, NK cells, 
NKT cells, myeloid DCs, Macrophages, Monocytes, Tregs and MDSCs) will be analyzed in Dr. 
Greten’s laboratory.  
Peripheral blood will be collected in one 60cc heparinized syringe and stored at room temperature. The da te and exact  time of each blood draw should be recorded on the blood tubes.

3.6 IMAGING STUDIES  
An attempt will be made to perform all correlative imaging studies in accordance with the 
schedule ; however, given scheduling issues and unforeseen circumstances which may result in 
treatment delays and patient inconvenience, these tests will be optional.  
3.6.1 Dynamic Contrast Enhanced – Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE -MRI)  
3.6.1.1  Description  
Dynamic Contrast Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( DCE -MRI) has been used 
extensively with novel antiangiogenic agents in phase I and II trials  to monitor their effect on 
tumor vasculature through parameters reflecting both tumor perfusion and permeability. This 
protocol is limited to DCE -MRI using T1 weig hted studies with low molecular weight 
gadolinium (Gd) chelates.  Other MRI techniques (which are not covered by this protocol) 
include the following:  DCE -MRI using T2* weighted images; contrast -enhanced MR with high 
molecular weight contrast agents; and non-contrast enhanced MRI techniques such as diffusion -
weighted MRI, T2* weighted MRI or BOLD.  
DCE -MRI studies will be interpreted by Dr. Peter Choyke, MD, Chief, NCI Molecular Imaging 
Department, 301.435.4046, 10/1B40.  Other members of the clinical imaging program may 
contact Dr. Choyke for information purposes regarding the imaging protocol and data capture methodology.  
3.6.1.2  DCE -MRI End Points   
• The primary end points of these DCE -MRI studies are the Initial Area Under the Gd 
Curve measured over 60 seconds (IA UC60) and the Transport Constant (K
trans). 
• IAUC  (initial area under the gadolinium concentration time curve) . 
• Transport Constant (Ktrans). 
• Both Ktrans and IAUC60 require calculation of instantaneous tumor Gd concentration 
based on the change in relaxivity due to contrast uptake ΔR1.  The basic requirements 
for these calculations are:  
o An estimate of contrast agent relaxivity in tumor vasculature and tissue  
52 
Abbreviated Title:  Sorafenib and TRC105 in HCC  
NCI Protocol #:  11-C-0102  
Version Date:  June 10, 2016  
Amendment:  N 
o Measurement of tumor T1 immediately prior to contrast uptake  
o An accurate T1 measurement method verified  for all spatial locations, 
coils and scanners used  
o Cardiac output (or arterial input function) for Ktrans (population based      
estimates may be appropriate)  
o Reproducible injection (ideally power injector)  
• All data including ROI definition and analysis s hould be recorded and traceable to 
support external review.  
• Additional end points may be generated at a study / protocol level in addition to these 
primary end points.  The production of the primary DCE -MRI end points for 
comparison between studies does no t preclude other end points within studies such as 
parametric maps of IAUC/Ktrans, blood volume (Vb), extravascular space (Ve), Kep (a 
function of Ktrans and Ve), etc.  
3.6.1.3  Tumor Type and Location  
• Lesions within the lung  are excluded from DCE -MRI studies due to “breathing” 
artifacts which make image data difficult to analyze reliably.  
• Recommendations for lesion selection:  
- Exclude lung lesions.  
- If possible, exclude lesions in close proximity to the heart or major 
vascular structures  
- If possible, choose lesions t owards the center of the image volume.  
- If possible, choose lesions towards the center of the image plane.  
- Lesions should be at least 1.5 cm and preferably > 2 cm in longest in plane 
diameter   
- Lesions preferably should be < 7 cm in the z plane [the entire            
lesion(s) should be within the volume scanned].  
- Lesions should be well defined on standard CT or MR imaging.  
3.6.1.4  Schedule of DCE -MRI Assessments  
• The use of DCE -MRI to assess tumor vascular factor parameters is exploratory is 
nature.  When possible, p atients enrolled into the phase II portion of the study will be 
selected for enrollment based on appropriate lesions for pharmacodynamic imaging 
with planned DCE -MRI scans.   
• DCE -MRI scans should be obtained:  
- Prior to treatment (preferably within 7 days of  treatment start)  
- 24-36 hours after Cycle 1 Day 1   
- 28 +/ - 2 days after Cycle 1 Day 1  
- Further follow -up scans, depending on the study design 
3.6.1.5  Data to be collected  
• The following information on a per patient basis should be supplied to the NCI with 
the final  study manuscript.  
- Study identifier (NCI protocol number)

i. In the event of more than 1 variceal bleeding event during the phase I part of the study or 
more than 2 variceal bleeding events in the phase II part the study, the study will be 
suspended pending full investigation of the bleeding cause.  
ii. In the event of 1 other major bleeding complication (CTC grade 3), apart from variceal hemorrhage, during the phase I part or more than 2 bleeding events in the phase II part 
the study, the study will be suspended pending full investigation of the bleeding cause.  
iii. A screening log will be initiated to identify those in/exclusion criteria, which are most 
likely hindering patients to  enroll into the studies.  This log will not only help us for the 
design of other future trials, but we can also use it to evaluate if we need to amend the protocol to allow for a better (but still safe, accrual).  Should we notice that not enough 
patients  are referred to NCI, we will open a second center at a location outside of the 
Washington/Baltimore area, possibly at Memorial Sloan -Kettering Cancer Center  or 
Harvard.  
4 SUPPORTIVE CARE  
Patients will receive appropriate supportive care medications at the investigator's discretion.  See 
section  3.4 for management of specific toxicities.  
5 DATA COLLECTION AND EVALUATION

Loss or destruction of data: Should we become aware that a major breech in our plan to protect 
subject confidentiality and trial data has occurred, the IRB will be notified. 
5.2 R
ESPONSE CRITERIA  
Re-staging CT scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis will be required every two months of 
treatment.  Confirmatory scans should also be obtained 4 weeks following initial documentation 
of objective response (CR or PR)  
Objective response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international 
criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee 
[Eisenhauer EA, et al. New response evaluation criteria in solid tumours: Revised RECIST 
guideline (version 1.1) 2009; Eur J Ca 45:228-247]. 
Note:  Lesions are either measurable or non -measurable using the criteria provided below.   The 
term “evaluable” in reference to measurability will not be used because it does not provide 
additional meaning o r accuracy.  
5.2.1 Response Criteria for Radiographic Studies  
5.2.1.1  Measuring of Soft Tissue Disease  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline 
(version 1.1) [ Eur J Ca  45:228- 247, 2009] as well as – in an exploratory fashion as a secondary 
endpoint – the EASL -modified RECIST criteria (Lencioni and LLovet Semin Liv dis 2010). 
Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement ) of the tumor lesions and the 
shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.  
a. Evaluation of Target Lesions  
  Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all target lesions.  Any pathological lymph nodes (whether targe t or 
non-target) must have reduction in short axis to <10 mm  
  Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters  
  Progressive Disease (PD)  
59 
Abbreviated Title:  Sorafenib and TRC105 in HCC  
NCI Protocol #:  11-C-0102  
Version Date:  June 10, 2016  
Amendment:  N 
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also 
demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or 
more new lesions is also considered progressions)  
  Stable Disease (SD)  
 Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for 
PD, taking as reference the smallest sum  of diameters while on study  
b. Evaluation of Non -Target Lesions  
  Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level.  All 
lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size (<10 mm short axis)  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they must 
normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response. 
  Non-CR/Non -PD (Stable Disease, SD)  
Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker 
level above the normal limits . 
  Progressive Disease (PD)  
Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing 
non-target lesions. Unequivocal progression should not normally trump target lesion 
status.  It must be representative of overall disease status change, not a single lesion 
increase.     
 Although a clear progression of “non -target” lesions only is exceptional, the opinion 
of the treating physician should prevail in such circumstances, and the progression 
status should be  confirmed at a later time by the review panel (or Principal 
Investigator).  
c. Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
 The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment 
until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and 
confirmation criteria.

      **Only for non -randomize d trials with response as primary endpoint.  
      ***In exceptional circumstances, unequivocal progression in non -target lesions may be accepted 
as disease progression  
 
 
d. Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of 
treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be 
reported as “ symptomatic deterioration.”   Every effort should be made to document 
the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
e. In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal 
tissue.  When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is 
recommended that the residual lesions be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) 
before confirming the complete response status.  
5.2.1.2  Confirmatory Measurement/Duration of Response  
a. Confirmation  
To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be  
confirmed by repeat assessments that should be performed at least 4 weeks after the 
criteria for r esponse are first met.

NCI Protocol #:  11-C-0102  
Version Date:  June 10, 2016  
Amendment:  N 
b. Duration of Overall Response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are 
met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or 
progressive disease is objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive 
disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started).  
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that progressive disease is objectively documented.  
5.2.1.3  Measurable Disease  
Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest x -ray, as >10 mm with CT 
scan, or >10 mm with calip ers by clinical exam.  All tumor measurements must be recorded in 
millimeters  (or decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Note:  Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered measurable.  If the investigator th inks it appropriate to include them, the conditions 
under which such lesions should be considered must be defined in the protocol . 
5.2.1.4  Malignant Lymph Nodes  
To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node must be >20 mm in 
short axis whe n assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater 
than 5 mm).  At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and followed.  
5.2.1.5  Non-Measurable Disease  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesion s (longest diameter <10 mm or 
pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis), are considered non- measurable 
disease.  Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, 
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast  disease, and abdominal masses (not followed 
by CT or MRI), are considered as non -measurable.  
Note:  Cystic lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not 
be considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non -measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cysts.  
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable lesions, 
if they meet the definition of measurability described above. However, if non -cystic lesions are 
presen t in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target lesions.  
5.2.1.6  Target Lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those 
that lend themselves to reproducible repeated  measurements.  It may be the case that, on 
occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected.  A

sum of the diameters (longest for non -nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters.  If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then only the short axis is added into the sum.  The baseline sum diam eters 
will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease.  
Progressive disease by RECIST criteria [1] noted after the first re- staging scan  may represent 
disease that was not detected on the pre -study scan, and a confirmatory scan will be required at 
the next scheduled re-staging evaluation  unless clinically not indicated.  If confirmed, 
progression should be dated by the initial time when the les ions are first detected. If progressive 
disease by RECIST criteria is seen  after cycle 2, but no t confirmed on subsequent restaging scan, 
the scans from after cycle 2 would serve as the baseline scan to evaluate for disease progression,  
(ref: Scher, HI et al. J Clin Onc, 26 (7), 2008)  
5.2.1.7  Non-Targe t Lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 target lesions should be identified as non- target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. 
Measurements of these lesions are not required, but the presence, absence, or in rare cases unequivocal progression of each should be noted throughout follow -up.  
5.2.1.8  Metastatic Bone Lesions  
Disease progression is considered if a minimum of two new lesions is observed on bone scan. 
New lesions seen by the end of  cycle 2 or before cycle 3 ( with the first re-staging bone scan) 
may represent disease that was not detected on the pre- study scan, and a confirmatory scan will 
be required at the next scheduled re-staging bone scan unless clinically not indicated.  If 
confirmed, progression should be dated by the initial time when the lesions are first detected. If 
new lesions are seen after cycle 2, but no additional lesions are seen on confirmatory scans, the 
scans from post-cycle 2 would serve as the baseline scan to evaluate for disease progression,  
(ref: Scher, HI et al. J Clin Onc, 26 (7), 2008)  
5.2.1.9  Clinical Lesions  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules 
and palpable lymph nodes) and ≥10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules).  
In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the 
size of the lesion, is recommended.  
5.2.1.10  Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment a nd the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging- based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be imaged but are assessable by clinical exam.

5.2.1.11  Methods of Measurement  
Chest X -ray - Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
CT and MRI - CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure 
target lesions selected for response assessment. For this study helical Multi -detector CT will be 
performed with cuts of 5 mm in slice thickness for chest, abdomen and pelvis lesions and 2-3 
mm thi ckness for head and neck lesions.  
5.2.2 EASL -modified RECIST criteria.  
5.2.2.1  Background 
The Amercian Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) convened an expert panel to reach consensus on issues relating to trial design in HCC, a particular challenge given the almost 
invariable existence of underlying cirrhosis
49.  A number of recomendations were made 
including:  
• The Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer Staging System (BCLCS) was recommeded for 
selection of the target population in an effort to standardise inclusion criteria and make 
data interpretation easier.  
• For phase II studies the panel recommended a randomized design with a time- to-event 
endpoint, such as time to tumor progression (TTP).  This is in place of a composit e 
endpoint, such as progression -free survival, which may be influenced by the underlying 
cirrhosis and mask any potential anti -cancer efficacy of the drug.  
• The use of smarter correlative endpoints which better reflect the mechanistic effect of the 
investi gational agent can also be useful, especially given the lack of randomized studies 
in this disease.  
• The AASLD panel also recommended that new agents be tested in patients with well -
preserved liver function (Child -Pugh Class A).  
In addition, t he panel add ressed the deficiencies in the standard RECIST criteria  as they apply to 
HCC, particularly  in the era of molecular therapies where changes in tumor viability, as 
determined by contrast -enhanced techniques, are important.  This is especially relevant given t he 
vascularity of HCC.  Certain amendments to the RECIST criteria were therefore proposed which 
are centred on the concept of measuring viable tumor, defined as the uptake of contrast agent in 
the arterial phase of dynamic CT or MRI.  These EASL -modified RE CIST criteria will used to 
evaluate response as a secondary endpoint of this study.  
The mRECIST for HCC has introduced the following amendments to RECIST in the determination of tumor response for target lesions:
 
• Complete response: the disappearance of any  intratumoral arterial enhancement in all 
target lesions  
• Partial response: at least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of viable (contrast enhancement in the arterial phase) target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of 
the diameters of targe t lesions  
64 
Abbreviated Title:  Sorafenib and TRC105 in HCC  
NCI Protocol #:  11-C-0102  
Version Date:  June 10, 2016  
Amendment:  N 
• Progressive disease: an increase of at least 20% in the sum of the diameters of viable 
(enhancing) target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters of viable 
(enhancing) target lesions recorded since the treatment started  
• Stable disease: any cases that do not qualify for either partial response or progressive 
disease  
The measurement of the longest diameter of the viable tumor may be challenging in lesions showing partial internal necrosis. The following points should be taken into account in such 
cases:
 
• The measurement of the viable tumor should be performed on CT or MRI obtained in the 
arterial phase, when the contrast between viable vascularized tumor tissue and 
nonenhancing necrotic tissue is the highest.  
• The longest diamete r of the viable tumor is not necessarily located in the same scan plane 
in which the baseline diameter was measured: a thorough careful evaluation of the CT or 
MRI scans is required.  
• The measurement of the viable tumor diameter should not include any major  intervening 
areas of necrosis.  
5.2.2.2  NONTARGET LESIONS RESPONSE  
The RECIST guideline provides the following definitions of the criteria used to determine the objective tumor response for nontarget lesions: complete response is the disappearance of all 
nontarget  lesions; incomplete response/stable disease is the persistence of one or more nontarget 
lesions; and progressive disease is the appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing nontarget lesions.  
According to mRECIST for HC C, tumor necrosis should be taken into account when assessing 
the response of nontarget lesions. The disappearance of intratumoral arterial enhancement in nontarget lesions should be considered equivalent to the disappearance of nontarget lesions, and 
therefore, should declare complete response of nontarget lesions. The persistence of intratumoral 
arterial enhancement in one or more nontarget lesions should be considered equivalent to persistence of one or more nontarget lesions, and therefore, should declare incomplete response / 
stable disease. The appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of 
existing nontarget lesions should declare progressive disease.  
Special recommendations for the assessment of tumor response in nontarget le sions in patients 
with HCC and cirrhosis can be made regarding the following points:  
1. Portal vein thrombosis. Malignant portal vein thrombosis should be considered a 
nonmeasurable lesion due to the difficulty in performing consistent measurements of the 
malignant thrombus during the course of the treatment. Measurements of the extent of the 
malignant thrombus may be impaired by the possible presence of a bland component of the thrombosis.

NCI Protocol #:  11-C-0102  
Version Date:  June 10, 2016  
Amendment:  N 
2. Porta hepatis lymph node. Lymph nodes detected at the portal hepatis can be considered 
as malignant if the lymph node short axis is at least 20 mm. Evidence of reactive lymph 
nodes at the porta hepatis, in fact, is a common finding in patients with cirrhosis 
regardless of the presence of an HCC. The short axis of the node is  the diameter normally 
used by radiologists to judge if a node is involved by solid tumor.  
3. Pleural effusion and ascites. The original RECIST publication specifies that cytologic 
confirmation of the neoplastic nature of any effusion that appears or worsens during 
treatment is required when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease. Under such circumstances, the cytologic examination of the fluid collected will 
permit differentiation between response or stable disease (an effusion may be a side 
effect of the treatment) and progressive disease (if the neoplastic origin of the fluid is 
confirmed). The mRECIST for HCC panel of experts considered this issue to be of high 
importance in the setting of HCC in cirrhosis. The emergence or the  increase in ascites is 
a common event during the course of treatment in a cirrhotic patient, which may be due 
to worsening of the underlying chronic liver disease and be unrelated to cancer 
progression. Other effusions, such as pleural effusion, may also be unrelated to cancer 
progression and be caused by the liver insufficiency. Thus, the mRECIST for HCC emphasizes that cytopathologic confirmation of the neoplastic nature of any effusion 
(particularly ascites) that appears or worsens during treatment is r equired when the 
measurable tumor has met criteria for response or stable disease. It has to be underlined that peritoneal carcinomatosis is a very rare event in HCC.  
5.2.2.3  NEW LESIONS  
Characterization of a newly detected focal liver lesion as true HCC is a chal lenging issue in the 
setting of cirrhosis because pathologic abnormalities related to cirrhosis changes —such as large 
regenerative nodules and dysplastic nodules —may be indistinguishable from a small tumor. 
Moreover, the clear -cut separation of the hepatic phases of liver enhancement routinely achieved 
by state -of-the-art CT or MRI creates additional problems in a cirrhotic liver, mostly related to 
the presence of perfusion abnormalities resulting in areas of abnormal liver enhancement. In most cases, such perfusion abnormalities are detected as arterially hyperenhancing areas caused 
by a selective impairment of the portal venous feeding. Such perfusion abnormalities may ultimately mimic or conceal focal liver lesions; hence, they represent an additional major source 
for interpretation errors.  
The AASLD practice guideline for the clinical management of HCC has recommended strict criteria for the imaging diagnosis of HCC in cirrhosis. Noninvasive diagnostic criteria of HCC 
can be made without histology in lesi ons of at least 1 cm in diameter showing characteristic 
vascular features of HCC —arterial hypervascularization with washout in the portal venous or the 
late phase— at dynamic imaging studies. For diagnostic purposes, two imaging techniques —CT 
and MRI —are required for such a confirmation in tumors of 1 to 2 cm in diameter, and one 
imaging technique in tumors beyond 2 cm in cirrhotic patients.  
In the assessment of tumor progression, these concepts have been adopted by the mRECIST 
assessment proposal, consideri ng some specificities for the frame of progression mode:  
66 
Abbreviated Title:  Sorafenib and TRC105 in HCC  
NCI Protocol #:  11-C-0102  
Version Date:  June 10, 2016  
Amendment:  N 
• A newly detected hepatic nodule will be classified as HCC —and therefore will be 
declared as evidence of progression —when its longest diameter is at least 1 cm and the 
nodule shows the typical vascula r pattern of HCC on dynamic imaging, that is, 
hypervascularization in the arterial phase with washout in the portal venous or late 
venous phase.  
• Liver lesions larger than 1 cm that do not show a typical vascular pattern can be diagnosed as HCC by evidence of at least 1 -cm-interval growth in subsequent scans.  
• An individual radiologic event will be adjudicated in retrospect as progression at the time it was first detected by imaging techniques, even if strict criteria were fulfilled only on 
subsequent radiolo gic testing.  
5.2.2.4  Overall Response Assessment  
In mRECIST for HCC, identical to conventional RECIST, overall patient response is a result of 
the combined assessment of target lesions, nontarget lesions, and new lesions. It is important to point out that appearan ce of one or more new lesions declares progression whatever the response 
of target and nontarget lesions. Overcalling of equivocal lesions as new HCC, therefore, has a major impact on the outcome of studies with a radiologic endpoint, such as tumor respons e or 
time to progression. Hence, any newly detected focal liver lesion that does not meet the criteria reported above should be considered equivocal and not conclusive for disease progression.

See Section 11.5 
6 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS    
The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the abi lity of a combination of sorafenib and 
TRC105 to improve upon the time to progression of patients with HCC.  
The study will be conducted with both a phase I trial and then a phase II trial.   
6.1 PHASE I PORTION  
In the phase I trial, a conventional 3+3 design was used and requir ed a maximum of 6 patients 
per dose level.

Abbreviated Title:  Sorafenib and TRC105 in HCC  
NCI Protocol #:  11-C-0102  
Version Date:  June 10, 2016  
Amendment:  N 
As of July 24, 2014, we completed accrual to the phase I portion of this study and established a 
recommended phase II dose of TRC -105 15mg/kg every two weeks in combination with 
sorafenib 400mg bid. 
6.2 PHASE II PORTION  
Based upon the largest reported trial of sorafenib in an identical patient population, the median 
time to progression in patients with this disease was shown to be 5.5 months.  Patients enrolled 
on this study will receive scans every  8 weeks.  Thus, the third scan would take place at 
approximately 6 months.  If the median time to progression were 5.5 months, this would be equivalent to having 47% without progression at 6 months.  Thus, the primary endpoint of this 
study will be the pr oportion of patients who are progression -free after 6 months on -study.  
The sample size and interim stopping rule will be determined using a Simon optimal two -stage 
design.  A median 5.5 month time to progression, translating into a 6 month progression fre e 
survival rate of 47%, would be considered not promising (p0=0.47), while a 67%  6- month PFS 
rate (corresponding to a median time to progression of 10.5 months) would be considered 
promising (p1=0.67). With alpha=0.10 and beta=0.10, 21 patients will be accrued to the study in 
the first stage.  
If 10 or fewer patients demonstrate lack of progression on imaging after 6 months (three scans) on-study, the accrual to the study will be terminated early and the trial declared to have a 
negative result.  A pause in the accrual may be necessary to ensure that enrollment may continue to the second stage.  If 11 or more patients are progression -free at 6 months, enrollment will be 
extended to accrue a total of 45 patients.  If 11 -25 have not progressed by 6 months, t his will be 
considered insufficient to warrant further study, while if 26 or more of 45 patients are 
progression -free after their third scan (at 6  months)  the treatment will be declared effective and 
worthy of further testing.  Under the null hypothesis (47% without progression by 6 months), the probability of early termination is 61%.  A Kaplan -Meier curve of progression free survival and 
of survival will also be constructed in addition to evaluating the proportions without progression by the third scan.   
Amendment L, version dated July 31, 2014 : 
Starting with Amendment L version dated July 31, 2014, patients  will be enrolled on the phase II 
portion and will be evaluated according to the language below.  
Results from previous studies suggest that an overa ll response rate for sorafenib alone in this 
patient population was between 2 and 8%. The primary objective of this portion of the trial is to 
establish if the combination of sorafenib and TRC105 is able to be associated with an improved 
overall response r ate. This trial will be conducted using an optimal two- stage phase II trial design 
(Simon R, Controlled Clinical Trials 10:1 -10, 1989) in order to rule out an unacceptably low 
PR+ CR rate of 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of an improved PR + CR rate of 25% (p1=0.25). With 
alpha=0.10 (probability of accepting a poor treatment=0.10) and beta = 0.20 (probability of rejecting a good treatment=0.20) . The first stage will initially enroll 6 evaluable patients, and if 0 
of the 6 have a clinical response, then no further patients will be accrued. If 1 or more of the first 6 patients has a clinical response, then accrual would continue until a total of 23 patients have 
been enrolled. As it may take several weeks to determine if a patient has experienced a response, 
a temporary pause in the accrual may be necessary to ensure that enrollment to the second stage

Amendment:  N 
is warranted. If there are 1 to 2 clinical responses in 23 patients, this would be an uninterestingly 
low response rate. If there were 3 or more complete responses in 23  patients (13.0%), this would 
be sufficiently interesting to warrant further study in later trials. Under the null hypothesis (5% response rate), the probability of early termination is 73.5%.  
6.3 A
CCRUAL AND STUDY DURATION  
This trial has accrued 1 9 patients i n phase I  and no additional patients will be accrued as accrual 
for the phase I portion is complete. An additional 23 patients may be required for the phase II  
portion of the study . Thus, a total of 1 9+23 patients may be needed to complete the accrual for 
this study. In order to allow for the possibility of a small number of inevaluable patients, the 
accrual ceiling will be set at 4 4 patients. If 1 -2 patients are accrued onto this trial per month, 
accrual for the phase II portion is expected to be completed within  1 to 2 years.  
7 HUMAN SUBJECTS PROTE CTIONS  
7.1 RATIONALE FOR SUBJECT SELECTION  
Subjects treated on this study, will be individuals with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma 
(HCC) , which has recurred (or persisted) after appropriate standard treatment.  In dividuals of any 
race or ethnic group will be eligible for this study.  Eligibility assessment will be based solely on the patient’s medical status.  Recruitment of patients onto this study will be through standard 
CCR mechanisms.  No special recruitment efforts will be conducted.  
7.2 P
ARTICIPATION OF CHILDREN  
Individuals under the age of 18 will not be eligible to participate in this study because they are unlikely to have hepatocellular carcinoma, and because of unknown toxicities in pediatric 
patient.  
7.3 E
VALUA TION OF BENEFITS AND RISKS/DISCOMFORTS  
The potential benefit to a patient that goes onto study is a reduction in the bulk of their tumor which may or may not have favorable impact on symptoms and/or survival.  Potential risks 
include the possible occurrence of any of a range of side effects which are listed in the Consent 
Document.  The procedure for protecting against or minimizing risks will be to medically 
evaluate patients on a regular basis as described.  
7.4 R
ISKS/BENEFITS ANALYSIS  
For patients with hepato cellular carcinoma cancer, median survival is in the range of 6 months. 
Potential risks include the possible occurrence of any of a range of side effects listed.  Risk of 
baseline  biops y: All care will be taken to minimize risks that may be incurred by tum or 
sampling.  However, there are procedure -related risks (such as bleeding, infection and visceral 
injury) that will be explained fully during informed consent.   If patients suffer any physical 
injury as a result of the biopsies, immediate medical treatmen t is available at the NIH’s Clinical 
Center in Bethesda, Maryland.  Although no compensation is available, any injury will be fully

evaluated and treated in keeping with the benefits or care to which patients are entitled under 
applicable regulations.  
7.5 CONS ENT PROCESS AND DOCUMENTATION  
Patients will meet with an associate or principal investigator on the trial in the GI oncology  
Clinic, during the initial evaluation for this study.  During that meeting, the investigator will 
inform patients of the  purpose, alternatives, treatment plan, research objectives and follow -up of 
this trial.  The investigator will then provide a copy of the IRB -approved informed consent 
document that is included in this protocol.  The patient will be allowed to take as muc h time as 
he wishes, in deciding whether or not he wishes to participate.  If a prolonged period of time expires during the decision making process (several weeks, as an example), it may be necessary 
to reassess the patient for protocol eligibility. The or iginal signed consent goes to Medical 
Records; copy placed in research record (NIH policy).  
All patients must have a signed informed consent form and an on- study (confirmation of 
eligibility) form filled out and signed by a participating investigator befor e entering on the study.  
7.5.1 Reconsent via Telephone  
The informed consent document will be sent to the subject.  An explanation of the study will be 
provided over the telephone after the subject has had the opportunity to read the consent form.  The subject wi ll sign and date the informed consent. A witness to the subject ’s signaturewill sign 
and date the consent.  
The original informed consent document will be sent back to the consenting investigator who 
will sign and date the consent form with the date the con sent was obtained via telephone.   
A fully executed copy will be returned via mail for the subject’s records.  
The informed consent process will be documented on a progress note by the consenting 
investigator and a copy of the informed consent document and  note will be kept in the subject’s 
research record.  
7.5.2 Informed Consent of non -English Speaking Subjects  
If there is an unexpected enrollment of a research participant for whom there is no translated extant IRB approved consent document, the principal invest igator and/or those authorized to 
obtain informed consent will use the Short Form Oral Consent Process as described in MAS Policy M77 -2, OSHRP SOP 12, 45 CFR 46.117 (b) (2), and 21 CFR 50.27 (b) (2). The summary 
that will be used is the English version of the extant IRB approved consent document.  Signed copies of both the English version of the consent and the translated short form will be given to 
the subject or their legally authorized representative and the signed original will be filed in the 
medical r ecord.  
Unless the PI is fluent in the prospective subject’s language, an interpreter will be present to facilitate the conversation (using either the long translated form or the short form). Preferably 
someone who is independent of the subject (i.e., not a family member) will assist in presenting 
information and obtaining consent. Whenever possible, interpreters will be provided copies of

the relevant consent documents well before the consent conversation with the subject (24 to 48 
hours if possible).  
We r equest prospective IRB approval of the use of the short form process for non -English 
speaking subjects and will notify the IRB at the time of continuing review of the frequency of the 
use of the Short Form.  
8 SAFETY REPORTING REQUIREMENTS/DATA AND S AFETY MON ITORING 
PLAN   
8.1 DEFINITION S 
8.1.1 Adverse Event  
An adverse event is defined as any reaction, side effect, or untoward event that occurs during the course of the clinical trial  associated with the use of a drug in humans , whether or not the event 
is considered rel ated to the treatment or clinically significant. For this study, AEs will include 
events reported by the patient, as well as clinically significant abnormal findings on physical examination or laboratory evaluation. A new illness, symptom, sign or clinically significant 
laboratory abnormality or worsening of a pre -existing condition or abnormality is considered an 
AE.  All AEs must be recorded on the AE case report form . 
All AEs, including clinically significant abnormal findings on laboratory evaluations, regardless 
of severity, will be followed until satisfactory resolution. Serious adverse events that occur more 
than 30 days after the last administration of investigational agent/intervention and have an 
attribution of at least possibly related to the agent/intervention should be recorded and reported 
as per sections 8.2 and 8.3.  
An abnormal laboratory value will be considered an AE if the laboratory abnormality is 
characterized by any of the following:  
• Results in discontinuation from the study 
• Is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• Requires treatment or any other therapeutic intervention  
• Is associated with death or another serious adverse event, including hosp italization.  
• Is judged by the Investigator to be of significant clinical impact  
• If any abnormal laboratory result is considered clinically significant, the investigator will provide details about the action taken with respect to the test drug and about th e 
patient’s outcome.  
8.1.2 Suspected adverse reaction  
Suspected adverse reaction means any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility 
that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, ‘reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the 
adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.

8.1.3 Unexpected a dverse reaction  
An adverse event  or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, 
if an investigator brochure is not requir ed or available, is not consistent with the risk information 
described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. "Unexpected”, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in 
the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the 
pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the 
particular drug under investigation.  
8.1.4 Serious  
An Unanticipated Problem or Protocol Deviation is serious if it meets the definition of a Serious Adverse Event or if it compromises the safety, welfare or rights of subjects or others.  
8.1.4.1  Serious Adverse Event  
An adver se event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if in the view o f the 
investigator or the sponsor, it results in any of the following:  
• Death,  
• A life -threatening adverse drug experience  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of  the ability to conduct 
normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
8.1.5 Disability  
A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal li fe functions.  
8.1.6 Life-threatening adverse drug experience  
Any adverse event or suspected adverse reaction  that places the patient or subject, in the view of 
the investigator  or sponsor , at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it 
does not include a reaction that had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.

8.2.3 NCI-IRB Reporting of IND Safety Reports  
Only IND Safety Reports that meet  the definition  of an unanticipated problem  will need to be 
reported to the NCI IRB.  
8.3 IND  SPONSOR REPORTING CRITERIA  
An investiga tor must immediately report to the sponsor, using the mandatory MedWatch form 
3500a, any serious adverse event, whether or not considered drug related, including those listed 
in the protocol or investigator brochure and must include an assessment of whethe r there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  
Study endpoints that are serious adverse events (e.g. all -cause mortality) must be reported in 
accordance with the protocol unless there is evidence suggesting a causal relationship between the drug and the event (e.g. death from anaphylaxis).  In that case, the investigator must 
immediately report the death to the sponsor.

• clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that 
listed in the protocol o r investigator brochure  
to the FDA  and to all investigators no later than 15 calendar days after determining that the 
information qualifies for reporting  using the MedWatch Form 3500a.  If FDA requests any 
additional data or information, the sponsor must s ubmit it to the FDA as soon as possible, but no 
later than 15 calendars days after receiving the request. FDA Annual Reports (Refer to 21 CRF 
312.32) 
8.4.2 FDA Annual Reports (Refer to 21 CFR 312.33)  
The study Sponsor  will submit a brief report annually of the progress of the trial within 60 days 
of the anniversary date that the IND went into effect  as indicated in 21CFR 312.33 and any 
associated FDA correspondences regarding the IND annual report .  
8.4.3 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting Criteria to the IND Manufacturer  (Tracon 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc.)  
The initial telephone/facsimile report should contain as much information as is available 
concerning the event in order to permit Tracon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. to file a report, which satisfies regulatory requirements.  Initial telephone report of SAE must be followed -up by a 
completed SAE report ( Medwatch form 3500a signed by the investigator) faxed to the Medical 
Monitor at Trac on Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or designee.  The event should also be entered into the 
source documents and case report forms, as appropriate.  
If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports will be required. A completed 
SAE form report sh ould follow the initial phone call or incomplete fax report within 5 working 
days for all SAEs.  
When additional information is available, a follow -up SAE report form should be faxed to the 
Medical Monitor at Tracon Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or designee.  
Any adverse events that are initially ‘non- serious’ but become ‘serious’ shall be reportable 
according to the time of the most recent classification.  
One serious adverse event report (SAER) form will be completed per serious adverse event (SAE).  The SAE term should match with the term captured on the AE page of the CRF.  In 
order to avoid vague, ambiguous, or colloquial expressions, the AE term should be recorded in standard medical terminology.  
For all serious adverse events, the Principal Investigator or an Associate Investigator will be 
responsible for completing the SAE Report  Form and will fax the SAE Form within 24 hours  of 
their knowledge of the event to the Medical Monitor at Tracon Pharmaceuticals, Inc:

8.5 RECORDING OF ADVERSE EVENTS   
Adverse events  will be assessed from the time the patient receives the first dose of TRC105 
through completion of the final end -of-treatment assessment.  All new events, as well as those 
that worsen in intensity or frequency re lative to baseline, must be captured.  All adverse events 
will be recorded on case report forms.   The Investigator or his staff should elicit information 
regarding the occurrence of adverse events through information volunteered by the patient, open -
ended questioning of the patient, physical examination results and review of laboratory results.  
Information to be recorded for each adverse event includes:  
•  CTC AE Term  
• The date and time of onset of the event  
• The date and time of resolution of the event  
• Assessments of severity, causal relationship  to study drug, and seriousness of the 
adverse event.  
• Action(s) taken (if any) for management of the adverse event, including but not 
limited to change in the study drug administration (e.g., temporary interruption in dosing, dose reduction); drug treatment; non-drug treatment; diagnostic procedures 
performed  
• Outcome of the adverse event:  patient recovered without sequelae; patient recovered with sequelae; event ongoing; patient died  
If a laboratory abnormality is one component of a diagnosis or syndrome, t hen only the diagnosis 
or syndrome should be records on the AE page of the CRF. If the abnormality was not a part of a 
diagnosis or syndrome, then the abnormality should be recorded as the AE.  
For causality assessment, the Investigator must assess whether the event was related to the study 
medications, concurrent drug therapy, underlying cancer, concurrent illness, a combination of 
these factors, or if it is unknown.   
Adverse events characterized as intermittent require documentation of onset and duration of each episode.  
Events resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of disease states must be reported as adverse events.  
Any medical condition that is present at the time that the patient is screened but does not deteriorate should not be reported as an adverse event.  However, if it deteriorates at any time 
during the study, it should be recorded as an adverse event.  
All adverse events will be followed to adequate resolution/stabilization. An adverse event will be 
considered to have resolved if either of the following events has occurred:  
• The principal investigator has documented that all abnormal symptoms, physical 
signs, and laboratory abnormalities associated with the adverse event have returned to 
normal (normal is defined as the baseline conditions for that individual established at 
the screening visit) or satisfactory stabilization has been reached.

• In cases where resolution/stabilization is not obvious, the Investigato r should obtain 
written confirmation from the sponsor that the event can be considered resolved and 
that further follow -up is unnecessary.

Amendment:  N 
9.1.3 TRC105 Preparation 
TRC105 will be prepared in the pharmacy and diluted into normal saline using appropriate 
aseptic technique.  TRC105 will be administered using an in -line 0.2 micron filter.  No 
incompatibilities between TRC105 and polyvinyl chloride or polyolefin bags have been observed.  Multiple vials will be require d for a single dose.  The following formulae should be 
used to calculate the volume of TRC105 to be added to normal saline:  
• Patient weight (kg) × dose level (mg/kg) divided by TRC105 concentration (mg/mL) 
= volume of TRC105 (mL) to be administered.  
The vol ume of TRC105 that is to be administered can be rounded up or down to the nearest 1.0 
mL; in the case of an increment of 0.5 mL the volume should be rounded up.  The maximum 
weight that should be used for dose calculation in this study is 85 kg for women and 100 kg for 
men (note: there is not a weight restriction for enrollment purposes).  If the patient’s weight 
changes by > 10% during the study, the dose of TRC105 will be recalculated.  At that time a new 
baseline weight will be established such that subs equent weight changes by >10% from the new 
baseline weight would require further recalculation of the TRC105 dose. The calculated volume of TRC105 will be diluted with normal saline.  Appropriate judgment should be exercised in 
withdrawing an adequate amount of saline necessary to permit injection of the appropriate 
volume of antibody into a normal saline bag in accordance with the dose needed.  The final 
TRC105 concentration must be between 0.3 mg/mL and 10 mg/mL.  The prepared TRC105 must 
be gently invert ed several times in order to ensure a homogeneous solution. The diluted infusion 
solution of TRC105 should be used within 8 hours of preparation if stored at room temperature, or within 24 hours of dilution if stored at 2° to 8°C (36º to 46ºF). The expirat ion time should be 
labeled on the bag.  If the diluted infusion solution of TRC105 cannot be infused within 8 hours of preparation (i.e.: the prepared infusion is at room temperature for more than 8 hours), a second 
bag will be prepared that contains the balance of the planned dose that was not already delivered. 
The prepared solution should not be frozen.  
9.1.4 TRC105 Handling and Disposal  
The Investigator should not return clinical study materials to TRACON unless specifically 
instructed to do so by TRACON.  All used or expired vials of TRC105 should be retained.  A 
TRACON representative will periodically conduct an accountability of the used or expired vials 
and authorize their destruction.  
If the participating pharmacy is prohibited by institutional policy fro m retaining open or expired 
vials, the Site Pharmacist will then be responsible for documenting the destruction of the vials and completing an Investigational Drug Product Destruction Form.  
9.1.5 Adverse Events  and potential safety risks based on ongoing and com pleted studies of 
TRC105  
Grade 3 anemia has occurred with TRC105 therapy at the recommended phase 2 dose of 10 
mg/kg weekly.  All patients treated with TRC105 should be monitored closely for anemia and treated appropriately, including the possibility of TRC105 dose reductions.  Anemia may be 
caused by correctable mineral or vitamin deficiency. The anemia related to TRC105 is

Abbreviated Title:  Sorafenib and TRC105 in HCC  
NCI Protocol #:  11-C-0102

Amendment:  N 
hypoproductive in nature and is reversible with interruption of treatment, transfusion, 
erythropoietin, and other interventions as app ropriate.  
Gastrointestinal hemorrhage has occurred with TRC105 therapy.  Patients with active ulcer disease or risk factors for ulcer disease are excluded from this study.    
Grade 1 and 2 cutaneous telangiectasia related to TRC105 occur early in the cours e of therapy 
and have been the source of gingival bleeding and epistaxis.  Telangiectasia are also seen in 
patients with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a disease of CD105 haplotype 
insufficiency.  Patients with HHT are at risk of hemorrhage f rom abnormal blood vessels and this 
could be exacerbated by treatment with TRC105.  Other contraindications to TRC105 therapy include a history of significant hemorrhage or tumors located in the central chest or another 
location where bleeding is associated with high morbidity.  All patients treated with TRC105 
should be monitored for signs of hemorrhage and the risks and benefits of drug treatment 
reevaluated in any patient with hemorrhage.  
Premedication including the use of glucocorticoids is required pri or to infusion of TRC105 to 
reduce the frequency and severity of infusion reactions.  Infusion reactions following TRC105 dosing generally occur with the first TRC105 dose and include a grade 4 vasovagal reaction that 
resolved without sequelae.  Signs and symptoms of TRC105 infusion reactions include 
hypertension, hypotension, dyspnea, bronchospasm, chills/rigors, chills, sweats, fever, nausea, 
tachycardia, bradycardia, EKG changes, flushing, urticaria, pruritus, and headache, generally of 
grade 1 and 2 sev erity. Potential infusion reactions seen with other therapeutic antibodies include 
angioedema, asthenia, throat irritation, rhinitis, vomiting, joint pain, fatigue and neurologic disorders including inflammation of the spine and/or brain.  
Hypersensitivity  reactions with infusions are a potential risk for sensitized patients, and TRC105 
should be used with caution in patients with known hypersensitivity to any component of the 
drug product.  Host anti -TRC105 antibodies to the murine or human portions of CHO -produced 
TRC105 are rare.  In general, the risk of immunogenicity to therapeutic chimeric antibodies is small (<10%) and the clinical significance of immunogenicity is not well defined.  The current 
trial will collect serial blood samples for anti-product antibody concentrations to further 
characterize the immunogenicity of TRC105 and potential clinical implications.  
Grade 3 cerebrovascular hemorrhage resulting in hemiparesis occurred in one patient with 
hepatocellular cancer who was thrombocytopenic (who entered the study with a platelet count of 
60,000/uL) in a study of TRC105 with sorafenib.  Patients must have a platelet count of > 
100,000/uL to enter this study (see inclusion criteria).  Transient Grade 3 hepatic encephalopathy 
occurred in one patient with cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma who received TRC105 in 
combination with sorafenib.   Additionally, Grade 5 intracranial hemorrhage occurred in one 
glioblastoma patient with markedly abnormal blood clotting parameters in a study of TRC105 
with b evacizumab. A patient with glioblastoma developed temporary confusion and slurred 
speech following treatment with TRC105 and bevacizumab that required hospitalization for observation. Another patient with glioblastoma, who underwent resection and had a his tory of an 
abnormal collection of cerebral spinal fluid, developed a grade 2 cerebral spinal fluid leak.  
Grade 3 myocardial infarction (non -Q wave infarct associated with hypertension following an 
infusion reaction) was observed in a patient with hepatocellular cancer following treatment with 
80

TRC105 that resolved without sequelae.  In addition, a Grade 5 myocardial infarction occurred in 
a patient with coronary artery disease who received TRC105 in combination with sorafenib. 
Patients with evidence of active coronary artery disease are excluded from participation in this 
trial (see exclusion criteria).   
Adult respiratory distress syndrome that required temporary intubation occurred in one patient who received TRC105 with pazopanib, from which the patient re covered. Of note, interstitial 
lung disease has been added as an adverse drug reaction and warning/precaution to the core safety information for pazopanib.  
Infections have been observed rarely. Grade 3 infected lipoma/cyst was observed in a Phase 2 study o f TRC105 as a single agent in patients with metastatic bladder cancer. Grade 3 orbital 
cellulitis and grade 3 brain abscess were observed in patients treated with TRC105 and bevacizumab and considered possibly related to TRC105.  Grade 1 and 2 gingivitis i ncluding 
infection and ulceration has also been observed.  Overall, infections have been observed in fewer than 5% of patients and have largely been considered unrelated to treatment with TRC105.  
Grade 1 -3 headaches have been observed following TRC105 trea tment, generally within hours 
following completion of the initial infusion.  Headaches are throbbing in nature, are not associated with radiographic abnormalities, and have responded to treatment with non -steroidal 
anti-inflammatory agents and to triptans.  Headaches were particularly common when TRC105 
and bevacizumab were initially dosed on the same day and were ameliorated when TRC105 was 
dosed one week following bevacizumab dosing and given over two days during the initial week 
of dosing.  
Nasal congestio n and periorbital edema have been observed with TRC105 dosing, particularly 
when dosed in combination with bevacizumab.  The edema has been transient in nature and 
treated with corticosteroids.  
9.1.6 Fatigue of grade 1 - 3 severity has been reported following dosing with TRC105. 
Maculopapular rash and skin flushing of grade 1 and grade 2 severity have also been 
reported.  A patient receiving treatment with TRC105 and sorafenib developed self -
limited pancreatitis of grade 2 severity. TRC105 Drug Accountability 
The Investigator must maintain an accurate accounting of TRC105 supplied by TRACON.  
During the study, the following information must be recorded:  
• Date of receipt, quantity and identification of the study drug received from TRACON  
• ID number of the patient to w hom the product is dispensed  
• The date(s) and quantity of the product dispensed  
• Dates and quantity of product returned, lost or accidentally or deliberately destroyed

The following adverse events have been reported on trials but the relationship to 
Sorafenib still undetermined: Arthritis, brain stem stroke, dyspnea, increase PT/PTT, 
and weight loss.  
9.2.6 Drug interactions  
Sorafenib is metabolized by the P450 CYP3A enzyme and has been show n in preclinical studies to 
inhibit multiple CYP isoforms.  Therefore, it is possible that BAY43 -9006 tosylate may interact 
with drugs that are metabolized by the P450 CYP isoenzymes or with drugs that inhibit CYP 3A.  
Close monitoring is recommended for p atients taking agents with narrow therapeutic indices and 
metabolized by the liver, such as warfarin, quinidine and digoxin.   Additionally, Sorafenib  is 97% 
to 99% protein bound; however, no drug interactions have been reported in studies, thus far.  
9.2.7 Availa bility  
Sorafenib is FDA approved for the indication used in this study, and will be purchased by the 
Clinical Center Pharmacy from commercial sources . 
9.2.8 Agent Accountability  
Sorafenib , an oral self -administered investigational agent, will be accounted for, h andled, and 
disposed of in accordance with CCR Policy # Clin -1, “Policy on Documenting, Handling and

Disposing of Oral Investigational Agents that are Self -Administered by NCI CCR patients.”  The 
Standard Operating Procedure # Clin -1, “Standard Operating Procedure for Conducting and 
Documenting Drug Accountability for Oral Investigational Agents that are Self -Administered by 
Patients at the CCR” identifies activities associated with drug accountability and compliance 
monitoring for orally self -administered investigational agents.  Study drug will be dispensed in 
bottles of 140 tablets.  Each patient will be instructed to document in a study diary the daily intake of sorafenib , including the time the dose is taken and whether or not any doses are missed, 
and to date and sign the entry. They will bring the study diary and any unused drug to their next 
scheduled clinic appointment. Clinic staff will (1) collect all “old” [i.e., empty bottle(s), partial 
bottle(s) or full bottle(s)] of study drug; (2) perform a ca psule count and record the results on the 
approved CCR Pill Count Case Report Form which is to be maintained in the research record; and (3) dispense the new partial and full bottle(s) of sorafenib  to the patient.  Unused study drugs 
are to be returned to the research nurse who will dispose of them according to the SOP.

11.3 APPENDIX  3:  CORRELATIVE STUDY SPECIMEN PROCESSING PROCEDURES  
11.3.1  Molecula r characterization of HCC using  tumor tissue , blood and urine (Xin Wang  lab): 
Processing of Blood Samples:  
1) Centrifuge green top tube(s) and red top tube(s), approximately 850 g (2000 rpm on 
Sorval T 6000) for 10 minutes to separate components.  
2) Withdraw pla sma (green tops) and aliquot into sterile cryovials at 1.5 ml per vial; 
withdraw serum (red tops) and aliquot into sterile cryovials at 0.5 ml per vial.  
3) Label each vial appropriately with printed bar code label (i.e., plasma normal [from green top tube], s erum normal [from red top tube]).  
4) From the green top tubes, remove the buffy coat from the red blood cell pellet; this appears as a white/pink layer on top of the RBCs, and can be done with a serological 
pipette or a transfer pipette.  Place buffy coat in  a cryovial, wash once with Phosphate 
Buffered Saline (PBS), and centrifuge as above to precipitate cells into a pellet.  Aspirate supernatant, label vial appropriately (as buffy coat normal) with printed bar code label.  
5) From the red top tube, pour the RB C/clot into a 15 ml plastic tube, label appropriately 
with a bar code label, and place in cryobox in -80 C freezer.  
6) For collection of RBCs, add PBS to green top tubes to resuspend the RBC pellet, and centrifuge for 5 min. at 850 g (2000 rpm).   Aspirate PB S and repeat this wash step.  
After the second wash, re- suspend the cells in an equal volume of PBS, aliquot 1.5 ml 
each into up to 10 cryovials, and centrifuge as above.  Aspirate PBS, and label vials 
appropriately (as RBC normal).  
7) Place all plasma, serum , buffy coat, and RBC vials in cryobox in -80 C freezer.  
Processing  of mouthwash: 
1) Transfer specimen from the container to a 50 ml centrifuge tube. 
2) Rinse container with about 10 ml of Listerine or PBS (Phosphate Buffered Saline) and 
add to 50 ml tube.  
3) Centr ifuge tube at 2700 rpm for 15 minutes to pellet cells.  
4) Discard the supernatant carefully so as not to disturb pellet.  
5) Wash the cell pellet in 25 ml of 1 X TE buffer and again centrifuge at 2700 rpm for 15 minutes to pellet cells.  
6) Discard the supernatant an d re-suspend the pellet in 100 ul 1 X TE  
7) buffer facilitated by vortexing.  
8) Aliquot the sample into two 1.8 ml labeled NUNC Cryovials and store samples in cryobox in -80 C freezer.  
Processing of  urine: 
1) Using a 25 ml serological pipette, aliquot urine into 1 3 ml plastic tubes, with up to10 ml 
into each tube, using up to 5 tubes.

11.5 APPENDIX 5: CORRELATIVE STUDY SPECIMEN AND DATA STORAGE PROCEDURES  
11.5.1  Sample Data Collection  
All samples sent to the Blood Processing Core (BPC) will be barcoded, with data entered and 
stored in the LABrador (aka LabSamples) utilized by the BPC. This is a secure program, with 
access to LABrador limited to defined Figg lab personnel, who are issued individual user 
accounts. Installation of LABrador is limited to computers specified by Dr. Figg. These 
computers all have a password restricted login screen. A ll Figg lab personnel with access to 
patient information annually complete the NIH online Protection of Human Subjects course.  
 
LABrador creates a unique barcode ID for every sample and sample box, which cannot be traced 
back to patients without LABrador access. The data recorded for each sample includes the 
patient ID, name, trial name/protocol number, time drawn, cycle time point, dose, material type, as well as box and freezer location. Patient demographics associated with the clinical center 
patient nu mber are provided in the system. For each sample, there are notes associated with the 
processing method (delay in sample processing, storage conditions on the ward, etc.).  
11.5.2  Sample Storage and Destruction  
Barcoded samples are stored in barcoded boxes in a locked freezer at either -20 or -80°C 
according to stability requirements.  These freezers are located onsite in the BCP  and offsite at 
NCI Frederick Central Repository Services (Fisher BioServices) in Frederick, MD. Visitors to the laboratory are required to be accompanied by laboratory staff at all times.  
Access to stored clinical samples is restricted. Samples will be stored until requested by a researcher named on the protocol. All requests are monitored and tracked in LABrador . All 
researchers are required to sign a form stating that the samples are only to be used for research purposes associated with this trial (as per the IRB approved protocol) and that any unused 
samples must be returned to the BPC. It is the responsibility of the NCI Principal Inves tigator to 
ensure that the samples requested are being used in a manner consistent with IRB approval.  
Following completion of this study, samples will remain in storage as detailed above. Samples 
will remain in storage only for those patients who have provided consent for their samples to be collected for future research. Access to these samples will only be granted following IRB 
approval of an additional protocol, granting the rights to use the material.  
If, at any time, a patient withdraws from the study  and does not wish for their existing samples to 
be utilized, the individual must provide a written request. Following receipt of this request, the samples will be destroyed (or returned to the patient, if so requested), and reported as such to the IRB. An y samples lost (in transit or by a researcher) or destroyed due to unknown sample 
integrity (i.e. broken freezer allows for extensive sample thawing, etc.) will be reported as such to the IRB.  
Sample barcodes are linked to patient demographics and limited clinical information. This 
information will only be provided to investigators listed on this protocol, via registered use of the 
LABrador . It is critical that the sample remains linked to patient information such as race, age,

dates of diagnosis and death,  and histological information about the tumor, in order to correlate 
genotype with these variables.  
Any new uses of human subject samples collected during the course of this trial must be 
reviewed and approved by the NCI IRB. Any loss or unintentional dest ruction of the samples 
will be reported to the IRB.

 INTRODUCTION 
We invite you to take part in a research study at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  
First, we want you to know that: 
Taking part in NIH research is entirely voluntary .  
You may choose not to take part, or you may withdraw from the study  at any time.  In 
either case, you will not lose any benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.  However, 
to receive care at the NIH, you must be taking part in a study or be under evaluation for study participation.  
You may receive no benefit from taking part.  The research may give us knowledge that may help people in the future. 
Second, some people have personal, religious or ethical beliefs that may limit the kinds of 
medical or research treatments they would want to receive (such as blood transfusions).  If you 
have such beliefs, please discuss them with your NIH doctors or research team before you agree to the study. 
Now we will describe this research study.  Before you decide to take part, please take as much 
time as you need to ask any questions and discuss this study with anyone at NIH, or with family, friends or your personal physician or other health professional.   
Why is this study being done?   
This study is divided into two phases. In the phase 1  portion, we determined the highest safe 
dose of an experimental cancer drug called TRC105, when given with another cancer drug, 
sorafenib (also called Nexavar ).  You are being asked to participate in Phase 2 of this study.   
To our knowledge, this is the first time TRC105 has been given with sorafenib in humans.

 Sorafenib has been approved by the FDA for treatment of kidney and liver cancer (hepatocellular 
carcinoma - HCC) .  It has been shown to prolong survival in patients with HCC. Unfortunately, 
we know that after a period of time the cancer tends  to start growing again. This study will try to 
improve the cancer fighting ability of sorafenib by giving it in combination with TRC105.  This 
study is being done in collaboration with Tracon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., the makers of TRC105.   
TRC105 is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and is experimental.  
TRC105 is a man- made antibody (a special immune system protein) that blocks the body’s steps 
for making new blood vessels grow, a process called angiogenesis.  All solid tumors require new blood vessels to grow.  Sorafenib is in a class of medications call ‘multikinase inhibitors’ and 
works by slowing the spread of cancer cells.  It is thought therefore, that giving patients with 
HCC  tumors TRC105  in combination with sorafenib, we w ill stop the growth of their tumors or 
cause tumors to shrink, better than with sorafenib alone.   
Why are you being asked to take part in this study? 
You are being asked to participate because you have hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC ) that has 
not responded to other types of therapy, and your doctor has determined that you are not a 
candidate for liver transplantation.   
How many people will take part in this study ?  
To date, the phase 1 portion of this study has enrolled 1 9 patients. The phase 2 portion of this 
study will enroll up to a maximum of 23 patients.  
Description of Research Study  
What will happen if you take part in this research study?    
Before you begin the study  
All research studies have specific criteria for entry to allow for valid interpretation of the study 
results and safety of participants, known as eligibility criteria.  Before you begin this study you will need to have the following exams and tests to make sure you are eligible for this study.  The exams and tests are part of regular cancer care and may be done even if you do not join the study.  If you recently had some of the tests, they may not need to be repeated.   
• History and physical examination, including vital signs (height, weight, blood pressure, 
heart rate, temperature, breathing rate)

 • Standard blood tests to measure your liver and kidney function, white blood cells, red 
blood cells and platelets, your blood sugar and blood electrolytes.  If you are a woman 
able to get pregnant, you will also have a pregnancy test done. 
• Scans, x -rays and an ultrasound of your tumors to measure your disease.   
• Electrocardiogram within 16 days prior to your first dose of TRC105. 
• HIV Testing:  As part of this study, we will test you for infection with the human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS.  If you are infected with HIV you will not be able to participate in this study.  We will tell you what the results mean, how to find care, how to avoid infecting others, how we report newly diagnosed HIV infection, and the importance of informing your partners at possible risk because of your HIV infection. 
• Endoscope exam of your esophagus to look for varices (swollen or enlarged blood 
vessels).  Because bleeding is a possible side effect of all cancer drugs that limit blood vessel grow th, patients with varices will not be eligible to participate.  
If you meet the eligibility criteria for this study you will be offered the option of participating.  
During the study  
Everyone enrolled in the study will take the same dose of sorafenib ( two pills) two times every 
day, in the morning and at night.  The TRC 105 will be given through a vein (intravenously) once every two weeks  on days 1 and 15 of a 28 day cycle.  In the phase 1 portion of the study we 
found the highest dose that will be given in the phase 2 portion.  Everyone enrolled in phase 2 
portion of the study will receive the same dose of sorafenib and TRC 105. The TRC 105 dose was determined in the phase 1 part of this study.   
The TRC105 infusion will be given to you in the outpatient clinic, while the nurses and doctors 
watch you closely for any side effects.  The sorafenib pills should be swallowed whole with a 
full glass (8 ounces) of water in the morning and night every day for the 28 days of the cycle.  
You can take it with or without food.   
To help prevent known side effects of the TRC105 you will be given a steroid, Dexamethasone, 
through your vein 30 minutes to 2 hours before you receive TRC105.  Infusion of any antibody 
has the potential to cause an allergic- type of infusion reaction, and giving the steroid helps 
prevent this.  In addition, 30 minutes before you receive the TRC105 you will be given cetirizine (or similar drug) to help prevent infusion reactions, in addition to acetaminophen (Tylenol) to prevent chills and fever and famotidine (or similar drug) to prevent stomach upset.  The first

 dose of TRC105 will be given over a period of 4 hours, and if you do not have side effects, the 
next dose may be given over two hours.  If the second dose is tolerated, subsequent doses can be 
given over at least one hour.   
If you experience side effects (described later in this consent) during the TRC105 infusion, the 
infusion may be slowed or stopped, or treated with additional medicines, if necessary.  If the side effects are too severe, the doctor may decide to stop all further doses of TRC105.  If the side 
effects are not too severe, subsequent doses may be delayed until you have time to recover.  The 
dosages of both TRC105 and sorafenib may be adjusted after the first cycle to reduce th e severity 
of your side effects, if the doctor determines your side effects are not too severe.  
At each visit during the first cycle you will have a physical examination and blood tests, which 
are the same as what you would have done with your regular cancer care, including blood tests for blood counts and chemistries.  We will also do a urine test  every cycle  to evaluate your 
kidney functions.  We will ask you questions about how you are feeling and any medications you may have taken to treat your symptoms.  Every third  cycle (about every three months) you will 
have standard scans and x -rays to evaluate your tumor(s).  After the first cycle the physical 
examination and blood tests will be repeated at the beginning of each new cycle (each month).   
Research  Tests   
An important part of this study is testing the effects of TRC105  in combination with sorafenib on 
your body and your cancer.  We would also like to do research studies on the characteristics  and 
genetic analysis of  your type of cancer (HCC). These studies will study the DNA or genes that 
are important in your cancer and may be causing it to grow. We will not be studying your ‘normal’ genes however. In other words , we will only be studying the genes or DNA in your 
cancer and not those in normal parts  of your body. We therefore will not be able to look at 
hereditary genes, or ones that cause conditions to ‘run in families’. To do these studies w e will 
collect blood, mouth wash, urine, and tissue specimen s (optional).  We will also look at the blood 
levels of various markers of angiogenesis (blood vessel growth).  These tests are being done for 
research purposes only, and therefore the results will be preliminary and will not be reported 
back to you or your referring physician. 
To do these tests , we woul d like to take blood samples before your first infusion, on Day 15 of 
your first cycle, Day 1 and 15 of your second cycle, Day 1 of your third cycle, and after your last 
treatment.  We may ask you to give us a mouth wash sample before starting therapy. 
In addition, we will take 1 teaspoon of blood before your first dose and then on Day 1 of every 
3
rd cycle, and 3 and 6 months after you stop TRC105 to see if your body is making immune cells 
against the antibody.

 In total we would draw about 31 tablespoons  of blood over the course of this study.  The amount 
of blood taken for these research tests is within the safe guidelines for research blood volumes 
set by the NIH.  In adults that limit is 37 tablespoons in an 8 -week period.  
If the doctors think that we can obtain a piece of your tumor (biopsy) through a needle (percutaneously) with minimal risk to you, we will take a biopsy when you start the study and 
during week 8 of therapy .  You will be given the chance to decide if you want to participate at 
the time of the procedure. If you decide to have the biopsy, you will be given local anesthesia 
(numbing medicine) and a sedative prior to the biopsy.  The biopsy will be taken through a needle put through the skin into your liver tumor.  After the procedure you will have to lay on your right side for 2 -4 hours, and the nurses will watch your blood pressure and other vital signs. 
Research Scans  
DCE -MRI:   To study the changes in the tumor vessels you will be asked to undergo an MRI, 
called a dynamic contrast enhanced  magnetic resonance imaging (or DCE -MRI) before starting 
treatment, 24 to 36 hours after your first dose of TRC105 and then at the end of the first cycle.  MRI is a scan that uses a powerful magnetic field, radio frequency pulses and computer to take pictu res of your bones, organs and tumor inside the body.  DCE is a special test that uses contras t 
fluid to better see these body structures, including blood vessels.  The radiologist will make sure 
it is safe for you to have this test, as you may not have any metal objects on or in your body.   
Ultrasound of tumor blood vessels:  Ultrasound imaging, also called ultrasound scanning or 
sonography, uses high-frequency sound waves to produce pictures of  your tumor blood vessels  
inside of the body.  Ultrasound exams  do not use ionizing radiation (as used in x -rays).   This test 
will be done before starting treatment, 24 to 36 hours after your first dose of TRC105 and then at the end of the first cycle.   
When you are finished taking the drugs (treatment) 
After complet ing treatment with TRC105, a nurse or doctor will contact you or your physician to 
get an update of your condition, at least every year.

physician to ask about your condition. 
 
Birth Control  
If you are a woman who is breast feeding or pregnant, you may not take part in the study because 
we don’t know how this medicine would affect your baby or your unborn child.  If you are a 
woman who can become pregnant, or are the partner of a woman who can become pregnant, you 
will need to practice an effective form of birth control before starting study treatment, during study treatment,  and for 3 months after you finish study treatment.  If you think that you or your 
partner is pregnant, you should tell your study doctor or nurse at once.   
Effective forms of birth control include:  
• abstinence  
• intrauterine device (IUD)  
• hormonal [birth control pills, injections, or im plants]  
• tubal ligation  
• vasectomy  
 
Risk s or Discomforts of Participation 
What side effects or risks can I expect from being in this study?   
You may have side effects while you are taking the study drug s.  Everyone taking part in the 
study will be watched ca refully for any side effects.  However, doctors don’t know all the side 
effects that may happen, so it is important to report any changes that you may notice, even if 
your study team does not ask specifically about them.  Side effects may be mild or severe.  Your study team will give you medicines to help lessen side effects.  Many side effects go away with those medicines and others may go away soon after you stop the study drugs.  In some cases, side effects can be serious, long lasting, or may never go away.  There are no known long -lasting

*The skin rash, fatigue, diarrhea, and high blood pressure are reversible, and can usually be alleviated by reducing the dose of sorafenib.   We will monitor your blood pressure carefully on 
the study, and if found to be elevated, a medication to lower your blood pressure can be used. If 
you have uncontrolled high blood pressure, this elevated pressure can cause damage to other 
organs including the heart, kidneys, or brain. Having uncontrolled high blood pressure increases the risk of heart attack and stroke in adults. Usually there are no symptoms of high blood pressure ; however, dizziness, headache, or nose bleed can occur.

Biopsy of Liver Tumor: 
The most common side effect of a liver biopsy is pain.  Other rare complications include 
bleeding, which may rarely be severe  enough to require a transfusion, puncturing a nearby organ, 
or very rarely (less than 1%) death. We will monitor you for 24 hours after your liver biopsy to 
rule-out bleeding. 
DCE -MRI:  
Most MRI exams are painless, however, some patients find it uncomforta ble to remain still 
during MR imaging.  Others experience a sense of being closed -in (claustrophobia).  Therefore, 
sedation can be arranged for those patients who anticipate anxiety, but fewer than one in 20 
require it.  It is normal for the area of your body being imaged to feel slightly warm, but if it bothers you, notify the radiologist or technologist.  It is important that you remain perfectly still 
while the images are being recorded, which is typically only a few seconds to a few minutes at a 
time.   For some types of exams, you may be asked to hold your breath.  When the contrast 
material is injected, it is normal to feel coolness and a flushing sensation for a minute or two.  
The intravenous needle may cause you some discomfort when it is inserted and once it is 
removed, you may experience some bruising.  There is also a very small chance of irritation of 
your skin at the site of the IV tube insertion. 
Ultrasound of tumor blood vessels: 
This procedure is painless and requires no preparation. 
Potential Benefits of Participation  
Are there benefits to taking part in this study?  
The aim of the study is to determine the highest safe dose of TRC105 when given in combination 
with sorafenib.  We do not know if you will receive personal, medical benefit from ta king part in 
this study.   The potential benefits could include shrinking of your tumor or lessen ing of your  
symptoms, such as pain, that are caused by the cancer.  Because there is not much information about the effect s of this combination on HCC , we do not know if you will benefit from taking 
part in this study, although the knowledge gained from this study may  help others in the future 
who have cancer.

 Alternative Approaches or Treatments  
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study?   
Instead of being in this study, you have these options: 
• Getting treatment or care for your cancer without being in a study 
• Taking part in another study 
• Getting comfort care, also called palliative care.  This type of care helps reduce pain, 
tiredness, ap petite problems and other problems caused by the cancer.  It does not treat 
the cancer directly.  Instead, it tries to improve how you feel.  Comfort care tries to keep 
you as active and comfortable as possible.  
Please talk to your doctor about these and other options. 
Research Subject’s Rights  
What are the costs of taking part in this study?  
If you choose to take part  in the study, the following will apply, in keeping with the NIH policy:  
• You will receive study treatment at no charge to you . This  may include 
surgery, medic ines, laboratory testing, x -rays or scans done at the 
Clinical Center, National Institutes of Health (NIH) , or arranged for you 
by the research team to be done outside the Clinical Center, NIH  if the 
study related treatment is not availab le at the NIH .  
• There are limited funds available to cover the cost of some tests and 
procedures performed outside the Clinical Center, NIH.  You may have 
to pay for the se costs if they are  not covered by your insurance company.

Conflict of Interest  
The National Institute s of Health  (NIH)  reviews NIH staff researchers at least yearly for conflicts 
of interest.  This process is detailed in a Protocol Review Guide.  You may ask your research 
team  for a copy of the Protocol Review Guide or for more information .  Members of th e research 
team who do not work for NIH are expected to follow these guidelines but they do not need to 
report their personal finances to the NIH. 
 
Members of the research team working on this study may have up to $15,000 of stock in the 
companies that mak e products used in this study.  This is allowed under federal rules and is not a 
conflict of interest.  
The National Institutes of Health and the research team for this study are using  a drug  developed 
by Tracon Pharmaceuticals  through a joint study with your researchers and the company.   The 
company also provides financial support for this study.  
Use of Specimens and Data for Future Research  
To advance science, it is helpful for researchers to share information they get from studying 
human samples.  They  do this by putting it into one or more scientific databases, where it is 
stored along with information from other studies. A researcher who wants to study the 
information must apply to the database and be approved.  Researchers use specimens and data stored in scientific databases to advance science and learn about health and disease.   
We plan  to keep some of your specimens and data that we collect  and use them for future 
research  and share them with other researchers. We will not contact you to ask about each of 
these future uses.   These specimens and data will be stripped of identifiers such as name, address 
or account number, so that they may be used for future research on any topic and shared broadly for research purposes. Y our specimens and data will be used for research purposes only and will 
not benefit you.  It is also possible that the stored specimens and data may never be used.  Results of research done on your specimens and data will not be available to you or your doctor.  It might help people who have cancer and other diseases in the future.   
If you do not want your stored specimens and data used for future research, please contact us in 
writing and let us know that you do not want us to use your specimens and/or data.  Then any specimens that  have not already been used or shared will be destroyed  and your data will not be 
used for future research. However, it may not be possible to withdraw or delete materials or data 
once they have been shared with other researchers.

 OTHER PERTINENT INFORMA TION  
1. Confidentiality.  When results of an NIH research study are reported in medical journals or 
at scientific meetings, the people who take part are not named and identified.  In most cases, the 
NIH will not release any information about your research involvement without your written 
permission.  However, if you sign a release of information form, for example, for an insurance company, the NIH will give the insurance company information from your medical record.  This information might affect (either fa vorably or unfavorably) the willingness of the insurance 
company to sell you insurance. 
The Federal Privacy Act protects the confidentiality of your NIH medical records.  However, you 
should know that the Act allows release of some information from your medical record without your permission, for example, if it is required by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), members of Congress, law enforcement officials, or authorized hospital accreditation organizations.

SYNOPSIS
Clinical Protocol CA224022
Protocol Title: A Phase 1 /2aDose Escalation and Co hort Expansio n Study  of the Safety , Tolerability , and Efficacy 
of Anti -LAG -3Monoclonal Antibody (Relatlimab, BMS -986016) Administered Alone and in Combination with Anti -
PD-1 Monoclonal Antibody (Nivolumab, BMS -936558) in Relapsed or Refractory B-Cell Malignancies
Short Title: Safety Study of Anti -LAG -3 in Relapsed or Refractory Hematologic Malignanc ies
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): Relatlimab (BMS -986016, antiLAG -3 antibody) is supplied as a sterile  mg/mL or mg/mL 
formulation to be administered as an intraven ous (IV) infusion. Nivolumab (BMS -936558) is available as a sterile 
mg/mL formulation to be administered as an IV infusion.
In Part A (dose escalatio n monotherapy ), relatlimab will be administered at doses of  mg once 
every 2weeks (Q2W) , in 8 -week cycles, for up to 12 cycles of study therapy.
Part B, cohort expansion , monotherapy, will be carried outat  mg. The dose selected has not exceed edthe 
maximum tolerated dose [MTD], or maximum administered dose [MAD] (if an MTD is not established) identified in 
Part A, mo notherapy  escalatio n.Study therapy will be administered once ever y 2 weeks, in 8 -week cycles, for up to 
12 cycles.
In Part C (dose escalation , combination therapy ), relatlimab will be administered starting at  mg dos e in combination 
with a fixed dose of nivolumab at  mg once ever y 2weeks, in 8 -week cycles, for up to 12 cycles of study therapy. 
The intermediate dose of relatlimab (anti-LAG -3)  mg and nivolumab (BMS -936558 )  mg was also tested 
under MTD and shown to be well -tolerated.
Part D is a cohort expansion, combination therapy. The doses selected for Part D will not exceed the MTD (or MAD 
if no MTD is determined) in Part C, but may incorporate assessment of other data including toxicities and PK and 
pharmacodynamic data from Parts A, B and C and data from the CA224020 study . Doses to be considered may include 
doses intermediate to those evaluated in Part C if recommended by the Investigators and the Sponsor . Modeling may 
be used to help inform the selec tion of the combination dose level to carry forward in Part D if a dose below the MTD 
is chosen. Study therapy will be administered once every 
2 weeks, in 8-week cycles, for up to 12cycles. The 
combinatio n of anti-
LAG -3 mg and nivolumab  mg was selected for expansion in Part D after showing the 
tolerability in Part C.
Study Phase: Phase 1 /2a
Research Hypothesis: It is anticipated that antiLAG -3 antibody (relatlimab ), administered as monotherapy  or in 
combinatio n with nivolumab ,will demonstrate adequate safety and tolerability, as well as a favorable risk/benefit 
profile, to support further clinical testing. No prospective hypotheses are being formally evaluated.
Objectives:
Primary Objective:
The primary objective is to characterize the safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) of relatlimab administered alone or in combination with nivolumab to subjects with 
relapsed or refractory B -cell malignancies.
The co-primary  objective in combination therapy expansio n Part D is to investigate the preliminary efficacy of 
relatlimab in combination with nivolumab in subjects with relapsed or refractory Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), and 
relapsed or refracto ry Diffused Large B Cell ly mphoma (DLBCL). Tumor response will be evaluated according 
to the revised International Working Group (IWG) criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (2007 IWG criteria) ;see 
Appendix 1.

*In Part A, and selected cohort in Part D (ie ,Hodgkin Lymphoma PD -1/PD-L1 naive cohort), subjects will be naive 
to immune cell-modulating antibody regimens (ICMARs), such as but not limited to anti PD-1, anti PD-L1, anti 
PD-L2, anti CTLA -4, anti-KIR, and/or anti-OX40 antibodies. Prior anti-CD20, alem tuzumab, and/or anti-CD30 
antibody therapy are allowed.
**In Part B, Part C, and selected cohorts in Part D (ie ,Hodgkin Lymphoma anti -PD-1/PD -L1 resistant/failure cohort 
and Diffuse Large B -Cell Lymphoma cohort),subjects will be naive to immune cell -modulating antibody regimens 
(ICMARs), such as, but not limited to anti CTLA -4, anti PD-L2, anti-KIR, and/or anti-OX4 0 antibodies. Prior 
anti-PD-1, anti -PD-L1, anti CD137, anti -CD20, alemtuzumab, and/or anti -CD30 antibody therapy are allowed. 
Subjects will complete up to 4periods of the study: Screening (up to 28 days), Treatment (up to a maximum of  
-week cycles of study  therapy ), Clinical Follow -up (135 days following the last dose of study  drug)and Survival 
Follow -up(up to years followin g the first dose of study drug). Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP )will 
have additio nal follow -up assessments through Day 165 for home pregnancy tests. An independent period, Re-
challenge, may be conducted in selected cases at progression.
The Treatment Period consists of up to twelve 8 -week treatment cy cles. Each treatment cycle comprises  doses of 
relatlimab admini stered on Days . Subjects will be allowed to continue study therapy until the first 
occurrence of either: (1) meeting criteria for discontinuation as described in Section 4.3.5, (2) completion of the 
maximum number of twelve 8-week cycles, (3) confirmed progressive disease (PD), or (4) clinical deterioration. 
Subjects who discontinue treatment will enter a 135 -
day Clinical Follow -upperiod. After completion of the Clinical 
Follow -up period , HL patients in Parts C and D will enter the Surviv al Follow -up period . During this period, clinic 
visits or telephone contact every 12 weeks will be performed to assess survival status. For participants who discontinue 
study treatment prior to disease progression, diagnostic imaging will be obtained every 6 months after the first clinical

study drug) until disease progression. Re-challenge may be conducted in selected cases at progression.
If subjects progress during the Clinical Follow -Up period or the Survival Follow -Up period, they could further receive 
therapy  with relatlimab alone or in combination with nivolumab (Re-challenge period) as long as the risk:benefit ratio 
is considered favorable by  the Investigato r and the Medical Monitor and eligibility  criteria is met (Section 3.3). The 
original dose and schedul e and pr otocol rules would appl y accordingly. Thus, subjects could receive therapy for up to 
12additional eight -week cycles. Subjects will not be re-challenged a second time. Collection of archival tissue 
(baseline) and tumor biopsies (baseline and o n-treatment) will be optional for subjects enrolled for re -challenge .PK 
and biomarker monitoring will be limited (Sections 5.5 and 5.7).

will initially be treated in each dose cohort; in Dose Cohort 1, the first  subjects will be designated as sentinel subjects
and will begin treatment at least 5 days apart. Subjects in subseque nt cohorts will not be required to observe the 5 -day 
interval between treatment start dates. 
Dose escalation will be based on the number of DLTs experienced during the DLT evaluation interval as determined 
by the Medical Monitor and Investigators. The DLT evaluation interval begins on the first day of treatment and 
continues for 8weeks, ie, through Day of the first cycle.

Dose escalation in Pa rt A (Table 1) will proceed as foll ows:
If none of the first  evaluable subjects in a dose cohort experiences a DLT within the DLT evaluation interval, 
then the next  subjects will be treated at the next higher dose cohort. 
If  of the first  evaluable subjects in a cohort experiences a DLT within the DLT evaluation interval, then 
additional subjects will be treated in that dose cohort. 
If no more than  of the first  evaluable subjects experiences a DLT during the DLT evaluation interval, 
then the next  subjects will be enrolled at the next higher dose cohort. 
If  of the first  evaluable subjects in a cohort experience a DLT, that cohort will be expanded to evaluable 
subjects.
If of the first  evaluable subjects,  of the first  evaluable subjects, or of the first  evaluable subjects 
in a cohort experience a DLT within the DLT evaluation interval, that dose level will have exceeded the MTD 
and dose escalation will be terminated.

In consultation with Investigators, the Sponsor may investigate dose levels intermediate to those defined in the 
protocol. Prior to declaring the MTD (or MAD), and in consultation with Investigators, the Sponsor has the option to 
expand any cohort previously established to be safe in order to obtain additio nal experience or to investigate dose 
levels intermediate to those defined in the protocol. Dose escalation rules (cohort size, DLT evaluation interval, cohort 
expansion criteria, etc.) will apply to the additional cohorts. Amaximum of  subjects will be enrolled in any additional 
dose cohorts.
Cohort Expansion (Part B): The purpose of this cohort expansion is to gather additional safety, tolerability, PK, and 
pharmacodynamic information regarding relatlimab dosed at  mg. The dose selected for Part B has not exceeded 
the MTD in Part A (the MTD was not reached at up t o  mg relatlimab Q2W in monotherapy). 
In Part B, the four expansion cohorts will be restricted to the tumor ty peslisted in Figure 1 and Table 2 .Continuous
evaluation of toxicity  events will be assessed throughout enrollment in the expansion cohorts. If, at any time, the 
aggregate rate of treatment -related toxicities meeting DLT criteria exceeds  across all subjects treated in the PartB 
cohort expansions, the findings will be discussed with the Medical Monitor and Investigators; further enrollment may 
be interrupted. Depending on the nature and grade of the toxicity  and after assessing the risk:benefit ratio, the dose 
for all or for sel ect cohorts may be reduced.

subject in the same dose esc alation cohort.
The dosages during dose escalation are pro vided in Figure 1 and Table 3 . 
Treatment in Part C will be initiated after the decision is made to escalate to the fourth dose cohort (  mg anti -LAG-3 
in combinatio n with  mg anti -PD-1) in C A224 020 study . At no point will the dose of relatlimab administered in 
combinatio n with nivolumab (Part C) exceed doses of relatlimab that have been demonstrated previously to be safe 
on the monotherapy  dose escalatio n arm (Part A). The escalation cohorts in Part C will be restricted to subjects with 
1) HL naive to anti -PD-1/PD -L1, 2) HL (naive to anti -PD-1/PD -L1 or w hose disease progresses while -on or within 3 
months after treatment with anti -PD-1 or anti -PD-L1 antibody 3) DLBCL.
Dose escalation in Part C will proceed as described for Part A with the exception that the DLT period will be reduced 
from 8 weeks to 4 weeks (see Section 3.1.5). If no MTD is reached through Dose Cohort 3, then additional cohorts of 
relatlimab given in combination with nivolumab m ay be considered based on the aggregate safety experience during 
dose escalation. Enrollment of additional cohorts will be implemented upon consultation and agreement between 
Investigators and the Sponsor via a protocol amendment.
Prior to declaring the MTD (or MAD), and in consultation with Investigators, the Sponsor has the option to expand 
any cohort previously established to be safe in order to obtain additio nal experience or to investigate dose levels 
intermediate to those defined in the protocol. Dose escalation rules (cohort size, DLT evaluation interval, cohort 
expansion criteria, etc.) will apply to these expanded or additional cohorts. A maximum of  subjects will be enrolled 
in any  additional or expanded dose cohorts.
After completion of the relatlimab (anti-
LAG -3)  mg and nivolumab (BMS -936558)  mg cohort, the 
intermediate dose combination of anti-LAG -3  mg and nivolumab  mg was investigated in Part C. The dose 
combinatio n ( mg anti -LAG -3/ mg nivolumab) was well -tolerated in Part C and therefore selected for Part D 
(expansion).
No within -subject dose escalations will be permitted. If a dose level is found to exceed the MTD, subjects enrolled in 
that dose level may  be reduced to a lower dose following consultation and agreement betw een Investigators and the 
Sponsor.

Cohort Expansion Combination Therapy (Part D): The purpose of cohort expansion is to gather additio nal safety,  
tolerability, preliminary efficacy, PK, and pharmacodynamic information in subjects treated with sequential infusion 
of nivolumab followed by administratio n of relatlimab . The  doses selected for Part D will not exceed the MTD (or 
MAD if no MTD is determined) in Part C, but may incorporate assessment of other data including toxicities and PK , 
pharmacodynamic data from Parts A, B and C and data from the CA224 020 study . Doses to be considered may include 
doses intermediate to those evaluated in Par t C if r ecommended by the Investigators and the Sponsor. The intermediate 
dose of relatlimab (anti-LAG -3)  mg and nivolumab  mg, tested below the MTD, and was well tolerated and 
was selected for extension .Modeling may be used to help inform the sele ction of the combination dose level to carry 
forward in Part D if a dose below the MTD is chosen. Three expansion cohorts will be restricted to the tumor ty pes 
listed inTable 4. Continuou s evaluation of toxicity  events will be assessed throughout enrol lment in the expansion 
cohorts. If, at any time, the aggregate rate of treatment -related toxicities meeting DLT criteria exceeds  across all 
subjects treated in the Part D cohort expansions, the findings will be discussed with the Medical Monitor and 
Inves tigators; further enrollment may be interrupted. Depending on the nature and grade of the toxicity and after 
assessing the risk:benefit ratio, the dose for all or for select cohorts may be reduced.

Dose -Limiting Toxicities :
For the purpose of guiding decisions regarding dose escalation in Part A, (DLT) will be determined based on the 
incidence, intensity, and duration of AEs that are related to study  drug and that occur within 8 weeks of initiation of 
study drug (ie, the DLT evaluation interval which begins on the first day of treatment and ends on Day 56 of the first 
cycle).
For the purpose of guiding decision in combination dose escalation in Part C, (DLT) wi ll be determined based on the 
incidence, intensity, and duration of AEs that are related to study  drug and that occur within 4 weeks of initiation of 
study drug (i e,the DLT evaluation interval which begins on the first day of treatment and ends on Day 29 of the first 
cycle).
Adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Crite ria for 
Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0). For the purpose of subject management, any AE that meets DLT criteria, 
regardless o f the cycle in which it occurs, will lead to dose interruption.
Dose escalation will be based on the number of DLTs experienced during the DLT evaluation interval as determined 
by the Medical Monitor and Investigators.
No intra subject dose escalatio n is allowed. In Part A, subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug during the 
8-week evaluation interval will be considered evaluable for DLT determination. In Part C, subjects who receive at 
least 2dosesof study drug durin g the 4-week evaluation interval will be considered evaluable for DLT determination. 
Subjects who withdraw from the study during the DLT evaluation interval for reasons other than a DLT 
and/or for 
whom safety data are unavailable for the entire DLT evaluat ion interval may  be replaced at the same dose level. In 
the event that an infusion cannot be administered at a scheduled visit during the DLT evaluatio n inte rval, it must be 
administered as soon as possible. If the delay is between 1 and 7 days, the proced ures at the originally scheduled visit 
should be performed and subjects will be considered evaluable for DLT determination. If the delay  is more than 7 
days, the dose will be considered missed and will not be replaced. Subjects with a delay of more than 7 days will not 
be considered evaluable for DLT determination. Unevaluable subjects may be replaced at the same dose level. 
Duration of Study: Subjects will be allowed to continue on therapy for up to twelve 8 -week cycles orconfirmed PD
or until meeting criteria for discontinuation as described in Section 3.5. Treatment beyond progression may be 
considered in select subjects as described in Section 4.3.4. Subjects may be on study for a total of up to approximately 
5years, including a 28 -day screening perio d, up to twelve 8-week cycles of treatment, a 135-day clinical follow -up 
period, and up to 5 years of follow -up for survival (beginning from the first dose of study  drug). The study  will end 
once survival follow -up has concluded. For WOCBP, additional home pregnancy tests through Day . The total 
duration of the study  is expected to be approximately  
9-10years from the time of the first visit of the first subject to 
the required survival follow -up of the last subject enrolled. If subjects progress during the clinical follow -up prior or 
the survival follow-up period, could further receive therapy  with relatlimab alone or in combination with nivolumab 
(Re-challenge) as long as they meet eligibility criteria and the risk:benefit ratio is considered favorable by the 
Investigator and the Medical Monitor. The original dose and schedule and protocol rules would apply accordingly. 
Subjects will not be re -challenged a second time.
Number of Subjects: Approximately subjects may be dose d.
Study Population: Male and female subjects with histologic or cytologic confirmation of CLL, Hodgkin lymphoma, 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple myeloma who have relapsed following prior treatment or been refracto ry to 
prior treatment and who meet all entry criteria will be eligible to participate
Dose Escalation (Part A):Adult subjects with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), Hodgkin

Study Assessments:
Safety outcome measures: Safety assessments will be based on medical review of AE reports and the results of 
vital sign measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), physical examinations, pulse oximetry, and clinical 
laborato ry tests. AEs will be assessed continuously during the study and for 135 days after the last treatment. AEs 
will be coded using the most current version of Medical Dictionary for Regulato ry Activities (Med DRA) and 
reviewed for potential significance and importance. AEs and laboratory tests will be graded using the NCI 
CTCAE v4.0.
Efficacy measures: Tumor responses will be determined for subjects with adequate data as defined by the 
following efficacy criter ia. 
NHL and HL subjects: Revised R esponse Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Appendix 1)
NHL or HL subjects who had FDG -PET scans performed in the pre -treatment period and during this study : 
retrospective assessment using Lugano 2014 Response Criteria (Appendix 7)
CLL subjects: Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (Appendix 2)
MM subjects: Response Criteria Modified from IMWG for Multiple Myeloma (Appendix 6)
Pharmacokinetic measures: Serial serum samples will be collected from all subjects at specified time points to 
evaluate concentrations of relatlimab and/or nivolumab .PK parameters such as Cmax, Ctrough, Tmax, 
AUC(TAU), CLT, and AI will be derived from serum concentration versus time data.
Immunogenicity measure s:Serum samples will be collected from all subjects at specified time points to evaluate 
development of anti -drug antibodies (ADA) to relatlimab and/or nivolumab .
Explo ratory  Biomarker measures: The sample collection and biomarker assessment strategy is designed to address 
mechanisms of action, pharmacodynamic changes associated with relatlimab administered a s monotherapy or in 
combinatio n with nivolumab , and potential identification of predictive safety and efficacy biomarkers associated 
with relatlimab , and to evaluate potential mechanis ms of resistance to relatlimab .To address these key questions, 
peripheral blood, serum, and biopsy samples will be collected prior to and during study drug treat ment in Parts A,
B, C, and D,of this study.
Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size:
Dose escalation (Part A and C ): The sample size at each dose depends o n observed toxicity and cannot be precisely 
determined. Part A will have  to  subjects in each cohort.

mg dose level. If  of subjects or  of  subjects (ie, ) experience a toxicity there is at least  
confidence that the true toxicity rate is not greater than (based on Clopper -Pearson exact binomial 1-sided 
confidence interval). In addition, administ ration of relatlimab at the dose of 
 mg to  or  subjects provides 
 probability of observing at least one occurrence of any adverse event that would occur with or  incidence, 
respectively, in the population from which the sample was drawn.
Cohort Expansion for Combination Therap y (Part D ): The objective of this expansion in combination with nivolumab 
is, in addition to demonstrating adequate safety and tolerability, to evaluate a favorable risk/benefit assessed by signal 
seeking for anti-PD-1/PD-L1 progressed nivolumab HL, improvement in complet e response rate (CRR) for 
anti-PD1/PD-L1naive HL relative to PD-1 monotherapies, and improvement in objective response rate (ORR) for 
DLBCL relative to existing available therapies . 
A 2-stage design (Fleming’s), which allows to stop early for futility as well as for efficacy, will be used as a guidance 
for each disease cohort with reaso nable false positive rate (eg, FPR ) and false negative rate (eg, FNR ) 
based on assumptions of true (target ) and historic response rate for each cohort. Each disease cohort will be handled 
independently and there will be no multiplicity adjustment. The assumed historic and target response rates may change 
over time and may need to be adjusted by the time respon se data from this study are available. Enrollment may 
continue into stage 2 while the planned number of subjects for stage 1 are followed for efficacy evaluable tumor 
assessments. There will be no stopping o f a disease cohort for efficacy.
For anti-PD-1/PD-
L1progr essed HL, the assumed target response rate will be % vs % of inefficacious rate; as 
there is no standard of care available in thi s patient population. For anti-PD-1/PD -L1naive HL, the assumed target 
CRR will be % vs % observed with anti -PD1 mo notherapy . For DLBCL, the assumed target ORR will be  
vs % ,which was obtained from Study CA209039 by averaging the observed rates of monotherapy  and 
a combination treatment with ipilimumab . The sample size and operational characteristics of using 
Fleming’s 2 -stage design are provided, as an example, in Table 5 , although not used for statistical hypothesis testing.
Guided by Table 5, approximately  subjects, for example, will be treated in Stage 1 for an initial evaluation of 
efficacy. This will inform potential early  decisions and guide planning/operations, or early terminatio n after taking 
into consideration of additional data such as time to and/o r duration of response, and safety . For example, assuming 
the true response rate is 
 for anti -PD-1/PD -L1progr essed HL cohort when treated with relatlimab in combination 
with nivolumab, if there are  or more responses in  subjects, the cohort may  be stopped for efficacy  and consider 
larger scale comparative trials. The proba bility  of early stopping for efficacy is approximately  if in fact the 
treatment is efficacious. If there is no response in  treated subjects, the cohort may be stopped for futility. The 
probability of early stopping for futility is approximately  if in fact the treatment is inefficacious, eg, . If there 
is just  response, an additio nal  subjects may be treated to collect more data. This design yields a FPR of  when 
the true response rate is  and FNR of  when the true response rate is  rather than . For anti -PD-1/PD -L1
naive HL and DLBCL cohorts assuming the true response rate is  when treated with relatlimab in combination 
with nivolumab, if there are  or more responses in  subjects, the cohort may be stopped for efficacy. The p robability 
of early  stopping for efficacy is approximately  if in fact the treatment is efficacious. If there are  or fewer 
responses in  treated subjects, the cohort may be stopped for futility. The probability of early stopping for futility is 
approximately  if in fact there is no improvement with the combination treatment. If there are  or  responses in 
 treated subjects, additional  subjects may be treated to collect more data. This design yields a FPR of  when 
the true response rate is  and FNR of  when the true response rate is .

Endpoints
Primary Endpoints
The primary  endpoint of this Phase 1 study is safety  as measured at the study level by the rate of AEs, SAEs, AEs 
leading to discontinuation, deaths, and laboratory abnormalities, assessed during treatment and for up to 135 days after 
the last treatment. All subjects who receive at least one dose of relatlimab alone or in combination with nivolumab 
will be analyzed fo r safety .Co-primary  endpoint in Part D is objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response 
(DOR).
Secondary Endpoints
Pharmacokinetics Select PK parameters, such as Cmax, Ctrough, Tmax, AUC(TAU), CLT, and AI, will be assessed 
from concentration -time data at select time points throughout treatment with relatlimab administered alone or in 
combinatio n with nivolumab 
Immunogenicity The proportion of subjects who are ADA-positive at baseline, the proportion of subjects who
become ADA-positive on study, and the proportion of subjects who remain ADA- negative to relatlimab will be 
measured during treatment and for up to 135 days after their last treatment in post -treatment follow -up.
Efficac y:All efficacy analy ses will be based on the all treated analy sis population except otherwise stated.
Co-primary , secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints for Part D subjects are as follows:
Objective Response Rate (ORR)
ORR based on investigator assessment, according to the applicable c riteria based on tumor type, will be a co-primary 
endpoint in Part D.For the NHL and HL subjects ,the ORR will be based on the IWG (2007) response criteria. In 
addition to the primary ORR endpoint, an exploratory endpoint of ORR based on the Lugano (2014) response criteria 
in the NHL and HL subjects in Part D will be assessed. For the Lugano criteria ,response is defined as complete 
metabolic response (CMR) and partial metabolic response (PMR) .
Duration of Objective Response (DOR)
DOR is defined as the time between the date of first documented response (CR or PR) to the date of the first objectivel y 
documented progression as per criteria relevant to each disease type in Part D (Appendices 1, 2, and 6)], or death due 
to any  cause, w hichever occurs first. For subjects who neither progress nor die, DOR will be censored on the date of 
their last tumor assessment. Subjects who start subsequent therapy  without a prior reported progr ession will be 
censored at the last tumor assessments prior to initiation of the subsequent anticancer therapy. This endpoint will only 
be evaluated in subjects with objective response of CR or PR. DOR will be evaluated based on investigator 
assessments. DOR is co primary  endpoint in Part D.DOR based on the Lugano (2014) response criteria, response 
defined as CMR or PMR, will be assess ed for the NHL/HL subjects in P art D as an exploratory endpoint.
Complete Response (CR) Rate and Duration
The CR rate is defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response ( BOR )of CR accordi ng to the applicable 
criteria based on tumor type, based on IWG criteria for NHL and HL subjects, divided by the number of treated 
subjects. The duration of CR (DoCR) will only  be evaluated in subjects with BOR of CR and is defined as the time 
from first d ocumentation of CR (the date of first negative FDG -PET scan) to the date of initial objectively documented 
progression as determined using the applicable criteria based on tumo r type or death due to any cause, whichever 
occurs first. Censoring will be applied as per DOR definition. CRrate and DoCR will be evaluated based on 
investigator assessments. CR rateis an exploratory endpoint in this study.
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate
PFS is defined as the time from first dose to the date of first objectiv ely documented progression, per applicable 
criteria based on tumor ty pe or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Subjects who die without a reported 
progression will be considered to have progressed on the date of their death. Subjects who did no t progress or die will 
be censored on the date of their last evaluable tumo r assessment. Subjects who did not have any on study tumor

assessments and did not die will be censored on the date of first dose. Subjects who started any subsequent anti -cancer 
therapy, including tumor -directed radiotherapy and tumor -directed surgery, without a prior reported progression will 
be censored at the last evaluable tumo r assessment prior to initiation of the subsequent anti-cancer therapy. The PFS 
rate at time T is defin ed as the probability that a subject has not progressed and is alive at time T following first dose .
PFSR will be assessed at Weeks 16, 24, 32, 40, and 100, and evaluated based on investigator assessments. PFS will 
be an exploratory endpoint in this study.
Overall Survival (OS) Rate
OS is defined as the time between the date of first dose and the date of death. For subjects without documentation of 
death, OS will be censored on the last date the subject was known to be alive. The overall survival rate at ti me T is 
defined as the probability that a subject is alive at time T following first dose OS will be assessed at various time 
points in HLpatients in Part D.
Exploratory Endpoints:
Biomarkers Biomarkers endpoints from peripheral blood may include measures such as levels of soluble factors, as
well as activation and proliferation of subsets of immune cells including but not limited to subset of T cells
characterized by immunophenotyping, at each scheduled time point. Biomarker endpoints from tumo r biopsies may
include, but will not be limited to, expression of immune activation genes, the architecture of immune cells in the
tumor and expression of LAG3, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II, prog rammed cell death 1 (PD -1),
and programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD -L1). Measures of receptor occupancy  as characterized in peripheral blood,
bone marrow, and lymph node (if available) may also be provided.
Receptor Occupancy Measures of receptor occupancy as characterized in peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymph 
node (if available) will be provided.
Other Efficacy Endpoints
PFS based on Lugano (2014) Criteria PFS for a subject is defined as the time from the first dosing date to the date of 
first progres sive metabolic disease or death due to any cause (death occurring after retreatment will not be considered), 
whichever occurs first. Subjects who died without a reported prior progression will be considered to have progressed 
on the date of their death. Th e censoring rules applied to the PFS endpoint based on the IWG criteria will also be used 
for this endpoint.
Complete Metabolic Response Rate based on Lugano 2014 Criteria The CMR rate is defined as the number of subjects 
with a BOR of CMR based on the Lug ano (2014) criteria divided by the number of treated subjects. The duration of 
CMR (DoCMR) will only be evaluated in subjects with BOR of CMR and is defined as the time from first 
documentation of CMR (the date of first negative FDG -PET scan) to the date of initial objectively documented 
progressive metabolic disease based on the Lugano (2014) criteria or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Censoring will be app lied using the DO R definition. CMR rate and DoCMR will be evaluated based on investig ator 
assessments.
Analyses :
Unless otherwise specified, safety data from Parts A -Dwill be summarized both (1) overall by dose level and across 
all dose levels and (2) by dose level and across all dose levels within each tumor type. Efficacy data will be summarized 
by dose level within each tumor type and patient population. 
Efficacy Individual ORR, CRR, DOR, CMR, PMR, and PFS (based on IWG and Lugano criteria) will be determined. 
BOR outcomes will be summarized using frequency  tables together with 2 -sided 95% confidence intervals. Time to 
event distribution (eg, PFS, DOR , and DoCMR ) will be estimated using Kaplan -Meier (K-M) method. When 
appropriate, the median along with 95% CI will be provided using Brookmeyer and Crowley methodology (using log -
log transformation for constructing the confidence intervals). Rates at fixed time points ( e.g. PFSR 24 weeks) will be 
derived from the K -M estimate and corresponding confidence interval will be derived based on Greenwood formula. 
Confidence intervals for binomial proportions will be deriv ed using the Clopper -Pearson method. OS data will be 
analyzed similarly  to PFS data analysis.

Safety: All subjects who receive study drug therapy will be evaluated for safety endpoints. All recorded AEs will be 
coded according to the most current version of MedDRA and be graded using the NCI CTCAE version 4.0. A Es will 
be listed and subjects with AEs will be summarized based on the event with worst CTC grade by system organ class 
(SOC) and preferred term (PT), counting o nce at the PT term level and o nce at the SOC level, for each dose, dosing 
regimen, and overall . Vital signs and clinical laboratory test results will be listed and summarized by treatment. In 
addition, the worst grade of a laboratory measure observed on -study by the baseline grade (per CTCAE v 4) will also 
be generated for selected laboratory tests. Any significant physical examination findings and results of clinical 
laborato ry tests will be listed. ECG results will be evaluated by the investigator and abnormalities, if present, will be 
listed.
Pharmacokinetics: PK parameters for relatlimab as monotherapy  and in combination with nivolumab will be 
calculated using noncompartmental analyses. Summary statistics will be tabulated for the PK parameters of relatlimab
by treatment and study day/week. To describe the dependency on dose of relatlimab , scatte r plots of Cmax and AUC 
(TAU) versus dose may be provided for each day measured. Dose proportionality of BMS 986016 will also be assessed 
based on a power model. Summary statistics of nivolumab exposure at trough and end of infusion will be tabulated

Immunogenicity: A listing will be provided for all available immunogenicity data. The number and percent of subjects 
who meet specified endpoint definitions in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be summarized for each drug. To 
examine the potentialrelationship between immunogenicity and safety, a table summarizing the frequency and type 
of AEs of special interest may be explored by immunogenicity status. In addition, potential relationships between 
immunogenicity and efficacy, pharmacodynamic markers, and/or PK may also be explored.
Exploratory Biomarkers: The pharmacodynamic effect on TILs, MILs, and other key tumor markers in subjects who 
undergo biopsy will be summarized using summary statistics and plots. In additio n, the correlation of  or  
changes and tumo r marker expression with measures of peripheral blood markers may  be explored graphically, and 
using appropriate modeling approaches based on data availability. Associations of biomarker measures from
peripheral blood or tumor biopsy with clinical outcomes may also be explored graphically and further assessed as
needed by methods such as, but not limited to, logistic regression and characterized by appropriate statistics.

1 INTRODUCTION AND STU DY RATIONALE
The use of immunotherapy  in the treatm ent of cancer is based on the premise that tumors evade 
the endogenous immune response by being recognized as self, and not non -self. Tum ors devel op 
immune resistance using different mechanisms; the goal of immunotherapy  is to counteract these 
resistance mechanisms, enabling the endogenous immune system  to reject tumors. The recent 
success of immune -modulat ing agents blocking checkpoint inhibitor mo lecules (eg, programmed 
cell death 1 [PD-1], programmed cell death protein ligand 1 [PD-L1], and cytotoxic 
T lymphocy te–associ ated antigen 4 [CTLA -4]) in patients with refractory  solid tumors has 
provi ded proof -of-concep t of the efficacy  of immune system act ivation as a therapeutic modalit y. 
Specifically , pati ents with metastatic melanoma had an increase in overall survival  when  treated 
with the ant iCTLA -4 ant ibody , ipilimumab.1Moreover, the same pat ient populat ion trea ted with 
the combination of ipilimumab and an antiPD-1 antibody  (nivolumab , BMS -936558) achieved 
an unprecedented 53% response rate and prolonged responses.2Recent preclinical data support the 
clinical testing of yet another checkpoint inhibitor molecule , lymphocy te activat ion gene 3 
(LAG -
3), as a rel evant therapeuti c target in select hematol ogical malignancies. Current concepts 
suggest that therapy  with immune -modulat ing agents may achieve robust and prolonged responses 
and deserves to be further explore d.
1.1 Study Rationale
1.1.1 Relapsed Refractory Hematological Malignancies as Unmet Medical 
Needs
Non-Hodgkin lympho mas (NHLs) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoprolifera tive malignancies 
with distinct clinical outcom es and responses to treatm ent. There are an estimated 69,740 new 
cases to be diagnosed in the United States in 2013.3The NHLs can be divided into 2prognostic 
groups: the indolent lympho mas (eg, follicular) and the aggressive lymphomas (eg,diffuse large 
B-cell [DLBCL], mantle cell, Burki tt). Aggressi ve lympho mas have an overall survival of 
approximately 60% at 5 years. Despite the fact that half of the aggressive cases are cured, the vast 
majorit y of relapses occur in the first 2 years after therapy . The concerning issue is that not all 
patients tol erate standard treatment with high -dose therapy  and stem  cell rescue at rel apse.4
Chronic lymphocy tic leukemia (CLL) is the most commo nly diagnosed l eukemia amo ng adults in 
the United States, wi th approximately 16,000 new cases est imated in the United State s for 2013.3
The median age at diagnosis is 72 years, with approximately  70% of patients diagnosed at older 
than 65 years (and 40% di agnosed at age 75 years).5Thus, CLL mainly affects elderly pat ients 
who cannot tolerate current myelosuppressive regimens used in yo unger and fitter patients.6
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) is yet another malignancy of lympho id tissue with an estimated 
9,290 new cases in the United States in 2013.3HLs can be divided into 2 pathology groups: 
classical HL (CHL) and lymphocy te-predominant HL (LPHL). In Western countri es, CHL 
accounts for 95% of HL cases. CHL is pathol ogically characteri zed by the presence of 
Hodgkin- Reed -Sternberg (HRS ) cells in an inflammatory  background. Combined chem otherapy

and radiotherapy  result in durable response rates but at the expense of significant morbidity 
(eg,secondary malignancies, cardi ac disease, and infertilit y). Unfortunately, around 30% of 
patients will beco me refractory  to initial therapy or will relapse. The therapeuti c options for 
refractory  or relapsed pat ients are very  limited and al so carry  a high m orbidi ty rate.4
Multiple myelo ma (MM) is an incurable malignancy arising from postgerminal mature B cells, 
characterized by an excess of monotypic plasma cells in the bone marrow, resul ting in elevated 
levels of monocl onal immunoglobulins in the serum  and/or urine. In the United States, the 
estimated annual  diagnosed incidence is 16,000, with approximately 50,000 prevalent cases. 
Multiple myelo ma accounts for 10% of all hematologic malignancies and 1% of all malignancies. 
Advances in therapy  have improved outcomes but the disease remains essent ially incurable and is 
associ ated wi th a high m orbidi ty and m ortali ty.
To address these unmet medical needs, compounds that have novel mechanisms of action with 
relevant single -agent activit y and good sa fety profiles need to be evaluated in clinical studies wit h 
the goal  of achieving a better therapeutic index when used in co mbinat ion regimens.
1.1.2 Rationale for Nivolumab Therapy
Programmed cell death 1 (PD -1) is a cell surface signaling receptor that plays a critical role in the 
regul ation of T cell activati on and tolerance.7It is a type I transmembrane protein and together 
with BTLA, CTLA -4, ICOS, and CD28, make up the CD28 family of T  c ell co stimulatory 
receptors. PD-1 is primarily expressed on activated T cells, B cells, and myelo id cells.8It is also 
expressed on natural killer (NK) cells.9Binding of PD -1 by its ligands PD L1 and PD -L2, resul ts 
in phosphorylat ion of the tyrosine resi due in the proximal  intracellular immune receptor ty rosine 
inhibitory  domain, followed by recrui tment of the phosphatase SHP-2, eventually resul ting in 
down -regulation of T cell act ivation. One important role of PD -1 is to limi t the activi ty of T cells 
in peripheral  tissues at the time of an inflammatory  response to infect ion, thus limit ing the 
development of autoimmunit y.10Evidence of this negative regulatory role comes from the finding 
that PD -1deficient mice develop lupus -like autoimmune diseases including arthrit is and nephrit is, 
along with cardiomyopathy .11,12In the tumor setting, the consequence is the devel opment of 
immune resistance wit hin the tum or microenvironment.
PD-1 is highly expressed on tumor -infiltrat ing lymphocytes, and its ligands are upregulated on the 
cell surface of many different tumors.13Multiple murine cancer models have demonstrated that 
binding of ligand to PD-1 results in immune evasi on. In addition, blockade of this interact ion 
resul ts in antitumor activit y. These findings provided the rationale for testing PD 1 pathway 
blockade in clinical trials.
Nivolumab is a fully human monoclonal ant ibody  that binds to PD -1 with nano molar affinit y and 
a high degree of specifici ty, thus precl uding binding of PD-1 t o its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2.14
Nivo lumab does not bind other related family members, such as BTLA, C TLA -4, ICOS, or CD28. 
Nivo lumab has demonstrated clinical activit y as monotherapy  in subjects with a  v ariety of 
hematol ogical advanced malignancies including diffuse large B-cell lympho ma, follicular

unresectable or metastatic melano ma as both a monotherapy  and in co mbination wit h ipilimumab. 
Nivo lumab is also approved for non -small cell lung cancer following failure on or after pl atinum 
based therapy , as well as for advanced renal cell carcino ma following treatm ent with an 
anti-angiogenic therapy (Secti on 1.7.3.2 ).
1.1.3 LAG -3 and T Cell Exhaustion
LAG -3 (CD223) is a type I transmembrane protein that is expressed on the cell surface of activated 
CD4+and CD8+T cells and subsets of natural killer (NK) and d endritic cells.15,16LAG -3 is closely 
related to CD4, 
which is a co-receptor for T helper cell activation. Both molecules have 4 
extracellular Ig- like domains and require binding to their ligand, majo r histocompat ibilit y complex
(MHC) class II, for their functional activity. In contrast to CD4, LAG -3 is only expressed on the 
cell surface of act ivated T cells and its cleavage from the cell surface terminates LAG -3 signaling. 
LAG -3 can also be found as a so luble protein but it does not bind to MHC class II and its funct ion 
is unknown.
It has been reported that LAG -3 plays an important role in prom oting regul atory  T cell (Treg) 
activit y and in negat ively regulat ing T cell act ivation and proliferat ion.17Both natural and induced 
Treg express increased LAG -3, which is requi red for their maximal suppressive function.18,19
Furtherm ore, ectopic expressio n of LAG-3 on CD4+effector T cells reduced their proliferat ive 
capacit y and conferred on them regulatory  potential  against third party  T cells.19Recent studi es 
have also shown that high LAG -3 expressio n on exhausted lymphocy tic chori omeningi tis virus 
(LCMV) -specific CD8+T cells contributes to their unresponsive state and limits CD8+T-cell 
antitumor responses.20,21In fact, LAG -3 maintained tolerance to self and tumor ant igens via direct 
effects on CD8+ T cells in 2 murine models
.21
Immune tolerance observed in the setting of tum or devel opment and tum or recurrence, however, 
seems to be mediated by the co-expressio n of various T-cell negative regul atory  receptors, not 
solely fro m LAG-3. Data fro m chronic viral infection models,20,21,22knock -out mice,23,24,25tumor 
recurrence models,26and, to a more limited extent, human cancer patients
,26,27,28support a model 
wherein T cells that are continuously exposed to antigen beco me progressively inact ivated through 
a process termed “exhaust ion.” Exhausted T cells are characterized by the expressio n of T-cell 
negat ive regulatory receptors, predominant ly CTLA -4, PD -1, and LAG -3, whose action is to limit  
the cell’s abilit y to proliferate, produce cytokines, and kill target T cells and/or to increase Treg 
activit y. However, the timing and sequence of expressio n of these mole cules in the development 
and recurrence of each tumor ty pe have n ot been fully  characteri zed.
1.1.4 LAG -3 Expression in Hematological Malignancies
The expressi on of the checkpo int inhibitors PD-1 and PD -L1 in NHLs,29,30,31,32CLL,33,34HL,35,36
and MM37,38has been associ ated with Tcell exhaustio n. Interestingly , the expressi on of these 
molecules may be driven by mutations leading to constitutive activity of their enhancers/prom oters 
and/or by the infect ion of host Tcells by Epstein Barr virus (EBV), among other factors.39

Emerging data indicates that LAG -3 expression on tumor-infiltrat ing lymphocy tes (TILs) and 
peripheral  blood coul d also be m ediat ing T cell exhaustion in hematological malignancies.
In primary CHL, for example, a small number of HRS cells are surrounded by a profuse 
inflammatory  infiltrate. Yet, HRS cells fail to evoke an effect ive Tcell response despi te the 
expressio n of class II MHC on tumor cells. This effect, known as the “paradox effect,”40could 
very well be mediated by Tcell exhaust ion. In this regard, Gandhi et al. have shown strong 
expressio n of LAG-3 on TILs in proximit y to HRS cells, particularly  in cases with EBV tissue 
positivity.In these HL subjects, circulat ing CD4+LAG -3hi cells were only elevated at diagnosis 
or at clinical relapse, but not during remissio n.28Although FOXP3 posit ivity was neit her linked to 
LAG -3 nor EBV tissue status, both Treg and LAG- 3+ CD4+ T cells were shown to be invo lved in 
tumor immune evasio n because the expressio n of FoxP3 and LAG -3, respect ively, co incided wit h 
the impairment of tumor-specific Tcell responses. These resul ts, in addition to the known 
expressio n of PD-L1 and PD-L2 on tumor cells and PD-1 on infiltrating lymphocy tes and 
peripheral  Tcells in HL,35strongly  suggest an ongoing “exhausted Tcell phenoty pe” in HL 
subjects. In fact, an increased PD-1 expressio n on TILs has been deter mined as a stage -independent  
negat ive prognosti c factor of overall sur vival as opposed to the number of FOXP3+ Tregs.41The 
contribution o f LAG -3 in this regard remains to be determined. 
Little is known about the expressio n and functions of LAG-3 in NHLs. LAG -3 expressio n has 
been docum ented in a subty pe of  DLBCL defined by  gene expressi on profiling as “host response 
tumor”. These tum ors have prominent T cell/dendritic cell infiltrates resembling those of smaller 
provi sional (WHO) subty pe of DLBCL, Tcell/histiocyte -rich B-cell lympho ma (T/HRBCL).42
Since HR -DLBCL patients did not have the best outcom es fo llowing empiric chemotherapy in this 
study , the authors inferred that thei r immune responses were ineffect ive due to the expressio n of 
inhibitory  receptors on CD8+ Tcells43or that tum ors were inherent ly refractory  to CHOP -based 
treatm ent. Interesti ngly, some aggressive B-cell and EBV -associated lympho mas also displa y 
ineffect ive Tcell immune responses and express PD-L1 on tumor cells and infiltrating 
macrophages.39Furthermore, the histology of EBV-positive DLBCL also resembles the changes 
found in HL, including HRS -like large cells admixed with abundant reactive small lymphocytes.44
The link between the se findings and LAG -3 expression and funct ion is yet to be established. 
It is also possible that LAG -3 expressi on may be a marker of uncontrolled clonal expansio n in 
select leukemias. When B-cell CLL is associ ated with the expressio n of unmutated 
immunogl obulin heavy  variable (IGHV) genes, it becomes a more aggressive form of CLL. By 
using gene co-expressio n net work analysis, Zhang et al. found a gene set (ie, LAG -3, LPL, ZAP70) 
that is assigned to unmutated IGHV in CLL cells.45Furtherm ore, Kotaskova et al. docum ented 
that high expressi on of LAG-3 on CLL cells correlates wi th unmutated IGHV status and reduced 
treatm ent-free survival.46In addit ion, Di ckinso n et al. described a specific association o f 11q22.3 
deletion with bulky lymphadenopathy  and expressi on of ZAP -70 and LAG -3 in CLL.47In 
summary, these data suggest an associ ation of LAG-3 expression with Tcell exhaust ion leading 
to bulky disease and poor prognosis. In contrast, the associ ation between PD-
1 expressio n and

clinical outcom e is not clear. Inone series, for exam ple, only 5%of 66 CLL/SLL cases showed 
unequivocal PD-1 positivity of leukemic cells by IHC.30The effects of both LAG -3 and PD-1 
expressio n and interaction on TILs, marrow -infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs), and peripheral blood 
from CLL pat ients remain to be elucidated. 
Multiple myelo ma (MM) is a malignant proliferatio n of plasma cells that produces monoclonal 
immunogl obulins, usually  IgG or IgA (60% and 20% of cases, respect ively). MM is associated 
with T  c ell abnorm alities including quant itative and funct ional defects of CD4+ T cells.48In 
relation to the latter, T cells from MM subjects have been shown to overe xpress PD -1while their 
malignant plasma cells express PD-L1.37So,it is expected that other checkpo int inhibitor 
molecules, such as LAG -3, may be overexpressed in peripheral T cells and/or in marrow 
infiltrat ing-
T-cells (ie, MILs) too. Furtherm ore, six tag SNPs in CD4 & LAG -3 genes (out of 
97immune -genes tested in peripheral  blood) have been significant ly associated with MM risk48. 
So,it is hypothesized that genet ic variations in the CD4/LAG -3 gene regions may be related to 
dysfunct ional T -cell responses result ing in a loss of control  over B -cell pro liferat ion.
Epstein -Barr virus infect ion is yet another factor to consider in the potenti al induct ion of T cell 
exhaust ion in hematol ogical malignancies. It is known that EBV -associated CLL, Richter’s 
syndro me, and lympho ma cases are usually more aggressive than their EBV(- ) 
counterparts.44,49,50,51,52Interestingly, the expressio n of checkpoint inhibitors like P D-L1 has also 
been docum ented in EBV -associ ated malignancies.39,36Thus, the chronic viral infect ion may be 
inducing the co -expressio n of other regulatory  inhibi tors as docum ented in chronic viral infect ion 
models. In the LCMV mouse model, for example, the co-expression of PD-1, LAG -3, and other 
inhibitory  receptors correlated with greater T cell exhaustion and more severe infect ion. Blockade 
of PD-1 and/or LAG -3 with specific, targeted antibodies was able to improve T cell responses and 
reduce viral load inf ection.20
Altogether, these data suggest that Tcell exhausti on induced by the aberrant expressio n of 
checkpoint inhibitor mo lecules (including LAG- 3) and epigenet ic factors (eg, EBV infect ion) may 
have an effect on the pathogenesis and outcomes of subjects with hematological malignancies.
1.1.5 Rationale for Anti -LAG -3 Antibody ( Relatlimab, BMS -986016) Therapy
Relatlimab ( BMS -986016) is a fully human antibody  specific for human LAG -3 that was i solated 
from immunized transgenic mice expressing human immunoglobulin genes. It is expressed as an 
IgG4 isoty pe antibody  that includes a stabilizing hinge mutation (S228P) for attenuated Fc rec eptor 
binding in order to reduce or eliminate the possibility of ant ibody -or complement -mediated target 
Tcell killing. Relat limab binds to a defined epitope on LAG -
3 with high affini ty (Kd, 
0.25-0.5nM) and specificit y and potently  blocks the interact ionof LAG-3 with its ligand, MHC 
class II (IC50, 0.7 nM). The antibody  exhibit s potent in vit ro functional activity in reversing 
LAG -3mediated inhibit ion of an antigen-specific murine T -cell hybrido ma overexpressing 
human LAG -3 (IC50, 1 nM). In addition, relatlimab enhances activat ion of human Tcells in 
superant igen stimulat ion assays when added al one or i n combinat ion with nivolumab (anti PD-1 
antibody ).

1.1.6 Preclinical Studies Utilizing Murine Anti -PD-1 and Anti -LAG -3 
Antibodies
The importance of LAG-3 as an immunotherapy  target was initially validated in the A20 murine 
in vivo model using a surrogate antibody  specific for mouse LAG -353and anti-PD-1. One study  
evaluated tum or growth inhibit ion in a syngeneic tum or m odel (ie, A20 B
-lymphocy te sarcom a). 
Mice wer e injected intravenously wit h the syngenei c A20 cell line and subsequently randomized 
to treatm ent wi th either control  IgG,anti-LAG -3 (19C7) , anti  PD-1 (4H2),orthe com binat ion of 
anti-LAG -3/ant i-PD-1.Survival was assessed as an endpoint of the study  and the treatm ent 
regimen was consi dered active if it produced a statisti cally significant survival  extension relative 
to animals treated wit
h control  IgG. The median survival of mice treated with control  IgG was 
40.5 days and all animals were dead by Day 49. Anti - Lag-3 administration resul ted in a statistically 
significant survival extensio n, with a median survival of mice in this group of 48days and 20% of 
mice alive beyo nd Day 
85.Administration of anti-PD-1 increased the median survival to 
48.5 days, with 10% of the mice alive at day 85. Anti-Lag-3 ant ibody administered in co mbinat ion 
with anti-PD-1 ant ibody  provi ded enhanced anti -tumor activi ty above the activi ty of either agent 
alone wi th a 60% of the mice alive beyo nd Day  85(see Figure 1.1.6 -1).

1.1.7 Rationale for Combination of Anti-LAG -3 Antibody ( Relatlimab ) and 
Nivolumab

infect ions which may also contribute to maintain Tcell exhaust ion. EBV infect ion, for example, 
has been co rrelated wi th expressio n of checkpo int molecules in Hodgkin lympho ma and DLBCL. 
Combined inhibit ion of T  c ell checkpo int molecules, such as CTLA -4, PD-1, and LAG -3, in 
preclinical models provides synergist ic improvement in T cell activit y, control of viru s replicat ion, 
and tumor inhibit ion in animal  models. Thus,the combinat ion of relatlimab and nivolumab (an 
antiPD-1 antibody ) inhematol ogicalmalignancies is expected to : 1) increase the number, ty pe, 
and duration of responses in tumors known to respond to T cell checkpo int inhibitors; 2) rescue an 
adaptive response where patients are refractory to T cell checkpo int inhibitors and have progressed 
clinically; and/or 3) enhanc
e the ant itumor immunit y in malignancies associated with chronic vira l 
infect ions (eg, HPV, EBV, HCV, HBV, etc ). 
1.1.8 Rationale for Dose Selection
Study  CA224022 current ly co nsists of 4parts, A to D.Part A consist sof a 3 + 3 + 3 do se escalat ion 
design with relatlimab administered as monotherapy  in subjects with advanced hematol ogical 
malignancies while Part Bconsists of expansio n cohorts of approximately  to subjects each in 
disease -restri cted populat ions, with relatlimab administered as monotherapy  at  mg flat dose.
Amendment 3to Study  CA224022 , introduces: 1) Part C, 3+3+3 dose escalat ion design with 
relatlimab administered in combination with nivolumab in disease -restri cted popul ations2) Part 
D dose expansio ncohorts of approximately to  subjects each to assess relatlimab and 
nivolumab effects in selected tumor ty pes.
1.1.8.1 Rationale for Flat Dosing
Therapeut ic monoclonal antibodies doses have been routinely calculated on a body size basis wit h 
a perception that this approach may reduce intersubjec t variabilit y in drug exposure compared with 
a flat dose approach. However, recent analyses of marketed and experimental monoclonal 
antibodies have demo nstrated that body weight -based dosing did not always offer advantages over 
flat dosing in reducing expo sure variabilit y.54,55Since the magnitude of the impact of body weight 
on the human PK of relatlimab is not y et determined and i t is unknown if body  size-based dosing 
woul d increase or decrease intersubject variabilit y, this study will utilize a flat dose escalat ion and 
expansio n since it is the simpler of the 2 approaches and may result in fewer dosing errors.
Flat doses for this study have been normalized for an average 80 -kg adult cancer patient. A dataset 
from a recent internal preliminary  population pharmacokinet ics (PPK) analysis for another 
immuno -oncol ogy monoclonal antibody  contained 325 subjects with a median weight of 81 kg. 
This value aligns well with a study by Bai et al,which found a median weight of 78 kg in 
2,519 adult patients with rheuma toid arthrit is, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, non -small cell lung 
cancer, ovarian cancer, and non
-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.55
Addit ionally , relatlima bflat dose of to  mg as monotherapy  and up to mg in 
combinat ion with nivolumab (both given every  2 weeks [Q2W] ) has been studied in across the 
40to 120 kg weight range in adults.Relatlimab flat dose  mg administered Q2W in 
combinat ion with nivolumab is currently under evaluat ion in this trial.

1.1.8.2 Rationale for -minuteNivolumab I nfusion
Long infusion times place a burden on subjects and treatment centers. Establishing that nivo lumab 
can be safely administered using shorter infusio n times of  minutes duration in subjects will 
diminish the burden provided no change in safety profile. Previous clinical studi es show that 
nivolumab has been administered safely  over  minutes at doses ranging up to mg/kg over 
long treatm ent duration. In Study CA209010, (a Phase 2, randomized, doubl e blinded, 
dose-ranging study  of nivolumab in subjects with advanced/metastatic clear cell RCC) a dose 
associ ation was observed for infusio n site reactio ns and hypersensit ivity react ions (  at 
mg/kg,  at mg/kg and  at  mg/kg). All the events were Grade 1-2 and were 
manageable. An infusion durat ion of  minutes for  mg and  flat doses of nivolumab 
(~60% of  the dose provided at  mg/kg) are not expected to present safet y concerns compared 
tothe prior experience at 
 mg/kg nivo lumab dose infused over a  minute duration.
1.1.8.3 Part A —Relatlimab Dose
The dose sel ected f or thi s study  is based on all available nonclinical data. There was no observed 
abnorm al phenoty pe in the LAG -3 knockout mice and no pathol ogical  changes associ ated with 
relatlimab monotherapy  administered to mice (  g twice weekly x 4 weeks, approximately 
mg/kg). In vitro studies suggest that relatlimab does not induce cytokine release. No adverse 
effects were observed in the repeat -dose Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) cyno molgus monkey 
toxicity study at the highest administered dose,  mg/kg/week, which was considered the 
no-observed -adverse -effect level (NOAEL) and highest non-severely  toxic dose (HNSTD). 
Simple allo metry  was used to project human PK parameters and to calculate the human equivalent 
dose (HED) for this NOAEL. With an added 10-fold safet y factor, the maximum recommended 
starting dose (MRSD) based on the cyno molgus toxicology study is mg/kg (intravenous [I
V] 
infusio n, Q2W ) in humans . However, relatlimab showed different binding affini ty between 
cyno molgus and human LAG -3 in in vitro studies and this must be taken into accoun t for the 
select ion of the starti ng dose. Studies in a LAG -3transfected Chinese hamster ovary  (CHO) 
model indicated the binding affini ty of relatlimab for cyno molgus LAG -3 is approximately -fold 
weaker than that for human LAG -3.Addit ional data generated from activated human and 
cyno molgus T cells have indicated that the affinit y difference could be as high as -fold; the 
HED wi th an affinit y correcti on targeted to achieve 
 (the most conservat ive safet y factor) of 
the AUC at the NOAEL in monkey  is  mg/kg. This approach of linear adjust ment for the 
highest observed affini ty difference is considered conservative ,as it is based on an NOAEL ,and 
does not take into account potential nonlinearit y in drug exposure at the result ing low dose levels. 
This approach assumed linear PK for extrapolation to low dose levels (ie,  mg/kg). However, 
the 2mouse tumor efficacy studies of mouse anti -LAG -3 surrogate antibody (19C7) showed more 
than dose proportional exposure increases between  and  mg/kg in monotherapy  and between 
 and mg/kg when 19C7 was co -administered wi th anti-PD-1, whereas the exposure of 19C7 
was dose -proporti onal at doses hi gher than  mg/kg. Thi s nonlinear PK, presumably due to the 
target -mediated binding and/or disposit ion (TMDD), could be possible for relatlimab at lower 
doses in cancer patients. This would resul t in lower exposures than projected in the lowest dose 
cohorts.

BMS -986016 relatlimab
An ant itumor study with the 19C7 ant i-LAG -3 antibody (a surrogate antibody wit h similar binding 
affinit y for murine LAG -3 as relatlimab to human LAG -3) in aSa1N model (the most sensitive 
mouse model tested) showed dose-dependent efficacy. Modeling and simulations based on these 
data project that a human dose of  mg/kg has the potential to produce tumor growth inhibit ion 
(TGI) of  to  and a mg/kg dose has the potenti al toresult in  to  TGI, 
depending on different tumor growth kinet ics and tumor killing potency  translation from mo use 
tumor model to th e clinic. A  TGI in preclinical models at clinically relevant exposures has 
generally been shown to correlate with clinical efficacy .56
To balance the potenti al for pharmaco logic act ivity and reasonable safety in this cancer patient 
popul ation, a dose of  mg (  mg/kg) was selected as the starting dose for Part A. This dose 
is less than  of the human equivalent of the NOAEL (  mg; mg/kg) and is below the 
HED after a linear adjustment of the NOAEL target exposure for the highest affinit y difference 
estimate of -fold (  mg;  mg/kg). No additional safety  factor was added to the 
affinit y-adjusted calcu lation because a linear adjustment is expected to be a co nservat ive approach. 
Based on the model from the mouse efficacy data, this dose has the potenti al to have antitumor 
activit y in humans. The calculated safet y mu
ltiple for the -mg (  mg/kg) dose is -fold 
based on the NOAEL of  mg/kg/week in the repeat -dose monkey study without accounting for 
affinit y differences. In addit ion, a staggered dosing (sentinel subject) approach will be used in the 
first dose cohort as described in Secti on 3.1.2 .
 The top dose of  mg ( mg/kg) is pro jected to 
have the potential for  to  TGI from the most sensit ive model in mouse. 
1.1.8.4 Part B —Relatlimab Dose
The  mg dose selected for this expansi on phase is based on recent safet y, PK and PD data 
obtained from subjects treated withrelatlimab monotherapy  in the CA224 020 and CA224022 
studi es in solid tumors and hematol ogical  malignanc ies, respectively . 
The treatm ent with relatlimab atdoses between  and mghas been well tolerated and the

The starti ng doses for Part C were selected based on all nonclinical data available from studies of 
the combinat ion and relatlimab monotherapy  and on emerging clinical safet y and pharmacokinet ic 
data from Study  CA224 020 where relatlimab was administered in co mbinat ion with nivo lumab in 
subjects wi th advanced so lid tumors.
In the repeated dose GLP toxicology study, a dose of  mg/kg/week of relatlimab + 
mg/kg/week nivo lumab was considered the se verely  toxic dose in  of the animals (STD ; 
refer to Section 1.4.1.2 ).
The preliminary  PK of relatlimab is approximately dose proporti onal at dose range of  to 
mg. The PK of relatlimab and nivolumab do not appear to alter when given in combinat ion 
(refer to Section 1.4.1.4 ). 
The combination of relatlimab and nivolumab is currently tested in patients with advanced solid 
tumorsin the clinical Study  CA224 020. Preliminary  data analysis was perform ed on patients 
treated in combinat ion therapy, on CA224 020 as of .  patients received mg 
relatlimab and  mg nivolumab,  patients were treated with  mg relatlimab and  mg 
nivolumab and  patients received  mg relatlimab and mg nivo lumab. 
In cohort #1, subjects with advanced solid tumors were treated wit h  mg relatlimab and 
mg nivolumab. One patient with  cancer experienced anAE ofGrade 3 mucosa l 
inflammat ion days after the first administration of the treatment , which was considered a DLT. 
As a resul t, the cohort was expanded to  subjects, and  additional subjects were enrolled. 
However,  additional subject with  cancer discont inued study  drug due to disease 
progression prior to completion of theDLT period, andit was necessary to replace her with an 
additional subject (  subjects total). out of  evaluable patients treated with  mg relatlimab
and  m g nivo lumab were able to complete the DL T peri od wi thout any  relevant AE. 
Nine patients were treated in cohort #2 (  mg relatlimab /  mg nivolumab) . Study  drug was

of  m g relatlimab combined wit h  m g nivo lumab is deemed safe and escalat ion to a dose of 
 mg relatlimab and  m g nivo lumab is co mmencing.
As mentioned previously, a dose of  mg/kg/week of relatlimab +  mg/kg/week nivolumab 
was considered the . Known human nivolumab PK param eters were used to cal culate the 
HED. The same approach to ident ifying human equivalent doses as described for monotherapy 
was used. With an added -fold safet y factor, the MRSD based on the  is  mg/kg in 
humans. The starting nivolumab dose for subjects in Part B is  mg (mg/kg), which is the 
flat dose equivalent of the dose selected for the global Phase 3 program (  mg/kg) which has bee n 
well tolerated in monotherapy .14
Taken together, pre-clinical and the preliminary safet y data suggest that  mg relatlimab in 
combinat ion with  mg nivolumab issafe and well tolerated dose inpatients with advanced 
malignancies . Therefore, the proposed starti ng dose f or Part C i s  mg (  mg/kg) relatlimab in 
combinat ion with  mg nivolumab (  m g/kg) is not expected to be toxic . At no point will the 
dose of relatlimab administered in combi nation with nivo lumab (Part C) exceed doses of relatlimab
that have been dem onstrated previ ously  to be safe on the m onotherapy  dose escalati on/expansi on
arms(Part A and B ). 
In Part C, the sequent ial infusion of both drugs will start withnivolumab admini strati on first 
followed by infusio n of relatlimab . 
1.1.8.6 Part D - Dose Expansion - Combination of Relatlimab and Nivolumab 
In Part D, cohort expansio n, relatlimab and nivolumab will be administered at the combinat ion 
doses selected for Part C, and may represent the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), maximu m 
administered dose (MAD), or an alternat ive dose sel ected from dose escalat ion Part C. The selected 
dose may not exceed the MTD/MAD established in Part C. Study  therapy will be administered 
with infusio n of nivolumab first fo llowed by relatlimab administration.
1.2 Research Hypothesis
It is anticipated that antiLAG -3 antibody  (relatlimab ), administered as monotherapy or in 
combinat ion with nivolumab ,will demonstrate adequate safet y and tolerabili ty, as well as a 
favorable risk/benefit profile, to support further clinical testing. No prospective hypotheses are 
being form ally eval uated.

1.4 Product Development Background
Inform ation for nivolumab (BMS -936558, anti-PD-1 antibody ) and relatlimab (BMS -986016, 
anti-LAG -3antibody ) is provi ded in the sections below; additional details are provi ded in 
respective Invest igator Brochure s(IBs).14,58
1.4.1 Relatlimab (BMS -986016, Anti-LAG -3 Antibody)
1.4.1.1 Non-Clinical Pharmacology
The abilit y of relatlimab to bind recombinant human LAG -3 antigen was determined using Biacore 
and enzyme -linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Binding to human and primate LAG -3+ 
transfectants and to activated human or primate T cells was measured using flow cytometri c and 
Scatchar d analyses. Relatlimab binds to hum an LAG -3 with high affini ty (Kd,  nM), and 
inhibits the binding of LAG-3 to cells expressing its ligand, MHC class II (IC50,  nM). 
Relatlimab binds to cyno molgus LAG -3 on transfected CHO cells and on activated cyno molgus 
Tcells with a lower affinit y (EC50, nM) than to activated human Tcells. A high 
concentration of relatlimab , in the absence of secondary  co-stimulat ion, elicit s no measurable 
cytokine response from cultured human peripheral  blood cells nor does the drug mediate 
measurable antibody -dependent or complement -dependent killing of target Tcells. Relatlimab
prom otes the activat ion of an ant igen-specific m ouse T -cell hybridoma expressing human LAG -3 
in co-culture with an MHC class II-posit ive antigen-present ing cell. In addit ion, relatlimab
enhances activation of human T cells in superantigen stimulat ion assays when added alone or in 
combinat ion with nivolumab (antiPD-1 antibody). Detailed information can be found in the 
current version of t he relatlimab IB.58
1.4.1.2 Toxicity
The nonclinical toxico logy package for relatlimab consists of the fo llowing studi es: 
1)Four -Week Intermittent (QW) Intravenous Exploratory  Combinat ion Pharmacodynamic and 
Toxicit y Study  in Cyno molgus Monkeys with  Antibody (a precursor of the 
 antibody ) and Nivo lumab .
2)GLP -Com pliant Four -Week Intravenous Combinat ion Toxicity Study  in Cyno molgus 
Monkeys with a 6 -Week Recovery  with Relatlimab and Nivo lumab.
The key  resul ts were as foll ows:  
Single-agent relatlimab administered at up to 100 mg/kg/week did not resul t in adverse 
changes. 
Combined administrati on of relatlimab and nivolumab ( /kg/week, 
respectively ) resul ted in morbidityof  male out of  m onkeys on study  Day  From 
Days  to  this monkey presented with elevated body temperature, shivers, red or clear

remarkable gross necropsy  findings. Histopathological findings in this monkey included: 
slight lymphoplasmacyt ic inflammat ion of the choroi d plexus; minimal to moderate 
lymphohistocy tic inflammat ion of the vasculature of the brain parenchyma, meninges, 
spinal cord (cervical and lumbar); and minima l to moderate mixed cell inflammat ion of the 
epididymes, seminal vesicles and testes. Clinical pathology changes indicated decreases in 
red bl ood cell count, hem oglobin concentrati on and hematocri t whose cause was unclear, 
and an increase in fibrinogen correlating with the inflammat ion observed in the central 
nervous system (CNS) and male reproductive tract. 
Addit ional histopathological findings upon combinat ion admini strati on of relatlimab and 
nivolumab (  mg/kg/week, respect ively) were limited to minimal to slight 
non-reversible lymphoplasmacyt ic inflammat ion of the choroi d plexus in the brain in  of 
 remaining monkeys, and minimal lymphohist iocytic inflamm ation of the vasculature of 
the brain parenchyma in  of  remaining monkeys, whose reversibilit y could not be 
assessed.
NOAEL for single -agent relatlimab was considered to be  mg/kg/week (mean 
AUC[0 -168h] =  gh/mL); NOAEL for single -agent nivolumab was considered 
to be mg/kg/week (mean AUC[0
-168h] =  gh/mL); NOAEL for combinat ion 
of relatlimab and nivo lumab was not determined. 
However, the combinat ion therapy  was generally well tolerated and clinical signs of 
toxicity were observed in only  of 
 monkeys (approximately ). Therefore, 
mg/kg/week relatlimab /nivolumab (mean relatlimab
AUC[0 -168h] = μgh/mL; mean nivolumab AUC[0 -168h] =  μgh/mL) 
was considered the .
The doses administered (  mg/kg relatlimab and  mg/kg nivolumab) are  times 
higher than the maximum doses proposed for the current study.
3)GLP -Com pliant Tissue Cross Reactivit y Study  in Human and Select Cyno molgus Monkey 
Tissues with Relatlimab . 
Positive staining with relatlimab -FITC was observed in the plasma membrane or plasma 
membrane granules of mononuclear leukocytes of most human tissues, including lympho id 
tissues and hematopoe tic cells of the bone marrow. In addit ion, staining with relatlimab -
FITC was observed in the cytoplasm of the human pituitary endocrine cell epithelium. 
Although relatlimab is not expected to have access to the cytoplasmic co mpartment in vivo  
and the repea t-dose toxicology studies in monkeys showed no effects on the pituitary gland, 
these findings may  be of clinical significance and will be mo nitored. 
In Vitro Cytokine Release and Lymphocyte Act ivation Assessment with Relatlimab using 
Hum an Peri pheral Bl ood Mononucl ear Cells. 
Relatlimab did not induce cytokine release when presented to human PBMCs regardless of 
concentration, donor, or incubat ion time. The levels of cytokines observed were either at 
or near the assay lower limits of quantificat ion with no evidence of dose-dependence or 
pattern across donors  or were generally 
overl apping with cytokine levels from PBMCs incubated with negative controls (  
). 
Consistent with the lack o f cytokine release, there was no evidence that relatlimab induced 
 activation, as measured by surface expressio n of  and . Expressio n

levels of these markers on  cells following stimulation with relatlimab were 
similar to those observed up on stimulat ion with negative controls. 
Overall, these data indicate that relatlimab does not possess agonist ic potenti al to induce 
either  cellular act ivation or cy tokine release.
Refer to th e relatlimab IB,58for addit ional information regarding the nonclinical toxicity of 
relatlimab .
1.4.1.3 Nonclinical Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics
In accordance with regulatory  guidelines for biotechno logy-derived pharmaceut icals,59no 
metabo lism studi es with relatlimab have been conducted in animals. The expected in vivo 
degradation of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) is to small peptides and amino acids via biochemical 
pathways that are independent of cy tochrom e P450 enzym es.
Relatlimab demonstrated favorable PK properties in cyno molgus mo nkeys. Fro m bo th single -dose 
and repeat -dose IV PK studi es, relatlimab decay ed bi-exponent ially and the exposure was 
approximately  dose-proporti onal. The systemic clearance (CLTp) ranges from to 
mL/h/kg and a terminal  half-life (T-HALF)  to  hours. The volume of distributi on at 
steady  state (Vss) was  to  mL/kg, suggesting limited distribut ion outsi de the plasma. 
Antirelatlimab antibodies were detected in some monkeys but the presence of antirelatlimab
antibodies appeared to have no impact on relatlimab exposure.
1.4.1.4 Clinical Pharmacology
An interim determinat ion of relatlimab multiple dose PK was carried out using all available seru m 
concentration data from Studi es CA22402 0 and CA224022. Noncom partmental analysis was 
perform ed using concentration time data after the first dose (Cycle 1) and ninth dose (Cycle 3). In 
general, the Cmax and AUC( TAU) values over the first dosing interval increased approximately 
proporti onal to the increment in the relatlimab dose. Relatlimab accumulat ion from the first to 
ninth doses was around to fold for AUC (TAU ) and to fold for Cmax. Relatlimab
effective half-life was estimated to be approximately  to  days. The PK of relatlimab and 
nivolumab was not altered when given in co mbinatio n.
Relatlimab popul ation PK was best described by a 2-compart ment model with parallel linear and 
non
-linear CL. The linear porti on represents the FcRn -mediated CL, and non-linear component  
represents target -mediated CL. The linear CL was  L/day , and the volume of distribution in 
the central  compartm ent (VC) was  L. The Vmax was  mg/day, and the concentration that 
achieved  of Vmax (Km) was  g/mL.
Current ly available data sugge st that relatlimab monotherapy  exhibit s a low level of 
immunogenicit y, with  out of   subjects having at l east 1 post -baseline posit ive ADA sam ples. 
There are limited data available in co mbinat ion cohort to make inference on immunogenicit y rate.

1.7 Nivolumab (BMS -936558, Anti-PD-1 Antibody)
1.7.1 Nonclinical Pharmacology
Nivo lumab is a fully human, IgG4 (kappa) isoty pe monoclonal  antibody  that binds to PD-1 wit h 
nano molar affinit y (Kd, nM) and a high degree of specificit y, thus precluding binding to its 
. Nivo lumab does not bind to other related family members, such as 
. Nonclinical testing of nivolumab dem onstrated that binding to 
 resul ts in enhanced  and release of  in 
vitro. Addi tional details are provided in the current versio n of the nivo lumab IB.14
1.7.2 Toxicity
Toxicology  studies in cyno molgus monkeys revealed that nivolumab was well tolerated at doses 
up to  mg/kg given twice weekly for  doses. Drug -related findings were limited to a reversible 
decrease in triiodothy ronine (T3) by  , wi thout concomi tant abnorm alities in other m arkers of
thyroid functi on. Addi tional details are provided in the current version of the nivo lumab IB.14
Preliminary new nonclinical safet y findings of adverse pregnancy  outcom es and infant losses in 
the absence of overt maternal toxicity have been reported.60The findings of increased late-stage 
pregnancy loss and early infant deaths/euthanasia in nivolumab -exposed pregnant monkeys 
suggest a potential ris k to human pregnancy if there is cont inued treatment with nivo lumab during 
pregnancy.
1.7.3 Nonclinical Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics

1.7.3.1 Clinical Pharmacology
Clinical Pharmaco logySingle dose pharmacokinet ics (PK) of nivo lumab was evaluated in subjects 
with multiple tum or types in CA209001, whereas mult iple dose PK is being evaluated in subjects 
in CA209003. In addition, a preliminary popul ation pharmacokinet ic (PPK) model has been 
developed wit h data from  subjects fro m CA209001, CA209002, and CA209003.

Single dose PK of nivolumab was evaluated in  subjects with multiple tumor types in Study 
CA209001 inthe dose range of  mg/kg. The median Tmax across single doses ranged 
from  hours with individual values ranging from  hours. Geometric mean Cmax and 
AUC(INF) of nivol umab administered at dosages of  m g/kg,  m g/kg,  m g/kg, and mg/kg 
demonstrated approximate dose proporti onali ty. Geom etric mean clearance (CL), after a single 
intravenous (IV) dose, ranged from  to  mL/h/kg, while mean volume of distribut ion 
during the terminal phase (Vz) varied between  to  mL/kg across doses. There was moderate 
variabilit y in PK parameters among subjects, with coefficient of variat ion (CV) of  in 
Cmax,  in AUC(INF),  in clearance, and  in Vz. The mean 
terminal eliminat ion half-life of nivolumab is  days, which is consistent with half-life of 
endogenous IgG4, indicat ing that the eliminat ion mechanism or nivolumab may be similar to IgG4.  
Both eliminat ion and distribut ion of nivo lumab appear to be independent of dose in the dose range 
studied. Addit ional details are provided in the nivo lumab IB.14
A preliminary  PPK model was devel oped by nonlinear mixed effect modeling using data from 
subjects from CA209001, CA209002 and CA209003. Clearance (CL) of nivolumab is 
independent of dose in the dose range (  mg/kg) and tumor types studied. The body weight  
norm alized dosing produces approximately  constant trough concentrations over a wide range of 
body  weights, and hence is appropriate for future clinical trials of nivo lumab.
1.7.3.2 Clini cal Safety and Activity
Nivo lumab has been studied in approximately  subjects and is widely approved in mult iple 
indicat ions. Extensive details on the safet y profile of nivo lumab are available in the IB,14and will 
not be repeated herein.
Overall, the safety  profile of nivolumab monotherapy  as well as combination therapy  is 
manageable and generally consistent across completed and ongoing clinic al trials with no MTD 
reached at any dose tested up to  mg/kg. Most AEs were low -grade (Grade 1 to 2) with relat ively 
few related high-grade (Grade 3 to 4) AEs. There was no pattern in the incidence, severit y, or 
causalit y of AEs wi th respect to nivoluma b dose l evel.
A pattern of immune -related adverse events has been defined, for which management al gorithms 
have been developed; these are provided in Appendix 4. Most high -grade events were manageable 
with the use of corticosteroi ds or horm one replacem ent therapy  (endocrinopathies) as instructed 
in these algorithms. For addit ional material, see the nivo lumab IB.14
The safet y of nivolumab in combinat ion with other therapeuti cs is being explored in several 
ongoing clinical trials. The most advanced combinat ion under development is nivolumab and 
ipilimumab in subjects with  Thus far, the combinat ion of both agents results in a safet y 
profile wit h similar types of AEs as either agent alone, but in so me cases, with a greater frequenc y 
and a higher rate of Grade 3 and 4 AEs than either ipilimumab or nivolumab alone. The safet y 
profile of nivolumab + ipilimumab combinat ion therapy was consis tent wit
h the mechanisms of 
action of nivo lumab and ipilimumab. A dose of  mg/kg n  mg/kg ipilimumab exceeded 
the MTD, and both  mg/kg  mg/kg ipilimumab and  mg/kg  mg/kg 
ipilimumab were ident ified as the MTD. For nivoluma b monotherapy  and combinat ion therapy ,

(Secti on 3.4.4 )
Nivo lumab has demonstrated clinical activit y as monotherapy  in subjects with a  v ariety of 
maligna ncies including  
 
.
Nivo lumab is current ly indicated for the treatm ent of patients with unresectable or metastati c 
melano ma as both monotherapy  and in combinat ion with ipilimumab. Nivo lumab is also approved 
for non -small cell lung cancer following failure on or after pl atinum based therapy , as well  as for 
advanced renal cell carcino ma following treatm ent wi th an ant i-angiogenic therapy
Nivo lumab has demonstrated clinical activi ty in a completed Phase 1 study  in subjects with 
advanced Hodgkin’s lympho mas (n=23). The response rate was 87%, with complete responses 
docum ented in 4 patients (17%) and partial response observed in 16 pa tients (70%). The safet y 
profile was consistent with prior clinical trials.Serious AEs were documented in 12 patients (53%). 
Drug related grade 3 AEs were reported in 5 patients (22%), and no grade 4 or 5 drug related 
adverse events have been observed61.
1.8 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
Subjects who have advanced hematol ogical malignancies have poor prognosis and few curat ive 
options.
Administrati on of relatlimab in pre-clinical models, was able to significant improve anti-tumor 
responses and increase survival in aggressive lympho ma models (see Secti on 1.1.6 ). Thus 
administration of relatlimab is considered a promising strategy  to improve anti-tumor activi ty in 
patients affected by  advanced hematol ogical malignancies.
Nivo lumab has demonstrated clinical activity in subjects with advanced HL, NSCLC, RCC, 
melano ma, and other tumors. Treatment related adverse events (AEs) include those associ ated with 
autoimmune activation, such as pneum onitis, thyro iditis, hepat itis, nephrotoxicit y, adrenal 
insufficiency, and less co mmo nly neurotoxicit y and myocardit is.Risk/benefit will be discussed in 
this section based on adverse events observed in both CA224 022 and CA224 020, a clinical trial 
evaluat ing the combinat ion of relatlimab and n ivolumab in subjects with so lid tumors.

spinal cord) was reported at the highest doses of antiP

reported with ant i-LAG -3 ant ibody  alone (either the  mg/kg or  mg/kg [highest] dose). These 
include nonspecific histopathology  changes, without clinical manifestati ons in all but one of the 
animals treated with combination therapy , which have been observed in other studi es with 
antibodies and small molecules in monkeys. Three subjects across both clinical trials, have 
experienced treatm ent related and immune mediated aseptic meningit is that have responded to

immunosuppressive therapy . Vigilance regarding the communicat ion and evaluat ion of potenti al 
neuro logic toxi city remains an ongoing pri ority.
Therapy  with relatlimab and nivo lumab is invest igational and it is possible that a higher incidence 
of immune mediated- adverse events may occur with the combinat ion of 2  antibodies targeting 
Tcells. The immune -related Grade 4myocardi tis event ,observed in the CA224 020 study , 
prom pted closer monitoring of subjects with ECGs and troponins, as well as tighter eligibilit y 
criteria regarding baseline ejecti on fraction and history  of cardi ovascular disease. Unant icipated 
side effects events may also occur, like the Grade 4 VF that was also repor ted in combinat ion 
therapy , Part B. in the CA224 020 study .There were several confounding factors in this case but, 
in the absence of a clear etiology, the event was considered treatm ent-related. In the setting of 
tropon in surveillance, three cases of Grade 1 myocardit is have been docum ented and managed 
without progression to subsequent cardiac dysf uncti on. Adverse events and SAEs will cont inue to 
be reviewed expedit iously by the Medical Monitor, investigators and the Pharmacovigil ance group 
to monitor saf ety.Specific SAE narratives including the Grade 4 ventricular fi brillation event and 
the Grade 4 myocardi tis event are included in the relatlimab IB.58
The types of treatment -related AEs, as well as the rates of treatm ent-related AEs, appeared 
comparable to hi storical nivolumab monotherapy  rates. All treatm ent-related AEs, except for the 
Grade 4 myocardi tis ( m g relatlimab  mg nivo lumab Q2W) and the Grade 4 potential drug 
induced liver injury (  mg relatlimab /  m g nivol umab Q2W), were reversible and manageable 
by withho lding study  treatm ent administration, providing standard medical care, and/or fo llowing 
immune -related AE al gorithms.
There is risk associ ated wi th tumor bi opsies, including bleed ing, infect ion, and pain. While there 
is no direct benefit to subjects who undergo these procedures, there is significant potenti al that 
data generated from these samples will guide the further development of these compounds and 
may be of direct benefi t for others wi th advanced solid tum ors.   
 
The potential direct benefit to subjects who participate in the CA224022 study  is that both single-
agent and combined therapy wit h these investigational agents may result in a greater proportion o f 
subjects with stabilization of disease, object ive response, or increased durati on of response than 
those observ ed with nivolumab monotherapy . It is also possible that combinat ion therapy  may 
reverse LAG -3 mediated T cell exhausti on and achiev e responses in 1) DLBCL, which is known 
to respond poorly  to anti -PD-1 or anti -PD-L1 therapy; 2) HL that was refractory  to or progressed 
after anti-PD-1 therapy . In fact, partial and complete responses as defined by the 2007 Internat ional 
Working Group (IWG) Response Criteria for Malignant Lympho ma62(Appendix 1)have been 
observed wit h relatlimab monotherapy  and in combinat ion with nivo lumab, both in the anti
-PD-1
naive as well as in the ant i-PD-1 resi stant setting. Thus, the potenti al for direct benefi t in subjects 
with few if any al ternative treatm ent opti ons warrants continued evaluation of the combinat ion in 
the Phase 1/2a clinical setting, including evaluating potential response rates in specific tumor and 
prior anti -PD-1 defined expansion cohorts at combinat ion doses shown to be tolerated.

anti-PD-1, anti -PD-L1, anti -CD1 37, anti -CD20, alemtuzumab, and/or anti-CD30 antibody therapy are allowed . 
Subjects will co mplete up to 4 periods of the study: Screening (up to 28 days), Treatment (up to
a maximum of twelve 8-week cycles of study therapy ), Clinical Follow -up(135 days following 
the last dose of study drug; and Survival Follow
-up(up to 5years fo llowing the first dose of study 
drug) .WOCBP will have addi tional follow
-up assessments through Day  165 for hom e pregnancy 
tests.Survival fo llow-up will be conducted for HL pati ents in Part C and D only, if appropriate.
The Treatment Period consists of up to twelve 8-week treatm ent cycles. Each treatm ent cycle 
comprises 4 doses of relatlimab administered on Days . Subjects will be allowed 
to continue study  therap y until the first occurrence of either: (1) meet ing criteria for 
discontinuat ion as described in
 Section 4.3.5 , (2) com pletion of the maximum number of twelve 
 cycles, (3) confirmed progressive disease (PD), or (4) clinical deterioration. Subjects who 
discontinue treatm ent will enter a 135-day Clinical Follow - UpPeriod.After completion of the 
Clinical Follow -Up period , HL patients in Parts C and D will enter the Survival Follow -Up 
period . For parti cipants who di scont inue study  treatm ent pri or to di sease progressi on, diagnosti c 
imaging will be obtained every 6 months after the fi rst clinical follow-up in year 1 and in year 2, 
and annually thereafter for a total of 5 years maximum (since the first dose of the study drug) until 
disease progressi on.Re-Challenge may be conducted in selected cases at progression.
If subjects progress during the clinical follow-up period or the survival follow-up period, they
could further receive therapy  with relatlimab aloneor in combinat ion with nivoluma b 
(Re-C hallenge period) as l ong as the risk:benefit ratio is considered favorable by the Investi gator 
and theMedical Monitor and eligibilit y criteria is met (Section 3.3). The original  dose and schedule
and protocol  rules woul d apply accordingly . Thus, subjects could receive therapy  for up to 
additional eight-week cycles. Subjects will not be re-challenged a second time. Collection of 
archival tissue (baseline) and tumor biopsies (base line and on-treatm ent) will be optional for 
subjects enrolled for re -challenge. PK and bio marker monitoring will be limited (Sections 5.5and

3.1.1 Part A -Dose Escalation
In Part A, a 3 + 3 + 3 design will be used to assess the safet y of relatlimab .The dose levels 
evaluated during dose escalat ion are provi ded in Table 3.1.1 -1. Dose escalation rules are outlined 
below. Three subjects will initially be treated in each dose cohort; in Dose Cohort 1, the first 
3subjects will be designated as sentinel subjects and will begin treatm ent at least 5 days apart. 
Subjects in subsequent cohorts will not be required to observe the 5-day interval betw een treatm ent 
start dates. 
Dose escalation will be based on the number of DLTs experi enced during the DLT evaluat ion 
interval  as determined by the Medical Moni tor and Investi gators (see Secti on 3.1.3 for DLT 
criteria). The DLT evaluation interval begins on the first day of treatment and continues for 
8weeks, ie, through Day  of the first cy cle.Subjects who receive at least 1dose of  study  drug 
during the 8-week evaluation interval will be considered evaluable for DLT determinat ion. In 
consultation wit h Invest igators, the Sponsor has the option to invest igate dose levels intermediate 
to those defined in the protocol. 
Dose esc alation in Part A (Table 3.1.1 -
1) will proceed as fo llows:
If none of the first  evaluable subjects in a dose cohort experiences a DLT within the DLT 
evaluat ion interval , then the next 
 subjects will be treated at the next higher dose cohort. 
If 1 of the first  evaluable subjects in a cohort experiences a DLT within the DLT evaluat ion 
interval , then  addi tional subjects will be treated in that dose cohort. 
If no more than  of the first  evaluable subjects experiences a DLT during the DLT 
evaluat ion interval, then the next  subjects will be enro lled at the next higher dose cohort. 
If  of the first  evaluable subjects in a cohort experience a DLT, that cohort will be 
expanded to  evaluable subjects. 
If  of the first  evaluable subjects,  of the first  evaluable subjects, or  of the first 
evaluable subjects in a cohort experience a DLT within the DLT evaluat ion interval, that 
dose level will  have exceeded the MTD and dose escalat ion will be terminated.

Invest igators, the Sponsor has the option to expand any cohort previously established to be safe in 
order to obtain addit ional experience or to investigate dose l evels intermediate to those defined in 
the protocol. Dose escalat ion rules (cohort size, DLT evaluat ion interval, cohort expansion criteria, 
etc.) will apply  to the additional cohorts. A maximum of  subjects will be enrolled in any 
additional dose cohorts .
3.1.2 Part B -  mg Cohort Expansion
The purpose of this cohort expansio n is to gather addit ional safety , tolerabilit y, PK, and 
pharmacodynamic informat ion regarding relatlimab dosed at  m g. 
The dose selected for Part B has not exceed edthe MTD in Part A (see rationale for dose selectio n 
in Section 1.1.8.4 ).
Four expansio n cohorts will be restricted to the tumor types listed in Figure 3.1-1and Table 3.1.2 -
1. Continuous evaluat ion of toxicity events will be assessed throughout enrol lment in the 
expansio n cohorts. If, at any  time, the aggregate rate of treatm ent-related toxi cities meet ing DLT 
criteria exceeds  across all subjects treated in Part B cohort expansio ns, the findings will be 
discussed with the Medical Moni tor and Invest igators; further enrollment may be interrupted. 
Depending on the nature and grade of the toxicity and after assessing the risk/benefit ratio, the 
dose for all or for select cohorts may be reduced.

3.1.3 Part C -Dose E scalation Combination Therapy
As in Part A, a 3 + 3 + 3 design will also be used in Part C to assess the safet y of relatlimab given 
in combinat ion with nivolumab as a sequential  infusi on. A fourth subject may be enrolled at the 
beginning of a  dose escalation cohort following agreement between the Invest igator and the 
Sponsor/Medical Moni tor, if subject is able to start the first day of dosing within approximately 
one week of the third subject in the same dose escal ation cohort.
The dosages during dose escalat ion are provi ded in Table 3.1.3 -1.

Treatment in Part C will be init iated after the decision is made to escalate to the fourth dose cohort 
(  m g ant i-Lag-3 in co mbinat ion with  m g ant i-PD-1) in CA224020 study . At no point will 
the dose of relatlimab administered in combinat ion wit
h nivolumab (Part C) exceed doses of 
relatlimab that have been dem onstrated previ ously to be safe on the m onotherapy  dose escal ation 
arm (Part A). The escalation cohorts in Part C will be restricted to subjects with HL(naive to anti -
PD-1/PD -L1 or whose disease progresses while -on or wi thin 3monthsof treatment with ant i-PD-
1 or anti -PD-L1 ant ibody )and DLBCL.
Dose escalat ion in Part Cwill proceed as described for Part Awith the except ion that the DLT 
observat ion period will be reduced from 8 weeks to 4 weeks. The rationale for the shorter 
observati on peri od is presented in Section 3.1.6.1 .If no MTD is reached through Dose Cohort 3, 
then additional cohorts of relatlimab given in combinat ion with nivolumab may be considered 
based on the aggregate safet y experience during dose escalat ion. Enrollment of addit ional cohorts 
will be implemented upon consultation and agreement between Investigators and the Sponsor via 
a protoco l amendment.
Prior to decl aring the MTD (or MAD), and in consultation with Invest igators, the Sponsor has the 
option to expand any cohort previously established to be safe in order to obtain additional 
experience or to invest igate dose levels intermediate to those defined in the protocol. Dose 
escalat ion rules (cohort size, DLT evaluat ion interval, cohort expansio n criteria, etc.) will apply to 
these expanded or additional cohorts. A maximum of subjects will be enro lled in any addit ional 
or expanded dose cohorts.
After completion of the relatlimab (anti-LAG -3)  mg and nivolumab   mg cohort, the 
intermediate dose combinat ion of ant i
-LAG -3  mg and nivo lumab  mg was invest igated in 
Part C. The dose combinat ion ( mg anti -LAG -3/ mg nivo lumab) w as well -tolerated in Part 
C and therefore selected for Part D (expansio n).
No wi thin-subject dose escalat ions will be permitted. If a dose l evel is found to exceed the MTD, 
subjects enrolled in that dose level may be reduced to a lower dose following consu ltation and 
agreem ent between Invest igators and the Sponsor.

3.1.4 Part D - Dose Expansion Combination Therapy
The purpose of  cohort expansio n is to ga ther additio nal safet y, tolerabilit y, preliminary  efficacy, 
PK, and pharmacodynamic information in subjects treated wi th sequent ial infusio n of nivo lumab 
followed by  administrati on of  relatlimab . The doses sel ected f or Part Dwill not exceed the MTD 
(or MAD if no MTD is determined) in Part C, but may incorporate assessment of other data 
including toxicities,PK,and pharma codynamic data from Parts A, Band Cand from the 
CA224020 study. The dose selected can be chosen while addit ional Part C dose escalat ion cohorts 
continue to be explored .Doses to be considered may include doses intermediate to those evaluated 
in Part Cif recommended by the Investigators and the Sponsor. Theintermediate dose of relatlimab
(anti-lag-3)  mg and nivolumab  mg dose was well tolerated, and was thus selected for 
extensio n. Modeling may be used to help inform the selection of the combinat ion dose level to 
carry  forward in Part Dif a dose below the MTD is chosen. Three expansio n cohorts will be 
restri cted to the tum or ty pes listed in Table 3.1.4 -1. Continuous evaluat ion of toxicity events will 
be assessed throughout enroll ment in the expansi on cohorts. If, at any  time, t he aggregate rate of 
treatm ent-related toxicities meet ing DLT criteria exceeds  across all subjects treated in the 
Part D cohort expansio ns, the findings will be discussed with the Medi cal Monitor and 
Invest igators; further enrollm ent may be interrupted . Depending on the nature and grade of the 
toxicity and after assessing the risk:benefit ratio, the dose for all or for select cohorts may be 
reduced. See Section 8.1.3 .

3.1.5 Re-challenge in Dose Escalation (Part C) and Cohort Expansion (Part D)
If subjects progress during the clinical follow-up period or the survival follow-up period, they
could further receive therapy  with relatlimab alone or in combinat ion therapy (Re-challenge) as 
long as the ri sk:benefit rati o is considered favorable by  the Investi gator and the Medi calMoni tor 
and the following eligibilit y criteria are met: 1) Subject has confirmed disease progression; 2) 
Subject has not experienced relatlimab related adverse events leading to permanent 
discontinuat ion. The original dose andschedule of therapy and protocol  rules will apply . Thus 
subjects could receive therapy  for up to addit ional eight -week cycles. Subjects who are 
re-challenged and who subsequent ly have an objective response will not be included in the primar y 
analysis of efficacy. Responses to re -challenge will be evaluat ed in a separate analysis. Subjects

3.1.6 Dose -Limiting Toxicities
For the purpose of guiding decisio ns regarding dose escalat ion in Part A, dose-limit ing toxicity 
(DLT) will be determined based on the incidence, intensity, and durati on of AEs that are related 
to study  drug and that occur within 8 weeks of initiation of study drug (ie, the DLT evaluat ion 
interval  which begins on the first day  of treatm ent and ends on Day   of  the fi rst cy cle).
For the purpose of guiding decisio n in co mbinat ion dose escalat ion in Part C, dose -limit ing toxicity 
(DLT) will be determined based on the incidence, intensity, and durati on of AEs that are related 
to study  drug and that occur within 4 weeks of initiation of study drug (ie, the DLT evaluat ion 
interval  which begins on the first day  of treatm ent and ends on Day   of  the fi rst cy cle).
The severit y of AEs will be graded according to National  Cancer Institute (NCI) Commo n 
Termino logy Cri teria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0.
For the purpose of subject management, DLTs that occur at any time, whether during dose 
escalat ion (Part A or C) or cohort expansio n (Part B or D) will resul t in study  drug being held 
pending evaluat ion of the event’s relatedness to study  drug in accordance with Secti on 4.3.2 . 
Subjects must meet criteria for re-treatm ent prior to re-initiation of study treatment (see 
Secti on4.3.3 ).
3.1.6.1 Rationale for 4-week DLT Period in Part C
The identificat ion of acute dose limiting toxi cities that occur af ter administrati on of  a study  drug 
iscrucial  for the safet y of the patients enrolled in a clinical trial. The length of the DLT is usually 
established based on the availabilit y of pre-clinic al data. When clinical data are available, the 
risk/benefit evaluat ion used to define the appropriate DLT period must be reassessed and shoul d 
incorporate a critical analysis of all, clinical and pre- clinical data.
In Part C, the DLT peri od will be reduced from  weeks to  weeks in light of the availabili ty of 
preliminary clinical data from the 2 ongoing clinical studi es. This decisio n was made after 
reviewing the incidence of severe adverse event in monotherapy  and in combinat ion between 
Weeks to  and after Week  and the effect of a prolonged DLT on a populat ion with advance 
cancers, as reported below .
Correlation between A Esand duration of treatment 
The safet y profile of relatlimab as monotherapy is well manageable and generally  consistent across 
the 2 ongoing clinical studi es with no MTD reached at the  doses tested, up to  mg in dose 
escalat ion mo notherapy . Only  subject experienced a related high-grade AE (asymptom atic Grade 
3lipase increased),  days post the first administra tion of the study drug in CA224 020. There 
were no related SAEs reported in the monotherapy in eit her study .
A preliminary analysis of the clinical data from the combinat ion arm of Study  CA224020 in which 
 subjects were treated with relatlimab in co mbination wit h nivo lumab showed that there was no 
relationship between the incidence, severit y, or causalit y of AEs and the dose level of study drugs. 
Seven subjects received  mg relatlimab /  mg nivolumab, nine subjects were treated wit h  
mg relatlimab /  mg nivolumab and eight subjects received  mg relatlimab / mg nivo lumab.

Four acute treatment related AEs were observed (2 SAE and 2 AEs), three of them occurred during 
the first  weeks of treatm ent,  event occurred at Week 6 and no treatm ent rel ated AEs 
were docum ented after Week The treatm ent-emergent SAE reported at Week  (day  post 
first dose) was a Grade 4 ventricular fibrillat ion that occurred in a subject with  cancer th at 
receive  mg relatlimab /  mg nivolumab combinat ion therapy . The event occurred 
spontaneously while the subject was shopping, and CPR was administered by paramedics for 
10minutes. At the initial clinical assessment, the subject showed no evidence of coronary  artery 
abnorm ality, myocardi al infarct ion, myocardi tis, or pulmo nary embolism. A previ ous 
peri-infusio nal Holter electrocardi ogram  (ECG) recording on Cycle 1, Day 1 did not show an 
arrhy thmia. The subject’s history  of cannabino id ingest ion, tobacc o smoking, hypertensio n, 
chlorphenamine and caffeine use, and a prior episode of loss of consciousness were considered 
potenti al contribut ing factors for the event and suggested pre-existing cardiac disease or an 
arrhy thmia, but in the absence of a clearlyident ified etiology, contribution from relatlimab and 
nivolumab could not be excluded. Study  drug was discontinued, and defibrillator was successfully 
implanted. Of note, despite to possible immuno -related mechanism, the patient never received 
steroi ds fo r the treatm ent of this AE. The subject has fully recovered with no sequelae and achieved 
a complete response after  doses of study  drug. Due to the important rol e that the cannabino ids 
may have had is this event, the use of cannabino ids is now part of the exclusio n criteria 
Effects of prolonged DLT period in a population with advanced cancer 
The target populat ions for phase 1/2a oncol ogy studies are characterized by a high frequency  of 
patients wi th advanced stage disease. As a consequence, a relevant group of patients will progre ss 
rapidly after initiation of study drug. Across the 2 ongoing studi es with relatlimab , administered 
as monotherapy  or in combinat ion with nivolumab,  of the subjects enrolled in dose 
escalat ion cohorts experienced disease progressi on between Weeks 4 and 8 of the DLT period 
while only  of the subjects progressed between Week s 1 and 4. It is important to note 
that a subject that progresses during the DLT period is no longer evaluable for the purposes of 
safet y adjudicat ion and a new repla cement subject must be enrolled at the same dose in order to 
complete the safet y evaluat ion at that dose level. As a consequence, to date, nine addit ional patients 
have been exposed to safe but clinical suboptimal doses of relatlimab alone or in co mbinat ion with 
nivolumab. 
In summary, the review of the safet y data from the 2 ongoing studi es strongly suggests that a 
4weeks DLT period will provi de an appropri ate window to capture the acute, treatm ent related 
AEs and to ensure the safet y of the patients enrolled in this clinical trial. Furtherm ore will limit s 
the number of patients exposed to safe but suboptimal doses of the drugs due to progressive disease 
between Week s4 and 8.
Hepati c, non -hematol ogic, and hematol ogic DLTs are defined separately  as outline d bel ow.

3.3.3 Women of Childbearing Potential
A wom an of childbearing potenti al (WOCBP) is defined as any female who has experi enced 
menarche and who has not undergone surgical sterilizat ion (hysterectomy or bilateral 
oophorectomy ) and is not postm enopausal . Menopause is defined as 12 m onths of  amenorrhea in 
a wom an over age 45 in the absence of other biological or physio logical  causes. In additional, 
wom en under the age of 55 must have a serum follicle stimulating horm one (FSH) level
> 40 mIU/mL to confirm menopause.
Females treated with horm one replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The durati on of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators should use their 
judgement in checking serum  FSH levels. If the serum  FSH level is >40 mIU/mL at any time 
during the washout per iod, the woman can be considered postmenopausal.
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products, (rings, creams, gels) .
4 week minimum for transdermal products .
8 week minimum for oral products .

3.4.1 Prohibited and/or Restricted Treatments
The fo llowing m edicat ions are prohibited during the study :
Immunosuppressive agents unless they are utilized to treat an AE or as specified in 
Secti on3.4.3 .
Concurrent administration of any anticancer therapi es (invest igational or approved) with the 
exception of subjects in the survival period of the study .
Use of allergen hyposensit ization therapy .
Use of growth factors unless prior discussion and agreement with BMS Medical Monitor .
Use of cannabis or other recreational drugs .
Any live/attenuated vaccine (eg, varicella, zoster, yellow fever, rotavi rus, oral polio and 
measles, mumps, rubella [MMR]) during treatment and unt il 100 days post last dose.
Palliat ive radiotherapy is permitted only under certain condit ions as described in Sect ion 3.4.3 .
3.4.2 Other Restrictions and Precautions
3.4.2.1 Vaccinations
Any vaccination containing attenuated or inact ivated virus may be permitted if clinically indicated. 
However, this must be discussed and docum ented with the BMS Medical Moni tor prior to 
administration and may requi re a study  drug washout peri od pri or to an d after administrati on of 
the vaccine. Inactivated influenza vaccinat ion will be permitted on study  without restri ction. Any 
vaccination containing live virus is prohibited.
3.4.2.2 Imaging Restrictions and Precautions
It is the local imaging facilit y’s responsibi lity to determine, based on subject attributes (eg, allerg y 
history , diabetic history  and renal  status), the appropri ate imaging modality and contrast regimen 
for each subject. Imaging contraindicat ions and contrast risks shoul d be considered in this 
asses sment. Subj ects wi th renal insufficiency should be assessed as to whether or not they  should 
receive contrast and if so, what type and dose of contrast is appropriate. Specific to MRI, subjects 
with severe renal insufficiency (ie, estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] 
< 30 mL/min/1.73 m2) are at increased risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis. MRI contrast should 
not be given to this subject populat ion. In addition, subj ects are excluded from MRI if they have 
tattoos, metallic implants, pacemakers, et c.
The ultimate decisio n to perform MRI in an individual subject in this study  rests with the site 
radiologist, the invest igator and the standard set by the local Ethics Committee.

3.4.3 Permitted Therapy
Subjects are permitted the use of topical, ocular, intra-articular, intranasal, and inhalat ional 
corticosteroi ds (with minimal systemic absorpti on). Immunosuppressive agents and the use of 
systemic corticosteroi ds are permitted in the context of treating AEs, prophylaxis prior to a 
diagnosti c procedure (eg contrast MRI/CT scans) or as specified in Section3.4.4 . A brief course 
of corticosteroi ds for prophylaxis (eg, contrast dye allergy) is permitted after discussion with the 
BMS Medical Monitor. 
Subjects m ay continue to receive HRT.
Oral antiviral therapy  (acycl ovir or equivalent) may be required to reduce the risk o f herpes zoster 
reactivat ion. Discussio n with medical monitor is requi red for any subject planned to receive oral 
anti-viral therapy.
Palliat ive and supportive care for disease -related symptom s may be offered to all subjects on the 
trial; however, Invest igators should consul t with the BMS Medical Moni tor prior to initiating 
palliat ive radiat ion in subjects who have not yet completed the DLT evaluat ion interval (Part A).
The potenti al foroverl apping toxicities with radiotherapy  and relatlimab administered as 
monotherapy  or in combinat ion withnivolumab is current ly not known. Therefore, palliat ive 
radiotherapy  is not recommended while receiving any of  these drugs, al one or i n combinat ion.If 
palliat ive radiotherapy in short courses and for iso lated fields is required to control symptoms not 
clearly  related to disease progression, then drug administration should be withheld, if possible, for 
at least 1 week before radiation and for at least 2 weeks after its completion. Subjects shoul d be 
closely  monitored for any potenti al toxicity during and after receiving radiotherapy . Prior to 
resuming study  drug treatm ent, radi otherapy -related AEs shoul d resolve to Grade 1 or baseline 
and subjects mu st meet relevant eligibilit y criteria as determined by the BMS Medical Monitor in 
discussio n with the Invest igator. The BMS Medi cal Moni tor must be consulted prior to 
re-initiating treatment in a subject with a dosing interruption last ing > 6 weeks after t he last dose.
Details of palliat ive radiotherapy  should be documented in the source records and el ectronic case 
report form (CRF). Details in th e source records should include dates of treatment, anatomical site, 
dose administered and fractionation schedul e, and AEs. Symptom s requi ring palliat ive 
radiotherapy  shoul d be evaluated for object ive evidence of disease progression. Administration o f 
additional relatlimab, a s monotherapy  or in combinati on wi thnivolumab to subj ects who receive 
limited -field palliat ive radiation,shoul d follow guidelines specified in Section 4.3.5 . Subjects 
receiving palliat ive radiat ion of index lesio ns will have the evaluat ion of ORR just prior to 
radiotherapy  but such subjects will no longer be evaluable for determinat ion of response 
subsequent to the date palliat ive radiat ion occurs.
For subjects who need to undergo
elective surgery  (not tumor-related) during the study , it is 
recommended to hold study drug for at least 2 weeks before and 2 weeks after surgery, or until the 
subject recovers fro m the procedure, whichever is longer. Prior to resuming study drug treatmen t, 
surgi cally  related AEs shoul d resolve to Grade 1 or baseline and subjects must meet relevant

3.4.4 Treatment of Relatlimab or Nivolumab -Related Infusion Reactions
Since relatlimab and nivo lumab contain only human immunoglobulin protein sequences, they  are 
unlikely  to be immunogenic and induce infusio n or hy persensi tivity react ions. However, if such a 
reacti on were to occur, it might manifest with fever, chills, rigors, headache, rash, pruri tus, 
arthralgias, hypotensio n, hypertensio n, bronchospasm, or other allergic- like react ions. All Grade 
3 or 4 infusio n reacti ons shoul d be reported within 24 hours to the BMS Medical Moni tor and 
reported as an SAE if it meets the criteria. Infusio n reacti ons shoul d be graded according to NCI 
CTCAE versio n 4.0 guidelines. If a subject has an infusio n reaction with nivo lumab, the relatlimab
infusio n can be given (without prophylact ic med ications) if the infusio n reacti on resolves within 
3 hours. For scheduling purposes after a nivo lumab infusio n reaction, the relatlimab infusio n may 
be given the next day. Prophylact ic pre-infusio n medications shoul d be given prior to all 
subsequent nivo lumab infusio ns.
Treatment recommendations are provided below and may be modified based on local treatment 
standards and guidelines, as appropriate:
For Grade 1 symptoms (Mild reaction; infusion interruption not indicated; intervention not 
indicated):
Remain at bedside and monitor subject until recovery  from symptom s. The following 
prophylact ic prem edicat ions are recommended for future infusio ns: diphenhydramine 50 mg 
(or equivalent) and/or acetaminophen/paracetamol 325 to 1000 m g at l east 30 minutes before 
additional study  drug administrations.
For Grade 2 symptoms (Mod erate reaction requires therapy or infusion interruption but 
responds promptly to symptomatic treatment [eg, antihistamines, non-steroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, narcotics, corticosteroids, bronchodilators, IV fluids]; 
prophylactic medications indicated for ≤ 24 hours).
Stop the infusio n, begin an IV infusio n of normal saline, and treat the subject with

Please refer to Appendix 4 for a com plete list of the Nivolumab Management Algorithms.
3.5 Discontinuation of Subjects from Treatment
Subjects MUST discont inue invest igational product (and non-invest igational product at the 
discreti on of  the invest igator) for any o f the following reasons:
Subject’s request to stop study  treatm ent.
Any clinical AE, laboratory  abnorm ality or intercurrent illness which, in the opinio n of the 
Invest igator, indicates that continued participat ion in the study  is not in the best interest of the 
subject .
Pregnancy .
Terminat ion of the study  by BMS .
Loss of ability to freely  provide consent through imprisonment or involuntarily incarceration 
for treatm ent of either a psychiatric or physical (eg, infect ious disease) illness . (Note: Under 
specific circumstances, and only in countries where local regulat ions permit, a participant who 
has been imprisoned may be permitted to continue as a participant. Strict condit ions apply and 
BMS a pproval  is requi red).
Inabilit y to com ply wi th protocol  requi rements .
Progressive disease (PD; see also Secti on 4.3.4 for details regar ding continuing treatm ent 
beyo nd init ial assessment of PD) .
Clinical deterioration as assessed by  the invest igator .
Protocol -defined reasons for discont inuat ion (Section 4.3.5) .

All subjects who discontinue invest igational product should comply with protocol -specified 
follow-up procedures as outlined in Secti on 5. The only excepti on to thi s requirement is when a 
subject withdraws consent for all study  procedures including post-treatm ent study  follow-
up or 
loses the abilit y to consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or invo luntarily incarcerated for the treatment 
of either a psychiatric or physical  illness ).
If study  treatm ent is di scont inued prior to the subject’s completion of the study, the reason for the 
discontinuat ion must be docum ented in the subject’s medical records and entered on the 
appropriate CRF page.
3.6 Post Treatment Study Follow -Up
In this study , overall survival  is an exploratory endpo int of the study . Post-treatm ent study 
follow-up is of crit ical importance and is essent ial to preserving subject safet y and the integrit y of 
the study. Subjects who discont inue study  treatm ent must continue to be followed for collection 
of outcom e and/or survival fo llow-up data as required and in lin e with Secti on 5 until death or the 
concl usion of the study .The only except ion to this requi rement is when a subject withdraws 
consent for all study  procedures including post-treatment study  follow-up or loses the abilit y to 
consent freely (ie, is imprisoned or involuntarily incarcerated for the treatm ent of either a 
psychiatric or phy sical illness) .
3.6.1 Withdrawal of Consent
Subjects who request to discont inue study treatment will remain in the study and must continue to 
be followed for protocol specified follow
-up procedures. The only except ion to this is when a 
subject specifically  withdraws consent for any further contact with him/her or persons previously 
authori zed by subject to provide this informat ion. Subjects shoul d notify the investigator of the 
decisio n to withdraw consent from future follow-up in writing , whenever possible. The 
withdrawal  ofconsent should be explained in detail  in the medical records by  the invest igator, as 
to whether the withdrawal  is from further treatment with study  drug only or also from study 
procedures and/or post treatment study fo llow-up, and entered on the appropria te CRF page. In the 
event that vi tal status (whether the subject is alive or dead) is being measured, publicly available 
inform ation shoul d be used to determine vi tal status only as appropriately  directed in accordance 
with local law.
3.6.2 Lost to Follow -Up
Allreasonable efforts must be made to locate subjects to determine and report their ongoing status. 
This includes follow-up wi th persons authori zed by  the subject as noted above. Lost to foll ow-up 
is defined by the inabilit y to reach the subject after a mini mum of three docum ented phone calls, 
faxes, or emails as well as lack of response by subject to one registered mail letter. All attem pts 
shoul d be documented in the subject’s medical records. If it is determined that the subject has died, 
the site will use permissible local methods to obtain the date and cause of death.
If investigator’s use of third- party  representative to assist in the fo llow-up porti on of the study has 
been included in the subject’s informed consent, then the invest igator may use a Spons or-retained

4.1.1 Investigational Product
An invest igational product, also known asinvest igational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined a pharmaceut ical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference 
in a clinical study , including products already with a market ing authorization but used or 
assembled (formulated or packaged) different ly than the authori zed form, or used for an 
unauthori zed indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.
The invest igational product shoul d be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is 
the responsibilit y of the investigator to ensure that invest igational product is only dispensed to 
study  subjects. The invest igational product must be dispensed only from official study  sites by 
authori zed personnel according to local regula tions. 
In this protocol , investigational products are: relatlimab (BMS -986016) and nivolumab 
(BMS -936558).
4.1.2 Non-investigational Product
Other medications used as support or escape medication for preventative, diagnosti c, or therapeutic 
reasons, as componen ts of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be considered as 
non
-invest igational products. 
In thi s study , non -invest igational product(s) are not applicable. 
4.1.3 Handling and Dispensing
The product storage manager shoul d ensure that the study  drug is stored in accordance with the 
environmental condi tions (temperature, light, and humidit y) as determined by BMS. If concerns 
regarding the qualit y or appearance of the study drug arise, the study drug should not be dispensed 
and contact BMS immediately.
Invest igational product docum entati on must be maintained that includes all  processes requi red to 
ensure drug is accurately administered. This includes docum entati on of drug storage, 
administration and, as applicable, storage temperatures, reconst itution, and use of required 
processes (eg, required diluents, administration sets).
For treatm ent visits in Parts C, andD, where both relatlimab and nivolumab are administered, 
nivolumab will be administered first followed by relatlimab within 30minutes after completion of 
the nivo lumab infusio n.Nivo lumab infusion will be administered over 30 minutes. Further details 
regarding preparati on and administrati on will be provi ded separately in site/pharm acy training 
materi als.
For non -investigational product, if marketed product i s utilized, it shoul d be stored in accordance 
with the package insert, SmPC, or similar.
4.2 Method of Assigning Subject Identification
This is an open -label study . All subjects will be assigned a subject number upon providing signed 
written informed consent. The invest igative site will call into the enrollment option of the 
Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) designated by BMS for assignment of a 5 -digit subject 
number that will be unique across all sites. Enrolled subjects, including thosenot dosed, will be

assigned sequential subject numbers starting wi th . The 
patient ident ification number (PID) will ultimately be comprised of the site number and subject 
number. For example, the first subject scree ned (ie, enrolled) at site number 1, will have a PID of

separate document.
Once it is determined that the subject meets the eligibilit y criteria, the investig ative site will call 
the IVRS pri or to fi rst study drug administrati on for the subject to be either:
Assigned to a part (Parts A, D) and dose cohort in the dose escalat ion porti on of  the study .
Assigned to an expansio n cohort in the cohort expansio n porti on (Part B and D) of the study.
During dose escalat ion (Part A and C ), subjects who are not evaluable for DLT determinat ion ma y 
be replaced. Replacement subjects will  be assigned to the same dose cohort, but will be assigned 
a new subject number. 
4.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
4.3.1 Guidelines for Dose Modification
4.3.1.1 Intrasubject Dose Escalation
Intrasubject dose escalation o f relatlimab or nivo lumab is not permitted i n this study .
4.3.1.2 Dose Reductions
With the possible excepti on of  subjects bein g treated at a dose level that is subsequent ly deemed 
to exceed the MTD, intrasubject dose reduction of relatlimab or nivo lumab is not permitted.
4.3.2 Dose Delay Criteria
In some cases, the natural  history  of select AEs associ ated with immunotherapy  can differ from 
and be more severe than AEs caused by other therapeuti c classes. Early recogni tion and 
management may mit igate severe toxicit y. 
Guidance for Invest igators is provi ded in the current relatlimab and nivolumab Invest igator’s 
Brochures.58.14Addit ionally , management al gorithms have been developed to assist Investigators 
with select toxicit ies and can be found in Appendix 4

Toxicit ies for whi ch management al gorithms have been developed include:
Pulmo nary.
Gastrointestinal .
Hepati c.
Endocrine .
Renal .
Derm atologic.
Neurol ogic.

Subjects who experience the fo llowing must have all study  drugs(s) delayed :
Potenti al DLTs (per definit ion, are related to study drug) until DLT relatedness is defined.
Select drug -related AEs and drug- related laboratory  abnorm alities: 
  Grade 1 pneumonit is.
  Grade 1 myocardit is.
All troponin elevat ions require a dose delay to allow for prompt cardiac evaluation .
  Single grade increase shift from baseline (at least to Grade 2)of AST, ALT, and total 
bilirubin .
  Grade 2 creatinine .
  Grade 2 diarrhea or colit is.
  Grade 2 neurological AE .
Grade 4 amylase and/or lipase abnorm alities regardless of symptom s or clinical 
manifestations .
Any AE, laboratory  abnorm ality, or intercurrent illness, which in the judgment of the 
Invest igator, warran ts delaying the dose of study  medicat ion.
Subjects may be dosed no less than  days fro m the previous dose and no more than  days from 
scheduled dose. If an infusio n cannot be administered at a scheduled visit, it should be 
administered as soon as possi ble. Subsequent dosing visits will follow every  weeks after the 
delayed dose. A dose given more than  days after the intended dose date will be considered a 
delay. A maximum delay  of  weeks between doses is allowed. Longer delays may be allowed 
following discussion wit h the Medical Monitor. Subjects who meet criteria listed in Sect ion 4.3.5
are required to permanent ly discont inue study drug. All other subjects will be permitted to resume 
therapy  with study drug at the same dose level(s) following resolution of the AE as describe d in 
Secti on 4.3.3 .
4.3.3 Criteria to Resume Treatment after Dose Delay
Subjects will be permitted to resume therapy at the same dose level( s) following resol ution of the 
AE to Grade 1 or to baseline wi thin 6 weeks after l ast dose, wi th the exception of subjects who 
meet criteria for permanent discont inuat ion as specified in Section 4.3.5 .Subjects who meet 
criteria for permanent discont inuat ion shoul d receive no further study  therapy. The following 
exceptions apply:
If the toxi city resolves to Grade 1 or baseline > 6 weeks after l ast dose, but the subject does 
not otherwise meet the criteria for permanent discontinuation (see Section4.3.5 ), and the
Invest igator believes that the subject is deriving clinical benefit, then the subject may be 
eligible to resume the study  drug(s) following the approval of the BMS Medical Monitor.
Subjects with a Grade 4 drug -related amylase and/or lipase increase that i s not associated with 
symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreat itis can be restarted on therapy once the levels 
have recovered to grade 3 or less, and after consultation with the BMS Medical Monitor.

this evaluat ion, determinat ion of further treatm ent will be based on the discussio n with the 
BMS Medical Monitor or designee.
4.3.4 Treatment B eyond Disease Progression
Accumulat ing evidence indicates that a subset of subjects treated with immunotherapy may derive 
clinical benefit despite init ial evidence of PD .Participants treated with relatlimab + nivolumab or 
with relatlimab alone,will be permi tted to continue their study  treatm ent beyo nd initial 
investi gator assessment of progression ,provided the fo llowing cri teria are m et:
Subject is deriving clinical benefit as assessed by the Invest igator .
Disease progressi on is not rapi d as assessed by the Invest igator .
Subject continues to meet relevant eligibilit y criteri a as determined by the BMS Medi cal 
Moni tor in discussio n with the Invest igator .
Subject tolerates study  drug .
Subject has stable performance status .
Treatment beyond progressi on will not delay an imminent intervent ion to prevent serious 
complicat ions of disease progressi on (eg, CNS m etastases) .
Subjects have provided written informed consent prior to receiving addit ional study  drug .
The assessment of clinical benefit shoul d be balanced by clinical judgment as to whether the 
subject i s clinically  deteri orating and unlikely to receive any benefit fro m continued treatm ent. If 
the Invest igator feels that the subject continues to achieve clinical benefit by cont inuing treatment, 
the subject shoul d remain on the study  and continue to receive monitoring according to the Time 
and Events Schedule (Table 5.1-2). The decision to continue treatm ent shoul d be discussed with 
the BMS Medical Monitor and documented in the study  records.
Subjects that meet the above criteria and continue on study  therapy beyo nd initial PD. must

Since theconcept ion of this protocol , new response criteria known as Lugano 2014 c riteria 
(
Appendix 7) ha ve been devel oped to refine tumor metabolic response. A retrospective 
exploratory  assessment of tumor metabo lic response will be evaluated according to the Lug ano 
2014 criteria using the Deauville 5-point scale on Part D subjects with NHL or HL who had 
fluorodeoxy glucose ( FDG )-positron emissi on tomography  (PET)scans performed in the pre -
treatm ent period (defined as within 60 days before the first dose, providin g no other therapy 
wasgiven during this time) and during this study .   
For these PET-based assessments, a response of complete metabolic response (CMR), 
partial metabo lic response (PMR), no met abolic response , or progressive metabolic disease 
(PMD) will be determined. The PET scan metabolic uptake will be graded using the 
Deauville 5-point scale ,with a  score of 1, 2, or 3 considered to represent a CMR (see 
Appendix 7). Assessment swill be performed by PET scan with CT/MRI of diagnostic 
qualit y, with disease invo lvement determined by fo cal FDG uptake in nodal and extranodal 
lesions (including the spleenandliver)
.
Subjects with CLL will be evaluated using the 2008 IWG Response Criteria for CLL with 
Modificat ions64(Appendix 2) .Disease assessments for subjects with CLL will occur between 
Days  and  of each treatm ent cy cle (up to twelve 8 -week treatm ent cy cles) and at the

relatlimab and nivolumab should be collected after the end of relatlimab infusion (preferably within 2minutes prior 
to the end of infusion). If the end of infusion is delayed to beyond the nominal infusion d uration, the collection of 
this sample should also be delayed accordingly. EOI samples may not be collected from the same IV access as drug 
was administered; refer to the Laboratory Procedures Manual for additional restrictions.

6 ADVERSE EVENTS
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
preexist ing medical condition in a clinical investigation subject administered an investigational 
(medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a cau sal relationship with this treatm ent. 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (such as an abnorm al laboratory 
finding), symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of invest igational product, 
whether or not considered related to the invest igational product.
The causal relat ionship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to assess all 
adverse events (AE). The casual relat ionship can be one of the fo llowing:
Related: There is a reasonable causal relati onship between study  drug administration and the 
AE.
Not related: There is not a reasonable causal  relationship between study  drug administration 
and the AE. 
The term "reasonable causal relat ionship" means there is evidence to suggest a causal relat ionship. 
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended quest ioning, 
examinat ion, or evaluat ion of a subject. Care should be taken not to introduce bias when co llecting 
AE and/or SAEs. Inquiry about specific AEs should be guided by clinical judgement in the context 
of known adverse events, when appropriate for the program or protocol. 
6.1 Serious Adverse Events
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
resul ts in death .
is life-threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of 
the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused death if it were 
more severe).
requi res inpat ient hospitalization or causes prolongation of exist ing hospitalization (see NOTE
below) .
resul ts in persistent or significant disabilit y/incapaci ty.
is a congenital ano maly/birth defect .
is an important medical event (defined as a medical event(s) that may not be immediately life -
threatening or resul t in death or hospi talizat ion but, based upon appropriate medical and 
scientific judgment, may jeopardi ze the subject or may requi re intervent ion [eg, medical, 
surgi cal] to prevent one of the other serious outcomes listed in the definit ion above.) Examples 
of such events include, but are not limi ted to, intensive treatm ent in an em ergency room  or at 
home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasi as or convulsio ns that do not result in 
hospi talizati on.) Potenti al drug induced liver injury  (DILI) is also considered an important 
medical event. (See Section 6.6for the definit ion of potenti al DILI.) .

Suspected transmission of an infectious agent (eg, pathogenic or nonpathogenic) via the study  drug 
is an SAE.
Although pregnancy , overdose, cancer, and potent ial drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not 
always serious by regulatory  definit ion, these events must be handled as SAEs. (See Section 6.1.1
for reporting pre gnancies).
NOTE : 
The fo llowing hospi talizati ons are not consi dered SAEs in BMS clinical studies: 
a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department < 24 hours, that does not result 
in admissio n (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event) .
elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent .
admissio ns as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure .
routi ne healt h assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (eg, 
routi ne col onoscopy ).
medical /surgi cal admissi on other than to rem edy ill healt h and pl anned pri or to entry  into 
the study . Appropri ate docum entati on is requi red in these cases.
admissio n encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health status 
and requi res no medical/surgical interventi on (eg, lack of  housing, economic inadequacy, 
caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason).
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or not 
related to study  drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associ ated with protocol -
specified procedures. All SAEs must be co llected that occur during the screening period and within 
135 day s of discont inuat ion of dosing or until starting a new ant i-neoplast ic treatment (whichever 
occurs first). If applicable, SAEs must be collected that relate to any later protocol -specified 
procedure (eg, a follow -up skin biopsy ). 
All SAEs that occur during the screening period and within 100 days after discont inuat ion of 
dosing must be collected except in cases where a study participant has started a new anti -neopl astic 
treatm ent. 
However, any  SAE occurring after the start of a ne w anti -neopl astic treatment that i s suspected to 
be related to study  treatm ent by  the invest igator should be reported as an SAE.
The invest igator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is believed to 
be related to study  drug or protocol -specified procedure. 
An SAE report should be co mpleted for any  event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness. 
Ifthe invest igator believes that an SAE is not related to study drug, but is potentially related to the 
condi tions of the study  (such as withdrawal of previous therapy  or a complicat ion of a study 
procedure ), the relat ionship should be specified in the narr ative section of the SAE Report Form.

Pregnancy Surveillance Form (ele ctroni c or paper forms). When using paper forms, the reports are 
to be transmitted via email or confirmed facsimile (fax) transmissio n to:
SAE Email Address: Refer to Contact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number: Refer to Con tact Informat ion list.
For studies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electroni c submissi on is the

in the event the electronic system is unavailable for transmissio n. Whe n paper forms are used, the 
original  paper form s are to rem ain on si te.
SAE Telephone Contact (required for SAE and pregnancy reporting): Refer to Contact 
Inform ation list.
If only limited informat ion is initially available, follow -up reports are requi red.(Note: Follow -up 
SAE reports should include the same invest igator term(s) init ially reported.) 
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new informat ion 
beco mes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to the BMS (or 
designee) u sing the same procedure used for transmitting the init ial SAE report.
All SAEs should be fo llowed to resol ution or stabilizat ion.
6.2 Non-serious Adverse Events
Anon-serious adverse event is an AE not classified as serious.
6.2.1 Non-serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting
The collection of non-serious AE informat ion shoul d begin at initiation of study drug and for 
135days after discont inuat ion of dosing or until starting a new anti-neopl astic treatment 
(whichever occurs first) . Non -serious AE informatio n shoul d also be collected from  the start of a 
placebo l ead-in period or other observat ional perio d intended to establish a baseline status for the 
subjec ts. 
Non-serious AEs shoul d be followed to resolut ion or stabilizat ion, or reported as SAEs if they 
beco me serious (see Secti on6.1.1 ).Follow -up is also required for non-serious AEs that cause 
interrupti on or di scont inuat ion of study drug and for those present at the end of study treatment as 
appropriate. All ident ified non -serious AEs must be recorded and described on the non -serious AE
page of the CRF (paper or electronic). 
Com pletion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory abnormalit ies that 
are reported/ident ified during the course of the study .
Immune-mediated adverse events are AEs consistent with an immune -mediated mechanism or 
immune -mediated component for which non-inflammatory  etiologies (eg,infect ion or tumor 
progression) have been ruled out. IMAEs can include events with an alternate etio logy which were

6.3 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The fo llowing l aboratory  test resul t abnorm alities shoul d be captured on the non -serious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or e lectronic) as appropriate:
Any laboratory  test resul t that is clinically significant or meets the definit ion of an SAE .
Any laboratory test resul t abnormalit y that required the subject to have study drug discont inued 
or interrupted .
Any laboratory  test re sult abnorm ality that requi red the subject to receive specific corrective 
therapy .
It is expected that wherever possible, the clinical rather than laboratory term would be used by the 
reporting invest igator (eg, anemia versus low hemoglobin value).
6.4 Pregnancy
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequent ly discovered that a study 
subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of invest igational product exposure, 
including during at least 5 half-lives + 30 days (165 days) after product administration, the 
investigat ional product will be perm anently discontinued in an appropri ate manner (eg, dose 
tapering if necessary  for subject safety ). 
Protocol -requi red procedures for study discont inuation and follow
-up must be perform ed on the 
subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (eg, x -ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy 
follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated.
The invest igator must immediately notify  the BMS (or designee) Medical Moni tor of  this event 
and com plete and forward a Pregnancy  Surveillance Form  to BMS (or desi gnee) wi thin 24 hours 
and in accordance with SAE reporting procedures described in Section 6.1.1 . 
Follow-up informat ion regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal  and neonatal 
outcom e and, where applicable, offspring informat ion must be reported on the Pregnancy 
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study  participant should be reported to 
BMS. Information on this pregnancy will be co llected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.
In cases where a study  drug can be present in seminal fluid, at exposures sufficient to p otenti ally 
cause fetal toxicit y, and if any sexual act ivity (eg, vaginal, anal, oral) has occurred between a male 
participant and a pregnant WOCBP partner(s), the inform ation shoul d be reported to the Sponsor 
or designee, even if the male participant has undergone a successful vasectomy . In order for 
Sponsor or designee to collect any pregnancy surveillance information from  the female partner, 
the female partner(s) must sign an informed consent form for disclosure of this informat ion. 
Inform ation on the pregnancy will be co llected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.

6.5 Overdose
An overdose is defined as the accidental or intent ional administration of any dose of a product that 
is considered both excessive and medically important. Overdose, as a verbatim term (as reported 
by the invest igator), should not be reported as an AE/SAE unless it is an intent ional overdose taken 
with possible suicidal/self -harming intent. Such overdoses shoul d be reported regardless of 
sequelae and should specify "intent ional overdose " as the verbat im term. 
All occurrences of intentional overdose must be reported as an SAE (see Sect ion 6.1.1 for reporting 
details).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)
Wherever possible, timely confi rmation of initial liver-related laboratory  abnormalit ies shoul d

of the first object ively docum ented progression as per criteria relevant to each disease type in Part 
D (Appendices 1, 2, and 6), or dea th due to any  cause, whichever occurs first. For subjects who 
neither progress nor die, DOR will be censored on the date of their last tumor assessment. Subjects 
who start subsequent therapy  without a prior reported progression will be censored at the last tumor 
assessments prior to initiation of the subsequent anticancer therapy . This endpo int will only be 
evaluated in subjects with object ive response of CR or PR. DOR will be evaluated based on 
investigator assessment s.DOR is a co-primary endpo int in Part D.DOR based on the Lugano 
(2014) response criteria , respo nse defined as CMR or PMR, will be assessed for the NHL/HL 
subjects in Part D as an exploratory endpoint.
Complete Response (CR) Rate and Duration
The CR rate is defined as the number of subjects with a best overall response (BOR )of CR
according to the applicable cri teria based on tum or ty pe, based on IWG cri teria for NHL and HL 
subjects ,divided by the number of treated subjects. The durati on of CR (DoCR) will only be 
evaluated in subjects wi th BOR of  CR and is defined as the time from first docum entati on of  CR 
(the date of first negat ive FDG -PET scan) to the date of init ial object ively d ocum ented progressi on 
as determined using the applicable criteria based on tumor typeor death due to any cause, 
whichever occurs first. Censoring will be applied as per DOR definit ion.  CR rateand DoCR will 
be evaluated based on invest igator assessments. CR rate is an exploratory  endpoint in this study .
Progression Free Survival (PFS) Rate
PFS is defined as the time from first dose to the date of first object ively documented progressi on, 
perapplicable criteria based on tumor typeor death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Subjects who die without a reported progression will be considered to have progressed on the date 
of their death. Subjects who did not progress or die will be censored on the date of their last 
evaluable tumor assessment. Subject s who did not have any on study  tumor assessments and did 
not di e will be censored on the date of first dose. Subjects who started any subsequent ant i-cancer 
therapy , including tumor-directed radiotherapy  and tumor-directed surgery , without a prior 
reporte d progression will be censored at the l ast evaluable tum or assessment pri or to i nitiation of 
the subsequent anti-cancer therapy . The PFS rate at time T is defined as the probabilit y that a 
subject has not progressed and is alive at time T following first dose. PFSR will be assessed at 
Weeks 16, 24, 32, 40, and 100, and evaluated based on investigator assessments. PFS will be an 
exploratory  endpoint in this study .
Overall Survival (OS) Rate
OS is defined as the t ime between the da te of first dose and the dat e of death. For subjects without 
docum entati on of death, OS will be censored on the last date the subject was known to be alive. 
The overall survival rate at time T is defined as the probabilit y that a subject is alive at time T 
following first dose OS wil l be assessed at various time points in HL patients in Part D.

CR (Complete Remission)
The designat ion of CR requires the fo llowing:
APPENDIX 1 Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease -related 
symptoms, if present before therap y.
APPENDIX 2 Typically  [18F] fluorode oxyglucose (FDG) -avid ly mphoma: in patients with no pretreatment 
positron emission tomography (PET) scan or when the PET scan was positive before therapy, a post -treatment 
residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is P ET negative.
APPENDIX 3 Variably  FDG -avid ly mphomas/FDG avidity unknown: in patients without a pretreatment PET 
scan, or if a pretreatment PET scan was negative, all lymph nodes and nodal masses must have regressed on 
computed tomography (CT) scan to normal size ( 1.5 cm in their greatest transverse diameter for nodes > 1.5 
cm before therapy). Previously involved nodes that were 1.1 to 1.5 cm in their long axis and > 1.0 cm in their 
short axis before treatment must have decreased to 1.0 cm in their short axis after treatment.
APPENDIX 4 The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy on the basis of a physical 
examination or CT scan, should not be palpable on physical examination and should be considered normal size 
by imaging studies, and nodules related to lym phoma should disappear. However, determination of splenic 
involvement is not always reliable because a spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, 
whereas an enlarged spleen may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of hematopoietic growth 
factors, or causes other than lymphoma.
APPENDIX 5 If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate must have cleared 
on repeat bone marrow biopsy. The biopsy sample on which this determination is made must be adequate (wit h 
a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core). If the sample is indeterminate by morphology, it should be negative by 
immunohistochemistry. A sample that is negative by immunohistochemistry but demonstrates a small 
populatio n of clonal ly mphocytes by flow cytometry will be considered a CR until data become available 
demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.
PR (Partial Remission)
The designat ion of PR requires all o f the following:
1.At least a 50% decrease in the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to 6 of the largest dominant 
nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected according to all of the following: they should 
be clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular dimensions; if possible they should be from disparate region s 
of the body; and they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease whenever these sites are 
involved.
2.No increase should be observed in the size of other nodes, liver, or spleen.
3.Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by 50% in the ir SPD or, for single nodules, in the greatest transverse 
diameter.
4.With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is usually assessable and no 
measurable disease should be present.
5.Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for d etermination of a PR, if the sample was positive before treatment. 
However, if positive, the cell type should be specified (e.g., large -cell ly mphoma o r small neoplastic B cells). 
Patients who achieve a CR by the above criteria but have persistent morpholo gic bone marrow involvement will 
be considered partial responders. When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical CR was 
achieved but with no bone marrow assessment after treatment, patients should be considered partial responders.
6.No new sites of disease should be observed.
7.FDG:
a.Typically  FDG -avid ly mphoma: for patients with no pretreatment PET scan or if the PET scan was positive 
before therapy, the post -treatment PET should be positive in at least 1 previously involved site.
b.Variably  FDG -avid ly mphomas/FDG -avidity  unknown: for patients without a pretreatment PET scan, or if 
a pretreatment PET scan was negative, CT criteria should be used. In patients with follicular lymphoma or 
mantle -cell lymphoma, a PET scan is only indicated with 1 or at most 2 residual masses that have regressed 
by > 50% on CT; those with more than 2 residual lesions are unlikely to be PET negative and should be 
considered partial responders.

SD (Stable Disease)
1.A patient is considered to have SD when he or she fails to attain the criteria needed for a CR or PR but does not 
fulfill those for progressive disease (see Relapsed Disease [after CR]/Progressive Disease [after PR, SD]).
2.Typically  FGD -avid ly mphomas: the PET should be positive at prior sites of disease with no new areas of 
involvement on the post -treatment CT or PET scan.
3.Variably  FDG -avid ly mphomas/FDG -avidity  unknown: for patients without a pretreatment PET scan or if the 
pretreatment PET was negative, there must be no change in the size of the previous lesio ns on the post -
treatment CT scan.
PD: Relapsed Disease (after CR)/Progressive Disease (after PR, SD)
Lymph nodes shoul d be considered abnorm al if the long axis is > 1.5 cm regardless of the short 
axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should only be considered abnorm al if 
its short axi s is > 1.0. Lymph nodes 1.0 x 1.0 cm  will not be consi dered abnorm al for relapse 
or progressive disease.
1.Appearance of any new lesion > 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the end of therapy, even if other lesions are 
decreasing in size. Increased FDG uptake in a previously unaffected site should only be considered relapsed or 
PD after confirmation with other modalities. In patients with no prior history of pulmonary lymphoma, new 
lung nodules identified by CT are mostly benign. Thus, a therapeutic decision should not be made solely on the 
basis of the PET without histologic confirmation.
2.At least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes, or in a single involved node, 
or the size of other lesions (e.g., splenic or hepatic nodules). To be considered PD, a lymph node with a 
diameter of the short axis of < 1.0 cm must increase by 50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or > 1.5 cm in the 
long axis.
3.At least a 50% increase in the longest d iameter of any single previously identified node > 1cm in its short axis.
4.Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typical FDG -avid ly mphoma o r the lesion was PET positive 
before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current PE T systems (< 1.5 cm in its long axis 
by CT).
Measurable extranodal  disease shoul d be assessed in a manner similar to th at for nodal  disease. 
For these recommendat ions, the spleen is consi dered nodal  disease. Disease that is only 
assessable (e.g., pleural effusi ons, bone lesio ns) will be recorded as present or absent only, 
unless, while an abnormalit y is still noted by imaging studies or physical examinat ion, it is found 
to be histologically negat ive.
In clinical trials where PET is unavailable to the vast majo rity of participants, or where PET is 
not deemed necessary  or appropriate for use (e.g., a trial in patients with MALT lympho ma), 
response should be assessed as above, but only using CT scans. However, residual masses should 
not be assigned CRu status, but should be considered partial responses.

APPENDIX 2 2008 INTERNATIONAL WORKING GROUP ( IWG) RESPONSE 
CRITER IA FOR CLL WITH MODIFICATIONS
2008 IWG Response Criteria for CLL with Modifications1
COMPLETE REMISSION (CR)
Absence of lymphadenopathy by physical examination and appropriate radiographic techniques. Lymph 
nodes should not be larger than 1.5 cm in diameter.
No hepatomegaly or splenomegaly by physical examination or appropriate radiographic techniques if in a 
clinical trial.
Absence of constitutional symptoms.
Normal CBC as exhibited by:
Polymo rphonuclear leukocytes 1,500/ L
Blood ly mphocy tes < 4000/ L
Platelets > 100,000/ L
Hemoglobin > 11.0 g/dL (without transfusion or exogenous erythropoietin)
Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy should be performed after clinical and laboratory results demo nstrate that 
all of the requirements listed above have been met, to demonstrate a CR has been achieved. The bone 
marrow should be analyzed by flow cytometry and/or immunohistochemistry (IHC) to demonstrate that the 
marrow is free of clonal B-CLL cells. The marrow sample must be at least normocellular for age, with 
<30% of nucleated cells being ly mphocy tes. Ly mphoid nodules should assessed by  IHC to define whether 
they are comprised primarily of T cells or lymphocytes other than CLL cells or of CLL cells. Cases with 
residual CLL cells by conventional flow cytometry  or IHC are defined as partial remissio n (PR). If the 
bone marrow is hy pocellular, a repeat determination should be made in 4 – 6 weeks. Samples should be re -
reviewed in conjunction with the prior pathology.
Minimal residual disease (MRD): performed by MRD 4 -color flow, allele -specific oligonucleotide PCR with 
sensitivity to 1 CLL cell per 10,000 leukocytes.
COMPLETE REMISSION with incomplete bone marrow recovery (CRi)
Otherwise CR, but who have persistent anemia, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia that appears to be related to 
persistent drug toxicity rather than to disease activity. The long -term outcome for these patients may be 
different from the noncytopenic CR.
PARTIAL REMISSION (PR) 
At least 2 of the following:
50% decrease in peripheral blood lymphocyte count from the pretreatment baseline.
50% reduction in the noted pretreatment enlargement of the spleen or liver .
50% reduction in marrow infiltrate, or B -lymphoid nodules.
50% reductio n in ly mphadenopathy (preferably by CT) as defined by the following:
A decrease in lymph node size by 50% or more either in the sum products of up to 6 ly mph nodes, or 
in the largest diameter of the enlarged lymph node(s) ,detected prior to therapy.
No increase in any  lymph node, and no new enlarged lymph node. In small ly mph nodes (< 2 cm), an 
increase of less than 25% is not considered to be significant.
A reduction in the noted pretreatment enlargement of the spleen or liver by 50% or more, as detected

PROGRESSIVE DISEASE (PD)
At least one of the following:
Appearance of any new lesion, such as enlarged ly mph nodes (> 1.5cm), de novo splenomegaly, de novo 
hepatomegaly or other organ infiltrates. 
An increase by 50% in greatest determined diameter of any previous site. A lymph node of 1 to 1.5 cm 
must increase by 50% o r more  to a size greater than 1.5 cm in the longest a xis. A ly mph node of mo re than 
1.5 cm must increase to more than 2.0 cm in the longest axis.
An increase of 50% or more in the sum of the product of diameters of multiple nodes. 
50% increase in the size of the liver or spleen.
50% increase in the absolute number of circulating lymphocytes with 5,000 Blymphocy tes per 
microliter.
Transformation to a more aggressive histology (eg , Richter’s sy ndrome). Whenever possible, this diagnosis 
should be established by lymph node biopsy.
During therapy, cytopeni as cannot be used to define disease progression. After treatment the progression of 
any cytopenia (unrelated to autoimmune cytopenia), as documented by:
Decrease of Hb levels by > 20 g/L (2 g/dL) or to < 100 g/L (10 g/dL), or 
Decrease of platelet counts b y more than 50% or to less than 100 x 109/L (100 ,000/µL), which occurs 
at least 3 months after treatment, defines disease progression, if the marrow biopsy demonstrates an 
infiltrate of clonal CLL cells.
STABLE DISEASE (SD)
Subjects who have not achieved a CR or a PR, or who have not exhibited PD.
RELAPSE:  defined as a patient who has previously achieved the above criteria (“Complete remission,” 
“Partial remission”) of a CR or PR, but after a period of 6 or more months, demonstrate evidence of disease 
progression (see preceding discussion of progressive disease).

APPENDIX 3 WOMEN OF CHILDBEARIN G POTENTIAL DEFINITI ONS AND 
METHODS OF CONTRACEP TION 
Anti-LAG -3 has not undergone the requi site preclinical testing for teratogeni city and therefore 
requires two forms of contraception. One method must be highly effective and the second 
method may also be highly effect ive or selected from the list of other contraceptive methods .
Women and men who are not capable of reproducti on or choose to be abstinent shall be exempt 
from following the pregnancy prevent ion requirements specified below.
DEFINITIONS
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)
A woman is considered fertile following menarche and until becoming post-menopaus al unless 
perm anent ly sterile. Perm anent sterili zation methods include hysterectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy ,and bilateral  oopherectomy .
Women in the following categories are not considered WOCBP
Prem enarchal
Prem enopausal  female wi th 1 of the f ollowing:
Docum ented hysterectomy
Docum ented bilateral  salpingectomy
Docum ented bilateral  oophorectomy
Note: Docum entati on can come from the site personnel’s review of the partici pant’s medica l 
records, medical examinat ion, or m edical  history  interview.
Postmenopausal  female
A postm enopausal  state is defined as 12 months of amenorrhea in a woman over age 45 
years in the absence of other biological or physio logical  causes. In addition, females 
under the age of 55 years must have a serum  follicle stimulat ing horm one, (FSH) level 
>40 m IU/mL to confirm menopause .
Note: Females treated with horm one replacement therapy , (HRT) are likely to have artificially 
suppressed FSH levels and may require a washout period in order to obtain a physi ologic FSH 
level. The durati on of the washout period is a function of the type of HRT used. The durati on of 
the washout period below are suggested guidelines and the invest igators should use their 
judgement in checking serum FSH level s.
1 week minimum for vaginal hormonal products (rings, creams, gels)
4 week minimum for transdermal products
8 week minimum for oral products

Other parenteral products may requi re washout periods as long as 6 months. If the serum  FSH 
level is > 40 mIU/ml at any time during the washout period, the wom an can be considered 
postm enopausa l.
CONTRACEPTION GUIDANCE FOR FEMALE PAR TICIPANTS OF CHILD B EARING 
POTENTIAL
One of the highly effective methods of contracepti on listed below is requi red during study 
durati on and until the end of relevant systemic exposure, defined as 135 days after the end of 
study  treatm ent, plus 30 days, a total of 24 weeks.
Local  laws and regul ations may requi re use of alternat ive and/or addit ional contracepti on 
methods.
Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent 
Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently an d correctly.a
Combined (estrogen -and progestogen -containing) horm onal contracepti on associ ated with 
inhibit ion of ovulationb 
oral

transderm al 
Progestogen -only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulationb 
oral

Highly Effective Methods That Are User Independent
Implantable progestogen -only hormonal contracepti on associated with inhibit ion of 
ovulationb
Intrauterine device (IUD)c
Intrauterine hormone -releasing system  (IUS)c
Bilateral tubal occlusion
Vasectomized partner 
A vasectomized partner is a highly effective contraception method provided that the partner 
is the sole male sexual partner of the WOCBP and the absence of sperm has been confirmed. 
If not, an additional highly effective method of contraception should be used. 
Sexual abst inence 
Sexual abstinence is considered a highly effective me thod only if defined as refraining from 
heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk associated with the study drug. The 
reliability of sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the study 
and the preferred and usua l lifestyle of the participant.

It is not necessary to use any other method of contraception when complete abstinence is 
elected. 
WOCBP participants who choose complete abstinence must continue to have pregnancy 
tests, as specified in Secti on 3.3.1.
Acce ptable alternate methods of highly effective contraception must be discussed in the 
event that the WOCBP participants chooses to forego complete abst inence
NOTES: 
aTypical use failure rates may  differ from those when used consistently  and correctly . Use should be consistent 
with local regulatio ns regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating in clinical 
studies. 
bHormonal contraception may be susceptible to interactio n with the study drug, which may reduce the efficacy 
of the contraceptive method.  Hormonal contraception is permissible only when there is sufficient evidence 
that the IMP and other study medications will not alter ho rmonal exposures such that contraception would be 
ineffective or result in increased exposures that could be potentially hazardous.  In this case, alternative 
methods of contraception should be utilized. 
cIntrauterine devices and intrauterine hormone releasing systems are acceptable methods of contraception in the 
absence of definitive drug interaction studies when hormone exposures from intrauterine devices do not alter 
contraception effectiveness
Less Than Highly Effective Contraceptive Methods That Are User Dependent 
Failure rate of >1% per year w hen used consistently and correctly.

APPENDIX 4 MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS
These general  guidelines const itute guida nce to the Invest igator and may be supplemented by 
discussio ns with the Medical Moni tor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno -oncol ogy agents and regimens.
A general princi ple is that different ial diagnoses shoul d be diligent ly evaluated according to 
standard medical pract ice. Non-inflammatory etiologies shoul d be considered and appropriately 
treate d.
Corti costeroi ds are a primary therapy for immuno -oncol ogy drug -related adverse events. The oral 
equivalent of the recommended IV doses may be considered for ambulatory  patients with low-
grade toxicit y. The lower bioavailabilit y of oral corticosteroids s hould be taken into account when 
switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.
Consultat ion with a medical or surgi cal specialist , especially prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeuti c procedure, is recommended.
The frequency and severit y of the related adverse events covered by these algorithms will depend 
on the immuno -oncol ogy agent or regimen being used.

APPENDIX 7 LUGANO 2014 RESPONSE CRITERIA
For PET-based assessments, a clinical response of progressive metabo lic disease (PMD), no 
metabo lic response (NMR), partial metabolic response (PMR), or complete metabolic response 
(CMR) will be det ermined. PMD/PD includes radiological evidence of progressi on per Lugano 
Classificat ion Revised Staging Sy stem  for malignant lymphom a. The PET scan metabolic uptake 
will be graded using the Deauville 5-point scale, with a  score of 3 considered to represe nt a 
CMR. 
Deauville 5-point scale: 1- no uptake above background; 2-uptake mediastinum; 3-uptake 
>mediastinum but liver; 4= uptake moderately > liver; 5-uptake markedly higher than liver 
and/or new lesions; X -
new areas of uptake unlikely to be re lated to lympho ma.

All of the following:
Lymph nodes and extralymphatic 
sitesScore 1, 2 or 3 with or without a 
residual mass on 5 -Point -Scale
It is recognized that in Waldeyer’s 
ring o r extranodal sites with high 
physiologic uptake or with 
activatio n within spleen or marrow 
(eg, with chemotherapy or myeloid 
colony-stimulating factors), uptake 
may be greater than no rmal 
mediastinum and/or liver. In this 
circumstance, complete metabolic 
response may be inferred if uptake 
at sites of initial involvement is no 
greater than surrounding normal 
tissue even if the tissue has high 
physiologic uptake.Target nodes/nodal masse s must 
regress to 1.5 cm in LDi
No extralymphatic sites of disease
Non-measured lesion Not applicable Absent
Organ enlargement Not applicable Regress to normal
New lesions None None
Bone marrowNo evidence of FDG -avid disease

Overall Rationale for the Revised Protocol Revised Protocol 07, 28-Mar -2018
The purpose of Revised Protocol 07 is to: 1) require pre -and on -treatment biopsies for all subjects 
in Part D 2) add Survival  Follow-up and 3) cl arify eligibili ty criteria; and 4) to update safety  and 
clinical pharmacol ogy inform ation and criteria for dose delay and permanent discont inuat ion. See 
below for further details.
Biopsies requi red for  subjects in Part D , whi ch will all ow a 
more comprehensive investigat ion of markers associ ated to response and mechanisms of 
resistance. Survival Follow -up is defined and may continue for up to 5 years fro m the first dose in 
HL patients in Parts C and D. Subjects who were progressed on PD-1/PD -L1 inhibitors within 3 
months of exposure are also allowed. Safety and clinical pharm acology inform ation and criteria 
for dose delay and permanent discontinuati on were updated based on the most recent IB 
 and emerging data.
Addit ionally , the revised protocol incorporates  
change in Study 
Director and Medical Monitor, grammatical revisions and reference updates were also included.
Revisio ns apply to future participants enrolled in the study and where applicable to all part icipants 
currently enro lled.

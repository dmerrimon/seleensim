Confidential and Proprietary 7 Methodology:   
This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging study in 
post-menopausal women in which  the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ACER-801 at different doses is 
evaluated and  the efficacy of ACER -801 ( 50 mg twice daily [BID], 100 mg BID, and 200 mg BID ) 
will be compared  to placebo in approximately 40 to 56 subjects ( 10  to  14 subjects per treatment arm).  
Subjects will enter a Screening P eriod to determine eligibility. Subjects will be required to complete 
hot flash diaries for 2 weeks prior to randomization. Eligible subjects will be admitted to a Clinical 
Research Unit (CRU) on Day - 1 and remain in the clinic from Day -1 until discharge on Day 16 after 
completion of treatment and  all study assessments or upon withdrawal from the study. The study 
includes a 14- day safety follow -up assessment  (Day 28 ).  
Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1:1 :1 ratio to ACER -801 per one of the following dosing schedules 
prior to dosing: 
• 50 mg BID,  
• 100 mg BID,  
• 200 mg BID , or  
• Placebo administered orally for 14 consecutive days (28 doses).   
Blood samples for PK (plasma)  assessment will be collected for concentrations of ACER -801 and its 
metabolite at predose, 0.5 , 1.0, 1.5, 2.0 , 2.5, 3.0 , 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 12.0 (prior to evening dose), and 
15.0 hrs  post morning dose on Day 1 and Day 14, as well as predose (prior to morning dose) on Day 2 
and Day 7. Plasma samples will also be collected 24 hrs  (Day 15 ) and 48 hrs (Day 16) after the 
morning dose on Day 14 . 
Throughout the duration of the study (Day 1 through Day 16), subjects will be required to record the 
frequency and severity of hot flashes in a subject diary (continuous hot flash  diary) . 
Electrocardiographs using the Mortara Surveyor will be collected on Day -1, Day 1, and Day 14.  
During the study, subjects will be closely monitored for safety including assessments of AEs, 12- lead 
ECGs, atrial oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry, vital signs (sitting and standing blood pr essure 
(BP), heart rate, oral body temperature, and respir atory  rate), clinical labs , and physical examinations.

Criteria for Evaluation:  
Pharmacokinetics: 
All blood samples for PK analysis will be anal yzed by a central bioanalytical laboratory. Instructions for 
collection, processing, storing, and shipping of PK blood samples will be provided to the clinical unit by the 
bioanalytical laboratory. 
Safety:  
Subjects will be monitored throughout confinement and during the 2-week follow-up period for adverse 
reactions to the study treatments and/or procedures. Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs) and serious AEs (SAEs); vital signs; concomitant medications; physical examinations; ECGs; and clinical laboratory tests (hematology and coagulation, serum chemistry, and urinalysis). Ongoing AEs will 
be monitored (telephone call) until resolution or for 30 days, whichever is first. Abnormal lab findings will 
be closely monitored by the Sponsor and repeated as deemed necessary until resolution and followed up by the treating physician. All safety data will be reviewed by the Sponsor for any potential safety signals that 
would alter the safety profile of the molecule.  
Statistical Methods:  
Analysis Populations:  
• The PK Population includes all randomized subjects who have evaluable PK samples.  
• The Safety Population includes all randomized subjects receiving at least 1  dose of study treatment. 
• The Modified Intent- to-Treat (mITT) Population includes all randomized subjects who receive 
study treatment with baseline and at least one post- baseline efficacy measurements.  
• The Per -Protocol population includes all randomized subjects with baseline and efficacy 
measurement endpoint visits without any major protocol deviations that would have an impact on 
the efficacy measurements.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses: 
Noncompartmental analysis (NCA) will be performed for the plasma concentrations of ACER-801 and its 
metabolite. Summary statistics for the PK parameters ( Cmax, tmax, AUC last, AUC inf, AUC τ, Accumulation 
Ratio for C max [AR Cmax ], Accumulation Ratio for AUC [AR AUC ], Metabolite Ratio of C max [MR Cmax ], 
Metabolite Ratio of AUC [MR AUC ], t1/2 of ACER -801 and its metabolite) will be determined for ACER -801 
and its metabolite for the different dosing groups. 
Safety Analyses:  
All AEs /SAEs  will be coded using the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities to 
assign system organ class and preferred term classification, based on the original terms entered on the electronic case report form. The incidence of AEs will be summarized by system organ class, preferred 
term, relationship to stu dy treatment, and severity for each study treatment. All AEs, including AEs that lead 
to premature discontinuation from the study and from study treatment SAEs, will be recorded. 
All other safety measures including laboratory tests, vital signs, concomitant medication, medical history, 
physical examination, and ECG data will also be summarized descriptively (mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum). Laboratory tests will also be summarized by absolute and percent change from baselin e and listed by clinical significance.  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the most recent version of World Health Organization Drug 
Dictionary.  
Efficacy Analyses:  
The secondary endpoints are the change in frequency and severity of vasomotor symptoms and hot flash 
severity score at Week 1 and Week 2 relative to baseline.

Confidential and Proprietary 20 2 INTRODUCTION 
Acer acquired the rights to osanetant (SR142801) , a selective non -peptide neurokinin 3 receptor 
(NK3R)  antagonist, from Sanofi on December 2018 and has since renamed the compound 
ACER -801. ACER-801 is being investigated for the prevention/treatment of 
moderate/severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in patients with medically or surgically induced 
VMS  (iVMS).  
The efficacy and safety of AC ER-801 in subjects with i VMS has not been evaluated  to date. 
Osanetant  (SR142801) has been studied in a total of 23 completed clinical studies conducted by 
Sanofi with osanetant doses ranging from 5 mg to 1000 mg in healthy subjects and 50 mg  to 
200 mg onc e daily ( QD) in patients with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, Parkinson’s 
disease, panic disorder, and asthma. In these studies, osanetant was found to be well tolerated, with minimal safety issues.  
2.1 Background 
Neurokinin B (NKB) belongs to a group of neuropeptides, called tachykinins or neurokinins (NKs), that includes substance-P (SP), and neurokinin A (NKA). The biological effects of tachykinins are mediated through specific receptors denoted NK1, NK2, and NK3. NKB is the preferred endogenous ligand of tachykinin NK3 receptors. The tachykinin NK3 receptors (NK3R) are located primarily in the brain, while a few receptors are also present in the peripheral nervous system. The NK receptor pathway in the hypothalamus, including NK3, has been  shown to play a role in the etiology of VMS ( Prague 2017; Skorupskaite, 2018).  
VMS are generally defined as hot  flashes, flushing and night sweats that most often occur in 
women entering or in menopause. VMS are causally related to decreased estradiol concentrations mainly in the systemic circulation and subsequently also in the hypothalamic temperature regulating center. The lack of estrogens alters neurotransmitter activity, especially in the serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways. Because sex steroids act as potent neuromodulators, the substitution of ovarian steroids by hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is curr ently the most 
effective treatment option for VMS.  
Clinical stud ies with a dual NK1/NK3 antagonist (NT -814) and selective NK3 antagonists 
(fezolinet ant and MLE4901  [pavinetant]) in  menopausal women  significantly 
reduced  VMS  (Trower, 2020; Fraser , 2020; Santoro, 2020, Prague, 2017) . Based on the 
demonstrated role of the NK pathway in the etiology of VMS, it is hypothesized that administration of the NK3 receptor antagonist, ACER‑801, will result in similar findings by modulating the NKB pathway directly.  
While VMS associated with menopause can often be treated with HRT, there are subjects  who 
experience VMS who are not in menopause and in whom HRT  is not the preferred or acceptable 
treatment.  VMS  can be induced (iVMS)  with the use of hormonal cancer therapies and  certain 
surgical procedures. Under these situations, VMS can appear immediately and be severe and,  in 
many instances, HRT therapy is not the preferred treatment.   
ACER -801 may be a novel, non-hormonal , centrally  acting  therapy for iVMS.

Confidential and Proprietary 21 2.2 Safety Data  
To date, no studies have been conducted with ACER-801 in subjects with iVMS.  
Safety data are summarized for completed clinical studies conducted with osanetant by Sanofi. 
These studies were conducted in healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia, major depressive disorder, Parkinson’s disease, panic disorder, and asthma.  
Osanetant was  evaluated in 23 completed Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies. In single- and repeat -dose 
Phase 1 studies, approximately 400 subjects were exposed to doses ranging from 5 mg  to 
1000 mg in single dose studies and from 5 mg to 1000 mg (500 mg twice daily [ BID]) in 
repeat -dose studies in which subjects received osanetant for up to 21 days.  
In the 7 completed Phase 2 studies, a total of 821 patients were exposed to  osanetant, including 
patients with depression (up to 200 mg QD for 6 weeks), patients with panic disorder (200 mg 
QD for 4 weeks),  patients with schizophrenia (200 mg QD for 16 weeks), patients with asthma 
(200 mg QD for 6 weeks), and patients with Parkinson’s disease (100 or 200 mg QD for 9 days).  
Data from these studies demonstrated no major safety conce rns after single -dose and repeat -dose 
administration up to 400 mg QD in healthy subjects, and 200 mg QD in the patient population. In controlled clinical trials, there is no evidence to date for liver function test abnormalities or weight loss, as noted in the toxicology studies. 
The incidence of adverse events ( AEs) was similar in the  osanetant  and placebo groups in 
completed Phase 1 and  2 trials. In patients, the serious adverse events ( SAEs ) reported in 
the osanetant  group were mainly related to the condition being treated. Adverse events most 
frequently reported in osanetant -treated patients were headache, nausea, dyspepsia, insomnia, 
dizziness , and abdominal pain. These incidences were comparable in the osanetant  and placebo 
groups.  Additional details can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
2.3 Rationale for Study  Design and Dose for Investigational Product 
A 200 mg BID dose was chosen as the maximum dose based on previous studies in healthy 
subjects where a 400 mg QD dose up to 21 days was shown to be safe. The subjects in this study 
will be healthy with no outstanding medical issues who present with moderate to severe VMS.

4.1 Overall Study  Design  
This is a Phase 2a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study in post-
menopausal women in which the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of ACER-801 at different doses is evaluated and  the efficacy of ACER -801 (50 mg twice daily [BID], 100 mg BID, and 200 mg 
BID) will be compared to placebo in approximately 40 to 56 subjects (approximately 10 to 14 subjects per treatment arm).  
Subjects will enter a Screening P eriod to determine eligibility. Subjects will be requ ired to 
complete hot flash diaries for 2 weeks prior to randomization. Eligible subjects will be admitted to a Clinical Research Unit (CRU) on Day -1 and remain in the clinic from Day -1 until discharge on Day 16 after completion of treatment and all study  assessments or upon withdrawal 
from the study. The study includes a 14-day safety follow-up assessment (Day 28) ( Figure 1 ).
  
Subjects will be randomized  in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to ACER-801 per one of the following dosing 
schedules prior to dosing: 
• 50 mg BID 
• 100 mg BID, 
• 200 mg BID , or  
• placebo  administered orally for 14 consecutive days (28 doses). 
Blood samples for PK (plasma)  assessment will be collected for concentrations of ACER-801 
and its metabolite at predose, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, 8.0, 12.0 (prior to evening dose), and 15.0 hrs post morning dose on Day 1 and Day 14, as well as predose 
(prior to morning 
dose) on Day 2 and Day 7. Plasma samples will also be collected 24 hrs (Day 15) and 48 hrs (Day 16) after  the morning dose on Day 14.  
Throughout the duration of the study (Day 1 through Day 16), subjects will be required to record the frequency and severity of hot flashes in a subject diary (continuous hot flash diary). 
Electrocardiographs using the Mortara Surveyor will be collected on Day -1, Day 1, and Day 14.  
During the study, subjects will be closely monitored for safety including assessments of AEs, 
12-lead ECGs, atrial oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry, vital signs (sitting and standing blood pressure (BP), heart rate, oral body temperature, and respirat ory rate), clinical labs , and 
physical examinations.

 Confidential and Proprietary  42 11 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
Subjects will be monitored throughout confinement for adverse reaction s to the study treatments 
and/or procedures. Safety will be assessed by  monitoring  Aes/serious Aes (SAEs); vital signs; 
concomitant medications; physical examinations;  ECGs ; and clinical  laboratory tests . 
All A es, whether observed by the investigator, reported by the subject, noted from laboratory 
findings, or identified by other means, will be recorded from the time of check -in until the 
subject completes the EOS  assessments. Recording Ae s/SAEs in the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system is the method for reporting Ae s/SAEs. All  Aes/SAEs will be  recorded in the EDC.  
11.1 Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
11.1.1 Definitions of Adverse Events  
11.1.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE  is defined as any untoward medi cal occurrence associated with the use of the 
investigational product in humans, whether or not considered related to investigational product. 
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with any use of the investigational product, without any judgment about causality and irrespective of route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
Adverse event s include but are not limited to: (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or 
frequency of condition(s) present at the start of the study; (2) subject deterioration due to primary 
illness; (3)  intercurrent illness; and (4) drug interaction. 
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without leading the subject or asking about the occurrence of any specific symptom. The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information. The diagnosis and not the individual signs/symptoms should be documented as the AE. For example, if the underlying disease process is a stroke, it would not be appropriate to record the AE by describing the symptoms “sudden numbness, dizziness, and difficulty speaking” . The AE medical term of 
“stroke or cerebrovascular accident” should be recorded as it more accurately describes the AE.  
All Aes must be graded for severity (i.e., intensity) using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ( CTCAE ) version 5.0. The i nvestigator will determine the severity of each AE 
and will record it on the AE eCRF, using the categories defined in Table 3 . It should be noted 
that the term “severe” used to grade intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious”. The assessment of severity is made regardless of investigational product relationship or of the seriousness of the AE. When reporting Aes, reference should be made to the CTCAE manual for guidance on appropriate grading.

Grade  Clinical Description of Severity  
1 = Mild  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations only, or intervention not 
indicated.  
2 = Moderate Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; or limiting age -appropriate instrumental 
activities of daily livinga 
3 = Severe  Medically significant but not immediately life -threatening, hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization indicated, disabling, or limiting self -care activities of daily livingb 
4 = Life threatening  Life-threatening consequences. Urgent intervention indicated.  
5 = Death  Death related to AE.  
a Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
b Self-care activities of daily living refer to bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications , and not 
bedridden.  
The investigator will document their  opinion of the relationship of the AE to treatment with the 
investigational product using the criteria outlined in Table 4 . An AE for which there is a 
“reasonable possibility” that the investigational product caused the AE i s otherwise referred to as 
suspected adverse reaction. “Reasonable possibility” means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the investigational product and the AE. 
If the relationship between the AE/SAE and the investigational product is determined to be 
“definite ”, “probable ”, or “possible”, the event will be considered to be related to the 
investigational product for the purposes of expedited regulatory reporting. 
Table 4 Relationship of Adverse Events to Investigational Product 
Relationship  Description  
Definite  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational 
product or in which the investigational product level has been established in body fluids or tissue; that 
follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected investigational product; and that is confirmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage of the investigational product, and reappearance of the reaction on repeated exposur e. 
Probable  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected investigational product; that is confirmed by stopping or reducing the dosage of the investigational product; and that could not be 
reasonably explained by the known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state.  
Possible  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational 
product; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected investigational product; but 
that could readily be produced by a number of other factors.  
Unlikely  An event that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the investigational product; that does not follow a known or suspected response pattern to the suspected investigational product; and that could reasonably be explained by known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state.  
Not Related  Any event that  does not meet the above criteria.  
11.1.2 Treatment -Emergent Adverse Event  
A TEAE is any event not present before administration of study drug or any event that was 
already present but worsens in either intensity or frequency following exposure to the study drug. 
Serious Adverse Event  An AE  is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the investigator or Acer , it results in any 
of the following outcomes:

intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above 
Events not considered to be SAEs are hos pitalizations for: 
• Routine monitoring of the studied indication and not associated with any deterioration in 
condition or AE 
• Elective treatment for a pre-existing condition that did not worsen 
• Respite care or observation when there is no AE associated with  the hospitalization  
11.2 Reporting of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
11.2.1 Reporting of Adverse Events  
All AE data will be collected from the time that signed informed consent is obtained until the subject fully completes her/his study participation of th e study. Ongoing Ae s will be monitored 
(telephone call) until resolution or for 30 days, whichever is first. 
Abnormal lab findings will be closely monitored by the Sponsor and repeated as deemed 
necessary until resolution and followed up by the treating physician.  All safety data will be 
reviewed by the Sponsor for any potential safety signals that would alter the safety profile of the molecule . 
All A es, whether assessed  by the investigator to be related or unrelated to the study drug, must 
be documented in the subject’s medical records, in accordance with the investigator’s normal clinical practice and on the AE electronic case report form ( eCRF ). Each AE is to be evaluated 
for duration, intensity, frequency, seriousness, outcome, other actions taken, and relationship to the investigational product. 
11.2.2 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
In agreeing to the provisions of this protocol, the i nvestigator accepts all legal responsibilities for 
immediate reporting of SAEs to Acer .  
Any SAE, whether or not considered related to study drug, will also be reported immediately 
(within 24 hours) to Acer or the Acer designee Drug Safety Department by email (drugsafety@acertx.com) using the study- specific SAE Report Form  and will be entered into the 
EDC system within 24  hours. A study- specific SAE report form (paper) will be used if the EDC 
system is not available.   
The reporting period for SAEs is the period from the time of check -in through c heck -out and 
within 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Any medication or other therapeutic measures used to treat the event will be recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF page in addition to the outcome of the SAE. Investigators should not wait to collect additional information that fully documents the event before notifying Acer  or the Acer

report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities within 7 calendar days of being notified about the event; therefore, it is important that investigators submit additional information requested by Acer or  the Acer designee as soon as it becomes available.  
Reporting of SAEs to the i nstitutional r eview board ( IRB) will be conducted in accordance with 
the SOPs  and policies of the IRB. Adequate documentation must be provided to Acer or the Acer 
designee showing that the IRB was properly notified. 
All SAEs must be reported to Acer . SAEs are reported by entering the SAE data into the study 
specific EDC system. Entering the SAE data into the EDC system will automatically notify Acer 
of the event. If an SAE occurs in a subject during the study, in the event the EDC system is 
inaccessible, the following Acer personnel is to be contacted: 
Alka Chawla, MD  
Telephone: 1-408-482-4903  Fax: 1-866-511-8891 Email: drugsafety@acertx.com 
If an SAE is reported by telephone, an SAE Report Fo rm must also be completed in the EDC 
system as so on as the EDC system is accessible. At a minimum, the following information 
should be provided at the time of the initial report:  
• Subject number 
• Even t term  
• At least 1 criterion classifying the event as serious 
• Name and title of the reporting individual 
• Causal relationship to the investigational product 
The i nvestigator will assess whether the event is causally related to the investigational product. 
Acer  will also assess whether the event is causally related to the investigational product, in 
addition to assessing the overall safety profile of the investigational product. Acer  will notify the 
appropriate regulatory agencies of expedited s afety reports that occur during the study within the 
time frames required by each regulatory agency.  
An SAE assessed with  a possible, probable, or definite causal relationship to the investigational 
product and unexpected according to the IB, is known as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction  (SUSAR)  and will be expeditiously reported to regulatory authorities and investigators, 
as appropriate.  
Following the initial report, any additional information obtained by the investigator about the SAE must be reported promptly to Acer in the same manner as described above for the initial SAE report. Any supporting source documentation should be emailed to drugsafety@acertx.com as soon as possible. 
The investigator is responsible for submitting information on expedited s afety r eports received 
from Acer to their local  IRB, as directed by the local -country requirements. 
Documentation of the submissions to IRBs must be retained in the appropriate study files. As 
instructed by Acer , expedited sa fety reports should be retained in the appropria te investigative 
site study files, or with the IB.

 Confidential and Proprietary  46 11.2.3 Additional Investigator Responsibilities for Serious Adverse Events  
The safety data recorded in the EDC represent the official record of all A es and SAEs reported in 
the study. The investigator should comply with requests by the m edical monitor or other Acer  
personnel to record the SAE on the subject’s AE EDC. Other supporting documents such as 
radiology reports, hospital discharge summaries, and autopsy reports should also be provided, when appropriate. Additionally, upon request by Acer , the investigator should provide input into 
the SAE narrative and provide timely information to ensure prompt follow-up and closure of the SAE report.  
The investigator and supporting personnel responsible for subject care should discuss with the medical monitor any need for supplemental investigations of SAEs. The results of these 
additional assessments must be reported to the m edical monitor. 
11.2.4 Notification of Post- Study Serious Adverse Events  
If an i nvestigator becomes aware of an SAE that may be attributable to the investigational 
product at any time after the end of the study, Acer  should be notified immediately (i.e., within 
24 hours). 
All SAEs that occur within 30 days following the cessation of investigational product, whether 
or not they are related to the study, must be reported to Acer  within 24 hours. 
11.2.5 Follow- Up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
All A es must be followed during the study until the AE resolves, is no longer of clinical concern, 
has stabilized or is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. Ongoing Ae s will be 
monitored (telephone call) until resolution or for 30 days, whichever is first. 
Abnormal lab findings will be closely monitored by the Sponsor and repeated as deemed 
necessary until resolution and followed up by the treating physician. All safety data will be reviewed by the Sponsor for any potential safety signals that would alter the sa fety profile of the 
molecule . 
Any Aes ongoing at the final visit that are deemed to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to the investigational product or of other clinical significance must be followed for as long as necessary to adequately evaluate the safety of the subject or until the event stabilizes, resolves, or is no longer of clinical concern. If resolved, a resolution date for the AE should be documented on the eCRF. The investigator must ensure that follow-up includes any supplemental investigations indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE. This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations or consultation with other healthcare professionals, as considered clinically appropriate, by the investigator. 
11.2.6 Pregnancy and Follow-U p  
Pregnancies are not considered A es in and of themselves; however, if a female subject  becomes 
pregnant while she is enrolled in the clinical study, she must interrupt/discontinue investigational 
product immediately and Acer  must be notified within 24 hours of the investigator learning of 
the pregnancy by completing the pregnancy  follow-up section in the EDC. Entering the 
pregnancy report into the EDC system will automatically notify Acer  of the pregnancy.

The investigator remains responsible for entering the pregnancy information into the EDC when 
the EDC becomes functional.  
The subject and neonate must be followed for outcome information and/or as considered appropriate by the investigator and Acer . The investigator should notify Acer  of the outcome of 
the pregnancy by completing pregnancy follow-up section in the EDC. In the situation that the EDC is no longer available due to study closure, a pregnancy outcome f orm should be completed 
and faxed or emailed  to Acer . Thereafter, the subject and infant must be followed as considered 
appropriate by the investigator and Acer . 
Completing the pregnancy report in the EDC is not a substitute for reporting an AE/SAE when an AE/SAE has occurred. In the situation when an AE/SAE has occurred, the AE/SAE reporting procedures described in Section  11.2 must also be followed. 
11.3 Other Safety Parameters  
11.3.1 Medical History  
A complete medical history will be obtained from the subject at s creening  (Table 1). 
Demographic characteristics (age, sex, race, and ethnicity) will also be recorded.  
Medical history will include specific information relating to any prior or existing medical conditions or surgical procedures involving the following systems: general appearance; dermatologic; head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT); lymphatic ; cardiovascular ; 
respiratory ; gastrointestinal; genitourinary; musculoskeletal; and neurological. A h istory of 
alcohol or drug abuse in the previous 6 months will be collected. 
Investigators will query subjects for smoking and tobacco use history. Investigators will also 
query subjects regarding current alcohol intake (i.e., number of drinks per day). 
11.3.2 Vital Signs, Height, and Weight 
To monitor subject safety, heart rate, blood pressure, body temperature, pulse oximetry, and 
respiratory rate will be measured  for each subject as indicated in Table 1 . Vital signs will be 
measured while subjects are in a sitting positio n and standing position.  
The minimal positional time for collection of the orthostatic vital signs is approximately 5 minutes sitting and approximately 2 minutes standing prior to collection of vital signs.

Only Acer or its designee may modify the protocol. Any change in study conduct requested by 
the investigator will be made only after consulta tion with Acer or its designee, who will then 
issue a formal protocol amendment to implement the change. The only exception may occur when the i nvestigator considers that a subject’s safety is compromised without immediate action. 
In these circumstances, i mmediate approval of the chairman of the IRB must be sought, and the 
investigator should inform Acer or its designee and the full IRB within 2 working days after the emergency occurs. With the exception of minor administrative or typographical changes, the IRB 
must review and approve all amendments. Amendments that have an impact on subject risk or the study objectives, or require revision of the ICF, must receive approval from the IRB prior to their implementation.  
When a protocol amendment substantially alters the study design or the potential risks or burden to subjects, the ICF will be amended and approved by the IRB, and all active subjects will again provide written informed consent.

 Confidential and Proprietary  54 13 ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Compensation, Insurance, and Indemnity  
There will be no charge to subjects to be in this study. Acer will pay all costs of tests, 
procedures, and treatments that are part of the study. In addition, Acer may defer the cost of travel if the company determines that the costs will impose a hardship  on subjects. Acer will not 
pay for any hospitalizations, tests, or treatments for medical problems of any sort, whether or not related to the study subject’s disease that is not part of this study. Costs associated with hospitalizations, tests, and treatments should be billed and collected in the way that such costs are usually billed and collected.  
The investigator should contact Acer or its designee immediately upon notification that a subject has been injured by the study drug or by procedures performed as part of the study. Any subject who experiences a study -related injury should be instructed by the investigator to seek medical 
treatment at a prespecified institution.  
The treating physician should bill the subject’s health insurance company or other third-party payer for the cost of this medical treatment. If the subject has followed the investi gator’s 
instructions, Acer will pay for reasonable and necessary medical services to treat the injuries caused by the study drug or study procedures if these costs are not covered by health insurance or another third party that usually pays these costs. In some jurisdictions, Acer is obligated by law to pay for study-related injuries without prior recourse to third party payer billing. If this is the case, Acer will comply with the law.  
13.2 Ethical Considerations 
The final study protocol, including the final version of the ICF and/or other subject information, must be approved or given a favorable opinion in writing by an IRB. The investigator must submit written IRB approval to Acer before they can enroll any subject into the study. The investigator is responsible for providing the IB and any other available safety information and information about payments and compensation available to subjects to the IRB for review. 
The investigator is responsible for informing the IRB of any amendment to the protocol in 
accor dance with local requirements. A favorable opinion on amendments will be obtained prior 
to implementation, unless the amendment is necessary to reduce immediate risk to study participants. In addition, the IRB must approve all advertising used to recruit subjects for the study. The protocol must be reapproved by the IRB/upon receipt of amendments and annually, as local regulations require. 
The investigator is also responsible for providing the IRB with reports of any reportable serious 
adverse drug reaction s from any other study conducted with the investigational product, 
according to local regulations and guidelines. Acer will provide this information to the investigator. 
The clinical trial will not be initiated, and study drug supplies will not be shipped to the clinical 
unit, until appropriate documents from the IRB, confirming unconditional approval of the protocol, ICF, and all recruiting materials, are obtained by the investigator and copies are received by Acer or its designee. The approval must refer to the study by protocol title and number, identify the documents reviewed, and include the date of review. The investigator will

the protocol or a modification thereof. The IRB is constituted and operates in accordance with 
the principles and requirements described in the US CFR  (21 CFR Part 56). The board must be 
ICH complian t. 
13.2.3 Informed Consent  
A properly written and executed ICF in compliance with the Declaration of Helsinki, ICH GCP, 
and the appropriate US and local regulations will be obtained from each subject prior to enrolling the subject in the study. A copy of the approved ICF and, if applicable, a copy of the approved subject information sheet, must be received by Acer or its designee prior to delivery of study drug and prior to conducting any study procedures.  
The purpose of the study, the procedures to be carried out, and the potential hazards will be 
described to the subjects in non- technical terms.  The subject should be given the opportunity to 
ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided. Subjects will be required to read, sign, and date an ICF summarizing the discussion prior to screening and will be assured 
that they may withdraw from the study at any time without jeopardizing their medical care. Subjects will be given a copy of their ICF. 
13.2.4 Subject Confidentiality and Data Protection  
Partici pant confidentiality is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators, their staff, 
and Acer  and their agents. This confidentiality is extended to cover testing of biological samples 
in addition to the clinical information relating to participa nts. Therefore, the study protocol, 
documentation, data, and all other information generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study, or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of Acer . 
The study monitor (e.g., CRA, medical monitor),  other authorized representatives of Acer, 
representatives of the IRB , or regulatory inspectors may inspect all documents and records 
required to be maintained by the investigator, including but not limited to, medical records (office, clinic, or hospital) and pharmacy records for the participants in this study. The clinical

information will be obtained in writing a nd is included in the statement of informed consent. 
The study participant’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for 
internal use during the study. At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept secured against unauthorized access for as long a period as dictated by local IRB and i nstitutional 
regulations. 
The i nvestigator will maintain a list of subject’s names and identifying information (e .g., 
subject’s hospital number, unique subject number). This list will not be collected by Acer but 
may be viewed or audited by Acer or regulatory authorities. 
The ICF will explain that study data will be securely stored in a computer database, maintaining 
confidentiality in accordance with national data protection legislation. All data computer 
processed by Acer  or designee will be identified by unique subject number/randomization 
code/site number only. 
When personal data on subjects are stored or processed by computer, the data must be secured , 
and password protected to prevent disclosure to unauthorized third parties. The pertinent sections 
of the data protection laws in the country in which the protocol is being conducted will be complied with in full.  
The ICF will explain that, for data verification purposes, authorized representatives of Acer , 
regulatory authorities, or IRB may require direct access to parts of the hospital or study center records relevant to th e study, including subject’s medical history. 
13.2.5 Quality Assurance/Quality Control 
SOPs will be adhered to for all activities relevant to the quality of the study.  
All clinical data will undergo a 100% quality control check prior to clinical database lock. Edit checks are then performed as a validation routine using SAS
® to check for missing data, data 
inconsistencies, data ranges , etc. Corrections are made prior to statistical database lock.  
13.2.6 Study Monitoring  
Qualified individuals designated and/or approved by Acer will monitor all aspects of the study for compliance with applicable government regulations. Following written SOPs, the monitors will verify that the clinical trial is conducted, and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and the applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., Good Laboratory Practices, Good Manufacturing Practices. 
Study records at the clinical unit will be monitored at regular intervals by the CRA. The role of 
the CRA is to a id the investigator in the maintenance and documentation of complete, accurate, 
legible, well organized, and easily retrievable data. In addition, the CRA will ensure the investigator's understanding of all applicable regulations concerning the clinical evaluation of the investigational product and will ensure an understanding of the protocol, reporting responsibilities and the validity of the data. This will include ensuring that full and appropriate essential documentation is available.  
In order to perform this role, the CRA must perform source data verification and as such must be given access to the subject’s primary source documentation (e.g., paper or electronic medical

numbers, demographic information, medical history, disease history, physical examination, vital signs, laboratory assessments [copy of laboratory reports], AEs /SAEs , concomitant medications, 
dates of dispensing investigational product, and ECGs)  that support data entries in the eCRF. The 
eCRF must be completed promptly after each visit to allow the progress and results of the study to be closely followed by the m edical monitor. 
The investigator may exercise judgment in allowing the CRA access to particular sections of the subject's medical records if these are deemed irrelevant to the performance, observations , or 
conduct of this study. 
Independent audits may be conducted by an Acer Quality representative to ensure monitoring 
practices  are performed consistently and that monitors are following the GCPs and applicable 
SOPs.  
13.2.7 Audits and Inspections  
The investigator should understand that it may be necessary for an Acer Quality representative, 
the IRB and/or regulatory agencies to conduct one or more site audits during or after the study. 
The investigator will be informed if an audit is to take place and be advised as to the scope of the 
audit. Representatives of regulatory agencies may conduct an inspection of the study. If informed of such an inspection, the investigator should notify Acer or its designee immediately. The investigator will provide direct access to all trial related sites, pharmacy, clinical staff, source data/documents, clinical supplies and reports for the purpose of monitoring and auditing by Acer, and inspection by local and regulatory authorities. 
13.2.8 Data Handling/Record Keeping  
The Spaulding C linical standard eCRF will be supplied. All raw data generated in connection 
with this study, together with the original copy of the final report, will be retained by the 
Spaulding C linical until at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an 
ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an  ICH 
region or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product. These documents should be retained for a longer period; however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by an agreement with Acer . It is the 
responsibility of Acer  to inform the investigator/institution as to when these documents no longer 
need to be retained.

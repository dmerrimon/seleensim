 1.0 Introduction – Background and Rationale  
Background  
The emergence of dissemination and implementation (D&I) science has driven a rapid increase in 
studies of how new scientific discoveries are translated and developed into evidence -based 
programs and policies. However, D&I science has paid much less attenti on to what happens to 
programs once they have been implemented. Public health programs can only deliver benefits if 
they reach maturity and sustain activities over time. In order to achieve the full benefit of 
significant investment in public health resear ch and program development, we need to understand 
the factors related to sustainability and develop tools and trainings that support strategic long -term 
program sustainability. The goal of this proposed study is to increase the capacity for sustainability 
among evidence -based tobacco control (TC) programs.  
 
Rationale  
Sustainability as an important next step in dissemination and implementation (D&I) 
research.  
Demonstrating that an intervention is effectively implemented, (the initial process of embedding 
interventions within settings12), is only the first step in impacting the health and wellness of a target 
population. In order for the population to reap the benefits of an implemented evidence -based 
intervention, it must be sustained  over time. In recognition of this, several recent D&I papers have 
called explicitly for sustainability research as an essential next step in the field .10,11,13 –21 Program 
sustainability —the extent that interventions can continue to be delivered over time  and 
institutionalized within settings12—is a complex process, often fraught with challenges.16,21 –23 
Research consistently indicates that even effectively implemented interventions risk failure when 
funding ends10,20,24 or when planning and training stops .25 In fact, it is estimated that up to 40% of 
programs fail within two years of losing funding.26 Implementing a program and then failing to 
sustain it can have disastrous consequences for the community though loss of trust and waste of 
valuable community  resources.27 Though there is growing interest in the study of program 
sustainability, there is little agreement on how to best sustain initiatives over time.23,28 This is due, 
in large part, to the historical lack of sustainability assessment tools that a re both reliable and 
widely disseminated16,29 and an essential absence of an evidence -based action planning process for 
sustainability.  
 
Importance of sustaining evidence -based TC for public health.  
As of 2013, 42.1 million – or 1 in 5 — adults in the US smoke, which leads to an estimated 480,000 
preventable deaths per year due to tobacco use. Approximately 61,000 of those deaths occur from 
secondhand smoke exposure. According to the Center for Disease Control and Promotion (CDC), 
if smoking continues at i ts current rate, more than 5 million of today’s youth will die prematurely, 
and the economic cost of smoking will rise to more than $300 billion per year.30  
Tobacco use has long been identified as a major preventable cause of death and disease in the 
US. There is also little debate that TC expenditure directly impacts tobacco use rates in the US. 
Between 1985 and 2003, US adult smoking prevalence declined from 29.5% to 18.6%. This sharp 
decline directly correlated with state TC program funding rates.1 Farrelly et al. estimates, “If, 
starting in 1995, all states had funded their TC programs at the minimum or optimal levels 
recommended by the CDC, there would have been 2.2 million to 7.1 million fewer smokers by 
2003.”1 Given the established evidence for the state TC model and the work left to do in this field, 
it is vital that these programs continue in all 50 states, both to improve quality of life and reduce 
PI: Moreland -Russell, Sarah  Sustainability Action Planning  
3 
 the massive healthcare costs incurred by smoking -related illness.1 Failing to sustain evidence -
based  TC initiatives will likely lead to stagnation in smoking cessation rates and an increase in 
new smokers.1 
 
The need for evidence -based sustainability training and technical assistance . Empirical 
evidence has established that program sustainability can be improved through training and 
technical assistance;11,31 –33 however, to date, no evidence -based program sustainability training 
curricula exists. Thus, systematic methods are needed to empirically develop, test, and disseminate 
sustainability training to i mprove institutionalization of evidence -based programs. While there is 
a growing body of research on the factors affecting sustainability,11,15,20 –23,34 virtually no empirical 
work has been done to translate the components of program sustainability capacit y into practical 
guides and tools for practitioner utilization.11,28 Our work with over 50 public health programs 
indicates that managers, evaluators, and practitioners need assistance in using sustainability 
assessment results to inform sustainability pla nning priorities, along with a clear process for 
completing a written sustainability plan that is easy to implement.  
 
Importance of utilizing an action -oriented approach.  Literature indicates that the best practice 
for impacting long -term behavior and ins titutional change is a hands -on, action -oriented, in -
person35–37 training program. A study that involved action planning training with coalition groups 
working on substance abuse initiatives in Tennessee found positive changes in sustainability 
readiness ( increased infrastructure capacity) post training,11 and a meta -review of health behavior 
change outcomes found that intervention amount, duration, and penetration all impact level of 
behavior change.38,39  
Research also highlights the importance of creatin g an action plan to move sustainabil ity 
progress forward. Creating a sustainability plan has predicted both program survival and post -
launch funding,40 and obtaining future funding facilitated the institutionalization process of a new 
intervention.41 Addit ionally, plan specificity and attitude toward intervention predicted plan 
adherence,42 and perceived self -efficacy, policy support, and level of institutionalization predicted 
sustainment of plan initiatives.25 
 
Innovation  
This study makes important contri butions to D&I science and is innovative because it:       
1. Develops the first ever evidence -based Program Sustainability Action Planning Model and 
Training Curricul um. By establishing an evidence -based method for action planning and technical 
assistance surrounding program sustainability, we are supporting state TC programs and other 
evidence -based public health initiatives to sustain their positive impact in a  tumultuous funding 
climate. In addition, this work will advance the field of study of action planning and technical 
assistance in general which can contribute to aspects of the D&I field beyond sustainability.  
2. Links closely with practice at an opportun e time.  As part of the DP15 -1509, National State -
Based TC Program Funding Announcement set forth by the CDC, all 2015 awarded applicants 
(includes all states and territories) are “required to develop a sustainability plan to ensure 
sustainability and maint aining a state based TC program” and “provide measures of execution of 
all activities as outlined in the sustainability plan.”2 Our development of the Program Sustainability 
Action Planning Training and broad dissemination will assist states in fulfilling this requirement 
and establishing their capacity to continue sustainability planning over time.  
PI: Moreland -Russell, Sarah  Sustainability Action Planning

 3. Further advances D&I science related to establishing validated measures for 
sustainability. The study will also provide further clarity on the challenges, be nchmarks, and 
programmatic factors that contribute to sustainability (versus implementation) of an intervention. 
We will also use the data collected to explore the predictive validity of the Program Sustainability 
Assessment Tool, which will enable program s to better plan for and improve the sustainability of 
effective programs.  
4. Provides broad dissemination of training materials and results . The curriculum and lessons 
from the training program will be systematically disseminated (at no cost) to several k ey audiences 
(e.g., trainers in federal and state agencies, staff in public health agencies). Since our training 
program focuses on capacity for sustainability, our methods and approaches will be applicable to 
numerous other public health issues.  
 
 
1.0  Object ives 
 
The overall goal of this proposed study is to increase the capacity for sustainability among 
evidence -based tobacco control (TC) programs. Although all 50 states have implemented 
evidence -based TC programs and policies, states vary in their abilities to su pport and sustain these 
programs over time. Most states still do not meet the CDC recommended level for funding their 
TC program allowing for tobacco use to remain the leading cause of preventable disease and death 
in the US.1 Also, as part of the 2015 National State -Based Tobacco Control Program Funding 
Announcement released by the CDC,2 all awarded state applicants are “required to develop a 
sustainability plan” and “provide measures of execution of all activities as outlined in the 
sustainability plan ”. There are currently no available resources specifically designed to help states 
meet this requirement  making this project imperative for states to effectively meet this important 
funding requisite.  
 Phase 1 (Aim 1 ) focuses on refining and finalizing our evidence -based Program 
Sustainability Action Planning Model and Training Curricul um and deliver to 12 states. 
The Program Sustainability Action Planning Training will incorporate experiential 
learning methods3–6 and includes: action planning workshops, de velopment of action plans 
with measurable objectives to foster institutional changes, and technical assistance.   
 Phase 2 (Aim 2) will use a  randomized effectiveness trial to assess the Program 
Sustainability Action Planning Training in  24 states (12 intervention, 12 comparison). 
Evaluation of our training program is centered on the theory of change.7,8  
 Phase 3  (Aim 3)  focuses on  respond ing to study results by making any needed revisions 
and conduct widespread dissemination of our Progr am Sustainability Action Planning 
Model and Training Curricul um starting with the 12 comparison states.  
 
 
3.0 Selection of Participants – Eligibility Criteria  
 
Recruitment.  A total of 24  state TC programs will be recruited to participate in this study. We 
believe this number is feasible for three main reasons: (1) this training will be in high demand 
because of the CDC’s requirement for all state TC programs to complete a sustainability p lan; (2) 
our strong relationships and past success in evaluating state level TC programs; (3) our project 
consultant’s 20+ years working directly with state level tobacco programs (Eischen).   
PI: Moreland -Russell, Sarah  Sustainability Action Planning

 State selection . We will recruit 24 states, and then  randomly assign each state into intervention and 
comparison conditions . To ensure that both the intervention and comparison groups are equally 
diverse in terms of organizational fa ctors relevant to tobacco control, we will stratify states using 
the following three criteria: (1) tobacco control policy progress, (2) smoking rates, and (3) funding 
for TC program. Tobacco control policy progress is operationalized as the American Lung 
Association’s (ALA) 2015 Smoke -free Score for each state.88–90 The ALA “grades” each state 
annually according to the comprehensiveness of its smoke -free policies (higher scores indicate 
more comprehensive smoke -free policies).  2013 adult  smoking rates are used for smoking rates90 
and funding is measured as the actual amount spent on tobacco control as a percentage of the CDC -
recommended amount of spending for FY2015.88,91 Together, these three indicators characterize 
states’ needs (smokin g rates), inputs (funding), and environments (policy). States will also be 
chosen based on willingness to participate and receipt of prior sustainability training.  Figure 3 is 
divided into quadrants by the median smoking rate and median Smoke -free Score. T he size of the 
circles within each quadrant represents the varying levels of funding. The quadrants delineate the 
primary selection guidelines. Six states from each quadrant representing varying levels of funding 
will be randomly assigned to either the int ervention or comparison group. This process will guard 
against selecting a disproportionate number of well - or poorly -funded programs for each group. 
Furthermore, it will ensure both the intervention and comparison groups are evenly varied in terms 
of need s and policy environments. All participants in this study are aged 18 years or older.  States 
agreeing  to participate in the study will learn of their group assignment after completing the PSAT.

 4.0 Participant Registration  
 
We will work with the Office on Smoking and Health (OSH) at the CDC to identify a list of state 
TC program manager s to contact during study recruitment/registration. We will contact all 
identified program manager s and invite them to participate in the study, as well as provide project 
fact sheets, outlining benefits and respons ibilities of being a part of the study . Once we divide 
states  into intervention or comparison  group, we will work with each state program manager  to 
identify  a sustainability workgroup consisting of 5 -12 members actively involved in TC initiatives 
in the state. In our experience , we have found that the desired organizational outcome 
(institutionalization) is best achieved if an integrated workgroup comprised of internal state hea lth 
department staff (i.e., the program coordinator and TC program director); external stakeholders 
(i.e., TC coalition members or national TC advocacy groups); and policy makers (especially if 
there is a TC champion in the state) complete the PSAT and act ively participate throughout the 6-
step action planning process. Therefore, the composition of each state program’s sustainability 
workgroup will not be  randomized.  
Participants receive a consent letter (Appendix D, attached) that details participation in the 
study. Participants are able to review this letter privately and for several days. To register, 
participants email the researc h project manager  identified in the letter. Participants are able to ask 
questions at all times using phone and email contact information for the research team located at 
Washington University in St. Louis.  
 
 
5.1 Treatment Plan  
 
Phase 1 (Aim 1)  
 
Delivery of Program Sustainability Action Planning Training (intervention protocol).  
The Program Sustainability Action Planning Training will be designed to assist states in 
completing each of the 6 steps in the action planning process and consists of thr ee components (1) 
pre-workshop preparation, (2) an in-person two day workshop, and (3) ongoing technical 
assistance and support. Each component will be defined by experiential  learning and participation 
by multiple stakeholders. A sustainability workgroup will be defined for each state consisting of 
5-12 members who are actively involved in TC initiatives in the state. To ensure training fidelity, 
delivery of all training components will be overseen by Dr. Sarah Moreland -Russell , Principal 
Investigator  and Ms. R ebecca  Vitale, Project Manager.  
Preparing for the workshop.  Approximately two months before scheduled workshop, we will 
work with the state tobacco control program manager to identify the list of TC stakeholders who 
will be involved in workgroup based on our standardized workgroup selection criteria.31 Once a 
list is determined, we will work with the program manager to plan a time to conduct an 
“Introduction to Sustainability ” webinar. This webinar educates listeners on the Program 
Sustainability Framework (8 domains), defines the parame ters one should use when completing 
PSAT items (i.e., define the “program”), explains how to complete the PSAT online, and provides 
a time for state -specific Q & A. Prior to the webinar, we will ask the program manager and all 
stakeholders to complete an optional  Qualtrics survey, assessing general state tobacco control 
program sustainability perceptions and individual demographics (age, gender, race, per NIH 
reporting requirements). Personally identifiable information will not be collected.  The pre-
PI: Moreland -Russell, Sarah  Sustainability Action Planning  
7 
 worksho p webinar is important for two reasons: (1) it familiarizes all workgroup members with 
the components of sustainability as outlined in our framework, and (2) introduces the PSAT and 
steps for completing the PSAT online. The webinar instructs users to answe r N/A to PSAT items 
they are unable to accurately assess. The pre -workshop webinar will last  45 minutes  and provide 
a forum for participants to ask questions about the project . The PSAT will be administered online 
to all workgroup members an d results will be aggregated into a report that will be disseminated to 
the participants prior to the start of the in person workshop.  There will also be follow -up 
correspondence, discussing s tate-level results of the PSAT , as well as recommendations for a ction 
planning next steps and a summary of resources.  
Workshop Day 1.  The workshops will take place in each state at the state health department 
(unless a more convenient site is determined). Trainers will follow an instructor manual and will 
provide an in teractive workbook  for completing the main goals for each day. This workbook will 
prompt users throughout the training to document reactions, ideas, and plans that arise in the 
workshop. The main goals for Day 1 will include defining the program and reviewing assessment 
results. Activities for Day 1 will include clarifying the program’s mission and vision and 
specifying the population it currently serves; reviewing the current activities a nd services that the 
program is implementing; and clarifying any program and organizational capacities that will be 
necessary to sustain the activities. PSAT scores will identify sustainability areas that need 
attention. These goals align with S teps 1 -2 of the Program Susta inability Action Planning Model.  
Workshop Day 2.  The main goal for Day 2 is to develop an action plan. Activities for Day 2 
include outlining action plan components including: (1) specific, measureable, attainable, realistic, 
and time -sensitive (SMART) objectives; (2) specific action steps (activities) for achieving 
objectives; (3) a timeline for completion of each objective; (4) persons responsible for completing 
each objective; (5) a clear definition of outcomes and measures f or successful completion of each 
objective and overall plan. The workbook will include activity handouts encouraging discussion 
around different  areas of program sustainability. Handouts will also include  templates for action 
planning and  materials for tracking technical assistance interactions. These goals align with Step 
3 of the Program Susta inability Action Planning Model.  
 
Technical Assistance and Support.  Following the in person two -day workshop, the state TC 
program will be responsible for executing the action plan and tracking its progress in achieving 
plan objectives (Steps 4 -6 in action pla nning model).  Technical assistance is an essential step in 
the proposed action planning process and will be focused on building each state program’s capacity 
for quality implementation of the action plan.92,93 Technical assistance built on best practice 
indicators17,92 –100 will include state -specific quarterly plan review and feedback, assistance in 
troubleshooting problems with step completion, sharing insights on plan successes from other 
similar states, and facilitating connections between  similarly -focused states. The research team 
will remain “on call” for states who need assistance beyond the planned quarterly calls. States will 
also have access to our website https://sustaintool.org , which contains a wealth of  information on 
general action plan execution and domain -specific resources to support plan completion and 
execution. The website is updated quarterly with new resources and materials. States will be 
encouraged to retake the PSAT at 12 months and repeat th e action planning cycle to revise their 
action plan based on PSAT results and environmental changes, using the indicators and process 
provided in the original training cycle.

Comparison state protocol  
Comparison state programs will par ticipate in the PSAT assessment, record abstraction , and a 
key informant interview and survey with state program managers  at three time points. Before 
taking the PSAT, we will work with the state tobacco control program manager to identify the list 
of TC s takeholders who will be involved in workgroup based on our standardized workgroup 
selection criteria.31 Once a list is determined, we will work with the program manager to plan a 
time to conduct an “Introduction to Sustainability ” webinar. This webinar is identical to the 
webinar issued to the intervention group, because state programs will be informed o f their group 
selection after completing the PSAT. The webinar educates listeners on the Program Sustainability 
Framework (8 domains), defin es the parameters one should use when completing PSAT items (i.e., 
define the “program”), explains how to complete the PSAT online, and provides a time for state -
specific Q & A. Prior to the webinar, we will ask the program manager and all stakeholders to 
complete an optional  Qualtrics survey, assessing general state tobacco control program 
sustainability perceptions and individual demographics (age, gender, race, per NIH reporting 
requirements). Personally identifiable information will not be collected.  The pre-workshop 
webinar is important for two reasons: (1) it familiarizes all workgroup members with the 
components of sustainability as outlined in our framework, and (2) introduces the PSAT and steps 
for completing the PSAT online. The webinar instructs u sers to answer N/A to PSAT items they 
are unable to accurately assess. The pre -workshop webinar generally lasts 45 minutes. Comparison 
states will receive a detailed sustainability assessment report outlining the state’s PSAT scores. 
There will also be follow -up correspondence, discussing state -level aggregated results of the 
PSAT, as well as recommendations for action planning next steps. At this point, we will provide 
a brief packet with resources about program sustainability. Howeve r, comparison states will not 
receive any other component of the training until year four of this project , when they we 
disseminate  the finalized curriculum materials. Some comparison states might independently 
implement sustainability plan s over the course of the grant. We will track implementation and 
account for it in analyses.  
 
 
Phase 2 (Aim 2)  
 
(Aim 2): Demonstrate change in sustainability outcomes in states who received the  Program 
Sustainability Action Planning training compared to states who did not . 
The overall goal  for the Program Sustainability Action Planning Training and subsequent 
dissemination activities is to increase capacity for sustainability of evidence -based state TC 
programs through the institutionalization of the prog ram. To determine the extent of reaching this 
goal, we will design a randomized  effectiveness trial to document differences in organizational 
and programmatic measures and Program Sustainability Assessment Tool scores between 
intervention and comparison states. We will rely on three  sources of data for this study: 1) state -
level program records for measures of predictors of sustainability and institutionalization,9,11 2) 
PSAT scores  and 3) a key in formant interview and survey with state program managers.  While we 
anticipate that our study will impact behavioral risk factors for tobacco -related diseases ( e.g., rates 
of smoking and initiation), the dependent variable for our study involves measures of  program 
institutionalization and sustainability.

 C.6.a. Data collection methods  
Pre-Introduction to Sustainability Webinar Survey  
All participants will receive an option al Qualtrics survey via email, prior to participating in the 
“Introduction to Sustai nability ” webinar. Participants will be asked program sustainability 
perception questions, as well as demographic questions (age, gender, race, per NIH reporting 
requirements). Personally identifiable information, such as the participant’s name , will not be 
collected.   
Program Sustainability Assessment Tool (PSAT)  
The PSAT has established reliability and face validity for effectively measuring program capacity 
for sustainability.43 The PSAT contains 40 questions (5 items per 8 domains) and is measured on 
a 1-7 scale where 1 indicates “To little or no extent” and 7 indicates “To a very great extent”. Users 
also have the option to choose N/A (Not able to answer), and are encouraged to do so if they are 
not familiar with that aspect of the program . The PSAT is directly linked to the eight domains 
outlined i n the sustainability framework. Since this framework will be used  to guide the action 
planning for each state, the scores from the PSAT will be important in assessing programmatic 
challenges and strengths related to sustainability. The sample for our survey is the workgroup 
defined by the program manager in each of the 24 participating states. We anticipate that 5 -12 
people in each state will complete the survey. PSAT scores are aggregated across participants for 
each state so that each state will have an overall PSAT score. Power calculations indicate that 
surveying wor kgroups in 24 states (12 intervention, 12 comparison) at three time points - 
intervention states at baseline and 12 and 24 months post training and comparison states at baseline 
and 12 and 24 months after baseline collection - will sufficiently capture group  differences (Figure 
4).  
The survey will be conducted online using established methods for Web -based surveys.102 To 
enhance the survey response, we will employ the well -established method developed by 
Dillman.103 First, all members of the sample will rece ive a personalized, advanced notice email. 
This helps to identify the purpose of the survey and establish its legitimacy. Second, approximately 
one week after the advance email is sent, all members of the workgroup receive the survey link. 
In all cases, th e replies to the surveys will be anonymous.  Third, approximately one week after 
completion of the PSAT, a follow -up email will be sent to all members of the sample. It will thank 
those who have already responded and request a response from those who have n ot yet responded. 
Finally, once data collection is closed, the workgroup members will receive a detailed 
sustainability report that includes their responses and an aggregated score for the program. For 
intervention states, this report will serve in the ass essment and planning phases. All 
correspondence will come from WU and the TCN (an important professional association for our 
sample). The CDC has also agreed to allow us to participate on the OSH Program Service Branch 
calls to make CDC program officers aw are of their state’s participation and for promotion of our 
study. We have had previous success with online administration of surveys including the PSAT. 
Response rate for PSAT administr ation across the six TC states was 86% (123 out of 143). In 
another st udy, in which we administered an email survey among all 50 state TC managers in three 
waves, with an overall response rate of 97%.51,78 In addition, we have years of experience and 
building partnerships with state TC programs and CDC -OSH.  
 
Program record  abstraction  
A review and abstraction of state level TC program public records will be performed for all 24 
states at three time points - baseline and at the annual CDC progress reporting time (June) in years 
PI: Moreland -Russell, Sarah  Sustainability Action Planning  
10 
 2 and 3. This will help in evaluating the impact o f the training intervention on the capacity for 
sustainability and institutionalization of the TC program within the organization.  
Step 1: Identifying relevant records and measures . Relevant state -level TC program records 
will be identified within the 24 selected states from various sources. First, all state tobacco 
programs are required by CDC ( DP15 -1509 funding requirements2) to submit an annual progress 
report. We will begin by using our consultants and empirical literature to identify relevant state -
level programmatic measures documented in these annual progress reports. We have also reviewed 
the DP15 -1509 funding requirements for relevance and have outlined the connection between state 
reporting requirements and established predictors of sustainability  and outcomes in Appendix C. 
This will increase our likelihood of retrieving all relevant information and provide empirical 
evidence with which to substantiate the responses in the PSAT and identify and address any 
potential bias therein.  In addition, for  those metrics not included in the report, we will review state 
health agency websites and publically available state-level government documentation. Dr. 
Brownson has extensive experience in collecting this type of information and has incorporated 
similar strategies in three other studies.  
Step 2: Data abstraction . TC program records will be reviewed and data will be abstracted by 
two trained evaluators using standardized methods and data collection tools created by the research 
team. The development and use of a standardized instrument for the review and abstraction will 
improve inter -rater reliability and will provide quantitative data for monitoring trends and 
intervention effects.  
Step 3: Establishing reliability and validity . Data  collected via record review and abstraction 
are subject to bias that may result from rater subjectivity.104 In order to determine the agreement 
between the two evaluators, a baseline reliability evaluation will be conducted early in the process 
to calcula te inter -rater reliability. In order to determine validity of self -reported data from the 
PSAT, agreement between self -reported and record -based information will be assessed. Both inter -
rater reliability and validity of self -reported data will be checked a t baseline and two other time 
points.  
 
Key Informant Interview and Survey  
In order to collect additional organizational metrics, a key informant interview and survey will be 
conducted with state program managers. These will be performed for all 24 states at three time 
points - baseline and in June during years 2 and 3. This will help in evaluating the impact of the 
training intervention on the capacity for sustainability and institutionalization of the TC program 
within the organization.  
Step 1: Identifying rele vant measures . Relevant state -level sustainability metrics  will be 
identified within the 24 selected states from various sources , including CDC Best Practices, ALA 
State of Tobacco Control, empirical literature, and consultation of our advi sory group .  
Step 2: Key Informant Interview and Survey . TC program managers will be contacted to 
complete a phone interview and survey.  The interview and survey will only collect organizational 
metrics  not collected in reporting records, and no personal  information will be collected.  We will 
record phone interviews   to ensure comprehensive analysis by trained abstracters . Prior to the 
interview, program managers will be provided a copy of the questions to be asked from a standard 
script created  by the research team. Each question is formatted in multiple choice, e,g,, “How long 
has the program been in existence?” [1: Less than 1 year; 2: 1 -3 years; 3: 3 -5 years ; 4:5-10 years; 
5: 10 or more years; 6: Don’t  know]. Using this method, program managers will provide 
unambiguous answers to data points not collected by record abstraction.   
PI: Moreland -Russell, Sarah  Sustainability Action Planning  
11 
 Step 3: Establishing reliability and validity . Data  collected via interview/survey and 
abstraction are subject to bias that may result from rater subjectivity.104 In order to determine the 
agreement between the two evaluators, a baseline reliability evaluation will be conducted early in 
the process to calculate inter -rater reliability. In order to determine validity of self -reported data 
from the PSAT, agreement betwe en self -reported, record -based information , and interview/survey 
information  will be assessed. Both inter -rater reliability and validity of self -reported data will be 
checked at baseline and two other time points.  
 
 
Phase 3 (Aim 3):  
C.7. (Aim 3): Actively disseminate The Program Sustainability Action Planning Model and 
Training Curricul um materials and study results to support future adoption.  
No treatment with intervention or comparison  groups will take place during this phase.

 C.6.d Statistical power  
To estimate the sample size needed for the study, an a priori 
power analysis was performed  using data from a natural 
experiment. The data consists of Pre and Post PSAT averages 
from previous work with five tobacco control programs that 
received action planning and trainin g, and five programs that 
did not receive action planning or training for which pre - and 
post-PSAT scores are available. To determine effect size, t -
tests of differences -in-means were conducted for the two 
groups using the changes in PSAT scores between the Pre and 
Post PSAT data. The standardized differences and t -statistics 
yielded an effect size of 1.25, which is a large effect size 
according to Cohen’s criteria.107 Using R statistical 
environment with packages from Del Re108 and Champely,109 
the effect size with power = 0.8 and α = 0.05 project the 
necessary sample size to be  approximately 9 (programs) per 
group. Since these calculations are based on a natural 
experiment, which we note occurred over a period of time that 
also saw changes to the recommended action planning,2 we 
are careful not to overstate the anticipated power  and 
therefore conservatively propose a sample size one -third 
larger than calculated, 12 per group as shown in Figure 4. This sample is also sufficient to measure 
the main goal of the study, to discern whether the training, and accompanying PSAT tool, 
significantly increase institutionalization of state TC programs.108–110  
 
C.6.e. Data analyses.  Descriptive statistics will be calculated (e.g., frequencies and measures of 
central tendency and dispersion), for both the intervention and comparison group at each of the 
three data collection time points to assess baseline averages and changes. Multipl e comparisons 
across groups and times will be drawn for independent and dependent variables. All continuous 
measures will be examined for non -normality and all relationships will be examined for linearity 
where applicable. Strategies for addressing issues encountered will be applied as necessary such 
as different functional forms, category scaling, and robust error calculations. In addition, the dose 
reception and delivery, and participant measures from Aim 1 (C.5.d). will be used to calculate rates 
of adop tion and implementation of training recommendations (intervention states) and other 
potential actions taken (comparison states, C.5.e).  
To incorporate the influence of idiosyncratic characteristics of the state programs, longitudinal 
regression analysis w ill be used to model the outcome for each of the dependent variables. This 
analysis is modeled in Equation 1.  
 
                    𝛽0+ 𝛽1𝑃𝑆𝐴𝑇 𝑖 𝑡=0+𝛽2𝐺𝑖+ 𝛽3𝐷𝑖𝑡+𝛽4(𝐺𝑖𝑡∗𝐷𝑖𝑡)+𝐵5−𝑘𝑋𝑖𝑡= 𝑌𝑖𝑡     
Equation 1  
 
where i = state, t = time  1 or 2, 𝑃𝑆𝐴𝑇 𝑖 𝑡=0 = baseline PSAT score, 𝐺𝑖 = group (intervention or 
comparison), 𝐷𝑖𝑡 = dose variable,  (𝐺𝑖𝑡∗𝐷𝑖𝑡) = an interaction between the group and dose terms, 
𝑋𝑖𝑡 = a vector of programmatic, organizational, community and funder v ariables, and 𝑌𝑖𝑡 = the Figure 4 . Sample size and power calculation

 outcome variable. This analysis will ultimately be used to test Hypothesis 1, that the impact of the 
training is nonzero and positive.

Hypothesis 1  
 
The multivariate approach allows us to account for the numerous influences found in 
programmatic, organizational, community, and funder attributes. Data collection at differ ent time 
points also allows for measuring changes in these variables, and the influence these changes have 
on institutionalization outcomes. In addition, the level of adoption and implementation of action 
plans both from the training (intervention states) and from other initiatives (comparison states) will 
vary across programs and time. Varying levels of action plan implementation across states must 
be acknowledged. Multivariate longitudinal analyses also allow us to control for differing degrees 
of dosage reception and delivery.  We have successfully used similar dose variables. 111,112 
 
10.0 Recordkeeping  
 
The Principal Investigator, Sarah Moreland -Russel l, will be responsible for monitoring the data 
safety and quality of the overall study. This is a minimal risk study that does not warrant a 
formal Data Safety Monitoring Board.  
 
Program Sustainability Assessment Tool (PSAT). The PSAT is a 40 -item measure of a program’s 
sustainability capacity which requires 10 -15 minutes to complete. Indivi duals selected by state 
TC program managers will be invited to complete the PSAT online via our secure website 
https://sustaintool.org/. Data collected through the website is automatically de -identified by the 
website and aggregated at the state level. E -mail addresses are collected on the site, but solely for 
website management, technical assistance, and user access. See Appendix A for full copy.  
 
Workshop Data Collection Form . Several process measures will be collected to assess the 
effectiveness of the t raining and support delivered. All measures will be collected via survey at 
the completion of each training component or tracked by review of programmatic records (i.e., 
action plan, meeting minutes). Quantitative data collected for this aim will be analyz ed using 
descriptive statistics. Qualitative analysis of programmatic records will be conducte d following 
procedures outlined. See Appendix B for full copy.   
Dosage delivered is the number of units of an intervention delivered or provided.101 For 
this study, this measure will be defined by the number of hours of training and technical 
assistance provided to each state.  
Dosage received is the extent to which participants engage with or use the materials 
provided.101 This will be measured by whethe r or not the action plan is completed and 
implemented, whether the workgroup utilizes the resources and materials provided, and 
the extent to which the action plan is implemented.  
Participant reactions will be measured by the extent to which the participa nts felt that the 
objectives of the training and technical assistance were achieved, satisfaction with the 
training and technical assistance and perceived usefulness of the training provided.  
 
PI: Moreland -Russell, Sarah  Sustainability Action Planning  
16 
 Data abstraction . State level TC program records will be reviewed and data will be abstracted by 
two trained evaluators using standardized methods and data collection tools created by the 
research team. Examples of variables of interest include: implementation of action p lan, amount  
and source of funding allocated for the implementation of tobacco control programs, size of the 
program and organization, and number of staff dedicated to support programmatic activity. 
Funding -related information will be collected from annual progress reports of state health 
departments, annual reports, and funding opportunities of funding agencies relevant to tobacco 
control. Abstraction will include only records that are publically available and only 
programmatic and organizational informatio n will be recorded. No individual identifying 
information will be recorded.  
 
Furthermore, the Prevention Research Center has developed a safety monitoring plan to address: 
1) training staff on data sensitivity and protocols for safeguarding confidentiality ; 2) storing and 
processing data in a secured, centralized location; 3) securing any hardcopy data in locked files 
when not in use; 4) removing names, addresses, and other direct identifiers from hardcopy and 
computer -readable data when they are no longer necessary for respondent tracking and then 
using encrypted codes for subsequent identification of participants; 5) destroying all identifiable 
linkages to data after data accuracy has been verified and final analyses have been completed; 6) 
using restricte d logon identification and password protection computer protocols for all 
computerized entry, retrieval, and analysis; 7) ensuring that the research team members and 
others with direct contact with participants and/or access to identifiable data complete h uman 
research certification (e.g., CITI, and other human research training programs); 8) including 
human research concerns as a standard agenda item for regular project meetings; 9) 
incorporating responsibility for the human research protection process int o the Project Manager’s 
job description; and 10) regular review of research data to ensure validity.   All data will be stored 
on a section of the Washington University in St. Louis password protected server protected by 
the university’s firewalls. The only  people who will have access to the raw survey data are the 
study staff and faculty based at the Washington University in St. Louis. Each has taken the CITI 
training and will be approved by the Washington University Institutional Review Board for this 
specific study.

Appendix A. Program Sustainability Assessment Tool (PSAT) Survey  
 
 
Program  Sustainability Assessment Tool  
  
 
What is program sustainability capacity?  
We define program sustainability capacity as the ability to maintain programming and its 
benefits over time .  
 
Why is program sustainability capacity important?  
Programs at all levels and settings struggle with their sustainability capacity. Unfortunately, 
when programs are forced to shut down, hard won improvements in public health, clinical care, 
or social service outcomes can dissolve. To maintain these benefit s to society, stakeholders must 
understand all of the factors that contribute to program sustainability. With knowledge of these 
critical factors, stakeholders can build program capacity for sustainability and position their 
efforts for long term success.  
 
What is the purpose of this tool?  
This tool will enable you to assess your program’s current capacity for sustainability across a 
range of specific organizational and contextual factors. Your responses will identify 
sustainability strengths and challeng es. You can then use results to guide sustainability action 
planning for your program.  
 
Helpful definitions  
This tool has been designed  for use with a wide variety of programs, both large and small, across 
different settings. Given this flexibility, it is important for you to think through how you are 
defining your program, organization, and community before starting the assessment.  
Belo w are a few definitions of terms that are frequently used throughout the tool.  
Program refers to the set of formal organized activities that you want to sustain over 
time. Such activities could occur at the local, state, national, or international level a nd in 
a variety of settings.  
Organization encompasses all the parent organizations or agencies in which the program 
is housed. Depending on your program, the organization may refer to a national, state, or 
local department, a nonprofit organization, a hos pital, etc.  
Community refers to the stakeholders who may benefit from or who may guide the 
program. This could include local residents, organizational leaders, decision -makers, etc. 
Community does not refer to a specific town or neighborhood.

For state employees who are not program managers:  Although your program manager will 
know who participates in the study, you do not have to participate  and your position and 
evaluations by your employer will not be affected by your choice.  Your program manager might 
changes to the way your state tobacco control program functions after the study.  If this occurs, it 
will be done separate from this resear ch project and you will continue to do your job as normal.  
 
Your state program will either be in the “intervention group” or the “control group”.  The 
intervention group will do some additional education activities.  
 
 
All states:  
We will ask you to attend a webinar during work hours introducing you to the study. Following 
this, we will ask you to complete an electronic survey tool through http://www.sustaintool.org , in 
which you will rate various aspects of your st ate-level tobacco control program. The webinar 
will take approximately one hour to complete, while the survey will take approximately twenty 
minutes to complete. On the survey, you are free to choose “Not Applicable” for any question 
you choose.   This surv ey will be repeated again 12 months after the study starts and a third time 
24 months after the study starts. Program managers will complete a survey through Qualtrics 
providing information about their program. Program managers will also complete an audio -
recordedphone interview with the research team for information about their program.  
 
 
Intervention States:  
The WUSTL research team will come to your office to deliver in -person workshops.  The 
workshop includes a discussion of the survey results as well as  a personalized training to 
establish action plans in fulfillment of CDC sustainability planning guidelines. You will also 
complete a short questionnaire rating your experience in the workshops.

Workshop Day 1:  
The main goals for Day 1 will include defi ning the program and reviewing survey results. We 
will clarify the program’s mission and vision and specify the population it currently serves.  We 
will review the current activities and services that the program is implementing and clarify any 
program and  organizational capacities that will be necessary to sustain the activities.  
 
Workshop Day 2:  
The main goal for Day 2 is to develop an action plan. We will outline action plan components 
including: (1) specific, measureable, attainable, realistic, and ti me-sensitive objectives;  
(2) specific action steps (activities) for achieving objectives;  
(3) a timeline for completion of each objective;  
(4) persons responsible for completing each objective;  
(5) a clear definition of outcomes and measures for succes sful completion of each objective and 
overall plan.  
 
Handouts will be provided including an action plan template and spreadsheets that allow for easy 
tracking and analysis of action plan outcomes.  
 
Following the workshops, you will receive a list of resources relevant to your program’s needs.  
Your program will be able to work with the WUSTL research team for technical assistance 
towards your action plans.  
 
Will you save my research data to use in f uture research studies?   
 
As part of this study, we are obtaining  survey data from you. We would like to use this  data for 
studies going on right now as well as studies that are conducted in the future.   These studies may 
provide additional information that will be helpful in understanding  how to best improve tobacco 
control programs.  It is unlikely  that what we learn from these studies will have a direct benefit 
to you .  There are no plans to provide financial compensation to you for use of your data.  By 
allowing us to use your data you give up any property rights you may have in the data.

Audio/Video Recording or Photographs  
 
One aspect of this study involves making  audio recordings . Only interviews with program 
managers will be recorded. Interactions with participants that are not program managers will not 
be recorded by the research team. The research team will record audio from interviews with 
program managers to ensure accurate transcription of answers collected over the phone . Because 
of this, audio recording is not optional for program managers. Only members of the research 
team at Washington University will have access to these recordings, and they will not be released 
outside of the research team in any way. The recordings will be destroyed at the conclusion of 
the study.

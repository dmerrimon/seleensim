Title of Study:  
  
A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Confirmatory Phase 2 Study Assessing 
the Safety, Tolerability and Long- term Efficacy of Bryostatin in the Treatment of Moderately 
Severe Alzheimer’s Disease Subjects Not Receiving Memantine Treatment  
Study cen ter(s):  Approximately 20 sites in United States (US)  
 
Protocol Number:  NTRP -101-204 
 
Study Duration:  Approximately 2 years  Study Phase: 2 
 
Objective:   
 
Primary objective:  
To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and long- term efficacy of bryostatin 1 (hereafter referred 
to as bryostatin) for the treatment of moderately severe Alzheimer’s disease (AD).  
Study Drug :   Bryostatin 1 or matching Placebo  
Route of Administration: Intravenous by continuous infusion over 45±5 minutes  
Number of Subjects : Approximately  100 subjects (approximately 220 subjects screened)  
Study Design  
This is a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled, Phase 2 study comparing bryostatin-1 to placebo for long- term efficacy in the treatment of moderately severe AD ( Mini Mental 
State Examination, 2
nd edition  scores of 10- 18 at baseline)  in the absence of  memantine. 
Eligible subjects will receive 7 doses of bryostatin (i.v., 20μg) or matching placebo during the first 12 weeks. A second course of treatment consisting of 7 doses will begin 30 days after the final dose of the first treatment period. Cognitive tests will be assessed  at intervals 
during the study and 30 days after the final dose of study drug.  The primary endpoint is the total SIB score assessment obtained at Week 28, following completion of 2 courses of treatment.  
Randomization and Treatment  
Eligible subjects will be stratified based on baseline SIB total scores and will be randomized 1:1 to one of two treatment arms: 20µg bryostatin or placebo for twelve weeks , the first 
treatment period . The first two doses of study drug will be a loading dose 20% higher (i.e., 
24µg) than the assigned dose and will be administered one week apart.  Thereafter, the assigned dose of 20µg will commence with the third dose and be administered every other 
week. The second course of treatment will be identical to th e first, beginning 30 days after

completion of the first course.  Drug is administered IV by continuous infusion over 4 5(±5) 
minutes.  Subjects are scheduled to receive seven doses over 12 weeks during the first 
treatment p eriod  and seven doses over 12 weeks during the second treatment period.  The 
same treatment assigned at randomization will be administered during the second treatment 
period.  
 Cognitive Assessments  
• Severe Impairment Battery (SIB)  
• Mini Mental State Examination, 2
nd edition (MMSE-2) 
• Alzheimer’s Disease Cooperative Study – Activities of Daily Living - Severe 
Impairment Version (ADCL- ADL -Sev)  
• Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) metrics. 
 
Safety Assessments 
 
• Treatment emergent adverse events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)  
• Vital signs, physical examination including body weight 
• ECG parameters  
• Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  (C-SSRS), and  
• Clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, blood chemistry) 
 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary effica cy endpoint is the change from the pre- treatment baseline in the Severe 
Impairment Battery (SIB) total score at Week 28, after two 12- week courses of treatment.   
 
Secondary Efficacy End points   
 
• SIB total score at the end of the Week 42 follow- up visit , for subjects who completed 
week 42  
• SIB total score from baseline at Week 13  
• SIB total scores  from baseline at Weeks 9 , 20, 24 and 30 
• SIB total scores from baseline at Weeks 9 , 20, 24 and 30 for subjects  with baseline  
MMSE -2 scores of 10-14 and 15-18 
• SIB trends over time; individual -specific slopes of total SIB scores will be obtained for 
all patients.

Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
• Change from baseline in ADCS -ADL -Sev total score at Week 13  and Week 42, for 
subjects who completed week 42 
• Change from baseline in MMSE- 2 total score at Week 13  and Week 42, for subjects 
who completed week 42 
• Change from baseline in NPI total score at Week 13  and Week 42, for subjects who 
completed week 42 
•  
Statistical Considerations:  
 
The primary objective for efficacy is to evaluate whether bryostatin is better than the control with respect to the primary and secondary SIB endpoints. Efficacy analyses will be conducted for the full analysis set (FAS), consistent with the modified intention -to-treat principle, defined as all randomized subjects who received at least 
one dose of randomized study medication and who had at least one post- baseline efficacy 
assessment.  
The per protocol analysis set (PP) is defined as all patients completing the study without 
major  protocol deviations.  To be included, subjects must have received at least 11  of the14 
doses (80%).  The completer analysis set (CAS) will be defined as all randomized subjects who completed two 12- week  course s of treatment, and who have a Week  28 SIB assessment.  
Efficacy analys es will also be conducted for the PP and CAS sets.  
 
Adverse event and other safety data will be analyzed descriptively in all subjects who received any dose of study drug (including partial infusions).  These data will be summarized 
by treatment group and by time in study.

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 19 of 82 1 INTRODUCTION   
1.0 Alzheimer’s  disease  
Alzheimer’s disease is the most common cause of dementia, affecting approximately 5.3 
million people in the United States (US) and 30 million people worldwide.  There is a disproportionate representation of women with nearly 2/3 of the affected individuals being female.  Of the 5.3 million a ffected Americans , 5.1 million  are older than 65  (Alzheimer’s 
Association website www.alz .org, 2015).   Since aging is the single most important risk factor 
for development of dementia and medical advances are prolonging survival, the incidence of AD will increase.  The US Census Bureau data suggest that the number of individuals living until age 100 between the years 2000 and 2020 will increase by more than 200% and the number of individuals living until age 90-95 will double.
4   By 2050 the number of 
individuals with Alzheimer’s disease will almost trip le to a projected 13.8 million.  In  2013, 
15.5 million family and friends provided 17.7 billion hours of unpaid  care to those with 
Alzheimer’s and other dementias – care valued at $220.2 billion (Alzheimer’s Association website  www.alz.org , 2015).  
The currently approved treatments for AD provide modest symptomatic benefit and do not alter the disease progression.  These therapies primarily consist of cholinesterase inhibitors [tacrine (Cognex), donepezil (Aricept), rivastigmine (Exelon), and galantamine (galanthamine, Reminyl)] and the N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, memantine 
(Namenda).  The development of a medication that produces a significant improvement in clinical symptoms and/or slows the progression of the disease would be a significant advance in the therapeutics of AD. 
The 
protein kinase C  (PKC ) signaling pathways have been shown to play an integral role in 
learning and memory. Several animal models have demonstrated that PKC is involved in the 
learning process.5, 6  In addition, PKC activity regulates phosphorylation of Tau and cleavage 
of Aβ amyloid through its effects on alpha secretase and GSK3β.13  The single most 
important risk factor for the sporadic form of AD , increased age, has also been linked to 
impaired PKC -mediated α- secretase activation .7  Aged animal models, for example, have 
shown age-specific changes of PKC isozyme distribution in the brain,8, 9 impaired PKC 
translocation, reduced levels of the PKC anchoring protein, RACK1,10 alterations in mitogen 
activated protein (MAP) kinase Erk1/2,11 and reduced levels of the α -secretase cleaved 
Amyloid Precursor Protein  (APP), soluble amyloid precursor prot ein alpha (sAPPα), in the 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).12  Aging of normal human fibroblasts also reduced secretion of 
sAPPα.   
The demonstration of reduced levels of PKC in the brain of Alzheimer’s subject s suggests a 
potential target to improve cognition in AD is the activation of PKC which in turn activates a 
series of downstream pathways that enhance synaptic function and promote synaptogenesis. Bryostatin is a potent stimulator of PKCε and is non-tumorigenic. Hongpaisan et.al 
13 have 
recently demonstrated the cognitive benefits and the effect on synaptogenesis in two strains of transgenic AD mice.  Their work was recently reproduced by Schrott, et.al.
14 Activation of 
PKCε by bryostatin was associated with reduced levels of β amyloid, increased levels  of the 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-204

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 20 of 82 Brain Derived Neurotropic Factor (BDNF) , prevention of synapse loss, reduced plaque 
formation and restored memory and learning even in the presence of plaques.  
1.1 Rationale for the use of bryostatin in the treatment of AD  
The pharmacological basis for the use of bryostatin for the treatment of AD is based on the 
hypothesis that low dose, intermittent administration of bryostatin will activate PKC isozymes α and ε. Activation of PKC is associated with:  
• Enhanced associative learning and recent memory via PKC-mediated phosphorylation 
of downstream substrates 
• Increased synthesis of proteins such as MAP kinase Erk1/2, and synaptogenic proteins such as BDNF required for long- term memory  
• Activat ion of α -secretases, thereby increasing non-toxic fragment s of the beta-
amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) and reducing the neurotoxic fragment of βAPP, 
Aβ
1-42, and the associated neuropathology 
• Activat ion of Aβ 1-42 – degrading enzymes  
• Phosphorylation of GSK-3 beta, inhibiting production of Tau and the associated 
neuropathology 
• Improved memory and learning in 3 different strains of transgenic mice with single or 
multiple Alzheimer’s gene mutations even in  the presence of amyloid plaque 13-15  
 
Thus, activation of PKC can enhance existing synaptic function, reduce the toxic effects of amyloid and promote synaptogenesis, all potential targets to improve cognitive function in 
AD.  
1.2 Pharmacokinetics , Toxicology and Drug Metabolism in Animals   
Single dose toxicity of bryostatin has been characterized in four non-GLP studies conducted 
under National Cancer Institute’s ( NCI) IND, including three IV toxicity studies in mice and 
one IV toxicity study in rats.  Bryostatin was evaluated in a single GLP –repeated dose 21-day 
IV toxicity study in rats.  The single dose toxicity  studies were conducted using two different 
dosing formu lations: bryostatin in ethanol/saline or bryostatin in polyethylene glycol, 
ethanol, and 
Tween 80 ( PET) diluent.  LD 50 ranged from a low of 38µg/kg to 75µg/kg.  The 
21-day repeat -dose toxic study performed in rats at doses of 0, 10, 15 and 25µg/m2 with the 
ethanol/saline formulation  resulted in  no relevant toxicology findings.  The  maximum 
tolerated dose ( MTD ) and  no adverse effect level  (NOAEL ) were noted to be 25µg/m2 the 
highest dose studied.  However , since there were no toxicologically relevant findings, the 
report  suggested that the MTD and NOAEL are greater than  25µg/m2. 
Two preliminary dose range finding IV toxicology studies were performed in the rat and dog to characterize the toxicity of  bryostatin and to estimate the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) 
when administered by bolus injection and continuous infusion.  In the Sprague- Dawley rat 
bryostatin was tolerated up to 10µg/kg (infusion) and  15ug/kg (bolus) with no significant 
differences in t oxicity noted between the two routes of administration.  In the beagle dog 
bryostatin was tolerated at doses up to 15µg/kg (infusion and  bolus).  There were no

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 21 of 82 significant differences in toxicity between the two routes of administration.  A more detailed 
results summary can be found in the Investigator’s Brochure. 
Limited pharmacokinetics ( PK) data are available in animals .  The pharmacokinetics of 
bryostatin  was analyzed in female CD1/F2 mice by using [C26- 3H]-labeled bryostatin 
following IV and IP administration (Zhang et al 1996).  Following IV administration of 
40µg/kg (120mg/m2), the plasma disappearance curve for bryostatin could be described by a 
2-compartment model, with a distribution t ½ of 1.05 hours and an elimination t ½ of 22.96 
hours.  In contrast, following IP administration, the plasma disappearance curve was better described by a first-order absorption one-compartment model, with an absorption t
½ of 0.81 
hours and an elimination t ½ of 28.76 hours. 
Urinary excretion represented the major pathway of elimination in the first 12 hours after IV administration, with 23.0 ± 1.9% (mean ± standard deviation) of the administered dose excreted. Approximately equal amounts of radioactivity (40%) were excreted in feces compared with urine within 72 hours after IV administration.  A greater area under the curve, longer mean resident time, and lower clearance were observed with IP administration compared with IV administration.   Bryostatin  was widely distributed to various tissues 
following both IV and IP administration.  However, accumulation was observed in the lung, liver, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and fatty tissue.  
1.3 Genotoxicity  
Bryostatin  1 was evaluated using the bacterial reverse mutation assay (i.e., the Ames test)  
with no positive responses observed.  Bryostatin  1 was evaluated as negative 
(nonclastogenic) in the micronucleus assay; it was also evaluated as negative (non -DNA 
damaging) in the Comet Assay.  Overall, based on the results of the Ames test and the combined micronucleus/comet assay, bryostatin 1 is  not considered to be genotoxic. 
2 CLINICAL TRIAL DATA 
2.0 Oncology Data  
Safety data are available from published clinical studies of bryostatin for the treatment of cancer.  Altogether, over 1400 oncology subjects received b ryostatin , mainly under NCI’s 
IND # 42,780, with exposures to bryostatin in both single and combination agent studies.  About 584 subject s received bryostatin as monotherapy, with dose levels ranging from 
5μg/m
2 to >1 80μg/m2.  Most subject s in both the monotherapy and combination therapy 
studies received bryostati n at doses >25μg/m2, most often as 1 -hour infusions administered at 
various time intervals from weekly infusion to continuous infusions for 72 hours.  Most studies were repeated dose studies w here subjects received treatment for several weeks  (See 
Investigators Brochure).  
Adverse events occurring in the single agent studies that resulted in discontinuation from the 
studies were myalgia (28  subject s), acute transient reaction (dyspnea, flushing, hypotension, 
and bradycardia; 4 subjects each), phlebitis (attributed to ethanol in the formulations, 6 
subject s), fatigue (3  subject s), and 1 subject each with bacteremia, chest pain, dehydration,

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 22 of 82 dysphagia, hematuria, nausea, skin rash, subclavian vein thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and 
vomiting.  The following AEs were associated with death in the single agent tr ials: cardiac 
arrest (2), hypotensive with evidence of renal and hepatic failure (1), perforated gastric ulcer (1), renal functi on decline with cardiac arrest and perforated gastric ulcer (1; PI s considered 
not related to bryostatin), and sudden death (1; PI s considered likely to be cardiovascular 
event).  Relatedness to bryostatin treatment was not assessed except where noted.  
Other severe (Grade 3 or higher) AEs reported in the single agent clinical studies in cancer 
subject s included: alkaline phosphatase (ALP) (elevated; subject  had pre- existing liver 
metastases), allergic reaction, anemia, anorexia, arthralgia, ataxia, cardiac arrhythmias, 
cardiovascular, coagulation, community-acquired pneumonia, congestive heart failure, constipation, dermatitis, dermatologic, diarrhea, dyspnea, edema/weight gain, fever, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, granulocytopenia, headache, hepatic, hyperbilirubinemia, hyperglycemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, infection, leg weakness, lymphedema, lymphocytopenia, myocardial infarction, neurotoxicity, neutropenia, pain (abdominal, back, eye, site not specified), pulmonary, pulmonary embolus from inferior vena cava tumor thrombus, sepsis and pneumonia without neutropenia, syncope, and urinary frequency. 
The absence of a Placebo -control group in bryostatin oncology studies makes it difficult to 
determine the extent to which underlying disease or concomitant medications may have 
contributed to this safety profile.   
2.1 Alzheimer’s  Disease  Data 
2.1.1 Study NTRP101-203 
NTRP 101-203 was a rando mized, double-blind, placebo -contro lled, phase 2 trial asse ssing 
the safety, tolerability (primary objective) and efficacy (secondary objective) of bryostatin in 
the tr eatment of moderately severe to sever e Alzheimer’ s disease subjects.  This study was 
intended to confirm the results of study NTRP101-202 both in safety and efficacy for subjects not receiving concurrent memantine treatment at time points through Week 15. 
2.1.1.1 
Methodology 
 
The study was designed to have an initial telephonic prescreening, followed by an actual screening period where the eligible subjects were selected and s tratified based on MMSE-2 
scores: 4 -9 vs. 10- 15 and randomized 1:1 to either 20μg bryostatin or placebo treatment arm, 
and then treated for 12 weeks. The study drug was administered via continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 45(±5) minutes. The first tw o doses of study drug administered were a loading dose 20% higher (i.e., 
24μg) than the assigned treatment given one week apart. Subsequently, the assigned doses of 20μg were commenced as the third dose and were delivered every other week.  The primary endpoint for this study was the change from baseline to Week 13 in the Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) total score.  The changes from baseline at Weeks 5, 9, and 15 in the 
SIB total score, and the changes from baseline at each tested time point for subjects in each

over time in SIB total score were evaluated via Weeks 0, 5, 9 and 13. Exploratory outcome measures were:  change from baseline in Alzheimer’s Disease 
Cooperative Study - Activities of  Daily Living – Severe Impairment Version (ADCS -ADL -
Sev) total score, c hange from baseline in Mini Mental State Examination, 2
nd edition 
(MMSE -2) total score , change from baseline in the 10-point Neuropsychiatric Inventory 
(NPI) total score , and Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale (CGI- I) score . 
 
2.1.1.2 Demographics  
A sum total of 217 subjects signed the informed consent forms. Of these subjects, 106 subjects were screen  failed. The most commo n cause of screen failures was subject’s lacking 
to fulfill the  inclusion /exclusion criteria for eligibility of the study. A total of 111 subjects 
were randomized to bryostatin (55 subjects) and placebo (56) treatment arms. Of the s ubjects 
randomized to bryostatin, 96.4% (96.4%, 53/55) received treatment. The study was completed by 87.3% subjects (87.3%, 48/55) and the remaining seven subjects (12.7%,7/55) did not complete the study primarily due to withdrawal by subject (9.1%, 5/55) followed by protocol deviation and adverse event (1.8%, 1/55 each). Of 56 subjects assigned to placebo treatment, 98.2% (98.2%, 55/56) received placebo. Of these, 85.7% (85.7, 48/56) completed the study and 14.3% (14.3%, 8/56) terminated due to either subject withdrawal (5.4%,3/56), adverse event, lost to follow up, physician’s decision, death or other reasons (1.8%, 1/56 each). Approximately 56% of subjects (56.5%, 61/108) in the Safety Analysis Set were females. The majority of the  subjects were white (84.3%, 91/108) and not of Hispanic or Latino 
background. The mean (SD) age of the subjects in the Safety Analysis Set was 72 years.  
 No disparities between the study treatment groups were noted in majority of the baseline characteristics; however, there is a 5 unit difference in the baseline total score of Severe Impairment Battery (SIB), indicating subjects with a greater impairment we re randomized  to 
the bryostatin group. The mean baseline SIB score of the two randomized populations were 73.7 in bryostatin group and 78.6 for the placebo group.  
 
2.1.1.3 
Safety  
 
A total of 116 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported for 47 subjects in the study (43.5%,47/108). In bryostatin group, 57 AEs were reported by 23 subjects (43.4%, 23/53). In the placebo group, 59 AEs were reported by 24 (43.6%, 24/55) subjects. The majority of AEs were either mild or moderate. A total of 16 related AEs were reported in 11 subjects (10.2%, 11/108). There were 7 related AEs reported for 5 subjects (9.4%, 5/53) in the bryostatin group, and 9 related  AEs for 6 subjects (10.9%; 6/55) in placebo group. A total of 15 serious adverse 
events (SAE) were reported for 11 subjects (10.2%, 11/108) in bryostatin and placebo groups combined. One reported AE in placebo group resulted in death. A total of four AEs led to drug withdrawal in one subject (0.9%, 1/108). A sum total of 12 AEs led to interruption in drug scheduling regimen (4.6%, 5/108). 11 subjects reported 15 SAEs together in bryostatin and placebo groups. However, all of the 15 observed SAEs were considered to be ‘unlikely related’

to the placebo group and the cause of death is unknown. Details regarding adverse events can be 
found on ClinicalTrials.gov, study identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED].  
 
 
2.1.1.4 Efficacy  
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the change in the SIB total score from baseline 
to Week 13. Severe Impairment Battery (SIB) scoring is used to assess cognition in subjects with moderate and severe AD and is a useful outcome measure in advanced stages of disease. Forty questions are included with a point score range of 0-100. Lower scores indicat e greater 
cognitive impairment. The mean baseline SIB score of the two randomized populations were 73.7 in bryostatin group and 78.6 for the placebo group. At week 13, the mean SIB score for bryostatin and placebo reached 76.0 and 80.9, respectively. An average increase of 1.3 point and 2.1 points was observed for the bryostatin and placebo groups, respectively at Week 13 and the difference between the treatment groups was not statistically significant.  
 
2.1.1.5 
Summary  
The bryostatin treatment group showed minimal differences from the placebo treatment 
group in safety assessments , with  an imbalance of 4.6 units in the baseline SIB scores 
between the bryostatin treatment group and the placebo group. The majority of AEs were 
either mild or moderate.  There were no statistically significant bryostatin/placebo 
differences in efficacy assessments.   
2.1.2 Study NTRP101-202  
NTRP 101-202 was a rando mized, double-blind, placebo -contro lled, phase 2 trial asse ssing 
the safet y and tolerabilit y (primary objective)  and efficacy (secondary objective) of bryostatin 
in the tr eatment of moderately severe to sever e Alzheimer’ s disease subjects.  Exploratory 
objectives characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics of bryostatin in 
this subject population. Seven doses of study drug were administered by a 45- minute 
continuous intravenous (IV) infusion over 12 weeks.  
2.1.2.1 
Methodology 
Eligible subjects with moderately severe to severe AD were stratified based on Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE -2) scores 4 -9 vs. 10-15 and randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment 
arms: 20μg, 40μg, or placebo for twelve weeks. Trial drug was adm inistered IV by 
continuous infusion. The first two doses (24μg, 48μg) of each of the two active treatment arms were a loading dose, 20% higher than the assigned dose (20μg, 40μg), and were administered one week apart. Thereafter, the assigned dose commenced with the third dose and was administered every other week. Subjects were scheduled to receive seven doses over 12 weeks, with the primary efficacy measure being at Week 13, and a follow-up visit scheduled 30 days from the last dose of trial drug administration.

CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 25 of 82 2.1.2.2 Demographics  
A total of 264 subjects were screened in the trial. Of these, 147 subjects were randomized on 
a 1:1:1 basis to a treatment group. There were 50 subjects randomized to the placebo treatment group, 49 randomized to the 20μg bryostatin treatment group, and 48 randomized to the 40μg bryostatin treatment group. A total of 141 of the randomized subjects were 
treated with investigational product (IP) and were included in the Safety Analysis Set (SAS). A total of 135 subjects provided a post- baseline efficacy assessment and were analyzed as the 
Full Analysis Set (FAS). A total of 113 subjects out of 147 randomized (76.9%) performed a Week 13 evaluation of the SIB and were analyzed as the Completer Analysis Set (CAS). A total of 106 subjects in the SAS completed the trial (75.2%). A total of 35 subjects in the SAS and 29 subjects in the FAS withdrew early from the trial. The most common reason for early withdrawal was withdrawal of consent (18 subjects), followed by AE (11 subjects).  
2.1.2.3 
Safety  
Overall, the 20μg bryostatin treatment group showed minimal differences from the placebo treatment group in safety assessments. The 40μg bryostatin treatment group had significantly greater AEs than the other treatment groups. There was also no clear difference in Serious Adverse events (SAEs) between the 20μg bryostatin group and placebo treatment groups, and again the 40μg bryostatin treatment group had significantly greater SAEs than the other treatment group.  Similarly, the placebo and 20μg group had similar numbers of TEAEs (28 events vs 30 events, respectively). The TEAEs observed more often in the 20μg treatment group vs placebo were infusion site reaction (8 events vs 3 events in placebo) and diarrhea (5 events vs 1 event in placebo). The 40μ g treatment group was associated with more TEAEs than either 
the 20μg or placebo treatment groups across multiple system organ classes (SOC).  The most common treatment related TEAEs were grouped infusion reactions, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, and myalgia. Myalgia was seen in 5 subjects; 4 of those subjects were given the higher dose of bryostatin. Myalgia observed was mostly mild and managed with analgesics. There were also more treatment related TEAEs of diarrhea, headache,  and fatigue 
in the higher dose bryostatin group. Both bryostatin treatment groups reported higher rates of infusion site TEAEs, and in particular the 40μg bryostatin treatment group reported 4 events of infusion site cellulitis. Although IV infusion- related reactions were also reported  more 
often in the higher dose bryostatin group, none were reported following WebEx- based 
training on IV infusion and universal precautions, suggesting that this AE can be prevented.  The higher dose bryostatin group also reported more TEAEs of seizure and fall compared to 
the lower dose bryostatin and placebo groups.  A total of 97 (68.8%) subjects in all treatment groups reported 287 separate TEAEs. Of these, 49 (34.8%) subjects reported 107 separate treatment-related TEAEs. There were 8 (16.7%) subjects with 20 treatment-related TEAEs in the placebo treatment group, 17 (37.0%) subjects with 30 events in the 20μg bryostatin treatment group, and 24 (51.1%) subjects with 57 events in the 40μg bryostatin treatment group. Six subjects had a TEAE that lead to t rial 
drug discontinuation, 2 in the placebo treatment group, 1 in the 20μg bryostatin treatment group, and 3 in the 40μg bryostatin treatment group.  Overall, 43 (30.5%) subjects had a TEAE that was mild in intensity, 46  (32.6%) subjects had a TEAE that was moderate in 
intensity, and 8 (5.7%) subjects had a TEAE that was severe in intensity.

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 26 of 82 There was 1 death in the trial, a subject in the 40μg bryostatin treatment group who suffered 
a severe TEAE of worsening of AD that was unrelated to the IP.  There were 12 (8.5%) subjects who had 14 treatment emergent non-fatal SAEs during the trial; 4 subjects with 4 events in the placebo treatment group, 2 subjects with 2 events in the 20μg bryostatin treatment group, and 6 subjects with 8 SAEs in the 40µg bryostatin t reatment 
group. A total of 4 subjects in the 40μg bryostatin treatment group had 4 events that were judged as possibly or probably related to the IP: 3 events of cellulitis, and 1 event of seizure.  
There were no apparent differences between treatment group s in laboratory assessments over 
time.  No differences were apparent between treatment groups when examining most vital signs, PEs, and ECG. However, there was a decline in weight in the bryostatin groups, which was more prominent in the higher dose group: 20μg bryostatin treatment group (mean loss of -1.65±2.77kg) and the 40μg bryostatin treatment group ( -2.98±2.10kg), while there was a 
slight weight gain in the placebo treatment group (0.442±2.52kg). Further, 5 subjects in the 40μg bryostatin treatment gr oup had 5 TEAEs of weight decreased, 3 of which were judged 
to be related to the IP. No weight related TEAEs were observed in the 20μg bryostatin dose group.  There were no differences between treatment groups on the C-SSRS as most subjects did not have su icidal thoughts during the trial, and there were no attempts at suicide by any subject 
during the trial.

2.1.2.4 Efficacy  
Consistent with the initial hypothesis for bryostatin effects on PKC ε and cognition, treatment 
with 20μg of bryostatin is effective in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease in a FAS and CAS. The overall weight of data shows that subjects treated with 20μg bryostatin displayed signific ant improvement on the SIB, ADCS -ADL -Sev, and other secondary and exploratory 
endpoints (one- sided at α=0.10) , as outlined below. 
Baseline scores on the SIB for the FAS were similar across all treatment groups. In the FAS, the treatment difference between the placebo treatment group and the 20μg bryostatin treatment group was statistically significant only at Week 5 (treatment difference 3.0[0.6, 5.3]
80%CI  P=0.056). There were no statistically significant differences between the placebo 
treatment group and either the 20μg bryostatin treatment group or 40μg bryostatin treatment 
group at Week 9 or Week 13. Combining the bryostatin treatment groups and comparing with the placebo treatment group also did not produce a statistically significant difference at any time point.  For the CAS, pre-specified along with FAS to assess primary and secondary endpoints, mean scores on the SIB followed the same pattern seen in the FAS. Baseline scores were similar across all treatment groups. There was a statistically signific ant difference, however, between 
the placebo treatment group and the 20μg bryostatin treatment group at Week 5 (P=0.016), and the treatment difference at Week 13 was also statistically significant (P=0.070). Further, when both bryostatin treatment groups w ere pooled, there was a statistically significant 
difference between the placebo treatment group and pooled group at Week 5 (P=0.039) and a statistically significant treatment difference at Week 13 (P=0.094). There were no

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 27 of 82 statistically significant differe nces between the placebo treatment group and the 
40μg bryostatin treatment group at any time point. 
In the CAS there were significant differences in the ADCS -ADL -Sev at Week 13 between 
the placebo treatment group and the 20μg bryostatin treatment group (P= 0.082), and between 
the placebo treatment group and pooled bryostatin treatment group (P=0.087). There were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups for the ADCS -ADL -Sev, 
MMSE -2, NPI, or CGI-I assays for any time point in the FAS. 
In multiple exploratory analyses adjusting for covariates for the primary endpoint, there were additional significant differences between the placebo treatment group and bryostatin treatment groups. In an MMRM analysis of change from baseline in SIB total score, excluding all subjects from sites that recruited 2 or fewer subjects during the trial, there was a significant difference between the placebo treatment group and the 20μg bryostatin treatment group at Week 5 (P=0.068). There was a significant differ ence between the placebo treatment 
group and the 20μg bryostatin treatment group (P=0.031), and between the placebo treatment group and the pooled bryostatin treatment group in an MMRM analysis of change from baseline in SIB total score at the 30 -day follow up visit (P=0.041). When an ANCOVA was 
performed to assess site effect on SIB, there was a significant difference between the placebo treatment group and 20μg bryostatin treatment group (P=0.032), and between the placebo treatment group and pooled bryost atin treatment groups (P=0.049) at Week 5. In an 
ANCOVA of change from baseline in SIB total score, with use of AChEI or memantine at baseline as an additional covariate, at Week 5 the 20μg bryostatin treatment group and pooled bryostatin treatment groups had statistically significant treatment differences from the placebo treatment group (P=0.024 and P=0.027, respectively).  
In multiple exploratory analyses adjusting for covariates for secondary endpoints, there were statistically significant differences between the placebo treatment group and the 20μg bryostatin treatment group at Week 5 (P=0.062), and the placebo treatment group and pooled bryostatin treatment group at Week 5 (P=0.041) when performing an ANVOCA of change from baseline in ADCS -ADL -Sev total score for subjects with > median baseline ADCS -
ADL -Sev total score. There was a statistically significant difference betw een the placebo and 
40μg bryostatin treatment groups at Week 5 (P=0.099) in an ANCOVA of change from baseline in NPI Total score to assess site affects. When performing an ANVOCA of change from baseline in NPI total score for subjects with > median baselin e NPI total score, there 
were statistically significant differences between the placebo treatment group and the 40μg bryostatin treatment group at Week 9 (P=0.054) and Week 13 (P -0.096).  
No clear differences were apparent between treatment groups for Caregiver distress on the NPI, each NPI subscore at baseline, or on the NPI 10- item score.  
The results for SIB score from the MSSE- 2 Stratum 1 analysis show the 20μg bryostatin 
treatment group had a more positive response than any treatment group at Week 5 and Week 9 and the 40μg bryostatin treatment group had a slightly better response at Week 13. Results for SIB score in the MSSE-2 Stratum 2 analysis show the positive response varied across time point and treatment group. The placebo treatment group showed gr eater improvement in 
ADCS -ADL -Sev total score at Weeks 5 and 9 than either bryostatin treatment group in 
Stratum 1 or 2, and also at Week 13 in Stratum 2. At Week 13 in Stratum 1, the 20μg bryostatin treatment group showed the best response compared to placebo or the 40μg bryostatin treatment group.

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 28 of 82 There was a significant difference in the FAS between the placebo treatment group and the 
20μg bryostatin treatment group (P=0.031), and between the placebo treatment group and the pooled bryostatin treatment group (P=0.041) in an MMRM analysis of change from baseline in SIB total score at the 30 -day follow up visit. 
Additional post-hoc analyses were performed on the TEAE by MMSE- 2 baseline strata, SIB 
by BSA-adjusted Dose, ADCS -ADL -Sev by BSA-adjusted Dose, TEAE by BSA-adjusted 
Dose, SIB by memantine use, ADCS -ADL -Sev by memantine use, the NPI 10- item total 
score by memantine use, and administration site-specific TEAE. The SIB and ADCS -ADL -
Sev scores also appeared to be affected by BSA -adjusted dose, as the lowe st tertile of 
bryostatin dose in general had a better response to treatment than higher tertiles or placebo (these data w ere also not analyzed statistically). Subjects treated with bryostatin who did not 
take memantine at baseline had significantly better improvement in SIB score compared to the placebo group in an MMRM analyses of SIB total score in both the CAS and FAS. Both the pooled bryostatin and 20μg bryostatin treatment groups had significantly better scores than the placebo treatment group at Weeks 5, 13, and at 30- day Follow -up. Similar results 
(which were not statistically analyzed) were seen in the ADCS -ADL -Sev test and in the NPI 
10-item score.  
 
2.1.2.5 Pharmacokinetics  
Mean plasma bryostatin concentrations increased approximately proportional to dose f or an  
increase in dose between 20μg and 40μg, infused IV over 45 minutes. The median Tmax occurred at the end of the 45-min infusion. 
Mean Cmax ranged from 0.563 ng/mL to 0.653 ng/mL after 20 μg and from 0.792 ng/mL to  
1.34 ng/mL after 40μg. Mean T1/2 rang ed from 1.33 h to 5.37 h.  Mean CL was similar for 
both dose levels and ranged from 24.97 L/h to 28.42 L/h for Weeks 0 and 3. The mean CL on 
Weeks 7 and 11 was slightly lower, ranging from 13.38 L/h to 23.91 L/h. 
Within a given dose level, the ranges of values for Cmax, AUClast, and AUCinf were 
consistent across weeks and there was no indication of systemic accumulation of bryostatin during administration of bryostatin once every 2 weeks. 
2.1.2.6 
Summary  
Bryostatin treatment was in general safe to use and well tolerated.  
The 20μg bryostatin treatment group had similar numbers of TEAEs to the placebo treatment 
group except in injection site reactions and diarrhea. The 40μg treatment group had more 
TEAEs an d SAEs than the 20μg or placebo treatment groups across many SOCs.  
The 40μg dose of bryostatin was associated with more TEAEs. With a decrease in systemic 
CL especially noted with 40µg bryostatin dosing, the higher drug exposure may further explain the increased number of TEAEs. The most common treatment related TEAEs were 
diarrhea, headache, fatigue, and myalgia, and all were reported in greater frequency with the 
40μg dose of bryostatin. Subjects given the 40μg dose of bryostatin also reported more TEAEs  of seizure and fall.

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 29 of 82 The primary efficacy endpoint for the SIB and secondary efficacy endpoint for the ADCS -
ADL -Sev was met in the CAS with the 20μg dose, which was statistically significantly 
different from placebo at Weeks 5 and 13. The 40μg dose was not statistically significant 
from the placebo.  SIB improvement was significant for the Week 5 FAS measurement (p< .056). No other 
primary or secondary endpoints were met in the FAS. Multiple exploratory analyses in the FAS for covariates in the primary and secondary 
endpoints revealed additional significant differences, but these occurred predominantly at the 
Week 5 time point.  
2.1.3 Study NTRP101 -201  
This was a randomized, double-blind, Placebo -controlled safety study of a single dose of 
bryostatin in subject s with mild to moderate AD (MMSE: 14 -26).  Subjects were randomized 
2:1 to receive bryostatin 25µg/m
2 or Placebo .  The primary objective was to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of bryostatin by the incidence of AEs  and SAEs .  Secondary safety 
endpoints included assessment of physical examination, hematology including complete 
blood count (CBC) and platelet count, coagulation parameters , serum chemistries , ECG, 
urinalysis and vital signs.  
The primary efficacy endpoint was a composite end point of change from baseline in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test- Revised  (HVLT -R) delayed recall and Repeatable Battery of 
Assessments for Neuropsychological Status ( RBANS) figure recall at 48  hours post study 
drug infusion. 
The study included single dose PK, and measurement of PKCε in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs) as a potential biomarker.   
2.1.3.1 Demographic s 
The study enrolled nine subjects, 4 male and 5 female,  with a mean age of 71.8 ±7.4 years 
(range 62 to 82).  The mean MMSE -2 at baseline was 22.5 for the three placebo  subjects 
(range 19-24) and 22 (range 16- 26) for the six bryostatin treated subject s. 
 2.1.3.2 Safety  
Bryostatin was well tolerated.  There were no deaths or SAEs  reported .  No subjects had an 
AE leading to withdrawal during the study.  There were five treatment emergent adverse 
events occurring in three subject s: headache, dizziness, and papular rash.  There were no 
reported episodes of myalgia, a known side effect of bryostatin.  The only adverse event in the bryostatin treated group was headache, which was not considered related to study drug.  All adverse events were mild and resolved without treatment.  All laboratory asse ssments, 
including hematology, chemistry, coagulation, renal function and liver function as well as cardiac assessments were unremarkable after treatment and there was no clinically significant change in any vital signs.

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 30 of 82 2.1.3.3 Efficac y  
There were no clinically significant differences between the mean or mean change from 
baseline between bryostatin and placebo in the HVLT- R or MMSE -2 assessments or any 
other efficacy assessment to suggest a treatment effect after a single dose of 25 μg/m2 
bryostatin. However, the possibility of an early effect on MMSE was identified even at small sample size and warrant ed further investigation in a more adequately powered trial. There 
was no difference in HVLT- R delayed recall or the RBANS delay ed figure recall at 48 hours.  
Additional time points of assessment for these measures (day 2, day 4 and day 15) did not indic ate any difference between groups.  Additional endpoints included the change from 
baseline in Digit Symbol Coding (DSC), and MMSE-2 at various time points.  There was no difference in mean values between groups for these endpoints at any time point.  Both the treatment and the Placebo  group showed an improvement in the MMSE-2 score most likely 
due to practice effects since the MMSE -2 was administered five time s in 2 weeks. 
In summary, there was no clinically significant difference between the mean or mean change from baseline between bryostatin and placebo in the HVLT- R or MMSE -2 assessments or 
any other efficacy assessments to suggest a treatment effect after  a single dose of 25μg/m

bryostatin. 
2.1.3.4 Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics of bryostatin were assessed in 6 subject s following 25 µ g/m2 
bryostatin administered as a single 1-hour IV infusion.  Individual bryostatin plasma 
concentrations were observed to increase and approac h stead y-state within the 1 hour 
infusion periods, and then rapidly decrease following the end of the infusion.  The bryostatin maximum plasma concentrations occurred at the end of the IV infusions, and had a mean (±standard deviation (SD)) value of 1.09 ±0.25 ng/mL.  A terminal elimination rate could not be calculated for most subject s due to sampling frequency , the rapid drug elimination, and 
the sensitivity limitations of the assay.  Based on the observed individual bryostatin plasma concentration profiles, the elimination t
1/2 associated with the observed drug exposure was 
estimated to be less than 30 minutes.  Total drug CL  was observed to be high (~ 40 L/h), 
consistent across the individual administered doses, and did not appear to be related to body weight, BSA, or sex.  The bryostatin pharmacokinetic parameters were observed to have low to modera te intersubject variability.  
2.1.3.5 Pharmacodynamics/ PKC ε 
Preliminary assessment of PKCε concentration in PBMCs suggests there is an incre ase in the 
total amount of PKCε (cytosol plus membrane bound concentration ) following treatment 
with bryostatin.  Additional analysis is underway to further characterize the increase and pharmacodynamics.  
2.1.3.6 Conclusions  
This wa s the first double-blind assessment of the safety of bryostatin treatment in subjects 
with Alzheimer’s disease.  The study met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability.  Bryostatin appears safe and we ll tolerated in this cohort of subjects with mild to moderate

improvement was detected in cognitive function on the effica cy measurements  though t he 
study was not powered to detect cognitive benefit.  There was no evidence of an adverse effect on cognition following treatment with bryostatin.   
 
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  AND HYPOTHESIS 
3.0 Primary Objective  
To evaluate the safety , tolerability and long- term effi cacy of bryostatin for the treatment of 
moderately severe Alzheimer’s disease in subjects not receiving concurrent memantine 
treatment , including 1) how long the therapeutic effects will last; and 2) whether a second 
treatment would be equally effective if  the therapeutic effects of the first treatment do not 
last. 
3.1 Hypothesis  
Patients treated with bryostatin will experience a greater improvement in cognitive function 
as measured by the SIB from baseline to the primary efficacy endpoint after two 12 week  
courses of treatment , as compared to patients on placebo during the same time period.  The 
null hypothesis will be rejected at a significance level of a two -sided α = 0.05. The test of the 
null hypothesis will be a superiority test based on the treatment difference in Week 28 SIB 
from baseline means as assessed by general estimat ing equations (GEE) regression, and only 
an improvement in the SIB score from baseline is of clinical significance.  
  
4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.0 Overview of  Study Design    
This is a randomized double-blind placebo -controlled exploratory study assessing bryostatin 
for the treatment of moderately severe Alzheimer’s disease in subjects not receiving memantine treatment.  The first treatment period of the study is 15 weeks in duration, including safety and efficacy evaluation 30 days after the last treatment. Eligible subjects will be stratified based on  SIB total scores at baseline and will be randomized 1 :1 to treatment 
with 20µg bryostatin or placebo for two 12- week  courses of treatment. The balance by 
treatment arms of b aselin e SIB total scores will be  monitored in real time .  Study drug is 
administered  IV by continuous infusion. The first two doses of study drug will be a loading 
dose 20% higher (i.e., 24µg) than the assigned dose and will be administered one week apart. There after, the assigned dose of 20µg will commence with the third dose and be administered 
every other week for 5 doses.  The second treatment period, beginning at Week 15, will be identical to the first.  Subjects are scheduled to receive seven doses over 12 weeks during the first treatment period  and seven doses over 12 weeks in the second period according to the 
original blinded, randomized treatment assignment.  Safety and efficacy assessments will be

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 32 of 82 done as indicated on the Schedule of Activities (Table 1).  The primary endpoint is the total 
SIB score assessment obtained at Week 28, after completion of two courses of trea tment.  
 
 
4.1 Dose Rationale 
The primary objective of treatment for cognitive disorders with bryostatin is activation of 
PKCε, not downregulation as was attempted for the oncology indications.  Bryostatin 
activation of PKCε is dose dependent, where lower doses activate PKCε and increase de-novo synthesis of the enzyme, while higher doses of bryostatin downregulate PKCε.   
The dosing regimen is based on the recently completed phase 2 study, NTRP101-202, in 
which the safety and efficacy analyses indicated a clear advantage of the 20µg dose over the 
40µg dose.   
The oncology data suggest that the dose-limiting side effect of myalgia is dose dependent and 
cumulative and likely related to the down regulation of PKC ε.  This was not seen in the 
NTRP101-201 study, in which there were no reports of myalgia after a single 25µg/m
2 dose 
of bryostatin was adm inistered , nor in the recently completed NTRP101-202 study, in which 
myalgia was considered an adverse event of special interest.  In NTRP101-202, in which subjects received 7 doses of study drug, myalgia was seen in 5 subjects; 4 of those subjects were given the higher 40µg dose of bryostatin. Myalgia observed was mostly mild and managed with analgesics.  
Dosing in this study will begin with two initial loading doses at one- week intervals that are 
20% higher than the maintenance dose (i.e., 24µg ) to assure enzyme activation. Dosing will 
then continue with  20μg administered every other week  for 5 weeks, for a total of 7 dos es.  
The first treatment period will occur over 15 weeks, including a follow-up visit 30 days after the last dose.  The same treatment regimen will be administered for subjects  who qualify for 
a second course of treatment. The total study drug administered  to a particular subject is 14 
doses. 
4.2 Risk/Benefit  
Bryostatin treatment in study NTRP101-202 was shown to be general ly safe and well 
tolerated.   The 20μg bryostatin treatment group had similar numbers of TEAEs to the placebo 
treatment group except in injection site reactions and diarrhea. Post hoc  analysis in 
NTRP101-202 clearly showed that bryostatin- treated s ubjects who did not take memantine at 
baseline had significantly better improvement in SIB score compared to the placebo group in 
an MMRM analyses of SIB total score in both the CAS and FAS. Both the pooled bryostatin 
(20μg and 40μg)  and 20μg bryostatin treatment groups had significantly bett er scores than 
the placebo treatment group at Weeks 5, 13, and at 30-day Follow-up. There were no 
statistical differences in SIB score between treatment groups in subjects given memantine at baseline.    
Therapeutic antibodies targeting β -amyloid have been associated with the occurrence of 
amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA), which is similar in appearance to cerebral 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-204
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 33 of 82 vasogenic edema and microhemorrhage.  A minority of cases have been associated with 
symptoms of headache, visual disturbance, loss of coordination, or disorientation.  Asymptomatic ARIA was reported in a clinical study of the small molecule gamma -secretase 
inhibitor BMS-708163.  Bryostatin has a different mechanism of action than antibodies directed at amyloid, but in the transgenic mouse model of AD treated with bryostatin a decrease of Aβ deposition was observed.  Given the limited bryostatin experience in AD, the potential for ARIA and associated clinical events cannot be excluded.   In NTRP101-202, 
however, there was no clinical evidence suggestive of vasogenic edema or microhemorrhage that require d an MRI scan.  
Subjects in this study, with moderately severe to severe dementia, are those who have had a progressive dementia to the degree that their activities of daily living and their a bility to care 
for themselves may be compromised.  Subjects with MMSE-2 scores of 15 or less display significant cognitive impairments that are disabling.  Most if not all of these subjects will have progressed despite treatment and have no alternative treatments available.  Based on the available nonclinical and clinical data, and the low risk of ARIA, the potential benefits of treatment with bryostatin at the proposed dose in this protocol outweigh the risks.

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 39 of 82 5.3 Storage and Preparation of S tudy Drug  
The study drug kits will be stored under refrigeration  conditions (2 -8°C) in a refrigerator, 
refrigerated cabinet or other refrigerated enclosure, which is securely locked  and temperature 
continuously monitored.  Access to th e stored study drug kits will be restricted to the 
investigational site pharmacy or designated staff member .   
Study drug will be prepared and dispensed for administration by a qualified member of the 
study staff (e.g., pharmacist, pharmacist -designee, nurse or physician trained in aseptic 
handling techniques).  Th is individual will be responsible for reconstitution, dilution and 
preparation of study drug (active and placebo ) according to the randomization assignment for 
each subject.  The investigational drug is to be administered only according to the conditions of this protocol.   
Study drug will be administered by the study PI  or his/her designees. Study drug should be 
allowed to come to room temperature prior to administration.  The study drug contains no 
antibacterial preservatives and must be used within eight hours of reconstitution. Study drug  
should be reconstituted with 1mL of PET diluent. Af ter swirling the 10 mL vial to 
completely dissolve the contents, the resulting solution mus t be diluted immediately with 
9mL of 0.9% sodium chloride (NS) injection, USP.  The  necessary volume of this solution to 
achieve the assigned dose ( a 9.6 mL loading dose for the first two doses and an 8.0mL 
maintenance dose for the remaining 5 doses) should then be added to a n IV infusion bag 
containing 50 mL of normal saline.  Once the infusion bag is filled with the assigned dose, the 45±5 minute continuous infusion must be completed within 3 hours of the IV infusion bag fill. 
The infusion system ( IV infusion bag and tubing) should be made of a polyolefin plastic, 
such as polypropylene or polyethylene, or a combination of both. The use of 
polyvinylchloride (PVC) plastic bags and tubing is NOT to be used as plasticizer  from the 
PVC  is leached and there is absorption of bryostatin to PVC plastics.   
The prepared infusion bag containing study drug should be labeled with the following information: 
Protocol number 
Kit/Subject  number 
Date and time prepared  
Instructions for dosing ( e.g., entire contents of IV infusion bag infused within 45 
±5 min utes 
 
5.4 Study Drug Accountability and Disposal  
Neither the Investigational Pharmacy , designated  drug preparer , the PI  nor any of his/her 
designees may provide drug to any person not enrolled in this study.  Adequate records of 
study drug receipt and use must be maintained in order to comply with governmental regulations and with the protocol in addition to preventing unauthorized distribution. 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-204
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 40 of 82 Study drug orders, records of receipts, dispensing records, and inventory forms will be 
examined  and reconciled throughout the study.  All study drug that is used during the course 
of the study must be accounted for on a drug accountability form. 
Unless otherwise directed, at the end of the study all unused study medication must be 
destroyed onsite following t he site’s specific SOPs after drug accountability has been verified 
by the monitor.  If destruction on site is not possible, study medication should be retained and 
returned to Singota Solutions at the end of the study. A copy of all completed drug 
accountability forms will be collected by the monitor or appropriate designee upon 
completion of the study.  
Note : The medications should not be disposed of prior to monitoring and approval. 
5.5 Randomization 
Once all eligibility criteria for the study have  been met,  and the site has received approval by 
the Medical Monitor (MM) and Clinical Assessment Technologies (CAT) group, via the 
EDC system,  the subject  can be randomized via Interactive Response Technology ( IRT) 
system .  Randomization will be stratified by SIB total score at baseline and baseline SIB 
scores will be balanced at baseline between the treatment groups.  Mean values of baseline SIB total scores by group will be monitored in real time during the enrollment proce ss. A 
randomization number will be assigned, and drug for that randomization number will be shipped to the site for twelve weeks of treatment.  Randomization and scheduling of the first study drug infusion should be timed to allow for receipt of study drug prior to the scheduled study treatment.  The drug kits will be shipped to the individual who will be responsible for kit storage and drug preparation and may not be handled by any other study staff member.  The study drug kit will not identify the vial co ntaining study drug as either placebo or 
bryostatin.  After completion of Week 13, a second study drug kit will be provided for treatment period two.  The  IRT system will be used to register subjects for treatment and 
trigger study drug shipments. 
 
     5.6  Blinding  
 
All subjects, PI s, and investigational clinical site personnel will be blinded to dose 
assignment.  Since there is no known antidote to bryostatin, the blind should only be broken 
in exceptional circumstances  and is at the discretion of the PI .  The Medical Monitor should 
be contacted as soon as possible to discuss the situation, but this should not delay any treatment.  
In a non-emergency situation, when unblinding is requested, the site  should discuss the 
clinical  circumstances with the Medical Monitor  to determine if breaking the blind will alter 
the subject’s  treatment.  The decision to break the blind is ultimately the decision of the PI .   
If the blind is broken for a subject, the PI  will record the date and reason for breaking the 
blind in the electronic case report form ( eCRF ) and study drug treatment will be

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 41 of 82 discontinued.  However, the subject will continue to be monitored per protocol for safety and 
efficacy.  
5.7 Study Drug Administr ation  
Study drug is scheduled to be administered by continuous intravenous infusion only, via a pump, at the same rate over  45 minutes  (±5 min) once a week for 2 weeks and then every 14 
days ±2 days thereafter . The same treatment schedule will be followed  for treatment period 
two.  The entire volume of study drug in the infusion bag is to be administer ed. Infusion 
times should not be extended or shortened.  If a subject misses a dose, the dose should be administered as soon as possible.  The subject should then continue on the original dosing schedule.   Provided all efficacy assessments have been completed, if deemed necessary by 
the PI, a short acting sedative may be administered to reduce a subject’s anxiety or agitation during the infusion. All medication is to be recorded on the Concomitant Medication eCRF. 
6 STUDY PROCEDURES AND ASSESSMENTS   
Subjects will be randomized to study drug, either bryostatin or placebo  treatment.  A f ollow-
up visit will take place 30 days after the last dose of study drug for all subject s, including 
subject s that have discontinued treatment before completion of the study. Assessments will 
be performed according to the Schedule of Activities. ( Table 1).

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 43 of 82 6.0 Assessments 
Every effort should be made to ensure that protocol-required tests and procedures are completed 
as described.  However, it is anticipated that from time to time there may be circumstanc es 
outside the control of the PI  that may ma ke it unfeasible to perform a test.  In these cases, the PI  
must take all steps necessary to ensure the safety and well -being of the subject.  When a protocol 
required test cannot be performed, the PI  will document the reason for the missed test and any 
corrective and preventative actions which were taken to ensure that the required processes are adher ed to as soon as possible.  The study team must be informed of these incidents in a timely 
manner.  
6.0.1 Safety  
Overall safety and tolerability will be assessed by the incidence of treatment emergent AE s and 
SAEs and  by evaluations of change from baseline in physical examination, vital signs, 12- lead 
ECG , the C- SSRS, clinical chemistry, hematology , and coagulation lab tests.  
6.0.1.1 Laboratory 
Blood samples will be obtained for routine laboratory tests, including hematology, chemistry, coagulation and βhCG if indicated as outlined in the Schedule of Activities ( Table 2 ).   
Hematology tests will include CBC with differential, platelet  count and coagulation 
(prothrombin time ( PT) and partial prothrombin Time ( PTT) ) studies. 
 
Clinical chemistry tests will include sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, estimated creatinine CL, glucose, calcium, CO2, total protein,  
albumin, ALP, ALT, AST,  gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT)  lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), 
uric acid and bilirubin.  A serum creatine phosphokinase ( CPK ) will be done at screening and in 
the event of myalgia. A TSH will be done at screening, and T-3 and T-4 will be done if TSH result is abnormal.  
 Samples will be sent to a central lab for testing .  Refer to the Laboratory Manual for detailed 
instructions.   
6.0.1.2 Physical Examination 
All physical examinations must be performed by the PI or qualified designee (physician, 
physician’s assistant, or nurse practitioner).  The complete physical examination conducted during the screening period and at designated subsequent time points should include, but is not limited to the following:   
• General appearance  
• Weight 
• Height (screening only)

• Respiratory system 
• Cardiovascular system  
• Abdomen 
Examination of other systems as needed to explore reports of AEs should be conducted as 
needed by the PI.  Any cli nically significant physical findings that were not present on the initial 
physical examination will be considered AEs and documented on the AE eCRF as well as in the 
subject’s source documentation and on the physical examination eCRFs.   
6.0.1.3 Vital Sign  Measurements  
Single supine blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured at Screening and at other visits as 
specified in the Schedule of A ctivities .  
6.0.1.4 Electrocardiogram  
An average of triplicate 12 -lead ECGs will be collected at screening.  The triplicate ECG 
measurements sho uld be obtained approximately 2-4 minutes apart.  Single 12- lead ECGs will be 
collected at time points  specified in the Schedule of Activities.  
6.0.1.5 Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C- SSRS is an interview -based rating scale to systematically assess suicidal ideation and 
suicidal behavior.  The scale should be administered by an individual with appropriate clinical training, who has also taken the specific rater training for the scale, which will be provided by an agent of the Sponsor prior to the study start.  If at any visit from baseline on, there are “YES” answers on items 4, 5 or on any behavioral question of the C-SSRS, a risk assessment should be

CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 45 of 82 done by a qualified clinician to determine whether it is  safe for the subject to continue to 
participate in the study.  A suicidality narrative should be constructed for subjects who have 
undergone any post-baseline risk assessment, using information from the C- SSRS, an d available 
information from the NPI, prior screening and baseline information, the clinician assessment and the narrative guide.  Subjects who answer “YES” on items 4, 5 or on any behavioral question of the C -SSRS on more than one occasion during a study should be discontinued from the study.  
Suicidality AEs  or other clinical observations may, based on the judgment of the PI , also trigger 
a risk assessment and a narrative.  When there is a positive response to any question on the C-SSRS, the PI should determine whether an AE  has occurred.  
6.0.2 Efficac y / Psychometric Assessments 
All raters for the efficacy assessments need to be trained and qualified on the administration of the scales.  A qualified  rater is required for the administration of  the SIB , NPI and MMSE-2.  
The same qualified rater should perform a given Efficacy/Psychometric Assessment at approximately the same time of day for a given subject throughout the study.  All changes in raters for a given assessments must be noted in the subject’s source documents.  The caregiver designated to provide assessments ( ADCS -ADL -Sev and NPI) at the start of the study should be 
the same individual throughout the study.  Should a change be necessary during the course of the study, the reason for the change and the first corresponding visit must be noted in the subject’s source document. 
All psychometric tests performed on study subjects on the same day should be administered in 
the following order: SIB followed by MMSE-2, except at the screening visit as described in Section 6.2.1. If the MMSE -2 score obtained at screening does not fall within the 10-18 range for 
inclusion, no further screening tests should be performed.  Efficacy  tests at subsequent visits 
should be administered prior to dosing. 
6.0.2.1 Rosen -Modified Hachinski Scale  
The Rosen -Modifie d Hachinski Scale will be evaluated at screening to differentiate Alzheimer’s 
type dementia from multi- infarct dementia.  The 8 -item scale results in a score of 0 -12; and a 
score of 5 or above is exclusionary for the study. 
6.0.2.2 Severe Impairment Battery  
The SIB is used to assess cognition in subjects with moderate and severe AD.   It is divided into 
nine subscales that include attention, language, orientation, memory, praxis, visuospatial ability, 
construction, social skills, orienting head to name.  Non -verbal responses are allowed, thus 
decreasing the need for language output.  Forty  questions are included with a point score range 
of 0-100. Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.   
6.0.2.3 Mini Mental State Examination, 2
nd Edition  
The Standard version of the MMSE-2, with two alternate forms,  will be used.  This version has 
the structure and scoring of the original 30- item MMSE -2 and scores are comparable.  The 
MMSE -2 is a brief, widely used test for assessing overall cognitive state.  The MMSE -2

praxis on a scale of 0-30.  Lower scores indicate greater cognitive impairment.  
6.0.2.4 Alzheimer’s D isease  Cooperative Study Activities of Daily Living Inventory – 
Severe Impairment Version  
The ADCS -ADL -Sev is a 19 -item functional assessment of the performance of activities of daily 
living for subjects with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease.  Informants are queried via a 
structured interview format as to whether subjects attempted each item in the inventory during 
the previous 4 weeks, as well as their level of performance.  Each item is rated from the highest level of independent performance to complete loss.  Total score ranges from 0 -54 with lower 
scores indicating greater functional impairment.   The ADCS -ADL -Sev may be administered via 
telephone at the discretion of the PI , within the allowed time window for the scheduled visit. 
6.0.2.5 Neuropsychiatric Invent ory  
The NPI is a caregiver interview -based rating scale assessing 10 behavioral disturbances 
occurring in dementia subject s.  The NPI may be administered via telephone at the discretion of 
the investigator, within the allowed time window for the scheduled visit.  Items are scored for both frequency and severity.  Total scores range from 0 -120 with higher scores indicating greater 
behavioral disturbances.  For each item, the associated caregiver distress is also assessed.  
6.1 Visit Procedures  
6.1.1 Screening and Randomization (Days -28 to -2) 
In order to avoid unnecessary screen failures, a prescreening telephone call to rule out clearly exclusionary conditions is advised prior to scheduling a screening visit.  In addition, a P re-
Screening Consent form will be provided, allowing access to medical records prior to a subject’s  
onsite screening visit.  Use of this consent will reduce the occurrence of onsite screening vi sits 
by subjects ineligible for the study based on medical history.  No study procedures will be performed under this preliminary consent.  Informed Consent must be obtained before any study related procedures are performed. Screening procedures and random ization will take place within 
an approximate 4-week period prior to first dose administration (Days -28 to -2).   
Subjects who are screen -failed (e.g. due to clinically significant laboratory abnormality or an 
active medical condition) may be re -screened if their medical condition stabilizes or improves as 
assessed by the PI.  Subject who are screen -failed due to MMSE  score may be rescreened in 3 
months.  The Medical Monitor should be consulted prior to re-screening. Subjects who are Screen Failures  
may be rescreened only once.  
The following procedures should be performed first at screening  only to avoid unnecessary 
procedures for ineligible subject s:  
• Collect ion of subject demographic data 
• Review of concomitant medications   
• Review of m edical history

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 47 of 82 • Assessment of neuroimaging (CT or MRI  performed within 2 years of screening) 
• Evaluate Rosen -Modified Hachinski Scale  
• Evaluate MMSE -2  
After confirming that these parameters satisfy eligibility criteria, the remaining 
screening procedures should be performed;  
• SIB. The SIB should be done within 3 weeks before the first study drug dose. If 
the screening period exceeds 3 weeks, the SIB should be repeated on the day of 
the first dose, prior to dosing. The repeat SIB score obtained closest to the day of 
dosing should be recorded in the eCRF as an unscheduled visit. 
• NPI 
• ADSC -ADL -SIV 
• Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( C-SSRS)  
• Blood samples for routine safety including hematology, PT, PTT, INR and serum -chemistry, CPK, TSH  (T-3 and T-4 if indicated), and β -hCG, if indicated  
• 12-lead ECG (x3)  
• Complete physical examination  
• Vital signs  
• Adverse event s and concomitant medications  
If changes in the subject’s health or mental status occur during the screening and 
randomization period, including changes in medication affecting the mental status, the 
Medical Monitor should be notified. The Medical Monitor will advise the PI regarding any assessments that should be repeated to ensure eligibility requirements are met. 
Sites will not be able to randomize subjects before confirmation that eligibility criteria 
have been m et per the review of the Rosen -Modified Hachinski Scale, MMSE -2, 
CSSRS, and other eligibility criteria by the Worldwide Clinical Trials’ Clinical Assessment Technologies (CAT) group and Medical Monitor (MM). 
 
6.1.2 Week 0 ( Day 0 Dose 1) 
If the subject has had no intervening medical issues or changes in medi cations between 
the date of randomization  and Week  0, dosing may proceed as scheduled.  
A final a ssessment of the inclusion/exclusion criteria , including any changes in medications or 
health status will be done before dosing to confirm the subject ’s eligibility .   
 The following procedures will be done on Day 0: 
• Dosing by IV infusion will be done according to the procedures outlined in Section 5.7.

CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 54 of 82 • Follow-up Visits: Despite discontinuation of the study drug dosing, subjects and caregivers 
should be encouraged to return for additional follow-up visits for the duration of the trial, in order to monitor for safety and any changes in cognition.  
 
o The follow-up visits should be scheduled to coincide with the cognitive assessment visits scheduled after the study drug discontinuation (i.e., weeks 5, 9, 13, 15, 20, 24, 28, 30).
 
o The below assessments should be completed at all follow-up visits:  
 SIB 
 Vitals  
 Adverse Events  
 Concomitant medications  
o If the subject is willing to return for only one follow-up visit, please schedule this visit to occur approximately 30 days (+/-2 days) following the last study drug dosing. 
 
 
6.2 Concomitant Medications  
During the screening visit, the Caregiver will provide a history of prior medication use during the 
past 6 months and provide a list of currently used medications.  All concomitant medications used should be recorded on the eCRF  and in the source documents using the generic name for 
the drug.  A ssessment of concomitant medications will take place at each study visit.  Any 
changes to chronic medications should be noted as well as new and discontinued medications.   
Subject s taking allowed antidepressant medications may be enrolled in the study (see Appendix 
1).  The dose and dose regimen for these medications should be stabilized for at least 30 days prior to enrollment in the study.  Every effort should be made to keep the dose and dose regimen of antidepressant medications stable throughout the study. 
6.2.1 Medications for AD  
Subject s taking FDA approved medications for the treatment of AD , with the exception of 
memantine or any drug containing memantine , may be enrolled in the study.  The subject  
must be on a stable dose of permitted medications for at least 3 months prior to entry into the 
study and dose must not change during the study.  Subject s may not initiate additional drugs for 
treatment of AD during  the study other than the study drug.  
6.2.2 Concomitant Medications for Management of Myalgia 
Non-steroidal anti -inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen sodium are permitted .  
Use of acetaminophen  as an analgesic is contraindicated as it has the ability to inhibit PKC 
activation.  
6.2.3 Prohibited  Medications   
Memantine is prohibited.  Subjects previously treated with memantine must stop treatment at 
least 90 days prior to initiation of study drug treatment.  Treatment with other NMDA receptor antagonists such as but not limited to dextromethorphan (a cough suppressant), ketamine,

opioids: penthidine, levorphanol, methadone, dextropropoxyphene, tramadol, and ketobemidone 
is prohibited and a 30-day washout period is required prior to initiation of study drug treatment.   
High dose Vitamin E (> 400 IU / day) , Valproic Acid and divalproex sodium are prohibited. 
Gabapentin is prohibited.  
If the PI  determines that initiation of any of the prohibited medications is required to ensure the 
subject ’s safety, the medication may be initiated with the notification of the  Medical Monitor 
and proper documentation of a protocol deviation .  Other restricted concomitant medications are 
listed in Appendix 1. 
 
7 ADVERSE EVENTS AND OTHER SAFETY EVALUATIONS  
7.0 Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related.  An AE (also referred to as an adverse experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about causality.   
The PI is responsible for obtaining information about all medical emergencies during the clinical 
study. The PI’s contact information will be located in the body of the informed consent form (ICF) and subjects/caregivers will be encouraged to contact the PI or clinical site personnel 
during any clinical study- related emergency.  
All adverse events spontaneously reported by the subject  and/or caregiver in response to an open 
question or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study regardless of relationship to the study drug.  All AEs will be monitored and recorded for the progress of the event until it resolves or reaches a clinically stable outcom e.  Adverse events that are not resolved at the time 
of database lock will be recorded as ongoing.  
The AE and SAE reporting period starts from the time of consent to the last study visit.   
7.1 Adverse E vent of Special Interest - Myalgia  
Myalgia has been reported as the dose limiting toxicity across the oncology studies.  The 
incidence of myalgia appears to be dose dependent and cumulative.   However , it has been 
reported in subject s receiving doses as low as 5μg/m
2.  The myalgia has been investigated in 
some studies but not all.  No increase in muscle enzymes were found in the cases investigated.  
EMG was abnormal in one subject who received 65µg/m2 and suggested a patchy myositis. An 
MRI done in another subject was normal.  
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-204
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 56 of 82 For all cases o f myalgia despite the severity , a narrative will be created documenting onset, 
severity, treatment and outcome.  Muscle enzymes , CPK, will be collected for all cases and 
compared to baseline values.  Additional investigations are at the discretion of the investigator.  
7.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that fulfills any of the following criteria: 
• Results in death (fatal)  
• Is life threatening (an event is con sidered “life threatening” if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence placed the subject  at immediate risk of 
death.   It does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might 
have caused death).  
• Requires in -patient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
• Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
or 
• Is an important medical event (events that may not result in death, be immediately life 
threatening or require hospitalization; may be considered serious when based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they jeopardize the subject  and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed above.  Examples include; 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, convulsions that do not result in hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.   
The following situations may not, by themselves, constitute sufficient grounds to be considered 
as an SAE:   
• Hospitalization solely for a diagnostic purpose, even if related to an AE,  
• Elective hospitalization for an intervention planned before the subject enrollment in 
the study  
• Admission to a day care facility or sleeping laboratory 
7.3 Assessment of Intensity  
Severity is a clinical determination of the intensity of an AE and will be determined by the PI  
based on the following classification criteria for all AEs occurring during the clinical study: 
Mild - Awareness of signs or symptom, but easily tolerated, may require additional therapy Moderate - Discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity and to require 
intervention or additional therapies 
Severe - Incapacitating with inability to work or perform usual activity  
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-204
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 57 of 82 Note : It should be noted that a severe AE need not be serious in nature and that an SAE is not, by 
definition, severe.  Regardless of intensity, all SAEs and significant events must be reported. 
7.4 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causal relationship between the investigational drug and each AE will be determined by the 
PI based on his/her medical judgment in consideration of all relevant factors, including pattern of 
reaction, temporal relationship, positive, concomitant medication, co-existing diseases, and relevant medical history.   The PI will classify every AE according to its relationship to study 
drug or trial -related procedures.  The categories according to World Health Organization 
guidelines are listed in the following Table 
 7.5 Table 2 Relationship of AE to Study Drug or Trial- Related Procedures  
Rating  Classification  Definition  
1 Probable An AE that:  
• Occurs at a reasonable time interval after administration 
of the study drug;  
• Follows a known response pattern to the study drug and; 
• Cannot be reasonably explained by the known 
characteristics of the subject ’s clinical state or by other 
therapies.  
2 Possible An AE that:  
• Occurs at a reasonable time interval after administration 
of the study drug;  
• Follows a known response pattern to the study drug, but;  
• Could have been produced by the subject ’s clinical state 
or by other therapies. 
•  
3 Unlikely* • An AE for which sufficient information exists to indicate 
that the etiology is unrelated to the study drug; 
• Another etiology is specified.  
*If the AE is classified as unlikely, the PI should provide a likely cause, other illness, 
concomitant medication, or other.  
7.5.1 Unexpected Adverse Event  
An AE is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure ( IB) or is not 
listed at the specificity or se verity that has been observed.  Unexpected refers to AEs that are 
mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-204
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 58 of 82 under investigation.  However, an event that is more specific or more severe than described in 
the IB will be considered unexpected. 
7.6 Reporting Adverse Events  
The PI  should instruct all subjects/caregivers on the procedure for reporting AEs/ SAEs to the 
appropriate clinical site personnel.  For each AE reported by parents/guardians, clinical site 
personnel should obtain all required information to complete the eCRF.  
The PI or designee should document all AEs/ SAEs in subject s’ source documentation and on the 
AE eCRF.  
In addition to standardized reporting procedures, worsening or exacerbation of concurrent 
conditions in subject s will also be reported as AEs, and will follow the designated reporting 
format.  
The following should be recorded with each SAE/AE: 
• The nature of the AE, with a diagnosis wherever possible 
• Date of event  
• Assessment of intensity  
• Is this an SAE? 
• Relationship to study drug or trial -related procedures  
• Action taken regarding study drug treatment 
• Outcome 
If the intensity of an already reported AE increases, then a new AE eCRF must be completed for that AE. The date of change would be included as the end date for the originally reported AE, and the start date for the new AE of greater intensity.  
The clinic al research associate is responsible for source document verification of all safety 
events.  
If the clinical site becomes aware of an SAE, regardless of causality, within 30 days following 
the last administration of investigational product, the SAE should be recorded and reported immediately to the Sponsor.  An SAE that occurs more than 30 days after the last dose will NOT be collected unless the PI considers that the event is related to the investigational product. 
The sponsor should be informed if the PI becomes aware of any unusual safety information or 
any potential drug- related safety information, even after a subject completes the study  
7.6.1 SAE reports  
All SAEs, whether or not considered associated  with study treatment or study- related procedures, 
must be reported on the eCRF immediately and no later than 24 hours after the site becomes aware of the event .  Follow-up information must be provided promptly as requested.   
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-204
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 59 of 82 The PI is obligated to provide as much information about the event as possible on the eCR F 
provided and as requested by the Sponsor or Medical Monitor.  
In general, this will include a description of the SAE in sufficient detail to allow for a complete 
medical assessment of the case.   The pharmacovigilance physician or designee will review the  
SAE including the SAE  criteria, the relationship to study medication, the expected or unexpected 
assessment, and inform the Sponsor by phone and e- mail immediately.  
The following AEs should also be reported to the Sponsor’s designated Medical Monitor 
immediately:  
• severe injection/infusion site reactions (ulceration or necrosis that is severe; operative 
intervention indicated) 
• systemic hypersensitivity reactions  
• myalgia  
All additional follow -up evaluations must be reported by the site to the medical monitor, or 
designee, immediately after notification of the additional information.   
An SAE will be followed until it resolves or reaches a clinically stable outcome.  AEs/SAEs that 
have not resolved by study closure will be considered ongoing. 
An SAE that occurs after the 30- day safety visit will NOT be collected  unless the PI determines 
that the event is related to the investigational drug product. 
7.6.2 Reporting to Regulatory Authorities 
The PI , or designee, is responsible for informing the Institutional Review Board ( IRB) of any 
unexpected SAEs, as well as any additional SAEs according to the IRB’s policy . 
Any SAE that is serious, suspected to be related to investigational study drug and unexpected 
(SUSAR) , will be promptly reported to regulatory authorities by the Sponsor according to 
expedited reporting requirements.  Subsequent relevant information after the initial submission 
of the (IND) Safety Report to the regulatory authorities will be submitted  in a follow -up IND 
Safety Report  to the regulatory authorities in the expedited period by the Sponsor. 
7.7 Criteria for Withdrawal of Subject s 
Subjects may be w ithdrawn from the clinical study  for the following reasons: 
• The PI  believes withdrawal to be medically necessary or in the best interest of the 
subject  
• Noncompliance with the protocol as judged by the PI  (requires discussion with the 
Sponsor)  
• Subjects who are enrolled in violation of inclusion and/or exclusion criteria   
• An AE that presents an  unacceptable consequence or risk to the subject  as judged by 
the PI , Sponsor or the Medical Monitor 
• Lost to follow up 
• Withdrawal of consent

CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 60 of 82 • Subject is unblinded 
 
Subjects may voluntarily discontinue their participation in the study at any time without 
prejudice to further treatment.   
7.8 Criteria for Permanent Discontinuation of Study Drug  
Study drug treatment may be discontinued for the following reasons: 
• if sponsor or regulatory authorities discontinue study 
• if the PI  believes that discontinuing treatment is  in the best interest of the subject 
7.9 Study Discontinuation 
Synaptogenix has the right to discontinue this clinical study at any time. The  PI has the right to 
discontinue participation in this clinical study at any time for any reason.  Clinical study site 
discontinuation should only occur after mutual consultation between the PI and Synaptogenix. 
Should the clinical study be discontinued prematurely, all subject s should be brought in for early 
termination procedures as outlined for the 30-day Follow -up visit.   All clinical study  materials 
should be returned to Synaptogenix or designee.   
8 SAFETY MONITORING  
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will provide consultation to Synaptogenix to assess 
the implementation and progress of study NTRP101 -204 and will review accumulating trial data 
to monitor the safety of bryostatin administered to patients with AD.  Safety data will be 
reviewed when 30 subjects have received four doses of study drug, followed by additional safety analyses when 60 subjects have received a similar number of doses. Medical decisions relevant to this study will be made by the Sponsor in consultation with the Primary Investigator, Medical Monitor and S tatistician . 
Prior to each safety review, a cut -off date for the data to be provided will be established by the 
Sponsor in consultation with the WCT Supporting Biostatistician.  The format and content of data listings will be approved by the Supporting Biostatistician.  Data reports will be provided as partially blinded displays (e.g., data is grouped by unblinded treatment using "Group A, B” to indicate treatment).  The identity of each group will be available to the safety reviewer via the Supporting Statistician. 
Data review documents, safety data tables and listings, will be provided to the DSMB at least 7 
business days prior to scheduled reviews. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) reported during the 7 days before the scheduled review and therefore not included in the provided documentation will be provided by the WCT Drug Sa fety Manager  as soon as possible before the review date. The

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 61 of 82 9 DATA ANALYSIS / STATISTICAL METHODS  
Detailed methodology for summa ry and statistical analyses of the data collected in this study will 
be documented in a Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  This separate document will be finalized 
prior to study unblinding and conduct of any statistical analyses.  The SAP may modify and wi ll 
take precedence over the plans outlined in the protocol; however, any major modifications or modification of the primary endpoint definition and/or its analysis will also be reflected in a protocol amendment. 
The primary efficacy outcome will be  the dif ference in SIB total score from baseline at Week 28 
between treatment arms , after two12-week courses of the study drug have been given.   
9.0 Sample Size Determination   
The power analysis for the current study is based on a minimum clinically significant difference 
in mean total SIB scores from baseline of 4 points between the placebo and bryostatin arms at Week 28. Since the analysis of this primary outcome is based on a linear regression model that utilizes the total SIB scores at Weeks 0, 5,  9, 13, 15, 20, 24, and 28, a difference of 
approximately 1.5 points per week in the slope of total SIB scores between the placebo and bryostatin arms yields the clinically meaningful difference of 4 points at Week 28. As these measures of total SIB scores  are correlated within individual, methods of GEE will be used to 
estimate the regression parameters of the linear regression model of total SIB score regressed on time. GEE power analysis is based on the following equation: 
    𝑚𝑚=  2�𝑧𝑧𝑎𝑎/2+𝑧𝑧𝑏𝑏�2𝜎𝜎2(1−𝜌𝜌 )
𝑛𝑛𝑠𝑠𝑥𝑥2𝑑𝑑2              Eq 1 
In equation 1, m  is the number of patients per group, 𝑧𝑧 𝑎𝑎/2is the type I error rate, 𝑧𝑧𝑏𝑏is the type II 
error rate, σ is the standard deviations of the error (residual) terms, ρ  is the within person 
correlation of total SIB scores over time within a person, n is the time points where the total SIB 
score is obtained, 𝑠𝑠𝑥𝑥2is the variance of the X  predictor variable (i.e. time in the current scenario), 
and d is the difference in slopes over time in total SIB measures from baseline between the 
placebo and bryostatin arms.17 
Based on the data from the NTRP101-202 study among patients without memantine, we obtained 
an estimate for σ  = 5.3. In addition, the NTRP101 -204 study will have S IB total scores measured  
at n = 8 timepoints, giving a value of  𝑠𝑠𝑥𝑥2 = 127. A ssuming a total of 100 patients (50 patients per 
arm), a  two-sided type I error rate of 0.05 (i.e. 𝑧𝑧𝑎𝑎/2 = 1.96), and moderate within person correlation 
of outcome measures (i. e. ρ = 0.5), we will have > 99% power to see a difference in slopes over 
time of d = 0. 15 points per week . In addition, we will have > 99% power to see this difference if  
we experience a 20% drop out. 
9.1 Statistical Methods  
The Safety Analysis Set (SA S) is de fined as all randomized subjects who received any study 
medication (either partial or completed infusions of bryostatin or placebo ).  
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-204
  
CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 62 of 82 The Full Analysis Set (FAS), consistent with the  modified  intention -to-treat ( mITT) principles, is 
defined as all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication and who 
have at least one post- baseline efficacy assessment.  
 
The Per Protocol Analysis Set (PP) is defined as all patients completing the study without major 
protocol deviations. To be included, subjects must have received at least 11 of the14 doses (80%).  
 The C ompleter Analysis S et (CAS) is  defined as all randomized subjects who completed two 
courses  of treatment, and who have a week 28 SIB assessment.   
Demographics data collected will include age, sex, race, ethnicity, height, and body weight and will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics for both the SA S and FAS 
populations. 
Medical history, neuroimaging, prior and concomitant medications, existing disease, years since 
AD onset and diagnosis, baseline medical conditions, and baseline safety and neuropsychological assessments will be summarized descriptively by treatment group for both the SA S and FAS populations. 
Subject disposition will be summarized by treatment group and will include numbers screened, randomized, dosed and withdrawn with reason for withdrawal.  
9.2 Exploratory Analysis 
Descriptive statistics by visit and randomized treatment group will be provided for all efficacy  
data. These descriptive statistics will include the mean, median, SD, maximum and minimum for 
continuous variables, and frequencies, percentage, and tabulations for categorical variables. Summary statistics will also be performed on both the patient demographics and patient clinical characteristics. Exploratory plots of the data will also be created, including box plots and histograms, in order to determine the distribution of these data as well as to identify any unusual or outlying observations.   
 9.3 Safet y Analysis 
The SAS population will be used for all safety analyses with treatment group determined by the 
treatment actually received.  AEs, safety laboratory, ECGs, physical exam and vital signs data will be presented in tabular format and summarized descriptively by treatment group.  No formal hypothesis testing will be carried out on these safety assessments.  Incidence and severity of AEs will be summarized by treatment dose using System Organ Class (SOC).  AEs will be coded according to standard MedDRA terms.  
C-SSRS responses will be mapped onto the Columbia- Classification Algorithm of Suicide 
Assessment (C -CASA) scale, and the frequency distribution of the C- CASA scores will be 
tabulated by treatment group and study visit.  No hypotheses associated with the C- SSRS or C -
CASA scales will be tested.

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 63 of 82 9.4 Analysis of Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The treatment difference in the primary efficacy endpoint of total SIB scores from baseline at 
Week 28 will be determined from a regression model that utilize SIB values t aken at Weeks 0, 5, 
9, 13, 15, 20, 24, 28 and 30. As SIB is a continuous outcome measure, a regression model will be used to estimate the treatment difference in mean SIB from baseline at Week 28. Both linear and non-linear terms will be considered in these regression models. Since correlation of SIB 
measures over time within a patient will be present,  regression coefficients will be estimated 
using the generalized estimating equations (GEE) methodology.
18 GEE regression models are 
used to appropriately estimate the population average effects from a sample of individuals when the correlation s of SIB measures within individuals are unknown. The GEE method accounts for 
the correlation structure in the model. H owever, the estimates of model coefficients and their 
standard errors models are unbiased even if the working correlation model is incorrectly specified . The primary analysis will be conducted on FAS population. The PP and CAS 
populations will be used as supportive analyse s.  All statistical tests for efficacy will be two -
sided tests, with α=0.05.  
   Based on the review of patients not treated with memantine in the NTRP 101-203 clinical trial, the expected number of patients who will drop out of the study prematurely will not be significant.   However, missingness will be accounted for using weighted GEE methods.
19 The 
GEE regression models will be carried out in SAS /STAT PROC GEE  version 13.2. This SAS 
procedure will allow for implementation of weighted GEE methodology that can account for data missing a random. One additional patient may be randomized for each patient who discontinues the study prior to the primary endpoint (Week 28, Day 196).   
9.5 Secondary Efficacy En dpoint s 
Multiple comparisons arising from the listed secondary outcomes will be controlled by using the 
false discovery rate. This procedure will allow control of the type I error rate over the set of secondary outcomes that is less stringent then controlling for multiple comparisons using a familywise error rate (e.g. Bonferroni correction).  
9.5.1 SIB total score from baseline at the Week 42 follow -up visit  
Treatment differences in SIB total score from baseline at Week 42, for subjects who completed that visit,  will be estimated using an ANCOVA model that will adjust for baseline SIB total 
scores, baseline MMSE -2 scores, age, and gender.  
9.5.2 SIB total score from baseline at Week  13 
An ANCOVA model as described in Section 9.5.1 will be created to estimate the difference in SIB total scores at Week 13. Again, as with the SIB difference at Week 42 .  The ANCOVA 
model will adjust for baseline SIB, baseline MMSE -2 scores, age, and gender.

CONFIDENTIAL  
 
Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 64 of 82 9.5.3 SIB total scores from baseline at Weeks 9 , 20, 24 and 30 
The linear regres sion models using the method of GEE as described in Sections 9.4 and 9.5.2 
will be used to estimate the treatment difference in mean SIB total scores from the original 
baseline (i.e. at screening) at Weeks 9,  20, 24 and 30. As desc ribed in Section 9.4, weighted GEE 
will be used to account for data that are missing at random. 
9.5.4 SIB total scores from baseline at Weeks 5, 9, 15, 20, and 24 for subjects with 
baseline MMSE -2 scores of 10-14 and 15-18 
The estimation of the treatment differe nces at Weeks 9, 20, 24 and 30 for patients within each 
MMSE -2 group will be based on GEE linear regression model utilizing SIB total scores from 
baseline at these five time points.  As described in Section 9.4, weighted GEE will be used to 
account for data that are missing at random. 
9.5.5 Individual patient’s SIB t rends over time  
For the secondary endpoint of SIB trends over time, individual- specific slopes of total SIB scores 
will be obtained for all patients. These slopes will be estimated by using SIB data at Week 0, 5, 9, 
13, 15, 20, 24, and 28. An overall population averaged slope will then be estimated for each 
treatment arm, and standard inference methods will be used to test if the  mean treatment -specific 
slopes are 1) statistically different from 0, and 2) statistically different from each other.  Both slopes will be considered using absolute SIB total scores as well as SIB total scores from baseline 
over Weeks 0 to 28.  
   9.6 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints  
The following exploratory endpoints will be analyzed:  
• Change from baseline in ADCS -ADL -Sev total score at Week 13  and Week 42, for 
subjects who completed week 42 
• Change from baseline in MMSE- 2 total score at Week 13  and Week 42, for subjects who 
completed week 42 
Change from baseline in NPI total score at Week 13  and Week 42, for subjects who 
completed week 42 
Similar analysis methods that incorporate the method of GEE as described under the analyses for 
the primary and secondary endpoints will be used for analysis of the exploratory endpoints. 
 9.7 Safety Assessments 
Unblinded summaries and listings of safety data will be provided to the Data Safety Monitoring 
Board , as described in Section 8. Analyses will be performed by an independent unblinded 
statistician so that study investigators and other sponsor personnel (and contractors) involved in study monitoring, data processing and other aspects of the study remain blinded.

• By relationship to clinical trial treatment (definite ly related, probably related, possibly 
related, unlikely related, unrelated)    
Unless otherwise specified, at each level of subject summarization, a subject will be counted 
only once.  If there is more than one occurrence of an event, the event of the worst severity or the worst -case relationship category will be summarized.  
In addition, separate summaries of serious adverse events, and adverse events resulting in discontinuation of study treatment will be presented. 
AEs leading to premature discontinuation of clinical trial treatment, AEs that lead to study 
discontinuation, AEs that lead to death and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will also be summarized by treatment group and relationship.

16 APPENDIX 3  SUMMARY OF CHANGES  
16.1 Protocol Version 2.0  June 1, 2020 
General global edits:  
Several corrections and clarifications were made to address discrepancies in the text. Key 
changes are noted below. 
Synopsis and relevant sections: 
• The version and date were updated. 
• Subjects will be stratified by baseline SIB total scores, which will be balanced between 
treatment groups. 
• The anticipated st art and stop dates were updated to reflect the delays resulting from the 
widespread COVID -19 pandemic. These dates are only estimates at this time, pending 
further evaluation of the potential impact on subject participation. 
• The number of subjects has been modified from 46 to 100. 
  Protocol  #: NTRP -101-204

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 80 of 82  
• All subjects will proceed to a second course of treatment, 7 doses beginning at Week 15.  
• The primary endpoint is at Week 28, after 2 courses of treatment have been administered.  
• The final follow- up visit will be at week 30.  
• The Schedule of Activities has been revised to illustrate the new visit schedule and 
procedures to be performed. 
Protocol sections 4.0 and 9.0: 
Revisions were made to be consistent with the planned statistical analysis.  For the primary 
endpoint analysis, the test of the null hypothesis will be a superiority test based the treatment difference in Week 13 SIB from baseline means as assessed by general estimating equations (GEE) regression models.  Secondary and exploratory endpoints will be similarly assessed. 
Section 6.1.1: The option to utilize a Pre-Screening Consent Form was added. The purpose of the Pre-
Screening Consent is to allow access to medical records prior to a subject’s onsite screening visit. Use of this consent will reduce the occurrence of onsite screening visits by subjects ineligible for the study based on medical history.  No study procedures will be performed under this preliminary consent. 
 
16.2 Protocol Version 3.0  June 30, 2020 
 
Synopsis and Section 4.4.1: Inclusion criterion #5 has been revised. Patients must have a baseline SIB total score of at least 
60 and may not have a SIB score >93 at screening. Previous versions of the protocol required only that subjects be able to complete at least one item on the SIB, but for the moderately severe AD subjects eligible for this study, a range of scores between 60 and 93 is appropriate. 
Section 6.1.21 added: Early Treatment Discontinuation and Follow-up If for any reason, the investigator, subject or caregiver decide at Week 13 that further study drug 
treatments should not be administered, the subject will not enter Treatment Period 2, but will be encouraged to continue follow-up visits.  The visits will take place at Weeks 15, 20, 24, and 30.  All procedures listed for these visits should be performed, with the exception of study drug infusion, infusion-related vitals, and ECG.  Subjects who discontinue treatment are not eligible to resume treatment.  Subjects may discontinue follow-up at any time after Week 15, the 30- day 
follow-up visit for T reatment Period 1.

16.3 Protocol Version 4.0  June 7, 2021 
General global edits:  
Several corrections and clarifications were made to address discrepancies in the text. Key 
changes are noted below. 
• The version and date were updated. 
• The name change of the sponsor from Neurotrope to Synaptogenix has been reflected in 
the text.  
Synopsis: 
The medical monitor’s name and contact information have been updated. Synopsis and Section 9.5: The secondary analyses has been changed, removing analyses of SIB total scores  at Weeks 5 and 
15 and adding an analysis at Week 30. Synopsis and Section 4.4.2, Exclusion Criterion 9: 
Restriction of the u se of acetaminophen has been revised to allow no more than 2,600 
mg/day of acetaminophen for more than 3 consecutive days within 14 days prior to 
screening . 
Synopsis and Section 9.1: 
The per protocol analysis set has been further defined. To be included, subjects must have 
received at least 11 of the14 doses (80%).   
Section 2.1.1.3: 
ClinicalTrials.gov study identifier for study NTRP101-203, 
[STUDY_ID_REMOVED], has been provided to 
facilitate  review of adverse events that occurred in that study .  
Section 2.1.2.3:  
ClinicalTrials.gov study identifier for study NTRP101-202, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED], has been provided to 
facilitate review of adverse events that occurred in that study .  
Sections 6.0.1.1 and 6.1.1: 
B12 testing has been removed for follow-up of abnormal TSH at screening. Section 6.1.22 has been added to describe procedures for early treatment discontinuation follow-
up.

Version 6.0 September 7, 2022  Page 82 of 82  
Section 9.4: 
Text was added to address handling of early study drop-outs. Patients who drop out of the study 
prior to the first efficacy assessment will be replaced.  
Section 14, Appendix 1: 
Restricted concomitant medications have been revised as follows: 
• Prn administration of acetaminophen for pain may be used with a maximum dose of 
2,600 mg/day (e.g., 2x650mg cap twice a day) for no more than 3 days/week. 
• Antacids, antianginal medications, antiarrhythmics, antiasthma agents, antibiotics, antidiarrheal preparations, antihypertensives, antiviral agents, BPH agents, diuretics, and H
2 blockers have been removed from the list. 
16.4 Protocol Version 5.0  December 2 0, 2021 
Global changes: The protocol version and date have been updated. 
The protocol previously stated that blood samples will be drawn to measure the presence or 
absence of bryo statin after the initial dose of study drug on Day 0, and again after dosing on Day 
105.  However, the specialized laboratory where the testing was to be done has been unable to 
perform the test with adequate sensitivity.  We have been given approval by the NIH, which is a sponsor of the study, to remove the test. The test is not included in any of the planned safety or efficacy analyses.  For this reason, it is no longer necessary to draw blood samples at these two timepoints . The text affected by this revision are in Section 6, Table 1, Schedule of Activities, 
Section 6.0.1.1, Laboratory, Section 6.1.2, Week 0, and Section 6.1.11, Week 15. 
The previous version of the protocol stated that patients  who discontinue the study prior to the 
first efficacy assess ment (Week 5, Day 35) will be replaced. The protocol has been revised to 
allow one additional patient  to be added to the study for each patient  who discontinues prior to 
the primary endpoint (Week 28, Day 196). Revised text in Section 9.4 as well as the synopsis 
reflect this change.   
Section 9.4 has been revised to add Week 30 SIB scores to the data to be used in the regression 
models, and to st ate that both linear and non-linear terms will be considered in the regression 
models to be employed in analyses. Details will be provided in t he statistical analysis plan.  
16.5   Protocol Version 6.0   September 1, 2022 
The protocol previously included a follow-up visit at Week 42. The Week 42 visit has been 
removed . However , data collected at this visit for subjects who completed the visit prior to 
implementation of this amendment will be included in the analyses as described. 
References to PKC ε testing and analysis have been removed, since no PKC ε samples were 
collected for this trial.

Clarifications to Final SAP reflecting Primary Paper in the New England Journal of Medicine  05-15-2021:
1.Throughout the protocol and SAP, we refer to the ABC-SW, which is a modified subscale of the ABC-Lethargy,  
Social Withdrawal Subscale that eliminated questions 3, 32, and 53, which refer to lack of movement, in order  
to increase specificity for social reciprocity behaviors.  In writing the primary paper, we wanted to eliminate  
any possible confusion with the original published ABC-Lethargy, Social Withdrawal subscale and referred to  
the modified scale as the ABC-modified Social Withdrawal subscale or ABC-mSW.  We have changed our  
clinicaltrials.gov primary results to use the new nomenclature of ABC-mSW.
2.Reviewers pointed out that it was not entirely clear what our three secondary outcomes were.  Therefore, we 
want to be clear that they are:
      a. the Sociability Factor (abbreviated SF) which combines the ABC-mSW and the PDD-BI screening 
          version in order to assess both areas of social reciprocity challenges and social skills  (there was an  
                       error in the original version of the final SAP in which the sociability factor was inadvertently omitted 
                       from section  4.1.2, which has been corrected)
                   b. the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd Edition - Social Motivation Subscale (abbreviated SRS-2-SM);
                   c. the Stanford Binet, 5th edition Abbreviated Intelligence Quotient (abbreviated ABIQ).
    3. Reviewers requested that we clarify what our sensitivity analyses were. They follow
a.Analysis using the original ABC-Lethargy, Social Withdrawal Subscale
b.Analysis integrating baseline (or screen if no baseline was available) plasma oxytocin level, baseline  
oxytocin level x treatment, and baseline oxytocin x treatment x time into the MMRM model
c.Analysis separately of the ABC-mSW outcome in the minimally verbal and fluently verbal subgroups.
d.Analysis of the ABC-mSW outcome in the per proctocol population
    4. In the primary paper we also clarify that the full analysis set is essentially a modified intent treat sample, and  
         that age group was dropped from the final analysis model because it was not significant.

INTRODUCTION  
Purpose  
The purpose of this SAP is to outline the planned analyses t o support the completion of the primary 
manuscripts to be written for the SOARS -B Study. Exploratory analyses not identified or defined in this SAP 
may be performed to support the clinical trial. Any post -hoc or unplanned analyses performed and not 
identif ied in this SAP will be documented in the respective manuscript.  
Study Objectives  
Primary Objective  
To determine the efficacy of intranasal oxytocin (OT) for the treatment of deficits of reciprocal social 
behaviors in child or adolescent participants wi th autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as measured by changes 
in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Social Withdrawal Scale (ABC -SW) and the sociability factor (SF), a 
combined measure formed from 13 items of the ABC -SW and the Pervasive Developmental Disorders 
Behavior Inventory - Screening Version (PDDBI -SV). 
Secondary Objectives  
To determine the safety and tolerability of OT in participants with ASD as measured by incidence of 
treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and abnormal laboratory values, tolerabi lity of OT dose, and 
time to early termination.  
To determine the efficacy of OT as measured by changes in ABC -SW and SF scores in low -functioning and 
high -functioning strata separately.  
To determine the efficacy of OT as measured by changes in Social Resp onsiveness Scale Version 2 (SRS -2) 
Social Motivation scores, Vineland 2 Adaptive Behavior Composite score and Nonverbal IQ or Mullen Early 
Learning Composite scores.  
To determine the efficacy of OT (as measured by changes in ABC -SW scores, SF scores, SRS -2 Social 
Motivation scores, Vineland 2 Adaptive Behavior Composite, and Nonverbal IQ or Mullen Early Learning 
Composite scores) as a function of age.  
To determine the efficacy of OT (as measured by changes in ABC -SW scores, SF, , SRS Social Motivation 
scor es, Vineland 2 Adaptive Behavior Composite  , and Nonverbal IQ or Mullen Early Learning Composite 
scores) as a function of baseline percent OXTR  gene methylation.  
Exploratory Objectives  
To describe the influence of OT on the oxytocin system as measured b y changes in OXTR  gene methylation, 
mRNA expression of oxytocin relevant genes, levels of oxytocin in plasma and saliva, and whole blood 
serotonin levels over time.  
To determine the efficacy of OT on other clinical assessments  including the subscales of the ABC, SRS, 
Vineland, and PDDBI; the ADOS Calibrated Severity Score (CSS); the Clinical Global Impressions Severity and 
Improvement scores; self -reported social functioning  and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task (RMET).  
To examine the potential inter action between OT and various types of concurrent behavioral and/or 
Page 9 of 179 
pharmacological treatments and social opportunities. 
Study Design 
This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, stratified, flexible dose, placebo-controlled study designed 
to evaluate OT in participants with ASD. OT will be given as an intranasal preparation with two different 
concentrations of 8 IU per insufflation or 24 IU per insufflation. Oxytocin will be administered daily, in single 
doses up to 401U or divided doses in the morning and early afternoon as described in the protocol. Total 
daily dose is flexible, between 8 IU and 80 IU per day. 
Participants who successfully complete screening and baseline assessments and are deemed eligible will be 
randomized to OT or placebo treatment in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by age group (3-6, 7-11, 12-17) and 
functioning (low, high), for a total of 6 strata. Randomization will not be stratified by center, as it was felt 
that additional stratification by center would lead to too many strata, a loss of degrees of freedom, and the 
potential for a grossly unequal randomization to treatments. 
A schematic representation of the study design is shown in Figure 1. After screening and randomization at 
month O (MO), participants enter a double-blind treatment period of 6 months (M6), followed by open-label 
treatment with OT for 6 months, termination of OT at the end of month 12 (M12), and an 18 month (M18) 
follow-up visit 6 months after the month 12 visit. 
Efficacy, safety, and tolerability are measured monthly throughout the treatment period. Participants who 
terminate early will be asked to provide safety data through the remainder of the study. The schedule of 
assessments is provided in Table 1.

GENERAL STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Analysis Populations  
In all p opulations, participants will be analysed in the treatment group into which they were originally 
randomized. Measurements from participants excluded from the pre -defined analysis populations or extra 
measurements (such as unscheduled or repeat assessments)  will not be included in summary tables or 
figures unless specified otherwise.  
Safety Population  
The safety population will include all participants who receive at least 1  dose study drug. The safety 
population will be used for all tabulations of demogr aphics, baseline characteristics, and safety variables, 
unless otherwise specified in the SAP text or the table shell.  
Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all evaluable participants, defined as all randomized participants 
who re ceive at least 1  dose of study drug and have at least 1  primary efficacy assessment on the two co -
primary primary efficacy variables after administration of study drug. The FAS will be the primary efficacy 
population and used in efficacy analyses.  
Per-Protocol Population  
The per -protocol (PP) population is defined as a subset of FAS with no major protocol deviations. Protocol 
violators will be determined before database lock and the unblinding of treatment groups. The per -protocol 
population will be used  only for supportive analyses of  the primary efficacy endpoint.  
General Summarization of Study Data  
Unless otherwise specified, continuous variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics including n, 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3) and minimum and 
maximum values. Categorical variables will be reported as number and percentage of participants in each 
category.  Least squares (LS) means, standard errors, estimates of contrasts with 95% confidence i ntervals 
(CI), and p -values will be reported as appropriate.  
All other statistical tests and confidence intervals will be 2 -sided, unadjusted for multiplicity, and tested at  α 
= 0.05, except those explicitly stated to be otherwise. In cases where we have co -primary outcomes, the 
tests will be adjusted for the number of outcomes using a Bonferroni correction.  
All analyses and summaries will be produced using SAS® version 9.3 (or higher). 
Sequence of Planned Analyses  
All analyses described in this SAP will be performed after data collection has concluded, the database 
locked, and the treatment blind has been broken. There will be no interim analyses of study data except for  
the summaries provided to the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  
Page 13 of 179
An independent DSMB will meet three times yearly to review safety information for the study. The DSMB 
statistician will prepare summaries of data as described in the Safety Analyses sect ion, separating them into 
treatment group A and treatment group B and will distribute them only to the members of the DSMB.  The 
database manager will provide the DSMB with the treatments referred to by A and B if requested, but will 
not see the final repo rts.  No study team member other than the DSMB statistician will see the summaries 
provided to the DSMB.  
PARTICIPANT DISPOSITION ANALYSES  
General Summaries  
Disposition will be summarized for all enrolled participants. Summaries will include counts of:  
Participants who were enrolled  
Participants who were enrolled but not randomized  
Participants who were randomized  
Participants who were randomized but did not take study drug  
Participants who were in the safety population  
Participants who were in the FA S  
Participants who were in the PP population  
Participants who completed the study  
Participants who terminated the study early  
Participants with the each potential primary reason (i.e. adverse effect, inconvenience, administrative, lack 
of efficacy, noncom pliance, lost to contact) for early termination  
All summaries will be presented by treatment group and over all participants. A listing of disposition will be 
provided for all participants.  
Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations will be recorded by ea ch site as they occur and/or captured during monitoring visits. 
Before database lock and treatment unblinding of the study, study investigators will review all protocol 
deviations and determine whether or not they are assessed to be major protocol deviatio ns. 
Major protocol deviations are defined as those that potentially impact participant safety and/or data 
integrity, and may include but are not limited to the following:  
Dosing/randomization errors  
Procedural errors  
Participant did not meet all inclusio n and exclusion criteria  
Participant   treatment assignment was unblinded during the study 
All major protocol violations will be summarized and listed for the study.  
Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics wi ll be summarized by treatment group and over all participants 
Page 14 of 179 
for the safety population. Demographic characteristics will include sex, age, race, and ethnicity. Baseline 
efficacy variables (see Efficacy Analyses section for list), vital signs, and female r eproductive status will also 
be summarized.  
Age (months) will be calculated as the number of months between date of birth and date of informed 
consent.  
Medical and psychiatric history will be summarized by treatment group and over all participants using  the 
number of observations and percentage of participants reporting each category for the safety population. 
Dose and Compliance  
All dosing, exposure, and compliance information will be summarized by treatment group and over all 
participants for the s afety population.  
Summaries of dose will include the percent of participants not able to tolerate the target dose, mean six 
month and 12 month doses, mean maximal dose, and the percent of participants whose dose was a) not 
increased up to the target dose ; b) was reduced to below the target dose; or c) was reduced but still at or 
above the target dose.  A summary will also be provided of the percent participants whose six month and 12 
month doses were given once a day versus twice a day.  
Duration of expos ure for study drug (days) will be determined by calculating the difference between the 
date of last dose known to be taken and date of the first day medication was taken inclusive (last treatment 
date – first treatment date) + 1.  
Treatment compliance will  be calculated using the following formula and categorized as <80%, 80% - 120%, 
or >120%:  
Number of days medication taken% Compliance for study medication 100Number of days of exposure
Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be categorized into the following groups: Neurobehavioral medications:   
alpha adren ergic agonists, anti -anxiety medications, anti -cholinergics, anticonvulsants/mood stabilizers, 
antipsychotics, stimulants, and sleep aids and Other medications: acid reducers, anti -infection medications, 
cough/allergy/asthma medications, heart medications,  inhalation steroids, nutritional supplements, 
systemic steroids, and other.  
Medications stopped prior to the first date of study drug dosing will be considered prior medications. We do 
not plan to summarize these medications.  Medications taken after the  first date of study drug dosing will be 
considered concomitant medications.  
Concomitant medications for each study treatment group will be summarized according to their 
membership in the groups noted above by . Upon request, a summary of each specific m edication name will 
be provided.   
Page 15 of 179
In summaries, if a participant has taken a concomitant medication more than once, the participant will be 
counted only once in the total.   
EFFICACY ANALYSES  
The FAS will be used as the analysis population for all effi cacy analyses unless otherwise specified.  
Efficacy Variables  
Detailed description of all efficacy variables is given in the protocol. All efficacy variables will be analyzed as 
change from baseline, except where noted.  
Primary Efficacy Variables  
The fo llowing variables will be analyzed as co -primary endpoints:  
ABC-SW Total  
Sociability Factor (SF) 
The SF will be calculated by discarding the three lethargy items (3, 32, 53) from the ABC -SW, summing the 
13 remaining items of the ABC -SW subscale, and addi ng the sum to the PDDBI -SV raw social deficits score.  
Key Secondary Efficacy Variables  
The following variables with be analyzed as jointly key secondary endpoints:  
SRS-2 social motivation subscale score  
Vineland 2 adaptive behavior composite score  
Nonverbal IQ or Mullen Early Learning Composite scores  
Exploratory Efficacy Variables  
Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI -S)
Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI -I)
CGI-I will be analyzed as an endpoint mean instead of change from baseline.
ABC subscales for irritability, stereotypy, hyperactivity, and inappropriate speech
Calibrated Severity Score derived from the ADOS 2 (CSS)
Scores from the ADOS will be used to derive a raw score for 14 specific questions according to the
child’s age, verb al abilities and the module used. A score of 8 will be converted to a score of 0.  A
score of 3 will be converted to a score of 2.  These questions are listed in Table 2 below.
The raw scores will then be used to derive a CSS which takes account of the chi ld’s age, module used
and, for module 1, whether there are no words or single words using Table 3 below.
The CSS for children 15 -17 who are assessed with a module 1 will be derived using the 6 -14 criteria.
The CSS for 17 year olds assessed with module 2 or  3 will be derived using the 9 -16 or 10 -16 criteria
respectively.
PDDBI - Full Version subscales
Caregiver strain questionnaire (CSQ) and its subscales
Vineland 2 domains for communication, daily living skills, socialization, and maladaptive behaviors;
Page 16 of 179
motor skills will not be analyzed since it is only valid in young children 
Participant rating of social function (only in verbally fluent individuals)
Child and Adolescent Symptom Inventory disease categories
Social Opportunity Questionnaire
Reading the Mind  in the Eyes test (only in individuals with fluent speech and understanding of basic
emotions)
OXTR gene methylation and mRNA expression
Serum and salivary oxytocin levels
Whole blood serotonin

General Modeling Considerations for Efficacy Analyses  
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses will fit a mixed longitudinal model with change from baseline to 
each post -baseline month for a resp onse variable, low or high functioning group and age group as 
stratification variables, OT or placebo treatment group as the between -subjects factor, month as a within -
subjects factor, treatment by month interaction, and baseline as a covariate.  We will c hoose between two 
kinds of models:  (1) a random coefficients model treating month continuously with random coefficients for 
the intercept, slope, and slope squared, and  an unstructured covariance matrix among them, and (2) an 
mixed model with repeated me asures (MMRM) treating month categorically and examining unstructured, 
Toeplitz, autoregressive, and compound symmetric covariance structures among months.  We will choose 
among these candidate models using an information criterion (AIC) while remaining bl ind to the significance 
of the treatment effect to avoid bias in the choice of model.  Distributional assumptions will be examined 
using residuals.  These mixed models could fail to converge or encounter difficulties based on their use of 
asymptotics.  If they do, we will attempt to simplify the models in order to eliminate the problems, and if 
necessary, move to analyses that assume compound symmetry, but use a Huynh -Feldt correction if 
compound symmetry fails.  
Missing Data Considerations for Efficacy An alyses  
The mixed models that will be used to evaluate efficacy variables are able to handle moderate amounts of 
missing data provided they are missing at random.  We will examine the missing at random assumption by 
assessing baseline differences between d ropouts and completers, as well as differences in response 
variables up to the point of premature withdrawal.  If the missing at random assumption does not appear to 
be tenable, we will report the mixed models results but spend additional effort characteri zing treatment 
effect at time of premature withdrawal.   
Primary Efficacy Analysis  

Page 18 of 179
The co -primary efficacy response variables will be tested using a Bonferroni -corrected significance level of α 
= 0.025.  Longitudinal models as described in General Modeling Considerations will be fit with dependent 
variables of change from baseline to each post -baseline month up to month 6.   
The following sample SAS code will be referenced for the random coeff icients model.  
PROC MIXED data = xxx ORDER=DATA;  
CLASS treat functioning agegroup subject;  
MODEL change= baseline agegroup treatment month treatment*month/ DDFM=KR;  
RANDOM intercept month/ TYPE=UN SUBJECT=subject (treatment);  
ESTIMATE “Treatment Diff at M onth 6” treatment 1 -1 treatment*month 6 -6; 
RUN;  
The following sample SAS code will be referenced for MMRM model:  
PROC MIXED data = xxx ORDER=DATA;  
CLASS treat functioning agegroup month subject;  
MODEL change= baseline agegroup treatment month treatment *month/ DDFM=KR;  
REPEATED month/ TYPE=xx SUBJECT=subject (treatment);  
LSMEANS treatment*month;  
LSMEANS treatment*month / SLICE=month;  
RUN;  
The ESTIMATE statement in the random coefficients model and LSMEANS statement with the SLICE=month 
option in the MMR M will produce the test of treatment effect at month 6.  
As a sensitivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis will also be conducted in the per -protocol population.  
Subgroup Analysis for Primary Efficacy Variables  
As a secondary analysis for the prim ary efficacy variables, the primary efficacy variables will be analyzed 
within each of the low and high functioning stratum separately. This will be done using the same model as 
described in the primary efficacy analysis, but using contrasts to test the di fference between the treatments 
on the month 6 change scores within each of the low and high -functioning strata.  
Addition of Covariates to Primary Efficacy Analysis Model  
As additional secondary analyses for the primary efficacy variables, the following groups of covariates will be 
added separately to the model in the primary efficacy analysis and tested for their significance:  
Baseline age, treatment -by-age interaction, treatment -by-age-by-month interaction.  
Baseline percent OXTR gene methylation, trea tment -by-baseline -methylation -interaction, treatment -by-
baseline -methylation -by-month interaction  
In both cases, the primary test will be the significance of treatment -by-variable -by-month interaction, and if 
not significant, the treatment -by-variable int eraction.  
The predictor for age group listed in the description of the model fit in primary efficacy analysis will be 
Page 19 of 179
removed from the model adding baseline age and interactions as covariates.  
Analyses of Key Secondary Efficacy Variables  
The three key secondary efficacy variables will be tested using a Bonferroni -corrected significance level of α 
= 0.0167 using the same model as in the primary efficacy analysis.  Supplemental analyses will include 
separate analyses in low and high -functioning strata and inclusion of baseline age and baseline percent 
OXTR methylation covariates, as described in th e primary efficacy analysis.  
Analyses of Exploratory Efficacy Variables  
Exploratory efficacy variables will be analyzed the same way as the primary and secondary efficacy variables 
except with no Bonferroni correction for type I error.  
Analyses of Mont h 12 and Month 18 Follow -up Data  
Following the 6 -month double blind phase, all participants will receive 6 months of OT during an open label 
phase. Therefore, participants randomized to OT during the 6 month double -blind phase will receive 12 
months of OT  treatment, and participants randomized to placebo will received 6 months of OT treatment.  
The longitudinal models used in previous analyses will be fit for the following time periods and participant 
groups. All analyses will be considered exploratory and  will not include any correction for type I error:  
Change from 6 months to 12 months in participants receiving OT during the double -blind phase.  
Change from baseline to 12 months in participants receiving OT during the double -blind phase.  
Change from 6 mo nths to 12 months in participants receiving placebo during the double -blind phase.  
Change from baseline to 12 months in participants receiving placebo during the double -blind phase.  
Change from 6 months to 12 months compared to change from baseline to 6 mo nths in participants 
receiving placebo during the double -blind phase.  
Change from baseline to 6 months of OT treatment in either the double -blind or open treatment periods.  
This will combine baseline to 6 months data for participants receiving OT during t he double -blind phase with 
6 months to 12 months data (relabeled as baseline to 6 months) in participants receiving placebo in the 
double -blind phase.  
Change from 12 months to 18 months in participants receiving OT during the double -blind phase.  
Change fro m baseline to 18 months in participants receiving OT during the double -blind phase.  
Change from 12 months to 18 months in participants receiving placebo during the double -blind phase.  
Change from baseline to 18 months in participants receiving placebo duri ng the double -blind phase.  
SAFETY ANALYSES 
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated based on the incidence of TEAEs, incidence of elicited reports of 
suicidal ideation or statements, self -injurious behaviors, and suicidality, incidence of AEs leading t o 
termination, vital signs measurements, abnormal laboratory test results, and ECG findings. All safety data 
will be presented using the safety population.  
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Potential Suicidality  
Adverse events will be monito red continuously from the time a participant signs the informed consent 
Page 20 of 179
document until the completion of the final follow -up visit.  Similarly reports of suicidal ideation or 
statements, self -injurious behaviors, and suicidality elicited from participants who are able to speak and 
understand the concepts and all caregivers will be elicited at every contact and followed continuously  
Medical and behavioral conditions that are present at screening and/or baseline will only be considered 
treatment emergent adv erse events if their severity increases significantly after the participant has taken at 
least one dose of study treatment.  Intermittent conditions such as seasonal allergies will only be considered 
TEAEs if the severity or frequency is significantly grea ter than in the previous two years.  Only TEAEs will be 
considered in the adverse event safety analyses.   
TEAEs will be coded using the Systematic Longitudinal Adverse Event Scale (SLAES). Additional details about 
this scale are given in the protocol.  
Severity of adverse events will be categorized as mild, moderate, severe, life -threatening, or resulting in 
death. Relationship to treatment will be categorized as unknown or not applicable relationship, unrelated, 
possibly related, probably related, or cer tainly related.  
Overall summary of TEAEs, such as all TEAEs, severe TEAEs, TEAEs by severity, TEAEs by relationship to 
treatment, TEAEs leading to study termination, serious TEAEs, life -threatening TEAEs and TEAEs resulting in 
death, will be summarized by category and preferred term for each treatment group and over all 
participants. All TEAEs with moderate or greater severity will be listed for each participant. Severe TEAEs, 
TEAEs leading to study termination, serious TEAEs, and TEAEs resulting in deat h will be listed separately.  
All reports of suicidal ideation or statements, self -injurious behaviors, and suicidality will be summarized at 
each time point.  In addition the proportion of these that represent a significant change in frequency or 
severity  from the child’s baseline level of functioning as determined by the caregiver will be summarized. In 
addition, the proportion of these events that the steering committee judges represent stereotypic behaviors 
will be summarized.  For each participant with  a report of potential suicidality, the sequence of their reports 
for each study visit will be provided.   
No formal hypothesis -testing analysis of TEAEs or suicidality incidence rates will be performed.  
Vital Signs  
Vital signs (systolic and diastolic bl ood pressure, pulse, and body temperature) will be measured monthly at 
every study visit.   
Blood pressure and pulse will be measured with the participant as calm as possible and sitting.  
Vital sign measurements will be summarized at each time point for t he absolute value and for changes from 
baseline by treatment group and over all participants.  Alarm values will be determined prior to unblinding 
and the percent of participants with values in the alarm range will be summarized at each time point by 
treat ment group.  
All vital signs data will be available upon request.  
Weight and Body Mass Index  
Weight and Height are measured monthly at every study visit. Weight and BMI will be summarized at each 
Page 21 of 179
time point for the absolute value and for changes from b aseline by treatment group and over all 
participants.  All weight and BMI data will be available upon request.  
Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Blood and urine samples for safety laboratory assessments will be collected at screening, month 6, and 
month 12 .  To the extent possible, blood samples will be obtained at approximately the same time of day 
and under non -fasting conditions.  All safety labs except prolactin will be processed by LabCorp.   
Laboratory test results, including prolactin results, will be summarized by treatment and over all participants 
at each time point for the absolute value itself and for changes from baseline.  We will also summarize the 
percent of participants in each treatment group with values within alarm ranges, which will be defined prior 
to breaking the blind.  The mean value and SD  of the labs within alarm ranges will be summarized at each 
time point.  All measurements of the out of range value for each participant with an out of range value will 
be listed.  
12-lead Electr ocardiogram (ECG)
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at screening, month 6, and month 12.  To the extent possible,  ECGs will be 
performed after the participant has rested quietly for at least 5  minutes in the supine position. QT intervals 
will be automatica lly corrected by the ECG machine using Bazett’s formula (QTcB) and Fridericia’s formula 
(QTcF).  It will be noted if the participant was agitated or in a nonsupine position.  
Interval data will be summarized at each time point for the absolute value and fo r changes from baseline by 
treatment group and over all participants. Intervals that are outside of alarm ranges will be summarized.  
Overall assessment of ECG as normal or abnormal will also be summarized by treatment group using counts 
and percentage.

the DSMB.
SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL POWER CONSIDERATION  
We will use a mixed longitudinal model for our primary analyses (see Efficacy Analyses section).  Since some 
aspects of the model such as covariance structure are unknown, we performed power and sample size 
calculations using a more conservative, simplified model corresponding to a two -group t -test on change 
scores.  We plan to analyze two co -primary outcomes measured as change from baseline to month 6: the 
ABC-SW, which will provide consistency with pivotal trials of other medications hypothesized to improve 
ASD social symptoms, and the combined social score, which integrates ABC -SW symptoms with the new 
PDDBI -SV in order to fully capture the range of impairments in reciprocal social behaviors observed in ASD.  
We will use an alpha of 0.025 to correct for two co -primary outcomes. SOARS -B is powered to allow 
independent evaluation of oxytocin efficacy in low and high -functioning youth.   
Standard deviations of change scores for the ABC -SW range from ~5 to 9 in several large ASD intervention 
trials (Shea 2004; McCracken 2002; Owen 2009; Marcus 2009, King 2009; Am an 2009).  We consider a 
between groups difference of 5 -7 points in ABC -SW change scores to be clinically meaningful.  In our power 
calculations, we use conservative estimates of 9 points for the SD of ABC -SW change and 5 points for 
between group differenc es in ABC -SW changes (differential improvement on ~1/3 of items).  To achieve 80% 
power with an alpha of 0.025 on the ABC -SW, we will require 71 participants in each treatment group within 
the two strata. Thus, our total required sample to evaluate the ABC -SW separately in low and high -
functioning strata is 284.  We examined change in the combined social score in 30 3 -17 year olds with ASD, 
20 treated with aripiprazole and 10 medication -free controls.  The mean baseline value was 33.5 (17.2 SD) 
and the chan ge overall was -10.7 (SD 13.0), with a SD of change in each group of 11.9.  Within each treatment 
group, changes in the combined social score paralleled those in the ABC -SW and PDDBI -SV, but had less 
variability (Sikich, personal data).  We consider a betw een groups difference in the combined social measure 
changes of 10 -12 to be clinically meaningful.  Conservative estimates using a SD of 15 and a between groups 
difference of 10 in the combined social score changes results in a larger effect size for the c ombined social 
measure than for the ABC -SW.  Consequently, we should have at least 80% power for tests of the combined 
social score.  A sample size of 300 will allow for 5% attrition between randomization and the first post -
randomization visit.  The primar y objective considers all participants, resulting in much greater power than 
for analyses in separate strata.  The power of moderator analyses depends on the distribution of participant 
characteristics and variability in methylation and mRNA expression obs erved, which can’t be estimated 
reliably at this time.

1. INTRODUC TION
1.1 PURPOSE  
The purpose of this SAP is to outline the planned analyses to support the completion of the primary manuscript to 
be written for the SOARS -B Study. Other analyses not identified or defined in this SAP may be performed to 
support the clinical  trial, and will be described in separate SAPs. Any post -hoc or unplanned analyses performed 
and not identified in this SAP will be documented in the respective manuscript.  
1.2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
1.2.1  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
To determine the efficacy of intranasal oxyto cin (OT) for the treatment of deficits of reciprocal social
behaviors in child or adolescent participants with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) as measured by
changes in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist - Social Withdrawal Scale (ABC -SW) .
1.2.2  SECONDARY OBJECTIV ES 
To determine the efficacy of OT as measured by changes in ABC -SW scores as a function of baseline
plasma oxytocin levels, age and functional level and the interaction of each with treatment, and with
treatment and week.
To determine the safety and tole rability of OT in participants with ASD as measured by incidence of
treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and abnormal laboratory values, tolerability of OT dose, and
time to early termination.
To determine the efficacy of OT as measured by changes in  the sociability factor (SF), a combined
measure formed from 13 items of the ABC -SW and the Pervasive Development Disorders Behavior
Inventory –Screening Version (PDDBI -SV).
To determine the efficacy of OT as measured by changes in ABC -SW scores in low -functioning and high -
functioning strata separately.
To determine the efficacy of OT as measured by changes in Social Responsiveness Scale Version 2
(SRS -2) Social Motivation scores and Stanford Binet -5 Abbreviated IQ standard scores.
1.2.3  EXPLORATORY OBJECTIV ES 
To determine the efficacy of OT on other clinical assessments  including the subscales of the ABC, SRS,
Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale 2nd edition (VABS), and Caregiver Strain Questionnaire, the PDDBI -
SV; the Clinical Global Impressions Severity and Im provement scores  and, in the high functioning
participants only, the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET).
1.3 STUDY DESIGN  
This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, stratified, flexible dose, placebo -controlled study designed to 
evaluate OT in participants with ASD.  OT will be given as an intranasal preparation with two different 
Page 31 of 179
concentrations of 8 IU per insufflation or 24 IU per insufflation.  Oxytocin will be administered daily, in single 
doses up to 40 IU or divided doses in the morning an d early afternoon as described in the protocol.  Total daily 
dose is flexible, between 8 IU and 80 IU per day.   
Participants who successfully complete screening and baseline assessments and are deemed eligible will be 
randomized to OT or placebo treatmen t in a 1:1 ratio, stratified by age group (3 -6, 7-11, 12 -17) and functioning 
(low, high), for a total of 6 strata. Randomization will not be stratified by center, as it was felt that additional 
stratification by center would lead to too many strata, a loss  of degrees of freedom, and the potential for a grossly 
unequal randomization to treatments.  
A schematic representation of the study design is shown in Figure 1 . After screening and randomization at week 0 
(W0), participants ente r a double -blind treatment period of 24 weeks (W24), followed by open -label treatment with 
OT for 24 weeks, termination of OT at the end of  week 48 (W48), and a week 53 -55 (W53 -55) or week 72 OFF 
treatment  follow -up .  Although the study design requires patient follow -up from week 0 to week 53 -55, this SAP 
focuses on data analyses for the double -blind treatment period (week 0 to week 24).  
Efficacy, safety, and tolerability are measured every four weeks throughout the treatment period. Participants who 
terminate early are asked to provide safety data through the remainder of the study. The schedule of 
assessments is provided in Table 1 .

2.GENERAL STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
2.1 Analysis Populations  
In all populations, participants will be analysed in  the treatment group into which they were originally 
randomized. Measurements from participants excluded from the pre -defined analysis populations or extra 
measurements (such as unscheduled or repeat assessments) will not be included in summary tables or 
figures unless specified otherwise.  
2.1.1.  Safety Population  
The safety population will include all participants who receive at least 1  day of study drug. The safety 
population will be used for all tabulations of  safety variables, unless otherwise speci fied in the SAP text or 
the table shell.  
2.1.2.  Full Analysis Set  
The full analysis set (FAS) will consist of all evaluable participants, defined as all randomized participants 
who receive at least 1  day of study drug and have a baseline assessment on th e ABC -SW and  at least 
1 primary efficacy assessment on the ABC -SW after administration of study drug. The FAS will be used for all 
tabulation of demographics and baseline characteristics, and the primary efficacy population and used in 
efficacy analyses.   
2.1.3.  Per-Protocol Population  
The per -protocol (PP) population is defined as a subset of FAS who complete the full 24 weeks of double 
blind treatment with study drug (including those who stayed on the study drug for at least 22 weeks with 
80% treatmen t compliance) and all assessments of the ABC -SW at baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. 
The per -protocol population will be used only for supportive analyses of  the primary efficacy endpoint.  
2.2 General Summarization of Study Data  
Unless otherwise s pecified, continuous variables will be summarized with descriptive statistics including n, 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, first quartile (Q1) and third quartile (Q3) and minimum and 
maximum values. Categorical variables will be reported as number a nd percentage of participants in each 
category.  Least squares (LS) means, standard errors, estimates of contrasts with 95% confidence intervals 
(CI), and p -values will be reported as appropriate.  
All other statistical tests and confidence intervals will  be 2 -sided, unadjusted for multiplicity, and tested at α 
= 0.05, except those explicitly stated to be otherwise.  
All analyses and summaries will be produced using SAS® version 9.3 (or higher). 
2.3 Sequence of Planned Analyses  
All analyses described in this SAP will be performed after data collection has concluded, the database 
locked, and the treatment blind has been broken. There will be no interim analyses of study data except for 
the summaries provided to the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  
Page 34 of 179
An independent DSMB will meet twice yearly to review safety information for the study. The study’s DSMB 
statistician will prepare summaries of data as described in the Safety Analyses section, separating them into 
treatment group A and treatment group B a nd will distribute them only to the members of the DSMB.    No 
study team member other than the DSMB statistician will see the summaries provided to the DSMB.  
Analyses for the primary manuscript as described in this SAP will focus on analyzing data during  the 24 -week 
double -blinded treatment period.  Analyses on open -label treatment period (24 -48 weeks) and the off -
treatment follow -up period (>48 weeks) will be specified in separate analysis plans.  
When performing analyses for the primary efficacy variab le (ABC -SW), additional models with baseline 
serum oxytocin, age, and functionality as covariate will be examined and tested prior to analyzing data on 
the secondary efficacy variables.    
2.4 Summary of Data Sources  
Data collected at each center by inve stigators are entered into the ReDCAP database, and 
parents/guardians’ responses on various measurements are entered into the Qualtrics database. The RMET 
data are entered into the Qualtrex participant database.  Both RedCAP data and Qualtrics data are use d for 
analysis.  
3.PARTICIPANT DISPOSITION ANALYSES
3.1 General Summaries  
Disposition will be summarized for all enrolled participants. Summaries will include counts of:  
Participants who were enrolled
Participants who were enrolled but not randomized
Participants who were randomized
Participants who were randomized but did not take study drug
Participants who were in the safety population
Participants who were in the FAS
Participants who were in the PP population
Participants who completed the doubl e blind portion of the study
Participants who terminated the study early
Participants with the each potential  primary reason  for early termination (i.e. adverse effect,
inconvenience, administrative, lack of efficacy, noncompliance, lost to contact)
All summaries will be presented by treatment group and over all participants. A listing of disposition will be 
provided for all participants who did not complete the double blind portion of the study.  
3.2 Protocol Deviations  
Protocol deviations will be recor ded by each site as they occur and/or captured during monitoring visits. All 
protocol deviation data will be available upon request.  
Page 35 of 179
3.3 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment  group and over all participants 
for the FAS population. Demographic characteristics will include sex, age, race, and ethnicity. Clinical 
characteristics will include Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS) severity scores.  Baseline efficacy 
variables (see Efficacy Analyses section for list), vital signs, and female reproductive status will also be 
summarized.  
Age (months) will be calculated as the number of months between date of birth and date of baseline visit. . 
3.4 Dose and Compliance  
All dosin g, exposure, and compliance information will be summarized by treatment group and over all 
participants for the FAS population.  
Summaries of dose will include the percent of participants not able to tolerate the target dose, defined as 
those who were not  at 48 IU TDD or higher at week 24, mean 24 week dose, and mean maximal dose.  
Medication compliance will be evaluated each time the participant returns study medication at week 4, 8, 
16, 20 and 24 using the formula below. The average of non -missing percen t compliance per subject will be 
used to report mean treatment compliance for each treatment group.  
3.5 Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications will be categorized into the following groups and subgroups: Neurobehavioral 
medications:  alpha adr energic agonists, anti -anxiety medications, anti -cholinergics, anticonvulsants/mood 
stabilizers, antidepressants, antipsychotics, stimulants, other attention deficit hyperactivity disorder 
medications and sleep aids and Other medications: medications for g astrointestinal disorders, anti -infection 
medications, cough/allergy/asthma medications, heart medications, inhalation steroids, nutritional 
supplements, systemic steroids, and other.  
Medications stopped prior to the first date of study drug dosing will b e considered prior medications. We do 
not plan to summarize these medications.  Medications taken after the first date of study drug dosing will be 
considered concomitant medications.  
Concomitant medications for each study treatment group will be summari zed according to their 
membership in the groups noted above. Upon request, a summary of each specific medication name will be 
provided.   

Page 36 of 179
In sum maries, if a participan t has taken a concomitant medication more than onc e, the partici pant will be 
counted only once in the total.   
4.EFFICACY ANALYSES
The FAS will be used as the anal ysis population for all efficacy anal yses unless otherw ise specified. 
4.1 Efficacy Variables 
Detailed description of all efficacy variables is given in the protocol. All efficacy variables will b e analyzed as 
change from baseline, except where noted. 
4.1.1 Primary Efficacy Variable 
The ABC-SW score will be analyzed as the primary endpoint. 
4.1.2 Secondary Efficacy Variables 
The following variables will be analyzed as secondary endpoints: 
4.1.3 •Sociability Factor
•SRS-2 social motivation subscale score
•Stanford Binet-5 Abbreviated IQ (ABIQ)
Exploratory Efficacy Variables
•Clinical Global Impression - Severity (CGI-S )
•Clinical Global Impression - Improvement (CGI-I )
•CGI-I will be analyzed as an endpoint mean instead of change from baseline.
•ABC subscales for irritability, stereotypy, hyperactivity, and inappropriate speech
•PDDBI-S V total score
•Caregiver strain questionnaire (CSQ) and its subscales
•Vineland 2 adaptive behavior composite score, and domain scores for daily living skills,
communication and socialization. Motor skills will not be analyzed since it is only valid in young
children
•Reading the Mind in the Eyes test (only in individuals with fluent speech and understanding of
basic emotions)
4.2 General Modelling Considerations for Efficacy Analyses  
Unless otherwise specified, the primary model is mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM), with 
change from baseline to each post -baseline timepoint for a response variable,  functioning (low versus high) 
as the stratification variable, center as a blocking factor, treatment (oxytocin versus placebo), week as a 
continuous variable, treatment and week interaction, and baseline value as a covariate, with random 
coefficients for the intercept and week, with an unstructured structure among the random coefficients.  We 
will investigate the interaction of treatment, week, and functioning and adopt the most parsimonious model 
as the final model.  Distributional assumptions will be exa mined using residuals.  These mixed models could 
fail to converge or encounter difficulties based on their use of asymptotics.  If they do, we will attempt to 
Page 37 of 179
simplify the models in order to eliminate the problems, and if necessary, move to analyses that a ssume 
compound symmetry, but use a Huynh -Feldt correction if compound symmetry fails.  
4.3 Missing Data Considerations for Efficacy Analyses  
If there is <5% of subjects with covariate data points missing, then no additional sensitivity analyses will be 
performed. If there are >=5% of subjects with missing covariate data, we will perform multiple imputation 
(MI). We will use the full conditional specification method (FCS) to impute missing data. If data have a 
monotone missing pattern, we will use linear r egression to impute continuous variables, logistic regression 
to impute binary/ordinal variables, and the discriminant function to impute nominal variables. We will check 
normality of continuous variables. If very asymmetric, variables will be transformed.  We will create 20 
imputed datasets including all variables intended to be used in subsequent statistical analysis as a minimum.  
We will analyze the complete datasets using standard statistical analyses. Finally, the results from each 
model will be combin ed to produce inferential results.  
If there is <5% of subjects with efficacy outcome data points missing, this will be considered a negligible 
amount and no additional sensitivity analyses will be performed. If there are >=5% of subjects with missing 
outcome data, the Mixed -Effect Model Repeated Measure (MMRM) approach is able to handle moderate 
amounts of missing data provided they are missing at random. However, it is difficult to rule out the 
possibility that at least some of the missing data are missi ng not at random (MNAR). We will apply a pattern -
mixture approach to investigate the MNAR pattern. Specifically, we will define the missed visit indicator (1 if 
missing and 0 if observed). We fit a pattern -mixture MMRM model with this defined missed visit indicator. 
The coefficient of the missed visit indicator (e.g., gamma) is estimated and tested for statistical significance. 
If this coefficient is not statistically different from zero, missing at random assumption is valid. Otherwise, 
the missing is not at random. If the latter, we conduct an extensive sensitivity analysis by pre -specifying the 
value of gamma, which plays the role of sensitivity parameter to the MAR assumption. We define a grid in a 
plausible range of sensitivity parameter. For each pre -specified value, we investigate the treatment effect. 
When the pre -specified value is zero, the analysis assumes MAR.  
4.4 Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy response variable will be tested at the level of α = 0.05.  Longitudinal models as 
described in General Modeling Considerations will be fit with dependent variable of change from baseline to 
each post -baseline timepoint (weeks) up to week 24. The primary hypothesis test of interest will be a test of 
treatment effect at week 24.  
As a sensi tivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis will also be conducted in the per -protocol population.  
4.5 Subgroup Analysis for Primary Efficacy Variable  
As a secondary analysis for the primary efficacy variable, the interaction of treatment -by-functiona lity-by-
week will be examined.  In addition, the primary efficacy variable will be analyzed within the low and high 
functioning stratum separately.  
4.6 Addition of Covariates to Primary Efficacy Analysis Model  
As additional secondary analyses for the pri mary efficacy variable, the following groups of covariates will be 
added separately to the model in the primary efficacy analysis and tested for their significance:  
Page 38 of 179
Baseline age, treatment -by-age interaction, treatment -by-age-by-week interaction.  
Baselin e serum oxytocin, treatment -by-oxytocin interaction, treatment -by-oxytocin -by-week interaction. 
In both cases, the primary test will be the significance of treatment -by-variable -by-week interaction, and if 
not significant, the treatment -by-variable inter action.  
4.7 Analyses of Key Secondary Efficacy Variables  
The key secondary efficacy variables will be tested using the same model as in the primary efficacy analysis. 
For variables that were only measured at baseline and Week 24 (or the latest visit d uring the randomized 
treatment period), the change scores will be reported, and treatment group differences will be tested using 
two sample t -test.   
4.8 Analyses of Exploratory Efficacy Variables  
Exploratory efficacy variables will be analyzed the same way as the primary and secondary efficacy variables. 
5.SAFETY ANALYSES
Safety and tolerability will be evaluated based on the incidence of TEAEs, incidence of elicited reports of 
suicidal ideation or statements, self -injurious behaviors, and suicidal ity, incidence of AEs leading to 
termination and changes in vital signs, modified BMI z -score , ECG findings and laboratory measurements, 
and incidence of pre -specified abnormal laboratory test results. All safety data will be presented using the 
safety po pulation.  
5.1 Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) and Potential Suicidality  
Adverse events will be monitored continuously from the time a participant signs the informed consent 
document until the end of double -blind randomized treatment period (we ek 24).  Similarly, reports of 
suicidal ideation or statements, self -injurious behaviors, and suicidality elicited from participants who are 
able to speak and understand the concepts and from all caregivers will be elicited at every contact and 
followed co ntinuously during the double -blind treatment.  
Medical and behavioral conditions that are present at screening and/or baseline will only be considered 
treatment emergent adverse events if their intensity increases significantly (i.e. numeric rating of inte nsity is 
increased) after screening and/or baseline.   
TEAEs will be coded using the Systematic Longitudinal Adverse Event Scale (SLAES) mapping to MedDRA 
terms and MedDRA terms for TEAEs not mapped in the SLAES. Additional details about this scale are gi ven in 
the protocol.  
Intensity of adverse events will be categorized as mild, moderate, severe, life -threatening, or resulting in 
death. Relationship to treatment will be categorized as unknown or not applicable relationship, unrelated, 
possibly related, likely related, or certainly related. For FDA reporting, all possibly related, likely related and 
certainly related TEAEs will be considered related.  
Page 39 of 179
Overall summary of TEAEs, such as all TEAEs, TEAEs by intensity and TEAEs by relationship to treatment,  will 
be summarized by category and preferred term for each treatment group and over all participants.  TEAEs 
leading to participant withdrawal from the study, and TEAEs resulting in death will be listed separately.  
Serious adverse events (SAE), defined u sing generally accepted criteria as stated in the protocol, will be 
listed and summarized by treatment group and participant experiencing at least one SAE.  Relationship to 
treatment and outcome will be included in each listing.  
All reports of suicidal id eation or statements, self -injurious behaviors, and suicidality will be listed by 
participant and treatment group.    
No formal hypothesis -testing analysis of TEAEs or suicidality incidence rates will be performed.  
5.2 Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements  will be summarized at each time point for the absolute value and for changes from 
baseline by treatment group.  Alarm values will be determined prior to unblinding and the percent of 
participants with values in the alarm range will be summarized at each t ime point by treatment group.  
All vital signs data will be available upon request. 
5.3 Weight and Body Mass Index  
Weight and Height are measured at every study visit. These values will be used to determine the BMI and 
modified BMI z score at each time  point.  Changes in modified BMI z -score from baseline to Week 24 by 
treatment group will be summarized.  All BMI data will be available upon request.  
5.4 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Blood and urine samples for safety laboratory assessments will be c ollected at screening, and week 24.  To 
the extent possible, blood samples will be obtained at approximately the same time of day and under non -
fasting conditions.  All safety labs will be processed by LabCorp.   
Laboratory test results, including prolact in results, will be summarized by treatment at baseline and for 
changes from baseline.  We will also summarize the percent of participants in each treatment group with 
values within alarm ranges, which will be defined prior to breaking the blind.  The mean  value and SD of the 
labs within alarm ranges will be summarized at each time point.  All measurements within alarm ranges for 
each affected participant will be listed.  
5.5 12-lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed at screening, an d week 24.  
Interval data will be summarized at baseline and week 24 for the absolute value and for changes from 
baseline by treatment group. Intervals that are within alarm ranges will be summarized and listed by 
participant.  Overall assessment of EC G as normal or abnormal will also be summarized by treatment group 
using counts and percentages.  
Page 40 of 179
5.6 Safety Data Reported to the DSMB  
Safety data will be submitted to the independent DSMB twice per year. The following summaries will be 
provided for rev iew at each meeting, separated by treatment group:  
Summary table of participant disposition including number screened, number randomized, number
completed, percent early terminated, and reasons for early termination.
Listing of all participants terminating  the study early with duration of treatment and reason for
study discontinuation.
Listing of all SAEs.
Summary table of the number and percent of participants with TEAEs by severity.
Summary table of the number and percent of participants with TEAEs by re lationship to study drug.
Summary table of the number and percent of participants with specific TEAEs leading to participant
early withdrawal. .
Summary table of the number and percent of participants with TEAEs by system organ class and
preferred term by treatment group.
Listing of all severe TEAEs.
Summary table of the number and percent of participants with suicidal ideation or vocalizations,
self-injurious behaviors and suicide attempts by treatment group.
Listing of all suicidal ideation or vocalizatio ns, self -injurious behaviors and suicide attempts by
treatment group.
Summary of the proportion of suicidal ideation or vocalizations, self -injurious behaviors and suicide
attempts by treatment group that are judged to be more severe than the participant’s  baseline level
of such behaviors.
Additional summaries of other study data, including efficacy data, may be provided if requested by the 
DSMB.  
6.SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL POWER CONSIDERATION
We will use a mixed longitudinal model for our primary a nalyses (see Efficacy Analyses section).  Since some 
aspects of the model such as covariance structure are unknown, we performed power and sample size 
calculations using a more conservative, simplified model corresponding to a two -group t -test on change 
scores.    SOARS -B is powered to allow independent evaluation of oxytocin efficacy in low and high -
functioning youth.   
Standard deviations of change scores for the ABC -SW range from ~5 to 9 in several large ASD intervention 
trials (Shea 2004; McCracken 200 2; Owen 2009; Marcus 2009, King 2009; Aman 2009).  We consider a 
between groups difference of 5 -7 points in ABC -SW change scores to be clinically meaningful.  In our power 
calculations, we use conservative estimates of 9 points for the SD of ABC -SW change and 5 points for 
between group differences in ABC -SW changes (differential improvement on ~1/3 of items).  To achieve 90% 
power with an alpha of 0.05 on the ABC -SW, we will require 71 participants in each treatment group within 
the two strata. Thus, our to tal required sample to evaluate the ABC -SW separately in low and high -
functioning strata is 284.  A sample size of 300 will allow for 5% attrition between randomization and the 
first post -randomization visit.  On 3/28/2016, the study team reduced the attri tion rate to 1% based on 
attrition observed in the study, which gives a final sample size of 290. The primary objective considers all 
participants, resulting in much greater power than for analyses in separate strata.

Summary of Changes to SAP for SOARS -B Primary Analysis  
Page 43 of 179
High Level Summary of Changes in the SAP for the SOARS-B Study Primary Analysis 
Changes from version dated 3- 21-2013 to final version 2.0 dated 2- 19-201 8 
1.Added new statistical analysis team due to Dr. Hamer’s death and Dr. Johnson’s departure from academia.
The new team consists of Drs. Sheng Luo and Lilin She, who modified the final version of the consent in
collaboration with lead PI Dr. Sikich.
2.Changes in Treatment Site Principal Investigators
3.Limited SAP to analysis to primary manuscript , due to DCRI SOP’s and financial limitations. Noted additional
SAPs would be written for subsequent analyses.  This included removal of all analyses involving genetic
measures, salivary oxytocin levels, serotonin levels, changes in plasma oxytocin after baseline, concurrent
behavioral and pharmacological interventions, the Child and Adolescent Symptom Index (CASI) and novel
assessments including self-reported social functioning, social opportunities  Section 4.9 of original SAP was
deleted.
4.Removed the sociability factor (SF) as a primary outcome.  The SF is also referred to as combined measure of
ABC-SW and PDD-BI Screening version.  The SF was removed due to emerging evidence that it was not more
sensitive to changes than either measure alone.
5.Added specification of covariates in the model including baseline plasma oxytocin levels. Note that there is
an error in final SAP in that predefined age group was used in these analyses rather than an actual age in
months.
6.Removed inclusion of cognitive functioning assessed by the Mullen instead focusing only on cognitive
functioning assessed by the Stanford Binet 5th edition due to the small number of participants completing
Mullen and issues converting to a common measurement unit.
7.Deleted secondary analysis of Vineland measures.
8.Updated study design figure and schedule of procedures to reflect changes to visit schedule (note there is an
error in the Figure such that Week 12 visit is missing).
9.Eliminated examination of baseline percent OXTR  gene methylation as a covariate in analyses due to
challenges in quantification of percent methylation given multiple possible methylation sites and ongoing
challenges with assessing methylation of the OXTR  gene.
10.Added that the full analysis set will only include participants who have both a baseline and post-baseline
ABC-SW, rather than just a post-baseline assessment of the primary outcome.  (This reflects deletion of SF as
a primary outcome measure.)
11.Specified that the demographics and baseline symptom measures will reflect only the full analysis set.
12.Clarified that age will reflect age at time of baseline visit rather than screening since there was often a lag of
several months between screening and baseline for the early participants in the trial due to issues with  study
drug.
13.Deleted reporting of psychiatric history.
14.Will no longer adjust for multiplicity
15.Eliminated the following exploratory efficacy measures: Calibrated ADOS severity score, PDD-BI subscales
replacing with PPD-BI screening version.
16.Eliminated Vineland 2 two domain composite score and maladaptive behaviors subscales, as well as
measures listed in item 3.( above) from exploratory efficacy variables.
17.In Section 4.2, eliminated age group as a stratification variable, eliminated evaluation of two kinds of models
instead using a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM)
18.Specified thresholds for conducting sensitivity analyses for missing data.
19.Provided more detail related to SAS programming for primary analyses.
20.In Section 4.6 of SAP deleted examination of OXTR gene methylation and instead added examination of
baseline serum oxytocin level.
21.Section 4.7 of SAP, removed bonferroni correction using simple two sample t-test instead
22.Error in section 4.8 of final SAP. Exploratory efficacy variables were analyzed in the same way as the key
secondary efficacy analyses.
23.Section 5.1 changed severity of TEAEs to intensity paralleling changes in the SLAES.
24.Section 6, eliminated use of two primary outcomes.

1 INTRODU CTION: BA CKGROU ND INFORMATION A ND SCI ENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
1.1 Background Information 
There is a t remendous u nmet n eed for  accessible treatments that add ress co re symptoms of ASD 
and are safe for  sustained use, especially for the population of nonv erbal individuals who r equire 
the most in tensive lif elong support.  We have created the ACE SOARS  Network to provide  the 
infrastructure necessary to me et this ne ed on an ongoing basis.  Our  initial clinical trial, 
described in this app lication, is SOARS-B (the S tudy of Oxytocin in ASD to improve Reciprocal 
Social Behaviors).  SOARS-B will test a  very promising potential tr eatment−intranasal 
oxytocin −for ASD ’s fundament al social communication deficits in a l arge, highly generalizable 
group of verbal and non verbal child ren.  SOARS-B will also provide in formation about the 
regulation of DNA methylation and transcription of the o xytocin receptor gene (OXTR ), as well as 
other  genes relevant to oxytocin ’s CNS activity, as a function of time  and in response to o xytocin 
treatment. Th ese data will fill a key gap in our  understanding of oxytocin ’s role in ASD and its 
ability to alter epigenetic modifications of  OXTR . 
1.2 Rationale 
THE SOCIAL  MOTIVATION MODEL  OF ASD  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY 
Difficulties in social orienting are evident across auditory and visu al modalities and across the  
lifespan in ASD (Dawson 1998, 2004; Whitehouse 2008; Sasson 2007).  El ectrophysiologic 
studies have found that individuals with A SD can attend to so cial sti muli if instructed to do so, but 
that they do not do so  spont aneously (Ceponiene PNAS 2003 ).  In contrast, typically developing 
individuals  give preferential attention to so cial sti muli, processing them faster with greater brain 
activation in pr efrontal  cortex than nonso cial sti muli (Goren 1975; G reene 2011). Youth with A SD 
show  slow er processing of so cial versus nonso cial sti muli and the rate inversely correlates with the 
magnitude of  social impai rments (D awson 2004 ).  Individuals with ASD also appear to experience 
reduced relative rewards from interpersonal interactions.  In contrast to 
their typically developing peers, children with A SD prefer looki ng at pictures of in animate 
objects to look ing at pictures of p eople (Sasson 2008, 2011 ).  They also fail to activate the 
ventral striatum, whi ch is the center of the brain’s reward circuit, in response to so cial rewards 
whereas high levels of activation are evoked by social rewards in typically developing children 
(Scott -Van Zeeland 201 0).  Further, when presented with so cial stimuli, children with A SD show 
reduced rather than inc reased activity in the prefrontal cortex, whi ch assesses the relative value 
of a reward (Greene 2011).  The  extent of  reduction correlates with the s everity of social and 
communication impairments in children with A SD (Ohnishi 2000; D awson 1998 ).  These 
differences, as well as ASD’s clini cal presentation, h ave led to the hypothesis that ASD is related 
to a fundament al impai rment in so cial mo tivation  (Waterhouse  1996; D awson 2002, 2005; G relotti 
2002).

THE ROLE OF OXYTOCIN IN SOCIAL  BEHAVIOR 
Oxytocin is the b rain’s most abund ant neu ropeptide.  It can act as a classic al neu rotransmitter, 
a neuromodu lator and a hormone with actions th roughout the body (Gimp le 2001, V eening 2010, 
Baskerville 2010 ).  Oxytocin’s h alf-life in the plasma is 1-2 minutes compa red to ~30 m inutes in 
the C SF.  Centr al release of oxytocin is d ependent upon CD38 and dramatically stimulates 
further release of oxytocin (~1000 fold) and in creases the number  of oxytocin-containing cells in 
the p eriventricular nucleus.  To gether these factors lead to long lasting oxytocin elevations 
throu ghout the brain following  acute in creases in CSF oxytocin.  O ne of oxytocin ’s major  central 
actions is to a ctivate the  brain’s reward circuit by increasing dopamine release from the ventral 
tegmental area to the ventral striatum, amygdala and hippoc ampus.  Its neuromodulato ry actions 
appear to result prim arily from somatod endritic  release with b inding  to oxytocin receptors that  
are widely distributed throughout the limbic region and prefrontal cortex.  Differential species- 
specific patterns of  social behavior appear related to the distribution and density of oxytocin and 
vasopressin receptors in the brain (Insel 2010). O xytocin can bind vasop ressin receptors,  although 
it is unknown to wh at it extent it  does so norm ally.  Oxytocin  also can inc rease expression of  
oxytocin and vasopressin receptors  in the brain althou gh these effects are often sexually 
dimorphic and highly regulated by horm ones and  interleukins (Moos 1989, Mor ris 
2004, M iyan 2003, Triboll et 1989, Bales Hormone Behavior 2007,  Bales Neuroscience 2007, 
Carter 2009, Ca rter 2007).  So cial isolation and so cial str ess so mewhat later, during the post- 
weaning period, also ha ve sexually dimorphic effects on the numb er of oxytocin and vasopressin 
neurons (Bales Devel Psychobio logy 2007,  Tanaka 2010 ). 
In animal models including prim ates, o xytocin has been demonstr ated to i ncrease eye contact, 
social app roach, so cial recognition, so cial memo ry, and generosity and to reduce stress responses 
(Takayangi 2005;  Liu 2008, Insel 2010).  O xytocin also influences soc ial beh avior in pe ople 
(MacDonald 2010).  E xogenous o xytocin increases gaze to eye regions, so cial cognition, so cial 
memo ry, posit ive communication, empat hy, perceptions of t rustworthiness, and cooperation 
within one’s own group (Guastella 2008, 201 0; Domes 2007; Di Simplicio 2008; Fischer-Shofty 
2010; K eri 2009; Unk elbach 2008; Savaskan 2008; Rimmele  2009; Dizt en 2008; Zak 2005,  
2007; Th eodoridou 2009; Petrovic 2008; Kosf eld 2005, Baumgartner 2008; De Dreu, 201 0). 
Intranasal oxytocin  also reduces cortisol; perceived stress, amygdala activation to threatening 
social images, and  tolerance of ethnic differences (Heinrichs 2003; Kir sch 2005; Petrovic  2008; 
De Dreu 2011 ).  Ho wever, some  of these effects, including enhancement of  social memori es and 
secure attachment, m ay be limited to ind ividuals with less robust proso cial behaviors in itially 
(Bartz 2010 a, 2010b, Buchheim 2009 ).  Allelic v ariations in OXTR have also been correlated with 
infant atta chment, social auditory processing, empat hy and prosocial decision making  
(Lerer 20 10; Tops 2011,  Chen 2011 ). 
OXYTOCIN’S POTENTIAL ROLE IN ASD  
Mult iple v ariations in the o xytocin s ignaling system have  been associ ated with ASD relative to 
controls.  Allelic v ariations in the CD38 gene, which is r equired for central release of oxytocin, 
and in  OXTR have been identifi ed, some  of which also ha ve been correlated with cognition and 
functioning  in individuals with ASD ( Green 2001 ; And ari 2010;  Munesue  2010; Wu 2005;  
Jacob 2007;  Lerer 2010; Yrigollen 2008; T ansey 2010; Wermter 2010; Liu 2010; C ampbell 
2011;  Riebold  2011 ).  Mod estly greater (~ 20-40%)  OXTR methylation r elative to controls has 
been found  in two smal l, indep endent ASD samples (Gregory 2009 ).  Redu ced plasma  oxytocin  
and C D38 m RNA expression have also be en reported in ASD (Modahl 1998, Jin 2007).  
Page 55 of 179
Oxytocin has shown promise for modifying social behavior in mouse models for ASD and in 
people with ASD and related disorders. In the Otxr null mouse, a single dose of oxytocin 
improved social deficits, reduced aggression and reduced vulnerability to chug-induced seizures, 
apparently acting through the vasopressin IA receptor. Fmiher, in these mice, repeated doses of 
oxytocin improved reversal learning, indicating enhanced cognitive flexibility (Sala 2011). A 
single dose of oxytocin also improved social deficits in Cd38 null mice (Higashida 2010). In 
Fragile X, which is frequently comorbid with ASD, oxytocin improved gaze avoidance and 
reduced co11isol elevations elicited by social interaction (Hall 2011). In high functioning 
individuals with ASD, single doses of oxytocin enhanced attention to faces and eyes, visual and 
audito1y affect recognition, the ability to distinguish whether others were being cooperative, and 
preference for interacting with receptive individuals (Andari 2010; Guastella 2010; Hollander 
2007). Oxytocin challenge also reduced self-repo1ied compulsive and repetitive behaviors 
(Hollander et al., 2003). Sustained oxytocin treatment has been repo1ied to improve ASD 
symptoms in one child (Munesue 2010). In the only pilot study of sustained oxytocin treatment 
cmTently completed, affect recognition accuracy improved three times as much with 6 weeks of 
oxytocin treatment as had been repo1ied in Andari's single dose study (Anagoustou in 
preparation, network preliminaiy data). Within the next 6 months, an 8-week blinded study of 
oxytocin in 24 children with ASD will be completed at UNC. 
OUR WORKING MODEL 
The above evidence regai·ding impaiiments in social orienting and social reward in ASD, 
oxytocin's role in social orienting and social motivation, and variability in various aspects of 
oxytocin signaling among people with ASD, together with extensive prelimina1y evidence that 
supplemental oxytocin can impact social behaviors in ASD, have led to the fo1mulation of our 
working model (Figure 1). We postulate that ASD pathophysiology acts to fundamentally alter 
social orienting and decrease the relative value ascribed to social rewai·ds resulting in limited 
social motivation. Reduced social motivation leads to a vicious cycle of reduced social 
oppo11unities, reduced learning from social feedback, reduced skills and functional abilities and 
worsening of ASD's core social communication symptoms, which fuiiher reduces social 
motivation. We hypothesize that sustained intranasal oxytocin treatment will positively modify 
the earliest paiis of this cycle -social orienting and the value of social rewai·ds -and disrnpt the 
cycle leading to improvements in the core social and communication impaiiments of ASD.

1.3 Potential Ris ks 
There is a dearth of  information about the s afety of sustain ed use  of oxytocin, although more 
information is emerging on a daily basis. Indeed, the objective of specific Aim 2 is to provide 
such information, gath ered prospectively in a systematic ally elicited fashion. 
Oxytocin has been reported to e xert a large number of effects in the bo dy and the b rain (Gimpl & 
Fahrenholz  2001 ). The  classic physiological effects of o xytocin in hu mans as well as all 
placental mammals are uterine contractions and milk ejection.  Th ese are conclusively known to 
occur only under the hormonal conditions at the  end of  pregnancy and pos tpartum  when oxytocin 
receptors proliferate in t he uterus and mamm ary tissue and la ctogenesis occurs.  Th eoretically, 
oxytocin administration could c ause uterine contractions during  phases of the menstru al cycle 
when estrogen levels are relative ly high or in women who are receiving estrogen.  This, ho wever, 
has never been demonstr ated or  reported. IV administration of  Oxytocin is  FDA approved for 
induction or facilitation of  labor  and postp artum contraction of  the ut erus. Intranasal oxytocin 
spray is also av ailable in other  countri es to facilitate nu rsing in new mothe rs.  Intranasal oxytocin 
also w as FDA approved as a lactation aid in the United States until  1995 when it was withd rawn 
from the US market by the compa ny that manu factured it, Nov artis.  This  was a business  
decision and the FDA h as confirmed no s afety concerns were involved in this de cision. 
A numb er of adverse effects have  been reported in the context of th ese two clinical applic ations, 
primarily with intravenous administration of  oxytocin, which in clude anaphylactic reaction, 
hypertension, hypotension, c ardiac arrhythmias, nausea and vom iting, afibrinogenemia and 
associ ated bl eeding and, in the context of p rolonged intr avenous administration of  oxytocin, 
hyponatremia. There has also be en at least one  report of lif e-threatening anaphylaxis during 
surgery when mu ltiple d rugs were being intravenously infus ed simu ltaneously (D. Pant, et al, 
2009 ).  Symptoms that may result from anaphylaxis include generalized hives, it chiness, or 
flushin g; crampy abdom inal pain, dia rrhea, and vomiting; a feeling of anxiety and impending 
doom;  swelling of the  lips, ton gue, throat resulting in shortn ess of b reath, wheezes or strido r, and 
low o xygen; a drop in blood p ressure  that m ay result in a feeling of lightheadedness and  loss of 
consciousn ess; reduced muscle  tone with poss ible loss of bl adder control; and, most se riously, 
coronary artery spasm m ay occur with subse quent myocardial infarction or  cardiac dysrhythmia 
and poss ible d eath.  Th ere is also a case report of psychosis occurring during oxytocin tr eatment of 
a man with obs essive compu lsive disord er (Ansseau et al, 1987 ), although the re are two completed 
pilot studies in schizophrenia th at have  reported reduction of  psychotic symptoms ( Feifel et al, 
2010  – using a TDD of 40 IU duri ng week 1, followed by a TDD of  80 IU for 2 weeks in 16 
people; Pedersen et al., 2011 usi ng TDD 48 IU for 2 weeks in 7 p eople)  with no si gnificant 
adverse events. There are a limited numb er of published,  sustained o xytocin treatment stud ies in 
adults with ot her diseases (Den Boer 1992, Epp erson 1996 a, Epperson 1996b, Ohlsson 
2005 ).

Evidence for safety of sustained intranasal oxytocin treatment in ASD 
Placebo contrnlled safety data of sustained intrnnasal oxytocin treatment in people with ASD is 
available from three cunently unpublished trials: 
• the Anagnostou adult study (10 on TDD 48 ID oxytocin for 6 weeks, 9 on placebo),
• a trial conducted by Adam Guastella, personal communication 2012 (26 teens on total
daily dose [TDD] 24 ID oxytocin for 8 weeks, 24 on placebo), and
• the UNC Autism Speaks pilot trial in 3-17 year olds (12 on oxytocin with TDD ranging
between 4 ID and 64 ID for 8 weeks and 13 on placebo) and 24 on open label oxytocin TDD up
to 48 ID for 8 weeks. Adverse events observed dming the double blind and open-label phases of
the UNC oxytocin pilot study are shown in Table 1.

We have been able to access the raw adverse event data from these three trials and have 
aggregated it to provide adverse event data on 48 individuals with ASD exposed to oxytocin for at 
least 6 weeks and 46 individuals with ASD ti-eated with placebo. This aggregation, shown in 
Table 2, found low rates of adverse events in both oxytocin and placebo groups and no signal for 
greater adverse events with oxytocin ti·eatment. None of these studies identified any significant or 
systematic changes in electi·olytes or vital signs. The apparently higher rates in the UNC Pilot 
study probably reflect differences in the methods of assessing adverse events. The UNC pilot 
study used systematic elicitation of adverse events (same instilllllent as proposed for SOARS-B 
ti·ial) and the other studies used spontaneous repo1i or much more limited questionnaires.

There is also p reliminary safety data regarding even more  extended oxytocin treatment for  up to  
6 months in childr en with  ASD available by personal commun ication from from an o ngoing trial 
funded by DOD being conducted by Evdokia Anagostou in 11  youth 1 0-17 years tre ated for up 
to 6 months tr eated with oxytocin  yielding a total of 22 youth.  T here have been no s ignificant 
lab abnorm alities in these particip ants.  Th ree (14%) have shown in creases in irritability or mood 
lability and one  has had  increased allergy symptoms. 
Blood Draw Risks: 
During laboratory blood  draws the  risks involved are pain, bruising, and rarely, infection at the 
location wh ere the blood w as taken.  This risk wi ll be min imized by having a  trained p rofessional 
take each particip ant’s blood.  We will attempt to avoid these  risks by using aseptic techniques, 
and applying pressure  after the phlebo tomy.  A lo cal anesthetic  may be used to 
reduce associ ated pain if the p articip ant wish es to use it.  If a subject becomes nervous or  agitated 
about the phleboto my procedures, we will utilize an anti-anxiety medi cation to c alm subjects 
who m ay be nervous.  
Psychological /Psychia tric Risk: 
This patient population c an be at risk f or worsening of psychiatri c/psychological symptoms that 
may be attribut ed to their ment al illness alone, m edication no n-adherence, or a number  of other 
causes th at may not be  related to this study.  The Principal Investigator will use clinical judgment 
to ass ess each treatment emergent ad verse event and determine intensity and relatedness to the  
study.  In cases of worsening of symptoms p atients may require  inpatient hospitalization.  If the 
study doctor feels that the subject is at s erious risk for  hurti ng thems elves or others, he/she  can ask 
a judge to allow the particip ant to be hospitali zed against his/her will. Subjects may become 
frustrated du ring study procedures.  Research staff will work to ensu re that all directions and 
questions are easy to unde rstand for subjects who  have intellectual dif ficulties.  Subje cts will  be 
allowed bre aks, if needed. 
Since this is a large trial of oxytocin that will  require patient involvem ent for up to 52 w eeks (1  
year), a subject’s psychiatric care will be assumed by the stu dy physician. 
Confidentiality Risk 
The potential ind irect risks are related to loss of confid entiality and could include som eone such 
as an insu rance agency or employer learning that the p articip ant has  a serious m ental i llness with 
resulting potential sti gmatization.  It is also poss ible th at pub lic kno wledge of this diagnosis or  
its document ation in the medi cal record could lead to inability to ob tain insurance coverage at 
reasonable rates in the  future. 
Page 60 of 179
Additional risk for OPTIONAL biomarker/genetics portion:  
There are no additional n eedle sti cks for  this port ion of  the stu dy. However, the additive in the  
DNA collection tube  can be irritating if it con tacts the skin so sp ecial care will be t aken so th at, 
during  the blood d raw, the additive in the tube  doesn’t flow out into the collection needle. 
2 OBJEC TIVES  
The ACE SOARS  Network’s immedi ate goals are to translate  these  exciting findin gs regarding 
oxytocin ’s neurobehavioral effects into an evidence-based, widely accessible intervention for ASD’s 
fundament al impairments in reciprocal social behaviors  and to identi fy factors that differentially 
influ ence respon se to oxytocin  treatment in ASD.  Our central hypothesis  is that intranasal oxytocin 
will partially reverse the early pathophysiologic alterations in social orienting and the salience of 
social rewards present in ASD,  which lead to decreased social motivation  and ultimately to ASD ’s 
core social communication impairments, thereby enhancing reciprocal social behaviors  (see Figure 
1, in Impact section).   Sustain ed improvements  in social motivation  and social reciprocity are 
expected to facilitate communication and learning and ultimately improve functioning.  We will 
accomplish our immedi ate goals by condu cting SOARS-B, a large (n=300) random ized, doubl e- 
blind trial of sustained (six month) treatment with intranasal oxytocin in children 3-17 years old with 
ASD  and examining clinical and biological factors that may predict or enhance respons e. Regardless 
of SOARS-B’s outcom e, its results will significantly impact the care of people with ASD  by 
definitively testing  a very promising translational treatment strategy in a highly generalizable 
sample.  The mode rator analysis is likely to support treatment personalization.  The exploratory 
epigen etic studies will enhance understanding  of the regulation  of key biological pathways in ASD 
and facilitate development of future  treatments. 
2.1 Specific Aims 
Specific Aim 1: Determine the efficacy of intranasal oxytocin treatment in children with ASD. 
Analysis 1a: Compa re oxytocin tr eatment to pla cebo for improvi ng reciprocal social b ehaviors. 
Hypothes is: oxytocin  will reduce maladapt ive social  behaviors and increase prosocial  behaviors. 
Analysis 1b: Compa re oxytocin  treatment to placebo for improving reciprocal social behaviors 
separately in subgroups  of children who have significant language impairment and intellectual 
disabili ty and those  whose language and in tellectual abil ities are in the normal range at baseline. 
Hypothesis:  oxytocin ’s actions on the social  reward system are unrelated  to verbal or cognitive 
abilities. 
Analysis 1c: Compa re the tr eatments’ enhancement  of soci al motivation, cognitive ski lls and 
functioning. Hypothesis: oxytocin will increase social motivation , improving acquisitio n of cogniti ve 
and functional  skills.  
Specific Aim 2: Provide information about the sa fety and tolerability of intranasal oxytocin. 
Analysis 2a: Compa re incidence and severity of treatment emergent adverse effects, clinically 
significant  laboratory  and  electrocardiog ram  changes,  serious  adverse  events  and  treatment 
discontinu ation due  to tolerability issues over six months in the oxytocin and pla cebo groups. 
Analysis 2b: Tabulate  these  safety indicators du ring six months of op en oxytocin treatment 
Page 61 of 179
Specific Aim 3: Identify clinical or biological  traits that preferentially  influence response to 
oxytocin. 
Analysis 3a: Determine if baseline age influ ences behavioral changes more  in the oxytocin  group.  
Hypothesis:  the magnitude  of chang es obser ved depends on both intervention efficacy and  brain 
plasticity.  Analysis 3b: Determine if baseline OXTR methylation levels predict level of behavioral 
improvement.  
Working hypothesi s: greater OXTR  methylat ion decreases oxytocin  receptor density and increases 
the amount  of oxytocin  required  to bind available receptors  and elicit optimal reciprocal  social 
behaviors. 
Analysis 3c: Determine if other  baseline traits or intervening experiences interact preferentially with 
oxytocin  
Exploratory Aim 4: Describe the changes in OXTR methylation and mRNA expression of genes 
related to oxytocin signaling occurring over six months with oxytocin and placebo treatment. 
Rationale:  understanding  the regula tion of oxytocin  signal ing will facilitate developm ent of novel 
treatm ents. 
2.2 Study Outcome Measures 
2.2.1  Primary Outcome Measures 
Our primary outcome is reciprocal social b ehaviors, which we will assess  using  two co- 
primary measures.  The  first measure is the ABC-SW subsc ale, which is b eing used in other 
clinical trials focusing on the core social and communication symptoms of  autism.  The oth er 
measure is a combined social score from the ABC-SW, whi ch prim arily captures aloo f, and 
avoidant b ehaviors,  and the Pe rvasive Developmental Disord ers Behavior Inventory-Screening 
Version (PDDBI-SV, C ohen 2011 ), a recently developed m easures which  assess es both 
maladaptive social prob lems and so cial skil ls.  The  PDDBI-SV is compris ed of 18 items 
includ ed in the old er, more comprehensive Pe rvasive Developmental Diso rders Behavior 
Inventory (PDD-BI, Cohen 2003 (x2)). The PDDBI-SV assess es both so cial impai rments  
typically associated with  the active but odd sub type of ASD and development of p ro-social skills 
that are integral to improved reciprocal social behavior.  The  PDDBI-SV results in a raw 
SOCDEF  score, which is the sum of the  reverse-scored social skills and  the regularly-scored 
problems, and a SOCD EF T score.  In marked contrast to the PD D-BI’s age-based standard 
scores (for children 1.5 and 12.5  years old ), the PDDBI-SV SOCDEF  score does not change with 
age in individuals with A SD.  The PDDBI-SV has been validated in original PDD-BI development 
sample  of 311 children 1-17 years old and a recently-acquired sample th at includes  
145 youth bet ween 13 and 15 years old, 90 b etween 16 and 19  years, and 59 between 20 and 40 
years (Cohen 2011, personal commun ication). The combined social score will be calculated by 
discarding the th ree lethargy items from the ABC-SW (questions 3, 32, and 53, whi ch all assess 
reduced physical movement), sum ming the 13 remaining  items of the ABC-SW subsc ale, and 
adding  it to the PDDBI-SV raw SOCD EF score.  The combined social score is derived from two 
well-validated instrum ents and  has face validity for capturi ng the full r ange of imp airments in 
reciprocal social behaviors obs erved in A SD.  We chose not to use  the Soc ial Respons iveness 
Scale (SRS), which was developed to p rovide  a quantitative m easure of social impairments 
typically observed in A SD in children 3-18 years old, be cause it has been demonstr ated to be  
Page 62 of 179 
quite stable ov er time  (Constantino 2000, 2009)  and no in tervention studies h ave clearly 
demonstr ated its sensit ivity to ch ange. 
2.2.2  Secondary Outcome Measures 
Secondary Outcome Measures: We will use the  SRS Social Mo tivation subscale to assess 
oxytocin ’s hypothesi zed mechanism  of action.  Co gnitive skills will  be assess ed using  the 
Stanford Binet-5th Edition (SB -5) (Roid).  If a child cannot complete  the routing tests on the S B-
5, they will be assess ed using the Mull en. Functional skills including  communication will  be 
assess ed usi ng the standard s core of the Vineland 2, the C aregiver Strain Questionnaire (Brannan 
1997)  and, in ve rbally fluent youth, a 7 item q uestionnaire being piloted to assess p articip ant 
satisfaction with their social relationships, whi ch is included in the appendix. The  specific 
components of th ese measures tested in Aim 1c are SRS Social Motivation  subsc ale, the  NV IQ 
or Mullen Early Learning Comp osite stand ard score, and the  Vineland Adaptive Behavior 
Composi te.  Oth er subs cales of  these  measures and the oth er functional measures will  be 
analyzed in an exploratory way. 
2.2.3  Additional Exploratory Outcome Measures 
Additional Cl inical As sessments: In order to p rovide a  compr ehensive assessment of the clinical 
features of children in the trial we will also perform several other assessments.  The Cl inical 
Global  Impressions – Improvement s core, whi ch is rout inely used in pha rmacologic clinical 
trials, will  capture the stu dy physician’s global impression of  response. Other symptom domains 
in ASD will  be assess ed with the original PDD-BI using raw scores since norm ed scores are only 
provided for children younger than 13, the oth er subs cales of the ABC, and the s everity score 
derived from the ADOS (Gotham 2009).  We will also obtain the complete SRS to spe cifically 
assess i ts sensitivity to change in comparison to other  outcomes.  All concomitant medi cations 
and behavioral or alternative medi cation the rapies will be recorded at each vis it. 
Assessment of tr eatment-emergent ad verse effects will utilize the system atic longitudinal adverse 
effects scale developed by Sikich and described in the o xytocin t reatment section. 
Exploratory Behavioral Measures: We will include two exploratory behavioral measures that 
seek to add ress gaps in currently validated m easures (eg. ASD appropriate, particip ant ev aluation 
of social sati sfaction) or to obje ctively assess a  social behavior that we hypothesi ze will be 
improved by oxytocin t reatment.  This me asure is  most  likely to be  useful in adoles cents as 
younger children, but has not b een validated in anyone above  12.  We will also incorporate the 
Reading the Mind in the  Eyes Task (Baron-Cohen) into our  analysis, whi ch has been shown to be  
sensit ive to bo th sin gle and sus tained dos es of oxytocin. Ho wever, its use  is restrict ed to h igh- 
functioning  individuals  who can verbally identi fy specific emotions.  
Biologic O utcome Measures:  We will obtain bl ood, u rine and vi tal signs from p articip ants at 
regular intervals in order to ass ess the safety of oxytocin.  In addition, we  obtain blood f rom 
particip ants at sc reening and mon ths 2, 6, 8, 12 and 18 that will  used to ass ess OTXR differential 
methylation status and to  assess m RNA expression.  We will also obtain a  blood s ample from 
particip ants (and the ir biolo gical parents with ap propriate consent) to don ate to the NIMH genetic 
reposito ry for establishment of lymphoblast cell lines 
Page 63 of 179 
Potential i nteracting factors:  We will assess p otential environme ntal fa ctors that m ay interact with 
oxytocin tr eatment through caregiver reports.  Our main focus is on s ocial skil ls treatments, 
interventions the  child receives outs ide of the  school setting  and so cial op portunities outside of 
school s ettings for interactions with p eers, adults who are not caregivers/treatment provid ers, and 
caregivers/treatment providers. 
3  Study Design 
SOARS-B is a la rge (n =300)  random ized, pla cebo-controll ed trial of sust ained (6 mon th), flexible 
dose intranasal oxytocin tr eatment in children 3 to 17  years old with A SD.  The prim ary aim is to 
determine the efficacy of oxytocin for  improving  reciprocal social  behaviors in the entire sample and 
the low- and high-functioning sub groups.  Soci al motivation, cognitive skills and functional 
behaviors  will be secondary outcomes.  We will examine safety during the 
doubl e-blind ph ase and the six month open extension ph ase.  The  second major  aim of the  study is 
to identi fy whether participant b aseline clinical and bio logical characteristics such as age and extent 
of OXTR methylation preferentially influ ence respon se to supplem ental o xytocin.  In 
post-hoc exploratory analyses, we will examine the in fluence of intervening processes, s uch as 
concomitant antipsychotic or so cial sk ills treatments that are likely to be randomly distribut ed 
between the o xytocin and pla cebo groups, on o xytocin response.  Finally, particip ants will  be 
assess ed six  months after stopping  oxytocin to assess maintenance of treatment effects

4.3 Ra tionale for Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
Frequently when large trials are done with a v ery specific subpopul ation, no  further studies are 
done  to explore  response  in other subg roups b ecause of the  large cost of su ch trials and public 
frustration with stud ies perceived as duplic ative and inc rement al.  Ho wever, families and 
clinicians caring for individu als from un tested sub groups often struggle to make  treatment 
decisions without a ny specific evidence regarding efficacy or safety.  Therefore, we have made  
Page 65 of 179 
the entry criteria for participation in this trial as broad and generalizable as possible.  We will 
condu ct secondary post-hoc analyses of various clinical and biolo gical factors that might 
typically be excluded (eg. concomitant antipsychotic treatment, Fragile X) instead.  This 
approach will provide the  greatest amount of clinically relevant information regarding sustained 
oxytocin tr eatment in short est amount of time  possible. 
We also will  allow p sychotropic m edications with strong  evidence of efficacy for treating 
problem b ehaviors or  psychiatric  disord ers frequently associ ated with A SD (specifically 
antipsychotics, anticonvulsants, st imulants, and o ther medications approved for  ADHD) to 
increase generalizability.  Agents that influence seroton ergic neurotransmission or sp ecifically 
impair reward pathways in the b rain (eg. naltrexone) will be excluded b ecause they lack 
evidence supp orting  their use in ASD and are likely to interfere with neu ral systems a ffected by 
oxytocin.  
We chose not to require  a minimal baseline score on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist –social 
withdr awal sub scale (ABC-SW, Aman 1994)  due to con cerns this w ould exclude m any people 
with A SD, even thou gh such a threshold would i ncrease comparability with an ongoing trial also 
targeting ASD ’s core social behaviors and m ight increase the p robability of observing A BC-SW 
changes.  Also, d iagnosis  of ASD requires significantly impaired reciprocal social beh avior. 
We are includi ng very young children because we believe they are likely to demonstr ate 
significantly greater functional improv ements  than old er children are as a result of increased 
intervention services and greater brain plasticity.  We believe that the careful titration schedule 
and close adverse effect monitoring  (phone  calls at Month 0.5 and 6.5, along with a dosi ng 
administration handout that staff will provide to particip ants from Baseline (Month 0) t o Month  
11 to monitor progress between office visits) will  provide su fficient s afety for this vuln erable 
population.  Further, the prospective, system atically elicited information about safety in young 
children gained in th is study will inform the design of future  trials and off label use in  young 
children. 
We are includi ng children with low cognitive functioning  because th ere is no rationale for 
believing that th ey would be  less l ikely to respond  to oxytocin tr eatment.  Such children are 
seldom  includ ed in clin ical trials and d esperately need effective treatments to reduce their 
suffering.  We expect that we will still be able to me asure social reciprocity which will be 
valuable  in studying the effects of o xytocin on children with autism of v arying cognitive 
functioning. 
We will exclude subj ects with no n-English spe aking caretakers because our staff is not qualifi ed 
(i.e. they are not flu ent in other  languages) to explain the stu dy to non -English speaking subjects. 
In addition, many of the pencil and paper assess ments u sed to d iagnose the includ ed diagnoses 
have not be en normed with no n-English spe aking populations. Thus, the measures may not be as 
appropriate, valid, and/or  reliable for non-English spe aking subjects. 
4.4 Strategies for Recruitment and  Retention 
Before the stu dy is initiated, it will be approved by the Institutional Review  Board (IRB) at each 
treatment site and the Network  DSM B.  All of the  subjects and their  parent/guardian will  provide 
consent/assent for participation in this study.  In addition to the in formed consent requirements,  
Page 66 of 179 
per the Privacy Rule  (HIPAA) regulations, research particip ants will  provide a written 
“authori zation” to use  their Protected Health Information (P HI) in connection wi th research.  In 
requesting an authori zation from po tential participants, investigators will  specify how the 
information wi ll be us ed and how the  privacy of that information wi ll be p rotected.  The 
researcher obtaining Informed Consent will  thorou ghly review the  consent form wi th the child and 
his or h er parents, including study procedures and potential risks a nd benefits of stu dy 
particip ation. The child and parents will  be encouraged to ask q uestions th roughout the process. It 
will be emphasized that research is volun tary and that the subje ct can opt  out of this proj ect at any 
time without jeopardizing his/her treatment.  Particip ants who tu rn 18 du ring their p articip ation in 
the study and who h ave the cognitive capacity to read and understand the consent form, and whose 
parents do not have  legal guardianship of th em, whi le participating in this study will  be re-
approached by one of the  physician inv estigators.  The  investigator will continue the info rmed 
consent process acknowl edging that the individual is now le gally an adult and will  ask the 
particip ant if they voluntarily wish to continue their particip ation in the study.  If he/she do es, the 
particip ant wi ll be asked to si gn the in formed consent docum ent and  a new HIPAA authori zation. 
If the individual do es not wish to continue particip ation they will be withdr aw 
from s tudy treatment just as any other  individual  who choos es to withdr aw consent from 
particip ation. 
This stu dy will be registered in ClinicalTrials.gov no la ter than 21 d ays after the first subje ct is 
enrolled. Summary results info rmation (in cluding adverse events) will  be reported no lat er than 1 
year after the completion date for the stu dy. Grant and progress report forms sh all include  a 
certification that t he investi gators h ave made  all required submis sions to ClinicalTrials.gov. 
4.5 Treatment Assig nment Procedures 
4.5.1  Randomization Procedures 
We expect to screen ~ 4 00 children in ord er to randomize 300. Individuals who m eet all inclusion 
criteria and no ne of the  exclusion criteria, will  be categorized by the data base according to the 
following  criteria to d etermine  if they belong in the high or low  functioning str atum.   Using  a 
centralized, random ization scheme with permut ed blocks  of 4 or 6,  str atified only by functional 
status, the database will randomly assign the t reatment which will be communicated to the site  
investi gational pharmacy.  Enrollment with in the  two str ata will be mon itored to ensu re that there 
are at least 142 p articipants in each and that at le ast 21% of  the p articip ants with in each stratum 
fall into each of the specified age groups 3-6, 7-11, 12 -17. The m inimal representation of these 
age groups should  ensure  that the pot ential mode rating effects of age can be fully assessed. We 
will not stratify by age due to the potential for very small cell sizes with large numbe rs of st rata. 
If a functional or age subgroup appears to be  under represented after 50%,  75% and 90%  of 
particip ants are random ized, recruitm ent efforts will  be focused on the un der represented 
subgroups.   Chi ldren will be consid ered low-functioning if they have significant language 
impairment and intelle ctual disability (NV IQ or Mullen Early Learning  Composi te Standard 
Score < 70). We define significant language impairment in particip ants 72  months or old er, as 
having a  lack of fluent phrase speech reflected by use of ADOS Module  1 or 2.  In particip ants 
younger than 6 years, signifi cant language impairment will  be defined as lack of phrase speech 
Page 67 of 179 
and Mullen receptive language subtest score more  than 1 SD b elow the m ean for  age. 
Particip ants w ill be consid ered as high-functioning if they have nonv erbal IQ ≥ 70 and si gnificant 
language skills, which we define as fluent phr ase speech reflected by use of ADOS Module  3 or 
4, or, if younger than 6 years, Mull en receptive language subtest score within 1 SD of the m ean 
for age or higher.  Particip ants who fail to meet both the l anguage and cognitive 
criteria for low- or high-functioning  will be stratified according to their language abilities, which 
more  strongly predict lo ng-term outcome  (Venter 1992; Szatmari 2003; Sallows 2005; Billstedt  
2007 ). 
4.5.2  Masking Procedures 
The spray and a norm al saline nasal solution (the  placebo) will be packaged in indistinguishable 
nasal administration bot tles.   There will  be four possible bott les:  Low concentration 
oxytocin/p lacebo with  yellow labels and High concentration oxytocin/p lacebo with b lue labels 
5 STUDY INTER VENTI ON/IN VESTIGATIONAL PROD UCT 
5.1 Study Product Description 
Oxytocin  contains the  synthesi zed peptide oxytocin in a solution fo rmulated to p romote 
absorption through the nasal mucosa. There will be two concentrations of  spray 80IU and 
240IU. The concentration of  80 IU of oxytocin/ 1ml and each 0.1 ml  nasal insulfation delivers 8 
IU of oxytocin. The  concentration of  240 IU of oxytocin/1ml and each 0.1  ml nasal insulf ation 
delivers 24  IU of oxytocin. 
5.1.1  Acquisition 
Oxytocin  and pla cebo w ill be compounded by Triangle Compound ing Pharmacy in Cary, NC 
with full adherence to GMP stand ards. All the p roper document ation regarding  these 
compounded solutions will  be submi tted to the FDA as an amendm ent to the current IND 
(#111604) held by Dr. Linmarie Sikich for sustained intranasal oxytocin t reatment in 3-17 year 
olds wi th autism. 
5.2 Dosag e, Preparation a nd Administration of Study Intervention/Investiga tional 
Product 
Particip ants or their  caregivers will be taught to administer the nasal spray, alternating nostrils, by 
the stu dy personn el. The caregivers will  be provided with sug gestions for how to encourage their  
children to comp ly with the procedure including setting  up a fun routine and providing rewards. 
The caregivers will also be p rovided with a dosing  handout to mon itor subje cts’ w eekly dosing  to 
ensure that p articipants are reaching their optimal dos e. The  study staff will fill in the d ates at 
each vis it and the  dosing  (if applicable). 
Particip ants in the  study will be random ly assigned to treatment wi th intranasal oxytocin or 
placebo. E ach insuf flation will  deliver 8 IU or 24 IU of oxytocin. A m aximum of 3  insuf flations 
at a time will be required. Dosing  will be flexible between 8 IU/day and 80  IU/day, typically in 
Page 68 of 179 
two divided doses delivered in the morning and in the afternoon. Doses will increase by 8 
ID twice daily (BID) every 15 days until achieving the target dose of 24 ID BID at Month 1. 
Subsequently doses may be increased in 8 ID BID increments every month until a maximum 
dose of 40 ID BID is achieved. Doses may be reduced by 8/0 ID BID if safety concerns emerge 
or if the study physician, caregiver or participant feels a lower dose was more beneficial. Once 
daily dosing will be pe1mitted for pa1ticipants who do not tolerate 8 ID BID. Similar titration 
will be used during open-label treatment. Adherence to treatment will be assessed by caregiver 
repo1t and weighing returned treatment bottles. See table 3.

5.3 Accountability Procedures for the Study Intervention/lnvestigational Product(s) 
Subjects ( or there parent /LAR) will be asked to return all previously dispensed product at the 
next office visit. Staff will return all unused product to the site's investigational phannacy for 
destruction. 
5.4 Assessment of Subject Compliance with Study Intervention/lnvest igational Product 
Due to the difficulties of measuring compliance with weight, we will utilize a parent completed 
diary to measure subject compliance with medication ti·eatment. Each daily dose morning and 
afternoon, will be recorded by the parent/caregiver on this diaiy. 
5.5 Concomitant Medications/Treatments 
All concomitant medications will be recorded. CmTent medications will be defined as any 
medications taken in the last month or being taken presently. The physician will record any 
changes to the subjects' psychiatric and non-psychiati-ic medications from baseline throughout the 
course of the study. Subjects who are cunently being treated with an agent that affects brain 
serotonin levels, including St. John's Wo1t will be excluded. If a paiticipant takes one of these 
agents during the course of the study, he she will be withdrawn by the investigator.

7 STUDY PROCED URES/EVALUATIONS 
7.1 Study Ass essments 
Parent Assessments 
 Questionnaire  Guidan ce Form: This fo rm wi ll give parents guidance on time frames and
specific instru ctions for  how to complete the  questionnaires. This form was created by study
staff with guidan ce from manu als from the stand ardized forms listed below.
 Social Opportunit ies Questionnair e: This U NC created form asks parents to rate how
frequently their child has the oppo rtunity to interact with different individuals in the
community, home, s chool and d aycare/after-school sett ing. It also asks, of those
oppo rtunities that th eir child has, do es their child actually utilze those oppo rtunities to
interact with ind ividuals in a  social manner.
Page 80 of 179 
 Social Reciprocity  Scale-2: This 65 -item rating scale measures the s everity of autism
spectrum symptoms as t hey occur in natural social  settin gs (Const antino et al. 2003). Comp leted
by a parent or teacher in just  15 to 20 minutes, the S RS provides a clear picture of a child's social
impairments, ass essing social awareness, so cial info rmation  processing, capacity for reciprocal
social communication, so cial anxiety/avoidan ce, and autistic preoccupations and traits. It is
appropriate for use  with childr en from 4 to 18 years of age.
The SRS measures impairment on a qu antitative scale across a  wide range of severity--which is
consistent with r ecent research ind icating that autism is best conceptualiz ed as a sp ectrum
condition rather than an all-or-nothing diagnosis. The SRS-R will  take the p arent/caregiver/LAR
approximately 10 m inutes to complete.
 Pervasive  Developm ental Disorders B ehavior In ventory  (PDDBI- Full and  PDDBI-
Screening V ersion) - The PDD-BI examines both adaptive and mal adaptive behaviors related to
autism.  It has no rmative scores for children between 2 and 11  years.  For children 12
years and ol der, the  norms (11  years, 11 months)  will be used.  This should take the caregiver
approximately 10 m inutes to c omplete. The screening version is a  much sh orter 18 item
questionnaire.
 Aberrant Be havior Checklist (ABC)-The ABC focuses on p roblem b ehaviors in five
subdom ains: irritability, attention, repetitive behaviors, unusu al speech, and social
withdr awal.  This shou ld take  the caregiver approximately 10 m inutes to c omplete.
 Caregi ver Stra in Qu estionnaire (CSQ – Berument): The  CSQ will assess family stress and
was developed for  caregivers of children with de velopmental dis abilities.  This shou ld take the
caregiver approximately 5 minutes to c omplete.
 Medication Diar y: Caregivers will  be asked to record each dose given to t he child on a
written lo g. Caregivers will be asked to return this  at each vis it for the stu dy team to review  if
there are any medication compliance issues.
 Parent Handout  (Risks): Caregivers will  be given an info rmational  handout  at baseline
(beginning of Random ized Phase) and again at m onth 6 (b eginning of Open Label Phase). This
handout will  describe possible symptoms to look fo r.
 Dosing Guid e/Medicati on Administration Form:  Caregivers will  be given an info rmational
handout that describes study drug administration and dosing guidelines. P articip ants will  be
instructed to inc rease the dose per the titration schedule as long as there are no p roblems and will
be stron gly encourag ed to cont act the study coordinator  if there are any concerns.
 Vineland S cales of Adapt ive Functioning  (2nd edition, su rvey form):  T he VABS-II is a
survey administered to a  parent or caregiver using a semi-structured interview format, and is
organized around  four Behavior Domains: Com munication, D aily Living Skills, Socialization,
and Motor  Skills. The VABS-II will take the p arent/caregiver/LAR approximately 20-60
(average 30) minut es to compl ete, depending on the subject’s age and lev el of functioning.
 Childhood An xiety Sensitivity Index (CASI): This scale is des igned for measuring anxiety
sensitivity (i.e., the b elief that anxiety symptoms have negative consequences
Physicia n/Clinician  Assessments 
 Clinical Global I mpressions Scal e:  Overall psychiatric functioning will be assess ed with the
severity (CGI-S) and improvement (CGI-I) subs cales of  the C GI (Guy 1976).   C GI-S items
are rated from 1 (norm al, not ill) to 7 (very severely ill).  C GI-I items are rated from 1 (very
much improv ed) to 7 (v ery much worse).
Page 81 of 179 
Physical E xaminat ion:  A physical examination will  include  abdom inal palp ation to ass ess for

motor actions.
Concomitant M edication Log: At s creening, the p hysician will  make  a list of any psychiatric
medi cations the  subject has tak en in the past and  are currently taking.  Cur rent medications will
be defined as any medi cations taken in the last month or b eing taken presently.  The
physician will record any changes to the subjects’ psychiatric and no n-psychiatric
medi cations f rom bas eline throu ghout the course  of the study.
Inclusion/E xclusion: A checklist will  be completed to ensu re all inclusion and none  of the
exclusion criteria are met.

periods and verify continued use  of two forms of birth control (if  sexually active).
 Vital  Signs:  Vital  signs will be measured at each visit and will include  heart rate, sitting blood
pressure, and temp erature.
Stanford Binet  (5th  edition): The Stanford-Binet intelligence scale is a standardized test that
assess es intelligence and cognitive abilities in children and adults aged two to 85+ years. The
Stanford-Binet Scale tests intelligence across four areas: verbal reasonin g, quantitative reasoning,
abstract/visual  reasoning, and short-term memory. The areas are covered by 15 subtests, includin g
vocabulary, comprehension, verbal absurdit ies, pattern analysis, matri ces, paper folding  and
cutting, copying, quantitative, number  series, equation building, memo ry for sentences, memo ry for
digits, memo ry for objects, and bead memo ry. The abbreviated IQ (ABIQ) will be used for th is
study and includ es non verbal fluid re asoning and verbal knowledge subtests.
Mullen Early  Scales of Learning  (Mullen): Is for birth to 68 months and is designed to assess five
scales: Gross Moto r, Visu al Reception, Fine Moto r, Expressive Language, and Receptive
Language
Autism Diagnost ic Observation Schedule-2 (ADOS-2): The ADOS is a semi-structured
assessment us ed to assess and  diagnose individuals suspe cted of  having autism of v arying
ages, developmental levels, and la nguage skills (from no sp eech to ve rbally fluent ).  The
ADOS includes four  modules, each requiri ng just 35 to 40 minutes to adm inister. The
individual being evaluated is given just one  modu le, depending on his or her  expressive
language level and chronological age.   The  rater will observe social and  communication
behaviors du ring various activities in the  appropriate module.
Page 82 of 179 
Autism Diagnost ic Interview, R evised (ADI-R): The ADI-R is a semi-structured, investig ator-
based interview for caregive rs of children and adults for  whom autism or p ervasive d evelopmental
disorders is a possible di agnosis. The revised int erview has been reorganized, short ened, mod ified
to be  appropriate for children with mental ages from a bout 18  months into adulthood and linked to
ICD-10 and DS M-IV criteria. The detailed inte rview focuses on early development in social and
communication and self-help skills of the child, and tak es approximately 2 hou rs to administer.
Demographi cs: Information su ch as age, race, ethnicity, family status and income will be
collected.

8 ASSESSMENTS  OF SAFETY  
8.1 Adve rse Events 
ICH E6  defines an AE  as any untoward medical occurrence in a p atient or clinical investigation 
subject admin istered a pharmaceutical produ ct regardless of its c ausal relationship to the study 
treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unin tended sign (including an abnorm al 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease tempor ally associ ated with the use of medicin al 
(investigational) product.  The occurrence of an AE may come to the attention of stu dy personn el 
Page 84 of 179 
during  study visits and int erviews of  a study subject presenting for medical care, or upon review 
by a study monitor. 
All AEs including  local and systemic  reactions not  meeting the criteria for “serious adverse 
events” will  be captured on the appropriate sour ce document aiton.  Information to be collected 
includ es event de scription, t ime of  onset, clin ician’s assessment of  severity, relationship to stu dy 
product (assessed only by those with the t raining and authori ty to make a diagnosis, which would 
include MD, D DS, DM D, PA, Nurse Practitioner or DO), and time of resolution/stabilization of 
the event.  All AEs o ccurring while on stu dy must  be document ed appropriately regardless of 
relationship.  All AEs will  be followed to ad equate resolution. A ny medi cal condit ion that is 
present at the ti me that t he subj ect is screened will  be consid ered as baseline and not r eported as 
an AE.  Ho wever, if it worsens at any time du ring the stu dy, it will be recorded as an AE. 
All AEs must  be graded for severity and relationship to stu dy product. 
Severity of  Event:  All AEs will  be assess ed by the clinician using a  protocol de fined grading 
system.  For events not included in the p rotocol defined grading system, t he following guidelines 
will be used to quanti fy intensi ty. 
 Mild: events require minimal or no tr eatment and  do not interfere with the subject’s daily
activities.
 Moderate: events result in a low l evel of in convenience or concern with the th erapeutic
measures.  Mod erate events may cause some  interference with functioning.
 Severe: events interrupt a subj ect’s usual d aily activity and m ay require systemic  drug
therapy or oth er treatment.  Severe events are usually incapacitating.
Changes in the severity of an AE  will be documented to allow an assessm ent of th e duration of the
event at each level of intensity to be performed.  Adverse events characterized as intermittent
require  document ation of  onset and du ration of  each episod e.
Relatio nship to Study Treatment: The clinician’s assessment of  an AE's relations hip to test 
article  (study drug) is part of the  document ation process, but  it is not a factor in d etermining wh at 
is or is  not reported in the study.  If there is any doubt as to wh ether a clinical obse rvation is an 
AE, the  event will  be reported.  All AEs  must  have their relationship to st udy product assessed 
using  the terms: asso ciated or  not asso ciated.  In a clinical trial, the stu dy product must alw ays be 
suspe ct.  To h elp ass ess, the following guidelines  are used. 
 Certain: The adverse event and administration of the study drug are related in time, and a direct
association can be demonstrated.
 Probably: The adverse event and administration of the study drug are reasonably related in time,
and the adverse event is more likely explained by the study drug than other causes
 Possible: The adverse event and administration of the study drug are reasonably related in time,
and the adverse event can be explained equally well by causes other than study drug.
 Unrelated: The adverse event is clearly explained by another cause not related to the study drug.
8.2 Serious Adv erse Events 
Serious Adv erse Event (SAE):  An SAE is de fined as an AE  that m eets one of  the following 
conditions:  
 Death duri ng the p eriod of proto col-defined surv eillance
 Life-threatening event (defined as a subject at immedi ate risk of d eath at the ti me of the
event)
Page 85 of 179 
 An event requiring inpatient hospi talization or  prolongation of  existing hospitalization du ring
the p eriod of  proto col defined su rveillance
 Results in con genital anomaly or birth defect
 Results in a p ersistent or si gnificant disability/incapacity
 Any other import ant medical event that may not result in de ath, be life  threatenin g, or require
hospitali zation, m ay be consid ered a serious adverse experience when, based upon appropriate
medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subje ct and m ay require  medical or surgical
intervention to pr event one of the outcomes listed above.  Examples of su ch medi cal events
include allergic bronchospasm requiring  intensive treatment in an emergency room or  at home,
blood dyscrasias or  convulsions that do not  result in inpatient hospitali zation, or  the d evelopment
of drug dependency or drug abuse.
All SAEs will be:
 recorded on the appropriate SAE C RF
 follow ed thro ugh resolution by a study clinician
 reviewed and evaluated by a study clinician.”
8.3 Unanticipated Problems 
We will consid er unanticipated problems involv ing risks to subj ects or oth ers to includ e, in 
general, any incid ent, experience, or outcome  that meets all of the following  criteria: 
 unexpected (in terms of  nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research pr ocedures that
are described in the protocol-related documents, such as the IRB-approved research protocol and
informed consent docum ent; and (b) the characteristics of  the subje ct population being stud ied;
 related or possibly related to pa rticipation in the research (in the  guidance document, poss ibly
related means th ere is a reasonable possib ility that the in cident, experience, or outcome  may have
been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and
 suggests that the research places sub jects or ot hers at a greater risk of harm (including
physical, psychological, econom ic, or so cial harm) than was previous ly known or
recognized.
8.4 Reporting Pro cedures: Serious Adv erse Events 
Any AE consid ered serious by the PI or Subinv estigator or  which me ets the aforementioned 
criteria must be  submi tted on an SAE form to the  Coor dinating Center and the ind ependent 
medi cal monitor on the following  numbe rs:

Medi cal Moni tor Phone: 416-753-6005  
Medi cal Moni tor Fax: 416753-6046  
The study clinician will  complete a Serious Adv erse Event Form within the following  timelines:  
Page 86 of 179 
 All de aths and immedi ately life-threatening events, wh ether related or unrelated, will  be
recorded on the Se rious Adverse Event Form and sent by fax within 24 h ours of site
awareness.
 Serious adverse events o ther than death and im mediately life-threatening events, r egardless
of relationship, wi ll be reported by fax within 72 hou rs of si te awareness.
Other suppo rting documentation of the  event may be requested and should  be provided as soon 
as possib le. 
All SAEs will be followed unt il sati sfactory resolution or  until the PI or Subinv estigator deems 
the event to be chronic  or the p atient to be stable.  
8.5 Stopping Procedures 
Subjects may be withdr awn for any of the following reasons:  
 at the particip ant or guardian request
 if mod erate or severe adverse events oc cur that cannot be addressed by dose adjustment
or addition of concomitant medications
 clinical worsening (much worse or very much worse on C GI-I) at two consecutive visits
unless explicitly discuss ed and agreed with SC and Medi cal Moni tor that particip ant can continue
in the study.
 study noncompliance
 study physician disc retion
8.6 Safety Ov ersight 
8.6.1 I ndependent Medical Mon itor 
Evdokia Anagnostou, MD has a wealth of experience in pedi atric oxytocin adm inistration as she 
has condu cted m any of her own trials. She will serve as the inde pendent medical monitor for this 
study. She will review  alarm values of  labs and ECGs (to be d efined by the medi cal monitor and 
the site PIs) and serious adverse events with in 6 wo rking days of their reporting and who will 
review  all new tre atment em ergent ad verse effects of mode rate or greater severity three times a 
year prior to  DSMB  meetings.  She will be available to DSMB  and to ste ering committee to 
discuss concerns about safety related to the 2 above activities. 
8.6.2 Da ta Safety Monitoring Board (DSM B) 
The UNC TRACS  Data and Safety Monitori ng Board (DSMB) will monitor data from all sites. 
The principle role of the DSMB  is to mon itor the  data from clinical trials to protect the safety of 
the research particip ants.  To achieve  this, the DSMB will: a) establish a quarterly meeting 
schedule; b) review  proposed protocols  for safety and validity; c) evaluate recruitm ent and rate of 
enrollment in r elation  to the projected activity; d) monitor the  occurrence of adverse events, 
serious adverse events, and early withdr awals or termin ations th roughout the course  of the study; 
e)review with a designated research staff mem ber the p attern of  the stu dy data; and f)  evaluate
study outcom es, when available. It will be reviewed by the DSMB 3 times/ year.

9 CLINIC AL MONITORING  
9.1 Site Monitoring Plan 
Site monitoring  will be condu cted to ensure  that the human subje ct prot ection, stu dy procedures, 
laboratory, study intervent ion administration, and data collection processes are of high quality 
and me et the sponsor,  ICH E6  and, wh en appropriate, regulatory guideline s.  This s ection will 
give a general description of how site  monitoring will  be condu cted.  The data moni tor will be 
housed  at the Data Center at UNC Chapel Hill. The Data/Regulato ry Moni tor will monitor the 
database, with the data manager, in order to assess quality assurance and control issues, and will 
generate queries from the database. This individual will also moni tor each site ’s regulato ry 
documents for  completeness and accuracy (delegation of duti es logs, 1572s,  FDFs, general 
correspon dence, IRB correspond ence, labo ratory values etc).  He/she will travel to each site at 
least once  per year in Years 1 and 5 and separately twice per site  each year for Years 2, 3 and 4 in 
order to monitor the  study coordinators and the  case report forms to ensure that d ata are collected 
completely and accurately.  He/she will ensure  that qu eries are resolved.  He/she will also ensu re 
that data is properly and accurately entered into the d atabase. 
10 STATI STICAL CONS IDER ATIONS  
Dr. Hamer and Dr. Johnson will  condu ct and h ave ultimate respons ibility for all data analysis 
described below.  All s tatistical comput ing will be done  using  the most  recent ve rsion of SAS. D r. 
Johnson will do most of the  programming and perform most of the analyses, but Drs. Johnson and 
Hamer will be jointly respons ible for all results.  The  analyses described below will be  performed 
on the int ent-to-treat population.  Additional exploratory analyses may be performed on t he per 
protocol population or k ey subsets of  the sample (e.g. those p articip ants 
without  fluent ph rase speech).  All data  will be explored using  descriptive  statistics and  graphical 
techniques prior  to any hypothesis testing.  For categorical variables, we will examine frequency 
distributions and wh ere appropriate contingency tables and histo grams.  For continuous  
variables, we will examine frequency distributions and, where appropriate, box-and-whisk er plots.  
When appropriate, we will consid er transformation.  If necessary due to distribu tional 
consid erations, we  will cautiously consid er a change of analysis method to  a less p arametric one. 
10.1 Statistical Ana lysis 
General Modeli ng: Unless otherwise specified,  we will fit a mixed lon gitudinal model with 
change from b aseline to each pos t-baseline month for  a response v ariable, functioning  (low v ersus 
high) as the st ratification variable, center as a blocking f actor, treatment (oxytocin ve rsus pla cebo) 
as the b etween-subjects factor, month as a within-subjects factor, th eir int eraction, and baseline as 
a covariate.  We will choose  between two kinds of mod els:  (1) a random c oefficients model 
treating month continuous ly with r andom  coefficients for the int ercept, slope, and slope squa red, 
and  an unstru ctured covariance matrix among  them, and (2) an mixed model with r epeated 
measures (MMRM) t reating month categorically and examining unstru ctured, To eplitz, AR(1 ), 
and compound symmetric covariance structures amo ng months.  We will choose  among these  
candida te models using an information criterion (AIC) while remaining  blind to the 
Page 88 of 179 
significance of the treatm ent effe ct to avoid bias in  the choice  of mo del.  Distributional 
assumptions will be examined using  residuals.  These mixed models could f ail to conv erge or 
encounter  difficulties based on their  use of asymptotics.  If they do, we  will attempt to simplify 
the mod els in order to eliminate the  problems, and if necessary, move to analyses that assume 
compound symmetry, but use a  Huynh-Feldt correction if compound symmetry fails. 
Missing Da ta: The mixed models used to evaluate the continuous r espon se variables are able to 
handle mod erate amoun ts of missing  data provided they are missing at random.  We will examine 
the missing  at random assump tion by assessing baseline differences between dropouts and 
completers, as well as differences in response  variables up to the  point  of prematu re withdr awal.  
If the missing  at random as sump tion does not app ear to be tenable, we will report the mi xed 
models r esults but sp end additional effort characterizing treatment effect at time of p rematu re 
withdr awal. 
10.2 Sample Size Consi derations 
We will use a  mixed longitudinal model for our primary analyses (see Statistical Analyses 
below).  Since some  aspects of the mod el such as covariance structure are unknown, we 
performed pow er and sample size calculations us ing a more conservative, simplified model 
correspondi ng to a tw o-group t-test on change scores.  We plan to  analyze two co-primary 
outcome  measures: the ABC-SW, whi ch will  provide consisten cy with p ivotal tri als of other 
medi cations hypothesized to improve  ASD so cial symptoms, and the combined so cial score, 
which integrates ABC-SW symptoms with the new Pe rvasive Developmental Disord ers 
Behavior Inventory-Screening Version SOCDEF r aw score (PDDBI-SV, Cohen 2011, also see 
Outcome M easures) in o rder to fully capture the range of imp airments in reciprocal social 
behaviors obs erved in ASD.  We will use an alpha of  0.025 to co rrect for two co-primary 
outcom es. SOARS-B is pow ered for Aim 1b to allow ind ependent evaluation of  oxytocin 
efficacy in low and high-functioning  youth.  
Standard deviations of change scores for the ABC-SW range from ~5 to 9  in several large ASD 
intervention trials (Shea 2004; McCr acken 2002; Ow en 2009; M arcus 2009, King  2009; Am an 
2009 ).  We consider a between groups dif ference of 5-7 poin ts in A BC-SW change scores to be 
clinically meaningful.  In our  power calculations, we  use conservative estimates of  9 poin ts for the 
SD of  ABC-SW change and 5 poin ts for between group differences in ABC-SW changes 
(differential improv ement on ~1/3 of i tems).  To achieve  80% power with an alpha of  0.025 on the 
ABC-SW, we will require  71 participants in each treatment  group within the two str ata. Thus, our 
total required sample for the ABC-SW in Aim  1b is 284.  We examined change in the combined 
social score in 30 3-17 year olds with ASD, 20 t reated with aripiprazole and 10 medi cation-free 
controls.  The m ean baseline v alue was 33.5 (17.2 SD)  and the change overall was -10.7 (SD 
13.0), with a SD of change in each group of 11.9.  Within e ach treatment group, changes in the 
combined social score paralleled those  in the ABC-SW and PDDBI-SV, but h ad less v ariability 
(Sikich, personal data).  We  consider a between groups dif ference in the 
combined social me asure changes of 1 0-12 to be clinically meaningful.  Conservative estimates 
using  a SD of 15 and a between groups dif ference of 10  in the combined social score changes 
results in a l arger effect size for the combined social measure than for  the ABC-SW. 
Conse quently, we should h ave at least 80% pow er.  A s ample size of 300 will allow for 5% 
attrition b etween random ization and the first pos t-random ization visi t.  Aims 1a,  3 and 4 consid er

analyses depends on the  distribution of  particip ant ch aracteristics and variability in methylation 
and m RNA expression obs erved, whi ch can’t be estimated reliably at this time. 
11 SUBJ ECT CON FIDENTIALITY  
In order to p rotect con fidentiality, only random ly assigned ID numb ers rather than names will 
appear on clinically sensitive charts, files, and digital data. The key linking the num eric identifi er 
and particip ant’s identi ty will be maintain ed on a  separate drive  that is do uble p asswo rd 
protected and to wh ich only the site  PI and coordinator have access.  Contact information wi ll be 
recorded separately in double p asswo rd protected files with restricted access as above.  The code 
linking  the n ames with the ID numb ers will be securely protected with limited access. M edical 
records will be kept con fidential with access granted only to those medi cal and research 
professionals directly involved with the  study. If any scientific paper based on the d ata collected 
for this study is publ ished,  no info rmation that could be linked to any single particip ant wi ll be 
reported. Con fidentiali ty will be protected to the fullest extent p ermitted by law.  All r esearch 
personn el have completed HIPPA training for researchers and human ethics training. 
The samples for the methylation po rtion of  the st udy (which will  be sent to  Simon G regory’s team 
at Duk e) will be single-coded, that is, la beled with a single specific co de that do es not carry any 
personal identifiers.  Single coding is the current s tandard us ed in clin ical research and offers 
additional s afeguards to the subje ct’s identifi ers compa red to the HIPAA authori zation. With this 
method it  is po ssible to t race the samples back to a given subj ect with the use  of the  single 
coding  key.  The  clinical study investig ator is r esponsible for maintaining  the coding key. This 
coding  key will be stored separately from the research data. When sto red electronically, it will be 
passwo rd protected as it will contain identi fying information. The  samples  will also note the  date 
of collection and visit  numbe r.

PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  Study of Oxytocin in Autism to improve Reciprocal Socia l 
Behaviors  
Synopsis:  This Phase 2 study will evaluate oxytocin as a supplemental 
treatment for improving social difficulties in individuals with 
autism.  
Objectives:  We will randomly assign 300 individuals between the ages of 3 -
17 years old with an auti sm spectrum disorder to 24 weeks of 
treatment with oxytocin or a matched placebo across six sites in 
the United States. Subsequently all participants will receive 
open -label oxytocin for 24 additional weeks.  Post -treatment 
assessments will be done ~4 week s after treatment stops.  We 
will also determine OXTR methylation status at baseline, 8 
weeks, 24 weeks and 36 weeks to explore potential relationships 
between OXTR  methylation and baseline severity of social 
problems and/or treatment response.  
Population : 300 subjects, male or female, ages 3 -17 with an autism spectrum 
disorder  
Phase:  2

1 INTRODUCTION: BACK GROUND INFORMATION A ND SCIENTIFIC RATION ALE  
1.1 Background Information  
There is a tremendous unmet need for access ible treatments that address core symptoms of ASD and are 
safe for sustained use, especially for the population of nonverbal individuals who require the most 
intensive lifelong support.  We have created the ACE SOARS Network to provide the infrastructure 
necessary to meet this need on an ongoing basis.  Our initial clinical trial, described in this application, 
is SOARS -B (the Study of Oxytocin in A SD to improve Reciprocal Social Behaviors).  SOARS -B will 
test a very promising potential treatment−intranasal oxytocin−for ASD’s fundamental social 
communication deficits in a large, highly generalizable group of verbal and nonverbal children.  
SOARS -B will also provide information about the regulation of DNA met hylation and transcription of 
the oxytocin receptor gene ( OXTR ), as well as other genes relevant to oxytocin’s CNS activity, as a 
function of time and in response to oxytocin treatment. These data will fill a key gap in our 
understanding of oxytocin’s role  in ASD and its ability to alter epigenetic modifications of OXTR .  
 1.2 Rationale  
THE SOCIAL MOTIVATION MODEL OF ASD  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY  
 Difficulties in social orienting are evident across auditory and visual modalities and across the 
lifespan in ASD (Dawson, Meltzoff et al. 1998 ; Dawson, Webb et al. 2004 ; Sasson, Tu rner-Brown et al. 
2008 ; Whitehouse and Bishop 2008 ).  Electrophysiologic studies have found that individuals with ASD 
can attend to social stimuli if instructed to do so, but that they do not do so  spontaneously (Ceponiene, 
Lepisto et al. 2003 ).  In contrast, typically developing individuals give preferential attention to social 
stimuli, processing them f aster with greater brain activation in prefrontal cortex than nonsocial stimuli 
(Goren 1975 ; Greene, Colich et al. 2011 ).  Youth with ASD show slower processing of social versus 
nonsocial stimuli and the rate inversely correlates with the magnitude of social impairments (Dawson, 
Webb et al. 2004 ).  Individuals with ASD als o appear to experience reduced relative rewards from 
interpersonal interactions.  In contrast to their typically developing peers, children with ASD prefer 
looking at pictures of inanimate objects to looking at pictures of people (Sasson, Turner -Brown et al. 
2008 ; Sasson, Elison et al. 2011 )   They also fail to activate the ventral striatum, which is the center of 
the brain’s reward circuit, in response to social rewards whereas high levels of activation are evoked by 
social rewards in typically developing children (Scott -Van Zeeland, Dapretto et al. 2010 ).  Further, when 
presented with social stimuli, children with ASD show reduced  rather than increased activity in the 
prefrontal cortex, which assesses the relative value of a reward (Greene, Colich et al. 2011 ).  The extent 
of reduction correlates with the severity of social and communication impairments i n children with ASD 
(Dawson, Meltzoff et al. 1998 ; Ohnishi, Matsuda et al. 2000 ).  These differences, as well as ASD’s 
clinical presentation, have led to the hypothesis that ASD is related to a fundamental impairment in 
social motivation (Waterhouse, Fein et al. 1996 ; Dawson, Carver et al. 2002 ; Grelotti, Gauthier et al. 
2002 ; Dawson, Webb et al. 2005 ).   
THE ROLE O F OXYTOCIN IN SOCIAL BEHAVIOR  
 Oxytocin is the brain’s most abundant neuropeptide.  It can act as a classical neurotransmitter, a 
neuromodulator and a hormone with actions throughout the body (Gimpl and Fahrenholz 2001 ; 
Baskerville and Douglas 2010 ; Veening, de Jong et al. 2010 ).  Oxytocin’s half -life in the p lasma is 1 -2 
minutes compared to ~30 minutes in the CSF.  Central release of oxytocin is dependent upon CD38 and 
dramatically stimulates further release of oxytocin (~1000 fold) and increases the number of oxytocin -
containing cells in the periventricular n ucleus.  Together these factors lead to long lasting oxytocin 
Page 107 of 179
elevations throughout the brain following acute increases in CSF oxytocin.  One of oxytocin’s major 
central actions is to activate the brain’s reward circuit by increasing dopamine release from the ventral 
tegmental area to the ventral striatum, amygdala and hippocampus.  Its neuromodulatory actions appear 
to result primarily from somatodendritic release with binding to oxytocin receptors that are widely 
distributed throughout the limbic region a nd prefrontal cortex.  Differential species -specific patterns of 
social behavior appear related to the distribution and density of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors in 
the brain. Oxytocin can bind vasopressin receptors, although it is unknown to what it e xtent it does so 
normally.  Oxytocin also can increase expression of oxytocin and vasopressin receptors in the brain 
although these effects are often sexually dimorphic and highly regulated by hormones and interleukins 
(Moos, Poulain et al. 1989 ; Tribollet, Charpak et al. 1989 ; Miyan, Nabiyouni et al. 2003 ; Morris and 
Ludwig 2004 ; Bales, Plotsky et al. 2007 ; Bales, van Westerhuyzen et al. 2007 ; Carter 2007 ; Carter, 
Boone et al. 2009 ).  Social isolation and social stress somewhat later, during the post -weaning period, 
also have sexually dimorphic effects on the number of oxytocin and vasopressin neurons (Bales, Lewis -
Reese et al. 2007 ; Tanaka, Osako et al. 2010 ).   
  In animal m odels including primates, oxytocin has been demonstrated to increase eye contact, social 
approach, social recognition, social memory, and generosity and to reduce stress responses (Takayanagi, 
Yoshida et al. 2005 ; Liu, Lopatina et al. 2008 ; Insel 2010 ).  Oxytocin also influences social behavior in 
people (Macdonald and Macdonald 2010 ).  Exogenous oxytocin increases gaze to eye regions, social 
cognition, social memory, positive communication, empathy, perceptions of trustworthiness, and 
cooperation within one’s own group (Kosfeld, Heinrichs et al. 2005 ; Zak, Kurzban et al. 2005 ; Domes, 
Heinrichs et al. 2007 ; Zak, Stanton et al. 2007 ; Baumgartner, Heinrichs et al. 2008 ; Guastella, Mitchell 
et al. 2008 ; Petrovic, Kalisch et al. 2008 ; Savaskan, Ehrhardt et al. 2008 ; Unkelbach, Guastella et al. 
2008 ; Di Simplicio, Massey -Chase et al. 2009 ; Ditzen, Schaer et al. 2009 ; Keri, Kiss et al. 2009 ; 
Rimmele, Hediger et al. 2009 ; Theodoridou, Rowe et al. 2009 ; De Dreu, Greer et al. 2010 ; Fischer -
Shofty, Shamay -Tsoory et al. 2010 ; Guastella, Einfeld et al. 2010 ).  Intranasal oxytocin also  reduces 
cortisol; perceived stress, amygdala activation to threatening social images, and tolerance of ethnic 
differences (Heinrichs, Baumgartner et al. 2003 ; Kirsch, Esslinger et al. 2005 ; Petrovic, Kalisch et al. 
2008 ; De Dreu, Greer et al. 2010 ; De Dreu, Greer et al. 2011 ).  However, some of these effects, 
including enhancement of social memories and secure attachment, may be limited to individuals with 
less robust prosocial behaviors initially (Buchheim, Heinrichs et al. 2009 ; Bartz, Zaki et al. 2010 ; Bartz 
and P iantadosi 2010 ).  Allelic variations in OXTR  have also been correlated with infant attachment, 
social auditory processing, empathy and prosocial decision making (Lerer, Levi et al. 2010 ; Chen, Barth 
et al. 2011 ; Tops, van Ijzendoorn et al. 2011 ). 
OXYTOCIN ’S POTENTIAL ROLE IN ASD  
 Multiple variations in the oxytocin signaling system have been associated with ASD relative to 
controls.  Allelic variations in the CD38 gene, which is required for central release of oxytocin, and in 
OXTR have been identified, some of which also have been correlated with cognition and funct ioning in 
individuals with ASD (Green, Fein et al. 2001 ; Wu, Jia et al. 2005 ; Jacob, Brune et al. 2007 ; Yrigollen, 
Han et al. 2008 ; Andari, Duhamel et al. 2010 ; Lerer, Levi et al. 2010 ; Liu, Kawamura et al. 2010 ; 
Munesue, Yokoyama et al. 2010 ; Tansey, Brookes et al. 2010 ; Wermter, Kamp -Becker et al. 2010 ; 
Campbell, Datta et al. 2011 ; Riebold, Mankuta et al. 201 1).  Modestly greater (~ 20 -40%) OXTR  
methylation relative to controls has been found in two small, independent ASD samples (Gregory, 
Connelly et al. 2009 ).  Reduced plasma oxytocin and CD38 mRNA expression have also been reported 
in ASD (Modahl, Green et al. 1998 ; Jin, Liu  et al. 2007 ).  
 Oxytocin has shown promise for modifying social behavior in mouse models for ASD and in people 
with ASD and related disorders.  In the Otxr null mouse, a single dose of oxytocin improved social 
Page 108 of 179 
deficits, reduced aggression and reduced vulnerability to dmg-induced seizmes, apparently acting 
through the vasopressin IA receptor. Further, in these mice, repeated doses of oxytocin improved 
reversal learning, indicating enhanced cognitive flexibility (Sala, Braida et al. 2011) . A single dose of 
oxytocin also improved social deficits in Cd38 null mice (Higashida, Lopatina et al. 2010). In Fragile 
X, which is frequently comorbid with ASD, oxytocin improved gaze avoidance and reduced co1iisol 
elevations elicited by social interaction (Hall, Lightbody et al. 2012). In high functioning individuals 
with ASD, single doses of oxytocin enhanced attention to faces and eyes, visual and audito1y affect 
recognition, the ability to distinguish whether others were being cooperative , and preference for 
interacting with receptive individuals (Hollander, Baiiz et al. 2007; Andari, Duhamel et al. 2010; 
Guastella, Einfeld et al 2010). Oxytocin challenge also reduced self-repo1ied compulsive and repetitive 
behaviors(Hollander , Phillips et al. 2003). Sustained oxytocin treatment has been repo1ied to improve 
ASD symptoms in one child (Munesue, Yokoyama et al 2010)). In the only pilot study of sustained 
oxytocin treatment cmTently completed, affect recognition accmacy improved three times as much with 
6 weeks of oxytocin treatment as had been repo1ied in Andai·i's single dose study (Anagoustou in 
prepai·ation, network preliminaiy data). An 8-week blinded study of oxytocin in 24 children with ASD 
has been completed at UNC.

role in social orienting and social motivation, and vai·iability in vai·ious aspects of oxytocin signaling 
among people with ASD, together with extensive preliminaiy evidence that supplemental oxytocin can 
impact social behaviors in ASD, have led to the fo1mulation of om working model (Figme 1). We 
postulate that ASD pathophysiology acts to fundamentally alter social orienting and decrease the relative 
value ascribed to social rewai·ds resulting in limited social motivation. Reduced social motivation leads 
to a vicious cycle of reduced social opportunities, reduced leaining from social feedback, reduced skills 
and functional abilities and worsening of ASD's core social communication symptoms, which farther 
reduces social motivation. We hypothesize that sustained intranasal oxytocin treatment will positively 
modify the earliest pa1is of this cycle -social orienting and the value of social rewai·ds -and dismpt the 
cycle leading to improvements in the core social and communication impaiiments of ASD.

1.3 Potential Risks  
There is limited information about the safety of sustained use of oxytocin, althoug h more information is 
emerging on a daily basis. Indeed, the objective of specific Aim 2 is to provide such information, 
gathered prospectively in a systematically elicited fashion.  
Oxytocin has been reported to exert a large number of effects in the body  and the brain (Gimpl & 
Fahrenholz 2001). The classic physiological effects of oxytocin in humans as well as all placental 
mammals are uterine contractions and milk ejection.  These are conclusively known to occur only under 
the hormonal conditions at the end of pregnancy and postpartum when oxytocin receptors proliferate in 
the uterus and mammary tissue and lactogenesis occurs.  Theoretically, oxytocin administration could 
cause uterine contractions during phases of the menstrual cycle when estrogen levels  are relatively high 
or in women who are receiving estrogen.  This, however, has never been demonstrated or reported. IV 
administration of Oxytocin is FDA approved for induction or facilitation of labor and postpartum 
contraction of the uterus. Intranasal oxytocin spray is also available in other countries to facilitate 
nursing in new mothers.  Intranasal oxytocin also was FDA approved as a lactation aid in the United 
States until 1995 when it was withdrawn from the US market by the company that manufacture d it, 
Novartis.  This was a business decision and the FDA has confirmed no safety concerns were involved in 
this decision.   
A number of adverse effects have been reported in the context of these two clinical applications, 
primarily with intravenous admini stration of oxytocin, which include anaphylactic reaction, 
hypertension, hypotension, cardiac arrhythmias, nausea and vomiting, afibrinogenemia and associated 
bleeding and, in the context of prolonged intravenous administration of oxytocin, hyponatremia. T here 
has also been at least one report of life -threatening anaphylaxis during surgery when multiple drugs 
were being intravenously infused simultaneously (D. Pant, et al, 2009).  Symptoms that may result from 
anaphylaxis include generalized hives, itchines s, or flushing; crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, and 
vomiting; a feeling of anxiety and impending doom; swelling of the lips, tongue, throat resulting in 
shortness of breath, wheezes or stridor, and low oxygen; a drop in blood pressure that may result in a  
feeling of lightheadedness and loss of consciousness; reduced muscle tone with possible loss of bladder 
control; and, most seriously, coronary artery spasm may occur with subsequent myocardial infarction or 
cardiac dysrhythmia and possible death.  There i s also a case report of psychosis occurring during 
oxytocin treatment of a man with obsessive compulsive disorder (Ansseau, Legros et al. 1987 ), although 
there are two completed pilot studies in schizophrenia that have reported reduction of psychotic 
symptoms (Feifel, Macdonald et al. 2010 ) – using a TDD of 40 IU during week 1, followed by a TDD of 
80 IU for 2 weeks in 16 people; (Peder sen, Gibson et al. 2011 ) using TDD 48 IU for 2 weeks in 7 
people) with no significant adverse events. There are a limited number of published, sustained oxytocin 
treatment studies in adults with other diseases (Denboer and Westenberg 1992 ) (Epperson, McDougle et 
al. 1996 ; Epperson, McDougle et al . 1996 )(Den Boer 1992, Epperson 1996a, Epperson 1996b, none of 
which report significant adverse effects.  
Page 110 of 179
Evidence for safety of sustained intranasal oxytocin treatment in ASD  
Placebo controlled safety data of sustained intranasal oxytocin treatment in people with ASD is available 
from one adult study (Anagnostou, Soorya et al. 2012 ) and two  currently unpublished trials: the 
Anagnostou adult study (10 on TDD 48 IU oxytocin for 6 week s, 9 on placebo), a trial conducted by 
Adam Guastella, personal communication 2012 (26 teens on total daily dose [TDD] 24 IU oxytocin for 
8 weeks, 24 on placebo), and the UNC Autism Speaks pilot trial in 3 -17 year olds (12 on oxytocin with 
TDD ranging betw een 4 IU and 64 IU for 8 weeks and 13 on placebo) and 24 on open label oxytocin 
TDD up to 48 IU for 8 weeks.  
Adverse events observed during the double blind and open -label phases of the UNC oxytocin pilot study 
are shown in Table 1.  Pink shading indicat es events that were numerically more common in the 
oxytocin group than the placebo group.  Green shading indicates events that were numerically more 
common in the placebo group.  We also have been able to access the raw adverse event data from the 
two non UNC trials and have aggregated it to provide adverse event data on 48 individuals with ASD 
exposed to oxytocin for at least 6 weeks and 46 individuals with ASD treated with placebo.  This 
aggregation, shown in Table 2, found low rates of adverse events in both oxytocin and placebo groups 
and no signal for greater adverse events with oxytocin treatment.  None of these studies identified any 
significant or systematic changes in electrolytes or vital signs.  The apparently higher rates in the UNC 
Pilot study p robably reflect differences in the methods of assessing adverse events.  The UNC pilot 
study used systematic elicitation of adverse events (same instrument as proposed for SOARS -B trial) 
and the other studies used spontaneous report or much more limited qu estionnaires.

There is also preliminaiy safety data regai·ding even more extended oxytocin treatment for up to 6 
months in children with ASD available by personal communication from an ongoing trial funded by 
the US Depai·tment of Defense being conducted by Evdokia Anagnostou in 11 youth 10-17 years 
treated for up to 6 months treated with oxytocin. There have been no significant lab abno1malities in 
these paiiicipants. Three (14%) have shown increases in initability or mood lability and one has had 
increased allergy symptoms. 
Blood Draw Risks: 
During laboratory blood draws the risks involved ai·e pain, brnising, and rai·ely, infection at the 
location where the blood was taken. This risk will be minimized by having a trained professional 
take each pa1iicipant's blood. We will attempt to avoid these risks by using aseptic techniques, and 
applying pressure after the phlebotomy. A local anesthetic may be used to reduce associated pain if 
Page 112 of 179
the participant wishes to use it. If a subject becomes nervous or agitated abou t the phlebotomy 
procedures, we will utilize an anti -anxiety medication to calm subjects who may be nervous.  
Psychological/Psychiatric Risk:  
This patient population can be at risk for worsening of psychiatric/psychological symptoms that may 
be attributed  to their mental  illness alone, medication non -adherence, or a number of other causes 
that may not be related to this study.   The Principal Investigator will use clinical judgment to assess 
each treatment emergent adverse event and determine intensity and relatedness to the study.   In cases 
of worsening of  symptoms patients may require inpatient hospitalization.  If the study doctor feels 
that the subject is at serious risk for hurting themselves or others, he/she can ask a judge to allow the 
participant to  be hospitalized against his/her will.  Subjects may become frustrated during study 
procedures.  Research staff will work to ensure that all directions and questions are easy to 
understand for subjects who have intellectual difficulties.  Subjects will be a llowed breaks, if 
needed.   
Since this is a large trial of oxytocin that will require patient involvement for up to 52 weeks (1 
year), it is suggested that a subject’s psychiatric care will be assumed by the study physician. 
However, this can be determine d by site as some institutions have different regulations surrounding 
psychiatric care and research participation.  
Confidentiality Risk  
The potential indirect risks are related to loss of confidentiality and could include someone such as 
an insurance agen cy or employer learning that the participant has a serious mental illness with 
resulting potential stigmatization.  It is also possible that public knowledge of this diagnosis or its 
documentation in the medical record could lead to inability to obtain ins urance coverage at 
reasonable rates in the future.  
Additional risk for biomarker/genetics portion: 
There are no additional needle sticks for this portion of the study. However, t he additive in the DNA 
collection tube can be irritating if it contacts the  skin so special care will be taken so that, during the 
blood draw, the additive in the tube doesn’t flow out into the collection needle.  
2 OBJECTIVES  
The ACE SOARS Network’s immediate goals are to translate these exciting findings regarding 
oxytocin’s n eurobehavioral effects into an evidence -based, widely accessible intervention for ASD’s 
fundamental impairments in reciprocal social behaviors and to identify factors that differentially 
influence response to oxytocin treatment in ASD.  Our central hypothe sis is that intranasal oxytocin 
will partially reverse the early pathophysiologic alterations in social orienting and the salience of social 
rewards present in ASD, which lead to decreased social motivation and ultimately to ASD’s core social 
communication  impairments, thereby enhancing reciprocal social behaviors (see Figure 1, in Impact 
section ).  Sustained improvements in social motivation and social reciprocity are expected to facilitate 
communication and learning and ultimately improve functioning.  We  will accomplish our immediate 
goals by conducting SOARS -B, a large (n=300) randomized, double -blind trial of sustained (24 week 
treatment with intranasal oxytocin in children 3 -17 years old with ASD and examining clinical and 
biological factors that may p redict or enhance response.  Regardless of SOARS -B’s outcome, its 
results will significantly impact the care of people with ASD by definitively testing a very promising 
Page 113 of 179
translational treatment strategy in a highly generalizable sample.  The moderator analy sis is likely to 
support treatment personalization.  The exploratory epigenetic studies will enhance understanding of 
the regulation of key biological pathways in ASD and facilitate development of future treatments.  
2.1 Specific Aims  
Specific Aim 1 : Dete rmine the efficacy of intranasal oxytocin treatment in children with ASD.    
Analysis 1a:  Compare oxytocin treatment to placebo for improving reciprocal social behaviors.   
Hypothesis:   oxytocin will reduce maladaptive social behaviors and increase prosocia l behaviors.  
Analysis 1b:  Compare oxytocin treatment to placebo for improving reciprocal social behaviors 
separately in subgroups of children who have significant language impairment and intellectual 
disability and those whose language and intellectual ab ilities are in the normal range at baseline.   
Hypothesis:  oxytocin’s actions on the social reward system are unrelated to verbal or cognitive 
abilities.  
Analysis 1c:  Compare the treatments’ enhancement of social motivation, cognitive skills and 
functioni ng. Hypothesis: oxytocin will increase social motivation, improving acquisition of cognitive 
and functional skills.  
Specific Aim 2:  Provide information about the safety and tolerability of intranasal oxytocin .  
Analysis 2a:  Compare incidence and severity o f treatment emergent adverse effects, clinically 
significant laboratory and electrocardiogram changes, serious adverse events and treatment 
discontinuation due to tolerability issues over 24 weeks in the oxytocin and placebo groups.  
Analysis 2b:  Tabulate these safety indicators during 24 weeks of open oxytocin treatment  
Specific Aim 3 : Identify clinical or biological traits that preferentially influence response to 
oxytocin.  
Analysis 3a:   Determine if baseline age influences behavioral changes more in the  oxytocin group.  
Hypothesis: the magnitude of changes observed depends on both intervention efficacy and brain 
plasticity.  
Analysis 3b:  Determine if baseline OXTR  methylation levels predict level of behavioral improvement.  
Working hypothesis : greater OXTR  methylation decreases oxytocin receptor density and increases the 
amount of oxytocin required to bind available receptors and elicit optimal reciprocal social behaviors. 
Analysis 3c:  Determine if other baseline traits or intervening experiences interact preferentially with 
oxytocin  
Exploratory Aim 4: Describe the changes in OXTR  methylation and mRNA expression of genes 
related to oxytocin signaling occurring over 24 weeks with oxytocin and placebo treatment.   
Rationale: understanding the regulation of o xytocin signaling will facilitate development of novel 
treatments.  
2.2 Study Outcome Measures  
2.2.1  Primary Outcome Measures  
Our primary outcome  is reciprocal social behaviors, which we will assess using two co -primary 
measures.  The first measure is th e ABC -SW subscale, which is being used in other clinical trials 
focusing on the core social and communication symptoms of autism.  The other measure is the 
Page 114 of 179
Sociability Factor (SF), a combined measure derived from 13 items of the ABC -SW, which 
primarily cap tures aloof, and avoidant behaviors, and the Pervasive Developmental Disorders 
Behavior Inventory -Screening Version (PDDBI -SV, Cohen 2011), a recently developed measure 
which assesses both maladaptive social problems and social skills. The PDDBI -SV is comp rised of 
18 items included in the older, more comprehensive Pervasive Developmental Disorders Behavior 
Inventory (PDD -BI, Cohen 2003). The PDDBI -SV assesses both social impairments typically 
associated with the active but odd subtype of ASD and development  of pro -social skills that are 
integral to improved reciprocal social behavior.  The PDDBI -SV results in a raw SOCDEF score, 
which is the sum of the reverse -scored social skills and the regularly -scored problems, and a 
SOCDEF T score.  In marked contrast t o the PDD -BI’s age -based standard scores (for children 1.5 
and 12.5 years old), the PDDBI -SV SOCDEF score does not change with age in individuals with 
ASD.  The PDDBI -SV has been validated in original PDD -BI development sample of 311 children 
1-17 years ol d and a recently -acquired sample that includes 145 youth between 13 and 15 years old,
90 between 16 and 19 years, and 59 between 20 and 40 years (Cohen 2011, personal
communication).  The sociability factor SF will be calculated by discarding the three let hargy items
from the ABC -SW (questions 3, 32, and 53, which all assess reduced physical movement), summing
the 13 remaining items of the ABC -SW subscale, and adding it to the PDDBI -SV raw SOCDEF
score.  The sociability factor SF is derived from two well -validated instruments and has face validity
for capturing the full range of impairments in reciprocal social behaviors observed in ASD.  We
chose not to use the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), which was developed to provide a
quantitative measure of socia l impairments typically observed in ASD in children 3 -18 years old,
because it has been demonstrated to be quite stable over time (Constantino, Przybeck et al. 2000 ;
Constantino 2009 ) and no intervention studies have clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to change.
2.2.2  Secondary Outcome Measures  
Secondary Outcome Measures:  We will use the SRS Social M otivation subscale to assess 
oxytocin’s hypothesized mechanism of action.  Cognitive skills will be assessed using the Stanford 
Binet -5th Edition (SB -5) (Roid 2003 ).  If a child cannot complete the routing tests on the SB -5, they 
will be assessed using the Mullen. Functional skills including communication will be assessed using 
the standard score of the Vineland 2 adaptive be havior composite and all its subscales, the Caregiver 
Strain Questionnaire total and subscale scores (Brannan, Heflinger et al. 1997 ) and, in verbally 
fluent youth, a 7 item questionnaire being piloted to assess participant satisfaction with their social 
relationships, which is included in the appendix. The specific components o f these measures tested 
in Aim 1c are SRS Social Motivation subscale, the NV IQ or Mullen Early Learning Composite 
standard score, and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Composite.  Other subscales of the ABC, 
Caregiver Strain Questionnaire and SRS measures wi ll be analyzed in an exploratory way.  
2.2.3  Additional Exploratory Outcome Measures  
Additional Clinical Assessments:  In order to provide a comprehensive assessment of the clinical 
features of children in the trial we will also perform several other asse ssments.  The Clinical Global 
Impressions – Improvement (CGI -I) score, which is routinely used in pharmacologic clinical trials, 
will capture the study physician’s global impression of response. We will also incorporate a 
continuous visual analog scale of change in three key areas of overall functioning (similar basis for 
assessment as CGI -I), social communicative functioning, and repetitive behaviors and restricted 
Page 115 of 179 
interests that is rated with reference to the individual participant’s baseline characterist ics.  We will 
also incorporate the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Task (Baron -Cohen, Wheelwright et al. 2001 ) 
into our analysis, which has been shown to be sensitive to both single and sustained doses of 
oxytocin (Domes, Heinrichs et al. 2007 ). However, its use is restricted to high -functioning 
individuals who can verbally identify specific emotions. We will also obtain the other SRS -2 
subscales to specifically assess its sensitivity to change in comparison to other outcomes. All 
concomitant medications and behavioral or alter native medication therapies will be recorded at each 
visit.  Assessment of treatment -emergent adverse effects will utilize the systematic longitudinal 
adverse effects scale developed by Sikich and described in the oxytocin treatment section. We will 
also d etermine the reason for premature discontinuation of treatment and physician, caregiver 
judgment regarding the child’s treatment group.  
Biologic Outcome Measures :  We will obtain blood, urine and vital signs from participants at 
regular intervals in order  to assess the safety of oxytocin.  In addition, we obtain blood from 
participants at screening and weeks 8, 24 and 36 that will used to assess oxytocin levels, OTXR  
methylation status and to assess mRNA expression.  We will obtain saliva at the same time points to 
perform salivary oxytocin levels.  We will also determine whole blood serotonin at screening, weeks 
8 and 24.  
Potential interacting factors :  We will assess potential environmental factors that may interact with 
oxytocin treatment through caregi ver reports.  We are particularly interested in social skills 
treatments, interventions the child receives outside of the school setting and social opportunities 
outside of school settings for interactions with peers, adults who are not caregivers/treatmen t 
providers, and caregivers/treatment providers.  We will also examine potential interactions between 
antipsychotic treatment, stimulant treatment, -adrenergic treatment and oxytocin treatment.  
3 Study Design  
SOARS -B is a large (n =300) randomized, pla cebo -controlled trial of sustained (24 week), flexible 
dose intranasal oxytocin treatment in children 3 to 17 years old with ASD.  The primary aim is to 
determine the efficacy of oxytocin for improving reciprocal social behaviors in the entire sample and 
the low - and high -functioning subgroups.  Social motivation, cognitive skills and functional 
behaviors will be secondary outcomes.  We will examine safety during the double -blind phase and 
the 24 week open extension phase.  The second major aim of the study  is to identify whether 
participant baseline clinical and biological characteristics such as age and extent of OXTR 
methylation preferentially influence response to supplemental oxytocin.  In post -hoc exploratory 
analyses, we will examine the influence of intervening processes, such as concomitant antipsychotic 
or social skills treatments that are likely to be randomly distributed between the oxytocin and 
placebo groups, on oxytocin response.  Finally, participants will be assessed approximately 4 weeks 
after the last dose of oxytocin (~week 53 -55)to assess safety and follow up on any 
unresolved/continuing adverse events. The target dose will be 48/0 IU total daily dose (TDD), which 
will typically be achieved by week 8 during the blinded phase and week 28  i n the open label phase 
according to a recommended titration schedule.  However, doses will be flexible with slowing of the 
titration, alteration of the dosing administration times, reduction of dose and increases beyond the 
target dose (after 7 weeks of ta rget dose treatment) allowed according to specific guidelines.

4.3 Rationale for Inclusi on and Exclusion Criteria  
Frequently when large trials are done with a very specific subpopulation, no further studies are done 
to explore response in other subgroups because of the large cost of such trials and public frustration 
with studies perceived a s duplicative and incremental.  However, families and clinicians caring for 
individuals from untested subgroups often struggle to make treatment decisions without any specific 
evidence regarding efficacy or safety.  Therefore, we have made the entry criter ia for participation in 
this trial as broad and generalizable as possible.  We will conduct secondary post -hoc analyses of 
various clinical and biological factors that might typically be excluded (eg. concomitant 
antipsychotic treatment, Fragile X) instead .  This approach will provide the greatest amount of 
clinically relevant information regarding sustained oxytocin treatment in shortest amount of time 
possible.   
We also will allow psychotropic medications with strong evidence of efficacy for treating pr oblem 
behaviors or psychiatric disorders frequently associated with ASD (specifically antipsychotics, 
anticonvulsants, stimulants, and other medications approved for ADHD) to increase generalizability.  
We will allow agents that influence serotonergic neur otransmission or specifically impair reward 
pathways in the brain (eg. naltrexone) in order to make the study results more generalizable to the 
actual autism population, ensure a diverse sample and increase recruitment. While there is minimal 
evidence to s upport efficacy in ASD symptoms, the truth is that community practitioners are 
prescribing these agents to children and adolescents with ASD.   
We chose not to require a minimal baseline score on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist –social 
withdrawal subscale (ABC -SW,(Aman, Singh et al. 1985 )) due to concerns this would exclude many 
people with ASD, even though such a threshold would increase comparability with an ongoing trial 
also targeting ASD’s core social behaviors and might increase the probability of observing ABC -SW 
changes.  Also, diagnosis of ASD requires significantly impaired reciprocal social behavior.    
We are including very young children because we believe they are l ikely to demonstrate 
significantly greater functional improvements than older children are as a result of increased 
intervention services and greater brain plasticity.  We believe that the careful titration schedule and 
close adverse effect monitoring, alo ng with a dosing administration handout that staff will provide to 
participants) will provide sufficient safety for this vulnerable population.  Further, the prospective, 
systematically elicited information about safety in young children gained in this stu dy will inform 
the design of future trials and off label use in young children.   
We are including children with low cognitive functioning because there is no rationale for believing 
that they would be less likely to respond to oxytocin treatment.  Such c hildren are seldom included 
in clinical trials and desperately need effective treatments to reduce their suffering.  We expect that 
we will still be able to measure social reciprocity which will be valuable in studying the effects of 
oxytocin on children w ith autism of varying cognitive functioning.  
Page 118 of 179
We will exclude subjects with non -English speaking caretakers because our staff is not qualified (i.e. 
they are not fluent in other languages) to explain the study to non -English speaking subjects. In 
addition,  many of the pencil and paper assessments used to diagnose the included diagnoses have not 
been normed with non -English speaking populations. Thus, the measures may not be as appropriate, 
valid, and/or reliable for non -English speaking subjects.  
We are ex cluding children who are deaf and blind because part of the outcome measures are child 
rated (ie: reading in the mind’s eye and self -rating of social functioning). Children who are blind 
and/or deaf would not have reliable testing for these measures and th erefore invalidate that data 
during analysis. If it is unclear if a subject is blind or deaf, we will refer them to an external provider 
for further testing prior to enrolling the subject.  
We will exclude individuals who have uncontrolled seizures (ie: s eizure activity within the past 6 
months prior to baseline or screening). This is an added safety measure to ensure that any individuals 
with seizures have them properly under control prior to randomization.  
4.4 Strategies for Recruitment and Retention  
Before the study is initiated, it will be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at each 
treatment site and the Network DSMB.  All of the subjects and their parent/guardian will provide 
consent/assent for participation in this study.  In addition  to the informed consent requirements, per 
the Privacy Rule (HIPAA) regulations, research participants will provide a written “authorization” to 
use their Protected Health Information (PHI) in connection with research.  In requesting an 
authorization from potential participants, investigators will specify how the information will be used 
and how the privacy of that information will be protected.  The researcher obtaining Informed 
Consent will thoroughly review the consent form with the child and his or her parents, including 
study procedures and potential risks and benefits of study participation.  The child and parents will 
be encouraged to ask questions throughout the process. It will be emphasized that research is 
voluntary and that the subject can opt ou t of this project at any time without jeopardizing his/her 
treatment.  Participants who turn 18 during their participation in the study and who have the 
cognitive capacity to read and understand the consent form, and whose parents do not have legal 
guardia nship of them, while participating in this study will be re -approached by one of the physician 
investigators.  The investigator will continue the informed consent process acknowledging that the 
individual is now legally an adult and will ask the participan t if they voluntarily wish to continue 
their participation in the study.  If he/she does, the participant will be asked to sign the informed 
consent document and a new HIPAA authorization. If the individual does not wish to continue 
participation they will  be withdrawn from study treatment just as any other individual who chooses 
to withdraw consent from participation.  
This study will be registered in ClinicalTrials.gov no later than 21 days after the first subject is 
enrolled. Summary results information (including adverse events) will be reported no later than 1 
year after the completion date for the study. Grant and progress report forms shall include a 
certification that the investigators have made all required submissions to ClinicalTrials.gov.

4.5 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
4.5.1  Randomization Procedures  
We expect to screen ~ 400 children in order to randomize 300. Individuals, who meet all inclusion 
criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, will be categorized by the data base according to the 
following criteria to determine if they belong in the high or low functioning stratum.   Using a 
centralized, randomization scheme with permuted blocks of 4 or 6,  stratified by functional status, 
the database will randomly assign the treatment which w ill be communicated to the site 
investigational pharmacy.  Enrollment within the two strata will be monitored to ensure that there are 
at least 142 participants in each. Randomization will be further stratified by age so that at least 21% 
of the participan ts within each stratum fall into each of the specified age groups 3 -6, 7-11, 12 -17. 
The minimal representation of these age groups should ensure that the potential moderating effects 
of age can be fully assessed. We will not stratify by age due to the pote ntial for very small cell sizes 
with large numbers of strata.  
 If a functional or age subgroup appears to be under represented after 50%, 75% and 90% of 
participants are randomized, recruitment efforts will be focused on the under -represented subgroups.   
Children will be considered low -functioning if they have significant language impairment and 
intellectual disability (NV IQ or Mullen Early Learning Composite Standard Score < 70).  We define 
significant language impairment in participants 72 months or o lder, as having a lack of fluent phrase 
speech reflected by use of ADOS Module 1 or 2.  In participants 5 years, 8 months or younger, 
significant language impairment will be defined as lack of phrase speech and Mullen receptive 
language subtest score more than 1 SD below the mean for age.  Participants will be considered as 
high-functioning if they have nonverbal IQ ≥ 70 and significant language skills, which we define as 
fluent phrase speech reflected by use of ADOS Module 3 or 4, or, if 5 years, 8 months or younger, 
Mullen receptive language subtest score within 1 SD of the mean for age or higher.  Participants who 
fail to meet both the language and cognitive criteria for low - or high -functioning will be stratified 
according to their language abilities, wh ich more strongly predict long -term outcome (Venter, Lord 
et al. 1992 ; Szatmari, Bryson et al. 2003 ; Billstedt, Gillberg et al. 2005 ; Sallows and Graupner 
2005 ).   
Randomization Method: We will randomize centrally, using our data management system.  The 
UNC Data Team is familiar with this process as they have done this in our multicenter IMPACT 
trial.  When a site needs to randomize a subject, after baseline is assessed, the coordinator opens the 
Randomization form.  This form uses already assessed strata to randomize from the appropriate 
stratum.  We will not stratify by site.  We felt that both functional status and age group were more 
likely to be related to the outcome than site, and there are limits to how many strata we can have.  
We will stratify by functional status (high or low) and age group (3 age groups), producing 6 strata.  
The unblinded statistician will generate a randomization plan for each of the 6 strata, using a 
permuted block algorithm with randomly selected block sizes of 2 and 4, using  SAS.  The table will 
be exported to an Excel file and sent to the data manager.  This can be done without having the lead 
statistician ever actually see the randomization plan.  (He/ she will debug the program and when 
debugged, run it with a new seed for the random number generator without seeing the results.)  The 
database manager will import the randomization plan as a table in Access.  The Randomization form 
Page 120 of 179 
will use Visual Basic code and the values of the strata variables to enter the correct subset of  the 
table and choose the first unused treatment.  It will generate an ID number and send an email to the 
appropriate pharmacy, where drug will be assigned.  
4.5.2  Masking Procedures  
The spray and a matched placebo solution containing all of the same ingr edients except for oxytocin 
will be packaged in indistinguishable nasal administration bottles.    
5 STUDY INTERVENTION/INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
5.1 Study Product Description  
Oxytocin contains the synthesized peptide oxytocin in a solution formulated to promote absorption 
through the nasal mucosa.   
5.1.1  Acquisition  
All the proper documentation regarding how the drug and placebo is compounded/manufactured will 
be submitted to the FDA as an amendment to the current IND (#111604) held by Dr. Linmarie 
Sikich for sustained intranasal oxytocin treatment in 3 -17 year olds with autism.  
5.2 Dosage, Preparation and Administration of Study Intervention/Investigational Product  
Participants in the study will be randomly assigned to treatment with intranasal oxyto cin or placebo . 
Participants or their caregivers will be taught to administer the nasal spray, alternating nostrils, by 
the study personnel. The caregivers will be provided with suggestions for how to encourage their 
children to comply with the procedure i ncluding setting up a fun routine and providing rewards. The 
caregivers will also be provided with a dosing handout to monitor subjects’ weekly dosing to ensure 
that participants are reaching their optimal dose. The study staff will fill in the dates at ea ch visit and 
the dosing (if applicable).  The target dose for the study is 48/0 IU total daily dose (TDD).  The 
target dose will begin at the week 8/28 visit, unless issues with tolerance or compliance slow the 
recommended titration schedule.  Every effort will be made to achieve the target dose of 48/0 IU 
TDD  unless it is clear that the child cannot tolerate it. 
5.2.1 Flexible Dose: 
In the blinded phase,  dosing will be flexible between 8/0 IU TDD and, after the target dose (48 IU 
TDD) has been maintaine d for ~ 7 -8 weeks, up to 80/0 IU TDD, to allow one to optimize dosing for 
the individual child in cases of intolerance or inadequate response.  Doses will typically be given in 
two equal amounts in the AM and the PM, with the maximal dose at any one time b eing 48/0 IU.  If 
doses are uneven the larger dose should be given in the AM. 
In the open label phase, dosing will be flexible between 24 IU TDD and, after the target dose (48 IU 
TDD) has been maintained for ~7 -8 weeks, the dose can be increased to 72 TDD  at week 36.  The 
Page 121 of 179
preferences is for24 IU TDD to be given in the AM, 48 IU TDD should be split equally between 
morning and PM dosing and 72 IU TDD should be split as 48 IU in the AM and 24 IU in the PM. 
Suggested Titration to the Target Dose 
Blinded Ph ase: In the double -blind phase, titration to the target dose is expected to take 8 weeks and 
follow the suggested table below unless there are issues with tolerance or compliance. Dosing will 
begin at 8/0 IU in the AM at baseline. Typically, the dose will increase to 8/0 IU twice daily (BID) 
(16/0 IU TDD) at week 2. Dose will then be increased by 8/0 IU twice  daily (BID) at weeks 4 and 8 
with TDDs of 32/0 IU and 48/0 IU respectively. During the initial titration period (baseline to week 
8), dosing increases  should never occur before the time point specified in the schedule. Specifically 
one could not go to a TDD of 16/0 IU prior to week 2, or 32/0 IU prior to week 4 or 48/0 IU prior to 
week 8.  
Open Label Phase:  In the open -label phase, from week 24 to week 28, the dose will be 24IU in AM 
for a TDD of 24 IU. From week 28 -36 the dose will be 48 IU TDD (ie. 24 IU BID). At week 36 the 
dose can b e increased to 72 IU TDD (ie. 48 IU in the morning and 24 IU in the afternoon). 
5.2.3 Dose Deviations from Titration Schedule 
Maintaining pre -target dose:  
In the blinded pha se (week 0 -24) If the child is having difficulty tolerating the medication or 
administration of the nasal spray during the initial dose titration phase, the clinician may 
choose to hold the dose at weeks 2, 4 or 8 rather than increasing per the titration s uggestions.  
If dose is held, it may then be increased by 8/0 IU 1 -2 x/day after assessment of the 
participant (phone/email or in person) between scheduled visits if desired in order to achieve 
the target dose of 24/0 IU twice daily or 48/0 IU total daily dose as close to the week 8 visit 
as possible. 
In the open -label phase if the child is having difficulty tolerating the medication, the clinician 
may choose to hold the dose at 24 IU qD at week 28, 32, 36, 40, or 44. 
Dosing Reductions:  All dosing reduct ions should be discussed with the site PI within 2 business 
days and reported to the lead site for discussion with other treatment site PIs.  
Mandatory Dose Reductions : The dose must be reduced to the highest previously well 
tolerated dose if any of the fo llowing criteria  are met AND the treating clinician is Week 0  Week 2  Week 4  Week 8

comfortable with the decrease. The dose may be reduced between appointments in the first 
two cases. 
Clinician judges an AE to require immediate reduction of dose OR  
CGI-I score is 6 or 7 OR  
Two consec utive CGI -I scores at in person visits are worse than the preceding two 
CGI-I scores.  
If any of the three criteria are met, but the treating clinician is not comfortable with the 
decrease, the dose will be maintained until discussed with the all treating s ite PIs. The 
majority of the treating site PIs may determine that a mandatory decrease should be made.  
Optional Dose Reductions:  
In the blinded phase the dose may be reduced by 8/0 IU once or twice a day at any time at the 
clinician’s discretion due to a clinically significant adverse event, poor tolerability of dosing, 
parent request.  The dose should not be subsequently increased without reassessing the 
participant by phone/email or in person. The dose can be increased between scheduled visits 
after cl inical reassessment of the participant (phone, email or in person).SLAES and CGI -I to 
be completed at physician discretion. If SLAES is not completed, then adverse events m ust 
be assessed and documented.  
In the open -label phase the dose may be reduced in 24 IU increments to a minimum dose of 
24 IU every other day. 
Dosing Increases Above Target Dose: 
In the blinded phase  after the target dose has been maintained for at least 7 weeks the dose 
may be increased by 16/0 IU TDD only at each of the subseque nt visits.  Thus, at week 16, 
the maximal possible dose will be 64/0 IU TDD.  However, at week 20 the dose could be 
increased to either 64/0 IU TDD if there had been no prior increase at week 16 or, could be 
increased to 80/0 IU TDD if the dose had been in creased at week 16. 
In the open -label phase  after the target dose has been maintained for ~ 7 -8 weeks then the 
dose can be increased (at week 36) to 72 IU TDD.  
Applies to both phases:  Increases past the target dose are NOT required and may ONLY be 
made  if the following conditions are met 
No evidence of clinically significant adverse events
Parents agree
Clinician agrees
5.2.4 Weaning Dose at Completion of Trial  
For 72 IU TD D at week 48 we would reduce dose to 24 IU BID for 1 week then 24 qAM and then  
24 IU every other day in the morning for a week then stop. 
Page 123  of 179
For 48 ID TDD at week 48 we would reduce to 24 ID eve1y morning for a week and then reduce to 
24 ID eve1y other day for 1 week then stop. 
For 24 ID TDD at week 48 we would reduce to 24 ID eve1y other day for 1 week then stop. 
For anything less than 24 ID TDD, no down titration is required 
For early te1minations, attempts should be made to follow down titration as listed above. It will not 
be considered a deviation if families are non-compliant. 
At week 53-55 a phone/email visit should be completed to review the SLAES. 
5.2.5 Interrupting Dosing 
Administration of oxytocin may be intenupted on rare occasions due to other clinical conditions that 
temporarily prevent nasal administration, poor compliance with administration directions, or 
significant adverse events or acute worsening of symptoms or functioning. The treating clinician 
may restart treatment at the same or a lower dose after assessment of the paiiicipant (including 
email/phone with paiiicipant's caregiver). The lead site should be info1med of intenupted dosing 
lasting more than 1 week.

5.3 Accountability Procedures for the Study Intervention/lnvestigational Product(s) 
Subjects ( or their pai·ent/LAR) will be asked to return all previously dispensed product at the next 
office visit. Staff will retmn all unused product to the site's investigational phannacy for destruction. 
Sites should make all attempts to collect investigational product after the final phone/email contact 
even though subjects will not be retmning to the clinic for an in person visit. 
5.4 Assessment of Subject Compliance with Study Intervention/lnvestigational Product 
Due to the difficulties of measming compliance with weight, we will utilize a parent completed dia1y 
to measme subject compliance with medication ti·eatment. Each daily dose morning and afternoon, 
will be recorded by the parent/cai·egiver on this diaiy. 
Page 124 of 179
5.5 Blinding/Un blinding  
Due to the short half -life of oxytocin (estimated 3 -15 minutes), and the lack of any treatment for 
overdose, unblinding will not be permitted in this study. The knowledge of treatment assignment 
will not alter the subject’s immediate management, so therefore unblinding is not deemed 
appropriate for this study. Instead, in the case of a medical emergency, unexpected serious adverse 
reaction or clinician judgment, the study medication may be interrupted. Study medication may be 
interrupted (temporar ily discontinued) at the discretion of any treating physician at a site at any time 
without prior approval from the site PI or Steering Committee (SC). In the case when the treatment 
is interrupted, the subject may be re -challenged if the case is discussed  and approved by the SC.   
5.6 Concomitant Medications/Treatments  
All concomitant medications will be recorded. PRNs will not be recorded unless: they are taken for a 
period of 2 weeks or more AND they are taken more than 57% of the time (ie: 9 out of 15  days) OR 
the clinician feels there is a compelling reason to document them. The physician will record any 
changes to the subjects’ psychiatric and non -psychiatric medications from baseline throughout the 
course of the study.

Procedures for visits are allowed to be completed on separate days , however , subjects may not be dispensed open label medication until all week 24 procedures are 
completed 
6.1 Screening 
NOTE: At any point in time, visits may be refe1Ted to as months or weeks. For the purposes of this 
protocol I month = 4 weeks (28 days). 
Screening Visit (can be divided into multiple visits, if necessaiy) ~ approximately 6 homs

completed)
DSM -5 Checklist
Subjects may return for multiple screening visits in cases where assessments could not be completed 
in one visit (i.e., time constraints, subject noncompliance, etc.).  
The first set of Genetics and Plasma Oxytocin samples will be drawn at the  Screening visit(s) in 
conjunction with safety labs to reduce the number of needle pricks during the study.  However, the 
subject may choose to wait to have these samples drawn until their Baseline visits once their 
eligibility has been confirmed.  If the samples have been collected and the subject is determined to 
be ineligible, the blood samples collected for these purposes will be destroyed. If there is more than 
12 months between screen and baseline then safety labs will have to be re -drawn to ensure sa fety of 
the participant.

PK Visits (Optional)  
In order to ass ess the PK (pharmacokinetic) properties of oxytocin, a select group of subjects who 
participate in the SOARS -B trial will be asked to participate in the PK study. Study staff will select 
the participants based on a) their willingness to participate and b) their ability to tolerate the study 
procedures.  A total of 18 subjects will be enrolled across all 6 sites for the week 32 samples. There 
will be 6 subjects in each of the following age groups: 3 -6, 7-12 and 13 -17 years old. Each site will 
be asked to en roll one subject from each of the age groups. There will be a separate consent form for 
this optional study.  
Target Dose PK sample (48 IU TDD)  
This visit may occur any time after week 32 (48 IU TDD)  
This visit can be completed at any visit after week 32 or at an unscheduled visit 
There will be a target of 6 participants in each age cohort total  
 if possible please also obtain vitals and PDDBI -SV and ABC. 
Procedures are as follows:  
IV placement by study staff (saline solution only)
Plasma oxytocin draw at T = 0 (time 0, immediately after insertion)
Administration of intranasal oxytocin (target dose = 24IU but will be whatever dose the
subject is currently prescribed to as part of the SOARS -B protocol)
Plasma oxytocin draw at T = 15 minutes
Plasma oxytoci n draw at T = 30 minutes
Plasma oxytocin draw at T = 45 minutes
Plasma oxytocin draw at T = 60 minutes
If feasible plasma oxytocin draw at T= 2 -7 hours post dose
Total blood volume = 42 mL (7mL per draw times 6 draws)
Max Open Label Dose PK sample (72 IU TDD)  
This visit may occur any time after the highest dose has been achieved (at an unscheduled visit or 
regularly scheduled visit)  
The target is to have 2 -6 participants receiving the 72 IU total dose, ( at all sites) regardless of age  
If this is not occu rring at a regularly scheduled visit, please also obtain vitals and PDDBI -SV and 
ABC.  
Procedures are as follows:  
IV placement by study staff (saline solution only)
Plasma oxytocin draw at T = 0 (time 0, immediately after insertion)
Page 136 of 179 
Administration of intra nasal oxytocin (target dose = 40IU BID)
Plasma oxytocin draw at T = 15 minutes
Plasma oxytocin draw at T = 30 minutes
Plasma oxytocin draw at T = 45 minutes
Plasma oxytocin draw at T = 60 minutes
If feasible plasma oxytocin draw at T= 2 -7 hours post dose
Total blood volume = 42 mL (7mL per draw times 6 draws)
Additional Risks for IV  
Most of the risks for IV insertion are the same as for venipuncture (bruising, pain, possible 
infection). Complications of gaining IV may include infiltration, hematoma, an ai r embolism, 
phlebitis, and intra -arterial injection. Infiltration is caused by the infusion of fluid outside the 
vesicles (vein), into the surrounding soft tissue.  This is generally caused by poor placement of a 
needle outside of the vessel lumen. Clinica lly, you will notice swelling of the soft tissue surrounding 
the IV, and the skin will feel cool, firm, and pale. IV fluids are not dangerous to the surrounding soft 
tissues however certain medications can be toxic. We will not be administering any medicat ions only 
IV fluids therefore this will not be an issue in our study. A hematoma occurs when there is leakage 
of blood from the vessel into the surrounding soft tissue. This can occur when an IV catheter passes 
through more than one wall of a vessel or if pressure is not applied to the IV site when the catheter is 
removed. A hematoma can be controlled with direct pressure and will resolve over the course of 2 
weeks. An air embolism occurs as a result of a large volume of air entering the patient's vein via the 
IV administration set. Air embolisms are rare and easily prevented by making sure that all the air 
bubbles are out of the IV tubing before placement. Phlebitis is inflammation of the vein which 
occurs due to the pH of the agent being administered durin g the administration of the IV, since we 
are not placing any medications into the IV we will not be at risk for this complication. An intra -
arterial injection occurs very rarely. This can easily be prevented, by making sure that the needle is 
inserted in a  vein. An experienced phlebotomist would not have an issue with the placement. If an 
artery is cannulated, there will be a pumping of bright red blood back into the angiocath, which 
would not be seen when you cannulate a vein. In the case of intraarterial injection, it is the 
intravenous drugs which pose severe problems, rather than the IV solution and since we will not be 
placing any drugs into the IV this will not be an issue for our study. In order to minimize these risks, 
we will ensure that all study s taff that place the IV are well trained in proper procedures and use 
aseptic procedures.  
6.5 Early Termination Visit  
If a subject terminates from the study early, then the following procedures should be completed as 
close as possible to the last dose. T hese procedures may be completed over the phone/email or in an 
office visit:  
SLAES
Page 137 of 179 
Suicidality assessment
CGI-I/S
Con Meds
Psychosocial/Social Skills Therapy Logs
Vitals (only if  in office)
Self-Rating of Social Functioning (only if in office)
RMET (only  if in office).
The questionnaires from the week 24 visit should be sent to the families and completed as close to 
the last dose taken as possible. If in open -label phase send week 48 questionnaires.  
Any subject who is not able to return to the clinic or  available for a phone call for an early 
termination visit within 2 weeks of their last dose will be considered lost to follow up no ET visit is 
required. All efforts should be made to retrieve the medication bottles from the families either 
mailed back or  in person.    
6.6 Unscheduled Visit or Re -Evaluation Visit  
Subjects may be asked to come in for an unscheduled visit at any time during the course of the study 
if the treating physician feels it is necessary to see the subject in person or to complete a  PK visit. 
Subjects will be instructed to contact the site between scheduled visits if there are any issues that 
need to be addressed.  
Subjects may also be re -evaluated with appropriate assessments completed for any of the following 
reasons:  
If the subjec t’s dose is mandatorily reduced, then these assessments should be completed 2 -4
weeks after the dose has been reduced.
If the subject has had a CGI -I score of 6 or 7, then the assessments should be completed two -
four weeks later at physician discretion.
During these visits, all efforts should be made to obtain the following assessments:  
Vital signs (only if in person visit)
Review of concomitant medications
SLAES (adverse events) and suicidality assessment
CGI-S and CGI -I
Focused Clinical Physical Exam ( only if in person visit)
If physician feels it is indicated, safety labs or ECG may be obtained.
Unscheduled Assessments  
If the site learns that a participant’s treatment has been interrupted for 1 week or longer, an 
unscheduled visit should be performed .

7 STUDY PROCEDURES/EVALUATIONS  
7.1 Study Assessments  
Parent Assessments  
Questionnaire Guidance Form:  This form will give parents guidance on time frames and specific 
instructions for how to complete the questionnaires. This form was created by stud y staff with 
guidance from manuals from the standardized forms listed below.  
Social Opportunities Questionnaire : This created form asks parents to rate how frequently their child 
has the opportunity to interact with different individuals in the community,  home, school and 
daycare/after -school setting. It also asks, of those opportunities that their child has, does their child 
actually utilize those opportunities to interact with individuals in a social manner.  
Social Reciprocity Scale -2: This 65 -item rati ng scale measures the severity of autism spectrum 
symptoms as they occur in natural social settings (Constantino, Davis et al. 2003 ).  Completed by a 
parent  or teacher in just 15 to 20 minutes, the SRS provides a clear picture of a child's social 
impairments, assessing social awareness, social information processing, capacity for reciprocal 
social communication, social anxiety/avoidance, and autistic preoccup ations and traits. It is 
appropriate for use with children from 4 to 18 years of age. The SRS measures impairment on a 
quantitative scale across a wide range of severity --which is consistent with recent research indicating 
that autism is best conceptualize d as a spectrum condition rather than an all -or-nothing diagnosis. 
The SRS -R will take the parent/caregiver/LAR approximately 10 minutes to complete.  
Pervasive Developmental Disorders Behavior Inventory (PDDBI -Screening Version)  - The PDDBI -
SV examines bot h adaptive and maladaptive behaviors related to social behaviors in autism. It is a 
parent/caregiver questionnaire and has 18 items. It takes about 5 -10 minutes to administer.   
Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) -The ABC focuses on problem behaviors in five  subdomains: 
irritability, attention, repetitive behaviors, unusual speech, and social withdrawal.  This should take 
the caregiver approximately 10 minutes to complete.  
Caregiver Strain Questionnaire  (CSQ – Berument): The CSQ will assess family stress and  was 
developed for caregivers of children with developmental disabilities.  This should take the caregiver 
approximately 5 minutes to complete.  
Medication Diary: Caregivers will be asked to record each dose given to the child on a written log. 
Caregivers will be asked to return this at each visit for the study team to review if there are any 
medication compliance issues.  
Parent Handout (Risks):  Caregivers will be given an informational handout at baseline (beginning of 
Randomized Phase) and again at week 24 (beginning of Open Label Phase). This handout will 
describe possible symptoms to look for.  
Dosing Guide/Medication Administration Form: Caregivers will be given an informational handout 
that describes study drug administration and dosing guidelines. Pa rticipants will be instructed to 
increase the dose per the titration schedule as long as there are no problems and will be strongly 
encouraged to contact the study coordinator if there are any concerns.  
Vineland Scales of Adaptive Functioning  (2nd edition,  Parent/Caregiver Rating Form):  The VABS -II 
is a survey administered to a parent or caregiver in a questionnaire format and is organized around 
four Behavior Domains: Communication, Daily Living Skills, Socialization, and Motor Skills. The 
Page 139 of 179 
VABS -II will ta ke the parent/caregiver/LAR approximately 20 -60 (average 30) minutes to complete, 
depending on the subject’s age and level of functioning. For the purposes of this study, we will not 
be assessing maladaptive behaviors.  
Childhood Anxiety Sensitivity Index (CASI -5): This scale is designed for measuring anxiety 
sensitivity (i.e., the belief that anxiety symptoms have negative consequences. There will be one 
form that is for children ages 3 -4 and a different one for ages 5 -17.  
Physician/Clinician Assessments  
Clinical Global Impressions Scale:   Overall psychiatric functioning will be assessed with the 
severity (CGI -S) and improvement (CGI -I) sub scales of the CGI (Guy 1976).  CGI-S items are rated 
from 1 (normal, not ill) to 7 (very severely ill).  CGI -I items are rated from 1 (very much improved) 
to 7 (very much worse).  
Physical Examination:   A physical examination can include, but is not limited to, abdominal 
palpation to assess for liver enlargement, assessing for decreased tone and postural problems, 
increas ed drooling and poor orofacial tone, problems holding head up as well, difficulty with 
coordination of motor actions. A more thorough exam will be done at screening and a more 
brief/clinician focused one completed at subsequent in person visit.  
Concomitan t Medication Log : At screening, the physician will make a list of any medications the 
subject is currently taking (ie: on the day of screening). The physician will record any changes to the 
subjects’ psychiatric and non -psychiatric medications from screeni ng throughout the course of the 
study. PRNs will not be recorded unless:  
they are taken for a period of 2 weeks or more AND they are taken more than 57% 
of the time (ie: 9 out of 15 days)  
OR 
the clinician feels there is a compelling reason to document them in which case this 
can be documented in a note to file. Example: a PRN that is used to address an AE 
may be noted directly on the SLAES form for clinician reference in the future, but 
will not be data entered.  
Inclusion/Exclusion: A checklist will be  completed to ensure all inclusion and none of the exclusion 
criteria are met.   
DSM -V Checklist for Autism: The proposed DSM -V criteria for autism will be documented in the 
form of a checklist for a clinician/physician to complete.   
Family Medical History:  This form will ask for information about genetic, mental health and 
medical conditions of relatives of the subject.   
Medical History: This form will ask about the subject’s medical history such as surgeries, medical 
procedures etc.  
Oxytocin Dosing Log: This log is completed by the physician to record all changes in dosing of 
oxytocin. It will include start/stop dates of when the dose changes.    
Page 140 of 179 
Trained Rater/Physician  
Systematic Longitudinal Adverse Events Scale (SLAES):  systematic elicitation and scre ening of 
adverse events will be completed using the SLAES. This will also be used at screening and baseline 
to obtain a comprehensive psychiatric and medical history of the patient.  
Suicidality Assessment:  The physician will use clinical judgment to deter mine if the participant 
understands the concepts of death and making one’s self die or hurt.  If the participant is deemed able 
to understand these concepts they will be asked if they have had any thoughts about wanting to die, 
wanting to hurt themselves, wanting to kill themselves and if s/he has done anything to hurt 
himself/herself so he/she would die or have done anything to hurt himself/herself for any other reason.  
If the participant is deemed not to understand these concepts, his/her caregiver will be queried by 
asking whether the child has said or done anything that makes the parent think the child wanted to die, 
to hurt himself/herself or to kill himself/herself and asking about suicidal behaviors.  If any are 
endorsed, the caregiver will also be a sked if this is a significant change in severity or frequency from 
the participant’s baseline.  The clinician will determine whether the behaviors clearly do not appear 
stereotypic, might be stereotypic and are clearly stereotypic (e.g. chronic repeated he ad banging or 
self biting).  
Female Reproductive Form:  We will record the last menstrual period, document irregular periods 
and verify continued use of two forms of birth control (if sexually active).  
Vital Signs:  Vital signs will be measured at each visit  and will include heart rate, sitting blood pressure, 
and temperature.   
Stanford Binet (5th edition):  The Stanford -Binet intelligence scale is a standardized test that assesses 
intelligence and cognitive abilities in children and adults aged two to 85+ ye ars. The Stanford -Binet 
Scale tests intelligence across four areas: verbal reasoning, quantitative reasoning, abstract/visual 
reasoning, and short -term memory. The areas are covered by 15 subtests, including vocabulary, 
comprehension, verbal absurdities, p attern analysis, matrices, paper folding and cutting, copying, 
quantitative, number series, equation building, memory for sentences, memory for digits, memory for 
objects, and bead memory.  The abbreviated IQ (ABIQ) will be used for this study and includes  non-
verbal fluid reasoning and verbal knowledge subtests.  
Mullen Early Scales of Learning (Mullen):  Is for birth to 68 months and is designed to assess five 
scales: Gross Motor, Visual Reception, Fine Motor, Expressive Language, and Receptive Language. 
We will not be using the Gross Motor subtest for this study since all our participants are over 36 
months. If children younger than 5 years 9 months are assessed with the ADOS Module 1 or 2, the 
receptive language subscale of the Mullen must be administered  to determine their functional status 
even if the Stanford Binet has been completed.  
Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule -2 (ADOS -2): The ADOS is a semi -structured assessment 
used to assess and diagnose individuals suspected of having autism of varying a ges, developmental 
levels, and language skills (from no speech to verbally fluent).  The ADOS includes  four modules, 
each requiring just 35 to 40 minutes to administer. The individual being evaluated is given just one 
module, depending on his or her expres sive language level and chronological age.   The rater will 
observe social and communication behaviors during various activities in the appropriate module.  
Page 141 of 179 
Autism Diagnostic Interview, Revised (ADI -R): The ADI -R is a semi -structured, investigator -based 
interview for caregivers of children and adults for whom autism or pervasive developmental 
disorders is a possible diagnosis. The revised interview has been reorganized, shortened, modified to 
be appropriate for children with mental ages from about 18 months into adulthood and linked to 
ICD-10 and DSM -IV criteria. The detailed interview focuses on early development in social and 
communication and self -help skills of the child, and takes approximately 2 hours to administer.  
Demographics:  Information such as age , race, ethnicity, family status and income will be collected. 
Electrocardiogram:  Trained staff will collect an EKG on each subject and this will be read and 
confirmed by a pediatric cardiologist.  
Reading in the Mind’s Eye Task:  This computerized task co nsists of a series of pictures of eyes in 
which the subject needs to determine which emotion the eyes are expressing.  
Self-Rating of Social Functioning:  This staff created assessment consists of several questions that 
asks the participant directly to refl ect on their own experience with social skills.  
Visual Analogue Scale of Change (Clinician and Coordinator):  Both t he treating clinician and study 
coordinator (separately) will  place a vertical line across a continuous 18 cm horizontal line. No 
change will  be reflected at the midpoint of the line, extreme worsening at the leftmost side and 
extremely better at the right most side. Three areas will be assessed: overall functioning similar to 
the CGI -I, social -communicative functioning and repetitive behaviors /restricted interests. In contrast 
to the CGI -I, the changes will be assessed after carefully considering the individual’s functioning in 
each of the domains at baseline as briefly described by the clinician. The outcome measure will be 
the distance in cm from the left end of the line to the vertical mark.     
Other  
GUID Record Form:  This form will record the GUIDs that are obtained for the subject and any
parent who is willing to consent to have his/her blood take for the genetic repository at NIMH
GUID Ac quisition Form:  This form is designed to obtain all the information necessary in order
to assign a GUID such as full name, date of birth, city of birth (as it is written on one’s birth
certificate).
Randomization Form:  This form will be used by study staf f to enter into the database in order to
determine if a subject is high functioning or low functioning for randomization purposes.
Social Skills Therapies Log:  This form will record the number of hours in the previous month
that the child received social s kills therapy.
Psychosocial Therapy Log:  This form will record the number of hours in the previous month that
the subject received any additional psychosocial therapy such as ABA, equine therapy, speech
therapy etc.
7.2 Laboratory Evaluations  
7.2.1  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations  
Page 142 of 179 
Chemistry Panel:  The chemistry panel will include glucose (random, non -fasting), CO2, Cl, K, Na, 
Creatinine, BUN, AST, ALT at Screening, week 24, and week 24. Total blood to be collected is 
8.5mL in SST tube.  
Pregnancy test:  Will be serum or urine completed at screening but can be done at any time 
throughout the course of the study at the physician’s discretion. Additionally, for females of 
childbearing potential, they must have had a negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) w ithin 2 weeks 
of randomization. This can be done by an onsite urine dipstick pregnancy test either at screening or 
baseline (prior to randomization). This will not require any additional blood and will be collected as 
part of the above chemistry panel.  
Plasma Oxytocin:  We will assay plasma oxytocin levels using standard radioimmuno assays in Dr. 
Pedersen’s lab in order to describe potential relationships between baseline levels and treatment 
response.  We expect there to be minimal changes in plasma levels  with intranasal administration, 
since oxytocin is rapidly degraded. Total 7ml of blood drawn (one 7ml lavender top tube).  
Serotonin Levels:  Serum serotonin levels will be measured by aliquoting 200uL of whole blood from 
the methylation tube. No extra blo od is needed for this.   
Urinalysis:  A full urinalysis panel is required including at least the following: specific gravity, pH, 
color/appearance, protein, glucose, leukocyte esterace, occult blood).  
Salivary Oxytocin:  Saliva will be collected from subject s. Subjects will be asked to hold a children’s 
salivary swab in their mouths under the tongue (like a thermometer) for 1.5 min.  
7.2.2  Duke Genetics 
Genetics Study:  Dr. Gregory will perform the methylation and mRNA expression studies, For the 
methylation  studies, DNA will be extracted from peripheral blood, bisulfite converted, PCR 
performed using primers targeted to the bisulfite -converted regions of the CpG islands in the 
promoter region and third intron of the OXTR  gene, and the resulting clones sequen ced to calculate 
percentage of methylation at each of the CpG sites.  Total RNA will be extracted from blood 
samples, RNA quality checked and quantitative PCR run after reverse transcription using primers for  
OTXR  exon 2 and the OXT . We will use already co llected samples (after running initial analysis of 
mRNA expression and methylation) for unspecified genetic analysis and also for other analyses to 
identify possible unspecified genetic factors that may influence response to oxytocin treatment.  
Total 8.5ml  of blood drawn (one 2.5ml PAX gene tube and two 3ml lavender top tubes)  
8 ASSESSMENTS OF SAFETY  
8.1 Adverse Events   
ICH E6 defines an AE as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical pr oduct regardless of its causal relationship to the study 
treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding that is not directly obtained for purposes of the study), symptom, or disease 
temporal ly associated with the use of medicinal (investigational) product.  The occurrence of an AE 
may come to the attention of study personnel during study visits and interviews of a study subject 
presenting for medical care, or upon review by a study monitor.  
Page 143 of 179 
All AEs will be captured on the appropriate source documentation, the Systematic Longitudinal 
Adverse Event Scale (SLAES). Information to be collected includes event description and clinician’s 
assessment of severity.  
8.1.1 Treatment Emergent Adverse Even ts 
In this trial we are documenting all AE’s, but analysis will focus only on Treatment Emergent AE’s 
(TEAE’s).  Medical and behavioral conditions that are present at screening and/or baseline will only 
be considered treatment emergent adverse events if t heir severity increases significantly after the 
participant has taken at least one dose of study treatment.  Intermittent conditions such as seasonal 
allergies will only be considered TEAEs, if the severity or frequency is significantly greater than in 
the previous two years.  Only TEAEs will be considered in the adverse event safety analyses.   
If a TEAE occurs, its relationship to study product (assessed only by those with the training and 
authority to make a diagnosis, which would include MD, DDS, DMD, PA, Nurse, Nurse Practitioner 
or DO), and resolution/stabilization will be coded at the resolution of the event or end of the 
subject’s participation in the study.  All TEAEs occurring while on study must be documented 
appropriately regardless of relations hip.  All TEAEs will be followed to adequate resolution.   If a 
TEAE is a severe adverse event rating (3)  and an Unexpected Problem (UP -no prior history of 
issue/not commonly seen in autistic patients and not described as a risk of the treatment), the UP 
form must be completed.  If a TEAE is an SAE the the SAE form and SLAES (unscheduled visit) 
must be completed.  
Severity of Event:   All AEs will be assessed by the clinician using a protocol defined grading 
system.  For events not included in the protocol  defined grading system, the following guidelines 
will be used to quantify intensity.  
Mild:  events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject’s daily
activities.
Moderate:  events result in a low level of inconvenience or concer n with the therapeutic
measures.  Moderate events may cause some interference with functioning.
Severe:  events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug
therapy or other treatment.  Severe events are usually incapacitating.
Life-threatening : Substantial risk dying or requires intervention to prevent death
Death related to AE: Subject died as a result of the event, self -explanatory
Changes in the severity of an AE will be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the  
event at each level of intensity to be performed.  Adverse events characterized as intermittent require 
documentation of onset and duration of each episode.  
Relationship to Study Treatment:   The clinician’s assessment of an AE's relationship to test arti cle 
(study drug) is part of the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is 
not reported in the study.  If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the 
event will be reported.  All AEs must have their  relationship to study product assessed using the 
terms: associated or not associated.  In a clinical trial, the study product must always be suspect.  To 
help assess, the following guidelines are used.  
Page 144of 179 
Yes (certain) : The adverse event and administration of the study drug are related in time, and
a direct association can be demonstrated.
Likely (probably) : The adverse event and administration of the study drug are reasonably
related in time, and the adverse event is more likely explained by the study drug than other
causes
Possible : The adverse event and administration of the study drug are reasonably related in
time, and the adverse event can be explained equally well by causes other than study drug.
No (unrelated) : The adverse event is clearly explained b y another cause not related to the
study drug.
Pattern Definition:  This is to help the clinician define the pattern of the AE and give some clarity to 
timing of an event.  
Isolated - Occurs a single time
Intermittent - An AE that stops and starts with clear defined points (eg. seasonal allergy)
Continuous - ongoing AE (eg. migraines)
Change/Outcome -This should be captured in order to help the clinician make a clear decision on a 
severity rating and better follow the AE through time.  
No change from last AE re port
Worsening from the last AE report
Improving from the last AE report
Recovered from the last AE report
Action Take n-The action taken after the report of an AE can be captured by the definitions below:  
O = None
M = Monitoring
CM = Conmed/Rx
D = Decreas e study med
UP = Increase study med
S = Interrupt study med
W = Withdrawal from study
8.1.2  Suicidality Assessment  
Suicidality assessments will be completed for each participant at each visit except weeks 2 and 26.  
The physician will use clinical judgm ent to determine if the participant understands the concepts of 
death and making one’s self die or hurt.  If the participant is deemed able to understand these 
concepts they will be asked if they have had any thoughts about wanting to die, wanting to hurt 
themselves, wanting to kill themselves and if s/he has done anything to hurt himself/herself so he/she 
would die or have done anything to hurt himself/herself for any other reason.  If the participant is 
deemed not to understand these concepts, his/her car egiver will be queried  with the thought 
questions replied by saying or doing anything that makes the parent think the child wanted to die, to 
hurt himself/herself or to kill himself/herself and asking about suicidal behaviors.  
Page 145 of 179 
The caregiver will also be asked if this is a significant change in severity or frequency from the 
participant’s baseline.   
The clinician will discuss any self -injurious behaviors with the steering committee describing the 
events, the participant’s prior history if any of similar b ehaviors or suicidal ideation, and the 
caregiver’s perception of any change in severity or frequency of the behaviors.  The steering 
committee will then determine whether the behaviors clearly do not appear stereotypic, might be 
stereotypic and are clearly  stereotypic (e.g. chronic repeated head banging or self biting).  These 
cases will also be reviewed by the medical monitor and DSMB.  
8.2 Reportable Events  
8.2.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
An SAE is defined as an AE that meets one of the following c onditions:  
Death during the period of protocol -defined surveillance
Life-threatening event (defined as a subject at immediate risk of death at the time of the
event)
An event requiring inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization d uring
the period of protocol defined surveillance
Results in congenital anomaly or birth defect
Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity
Any other important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or require
hospitalization, may be considered a serious adverse experience when, based upon
appropriate medical judgment, requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the
outcomes listed above.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospa sm
requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room, blood dyscrasias or new onset of
convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization.
All SAEs will be:  
recorded on the appropriate SAE CRF
followed through resolution by a study clinician
reviewed and evaluated by a study clinician.
8.2.2  Unanticipated Problems (UP)  
We will consider unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others to include, in general, 
any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria : 
unexpected (in terms of nature, severity, or frequency) given (a) the research procedures that
are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -approved research protocol
and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the s ubject population being
studied;
related or possibly related to participation in the research (in the guidance document, possibly
related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may
have been caused by the procedur es involved in the research); and
Page 146 of 179 
suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or
recognized.
8.2.3 Pregnancy  
In the case of a pregn ancy of either the subject (female) or the subject’s partner (for male subjects), 
sites/investigators should follow the pregnancy until completing (either termination or birth). The 
baby should also be followed until he/she is 1 month old to assess and rec ord any medical 
complications. All this information should be sent to the Coordinating Center via the above 
referenced contact information. The initial report (on the appropriate source document) should be to 
the coordinating center within 7 days of the si te’s awareness.  
8.2.4. Serious Suicidal Ideation  
In the case of serious intentional self -harm/serious suicidal ideation, the physician/clinician should 
take necessary steps to ensure the safety of the subject including involuntary hospitalization (if 
needed). This should be reported (on the appropriate source document) to the coordinating center 
within 7 days of the site’s awareness.  
8.2.5. Alert Lab/ECG values  
Alert values for laboratory tests (clinical/safety labs) and for ECGs will be determined by t he site’s 
treating physician and/or PI for each individual study subject. For the DSMB reports, the PIs will 
decide on specific values for each of the clinical labs and ECGs. In the event that a site has a 
lab/ECG value that is considered to alarming by ei ther the site treating physician or site PI, this must 
be reported (on the appropriate source document) to the coordinating center with 7 days of the site’s 
awareness.   
8.3 Reporting Procedures  
8.3.1 Treatment Sites Reporting to Duke  
Any event that is c onsidered reportable based on section 8.2 by the PI or Subinvestigator or which 
meets the aforementioned criteria must be submitted to the Coordinating Center. It should be 
reported on the following numbers. It is preferable to have a written report (fax o r email) for 
documentation purposes.  
Coordinating Center E -mail: cheryl.alderman@duke.edu and linmarie.sikich@duke.edu  
The study clinician will complete and submit the appropriate reporting form within the following 
timelines:   
SAEs that are deaths an d immediately life -threatening events, whether related or unrelated,
will be recorded on the Serious Adverse Event Form and sent by fax within 2 business days
of site awareness.
Page 147 of 179 
SAEs other than death and immediately life -threatening events, regardless of relationship,
will be reported by fax within 7 business days of site awareness.
UPs Form within 7 business days of the site’s awareness of the event.
Pregnancies within 7 business days of the site’s awareness
Serious Suicidal Ideation within 7 business da ys of the site’s awareness
Alert lab or ECG values within 7 business days of the site’s awareness
Decisions to reduce dose within 7 business days.
Interrupted dosing lasting more than 7 days within 7 business days of site’s awareness.
Requests to delay man datory reductions in dose within 5 business days.
Participants with a CGI -I of 6 or 7 within 7 business days of the assessment.
Other supporting documentation of the event may be requested and should be provided as soon as 
possible. Sites should report SAE s, UPs and other reportable events to their local IRB’s per the local 
IRB’s guidelines and procedures. This may differ between sites.  
8.3.2 Duke Reporting to Other Regulatory Bodies  
Medical Monitor:  Duke will report all SAEs, UPs and other reportable ev ents (section 8.2) to the 
medical monitor within 14 days and receive acknowledgment that she has reviewed them.  
DSMB:  Duke will report SAEs, UPs and other reportable events (section 8.2) that are considered 
possibly related to study treatment to the DSMB within 14 days of being made aware of their 
occurrence.   
FDA:  To be reportable to the FDA, the event must meet 3 criteria. The investigator or the holder of 
the IND may make the determination if the event meets all three of the following criteria.  
Suspec ted Adverse Reaction:  meaning there is a reasonable probability that the drug caused
the event. Meaning there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and
the adverse event.
Serious (use definition of serious in section 8.2.1)
Unexpec ted (use definition of unanticipated in section 8.2.2)
Timelines for reporting to the FDA:  
Unanticipated fatal or life threatening adverse events (7 days)
Unanticipated non -fatal/non -life threatening (14 days)
Steering Committee:  Duke will report all SAEs/ UPs/other reportable events (section 8.2) to the 
steering committee within 14 business days of Duke’s awareness.  
Duke’s local IRB:  The coordinating center is responsible for reporting unanticipated problems to 
their local IRB as their local IRB has direct  oversight of Duke and i ndirect oversight of other site s. 
The timelines for reporting unanticipated problems to the IRB are:  
Unanticipated Problems that are serious adverse events should be reported to the IRB within
one (1) week of the investigator becomi ng aware of the event.
Any other Unanticipated Problem should be reported to the IRB within two (2) weeks of the
investigator becoming aware of the problem.
Other reportable events (section 8.2): during annual renewal

8.5    Individual Stopping Procedures  
If a subject is worsening clinically (they have CGI -I score of  6 -much worse or 7 -very much worse 
on CGI -I, there has to be a return visit/phone call within 1 -2 weeks to revisit/re -evaluate with CGI -I. 
If the subject still has 6 or 7, then case must be discussed with SC and Medical Monitor within 10 
business days to get approval for the subject to continue in the trial.  
Subjects may be withdrawn  for any of the following reasons: 
If clinically significant and/or personally intolerable moderate or sever e adverse events occur
that cannot be addressed by dose adjustment or addition of concomitant medications (these
can be discussed with SC and Medical Monitor. Investigators are encouraged to try dose
reduction or addition of concomitant medications prior t o withdrawal of participants).
If a subject is worsening clinically (they have 6 much worse or 7 very much worse on CGI -I),
there has to be a return visit/phone call within 1 -2 weeks to revisit/re -evaluate with CGI -I. If
the subject still has 6 or 7, then case must be discussed with SC and Medical Monitor to get
approval for participation to continue.
Study noncompliance
Study physician discretion
Subjects  must be withdrawn for the following reasons:  
At the participant or guardian request
If the medical m onitor feels worsening of their clinical condition or life threatening adverse
events are likely to be related to the study treatment or procedures.
8.6 Safety Oversight 
8.6.1 Independent Medical Monitor  
 has a wealth of experien ce in pediatric oxytocin administration as she has 
conducted many of her own trials. She will serve as the independent medical monitor for this study. 
She will review alarm values of labs and ECGs as defined by site treating physician and/or site PI, 
UPs, SAEs, pregnancies , serious suicidal ideation.  and serious adverse events within 14 working 
days of their reporting .  She will also review all new treatment emergent adverse effects of moderate 
or greater severity two times a year prior to DSMB meetings.  S he will be available to DSMB and to 
steering committee to discuss concerns about safety related to the 2 above activities.  She will also 
discuss any case in which an individual participant has significant worsening reflected by a CGI -I of 
6 or 7 that has n ot improved over the course of 8 weeks and/or with dose reduction.    
8.6.2 Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
The UNC TRACS Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will monitor data from all sites. The 
principle role of the DSMB is to monitor the data from clinical trials to protect the safety of the 
research participants.  To achieve this, the DSMB will: a) establish a 2 times/year schedule; b) 
review proposed protocols for safety and validity; c) evaluate recruitment and rate of enrollment in 
relation  to the projected activity; d) monitor the occurrence of adverse events, serious adverse 

Page 149 of 179 
events, and early withdrawals or terminations throughout the course of the study; e) review with a 
designated research staff member the pattern of the study data; and f) evaluate study outcomes, when 
available. It will be reviewed by the DSMB 2 times/year.  
8.6.3  Overall Study Stopping Criteria  
At 26 week intervals, the study biostatistician will test whether there are significant differences 
between tho se on active treatment and those on placebo for Severe and Life Threatening/Fatal 
adverse events. The statistical analysis method will be a Fisher Exact Test. The significance level 
considered significant for these tests will be 0.05 without correction for  multiple comparisons.  If 
there are any significant differences that indicate greater risk for active treatment, further enrollment 
will be stopped, but participants currently being treated will continue. These results will be provided 
to the DSMB along w ith the summary report of enrollment and other safety data at their next 
regularly scheduled meeting.  If the DSMB will evaluate the apparently increased risk and work with 
the SOARS Steering committee as necessary to develop a mutually acceptable plan for  addressing 
the apparently increased risk. Such decisions might involve closing the study entirely, changing 
dosing or implementing additional monitoring.  
      8.6.4 Cardiac Monitoring Plan  
Based on the patient’s age, gender, and height percentile, we have adapted blood pressure 
parameters where blood pressures above or below the set threshold will prompt the PI to consider 
doing an EKG. These parameters were derived from the National High Blood Pressure Education 
Program Working Group on High Blood Pre ssure in Children and Adolescents (Falkner, Daniels et 
al. 2004 ). We have likewise adapted parameters from Pediatric cardiology for practitioners (Park 
2008 ) and Normal ECG standards for infants and children (Davignon, Rautaharju et al. 1979 )to 
establish heart rate guidelines where patients whose heart rate is above or below these thresho lds 
will be considered for an EKG at every visit. Finally, we will incorporate clinical signs and 
symptoms of cardiac risk into our assessment with the vital sign measurement and specifically query 
for the presence of syncope, dizziness, palpitations, shor tness of breath, and bradycardia or 
tachycardia. The clinical parameters will be incorporated into the SLAES. The specific parameters 
for heart rate, blood pressure are located in Appendix A. We believe, given the low cardiac risk of 
oxytocin, that careful  monitoring of vital signs and clinical signs and symptoms at every visit will be 
adequate to ensure the safety of our patients.  
9        CLINICAL MONITORING  
9.1 Site Monitoring Plan  
Site monitoring will be conducted to ensure that the human subject pr otection, study procedures, 
laboratory, study intervention administration, and data collection processes are of high quality and 
meet the sponsor, ICH E6 and, when appropriate, regulatory guidelines.  This section will give a 
general description of how sit e monitoring will be conducted.  The data monitor will be housed at 
the Data Center at UNC Chapel Hill. The Data/Regulatory Monitor will monitor the database, with 
the data manager, in order to assess quality assurance and control issues, and will generate  queries 
from the database. This individual will also monitor each site’s regulatory documents for 
Page 150 of 179 
completeness and accuracy (delegation of duties logs, 1572s, FDFs, general correspondence, IRB 
correspondence, laboratory values etc).  He/she will travel to  each site in order to monitor the study 
coordinators and the case report forms to ensure that data are collected completely and accurately. 
Specifics of site monitoring will be included in the separate data monitoring plan. He/she will ensure 
that queries  are resolved.  He/she will also ensure that data is properly and accurately entered into 
the database.   
10 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
The overall statistician or his/her designee will conduct and have ultimate responsibility for all data 
analysis descr ibed below.  All statistical computing will be done using the most recent version of 
SAS.  The lead statistician will do the programming and perform the analyses.  The analyses 
described below will be performed on the intent -to-treat population.  Additiona l exploratory analyses 
may be performed on the per protocol population or key subsets of the sample (e.g. those 
participants without fluent phrase speech).  All data will be explored using descriptive statistics and 
graphical techniques prior to any hypoth esis testing.  For categorical variables, we will examine 
frequency distributions and where appropriate contingency tables and histograms.  For continuous 
variables, we will examine frequency distributions and, where appropriate, box -and-whisker plots.  
When appropriate, we will consider transformation.  If necessary due to distributional 
considerations, we will cautiously consider a change of analysis method to a less parametric one.  
10.1 Statistical Analysis (Please also see SAP)  
General Modeling : Unle ss otherwise specified, we will fit a mixed longitudinal model with change 
from baseline to each post -baseline month (4 weeks) for a response variable, functioning (low versus 
high) as the stratification variable, center as a blocking factor, treatment (ox ytocin versus placebo) as 
the between -subjects factor, week as a within -subjects factor, their interaction, and baseline as a 
covariate.  The primary model used will be a mixed model with repeated measures (MMRM), 
treating week categorically and using an a utoregressive (with a lag of 1) covariance structure.  As a 
secondary sensitivity analysis, we will fit a random coefficients model treating week continuously 
with random coefficients for the intercept, slope, and slope  squared, with an unstructured struct ure 
among the random coefficients.    The primary hypothesis test of interest will be a test of treatment 
effect at week 24. Distributional assumptions will be examined using residuals.  These mixed models 
could fail to converge or encounter difficulties b ased on their use of asymptotics.  If they do, we will 
attempt to simplify the models in order to eliminate the problems, and if necessary, move to analyses 
that assume compound symmetry, but use a Huynh -Feldt correction if compound symmetry fails.  
Missi ng Data:  The mixed models used to evaluate the continuous response variables are able to 
handle moderate amounts of missing data provided they are missing at random.  We will examine 
the missing at random assumption by assessing baseline differences betwee n dropouts and 
completers, as well as differences in response variables up to the point of premature withdrawal.  If 
the missing at random assumption does not appear to be tenable, we will report the mixed models 
results but spend additional effort charact erizing treatment effect at time of premature withdrawal or 
the effect of not including participants with significant missing data in supplementary analyses.   
Page 151 of 179 
10.2 Sample Size Considerations  
We will use a mixed longitudinal model for our primary analyse s (see Statistical Analyses below).  
Since some aspects of the model such as covariance structure are unknown, we performed power and 
sample size calculations using a more conservative, simplified model corresponding to a two -group 
t-test on change scores.   We plan to analyze two co -primary outcome measures: the ABC -SW, which
will provide consistency with pivotal trials of other medications hypothesized to improve ASD
social symptoms, and the combined social score, which integrates ABC -SW symptoms with the new
Pervasive Developmental Disorders Behavior Inventory -Screening Version SOCDEF raw score
(PDDBI -SV, Cohen 2011, also see Outcome Measures) in order to fully capture the range of
impairments in reciprocal social behaviors observed in ASD.  We will use an  alpha of 0.025 to
correct for two co -primary outcomes. SOARS -B is powered for Aim 1b to allow independent
evaluation of oxytocin efficacy in low and high -functioning youth.
Standard deviations of change scores for the ABC -SW range from ~5 to 9 in sever al large ASD 
intervention trials (McCracken, McGough et al. 2002 ; Shea, Turgay et al. 2004 ; Aman, McDougle et 
al. 2009 ; King, Hollander et al. 2009 ; Marcus, Owen et al. 2009 ; Owen, Sikich et al. 2009 ).  We 
consider a between groups difference of 5 -7 points in ABC -SW change scores to be clinically 
meaningful.  In our power calculations, we use conservative estimates of 9 points for the SD of 
ABC -SW change and 5 points f or between group differences in ABC -SW changes (differential 
improvement on ~1/3 of items).  To achieve 80% power with an alpha of 0.025 on the ABC -SW, we 
will require 71 participants in each treatment group within the two strata. Thus, our total required 
sample for the ABC -SW in Aim 1b is 284.  We examined change in the combined social score in 30 
3-17 year olds with ASD, 20 treated with aripiprazole and 10 medication -free controls.  The mean
baseline value was 33.5 (17.2 SD) and the change overall was -10.7 (SD 13.0), with a SD of change
in each group of 11.9.  Within each treatment group, changes in the combined social score paralleled
those in the ABC -SW and PDDBI -SV, but had less variability (Sikich, personal data).  We consider
a between groups differe nce in the combined social measure changes of 10 -12 to be clinically
meaningful.  Conservative estimates using a SD of 15 and a between groups difference of 10 in the
combined social score changes results in a larger effect size for the combined social mea sure than for
the ABC -SW.  Consequently, we should have at least 80% power.  A sample size of 300 will allow
for 5% attrition between randomization and the first post -randomization visit.  On 3/28/2016 we
reduced the attrition rate to 1% based on attrition  rate observed to date which gives a final sample
size of 290. Aims 1a, 3 and 4 consider all participants, resulting in much greater power than for Aim
1b.  The power of moderator analyses depends on the distribution of participant characteristics and
variability in methylation and mRNA expression observed, which can’t be estimated reliably at this
time.
11 SUBJECT CONFIDENTIALITY  
In order to protect confidentiality, only randomly assigned ID numbers rather than names will appear 
on clinically sensitive  charts, files, and digital data. The key linking the numeric identifier and 
participant’s identity will be maintained on a separate drive that is double password protected and to 
which only the site PI and coordinator have access.  Contact information wil l be recorded separately 
in double password protected files with restricted access as above.  The code linking the names with 
Page 152 of 179 
the ID numbers will be securely protected with limited access. Medical records will be kept 
confidential with access granted only to those medical and research professionals directly involved 
with the study. If any scientific paper based on the data collected for this study is published, no 
information that could be linked to any single participant will be reported. Confidentiality w ill be 
protected to the fullest extent permitted by law.  All research personnel have completed HIPPA 
training for researchers and human ethics training.  
The samples for the methylation portion of the study (which will be sent to Simon Gregory’s team at 
Duke) will be single -coded, that is, labeled with a single specific code that does not carry any 
personal identifiers.  Single coding is the current standard used in clinical research and offers 
additional safeguards to the subject’s identifiers compared t o the HIPAA authorization. With this 
method it is possible to trace the samples back to a given subject with the use of the single coding 
key.  The clinical study investigator is responsible for maintaining the coding key. This coding key 
will be stored se parately from the research data. When stored electronically, it will be password 
protected as it will contain identifying information. The samples will also note the date of collection 
and visit number.

14 SUMMARY OF PROTOCOL CHANGES  
Summary of Changes (Protocol version date 08 March 2013):  
Removal of whole blood serotonin collection at Months 8, 12, and 18
Addition of salivary oxytocin collection at same time points as plasma oxytocin collection
(Screening, Month 2, Month 6, Month 8, Month 12 and Month 18) (added to schedule of events
and in visit descriptions)
Addition of intelligence tests (S tanford -Binet 5/Mullen at Months 6, 12, 18 (added to Schedule
of Events and in visit descriptions)
Clarified scoring procedures on the Mullen assessment regarding when to calculate mental age
for participants
Revised Oxytocin Flexible Dosing Strategy (Tabl e 3)
Updated/clarified definitions and recording requirements for concomitant medications. Made
clarifications regarding the documentation of PRNs
Added specific list of prohibited meds (ones that affect brain serotonin levels)
Added an additional reporta ble event section:
oserious intentional self -harm/serious suicidal ideation
oPregnancy of subject or a subject’s sexual partner
Revised language regarding study stopping criteria:
Added language regarding Overall Study Stopping Criteria per DSMB request
Chan ged “if moderate or severe adverse events occur that cannot be addressed by dose
adjustment or addition of concomitant medications” to “if moderate or severe adverse events
occur that cannot be addressed by dose adjustment or addition of concomitant medica tions (these
can be discussed with SC and Medical Monitor. Investigators are encouraged to try dose
reduction or addition of concomitant medications).”
Changed “clinical worsening (much worse or very much worse on CGI -I) at two consecutive
visits unless ex plicitly discussed and agreed with SC and Medical Monitor that participant can
continue in the study” to “If a subject is worsening clinically (they have score of 6 – much worse
or 7 – very much worse on CGI -I, there has to be a return visit/phone call wit hin 1 -2 weeks to re -
Page 155 of 179 
visit/re -evaluate with CGI -I. If the subject still has 6 or 7, then case must be discussed with SC 
and Medical Monitor to get approval for participation to continue.”  
Changed reporting rule requirements for UPs,SAEs and other reportable  events
Specified UNC’s responsibilities for reporting to specific authorities
Specified reporting requirements for other site
Added 2 new categories for severity of an adverse event (to be consistent with NC TraCS DSMB
Life-threatening : Substantial risk d ying or requires intervention to prevent death
Death related to AE: Subject died as a result of the event, self -explanatory
Made DSMB section consistent:
DSMB will meet and review the study 3x/year instead of quarterly as previously indicated
Clarified def inition of Serious Adverse Event
Updated Tables 1 & 2 regarding Adverse Events
Updated section regarding randomization method:
We will randomize centrally, using our data management system.  We currently do just that in
our multicenter IMPACT trial.  When a site needs to randomize a subject, after baseline is
assessed, the coordinator opens the Randomization form.  This form uses already assessed strata
to randomize from the appropriate stratum.  We will not stratify by site.  We felt that both
functional s tatus and age group were more likely to be related to the outcome than site, and there
are limits to how many strata we can have.  We will stratify by functional status (high or low)
and age group (3 age groups), producing 6 strata.  Dr. Hamer will generat e a randomization plan
for each of the 6 strata, using a permuted block algorithm with randomly selected block sizes of
2 and 4, using SAS.  The table will be exported to an Excel file and sent to the data manager, Ms.
Scheer.  This can be done without hav ing Dr. Hamer ever actually see the randomization plan.
(He will debug the program and when debugged, run it with a new seed for the random number
generator without seeing the results.)  Ms. Scheer will import the randomization plan as a table in
Access.  The Randomization form will use Visual Basic code and the values of the strata
variables to enter the correct subset of the table and choose the first unused treatment.  It will
generate an ID number and send an email to the appropriate pharmacy, where dr ug will be
assigned.
Summary of C hanges (Protocol version date March 21, 2013 ,v. 3.0): 
Changed dearth of safety information to limited safety information given new data emerging,
Added clarifying text to the evidence for safety of sustained intranasal oxy tocin treatment in
ASD.
Introduced nomenclature of “sociability factor (SF)” to replace prior references to combined
social score.  There is no change in how it is derived.
Clarified the key secondary outcomes analyzed in aim 1c.
Clarified the exploratory measures including the calibrated severity score from the ADOS and
the reading the mind in the eyes test.
Added examination of potential interactions with defined classes of concomitant medications.
Page 156 of 179 
Clarified procedures for flexible dosing and doses labele d by letter.
Added suicidality assessments to schedule of visits and provided section describing how
assessments would be done.
Summary of Changes (Protocol version date: Jan 16 , 2014)  
Define deafness and blindness
Duke genetics testing is now NOT option al, but the NIMH samples ARE still optional. Because
the Duke samples (mRNA/methylation) are part of our specific/exploratory aims, we did not
want to dilute the sample size. With genetics you run the risk of not having enough power
because the sample size  is too small, so we felt it was important to require this sample to ensure
it is collected from all subjects. We will more likely be able to see an effect with a larger sample.
Changed citations and fixed the reference section as they appear in the text  using Endnote.
Deleted the previous reference list and created an Endnote automatically updated version \
Added clarification that screening labs must be repeated if there is more than 12 weeks between
the screening and baseline visits.
Change the CASI -4R to the CASI -V version
Taking over psychiatric care for subjects is now optional. This will be determined by site.
Clarified that unblinding will not be permitted in this protocol. However, subject’s may have
treatment interrupted (temporarily discontinued ) by treating clinician and the subject may be re -
challenged if it is discussed and approved by the SC.
Addition of a more specific cardiac monitoring plan where heart rate, blood pressure and pulse
will be monitored at every visit in addition to clinical  paremeters in the SLAES. Syncope
(fainting) is added as a separate line item in the SLAES.
Added optional PK protocol (section 12)
Move methylation sample and plasma/salivary OT sample from month 8 (week 32) to week 36
(month 9) to make it coincide with P K sample for those individuals participating in the optional
PK study (ie: eliminating an additional blood draw for those who are participating in the PK
study).
Updated table of contents
Clarified in randomization procedures that we will stratify both by functional status and by age
group.
The ABC and PDDBI -SV will be added to all in office visits. The schedule of events and visit
descriptions have been edited to reflect this change.
Section 10.1 changes made in statistical analysis general modeling sect ion.
Changed all Month to weeks (example, month 1 will now be week 4)
Removed information about where the drug will be manufactured/compounded as this
information will be directly in the IND application to the FDA and not in the protocol.
Deleted informati on about specific dosing concentrations (Tables 3a and 3b).
Added a table that specified total daily dose (broken up into morning and afternoon doses). Does
not specify number of sprays/concentration of each dose.
Page 157 of 179 
Removed ADOS calibrated severity score as  a potential exploratory outcome measure
Removed ADOS from week 48
Increased the number of mLs needed for NIMH optional genetic sample
Clarified prohibited benzodiazepines in prohibited meds section of protocol.
Removed medication administration training v ideo for parents
Added more specific criteria for increasing and decreasing dose:
oIncreases in Dose:  Doses may increase if all three of the following criteria are met:
CGI-I is not a 1 or a 2
No evidence of clinically significant adverse events
Parents a gree
oDecreases in Dose:  Doses must be decreased if any of the following criteria are met:
Significant AEs persist for at least 2 weeks or clinician judges it requires
immediate adjustment of dose
OR
Clinician, parent, participant felt they were doing bette r on lower dose
OR
CGI score of 6 or 7
Summary of Changes (Protocol version date: March 8 , 2014)  
Clarified information concerning dosing (added two sentences).
Added missed X marks in CGI -I and SLAES in check boxes in table 6 for week 2 and 26.
Added furt her clarification to exclusion criteria for chronic oxytocin treatment (added that
chronic is daily intranasal oxytocin treatment of more than 1 month)
Clarified an ideal time for plasma/salivary oxytocin collection
Clarified details on the specific saliva ry oxytocin collection procedure
Editorial changes removing bullet points and double words.
Summary of Changes (Protocol version date: July 25 2014 ) 
Added cyberball task at baseline, week 8, week 24, week 32, week 48 and week 72
Suggested time for NIMH sa mple of subject to be drawn is week 36 due to the volume of blood
collected at other visits.
Safety labs must be re -drawn if has been greater than 12 months between screening and baseline
Optional re -draw at baseline of plasma oxytocin, methylation and sal ivary oxytocin (prior to first
dose of study drug) in order for these levels to be an accurate reflection of baseline levels (for
subjects who have had a lengthy time between screening and baseline)
Clarifying that the T0 draw for the PK study is the same as the regular plasma oxytocin level at
weeks 36 and 44. Therefore, those participating in the PK study do not ALSO need an additional
tube for the plasma oxytocin levels.
Change inclusion criteria regarding ADOS and ADI -R. Now subjects must have a clinica l
diagnosis of ASD confirmed either using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS, Lord
et al., 2001) or the Autism Diagnostic Interview -Revised (ADI -R, Rutter, 2003). For subjects
Page 158 of 179 
who do not meet criteria on either, but the clinician still believes to have ASD, those individuals 
may be included if the SC agrees.  
Clarified that dosing my only be decreased by 8IU qD increments and increased by 8IU BID
increments.
Dose decrease criteria clarified. Instead of clinical worsening, the criteria now states t hat dose
may be decreased if there are two consecutive CGI -I scores are worse that the preceding two
CGI-I scores.
Summary of Changes (Protocol version date: November 17, 2014)  
Methylation and mRNA will be collected at screening, baseline (optional for those who have had
lengthy screening periods), week 8, week 24 and week 36
Stanford Binet and Mullen must be completed within 1 month of baseline (can be completed at
screening but must be repeated if not within 1 month of randomization).
Clarification on prohibited meds: Remeron (mirtazapine) is allowed but tricyclics/tetracyclic
antidepressants are now prohibited.
Clarified that for the Vineland -II, we will be using the parent/caregiver rating form instead of the
survey/interview format and we will not be  doing the maladaptive behaviors .
Pregnancy test (urine or serum) for females of childbearing potential must be confirmed as
negative within 2 weeks of baseline appointment. This can either be done at a screening visit or
can be done at baseline prior to randomization (urine dipstick test).
Preferred time to collect NIMH repository sample from subject is now at week 48. This is due to
the fact that week 48 now has the least amount of blood drawn due to changes in
methylation/mRNA sample collection.
Remove d the PDDBI -Full and instead it will be replaced with the much shorter PDDBI -SV and
also removed reference to PDDBI -full in the exploratory outcome measures section of the
protocol.
Clarified in the schedule of events superscript 0 beside CGI -S/I. CGI -S at baseline and CGI -S
and CGI -I at all other time points.
Deleted reference to Week 44 regular plasma OT sample in the PK protocol section as it was
added erroneously in the previous version.
Clarified that we will not be doing the gross motor subtest of the  Mullen
Revised dose decreasing criteria
Clarified in several locations throughout the protocol that there will now be 6 sites instead of 5
sites.
Added clarification that cyberball task is an additional outcome measure in section 2.2.3.
Removed estimat es of times/year that the monitor will travel to each site. This may be variable
depending on the rate of enrollment at each site.
DSMB will now meet 2 times/year
The medical monitor will now review all new treatment emergent adverse effects of moderate or
greater severity two times a year in order to coincide with the DSMB meetings.
Page 159 of 179 
Alert values for labs and EKGs are determined by site PI and/or site treating physician
Administrative change: rearranged reportable events section of the protocol (changed se ction
numbers) to be more clear/concise and also added alert lab/EKG values as considered reportable
events and must be reported to UNC within 7 days of the sites awareness.
Addition of a visual analogue scale for treating physician and coordinator to comp lete at week 0,
12, 24, 36, 48 and 72.
Made additional clarification in the schedule of events about a previous modification regarding
labs. Safety labs (glucose, CO2, Cl, K, Na, Creatinine, BUN, AST, ALT, urine specific gravity
and pregnancy test) must be  redrawn at baseline if more than 12 months has elapsed between
screening and baseline visits. Methylation, plasma/salivary oxytocin has an optional re -draw at
baseline if there has been a lengthy time between screening and baseline visits.
Summary of Pr otocol Changes (Version Date: March 2, 2015)  
Clarified the target dose and the efforts to achieve the target dose if at all possible.
Increased the requirement for duration of treatment with the target dose (from 4 weeks to 7
weeks) to ensure there was ful l opportunity to evaluate the target dose.  Clarified the rules for
maintaining a lower dose than recommended by the titration schedule, timing of subsequent dose
increases during the titration phase, mandatory and optional dose reductions and increases abo ve
the target dose.
Increased the total dose given at one time from 40/0 IU (1 high dose insufflation and 2 low dose
insufflations) to 48/0 IU (2 high dose insufflations) to allow achievement of the total daily target
dose with a single administration time .
Clarified procedures related to interrupting dosing in order to capture primary outcome measures
and safety data very close to the time of the last study treatment to increase interpretability of
data.
Added two additional possible doses in schedule (48 IU AM/0 IU PM and 48 IU AM/24 IU PM)
as the maximum dose at any time can be 48 IU
mRNA was initially overlooked and will be part of optional re -draw at baseline which is now
reflected in section 6.2 and schedule of events.
Clarified wording in the Schedule  of events.
Add full urinalysis at all time points when specific gravity is already analyzed.
Clarified early termination procedures, need to obtain data within 2 weeks of stopping treatment.
Specified those ending in blinded phase would complete week 24 p rocedures and those ending in
open label phase would complete week 48 procedures.

(such as additional unscheduled labs, EC Gs, visits etc) in section 6.7
Changed timing of visual analog scale to correspond with all post -baseline in person scheduled
visits (all visits except 2 and 26)
Page 160  of 179 
Clarified that the visual analogue scale (VAS) will be called the VAS of change (not
improveme nt) and will have three sections: overall functioning, repetitive behavior, and social -
communicative functioning. Additionally clarified that only the clinician will complete the
baseline description of functioning (not the coordinator) and added the VAS t o discussion of
additional outcome measures.
Clarified that the Mullen receptive language subtest needs to be done in all children who require
ADOS testing with a Module 1 or 2 who are 5 years 8 months old or younger to determine
functional strata.
A focu sed clinical exam will be done at all post screening visits (instead of full NIMH physical
exam form which combines aspects of physical and medical history) and clarified in assessments
section that height/weight will be obtained as part of vital signs
Clarified that medical monitor will review significant and persistent worsening of functioning
(CGI -I of 6 or 7) and require the individual participant stop the study.
Clarifying procedures for re -evaluation visit (if dose is decreased or CGI -I score is 6 or 7).
Clarifying procedures for when a subject must be withdrawn versus when a subject may be
withdrawn.
Administrative and editorial changes throughout.
Summary of Protocol Changes (Version Date: May 8, 2015; Protocol Version 5.0)  
Revised inclusion/exclu sion criteria to allow for all concomitant psychiatric medication that has
been stable for 4 weeks prior to baseline appointment.
Clarified that individual has to be diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder  using DSM -V
criteria.
Removed prohibited medic ations section
Summary of Protocol Changes (Version Date: June 4, 2015; Protocol Version 5.1)  
Overall PI (Dr. Sikich) is no longer affiliated with UNC -Chapel Hill. New affiliation is with
Duke University. Duke University will now be lead site under dire ction of overall PI (Sikich).
Various changes made to clarify this (phone number, email addresses, etc).
Summary of Protocol Changes (Version Date 3/21/2016; Protocol Version 6.0)  
Adding additional exclusion criteria: subjects cannot have active seizures within the 6 months
prior to screening or baseline.
Remove Dr. Hamer as lead statistician.
Russ Dean is now the PI at the UNC -Data Center
Clarified that visit procedures may occur on separate days as needed, but open label study drug
administration may not  occur until all week 24 procedures have been completed.
Remove cyberball task entirely
Remove ADI -R at screening, this will be completed at physician discretion only
Page 161 of 179 
Removed the requirement for the IQ testing (Mullen/SB) to be completed within 1 month of the

between screening and baseline.
Replace week 2 phone call/email so that the study team only sends the Parent Dose Sheet
(schedule B)
Changed week 12 to only  be questionnaires, no in office visit
Removed ADOS week 24, this may be completed at the physician’s/site’s discretion
Remove week 26 phone call/email
Removed week 32, 40 and 44 visits where dose is not expected to change. Subjects will be
instructed to contact the site if there are any issues between scheduled visits. Subjects may
always have the ability for an unscheduled visit as needed.
Week 36 visit
o Remove VABS  and RMET
o Added safety lab collection (blood/urine)
Remove the following procedures at we ek 48:
oRemoved EKG
o Removed the blood draw, urine and saliva collection at week 48 (plasma oxytocin, safety
labs, salivary oxytocin) at week 48, it is the physician’s discretion if they want to assess
safety labs (blood and urine) only
Removed week 72 visit
Added down titration schedule at the end of the study or if a subject early terminates and agrees
to follow the down titration schedule
Added a follow up phone call (SLAES) to be completed after study drug has been stopped at
week 53 -55
Shorten early term ination visit. No blood/saliva/EKG/ADOS or IQ testing is required at an E/T
visit.
Made general clarifications and better wording surrounding the dosing. Major changes include:
oFor optional dose reductions, clarified that the SLAES does not need to be com pleted,
but adverse events do need to be assessed and documented.
oChanged criteria for increasing above the target dose: removed criteria that CGI -I cannot
be a 1. If the CGI -I is a 1, but the clinician still feels there is room for improvement, then
the d ose may still be increased above target.
oChange dosing scheme in open label phase:
Week 24 -28 = 24 IU TDD
Week 28 -36 = 48 IU TDD
Week 36 -48 = 72 IU TDD

suggested dosing for eac h of the visits.
Decreased overall samples size to 290 due to lower than expected attrition rates.
Adding more wording to clarify definitions for relatedness: Yes= related, likely = probably, no =
unrelated
Added additional definitions surrounding adverse event monitoring related to the SLAES:
Pattern Definition:  This is to help the clinician define the pattern of the AE and give some
clarity to timing of an event.
Change/Outcome -This should be captured in order to help the clinician make a clear
decision o n a severity rating and better follow the AE through time.
Action Take -The action taken after the report of an AE can be captured by the definitions
below:

HIGH LEVEL SUMMARY OF PR OTOCOL CHANGES  
Changes were made to the protocol ten times, including six times prior to randomizing participants in 
December 2014. Early changes were made primarily at the request of NICHD reviewers and regulatory 
bodies including the DSMB, IRB’s at vari ous sites, and the FDA. Changes to the visit schedule and 
outcome measures were made primarily as a result of unexpected funding decreases and delays and 
costs in securing study drug. In this summary, changes are presented by type and reason.  
In the deta iled summary copied from the final version of the protocol, changes are organized by protocol 
version.  
Safety P rocedure  Changes : 
Added specific list of prohibited meds that might affect serotonin levels
Expanded reportable events to include intentional  self-harm/serious suicidal ideation and
pregnancy
Added criteria for clinical worsening  that would  lead to dose decrease
Added blood pressure parameters and ECG at request of a site IRB
Eliminated safety labs at week 48, instead obtaining them at week 3 6
Greater specification of procedures and criteria for stopping the overall study and withdrawing
an individual participant due to safety concerns.
Required discussion of moderate and severe adverse events with Steering Committee (SC) and
Medical Monitor (MM)
Frequency of DSMB meetings reduced from quarterly to twice annually
Clarified lead site and other treatment sites reporting requirements

Schedule of Events: 
Changed from months to weeks for greater precision of time points
Eliminated in -person visi ts at Weeks 2 and 26
Eliminated in -person visits at Weeks 32, 40, and 44
Eliminated Month18/Week 72 follow -up due to lack of funding and time, replaced with AE
follow -up approximately 4 weeks after treatment is stopped
Added ABC -SW and PPD -BI SV to each in -person visit
Switched collection of genetic measures and biological samples in open -label treatment from
w32 to w36 to provide additional information about time course of biological measures
Allowed for up to 18 months between screening and baseline with specification of measures that
needed to be repeated due to unanticipated delay in access to study drug once screening was
opened (~ summer 2013)
Minimized the number of visits during open label treatment to weeks 28, 36, 48
Outcome Measures: 
Initially p lanned to have two co -primary outcomes, the ABC -SW and a combined measure later
termed the Sociability Factor, later discontinued this in the final SAP though change was not
formally made in protocol.
Page 171of 179 
At one point added the cyberball social exclusion task as an objective measure that had shown
sensitivity to change with oxytocin in single dose studies; later eliminated it because we were not
able to adapt for use with younger children, individuals with intellectual disability or a racially
diverse sample wi th automated scoring.
Remov ed w24 ADOS due to financial constraints and lack of evidence of change previously
Required collection of study specific genetic measures but not NIMH repository samples
Added optional PK sample at target and maximal dose per FD A request
Added cognitive testing as an outcome at week 24 (after initially also including week 48 and 72)
Added salivary oxytocin collection at same times as plasma oxytocin collection
Specified key secondary outcomes for analysis 1c
Removed PDD -BI full  version and switched to 18 item PDD -BI-SV to reduce participant burden
Switched from Vineland Interview version to Vineland caregiver -report version to reduce burden
on staff and participants.
Procedural Changes:  
Revised oxytocin dosing schedule to allo w more flexibility during double -blind treatment
Developed specific criteria for increasing oxytocin above target dose
Developed detailed procedures for increasing or reducing oxytocin dose outside of recommended
titration schedule.
Specified use of a cent rally administered randomization only included age group and verbal
status as strata and did not include site to minimize uneven cells across full study.
Made DSM -5 criteria primary inclusion criteria to informed by ADI or ADOS and Steering
committee disc ussion if DSM -5 criteria were positive but ADI/ADOS were not
Changes to the statistical analysis plan were made both in the protocol and noting should refer to
SAP for final plan
Changed randomization target from 300 to 290 because attrition was lower than  expected and the
grant funding period was about to expire
Personnel Changes:  
Data Center PI, Dr. Hamer died.  He was replaced by Russ Dean.  However, he lacked the
statistical expertise to perform the analyses so that eventually Duke Clinical Research In stitute
statistical staff under the direction of Dr. Sheng Luo performed the primary analyses that are the
subject of this report
Lead PI Sikich switched institutions from UNC to Duke in August 2015
Treatment site PI’s Veenstra -Van der Weele, King and Sand ers left their original sites during the
course of the study.  Dr. Veenstra -Van der Weele then headed a new 6th site at Columbia
University.

DETAILED, TEMPORAL SUMMARY OF PROTOCOL CHANGES FROM V6.O  
Summary of Changes (Protocol version date 08 March 20 13): 
Removal of whole blood serotonin collection at Months 8, 12, and 18
Addition of salivary oxytocin collection at same time points as plasma oxytocin collection
(Screening, Month 2, Month 6, Month 8, Month 12 and Month 18) (added to schedule of events
and in visit descriptions)
Addition of intelligence tests (Stanford -Binet 5/Mullen at Months 6, 12, 18 (added to Schedule
of Events and in visit descriptions)
Clarified scoring procedures on the Mullen assessment regarding when to calculate mental age
for p articipants
Revised Oxytocin Flexible Dosing Strategy (Table 3)
Updated/clarified definitions and recording requirements for concomitant medications. Made
clarifications regarding the documentation of PRNs
Added specific list of prohibited meds (ones that affect brain serotonin levels)
Added an additional reportable event section:
oserious intentional self -harm/serious suicidal ideation
oPregnancy of subject or a subject’s sexual partner
Revised language regarding study stopping criteria:
oAdded language rega rding Overall Study Stopping Criteria per DSMB request
oChanged “if moderate or severe adverse events occur that cannot be addressed by dose
adjustment or addition of concomitant medications” to “if moderate or severe adverse
events occur that cannot be add ressed by dose adjustment or addition of concomitant
medications (these can be discussed with SC and Medical Monitor. Investigators are
encouraged to try dose reduction or addition of concomitant medications).”
oChanged “clinical worsening (much worse or ve ry much worse on CGI -I) at two
consecutive visits unless explicitly discussed and agreed with SC and Medical Monitor
that participant can continue in the study” to “If a subject is worsening clinically (they
have score of 6 – much worse or 7 – very much wo rse on CGI -I, there has to be a return
visit/phone call within 1 -2 weeks to re -visit/re -evaluate with CGI -I. If the subject still has
6 or 7, then case must be discussed with SC and Medical Monitor to get approval for
participation to continue.”
oChanged re porting rule requirements for UPs,SAEs and other reportable events
oSpecified UNC’s responsibilities for reporting to specific authorities
oSpecified reporting requirements for other site
Added 2 new categories for severity of an adverse event (to be consist ent with NC TraCS DSMB
oLife-threatening : Substantial risk dying or requires intervention to prevent death
oDeath related to AE: Subject died as a result of the event, self -explanatory
Made DSMB section consistent:
oDSMB will meet and review the study 3x/year  instead of quarterly as previously
indicated
Clarified definition of Serious Adverse Event
Updated Tables 1 & 2 regarding Adverse Events
Updated section regarding randomization method:
oWe will randomize centrally, using our data management system.  We cur rently do just
that in our multicenter IMPACT trial.  When a site needs to randomize a subject, after
Page 173 of 179
baseline is assessed, the coordinator opens the Randomization form.  This form uses 
already assessed strata to randomize from the appropriate stratum.  We  will not stratify 
by site.  We felt that both functional status and age group were more likely to be related 
to the outcome than site, and there are limits to how many strata we can have.  We will 
stratify by functional status (high or low) and age group (3 age groups), producing 6 
strata.  Dr. Hamer will generate a randomization plan for each of the 6 strata, using a 
permuted block algorithm with randomly selected block sizes of 2 and 4, using SAS.  The 
table will be exported to an Excel file and sent to the data manager, Ms. Scheer.  This can 
be done without having Dr. Hamer ever actually see the randomization plan.  (He will 
debug the program and when debugged, run it with a new seed for the random number 
generator without seeing the results.)  Ms. Schee r will import the randomization plan as a 
table in Access.  The Randomization form will use Visual Basic code and the values of 
the strata variables to enter the correct subset of the table and choose the first unused 
treatment.  It will generate an ID num ber and send an email to the appropriate pharmacy, 
where drug will be assigned.  
Summary of Ch anges (Protocol version date March 21, 2013 v.3.0):  
Changed dearth of safety information to limited safety information given new data emerging,
Added clarifying te xt to the evidence for safety of sustained intranasal oxytocin treatment in
ASD.
Introduced nomenclature of “sociability factor (SF)” to replace prior references to combined
social score.  There is no change in how it is derived.
Clarified the key secondar y outcomes analyzed in aim 1c.
Clarified the exploratory measures including the calibrated severity score from the ADOS and
the reading the mind in the eyes test.
Added examination of potential interactions with defined classes of concomitant medications.
Clarified procedures for flexible dosing and doses labeled by letter.
Added suicidality assessments to schedule of visits and provided section describing how
assessments would be done.
Summary of Changes (Protocol version date: Jan 16 2014)  
Define deafne ss and blindness
Duke genetics testing is now NOT optional, but the NIMH samples ARE still optional. Because
the Duke samples (mRNA/methylation) are part of our specific/exploratory aims, we did not
want to dilute the sample size. With genetics you run the  risk of not having enough power
because the sample size is too small, so we felt it was important to require this sample to ensure
it is collected from all subjects. We will more likely be able to see an effect with a larger sample.
Changed citations an d fixed the reference section as they appear in the text using Endnote.
Deleted the previous reference list and created an Endnote automatically updated version \
Added clarification that screening labs must be repeated if there is more than 12 weeks betwee n
the screening and baseline visits.
Change the CASI -4R to the CASI -V version
Taking over psychiatric care for subjects is now optional. This will be determined by site.
Clarified that unblinding will not be permitted in this protocol. However, subject’s may have
treatment interrupted (temporarily discontinued) by treating clinician and the subject may be re -
challenged if it is discussed and approved by the SC.
Page 174 of 179
Addition of a more specific cardiac monitoring plan where heart rate, blood pressure and pulse
will be monitored at every visit in addition to clinical paremeters in the SLAES. Syncope
(fainting) is added as a separate line item in the SLAES.
Added optional PK protocol (section 12)
Move methylation sample and plasma/salivary OT sample from month 8 ( week 32) to week 36
(month 9) to make it coincide with PK sample for those individuals participating in the optional
PK study (ie: eliminating an additional blood draw for those who are participating in the PK
study).
Updated table of contents
Clarified in  randomization procedures that we will stratify both by functional status and by age
group.
The ABC and PDDBI -SV will be added to all in office visits. The schedule of events and visit
descriptions have been edited to reflect this change.
Section 10.1 ch anges made in statistical analysis general modeling section.
Changed all Month to weeks (example, month 1 will now be week 4)
Removed information about where the drug will be manufactured/compounded as this
information will be directly in the IND applicati on to the FDA and not in the protocol.
Deleted information about specific dosing concentrations (Tables 3a and 3b).
Added a table that specified total daily dose (broken up into morning and afternoon doses). Does
not specify number of sprays/concentration  of each dose.
Removed ADOS calibrated severity score as a potential exploratory outcome measure
Removed ADOS from week 48
Increased the number of mLs needed for NIMH optional genetic sample
Clarified prohibited benzodiazepines in prohibited meds section o f protocol.
Removed medication administration training video for parents
Added more specific criteria for increasing and decreasing dose:
Increases in Dose:  Doses may increase if all three of the following criteria are met:
CGI-I is not a 1 or a 2
No evi dence of clinically significant adverse events
Parents agree
Decreases in Dose:  Doses must be decreased if any of the following criteria are met:
Significant AEs persist for at least 2 weeks or clinician judges it requires immediate
adjustment of dose
OR
Clinician, parent, participant felt they were doing better on lower dose
OR
CGI score of 6 or 7
Summary of Changes (Protocol version date: March 8 , 2014)  
Clarified information concerning dosing (added two sentences) .
Added missed X marks in CGI -I and SLAE S in check boxes in table 6 for week 2 and 26.
Added further clarification to exclusion criteria for chronic oxytocin treatment (added that
chronic is daily intranasal oxytocin treatment of more than 1 month)
Clarified an ideal time for plasma/salivary oxy tocin collection

Page 175 of 179
Editorial changes removing bullet points and double words.
Summary of Changes (Protocol version date: July 25 , 2014)  
Added cyberball task at baseline, week 8, week 2 4, week 32, week 48 and week 72
Suggested time for NIMH sample of subject to be drawn is week 36 due to the volume of blood
collected at other visits.
Safety labs must be re -drawn if has been greater than 12 months between screening and baseline
Optional r e-draw at baseline of plasma oxytocin, methylation and salivary oxytocin (prior to first
dose of study drug) in order for these levels to be an accurate reflection of baseline levels (for
subjects who have had a lengthy time between screening and baseline)
Clarifying that the T0 draw for the PK study is the same as the regular plasma oxytocin level at
weeks 36 and 44. Therefore, those participating in the PK study do not ALSO need an additional
tube for the plasma oxytocin levels.
Change inclusion criteria regarding ADOS and ADI -R. Now subjects must have a clinical diagnosis of
ASD confirmed either using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Scale (ADOS, Lord et al., 2001) or the
Autism Diagnostic Interview -Revised (ADI -R, Rutter, 2003). For subjects who do not meet criteria on
either, but the clinician still believes to have ASD, those individuals may be included if the SC agrees.
Clarified that dosing my only be decreased by 8IU qD increments and increased by 8IU BID increments.
Dose decrease criteria clarified . Instead of clinical worsening, the criteria now states that dose may be
decreased if there are two consecutive CGI -I scores are worse that the preceding two CGI -I scores.
Summary of Changes (Protocol version date: November 17, 2014)  
Methylation and mR NA will be collected at screening, baseline (optional for those who have had
lengthy screening periods), week 8, week 24 and week 36
Stanford Binet and Mullen must be completed within 1 month of baseline (can be completed at
screening but must be repeated if not within 1 month of randomization).
Clarification on prohibited meds: Remeron (mirtazapine) is allowed but tricyclics/tetracyclic
antidepressants are now prohibited.
Clarified that for the Vineland -II, we will be using the parent/caregiver rating form  instead of the
survey/interview format and we will not be doing the maladaptive behaviors..
Pregnancy test (urine or serum) for females of childbearing potential must be confirmed as
negative within 2 weeks of baseline appointment. This can either be don e at a screening visit or
can be done at baseline prior to randomization (urine dipstick test).
Preferred time to collect NIMH repository sample from subject is now at week 48. This is due to
the fact that week 48 now has the least amount of blood drawn d ue to changes in
methylation/mRNA sample collection.
Removed the PDDBI -Full and instead it will be replaced with the much shorter PDDBI -SV and
also removed reference to PDDBI -full in the exploratory outcome measures section of the
protocol.
Clarified in th e schedule of events superscript 0 beside CGI -S/I. CGI -S at baseline and CGI -S
and CGI -I at all other time points.
Deleted reference to Week 44 regular plasma OT sample in the PK protocol section as it was
added erroneously in the previous version.
Clarifi ed that we will not be doing the gross motor subtest of the Mullen
Revised dose decreasing criteria
Page 176 of 179

Removed estimates of times/year that the monitor will travel to each site. This may be variable
depending on the rate of enrollment at each site.
DSMB will now meet 2 times/year
The medical monitor will now revie w all new treatment emergent adverse effects of moderate or
greater severity two times a  year in order to coincide with the DSMB meetings.
Alert values for labs and EKGs are determined by site PI and/or site treating physician
Administrative change: rearr anged reportable events section of the protocol (changed section
numbers) to be more clear/concise and also added alert lab/EKG values as  considered reportable
events and must be reported to UNC within 7 days of the sites awareness.
Addition of a visual an alogue scale for treating physician and coordinator to complete at week 0,
12, 24, 36, 48 and 72.
Made additional clarification in the schedule of events about a previous modification regarding
labs. Safety labs (glucose, CO2, Cl, K, Na, Creatinine, BUN, A ST, ALT, urine specific gravity
and pregnancy test) must be redrawn at baseline if more than 12 months has elapsed between
screening and baseline visits. Methylation, plasma/salivary oxytocin has an optional re -draw at
baseline if there has been a lengthy time between screening and baseline visits.
Summary of Protocol Changes (Version Date: March 2, 2015)  
Clarified the target dose and the efforts to achieve the target dose if at all possible.
Increased the requirement for duration of treatment with the ta rget dose (from 4 weeks to 7
weeks) to ensure there was full opportunity to evaluate the target dose.  Clarified the rules for
maintaining a lower dose than recommended by the titration schedule, timing of subsequent dose
increases during the titration phas e, mandatory and optional dose reductions and increases above
the target dose.
Increased the total dose given at one time from 40/0 IU (1 high dose insufflation and 2 low dose
insufflations) to 48/0 IU (2 high dose insufflations) to allow achievement of th e total daily target
dose with a single administration time.
Clarified procedures related to interrupting dosing in order to capture primary outcome measures
and safety data very close to the time of the last study treatment to increase interpretability of
data.
Added two additional possible doses in schedule (48 IU AM/0 IU PM and 48 IU AM/24 IU PM)
as the maximum dose at any time can be 48 IU
mRNA was initially overlooked and will be part of optional re -draw at baseline which is now
reflected in section 6. 2 and schedule of events.
Clarified wording in the Schedule of events .
Add full urinalysis at all time points when specific gravity is already analyzed.
Clarified early termination procedures, need to obtain data within 2 weeks of stopping treatment.
Speci fied those ending in blinded phase would complete week 24 procedures and those ending in
open label phase would complete week 48 procedures.
Clarified interrupted treatment procedures
Add clarification that follow up safety measures may be added based on physician judgment
(such as additional unscheduled labs, E CGs, visits etc)  in section 6.7
Page 178 of 179 
Changed timing of visual analog scale to correspond with all post -baseline in person scheduled
visits  (all visits except 2 and 26)
Clarified that the visual analogue scale (VAS) will be called the VAS of change (not
improvement) and will have three sections: overall functioning, repetitive behavior, and social -
communicative functioning. Additionally clarified that only the clinician will complete the
baseline descripti on of functioning (not the coordinator) and added the VAS to discussion of
additional outcome measures.
Clarified that the Mullen receptive language subtest needs to be done in all children who require
ADOS testing with a Module 1 or 2 who are 5 years 8 m onths old or younger to determine
functional strata.
A focused clinical exam will be done at all post screening visits (instead of full NIMH physical
exam form which combines aspects of physical and medical history) and clarified in assessments
section tha t height/weight will be obtained as part of vital signs
Clarified that medical monitor will review significant and persistent worsening of functioning
(CGI -I of 6 or 7) and require the individual participant stop the study.
Clarifying procedures for re -evaluation visit (if dose is decreased or CGI -I score is 6 or 7).
Clarifying procedures for when a subject must be withdrawn versus when a subject may be
withdrawn.
Administrative and editorial changes throughout.

been stable for 4 weeks prior to baseline appointment.
Clarified that individual has to be diagnosed wi th an autism spectr um disorder using DSM -V
criteria.
Removed prohibited medications section

o Remove VABS and RMET
o Added safety lab collection (blood/urine)
•Remove the following procedures at week 48:
oRemoved EKG
oRemoved the blood draw, urine and saliva collection at week 48 (plasma oxytocin, safety
labs, salivary oxytocin) at week 48, it is the physician’s discretion if they want to assess
safety labs (blood and urine) only

oFor optional dose reductions, clarified that the SLAES does not need to be completed, but
adverse events do need to be assessed and documented.
oChanged criteria for increasing above the target dose: removed criteria that CGI-I cannot be a
1. If the CGI-I is a 1, but the clinician still feels there is room for improvement, then the dose
may still be increased above target.

dosing for each of the visits.
•Decreased overall samples size to 290 due to lower than expected attrition rates.
•Adding more wording to clarify definitions for relatedness: Yes= related, likely = probably, no =
unrelated
•Added additional definitions surrounding adverse event monitoring related to the SLAES:
•Pattern Definition: This is to help the clinician define the pattern of the AE and give some clarity
to timing of an event.
•Change/Outcome-This should be captured in order to help the clinician make a clear decision on
a severity rating and better follow the AE through time.
•Action Taken-The action taken after the report of an AE can be captured by the definitions
below:

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 10 of 25 1.0 BACKGROUND 
A clinical research subject who has been exposed to an investigational gene therapy may be at 
risk for delayed adverse events because of the vector that delivers the transgene or because of persistent biological activity of the investigational m edicinal product. Some adverse events  could 
be delayed by months or years. Therefore, to mitigate those risks, and per the United States Food and Drug Administration recommendations for the long- term follow -up observation of subjects 
who received gene ther apy products, Study ADVM-043-03 is to be conducted in subjects 
previously treated with  ADVM -043 and will follow them for a total of 3 years post treatment. 
The advantage of adeno -associated viral ( AAV ) vectors in gene therapy is the low propensity of 
vector genome integration in the host DNA. However, recently there has been attention to potential AAV -induced genotoxicity from systemic or liver -directed gene therapy . To date, 
mouse studies have varied in their findings in neonatal, juvenile, and  adult animals . 
AAV genome integration has been observed in neonatal mice that demonstrated a higher risk of developing hepatocell ular carcinoma after AAV administration ( Bell 2005; Chandler 2015). This 
insertional mutagenesis to an oncogenic locus (Rian) reported after neonatal gene delivery is thought to be influenced by higher transcriptional activity of that locus during the neonatal period of development, as juvenile and adult rodents have not demonstrated similar findings. Furthermore, the site of AAV integration in mice has no analogue in humans ( Bell 2005; 
Chandler 2015). Long-term larger animal studies in dogs (through 8 years) and nonhuman primates (through 5 years) have not shown such genotoxicity ( Niemeyer 2009; Nathwani 2011).  
To date, there has been no evidence of tumor formation or long- term hepatotoxicity in a 
hemophilia B gene therapy trial where 10 subjects were treated with systemic AAV . The study 
demonstrated durable and stable expression of transgenic factor IX at therape utic levels for at 
least 4 years after vector delivery ( Nathwani 2014 ). 
In alpha -1 antitrypsin (A1AT) deficiency, intramuscular delivery of an AAV1 vector containing 
a functional A1AT transgene was administered to 18  human subjects ( Gruntman 2015). One of 
the subjects in the highest dose group followed for at least 5 years post- treatment for safety and 
protein expression still demonstrated measurable A1AT levels without any negative sequelae (Mueller 2017). This suggests gene therapy has the potential for long-term protein expression 
and consequent disease impact .  
 
 
Study ADVM -043-
03 is a post- treatmen
t long -term follow -up study intended to collect safety 
data in subjects with A1AT  deficiency who received ADVM -043 in a prior  treatment  study. 
No investigational agent will be administered in Study ADVM-043-03.

6.0 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
6.1 Safety Parameters  
• Adverse events  
6.2 Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled subject, regardless of its causal 
relationship to the investigational medicinal product. Only AEs of inter est should be collected 
and reported. 
Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc. ADVM -043 (AAVrh.10hA1AT)  
Protocol ADVM -043-03 Amendment 2 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 14 of 25 AEs of interest include the following : 
• new malignancy 
• new incidence or exacerbation of a pre -existing neurologic disorder 
• new incidence or exacerbation of a prior rheumatologic or other autoimmune disorder 
• unexpected hospitalization  
6.3 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence in an enrolled subject that results in death; is 
immediately life -threatening; requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospita lization; results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; or is a congenital 
anomaly or birth defect. Only SAEs related to ADVM -043 should be collected and reported.  
6.4 Assessment of Severity  
The severity or intensity of an AE refers to the ext ent to which an AE affects the subject’s daily 
activities . The intensity of the AE will be rated according to the Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) ( National Cancer Institute 2017):  
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated. 
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age-appropriate instrumental activity of daily living (preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money). 
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -
care activi ty of daily living (bathing, dressing, and undressing, feeding self, using the 
toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden). 
• Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated. 
• Grade 5: Death related to AE.  
Changes in the severity of an AE should be documented to allow an assessment of the duration of the event at each level of severity . AEs characterized as intermittent do not require 
documentation of onset and duration of each episode. 
6.5 Assessment of Causality  
The Investigator ’s assess ment of relationship of an AE to ADVM -043 is part of the 
documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported. If there is 
any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event is to be reported. 
Adverum Biotechnologies, Inc. ADVM -043 (AAVrh.10hA1AT)  
Protocol ADVM -043-03 Amendment 2 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 15 of 25 Investigator should assess potential causes of each AE  and events should be considered related if 
there is “a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship” rather than if “a causal relationship 
cannot be ruled out.” When assessing causality, Investigators should assess biological balancing — the probability that the suspect drug caused the AE must be weighed against the probability that an alternative candidate caused it.  
Causality of AEs should be assessed in relation to ADVM-043, and not prior concomitant medicati ons or study procedures in the previous treatment study. The relationship or association 
of ADVM -043 in causing or contributing to the AE is to be characterized using the following 
criteria:  
• Definitely Related: A definite causal relationship exists between  study drug 
administration and the AE; including a plausible time relationship to study drug administration, and it cannot be explained by underlying or concurrent disease or other drugs/exposures. 
• Likely Related:  There is a reasonable possibility that th e study drug caused the AE ; 
the event is unlikely attributed to underlying or concurrent disease or other drugs/exposures ( i.e., alternative explanation) . There is a reasonable time sequence to 
administration of the study drug. 
• Unlikely Related:  Underlying or concurrent disease or other drugs/exposures provide plausible alternative explanations. Temporal relationship to study drug administration makes a causal relationship improbable. 
• Not Related: There is no association between the study drug and the reported event; there is a clear alternative explanation; a causal relationship is non -plausible. 
6.6 Safety Assessment Method and Timing  
At each study assessment conducted either in  the clinic or by telephone, the Investigator or 
designee will ask the subject non -leading questions to obtain reports of any change in medical 
condition or diagnosis consistent with the AE s of interest or SAE s related to ADVM -043 
(Section 6.2 and Section  6.3). 
A plan for scheduled visits with an HCP to elicit and record new findings for each study subject, including history, physical examination, or laboratory testing will be included in the study manual in accordance with the FDA guidance on the design of long term follow-up observational studies for the collection of data on delayed adverse events following administration of gene therapy products ( FDA Draft Guidance for Industry 2018). 
Information to be collected includes event term per CTCAE Version 5.0 ( National Cancer 
Institute 2017); date of onset; Investigator assessment of seriousness, severity, and relationship to ADVM -043; date of resolution of the event; any required concomitant medication  or treatment ; 
evaluations for malignancies and results such as biopsy results; and outcome.

Protocol ADVM -043-03 Amendment 2 
 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 16 of 25 6.7 Adverse Event Reporting  
The Investigator or designee is to be responsible for collecting all events that meet the definition 
of AE s of interest  (Section 6.2). AEs of interest should be recorded on the CRF by the 
Investigator or designee 
6.8 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
SAEs related to ADVM -043 should be recorded on the CRF by the Investigator or designee 
(Section  6.3).  The Investigator must report a related SAE to the Sponsor within 24 hours of 
awareness of the event to meet regulatory and patient safety obligations. For additional details on 
reporting of safety reports please refer to the Investigator Study Manual. 
6.9 Follow- up of S ubject s Reporting an A dverse Event 
SAEs related to ADVM -043 and AEs of interest should be followed until satisfactory resol ution 
or until the Investigator deems the event to be stable.  
6.10  Request for A utopsy in the Event of a S ubject Death 
In the event of a subject death while participating in the study, the Investigator should request a 
full autopsy to determine the precise cause of death. If possible, samples of tissues obtained at autopsy should be evaluated for the presence of the AAV genome. 
7.0 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICACY  
Not applicable 8.0 STATISTICAL PLAN  
Descriptive and exploratory analyses are to be performed on all data to gain insight into the 
safety of ADVM -043. A dverse event  data are to be analyzed overall, by dose level administered, 
and by study. Refer to the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
9.0 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 19 of 25 11.2 Protocol Deviations 
A protocol deviation is any change, divergence, or departure from the procedures and processes 
as specified in the protocol. A significant protocol deviation occurs when there is nonadherence to the protocol that might significantly (a) impact the completeness, reliability, and  / or accuracy 
of the study data, or (b) affect a subject’s rights, safety, or well-being. The Investigator or designee must document and explain any protocol deviation in the subject’s source documentation. Any significant protocol deviation will be investigated and reported by the Sponsor and may lead to the subject being withdrawn from the study, termination of the Investigator’s participation in the study, and / or other actions. 
The Sponsor will be notified of known significant protocol deviations by the Investigator. 
Protocol deviations found throughout the course of monitoring visits are to be documented by the clinical monitor. The IEC  / IBC should be notified of all protocol deviations in a timely manner 
by the Investigator. 
11.3 Confidentiality  
Investigator s must comply with all applicable privacy laws and regulations (e.g., HIPAA). 
Information on maintaining subject confidentiality in accordance with individual local and 
national subject privacy regulations must be provided to each subject as part of the informed consent process, either as part of the ICF or as a separate signed document. In the United States, a site -specific HIPAA -compliant authorization form may be used. The Investigator or designee 
must explain to each subject that for the evaluation of study results and potential marketing approval, the subject’s protected health information obtained during the study may be disclosed to the Sponsor and its designees, regulatory agencies, and the IEC / IBC.  
It is the Investigator’s or designee’s responsibility to obtain written permission to use protected 
health information from each subject. If a subject withdraws permission to use protected health information, it is the Investigator’s responsibility to obtain the withdrawal request in writing from the subject and to ensure that no further data will be collected from the subject or used or disclosed except as necessary to protect the integrity of the study. Any data collected on the subject before withdrawal will be used by Sponsor and / or its designees in the analysis of study results in order to protect the integrity of the study. During the review of source documents by the monitors or auditors, the confidentiality of the subject will be respected in accordance with applicable professional standards and regulations. 
11.4 Investigator ’s Report  to the IEC / IBC  
The Investigator is responsible for providing written summaries of the progress and status of the 
study at intervals not exceeding 1 year or otherwise specified by the IEC / IBC.  
Upon completion of the study, the Investigator, where applicable, should submit to the IEC / IBC 
the summary of the study outcome.

 CONFIDENTIAL  Page 20 of 25 11.5 Records Retention  
The Investigator is responsible for retaining documents as required by local law and applicable 
regulations, as well as ICH standards. Essential documents should be retained until  
 after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no 
pending or contempl
ated marketing applications in an ICH region; or until  have 
elapsed sinc
e the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational medicinal 
product. These documents should be retained for a longer period if required by the applicable 
regulatory requirements or by an agreement with the Sponsor. It is the responsibility of the Sponsor to inform the Investigator or institution as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
11.6 Financial Disclosure  
 
 For this study, each p
 rincipal Investigator and sub-Investigator (as 
designated on the Form FDA1572) will provide a personally signed Financial Disclosure Form in accordance with 21 CFR Part 54. Each Investigator will notify the Sponsor or its authorized representative of any relevant changes in financial disclosure information during the conduct of the study and for 1 year a fter the study has been completed. 
11.7 Liability and Insurance  
 
 
 
In the event of 
a side effect or injury, appropriate medical care as determined by the treating 
physician/designee will
 be provided. The ICF will include a description of treatment in the event 
of a protocol-related injury and handling of the costs associated therewith, incorporating country- specific national regulations and / or local laws.

12.1 Monitoring of the Study  
All aspects of the study will be monitored by the Sponsor or designee for compliance with 
applicable government regulation with respect to GCP and standard operating procedures. 
Investigators and institutions involved in the study will permit study-related monitoring, audits, 
IEC review, and regulatory agency inspections, including by providing direct access to all study records.  
In the event of an audit, the Investigator agrees to allow the Sponsor, representatives of the Sponsor, or applicable regulatory agencies an access to all study records. The Investigator should promptly notify the Sponsor or designee of any audits scheduled by any regulatory authorities and promptly forward copies of any audit reports to the Sponsor. 
12.2 Data Quality Assurance 
The Sponsor shall implement and maintain quality control and quality assurance procedures to 
ensure that the study is conducted, and that data are generated, documented, and reported in compliance with the protocol, GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements. This study shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki (October 2008) and all rev isions thereof, and in accordance with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
regulations (21 CFR Parts  11, 50, 54, 56, and 312, Subpart D—Responsibilities of Sponsors and 
Investigators) and with the ICH guidelines on GCP (ICH E6). 
12.3 Data Management 
The Investigator  will prepare and maintain adequate and accurate source documents designed to 
record all observations and other pertinent data for each subject treated with the study drug. 
The Investigator or other study personnel will enter information from the source documents onto 
case report forms (CRFs) that will be used to collect the clinical study data. A CRF  must be 
completed for each enrolled subject with all required study data accurately recorded such that the 
information matches the data contained in m edical records ( e.g., physicians’ notes, nurses’ notes, 
clinic charts, and other study- specific source documents).  
Authorized study site personnel ( i.e., listed on the Delegation of Authority log) will complete 
CRFs designed for this study according to the completion guidelines that will be provided. The Investigator will ensure that the CRFs are accurate, complete, legible, and completed within a reasonable period of time. At all times, the Investigator has final responsibility for the accuracy and authent icity of all clinical data.  
Study staff will be appropriately trained in the use of CRFs.

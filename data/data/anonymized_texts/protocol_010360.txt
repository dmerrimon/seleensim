 1 Introduction  
This statistical analysis plan (SAP) describes all planned analyses for the clinical study report 
(CSR) of study CPDR001E2201, a single arm phase II, open -label study of PDR001 for the 
treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic well-differentiated, non-functional 
neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic, gastrointestinal (GI), or thoracic origin  or poorly -
differentiated gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (GEP -NEC), that  have 
progressed on prior treatment . 
The content of this SAP is based on p rotocol CPDR001E2201, version 03. The primary  
rationale for protocol amendment 3 is to remove the possibility to expand the study  to Part 2 
when at least 20% overall response rate (ORR) per RECIST 1.1 by central radiology  review is 
observed in any of the c ohorts of the well -differentiated NET group. Based on the results of the 
interim analysis ( IA), there was a change in the clinical development strategy for PDR001, 
which will no longer be developed as a single agent immunotherapy in NET, and the study will  
not be expanded into Part 2.  
All decisions regarding final analysis, as defined in the SAP document, have been made prior 
to database lock of the study data.  
1.1 Study design  
 
This is a single arm  Phase II  , open -label, multi -center study   evaluating   safety and efficacy 
of PDR001 in patients with advanced or metastatic well-differentiated, non-functional 
neuroendocrine tumors of pancreatic, GI, or thoracic origin  or poorly -differentiated 
gastroenteropancreatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, that  have progre ssed on prior treatment .  
   
The study will enroll approximately 90 patients in the well -differentiated NET group 
(approximately 30 patients in each of the three cohorts of pancreatic, GI, and thoracic origins) 
and approximately 20 patients in the GEP -NEC group for a total of approximately 110 
patients.  
 
Overall response rate (ORR)  in well -differentiated NET and poorly -differentiated GEP -NEC 
groups , as assessed by  Blinded Indepdent Review Committee ( BIRC ) review of tumor response 
and using RECIST 1.1  criteria, is the primary endpoint in this study.  Duration of response  (DoR) 
is the key s econdary endpoint.  
 
One interim analysis is planned after at least  30 patients in the well -differentiated NET group 
have undergone the first 3 radiological assessments (expected around week 24) or have shown 
disease progression or have discontinued efficacy follow -up for any other reason.  All available 
efficacy and safety data from well -differentiated NET and poorly differentiated GEP -NEC 
groups up to the cut -off date wi ll be used for the IA  
 
Cut-off date for the primary analysis will be 1 year after Last Patient First Treatment (LPFT)  in 
the initially enrolled well -differentiated NET group .

 2 Statistical methods  
2.1 Data analysis  general information  
The interim and final analys es will be performed by Novartis . SAS version 9.4 or later software 
will be us ed to perform all data analyses  and to generate tables, figures and listings.  
There are 1 interim and a primary  analysis  planned for the primary efficacy endpoint.  
The analysis cut -off date for the interim  analysis  will be established after 30 enrolled patients 
have completed 3 radiological assessments (approximately after 24 weeks of treatment ) or  have 
shown disease progression or have discontinued efficacy  follow -up for any other reason.  The 
analysis cut -off date for the primary analysis of study data will be 1 year after LPFT in the 
initially enrolled well -differentiated NET group . The primary analysis data will be summarized 
in the clinical study report (CSR).  
For each of the analyses, all statistical anal yses will be performed using  all data  colle cted in the 
database up  to the data cutoff  date.  All data with an assessment  date or event  start date (e.g. 
vital sign assessment  date or start date of an adverse  event)  prior  to or on the cut-off date will 
be included  in the analysis. Any data  collected  beyond the cut-off date will not be included  in 
the analysis and will not be used for any derivations.  
All events with start date  before or on the cut -off date and end date  after the cut -off date will be 
reported as ongoing . The same rule will be applied to events starting before or on the cut -off 
date and not having documented end date.  This approach applies, in particular, to adverse event 

Novartis  Confidential  Page 9 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 and concomitant medication reports. For these events, the end date will not be imputed and 
therefore will not appear in the listings.  
All analyses will be performed separately for the two groups of well -differentiated NET and 
poorly -differentiated GEP -NEC unless otherwise specified.  
 
General analysis conventions  
Pooling of center s: Unless specified otherwise, data from all study centers will be pooled  for 
the analysis. Due to expected small number of pat ients enrolled at   centers, no center eff ect 
will be assessed.  
Qualitative data  (e.g., gender, race, etc.) will be summarized by means of contingency 
tables; a missing category will be included as applicable. Percentages will be  calculated using 
the number of patients in the relevant population or subgroup as the  denominator.  
Quantitative data  (e.g., age, body weight, etc.) will be summarized by appropriate  
descriptive statistics (i.e. mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) . 
2.1.1  General d efinition s  
Investigational  drug and study treatment  
In this single -arm study  evaluating efficacy and safety of  spartalizumab ( PDR001 ) as 
monotherapy, investigational  drug  or investigational trea tment , will refer to  the PDR001 .  
The term investigational treatment may also be referred to as study treatment  which is used 
throug hout this document.  
Date of first administration of investigational  drug  
The date of first administration of investigational  drug is defined as the first date  when a non -
zero dose of investigational  drug is administered and recorded on the Dosage Administration 
Record (DAR ) (e)CRF . The date of first administration of study drug will also be referred as 
start of investigational  drug.  
Date of last administration of investigational  drug  
The date of last administration of investigational  drug is defined as the last date when a nonzero 
dose of investigational  drug is administered and recorded on DAR eCRF.  The date of last 
administration of investigational  drug will a lso be referred as end of investigational  drug.  
Date of first administration of study treatment  
The date of first administration of study treatment  is the same as the date of first administration 
of investigational drug or control  drug.  
Date of last administration of study treatment  
The date of last administration of study treatment  is the same as the date of last administration 
of investigational drug or control drug. 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 10 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 Study day  
The study day, describes the day of the event or assessment date, relative to the reference start 
date.  
The study day is defined as:  
 The date of the event (visit date, onset date of an event, assessment date etc.)  − 
reference start date + 1 if event is on or af ter the reference start dat e; 
 The date of the event (visit date, onset date of an event, assessment date etc.) − 
reference start date if event precedes the reference start dat e. 
 
The reference date for all assessments (safety, efficacy, PK, PRO, etc) is the start of study 
treatment.  
The study day will be displayed in the data listings.  If an event  starts  before  the reference start 
date,  the study day displa yed on the listing will be negative.  
Time unit  
A year length is defined as 365.25 days. A month length is 30.4375 days (365.25/12). If duration 
is reporte d in months, duration in days will be  divided b y 30.4375.  If duration is  reported in 
years, duration in days will be divided by 365.25.  
Baseline  
For safety and efficacy evaluations, the last available  assessment on or before the date of start 
of study treatment is defined as “baseline” assessment.   
If patients have no value as defined above , the baseline result will be missing . 
On-treatment assessmen t/event  and observation periods  
For adverse event reporting t he overall observation period will be divided into three mutually 
exclusive segments:  
1. pre-treatment period : from day of patient’s informed consent to the day before first 
administration of study treatment  
2. on-treatment period : from date of first administration of study treatment  to 30 days after 
date of last actual administration of  any study treatment (including start and stop date)  
3. post-treatment period : starting at day 31 after last admini stration of  study treatment . 
Safety summaries (tables, figures) include only data from the on -treatment period with the 
exception of baseline data which will also be summarized where appropriate (e.g. change from 
baseline summaries). In addition, a separate summary for death including on treatment and post 
treatment deaths will be provided.   In particular, s ummary tables for adverse events (AEs)  will 
summarize only on -treatment events , with a start date during the on -treatment period 
(treatment -emerg ent AEs).   
Novartis  Confidential  Page 11 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 Additional summaries will be displayed to report deaths, all AEs, AEs related to study treatment, 
all SAEs and SAEs related to study treatment collected up to 150 days after last administration 
of PDR001.  
However, a ll safety data  (including th ose from the post -treatment period)  will be listed and 
those collected during the pre -treatment and post -treatment period will be flagged.  
Last contact date  
The last contact date will be derived for patients not known to have died at the analysis cut -off 
using the last complete date among the following:  
 
Table 2-1 Last contact date data sources   
Source data  Conditions  
Last contac t date/last date patient was known to 
be alive  from Survival Follow -up page  
 - Patient status is reported to be alive, lost to 
follow -up or unknown.  
Start/End dates from  further antineoplastic 
therapy  Non-missing medication/procedure term.  
Start/End* dates from drug administration record  
 Non-missing dose. Doses of 0 are allowed.  
End of treatment date  from end of treatment page  
 No condition.  
Tumor  (RECIST /irRECIST ) assessment date  
 Evaluation is marked as ‘done’.  
Verification for treatment beyond RECIST 1.1 PD  At least one non -missing parameter  value  
Laboratory/PK collection dates  
 Sample collection marked as ‘done’.  
Vital signs da te 
 At least one non -missing parameter value  
Performance Status date  
 Non-missing performance status  
Start/End dates of AE  Non-missing verbatim term  
 
The last contact date is defined as the latest complete date from the above list on or before the 
data cut-off date . The cut -off date will not be used for last contact date, unless the patient was 
seen or contacted  on that date. No date post cut -off date will be used. Completely imputed  
dates  (e.g. the analysis cut-off date programmaticall y imputed to replac e the missing  end date 
of a dose administration  record)  will not be used  to derive  the last contact dat e. Partial date 
imputation is allowed for event (death)/censoring is coming from ‘Survival information’ eCRF.  
The last contact date will be  used for censoring of patient s in the analysis of overall survival .

SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 2.2 Analysis sets  
Full Analysis Set  
The Full Analysi s Set (FAS) comprises all patients to whom study treatment has been assigned 
and who received one dose of any study treatment (i.e. at least one dose of PDR001 (including 
incomplete infusion)).   
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment they ha ve been assigned to.  
Safety  
The Safety Set is defined in the same way as the FAS and includes all patients who received at 
least one dose of study treatment (i.e. at least one dose of the PDR001 (including incomplete 
infusion).  
Pharmacokinetic analysis set (PAS)  
The Pharmacokinetic analysis set (PAS)  includes all patients who provide at least one evaluable 
PDR001 PK concentration. For a concentration to be evaluable, patients are required to:  
 receive one of the planned treatments of PDR001 prior to sampling  
 for pre -dose samples, have the sample collected before the next dose administration  
 for end -of-infusion samples, have the sample collected within 2 hours post end of infusion  
Immunogenicity (IG) analysis sets  
The Immunogenicity prevalence set inc ludes all subjects in the Full analysis set with a 
determinant baseline IG sample or at least one determinant post -baseline IG sample.  
The Immunogenicity incidence set includes all subjects in the Immunogenicity prevalence set 
with a determinant baseline IG sample and at least one determinant post -baseline IG sample.      
See Section 2.9.1.1 for the definition of determinant.  
Patient Classification :  
Patients may be excluded from the analysis populations defined above based on the protocol 
deviations enter ed in the database and/or on specific subject classification rules defined in Table 
2-3.

SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 Immunogenicity incidence set  No written inform c onsent  No determinant baseline and 
post-baseline IG sample  
Withdrawal of Informed Consent  
Any data collected in the clinical database after a subject withdraws informed consent from all 
further participation in the trial, will not be included in the analysis. The date on which a patient 
withdraws full consent is recorded in the eCRF .   
 
 
 
2.2.1  Subgroup of interest  
Subgroup analyses will be only performed in well -differentiated NET group.  
Efficacy  
The overall response rate  will be summarized by the following subgroups to examine the 
homogeneity of treatment effect provided that the study meets the pre -specified criteria for 
primary efficacy based on the FAS :  
 Cohort   
 Sex  
 Race  
 PD-L1 expression with analyses for the following thresholds:  
 <1% vs ≥ 1% 
 <5% vs ≥ 5% 
 <10% vs ≥ 10% 
 <50% vs ≥ 50%   
 Age category (<  65 years, ≥65 years)  
 Tumor grade   
 ECOG PS  
 Occurrence of at least one immune -related AE (yes, no)  
 
Summary tables will only be produced if sufficient number of patients is present in each 
subgroup. Only the point estimate of the overall response rate  and 95%-confidence intervals 
will be provided (see Sections 2.5  for further analysis details) . The objective of the efficacy 
subgroup analysis is to demonstrate homogeneity of treatment effect in the above subgr oups.  

Novartis  Confidential  Page 14 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 Safety  
Safety subgroup analyses will use the same method as for the analysis in the overall analysis 
set. Key safety analyses  (deaths, SAEs, AESIs,  AEs leading to discontinuations)  will be 
repeated on safety set in the following subgroups:  
 Cohort  
 Age group (< 65 years, ≥  65 years)  
 Sex 
 Race  
 Ethnicity  
 
The objective  for carrying out these  subgroup  analyses is to identif y potential  safety issues 
that may be limited  to a subgroup  of patients,  or safety issues  that are more  commonly 
observed in a subgroup of patients.   
Summary tables will only be p roduc ed if sufficient number of patients is  present in each 
subgroup. Some grouping of classes will be considered for  race and ethnicity.  
2.3 Patient disposition, demographics  and other baseline 
characteristics  
 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be used for all baseline and demographic summaries and 
listings unless otherwise specified .  
Basic demographic and background data  
All demographic and baseline disease characteristics data will be summarize d and listed. 
Categorical data (e.g. sex, age groups: < 65 and ≥ 65 years, race, et hnicity, ECOG performance 
status , PD-L1 status ) will be summarized by f requency counts and percentages ; the number and 
percentage of patients with missing data will be provid ed. Continuous data (e.g. age, weight, 
height, body surface area, body mass index ) will be summarized by descriptive statistics ( N, 
mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum ).  
BMI (kg/m2) will be calculated as weight[kg] / (height[m]2) using w eight at Baseline.  
Diagnosis and extent of cancer  
Summary statistics  will be tabulated  for diagnosis  and extent  of cancer.  This analysis will 
include  the following:  primar y site of cancer,  details of tumor histology/cytology,  
histological  grade,  stage at initial diagnosis, time since initial diagnosis, time from initial 
diagnosis to first recurrence/progression (in months), time since most recent relapse/progression 
to start of study treatment  (in months),  stage at time of study entry, presence/ab sence of target 
and non -target lesions, number and type of metastatic sites involved.

 2.4 Treatments (study treatment, rescue medication, concomitant 
therapies, compliance)  
2.4.1  Study treatment / compliance  
Duration of exposure, actual cumulative dose, dose intensity  (DI) and relative dose intensity  
(RDI)  will be summarized  for PDR001 . Duration of exposure  will be categorized into time 
intervals; frequency counts and percentages will be presented for the numb er(%) of subject s in 
each interval . The number  (%) of subject s who have dose reductions  or interruptions, and the 
reasons, will be summarized.  
Subject level l istings  of all doses administered on treatment  along with dose change  reasons 
will be produced.   
The safety  set will be used for all summaries and listings of study treatment .  
Duration of exposure to study treatment  
Duration of exposure to study treatment is considered by taking into account the duration of 
exposure to  PDR001 : 
Duration of exposure t o study treatment ( days) = ( last date of exposure to study treatment) – 
(date of first administration of study treatment) + 1.  
The last date of exposure to study treatment is the planned end date of the last cycle in which 
the last non -zero dose of PDR001  was last administered (i.e last date of administration + 27 
day)) . If the patient died or was lost to follow -up before the derived last dat e, the last date of 
exposure is the date of death or the date of last contact, respectively. If the derived last dat e of 
exposure goes beyond the data cutoff date, it should be truncated to the date of data cutoff.  
Summary of duration of exposure of PDR001  will include categorical summaries based on 28 
days interval  and using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation etc).  
Cumulative dose  
Cumulative dose  of a study treatment  is defined as the total dose given during the study 
treatment exposure and will be summarized for PDR001 .  
The planned cumulative dose  for PDR001  refers to the total planned  dose as per the protocol 
up to the last date of the administration.  
The actual  cumulative dose   refers to the total actual dose administered, over the duration for 
which the subject  is on the study treatment as documented in the Dose Administration eCRF .  
The actual cumulative dose will be defined based on the days when the subject is assumed to 
have taken a non -zerodose during dosing periods.  
For patients who did not take any drug the cumulative dose is by d efinition equal to zero . 
Dose intensity and relative dose intensity  
Dose intensity  (DI) for patients with non -zero duration of exposure is  defined as follows:  
Novartis  Confidential  Page 17 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 DI (mg / week ) = Actual Cumulative dose ( mg / week )  / Duration of exposure to study treatment 
(mg / week ). 
For patients who did not take any drug the DI is by definition equal to zero .  
Planned dose intensity (P DI) is defined as follows:  
PDI (mg / week )  = Planned Cumulative dose (mg / week )  / Duration of exposure (mg / week ). 
Relative dose intensity  (RDI)  is defined as follows:  
RDI = DI (mg / week )   / PDI (mg / week ).   
Dose reductions, interruptions or permanent discontinuations  
The number of subject s who have dose reductions , permanent discontinuations , administration 
stopped/paused during the infusion  or interruptions, and the reasons, will be summarized.  
‘Dose interrupted’, “Was drug administration stopped or paused“ and ‘Dose permanently 
discontinued’ fields from the Dosage Administration CRF  pages  (DAR)  will be used to 
determine the dose reductions , dose interruptions, administration stopped/paused and 
permanent discontinuations, respectively.  
The corresponding fields ‘Reason for dose change/dose interrupted’ , ‘Reason for administration 
stopped or paused’  and ‘Reason for permanent  discontinuation’ will be used to summarize the 
reasons.  
A dose change is either ‘change in prescribed dose level’ or ‘dosing error’ where actual dose 
administered/total daily dose is different from the prescribed dose . 
For the purpose of summarizing inter ruptions and reasons, in case multiple entries for 
interruption that are entered on consecutive d ose administrations  with different reasons will be 
counted as separate interruptions. However, if the reason is the same in this mentioned multiple 
entries on consecutive d ose administrations , then it will be counted as one interruption.  
Reduction : A dose change where the prescribed dose level is lower than the previous prescribed 
dose level , where the regimen schedule is modified (less frequent administration of drug 
compared to previous regimen) or where the actual dose administered/total daily dose is lower 
than the calculated dose amount based on the  prescribed dose. Therefore any dose change to 
correct a dosing error will not be considered a dose reduction.   Only  dose change  is collected 
in the CRF, number of reductions will be derived programmatically  based on the change and 
the  direction of the change.  
Treatment beyond RECIST1.1 progression  
The number of patients who continue treatment beyond RECIST1.1 progression according to 
BIRC assessment will be summarized. It includes all patients who received at least one dose of 
PDR001 (including incomplete infusion) after BIRC  RECIST1.1 progression.  
2.4.2  Prior , concomitant  and post  therap ies 
The number and percentage of patients who received any prior anti -neoplastic medications, 
prior anti -neoplastic radiotherapy or prior anti -neoplastic surgery will be summarized for all 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 18 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 patients . Prior anti -neoplastic medications will be summarized by thera py type (e.g. 
chemothera py, hormonal thera py, immune -oncology therapy  etc.), setting (e.g. adjuvant, 
metastatic, etc.) and also by lowest ATC class  and preferred term. Summaries will include total 
number of regimens, best response and time from last treatment to progression for the last 
therapy.  The medication therapy type of any combination therapy will be classified based on 
the following order: immune -oncology therapy, chemotherapy, biologic therapy  (other than 
immune -oncologic therapy) , targeted t herapy, hormonal therapy. For example, a combination 
therapy of chemotherapy and hormonal therapy will be classified as ‘chemotherapy’.  For 
radiotherapy, time since last radiotherapy, locations and setting of last therapy will be 
summarized . For prior surg ery, time since last surgery, procedure and residual disease of last 
therapy will be summarized.  
Separat e listings  will be produced  for prior  anti-neoplastic medications,  radiothera py, and 
surger y.  
Anti-neoplastic medications will be coded using the WHO Drug Dictionary (WHO -DD); anti-
neoplastic surgery will be coded using MedDRA. Details regarding MedDRA and WHO -DD 
version will be included in the footnote in the tables/listings.  
The above analyses will be performed using  the FAS.  
Post treatment anti -canc er therapy  
Anti-neoplastic therapies since discontinuation of study treatment will be lis ted and summarized 
by ATC class and  preferred term, by means of frequency counts and percentages using FAS.  
Concomitant medications  
Concomitant therapy is defined as all interventions (therapeutic treatments and procedures) 
other than the study treatment administered to a patient  coinciding with the study treatment 
period.  Concomitant therapy include m edications (other than study drugs ) starting on or after 
the start date of study treatment or medications starting prior to the start date of study treatment 
and continuing after the start date of study treatment.  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization ( WHO) Drug 
Reference  Listing  (DRL)  dictionary  that  employs  the  WHO  Anatomical  Therapeutic 
Chemical (ATC) classification system and summarized by lowest ATC class and preferred term  
using frequency counts and percentages . Surgical and medical proced ures will be coded using 
MedDRA and summarized by SOC and preferred term.  Concomitant medications with 
immunosuppressive intent will be summarized by lowest ATC class and preferred term using 
frequency counts and percentages . Concomitant medications with i mmunosuppressive intent 
will be summarized by lowest ATC class and preferred term using frequency counts and 
percentages.  These summaries will includ e: 
1. Medications starting on or after the start of study treatment  but no later than 30 days 
after start of l ast dose of study treatment  and 
2. Medications starting prior to start of study treatment and continuing after the start of 
study treatment . 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 19 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 Additional summaries will be provided to report medications starting between 31 days after last 
dose of study PDR001 and 150 days after last dose of PDR001.  
The safety set will be used for all concomitant medication tables.  
Duration of exposure to concomitant medication with immunosuppressive intent (days) = (last 
date of exposure t o concomitant medication with immunosuppressive intent) – (date of first 
administration of concomitant medication with immunosuppressive intent) + 1  
Duration of exposure to concomitant medication with immunosuppressive intent will be 
summarized if relevant . In addition, the duration of exposure for the subset of subjects who 
experienced events of interest (i.e. AESIs, patients treated with concomitant medication with 
immunosuppressive intent) may be summarized. Descrip tive statistics such as median, min, 
max will be presented.  
Time to initiation of concomitant medication with immunosuppressive intent is the time from 
start of treatment with PDR001  to first administration of concomitant medication with 
immunosuppressive intent. Patients who did not receive co ncomitant medication with 
immunosuppressive intent will be censored .The censoring date will be the earliest of the 
following dates:  
 death date,  
 new anticancer antineoplastic therapy start date,  
 end date of on -treatment period,   
 data cut -off date,  
 withd rawal of informed consent date.  
Time to initiation of concomitant medication with immunosuppressive intent will be 
summarized if relevant. Kaplan -Meier curves will be displayed as well as median and 95% 
confidence intervals for each treatment arm. In addit ion, time to occurrence for the subset of 
subjects who experienced events of interest (i.e. AESIs, patients treated with concomitant 
medication with immunosuppressive intent) may be summarized. Descripive statistics such as 
median, min, max will be present ed. 
2.5 Analysis of the primary objective  
The primary objective is to estimate the antitumor activity of PDR001 as a single agent in well -
differentiated NET and poorly -differentiated GEP -NEC groups.  
2.5.1  Primary endpoint  
ORR is defined as the proportion of patients  with best overall response  (BOR)  of complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1 (see  Appendix 1  of the study 
protocol).  ORR will be calculated within each group based on the FAS using BIRC review of 
tumor assessment data.  Patients with only non -measurable disease at baseline will be part of the 
analysis and will be included in the numerator only if a complete response was observed . Tumor 
asses sments  performed before the start of any further antineoplastic therapy (i.e. any additional 
secondary antineoplastic therapy or surgery ) will be considered in the assessment of BOR. 
Limited -field palliative radiotherapy administered as concomitant therapy per protocol will not 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 20 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 be considered as new antineoplastic therapy.  Localized radi otherapy and treatment with 
bisphosphonates for pre -existing, painful bone/liver metastases is permitted.  
2.5.2  Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis  
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on the FAS.  ORR  will be summarized  using 
descrip tive statistics (N,%) along with 2 -sided  exact 95% confidence interval (CI)  [Clopper and 
Pearson 1934] . 
Group 1: Well -differentiated NET  
In the absence of historical comparator in this setting, response rates reported in placebo arms 
of previous randomized  phase III studies in earlier lines of treatment can be considered as a 
valid historical reference for ORR (see  Table 1 -1 in the protocol ). Based on it, the response rate 
for placebo is expected to be ca. 3% and it is desired to ensure that the observed re sponse rate  
for PDR001  is significantly higher than expected placebo response rate . Furthermore, a 
response rate of 10% is considered clinically meaningful among patients with advanced NET 
of GI , pancreatic  or thoracic  origin.  
Therefore, the results in this group  will be considered a  success if both of the following 
conditions are met:  
1. a clinically relevant response rate of at least 10% is observed  
2. the two-sided exact 95% CI excludes the value 3%.  
With 90 patients  in the FAS , the se criteria correspond c orrespond  to at least 9 responders 
observed (i.e. a response rate of 10% with 95% CI : [4.7; 18.1]).  
Group 2: Poorly -differentiated GEP -NEC group  
This group will enroll approximately 20 patients. Estimates of the ORR along with 95% two -
sided CI  will be pre sented. Additionally,  the interval probabilities for the true ORR lying within 
the intervals stated below will be computed.  
 0 - <3%      unacceptable efficacy  
 3% - <10%     limited efficacy  
 10% - <20%   moderate efficacy  
 20%    clinically relevant effica cy     
 
For this analysis a prior distribution for the parameter of interest, ORR, must be specified. For 
the current study, the prior clinical assumption for PDR001 in the selected patient population is 
used in order to derive a minimally informative unim odal Beta prior distribution that reflects 
the level of uncertainty around ORR before starting the current trial ( Neuenschwander et al 
2008 ). The prior mean ORR is set to be equal to 15% and the parameters of the minimally 
informative Beta prior distributi on of ORR have been set up as follows:  
 a/(a+b) = 0.15  
 a = 0.176  
Novartis  Confidential  Page 21 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
  b = 1.0  
At the primary analysis, this prior distribution will be updated with observed ORR data and 
probabilities that the true ORR lies within the above intervals will be reported.  
2.5.3  Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations  
For the computation of ORR, all confirmed responses (CR or PR) reported up to the analysis 
cut-off will be included. Patients with no valid radiological assessment or unconfirmed 
responses will be considered as non-responders. In particular, patients with CR or PR at the last 
radiological assessment prior to cut -off and no response at the previous assessment are by 
definition unconfirmed and will be considered as non -responders for the primary analysis.  
Patients with unknown or missing best overall response (BOR) will be counted as non-
responders . If there is no baseline tumor assessment, all post -baseline overall lesion responses 
are expected to be ‘Unknown’.  If no valid post -baseline tumor assessments are availa ble, the 
best overall response must be  “Unknown” unless progression is reported.  For the computation 
of ORR, these patients will be included in the FAS and will be counted as ‘ non-responders ’. 
2.5.4  Supportive analyses  
A sensitivity analysis considering patients  with unconfirmed PR or CR (i.e. with PR or CR at 
the last assessment prior to the cutoff and ongoing in efficacy follow -up) as responders may be 
performed  if large  delayed treatment effect is observed .  
The analysis of ORR will be repeated based on local review.  
 
Concordance analysis of BOR  
An assessment of the concordance between BIRC assessment and local assessment of the Best 
Overall Response for each subject will be provided. The calculation will be based on the percent 
agreement (the proportion of re sponse outcomes that agree or match across both Independent 
Reviewer and Investigator Assessments):  
 Percent Agreement = (Number of matched responders + Number of matched non -responders) 
/ total number of subjects assessed.  
Subgroup analyses for the prima ry endpoint  
If both criteria for the primary efficacy analysis are met , the primary endpoint of ORR  will be 
summarized for the subgroups specified in Section 2.2.1  based on the primary analysis source 
(i.e. BIRC) and the same conventions as for the primary analysis.  
For each of the subgroups, the following analyses will be performed:  
 Proportion of patients with objective response  
 two-sided exact 95% CI  
Efficacy analyses in subgroups will be purely explora tory and are intended to explore the 
consistency of treatment effect.  
Novartis  Confidential  Page 22 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 Reasons for “Unknown” BOR  
Patients with ‘unknown’ BOR will be summarized by reason for having unknown status. The 
following reasons will be used:  
 No valid post -baseline assessment  
 All post-baseline assessments have overall lesion response UNK  
 New anti -neoplastic therapy started before first post -baseline assessment  
 SD or non -CR/non -PD too early   
 PD too late  
Note 1: A SD or Non -CR/Non -PD is considered as “SD too early”’ if the SD or No n-CR/Non -
PD is documented within first 6 weeks after treatment start date.  
Note 2: A PD is considered as “PD too late” if the first documentation of PD is recorded more 
than 12 weeks after treatment start date with no qualifying CR, PR or SD or Non -CR/Non -PD 
in between.   
Note 3: Special (and rare) cases where BOR is “unknown” due to both too early SD and too 
late PD will be classified as “SD too early”.  
Waterfall plot to depict anti -tumor activity  
Waterfall graphs will be used to depict the anti -tumor act ivity. These plots will display the best 
percentage change from baseline in the sum of diameters of all target lesions for each patient. 
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline will be included in the waterfall graphs.  
Special consideration is n eeded for assessments where the target lesion response is CR, PR or 
SD, but the appearance of a new lesion or a worsening of non -target lesions results in an overall 
lesion response of PD. As a conservative approach, such assessments will not be considered   
for  display as  bars  in  the  graph,  since  the  percentage  change  in  the  sum  of diameters of 
target lesions reflects the non -PD target lesion response, but the overall lesion response is PD. 
A patient with only such assessments will be represent ed by a special symbol (e.g. 
 ) in the 
waterfall graph. Assessments with “unknown” target lesion response and assessments with 
unknown overall response will be excluded from the waterfall plots. Patients without any valid 
assessments will be completely exc luded from the graphs.  
The total number of patients displayed in the graph will be shown and this number will be used 
as the denominator for calculating the percentages of patients with tumor shrinkage and tumor 
growth. Footnote will explain the reason for  excluding some patients (due to absence of any 
valid assessment).  
All possible assessment scenarios are described in Table 2 -4.

2.6 Analysis of the key secondary objective  
The key secondary objective in this study is to estimate efficacy of PDR001 using the  duration 
of response per RECIST 1.1 and based on tumor response data per BIRC.  
2.6.1  Key secondary endpoint  
Duration of response (DOR) only applies to patients whose best overall response is complete 
response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1 based on BIRC review of 
tumor assessment data. T he start date is the date of first documented response of CR or PR (i.e., 
the start date of response, not the date when response was confirmed), and the end date is 
defined as the date of the first documented progression or death due to underlying cancer.  
2.6.2  Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis  
DOR will be listed and summarized for all patients in the FAS with confirmed BOR of CR or 
PR. The duration  of response will be presented graphically along with the duration of on -study 
follow -up and information about responses.  The distribution of duration of response will be 
estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method and the median duration of response will be 
presented along with 95% confidence interval only if a sufficient number of responses is 
observe d. A responders -only analysis will also be performed in this case.  
2.6.3  Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations  
For DOR analysis patients continuing without progression or death due to underlying cancer 
will be censored at the date of their last a dequate tumor assessment using the censoring rule 
described for PFS analysis.  
2.7 Analysis of secondary efficacy objective (s) 
All secondary efficacy endpoints according to RECIST 1.1 or irRECIST will be based on tumor 
assessments as per BIRC. The local radiology assessments will be used as supportive analysis.   
Antitumor activity (assessed by ORR and DoR per RECIST 1.1 and BIRC) in each of the three 
well-differentiated NET cohorts (pancreatic, GI, thoracic) will also be evaluated as secondary 
endpoint.  
 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 24 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 2.7.1  Secondary endpoints  
Disease control rate (DCR)  
DCR is defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of CR, PR or SD 
according to RECIST 1.1 criteria and as per central review. DCR will be calculated using FAS 
and based on the BIRC tumor assessments .  
Time to response  
Time to response (CR or PR) is the time from date of treatment start  to first documented 
response of CR or PR (which must be confirmed subsequently) using BIRC  review of tumor 
assessment data and according to RECIST 1.1 . All patients in the FAS will be included in the 
time to response calculation. Patients who did not achieve a confirmed PR or CR will be 
censored at:  
 the maximum follow -up time (i.e. FPFV -  LPLV used for the analysis) for patients who 
had a PFS event (i. e. either progressed or died due to any cause);  
 the last adequate tumor assessment date for all other patients.  
Progression -free survival (PFS)  
PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose to the date of the first documented 
radiological progress ion or death due to any cause. PFS will be assessed via central review 
according to RECIST 1.1. PFS will be censored if no PFS event is observed before the analysis 
cut-off date.  
If a patient has not progressed or died  at the analysis cut -off date, PFS w ill be censored at the 
date of the last adequate tumor evaluation date before the cut -off date. PFS events documented 
after the initiation of new anti -neoplastic therapy (i.e. RECIST 1.1. documented disease 
progression or death) will be considered provided  tumor assessments continue after initiation 
of new cancer therapy.  Discontinuation due to disease progression (collected on the ‘End of 
treatment’ and ‘End of post treatment follow up’ disposition pages) without supporting 
objective evidence satisfying p rogression criteria per RECIST 1.1 will not be considered disease 
progression for PFS derivation.  
Efficacy endpoints according to irRECIST  
Immune related overall response rate (irORR)  is the proportion of patients with a best 
overall response of irCR or irPR based on BIRC  review of tumor assessment data.  
The best immune related overall response for each patient is determined from the sequence of 
immune related overall responses according to rules described in the irRECIST appendix of the 
protocol.  
Immune  related duration of overall response (irDOR):   For patients with a confirmed irCR 
or irPR based on BIRC  review of tumor assessment data. The start date is the date of first 
documented confirmed response and the end date and censoring is defined the same a s that for 
time to progression.  
Novartis  Confidential  Page 25 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 Date of confirmed response is derived as followed: Response (irPR or irCR) should be 
confirmed by a second assessment no less than 4 weeks after the first assessment showing 
response. Date of response is then the date of the  first of these two assessments. For 
confirmation of irCR the two assessments must be consecutive (intervening assessments of 
irUNK are permissable). For confirmation of irPR the two assessments do not need to be 
consecutive, but must not be separated by a  pseudo -progression event.  
Immune related time to overall response (irTTR)  is the time between date of start of 
treatment until first documented response (confirmed irCR or irPR).  
Immune related disease control rate (irDCR)  is the proportion of patients wi th a best overall 
response of irCR or irPR or irSD. Patients with BOR of irNCRNPD will also be included in 
DCR if patients with non -measurable disease at baseline are in analysis set.  
Immune related progression -free survival (irPFS)  is the time from date o f start of treatment 
to the date of event defined as the first documented assessment of irPD that was then confirmed 
or death due to any cause. Unconfirmed irPD without further adequate tumor assessments will 
be considered as a confirmed irPD. If a patient  has not had an event, progression -free survival 
is censored at the date of last adequate tumor assessment. An adequate tumor assessment is a 
tumor assessment with overall response other than irUNK.  
Immune related confirmed irPD is derived as described in  section 5. 5. 
Overall survival rate at 1 year and 2 years  
OS is defined as the time from date of start of treatment to date of death due to any cause. If a 
patient is not known to have died, then OS will be censored at the latest date the patient was 
known  to be alive (on or before the cut -off date).  
2.7.2  Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis  
Disease control rate  
DCR will be calculated based on the FAS. DCR and its 95% confidence interval will be 
presented.  
Time to response  
TTR will be listed a nd summarized for all patients. The distribution of time to response will be 
estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method only if a sufficient number of responses is observed.  
Progression -free survival (PFS)  
PFS based on RECIST 1.1 will be analyzed in the FAS population. The PFS distribution will 
be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method, and the Kaplan -Meier curves, medians and 95% 
confidence intervals of the medians will be presented for all patients.  
Number of patients with a PFS event and number of patien ts censored for the PFS analysis will 
be summarized. In addition, a summary of reasons for PFS censoring will be provided based on 
the following reasons:  
1: Ongoing without event  
Novartis  Confidential  Page 26

 2: Lost to follow -up 
3: Withdrew consen t 
4: Adequate assessment no  longer availabl e 
5: Event after >=2 missing  tumor assessments   
The PFS censoring reasons are defined in the following way.  
If the time interval between the last adequate tumor assessment ( TA) date and the earliest of the 
following dates is smaller or equal to in terval of 2 missing TAs: 
1. Analysis cut -off date,  
2. Date of consent withdrawal,  
3. Visit date of study treatment discontinuation or end of post -treatment follow -up 
discontinuation due to lost to follow -up. 
Then the PFS censoring reason will be:  
1. ‘Ongoing’,  
2. ‘Withdrew consent’,  
3. ‘Lost to follow -up’,   
If the time interval is larger than the interval of 2 missing TAs with no event observed. then the 
PFS censoring reason will always default to ‘Adequate assessment no longer available’. If the 
time interval betwe en the last adequate TA date and the PFS event date is larger than the interval 
of 2 missing TA then the patient will be censored and the censoring reason will be 'Event 
documented after two or more missing tumor assessments'.  Further details on the defini tion of 
last adequate assessment and two missing TAs are provided in Section 2.7.3 . 
Efficacy endpoints according to irRECIST  
The following irRECIST endpoints will be analyzed in a similar way to  the corresponding 
RECIST endpoints:  
 irORR  
 irDoR  
 irTTR  
 irDCR  
 irPFS.   
Overall Survival  
The survival distribution of OS distribution will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier method  
and Kaplan -Meier curves .  
Survival estimates at 1 year and at 2 years will be compute d with 95% confidence interval  
[Brookmeyer and Crowley 1982 ].

 2.7.3  Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations  
If a patient is not known to have died at the time of analysis cut -off, then OS will be censored 
at the date of last known date patient was  alive, i.e., last contact date . 
The date of last adequate tumor assessment is the date of the last tumor assessment with overall 
lesion response of CR, PR or SD  or non -CR/non -PD before an event or a censoring reason 
occurred. In this case the last tumor evaluation date at that assessment will be used. If no post -
baseline assessments are available (before an event or a censoring reason occurred) then the 
start date of treatment will be used.  
In particular, PFS will be censored at the last adequate tumor as sessment if one of the following 
occurs: absence of event; the event occurred after two or more missing tumor assessments. The 
term “missing adequate tumor assessment” is defined as a tumor assessment not performed or 
tumor assessment with overall lesion r esponse of “UNK”. The rule to determine number of 
missing TAs is based on the time interval between the date of last adequate tumor assessment 
and the date of an event. If the interval is greater than  twice the protocol -specified interval 
between the TAs and 2 times the protocol -allowed time window around assessments, then the 
number of missing assessments will be 2 or more.  
As per protocol, tumor assessments are expected to be performed every 8 weeks for the first  12 
months and every 12 weeks thereafter.  
Therefore:  
 if the last adequate tumor assessment is performed before end of week 36 (i.e. from study  
day 1 to study day 36*7=252) then the interval of 2 missing tumor asssessments is given as 
2*8+2=18 weeks (126 days);  
 if the last adequate tumor assessment  is performed from end of week 36 up to end of week  
44 (i.e. from study day 253 to study day 44*7=308) then the interval of 2 missing tumor 
asssessments is given as 8+12+2=22 weeks (154 days);  
 otherwise, when the last adequate tumor assessment is performed  after end of week 44 (i.e.  
from study day 44*7+1=309 onward), then the interval of 2 missing tumor asssessments is 
given as 2*12+2=26 weeks (182 days).  
These summaries on censoring reasons will be produced for PFS by investigator  and BIRC.  
Refer to  Table 2 -5 for censoring and event date options and outcomes for PFS.

2.8 Safety analyses  
All safety analyses will be based on the safety set. All listings and tables will be presented  
separately for the well -differentiated NET and the poorly -differentiated GEP -NEC groups. In  
addition, pooled safety analyses based on all patients will be produced.  
2.8.1  Adverse events (AEs)  
AE summaries will include all AEs occurring during on treatm ent period. Additional summaries  
will be displayed to report all AEs, AEs related to study treatment, all SAEs and SAEs related 
to study treatment collected up to 150 days after last administration of PDR001 . All AEs 
collected in the AE (e)CRF page will be  listed along with the information collected on those 
AEs e.g. AE relationship to study drug, AE outcome etc. AEs with start date outside of on -
treatment period will be flagged in the listings.  
AEs will be summarized by number and percentage of subjects ha ving at least one AE, having 
at least one AE in each primary system organ class (SOC) and for each preferred term (PT) 
using MedDRA coding. A subject with multiple occurrences of an AE will be counted only 
once in the respective AE category. A subject with  multiple CTCAE grades for the same 
preferred term will be summarized under the maximum CTCAE grade recorded for the event. 
AE with missing CTCAE grade will be included in the ‘All grades’ column of the summary 
tables.  
In AE summaries , the primary system o rgan class will be presented alphabetically and the 
preferred terms will be sorted within primary SOC in descending frequency. The sort order for 
the preferred term will be based on their frequency in the investigational arm.  
The following adverse event su mmaries will be produced using the safety set ; overview of 
adverse events and deaths, AEs  by SOC and PT,  summari zed by relationship, seriousness, 
leading to treatment discontinuation, leading to dose interruption/adjustment, requiring 
additional therapy , requiring immunosuppressive medication  and leading to fatal outc ome. In 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 29 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 addition, a summary of serious adverse events with number of occurrences will be produced 
(an occurrence is defined as >1 day between start and prior end date of record of same preferred 
term) .  
For the legal requirements of ClinicalTrials.gov and EudraCT, two required tables on on -
treatment  adverse events which are not serious adverse events with an incidence great er than 5% 
and on on -treatment  serious adverse events and SAE sus pected to be related to study treatment 
will be provided by system organ class and preferred term on the safety set population.  
If for a same patient, several consecutive AEs (irrespective of study treatment causality, 
seriousness and severity) occurred wi th the same SOC and PT:  
 a single occurren ce will be counted if there is ≤ 1 day gap between the end date of the 
preceding AE and the start date of the consecutive AE  
 more than one occurrence will be counted if there is > 1 day gap between the end date of 
the preceding AE and the start date of the consecutive AE  
For occurrence, the presence of at least one SAE / SAE suspected to be related to study 
treatment / non SAE has to be checked in a block e.g., among AE's in a ≤ 1 day gap block, if at 
least one SAE i s occurring, then one occurrence is calculated for that SAE.  
The number of deaths resulting from SAEs suspected to be related to study treatment and SAEs 
irrespective  of study treatment relationship will be provided by SOC and PT.  
2.8.1.1  Adverse events of special  interest  / grouping of AEs  
Data analysis of AESIs  
An adverse event of special interest  (AESI)  is a grouping of adverse events that are of scientific 
and medical concern specific to compound  PDR001 . These groupings are defined using 
MedDRA terms, SMQs (sta ndardized MedDRA queries), HGLTs (high level group terms), 
HLT (high level terms) and PTs (preferred terms). Customized SMQs ( Novartis MedDRA 
queries , NMQ)  may also be used . A NMQ is a customized group of search terms which defines 
a medical concept for wh ich there is no official SMQ available or the available SMQ does not 
completely fit the need. It may include a combination of single terms and/or an existing SMQ, 
narrow or broad.  
For each specified AESI, number and percentage of patients with at least one  event of the AESI 
occurring during on treatment period will be summarized.  
Summaries of these AESIs will be provided ( specifying  grade, SAE, relationship, leading to 
treatment discontinuation, leading to dose adjustment /interruption, hospitalization, deat h, 
requiring immunosuppressive medication  etc.). Additional summaries will be provided to report 
all AESIs, AESIs related to study treatment, all serious AESIs and serious AESIs related to 
study treatment collected during the on -treatment period and up to 150 days after last 
administratio  n of PDR001.  
A listing of all grouping levels down to the MedDRA preferred terms used to define each AESI 
will be generated.  
Novartis  Confidential  Page 30 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 2.8.2  Deaths  
Separate summaries for on -treatment and all deaths  will be produced  by system organ class and 
preferred term. Additional summary  will be displayed to report all deaths up to 150 days after 
last administration of PDR001 . 
All deaths  will be listed, post treatment deaths will be flagged.  A separate listing of deaths prior 
to starting treatment will be provided for all screened subjects.   
2.8.3  Laboratory data  
On analyzing laboratory, data from all sources (central and local laboratories) will be combined. 
The summaries will include all assessments available for the lab parameter collected no later 
then 150 days after the last study treatment administration  date (see Section 2.1. 1). 
The following summaries will be produced for hematology and biochemistry laboratory data 
(by laboratory parameter  and treatment ): 
 Worst post -baseline CTC grade  (regardless of the baseline status). Each subject  will be 
counted  only for the worst grade observed post -baseline.  
 Shift tables using CTC grades to compare baseline to the worst on-treatment  value   
 For laboratory tests where CTC grades are not defin ed, shift tables using the 
low/normal/high/(low and high) classification to compare baseline to the worst on-
treatment   value.  
 Trends of lab parameter values over time (baseline and selected on -treatment timepoints) 
should be displayed via boxplots  based on time windows  and corresponding tables 
displaying the statistics used for the box plots by the selected time points.  
 
The following listing will be produced for the laboratory data:  
 Listing  of all  CTC grade 3 or 4 laboratory toxicities  
Liver function p arameters  
Liver function parameters of interest are total bilirubin (TBL), ALT, AST and alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP). The number (%) of patients with worst post -baseline values as per Novartis 
Liver Toxicity guidelines will be summarized:  
The following summ aries will be produced:  
 ALT or AST > 3xULN  
 ALT or AST > 5xULN  
 ALT or AST > 8xULN  
 ALT or AST > 10xULN  
 ALT or AST > 20xULN

2.8.4  Other safety data  
2.8.4.1  ECG and cardiac imaging data 
Data handling  
In case the study requires ECG replicates at any assessment, the average of the ECG parameters 
at that assessment should be used in the analyses.  
Data analysis  
12-lead ECGs including PR, QRS, QT, QT cF and RR intervals  will be obtained central/local 
for each subject during the study. ECG data will be read and interpreted locally .

2.9 Pharmacokinetic endpoints    
PK Concentrations  
Descriptive statistics (n, m (number of non -zero concentrations), mean,  CV%  mean, SD , 
median, geometric mean, CV% geo -mean,  minimum and maximum) for  PDR001 
concentrations  will be presented at each scheduled time point for the Pharmacokinetic analysis 
set. For PDR001, pre -dose concentrations collected before dose administratio n on Day 1 of 
Cycle 2+ are Ctrough.  
 
All individual PDR001 concentration data will be listed for the Safety  set. 
Handling of PK data below LLOQ or missing  
All concentration values below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) (i.e. <0.25 ng/mL) are 
set to z ero by the Bioanalyst, and will be displayed in the listings as zero and flagged. LLOQ 
values will be treated as zero in any calculations of summary statistics, and treated as missing 
for the calculation of the geometric means and their CV%.  
Missing value s for any PK data will not be imputed and will be treated as missing.

 2.10 PD and PK/PD analyses  
2.10.1  Immunogenicity  
2.10.1.1  Sample ADA Status  
Each IG sample is assessed in a three tiered anti -drug anti -body (ADA) testing approach. All 
IG samples are analyzed in the initial  screening assay (first tier). Samples testing negative in 
the screening assay are not subject to a confirmatory assay. Samples testing positive in the 
screening assay are then subjected to the confirmatory assay to demonstrate that ADA are 
specific for th e therapeutic protein product (second tier). The titer of confirmatory positive 
samples will be subsequently determined in the titration assay (third tier). Samples identified as 
positive in the confirmatory assay are considered ADA positive and are furthe r characterized in 
the neutralization assay to indicate the presence of neutralizing antibodies (NAb). Samples can 
test negative in either the screening or confirmatory assay but for analysis purposes they are not 
differentiated. The following properties o f each sample will be provided in the source data:  
 Result of  assay according to pre -specified confirmatory cut point: ADA positive (yes) or 
ADA negative (no)  
 Titer (for positive samples): numerical representation of the magnitude of the ADA 
response  
 Prese nce of N ab (for positive samples, if NAb assay results are available) : yes or no  
 Drug tolerance level: highest drug concentration that does not interfere in the ADA 
detection method  
 Fold titer change (i.e. x -fold): threshold for determining treatment boosted  
Sample ADA status is determined based on the following definitions:  
 ADA -inconclusive sample : Sample where assay is ADA negative and PDR001  PK 
concentration at the time of IG sample collection is greater than or equal to the drug 
tolerance level or missing.   
 Unevaluable sample : Sample where assay is not available.  
 Determinant sample:  Sample that is neither ADA -inconclusive nor unevaluable.  
The following definitions apply only to determinant samples:  
o ADA -negative sample : Determinant sample where assay is ADA negative and 
PDR001  PK concentration at the time of IG sample collection is less than the 
drug tolerance level.  
o ADA -positive sample : Determinant sample where assay is ADA positive.  
o ADA -positive NAb sample : Determina nt sample where assay is ADA positive 
and presence of NAb = yes.  
The following definitions apply only to post -baseline ADA -positive samples with a 
corresponding determinant baseline sample. To be classified as treatment -boosted  or treatment -
unaffected , both the post -baseline and baseline titer must be non -missing:  
Novartis  Confidential  Page 34 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 o treatment -induced ADA -positive sample:  ADA -positive sample post -baseline 
with ADA -negative sample at baseline.  
o treatment -boosted  ADA -positive sample:  ADA -positive sample post -baseline 
with titer that is at least the fold titer change  greater than the ADA -positive 
baseline titer.  
o treatment -unaffected ADA -positive sample : ADA -positive sample post -baseline 
with titer that is less than the fold titer change greater than the ADA -positive 
baseline titer . 
NOTE: PK concentrations which are flagged for exclusion will still be used to determine ADA -
inconclusive and ADA -negative samples.  
The following summaries of ADA sample status (n and %) will be provided using 
Immunogenicity prevalence set :  
 ADA -positive samples (i.e. ADA prevalence) and ADA -positive NAb samples, both 
overall and by time point (including baseline). For summaries by time point, the 
denominator is the number of subjects at that time point with a determinant sample.  
Listings will be provided of sample ADA status (including titer for positive samples).  
 
2.11 Patient -reported outcomes  
The EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire and the EQ -5D-5L will be used to collect patient’s QoL 
data. The FAS will be used for analyzing PRO data. The global health status/QoL scale score 
of the QLQ -C30 and the health status index score of the EQ -5D-5L are identified as the primary 
patient -reported outcome variables of interest. Physical functioning, emotional functioning and 
social functioning scale  scores of the QLQ -C30, and overall health status of the EQ -5D-5L are 
identified as secondary patient -reported QoL variables of interest.  

Novartis  Confidential  Page 35 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 High scores in the EORTC QLQ -C30 correspond to a higher response level. Thus a high score 
for a functional scale repr esents a high / healthy level of functioning; a high score for the global 
health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents 
a high level of symptomatology / problems.  Higher scores in the EQ -5D-5L correspond  to 
better health states or overall health status.  
Established estimates for the minimal important differences (MID) for each measure will be 
used to interpret change from baseline scores. For the EORTC QLQ -C30 a change of 10 will 
be defined as the MID [Osoba 1998 ]. For the EQ -5D-5L, a change in the index score of 0.08 
and a changes in the VAS of 7 will be defined as the MID [Pickard 2007 ]. 
EORTC QLQ -C30 subscale scores will be calculated by first obtaining the raw scores through 
adding up the item resp onses on the questions which make up each domain and then applying 
the linear transformation to the raw scores in accordance with the respective scoring manual 
provided by the developer (Fayers 2001). No imputation procedures will be applied for missing 
items or missing assessments.  
For EQ -5D-5L health states will be converted to index value, during data analysis stage, based 
on the EQ -5D crosswalk value set for the UK using the time trade -off method  (van Hout  2015) . 
If any one of the five items is missing,  the index value will be set to missing.   In addition, the 
visual analog scale (ranging from 0 to 100) from the EQ -5D-5L will be evaluated for patient’s 
rating of their overall health status.  
The PRO instruments are planned to be administered during screen ing and every 8 weeks after 
first day of treatment during the first 12 months, and every 12 weeks thereafter until the end of 
treatment. PRO assessments will continue to be collected during the efficacy follow -up after 
the end of treatment.   
The baseline i s defined as the last PRO assessment on or before the first day of treatment.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the PRO scores and change from baseline for 
scales of the EORTC QLQ -C30 and health states, overall health status, and index valu es of  the 
EQ-5D-5L at each scheduled assessment time point  by cohort . Data obtained after the end of 
treatment will be summarized separately.  Additionally, analysis by responder/non -responder 
may be performed if sufficient number of responders is observed.   
2.12 CgA and NSE  
The biochemical response will be assessed using the change from baseline for CgA and NSE 
levels.  
Change from baseline in CgA and NSE will be summarized using descriptive statistics for all 
patients. CgA and NSE values might be analyzed on th e logarithmic scale if their observed 
distribution is found be right skewed.   
Data handling principles  
The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) values for CgA and NSE will be specified by the 
laboratory running the assay.  
Measures below the LLOQ will be ha ndled as follows:  
Novartis  Confidential  Page 36 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
  If the proportion of measures below LLOQ is below 15%, all values specified as below 
LLOQ will be imputed by half of the LLOQ and the standard set of summary statistics will 
be used.  
 If the proportion of measures below LLOQ is above 15%, but below 50%, an alternative 
choice of summary statistics requiring no imputation such as percentiles may be used.  
 Otherwise the data will be missing  
 When both baseline and post baseline values are below LLOQ, change from baseline will 
not be imputed and reported as missing.  
All available data points obtained at scheduled and unscheduled visits will be considered for 
the analysis.

 2.14 Interim analysis  
An interim analysis for preliminary assessment of PDR001 in this patient population will be 
conducted once at least 30 patients from the well -differentiated NET group have 3 radiological 
assessments (week 24) or have discontinued study for any other reason. All available efficacy 
and safety data from the well -diffe rentiated NET and poorly -differentiated GEP -NEC groups 
up to the cut -off date will be used for IA. The study will not be stopped at the interim analysis 
for efficacy reasons regardless of efficacy results and will continue until mature data for all 
patient s become available.  
 
3 Sample size calculation  
Group 1: Well -differentiated NET  
In the absence of an established control treatment, ORR reported in the placebo arms of studies 
reported in  Table 1 -1 of the protocol  can serve as a reference. A 3% ORR is theref ore considered 
as a reasonable reference while an improvement up to 10% is considered as clinically 
meaningful in this patient population.  
Total sample size of 90 patients was chosen such that with an observed 10% response rate, the 
corresponding 95% CI ex cludes the value 3%.  
Approximately thirty patients will be recruited in each cohort NET cohort: pancreatic, GI and 
thoracic.  
Operating characteristics  in the well -differentiated NET group  are given in  Table 3 -1. A sample 
size of 90 patients ensures an 90% probability of success if the true ORR is 15%.

In addition,  Table 3 -2 shows the probability of observing at least 3 responders in a cohort with 
30 patients under the assumption of true response rate of 10 -20% in this cohort.

Group 2: Poorly -differentiated GEP -NEC  
Approximately 20 patients will be enrolled in the poorly -differentiated GEP -NEC group. The 
operating characteristics are shown in Table 3 -3 and Table 3 -4. With the planned sample size 
the probability to observe at least moderate efficacy ( 10% ORR) is more than 80% if the true 
ORR is 15%. Posterior probability of a true ORR of at least moderate efficacy was computed 
for different scenarios assuming a minima lly informative prior with Beta distribution a nd the 
following parameters: a=0.176, b=1. Posterior probability of a true ORR to be 10% ORR is 
more than 70% if 3 responders are observed in 20 patients.

5.1 Imputation rules  
5.1.1  Study drug  
The following rule should be used for the imputation of the dose en d date for a given study 
treatment component : 
Scenario 1 : If the dose end date is completely missing and there is no EOT page  and no death 
date, the patient is considered as on -going :  
The p atient should be treated as on -going and the cut -off date should be used as the dose end 
date. 
Scenario 2 : If the dose end date is completely or partially missing and the EOT page  is available :  
Case 1: The dose end date is completely missing , and the EOT  completion date is complete, 
then this latter date should  be used.   
Case 2: Only Year (yyyy) of the dose end date  is available and yyyy < the year of EOT date:   
            Use Dec31yyyy  
Case 3: Only Year (yyyy) of the dose end date  is available and yyyy  = the year of EOT date:   
            Use EOT date  
Case 4:  Both Year (yyyy)  and Month (mm) are available  for dose end date , and yyyy  = the 
year of EOT date and mm  < the mo nth of  EOT date:  
            Use last day of the Month (mm)  
All other cases should be considered as a data issue  and the statistician should contact the data 
manager of the study.  
After imputation, compare the imputed date with start date of treatment, if the imputed da te is 
< start date of treatment:   
Use the treatment start date  
Patients with missing start dates a re to be considered missing for all study treatment component 
related calculations and no imputation will be made.  If start date is missing then end -date should 
not be imputed.

 5.1.2.1  Other imputations  
Incomplete date of initial diagnosis of cancer and  date of most rece nt 
recurrence  
Missing day is defaulted to the 15th of the month and missing month and day is defaulted to 01 -
Jan.  
Incomplete assessment dates for tumor  assessment  
All investigation dates (e.g. MRI scan, CT scan ) must be completed with day, month and year . 
If one or more assessment dates are incomplete but other investigation dates are available, 
this/these incomplete date(s) are not considered for calculation of the assessment date and 
assessment date is calculated as the latest of all investigation dates  (e.g. MRI scan,  CT scan ) if 
the overall response at that assessment is CR/PR/SD/UNK . Otherwise – if overall response is 
progression – the assessment date is calculated as the earliest date of all investigation dates at 
that evaluation number.  If all meas urement dates have no day recorded, the 1st of the month is 
used. If the month is not completed, for any of the investigations, the respective assessment will 
be considered to be at the date which is exactly between previous and following assessment. If 
a previous and following assessment is not available, this assessment will not be used for any 
calculation.  
Applying the cut -off to tumor assessment  
For tumor related assessments, if an evaluation has some assessments done prior to   cut-off date 
and  others after the cut -off date , then the evaluation is considered post -cut-off date and will 
be excluded from analysis . 
5.2 AEs coding/grading  
Adverse events are coded using the Medical dictionary for regulatory activities (MedDRA) 
terminology . 
AEs will be assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version  4.03.  
The CTCAE represents a comprehensive grading system for reporting the acute and late effects 
of cancer treatments. CTCAE grading is by definition a 5-point scale generally corresponding 
to mild, moderate, severe, life threatening, and death. This grading system inherently places a 
value on the importance of an event, although there is not necessarily proportionality among 
grades (a grade 2 is not nece ssarily twice as bad as a grade 1).  
5.3 Laboratory parameters derivations  
Grade categorization of lab values will be assigned programmatically as per NCI Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version  4.03. The calculation of CTCAE 
grades will  be based on the observed laboratory values  only, clinical assessments will not be 
taken into account.  The criteria to assign CTCAE grades are given in  Novartis internal criteria 
for CTCAE grading of laboratory parameters. The latest available version of t he document 
based on the underlying CTCAE version  4.03 at the time of analysis will be used. For laboratory 
Novartis  Confidential  Page 43 
SAP 17-Sep-2020 (2:18)  CPDR001E2201  
 
 tests where grades are not defined by CTCAE  v4.03, results will be graded by the 
low/normal/high  (or other project -specific ranges, if more suitable ) classifications based on 
laboratory normal ranges.  
A severity grade of 0 will be assigned for all non -missing lab values not graded as 1 or higher. 
Grade 5 will not be used. For laboratory tests that are graded for both low and high values, 
summaries wil l be done separately and labelled by direction, e.g., sodium will be summarized 
as hyponatremia and hypernatremia.  
Imputation Rules   
CTC grading for blood differentials is based on absolute values. However,  this data may not 
be reported as absolute count s but rather as percentage of WBC.  
If laboratory values are provided as ‘<X’ (i.e. below limit of detection) or ‘>X’ , prior to 
conversion of laboratory values to SI unit , these numeric values are set to X.   
The following rules will be applied to derive the WBC differential counts when only 
percentages are available  for a xxx differential  
xxx count = (WBC count) * (xxx  %value / 100)  
Further derivation of laboratory parameters might be required for CTCAE gradin g. For 
instance, corrected calcium can be derived using the reported total calcium value and albumin 
at the same assessment using the following formula:  
Corrected Calcium (mg/dL) = Calcium (mg/dL) – 0.8 [Albumin (g/dL) -4] 
In order to apply the above formul a, albumin values in g/L will be converted to g/dL by  
multiplying by 0.1), calcium values in mmol/L will be converted to mg/dL by dividing by 
0.2495. For calculation of laboratory CTC grades 0 and 1, the normal range for  derived 
corrected calcium is set to the same limits (in mg/dL) as for calcium.  
CTC grades for the derived absolute WBC differential counts (neutrophils, lymphocytes) and 
corrected calcium will be assigned as described  above for grading

(1) =  LAB CTC grades 1, 2, 3, 4 overrule the study specific (central or local) normal range criteria , e.g. if ULN of Sodium is 151 
mmol/L and the value is 151 mmol/L, CTC grade 2 is assigned although the value is  ULN.  
(2) =  Life-threatening consequence s and/or hospitalization are not considered  for determination of LAB CTC grades 3 and 4. 
Concomitant usage of anticoagulation therapy (for INR and Fibrinogen) is not considered either.  
(3) =  Values and LNRs for blood differentials can be given as %, absolute values should then be calculated using WBC. Generally,  1.5 
x 109 /L (lymphocytes) and  2 x 109 /L (neutrophils) are considered as LAB CTC grade 0  
(4) =  For Creatinine and Fibrinogen, t he comparison with baseline is not considered  for derivation of LAB CTC grades

5.4 Statistical models  
5.4.1  Primary analysis  
Analysis of binary data 
No formal hypothesis testing will be performed. Responses will be summarized in terms of 
percentage rates with 95% CIs. An exact binomial confidence interval (implem ented using SAS 
procedure FREQ with EXACT statement for one -way tables) will be calculated [Clopper and 
Pearson 1934] .  
SAS procedure FREQ will be used to estimate the proportion of responders (binary outcome = 
1 or “Yes”), along with the associated 95% (=100 × (1 – 0.05)) two -sided Pearson -Clopper CI.  
5.4.2  Key secondary analysis  
Analysis of time to events data 
 
Kaplan -Meier es timates  
An estimate  of the survival  function  will be constructed  using  Kaplan -Meier  (product-limit ) 
method as implemented  in PROC  LIFETEST  with METH OD=KM  option. The  PROC  
LIFETEST  statement  will use the option  CON FTYP E=LOGLOG. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival function with 95% confidence intervals at specific 
time point s will be summarized. The standard error of the Kaplan-Meier estimate will be 
calculated  using Greenwood’s  formula  [Collett  1994]. 
 
Treatment of ties 
The STRATA statement in LIFETEST procedure will be used to analyze time to event data 
with ties.  
5.5 Rule of derivation for immune related criteria  
 
Immune related confirmed irPD is derived as followed:  
Confirmed progression 1  (type 1, cPD1) is declared if a patient has 2 consecutive tumor 
assessments at least 4 weeks (28 days) apart both showing disease progression. Assessments 
with an irUNK response or irPD assessments < 28 days after initial irPD, are discarded.  
The first ir PD is flagged as cPD1 while all subsequent irPDs are flagged as xPD1.

 1    irPD  
2    irUNK  
3    irPD  (Assessment 1  + 30 days)   Assessment 3 is ≥28 days after Assessment 1  
 Assessment 3 represents confirmation of irPD at  
assessment 1  
 Assessment 1 irPD is flagged cPD1  
 Assessment 3 irPD is flagged xPD1  
1    irSD  
2    irPD  
3    irPD (Assessment 2  + 20 days)  
4    irPD (Assessment 2  + 30 days)   Assessment 3 is < 28 days after Assessment 2  
 Assessment 4 is ≥ 28 days after Assessment 2  
 Assessment 4 represents confirmation of irPD at 
assessment 2  
 Assessment 2 irPD is flagged cPD1  
 Assessment 3 and 4 irPDs are flagged xPD1  
The date of progression is the date of the assessment flagged as cPD1.  
 
Confirmed progression 2  (type 2, cPD2) is declared if a patient discontinues treatment 
following a single irPD with no subsequent assessments. Assessments with an irUNK response 
or irPD assessments < 4 weeks (28 days) after initial irPD, are discarded. Dis continuation of 
treatment is obtained from EOT case report form.  
The assessment is flagged as cPD2 and subsequent irPDs (<28 days after first PD) are flagged 
as xPD2.  
The table below shows two hypothetical data scenarios and programming instructions.  
 
Sequence of assessments  Instructions  
1    irSD  
2    irPD  
-     EOT   Patient withdraws after initial progression (Assessment 
2) without confirmation  
 Assessment 2 irPD is flagged as cPD2  
1    irPD  
2    irPD  (Assessment 1   + 20 
days)  
-     EOT   Assessment 2 irPD is <28 days after Assessment 1, so 
does not represent confirmation  
 However, patient has completed treatment  
 Assessment 1 irPD is flagged cPD2  
 Assessment 2 irPD is flagged xPD2  
The date of progression is the date of the assessment flagged as cPD2.  
Unconfirmed progression.  Patients with a single irPD, and no assessment of irSD or better 
(assessment with an irUNK response or irPD assessments < 4 weeks after initial irPD, are 
discarded) continuing  treatment at the time of the analysis will be consider ed as unconfirmed 
(uPD).

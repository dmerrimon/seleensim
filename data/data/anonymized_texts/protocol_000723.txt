    STUDY SUMMARY (SYNOPSIS)  
Title:  A Multicenter, Open Label, Long -Term Safety Study of BHV -3000 in the 
Acute Treatment of Migraine   
Rationale:  Rimegepant is being developed for the treatment of migraine, with a 
specific focus on acute t reatment . Effectiveness against migraine was 
demonstrated in a Phase 2b double -blind, randomized, placebo- controlled, 
dose-ranging study where rimegepant at 75 mg showed efficacy on all four 
traditional endpoints: pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia  [1].  
This study is being conducted to further characterize the safety and tolerability of rimegepant during longer term treatment of patients with 
migraine .  
Target 
Populatio n: The study will recruit male and female patients, 18 years of age or older 
with at least a one -year history of migraine (with or without aura) 
consistent with a diagnosis according to the International Classification of 
Headache Disorders, 3rd edition, beta  version  [2]. Patients mus t have 
migraine onset prior to age 50, migraine attacks that last 4 -72 hours (if not 
treated) and have had 2 -14 migraine attacks  of moderate to severe intensity 
per month within the 3 months prior to the screening visit. A separate 
group of patients with a  history of 4 -14 moderate to severe 
migraines/month during  the 3 months prior to the screening visit, will be 
enrolled and will dose with one tablet of study drug every other day  for 12 
weeks . After a 30 -day observation period of standard of care, up to 
approximately 2000 eligible patients will be assigned to receive 
rimegepant. Patients who have participated in BHV3000 -301, BHV3000-
302 or BHV3000- 303 (or another clinical trial with rimegepant) may be 
considered for participation in  this long term safety study if all eligibility 
criteria are met, however participation in this study is not guaranteed.  
Enrollment into this study will initially be open to patients with 2 -8 
moderate to severe migraine attacks per month (primarily  the pa tients 
from  BHV- 3000- 301 and BHV -3000- 302) for approximately three months. 
After approximately three months,  study enrollment will open  for patients  
with a history of 9- 14 migraine attacks of moderate to severe intensity per 
month within the 3 months prior  to the screening visit. Lastly, study 
enrollment will open for subjects in the every other day dosing group who 
have a history of 4-14 moderate to severe migraines/month  during the 3 
months prior to the screening visit .  
Number of Subjects:  Approximately 28 00 patients will be screened to assign up to 
approximately 2000 patients to rimegepant.  
Of the 2000 patients  assigned to rimegepant , up to approximately : 
Protocol BHV3000 -201  Confidential  
Multicenter, Open Label Long -Term Safety Study for Acute Treatment of Migraine  
Version 5  Page 9 of 103 
 
 
   
   
    - 1200 will have a history of 2 -8 moderate to severe migraine attacks 
per month,    
- 600 will have a history of 9 -14 moderate to severe migraine attacks 
per month, and  
- 200 will have a history of 4-14 moderate to severe migraine attacks 
per month in the every other day dosing group .  
Objectives:  Primary Objective: To evaluate the safety and tolerability of rimegepant.  
Secondary Objectives:  
• To evaluate the frequency of ALT or AST > 3x ULN  with 
concurrent  elevations in bilirubin > 2x ULN  in subjects treated with 
rimegepant.  
• To evaluate the frequency and severity of h epatic -related adverse 
events and the frequency of hepatic -related treatment 
discontinuations.  
Exploratory Objectives:  
• To evaluate the frequency of subjects with elevated  liver function 
tests (AST, ALT or total bilirubin ).   
• To evaluate the frequency of subjects with ALT or AST  elevations  
> 3x ULN in temporal association with nausea , vomiting, anorexia, 
abdominal pain or fatigue.  
• To explore the contributions of gender, age and exposure to 
rimegepant  to abnormalities in AST , ALT , or bilirubin.  
• To investigate the time on treatment and cumulative exposure 
associated with: (1) hepatic related SAEs  and treatment 
discontinuations; (2) elevations in ALT or AST > 3x ULN  with 
concu rrent  elevations in bilirubin > 2x ULN .

    • To evaluate the number of headache days and severity  of migraine 
attacks while subjects are treated with rimegepant  relative to the 
observational period.  
• To evaluate the effect of rimegepant  treatment compared to 
baseline on the  20-Item Migraine -Specific Quality of Life 
Questionnaire v 2.1 (MSQ oL). 
• To evaluate the effect of rimegepant  treatment compared to 
baseline on the Migraine Preference of Medication (PoM).  
• To examine the scores on the Sheehan Suic idality Tracking Scale. 
• To evaluate the effect of rimegepant treatment compared to 
baseline on the Satisfaction with Medication survey.  
• To evaluate the effect of rimegepant treatment compared to baseline on the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS)  
• To evaluate the effect of rimegepant treatment compared to baseline on the Clinical Globa l Impression – change (CGI-c) scale.  
Study 
Design:  This is a multicenter, open-label study to assess the safety and tolerability 
of long term use of rimegepant, taken  up to one tablet  per calendar day, in 
patients with migraine.  
The Screening phase includes a screening visit and a 30 day Observation 
Period. For subjects to be eligible for the study, they must have 2-14 
migraine attacks of moderate to severe intensity  per month in the 3 months 
prior to the Screening Visit . Patients  enrolled in the every other day dosing 
group must have had 4-14 migraine attacks of moderate to severe intensity 
per month during  the 3 mont hs prior to the screening visit. Enrollment into 
this study will initially be open to patients with 2 -8 moderate to  severe 
migraine attacks per month (primarily the patients from BHV -3000- 301 
and BHV -3000- 302) for approximately three months. After approximately 
three months, study enrollment will open for patients with a history of 9 -14 
migraine attacks of moderate to severe intensity per month within the 3 
months prior to the screening visit.  Lastly, study enrollment will open for 
subjects in the every other day dosing group  (4-14 moderate to severe 
migraines/month) .

    Upon the completion of the screening visit,  patients  will be provided an 
electronic diary  (eDiary) to document each day of the 30 day Observation 
Period if a migraine occurred, the migraine intensity and if the migraine 
was treated . Patients will record the standard of care migraine treatment 
received on a paper  diary. After completing the 30  day Observational 
Period, the pat ient will return to the clinic with both diaries for the 
Baseline Visit. At the Baseline Visit, eligibility for continued participation 
in the study will be assessed before study medication will be dispensed . 
After the investigator reviews the results of the baseline laboratory assessments and determines the patient’s continued eligibility, the site staff 
will inform the patient whether or not they are eligible to start dosing in the Long Term Treatment phase. If eligible for the Long Term Treatment Phase, patients will be instructed that they can take  study  medication at the 
onset of a migraine (of mild to severe intensity). Patients in the 2 -8 or 9 -14 
moderate to severe migraines/month groups will be instructed that they can 
take a maximum of one tablet of rimegepant  per calendar day during the 52 
week Long Term Treatm ent phase  at the onset of a migraine ( of mild to 
severe intensity) .  
Patients in the every other day dosing group (history of 4 -14 moderate to 
severe migraines/month) will be instructed that they must take one tablet of 
rimegepant every other calendar day. If patients in this group have a 
migraine on a day that they are not scheduled to dose  with rimegepant , 
they may take a rimegepant tablet  to treat a migraine of mild, moderate or 
severe intensity . Therefore, patients  in this group can take a maximum of 
one tablet of rimegepant per calendar day  for 12 weeks .  
Patients are required to record their migraine occurrence and severity and 
all study medication doses in the eDiary . Patients are also  required to 
continue to record the standard of care migraine treat ment taken on a paper 
diary. P atients will also use the eDiary to complete  the P reference of 
Medication (PoM)  questionnaire and the Satisfaction with Medication 
(SM) questionnaire  at specified study timepoints.  
At select study visits, patients will complet e or will be administered  the 
Migraine -specified Quality -of-Life Q uestionnaire v 2.1 (MQoL Q), the 
Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) , Clinical Global Impression – 
change ( CGI-c) scale, and the Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale ( S-STS) 
on paper form s, at specified study visits.  
Additional a ssessments and visit schedule are outlined in the procedural 
table in Section 4.3. Procedures include study personnel review of the 
eDiary and paper diary  with the patient , assessment of study medication 
compliance , monitoring of tolerability and safety (including vital signs, 
laboratory tests, and electrocardiography ). Study v isits will be

Version 5  Page 12 of 103 
 
 
   
   
    approximately every two weeks during the first month and then every 4 
weeks until Week 52 for subjects in the 2 -8 moderate to s evere 
migraine/month group or the 9 -14 moderate to severe migraine/month 
group.  
Study visits will be approximately every two weeks during the first mo nth 
and then every 4 weeks until Week 12 for subjects in the every other day 
dosing group ( those with history of 4- 14 moderate to severe 
migraines/month ). 
Patients will return to the study site at the end of Week 52 (or Week 12 for 
subjects in the every other day dosing group  (history of 4 -14 moderate to 
severe migraines/month) ) (+/- 7 days) for the End of Tr eatment Visit. 
There is a Follow -up Visit 14 days (+/ - 2 days) after the Week 12/52/EOT 
Visit.  
To closely monitor for potential drug induced liver injury, guidance on 
reporting potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI) events is provided in 
the protocol. Lab results that meet predefined LFT abnormality criteria as 
DILI should be reported as a serious adverse event (SAE). See Section 
8.1.5, Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI).  
Primary 
Endpoint:  The f requency and severity of adverse events that occu r in at least 5% of 
treated subjects,  the frequency of serious adverse events, adverse events 
leading to discontinuation and clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities during the treatment period will be assessed. The frequency 
of AEs, SAEs, AEs leadi ng to discontinuation are determined from case 
report forms, and are tabulated based on the number of unique subjects. The frequency of c linically significant laboratory abnormalities are 
determined from laboratory data, and are also tabulated based on the  
number unique subjects . 
Secondary 
Endpoints:  The frequency of AST or ALT elevations > 3x ULN, concurrently with 
bilirubin elevations > 2x ULN, will be assessed by tabulating the number 
of unique subjects with this pairing of events.  
The frequency of hep atic-related adverse events and hepatic -related 
treatment discontinuations will be tabulated from case report forms and will be based on unique subjects reporting such events. Severity will be 
assessed as the worst severity observed while the subject is on  treatment.

    1 INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
1.1 Background  
BHV- 3000 (rimegepant, /rih-MEJ -eh-pant/) is a calcitonin gene -related peptide (CGRP) 
receptor antagonist in development for the acute treatment of migraine. A comprehensive  
and durable efficacy profile for rimegepant  was demonstrated in an 812 patient Phase 2b 
double -blind, randomized, placebo controlled, dose -ranging trial where migraine 
sufferers received either placebo, sumatriptan (100 mg) or rimegepant  (10, 25, 75, 150, 
300 or 600 mg) (Study CN170003) [1]. A dose of 75 mg was selected as the optimal dose 
for Phase 3 clinical trials, given that larger doses showed a similar efficacy profile and 
there was negligible benefit identified with higher  doses . Rimegepant  at 75 mg showed 
statistically significant comprehensive  efficacy across all four traditional endpoints at 2 
hr (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) which was durable as evidenced by the 
presence of pain freedom and pain relief which persisted through 24 hr and 48 hr 
showing significant diffe rence from placebo on the corresponding 2 -24 and 2- 48 hr pain 
endpoints . 
1.2 CGRP’s Role in Migraine  
The CGRP receptor is located within pain -signaling pathways, intracranial arteries and 
mast cells and its activation is thought to play a causal role in migraine pathophysiology. 
For example, research and clinical studies have shown: serum levels of CGRP are 
elevated during migraine attacks, infusion of intravenous CGRP produces persistent pain in migraine sufferers and non -migraine sufferers, and treatment with  anti-migraine drugs 
normalize CGRP levels. Additionally, multiple clinical studies show that small molecule CGRP receptor antagonists, which inhibit the binding of endogenous CGRP to CGRP receptors, are effective in aborting migraine attacks.  
Treatment with a CGRP receptor antagonist is believed to relieve migraine through the following possible mechanisms:  
• Blocking Neurogenic Inflammation:  Binding of CGRP receptor antagonists to 
CGRP receptors located on mast cells would inhibit inflammation caused by trigeminal nerve release of CGRP onto mast cells within the tough outer covering 
of the brain, or the meninges.  
• Decreasing Artery Dilation:  By blocking the CGRP receptors located in smooth 
muscle cells within vessel walls, CGRP receptor antagonists would inhi bit the 
pathologic dilation of intracranial arteries without the unwanted effect of active vasoconstriction.  
• Inhibiting Pain Transmission:  Binding of CGRP receptor antagonists to CGRP 
receptors would suppress the transmission of pain by inhibiting the cent ral relay 
of pain signals from the trigeminal nerve to the caudal trigeminal nucleus .

    1.3 Product Development Background  
Details of the clinical and preclinical studies are provided in the most current investigator 
brochure. A summary of the relevant dat a to the study are presented below.  
1.3.1  Non-clinical Studies  
1.3.1.1  Non-clinical Pharmacokinetics  and Pharmacodynamics  
A series of in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic (PK) and metabolism studies were 
conducted with rimegepant in rats, dogs, and monkeys . In addition, rimegepant was 
compared with two different triptans to assess potential to contract coronary vessels.  While sumatriptan and zolmitriptan exhibited progressive contraction of human coronary 
vessels at increasing concentrations, the CGRP receptor antagonist  compounds leading 
up to identification of rimegepant did not induce any changes in the baseline tension in human coronary vessels even at very high  (10 uM)  concentrations.  Rimegepant was 
tested using the identical protocols in dog coronary artery (when viable human tissues 
were not available) and no vessel contraction was observed, in contrast to the triptans 
which again showed progressive concentration -dependent constriction . These data 
provide direct evidence that rimegepant acts without the undesirable  effect of active 
vasoconstriction associated with treatment by triptans.  Please refer to the most current 
version of the Investigator Brochure for further details . 
1.3.1.2  Non-clinical Toxicology  
The nonclinical toxicity of rimegepant  was comprehensively evaluate d in a series of 
single - and repeat -dose oral toxicity, genetic toxicity, phototoxicity, and safety 
pharmacology studies.  Rimegepant  is not  genotoxic or phototoxic and has a low potential 
for off- target receptor interactions or adverse effects on the cardi ovascular, respiratory, 
and central nervous (CNS) systems.  Please refer to the most current version of the 
Investigator Brochure for further details .

7.1 CN170003  
Study CN170003 [3] was a double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging 
trial of rimegepant  for the acute treatment of migraine.  The primary objective was to 
evaluate the efficacy of rimegepant  compared with placeb o in the  acute treatment of 
migraine as measured by pain freedom (head pain intensity level reported as “no pain”) at  
2 hours post -dose using a four point rating scale (no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, 
severe pain) while identifying an optimal dose to su pport the Phase 3 clinical trials.  
Subjects were randomized to receive placebo, sumatriptan 100 mg or rimegepant  (10 mg, 
25 mg, 75 mg, 150 mg, 300 mg, or 600 mg).  Randomization made use of an adaptive 
design, whereby one quarter of subjects were assigned placebo and one -eighth were

    assigned sumatriptan; the remainder were assigned to one of six rimegepant  groups based 
on a Bayesian analysis of the observed response rates. Subjects were instructed to treat 
one migraine of moderate or severe pain intensity a nd then return to the clinic within 7 
days.  
A total of 885 subjects were randomized and 812 completed the study.  
A broad and durable efficacy profile for rimegepant  was demonstrated to be fully present 
at 75 mg [1].  Th is dose was selected as the optimal dose to support Phase 3 clinical 
trials, given that larger doses showed a similar efficacy profile and there was negligible 
benefit identified with larger doses, consistent with previous ly published migraine studies  
characterizing the dose -response profiles of acute treatments for migraine [8].   
Rimegepant  at 75 mg showed statistically significant efficacy  across all four traditional 
endpoints at 2 hr (pain, nausea, photophob ia and phonophobia) which was durable and 
persisted through 24 hr.  At 2 hr following a single oral dose of 75 mg, patients who previously were experiencing moderate -to-severe migraine pain had no -pain (31.4% p < 
0.0018) or mild-to -no-pain (72.1%  = < 0.0007 ) as compared to placebo (15. 2% and 
51.2%, respectively)  (Figure 1 ).

hours Post Dose (+/ - 95% Confidence)  
 
In conclusion, Study CN170003 [3] demonstrated that rimegepant  is superior to placebo 
in the acute treatment of migraines. The selection of 75 mg rimegepant  as the dose for the 
Phase 3 pivotal efficacy studies is based on  reliably demonstrated efficacy on the key 
primary outcome measure, Pain Freedom at 2 hours (31.4% vs 15.3% placebo; p =

    0.0018) , durability of effect as well as benefit on secondary outcome measures as 
presented above  (see al so Section 1.4.2 ).   
1.3.4  Clini
cal Adverse Event Profile  
To date, 7 clinical studies have been completed in healthy volunteers and migraineurs  
that inform PK, metabolic interactions, safety, tolerability and efficacy. In total, the 
current data suggests a favorable benefit -risk profile for rimegepant in the acute treatment 
of migraine attacks.  Efficacy was established in Study CN170003, and the overall 
database suggests a favorable safety profile. Clinical experience with rimegepant has also allowed the characterization of safety and tolerability at substantial multiples of the 
intended therapeutic exposure and intended frequency of use. Rime gepant has been 
assessed in single doses up to 1500 mg and in multiple doses from 75 mg to 600 mg with 
14-days of dosing (including 300 mg twice daily), where the higher doses yielded 
exposures more than 60 times greater in AUC and 30 times higher in Cmax as compared 
to the mean therapeutic exposure of a single 75 mg dose.  These high exposure multiples were generally well tolerated and safe.

    Rime
gepant appears to be generally safe and well tolerated in humans when given as 
single oral doses up to the maximum dose of 1500 mg and multiple oral doses up to the 
maximum daily d ose of 600 mg for 14 days. Please refer to the Investigators Brochure for 
a summary of the clinical safety profile.  
The primary identified AE of interest is potential change in liver function tests.  
Investigators must carefully monitor routine liver funct ion tests (ALT, AST, total 
bilirubin, and ALP) and potentially liver related symptoms and signs. Clinicians should  also monitor changes in hematology and other laboratory measures. Please refer to the 
current Investigators Brochure for further information  regarding the clinical safety profile 
of rimegepant.  
1.4 Study Rationale  
Migraine is a chronic and debilitating disorder characterized by recurrent attacks lasting four to 72 hours with multiple symptoms, including typically one-sided, pulsating 
headaches of moderate or severe pain intensity that are associated with nausea or 
vomiting, and/or sensitivity to sound (phonophobia) and sensitivity to light 
(photophobia). The World Health Organization’s (WHO) Global Burden of Disease 
Study ranks migraine as the thir d most prevalent disease worldwide [9] and the Global 
Burden of Disease Survey 2010 rates migraine as the seventh highest specific cause of disability worldwide .  Annually, migraines affect approximately 15% of the adult 
population in the United States [10], comprising approximately 33 million adults.  
Approximately 62% of migraineurs have one or more attack per month, and approximately 25% have one or m ore per week  [11].  Approximately 80% of individuals 
are unable to work or function normally during a migraine attack, with 53% reporting 
severe impairment and/or requiring bedrest [12, 13] . Comorbid conditions associated 
with migraine include depression, anxiety and cardiovascular disease  [14].

    While there are multiple classes of medications for the acute treatment of migraine, 
considerable unmet need remains, as evidenced by migraines being the seventh leading 
cause of disability worldwide [9].  In part, this burden is attributed to limitation s of 
current standard -of-care pharmacotherapies, which are contraindicated for use in over 2.6 
million American migraine sufferers with known cardiovascular disease as well as many others with multiple cardiovascular (CV) risk factors.  The US Prescribing Information 
(USPI) for triptans includes warnings and precautions for migraine patients with risk 
factors for cardiovascular disease and states that high risk patients, including those with 
increased age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, obesity or a stron g family history of 
coronary artery disease, should be evaluated prior to receiving the first dose of a triptan. 
Triptans are contraindicated in patients with a history of ischemic heart disease, coronary 
artery vasospasm, history of stroke, peripheral vas cular disease or uncontrolled 
hypertension. Even in patients who have a negative cardiovascular evaluation, product 
labeling for triptans recommends that consideration be given to administration of the first 
dose in a medically -supervised setting and performing an electrocardiogram immediately 
following administration. Additionally, periodic cardiovascular evaluation should be 
considered for long- term users of triptans who have cardiovascular risk factors. 
According to a recent study published in the journa l Headache, an estimated 2.6 million 
migraine sufferers in the United States have a cardiovascular event, condition or procedure that limits the potential of triptans as a treatment option. Thus, there remains a 
significant unmet medical need for a novel m igraine -specific medication that does not 
increase the risk of cardiovascular liability . 
Biohaven is developing a small molecule CGRP receptor antagonist, rimegepant, for the acute treatment of migraine that is expected to  address these cardiovascular limi tations.  
As discussed in Section  1.3.1.1 , nonclinical studi es show that rimegepant is not 
associated with adverse vasoconstrictive properties that  are thought to cause the serious 
cardiovascular adverse events of the triptan class and does not share a mechanism with 
other agents of cardiovascular concern such as non -steroidal anti -inflammatories 
(NSAIDs) and ergotamine derivatives.  A completed Phas e 2 trial [3] demonstrated the 
efficacy of rimegepant in the acute treatment of migraine, with and without aura, at doses of 75 mg and above.   Doses above 75 mg were not associated with clinically significant 
differences in efficacy and therefore 75 mg is the selected dose for Phase 3.    
The open label, long -term safety study proposed herein will further assess the safety of 
rimegepant (75 mg) for the acute treatment  of migraine. This study is being conducted to 
further characterize the safety and tolerability of rimegepant during longe r term treatment 
of patients with migraine. Importantly, it will help define the safety profile of rimegepant 
dosing on an as needed (up to daily basis for a period up to 1 year. Approximately 200 
subje cts will dose at least  every other day, but not more t han once per calendar day, for a 
period of approximately 12 weeks.

    1.4.1  Study Design Rationale  
This is a multicenter, open label evaluation of the safety and tolerability of long term use 
of rimegepant  75 mg tablet  taken as needed  (up to one tablet per day  upon onset of a 
migraine of mild, moderate or severe intensity ) for the acute treatment of migraine  for up 
to 52 weeks . This study will also evaluate at least every other day dosing in 
approximately 200 patients for up to 12 weeks. Up to a pproximately 2000 patients will be 
assigned treatment , in this study .  
1.4.2  Dose Selection Rationale  
Study CN170003 was a double -blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose -ranging trial 
of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine [1].  The primary objective was to 
evaluate the efficacy of rimegepant  compared with placebo in the  acute treatment of 
migraine as measured by pain freedom (head pain intensity level reported as “no pain”) at  
2 hours post -dose using a four point rating scale ( no pain, mild pain, moderate pain, 
severe pain) while identifying an optimal dose to support the Phase 3 clinical trials.  
Subjects were randomized to receive placebo, sumatriptan 100 mg or rimegepant (10, 25, 
75, 150, 300, or 600 mg).  Randomization made u se of an adaptive design, whereby one 
quarter of subjects were assigned placebo and one -eighth were assigned sumatriptan; the 
remainder were assigned to one of the six rimegepant groups based on a Bayesian analysis of the observed response rates. Subjects were instructed to treat one migraine of 
moderate or severe pain intensity and return to the clinic within 7 days.  
A total of 885 subjects were randomized and 812 completed the study.  Key entry criteria 
were very similar to those chosen for this clinical  trial. 
A comprehensive  and durable efficacy profile for rimegepant  was demonstrated to be 
fully present at 75 mg but not at lower doses (i.e., 10 mg or 25 mg). This dose was 
selected as the optimal dose to support Phase 3 clinical trials, given that large r doses (150 
mg, 300 mg, 600 mg) showed a similar efficacy profile and there was no pattern of  added 
benefit in dosing higher , consistent with previous ly published migraine studi es [8].  
rimegepant  at 75 mg showed  statistically significant broad efficacy across all four 
traditional endpoints at 2 hr (pain, nausea, photophobia and phonophobia) which was durable and persisted through 24 hr.  At 2 hr following a single oral dose of 75 mg, 
patients who previously were experiencing moderate -to-severe migraine pain had no -pain 
(31.4% p = 0.0018) or mild- to-no-pain (72.1%) as compared to placebo (1 5.3% and 
51.2%, respectively). For the 75 mg dose at 2 hr, patients also showed significant 
freedom from nausea (67.4%, p = 0.0074) freedom from phonophobia (52.3%, p = 
0.0001) and freedom from photophobia (41.9%, p = 0.0023) vs. placebo (51.2%, 28.1% and 24.1%, respectively).  The lasting nature of these beneficial anti -migraine effects 
were evidenced by a comparatively similar efficacy profile in the 2 -24 hr measures, 
where rimegepant  at 75 mg produced significant 2 -24 hr sustained pain freedom (27.9% , 
p < 0.0001) and 2- 24 hr sustained pain relief (69.8%, p < 0.0001) vs. placebo (7.4% and 
42.4%, respectively) .

    1.4.3  Other Rationale related to the compound/study  
Prior to initiation of Phase 3, a  Phase 1 crossover study to assess the safety, tolerability 
and pharmacokinetics of  a single dose of the rimegepant tablet in healthy  volunteers  will 
be conducted to ensure PK comparability  with the previously studied capsule (rimegepant   
free-base). The Investigator Brochure will be updated to include these study results when 
available.  
1.5 Research Hypothesis  
Long term treatment dosing with rimegepant , up to one tablet per day,  is safe and well 
tolerated in the acute treatment  of migraine.

    4 STUDY PLAN  
4.1 Study Design and Duration  
This is a multicenter, open-label study to assess the safety and tolerability of long term 
use of rimegepant, taken up to one tablet per calendar day, in patients with migraine.  
The Screening phase includes a screening visit and a 30 day Observation Period. For 
subjects to be eligible for the study, they must have 2-14 migraine attacks of moderate to 
severe intensity per month in the 3 months prior to the Screening Visit . Patients enrolled 
in the every other day dosing group must have had 4 -14 migraine attack s of moderate to 
severe intensity per month within the 3 months prior to the screening visit.  Enrollment 
into this study will initially be open to patients with 2 -8 moderate to severe migraine 
attacks per month (primarily the patients from BHV -3000- 301 and BHV -3000- 302) for 
approximately three months. After approximately three months, study enrollment will 
open for patients with a history of 9 -14 migraine attacks of moderate to severe intensity 
per month within the 3 months prior to the screening visit. Lastly, study enrollment will 
open for subjects in the every other day dosing group (4 -14 moderate to severe 
migraines/month).  
Upon completion of the screening visit,  patients will be provided an eDiary  to document 
on each day of the 30 day Observation Period if a migraine occurred, the migraine 
intensity and if the migraine was treated . Patients will record the standard of care 
migraine treatment received on a paper  diary. After completing the 30  day Observational 
Period, the pat ient will return to the clinic with both diaries for the Baseline Visit. At the 
Baseline Visit, eligibility for continued participation in the study will be assessed before 
study medication will be dispensed. After the investigator reviews the results of the 
baseline laboratory a ssessments and determines continued eligibility, the site staff will 
inform the patient whether or not they are eligible to start dosing in the Long Term Treatment phase. If eligible for the Long Term Treatment Phase, in the 2 -8 or 9 -14 
moderate to severe migraines/month groups, patients will be instructed that they can take 
study medication at the onset of a migraine (of mild to severe intensity). Patients can take 
a maximum of one tablet of rimegepant  per day during the 52 week Long Term 
Treatment phase  at the onset of a migraine (mild, moderate or severe intensity) .  
Patients in the every other day dosing group (history of 4 -14 moderate to severe 
migraines/month) will be instructed that they must take one tablet of rimegepant every 
other calendar day, regardless of whether or not the patient has a migraine. If patients in 
this group have a migraine on a day that they are not scheduled to dose with rimegepant, 
they may take a rimegepant tablet to treat a migraine of mild, moderate or severe 
intensity. There fore, patients in this group can take a maximum of one tablet of 
rimegepant per calendar day  for up to 12 weeks .  
Patients are required to record their migraine occurrence and severity and all study medication doses in the eDiary and are required to continue to record the standard of care 
migraine treatment taken on a paper diary. P atients will also use the eDiary to complete

    the P reference of Medication (PoM)  questionnaire and the Satisfaction with Medication 
(SM) questionnaire  at specified study timepoints.  
At select study visits, patients will complete or will be administered t he Migraine -
specified Quality -of-Life Questionnaire v 2.1 (MQoL Q), the Migraine Disability 
Assessment (MIDAS), Clinical Global Impressions-change  (CGI-c ) scale, and the 
Sheehan Suicid ality Tracking Scale ( S-STS) on paper forms, at specified study visits.   
Additional a ssessments and visit schedule are outlined in the procedural table in Section 
4.3. Procedures include study personnel review of the eDiary and paper diary with the 
patient , assessment of study medication compliance, monitoring of tolerability and safety 
(including vital signs, laboratory tests, and electrocardiography). Study v isits will be 
approximately every two weeks during the first month and then every 4 weeks until 
Week 52 for subjects in the 2 -8 moderate to severe migraine/month group or the 9 -14 
moderate to severe migraine/month group.  
Study visits will be approximately every two weeks during the first month and then every 
4 weeks until Week 12 for subjects in the every other day dosing group (those with 
history of 4 -14 moderate to severe migraines/month).  
Patients will return to the study site at the end of Week 52 (or Week 12 for subjects in the 
every other day dosing group (history of 4 -14 moderate to sever e migraines/month))  (+/- 
7 days) for the End of Treatment Visit. There is a Follow -up Visit 14 days (+/ - 2 days) 
after the Week 12/52/EOT Visit.  
To closely monitor for potential drug induced liver injury, guidance on reporting 
potential drug -induced liver injury (DILI) events is provided in the protocol. Lab results 
that meet predefined LFT abnormality criteria as DILI should be reported as a serious adverse event (SAE). See Section 8.1.5, Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) .

 4.3.1  Screening  Visit / Observation Period  (30 days)  
Approximately 2800 patie nts will be screened to assign up to approximately 2000 patients to 
rimegepant .  
Before any study procedures are performed, patients must sign informed consent. After 
informed consent, patients will be enrolled in the IWRS system. The patient’s migraine history 
and medical history will be col lected at the Screening Visit.  All patients will continue to use 
their migraine prophylactic or standard of care medications during the 30 day observation 
period.  Patients will undergo all screening procedures as detailed in Table 1 and Table 2, after 
which they will be provided an eDiary  to document each day during the 30 day O bservation 
Phase the occurrence  and severity  of migraines and if the migraine was treated . Patients will 
also record all migraine standard of care treatment s taken during the Observation Phase on a 
paper diary. After completin g the 30 day Observation  Phase, patients will return to the clinic,  
and both their eDi ary and paper diary will be reviewed for completeness .   
If the patient meets inclusion/exclusion criteria, they may enter the Long Term Treatment 
Phase.  
4.3.2  Long Term Treatment  Phase ( 12 weeks or 52 Wee ks) 
Once completing the Screening/Observational Period, patients will return to the study site for the Baseline Visit. Patients who continue to meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria and have been 
compliant with the eDiary  may enter the Long Term Treatment Phase. At the Baseline Visit, 
patients will be dispensed study medication and will be instructed they cannot take study 
medication until baseline laboratory results confirm study eligibility. After the investigator 
reviews the results of the baseline labor atory assessments and determines the patient’s 
continued eligibility, the site staff will inform the patient whether or not they are eligible to start dosing in the Long Term Treatment phase. This contact with the patient must be 
documented in the patient’ s medical record.  
There are two different dosing schedules in this study. If eligible, patients in the 2 -8 moderate 
to severe migrains/month and 9 -14 moderate to severe migraines month groups will be 
instructed that they can take study medication  at the o nset of a migraine  (of mild  to severe 
intensity) . Patients  will also be instructed that they can take a maximum of one tablet of 
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -201  Confidential  
Multicenter, Open Label Long -Term Safety Study for Acute Treatment of Migraine  Page 54 of 103 
 
   
     
  
   
   
 
    
   
 rimegepant  per calendar day during the Long Term Treatment Phase  at the onset of a migraine 
(mild, moderate or severe intensity) .  
Patients in the 4 -14 moderate to severe migraines/month group will be instructed that they must 
take one tablet of study drug every other  calendar  day, regardless of whether they have a 
migraine  on that day or not . If patients in this group have a migraine on a day that they are not 
scheduled to dose with rimegepant, they may take a rimegepant tablet  to treat a migraine of 
mild, moderate or severe intensity . Therefore, patients can take a ma ximum of one tablet of 
rimegepant per calendar day  for 12 weeks . 
The electronic patient diary will be completed by patients to capture dosing of study medication 
and the frequency  and severity of migraines  during the Treatment Phase .  
Patients will also use the eDiary to complete  the Preference of Medication (PoM) and 
Satisfaction with Medication (SM) questionnaire. The Migraine -Specified Quality of Life 
questionnaire v 2.1 (MSQoL), The Sheehan Suicid ality Tracking Scale ( S-STS), Migraine 
Assessment Disability (MIDAS) and Clinical Global Impression (CGI -c) will be completed , or 
administered by the investigator , on paper at specified study visits ( Table 1 and Table 2).  
Study v isits will be approximately every two weeks during the first month and then every 4 
weeks, until Week 52 ( Table 1). At each visit the eDiary will be reviewed by site st aff for 
completeness  and compliance. Study drug compliance and concomitant medication use will be 
reviewed (and compared to the eDiary and paper diary  entries) and patient will be dispensed 
additional study drug as needed. Additional safety (including laboratory tests and ECGs) will 
be performed per the schedule outlined in Table 1 and Table 2.  
4.3.3  End of Treatment  (Week s 12 or  52)  
Patients will return to the study at the end of Week 12 or 52 (+/ - 7 days) for review of the 
electro nic diary, assessmen t of medication compliance, assessment  of tolerability and safety 
(including vital signs, laboratory tests,  and  electrocardiography)  (Table 1 and Table 2).

study medication, and as outlined in  Table 1 or Table 2. 
6.2.5  Sheehan Suicidality  Tracking Scale   
 
The Sheehan STS (S-STS) is a prospective, patient self -reported or clinician administered 
rating scale that contains 16 questions to track both treatmen t-emergent suicidal ideation and 
behaviors [16, 17] . The S -STS will be completed on a paper form at the site. At the screening 
visit, the recall period for completing  the S -STS is 30 days prior; at all other visits, the recall 
period for completing the S -STS is since the last visit. Any responses other than 0 must be 
immediately evaluated by the investigator . If the investigator determines that a subject is at risk 
of suicide or self -harm, appropriate measures to ensure the subject’s safety and obtain mental 
health evaluation must be implemented . In such circumstances, t he subject must immediately 
be discontinued from the study.   The event should be recorded as either a n AE or SAE as 
determined by the investigator and reported within 24 hours to the Sponsor.  Any subject with a 
response greater than 0 to any question, excluding Question 2, must be immediately 
be discontinued from the study.  Subjects with a response of 1 ( “a little”) to Question 2 will be 
discontinued per the investigator’s assessment or if the response persists. Subjects with a response greater than 1 on Question 2 will be discontinued from the study immediately.

 6.4 Other  Assessments  
6.4.1  Daily Migraine Assessment of Severity/Frequency  
The number of headache days and severity of migraine attacks during the period that subjects 
are treated with rimegepant  relative to the observational period will be analyzed . 
6.4.2  Migraine Quality of Life Questionnaire  
Impact of treatment on patient -reported quality of life will be assessed using The Migraine 
Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQoLQ)  version 2.1. The MQoLQ is a 15 -item instrument that 
has been validated in migraine patients to measure t he impact of treatment (within past 4 
weeks ) on migraine -specific domains: work, social function, energy,  vitality, feelings, 
concerns, and migraine symptoms. [26]    
6.4.3  Migraine Preference of Medicine  
The Preference of Medication Scale (PoM) is a brief scale that captures the patients' perception 
of whether the medication they are taking has had a greater benefit compared with previous 
medications to treat their pain. The eDiary  will be used to evaluate the Preference of 
Medication Scale.  
6.4.4  Satisfaction with Medication Questionnaire  
The Satisfaction with Medication (SM) Questionnaire is a brief questionnaire  that captures the 
patients’ perception of whether they are satisfied with their headache medication . The eDiary  
will be used to evaluate the Satisfaction with Medication Questionnaire.  
6.4.5  Migraine Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS ) 
The Migraine Disability Assessment questionnaire is a retrospective patient self -reported scale 
of 5 questions that measures headache -related disability as lost time due to headache from paid 
work or school, household work and nonwork activities. The MIDAS will be completed on a paper form at the site  [18].

 7 STUDY DRUG MANAGEMENT 
7.1 Description  of Study Drug  
7.1.1  Investigational Product   
An investigational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some regions, is 
defined as follows:  
A pha rmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a reference in a 
clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used or assembled 
(formulated or packaged) in a way different from the authorized form , or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form.  
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. It is 
the responsibility of the investigator to ensure that investigational  product is only dispensed to study subjects. The investigational product must be dispensed only from official study sites by authorized personnel according to local regulations.  
In this protocol, investigational product is rimegepant 75 mg tablet.  
7.1.2  Non-investigational Product  
Other medications used as support or rescue medication for preventative, diagnostic, or 
therapeutic reasons, as components of the standard of care for a given diagnosis, may be considered as non- investigational  products.  
In this protocol, non -investigational product(s) is/are: standard of care for migraine treatment . 
7.1.3  Packaging, Shipment and Storage  
The product storage  manager should ensure that the study drug is stored in accordance with the 
environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity) as determined by the sponsor. 
Please see the Pharmacy Manual for specific conditions. If concerns regarding the quality or 
appearance of the study drug arise, do not dispense the study drug and contact the sponsor /CRO 
immediately.

 7.2 Dose and Administration  
7.2.1  Method of Assigning Patient Identification  
Immediately after written informed consent is obtained and before performing a ny study -related 
procedures, the site staff must contact the IWRS to enter each subject into the IWRS. Each 
subject will be assigned an unique sequential 4 -digit subject number through the IWRS ( 0001, 
0002, 0003, etc. ). This subject number must not be reus ed for any other participant in the study . 
Patients will maintain their subject number assigned at screening throughout the trial.  
After confi rming patient eligibility, r egistering a subject for Baseline will trigger a container 
number for the study medic ation . The study drug will be dispensed at baseline  and as needed at 
the monthly study visits.  
7.2.2  Selection and Timing of Dose and Administration  
Study medication ( rimegepant ) will be assigned via the IWRS . There are no dose adjustments in 
this study and pat ients will receive 30 tablets of rimegepant in a bottle.  Patients will be 
dispensed  study medication at the Baseline Visit , and the patients in the 2 -8 and 9 -14 moderate 
to severe  migraines per month groups will be instructed that they can take the one tablet of  
study medication per calendar day at the onset of a migraine of mild to severe intensity . Patients 
in the in the 2 -8 and 9 -14 moderate to severe migraines per month groups will dose for up to 52 
weeks.  
Patients in the 4 -14 moderate to severe  migraine group will also be dispensed study medication 
at the Baseline Visit and will be instructed to dose with one rimegepant tablet every other 
calendar day, regardless of whether  they have a migraine on that day or not. If the patients in 
this group  have a migraine (mild to severe intensity)  on a non -dosing day, they may take a 
rimegepant tablet , for a maximum of  one tablet  per calendar day. Patients in the 4 -14 moderate 
to severe migraines per month group will dose for up to 12 weeks.   
Dosing of study  medication is not to occur until after eligibility is confirmed based on the 
subject’s baseline laboratory tests.  
7.2.3  Dose Modifications  
There will be no dose adjustments in this study.

 7.2.4  Dose Interruptions  
If a patient experiences an AE that requires interruption in study medication, the investigator 
should consult with the Sponsor medical monitor to evaluate the need for any additional tests 
prior to re -starting study medication.  
7.3 Blinding and Unblinding  
Not applicable.  
7.4 Treatment Compli ance  
Responsible study personnel will dispense the study drug.  Patients should finish a bottle of 
study medication before starting  a new bottle.  Accountability and compliance verification 
should be documented in the patient’s study records.   
Patients must be counseled on the importance of taking the study drug as directed  (see Section 
7.2.2) . Treatment compliance, review of study medication doses reported in the eDiary  and 
through review of returned study medication , should be assessed by site staff at ea ch study visit. 
Discrepancies between doses reported in the eDiary, review of study medication and information provided by patient must be documented in the source record. Incorrect or missing 
dosing data and migraine data that are reported in the eDiary w ill be corrected through either a 
Data Clarification Record or a Medication Reconciliation Form. Investigators , should inform  
study participants that  involuntary termination from the study will occur  in cases where non -
compliance is identified.  Study staff  should contact a patient  in between the monthly study 
visits if th e patient  demonstrates non-compliance with the eDiary  and document the contact in 
the source , to identify potential lost to follow up patien ts as early as possible.  
Investigators must monitor patients for possible cases of abuse of study medication (patients 
taking study drug for non- therapeutic purposes, e.g. for psychoactive effects such as high or 
euphoria). Investigators should also assess study drug accountability discrepancies ( e.g. missing 
study medication, loss of drug, or non -compliance cases in which more study medication was 
used, as compared to expected). Investigators should obtain more information and explanation 
from patients when there are study drug ac countability discrepancies. See Section 8.1.1.  
Cases of potential study medication abuse or overdose (including cases of non-compliance with study medication dosing instructions or patients who discontinue treatment without returning 
study medication) should be documented in the source record and reported as an AE or SAE as appropriate.  Dosing errors (e.g. accidentally taking 2 tablets in one calendar day) should be 
reported as deviations.

 7.5 Destruction and Return of Study Drug  
If the study drug (those supplied by the sponsor or sourced by the investigator) are to be 
destroyed on site, it is the investigator’s responsibility to ensure that arrangements have been 
made for the disposal, procedures for proper disposal have been established according to the 
appli cable regulations, guidelines and institutional procedures, and appropriate records of the 
disposal have been documented.  The unused study drugs can only be destroyed after being 
inspected and reconciled by the responsible BHV Study monitor or the sponsor’s designee  
unless this is against institutional policy .  
All unused and/or partially used study drug may be destroyed on site providing the site has an 
applicable standard operating procedure on file.

 8 ADVERSE EVENTS  
An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as a ny new untoward medical occurrence or worsening of a 
pre-existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation patient administered an 
investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with 
this treatm ent.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding for example) symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of the investigational product, whether or not considered relate to the investiga tional 
product.  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during an open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a patient.  In order to prevent reporting bias, patients should not 
be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of  one or more AEs.  
There are two types of adverse events, Serious Adverse Events (SAE) and Non-Serious Adverse Events (AEs).   
8.1 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  
8.1.1  Definition of Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
An SAE is any event that meets any of the following criteria at any  dose:  
• Death  
• Life-threatening  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject who received rimegepant  
• Other: Important medic al events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospitalization, may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent one  of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such events are (but not 
limited to): 
o Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -201  Confidential  
Multicenter, Open Label Long -Term Safety Study for Acute Treatment of Migraine  Page 78 of 103 
 
   
     
  
   
   
 
    
   
 o Blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization 
o Development of drug dependency or drug abuse  
o Potential drug induced liver injury (see Section  8.1.5 ) 
o Abuse or Overdose of medication 
 Potential study medication abuse (including cases of excessive non-compliance with 
study medication dosing instructions or patients who discontinue treatment without 
returning study medication) should be documented in the source record and reported 
as an AE or SAE as appropriate . Investigators must monitor patients for possible 
cases of abuse of study medication (patients taking study drug for non- therapeutic 
purposes, e.g. for psychoactive effects such as high or euphoria). Investigators 
should obtain more information and explanation from patients when there are study 
drug accountability discrepancies  
 Potential study medication overdose is defined in Section 8.1.3  
Definition of Terms  
 Mild: Is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention.   The event does not general ly interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
Moderate: Is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event 
interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but poses no significant or 
permanent risk  of harm to the subject.  
Severe: Interrupts usual activities of daily living, significantly affects clinical status, or may 
required intensive therapeutic intervention. 
Life threatening: An AE is life threatening if the subject was at immediate risk of dea th from the 
event as it occurred; i.e., it does not include a reaction that if it had occurred in a more serious 
form might have caused death. For example, drug induced hepatitis that resolved without evidence of hepatic failure would not be considered lif e threatening even though drug induced 
hepatitis can be fatal.  
Hospitalization: AEs requiring hospitalization should be considered SAEs. Hospitalization for 
elective surgery or routine clinical procedures that are not the result of AE (e.g., elective 
surge ry for a pre -existing condition that has not worsened) need not be considered AEs or 
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -201  Confidential  
Multicenter, Open Label Long -Term Safety Study for Acute Treatment of Migraine  Page 79 of 103 
 
   
     
  
   
   
 
    
   
 SAEs. If anything untoward is reported during the procedure, that occurrence must be reported 
as an AE, either 'serious' or 'non -serious' according to the usual criteria.  
In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that 
would not have been appropriate in the physician's office or out patient setting. When in doubt 
as to whether 'hospitalization' occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered serious.  
The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in BHV clinical studies (but may be considered non-serious AEs):  
1. A visit t o the emergency room or other hospital department <24 hours that does not 
result in an admission (unless considered “important medical event” or event that is life 
threatening);  
2. Elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent;  
3. Admissions as per protocol  for a planned medical/surgical procedure;  
4. Routine health assessment requiring admission (i.e., routine colonoscopy);  
5. Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health 
and requires no medical intervention (i.e., lack of housing, care -giver respite, family 
circumstances).  
Disability/incapacitating: An AE is incapacitating or disabling if the experience resul ts in a 
substantial and/or permanent disruption of the subject's ability to carry out normal life functions.  
8.1.2  Collecti on and Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
Following the patient’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs, whether related or 
not related to study drug, must be collected, including those thought to be associated with 
protocol -specific procedur es.   All SAEs must be collected that occur during the screening 
period and up to and including the EOT visit. The investigator should report any SAE occurring 
after these time periods that is believed to be related to study drug or protocol -specific 
proce dures.   
An SAE report should be completed for any event  where doubt exists regarding its status of seriousness.

8.1.5  Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI)  
Wherever possible, timely confirmation of the initial liver -related laboratory abnormalities 
should occur prior to the reporting of a potential DILI event.  All occurrences of potential 
DILIs, meeting the defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs as per S ection 8.1.2.  
Potential drug induced liver injury is defined as:  
1. ALT or AST elevation > 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)  
AND 
2. Total bilirubin > 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase)  
AND 
3. No other immediately apparent possible causes of ALT or AST  elevation and 
hyperbilirubinemia, including but not limited to, viral hepatitis, pre -existing chronic or 
acute liver disease, or the administration of other drug(s) known to be hepatotoxic.  
If any potenti al DILI is identified and meets the criteria above, the Biohaven Medical 
Monitor (or designee) should immediately be contacted for further instruction and whether the patient must discontinue from the trial and appropriate follow up requirements.  
8.2 Non-seri ous Adverse Events  
A non-serious adverse event  is an AE not classified as serious.  
8.2.1  Collection and Reporting of Non- Serious  Adverse Events  
The collection of non -serious AE information should begin at the initiation of study drug.  Non -
serious AE information should also be collected from the start of a placebo lead -in phase or 
other observational period intended to establish a baseline status for a patient.  
Non-serious adverse events should be followed until conclusion or stabilization, ore reported as 
SAEs if they become serious.   Follow -up is also required for non-serious AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of study drug or those  that are present at the end of study 
treatment.

 8.2.2  Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
The following laboratory test abnormalities should be captured on the non -serious AE CRF 
page or SAE Report Form (paper or electronic) as appropriate:  
1. Any laboratory test resul t that is clinically significant or meets the definition of an 
SAE;  
2. Any laboratory abnormality that required the patient to have the study drug 
discontinued or interrupted;  
3. Any laboratory abnormality that required the patient to receive specific corrective  
therapy.

 9 STATISTICS  
9.1 General Procedures  
Categorical variables are tabulated with counts and percentages. Continuous variables are 
summarized with univariate statistics (e.g., n, mean, standard error, median, minimum and 
maximum).   
For the calculation of  descriptive statistics of observed data, subjects must have a baseline value 
to be evaluable for endpoints based on values and changes from baseline over time.  
Tabulations of the following endpoints present the number of unique subjects with an event: protocol deviations; interruptions of study therapy; non-study medications; adverse events; and 
laboratory abnormalities. Thus, for these endpoints, multiple occurrences of the same event are counted only once per subject.  
9.2 Sample Size  
With a sample size of ro ughly 2000 subjects, and with no events observed, the upper bound of a 
one-sided, 95% confidence interval for zero observations is roughly 0.0015. Hence, this sample 
size is large enough to rule out adverse events that occur at rates greater than 15 cases per 
10,000 patients.  
This study has a subpopulation of approximately 800 subjects with more frequent migraines that 
is expected to have a greater exposure to the study drug. With this sample size, and no events 
observed, the upper bound of a one -sided, 95% confidence interval for zero observations is 
roughly 0.00375. Hence, this sample size is large enough to rule out adverse events that occur at 
rates greater than 37.5 cases per 10,000 patients . 
9.3 Statistical Methods  
9.3.1  Primary Endpoint(s)  
The investigators wi ll determine the intensity of adverse events (AEs) and the relationship of 
AEs to study therapy. The investigators’ terms will be coded and grouped by system organ class using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) available to the analyst. AEs will be presented by system organ class and preferred term. If a 
subject had an adverse event with different intensities over time, then only the greatest intensity 
will be reported.  Tabulations will be made for adverse event s that occur in at least 5% of 
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -201  Confidential  
Multicenter, Open Label Long -Term Safety Study for Acute Treatment of Migraine  Page 85 of 103 
 
   
     
  
   
   
 
    
   
 treated subjects,  serious adverse events and adverse events leading to discontinuation. Other 
safety analyses will be described in the statistical analysis plan.  
Laboratory abnormalities will be identified from on -treatment laboratory data using a pre -
defined list of clinically significant abnormalities. The number of unique subjects with each 
abnormality will be tabulated . 
9.3.2  Secondary Endpoint(s)  
The frequency of subjects that have confirmed values of ALT or AST that exceed 3x  the ULN 
concurrently with confirmed total bilirubin that exceeds  2x the ULN will be tabulated and 
presented with descriptive statistics and exact confidence intervals.  
Both hepatic related AEs and hepatic related AEs leading to discontinuation will be su mmarized 
in a manner similar to that described for the primary endpoint.  
9.3.3  Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
Tabulations of demographic and baseline characteristics are made for treated subjects. A 
separate set of tabulations will be made for subjects  enrolled but not treated.   
9.4 Interim Analysis  
This is an open label study, single -arm, study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability  of 
rimegepant. As such, safety monitoring the primary concern. There is little concern, or opportunity, for inflation of type I (false -positive) error. During the course of the study 
laboratory, safety and exposure data will be monitored on an on- going ba sis. Summaries of 
these data will be produced roughly every 2 months for review by the sponsor and CRO. In 
addition, data may be locked, analyses conducted, and reports produced as required to support safety monitoring, administrative concerns, and regulat ory requirements.  A clinical study 
report will be produced after last patient last visit.

 10 ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES  
10.1 Good Clinical Practice  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, Good Clinical Practice (GCP), 
Good Laboratory Prac tice (GLP) and all applicable regulations, including the Federal Food, 
Drug and Cosmetic Act, U.S. applicable Code of Federal Regulations (title 21), any IEC requirements relative to clinical studies. The study will also be conducted in compliance with 
the recommendations laid down in the most recent version of the Declaration of Helsinki, with 
the exception that registration of such Phase 1 trials in a publicly accessible database is not 
mandatory.  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol. The protocol and any amendments and the patient informed consent will receive Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opinion prior to initiation of the study.    
All serious breaches must be reported to Bi ohaven (or designee) immediately.  A Serious breach 
is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in connection with the stud or protocol, 
which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, the safety or physical or mental integrity of the 
patients of the study or the scientific value of the study.  
Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by education, training, and 
experience to perform their respective task(s).  
This study will not use the services of study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (e.g., lose of medical licensure, debarment).   
10.2 Data and Safety Monitoring Committee  
This study will not make use of a Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DMC). The study  
medication rimegepant  has been tested and found to be well tolerated .  Safety will be closely 
monitored via oversight by the investigators , Sponsor and CRO/designee . Summaries of LFTs 
and AEs will be reviewed roughly every 2 months by Sponsor/CRO.  
10.3 Instit utional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee  
The Investigators agree to provide the IEC with all appropriate documents, including a copy of the protocol/amendments, ICFs, advertising text (if any), Investigator’s brochure and any other 
written informa tion provided to study subjects. The trial will not begin until the Investigators 
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -201  Confidential  
Multicenter, Open Label Long -Term Safety Study for Acute Treatment of Migraine  Page 87 of 103 
 
   
     
  
   
   
 
    
   
 have obtained the IEC favorable written approvals for the above -mentioned study documents. A 
properly executed written ICF shall be read, signed, and dated by each subject pr ior to entering 
the trial or prior to performing any study procedure. The original signed and dated ICF will be 
kept at the Investigator site and a copy will be given to the subject.  
In the event that the protocol is amended, the revised protocol must be approved by the IEC 
prior to its implementation, unless the changes involve only logistical or administrative aspects 
of the trial. If a revised ICF is introduced during the study, each subject’s further consent must 
be obtained. The new version of the ICF must be approved by the IEC, prior to subsequently 
obtaining each subject’s consent.  
The Principal investigator and the Sponsor’s representative must sign the protocol and its 
amendm ents (if any) before initiating the study.  
It is the Sponsor’s responsibility to submit the protocol and its amendments (if any), and the ICFs to regulatory authorities when necessary.   
10.4 Informed Consent  
Investigators must ensure that patients, or, in thos e situations where consent cannot be given by 
patients, their legally acceptable representatives, are clearly and fully informed about the purpose, potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in which they 
volunteer to participate .  
Biohaven (or designee) will provide the investigator with an appropriate (i.e., Global or Local) 
sample informed consent form which will include all elements required by  
ICH, GCP and applicable regulatory requirements.  The sample informed consent form  will 
adhere to the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.  
Before the potential subject has undergone any study -related screening procedures, the nature of 
the study and the potential risks associated with it will be explained to the subject, and the 
subject will be given an opportunity to ask questions to his or her satisfaction. After the questions are answered, but before proceeding further, the subject must read and sign a written 
informed consent form. This signed inf ormed consent form will be reviewed and approved by 
an IRB/IEC, revisions to the protocol and informed consent form will be reviewed and 
approved by the IRB/IEC, a copy retained in the Study Master File, and the date and time the 
subject signed the form wi ll be entered in his or her CRF. The subject will be provided with a 
copy of his or her signed and dated informed consent form.

Multicenter, Open Label Long -Term Safety Study for Acute Treatment of Migraine  Page 88 of 103 
 
   
     
  
   
   
 
    
   
 If informed consent is initially given by a patient’s legal guardian or legally acceptable 
representative, and the patient sub sequently becomes capable of making and communicating 
their informed consent during the study, then the consent must additionally be obtained from the patient.  
The informed consent form must also include a statement that Biohaven and its representatives 
and regulatory authorities may have direct access to patient records.  
The rights, safety, and well -being of study patients are the most important considerations and 
should prevail over interests of science and society.   
10.5 Case Report Forms  
An Investigator is  required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation of each study 
patient. Data reported on the CRF that are derived from source documents must be consiste nt 
with the source documents or the discrepancies must be explained.  
Electronic CRFs will be prepared for all data collections fields when EDC is being used.    
The confidentiality of records that could identify patients must be protected, respecting the 
privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
The Investigator must retain a copy of the CRFs including records of changes and corrections.   
If EDC is being used, signatures will be obtained electronically and a copy of the electronic 
CRFs will be provided (or the data from the CRFs) for future reference.   
10.6 Records Management  and Retention  
In accordance with the principles of GCP and GLP, the study may be inspected by regulatory authorities, the Sponsor and C RO. The Sponsor is entitled to access information about the status 
of the study and to review the original documents of the study.  
The Investigator must retain all study records and source documents for the maximum required 
by the applicable regulations and guidelines, or institution procedures or for the period of time 
specified by the sponsor, whichever is longer.  The Investigator must contact the Sponsor prior 
to destroying any records associated with this study.  
Biohaven will notify the Investigators when the study files for this study are no longer needed.

 If the Investigator withdraws from the study (i.e., retirement, relocation), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee.  Notice of such transfer will be given in writing 
to Biohaven.  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that the current disposition record of 
investigational product (those supplied by the sponsor) is maintained at each study site where 
the study drug is inventoried and dispensed.  Records or logs must comply with applicable 
regulations and guidelines and should include:  
1. amount of study drug received and placed in storage area  
2. label ID number or batch number or Kit number as specified for the protocol

 11 AMENDMENTS  
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate r isk to study subjects, may 
be made only by Biohaven. A protocol change intended to eliminate an apparent immediate 
hazard to subjects may be implemented immediately, provided the IRB/IEC is notified within 5 days.  
Any permanent change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. The written amendment must be submitted to the IRB/IEC and the investigator must await approval before 
implementing the changes. Biohaven will submit protocol amendments to the appropriate 
regulatory authorities for appr oval.  
If in the judgment of the IRB/IEC, the investigator, and/or Biohaven, the amendment to the 
protocol substantially changes the study design and/or increases the potential risk to the subject 
and/or has an impact on the subject's involvement as a study participant, the currently approved 
written informed consent form will require similar modification. In such cases, informed consent will be renewed for subjects enrolled in the study before continued participation.

 15.2 APPENDIX 2 - Declaration of Helsinki  
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
Ethical Principles  
for 
Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
 
Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly  
Helsinki, Finland, June 1964  
and amended by the 
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975  
35th WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983 
41st WMA General Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989 
48th WMA General Assembly, Somerset West, Republic of South Africa, October 1996  
and the  
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000  
 
A. INTRODUCTION 
The World Medical Association has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement of 
ethical principles to provide guidance to physicians and other participants in medical research 
involving human subjects. Medical research involving human subjects includes research on identifiable human material or identifiable data.  
It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of the people. The 
physician’s knowledge  and conscience are dedicated to the fulfillment of this duty. 
The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the words, "The health of my subject will be my first consideration," and the International Code of 
Medical E thics declares that, "A physician shall act only in the subject's interest when providing 
medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental condition of the subject."  
Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on experimentation 
involving human subjects.  
In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well-being  of the human 
subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society.  
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -201  Confidential  
Multicenter, Open Label Long -Term Safety Study for Acute Treatment of Migraine  Page 97 of 103 
 
   
     
  
   
   
 
    
   
 The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve prophylactic, 
diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis of 
disease. Even the best -proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic methods must 
continuously be challenged through research for their effectiveness, efficiency, accessibility and 
quality.  
In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic and 
therapeutic procedures involve risks and burdens.  
Medical research is subj ect to ethical standards that promote respect for all human beings and 
protect their health and rights. Some research populations are vulnerable and need special 
protection. The particular needs of the economically and medically disadvantaged must be 
recog nized. Special attention is also required for those who cannot give or refuse consent for 
themselves, for those who may be subject to giving consent under duress, for those who will not 
benefit personally from the research and for those for whom the resear ch is combined with care.  
Research investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements for 
research on human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international 
requirements. No national ethical, legal or regulat ory requirement should be allowed to reduce 
or eliminate any of the protections for human subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
B. BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR ALL MEDICAL RESEARCH  
It is the duty of the physician in medical research to protect the life, health, privacy, and dignity 
of the human subject.  
Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources 
of information, and on adequate laboratory and, where appropriate, animal experimentation.  
Appropriate caution must be exercised in the conduct of research, which may affect the 
environment, and the welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
The design and performance o f each experimental procedure involving human subjects should 
be clearly formulated in an experimental protocol. This protocol should be submitted for 
consideration, comment, guidance, and where appropriate, approval to a specially appointed 
ethical review  committee, which must be independent of the investigator, the Sponsor or any 
other kind of undue influence. This independent committee should be in conformity with the 
laws and regulations of the country in which the research experiment is performed. The 
committee has the right to monitor ongoing trials. The researcher has the obligation to provide 
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -201  Confidential  
Multicenter, Open Label Long -Term Safety Study for Acute Treatment of Migraine  Page 98 of 103 
 
   
     
  
   
   
 
    
   
 monitoring information to the committee, especially any SAEs. The researcher should also 
submit to the committee, for review, information regarding funding, Sponsors, institutional 
affiliations, other potential conflicts of interest and incentives for subjects.  
The research protocol should always contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should indicate that there is compliance with the princ iples enunciated in this Declaration.  
Medical research involving human subjects should be conducted only by scientifically qualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person. The responsibility 
for the human subject must always rest with a subject of the research, even though the subject 
has given consent.  
Every medical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by careful assessment of predictable risks and burdens in comparison with foreseeable benefits  to the 
subject or to others. This does not preclude the participation of healthy volunteers in medical research. The design of all studies should be publicly available.  
Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects unless 
they are confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed. Physicians should cease any investigation if the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or if there is conclusive proof of positi ve and beneficial results.  
Medical research involving human subjects should only be conducted if the importance of the objective outweighs the inherent risks and burdens to the subject. This is especially important 
when the human subjects are healthy volun teers.  
Medical research is only justified if there is a reasonable likelihood that the populations in which the research is carried out stand to benefit from the results of the research.  
The subjects must be volunteers and informed participants in the rese arch project.  
The right of research subjects to safeguard their integrity must always be respected. Every 
precaution should be taken to respect the privacy of the subject, the confidentiality of the 
subject’s information and to minimize the impact of the study on the subject's physical and 
mental integrity and on the personality of the subject.  
In any research on human beings, each potential subject must be adequately informed of the 
aims, methods, sources of funding, any possible conflicts of interest, ins titutional affiliations of 
the researcher, the anticipated benefits and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail. The subject should be informed of the right to abstain from participation in the study or 
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -201  Confidential  
Multicenter, Open Label Long -Term Safety Study for Acute Treatment of Migraine  Page 99 of 103 
 
   
     
  
   
   
 
    
   
 to withdraw consent to participate at any time without reprisal. After ensuring that the subject 
has understood the information, the physician should then obtain the subject's freely-given 
informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be obtained in writing, the non-
written consent must be formally documented and witnessed.  
When obtaining informed consent for the research project the physician should be particularly 
cautious if the subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician or may consent under 
duress. In that case the informed consent should be obtained by a well -informed physician who 
is not engaged in the investigation and who is completely independent of this relationship.  
For a research subject who is legally incompetent, physically or mentally incapab le of giving 
consent or is a legally incompetent minor, the investigator must obtain informed consent from the legally authorized representative in accordance with applicable law. These groups should not be included in research unless the research is neces sary to promote the health of the 
population represented and this research cannot instead be performed on legally competent persons.  
When a subject deemed legally incompetent, such as a minor child, is able to give assent to 
decisions about participation in research, the investigator must obtain that assent in addition to 
the consent of the legally authorized representative.  
Research on individuals from whom it is not possible to obtain consent, including proxy or 
advance consent, should be done only if the  physical/mental condition that prevents obtaining 
informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research population. The specific reasons for involving research subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed 
consent should be stated in the experimental protocol for consideration and approval of the 
review committee. The protocol should state that consent to remain in the research should be 
obtained as soon as possible from the individual or a legally authorized surrogate.  
Both authors and publishers have ethical obligations. In publication of the results of research, 
the investigators are obliged to preserve the accuracy of the results. Negative as well as positive 
results should be published or otherwise publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and any possible conflicts of interest should be declared in the publication. Reports 
of experimentation not in accordance with the principles laid down in this Declaration should 
not be accepted for publication.  
C. ADDITIONAL PRINCIPLES FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH COMBINED WITH 
MEDICAL CARE  
   
 Protocol BHV3000 -201  Confidential

 The physician may combine medical research with medical care, only to the extent that the 
research is justified by its potential prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic value. When medical 
research is combined with medical care, additional standards apply to protect the subjects who are research subjects.  
The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new method should be tested against those of 
the best current prophylactic, di agnostic, and therapeutic methods. This does not exclude the 
use of placebo, or no treatment, in studies where no proven prophylactic, diagnostic or therapeutic method exists.  
At the conclusion of the study, every subject entered into the study should be a ssured of access 
to the best -proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods identified by the study.  
The physician should fully inform the subject which aspects of the care are related to the research. The refusal of a subject to participate in a study must never interfere with the subject -
physician relationship.  
In the treatment of a subject, where proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic methods do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent from the subject, m ust 
be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic measures, if in the 
physician’s judgment it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health or alleviating suffering. 
Where possible, these measures should be made the object of  research, designed to evaluate 
their safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information should be recorded and, where appropriate, published. The other relevant guidelines of this Declaration should be followed.

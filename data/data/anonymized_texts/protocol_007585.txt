Controlled Trial.   JMIR Res Protoc  2018 (Feb 12); 7(2):e23.e  
 
Methods  
Trial Design  
A 12-week  single-blind, randomized two- arm trial design was employed to evaluate the 
efficacy of the I -STAND intervention for decreasing sitting time compared to a healthy 
living control group. Enrollment began in February 2016 and data collection finished in 
February  2017.  
Setting  
The study is being conducted by the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research 
Institute (formerly, Group Health Research Institute). All activities were reviewed and 
approved by the Kaiser Permanente Washington  (KPWA)  Institutional Review Board.  
Recruitment  
Potential participants were identified using electronic health records from members of 
Kaiser Permanente Washington . Participants were limited to members whose primary 
care clinics were located in King County, WA t o facilitate in -person appointments.  
Individuals were deemed potentially eligible if their: electronic medical records indicated 
they were aged 60-89, body mass index  was ≥ 30 (to select for a group at risk for  
chronic conditions  who may benefit the most from sedentary time reduction),  and 
enrollment in the health plan was continuous for the prior 12 months . Individuals were 
excluded if they resided in long- term care or a skilled nursing facilit y in the prior 12 
months, had a new cancer or heart failure diagnosis, or had a new diagnosis of 
dementia or serious mental health disorder .  
 Study invitation letters were mailed to a random selection of potentially eligible 
individuals  who met the criteria above. Those who were interested in learning more were 
asked to call study staff for more information.  Up to three mailings were sent to potential 
participants  if they did not respond to the initial invitation or opt out of further contact.  
Interested responders were screened for eligibil ity by phone. Additional eligibility 
requirements were: self-report of sitting ≥ 7 hours per day, able to stand, and able to 
walk one block with or without an assistive device.  
Contacts and Procedures 
Persons  screened as potentially eligible by phone provided oral consent to participate 
and were scheduled for an in- person appointment. They were then mailed an activPAL 
device to wear  on the front middle part of the thigh with a waterproof dressing . 
Participants were provided with clear instructions and photos showing them how to 
adhere the device to their leg . The device was worn on the leg 24 hours a day to assess 
active and sitting time; participants wore the device for at least 7 days prior to coming to 
an in- person baseline assessment .  Participants  completed a log to record their sleeping 
hours.  
 
At the  in-person baseline visit, participants met with a study staff member  who collected 
written informed consent, downloaded their activPAL data, and collected other baseline 
assessment data  (including a questionnaire, biometric assessments, and a fasting blood 
draw) . A separate study health coach  then randomized individuals and met with them to 
inform participants  of their randomization group. Participant s then completed their first 
health coach visit  in person. Participants randomized to the I-STAND intervention arm 
were also provided a Jawbone UP band and trained on how to use it. The baseline visit 
lasted 1.5 -2 hours .   
 
Participants also completed an in- person assessment at 3 months post -randomization. 
Similar to baseline, each person wore an activPAL device for 7 days prior to the visit to assess active and sedentary behavior. During the 3- month visit, the biometric 
asse ssments and blood draw were repeated by a blinded study staff member, and a 
follow -up questionnaire was also administered. Participants received $50 each for 
completing the baseline and 3- month visit. A subsample of I-STAND participants (n = 22) 
were invited to participate in a separate qualitative exit -interview following study 
completion. Interviews were conducted by phone within 10 days of the final session. 
Additional study contacts are outlined as part of the descriptions of the intervention and 
control conditions  (below).  
Randomization & Blinding  
Randomization occurred during the in- person baseline visit. The health coach used an 
automated macro, developed and overseen by the study statistician in Stata, to process 
the participant’s downloaded baseline activPAL data. The macro compute d preliminary 
estimates of activity metrics such as average daily sitting and standing time. Participants 
were randomized in a 1:1 allocation to I -STAND or the healthy living  control. 
Randomization was stratified by baseline average daily sitting time (≥9 hours vs. <9 hours), in permuted blocks of randomly varying size (2 or 4). Staff responsible for 
collecting baseline and follow -up data were blinded to participants’ treatment arm. 
Participants and health coaches were aware of treatment assignment, since individuals 
received a different intervention depending on their assignment.  
I-STAND Intervention  
Theoretical framework . The experimental I -STAND intervention was based on relevant 
behavioral theories including social cognitive theory, the ecological model, and habit 
formation. Social cognitive theory posits that the interaction of individual, social , and 
environment al influences  impact behavior. Specifically , constructs such as self -efficacy, 
social support, goal-setting and action planning, and cues were  deemed important for 
inducing changes in sitting behavior. The ecological model specifies the importance of  
considering influences at the  built environment  level including the home and 
neighborhood environment which could shape sitting behaviors  (Sallis, 2008) . Principles 
of habit formation suggest that unconscious and automatic processes typically underlie decisions to sit. Bringing these decisions into conscious awareness will help make 
decisions to stand (instead of sit) more automatic over time (Lally, 2011) . 
 
Intervention Development .  In our prior work we developed a theory -based ST reduction 
intervention (using the theories above) and tested it over 8 weeks among older adults 
with obesity  (Rosenberg  et al. , 2015) . We then conducted in- depth qualitative interviews 
to refine and improve the program  (Greenwood- Hickman  et al., 2016) . The program 
resulted in a 30 -minute reduction in sitting time, comparable to other preliminary studies 
in older adult populations. The interviews suggested that sitting is a highly ingrained 
habit often performed unconsciously and additional prompts were suggested to help 
constantly remind participants to bring their sitting habits into conscious awareness. These findings further informed the design of the I- STAND intervention.  
 Format
. I-STAND consisted of 2 in -person health coaching sessions  (the first 
immediately following their  baseline measurement visit and the second 1  week later ), 4 
follow -up health coaching phone calls  (every 2 weeks after the first 2 in-person 
sessions ), and written materials.  Participants were also offered email reminders to work 
on their individual goals on the off -weeks of the biweekly calls.   
 
Key C omponents . I-STAND combined the behavioral theories into an approach that 
focused on using inner, outward, and habit reminder s trategies  to enhance awareness of 
sitting behavior  and enabled participants to make simple changes that would enhance 
self-efficacy and reduce sitting time  (see Table 1) . One of the main tools provided to 
participants was a Jawbone UP band (Jawbone®, San Francisco, CA) to provide gentle 
vibrations every 15 minutes of inactivity to remind participants to take breaks from sitting 
regularly throughout the day (serving as an outward reminder) (Rosenberg, 2017) . In 
addition to reminder strat egies, k ey components included: 1) a workbook with biweekly 
content focusing on the various types of reminder  strategies , which  was used with each 
health coaching session; 2) feedback charts  were  provided to participants based on their 
activPAL wear  at baseline and wearing the device at 2 additional check -in points 1 week 
following the baseline week and at the study mid- point ( ~week 6 ). The feedback charts 
included both numeric and graphic depictions of  average daily  waking  time spent sitting, 
standing, and stepping, as well as their total breaks from sitting, sitting bouts lasting 
longer than 30 minutes, and step count; and, 3) health coaching sessions as described 
below.  Table 1 provides an overview and descriptions of  the I-STAND  intervention 
components.  
 
Health coaching sessions . Sessions focus ed on using different types of reminders , 
building self -efficacy through motivational interviewing strategies, problem -solving 
barriers, and setting an action plan consisting of graded individualized goals  using the 
workbook which contained action planning and goal -tracking worksheets . At the first in-
person intervention visit, health coaches met with participants for 1 hour to develop 
rapport , learn more about their daily activit ies, elicit motivations for joining the study, 
provide an intervention overview, and introduce and review study tools, including the 
workbook , feedback chart, and Jawbone UP wristband. They also reviewed safety 
information to ensure that participants would not injure themselves by standing more 
(e.g. stand on a cushioned surface, gradually build the amount of standing time) .  Health 
coaches then worked with the participants to set an action plan with obtainable goals, 
using tailored reminder strategies . During the week  following the baseline week , 
participants wore another activPAL monitoring device and returned in person to meet 
with the health coach. The second in-person visit, which  lasted about  45 minutes,  
focused on  review ing participant progress on their goals and problem -solving barriers  
with the assistance of a second feedback chart from wearing the activPAL the prior 
week ; learning about additional  reminder strategies; and se tting goals for the next 2 
weeks. Thereafter, health coaches met with participants  by phone every 2 weeks (for 
approximately 20- 40 minutes for each session) to review progress on goals, problem -
solve barriers, use the workbook to guide participants on  different types of reminders, 
and set new action plans  at the end of the visit.  Additional topics covered in the 
workbook and health coaching sessions included social support, social environment and 
norms, conducting a home environment audit , and making home and/or work 
environment changes based on the audit results.

Healthy Living Control Condition  
 
Participants in the control condition received 1 in-person health coaching session (after 
the baseline measurements were completed) followed by 5 mailed contacts.  The 
program was based on usual care that is available to members of KPWA . At the in -
person session, participants were provided with a workbook consisting of health 
education on a variety of topics relevant to aging including depression, advance 
directives, nutrition, sleep, pain, and bladder control. Participants were instructed to 
select 1 topic to work on every 2 weeks. Content was derived from online educational 
information available to KPWA  members , which was  approved by Kaiser Permanente 
physicians. During the in- person health coaching session, participants then worked 
through a goal -setting worksheet with the health coach to help ge t them oriented to their 
program . Every 2 weeks, participants  received a check -in letter and were asked to 
complete a form to mail back regarding their progress with their goals.   
Health Coach Training and Fidelity  
The I -STAND and Healthy Living  conditions were delivered by 2 health coaches who 
had relevant degrees but no prior experience with health c oaching.  They were trained by 
the study principal investigator who is a licensed clinical psychologist to use motivational 
interviewing strategies (e.g. reflective listening, open- ended questions, affirmations, and 
summaries) and problem -solving techniques to support behavior change. Fidelity was 
enhanced by using structured scripts for each session and materials in a study workbook specific to the intervention and control group . Initial sessions were audio- recorded and 
reviewed to support health coach training.  All intervention contacts were tracked in a 
Microsoft Access tracking database.   
Assessment Measures  
The primary outcome was total daily wa king hours spent sitting measured  by the 
activPAL micro device (PAL Technologies Ltd, Glasgow, UK) . The activPAL was used 
because it has been feasible  in other studies with older adults  (Rosenberg  et al., 2015; 
Lewis  et al., 2016; Grant  et al., 2008) , is sensitive to change, ( Rosenberg et al. , 2015; 
Kozey- Keadle et al.,  2012)  and has high validity in comparison to direct observations  
(Kozey -Keadle et al., 2011; Larkin et al., 2015; Lyden et al., 2012) . The device was 
initialized,  sealed in a waterproof casing and then adhered to the front center thigh with a 
waterproof medical adhesive (Tegaderm
TM). Participants were instructed n ot to remove 
the device but they were  given additional materials for affixing the device in the event 
that the  adhesive became compromised  or if they developed any irritation. They were 
provided with logs to track their sleep time each day they wore the device.  The data 
were downloaded and processed using proprietary activPAL software and programs 
developed for  Stata and R  statistical software packages. The processing programs  
removed logged sleep time from the data to calculate waking hours spent sitting. Similar 
to standard procedures for accelerometer processing, data were considered valid if wear 
time was greater than 10 hours per day with a minimum of 4 valid days of data for each 
assessment period (Troiano et al., 2008; Matthews  et al., 2012; Ward et al. , 2005) . To 
account for variations in wear time, activPAL outcomes will be  adjusted for wear time. In 
addition to sitting time, activPAL will be used to assess secondary outcomes including 
average daily sit-to-stand transitions, standing time, steps, and bouts of sitting longer 
than 30 minutes.  
 Other secondary outcomes included physiologic measures and a battery of physical 
measures thought to be sensitive to changes in sedentary time and relevant for chronic 
disease. Physical function was measured by the Short Physical Performance Battery 
(SBBP). The SPPB objectively evaluated lower extremity function with tasks for balance, 
gait speed, and lower -extremity strength (chair rise ) (Guralnik, 1995; Gurnalik, 1994) . 
Cardiometabolic outcomes (fasting glucose and a cholesterol panel) were assessed by 
finger prick using an Alere Cholestech LDX System machine and Lipid + Glucose 
cassettes. This device has shown very good agreement with established laboratory 
methods  (Donato, 2015; Carey, 2006; Shepard, 2007) . Blood pressure was measured 
on the left arm using an Omron HEM -907XL digital monitor.  Blood pressure was 
assessed 3 times and the average of the latter 2 measures used.  . 
Exploratory outcomes included cognitive function as measured by the Trail 
Making Test (TMT) Parts A and B (to assess psychomotor speed and fluid cognitive 
abilitie s) (Salthouse, 2011; Lezak, 2004) . Time to complete each task as a raw score will 
be used in analyses.  weight which was measured with a calibrated portable digital scale (Tanita HD- 351) and height with a stadiometer (Seca 213). Waist circumference was 
measured twice at the superior border of the iliac crest. The average of 2 measurements will be used in our analyses (Valsamakis , 2004) . Additional exploratory outcomes were 
self-reported  and included benefits and barriers of sitting reduction (Gardiner , 2011) , 
self-efficacy for reducing sitting time (Gardiner, 2011; Salmon  et al. , 2006; Norman et al. , 
2005; Norman  et al., 2004) , habit formation (Self -Report Habit Index)  (Verplanken et al. , 
2003) , quality of life with the PROMIS global scale (Hays  et al. , 2009) , and depressive 
symptoms with the Patient Health Questionnaire- 8 (Kroenke et al. , 2010; Kroenke et al. , 
2009) .  
Qualitative Assessment  
Qualitative exit -interviews lasted about 45 minutes and followed a semi -structured 
interview guide.  The semi -struc tured interview guide was intended to capture feedback 
on the acceptability of the intervention, barriers and facilitators to sitting reduction, and 
perceived health impacts of sitting reduction.  Only I -STAND participants were 
interviewed. Due to scheduling and other logistics, 22 of the 29 intervention participants 
were interviewed.  The interviews were audio- recorded and transcribed. A formal 
qualitative analysis using thematic analysis and a group of coders will be undertaken to identify barriers and fac ilitators to sitting reduction and guide future refinements to the I -
STAND intervention.

TitleA randomized controlled trial of rivaroxaban for the prevention of major 
cardiovascular events in patients with coronary or peripheral artery disease
(COMPASS -Cardiovascular OutcoMes for People using Anticoagulation 
StrategieS)
Short titleRivaroxaban for the prevention of major cardiovascular events in CAD or PAD (COMPASS)
Clinical study phaseIII
Study objectivesPrim ary objectives for rivaroxaban randomization
To determine whether rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily (bid) + 
aspirin 100 mg once daily (od) compared w ith aspirin 100 mg od 
reduces the risk of a composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death in subjects with CAD or PAD
To determine whether rivaroxaban 5 mg bid compared w ith 
aspirin 100 mg od reduces the risk of a composite of myocardial 
infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death in subjects with CAD or 
PAD
Secondary objectives for rivaroxaban random ization
To determine whether each of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 
100mg od and rivaroxaban 5 mg bid alone reduces the risk of the 
composite of major thrombotic events : (1) coronary heart disease 
death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, acute limb ischemia;(2) cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, 
acute limb ischemia compared w ith aspirin 100 mg od in subjects 
with CAD or PAD
3
To determine whether each of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 
100mg od and rivaroxaban 5 mg bid alone redu ces the risk of 
mortality in subjects with CAD or PAD
Objective for pantoprazole randomization
To determine whether pantoprazole 40 mg od compared w ith 
placebo reduces the risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and gastrointestinal obstructio n or perforation in 
subjects with CAD or PAD receiving antithrombotic medications
Objective for Long -Term  Open -Label Extension (LTOLE)
To make rivaroxaban 2.5 mgtwice daily (bid) + aspirin 100 mg 
once daily (od) available to COMPASS trialsubjects until the 
rivaroxaban treatment is commercially available for this indication
or for approximately 3 years from regulatory approval of LTOLE

2)Diabetes mellitus
3)Renal dysfunction with estimated glomerular filtration rate 
60ml/min
4)Heart failure
5)Non-lacunar ischemic stroke 1 month ago
§ Because CAD involves disease in the coronary vasculature, only one 
additional vascular bed is required: e.g. the aorta and arterial supply to the brain, gastro -intestinal tract, low er limbs, upper limbs, or kidneys.
LTOLE: all subjects randomized to the COMPASS trial willing to consent 
to LTOLE are eligible unless the su bjects develop eda condition c onsidered 
by the investigator as exclusionary.

Study designRandomized, double- blind, controlled trial w ith a 3 x 2 partial factorial 
design
LTOLE: open label uncontrolled study11
MethodologyThe study will comprise 4 periods:  screening, run -in, follow -up, and 
washout.
During the screening period, informed consent will be obtained and 
evaluations of subject eligibility will be performed.  The run -in period w ill 
occur during the 28 days12prior to initiation of study tr eatment, w ith the 
exception of subjects randomized Day 4 -712after coronary artery bypass 
surgery who will not require a run -in.  During run -in, subjects will 
discontinue any current anticoagulant therapy and w ill begin rivaroxaban 
placebo and 100 mg aspirin.  Treatment of subjects who comply with the 
run-in treatment and who remain committed to the study, as well as those 
who are randomized Day 4-712after coronary artery bypass graft surgery 
will begin on Day 0, which will also signal the initiation of the follow -up 
period.  Subjects w illbe randomized 1:1 to pantoprazole or pantoprazole 
placebo and then will be randomized 1:1:1 to rivaroxaban and aspirin or their matching placebos as shown in the treatment regimen design below:

baseline will undergo only a single randomization (to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg 
bid + aspirin 100 mg od, rivaroxaban 5 mg bid + aspirin placebo or 
rivaroxaban placebo + aspirin 100 mg od)
Subjects will be followed for the duration of the study irrespective of 
whether they are receiving study treatment or whether they experience an 
outcome event.  A final visit (Final Follow -up Visit) will mark the end of 
the follow -up period and w ill occur when a minimum of 2,200 subjects 
experience an event for the primary efficacy outcome. A final w ashout 
period visit (End of Washout Telephone Visit) will be conducted by 
telephone ( performed 30 days after the Final Follow -up Visit).
LTOLE: initiation visit and a follow -up period13
Type of controlFor rivaroxaban: active control (aspirin).  For pantoprazole: placebo
LTOLE: none14
Number of subjects12Enrolled = approximately 29,940 ; randomized = approximately 27,400 in 
approximately 33 countries worldwideApproximately 29,940 subjects will be enrolled; approximately 28,300 will 
be admitted to the run -in period and 2000 subjects w ill undergo coronary 
artery bypass graft but no run -in.  A non -compliance rate of 10% is 
anticipated for those subjects in the run -in period; thus, ap proximately 
27,400 subjects w ill be randomized (of which approximately 2000 subjects 
who underw ent coronary artery bypass graft w ould be randomized without 
run-in) in approximately 33 countries worldw ide.
LTOLE: COMPASS trialsubjects are potentially eligi ble.
15
Prim ary variableThe primary efficacy variable will be the time from randomization to the 
first occurrence of the primary efficacy outcome, the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death.
The primary safety variable will be the time from randomization to the first 
occurrence of the primary safety outcome, a modified International Society 
on Thrombosis and Haemostasis major bleeding.
LTOLE: the same primary safety and efficacy variables will be collected in 
LTOLE .
16
Plan for statistical analysisAnalysis of the primary efficacy variable for rivaroxaban or aspirin 
randomization will be based on the intention -to-treat principle. Primary 
hypotheses will be tested using stratified log -rank tests.  Relative risk 
reduction will be estimated with stratified Cox proportional hazards 
models.
LTOLE: all statistical analyses will be descriptive.17

1. Introduction
1.1 Background –amended
Globally  an estimated 17.5 million people died from cardiovascular disease in 2005 (30% of 
all deaths) and this number is projected to increase to 20 million by  2015.( 1)
Coronary  artery  disease (CAD) is the most common cause of cardiovascular disease.  One-
third to one -half of middle -aged males and females in high income countries are expected to 
develop ma nifestations of CAD during their lifetime and the number of patients with chronic 
CAD is rising globally .  Although CAD mortalit y rates have declined in high income 
countries over the past few y ears they  have risen sharply  in Asia, Latin America, the Middl e 
East, and in India and China. Coronary  heart disease remains responsible for about one -third 
of deaths in persons over the age of 35. (1,2)  
Peripheral artery  disease (PAD) of the lower extremities while often undiagnosed is a 
powerful risk marker of cardiovascular disease. (3)  The global prevalence of PAD is less well 
studied than that of CAD but screening studies suggest that approximately  20% of adults older 
than 55 y ears have object ive evidence of PAD .(4)  The disease prevalence is strongl y age -
related and like CAD the numbers of affected patients is rising because of the aging of the 
population.  Best available estimates suggest that 27 million individuals in Europe and North America have PAD and it is likely  that this number can be multiplied by  at least 3 -to 6-fold to 
estimate the global burden of disease. (5)The severity  of PAD is a major determinant of 
subsequent risk of cardiovascular events and mortality .  
Aspirin, statins ,and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are effective and widely 
used for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with CAD and PAD but the risk of vascular events remains high despite these treatments.
   A new , safe ,and convenient 
antithrombotic therap y that further improves efficacy when it is added to or replaces aspirin 
could have a major impact in reducing the individual, community , and global burden of 
disability  and death due to cardiovascular disease.  
Rivaroxaban is an orally  active anticoagulant that selectivel y targets activated coagulation 
factor X (Xa), thereb y inhibiting thrombin generation and thrombus formation.  Rivaroxaban 
has been demonstrated in large phase 3 randomized controlled trials to be a highl y effective 
antithrombotic treatment for the prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism, the prevention of stroke and sy stemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation, and the 
prevention of major cardiovascular events in patients wi th a recent acute coronary  syndrome. 
The evidence of efficacy  of rivaroxaban for the prevention of atherothrombotic events on a 
background of dual antiplatelet therap y in patients with recent acute coronary s yndrome 
supports the hy pothesis that it may  also be effective for prevention of atherothrombotic events 
in patients with established CAD or PAD, receiving usual care.

Further information concerning the results of the rivaroxaban trials is provided in Section 1.2.1.  Details concerning the pharmacology  of rivaroxaban are provided in the 
investigator's brochure, located in the Manual of Operations. 
The trial described herein, Cardiovascular Outc oMes for People using Anticoagulation 
StrategieS (COMPASS), is a randomized double -blind trial utilizing a 3 x 2 partial factorial 
design that will evaluate the efficacy  and safety  of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily  (bid) + 
aspirin 100 mg once daily  (od) ve rsus aspirin 100 mg od and rivaroxaban 5 mg bid versus 
aspirin 100 mg od for the prevention of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular 
death in patients with established CAD or PAD, who are receiving usual care.  In the (partial 
factorial) random ization, patients who do not have a continuous need for use of a proton pump 
inhibitor (PPI) will be randomized to receive pantoprazole 40 mg od or placebo for the 
prevention of major upper gastrointestinal complications, and then randomized to receive 
rivaroxaban in combination with aspirin, rivaroxaban alone ,or aspirin alone.

Long -Term Open -Label Extension –amended
On February  6, 2017, the COMPASS Data Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended 
discontinuation of the rivaroxaban/aspirin arms of the COMPASS trial because of a clear benefit of one of the two rivaroxaban -containing arms. The DSMB recommendation was 
made because for rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 100 mg od , the z -value (test statistic of the 
log-rank test) for efficacy  had crossed the critical value for earl y efficacy  as outlined in the 
DSMB charter consistently  over a 3- month period, and the z -value for rivaroxaban 5 mg bid 
had reached conventional significance for efficacy . The Steering Committee concurred with 
the recommendation of the DSMB, and the sponsor decided to stop the rivaroxaban/aspirin arms of the stud y based on the recommendation of the DSMB and the Steering Committee. 
The sponsor is making rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 100 mg od available earlyfor 
COMPASS trial subjects as part of a long -term open -label extension (LTOLE) protocol 
amendment. The dedicated LTOLE sections in this document describe LTOL E activities only; 
activities related to the pantoprazole/placebo arm remain unchanged with the exception of the 
removal of the washout visit. LTOLE activities will be coordinated with those of the ongoing 
pantoprazole/placebo arms of the trial where possible until pantoprazole/placebo part of the 
trialis completed.

1.2 Study rationale
1.2.1 Rivaroxaban -amended
Rivaroxaban has been tested in randomized controlled trials involving more than 80,00024
patients and has been used by  millions of patients worldwide.  
A pooled anal ysis of 4 trials co mprising the RECORD program involving 12,729 patients 
undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty  demonstrated that rivaroxaban given at a dose of 10 mg

od compared with enoxaparin given at a dose of 30 mg bid or 40 mg od,significantly  reduced 
the risk of sy mptomatic venous thromboembolism and mortality  (odds ratio [OR] 0.48; 95% 
confidence interval [CI]: 0.30 to 0.76), without increasing the risk of major or clinically  
relevant non- major bleeding (OR 1.17; 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.46).( 6)  
The EINSTEIN venous thromboembolism treatment trials involving 9,447 patients with venous thromboembolism demonstrated that rivaroxaban 15 mg bid for 3 weeks followed b y 
20mg od compared with initial low -molecular -weight heparin followed b y warfarin 
(International Normalized Ratio [INR] 2.0 to 3.0) was associated with a similar or reduced risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (deep venous thrombosis [DVT] trial, hazard ratio[HR] 0.68; 95% CI : 0.44 to 1.04; pulmonary  embolism [PE] trial, HR 1.12; 95% CI: 0.75 to 
1.68) with a similar or reduced rate of major bleeding during up to 12 months (DVT trial, HR 0.65; 95% CI : 0.33 to 1.30; PE trial, HR 0.49; 95% CI : 0.31 to 0.79). (7,8)
  In the EINSTEIN 
extension study , rivaroxaban compared with placebo reduced the risk of recurrent venous 
thromboembolism by  more than 80% (HR 0.18; 95% CI  0.09- 0.39) at the expected cost of an 
increase in major bleeding (4 versus 0 events). (8)
The ROCKET AF trial involving 14,264 patients with atrial fibrillation at high risk of stroke demonstrated that rivaroxaban 20 mg od (15 mg od in patients with an estimated glomerular 
filtration rate of 30 to 49 ml/min) compared with warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) was non -inferior 
for the prevention of stroke or s ystemic embolism (HR 0.79; 95% CI: 0.66- 0.96), with a 
significant reduction in life -threatening, intracranial , and fatal bleeding and a favorable effect 
on mortality .(9)
The ATLAS TIMI-51 study  demonstrated that rivaroxaban 2.5 mg or 5 mg bid compared with 
placebo reduced the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke ,or cardiovascular death by  16% (HR 
0.84, 95% CI  0.74- 0.96, p=0.008) in patients with a recent my ocardial infarction, most of 
whom (92%) were also receiving dual antiplatelet therap y.  The reduction in the primary  
efficacy  outcome was driven by  a reduction in both cardiovascular death and my ocardial 
infarction , and rivaroxaban was also associated with 31% reduction in stent thrombosis (HR 
0.69; 95% CI : 0.61- 0.93).  Rivaroxaban increased major and intracranial bleeding, but not 
fatal bleeding. (10)  On a background of aspirin alone, rivaroxaban compared with placebo 
produced consistent benefits and appeared to be associated with no excess of major bleeding, although this was based on modest numbers of patients.
1.2.2 Aspirin and anticoagulants -amended
A large bod y of evidence from randomized controlled trials has established the efficacy  of 
antithrombotic therapies for the prevention of cardiovascular events in high risk individuals. 
Data from the Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration meta -analysis demonstrate the efficacy  
of antiplatelet therap y for prevention of cardiovascular events.( 11) Aspirin reduced the risk of 
myocardial infarction, stroke ,or cardiovascular death by  about one -quarter in patients with 
established coronary , cerebral ,and PAD .  A similar magnitude of benefit was evident across 
the different vascular beds. Aspirin has also been demonstrated to be effective for the prevention o f graft failure following 
coronary  artery  bypass graft (CABG) surgery .(11)Despite these results, however 1 in 3 
patients undergoing CABG surgery  with the placement of two or more graft have at least one

blocked graft at 1 year of follow -up.( 12)  Graft failure is an independent predictor of 
myocardial infarction and death following CABG surgery .  
The CAPRI E trial demonstrated that clopidogrel compared with aspirin reduced the risk of 
myocardial infarction, stroke ,or cardiovascular death by  additional 10% in patients with 
coronary , cerebral , or PAD .(13)  Increasing the intensity  of antiplatelet therapy  by using the 
combination of aspirin and clopidogrel (dual antiplatelet therap y) compar ed with aspirin alone 
further reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events by  20% to 30% in patients with a 
recent acute coronary  syndrome and in those undergoing percutaneous coronary  intervention 
with stent insertion.( 14)  The replacement of clopidogrel by  more potent P2Y (12)receptor 
antagonists such as prasugrel and ticagrelor has provided even greater benefit during the first 12 to 18 months after an acute coronary  event. (15,16)
  However, a benefit of long term dual 
antiplatelet therap y (bey ond the first 12 -18 months) has not been demonstrated. The 
CHARI SMA tri al did not demonstrate a benefit of long -term aspirin and clopidogrel therapy  
(median 28 months) in patients with stable coronary , cerebral ,or PAD or in those at high risk 
of atherothrombotic vascular events, although a benefit was suggested in the subgro up of 
patients with sy mptomatic cardiovascular disease. (17)
Other studies have investigated the potential benefits of combined antiplatelet therap yfor 
long-term prevention of cardiovascular disease. The TRA 2 P -TIMI 50 study  demonstrated 
that the platelet protease-activated receptor 1 antagonist, vorapaxar added to standard therap y 
that included aspirin and clopidogrel, compared with standard therap y alone reduced the risk 
of my ocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death by  13% at 3 years25in patients with a 
history  of m yocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or PAD, but at the cost of an increase in 
major and intracranial bleeding.( 18)  The PEGASUS trial demonstrated that 33 months of 
treatment with ticagrelor (90 mg twice -daily or 60 mg twice -daily) compared with placebo 
reduced the r isk of cardiovascular death, m yocardial infarction, or stroke by 15 -16% 
(ticagrelor 90 mg: 7.85%, ticagrelor 60 mg: 7.77%, placebo 9.04%; p=0.008 and p=0.004, respectivel y) in patients with a history of m yocardial infarction 1 to 3 years earlier. This came 
at the cost of a 2 -3 fold increase in major bleeding (ticagrelor 90 mg: 2.60%, ticagrelor 60 mg: 
2.30%, placebo 1.06%; p<0.01 for each dose vs. placebo), and there was no reduction in total mortality  (ticagrelor 90 mg: 5.15%, ticagrelor 60 mg: 4.69%, placebo 5.16%; p=0.99 and 
p=0.14, respectivel y).(43)
26
The DAPT trial randomized 9,961 patients with a history  of coronary  stenting with a drug 
eluting stent who had completed 12 months of dual antipla telet therap y with a thienopy ridine 
and aspirin to receive continuing clopidogrel 75 mg once dail y or prasugrel 10 mg once dail y 
or placebo for another 18 months. All patients continued receiving aspirin. Continuing treatment with a thienopy ridine as compa red with placebo reduced the rates of stent 
thrombosis by  71% (0.4% vs. 1.4%, p<0.001) and the composite, death, MI  or stroke by  29% 
(4.3% vs. 5.9%, p<0.001) but at the cost of excess moderate or severe bleeding (2.5% vs.

1.6%, p=0.001) and a borderline si gnificant 36% increase in all- cause death from an y cause 
(2.0% vs. 1.5%, p=0.05). ( 44)27
Excess mortality  seen with extended dual antiplatelet ther apy in the DAPT trial was 
confirmed in a subsequent meta -analysis of 10 randomized trials including 31,666 patients 
who had undergone coronary  artery  stenting comparing different durations of dual antiplatelet 
therap y. Shorter duration dual antiplatelet th erapy was associated with an 18% reduction in 
all-cause mortality  (HR 0.82, 95% CI  0.69- 0.98; p=0.02), predominantl y due lower non-
cardiac mortality  (HR 0.67, 0.51 -0.89; p=0.006), with similar cardiac mortality  (HR 0.93, 
0.73-1.17; p=0.52). Shorter duratio n dual antiplatelet therap y was also associated with a lower 
risk of major bleeding (HR 0.58, 0.47- 0.72; p<0.001), but a higher risk of my ocardial 
infarction (HR 1.51, 1.28 -1.77; p<0.001) and stent thrombosis (HR 2.04, 1.48- 2.80; 
p<0.001).( 45)27
Anticoagulation with warfarin and the combina tion of warfarin and single agent antiplatelet 
therap y are also effective for the secondary prevention of cardiovascular events. A 
meta -analysis of randomized controlled trials involving more than 20,000 patients with CAD
demonstrated that moderate intensi ty (INR 2.0 to 3.0) and high intensity  (INR >2.8) warfarin 
compared with control reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events b y 16%to 42%, 
establishing the efficacy  of anticoagulant therapy  for this indication. (19)
Direct randomized comparisons between anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy  have
established the superior efficacy  of warfarin for the prevention of major cardiovascular events 
in patients with established CAD but at the cost of increased bleeding.  Thus, moderate 
intensity  (INR 2.0 to 3.0) or moderate to high intensity  (INR 2.5 to 3.5) warfarin compared 
with aspirin reduces the risk of my ocardia l infarction, stroke or cardiovascular death by  21% 
compared with aspirin (OR 0.79; 95% CI : 0.67 to 0.94), but this was at the cost of a more than 
2-fold increase in major bleeding (OR 2.1; 95% CI 1.7 to 2.7). (19)A subsequent meta -
analysis of randomized controlled trials involving 25,307 patients with established CAD
demonstrated that the combination of warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) and aspirin compared with 
aspirin alone reduced the risk of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke ,and all -cause 
mortality  by 27% (OR 0.73; 95% CI : 0.63 to 0.84).( 20)Once again the reduction in major 
cardiovascular events with warfarin -based therapy was accompanied by  a more than 2- fold 
excess of major bleeding (OR 2.32; 95% CI : 1.63 to 3.29). 
Warfarin has not been as extensively evaluated in patients with PAD but li mited data suggest 
that it also offers benefits in this setting.  The WAVE trial did not find a benefit of warfarin (INR 2.0 to 3.0) plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone for the prevention of my ocardial 
infarction, stroke ,or cardiovascular death in pa tients (n=2,161) with PAD (HR 0.92; 95% CI : 
0.73- 1.16).( 21)  However, the combination was associated with a more than 3- fold excess of 
life-threaten ing bleeding ,and an exploratory  post -hoc anal ysis excluding patients with major 
bleeding suggested an 18% relative risk reduction (HR 0.82; 95% CI : 0.62 to 1.05).

Additional25evidence for the efficacy and safety of oral factor Xa inhibitors for the prevention 
of major cardiovascular events comes from the recently  completed AVERROES trial which 
demonstrated that th e oral factor Xa inhibitor, apixaban, compared with aspirin not only  
reduced the risk of stroke but was also associated with numerically fewer my ocardial 
infarctions with no significant increase in major bleeding.( 22)  
In summary , the randomized trials of antithrombotic therapy in patients with established 
atherothrombotic vascular disease have demonstrated the efficacy  of single agent antiplatelet 
therap y (with aspirin or clopidogrel), anticoagulant therap y (warfarin) ,and the combination of 
single agent antiplatelet and anticoagulant therap y (aspirin and warfarin) for the long term 
secondary  prevention of major cardiovascular events.  Warfarin alone is substantially  more 
effective than aspirin alone, and the combination of warfarin and aspirin provides even greater 
benefits, but is limited by  excess of bleeding.  Furthermore, because of the challenges of 
adjusting the dose of warfarin based on the re sults of routine laboratory  monitoring, it is 
uncommonly  used for long -term prevention of cardiovascular events. 
The data summarized above support the h ypothesis that when given in combination with, or 
instead of aspirin, a new anticoagulant such as rivar oxaban has the potential to y ield 
substantial benefits for the prevention of cardiovascular events in patients with established CAD or PAD .  
1.2.3 Proposed rivaroxaban evaluation -amended
Based on the demonstrated efficacy  and safet y profile of rivaroxaban, rivaroxaban will be 
tested at a dose of 2.5 mg twice dail y plus aspirin compared with aspirin alone, and at a dose 
of 5mg twice dail y compared with aspirin alone ,in a 3 -arm stud y.  We hypothesize that the 
combination of rivaroxaban and aspirin compared wit h aspirin alone will substantially  reduce 
the risk of my ocardial infarction, stroke ,or cardiovascular death and that this benefit will 
readil y outweigh an ypotential28increase in bleeding.  We also h ypothesize that rivaroxaban 
compared with aspirin will r educe the risk of my ocardial infarction, stroke ,or cardiovascular 
death and that this benefit will not be accompanied by  a clinicall y relevant increase in major 
bleeding. 
1.2.4 Long-Term Open -Label Extension -amended29
As described in Section 1.1, due to the clinical effect of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 
100mg od over existing standard treatment with aspirin , the sponsor will offer the 
rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 100 mg od to trial subjects in a long -term open -label 
extension (LTOLE) until the rivaroxaban treatment is commercially  available for this 
indication or for approximately  3 years from regulatory  approval of LTOLE in a country , 
whichever comes first. The same efficacy  and safety variables as in COMPASS will be 
collected in LTOLE in a descriptive way .

Finding s were consistent across the majorit y regions and subgroups.
1.3 Benefit-risk assessment –amended
Considering the use of a new treatment for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, potential 
benefits need to be balanced against the risk.  Bleeding is the most common complication of 
antithrombotic therapy and upper gastrointestinal bleeding accounts for the majority of 
bleeding complications.  The risk of gastrointestinal bleeding increases with increasing intensity  of antithrombotic therapy .  When used for the prevention of cardiovascular disease, 
aspirin compared with placebo/no aspirin is associated with a 50 to 60% relative excess and a 
0.5 to 1% absolute excess risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding. (23,24 )  In the ROCKET -AF 
trial, the 20 mg od dose was associated with an annualized rate of International Society  on 
Thrombosis and Haemostasis (I STH) major and non -major gastrointestinal (GI) combined 
bleeding rate of 3.2/10 0 patient y ears. ( 46)
30
Major bleeding is an independent predictor of risk of death and other major cardiovascular events.( 25,26)  This excess risk may  in part be explained by  confounding ,because patients 
who are more ill are more likely  to experience adverse outcomes and are also more likely  to 
bleed.  However, even minor bleeding leads to discontinuation of effective antithrombotic therapies, thereb y potentially  compromising the efficacy of cardiovascular prevention and 
providing another possible explanation for the excess cardiovascular risk associated with bleeding.  Effective strategies for the prevention of gastrointestinal bleeding have the potential to reduce morbidit y and mortality directly  caused by  bleeding ,but more importantly  may  also 
reduce ischemic cardiovascular events resulting from temporary or permanent interruption in patients treated with rivaroxaban.  
Among patients taking aspirin or the combination of aspirin and clo pidogrel, treatment with a 
PPIsignificantly  reduces the risk of dy spepsia and peptic ulcer disease. (27)  The United States 
Food and Drug Administr ation (US FDA) has issued a warning concerning the use of 
omeprazole but not pantoprazole in combination with clopidogrel.  In the COMPASS trial, the 
efficacy  of pantoprazole will be compared with placebo for the prevention of upper

4.1 Design overview – amended
This Phase 3, event- driven (at least 2,200 primary  efficacy  outcome events), randomized 
controlled trial will have a 3 x 2 partial factorial design and will randomize at least 27,40038
subjects who will receive treatment for an expected average duration of 3 to 4 y ears.  The 
COMPASS trial will involve 4 periods: screening, run -in, follow -up, and washout.
Prescreening procedures may require informed consent in some countries.  In all other study  
sites, informed consent will be obtained prior to the initiation of any  screening proce dures 
(Section 7.1.2.1).38  Screening will be performed to determine subject eligibility  and will 
include the review of inclusion and exclusion criteria, phy sical measurements, laboratory  
evaluations, etc. (Section 7.1.2.2).39

Subjects who successfully complete the run -in period and who remain committed to the study  
as well as those who are being randomized after CABG will be randomized and begin study  
treatments on Day  0, which will also signal the initiation of the follow -up period.  Subjects 
without a continous39need for treatment with a PPIwill be randomized 1:1 to the 
pantoprazole or pantoprazole placebo and all subjec ts (including those subjects who entered 
the study  while alread y receiving a PPI) will then be randomized 1:1:1 to rivaroxaban alone, 
the combination of rivaroxaban and aspirin or aspirin alone, and their matching placebos as shown in Table 4–1:

5D])will be administered at screening/run -inor randomization , or as soon as po ssible 
thereafter, as well as at Month 24 and at the Final Follow -Up visit to collect data on subject 
health and qualit y of life .  The SAGE, MoCA, DSS, and EQ-5D will also be administered at 
the next study  clinic visit after each outcome event. The Interheart Diet Questionnaire and the 
International Ph ysical Activity  Questionnaire will be administered at screening/run- in or
randomization, or as soon as possible thereafter, and at Month 24.   All subjects will be 
followed for the duration of the study , irrespective of whether they  are receiving study  
treatments or whether an event has occurred. Additional follow -up visits will be conducted b y 
telephone at Months 3 and 9.  The Final Follow- up Visit will occur as soon as possible after 
the required p re-specified number of subjects experience a primary  efficacy  outcome event for 
the antithrombotic randomization (close out is expected to occur over a period of about 3 months).  A final washout period visit (End of Washout Telephone Visit) will be conduc ted 
by telephone (performed 30daysafter the Final Follow -up Visit) to collect information on 
outcomes and protocol specific AEs.  Adverse events will continue to be collected up to

42Subjects randomized Day  4-7 after CABG surgery  will undergo the same screening, follow -
up, and washout as other COMPASS trial subjects but not run-in. Subjects are to sign informed consent before or after the surgery .
  Randomization will occur between Day 4-7
after surgery , at least 24 hours following the removal of chest tubes.  The first dose of study  
drug should not be administered until at least 12 hours after last administratio n of an y 
anticoagulant (including DVT proph ylaxis) (Section 7.1.1 Tabulated overview).
Subjects randomized Day  4-7 after CABG surgery  will undergo computed tomograph y (CT)  
angiograph y at 1 yearor later as part of the study  protocol to assess graft patency  unless they  
have a specific contraindication for CT angiography  (e.g., contrast allergy , estimated 
glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min). In the event the subject undergoes an invasive 
coronary  angiography  at approximately  1 year or later post CABG for an y reason, a CT 
angiogram may  not be required.

Thelong-term open -label extension (L TOLE) will provide open- label rivaroxaban 2.5mg bid
+aspirin 100mg od to COMPASS subjects until itis commercially  available or for 
approximately 3 years from regulatory  approval of L TOLE in a country , whichever comes 
first. The implementation of LTOLE is an amendment to the COMPASS trial. 
For inclusion and exclusion criteria, see Section 5.1.3 ; for treatment relate d details, see 
Section 6.1.3 (Treatment to be administered) , Section 6.6(Drug logistics and accountabilit y),

The same primary  efficacy  and safet y outcomes collected in the COMPASS trial will be

4.3 Justification of the design
4.3.1 Overall design rationale –amended
The primary  objective of the COMPASS trial is to determine whether rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid 
+ aspirin 100 mg od (Arm A) compared with aspirin 100 mg od (Arm C) reduces the risk of 
the composite of my ocardial infarction, str oke, or cardiovascular death in subjects with CAD 
or PAD and, similarly , to determine whether rivaroxaban 5.0 mg bid + aspirin placebo od 
(Arm B) compared with aspirin 100 mg od (Arm C) reduces the risk of the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke ,or cardiovascular death in subjects with CAD or PAD .  The 
event -driven, double -blinded, 3 x 2 partial factorial design was selected for this study  to 
support a rigorousl y controlled approach that would minimize study  bias while focusing on 
the effects of treatment on the composite of the expected outcomes (my ocardial infarction, 
stroke, or cardiovascular death) in this study  population. 
The benefit of increased
45intensity  of antithrombotic therap y for the prevention of recurrent 
thrombotic cardiovascular events b y adding a second agent to aspirin has been established in 
trials of dual antiplatelet therap y after an acute coronary s yndrome when compared with 
aspirin alone.  Additionally , a benefit has been shown in trials of combined warfarin and 
aspirin aft er myocardial infarction compared with aspirin alone. 
The potential for the combination of rivaroxaban and aspirin to prevent thrombotic cardiovascular events after an acute coronary  syndrome compared with aspirin alone has been 
investigated in previous r ivaroxaban trials.  A pooled post hoc anal ysis of the data from 
patients with an acute coronary  syndrome in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials (ATLAS TIMI 46 
and A TLAS TIMI 51) suggests  that the effect size of rivaroxaban plus aspirin compared to 
aspirin alon e for the composite outcome of CV death, my ocardial infarction, and stroke (HR

0.66, 95% CI  0.46- 0.96,  p=0.026) (data on file) is at least double the effect size seen in the 
primary  anal ysis of the ATL AS 51 trial (HR 0.84, 95% CI  (0.74 -0.96, p=0.008).  For patients 
who do not have an ongoing indication for dual antiplatelet therap y but have a residual risk of 
cardiovascular events, it is expected that the addition of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid to standard 
dose of aspirin 100 mg will provide additional benefit compared to aspirin alone.  
Not all trials of combined antithrombotic therapy  have shown a benefit, but where there was a 
lack of benefit it could be explained either by the risk profile of the patients included in the trial (e.g., in the CHARISMA trial, clopidogrel plus aspirin was effective for secondary  
prevention in the subgroup of patients with established vascular disease but not in those without a history  of symptomatic vascular disease) or b y an excess of bleeding of the 
experimental treatment (e.g., in the WAVE trial, warfarin plus aspirin was associated with a substantial excess of bleeding compared with aspirin which substantially  attenuated the 
benefits).
To date, no trials have directl y compared a new anticoagulant with aspirin for long -term 
secondary  prevention of cardiovascular disease .  Prior efforts to identify  more effective 
antithrombotic treatments than aspirin have focused on new antiplatelet therapies (terutroban, 
a platelet thromboxane receptor antagonist; clopidogrel, prasugrel ,and t icagrelor , P2Y12
45
antagonists; and vorapaxar, a PAR -1 receptor antagonist) and warfarin.  In most cases, the 
benefit of the experimental treatmen t has either been of insufficient magnitude to warrant a 
switch in treatment (e.g., clopidogrel, prasugrel) or has been accompanied by a substantial excess of bleeding (e.g., vorapaxar, ticagrelor
46, warfarin).  The promise of a new 
anticoagulant such as rivaroxaban (rivaroxaban 5.0 mg as explored in Arm B) is highlighted 
by the results of the AVERROES study  which demonstrated superior efficacy  of apixaban 
compared with aspirin for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation as well as numerical ly fewer m yocardial infarctions and no significant excess in bleeding. (22)
The use of aspirin -alone antiplatelet therap y for atherosclerotic CAD a nd PAD is widely  
accepted .
47As such, most patients will be candidates for aspirin monotherapy.  This is in line 
with current practice guidelines and the current prescribing information for secondary prevention.   The dose of aspirin being tested in COMPASS is 100mg/d.  
4.3.2 Design rationale for Long -Term Open -Label Extension −amended48
Due to the clinical efficacy  of rivaroxaban 2.5mg bid + a spirin 100mg od (see Section 1.2.4), 
participation in the LTOLE will be offered to all subjects who meet the LTOL E 
Inclusion/Exclusion criteria defined in Section 5.1.3.
4.4 Final follow -up visit and end of study -amended
The primary  anal ysis will be based on the events that occur between randomization and the 
Final Follow -up Visit.  The date of the Final Follow -up Visit cann ot be pre -determined as this 
study  is event -driven but the visit will occur when at least 2,200 subjects experience an event

for the primary  efficacy  outcome.  All subjects will remain in follow -up until this minimum 
number of primary outcome events has been reached, irrespective of whether they  are still 
taking stud y treatments or whether they have experienced an outcome.  The Final Follow -up 
Visit and the subsequent 30 -daywashout period will occur nearly  simultaneously  (as 
scheduling permits) for all stu dy subjects.  
For each participating European Union (EU) country , the end of the study  according to the EU 
Clinical Trial Directive will be reached when the telephone call at the end of the 30 day  
washout period for the last subject for all centers in the respective country  has occurred.  The 
end of the study as a whole will be reached as soon as the end of the stud y according to the 
above definition has been reached in all participating countries (EU and non -EU).
Long -Term Open -Label Extension − amended
The final visits of LTOLE will begin, per country , when the duration reaches 3 y ears from the 
regulatory  approval of LTOL E or therivaroxaban treatment is commercially  available for this 
indication in the respective country ,whichever comes first . The subj ect should be called in for 
the final visit within approximately  3 months or atlatest the final visit may  be conducted at 
the next scheduled visit.49  
5. Study population - amended
Multiple strategies will be employ ed to identify  subjects potentially  eligibl e for this study .  
These will include (but are not restricted to) database screening, chart screening ,and patient 
screening at phy sician offices and at internal medicine, cardiology ,and vascular 
disease/imaging clinics.  The approach at individual center s will vary  according to phy sician, 
office, or hospital environment, and ethical considerations. 
Approximately  28,300 eligible subjects will be admitted to the run -in period and an additional 
2000 will be enrolled post CABG and without run- in.  Approximately  10% of run -in subjects 
are expected to either be non- compliant with treatment or to decline further interest in 
participating; thus, the study  will randomize approximately  27,400 men and women with 
objectively confirmed CAD or PAD from approximately  33 countries worldwide.50
Subjects with high risk of incident cardiovascular disease will be enrolled in the study . 
Subjects will be treated with rivaroxaban, the combination of rivaroxaban and aspirin ,or 
aspirin on top of usual care. Investigators in the study  are selected based on their 
qualifications and ability to enroll and treat these subjects in accordance with the protocol and applicable standard of care.

5.1.3 Long-Term Open -Label Extension −amended54
Allsubject sfrom COMPASS trial will be invited to join LTOLE as long as they  continue to 
meet the COMPASS eligibility  criteria (refer to sections 5.1.1 and 5.1.2) plus the specific 
ones for LTOLE (refer to sections 5.1.3.1 and 5.1.3.2 ). All L TOLE subjects must provide 
written informed consent to participate in LTOLE .
5.1.3.1 Inclusion criteria
All subject s randomized to the COMPASS trial willing to consent to L TOLE are 
eligible u nless the subjects developed a condition considered by  the investigator as 
exclusionary .
Subject s who have given their written informed consent to participate in the L TOLE 
after having received adequate information prior to any  LTOLE specific procedures.
5.1.3.2 Exclusion criteria
Subjects should not be included if, in the judgement of the investigator, they  have 
developed a condition which should exclude them from receiving LTOLE study  
medication. For example if the subject has developed atrial fibrillation or h ad a severe 
allergic rash while in the study , which subsided when drug was stopped and returned 
when drug was reinitiated.
5.2 Discontinuation of subjects from study treatment -amended
All subjects will be encouraged to remain on treatment and under observation for the full duration of the study .  However, at any  time during the study  and without giving reasons, 
subjects may  withdraw from the study  at their own request or at the request of their legall y 
acceptable representative.  The subject will not suffer any disadvantage as a result.  In all cases, the reason for permanent discontinuation of study treatments (including “at the subject’s request”) must be recorded in the case report fo rm (CRF) and in the subject's 
medical records.  
It is important to note that discontinuation of study  treatment is not the equivalent to 
withdrawal of informed consent.  Additionally , withdrawal of consent does not withdraw 
permission to collect vital sta tus.  Withdrawal of this consent must be made separatel y.  In 
cases where subjects indicate they  do not want to “continue”, investigators must determine 
whether this refers to discontinuation of study treatment (the most common expected 
scenario), unwillin gness to attend follow -up visits, unwillingness to have telephone contact, 
unwillingness to have any  contact with study  personnel, or unwillingness to allow contact 
with a third part y (e.g., family  member, doctor).  In all cases, including the subjects who
have had any of the primary study outcome events, every effort must be made to 
continue to follow the subject at regular study visits.
55Additionally, survival status and 
outcome information must be determined for all subjects.53

The LTOLE treatment will be open -label rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 100 mg od .
6.2 Identity of study treatment -amended
All study  drugs will be labeled in the local language according to the requirements of local 
law and legislation and will include no information about the subject except for the
medication number .  Label text will be approved according to the sponsor’s agreed 
procedures, and a copy of the labels will be made available to the stud y site upon request. For 
the purpose of this study , the term “aspirin” is used interchangeabl y with th e term “acet yl 
salicy lic acid”.60
For all stud y drugs, a s ystem of numbering in accordance with all requirements of Good 
Manufacturing Practice ( GMP )will be used, ensuring that each dose of study drug can be 
traced back to the respective bulk ware of the i ngredients.  L ists linking all numbering levels 
will be maintained by  the sponsor’s clinical supplies quality assurance (QA) group. 
Acomplete record of batch numbers and expiry  dates of all study  treatment as well as the 
labels will be maintained in the sponsor study  file.
6.3 Treatment assignment -amended
For subjects who successfully  complete the run- in period, the investigator or delegate will 
access the  randomization and drug management sy stem to confirm eligibility  and 
compliance to run -in rivaroxaban placebo bid and aspirin od and to obtain the randomized 
treatment allocation.61
The  randomization and drug management sy stem will assign the subject a unique 
number for each medication that corresponds to one of the treatments listed in Table 4–1.

6.4 Dosage and administration -amended
Study  medication will be taken orall y.  Study rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo is taken twice 
daily  (generally  morning and evening, approximately  12 hours apart) and study  aspirin/aspirin 
placebo and stud y pantopra zole/pantoprazole placebo are taken once dail y, generall y in the 
morning.  The first doses of study drug should be administered on the day  of randomization ,
or at least 12 hours after the last dose of antithrombotic medication if being randomized post -
CABG.63   
If a dose of study  rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo is missed and less than 6 hours have 
elapsed since the time that the missed dose was due, it should be taken immediately .  If more 
than 6 hours have elapsed since the missed dose was due, the dose sh ould be skipped and the 
next dose of study  rivaroxaban should be taken according to schedule.
If a dose of study  aspirin/aspirin placebo or study  pantoprazole/pantoprazole placebo is 
missed it should be taken as soon as the subject becomes aware that the d ose has been missed. 
6.4.1 Dose modifications -amended
The investigator should interrupt study  drug for a given subject if continuation is deemed to 
be detrimental to the subject’s well -being.  All subjects who interrupt study  drug should 
resume treatment when possible.  If there is concern that the subject may be intolerant of 
study  treatments or if the subject is reluctant to take the full dose of study  treatments, a 
possible approach to restarting stud y medications is to reduce the frequency of dosing (eg, to 
once -daily or alternate -daily ).64Irrespective of whether or not treatment is resumed, all 
subjects must be followed according to the stud y protocol until the end of the study .  
Permanent study  drug interruption should be recorded on the corresponding follow -up case 
report form, giving the date and primary  reason for stopping the study  drug.  If one of the 
study  treatments needs to be discontinued65, other study  treatments must be continued.  For 
example, if study  rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo is interru pted, study  aspirin/aspirin 
placebo and stud y pantoprazole/pantoprazole placebo should be continued.

6.4.2.1 Guidance for the treatment of subjects who require an invasive 
procedure - amended
If the subject requires an invasive procedure that is associated with a standard or high risk of bleeding (i.e., an y procedure that is not considered “minor”), stud y rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban 
placebo must be interrupted.  Study  aspirin/aspirin placebo may  also be interrupted, at the 
discretion of the investigator.  If stud y aspirin/aspirin placebo is interrupted, non-study  aspirin 
may be used.
67
Dosing recommendations before and after invasive procedures and surgical intervention
If an invasive procedure or surgical intervention is required, rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo 
should be stopped at least 24 hours before the intervention, if possible and based on the clinical judgment of the phy sician.  If the procedure cannot be delayed, the increased risk of 
bleeding should be assessed against the urgency of the intervention.  Rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo should be restarted after the invasive procedure or surgical intervention as soon as possible, provided the clinical situation allows and adequat e hemostasis has been established.
If surgery  is urgent or needed in an emergency  situation, the risk of bleeding must be weighed 
against the risk of delay ing surgery .  The total daily  dose of rivaroxaban in subjects 
randomized to receive 5 mg bid is equiv alent to the proph ylactic dose that was tested in major 
orthopedic surgery  trials and this dose of rivaroxaban is not expected to substantially  increase 
the risk of bleeding.  The total daily  dose of rivaroxaban in subjects randomized to receive 
rivaroxaba n 2.5 mg bid is only  half that of the orthopedic thromboprophy laxis dose although 
these subjects will also be receiving treatment with aspirin.  If there is a concern about the risk of bleeding in a subject who requires urgent or emergency  surgery , unblinding may  be 
considered but should only be performed if knowledge of randomized treatment allocation 
will influence clinical management (Section 6.5).  A two- unit single donor platelet transfusion 
in subjects treated with the combination of aspirin and rivaroxaban may  restore the capacit y to 
generate thromboxane and thereby overcome the antiplatelet effects of aspirin. (29)

6.4.2.2 Guidance for the treatment of subjects who require coronary artery 
bypass graft surgery –amended
CABG surgery can occur immediately  prior to randomization or it may  occur in randomized 
subjects who later develop a need for the surgery .   
Subjects who are scheduled to be randomized  Day  4-7 after CABG surgery  will not 
participate in the run -in phase ( Section 4.1.1).  Randomization should only  be performed 
between Day 4-7 post -CABG and at least 24 hours following the removal of chest tubes .

Study  drug should not be administered until at least 12 hours after last administration of any  
anticoagulant (including DVT proph ylaxis).69
Subjects who are scheduled for CABG surgery  during the course of the trial ideally  should 
interrupt study  rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban plac ebo at least 24 hours before CABG surgery  in 
order to minimize the risk of bleeding.  Study  aspirin/aspirin placebo may  be interrupted 
and/or non- study  aspirin may  be used or at the discretion of the investigator.  The timing of 
resumption of study  antithr ombotic therap y after surgery is at the discretion of the investigator 
but, in general, study rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo or study aspirin/aspirin placebo should be resumed once the chest tubes are removed and hemostasis is secure.  Study  
rivaroxaban/r ivaroxaban placebo should be interrupted if subjects require in- hospital 
anticoagulant thromboprophy laxis.  I n all cases, the goal should be to resume study  
antithrombotic drugs within 14
73days and prior to being discharged from hospital.70  
Long -Term Open -Label Extension − amended71
The same guidance will apply  to LTOLE. For subjects who are scheduled to undergo CABG, 
LTOLE treatment can be init iated four day s after CABG and at least 24 hours after the 
removal of chest tubes . LTOL E treatment should not be administered until at least 12 hours 
after last administration of an y anticoagulant (including DVT proph ylaxis).72
6.4.2.3 Guidance for the treatment of subjects who develop an acute coronary 
syndrome and those who require percutaneous coronary intervention 
with stenting –amended
Study  rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo should be interrupted in subjects who require 
anticoagulant or dual antiplatelet therap y because of an acute coronary  syndrome or need for 
percutaneous coronary  intervention with stenting.  Standard antiplatelet therapy , including 
loading doses of aspirin and clopidogrel (or prasugrel or ticagrelor) can be administered 
according to usu al practice.   Study  aspirin/aspirin placebo may  be continued. Standard 
anticoagulant therapy can be used without regard to the timing of the most recent dose of study  rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo because the doses of rivaroxaban being tested in the 
COM PASS trial are lower than the 15
73or 20 mgdose given for stroke prevention in atrial 
fibrillation and the half -life is short, 5 -13 hours.  
Subjects who remain on long term dual antiplatelet therapy  may commence “interim study  
rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban plac ebo” once any non-study  anticoagulant therapy  is stopped. 
Study  aspirin/placebo may  be continued.74The difference between interim study  
rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo and study rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo is that during the period of dual antiplatel et therapy  all subjects will receive rivaroxaban at a dose of 2.5 mg bid 
(i.e., the dose of rivaroxaban in those previously  allocated 5 mg bid will be reduced to 2.5 mg 
bid). Subjects previously allocated 2.5 mg bid will continue on the same dose whereas those

6.4.2.4 Guidance for the treatment of subjects who overdose on study 
rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo –amended
If rivaroxaban overdose is suspected, the use of activated charcoal up to 8 hours after 
overdose to reduce absorption may  be considered.  Due to its low solubility , rivaroxaban 
absorption plateaus at doses of 50 mg and above, thus limiting exposure in the majority  of 
subjects. Gastrointestinal absorption of rivaroxaban is reduced in subjects exposed to high 
oral doses and thus the anticoagulant effect of an overdose of rivaroxaban is expected to be 
limited. If available, consideration may be given to the use of a specific reversal agent.76
Long -Term Open -Label Extension − amended
The same guidance will apply  to LTOLE.77
6.4.2.5 Guidance for the treatment of subjects who experience a major bleed –
amended
Temporary  discontinuation of rivaroxaban is expected to be sufficient to control bleeding in 
most cases because the drug half -life is onl y 5-13 hours.  L ocal measures should be applied if 
needed to control bleedin g (e.g., local pressure, endoscopy  and injection of a bleeding vessel, 
embolization) and intravenous fluids and blood transfusion support should be provided as 
indicated.  In the rare case of life -threatening bleeding, the investigator may  consider 
obtaining advice from a hematologist.  Animal studies suggest that both prothrombin complex concentrates and recombinant factor VIIa partiall y restore hemostasis following treatment 
with factor Xa inhibitors such as rivaroxaban and a randomized trial involving he althy  
subjects treated with rivaroxaban has demonstrated that prothrombin concentrates reverse prolongation of the prothrombin time.( 30)  Rivaroxaban cannot be dial yzed as it is highly

6.4.2.6   Guidance for the treatment of subjects who develop a stroke and who 
are being considered for reperfusion therapy – amended
The decision to use reperfusion therapies (including intravenous, intra -arterial thromboly sis,
or mechanical endovascular approaches) in acute ischemic stroke should follow local practice, experience, and guidelines. At present there are limited data to guide treatment in this setting in subjects taking rivaroxaban. The following guidance is intended to aid clinical decision making in this setting. 
At or arou nd the time of the peak drug levels (we suggest in the first 6 hours after a dose), 
clinicians may  choose to unblind and to avoid thromboly sis if the subject is taking 
rivaroxaban. Alternatively, if it is possible to obtain a rivaroxaban anti-Xa level in t his time 
period, clinicians may  use this information to decide on the appropriateness of starting 
thromboly sis. Endovascular therap y with clot extraction can proceed whether or not the 
subject is receiving rivaroxaban without the need to unblind.

The decision to use reperfusion therapies (including intravenous, intra -arterial thromboly sis, 
or mechanical endovascular approaches) in acute ischemic stroke should follow local practice, 
experience, and guidelines. At p resent there are limited data to guide treatment in this setting 
in subjects taking rivaroxaban. The following guidance is intended to aid clinical decision making in this setting. 
At or around the time of the peak drug levels (we suggest in the first 6 h ours after a dose), 
clinicians may  consider to avoid thromboly sis. I f it is possible to obtain a rivaroxaban anti -Xa 
level in this time period, clinicians may  use this information to decide on the appropriateness 
of starting thrombol ysis. 
6.5 Blinding
Subjects, site personnel, sponsor personnel,  staff (with the exceptions mentioned 
below), persons performing the assessments, and data anal ysts will remain blinded to the 
identity  of the treatment from the time of randomization until database lock.  R andomization 
data are to be kept strictly  confidential until the time of unblinding and will not be accessible 
by anyone else involved in the study  with the following exceptions: (1)  information 
technology  (IT) computer programmers who work on the  randomization and drug 
management s ystem; and (2) the  unblinded biostatistician who prepares reports for the

DSMB and provides unblinded information to Bayer for required regulatory  reporting 
(suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions [SUSAR] reporting).  These individuals will 
not be involved in the day -to-day running of the study .
In compliance with applicable regulations, in the event of a SUSAR that was believed to be related to study treatment, the subject’s treatment code will usually be unblinded before 
reporting to the health authorities, ethic committees and investigators.
Emergency unblinding by the investigator
Emergency  unblinding should only  be undertaken when it is essential for subject safet y and 
will only  be provided for the treatment that requires unblinding.  Most often, study  drug 
interruption and knowledge of the possible treatment assignments are sufficient to treat a 
study  subject who presents with an emergency  condition. Detailed information concerning 
unblinding procedure s isprovided in the Manual of Operations.  I n case of unblinding, only  
those individuals who are required to know treatment allocation may be given this information.  All others must remain blinded to treatment, including the subject.  All subjects should resume study  treatments after recovery  if it is medically  appropriate to do so and 
should be followed until the end of the stud y.
Long -Term Open -Label Extension –amended
The LTOLE is open label and no blinding procedures are applicable to the L TOLE.

6.6 Dr ug logistics and accountability - amended
Each stud y site will be supplied with study  medication kits for the run- in (2 pill bottles) and 
additional study  supply for the follow -up phase (and will be re -supplied throughout the study , 
as needed).  The stud y medication supply  will have appropriatel y labeled packaging according 
to national law and GMP ruling.  The stud y medication packaging has a 2 -part tear-off label.  
A unique medication number will be printed on each part of this label, which corresponds to one of the unique treatment arms for the blinded randomized treatment period.  I nvestigator 
staff will identify  the study  drug package(s) to dispense to the subject by  accessing the  
randomization and drug management s ystem and obtaining the medication number(s).  At the 
time of dispensing, one part of the 2 -part label will be removed and affixed to the subject’s 
drug dispensing log and the other will remain on the study  medication package.  
All study  drugs will be stored at the investigational site in accordance with GCP and Good 
Manufacturing Practices (GMP) requirements and the instructions given b y the clinical 
supplies department of the sponsor (or its affiliate), and will be inaccessible to unauthorized personnel.  Special storage conditions and a complete record of batch numbers and expiry  
dates can be found in the sponsor study  file; the site -relevant elements of this information will 
be available in the investigator site file.  The responsible site personnel will confirm the date
83
of receipt of study  drug and will use the study  drug only within the framework of this clinical 
study  and in accordance with this protocol.  Receipt, distribution, return and destruction (if 
any) of the study  drug must be properl y documented according to the agreed and specified

6.9.1 Combined CYP 3A4 and p-glycoprotein inhibitors and CYP 3A4 inducers -
amended
Strong inhibitors of both CYP 3A4 and p- glycoprotein increase plasma concentrations of 
rivaroxaban and are contraindicated in subjects taking rivaroxaban. These include systemic azole antifungal drugs (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole , etc.), and HIV protease 
inhibitors.  Additionally , strong inducers of CYP 3A4 such as rifampicin, rifabutin, 
phenobarbital, phen ytoin, and carbamazepine can reduce the plasma concentrations of 
rivaroxaban. If any of these treatments are needed, randomized study 
rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo must be temporarily  discontinued and open- label aspirin 
should be begun.

6.9.3 Anticoagulant treatment -amended
Subjects who develop a need for anticoagulant therap y (e.g., thromboprophylaxis in subjects 
undergoing major orthopedic surgery , acute venous thromboembolism, atrial fibrillation, 
mechanical aortic valve replacement) must interrupt study  rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo.  
Study  rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo must be restarted in subjects who no longer have a 
need for non -study  anticoagulant therapy  (e.g., after completion of anticoagulant 
thromboprophy laxis or anticoagulant treatment for venous thromboembolism).  I n subjects 
who develop a need for anticoagulant therap y, study  aspirin/aspirin placebo may also be 
interrupted, at the discretion of the investigator.94  
If proph ylactic anti coagulation is required, subjects should start the first dose of open 
prophy lactic anticoagulation at the time that the next dose of study  rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban 
placebo is due.  If study  drug is interrupted and the subject is transitioned to an anticoagu lant 
with a slow onset of action, bridging therap y ma y be needed.
If therapeutic anticoagulation is required, subjects should start therapeutic anticoagulation immediately , irrespective of the timing of the last dose of study  rivaroxaban.  
Long -Term Open -Label Extension − amended
95
Subjects who develop a need for anticoagulant therapy (e.g., thromboprophy laxis in 
subjects undergoing major orthopedic surgery , acute venous thromboembolism, atrial 
fibrillation, mechanical aortic valve replacement) must discontinue L TOLE medication. 
Guidance for converting see below:
Converting from rivaroxaban to oral anti -coagulants
Rivaroxaban affects INR, so INR measurements made during co -administration with oral 
anticoagulant may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of oral anticoagulant. 
One approach is to discontinue rivaroxaban and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and oral VKA at the time the next dose of rivaroxaban would have been taken.
Converting from rivaroxaban to parenteral anti -coagulants
Discontinue rivaroxaban and give the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the ti me that 
the next rivaroxaban dose would be taken.
Study rivaroxaban can be restarted at the discretion of the investigator in subjects who 
no longer have a need for non- study  anticoagulant therapy  (e.g., after completion of

anticoagulant thromboprophy laxis or anticoagulant treatment for venous thromboembolism). 
Guidance for restarting see below:
Converting patients from VKAs to rivaroxaban
When converting patients from VKAs to rivaroxaban, INR values will be falsely  elevated 
after the intake of rivaroxaban. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity  
of rivaroxaban, and therefore should not be used. 
Converting patients from p arenteral antico agulant to rivaroxaban
For patients currentl y receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, start rivaroxaban 0 to 2 hours 
before the time of the next scheduled administration of the parenteral drug (e.g. LMWH) or at the time of discontinuation of a continuously administered parenteral drug (e.g. 
intravenous unfractionated heparin). 
6.9.4 Proton pump inhibitor treatment -amended
Subjects who develop a continuous96need for treatment with a PPIduring the study96(e.g., 
gastroduodenal ulcer) should discontinue study  pantoprazole/pantoprazole placebo while 
receiving non- study  PPI treatment.  Study  pantopr azole/pantoprazole placebo should96be 
restarted in all subjects who no longer have a continuous96need for PPItherapy . 
7. Procedures and variables
7.1 Schedule of procedures − amended
The study  schedule comprises 4 periods:  screening, run- in, follow -up, and washout.  The trial 
will require clinic visits at screening (in most cases this visit is expected to coincide with the run in visit), run- in, randomization, 1 and 6 months after randomization ,and at least every  6
month sthereafter until the end of the stud y.  Study staff will contact s ubjects by  phone at 
Month 3, Month 9 and at the End of Washout Telephone Visit (30 day s post Final Follow -up 
Visit).  Some centers may  also perform pre -screening visits.  Further details are provided in 
the Manual of Operations.  
A tabulated overview ( Table 7–1) of the procedures conducted in each of these periods is 
provided in Section 7.1.1 and the procedures and their timing are described in more detail in 
Section 7.1.2. 
Early termination of rivaroxaban/aspirin arms of COMPASS − amen ded
On February  6, 2017, the COMPASS Data Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended 
discontinuation of the rivaroxaban/aspirin arms of the COMPASS trial. The PPI  comparison

7.5.1 E6 Definition of (serious) adverse event -amended
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence including an exacerbation of a pre -existing 
condition or abnormal laboratory  finding in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have to have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. 
A serious adverse even t (SAE) is classified as an y untoward medical occurrence that, at an y 
dose, results in death, is life -threatening, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of 
existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability  / incapacity  is a 
congenital anomal y / birth defect and/or is another medically important serious event 
representing a significant hazard, which is comparable to the aforementioned criteria.124
Note:  If a subject is hospitalized or has a procedure that was planned or an ticipated prior to 
the subject signing the informed consent, the hospitalization/procedure is considered part of 
medical  history  or a therapeutic intervention and is not the result of an (S)AE unless the 
severit y has worsened or changed unexpectedly. Addi tionally , a procedure is not an (S)AE, 
but the reason for the procedure may  be an (S)AE.125
7.5.2 Causal relationship - amended
The assessment of the causal relationship between an AE and the administration of study  drug 
is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the CRF. The causality  assessment should be done separatel y for each study treatment as detailed 
in the CRF. The assessment is based on the question whether there was a “reasonable causal relationship” to the study drug in question.

Appropriate information concerning adverse events will be sy stematical ly collected and 
submitted to regulatory  authorities and all data on safet y and outcomes will be reviewed 
regularl y by an unblinded Data and Safet y Monitoring Board.

7.5.3.2 Reporting of (S)AEs - amended
The following events are to be reported to  on the SAE/ESI  CRF within 24 hours of the 
investigator becoming aware of the event/diagnosis.129Bayer HealthCare 
Pharmacovigilance129is responsible for reporting these even ts to the health authority :129
Any non-cardiovascular death of a subject occurring after signing informed consent or 
prior to the end of monitoring for adverse events. (note: fatal bleeding events are 
primary  safety  outco mes and are exempted)129
Any non- cardiovascular SAEs not listed in Section 7.5.3.1
Any non- cardiovascular AE that recurs when the subject is restarted on study  drug 
(positive re -challenge).129
In addition, any  AEs of particular concern to the investigator may  be recorded on the CRF to 
bring them to the attention of the sponsor.
7.5.3.3 Adverse events of special safety interest -amended
For ongoing pharmacovigilance, the large COMPASS trial is an opportunity to identify  rare 
events in the population that may  or may  not be drug -related.  The following events have, to 
date, not been observed with increased frequency with rivaroxaban, but ar e considered AEs of 
special safety  interest. These events must be reported to  independent of their 
seriousness, but within the same timelines as an SAE (within 24 hours) by  reporting them on 
the SAE page of the CRF. Bayer HealthCare Pharmacovigilance may decide to upgrade the 
event based on the information received.
Pregnancy  outcome and any  congenital anomaly131
Events currently  under observation by  Bayer HealthCare Pharmacovigilance and 
which may  be unusual in the absence of drug therapy  in the study  population.  The 
types of events that fall into this category  are listed in Table 7–4.
Events of special interest that are mild or moderate do not nee d to be reported in 
expedited fashion

7.5.3.4 Non-serious adverse events
With the exception of the events of special interest defined in Section 7.5.3.3 , AEs which are 
not serious but which lead to permanent discontinuation of study  medication will be captured 
in the CRF but do not require expedited reporting.  
Non-serious AEs which do not lead to discontinuation of study  medication will not be 
collected.
7.5.3.5 Pregnancies -amended
The investigator must report to the sponsor an y pregnancy occurring in a study  subject, or in 
the study  subject’s partner, during the subject’s participation in this study .  The report should 
be submitted within the same timelines as an SAE, although a pregnancy  per se is not 
considered an SAE.For a stud y subject, the outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up carefull y, and an y 
outcome of the mother or the child should be reported. Abnormal  pregnancy outcomes (eg, 
spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, and congenital anomaly ) are considered serious adverse 
events and must be reported using the Serious Adverse Event Form.
132  For the pregnancy  of a 
study  subject’s partner, all efforts should be made to obtain similar information on course and 
outcome, subject to the partner’s consent.
For all pregnancy  reports, the forms provided by   are to be used.133

7.5.3.5132(protocol -specific adverse event reporting) are to be recorded on the appropria te 
SAE CRF page and are to be forwarded to  within 24 hours of the investigator having 
been made aware of the event. Inthis trial, exempted outcomes are to be recorded on the 
appropriate outcome CRF page, not the SAE CRF page.132  Upon receipt of an SAE CRF 
page132this form will be rep orted to Bay er Global Phar macovigilance b y  within 
24hours, or 3 calendar day s for weekends or public holiday s, or next working day  whichever 
is earlier. 
All required information will be listed on the SAE page in the CRF.  If the required 
information is not immediately  available,  will query  the center to obtain the information 
once it becomes available.  In the rare circumstances that additional information is needed, 
 will work with Bay er and the site investigators to obtain additional infor mation in a 
timely  manner to enable Bay er to compl y with regulatory authorities’ reporting requirements. 
7.6 Other procedures and variables
No other procedures will be conducted and no other variables will be explored in this trial.

7.7 Appropriateness of procedures / measurements
With the exception of routine laboratory  assessments performed at screening, imaging studies 
performed in subjects randomized post CABG, and blood and imaging studies in those 
participating in the COMPASS MIND substudy , no invasive proce dures are planned for this 
study .  All study  visits will be used to collect safety  and outcome data, which are appropriate 
measures for this events -driven trial.  
8. Statistical methods and determination of sample size
8.1 General considerations
General description of the statistical methods is outlined below. A more detailed statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be provided in a separate document.
The core SAP document will provide a more technical and detailed elaboration of the principal features of the planned analyses, e.g. censoring schemes for time -to-event variables. 
The core SAP will be finalized ideally  prior to study  enrollment, at the latest before an y 
substantial information in the trial has accumulated.
Amendments and/or appendices to the core SAP wil l provide more details on the coding 
guidelines, data -handling, and output tables and figures. These SAP associated documents 
will be finalized ideally  6 months before planned study  end to take into account emerging data 
external to the trial becoming avai lable during conduct of the trial that could influence study  
interpretation. All SAP associated documents will be finalized without knowledge of an y 
emerging results from the trial.Analy ses will be performed using SAS software (SAS I nstitute Inc, Cary , NC , USA).

Each of the rivaroxaban -based treatment groups will first be compared to the common aspirin 
control group on the primary  efficacy  outcome, followed by  the same comparisons on the 
three ordered secondary  efficacy  outcomes.  Figure 8–1 illustrates the hy pothesis testing 
problem with ordered h ypotheses. The null hypotheses of no effect corresponding to different 
efficacy  outcomes will be grouped into four separate families. Standard logical restrictions 
will be imposed, i.e., the null hypotheses will be split into two branches corresponding to the 
tests for rivaroxaban 2.5 mg plus aspirin (h ypotheses H 1A, H2A, H3A, H4A) and to the tests for 
rivaroxaban 5.0 mg (h ypotheses H 1B, H2B, H3B, H4B).  A null hy pothesis within each branch 
can be tested if and onl y if the immediately  preceding null hy pothesis is rejected, e.g., 
hypothesis H 2A, is “testable” if and onl y if h ypothesis H 1Ais rejected. In Figure 8–1, these 
logical restrictions are represented b y arrows.
Figure 8–1: Hypothesis testing problem
Multiple hy potheses testing will be performed according to a mixture gatekeeping procedure 
based on the Hochberg test with a truncation fraction of γ= 0.9, which controls the 
family wise error rate at the pre -assigned level of significance α= 5% in the strong sense.  The 
Hochberg- based gatekeeping procedure based on an extension of the general mixture 
methodology  developed in Dmitrienko and Tamhane ( 33,34) was recentl y proposed in 
Brechenmacher et al . (32)  Details for the setting of this study  will be described in the SAP.  
8.4.1 Analysis of the primary efficacy outcome - amended
Analy sis of the primary  efficacy  outcome will be based on the intention -to-treat principle 
(Section 8.2).  Two comparisons will be performed to compare each of the rivaroxaban- based 
treatment groups to the common aspirin control group to evaluate:
Superiority  of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 100 mg od over 
rivaroxaban placebo + aspirin 100 mg od (control)

Superiority  of rivaroxaban 5 mg bid + asp irin placebo over 
rivaroxaban placebo + aspirin 100 mg od (control).
Each of the primary  null hy potheses H 0;riva2.5 and H 0;riva5 stating that “there is no difference 
between the considered rivaroxaban-based treatment group and the aspirin control group in
the probability  of the primary  efficacy  outcome for all time points” will be tested against the 
respective alternative h ypotheses H 1;riva2.5 and H 1;riva5 stating that “there is a difference 
between the two groups in the probability  of the primary  efficacy outcome for at least one 
time point”.
The 2 comparisons will be performed using 2 separate stratified log -rank tests. Following the 
mixture gatekeeping procedure as mentioned in Section 8.4, a truncated Hochberg test with 
the pre -specified truncation parameter γ = 0.9 at =0.05 will be used. Further details will be 
described in the SAP.  P PIuse (3 strata levels: not randomized to a PPI ; pantoprazole 40 mg 
od; pantoprazole placebo) will be used as a stratification factor.  Study  center will not be used 
as a stratification factor.  There will be no formal comparison between the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg 
bid + aspirin 100 mg od and rivaro xaban 5 mg bid + aspirin placebo groups.141
Kaplan -Meier estimates of cumulative risk and cumulative hazard functions will be provided 
to evaluate the timing of event occurrence in the 3 antithrombotic study  groups and the 
consistency  of the respective treatment effects for all time points (the two survival curves in 
each comparison do not cross). Hazard ratio, relative risk reduction, and corresponding 2- sided 95% confidence intervals will 
be estimated based on 2 separate stratified Cox proportional hazards models. Censoring will 
be assumed independent of the randomized group assignment. The plausibility  of the 
proportional hazards assumption will be assessed by visuall y examining both the plot of the 
log of the negative log of Kaplan -Meier estimates of the survival function versus the log of 
time for evidence of non -parallelism and the smoothed plot of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals 
to directly  visualize the log hazard ratio, (33)and by  including a time -treatment interaction 
term in the Cox model (time log transformed).  The significance of the interaction will be 
tested at the 5% t ype I error level. If the interaction is significant and there is stron g evidence 
of non- proportionalit y from the plots, time -dependent hazard ratios will be estimated with the 
model that includes the interaction term.  Further details will be specified in SAP.
The trial success will be determined based on the totality  of evi dence for significance, 
magnitude, and direction of treatment effect from the anal ysis of primary  and secondary  
efficacy  outcomes. 
142
Analy sis of the joint effect and/or interaction between rivaroxaban- based anti- thrombotic 
therap y and PPIuse on the primary  efficacy  outcome will be performed as described in 
Section 8.4.5.  Further details of this analy sis will be specified in SAP.

Analy sis of the secondary  efficacy  outcomes will be based on the intention -to-treat principle 
(Section 8.2) and will use a similar approach as described in Section 8.4.1. The famil y-wise 
error rate will be controlled using the truncated and/or regular Hochberg tests as described in

MoCA, DSS, and EQ5D).  Analy sis of subject reported SAGE, MoCA, DSS, and EQ5D will 
be described in the SAP. Both comparison s of the rivaroxaban- based treatment groups to the 
common aspirin control group will be performed at the 2- sided 5% t ype I error level.  
Additional exploratory  analy ses will be conducted, as described in the SAP.
The MRU data will be incorporated into econ omic modeling, which will be performed and 
reported separatel y from this study . 
8.4.4 Analysis of the primary safety outcome
The principal anal ysis of the primary  safet y outcome will be based on the intention -to-treat 
principle (Section 8.2). The anal ysis will follow similar methodology  as the anal ysis of the 
primary  efficacy  outcome described in Section 8.4.1.
In addition, the primary  safet y outcome will be analy zed based on the other data scopes 
defined in Section 8.2.2.  
8.4.5 Analysis of the outcome for pantoprazole randomization -amended
Analy sis of the outcome for pantoprazole randomization will be based on the intention -to-
treat principle (Section 8.2) and will include all subjects randomized to receive pantoprazole 
40mg od or pantoprazole placebo.
Pantoprazole 40 mg od treatment group and pantoprazole placebo control group will be 
compared. The null hy pothesis H 0;panto40 stating that “there is no difference between the 
pantoprazole treatment and control groups in the probability  of the outcome144for 
pantoprazole randomization for all time points” will be tested against the alternative hypothesis H
1;panto40 stating that “there is a difference between the two groups in the 
probability  of the outcome144for at least one time point”.
The comparison will be performed using a log- rank test stratified by  antithrombotic therapy  
study  group (3 strata levels: rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 100 mgod; rivaroxaban 5 mg 
bid + aspirin placebo ; rivaroxaban placebo + aspirin 100 mg od), conducted at the 2 -sided 5% 
type I error level. There will be no interim analy ses for the pantoprazole randomization.
Kaplan -Meier estimates of cumulative risk and cumulative hazard functions will be provided 
to evaluate the timing of event occurrence in the 2 PPIstudy  groups and the consistency  of the 
treatment effect for all time points (the 2 survival curves do not cross).

Hazard ratio, relative risk reduction, and co rresponding 2- sided 95% confidence intervals will 
be estimated based on a Cox proportional hazards model stratified by  antithrombotic therapy  
study  group.  Censoring will be assumed independent of the treatment group assignment. 
Similar strategies to those outlined in Section 8.4.1 will be used for assessing the plausibility  
of the proportional hazards assumption.
In addition, joint effect and interac tion between the antithrombotic and pantoprazole study  
groups will be explored based on the intention- to-treat principle in subjects randomized to 
receive pantoprazole 40 mg od or pantoprazole placebo.  The anal ysis will use 2 separate Cox 
proportional haz ards models, one for the comparison of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 
100mg od vs. rivaroxaban placebo + aspirin 100 mg od, and one for the comparison of 
rivaroxaban 5 mg bid + aspirin placebo vs. rivaroxaban placebo + aspirin 100 mg od.  The 
models wil l include:
a covariate for the effect of the considered rivaroxaban -based treatment group vs. the 
aspirin control group,
a covariate for the effect of pantoprazole 40 mg od treatment group vs. pantoprazole 
placebo control group,
an interaction term of these 2 factors.
If the interaction term is significant at the 5% t ype I  error level, then the interaction ratio test
(36)will be performed to assess sy nergy  and sub -additivity  of the two treatment effects.  
Additional exploratory  analy ses, e.g. a comparison of subjects who used PPI at baseline (and 
therefore were not randomized to receive pantoprazole 40 mg od or pantoprazole placebo) 
with subjects randomized to pantoprazole placebo group, will be conducted as described in 
the SAP.
8.4.6 Subgroup analyses -amended
Subgroup anal yses for the primary  efficacy  and safety  outcomes, and the outcome145for 
pantoprazole randomization will be performed based on the same anal ysis sets and data 
scopes as in the main analy ses of the study  outcomes (Sections 8.4.1, 8.4.2, 8.4.3, 8.4.4, and 
8.4.5). Homogeneity  of treatment eff ect in subgroups, both in magnitude and direction, will be 
assessed b y adding a covariate for the subgroup variable (Section 8.3.6) and the correspo nding 
treatment -subgroup interaction to the respective stratified Cox proportional hazards model 
used in the main anal ysis.  Cox proportional hazards regression model (not stratified) will be 
used for baseline PPIuse (y es, no) variable.
As the number of s ubgroup anal yses may  be large, the probability  of observing at least one 
statistically  significant but spurious interaction is high despite the lack of a biological or 
pharmacological basis for expecting an interaction.  Thus any  significant interactions in the 
analysis of primary  outcomes will be interpreted as “flags” to prompt further investigation.

significant at the 5% t ype I  error level in the anal ysis of the primary  efficacy  outcome, 
secondary  and tertiary  efficacy  outcomes will be investigated to evaluate the plausibility  of 
such an effect.  Furthermore, in the anal ysis of all outcomes if the interaction term is 
significant at the 5% t ype I  error level the li kelihood ratio test proposed by  Gail and 
Simon (37)will be performed to test the hy pothesis that there is no crossover or qualitative 
interaction at the 1% t ype I error level (H 0: The direction of treatment effect is the same for all 
levels of a subgroup variable vs. H 1:  The direction of treatment effect is different for at least 
one level of a subgroup variable).  As was shown by  Li et al (2007),( 38)the probability  of 
observing the treatment effect in the opposite direction to the true overall treatment effect for 
at least one subgroup level is not negligible. The contributing factors may  be small subgroup 
sizes, imbalance of randomized groups within the subgroups, and small true overall treatment effect.( 38)
Following the test of interaction, hazard ratio and relative risk red uction for the treatment 
effect will be estimated separately  within each level of a subgroup variable using the stratified 
Cox proportional hazards models that were used in the main anal yses of study  outcomes.
8.4.7 Handling of missing data
All efforts will be made to collect complete data for all subjects randomized in this study .  
Subjects will be followed to the study  end and will complete all required data collection, 
regardless of their compliance with study  medications or visits. 
When an event date is not known, the site investigator will be asked to provide a best estimate 
as to when the event occurred.  Even though the exact date of an event is unknown, the investigator often does know some information that would indicate the approximate date, such as the first week of a month, in the fall of a year, or the middle of a particular y ear, or at least 
the date when the subject was last seen or contacted.  This information can be meaningfull y 
incorporated into the estimated date recorded, as this is likely  to be closer to the true date than 
any produced by  an uninformed computer program.  This estimated date should be the middle 
date within the period that the event is known to have occurred.  If the event is known to have occurred in the first week of a month, then the date in the middle of that week should be recorded as the estimate.  If it occurred in the fall of a y ear, then the middle date in the fall is 
the appropriate estimate.  If no information is known then the date in the middle of the plausible time period should be given, based on the last contact with the subject prior to the 
event and the date of contact when information about the event was known.  This method for date estimation has been used in many  studies and is recommended b y Dubois and Hebert
(2001). (39)

8.5 Planned interim analyses - amended
Interim assessments and study  monitoring for efficacy and safety  will be done by  an 
independent DSMB, which will review unblinded event rates. An independent statistician 
within , who is not involved with any  study  conduct, will perform interim data analy ses 
to support the DSMB.
Two formal interim analys es are planned when 50% and 75% of the expected number of 
accumulated primary  efficacy  outcome events accrue. 
If the interim anal yses show clear and consistent benefit in both treatment arms, the DSMB 
may recommend earl y study  termination.  The Hay bittle -Peto rule will be used to guide the 
decision regarding early  stopping:  a reduction of 4 standard deviations in the anal ysis of the 
primary  efficacy  outcome at the first interim analysis or 3 standard deviations at the second 
interim analy sis.  If the moni toring boundary  is crossed at either of the 2 interim anal yses, a 
second look will be done after at least 4 -6 months to confirm the boundary  remains crossed 
and that the trend in treatment effect is not temporary .
For a lack of efficacy , a futility  approac h will be utilized at the time of planned interim 
analysis. If the conditional probability of rejecting the null hy pothesis for either primary  
comparisons, given current trends, falls to an unacceptabl y low level (i.e. <5%), the DSMB 
may consider recommend ing earl y termination of the study.
Given these conservative monitoring boundaries and only  2 interim anal yses, the ty pe I error 
level adjustment for the final anal ysis will be negligible.  If the results are clear with one 
intervention, but not for the se cond intervention, the DSMB may decide to continue 
evaluation of both or one rivaroxaban treatment arms.  I f the study  is continued with both 
interventions, then the type I error levels specified in Section 8.4.1 will be used in the final 
analysis; if the decision is made to continue with only  one intervention, the final comparison 
will be made as follows: 147
If one intervention was stopped earl y for efficacy , the multiple testing procedure for 
the final anal ysis will be performed as described in Section 8.4with the assumption 
that the p -value fo r the primary  efficacy  outcome of the arm that was stopped earl y for 
overwhelming efficacy  is smaller than 0.025. For secondary  outcomes, the p -values 
will be obtained from log-rank tests based on all available data for the stopped arm 
(data from confirmat ion anal ysis 6 months after respective interim look) and the 
complete data from the comparator arm.
If one intervention was stopped earl y for futility , the final anal ysis will be performed 
when at least 1,513148subjects in the 2 remaining arms have experie nced an event.
                                                
147The details in the bulleted paragraphs were added as per Amendment 8.  (See Section 13.2.2 )
148The whole study was planned to be stopped when at least 2,200 subjects had experienced a primary outcome 
event. Under the planning assumptions that both alternative hypotheses are true, observed randomization times 
and estimated overall incidence rates based on preliminary data, and projected study duration after sample size 
increase, it is expected that 826 subjects in the control arm and each 687 subjects in the rivaroxaban intervention 
arms will experience a primary outcome event. Dropping one intervent ion arm  early but still expecting that for 
the other comparison the alternative hypothesis holds true, the study needs to be continued until at least 826 + 687 = 1,513 subjects in the remaining arms have experienced a primary event.

The final analy sis will be performed according to the multiple testing strategy  as 
described in Section 8.4. P- values for the primar y and secondary  hypotheses for the 
intervention stopped early will be obtained from the log- rank tests based on all 
available data for the stopped arm and the complete data from the comparator arm. It 
can be assumed that for the stopped intervention the co rresponding p-value of the 
primary  efficacy  outcome will be greater than 0.05. Thus, for the intervention stopped 
early for futility  the primary  and none of the secondary  outcomes can achieve 
statistical significance at the overall t ype I error level of 5% .
The Steering C ommittee will review overall blinded event rates to ensure that they  meet 
protocol projections.  If overall event rates are lower than expected, consideration will be given to increasing the sample size or extending the study  duration without knowledge of any  
treatment effect.  The trial will aim to enroll about one -quarter
149subjects with PAD ; this will 
be monitored during the trial and steps may  be taken to adjust the proportion during the trial.
8.6 Determination of sample size -amended
150In this trial, it is planned to randomize at least 2 7,400 subjects and to continue the study  
until a minimum of 2,200 subjects experience an event for the primary  efficacy  outcome.
The aim is to achieve at least 90% power to detect a 20% relative risk red uction (RRR) for 
each of the 2 rivaroxaban -based treatment groups vs. the common aspirin control group.  The 
total number of events needed is shown in Table 8–1for different scenarios depending on the 
assumed annual incidence rate for the primary  outcome in the aspirin group based on the 
assumptions modified according to Amendment 6 (integrated protocol Version 2.0), dated 03JUL 2014.  Due to the event- driven stud y design, the number of randomized subjects, 
length of enrollment and total study  duration may  vary .  If recruitment is going extremel y 
well, a larger number of subjects may  be recruited.  All numbers below refer to the minimum 
number of event s to be observed after successful completion of the run -in period.  For the 
total number of subjects to be enrolled in the run -in period, at least 10% must be added to the 
total number below.
Original a ssumptions for antithrombotic treatment randomization were:
3-arm stud y with 1:1:1 randomization
In total, a minimum of 21,400 subjects are randomized ( approximately  7,134 subjects 
per treatment group) according to a 1:2:3:4:4 pattern within 2.5 y ears
2-sided ty pe I error level of 2.7% for each of the two comparisons to control the 
overall ty pe I error level of 5%
Constant annual incidence rate in aspirin control group between 3.0% and 4.0%
Effect size: 20% relative risk reduction to be detected for each comparison
                                                
149Prior to Amendment 8, this was one -third subjects w ith PAD.

Intention- to-treat anal ysis: all subjects randomized are included in the analysis as 
randomized and the follow -up period for each subject is as long as possible from 
randomization until the date of the Final Follow -up Visit for each subject
Length of recruitment period about 2.5 y ears 
Early disco ntinuation of study  drug: about 6% and 4% in the 1st and 2nd 6 -month 
periods, and 3% in the 6 -month periods thereafter
The expected total number of observed events and the estimated power for each of the two 
comparisons are display ed in Table 8–1.

Based on these estimates and the aim to detect a true relative risk reduction of 20% in each of the rivaroxaban arms with at least 90% power, it was planned to randomize at least 21,400 
subjects and to continue the study  until a minimum of 2,200 subjects e xperience an event for 
the primary  efficacy  outcome.  I n this multi -center study , each center is expected to 
randomize at least 50 subjects.
The originally planned sample size of 21,400 and 5 y ear study  duration was based on an 
annual primary  incidence rate in the control group of 3.5% and 90% power to detect a relative 
risk reduction of 20% in each of the rivaroxaban arms. Based on an observed incidence rate of 
2.9% as of July 2015, it is now planned to randomize at least 27,400
151subjects. This new 
sample size will maintain current stud y timelines and 90% power to detect a 20% relative risk 
reduction in each of the rivaroxaban arms, based on the following revisions to the original assumptions:  
Overall length of recruitment period about 3 to 3.5 y ears and taking observed 
randomization times up to July  2015 into account
2-sided overall t ype I error level of 5% using a truncated Hochberg test (γ = 0.9) for 
the testing of the two primary  hypotheses
Constant overall incidence rate of about 2.9% per y ear, resulting in a constant 
incidence rate of about 3.3% per year for the aspirin control group assuming a 20% 
relative risk reduction for both hy potheses
Censoring due to non -CV death at an event rate of almost 1% per year

Assumptions for pantoprazole randomization are: 
Annual incidence rate for major upper gastrointestinal complications (overt or occult 
bleeding, s ymptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers or erosions, obstruction or perforation) 
in the range of 1.6% to 2.2%
At least 16,440 subjects included in the study  are not PPIusers and they  are 
randomized to pantoprazole treatment and control groups in 1:1 ratio
2-sided ty pe I error level of 5%
Effect size: 50% relative risk reduction to be detected
Intention- to-treat anal ysis: all su bjects randomized are included in the analysis as 
randomized and the follow -up period for each subject is as long as possible from 
randomization until the date of the Final Follow -up Visit for each subject
Under these assumptions, the expected total number of major upper gastrointestinal 
complications is between 570 and 780, depending on the observed event rates and the total 
study  duration. The estimated power for the detection of the true relative risk reduction of 
about 50% for major upper gastrointestin al complications for pantoprazole 40 mg od vs. 
pantoprazole placebo is close to 100% for all scenarios considered.
Sample size estimation was based on the method by Lakatos (40)implemented in P ower 
Analy sis and Sample Size (PASS) software, version 11.0.7, and on a Statistical Anal ysis 
System (SAS)macro provided by  J. Shih (1995).( 41)  In addition, simulations were 
performed to confirm that the mixture gatekeeping procedure as described in Section 8.4for 
the anal ysis of the primary efficacy  outcome keeps the overall t ype I error level of 5%.  SAS 
calculations and simulations were performed using SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS I nstitute 
Inc, Cary , NC, USA).

13. Protocol amendments
Protocol version history
Original Protocol Version 1.0 – Approved 19 OCT 2012
Revised Protocol Version 1.1 – Approved 28 NOV 2012
The revised protocol contains some additional clarifications on data collection. The changes to 
the protocol are not substantial and do not affect the study  design, but must be done for 
consistency  with the CRFs.
The word “primary ” has been removed when linked to the outcome for the pantoprazole 
randomization, and similarly  a paragraph describing the “primary ” outcome for the 
pantoprazole randomization has been removed from the protocol sections where t hey are not 
applicable. Rationale and implications: Although the outcome of the composite of GI bleeding is the “primary ” objective of the pantoprazole randomization, it is not part of the primary  
objective of the trial and, thus, not a primary  variable of the trial. Therefore, the word 
“primary ” has been removed. The intent and the analy sis plan remains the same.
A consistent use of the terms “outcome” and “variable” has been ensured. While the term “outcome” is used to describe a clinical event to be observed in the trial, e.g. stroke, the term “variable” refers to the statistical variable to be analy zed, e.g. the time to the first occurrence 
of the outcome since randomization. The wording in section 4.2 has been adapted to consistently  reflect this throughout the protocol.
The timing of the stud y questionnaires have been further clarified in respective protocol 
sections. Collection of two additional questionnaires (health care costs information and assessment of the driving status) and additional informat ion relative to the CABG surgery  for 
subjects randomized post CABG surgery  (EuroSCORE) have been added to the respective 
study  visit section.  Collection of two questionnaires (Diet and Activity ) has been removed 
from the Final Follow -up Visit. Collection of blood sampling relevant for COMPASS MIND 
study  has been included in the relevant study  visit section.
13.1 Amendment 6
The eligibility  criteria for study  population of subjects with coronary  artery  disease (CAD) 
and peripheral artery  disease (PAD) have been simplified and clarified.  Despite the improved 
language and adjustment of the criteria, the target population remains largely unchanged. Additionally , there is an increase in the overall sample size of the study  by 1900, from 19,500 
to 21,400 randomized subjects, of which 900 will be enrolled in Japan.
There are otherwise other minor changes, and logistical improvements or clarifications 
throughout the protocol.
13.1.1 Overview changes to the study
The following changes are made to Original Protocol Version 1.1. 
Administrative, editorial and typographical corrections were made throughout the document including Table 7 -1 and the list of abbreviations. These changes do not affect the overall study  
concept.

Modification 1: Name of the sponsor clinical leader has bee n updated.
Rationale:  replaces  as the sponsor’s  
for the COMPASS study .
Sections affected:
Title page
Signature of the sponsor’s medically  responsible person
Modification 2: Minor clarifications for the s econdary  and  tertiary  efficacy  outcomes
Rationale: The following sections now contain minor clarifications to address either the terms 
that were omitted  in the previous protocol or to reflect the changes in the associated sections of this protocol amendment. These clarifications are as follows:  1) addition of revascularization to the secondary  composite outcomes, and 2) addition of the stent 
thrombosis and coronary  artery  bypass graft failure to the tertiary  outcomes. These additions 
do not affect the analysis of the corresponding statistical variables.
Sections affected:
Synopsis: Study  objectives
Section 2: Study  objectives
Section 7.3 Efficacy  
Section 7.5.3.1 Protocol-specific exceptions to SAE reporting (new section)
Section 8.3.2 Secondary  efficacy outcomes
Section 8.3.3 Tertiary  and other efficacy  outcomes
Modification 3: Clarifications in the main criteria for inclusion
Rationale: Originally , the protocol mandated that subjects with PAD under the age of 65 have 
documented atherosclerosis in at lea st two vascular beds or at least two additional 
cardiovascular risk factors.  This requirement was based on the general observation that cardiovascular risk is closely  correlated with increasing age.  Thus, subjects under the age of 
65 with either coronary or peripheral artery  disease would have a substantially  lower rate of 
cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, or stroke than those over the age of 65.  
However, further scrutiny  of the recent data from the On-Target (1) and Transcend (2) trials 
demonstrated that event rates in subjects under the age of 65 with PAD are about 50% higher 
than those with CAD and are well over 4%. This observation prompted the removal of the requirement for two additional risk factors or disease in at least two vascular b eds for PAD 
subjects under the age of 65; such subjects are at high risk even without additional risk factors and will potentially  benefit from a more effective rivaroxaban- based treatment. 
Based on the questions received from the sites, it became evident that additional clarifications 
regarding definition of vascular beds were required. The definition is now specified in the protocol amendment.

Modification 5: Clarification about the subjects with the need for the proton pump inhibitor 
(PPI) treatment
Rationale: The initial protocol required that the subjects with a need for PPIshould not be 
randomized to the PPI . The clarification in this protocol amendment specifies that the need for 
the PPI  refers to subjects who have a continuous need for  treatment with the PPI .

Modification 6: The number of subjects in the trial has been increased.
Rationale: The number of subjects in the trial has been incre ased to: ~23,500 enrolled and 
~21,400 randomized (10% non- compliance rate is anticipated the run -in period). The reason 
for increasing the number of subjects is based on emerging data from the ORI GIN trial (1) 
and the Vorapaxar secondary  prevention trial (2), a realistic event rate is 3.5- 4% rather than 4 -
4.5% which mandates an increase in numbers of subjects or duration of follow up to maintain 
study  power.

Sections affected:
Section 2 Study  Objectives
Modification 9: Clarification on the timing of the administration of the study  related 
questionnaires.Rationale: Considering the older subjects participating in the COMPASS study , it may  be 
difficult to have all of the study  related questionnaires administered at one visit. Therefore, the 
timing of the administration of the questionnaires now allows some flexibility  to when the se 
questionnaires should be completed.Sections affected:
Section 4.1 Design overview
Section 7.1.1 tabulated overview
Modification 10: Changes in the informed consent timing for CABG subjects, and 
requirement for the angiograph y at 1 year post surgery  forCABG subjects
Rationale: CABG subjects can now sign consent for participation in the evaluation of graft 
patency  either before or after CABG surgery . Irrespective of the timing of consent, the 
decision to randomize is based on the information available to the investigator on Day  4 or 
later post -op. Surgeons will not randomize if information becomes available post -operativel y 
that the treatment is not in the subject’s best interests. Moreover, in some centers, it is not

feasible to get the consent before su rgery  because subjects are admitted the evening before 
surgery .  Thus, for some subjects, it may  be more appropriate to approach them once they  
have begun recovering from surgery  and are stable and read y to be discharged home or 
transferred to a rehabilita tion center. 
Approximately  at 1 y ear post -CABG, certain number of sites routinel y perform invasive 
coronary  angiography  rather than CT angiography; thus, the protocol amendment now allows 
the  invasive angiography as an acceptable alternative to CT angiog raphy.

Section 4.1.1 Subjects randomized after CABG surgery
Section 7.1.1 tabulated overview
Section 7.1.2.4.1 Routine follow -up visits (Visits 3, 5, and 7- 15+)
Modification 11: Clarification on the study population and the study investigators 
qualifications
Rationale: The  new paragraph in the protocol amendment summarizes that COMPASS study  
is enrolling subjects with the high risk of the incident cardiovascular disease. Additionally , 
based on the request from South American regul atory  authorit y, the investigator qualifications 
are now further clarified.Sections affected:
Section 5 Study  population
Modification 12: The section defining eligibility  criteria for subjects with coronary  artery  
disease has been modified Rationale: Fir st, only  subjects with a history  of previous my ocardial infarction (most recent 
episode) within the past 20 y ears are eligible, if no other CAD criteria are met.  The risk of 
recurrent event in a subject who has been stable without other complications for more than 20 
years is likely  to be low, diminishing their potential benefit from a new treatment. 
Second, the emphasis of this protocol with respect to coronary  artery  disease is subjects with 
multi-vessel disease.  With the increasing use of non- invasive means of screening for 
coronary  disease, the potential exists for identification of subjects with positive exercise stress 
test to have only  single vessel coronary  artery  disease. Thus, the requirement for stress studies 
has been further clarified.Furthe rmore, with respect to CABG surgery , the protocol previously  restricted this to multi -
vessel surgery  within one week or at least four years prior to randomization (unless the patient 
had recurrent ischemic events in the first four years after surgery ). The recently  completed one 
year follow -up of the CORONARY trial (1) and the five y ear follow-up of the SYNTAX trial 
(2) have shown that event rate in subjects with prior CABG surgery  is in the order of 3.5- 4% 
per year, even during the first four years after s urgery .  Thus, these subjects need to be given 
the opportunity  to participate in COMPASS, as they  are at substantial risk and could benefit 
from a new treatment that is potentially  more effective than aspirin.

Section 5 Study  population
Modification 13: Section defining the eligibility  criteria for subjec ts with peripheral artery  
disease has been modified Rationale: Asy mptomatic carotid disease carries a higher risk of MI than stroke on average 
and carotid endarterectomy  (CEA), while reducing the risk of stroke (ARR 0.6% per year) 
does not alter the cardi ac risk. So a previous endarterectom y identifies an individual with an 
increased cardiac risk. The original observation was made b y John Norris (1). Incidentall y, the 
cardiac risk correlates with degree of stenosis and a cutoff of 50% ensures selection of high 
risk asy mptomatic disease. 
Inthe NASCET Trial of surgery  for sy mptomatic carotid stenosis, the rate of MI at 5 y ears 
was ~19% (2).References:1. Chambers BR, Norris JW. Outcome in patients with asy mptomatic neck bruits. N Engl J

Sections affected:
Section 5 Study  population
Modification 14: Clarifications in the Exclusion criteria
Rationale: I n the section on drug interactions, strong inducers of cy tochrome P450 3A4 are 
now excluded. These were not previously  listed in the protocol.  
Furthermore, there is an additional clarification on women who are pregnant, breastfeeding, or 
of childbearing potential.  
Participation of subjects who concomitantly  participate in another study  with an 
investigational drug, or have contraindication to a ny study  procedure is now excluded.
Additionally , it is now clarified that the subjects who a continuous need for treatment with 
PPI should not be randomized to pantoprazole arm.

Modification 15: Clarifications in the Discontinuations of subjects from study treatment
Rationale: The protocol now clarifies that even the subjects with study  outcomes need to be 
followed at regular stud y visits until the end of the study . Furthermore, besides collection of 
survival status information throughout the stud y, the outcome information is also required in 
subjects who prematurely  terminate the study /study  treatment.
Sections affected:
Section 5.2 Discontinuation of subjects from stud y treatment
Modification 16: Clarification about the aspirin treatment
Rationale: The protocol amendment clarifies that the aspirin used in the study  is enteric 
coated. Furthermore, the clarification is now included that the terms “aspirin” and “acet yl 
salicy lic acid” are used interc hangeabl y. 
Sections affected:
Section 6.1 Treatments to be administered
Section 6.2 I dentity  of study  treatment
Modification 17:   Clarification on the treatment compliance during run -in 
Rationale: The intent of the run in is to optimize subject retention in the study . While the 80% 
drug adherence during run- in is still required in the protocol, it is recognized that they  may  be 
certain circumstances, e.g. outside of subject’s control, where the drug adherence may  be 
somewhat affected. Therefore, the targ et compliance during run -in was a mended to “at least 
80% except for extenuating circumstances”.
Sections affected:
Section 6.1.2 Randomization
Section 7.1.2.3 Randomization visit (Day  0 ± 5 day s)
Modification 18: Change in the section on treatment guidance with study  pantoprazole
Rationale: Compared to the initial protocol, the summary  of the treatment guidance with study  
pantoprazole is now found only  in one section. This was done to further simplify  the protocol. 
Sections affected:
Section 6.4.2 Dose modi fications and treatment guidance

Section 6.9.4 Proton pump inhibitor treatment
Modification 19: Combined CYP 3A4 and p- Glycoprotein Inhibitors and systemic azole 
antimy cotics
Rationale: The title of the relevant protocol sections has been updated to include CYP 3A4 
inducers. Also, the concomitant use of stron g CYP 3A4 inducers has now been included in the 
protocol due to the potential for reduction in the rivaroxaban plasma concentrations if used 
concomitantly . Additionally , macrolide antibiotics are now removed: if used concomitantly  
with rivaroxaban, their e ffect on mean rivaroxaban AUC and Cmax is considered to be 
clinically  not relevant (see rivaroxaban IB and Company  Core Data sheet). Furthermore, the 
list of sy stemic antifungal drug provides some examples of the sy stemic antimy cotics that 
should not be ta ken concomitantly  with rivaroxaban.  
Sections affected:
Section 6.9.1 Combined CYP 3A4 and p- glycoprotein inhibitors
Modification 20: Revision of time windows and footnotes under section Tabulated overview
Rationale: Compared to previous protocol, the foo tnotes under section 7.1.1 Tabulated 
overview are now revised to reflect the changes in the related protocol sections. Specifically , 
this section now clarifies the timing of the clinic visits, especially  under unforeseen 
circumstances when the visit time w indow may  be missed.  Similarly , the timing for 
administration of the questionnaires and DNA and blood collection has been further clarified. 
With this protocol amendment, the target is still to include subjects in the first week following CABG surgery  (4-7 day s), but randomization is allowed up to Day  14 post -CABG for medical 
or logistical reasons.
Sections affected:
Section 7.1.1 Tabulated overview
Modification 21: Minor clarifications in timing of the visit assessments
Rationale: These protocol sections now contain minor editorial revisions/updates: A 
specification about the administration of the questionnaires for post -CABG subjects has now 
been included, as well as the allowance for the use of invasive or noninvasive coronary  
angiograph y for post -CABG s ubjects. Furthermore, these sections now include the 
specification on the timing of blood collection. Namely, at the start of the run-in period, blood 
samples (for creatinine and cholesterol) up to 1 year old are acceptable to determine the 
subject’s preli minary  eligibility . However, at randomization the blood samples should not be 
older than 3 months.

Rationale: The paragraph on hospitalization data has been moved from the safet y section to 
efficacy  section. 
Sections affected:
Section 7.3 Efficacy
Section 7.5.3.1 Protocol- specific exceptions to SAE reporting
Modification 23: Changes in the safet y section 
Rationale: Due to errors in reporting of the study outcomes as e.g. SAEs, the whole safet y 
section has been revised to clarify  the requirements for the safet y reporting. Namel y, few new 
sections were included to specify  1) the categorization of the AEs, 2) to help with 
determination of the casual relationship between the study  drug and events, and 3) further 
outline which events are considered as outcomes and should be rep orted as such.  
Additionally , few sections have been placed in different order to help clarify  the AE reporting 
requirements. Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) section is now removed, since the 
details on the DSMB procedures are specified in the respecti ve DSMB charter. Section on 
pregnancy  contains requirement(s) for the reporting of the abnormal pregnancies.
Sections affected:
Section 7.5.1 Definition of (Serious) Adverse Event

This Phase 3, event- driven (at least 2,200 primary  efficacy  outcome events), randomized 
controlled trial will have a 3 x 2 partial factorial design and will randomize at least 19,500
subjects who will receive treatment for an expected average duration of 3 to 4 y ears.  The 
COMPASS trial will involve 4 periods:  screening, run -in, follow -up, and washout. 
Prescreening procedures may require informed consent in some countries.  In all other study  
sites, informed consent will be obtained prior to the ini tiation of any  screening procedures.  
Screening will be performed to determine subject eligibility  and will include the review of 
inclusion and exclusion criteria, the collection of medical history , phy sical measurements, and
laboratory  evaluations.  
The run -in period will occur during the 30 days prior to initiation of randomized study  
treatment, with the exception of subjects who are randomized after CABG surgery , who will 
not undergo a run -in phase (Section 4.1.1).  During run -in, subjects will disconti nue an y 
non-study  anticoagulant and non -study  aspirin therapy  and will begin study rivaroxaban 
placebo and stud y aspirin 100 mg.  
Subjects who successfully  complete the run -in period and who remain committed to the study  
as well as those who are being randomized after CABG will be randomized and begin study  
treatments on Day  0, which will also signal the initiation of the follow -up period.  Subjects 
without an ongoing need for treatment with a PPIwill be randomized 1:1 to the pantoprazole 
or pantoprazole placebo and all subjects (including those subjects who entered the study  while 
alread y receiving a PPI) will then be randomized 1:1:1 to rivaroxaban alone, the combination

controlled trial will have a 3 x 2 partial factorial design and will r andomize at least 21,400
subjects who will receive treatment for an expected average duration of 3 to 4 y ears.  The 
COMPASS trial will involve 4 periods:  screening, run -in, follow -up, and washout. 
Prescreening procedures may  require informed consent in some countries.  In all other study  
sites, informed consent will be obtained prior to the initiation of any  screening procedures
(Section 7.1.2.1) .  Screening will be performed to determine subject eligibility  and will 
include the review of inclusion and ex clusion criteria, physical measurements, laboratory  
evaluations, etc. (Section 7.1.2.2) .  
The run -in period will occur during the 28 days prior to initiation of randomized study  
treatment, with the exception of subjects who are randomized after CABG surge ry, who will 
not undergo a run -in phase (Section 4.1.1).  During run -in, subjects will discontinue any  
antithrombotic therap y and will begin study rivaroxaban placebo and study aspirin 100 mg.  
Subjects who successfully  complete the run -in period and who remain committed to the study  
as well as those who are being randomized after CABG will be randomized and begin study  
treatments on Day  0, which will also signal the initiation of the follow -up period.  Subjects 
without a continuous need for treatment with a PPIwill be randomized 1:1 to the pantoprazole 
or pantoprazole placebo and all subjects (including those subjects who entered the study  while 
alread y receiving a PPI) will then be randomized 1:1:1 to rivaroxaban alone, the combination 
of rivaroxaban and aspirin or aspirin alone, and their matching placebos as shown in Table 4 -

This section was chang ed as a result of Modification 4 and 10. 
Old Text:Subjects randomized after CABG surgery  will undergo the same screening, follow -up and 
washout periods as other COMPASS trial subjects but will not undergo a run-in period.  The 
majority  of these subjects are expected to undergo screening during the 2- 3 weeks before 
surgery .  Subjects randomized post CABG will sign consent prior to surgery  and those who 
survive and remain eligible will undergo randomization between Day s 4-7 after surgery , at 
least 24 hours following the removal of chest tubes and at least 12 hours after last 
administration of any  anticoagulant (including DVT prophy laxis). 
Subjects randomiz ed after CABG surgery  will undergo computed tomography  (CT) 
angiograph y at 1 year as part of the stud y protocol unless they have a specific contraindication 
for CT angiograph y (e.g., contrast allergy , estimated glomerular filtration rate <30 ml/min).

Old Text:The benefit of increasing the intensity  of antithrombotic therapy  for the prevention of 
recurrent thrombotic cardiovascular events by adding a second agent to aspirin has been 
established in trials of dual antiplatelet therap y after an acute coronary  syndrome when 
compared with aspirin alone.  
…To date, no trials have directl y compared a new anticoagulant with aspirin for long -term 
secondary  prevention of cardiovascular disease.  Prior efforts to identify  more effective 
antithrombotic treatments than aspi rin have focused on new antiplatelet therapies (terutroban, 
a platelet thromboxane receptor antagonist; clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor, adenosine 
diphosphate (ADP) receptor antagonists; and vorapaxar, a PAR- 1 receptor antagonist) and 
warfarin.

Section 5 Study population
This section was changed as a result of Modification s 4, 6, 11, 12 and 13. 
Old Text:Approximately  19,500 eligible subjects will be admitted to the run- in period and an additional 
2000 will be enrolled post CABG and without run- in.  Approximately  10% of run -insubjects 
are expected to either be non- compliant with treatment or to decline further interest in 
participating; thus, the study  will randomize approximately  19,500 men and women with 
objectively  confirmed CAD or PAD from 25 to 30 countries worldwide.
Forthe purposes of this trial, the definition of CAD is:
PPD
Integrated Clinic al Study Protocol
BAY 59 -7939/15786
12 SEPT 2017 Version 4.0 Page: 113of 205
Previous myocardial infarction, or
Stable angina or unstable angina with documented multi -vessel CAD, > 50% stenosis 
in at least 2 major coronary  arteries on coronary  angiography , or positive stress test 
(electrocardiogram (ECG) or nuclear perfusion scintogram), or
Multi- vessel percutaneous coronary  intervention (PCI ), or
Multi- vessel CABG surgery  within 1 week or at least 4 y ears ago or with recurrent 
angina or ischemia at an y time following surgery .1
1 Rationale:  The risk of thrombotic events and graft failure increases during the first year post CABG.12  Following 
a relatively stable period with low event rates between Year 1 and 4, the risk starts to rise again.28
For the purposes of this trial, th e definition of PAD is:
Previous aorto- femoral by pass surgery , limb by pass surgery  or percutaneous 
transluminal angioplast y of the iliac or infrainguinal arteries, or
Previous limb or foot amputation for arterial vascular disease (i.e., excludes trauma), 
or
History  of intermittent claudication and either an ankle/arm blood pressure (BP) ratio 
≤0.90 or significant peripheral artery stenosis ( >50%) documented b y angiography  or 
non-invasive testing by duplex ultrasound, or
Asymptomatic (i.e., no ipsilateral stroke or transient ischemic attack within 6 months) 
carotid artery  stenosis > 50% as diagnosed by  duplex ultrasound or angiography .

investigator becoming aware of the event/diagn osis Bayer HealthCare Global 
Pharmacovigilance is responsible for reporting these events to the health authority :
Any non- cardiovascular death of a subject occurring after signing informed consent or 
prior to the end of monitoring for adverse events. (note: fatal bleeding events are 
primary  safety  outcomes and are exempted)
Any non-cardiovascular SAEs not listed in Section 7.5.3.1
Any non- cardiovascular AE that recurs when the subject is restarted on study  drug 
(positive re -challenge).
In addition, any AEs of particular concern to the investigator may  be recorded on the CRF to 
bring them to the attention of the sponsor.
7.5.3.3 Adverse events of special safety interest
For ongoing pharmacovigilance, the large COMPASS trial is an opportunity to identify  rare 
events in the population that may  or may  not be drug -related.  The following events have, to 
date, not been observed with increased frequency with rivaroxaban, but are considered AEs of 
special safety  interest. These events must be reported to  independent of their 
seriousness, but within the same timelines as an SAE (within 24 hours) by  reporting them on 
the SAE page of the CRF. Bayer HealthCare Global Pharmacovigilance may decide to 
upgrade the event based on the information received.

Based on these estimates and the aim to detect a true relative risk reduction of 20% in each of the rivaroxaban arms with at least 90% power, it is planned to randomize at least 19,500
subjects and to continue the study  until a minimum of 2,200 subjects ex perience an event for 
the primary  efficacy  outcome.  I n this multi -center study , each center is expected to 
randomize at least 50 subjects.
Assumptions for pantoprazole randomization are: 
Annual event rate for major upper gastrointestinal complications (overt or occult 
bleeding, s ymptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers or erosions, obstruction or perforation) 
in the range of 1.6% to 2.2%
At least 14,000 subjects included in the study  are not proton pump inhibitor users and 
they are randomized to pantoprazole trea tment and control groups in 1:1 ratio
…
Under these assumptions, the expected total number of major upper gastrointestinal complications is between 300 and 580, depending on the observed event rates and the 
total study  duration. The estimated power for the detection of the true relative risk 
reduction of about 50% for major upper gastrointestinal complications for 
pantoprazole 40 mg od vs. pantoprazole placebo is close to 100% for all scenarios 
considered.
Sample size estimation was based on the method by Lakatos implemented in Power Anal ysis 
and Sample Size (PASS) software, version 11.0.7, and on a Statistical Analy sis Software
(SAS) macro provided by J. Shih (1995).  In addition, simulations were performed to confirm 
that the Dunnett step -up testing procedure as described in Section 8.4.1 for the anal ysis of the

This section was changed as a result of Modifications 4 and 27. 
Old Text:Design: A phase II trial seeking evidence of efficacy  in which a convenience sample of 1500

undergo limited brain MRI sequences (Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery  [FLAIR]), T-1 
and T- 2 sequences at entry  and near end -study  coupled with assessment of function (SAGE), 
and cognition (MoCA, digit sy mbol substitution).  Recruitment will occur at COMPASS sites 
with access to high -quality  (>1.5Tesla) reasonably -priced MR imaging.  Images will be 
transmitted to the central MR imaging center via discs.  Two-stage central interpretation 
blinded to treatment will be carried -out, with all incid ent covert infarcts confirmed by  a 
second independent interpreter.  The  has experience with collection and anal ysis of 
brain MRI s performed in substudies of several randomized trials:  AVERROES, PURE, 
APOLLO, and (planned) TI PS 3 MIND.
Subjects will h ave DNA collected at baseline and blood collected at baseline and at the 1 
month visit.  The samples will be processed, and aliquots will be shipped for long -term 
storage in liquid nitrogen at the coordinating center in  Canada.  Blood 
samples will be processed and stored in such a way to allow future analy sis of these aliquots 
for selected biomarkers, some of which have been observed in other studies to be predictors of stroke, and others which have a plausible association with cardiovasc ular outcomes.  Detailed 
information concerning blood collection, processing, storage, and shipping is provided in the Manual of Operations.
Implications:   The COMPASS MRI  substudy  would be the first randomized trial of an 
anticoagulant to prevent covert b rain infarcts in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease. 
Evidence that rivaroxaban reduces covert stroke better than or in addition to aspirin would 
have an immense potential public health impact.  Within COMPASS trial, the MRI  substudy  
offers an opportunity  to develop evidence of rivaroxaban efficacy  for a separate clinical 
indication applicable to a burgeoning population.

13.2 Amendment 8
13.2.1 Overview changes to the study
Editorial , administrative, and ty pographical corrections were made that do not affect the 
overall study  concept.  These changes are not described in this section. 
The following changes are introduced in Protocol Version 3.0.
Modification 1: Secondary  and tertiary  efficacy  outcomes were revised.  
Rationale:  The secondary  outcomes have been modified to include 2 composites of major 
thrombotic events, including new outcome components. These new composites were chosen 
to represent outcomes deemed to be most sensitive to the experimental antithrombotic treatment under investigation.
Sections affected:
Synopsis: St udy objectives
Section 2  Study  objectives
Section 7.3 Efficacy
Section 7.5.3.1 Protocol-specific exceptions to SAE reporting
Section 8.3.2 Secondary  efficacy  outcomes
Section 8.3.3 Tertiary  and other efficacy  outcomes
Modification 2: The multiple testing strategy  was revised to ensure the control of the 
family wise t ype I error for both testing of primary  and secondary  efficacy  variables.   
Rationale:  Originally  it had been planned to use the step- up Dunnett procedure for the testing 
of the 2 primary  outc omes to control the overall t ype I error level of 5% and to test secondary 
PPD
PPD
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

outcomes at the 5% level without any  adjustment for multiplicity .  Triggered by  the FDA 
advice letter received in AUG 2014,  this decision was revised to make use of the opportunityof a potential label claim for secondary  outcomes if convincing results will be obtained.  Since 
the Dunnett step -up test is not separable, the former testing strategy  was replaced b y a mixture 
gatekeeping procedure based on the Hochberg test with a trunc ation fraction of γ = 0.9, which 
controls the familywise error rate at the pre -assigned level of significance α = 5% in the strong 
sense.
Sections affected:
Section 8.4 Statistical and anal ytical plans
Section 8.4.1 Analy sis of the primary  efficacy  outcome
Section 8.4.2 Analy sis of the secondary  efficacy  outcomes
Modification 3: I nterim anal ysisrevised.   
Rationale:  The statistical anal ysis plan for the interim analy sis was corrected according to the 
advice received b y the FDA in the letter received in A UG 2014. The description for the 
analysis in the case where only  1 of the 2 interventional arms is continued after an interim 
analysis was updated. 
Section affected:
8.5 Planned interim analy ses
Modification 4: The number of subjects in the trial has been increased.
Rationale:   During the first 2 y ears after randomization of the first subject, the observed 
cumulated overall annual incidence was at the lower end of the projected range of 3.0% to 
4.0%. This led to the decision to continue enrollment and to thereb y roughly maintain the 
study  duration in the originally  planned range of 4.5 to 5 y ears.
Sections affected:
Synopsis: Number of subjects
Section 4.1 Design overview
Section 5 Study  population
Section 8.6 Determination of sample size
Modification 5:  Emphasis was made that all subjects, including those who experience a 
primary  study  outcome, need to be followed to the scheduled end of the study .
Rationale:  Some investigators are under the impression that subjects who experience MI or 
stroke no longer need to be followed up because they  have already  contributed to the study  
outcomes. This is not the case; all outcomes need to be collected until the end of the study . 
Section affected: 
Section 5.2  Discontinuation of subjects from study treatment
PPD
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol

12 SEPT 2017 Version 4.0 Page: 147of 205
Modification 6: Clarification was added regarding the start of interim study 
rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo and the continued use of study  aspirin/placebo.
Rationale:  The protocol appeared to mandate the use of interim study  rivaroxaban/
rivaroxaban placebo in subjects who were treated with long -term dual antiplatelet therap y.  
This was never the intent; it is optional for investigators to commence subjects on interim study  rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo. This change to the protocol clarifies that it is optional.  
Elsewhere in the protocol it is clearly  indicated that study  aspirin/placebo can be continued in 
subjects who are treated with dual antiplatelet therap y. This clarification has now also been 
included in this section.   
Section affected:
Section 6.4.2.3  Guidance for the treatment of subjects who develop an acute coronary  
syndrome and those who require percutaneous coronary  intervention with stenting
Modification 7: Minor clarifications were made.
Rationale:  Minor clarifications were made that do not affect the overall study  concept.
Sections affected:
Section 3.1 Study  committees
Section 4.3.1  Overall design rationale
Section 6.3  Treatment assignment
Modification 8: The reference to a lack of an antidote for rivaroxaban was removed.
Rationale:  A provision has been made for the future availabilit y of a specific reversal agent 
for rivaroxaban.Sections affected:
Section 6.4.2.4 Guidance for the treatment of subjects who overdose on study 
rivaroxaban/rivaroxaban placebo
Section 6.4.2.5 Guidance for the treatment of subjects who experience a major bleed
Modification 9: Text regarding post -study  therapy was revised.
Rationale:  At the beginning of the stud y, subjects are transitioned from non -study  aspirin to 
experimental study  treatment. At the end of the study  they  should be transitioned back to non-
study  aspirin.  Other antithrombotic therapies are not approved as alternatives to aspirin and 
reference to their use at the end of the stud y is therefore being deleted.
Section affected:
Section 6.8  Post -study  therapy
Modification 10:  Text regarding the concomitant use of aspirin/aspirin placebo was revised.
Rationale:  The use of study  aspirin/aspirin placebo in subjects who are treated with non- study  
aspirin or dual antiplatelet therap y is optional. As written in the previous version of the 
PPD
Integrated Clinical Study Protocol
BAY 59 -7939/15786
12 SEPT 2017 Version 4.0 Page: 148of 205
protocol, the implication was that this was mandatory  but it has been clarified that it is 
optional. Also, study  aspirin/aspirin placebo may  be continued irrespective of the need for 
other antithrombotic therapies; co ntrary  to what was written in Section 6.9.1, aspirin/aspirin 
placebo does not have to be discontinued.  
Section saffected:
Section 6.9  Prior and concomitant therap y
Section 6.9.1  Combined CYP 3A4 and p- glycoprotein inhibitors and CYP 3A4 
inducers   
Modi fication 11: Clarification was added regarding the reasons for planned 
hospitalizations/procedures and when they  should be considered (S)AEs
Rationale:   This revision reminds investigators that hospitalization planned prior to enrollment 
in the COMPASS tri al should not be considered a SAE.  This is not a change to the protocol;

Modification 14:  For subjects who are randomized after CABG surgery, clarification was made as t o when the first dose of study  drug will be administered.
Rationale:   The goal is to avoid use of stud y antithrombotic therapies within 12 hours of 
administration of non- study  anticoagulants. The previous version of the protocol indicated 
that subjects sho uld not be randomized until at least 12 hours after administration of any  
anticoagulant. After CABG surgery , subjects commonly  receive a morning dose of 
anticoagulant proph ylaxis and are then discharged later in the day . By not allowing  
randomization with in 12 hours of anticoagulant, these subjects could not be randomized prior 
to discharge. With this revision they  can still be randomized before discharge but they  will 
still not receive the first dose of study  anticoagulant until at least 12 hours after la st 
administration of any  anticoagulant.

Modification 15:  Guidance for the management of subjects who develop stroke and who are 
being considered for reperfusion therapy was added.
Rationale:  Investigators have asked for guidance about the management of subjects who 
develop an ischemic stroke a nd who are being considered for reperfusion therapy .  In response 
to these requests, a section was added to the protocol as the topic was not addressed in the 
previous version.
New section:

are being considered for reperfusion therap y 
Modification 16:  An additional subgroup was added to those that will be examined :  “Any 
prior CABG, further subdivided as CABG day s 4-7 before randomization and other prior 
CABG”Rationale: Approximately one -quarter of all subjects enrolled in COMPASS have had a prior 
CABG.  We wish to separatel y examine outcomes in subjects with prior CABG and those 
who have not had prior CABG, to explore whether the effect of treatment is consistent in 
these subgroups. Similarly, within the CABG population we propose to explore the 
consistency  of the treatment effect in those who were randomized earl y post -CABG and those 
who were randomized later post- CABG.

Rationale:
a) It had been stated that the substudy would examine the effect of therapies on asy mptomatic 
cerebral ischemia and bleeds. The reference to “asy mptomatic” cerebral ischemia is 
inaccurate. The se episodes of cerebral ischemia are not asy mptomatic; rather, the sy mptoms 
are not attributed to the cerebral ischemia because the event is not recognized. These episodes 
of cerebral ischemia are thus better described as “covert.”  
b) The substudy  does not examine the effect of antithrombotic therapies on allbleeding 
events , just microbleeds .  To avoid confusion the reference to bleeding assessment has been 
omitted.
c) As originall y designed , the COMPASS MIND substudy  was restricted to subjects over the 
age of 65 years because older subjects are more likely  to have covert cerebral ischemia than 
those who are younger. The age cut off is, however, purel y arbitrary. In order to simplify  
recruitm ent and increase generalizability  of the results the age restriction has been removed.
d) The original timeframe for obtaining an MRI scan was within 3 months of randomization .
This window is being expanded for the following reasons . First, at man y sites the COMPASS 
MIND study  is not approved until several months after the main study , thereby  making some 
subjects alread y enrolled in the study  at participating sites ineligible for the substudy . Second, 
there are sometimes delays in obtaining the MRI scan be cause of limited access to a scanner, 
and this has prevented some consented subjects from obtaining a scan within 3 months of 
randomization. While it is desirable to perform the scan as earl y as possible in order to 
maximize the period of exposure to study drug between scans, the opportunity  to obtain a later 
scan will help to boost recruitment and this gain will outweigh any  possible loss of statistical 
power resulting from a shorter time between the initial and the final scan. The revised 
protocol now ind icates that MRI  scan should be performed within 3 months or as soon as 
possible thereafter and at the end of the stud y.

The PEGASUS trial demonstrated that 33 months of treatme nt with ticagrelor (90 mg twice -
daily  or 60 mg twice -daily ) compared with placebo reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, 
myocardial infarction or stroke by  15-16% (ticagrelor 90 mg: 7.85%, ticagrelor 60 mg: 7.77%, 
placebo 9.04%; p=0.008 and p=0.004, res pectively ) in patients with a history  of my ocardial 
infarction 1 to 3 years earlier. This came at the cost of a 2 -3 fold increase in major bleeding 
(ticagrelor 90 mg: 2.60%, ticagrelor 60 mg: 2.30%, placebo 1.06%; p<0.01 for each dose vs. 
placebo), and the re was no reduction in total mortality  (ticagrelor 90 mg: 5.15%, ticagrelor 60 
mg: 4.69%, placebo 5.16%; p=0.99 and p=0.14, respectively ).
The DAPT trial randomized 9,961 patients with a history  of coronary  stenting with a drug 
eluting stent who had comple ted 12 months of dual antiplatelet therap y with a thienopy ridine 
and aspirin to receive continuing clopidogrel 75 mg once dail y or prasugrel 10 mg once dail y

or placebo for another 18 months. All patients continued receiving aspirin. Continuing 
treatment w ith a thienopy ridine as compared with placebo reduced the rates of stent 
thrombosis by  71% (0.4% vs. 1.4%, p<0.001) and the composite, death, MI  or stroke by  29% 
(4.3% vs. 5.9%, p<0.001) but at the cost of excess moderate or severe bleeding (2.5% vs. 
1.6%, p=0.001) and a borderline significant 36% increase in all- cause death from an y cause 
(2.0% vs. 1.5%, p=0.05).
Excess mortality  seen with extended dual antiplatelet therapy  in the DAPT trial was 
confirmed in a subsequent meta -analysis of 10 randomized tria ls including 31,666 patients 
who had undergone coronary  artery  stenting comparing different durations of dual antiplatelet 
therap y. Shorter duration dual antiplatelet therap y was associated with an 18% reduction in 
all-cause mortality  (HR 0.82, 95% CI  0.69- 0.98; p=0.02), predominantl y due lower non-
cardiac mortality  (HR 0.67, 0.51 -0.89; p=0.006), with similar cardiac mortality  (HR 0.93, 
0.73-1.17; p=0.52). Shorter duration dual antiplatelet therap y was also associated with a lower 
risk of major bleeding (HR 0.58, 0.47- 0.72; p<0.001), but a higher risk of my ocardial 
infarction (HR 1.51, 1.28 -1.77; p<0.001) and stent thrombosis (HR 2.04, 1.48- 2.80; p<0.001).

OldText :
A specific antidote for rivaroxaban is not available.   If rivaroxaban overdose is suspected, the 
use of activated charcoal up to 8 hours after overdose to reduce absorption may  be considered.  
Due to its low solubility , rivaroxaban absorption plateaus at doses of 50 mg and above, thus 
limiting exposure in the majority  of subjects.  Gastrointestinal absorption of rivaroxaban is 
reduced in subjects exposed to high oral doses and thus the anticoagulant effect of an 
overdose of rivaroxaban is expected to be limited.

This section was changed as a result of Modification 8.
OldText :
The management of bleeding in subjects receiving stud y rivaroxaban /rivaroxaban placebo is 
supportive, as rivaroxaban does not have a specific antidote.  Temporary  discontinuation of 
rivaroxaban is expected to be sufficient to control bleeding in most cases because the drug 
half-life is onl y 5-13 hours.  L ocal measures should be applied if needed to control bleeding 
(e.g., local pressure, endoscopy  and injection of a bleeding vessel, embolization) and 
intravenous fluids and blood transfusion support should be provided as indicated.  In the rare case of life -threatening ble eding, the investigator may  consider obtaining advice from a 
hematologist.  Animal studies suggest that both prothrombin complex concentrates and recombinant factor VIIa partially  restore hemostasis following treatment with factor Xa 
inhibitors such as riv aroxaban and a randomized trial involving healthy  subjects treated with 
rivaroxaban has demonstrated that prothrombin concentrates reverse prolongation of the prothrombin time.(30)  Rivaroxaban cannot be dialy zed as it is highl y protein bound.

Added Text:
The decision to use reperfusion therapies (including intravenous, intra -arterial thromboly sis,
or mechanical endovascular approaches) in acute ischemic stroke should follow local practice, 
experience, and guidelines. At present there are limited data to guide treatment in this setting 
in subjects taking riva roxaban. The following guidance is intended to aid clinical decision 
making in this setting. 
At or around the time of the peak drug levels (we suggest in the first 6 hours after a dose), 
clinicians may  choose to unblind and to avoid thromboly sis if the subject is taking 
rivaroxaban. Alternatively, if it is possible to obtain a rivaroxaban anti -Xa level in this time 
period, clinicians may  use this information to decide on the appropriateness of starting

Testing strategy 
Each of the rivaroxaban -based treatment groups will first be compared to the common aspirin 
control group on the primary  efficacy  outcome, followed by  the same comparisons on the 
three ordered secondary  efficacy  outcomes. Figure 1 i llustrates the hy pothesis testing problem 
with ordered h ypotheses. The null hypotheses of no effect corresponding to different efficacy  
outcomes will be grouped into four separate families. Standard logical restrictions will be 
imposed, i.e., the null hypo theses will be split into two branches corresponding to the tests for 
rivaroxaban 2.5 mg plus aspirin (h ypotheses H 1A, H2A, H3A, H4A) and to the tests for 
rivaroxaban 5.0 mg (h ypotheses H 1B, H2B, H3B, H4B).  A null hy pothesis within each branch 
can be test ed if and onl y if the immediately  preceding null hy pothesis is rejected, e.g., 
hypothesis H 2A, is “testable” if and onl y if h ypothesis H 1Ais rejected. Figure 1, these logical 
restrictions are represented by  arrows.
Figure 8-1: Hypothesis testing problem
Multiple hy potheses testing will be performed according to a mixture gatekeeping procedure 
based on the Hochberg test with a truncation fraction of γ= 0.9, which controls the 
family wise error rate at the pre -assigned level of significance α= 5% in the s trong sense.  The

methodology  developed in Dmitrienko and Tamhane (2011, 2013) was recently  proposed in

This section was changed as a result of Modification 2. 
Old Text:The 2 comparisons will be performed using 2 separate stratified log -rank tests.  A step-up 
Dunnett procedure( 0,0) analogous to the Hochberg procedure will be used to control the 
overall ty pe I error level of 5%.  The as ymptotically  normall y distributed log -rank test 
statistics will be ordered | t|(1)< |t|(2)and compared to suitably  defined critical values in a 
stepwise fashion starting with the smaller test statistic | t|(1). If |t|(1)≥ c1= 1.96, i.e. if the larger 
of the two p-values is not greater than the 2- sided 5% ty pe I error level, then both hy potheses 
will be rejected. Otherwise, the null hy pothesis corresponding to the smaller test statistic | t|(1)
will be retained and the larger test statistic | t|(2)will be compared to the larger critical value c2
= 2.223, corresponding to a test at the 2 -sided 2.63% ty pe I error level.  P roton pump inhibitor
use (3 strata levels: not randomized to a proton pump inhibitor ; pantoprazole 40 mg od; 
pantoprazole placebo) will be used as a stratification factor.  Stud y center will not be used as a 
stratification factor.   There will be no formal comparison between the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid 
+ aspirin 100 mg od and rivaroxaban 5 mg bid + aspirin placebo groups.
……
The trial success will be determined based on the totality  of evidence for significance, 
magnitude, and direct ion of treatment effect from the anal ysis of primary  and secondary  
efficacy  outcomes.  If the rivaroxaban-based treatment groups and aspirin control group are 
not significantl y different in the anal ysis of the primary  efficacy  outcome but convincing 
eviden ce of the superiority  of either of the 2 rivaroxaban -based antithrombotic regimens (e.g. 
a reduction of 3 standard deviations) is observed in the anal ysis of secondary  efficacy  
outcomes, then such extreme differences will provide persuasive evidence of sup eriorit y of 
rivaroxaban- based antithrombotic therap y over aspirin -based therap y.

interventions, then the type I error levels specified in Section 8.4.1 will be used in the final 
analysis; if the decision is made to continue with only  one intervention, the final comparison 
will be made at the 5% t ype I error level . 
The Steering Committee will review overall blinded event rates to ensure that they  meet 
protocol projections.  If overall event rates are lower than expected, consideration will be 
given to increasing the sample size or extending the study  duration without knowledge of any  
treatment effect.  The trial will aim to enroll about one-third subjects with PAD; this will be 
monitored during the trial and steps may  be taken to adjust the proportion during the trial.

will be obtained from log-rank tests based on all available data for the stopped arm 
(data from confirmation anal ysis 6 months after respective interim look) and the 
complete data from the comparator arm.
If one intervention was stopped earl y for futility , the final anal ysis will be performed 
when at least 1,513 *subjects in the 2remaining arms have experienced an event.
The final analy sis will be performed according to the multiple testing strategy  as 
described in Section 8.4. P- values for the primary and secondary  hypotheses for the 
intervention stopped early will be obtained from the log- rank tests based on all 
available data for the stopped arm and the complet e data from the comparator arm. It 
can be assumed that for the stopped intervention the corresponding p -value of the 
primary  efficacy  outcome will be greater than 0.05. Thus, for the intervention stopped 
early for futility  the primary  and none of the secon dary outcomes can achieve 
statistical significance at the overall t ype I error level of 5% .  
*The whole study was planned to be stopped when at least 2,200 subjects had experienced a primary outcome 
event. Under the planning assumptions that both alterna tive hypotheses are true, observed randomization times 
and estimated overall incidence rates based on preliminary data, and projected study duration after sample size 
increase, it is expected that 826 subjects in the control arm and each 687 subjects in th e rivaroxaban intervention 
arms will experience a primary outcome event. Dropping one intervention arm early but still expecting that for 
the other comparison the alternative hypothesis holds true, the study needs to be continued until at least 826 + 
687 = 1,513 subjects in the remaining arms have experienced a primary event.
The Steering Committee will review overall blinded event rates to ensure that they  meet 
protocol projections.  If overall event rates are lower than expected, consideration will be given to increasing the sample size or extending the study  duration without knowledge of 
any treatment effect.  The trial will aim to enroll about one-quarter subjects with PAD; 
this will be monitored during the trial and steps may be taken to adjust the prop ortion 
during the trial.
Section 8.6 Determination of sample size
This section was changed as a result of Modification 4. 
Old Text:In this trial, it is planned to randomize at least 21,400 subjects and to continue the study  until 
a minimum of 2,200 subjects experience an event for the primary efficacy outcome.
The aim is to achieve at least 90% power to detect a 20% relative risk reduction (RRR) for 
each of the 2 rivaroxaban -based treatment groups vs. the common aspirin control group.  The 
total number of events needed is shown in Table 8 –1 for different scenari os depending on the 
assumed annual event rate in the aspirin group.  Due to the event -driven study  design, the 
number of randomized subjects, length of enrollment and total study  duration may  vary .  If 
recruitment is going extremely  well, a larger number of subjects may  be recruited.  All

numbers below refer to the minimum number of events to be observed after successful completion of the run -in period.  For the total number of subjects to be enrolled in the run- in 
period, at least 10% must be added to the total number below.
Assumptions for antithrombotic treatment randomization were:
3-arm stud y with 1:1:1 randomization
In total, a minimum of 21,400 subjects are randomized (approximately  7,134 subjects 
per treatment group)
2-sided ty pe I error level of 2.7% for each of the two comparisons to control the 
overall ty pe I error level of 5%
Constant annual event rate in aspirin control group between 3.0% and 4.0%
Effect size: 20% relative risk reduction to be detected for each comparison
Intention- to-treat anal ysis: all subjects randomized are included in the analy sis as 
randomized and the follow -up period for each subject is as long as possible from 
randomization until the date of the Final Follow -up Visit for each subject
Length of recruitment period about 2.5 years 
Early discontinuation of study drug: about 6% and 4% in the 1st and 2nd 6 -month 
periods, and 3% in the 6 -month periods thereafter
The expected total number of observed events and the estimated power for each of the two comparisons are display ed in Table 8−1.

Based on these estimates and the aim to detect a true relative risk reduction of 20% in each of the rivaroxaban arms with at least 90% power, it isplanned to randomize at least 21,400 
subjects and to continue the study  until a minimum of 2,200 subjects experience an event for 
the primary  efficacy  outcome.  I n this multi -center study , each center is expected to 
randomize at least 50 subjects.
Assumpt ions for pantoprazole randomization are: 
Annual event rate for major upper gastrointestinal complications (overt or occult 
bleeding, s ymptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers or erosions, obstruction or perforation) 
in the range of 1.6% to 2.2%

Under these assumptions, the expected total number of major upper gastrointestinal complications is between 450 and 730, depending on the observed event rates and the total 
study  duration. The estimated power for the detection of the true relative risk reduction of 
about 50% for major upper gastrointestinal complications for pantoprazole 40 mg od vs. 
pantoprazole placebo is close to 100% for all scenarios considered.
Sample size estimation was based on the method by Lakatos ( 40) implemented in Power 
Analy sis and Sample Size (PASS) software, version 11.0.7, and on a Statistical Anal ysis 
System (SAS) macro provided by  J. Shih (1995).( 41)  In addition, simulations were

Based on these estimates and the aim to detect a true relative risk reduction of 20% in each of 
the rivaroxaban arms with at least 90% power, it wasplanned to randomize at least 21,400 
subjects and to continue the study  until a minimum of 2,200 subjects experience an event for 
the primary  efficacy  outcome.  I n this multi -center study , each center is expected to 
randomize at least 50 subjects.
The ori ginally  planned sample size of 21,400 and 5 y ear study  duration was based on an 
annual primary  incidence rate in the control group of 3.5% and 90% power to detect a relative 
risk reduction of 20% in each of the rivaroxaban arms. Based on an observed incide nce rate of 
2.9% as of JUL  2015, it is now planned to randomize at least 27,400 subjects. This new 
sample size will maintain current stud y timelines and 90% power to detect a 20% relative risk 
reduction in each of the rivaroxaban arms, based on the followi ng revisions to the original 
assumptions:  
Overall length of recruitment period about 3 to 3.5 y ears and taking observed 
randomization times up to July  2015 into account
2-sided overall t ype I error level of 5% using a truncated Hochberg test (γ = 0.9) fo r 
the testing of the 2primary  hypotheses
Constant overall incidence rate of about 2.9% per y ear, resulting in a constant 
incidence rate of about 3.3% per year for the aspirin control group assuming a 20% 
relative risk reduction for both hy potheses

Censori ng due to non -CV death at an event rate of almost 1% per year
Assumptions for pantoprazole randomization are: 
Annual incidence rate for major upper gastrointestinal complications (overt or occult 
bleeding, s ymptomatic gastroduodenal ulcers or erosions, ob struction or perforation) 
in the range of 1.6% to 2.2%
At least 16,440 subjects included in the study  are not proton pump inhibitor users and 
they are randomized to pantoprazole treatment and control groups in 1:1 ratio
2-sided ty pe I error level of 5%

Intention- to-treat anal ysis: all subjects randomized are included in the analy sis as 
randomized and the follow -up period for each subject is as long as possible from 
randomization until the date of the Final Follow -up Visit for each subject
Under these assumptions, the expected total number of major upper gastrointestinal complications is between 570 and 780, depending on the observed event rates and the total 
study  duration. The estimated power for the detection of the true relative risk reduction of 
about 50% for major upper gastrointestinal complications for pantoprazole 40 mg od vs.

On February  6, 2017, the COMPASS Data Safety  Monitoring Board (DSMB) recommended 
discontinuation of the rivaroxaban/aspirin arms of the COMPASS trial because of a clear 
benefit of one of the two rivaroxaban -containing arms. The DSMB recommendation was 
made because for rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 100 mg od , the z -value (test statistic of the 
log-rank test) for efficacy  had crossed the critical value for earl y efficacy  as outlined in the 
DSMB charter consistently  over a 3- month pe riod, and the z -value for rivaroxaban 5 mg bid 
had reached conventional significance for efficacy . The Steering Committee concurred with 
the recommendation of the DSMB, and the sponsor decided to stop the rivaroxaban/aspirin 
arms of the stud y based on the recommendation of the DSMB and the Steering Committee. 
The sponsor is making rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 100 mg od available earl y for 
COMPASS trial subjects as part of a long- term open -label extension (LTOLE) protocol 
amendment. The dedicated LTOLE sections in this document describe LTOL E activities only ; 
activities related to the pantoprazole/placebo arm remain unchanged with the exception of the 
removal of the washout visit. L TOLE activities will be coordinated with those of the ongoing 
pantoprazole/placebo arms of the trial where possible until pantoprazole/placebo part of the 
trial is completed.
Section 1.2 Study rationaleNew text:1.2.4 Long- Term Open -Label Extension
As described in Section 1.1, due to the clinical effect of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 
100mg od over existing standard treatment with aspirin , the sponsor will offer the

rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 100 mg od to trial subjects in a long -term open -label 
extension (L TOLE) until the rivaroxaban treatment is commercially  avail able for this 
indication or for approximately  3 years from regulatory  approval of LTOLE in a country , 
whichever comes first. The same efficacy  and safety variables as in COMPASS will be 
collected in LTOLE in a descriptive way .
In COMPASS, the combination rivaroxaban 2.5mg bid + aspirin 100mg od compared to 
aspirin 100mg alone:
Reduced the relative risk for the primary  composite of stroke, m yocardial infarction 
and cardiovascular death by  24% (p<0.0001)
Increased the risk of ISTH modified major bleeding sig nificantl y (HR 1.70, 95% CI  
1.40- 2.05, p<0.00001)
No significant increase was found in intracranial or fatal bleeds
Reduced the risk for pre -specified net clinical benefit, a composite of outcomes of 
irreversible harm, significantly  (HR 0.80, 95% CI 0.70-0.91, p=0.00052)
Rivaroxaban 5.0 mg BID alone compared to 100 mg aspirin alone:
Did not significantl y reduce the hazard for the primary outcome (HR 0.90, 95% CI  
0.79- 1.03, p=0.11), but increased major bleeding
Findings were consistent across the majorit y regions and subgroups.
Section 1.3 Benefit -risk assessment
New text:
…...  I n the COMPASS trial, the efficacy  of pantoprazole will be compared with placebo for 
the prevention of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, obstruction or perforation in 
subjects randomized to the combination of rivaroxaban and aspirin, rivaroxaban alone, or aspirin alone, using a partial factorial design.
Long -Term Open -Label Extension –amended
Rivaroxaban 2.5mg bid + aspirin 100mg od has demonstrated superior efficacy  on reducing 
major adverse cardiac event (MACE) in patients with CAD/PAD as compared to aspirin alone 
and reduced the risk for pre-specified net clinical benefit significantl y (refer to Section 1.2.4). 
Therefore, the sponsor aims to make rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid + aspirin 100 mg od available in 
a long -term open -label extension .

in subjects taking rivaroxaban. The following guidance is intended to aid clinical decision 
making in this setting. 
At or around the time of the peak drug levels (we suggest in the first 6 hours after a dose), 
clinicians may  consider to avoid thromboly sis. If it is possible to obtain a rivaroxaban anti- Xa 
level in this time period, clinicians may  use this information to decide on the appropriateness 
of starting thrombol ysis.

If therapeutic anticoagulation is required, subjects should start therapeutic anticoagulation 
immediately , irrespective of the timing of the last dose of stud y rivaroxaban.  
Long -Term Open -Label Extension − amended
Subjects who develop a need for anticoagulant therapy (e.g., thromboprophy laxis in 
subjects undergoing major orthopedic surgery , acute venous thromboembolism, atrial 
fibrillation, mechanical aortic valve replacement) must discontinue L TOLE medication. 
Guidance for converting see below:
Converting from rivaroxaban to oral anti -coagulants
Rivaroxaban affects INR, so INR measurements made during co -administration with oral 
anticoagulant may not be useful for determining the appropriate dose of oral anticoagulant. 
One approach is to discontinue rivaroxaban and begin both a parenteral anticoagulant and oral 
VKA at the time the next dose of rivaroxaban would have been taken.
Converting from rivaroxaban to parenteral anti -coagulants
Discontinue rivaroxaban and give the first dose of parenteral anticoagulant at the ti me that 
the next rivaroxaban dose would be taken.
Study rivaroxaban can be restarted at the discretion of the investigator in subjects who 
no longer have a need for non- study  anticoagulant therapy  (e.g., after completion of 
anticoagulant thromboprophy laxis or anticoagulant treatment for venous thromboembolism). 
Guidance for restarting see below:
Converting patients from VKAs to rivaroxaban
When converting patients from VKAs to rivaroxaban, INR values will be falsely  elevated 
after the intake of rivaroxaban. The INR is not valid to measure the anticoagulant activity  
of rivaroxaban, and therefore should not be used. 
Converting patients from parenteral anticoagulant to rivaroxaban
For patients currentl y receiving a parenteral anticoagulant, start rivaroxaban 0 to 2 hours 
before the time of the next scheduled administration of the parenteral drug (e.g. LMWH) or at 
the time of discontinuation of a continuously  administered parenteral drug (e.g. intravenous 
unfractionated heparin).

14.1 COMPASS MIND substudy -amended
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) substudy evaluating the incidence of clinically silent 
brain infarcts and subclinical brain ischemia  (COMPASS -MIND) 
Background: Clinically -evident strokes are the tip of the iceberg of vascular injury  to the 
brain.( 42)During the past de cade, improvements in, and wider application of, magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) make it clear that subclinical (i.e., covert) strokes are more frequent than clinically -evident brain infarcts. In population -based cohorts with a mean age of 65 
years, the prevalence of covert strokes is between 15% and 20% (i.e., several times the 
prevalence of s ymptomatic brain infarcts).  Covert strokes are not benign; they  are associated 
with cognitive and functional decline and are harbingers of future clinical strokes. Guidelines 
under development are likely  to recommend that patients discovered to have covert strokes be 
treated aggressivel y regarding secondary  prevention.
Figure 14–1: Covert brain infarct (arrow) on MR imaging (T -1 sequence)
Most covert brain infarcts in population -based studies are small subcortical strokes (often 
called lacunar infarcts) (see Figure 14–1) for which hy pertension is the dominant risk factor. 
Because of their small size, such strokes are clinically  unapparent if they  do not involve motor 
or sensory  tracts. In subjects with clinical vascular disease that will comprise the COMPASS 
trial cohort, the spectrum and underl ying pathogenesis of covert strokes is unknown and may  
well be different from those in population- based studies.
There are no published randomized trials aimed at prevention of covert strokes. The 
AVERROES trial compared the novel oral anticoagulant apixaban with aspirin in atrial fibrillation patients deemed unsuitable for warfarin anticoagulation and included 1,185 patients who underwent brain MR imaging a t entry . Covert brain infarcts were seen in 20%.

The trial was terminated after onl y one year of follow -up due to efficacy, and the precipitous 
trial close -out resulted in repeat MR imaging in only  80% of those having an MRI  at entry .
The AVERROES MRI  substudy  (unpublished) was thus underpowered to determine the effect 
of apixaban on prevention of covert brain infarcts in atrial fibrillation patients deemed 
unsuitable for warfarin.
Prior epidemiologic investigations have demonstrated that selected biomar kers are 
significantl y associated with the future development of cardiovascular events, including 
clinically  evident strokes. Several of these markers (e.g., C -reactive protein) have been 
incorporated into clinical risk prediction models which assist clin icians in determining which 
patients are at low, moderate, or high risk of suffering a stroke. Further, our understanding of 
the mechanism of action of antithrombotic drugs has been increased b y studying the effect of 
these therapies on biochemical marker s associated with atherothrombosis. The 
COMPASS -MIND substudy  provides a unique opportunity  to examine biomarker as 
predictive of covert brain infarction and to understand how antiplatelet therapies and 
anticoagulants may  modify  this process. The main ob jective of COMPASS- MIND biomarker 
testing is to assess the association between selected biomarkers and the risk of overt and especiall y covert stroke in patients with established CAD and PAD . Markers to be measured 
include inflammatory  markers (such as C- reactive protein), markers of neuronal injury  (such 
as my elin basic protein, S -100B, neuron -specific enolase) and several miscellaneous markers 
(such as troponin, nt -proBNP) that have been shown to be powerful predictors of stroke in 
patients with atrial fibrillation.  DNA collected in these same patients will enable exploration of the genetic determinants of stroke, including etiologic subt ypes of stroke (cardioembolic, 
large vessel, small vessel disease) and in particular covert subcortical ischemia that is 
demonstrated on brain MRI  and is associated with cognitive decline.
Hypotheses:
1. Treatment with rivaroxaban will reduce the incidence of covert brain infarcts (detected by  
blinded comparison of initial vs. end -study  MRIs) compared with aspirin among patients with 
symptomatic atherosclerotic vascular disease involving the coronary  and lower limb arteries.
2.  The addition of rivaroxaban to aspirin will reduce the incidence of covert brain infarcts 
(detected b y blinded comparison of initial vs. end -study MRIs) compared with aspirin among 
patients with sy mptomatic atherosclerotic vascular disease involving the coronary  and lower 
limb arteries.
Pre-specified secondary  outcomes would consider the effect of rivaroxaban on (1) non-lacunar 
covert brain infarct s; (2) volume of white matter hy perintensities; (3) all incident strokes, 
including clinical strokes (anticipated rate 1.2%/ yr among peripheral arterial disease patients 
and 0.8%/ yr among subjects with CAD
159),and all covert strokes ; (4a) functional decline
(Standard Assessment of Global -Activities in the Elderly  [SAGE ]) and [4b] cognitive decline 
(Montreal Cognitive Assessment [MoCA] and digit sy mbol substitution).160  Exploratory

analyses will examine the predictive value of biomarkers (C -reactive protein, nt-proBNP) as 
independent predictors of covert brain infarcts.
161Design: A phase II trial seeking evidence of efficacy  in a convenience sample of 1500 
COMPASS participants with readable baseline MRI  scans, 500 assigned to each treatment 
arm, but balanced for age, prior stroke, and h ypertension. Participants will undergo limited 
brain MRI  sequences (Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery  [FLAI R]), T -1, T-2, and T -
2*GRE sequences after randomization and near end -study  coupled with assessment of 
function (SAGE), and cognition (MoCA, digit s ymbol substitution).   Recruitment will occur 
at COMPASS sites with access to high -quality  (>1.0 Tesla159) reasonably -priced MR imaging.  
Images will be transmitted to the central MR imaging center via discs.  Two -stage central 
interpretation blinded to treatment will be carried -out, with all incident covert infarcts 
confirmed b y a second independent interpreter.  The has experience with collection and 
analysis of brain MRIs performed in substudies of several randomized trials:  AVERROES, 
PURE, APOLLO, and (planned) TIPS 3 MIND.
Some s ubjects , in participating centers, will have DNA collected at baseline and blood 
collected at baseline and at the 1 month visit.162DNA and blood collections are 
optional. (Section 7.1.1 , 7.1.2.3 and 7.1.2.4.1 )159.The samples will be processed, and aliquots 
will be shipped for long -term storage in liquid nitrogen at the coordinating center in  
 Canada.  Blood samples will be processed and stored in s uch a way to allow future 
analysis of these aliquots for selected biomarkers, some of which have been observed in other 
studies to be predictors of stroke, and others which have a plausible association with 
cardiovascular outcomes.  Detailed information co ncerning blood collection, processing, 
storage, and shipping is provided in the Manual of Operations.
Power :  There is insufficient information in the literature to accuratel y estimate the incidence 
of covert brain infarcts for the COMPASS study  cohort, bu t given a 3%/ year incidence in 
population -based cohorts of similar age, 5%/ yr in the aspirin arm is a conservative estimate. 
Given a sample size of 1500 participants randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms (i.e. 500 
patients in each treatment group), there wil l be approximately  70% power to assess a 
treatment effect of rivaroxaban of 45%.  For the key  pre-specified secondary  analy sis of the 
effect of rivaroxaban on the combined clinical and covert ischemic strokes with estimated incidence of 7% per year, the st udy power would be 0.72 to detect a 40% reduction and 0.85 
to detect a 35% reduction.  About 5% of participants will not undergo the second MRI  due to 
acquiring a contraindication (e.g., pacemaker), death or refusal, so the power will be slightly  
less.  Th ese power calculations are based on a conservative estimate of the incidence of covert 
brain infarcts during aspirin therap y in the COMPASS population, and higher rates would 
result in increased statistical power. 
Implications:  The COMPASS MRI  substudy  is the first randomized trial of an anticoagulant 
to prevent covert brain infarcts in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease. Evidence that 
rivaroxaban reduces covert stroke better than or in addition to aspirin would hav e an immense

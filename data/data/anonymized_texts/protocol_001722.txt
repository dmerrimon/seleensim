Synopsis  
 
Concept and Rationale:  
Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) represents a potential curative treatment for patients with 
relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) B- cell lymphomas , and is presently the modality that yields the best 
chance of prolonged progression -free survival in this population of patients.  
 
Unfortunately, approximately half of these patients suffer from relapsed disease and die from their disease within  1 to 3 years after transplantation , depending on the disease status before 
transplantation.  
Treatment of relapsed B- cell lymphomas  after ASCT is challenging , and there are no standard of care or 
guidelines for this problem.  
 Rituximab maintenance may have some limited role in follicular lymphoma post autologous 
transplantation , but most of these patients have been exposed to rituximab and meet the criteria of 
being resistant to rituximab . With the increased number of patients who are undergoing transplan tation 
and with the improved non -relapse mortality, relapse after transplant has become a larger factor in 
terms of survival.  Relapses occur mostly within the first 2 years after ASCT .  
 
Zydelig  (Idelalisib)  is the 1
st marketed PI3Kδ inhibitor that has bee n effective against indolent B -cell 
lymphomas (i NHL) with remarkable activity in heavily treated patients, leading to an overall response 
rate (ORR) of 57 %, a median progression free survival (PFS) of 11 months and a median duration of 
response of 12.4 mon ths.1 
We propose to incorporate Zydelig  into a maintenance paradigm pos t ASCT for patients with iNHL  and 
transformed iNHL (tiNHL) . The goal of this strategy is to increase the likelihood that patients are able to 
maintain a remission after ASCT at 1 and 2 years of follow -up.   
 Mirroring the paradigm incorporating BCR/ABL TKI , lenalidomide and Sorafenib  therapies in the post -
transplant treatments of Ph+ ALL , MM,  and FLT3 ITD AML respectively, we propose inhibiting the 
proliferation and survival of iNHL cells by blocking the B- cell receptor signaling (BCR) via inhibiting the 
downstream molecular target PI3Kδ with Zydelig  in the post -transplant setting.  
   
Primary Objective(s):  
1. Determine the toxicity and safety  of incorporating Zydelig  into the po st- ASCT maintenance 
setting for iNHL and tiNHL immediately after ASCT.

 Secondary Objective(s) : 
1. Assess the efficacy of incorporating Zydelig into the post -ASCT maintenance setting for iNHL and 
tiNHL immediately after ASCT with a corresponding endpoint of  1-year PFS after the 
transplantation . 
2. 2-year Progression Free Survival ( PFS) . 
3. Non -relapse mortality (NRM).  
4. Overall survival (OS) . 
5. Correlatives  studies : 
a.  To perform pharmacodynamics studies . 
b. To understand mecha nism of resistance to Zydelig.  
c. To assess the effect of Zydelig  on the immune system .

Initial dose will be 150 mg PO  BID. Dose modifications for toxicities du e to Zydelig  will follow the 
package  insert recommendations as below . For other severe or life -threatening toxicities related to 
Zydelig , withhold drug until toxicity is resolved. If resuming Zydelig  after interruption for other severe or 
life-threatening toxicities, reduce the dose to 100 mg twice daily. Recurrence of other severe or life-
threatening Zydelig -related toxicity upon rechallenge should result in permanent discontinuation of 
Zydelig . Toxicity, as well as graft failure will be monitored continuously throughou t the trial.  
 
Statistical Methods: 
We are studying a cohort of 3 4 patients with iNHL or tiNHL . A single -stage open -label design will be used 
for the study .  Please see section 14.0 Statistical Considerations for more information.

1. OBJECTIVES  
 
1.1. Primary Objective  
1.1.1.  Determine the toxicity and safety of incorporating Zydelig  into the post - ASCT 
maintenance setting for iNHL and tiNHL immediately after ASCT . Toxicity will be monitored 
cont inuously throughout the trial.  
 
1.2. Secondary Objectives  
1.2.1.   Assess the efficacy of Zydelig  into the post-  ASCT maintenance setting for iNHL and tiNHL 
immediately after ASCT .  
The corresponding endpoint is to r eport the 1 -year PFS after the transplantation. PFS is 
defined as time to progression, relapse of t he disease or death. The efficacy  endpoint 
would be improvement of 1 -year PFS after ASCT by 20% based on an approximate 
baseline PFS of 60% for iNHL and tiNHL.1,2 The expected 1 -year PFS will be around 80%.  
Survival without progression or death will be determined using the Kaplan -Meier 
estimates at 1 year post ASCT.  
1.2.2.  2-year PFS . 
2-year PFS will be determined using the Kaplan -Meier estimates at 2  years  post ASCT . 
1.2.3.  Non -relapse mortality (NRM) . 
NRM is defined as death in the absence of competing risks, relapse or progression of disease. This secondary endpoint will be characterized and presented as a cumulative 
incidence at 3 months and 12 months  after SCT. 
1.2.4.  Overall survival (OS) . 
Survival without death will be determined and presented as Kaplan -Meier estimates at 1 
and 2 years post ASCT.  
1.2.5.  Correlative  studies.

2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1. Zydelig  (Zydelig , GS-1101, Cal -101)  
Zydelig  is is an inhibitor of PI3Kinase delta which is highly expressed in malignant lymphoid B-
cells. PI3Kδ inhibition results in apoptosis of malignant tumor cells. In addition, Zydelig  inhibits 
several signaling pathways, including the B- cell receptor. Zydelig  was r ecently approved by the 
U.S. Food and Drug Association (FDA) for the treatment of the following:  
• relapsed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), in combination with rituximab, in patients for 
whom rituximab alone would be considered appropriate therapy due to  other co -
morbidities  
• relapsed follicular B- cell non -Hodgkin lymphoma (FL) in patients who have received at least 
two prior systemic therapies  
•  relapsed small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) in patients who have received at least two prior 
systemic therapies.1,2,3-5  
 
2.2. Study Disease –  Indolent B -cell Lymphomas /Transformed B -cell Lymphomas  
Early published clinical trial of Zydelig  in multipl e relapsed and treated indolent B -cell 
lymphomas showed a respectable ORR of 57% (6%  CR) a short median time to response of 1.9 
August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
12 
 months and a prolonged median duration of response of 12.5 months. Responses were  seen in 
all lymphoma subtypes. The estimated median progression -free survival and overall survival 
were 11 months, and 20 months, respectively. The estimated survival  rate at one year was 80%. 
This population of patients included patients who already ha d undergone HDT/ASCT , and these 
patients had no  different responses to Zydelig  compared to the other patients.4 
There are some reports in the literature showing that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway 
might be activated in aggressive B- cell lymphoma.6-10 Other PI3K inhibitor s, such as SAR245408, 
showed  some activity in 25% of aggressive B- cell lymphoma.11 
 
2.3. Rationale  
Autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) represents a potential curative treatment for  
patients with relapsed and/or refractory (R/R) B- cell lymphomas and is presently  the modality 
that yields the best chance of prolonged survival w ithout disease in this population of patients.   
Unfortunately, approximately half of these patients suffer from relapsed disease and die from 
their disease in 1 to 3 years after transplantation depending , on the disease status before 
transplantation.  
 
Treatment of relapsed B- cell lymphomas after ASCT is challenging , and there are no standard of 
care or guidelines for this problem.  
 
Rituximab maintenance may have some limited role in follicular lymphoma post autologous transplantation , but most of these  patients have been exposed to rituximab and meet the 
criteria of being resistant to rituximab. With the increased number of patients who are undergoing transplantation and with the improved non -relapse mortality, relapse after 
transplant has become a larg er factor in te rms of survival. Relapses occur mostly within the first 
2 years after ASCT .  
 Zydelig  is the 1st marketed PI3Kδ inhibitor that has been effective against indolent B -cell 
lymphomas (iNHL) with remarkable activity in heavily treated patients, leading to response rate (ORR) of 57%, a median progression free survival  (PFS) of 11 months and a median duration of 
response of 12.4 months.
4 
 We propose to incorporate Zydelig  into a maintenance paradigm post ASC T for patients with 
iNHL and transformed iNHL (tiNHL). The goal of this strategy is to increase the likelihood 
patients are able to maintain a remission after ASCT at 1 and 2 years of follow -up.   
Mirroring the paradigm incorporating BCR/ABL TKI and Sorafe nib targeted therapies in the post -
transplant treatments of Ph+ ALL and FLT3 ITD AML respectively, we propose inhibiting the 
proliferation and survival of iNHL cells by blocking the B- cell receptor signaling (BCR) via 
inhibiting the downstream molecular ta rget PI3Kδ with Zydelig  in the post -transplant setting.

child -bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or 
barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation.   Female subjects of childbearing potential should have a negative 
pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of Zydelig. Male subjects 
must agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with the first dose of the study dru g Zydelig.  Female and male participants must agree to use contraception for at 
least 30 days after the last dose of Zydelig . Women of childbearing potential is defined as 
women who continues to have menstrual periods, have not had a tubal ligation, or the  
removal of fallopian tubes, ovaries or uterus.

3.3 Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
Both men and women , and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.   
 4. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES  
 
All patients must sign the IRB approved informed consent. Human protection committee approval of 
this protocol and consent  form is required. Patients must be registered with the Study 
Coordinator/Coordinating Center Contact, Veronica Rodriguez . The following documents are to be 
submitted for review: signed i nformed consent, eligibility checklist completed and signed, all 
supporting documents that demonstrate eligibility requirements have been met such as lab results, 
pathology reports, medical history/progress note of Investigator. Please fax or email these 
documents to: Veronica Rodrigiez , Fax: 410 -328-1975, Veronica.Rodriguez@umm.edu . Instructions 
concerning correlative/special studies will be conveyed at the time of registration. Upon review and verification of eligibility,  an email or fax document will be sent to the registering center to confirm 
dose assignment.  
 5. TREATMENT PLAN  
 
5.1 Zydelig  Administration  
Treatment will be orally administered on an inpatient and outpatient basis with the starting 
dose of 150 mg by mouth twice a day  for continuous 28 -day cycles .  Treatment will continue  
until progression, intolerance, or patient/physician discretion  to stop therapy . Zydelig  will be 
started with count recovery  (ANC over 500  cells/mm
3, non -transfused platelet count over 
20,000 K/mm3) in patients  who are at least 30 days after induction and/or transplant but no 
more than 120 days post -transplant . 
 
Reported adverse events and potential risks are described in Section 9.  Appropriate dose 
modifications for Zydelig  are described in Section 7 . No investigational or commercial agents , or 
therapies other than those described below may be a dministered with the intent to treat the 
patient's malignancy.  
 
Patients should swallow Zydelig  tablets whole each morning and evening (i.e. every 12hours). 
Tablets may be taken with or without food. Patients should keep  track of adherence to Zydelig  
thera py by using the “Patients Drug Diary”  (see appendix B ). This diary will be collected at the 
end of each cycle. At the time of collection, the diary will be reviewed by a staff member and the patient will be prompted to complete any blank entries before com pletion of the visit. Should a 
patient miss  or vomit  a dose of Zydelig  within less than 6 hours of the planned dose, the patient 
should take it as soon as possible . Patients who miss  or vomit  a dose of Zydelig longer than 6 
hours after the planned dose  should wait until the next scheduled dose to resume taking 
Zydelig . 
 
5.2 General Concomitant Medication and Supportive Care Guidelines  
Because there is a potent ial for interaction of Zydelig  with o ther concomitantly administered 
drugs through the cytochrome P 450 system, the case report form must capture the concurrent 
August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
16 
 use of all other drugs, over- the-counter medications, or alternative therapies.  The Principal 
Investigator should be alerted if the patient is taking any agent known to affect or with the 
potent ial to affect selected CYP450 isoenzymes.  
 
Agents typically used in the supportive care of patients undergoing treatment for NHL  should 
not be manipulated due to potential drug interactions , unless toxicity is observed.  
 
For management of skin toxicity ( rash); i.e.,  topical emollients, topical steroid s or keratolytic 
creams can be used.  
 Avoid concurrent use of Zydelig with other drugs that may cause liver toxicity . 
 For management of grade ≥ 2 pneumonitis , diarrhea,  or hepatotoxicity,  Zydelig  needs to be 
held .  Systemic corticosteroids can be started at the discretion of the investigator.  
 Recent reports showed increased risk of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and Cytomegalovirus infection (CMV)  associated with Zydelig . Because of th ese known ris ks, Trimethoprime -
sulfamethoxazole ( TMP -SMX ) will be given as one double -strength tablet daily or three times 
per week , or as one single -strength tablet  once  daily .  For patients who cannot take TMP -SMX, 
we will offer dapsone 100 mg tablet once a day or at ovaquone suspension 1500 mg once a day. 
Blood CMV PCR will be monitored once a month; no prophylaxis is required. PCP prophylaxis and CMV monitoring will start once the patient start s taking Zydelig and will end 1 month after 
stopping Zydelig. Patients wil l be taken off the study drug if they develop  PCP pneumonia , if 
CMV PCR becomes  detectable in the blood  or they develop  CMV infection.  
 
5.3 Duration of Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue for 1 year or 12 cycles (28 days per cycle) after transplant or until one of the following criteria applies: 
- Disease Progression  
- Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment  
- Unacceptable adverse event(s)  
- Evidence of PCP pneumonia or CMV vire mia, confirmed at 2 consecutive blood draws at 
least 1 day apart with any value  >500IU/mL in plasma or evidence of documented CMV 
disease .  
- Patient decides to withdraw from the study  
- General or specific changes in the patient ’s condition render the patient unacceptable 
for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.  
 
5.4 Duration of Follow -up 
Patients will be followed for 24 months after end of study treatment or until death, whichever 
occurs first. Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse  events will be followed until 
resolution or stabilization of the adverse event .  
 
5.5 Criteria for Removal from Study  
Patients will be removed from study at the time of disease progression as determined by  
protocol section 8.4.  Exclusions are made for relaps e isolated to the CNS which is able to be 
managed through local therapy.

 7. DOSING DELAYS/DOSE MODIFICATIONS  
 
Please  refer to table  2 below .   
Patients who experience a Grade 2 or 3 toxicity and recover to ≤ Grade 1 (o r to pretreatment 
baseline level of toxicity) may continue treatment at the next lower dose level (i.e.,  Dose level 2 
down to dose level 1 ). 
 
Once the dose has been reduced, patients must r emain at the reduced dose for 28  days. Dose 
escalation may occur at the discretion of the investigator and may occur every 28  days . Patients 
may have their dose de -escalated  from level 2 to level 1,  three times before being removed 
from  treatment . 
 Please note:  
- There are no dose escalati ons above  150 mg  BID 
- There are no dose reductions below 100 mg BID

interrupt Zydelig  until toxicity improves to ≤ grade 2, and then resume Zydelig  with one 
dose level reduction for all subsequent cycles.  
For other grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity, discontinue Zydelig . 
 
8. CRITERIA FOR RESPONSE, PROGRESSION, AND RELAPSE   
For purposes of this  study, patients should be restaged every 3 cycles during treatment (i.e., 
cycles 3, 6, 9, 12, etc.), then every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months for another year.  
The Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma is adopted.13 
 
8.1 Complete Response  
Comp lete response (CR) is defined as the following:  
•  Complete disappearance of all detectable clinical evidence of disease and disease -
related symptoms ( if present before therapy ). 
• In patient s whe re the CT or PET/CT scan was positive before therapy, a post- treatment 
residual mass of any size is permitted as long as it is PET/CT -negative.  
•  The spleen and/or liver, if considered enlarged before therapy on the basis of a CT or 
PET/CT, should be considered normal size by imaging studies, and nodules related to 
lymphoma should disappear. However, determination of splenic involvement is not always reliable because a spleen considered normal in size may still contain lymphoma, whereas an enlarged spl een may reflect variations in anatomy, blood volume, the use of 
hematopoietic growth factors, or other causes other than lymphoma.  
•  If the bone marrow was involved by lymphoma before treatment, the infiltrate must 
have cleared on repeat bone marrow biops y. The biopsy sample on which this 
determination is made must be adequate (with a goal of > 20 mm unilateral core). If the sample is indeterminate by morphology, it should be negative by immunohistochemistry. A sample that is negative by immunohistochemist ry, but demonstrating a small 
population of clonal lymphocytes by flow cytometry will be considered a CR until data becomes  available demonstrating a clear difference in patient outcome.  
 
8.2 Partial Response  
Partial response (PR) is defined as the following:  
•  At least a 50% decrease in the sum of the product of the diameters (SPD) of up to six of 
the largest dominant nodes or nodal masses. These nodes or masses should be selected according to all of the following: a) they should be clearly measurable in at least two perpendicular dimensions; b) if possible, they should be from disparate regions of the 
body; and c) they should include mediastinal and retroperitoneal areas of disease 
whenever these sites are involved.  
•  No increase should be observed in the si ze of other nodes, liver, or spleen.  
•  Splenic and hepatic nodules must regress by ≥ 50% in their SPD, or, for single nodules, in 
the greatest transverse diameter.  
•  With the exception of splenic and hepatic nodules, involvement of other organs is 
usuall y assessable and no measurable disease should be present.  
•  Bone marrow assessment is irrelevant for determination of a PR if the sample was 
positive before treatment. However, if positive, the cell type should be specified in the report (e.g., large -cell lymphoma or small neoplastic B cells). Patients who achieve a CR by 
August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
24 
 the above criteria, but who have persistent morphologic bone marrow involvement, will 
be considered partial responders. When the bone marrow was involved before therapy and a clinical CR was achieved, but with no bone marrow assessment after treatment, 
patients should be considered partial responders.  
•  No new sites of disease should be observed.  
•For patients  if the CT or PET/CT was positive before therapy, the post- treatment PET 
should be positive in at least one previously involved site.  
 8.3 Stable Disease  
Stable disease (SD) is defined as when the patient fails to attain the criteria needed for a CR or PR, but does not fulfill those for progressive disease (see below). The CT or PET/CT should be positive at prior sites of disease, with no new areas of involvement on the post-
treatment CT or PET/CT.  
 
8.4 Progression or Relapse  
Disease progression  (PD) or relapse is defined as  any one of the following:  
•  Lymph nodes should be considered abnorma l if the long axis is > 1.5 cm, regardless of 
the short axis. If a lymph node has a long axis of 1.1 to 1.5 cm, it should only be considered abnormal if its short axis is > 1  cm. Lymph nodes ≤ 1 cm by ≤ 1 cm will not be 
considered as abnormal for relapse o r progressive disease.  
•  Appearance of any new lesion > 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the end of therapy, even 
if other lesions are decreasing in size. Increased FDG uptake in a previously unaffected site should only be considered relapsed or progressiv e disease after confirmation with other 
modalities. In patients with no prior history of pulmonary lymphoma, new lung nodules 
identified by CT are mostly benign. Thus, a therapeutic decision should not be made solely 
on the basis of the CT or PET/CT withou t histologic confirmation.  
 
•  At least a 50% increase from nadir in the SPD of any previously involved nodes, or in a 
single involved node, or the size of other lesions (e.g., splenic or hepatic nodules). To be 
considered progressive disease, a lymph node  with a diameter of the short axis of < 1 cm 
must increase by ≥ 50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm, or > 1.5 cm in the long axis.  
•  At least a 50% increase in the longest diameter of any single previously identified node > 
1 cm in its short axis.  
•  Lesion s should be PET -positive if a typical FDG- avid lymphoma or one that was PET -
positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with current PET 
systems (< 1.5 cm in its long axis by CT).  
 
8.5 Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
Measurable extra  nodal disease should be assessed in a manner similar to that for nodal 
disease. For these recommendations, the spleen is considered nodal disease. Disease that 
is not easily assessable  (e.g., pleural effusions, bone lesions) will be recorded as present or 
absent only, unless, while an abnormality is still noted by imaging studies it is found to be histologically negative.  
 
Clinical lesions  will only be considered measurable when they ar e superficial (e.g., skin 
nodules, palpable lymph nodes).  
 
August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
25 
 Lesions on chest X -ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly defined 
and surrounded by aerated lung. However, CT or PET/CT is preferable.  
 
Conventional CT and MRI  should be per formed with cuts of 10 mm or less in slice 
thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. This applies to the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Head & neck and 
extremities usually require specific protocol s. 
 
Ultrasound should not be used to measure tumor lesions that are clinically not easily 
accessible when the efficacy  endpoint s of the study is objective response evaluation. It is a 
possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable no des, subcutaneous 
lesions, and thyroid nodules. Ultrasound might also be useful to confirm the complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical examination.

9. ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 9.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
 
CTCAE term (AE description) and grade: The descriptions and grading scales found  in the revised NCI 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.03  will be utilized for AE reporting. 
All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.03. A copy of the 
CTCAE version 4.03 can be downloaded from the CTEP  web site.  
 Attribution of the AE:  
• Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study treatment.  
• Probable – The AE is likely related to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely – The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
• Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study treatment.  
 The Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE):  
 SAE is defined as any of the following:  
• Any death that occurs while the patient is enrolled in the study or within 30 days of completing the 
study   
• Immediately life -threatening adverse event  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization  
• Prolongation of an existing hospitalization  
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Medically important event  
• Disability/incapacity (persistent or significant)  
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an adverse event, unless it results in hospitalization or death.

9.3 Adverse Event Characteristics /Evaluation 
   
An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to 
the NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 3. Any adverse 
event which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given episode will have each 
change of grade recorded on the adverse event case report forms/worksheets . 
 
All adverse events , regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness.

 • CTCAE term (AE description) and grade:  The descriptions and grading scales found in 
the revised NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 3 will 
be utilized for AE reporting.  All appropriate treatment areas should have access to a copy 
of the CTCAE version 4.0 3.  A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 3 can be downloaded from the 
CTEP web site  
(http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm ). 
Table 7  
V4.0 CTCAE 
Grading  Grade 1  Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated.  
 Grade 2  Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental ADL.  
 Grade 3  Severe or Medically Significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization or 
prolongation or hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL.  
 Grade 4  Life Threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated.  
 Grade 5  Death related to AE  
Seriousness  A serious adverse event is any adverse event occurring at any dose or during any use of the investigational 
condition that:  
 †Results in death ; or 
 †Is life threatening; or places the subject, in the view of the investigator, at immediate risk of death 
from the event as it occurred  (Note: This does not include an adverse event that, had it occurred in a 
more severe form, might have caused death.); or  
 †Results in a persistent or significant disability/incapacity  (substantial disruption of one’s ability to 
conduc t normal life functions); or  
 †Results in or prolongs an existing inpatient hospitalization  (hospitalization is defined as an inpatient 
admission, regardless of length of stay, even if the hospitalization is a precautionary measure for 
continued observation. (Note: Hospitalization [including hospitalization for an elective procedure] for a 
preex isting condition which has not worsened does not constitute a serious adverse event.); or  
 †Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  (in offspring of subject exposed to the investigational condition 
regardless of time to diagnosis);or  
 Other important medica l events  that may not result in death, not be life threatening, or not require 
hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse event when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical  intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed previously (designated above by a †).  
Duration  Record the start and stop dates of the adverse event. If less than 1 day, indicate the appropriate length of 
time and units.  
Action 
Taken  Did the adverse event cause the study treatment to be discontinued?  
Relationship 
to Test Condition  Did the investigational condition cause the adverse event? The determination of the likelihood that the 
investigational condition caused the adverse event will be provided  by an investigator who is a qualified 
physician. The investigator’s signed/dated initials on the source document or worksheet that supports the causality noted on the AE form, ensures that a medically qualified assessment of causality was done. This 
initialed document must be retained for the required regulatory time frame. The criteria below are 
intended as reference guidelines to assist the investigator in assessing the likelihood of a relationship 
between the test drug and the adverse event based upon t he available information.  
The following components are to be used to assess the relationship between the investigational 
condition and the AE ; the greater the correlation with the components and their respective elements (in 
number and/or intensity), the more likely the investigational condition caused the adverse event (AE):  
 Exposure  Is there evidence that the subject was actually exposed to the investigational condition such 
as: reliable history, acceptable compliance assessment (pill count, diary, etc.), expected 
pharmacologic effect, or measurement of drug/metabolite in bodily specimen?  
 Time Did the AE follow in a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the

• ‘Expectedness’:  AEs can be ‘Unexpected’ or ‘Expected’ for expedited reporting purposes 
only. The following abnormalities/adverse events are considered "expected" and their 
presence/absence should be solicited, and severity graded, at baseline and for each cycle 
of treatment.  
 Fatigue  
 Skin rash  
 Diarrhea  
 Decreased  neutrophils, hemoglobin and platelet count  
 Increased serum ALT and AST  
 Cough and pneumonitis

9.4 Serious  Adverse Event Reporting  
Investigators  are responsible for monitoring the safety of patients who have entered this  
study and for alerting the UMGC CC DSM/QAC to any event that seems unusual, even if  
this event may be considered an unanticipated benefit to the patient. Any adverse  event 
that meets the definition of serious  which occur s at any time during the clinical study or 
within 30 days of receiving the last dose  of study medication, whether or not related to 
the study drug will be reported as follows:  
 
All  SAE’s , whether or not related to the study drug , will be  reported  via OnCore to the 
DSM/QAC according to the UMGCC DSM/QAC SOP.  
 
Treatment- related toxicities and other adverse events will be monitored through standard 
medical practice, in addition to scheduled follow -ups as outlined in the treatment plan. 
Adverse events  should be described according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, v. 4.03 (Table 7).  
(see http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm).  
 
Any serious adverse event, or follow up to a serious adverse event (including death due to 
any cause other than progression of the cancer under study)  that occurs to any subject 
from the time the consent is signed through end of study participationor the i nitiation of 
new anti -cancer therapy, whichever is earlier (whether or not related to protocol therapy)  
must be reported within 24 hours to the Coordinating Center   (Attn:   Dr. Jean Yared –  FAX 
(410) 328- 1975) using FDA Form 3500A (MedWatch form).   The Co ordinating Center will 
then report the event to the FDA using FDA Form 3500A (MedWatch Form).   
 
Additionally, any serious adverse event considered by an investigator (who is a qualified 
physician) to be related to protocol therapy that is brought to the a ttention of the study 
team at any time outside of the time period specified in the previous paragraph also must Course  investigational condition?  
Is the time of onset of the AE compatible with a study- induced effect (applies to trials with 
investigational medicinal product[s])?  
 Likely 
Cause  Is the AE not reasonably explained by another etiology such as underlying disease, other 
drug(s)/vaccine(s), or other host or environmental factors?  
August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
32 
 be reported immediately to the Coordinating Center using FDA Form 3500A (MedWatch 
Form).  
 Any unexpected grade 4 or 5 adverse event and any dea th during the study period must 
be reported using FDA Form 3500A (MedWatch form) to the Coordinating Center within 
one working day  (24 hours)  of discovery or notification .  Please submit the adverse event 
report using FDA Form 3500A to :   
 Veronica Rodrigu ez   
Room N9E12

Phone: 410 -328-9747   
Fax: 410- 328-1975   
Email: Veronica.Rodriguez @umm.edu  
 The event should also be reported locally to the site Institutional Review Board (IRB) per local policy.   
 Otherwise, unexpected serious adverse events must be reported within 15 days.  
 If the event meets the criteria for FDA mandatory IND safety reporting (serious AND unexpected), the Coordinating Center will report the event to the FDA using FDA Form 3500A ( MedWatch form).  Events which are assessed as “unexpected fatal or life -
threatening” should be reported to FDA by the Coordinating Center as soon as possible, 
but no later than 7 calendar days following the  initial receipt of the information.  All other 
unexpected serious suspected adverse reactions suggesting significant risk to human 
subjects should be reported to FDA no later than 15 calendar days following the initial 
receipt of the information.   
 
A copy of all 15 Day Reports and Annual Progress Reports are to be submitted as required by FDA, Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices agency (PMDA) or other local regulators.  
 All subjects with serious adverse events must be followed up for outcome/resolution for at least 90 days after stopping protocol therapy.  
 
9.5 Routine Adverse Event Reporting  
An investigator who is a qualified physician will evaluate all adverse events according to the NCI Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0 3. Any adverse 
event which changes CTCAE grade over the course of a given episode will have each change of grade recorded on the adverse event case report forms/worksheets.  
 
All adverse events regardless of CTCAE grade must also be evaluated for seriousness.  
  
9.6 Data Safety Monitoring Plan 
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of  study  
participants.  This  safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate 
reporting of adverse events as  noted above.

This study will be monitored by the UMGCCC Data and Safety Monitoring and Quality  
Assurance Committee and will follow the Data Safety and Monitoring Plan as outlined in the Clinical Investigator Handbook of the UMGCCC Clinical Research Office. Monitoring 
will be  conducted as per the plan on file with th e University of Maryland IRB (also 
available in the  UMGCCC Clinical Investigator Handbook.  
       
9.7 Secondary AML/MDS  
AML/MDS events are now to be reported via AdEERS  (in addition to your routine AE 
reporting mechanisms).  In CTCAE v4.0, the event(s) may be reported as either: 1) Leukemia secondary to oncology chemotherapy, 2) Myelodysplastic syndrome, or 3) Treatment- related secondary malignancy.  Any malignancy possib ly related to cancer 
treatment (including AML/MDS) should also be reported via the routine reporting 
mechanisms outlined.  
  
10. PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION  
 
10.1 Zydelig  (GS-1101, CAL -101) ()  
 
 
The substance acts as a phosphoinositide  3-kinase inhibitor; more specifically, it blocks 
P110δ, the delta isoform of the enzyme phosphoinositide 3 -kinase . 
 
10.2 Availability  
Zydelig  (CAL -101) will be supplied and distributed by Gilead Sciences, Inc. Zydelig  is 
supplied in bottles of 60  tablets of 1 00 mg and 150 mg strengths. The bottles of Zydelig  
are white high -density polyethylene with a child -resistant cap and a polyester or cotton 
coil. The tablet shape is plain -faced, modified oval. The tablets contain the inactive 
ingredients microcrystalline cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, sodium starch glycolate, and magnesium stearate. The 100 mg tablets are orange film coated, and the 150 mg tablets are pink film coated. Tablets should be swallowed whole . 
 
10.3 Storage and Stability  
Zydelig  tablets should be stored at a controlled room temperature of 25ºC (77ºF), with a 
range from 15ºC (59ºF) to 30ºC (86ºF). While stability of study drug tablets stored at 

August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
34 
 controlled room temperature has been confirmed, brief excursions to temperatures a s 
low as – 10°C or as high as 40°C (eg, during shipping) will not adversely affect the drug. 
Updated stability data will be provided to the sites, as appropriate.  
At the end of the study, any remaining unused Zydelig  should be destroyed according to 
local institutional procedures.  
 
Preparation  
Zydelig  should be dispensed in the original container.  
 
Administration  
The prescribed dose of Zydelig  should be taken orally. At each dose administration, the 
tablet number corresponding to the appropriate dose of study drug is to be swallowed whole with 100 to 200 mL (~ 4 to 8 ounces) of water. In case of breakage of the tablets in 
the oral cavity, addit ional water should be taken as a rinse.  
Zydelig  may be taken with or without food. There are no known dietary restrictions 
related to study drug use.   Overdose Precautions  
In Phase 1 studies, an MTD for Zydelig  was not reached when administering the dru g 
continuously at dose levels of 350 mg/dose BID (700 mg per day). However, in this protocol, an overdose is defined as administration of more than the prescribed daily study drug ( Zydelig ) dose (ie, >300 mg in a single day).  
 In a subject who experiences  an overdose, consideration should be given as to whether 
study drug administration should be temporarily interrupted. If the overdose ingestion is recent and substantial, and if there are no medical contraindications, use of gastric lavage or induction of  emesis may be considered. Observation for any symptomatic side effects 
should be instituted, and biochemical and hematological parameters should be followed closely (consistent with the protocol or more frequently, as needed). Appropriate supportive management to mitigate adverse effects should be initiated.  
 Inadvertent Exposure and Spill Precautions  Based on available data from nonclinical studies, Zydelig  does not appear to be acutely 
toxic, genotoxic, or irritative at levels that are likely to result from inadvertent exposure to 
the contents of broken tablets. However, personnel handling the drug should use 
reasonable precautions to avoid eye contact, skin contact, inhalation, or ingestion of the 
study drug product. For further information regarding i nadvertent exposure and spill 
precautions, please consult the Zydelig  investigator brochure.  
 10.4 Pharmacokinetics  
 Absorption  
Following oral administration of a single dose of Zydelig in the fasted state, the median Tmax was observed at 1.5 hours. Idelalisib exposure increased in a less than dose -
proportional manner over a dose range of 50 mg to 350 mg twice daily in the fasted state. 
Relative to fasting conditions, the administration of a single dose of Zydelig with a highfat 
meal increased idelalisib AUC 1.4 -fold. Zydelig can be administered without regard to 
food.  
 
August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
35 
 Distribution  
Idelalisib is greater than 84% bound to human plasma proteins with no concentration 
dependence. The mean blood -to-plasma ratio was 0.7. The population apparent central 
volume of distribution at steady state is 23 L  
 Metabolism and Elimination  
Idelalisib is metabolized to its major metabolite GS -563117 via aldehyde oxidase and 
CYP3A. GS- 563117 is inactive against PI3Kδ in vitro. Idelalisib undergoes minor 
metabolism by UGT1A4. The population apparent systemic clearance at steady -state is 
14.9 L/hr. The population terminal elimination half- life of idelalisib is 8.2 hours. Following 
a single dose of 150 mg of [14C] idelalisib, 78% and 14% of the radioactivity was excreted in feces and  urine, respectively. GS -563117 accounted for 49% of the radioactivity in the 
urine and 44% in the feces.  
 
Specific Population  
Age, Gender, Race and Weight  
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicated that age, gender, race, and weight had no 
effect on id elalisib exposure . 
 
Patients with Renal Impairment  
A pharmacokinetic study following a single dose of 150 mg of Zydelig was performed in 
healthy subjects and subjects with severe renal impairment (CrCl 15 to 29 mL/min). Creatinine clearance had no effect o n idelalisib exposure. No dose adjustment is needed 
for patients with CrCl ≥15 mL/min.  
 
Patients with Hepatic Impairement  
A pharmacokinetic study of Zydelig was performed in healthy subjects and subjects with 
hepatic impairment. The geometric mean AUC incr eased up to 1.7 -fold in subjects with 
ALT or AST or bilirubin values greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) compared to 
subjects with normal AST or ALT or bilirubin values. Limited safety and efficacy data are available for patients with baseline AST  or ALT greater than 2.5 x ULN or bilirubin greater 
than 1.5 x ULN, as these patients were excluded from Studies 1 and 2. Patients with baseline hepatic impairment should be monitored for signs of Zydelig toxicity . 
 
Drug Interactions  
 
In Vitro Studies  
Idelalisib is a substrate for aldehyde oxidase, CYP3A, and UGT1A4 in vitro. Idelalisib 
inhibits CYP2C8, CYP2C19, CYP3A, and UGT1A1 and GS -563117 inhibits CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP3A and UGT1A1 in vitro. Idelalisib and GS -563117 are not likely to inhibit 
CYP1A, CYP2B6, and CYP2D6. Idelalisib induces CYP2B6 and CYP3A4, but does not induce 
CYP1A2 in vitro. GS - 563117 does not induce these enzymes. Idelalisib and GS -563117 are 
substrates of P -glycoprotein (P -gp) and BCRP in vitro. Idelalisib is not a substrate o f 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, or OCT2. GS - 563117 is not a substrate of OATP1B1 or 
OATP1B3. Idelalisib inhibits P -gp, OATP1B1, and OATP1B3, and GS -563117 inhibits 
OATP1B1, OATP1B3 in vitro. Idelalisib is not likely to inhibit BCRP, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3, and GS -563117 is not likely to inhibit P -gp, BCRP, OCT2, OAT1, or OAT3.

 Effect of Other Drugs on Idelalisib  
A single dose of 150 mg of Zydelig was administered alone and after rifampin (a strong 
CYP3A and P -gp inducer) 600 mg once daily for 8 days in healt hy subjects. Rifampin 
decreased the geometric mean idelalisib AUC by 75% and the geometric mean Cmax by 
58%. Avoid coadministration of Zydelig with strong CYP3A and P -gp inducers. A single dose 
of 400 mg of Zydelig was administered alone and after ketoconazole (a strong CYP3A and 
P-gp inhibitor) 400 mg daily for 4 days in healthy subjects. Ketoconazole increased the 
geometric mean idelalisib AUC by 1.8 -fold. No changes in the geometric mean Cmax were 
observed. Patients taking concomitant CYP3A inhibitors sh ould be monitored for signs of 
Zydelig toxicity  
 
Effect of Idelalisib on Other Drugs  
A single oral dose of midazolam 5 mg was administered alone and after Zydelig 150 mg for 
15 doses in healthy subjects. The geometric mean midazolam Cmax increased by 2.4 -fold 
and the geometric mean midazolam AUC increased by 5.4 -fold. Avoid coadministration of 
Zydelig with CYP3A substrates, as Zydelig is a strong CYP3A inhibitor. A single dose of 10 mg of rosuvastatin (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate) was administered alone and after Zydelig 150 mg for 12 doses in healthy subjects. No changes in exposure to rosuvastatin were observed. A single dose of 0.5 mg of digoxin (P -gp substrate) was administered alone 
and after Zydelig 150 mg for 19 doses in healthy subjects. No changes  in exposure to 
digoxin were observed.  
 
10.5 
Toxicity .  
Hepatotoxicity  
Fatal and/or serious hepatotoxicity occurred in 18% of patients treated with Zydelig monotherapy and 11% of patients treated with Zydelig in combination trials. Elevations in 
ALT or AST greater than 5 times the upper limit of normal have occurred. These findings 
were generally observed within the first 12 weeks of treatment and were reversible with 
dose interruption. After resumption of treatment at a lower dose, 26% of patients had recur rence of ALT and AST elevations. Discontinue Zydelig for recurrent hepatotoxicity. 
Avoid concurrent use of Zydelig with other drugs that may cause liver toxicity. Monitor ALT and AST in all patients every 2 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, every 4 
weeks for the next 3 months, then every 1 to 3 months thereafter. Monitor weekly for liver toxicity if the ALT or AST rises above 3 times the upper limit of normal until resolved. 
Withhold Zydelig if the ALT or AST is greater than 5 times the upper limit  of normal, and 
continue to monitor AST, ALT and total bilirubin weekly until the abnormality is resolved . 
  
Severe Diarrhea or Colitis  
Severe diarrhea or colitis (Grade 3 or higher) occurred in 14% of patients treated with 
Zydelig monotherapy and 19% of p atients treated with Zydelig in combination trials . 
Diarrhea can occur at any time. Avoid concurrent use of Zydelig and other drugs that cause diarrhea. Diarrhea due to Zydelig responds poorly to antimotility agents. Median time to resolution ranged betwee n 1 week and 1 month across trials, following 
interruption of Zydelig therapy and in some instances, use of corticosteroids . 
 
Pneumonitis  
Fatal and serious pneumonitis occurred in patients treated with Zydelig. In randomized 
clinical trials of combination therapies, pneumonitis occurred in 4% of patients treated 
August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
37 
 with Zydelig compared to 1% on the comparator arms. Time to onset of pneumonitis 
ranged from  <1 to 15 months.  Patients taking Zydelig  who present with pulmonary 
symptoms such as cough, dyspnea, hyp oxia, interstitial infiltrates  on a radiologic exam, or 
a decline by more than 5% in oxygen saturation should be evaluated for pneumonitis.  If 
pneumonitis is suspected, interrupt Zydelig  until the  etiology of the pulmonary symptoms 
has been determined.  P atients with pneumonitis thought to be caused by Zydelig  have 
been treated with discontinuation of Zydelig  and administration of corticosteroids.   
 
Infections  
Fatal and/or serious infections occurred in 21% of patients treated with Zydelig monotherapy and  36% of patients treated with Zydelig in combination trials. The most 
common infections were pneumonia, sepsis, and febrile neutropenia. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of infection and interrupt Zydelig for Grade 3 or higher infection. 
Serious or fatal Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) or cytomegalovirus (CMV) 
occurred in  <1% of patients treated with Zydelig. Consider prophylaxis for PJP. Interrupt  
Zydelig in patients with suspected PJP infection of any grade, and permanently  
discontinue Zydel ig if PJP infection of any grade is confirmed. Interrupt Zydelig in the  
setting of positive CMV PCR or antigen test until the infection has resolved. If Zydelig is  
subsequently resumed, patients should be monitored (by PCR ) for CMV reactivation at 
least mo nthly .  
 
Intestinal Perforation  
Fatal and serious intestinal perforation occurred in Zydelig -treated patients. At the time of 
perforation, some patients had moderate to severe diarrhea. Advise patients to promptly 
report any new or worsening abdominal pain , chills, fever, nausea, or vomiting. 
Discontinue Zydelig permanently in patients who experience intestinal perforation  
 
Severe Cutaneous Reactions  
Fatal cases of Stevens -Johnson syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) have 
occurred in patients  treated with Zydelig. If SJS or TEN is suspected, interrupt Zydelig until 
the etiology of the reaction has been determined. If SJS or TEN is confirmed, permanently discontinue Zydelig. Other severe or life -threatening (Grade ≥3) cutaneous reactions, 
inclu ding dermatitis exfoliative, rash, rash erythematous, rash generalized, rash macular, 
rash maculo - papular, rash papular, rash pruritic, exfoliative rash, and skin disorder, have 
been reported in Zydelig- treated patients. Monitor patients for the development of severe 
cutaneous reactions and discontinue Zydelig.  
 Anaphylaxis  
Serious allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported in patients on Zydelig. In patients who develop serious allergic reactions, discontinue Zydelig permanently and institute appropriate supportive measures.  
 Neutropenia  
Treatment- emergent Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia occurred in 25% of patients treated with 
Zydelig monotherapy and 46% of patients treated with Zydelig in combination trials. Monitor blood counts  closely.  
 Embryo -fetal Toxicity

38 
 Based on findings in animals, Zydelig may cause fetal harm when administered to a 
pregnant woman. Idelalisib is teratogenic in rats, at systemic exposures 12 times those reported in patients at the recommended dose of 150 mg twice dai ly. Advise females of 
reproductive potential to avoid becoming pregnant while taking Zydelig. If contraceptive 
methods are being considered, use effective contraception during treatment, and for at 
least 1 month after the last dose of Zydelig .

14. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
39 
 A true  proportion of s tudy subjects that are not removed from the study for toxicity or intolerance 
of 0.70 or higher will be considered satisfactory in this particular patient population. If the true 
proportion of severe toxicity - free patients is 50% or less, then Zydelig will not be considered a 
prom ising maintenance treatment post Autologous stem cell transplantation d ue to unacceptable 
toxicity . 
 A single -stage open -label design wil l be used for the study. With 3 4 eligible patients on the study, 
the Type I error or probability of declaring drug desirable if the proportion of subject s removed from 
study due to toxicity or intolerability is 0.5 0 or  higher, is 0.075.  The probability of rejecting the 
Zydelig as unacce ptable due to severe toxicity compound if the proportion of subject who 
developed severe toxicity is less or equal to 30% rate is less than 20%. Hence, the study will have an adequate about 80% power. Addressing the safety of Zydelig,  a maximum width 90% c onfidence 
interval for any grade 3 or higher toxicity will be about 32%, assuming that a total of 31 patients are 
enrolled. For instance, if 3 out of 31 patients (10%) develop grade 3 or higher non -hematologic 
toxicity, then a 90% confidence interval for the true toxicity rate is between 3% and 24%. For 31 
patients in this study, if the true unknown probability of a rare toxicity is 10%, the probability of observing 1 or more toxicities is 96%, for 5% it is 80%, and if the true toxicity rate is 3% then the probability of observing one or more rare toxicities is 61%.  
 
We plan to accrue 34 eligible patients to account for about 10% possible drop -out 
 
14.1 Study Design/ Primary Endpoints  
This single cohort open -label study  will accrue 34 patients  with  iNHL or tiNHL . The 
biologically active dose of Zydelig  will be 1
st used at 100/ 150 mg PO BID. Within patient 
dose reductions are allowed for hematologic and non -hemato logic toxicities above grade 
2. The proportion of patients removed from the study due to toxicity will  be reported , 
along with all toxicities specified by type and grade . 
 
Early stopping guideline for toxicity: Toxicity  will be monitored continuously . If it 
becomes evident that the proportion of patients being removed from the study for toxicity convincing ly exceeds 50%, the study will be halted for a safety consultation.  The 
toxicity stopping rule will hold enrollment . 
 
14.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
A sample size of 34 patients will be accrued and will be required to account for possible 
drop -out and inevaluabi lity. The e arly stopping rule  is defined above. Anticipated accrual 
is 1 patient per institution every 2 months. Therefor e, accrual is anticipated to take  from 
20 to 36 months.  
 
14.3 Stratification Factors   
- Patients will be analyzed based on the indolent or aggressive type of NHL given that the two groups historically have different outcomes after AutoSCT . 
- Patients will be analyzed based on average daily dose of Zydelig  through  the treatment 
duration to asses s for dose dependence on progression rate . 
 
14.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints

40 
 PFS is defined as the time from the date of ASCT till progression or death whatever 
comes first. PFS function will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier approach with 90% 
Confidence Interval.  
Analysis of secondary objective(s):  
The 1 -year PFS will be estimated and reported using the Kaplan -Meier curve with the 
corresponding 90% confidence interval.  
14.4.2  2-year PFS will be calculated with the same method as 1- year PFS (see 13. 4.1). 
14.4.3  Cumulative incidences of NRM at  3 months and 12 months  by competing risks  model 
and Grey’s test. 
14.4.4   The Cox regression model will be used to assess plausible risk factors for PFS and OS. 
The correlatives findings will be incorporated  into time- to-event analyses using 
appropriate statistical models. Statistical analysis will be conducted by the BSS of the GCC.

 19. APPENDIX D CORRELATIVE STUDIE S 
 
 19 .1 Background and Overview  
It is clear that some lymphomas become “addicted” to one or more oncogenic pathways, including the 
PI3K/Akt/mTOR  axis. Patients with iNHL who are reliant on this pathway may be more responsive to 
Zydelig , which blocks PI3Kδ (1). However, there are no approved predictive biomarkers for PI3K/mTOR 
inhibitors’ activity. A recent report demonstrated that PTEN, p- AKT, and p -p70S6K correlated with 
response to trastuzumab in patients with metastatic breast cancer, lending suppo rt to the importance of 
the activation status of key proteins of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway as predictive biomarkers for 
response (2).  
 Similarly to other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, Zydelig  activity is limited by de novo or acquired resistance 
(3
). For example, p110α -mediated constitutive activation of PI3K has been shown to be a mechanism of 
resistance in this pathway through limiting the efficacy of p1 10δ-selective inhibition ( 4). The MEK1/2 
(mitogen -activated kinase 1/2)/ERK1/2 (extracellular signal- regulated kinase 1/2) pathway is one of the 
most frequently dysregulated signaling cascades in cancer, including in hematological malignancies ( 5). 
While PI3K inhibition induces compensatory activation of p -ERK, co -inhibition of the PI3K and ERK 
pathway potentiates the activity of PI3K inhibitors in several malignancies, including T -cell lymphomas 
(6-8). Given tha t the nature of our study lacks adequate power to definitively evaluate these biomarkers, 
our goal in this pilot study is to assess the feasibility and potential signal from several candidate biomarkers for response and resistance to Zydelig. 
 A s  a  P I 3 K δ  i nhibitor, Zydelig  has a profound effect on the immune system ( 9
). It has been associated 
with colitis, pneumonitis, and hepatotoxicity suggestive of an autoimmune process. A recent report has 
demonstrated that inhibition of PI3Kδ in mice has  a protective effect against several non -hematological 
cancers (10). The mechanism of action shown in this study was PI3Kδ -mediated inactivation of myeloid-
derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and regulatory T cells (Treg) resulting in upregulation of CD8+ T cells. 
In addition, PI3Kδ play a role in the anti- tumor response of the natural killer (NK) cells ( 11, 12). Given 
these interesting results, we will determine whether regulatory T cell, CD8+ T cell, CD4+ T cell, NK cell, and MDSC populations c hange in patients enrolled in this trial, immediately prior to Zydelig , and at 3 
time points post starting Zydelig  treatment (4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months following the start of 
Zydelig ).  
 Whole exome sequencing (WES) has emerged as a powerful method for correlating genetic mutations 
with treatment response. Cancers are often associated with genetic alterations that result in up - or 
down- regulation of particular signaling pathways that can now be furth er defined through WES. Van 
Allen et al. recently performed whole exome sequencing on samples from patients with urothelial carcinoma that showed that somatic mutations in ERCC2 , a component of the nucleotide excision repair 
pathway, correlate with response to cisplatin ( 13
). We propose to perform a similar approach using WES 
on formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded (FFPE) tissue sections or frozen tissue blocks from enrolled, 
consented patients and to compare DNA from tissue samples to germline DNA that will be extracted 
from either peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or histologically normal tissue. In addition, we will repeat a biopsy at the time of relapse and perform WES in order to assess  for the acquisition of 
additional genetic alterations that might explain the mechanism of resistance.  
 In summary, correlative studies will be performed on samples from consenting patients to examine the following aims:  
 
August 22nd, 2017, v 3.0, Jean Yared, M.D., Zydelig  maintenance post -AutoSCT for iNHL  or tiNHL  
 
47 
 • Expression levels of p -AKT, PI3Kδ , PI3Kα, PTEN, p -p70S6K, and p -ERK pre - and post -Zydelig . 
Tumor samples (either bone marrow [BM] or lymph node [LN]) will be examined using 
immunohist ochemistry (IHC).  
• Flow cytometric characterization of circulating MDSCs, NK cells, regulatory T cells, CD 4+ T cells, 
and CD8+ T cells pre -Zydelig  and at 3 time points following the start of Zydelig  (post -Zydelig ) at 
weeks 4 and 12, and at 6 months.  
• Whole exome sequencing of tumor and germline DNA pre -Zydelig  and at relapse post -Zydelig .  
• Participation in the  correlative studies portion of this study is highly encouraged but 
optional.  
 
19.2 Time Points  
Peripheral blood and tumor samples for WES and IHC will be collected at 2 time points:  
 
 Pre-treatment: FFPE or frozen tissue blocks samples taken from patients at time of 
transformation or relapse prior to starting Zydelig  will be acquired . . Tissues obtained closer to 
starting Zydelig  are highly preferred, but earlier biopsies for patients who will not have repeat 
biopsies just prior to study enrollment are acceptable. These samples will serve as a baseline 
for tracking acquired mutations or other genetic alterations associated with th erapy 
resistance at relapse. The purpose of IHC and WES here is to evaluate biochemical and genetic markers for PI3K pathway activation and assessment of recurrent somatic mutations in lymphoma.   
 
 Post -Zydelig  treatment: Samples taken following relapse of lymphoma after SCT and Zydelig  
treatment should be strongly encouraged for all patients, especially for those who had a 
biopsy just prior to starting Zydelig . These samples will be compared to baseline samples  for 
tracking acquired alterations in signaling pathways associated with therapy resistance at 
relapse. The purpose of IHC and WES here is to identify biochemical and genetic factors that may contribute to “escape” from Zydelig -mediated suppression of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis, 
and to assess for changes in recurrent somatic mutation profiles and clonal architecture compared to a prior biopsy.  
 
For immunological studies, peripheral blood will be collected immediately prior to starting Zydelig  
and at the following time points after starting Zydelig : 4 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months.  
All samples, except for frozen specimens intended for WES, will be shipped to Maciej Kmieciak, 
PhD at VCU Massey Cancer Center ( 19.6.4). Frozen tumor specimens intended for WES will b e 
shipped to the Fehniger Lab at Washington University ( 19.7 ).   
The Sample Collection Table 9 outlines the sampling requirements for each time point and 
correlative endpoint.  
 
19.3 Collection and Processing at Participating Sites for IHC and Immunologic St udies  
Peripheral blood: 30 mL of whole blood will be drawn directly into 3 anticoagulated 10 mL blood 
collection tubes (containing sodium heparin or EDTA). Invert tubes 8 -10 times to mix sample with 
anticoagulant. Samples will be labeled as specified in se ction 19.6.1  below and immediately

 shipped at ambient temperature by overnight c ourier to VCU Massey Cancer Center (see 19.6.4  for 
shipping details). Samples must arrive at VCU Massey Cancer Center within 24 hours of blood 
draw. Coordinate with Dr.  Maciej Kmieciak  to ensure proper delivery on a business day .   
 
Please note  that an additional tube of blood may be required for WES at certain time points (see 
19.4 below).  
 
Tumor samples will be obtained by core needle biopsy (3 -5 cores) or whole LN res ection at each 
time point. Institutional procedures should be followed for the procurement of the tumor samples. Procured BM or LN samples for IHC should be placed in formalin and held at room temperature 
until shipping (see Section 19.6.2 ). Please note  that processing of tissue for WES samples is 
different from that described in this section .  
 
The Sample Collection Table 9  outlines the sampling requirements for each time point and 
correlative endpoint.  
 
19.4 Collection and Processing at Participating Sites for WES Studies  
For disease LN samples collected fresh, immediate snap freezing of an excisional biopsy piece or 
core biopsies is preferred. For disease bone marrow samples collected fresh, RBC lysis followed by 
centrifugation to form a cell pellet, and snap freezing is preferred. Peripheral blood samples will be 
processed as described in section 19.6 , and sent immediately to VCU Massey Cancer Center for 
further processing (see 19.6.4 for shipping information). One tube of blood (10 mL) is required fo r 
each WES time point. Frozen specimens will be held in a freezer until shipped in batch on dry ice to 
Washington University. For FFPE tissue, tissue blocks or cores will be shipped to VCU Massey 
Cancer Center at room temperature in batch.  
 
The Sample Col lection Table 9  outlines the sampling requirements for each time point and 
correlative endpoint.  
 
19.5 Sample Labeling  for WES and IHC Studies  
Each collected sample should be labeled as follows:  
 Study number  
 Patient sequence identification number  
 Date of collection  
 Time of collection  
 Study time point (ie, pre- treatment or time post- treatment)  
 
19.6 Shipping to VCU Massey Cancer Center  
19.6.1 All blood samples (See Section 19.6.4) for each patient must be shipped on dry ice by 
overnight c ourier immediately following collection. Samples must arrive within 24 hours of blood 
draw. Delivery must be coordinated with Dr.  Maciej Kmieciak to ensure receipt of samples on a 
business day.   
 
19.6.2 Fixed tumor samples should not be shipped until both pre - and post -treatment samples 
have been acquired (ie, batched for each patient). The samples should be shipped in formalin at room temperature by overnight c ourier as soon as possible after the post -treatment samples have 
been procured. If post -treatment samples will not be procured, proceed with shipping of the pre -
treatment sample.

 Rabbit mAb #3787 (Cell Signaling) ( 2), Phospho -p44/42 MAPK (Erk1/2) (Thr202/Tyr204) (D13.14.4E) XP® 
Rabbit mAb #4370 (Cell Signaling) (17), and Phospho -p70 S6 Kinase pThr389 Antibody PA1 -526 (Cell 
Signaling) (2). Any FFPE samples inte nded for WES analysis will be shipped from VCU MCC to 
Washington University in batch.  
 
19.8.2 Blood samples will be processed immediately after arrival at VCU Massey Cancer Center for 
isolation of PBMC using Ficoll- Hypaque according to manufacturer -specified protocol and as previously 
described (14). Cells obtained for the pre - and post -treatment samples will each be divided into 2 
cryogenic tubes: tube A containing approximately 5 x 106 PBMC and tube B containing the remaining 
cells. For sequencing samples, 5 x 106 PBMC (tube A) will be pelleted, snap frozen, and shipped in batch 
to Washington University for nucleic acid isolation and sequencing.  
 19.8.3 Flow cytometry analysis of PBMC samples will be performed by VCU Massey Cancer Center to 
assess the circulating levels of MDSCs, NK cells, regulatory T cells, CD4+ T cells, and CD8+ T cells. 
Validated antibodies for flow cytometry staining in this study include the following: anti- human CD33 PE 
(Biolegend), anti -human CD11b PE/Cy7 (Biolegend), anti -human HLA -DR Antibody  APC (Biolegend), anti -
human Foxp3 PE (B ioscience), anti -human CD8a PE/Cy7 (Biolegend), anti -human CD4 FITC (Biolegend), 
anti-human CD25 APC (Biolegend), anti- human CD3 APC/Cy7 (Biolegend), anti -human CD56 PE 
(Biolegend), and Rat IgG2a K Isotype control PE (Bioscience) (18
). 
 
19.9 Sample Processing at Washington University  
Genomic DNA (gDNA) will be isolated from FFPE or frozen tissue samples including diseased tissue and 
paired non -malignant tissue (QIAamp DNA mini kit, Qiagen). Quality control and mass assessments will 
be performed to ensure gDNA integrity prior to sequencing (Agilent bioanalyzer). From gDNA, Illumina sequencing libraries will be generated as described (19
). Whole exome capture will be performed per 
manufacturer’s instruction (Nimblegen V3). Illumina sequencing will be performed as described (19). 
Somatic calls will be made using the latest version of the somatic variant bioinformatic pipeline (The 
Genome Institute at Washington University), utilizing sequencing data from paired lymphoma and non -
malignant tissue. Validation of variants may be confirmed using a custom -capture (Nimblegen), followed 
by Illumina sequencing approach ( 20). 
 
19.10 Sample Tracking  
Submission of all tumor samples will be logged into the appropriate fields in the database.  
 
19.11 Pharmacokinetics assessment  
Zydelig  displayed in early trial linear pharmacokinetics (ie, not time dependent), a less -than dose -
proportional increase in exposure, and achieved steady state by day 8. Zydel ig twice -daily administration 
resulted in higher trough concentrations, as expected, vs once -daily dosing at the corresponding dose 
level.

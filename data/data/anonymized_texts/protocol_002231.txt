Controlled, Multicenter, Evaluation of the Safety and Efficacy of  Preoperative N1539 In Colorectal Surgery 
Name  of Active Ingredient:   
Meloxicam  Phase of Development:   3b 
Objective:   The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
preoperative dosing of N1539 30 mg in subjects undergoing colorectal surgery, including clinical laboratory tests, wound healing evaluation, incidence of anastomotic leaks, and incidence of Adverse 
Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs).  
Additional objectives include:  
• Evaluation of N1539 treatment impact on overall postoperative recovery  course, including 
total opioid consumption, length of hospital stay, pain control, cost of hospital stay, return of bowel function, mobilization, and satisfaction with pain medication. 
Methodology:    
This is a Phase 3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study evaluating the  
safety and efficacy of preoperative dosing with N1539 30 mg in adult subjects undergoing open or laparoscopic colorectal surgery.   The initial study cohort will enroll approxim ately 50 subjects 
randomized (1:1) to N1539 30 mg or placebo; additional study cohorts may be enrolled following review of initial study observations. 
Adult subjects, a ge 18  to 80 years inclusive, scheduled to undergo colorectal surgery that is expected 
to result in inpatient hospitalization for at least 48 -72 hours, will be screened for participation at up to 
20 study site s in the United States.  Screening will occur  within 28 days before study drug 
administration.  After signing the informed consent , medi cal history, physical examination, laboratory 
testing, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), pregnancy testing, and vital sign measurements will be 
completed during the screening visit. 
Study sites will follow an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol pre-, peri-, and 
postoperatively (see  Appendix C.1 ).  On the day of surgery ( DOS; Day 1), subject s will be evaluated 
to ensure they remain eligible for participation in the study .  Subjects with confirmed eligibility  will 
be stratified by incision type (op en vs laparoscopic) and randomized to either N1539 30 mg or placebo 
treatment within 12 hours prior to surgery and will be administered the first dose of study drug 
approximately 30 minutes prior to the start of surgery (defined as time of first incision).  The start time 
of first dose of study drug administration  (Dose 1)  will be used to schedule subsequent doses.  
Following surgery (end of surgery defined as the time of last suture; referenced as Hour 0), subjects 
will receive a standardized care regimen per the specified ERAS protocol, including rescue analgesia, 
mobilization, and diet advancing guidelines (see  Appendix C.1 ).  Subjects will continue to receive 
study drug every 24 -hours from Dose 1 so long as IV analgesia is clinically appropriate or until 
discharge, whichever comes first. Subjects will stay at the study center for at least 48 -72 hours after 
surgery or so long as inpatient care is clinically appropriate .  A final dose of study drug  may be 
administered up to 4 hours early in subjects who are scheduled to be discharged.  Subjects who do not 
receive a dose of study drug for >  28 hours following their previous dose of study drug should be 
considered off treatment, and s hould not receive further doses of study drug.

Subjects may be di scharged fro m the study center based on their clinical status, with safety assessments 
performed at the earlier of 1 day (24 hours) following their last study dose (LSD+1) or at the time of discharge.  Subjects will be provided standard of care analgesic regimen  for p ain management after 
discharge from the study center . 
All treated  subjects will be followed through 30 days after discharge .  All subjects will return to the 
study center to complete  follow -up visit 1 (FUV-1) at 5-21 days post-discharge, with follow- up vis it 2 
(FUV -2) completed by telephone 30 days post- discharge. 
Safety assessments will include m onitoring of AEs, wound healing assessment, vital signs, and clinical 
laboratory tests. 
Assessments of efficacy will include total opioid consumption, pain intensity according to an 11-point 
numeric pain rating scale (NPRS; 0 - 10) on first ambulation, time to first analgesic rescue, time to 
return of bowel function (including time to first flatus or bowel sounds, and first bowel movement), 
time to mobilization ( including time to first assisted mobilization out of hospital bed and time to first 
independent mobilization out of hospital bed), patient global assessment of pain control, brief pain inventory, subject satisfaction, time to hospital discharge (including time to hospital discharge order 
written and time to actual hospital departure), incidence of nasogastric (NG) tube insertion, length of stay, incidence of hospital readmission post initial discharge, and total cost of hospitalization. 
Number of subje cts to be enrolled :  The initial study cohort is planned to enroll approximately 50 
subjects; 25 subjects to be randomized to placebo, and 25 subjects to be randomized to N1539 30 mg.  Additional study cohorts may be enrolled following review of initial study observations.

Statistical methods:  
Sample size determination :  The initial sample size of 50 subjects was selected empirically without a 
formal power calculation.  
An unblinded data review will be performed after approximately 40-50 subjects are enrolled and have 
completed study assessments through initial hospital discharge. An independent statistician will 
perform the analysis.   Details will be discussed in the analysis plan to be prepared for this study. 
Following enrollment and review of this initial c ohort, if study data warrant, additional subject cohorts 
may be enrolled to further evaluate safety in this setting, or may explore other endpoints. 
Study populations :   
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set: The ITT set will include all eligible subjects  who were  randomized.  
The ITT subjects may or may not receive randomized treatment  and may or may not have the 
scheduled surgery .  
Safety Analysis Set:  The safety analysis set will include all subjects trea ted with study drug.  
Efficacy Analysis Set: The efficacy analysis set will include all subjects in the safety analysis set who 
underwent the scheduled surgery and had NG tube removed prior to Hour 24.   Safety analysis
:  The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (Version  20 or higher) will be us ed 
to classify all AEs with respect to system organ class and preferred term.  A Es will be summarized for 
by treatment group.  Changes in vital signs and clinical laboratory tests at each post dosing time point 
will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics without formal statistical tests.  The 
number and proportion of subjects with abnormal wound healing observations will be summarized at 
each time point by treatment group.    
Efficacy  analysis :  Efficacy parameters will be summarized for each study treatment.  Difference 
between the groups will be evaluated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) models that include main effect of treatment and investigational sites for all continuous variables; Cox proportional hazards 
analysis will be used to evaluate treatment effect in time to event parameters; and the Cochran -Mantel -
Haenszel  analysis controlling for investigational sites will be used to assess the differences in groups 
for the categorical parameters.

30 August 2017  1. INTRODUCTION 
Since the year 2000, when the Joint Commission revised their standards for the assessment and 
management of pain, the treatment of pain has taken an increasingly significant position in 
medical care.  Often referred to as the “fifth vital sign”, subjects must now be routinely evaluated 
for pain symptoms so that therapy may be appropriately adjusted. 
While this increased focus has brought more attention to the issue of subject  comfort and quality 
of life, our range of tools has remained largely the same.  Current medications run the gamut in 
duration of activity, ranging from acute medications that provide relief for 1 -2 hours, to 
alternative formulations which can provide as much as 72 hours of analgesia.  At the same time, these dosage forms commonly rely on a similar set of active ingredients, which often work through the same opioid pathway to provide relief (morphine, oxycodone, fentanyl) 
(Swarm,  2007).  The result, while there is generally not a ceiling on the effect provided by opiate 
medications, the use of high doses, and multiple opiate medications may lead to an increased 
occurrence of adverse events, which may force a decision between symptoms and side effects  
N1539 was initially developed as  an injectable form of meloxicam for the short- term 
management of moderate to severe acute pain using proprietary NanoCrystal
® technology.  
N1539 was acquired by Recro Pharma, Inc. (Recro) in April 2015, at which time, Recro assumed its development. 
Meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the enolic acid class that 
possesses anti -inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activities, which are believed to be 
related to the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)  and subsequent reduction in prostaglandin 
biosynthesis (Turck, 1997; Del Tacca, 2002; Mobic 2016).  
Meloxicam has been marketed for over a decade as the oral agent, Mobic.  Mobic tablets and 
suspension are indicated for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis and rheumatoid 
arthritis and the relief of the signs and symptoms of pauciarticular or polyarticular course juvenile rheumatoid arthritis in patients 2 ye ars or older.    
Meloxicam has a slow onset of action, largely due to poor water solubility, and is not currently 
approved for the treatment of acute pain.  It has a prolonged absorption, with the time of maximum observed plasma concentration (t
max) being approximately 5 -6 hours following oral 
administration (Degner,  1997; Turck,  1997), which is consistent with its poor aqueous solubility.  
By increasing the dissolution rate of the active meloxicam moiety, the proprietary NanoCrystal 
technology should provi de a faster onset of action of meloxicam, thus providing a suitable 
treatment of acute pain via the intravenous (IV) route  
Prior evaluations of N1539 have included postoperative dosing, before and after the onset of pain symptoms.  While administration of N1539 postoperatively has been well tolerated with a 
favorable safety and efficacy profile.  It is unknown whether any differences in surgical outcome or hospitalization course may be evident following preoperative dosing, where the use of N1539 could further reduce the requirement for opioid analgesia.  This study is designed to evaluate the 
safety  and efficacy of preoperative dosing with N1539 in subjects undergoing open or 
laparoscopic colorectal surgery , prior to expanding into larger subject enrollment.     
See the N1539 Investigator’s Brochure for more information about the compound.

The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of preoperative 
dosing of N1539 30 mg in subjects undergoing colorectal surg ery, including clinical laboratory 
tests, wound healing evaluation, incidence of anastomotic leaks, and incidence of Adverse 
Events (AEs) and Serious AEs (SAEs).  
Additional objectives include: 
• Evaluation of N1539 treatment impact on overall postoperative recovery course, 
including total opioid consumption, length of hospital stay, pain control, cost of hospital 
stay, return of bowel function, mobilization, and satisfaction with pain medication.

3.1. Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  3b, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter study evaluating 
the safety and efficacy of preoperative dosing with N1539 30 mg in adult subjects undergoing 
open or laparoscopic colorectal surgery.  The initial study cohort will enroll approxima tely 
50 subjects randomized (1:1) to N1539 30 mg or placebo; additional study cohorts may be 
enrolled following review of initial study observations. 
Adult subjects, age 18 to 80 years inclusive , scheduled to undergo colorectal surgery that is 
expected to result in inpatient hospitalization for at least 48 -72 hours, will be screened for 
participation at up to 20 study site s in the United States.  Screening will occur  within 28 days 
before study drug administration.  After signing the informed consent, medical history, physical 
examination, laboratory testing, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), pregnancy testing, and vital sign measurements  will be completed during the screening visit. 
Study sites will follow an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol pre -, peri -, and 
postoperatively (see Appendix C.1).  On the day of surgery ( DOS; Day 1), subject s will be 
evaluated to ensure they remain eligible for participation in the study .  Subjects with confirmed 
eligibility  will be stratified by incision type (open vs laparoscopic) and randomized  to either 
N1539 30 mg or placebo treatment within 12 hours prior to surgery and will be administered the 
first dose of study drug approximately 30 minutes prior to the start of surgery (defi ned as time of 
first incision).  The start time of first dose of study drug administration  (Dose 1) will be used to 
schedule subsequent doses.  
Following surgery (end of surgery defined as the time of last suture; referenced as Hour 0), 
subjects will receive a standardized care regimen per the specified ERAS protocol, including 
rescue analgesia, mobilization, and diet advancing guidelines (see Appendix C.1) .  Subjects will 
continue to receive study drug every 24 -hours from Dose 1 so long as IV analgesia is clinically 
appropriate or until discharge, whichever comes first.  Subjects  will stay at the study center for at 
least 48 -72 hours after surgery or so long as inpatient care is clinically appropriate.  A final dose 
of study drug may be administered up to 4 hours early in subjects who are scheduled to be discharged.   Subjects who do not receive a dose of study drug for >  28 hours following their 
previous dose of study drug should be considered off treatment, and should not receive further 
doses of study d rug.   
Subjects may be discharged from the study center based on their clinical status, with safety 
assessments performed at the earlier of 1 day (24 hours) following their last study dose (LSD+1) or at the time of discharge.  Subjects will be provided standard of care analgesic regimen  for pain 
management after discharge from the study center . 
All treated  subjects will be followed through 30 days after discharge.  A ll subjects will return to 
the study center to complete follow-up visit 1 (FUV- 1) at 5 -21 days post- discharge, with follow-
up visit 2 (FUV-2) completed by telephone 30 days post- discharge. 
Safety assessments  will include monitoring of AEs, wound healing assessment, vital signs, and 
clinical laboratory tests . 
Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-024 Amendment 002 
CONFIDENTIAL  22 
30 August 2017  Assessments of efficacy will includ e total opioid consumption, pain intensity according to an 
11-point numeric pain rating scale (NPRS; 0 - 10) on first ambulation , time to first analgesic 
rescue, time to return of bowel function (including time to first flatus or bowel sounds, and first 
bowel movement), time to mobilization (including time to first assisted mobilization out of 
hospital bed and time to first independent mobilization out of hospital bed), patient global 
assessment of pain control, brief pain inventory, subject satisfaction, time to hospital discharge 
(including time to hospital discharge order written and time to actual hospital departure), 
incidence of  nasogastric ( NG) tube insertion, length of stay, incidence of hospital readmission 
post initial discharge, and  total cost of hospitalization.  
3.2. Rationale for Study Design and Control Groups 
This study will evaluate the safety  and efficacy  of repeated dosing with N1539 with  the first dose 
of N1539 administered prior to colorectal surgery.   Previous research has demonstrated the 
safety  and efficacy  of single and repeated doses of N1539 administered after surgery in a range 
of postoperative populations, including open hysterectomy, bunionectomy, and abdominoplasty, 
along with a range o f majo r surgeries including orthopedic and abdominal surgeries.   
This study will further explore the safety and efficacy of N1539 when administered 
preoperatively  on a once daily schedule, in a population of subjects undergoing colorectal 
surgery.  Preoperative dosing is anticipated to reduce the need for postoperative opioid analgesics, thereby improving the postoperative recovery course as evidenced by length of stay, return of bowel function, and pain control satisfaction.  However, it is unknown whether 
preoperative dosing may have other consequences on the safety of treated subjects.  The 
inclusion of a placebo control group will support the comparison of safety results observed in 
N1539 treated subjects. 
As the first preoperative evaluation of N1539, this s tudy will initially enroll a limited cohort of 
approximately 50 subjects.   Following review of observations in the initial cohort, additional 
cohorts may be enrolled in this study to further evaluate the safety of N1539 in this setting, or to 
evaluate othe r endpoints.  Appropriate IRB approval will be obtained before enrolling additional 
cohorts in this study beyond the proposed initial cohort.

5.1. Surgical Procedure and Perioperative Care  
On Day 1, day of surgery, subjects will undergo colorectal  surgery.  Disallowed surgical 
procedures for inclusion in this study include repeat procedures or re-resections, resections 
beyond the peritoneal reflection, surgeries associated with acute bouts of diverticulitis, and 
surgeries associated with an emergency procedure.  
Surgeries should be completed using an appropriate anesthesia and analgesic regimen per the 
clinical practice of the surgeon within the guidelines of the study ERAS ( Appendix C.1).  
Disallowed medications are described in Section  5.12. 
Venous thromboembolism prophylaxis before and after surgery will be administered according 
to standard practice, based on the subject’s  individual needs, and at the discretion  of the 
investigator and surgeon, taking into consideration known drug interactions and 
contraindications with NSAIDs.   
Time of surgery start (time of first incision) and end of surgery (time of last suture; Hour 0) will 
be captured in the eCRF.  
5.2. Administration of Study Medication  
Appropriately qualified s tudy personnel will prepare all doses of study drug accord ing to the 
treatment schedule, for administration in this study .  Additional details on study dose preparation 
and administration will be provided in the study specific pharmacy manual. 
All doses of study drug will be administered as an IV bolus over approximately  15 seconds.  
Start time of IV p ush should be recorded in the subject’s eCRF.   
Each subject is expected to receive at least two doses of study drug  during their participation in 
the study.  Randomized subjects will receive their f irst dose of study drug (Dose 1) 
approximately 30 minutes prior to the start of surgery.  Additional doses of study drug will be 
administered every 24±1  hours from Dose 1  until discharge  or until IV analgesia is no longer 
clinically appropriate, whichever is first .  A final dose of study drug may be administered up to 4 
hours early in subjects who are scheduled to be discharged.     
5.3. Identity of Study Medication  
N1539 will contain 30 mg meloxicam in each 1  mL of solution, as well as excipients including: 
povidone, sodium deoxycholate (deoxycholic acid), sucrose, and water for injection. 
Placebo will contain :  soybean oil, egg y olk phospholipids, g lycerin , fluorescein sodium, sodium 
folate , edetate disodium, benzyl alcohol, polysorbate 80, dextrose and water for injection.  
Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may be used for pH adjustment. 
5.4. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
A computer-generated randomization scheme will be prepared prior to study initiation.  Eligible 
subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio  to IV treatment with N1539 30 mg or placebo.  A 
block randomization will be generated stratified by center  and planned incision type (open vs. 
Recro Pharma, Inc.

CONFIDENTIAL  27 
30 August 2017  laparoscopic).  Investigators and site staff will not be aware of the size of the block.  All doses of 
study drug administered will be according to the original assignment.  
5.5. Selection of Doses  
Doses of N1539 have been selected following review of safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic 
data from 11 previous clinical studies.  Clinical studies have evaluated doses of N1539 ranging 
from 5 to 180 mg.  Findings in the Phase 2 program for N1539 supported the use of a 30 mg dose 
administered via IV push once daily (every 24 hours).  These findings were verified in two well 
controlled Phase 3 studies of N1539 30 mg administered to subjects with moderate to severe pain 
following bunionectomy and abdominoplasty surgeries.  Both studies demonstrated a significant 
effect of N1539 30 mg for pain reduction compared with placebo.  The safety of N1539 30 mg has been further evaluated in a 721 subject, placebo controlled postoperative safety study where dosing with N1539 30 mg was observed to have a similar safety profile with placebo. 
The current study has been planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy of preoperative dosing 
with N1539 30 mg in a repeated dose setting compared with placebo.     
5.6. Selection of Timing of Dose  
Randomized subjects will be administered doses of study drug every 24 hours.  This interval has 
been demonstrated to maintain analgesia  throughout the dosing interval in a range of Phase 2 and 
3 clinical studies .  The 24 -hour dosing interval has been selected based on the pain relief and 
pharmacokinetic profile of N1539 established in previous clinical studies.  Administration of the 
first dose of study drug prior to the surgical procedure will be evaluated to determine its effect on 
postoperative outcomes.  The start time each dose is administered will be recorded in the 
subject’s eCRF.   
5.7. Blinding and Unblinding of Study Medications  
All doses of study drug will be prepared by an appropriately qualified member (s) of the 
healthcare team at the research center, for administration according to the subject’s 
randomization.   
Doses of study drug will be administered by staff members who will be blinded to the treatment 
assignment.  
The study blind may be broken only if the safety of a subject is at risk and the treatment plan for 
that subject depends on which study medication he or she received.  Unless the subject is at 
immediate risk, the investigator must make diligent attempts to contact the sponsor before unblinding the subject’s data.   
If a subject’s  data are unblinded without the prior knowledge of the sponsor, the investigator 
must notify the sponsor as soon as possible and no later than the next business morning.  All 
circumstances surrounding a premature unblinding must be clearly documented. 
5.8. Treatment Compliance  
Blinded s tudy personnel will administer each dose of study medication.  The exact date and time 
each dose is  administered will be recorded in the subject’s e CRF .

The investigator (or designee) will sign for the study medications when they are received.  The 
study medication must be handled and stored as described and dispensed only to those subjects 
formally entered into the study. 
At the completion of the study, and after reconciliation of all delivery and usage records, any 
unused study medication supplied by the sponsor  will be returned to the sponsor (or designee) or 
destroyed per written instructions from the sponsor. 
5.10. Packaging, Labeling, and Storage  
Study medication  will be provided in study labeled packaging for preparation for use in this 
study. 
N1539 will be provided in single use vials containing 30 mg per mL .   
Placebo will be  provided in single use vials. 
Directions for preparation of study medication will be provided as pharmacy instructions prior to 
initiation of the study .

range of 15ºC to 30ºC (59ºF to 86ºF) will be permitted.  Study medication should be protected from light.  
All study medication  at the study site(s)  should be stored in a locked area with restricted access.  
A temperature log or chart  should be maintained to monitor the environment at the study site . 
5.11. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All medications and other treatments taken by subjects within 5 days before the first dose of 
study drug and dur ing the study will be recorded i n the e CRF . 
All medications  that have not been at a stable dose for at least 14 days prior to the scheduled 
procedure will be prohibited within five half -lives of the specific prior medication (or, if half- life 
is unknown, within 48 hours) before the surgical proced ure, with exception of medications 
utilized for surgical preparation . 
5.12. Prohibited Medications  
The following medications or drug classes will be prohibited  during the study: 
• Any NSAIDs  other than study drug (ketorolac, ibuprofen, diclofenac, etc. ) are prohibited

completion of surgical closure. 
A schedule of study procedures for overall study assessments and day-of- dosing assessments is 
provided in Appendix A . 
6.1. Demographic and Efficacy Assessment  
6.1.1. Demographics  
Demographics information will be collected during screening visit including age, sex, ethnicity,  
race, weight, height,  and BMI . 
6.1.2. Medical History  
The investigator or designee will document each subject’s medical history during the screening 
visit.  Medical history will be updated on Day 1 when the subject reports for surgery , and the 
subject will be reviewed to confirm that they continue to meet the required  study inclusion and 
exclusion criteria.  
6.1.3. Physical Examination 
The investigator or designee will perform a physical examination (HEENT, cardiovascular, 
respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological , dermatologic,  and musculoskeletal systems)  during the 
screening visit, at check -in on Day 1, and at LSD+1.  Physical examination results collected 
within 7 days prior to the screening visit may be utilized to evaluate subject eligibility  at 
screening.  Body weight and height will be measured, and B MI will be calculated during the 
screening visit  only.   
The study Investigator may perform a physical examination (the extent of which is determined 
by the study investigator) at any time during the study if indicated by change in a subject’s 
medical history or condition. 
6.1.4. Surgical Information 
Information on the surgical procedure, including time of start and end of surgery, time into and 
out of recovery room, planned and actual incision type (open, laparoscopic, or laparoscopic 
converted to open ), incision  length , and any surgical complications will be recorded in the 
subject eCRF.   Surgery procedures will be grouped into surgery types for the purpose of 
analysis.  
6.1.5. Concomitant Medications and Opioid Use  
All medications utilized during the study will be captured as concomitant medications.  Opioid analgesics used from Hour 0 to discharge will be the primary efficacy endpoint and the dose of 
each opioid medication will be converted into their IV morphine equivalent dose (IVMED) for the total opioid consumption analysis.  Hence, each opioid medication used from Hour 0 to 
discharge will be captured separately in the eCRF .

PI will be assessed by the study subject for their current pain according to an 11-point numeric 
pain rating scale ( NPRS; 0 - 10) where 0 equates to no pain, and 10 equates to the worst pain 
imaginable , as described in Appendix C.2. 
PI will be assessed within 15 minut es prior to first ambulation.  Subjects will also utilize the 
NPRS to assess their worst pain intensity experienced during their first ambulation.   
6.1.7. Cost of Hospitalization  
Cost of hospitalization will be determined using UB -04 and/or similar hospital claim forms used 
for billing purposes.  Cost of hospitalization will be determined from the billing codes and/or procedure codes for all hospital care from the time of hospital admission until discharge. 
When available, hospital costs resulting from hospital readmissions during the follow-up period should be collected. 
6.1.8. Time  to Event s  
Following surgery, subjects will be questioned regarding the occurrence of first flatus and bowel 
movements, and study staff will be asked to document the first observed bowel sounds.  The 
times that these events first occur following the end of surgery  (Hour 0) will be recorded .  
Time to rescue analgesia use will be determined from the first recorded time of opioid analgesic 
use in the subject’s medical record, beginning after surgery. 
Times to event pertaining to hospital discharge will include time that hospital discharge order 
was written or when discharge readiness was recorded in the subject chart, and actual  departure 
time of hospital. 
Mobilization will be attempted per the postoperative schedule defined in the ERAS  
(Appendix C.1: ).  Study staff will be asked to document the time of first successful postoperative 
mobilization s in the subject eCRF , including first assisted mobilization out of hospital bed, and 
first independent mobilization out of hospital bed. 
6.1.9. Patient Global Assessment (PGA) of Pain Control  
Subjects will be asked to evaluate their pain control during the preceding period according to the 
following scale: 0 -poor, 1- fair, 2 -good, 3-very good, or 4- excellent” (See Appendix C.3) . 
The PGA of pain control will be completed at Hour 24 (± 2 hours) from Hour 0 , every 24 hours 
(± 2 hours) thereafter until LSD+1 (Hour 48, Hour 72, etc.), and at LSD+1  (± 2 hours). 
6.1.10. Brief Pain Inventory

hours thereafter (± 2 hours) until LSD+1 , and at  LSD+1  (± 2 hours). 
6.1.11. Subject Satisfaction with  Postoperative Pain Medication 
Subjects will report their satisfaction with the medication they received to manage their  
postoperative pain according to a 7 -point Likert scale including categories of: completely 
dissatisfied ( 1), mostly dissatisfied ( 2), somewhat dissatisfied ( 3), neither satisfied to dissatisfied 
(4), somewhat satisfied ( 5), mostly satisfied 6), and completely satisfied ( 7) (see Appendix C.4).   
The subject assessment of satisfaction will be assessed at LSD+1 . 
6.1.12. Postoperative NG Tube I nsertion  
All NG tubes inserted pre- or peri operatively should be removed at or before Hour 24.  Any NG 
tube inserted  postoperatively will be recorded in the eCRF , along with time of insertion where 
appropriate.  
6.1.13. Hospital Readmission  
Following discharge, subjects will be asked to report any hospital readmissions to the study staff.  
Subjects will be questioned regarding any hospital readmissions during FUV-2.  
6.2. Safety Assessments Description  
6.2.1. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
During the screening visit, on Day 1 during check -in, and  at LSD+1, subjects will have blood 
and urine samples collected for routine clinical laboratory testing .  Screening laboratory tests will 
be performed at a local laboratory; historic laboratory results collecte d within 7 days prior to the 
screening visit may be utilized for subject eligibility evaluation at screening visit.  Laboratory 
tests on Day 1 and at LSD+1 should be performed at the central laboratory.  Laboratory tests to 
be performed include:

6.2.2. Vital Sign Measurements  
Resting vital signs will include blood pressure, pulse, and peripheral oxygen saturation  (SpO2 ), 
should be collected at the screening visit, at check -in prior to surgery on Day 1, and at LSD+1 .  
Resting tests must be obtained after resting (seated/supine) for ≥ 5 minutes.  Historic  vital signs 
results collected within 7 days prior to the screening visit may be utilized for subject eligibility evaluation at screening visit.  
Additional vital signs may be collected during the study according to standard practice and clinical status.  Any clinically significant changes in vital signs after study drug treatment should 
be captured as AEs  at the discretion of the investigator. 
6.2.3. 12-Lead Electrocardiogram  (ECG)  
A 12 -lead ECG will be complete d for all subjects at screening .  Historic  ECG results collected 
within 7 days prior to the screening vis it may be utilized for evaluation of subject eligibility; 12-
lead ECG will be used to exclude subjects with a  clinically significant abnormal ECG . 
6.2.4. Wound Evaluation 
Surgical wound healing will be evaluated by the investigator at time of discharge  and at FUV -1 
to determine whether healing is following a normal course in the opinion of the investigator.  The investigator will evaluate the healing of the wound using an 11- point scale (0 -10) where a 
score of 0 is “Completely unsatisfied”, and a score of 10 is “Completely satisfied”.   
6.2.5. Anastomotic  Leaks

30 August 2017  7. ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meet ing the criteria 
and definition of an adverse event (AE) or serious adverse event (SAE) as provided in this 
protocol.  During the study, when there is a safety evaluation, the investigator or site staff will be responsible for detecting AEs and SAEs, as detailed in this section of the protocol. 
7.1. Definition of an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related. 
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered causally associated with the use of the study drug. Any abnormal laboratory value 
deemed clinically significant b y the investigator, regardless of causal relationship, must be 
reported as an AE.  
Examples of an AE include the following: 
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or indication under 
study 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including either an increase in frequency or intensity of the condition (eg, abnormal physical examination 
finding) 
• Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction 
• Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study drug or a 
concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an AE or SAE, unless 
nonserious or serious sequelae occur) 
The following examples are not considered AEs: 
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE 
• Anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) (including 
laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen  
• The diseas e or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of the 
disease or disorder being studied, unless they become more severe or occur with a greater 
frequency than expected for the subject’s condition  
All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination, and regardless of 
causality, will be assessed and recorded in the eCRF beginning after administration of study drug 
through end of the study (ie, Day 30).   
7.2. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
A SAE is defined as any event that meets the following criteria:  
• Results in death  
Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-024 Amendment 002 
CONFIDENTIAL  38 
30 August 2017  • Is immediately life -threatening (ie, presents an immediate risk of death from the event as 
it occurred; this does not include an AE had it occurred in a more serious form may have 
caused death).   
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
perform normal life functions.   
• Results in hospitalization.  
•  Results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization. 
•  Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in  the offspring of a subject using the study drug 
regardless of time to diagnosis). 
•  Is considered an important medical event. 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an AE is serious 
when considering important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes listed that define a SAE. Examples of such 
medical even ts that may also be considered serious include, but are not limited to, intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization. 
Hospitalization for elective trea tment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline does not meet the definition of a SAE. Social or convenience admission to a hospital or prolongation of a hospitalization for social or 
convenience reasons not associated with the occurrence of an AE does not meet the definition of a SAE.  
SAEs will be assessed and recorded in the eCRF after the signing of informed consent through the end of the study ( ie, Day 30). If an investigator becomes aware of a SAE or death that occurs 
more than 30 days after the subject receives study drug and the investigator considers the event to be related to the study drug, he/she is obligated to report the SAE to the sponsor. 
7.3. Recordin g and Evaluating Adverse Events and Serious Adverse 
Events  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, symptoms, or other clinical information. In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs or symptoms, should be documented as the AE or SAE. 
7.3.1. Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported during the 
study, using his or her clinical judgment. The intensity of each AE and SAE recorded in the eCRF  should be assigned to one of the following categories: 
• Mild: an event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causes minimal discomfort, and does 
not interfere with everyday activities  
Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-024 Amendment 002 
CONFIDENTIAL  39 
30 August 2017  • Moderate: an event that is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday 
activities  
• Severe:  an event that prevents normal everyday activities  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with a SAE. Severity is a term used to describe the intensity of a specific event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. The 
event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe headache). This is not the same as serious, which is based on the subject’s or event’s outcome or 
on action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or 
functioning (see Section  7.2). 
7.3.2. Assessment of Causality  
The investigator must record the causal relat ionship of each event  in the eCRF, and additionally 
for SAEs, on the SAE reporting form .  An investigator's causality assessment is the 
determinatio n of whether there exists a reasonable possibility that the study drug caused or 
contributed to an AE .  
• Related: There is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and 
the AE.   
• Not related: The AE  is due to underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another drug or 
event and is not related to the study drug (eg, has a more likely alternate etiology and / or a temporal relationship does not suggest a causal relationship).   
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for the initial SAE report, it is 
important that the investigator always make an assessment of causality for every event before 
transmitting the SAE reporting form and completing the AE eCRF page(s). The causality 
assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting requirements. The 
investigator may change his or her opinion of causal ity in light of follow -up information and 
amend the SAE reporting form and AE eCRF page(s) accordingly. 
7.3.3. Assessment of Outcome  
All AEs and SAEs must be followed until they are resolved, the condition stabilizes, the events 
are otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. The investigator will assess the 
outcome of the event(s) by using the following terms:  
• Resolved:  The event resolved and the subject returned to baseline.  
• Resolving:  At last observation, the event was improving. 
• Resolved with sequelae:  The event resolved but the subject is left with residual problems (eg, functional deficits)  
• Not resolved: At the last observation, the event was unchanged.  
• Unknown:  There were no observations after the onset (initial observation or report) of the event, and the status of the event is unknown. 
• Death ( Fatal) :  To be selected for the one AE, which in the judgement of the investigator 
was the primary  cause of death.

CONFIDENTIAL  40 
30 August 2017  7.4. Follow -up of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events  
After the occurrence of an  AE or SAE, the investigator is required to follow each subject 
proactively and provide further information on the subject’s condition. All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit or contact that are designated as ongoing will be reviewed at subsequent visits or contacts  until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is 
otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up. Any additional events that are relevant to the ongoing event will be documented. 
The investigator will ensure that follow -up information relevant to SAEs is provided to the 
sponsor and includes results of any additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathologic 
examinations, or consultations with other healthcare professionals that serve to clarify the n ature 
of the event, the cause of the event, or both. 
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed SAE reporting form 
and entered into the eCRF pages, with all changes signed and dated by the investigator. The updated SAE reporting form should be resubmitted to the sponsor within the time frames outlined in Section 7.5. 
7.5. Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor 
Once the investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE, he or she must notify the sponsor within 24 hours. 
ANY SAE OR ANY OUTCOME OF DEATH DUE TO ANY CAUSE, WHICH OCCURS 
DURING THE COURSE OF THIS STUDY, REGARDLESS OF RELAT IONSHIP TO 
STUDY DRUG, MUST BE REPORTED TO THE SPONSOR IMMEDIATELY (within 24 
hours).  
COMPLETE THE SAE DETAILS REPORTING FORM AND FORWARD BY eMAIL TO THE FOLLOWING SPONSOR CONTACT : 
 
Medical Safety Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Telephone: 484 -395-2470 
eFax: 484-395-2472 
eMail: AE@recropharma.com
 
 
In the initial eMail, the investigator must provide to the sponsor the following eCRF pages, completed to the greatest extent possible:  
• AE record  
• Medical history  
• Prior and concomitant medications  
Also, the following documents are to be forwarded: any laboratory results, diagnostic test results, or medical reports relevant to the SAE.  
E-mail transmission is the preferred method to transmit SAE information. In rare circumstances 
and in the absence of e- mail capacity, notification by fax or telephone is acceptable, with a copy 
Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-024 Amendment 002 
CONFIDENTIAL  41 
30 August 2017  of the SAE reporting form sent by overnight mail. Initial notification via telephone does not 
replace the need for the investigator to complete the SAE reporting form and eCRF pages within 
the time frames outlined.  
If the investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he or she must not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the sponsor of the event. The form must be 
updated when additional information is received. Follow -up information received on all SAEs 
must be forwarded to the sponsor by using the same procedure and timelines as for an initial report.  
7.6. Regulatory Reporting Requirements 
The investigator must promptly report all SAEs to the sponsor in accordance with the procedures detailed in Section  7.5 “Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor.” The 
sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the investigator to the appropriate project contact for SAE receipt is 
essential so that SAEs that are either unexpected or observed with increasing occurrence, be 
reported and legal obligations and ethical responsibilities regarding the safety of other subjects are met.  
For the purposes of IND safety reporting, expectedness of t he SAE will be assessed by the 
sponsor.  A SAE is considered unexpected if it is not listed in the investigator brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator brochure is not 
required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
The s ponsor will determine whether the SAE meets regulatory reporting criteria (ie, 7 - or 15 -day 
repor t) in compliance with local and regional law. If so, the sponsor (or the sponsor’s 
representative) will report the event to the appropriate regulatory authoritie s. The sponsor will 
report SAEs to the central IRB/EC and the investigator will be report SAE to their local to 
institutional review board (IRB) /EC. Investigator letters are prepared according to sponsor policy 
and are forwarded to the investigators as necessary. An investigator letter is prepared for any 
SAE that is attributable to study drug, serious, and unexpected. The purpose of the investigator 
letter is to fulfill specific regulatory and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements regarding 
the product under investigation. 
The investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply with 
requirements related to the reportin g of SAEs to the IRB or IEC. 
7.7. Special Reporting Situations: Pregnancy  
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must discontinue further study drug administration and should be followed through delivery or termination of the pregnancy.  A subject s hould be instructed to also notify the investigator immediately if she becomes pregnant 
within 30 days after receiving study drug.  The sponsor must be notified of all pregnancies reported to the investigator (see Section 7.5 for contact information). 
Any uncomplicated pregnancy that occurs in a subject during this clinical study will be reported 
for tracking purposes only. All subject pregnancies that are identified during or after this study, 
Recro Pharma, Inc.  
Protocol REC-17-024 Amendment 002 
CONFIDENTIAL  42 
30 August 2017  where the estimated date of conception is determined to have occurred within 30 days of 
receiving study drug need to be reported, followed to conclusion (delivery or termination), and 
the outcome reported, even if the subject is discontinued from the study. The investigator should report all pregnancies within 24 hours using the Pregnancy Report/Outcome Form, according to 
the usual timelines and directions for SAE reporting provided in Section 7.5. Monitoring of the 
pregnancy should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy; and follow- up detailing the 
outcome of the pregnancy submitted using the Pregnancy Re port/Outcome Form.  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that the investigational product under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. Likewise, elective abortions without complications are not considered AEs.  
Any SAEs associated with pregnancy (eg, congenital abnormalities/birth defects/spontaneous 
miscarriages or any other serious events) must additionally be reported as such using the SAE report form according to the usual timelines and directions for SAE reporting provided in 
Section  7.5.

30 August 2017  8. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY 
The following outlines some of the key elements of the data analys is approach.   A formal 
statistical analysis plan  (SAP)  will be developed for this study in which statistical models, data 
derivation methods and rules will be described in details.  A separate SAP will also be prepared 
for the planned interim analysis for this study.  
8.1. Determination of Sample Size  
The initial sample size of 50 subjects was selected empirically without a formal power 
calculation.  
An unblinded data review  will be performed after approximately 40-50 subjects are enrolled and 
have complet ed study assessments through initial hospital dischar ge.  An independent statistician 
will perform analysis.  Details will be discussed in the analysis plan to be prepared for this study. 
Following enrollment and review of this initial cohort, if study data warrant , additional cohorts 
may be enrolled  to further evaluate safety  in this setting,  or may to explore other endpoints.   
8.2. Study Endpoints  
8.2.1. Safety Endpoints  
The safety endpoints will include the following: 
1. Incidence of treatment- emergent AEs and SAEs (including AEs of interest and opioid 
related AEs)  
2. Incidence of anastomotic leaks  
3. Change from baseline in laboratory tests; incidence of abnormal clinical laboratory tests  
4. Change from baseline in vital signs 
5. Assessment of surgical  wound healing 
8.2.2. Efficacy Endpoints  
The efficacy endpoints will include:  
1. Total opioid consumption   
2. Time to hospital discharge order written  
3. Pain intensity on first ambulation

8.3. General Considerations for Statistical Analysis  
8.3.1. Analysis Datasets  
Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set:  The ITT set will include all eligible subjects who were 
randomized.  The ITT subjects may or may not receive randomized treatment  and may or may 
not have the scheduled surgery. 
Safety Set:  The safety set will include all treated subjects and will be used for safety and 
tolerability assessments.   
Efficacy analysis set will include all safety analysis set subjects who had the scheduled sur gery.  
Subjects whose surgery was  cancelled , whose surgery was changed will be excluded from the 
efficacy analysis , or who required NG tube use (placed perioperatively) beyond Hour 24.   
Efficacy analysis set will be the primary population  for efficacy evaluation, but additional 
sensitivity analysis may be performed based on the ITT analysis set.  
8.3.2. Test Hypothesis and P Value Justification 
Each efficacy analysis will be performed to assess the differences between the 2 treatment 
groups ; diffe rence will be derived by N1539 30 mg vs Placebo.     
The null hypothesis is that there is not difference between the examined treatment groups.  The alternative hypothesis is that the treatment groups are different.  Differences between  the 
2 groups will be evaluated via 2 -sided test s at the 0.05 level of significance.  
Nominal p -value will be reported as is .  
Details for study -wise Type 1 error control, including interim analyses, final co- primary efficacy 
endpoints analyses, and final secondary efficacy endpoints, will be discussed in the formal SAP. 
8.3.3. Procedures for Handling Missing Data  
Unless indicated otherwise (see Section 8.3.5), no imputation will be done for missing data.  
However, AEs with missing severity assessments will be tabulated as “severe,” and AEs with 
missing relationship assessments will be tabulated as “related” for the purpose of analysis; and 
the missing data will be presented in data listing as is.  
Recro Pharma, Inc.

measurements taken before the subject receives the first dose of study medication.  End of Study 
Visit will be the last follow -up (FUV -2) to be conducted 30 ±  4 days  post- discharge. 
8.3.5. Derived Variables  
Detailed rules to be used to derive various efficacy parameters will be documented in the 
statistical analysis plan, including method to compute time to events and censoring rules for time 
to event endpoints, imputation of partial/incomplete time of analgesic medications start and/or 
stop times , and computing scores for BPI at domain and sub-dimension level.    
8.4. Study Population Summaries  
Population summaries will be provided for the safety analysis set  included in this study. 
8.4.1. Disposition  
The summary tables will provide frequency counts for subject disposition (all treated subjects, 
subjects who completed the study, number and proportion of subjects who discontinued 
treatment; number and proportion of subjects who discontinued from the study, and reason for discontinuation of study drug treatment and reason for discontinuation of study ) by treatment 
group and study overall.   
Disposition in terms of number of subjects excluded from each analysis sets ( ITT, safety , 
efficacy ) will also be provided by treatment groups and study overall. 
8.4.2. Demographics and Surgical Characteristics  
The demographic summary will include descriptive statistics for age,  sex, race, weight, height, 
and BMI for the overall and by treatment group.

higher. 
8.5. Efficacy Analysis  
8.5.1. Total Opioid Consumption 
All concomitant medications will be coded according to WHO Drug library.  Opioid medications will be identified per ATC level 2 and level 3.  The dose from each identified opioid record will 
then be converted to IV Morphine Equivalent Dose (IVMED) in mg; examples of IVMED of 
some commonly used analgesics are provided in Table 1 . 
All analgesic medications will be mapped to the following time periods  based on the start 
date/time and stop date/time:  Hour 0 to discharge, Hour 0-24, Hour 0-48, Hour 24-48,  
Hour 0-72, an d Hour 48-72.   
Total opioid consumptions in IVMED (mg) per subject will be determined for each interval .  A 
summary table will be prepared to provide group descriptive statistics, including sample size, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maxim um.  Difference between treatment 
groups will be evaluated using an ANCOVA model that will include main effect of treatment and investigational site .  Nominal p-values will be reported as is.

5) Time to first bowel movement 
6) Time to first assisted mobilization  
7) Time to first independent mobilization  
Time to event endpoints will be derived for each subject.  Subjects without the event will be 
censored at time of last evaluation  during inpatient treatment phase .  Differences between the 
groups in time to event endpoints will be analyzed using the Cox proportional hazards analysis 
model that include the main effects of treatment and investigational sites; proportion of subjects 
censored will be presented and the time to event percentiles (25%, 50%, and 75% tiles) will be 
estimated.  The data will be graphically display using a Kaplan- Meier (KM) survival curve by 
treatment group .  
8.5.4. Length of Stay (LOS) 
Length of stay will be defined as days from the date of admissio n to the date of actual hospital 
discharge.  LOS will be tabulated with descriptive statistics by treatment groups and difference 
between the groups in the LOS will be evaluated using ANCOVA model that include main effect 
of treatment and investigational sites.     
8.5.5. PGA of Pain Control 
The n umber and percent of subjects in each global pain control category (0-poor, 1- fair, 2 -good, 
3-very good, or 4- excellent) will be tabulated by treatment group.  The difference between the 
groups in global pain control will be evaluated based  on proportion of subjects rating their pain 
control as good, very good, or excellent using the CMH  test controlling for investigational site .   
8.5.6. Brief Pain Inventory  
Responses to each BPI parameter will be tabulated at each time point by  treatment group , 
including score for each question (referred to as the item score), score for each domain (referred to as the domain score), and score for each subdomain (referred to as the sub-dimension score), 
change from baseline in item score, domain score, and sub-dimension score ( Cleeland 2009). 
Differences between the treatment groups in domain score, sub-dimension score, and item score, 
as well as change from baseline in scores will be analyzed by ANCOVA model that includes treatment and investigational sites, and baseline score as a covariate.     
8.5.7. Subject Satisfaction for Postoperative Pain Medication 
Subjects will be categorized as dissatisfied (completely dissatisfied [1], mostly dissatisfied [2], or somewhat dissatisfied [3]) , neither satisfied or dissatisfied (4), or satisfied (somewhat satisfied 
[5], mostly satisfied [6], or completely satisfied [7]) with postoperative pain medication .  The 
number and percent of subj ects in each category will be tabulated by treatment group.  The 
difference between t he groups in satisfaction with postoperative pain medication  will be

The incidence of all -cause hospital readmission will be reported during or prior to FUV -2.  
Hospital readmission will be summarized as the proportion  of subjects with at least one 
readmission within the follow -up period by treatment group.  If data permits causality of hospital 
readmission will also be examined .  Differences between the groups will be examined using 
Fisher’s exact test.  
8.5.10. Cost of Hospitalization  
Cost of hospitalization will be calculated using UB -04 and/or similar hospital claim forms used 
for billing purposes.  Cost of hospitalization will be the cost of all hospital care from the charge 
of hospital admission until discharge.  When available, hospital costs resulting from hospital 
readmissions during the follow-up period should be collected. 
Cost of hospitalization will be summarized by treatment group for the primary admission, and 
for all related readmissions if data are available.  
8.5.11. Exploratory Analysis:  Inflammatory  Markers  
Inflammatory markers will be analyzed for each collected sample.     
8.5.12. Subgroup Analyses for Efficacy  
Subgroups to be analyzed for efficacy may include: race, gender, age, and surgery type.  The 
analysis within a subgroup will follow the same analysis approach for the overall.  The subgroup 
analysis will focus on the primary efficacy endpoint total opioid use from Hour 0 to discharge ; 
subgroup analysis on secondary efficacy endpoint will be performed if data warr ants.  Potential 
covariates (such as incision type, surgery duration, and incision length) will be evaluated if data 
permits.   
8.6. Safety and Tolerability Evaluations

Part 50 (Protection of Human Subjects); US 21 CFR Part  56 (IRBs); US 21 CFR Part  54 
(Financial Disclosure); International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidance for Industry, E6 GCP: Consolidated Guidance; the Nuremberg Code; and, where applicable the principles of 
the Declaration of Helsinki (Recommendations guiding Medical Doctors in Biomedical Research 
Involving Human Subjects), and with the NH&MRC National Statement on Ethical Conduct in 
Human Research (2007).   
9.1.2.1. Ethics Committees  
The investigator (or sponsor, where applicable) is responsible for ensuring that this protocol, the 
site’s informed consent form, and any other information that will be presented to potential 
subjects (e.g., advertisements or information that supports or supplements the informed consent form) are reviewed and approved by the appropriate IRB or IEC.  The investigator agrees to 
allow the IRB or IEC direct access to all relevant documents.  The IRB or IEC must be 
constituted in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements.  The sponsor will provide the investigator with relevant documents or data needed for IRB or IEC review and approval of 
the study.  Before investigational products can be shipped to the site, the sponsor must receive 
copies of the IRB or IEC approval, the approved informed consent form, and any other information that the IRB or IEC has approved for presentation to potential subjects. 
If the protocol, the informed consent form, or any other information that the IRB or IEC has 
approved for presentation to potential subjects is amended during the study, the investigator is responsible for ensuring that the IRB or IEC reviews and approves, where applicable, these 
amended documents.  The investigator must follow all applicable regulatory requirements 
pertaining to the use of an amended informed consent form, including obtaining IRB or IEC 
approval of the amended form, before new subjects consent to take part in the study using the 
new version of the form.  The investigator must promptly forward to the sponsor copies of the 
IRB or IEC approval of the amended informed consent form or other information and the approved amended informed consent form or other information.  IRB or IEC approval of the 
consent forms must be obtained in addition to the approval given for the clinical study.  
Regulatory review and approval may be required in some countries before IRB or IEC approval can be sought.

CONFIDENTIAL  53 
30 August 2017  • Human subjects are provided with an adequate understanding of the possible risks of 
their participation in the study, and they have a free choice to participate or not. 
• The study is conducted with diligence and in conformance with the protocol in such a 
way as to ensure the integrity of the findings. 
• The potential benefits of the research justify the risks. 
Recro Pharma, Inc. is the sponsor of study REC -17-024.  The sponsor is responsible for all of the 
following: 
• selecting qualified investigators  
• providing investigators with the information they need to conduct the investigation 
properly

• ensuring that appropriate regulatory agencies and all participating investigators are 
properly informed of significant new information regardin g AEs or risks associated with 
N1539 
9.1.3. Informed Consent  
The sponsor will provide investigators with a sample informed consent form for this study.  
Investigators are encouraged to use the sample form; however, they may adapt the information to suit the needs of their institution, if necessary (although it must reflect the required elements of 
informed consent specified in 21 CFR Part 50.25).  The final informed consent form must be 
accepted by the sponsor and approved by the IRB or IEC.  Investigators must provide the sponsor with an unsigned copy of the final informed consent form before and after it is approved 
by the IRB or IEC.  If any new information becomes available that might affect subjects’ 
willingness to participate in the study, or if any amendments to the protocol require changes to the informed consent form, the sponsor will provide investigators with a revised informed 
consent form.  The IRB or IEC must provide written approval of any revisions to the informed 
consent form in advance of its use. 
Investigators must provide subjects with all the information necessary to make an informed 
decision about their participation in the study, including the nature and intended purpose of the 
study, possible benefits, and possible risks. 
All information in th e informed consent form should be provided in a language (whether written 
or spoken) that is as nontechnical as practical and that is understandable to the subjects. 
Before written informed consent is obtained, the subject should be given ample time and 
opportunity to inquire about the details of the study.  All questions must be answered to the satisfaction of the subject (or his or her legally authorized representative). 
Before a subject undergoes procedures specific to the protocol, the informed consent form must 
be signed and dated by the subject (or his or her legally authorized representative) and any other signatories as required by the IRB or IEC. 
If a subject (or legally authorized representative) cannot read, a short form approved by the IRB 
or IEC  may be used.  Only the short form itself is to be signed by the subject or the

and the person obtaining the consent shall sign the copy of the summary in accor dance with 
21 CFR  50.27 (b2).  
After all required signatures have been obtained, a copy of the informed consent form should be provided to the subject, and the original must be kept on file at the site and made available for 
review by the sponsor.  Documentation of the informed consent discussion must be noted in the subject’s case history.  
9.1.4. Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The investigator is responsible for completing and maintaining adequate and accurate eCRF s and 
source documentation.  Source documentation constitutes original records (first point of entry, either hard copy or electronic), which may include progress notes, medication administration records, operation reports, laboratory reports, discharge summaries, and so on.   
9.2. Study Monitoring  
The sponsor is responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the study with regard to subject protection, ethics, protocol adherence, site procedures, and integrity of the data.  At regular 
intervals during the study, the sponsor’s study monitors will contact the study site via visits to 
the site, telephone calls, and letters in order to review study progress and eCRF  completion and 
to address any concerns or questions regarding the study conduct.  During monitoring visits, the 
following aspects of study conduct will be carefully reviewed: subjects’ informed consent 
documents, subject recruitment procedures, subjects’ compliance with the study procedures, source-data verification, drug accountability, use of concomitant therapy by subjects, AE and SAE documentation and reporting, and quality of data. 
9.3. Quality Assurance  
The sponsor, a regulatory authority, or an IRB representative may visit the study site at any time during the study or after completion of the study to perform audits or inspections.  The purpose of a sponsor audit or regulatory inspection is to examine systematically and independently all 
study- related activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted 
according to the protocol, GCP, ICH guidelines, and any other applicable regulatory requirements.  Investigators should contact the sponsor immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an inspection at their site. 
9.4. Study and Site Closure  
If the sponsor, investigator, or officials from regulatory agencies discover conditions arising during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that the study site should be 
closed, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between the sponsor and 
investigator.  Conditions that may warrant terminatio n of the study include, but are not limited 
to, the following: 
• discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in the 
study

study monito r, or regulatory agencies 
• failure of the investigator to comply with GCP (e.g., ICH guidelines, regulatory agency guidelines) 
• insufficient adherence to protocol requirements or an unacceptably high rate of missing, erroneous, or improperly collected data 
• evidence from the blinded data of sufficient technical problems with the study that one 
could believe with a high degree of certainty that subjects are being exposed to the 
investigational drug without a realistic expectation of evaluable data  
• a decision on the part of the sponsor to suspend or discontinue testing evaluation or 
development of the product 
• failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable rate  
9.5. Records Retention  
9.5.1. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
The investigator agrees to comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to the privacy of subjects’ health information, including, but not limited to, 
the Standards for Individually Identifiable Health Information, 45 CFR Parts  160 and 164 (the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 privacy regulation).  The 
investigator shall ensure that study subjects authorize the use and disclosure of protected health 
information in accordance with the privacy regulations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and in a form satisfactory to the sponsor. 
9.5.2. Financial Disclosure  
Financial disclosure is required for this study. 
9.5.3. Access to Original Records  
Regulatory authorities expect that monitors, auditors, and representatives of national and 
international government regulatory agency bodies have access to original source documentation 
(see examples in Section  9.1.4) to ensure data integrity.  “Original” in this context is defined as 
the first documentation of an observation and does not differentiate between hard- copy and 
electronic records.  
9.5.4. Archiving of Study -Related Documents  
Records related to this clinical study must be retained either for at least 2  years after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or until at least 2  years h ave elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.  The sponsor will notify the investigator as to when these documents no longer need to be retained for this use.

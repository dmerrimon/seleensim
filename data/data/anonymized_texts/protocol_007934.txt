Study Design:
This study has four parts. Each part of the study begins with a Screening Period of up to 4 weeks to 
allow for completion of S creening procedures and subject scheduling. Each subject will be screened 
by means of medical history, medication review, Gastrointestinal Symptoms Q uestionnaire (GSQ), 
physical examination, vital signs, weight, height, laboratory tests, and ECG. The GSQ is being used 
as a separate safety monitoring tool in this study to ensure that all gastrointestinal complaints are 
reported by  the subject.
Following completion of all Screening procedures, eligible subjects will be enrolled in the study. 
Part 1 of the study in healthy subjects will be completed prior to enrollment of any subject in Part 2 
of the study.
A subject enrolled in Part 1 of the study will participate in one of five dose Cohorts. Healthy subjects
will participate in Cohort 1A -1, 1B-1, 1C-1, 1D-1, or 1E -1, and patients with CeD will participate 
in Cohort 1A -2, 1B-2, 1C-2, 1D-2, or 1E -2. Enrollment of healthy subjects in each of the five dose 
Cohorts will occur sequentially. Enrollment of patients with CeD in each of the five dose Cohorts 
will occur sequentially, but each of these dose Cohorts will be open to enrollment only after 
demonstration of the safety and tolerability of the same dose leve l in healthy subjects.
A healthy subject enrolled in Part 2 of the study will participate in one of three Groups (Group 1 
[Cohorts 2A, 2B, and 2C]), Group 2 [Cohorts 2D and 2E]) , or Group 3 [Cohorts 2F and 2G, 
Cohorts 2F and 2H, or Cohorts 2I and 2J]). Each Group 1 and Group 2 subject will be randomized 
to the treatment order. Each Group 3 subject will be randomized to the gluten amount in the study 
meal, the PvP001 dose, and the treatment order. Enrollment of subjects in Group 1 ,Group 2 , and 
Group 3 may o ccur in parallel.
A healthy subject enrolled in Part 3 of the study will participate in one of fiveGroups (Group 1 
[Cohorts 3A and 3B], Group 2 [Cohorts 3C and 3D], Group 3 [Cohorts 3E and 3F), Group 4 
[Cohorts 3G and 3H] , and Group 5 [Cohorts 3I and 3J]) . Each Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Group 4 , 
and Group 5 subject will be randomized to the treatment order. Enrollment of subjects in Group 1, 
Group 2, Group 3, Group 4 , and Group 5 will occur sequentially.
A healthy subject enrolled in Part 4 of the study w ill participate in two Cohorts (Cohort 4A and 
Cohort 4B). Each Part 4 subject will be randomized to the treatment order. Enrollment of subjects 
in Part 4 may occur in parallel with enrollment of subjects in Part 3.
Subjects who participate in Part 1 or Par t 2 of the study, and who arenot ADA positive, may participate 
in Part 3 or Part 4 of the study. No other subjects may participate in more than one Part/Group of the 
study.
Part 1
This is a single -blind, placebo -controlled, single ascending dose study of PvP001, followed by 
administration of a single dose of the MFD of PvP002, in healthy adult subjects and adult patients 
with well controlled CeD.
A single dose of PvP001 placebo, PvP001 100 mg, PvP001 300 mg, or PvP001 900 mg will be 
administered in ascendi ng order to healthy subjects in Cohorts 1A -1, 1B-1, 1C-1, and 1D -1, and to 
patients with CeD in Cohorts 1A -2, 1B-2, 1C-2, and 1D -2, respectively. A single dose of the MFD 
of PvP002 will then be administered to healthy subjects in Cohort 1E -1 and to patient s with CeD in 
Cohort 1E -2. Each subject will participate in only one of the five dose Cohorts and will be blinded 
to the PvP001 and PvP002 dose (PvP001 placebo, PvP001 100 mg, PvP001 300 mg, PvP001 900 mg , 
or MFD of PvP002). The MFD of PvP002 will not exce ed the MTD of PvP001.

Enrollment in each of the five dose Cohorts will begin with healthy subjects in Cohort 1A -1 and 
will proceed sequentially through Cohort 1E -1 according to the dose escalation guidelines below. 
Dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as a study drug -related serious adverse event (SAE) or 
a study  drug-related adverse event (AE) of Grade 2 or higher based on Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.031.
3 subjects will be treated at the given PvP001 dose level and the safety data through the Safety 
Follow Up Call will be reviewed

Amendment 6 (December 15, 2020) Page 12
Once a given PvP001 dose level or the MFD of PvP002 is deemed safe in healthy subjects based on 
these guidelines, enrollment of patients with CeD will begin at this dose l evel and will proceed 
according to the same dose escalation guidelines. This may occur simultaneously with enrollment 
of healthy subjects in the next higher PvP001 dose Cohort or in the MFD of PvP002 Cohort. 
Patients with CeD enrolled in Part 1 of the stud y will only be administered dose levels of PvP001 
or PvP002 that have previously been deemed safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects.
Each subject will report to the Clinical Research Center the afternoon prior to the Cohort Treatment 
Day (i.e., on Cohort Treatment Day -1). The subject will eat a gluten -free dinner at the Clinical 
Research Center and will subsequently begin an overnight fast (nothing by mouth for at least 
12hours). Pretreatment buffer solution (to raise the fasting gastric pH to a level above which the 
enzyme in PvP001 and PvP002 is stable), followed by study drug, will be administered orally 
immediately prior to beginning the ingestion of a standardized gluten -free study meal. The entire 
study  meal will be ingested within 10 minute s of study  drug administration.
A blood sample will be obtained before pretreatment buffer solution administration ,at several time 
points for approximately 480 minutes (8 hours) after study  drug administration on the Cohort 
Treatment Day ,and at the 24-Hour Safety  Assessment approximately 24 hours after study drug 
administration to evaluate systemic exposure to PvP001 and PvP002.
Ice chips (a maximum of 240 mL up to every hour) may be ingested beginning one hour after study 
drug administration and continuing until ad libitum ingestion of food and liquids begins. Ingestion 
of food and liquids (normal diet in a healthy subject and gluten -free diet [GFD] in a patient with 
CeD) ad libitum may begin approximately 185 minutes after study drug administ ration, provided, 
ifapplicable, any gastrointestinal symptoms or signs have resolved or are considered stable by the 
Investigator. Thesubject will begin an overnight fast (nothing by mouth except water for at least 
12hours) prior to the 24-Ho urSafety A ssessment.
The 24-Ho urSafety Assessment will occur for each subject approximately 24 hours after study 
drug administration.
Each subject will be discharged from the Clinical Research Center following completion of the 
24-Hour Safety Assessment, and when t he Investigator determines that the subject is in stable 
condition.
A Safety Follow Up Call will occur for each subject 5 ±2 days after the 24 -Hour Safety Assessment.
At the discretion of the Investigator, the subject will return to the Clinical Research Center for a 
safety follow up visit and/or a safety follow up procedure(s) (e.g., clinical laboratory tests).
A blood sample will be obtained at the Follow Up Anti -Drug Antibody Blood Sampling Visits 14 ± 
2 day s and 28 ± 2 days after the Cohort Treatment D ay to test for ADA to PvP001 and PvP002. In a 
subject who develops ADA, the ADA level will be monitored until it returns to the pre -dose 
baseline.
Part 2
This is a single -blind, placebo -controlled, single dose study  of PvP001 and PvP002 using gastric 
sampl e aspiration to evaluate gluten degradation in healthy adult subjects under the following 
conditions: (a) In Group 1, administration of PvP001 placebo, the MTD of PvP001, and the MTD 
of PvP001 following 7 days of PPI treatment, before a standardized 3 g gl uten-containing study 
meal, (b) In Group 2, administration of the PvP002 comparator ( sterile water) and the MFD of 
PvP002, before a standardized 3 g gluten -containing study  meal , and (c) In Group 3, administration

study  meal, and administration of PvP001 placebo and PvP001 900 mg before a standardized 6 g 
gluten - containing study meal. (Note: The MTD of PvP001 in healthy volunteers has been determined
to be 90 0 mg and has been administered to Group 1 healthy volunteers before a 3 g gluten -containing
study  meal. This dose of PvP001 and placebo will be administered before a higher [6 g] gluten -
containing meal, and two lower doses [300 mg and 600 mg] of PvP001 and placebo will be 
administered before a lower [1 g] gluten -containing meal, in Group 3 healthy volunteers.)
Twelve subjects will participate in Group 1 and will receive PvP001 placebo, the MTD of PvP001, 
and the MTD of PvP001 following 7 days of treatment w ith a standard dose of a PPI; each of these 
12 subjects will receive all three treatments ,but will be randomized to the treatment order. Group 1 
subjects will be blinded to the PvP001 dose (placebo or the MTD).
Ten unique subjects will participate in Gro up 2 and will receive the PvP002 comparator ( sterile 
water ) and the MFD of PvP002; each of these 10 subjects will receive both treatments ,but will be 
randomized to the treatment order. Group 2 subjects will be blinded to which of the two treatments 
is act ive study drug. 
Twenty -four unique subjects will participate in Group 3. Each subject will receive two treatments, 
but will be randomized to the treatment order. Eight subjects will be randomized to receive a 1 g 
gluten -containing study meal; the two trea tments will be PvP001 placebo and PvP001 300 mg. 
Eight subjects will be randomized to receive a 1 g gluten -containing study  meal; the two treatments

Pretreatment buffer solution, followed by study drug, will be administered orally immediately prior 
to beginning the ingestion of a standardized 3 g gluten -containing study meal (Group 1 and Group 
2) or a standardized 1 g gluten -containing or 6 g gluten -containing study meal (Group 3). The entire 
study  meal w ill be ingested within 10 minutes of study drug administration.
The use of the NG tube will facilitate aspiration of gastric contents to measure the concentration of 
gluten (i.e., to assess gluten degradation). A gastric sample (approximately 5 mL) will be obtained 
via the NG tube before pretreatment buffer solution administration. A gastric sample (entire gastric 
content) will be obtained via the NG tube 35 minutes after study drug administration in a Group 1 
and Group 2 subject. A gastric sample (approxim ately 5 mL) will be obtained via the NG tube 20 
and 35 minutes after study drug administration, and a gastric sample (entire gastric content) will be 
obtained via the NG tube 65 minutes after study drug administration, in a Group 3 subject. Gastric 
pH test ing will also be performed on these samples; the pH of the gastric sample obtained before 
pretreatment buffer solution administration will be used to confirm that the NG tube is in the 
stomach and will serve as the pretreatment pH measurement. The aspirate d volume of the entire 
gastric content sample obtained 35 minutes after study drug administration in a Group 1 and Group 2 
subject and 65 minutes after study drug administration in a Group 3 subject will be measured before a 
portion is removed for pH testi ng and gluten quantification.
A blood sample will be obtained before pretreatment buffer solution administration and at several 
time points for approximately 480 minutes (8 hours) after study drug administration on each Cohort 
Treatment Day to evaluate sys temic exposure to PvP001 and PvP002.
A urine sample will be obtained before and approximately 240 minutes after study drug 
administration on each Cohort Treatment Day in a Group 3 subject to test for gluten immunogenic 
peptides, provided the subject consen ts to this. 
Ingestion of food and liquids (normal diet) ad libitum may begin approximately 185 minutes after 
study  drug administration in a Group 1 and Group 2 subject and ingestion of plain gluten -free food 
(i.e., fresh uncooked fruits, fresh uncooked vegetables, hard-boiled eggs removed directly from 
their shells, unseasoned nuts removed directly from their shells) and liquids (i.e., water, Gatorade,

administrati on in a Group 3 subject , provided, if applicable, any  gastrointestinal symptoms or signs 
have resolved or are considered stable by the Investigator. Ingestion of food and liquids (normal 
diet) ad libitum may begin approximately 255 minutes after study drug administration (i.e., after 
completion of the 240 -minute post-dose urine sampling for gluten immunogenic peptides) in a 
Group 3 subject. The NG tube will have been removed prior to the ingestion of food and liquids 
(normal diet) ad libitum in a Group 1 an d Group 2 subject and prior to the ingestion of plain gluten -
free food and liquids in a Group 3 subject.
Each subject will be discharged from the Clinical Research Center following completion of all 
study  procedures on each Cohort Treatment Day, and when t he Investigator determines that the 
subject is in stable condition. Each subject will have a washout period of 7 1 day s (Group 1 and 
Group 2) or 3 ± 1 days (Group 3) between Cohort Treatment Days.
A Safety Visit will occur for each Part 2 subject 5 2days after the final Cohort Treatment Day, 
or5 2days after the subject’s last Cohort Treatment Day for a subject who withdraws early from 
the study .
A blood sample will be obtained at the 
Follow Up Anti -Drug Antibody Blood Sampling 
Visits 14 ± 2 days and 28 ± 2 days after the final Cohort Treatment Day to test for ADA to PvP001 
andPvP002. In a subject who develops ADA, the ADA level will be monitored until it returns to 
the pre -dose baseline.
Part 3
This is a single -blind, placebo -controlled, single d ose study of PvP003 , a tablet formulation, using 
gastric sample aspiration to evaluate gluten degradation in healthy adult subjects under the following
conditions: (a) In Group 1, administration of PvP003 placebo and PvP003 600 mg with pretreatment
buffer solution before a standardized 1 g gluten - containing study meal, (b) In Group 2, administration
of PvP003 placebo and PvP003 600 mg without pretreatment buffer solution before a standardized 
1 g gluten-containing study meal, (c) In Group 3, administration of PvP003 placebo and PvP003 
600 mg without pretreatment buffer solution after an approximately 50 mL portion of a standardized
1 g gluten-containing study meal, (d) In Group 4, administration of PvP003 placebo and PvP003 
600 mg without pretreatment buffer solution before a standardized gluten -free study meal followed 
approximately 30 minutes later by a standardized 1 g gluten -containing study meal , and (e) In 
Group 5, administration of PvP003 placebo and PvP003 150 mg without pretreatment buffer 
solution before a standardized 1 g gluten -containing study  meal. Data from both the 600 mg dose 
and the 150 mg split tablet dose will pro vide data on activity across the expected clinically relevant 
dose range to inform future formulation development and doses for inclusion in planned clinical 
trials.
Thirty -six unique subjects (6 subjects in each of the following four Groups :Group 1, Grou p 2, 
Group 3, and Group 4 , and 12 subjects in Group 5 ) will participate in Part 3 and will receive 
PvP003 placebo and PvP003 150 mg or 600 mg as noted below ; each of these 36subjects will 
receive both treatments, but will be randomized to the treatment or der. Part 3 subjects will be 
blinded to which of the two treatments is active study drug. 
A subject may not participate in more than one Group. Enrollment of subjects in Group 1, Group 2, 
Group 3, Group 4 , and Group 5 will occur sequentially.

the 300 mg dose, 6 mg/mL for the 600 mg dose, and 9 mg/mL for the 900 mg dose.
PvP002 is a capsule containing the same active enzyme, Kuma062, in a dry powder formulation. 
The MFD of PvP002 will be based on the amount of enzyme included in each capsule and the maximum number of capsules that can easily be swallowed by a subject with 100 mL of sterile water. The MFD of PvP002 is expected to be in the range of 300-400 mg (e.g., 3-4 capsules, each containing 100 mg of active enzyme), but will not exceed the MTD of PvP001. PvP002 capsules 
will be swallowed with 100 mL of sterile water.
PvP003 300 mg is a tablet containing the same active enzyme,
In subjects receiving PvP003 600 mg, two PvP003 placebo tablets or 
PvP003 300 mg tablets will be swallowed with 100 mL of sterile water during the subject’s admission at the Clinical Research Center or with water (e.g., tap or bottled) in the amount needed 
outside of the Clinical Research Center. In subjects receiving PvP003 150 mg, one PvP003 placebo 
tablet or PvP003 300 mg tablet will be cut approximately in half and will be swallowed with 100 mL of sterile water during the subject’s admission at the Clinical Research Center. The dose 
will be confirmed by the weight of the split tablet and must be within 10% of the target weight for 
half of a tablet.  Data from both the 600 mg dose and the 150 mg split tablet dose will provide data on activity across the expected clinically relevant dose range to inform future formulation 
development and doses for inclusion in planned clinical trials.
In Part 1 and Part 2 (Group 1 and Group 3) of the study, PvP001 placebo will be 100 mL of sterile 
water administered orally. In Part 2 (Group 2) of the study, the PvP002 comparator will be 100 mL of sterile water administered orally. In Part 3 (Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Group 4, and Group 5) and Part 4 of the study, PvP003 placebo will be a tablet containing 
administered orally, indistinguishable by taste and appearance (e.g., shape, 
size, color) from the PvP003 300 mg tablet.
In Part 1 of the study, a standardized blended gluten-free study meal consisting of ice cream, egg 
whites, orange juice, lime juice, vanilla extract, and gluten-free bread will be prepared and frozen 
until prior to ingestion, at which time it will be removed from the freezer and partially thawed at room temperature.
In Part 2 of the study, a standardized blended gluten-containing study meal consisting of ice cream, 
egg whites, orange juice, lime juice, vanilla extract, and whole wheat bread containing 3 g of gluten (Group 1 and Group 2), whole wheat bread contain ing 1 g of gluten (Group 3 Cohorts 2F, 2G, and 
2H), or whole wheat bread containing 3 g of gluten as well as 3 g of gluten powder added to the meal (Group 3 Cohorts 2I and 2J) will be prepared and frozen until prior to ingestion, at which time it will be removed from the freezer and partially thawed at room temperature. One gram of PEG 3350 powder will be added to and blended with the other ingredients at the time the standardized gluten-containing study meal is prepared and will serve as a marker of total gastric volume.
In Part 3 of the study, a standardized blended gluten-containing study meal consisting of ice cream, 
egg whites, orange juice, lime juice, vanilla extract, and whole wheat bread containing 1 g of gluten 
(Group 1 Cohorts 3A and 3B, Group 2 Cohorts 3C and 3D, Group 3 Cohorts 3E and 3F, Group 4 Cohorts 3G and 3H, and Group 5 Cohorts 3I and 3J) will be prepared and frozen until prior to ingestion, at which time it will be  removed from the freezer and partially thawed at room 
temperature. One gram of PEG 3350 powd er will be added to and blended with the other ingredients

Testing of these samples for PvP001, PvP002 , and PvP003 will be performed using a validated 
method.
Safety Assessments:
Safety assessments will be conducted throughout the study and will include monitoring of AEs, 
GSQs, phy sical examinations, vital signs, weight assessments, clinical laboratory tests (chemistry, 
hematology, and urinalysis), ADA testing, serum and urine pregnancy tests (in females), and ECGs.
The GSQ will include nine items (abdominal discomfort, abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, 
constipation, di arrhea, passing gas, belching/burping, nausea, and heartburn), each rated on a five -
point Likert scale on which the lowest score, 0, denotes no symptoms and the highest score, 4, 
denotes the most pronounced symptoms. In Part 1 of the study, each subject wi ll complete the GSQ 
on the Cohort Treatment Day pre -dose (i.e., before pretreatment buffer solution administration) and 
post-dose (i.e., after completion of study meal ingestion) to ensure that all gastrointestinal 
complaints are reported by the subject. I n Part 2 and Part 3 of the study, each subject will complete 
the GSQ on each Cohort Treatment Day pre -dose (i.e., before and after NG tube placement) and 
post-dose (i.e., after completion of study meal ingestion) to ensure that all gastrointestinal 
complai nts are reported by the subject. In Part 4 of the study, each subject will complete the GSQ 
on Day 1 and Day 5 of each Cohort Treatment Period pre -dose (i.e., before administration of the 
first daily dose of study drug) and on Day 1 of each Cohort Treatmen t Period post-dose (i.e., after 
completion of breakfast ingestion ), as well as every day  at bedtime from Day 1 of the first Cohort 
Treatment Period through the day prior to the Safety Visit, to ensure that all gastrointestinal 
complaints are reported by th e subject.
A blood sample will be obtained at the Follow Up Anti-Drug Antibody Blood Sampling Visits 14 ±
2 day s and 28 ± 2 days after the Cohort Treatment Day (Part 1) ,after the final Cohort Treatment 
Day (Part 2 and Part 3 ), or after Day  5 of the second Cohort Treatment Period (Part 4) to test for 
ADA to PvP001 ,PvP002 , and PvP003 . Testing of samples for ADA will be performed using 
validated assay s. Confirmed positive samples will be further tested for neutralizing activity. In a 
Part 1 and Part 2 subject who develops ADA, the ADA level will be monitored until it returns to
the pre -dose baseline. In a Part 3 and Part 4 subject who develops ADA, the ADA level will be 
monitored monthly until it returns to the pre -dose baseline or for 6 months, whichev er occurs first. 
As appropriate, the potential impact of ADA on safety, efficacy, and PK will be assessed.
Sample Size Justification:
No formal sample size calculations were conducted for Part 1, Part 2, or Part 4 of this study. The 
sample sizes in Part 1 ,Part 2 , and Part 4 of the study were selected to meet the objectives of the 
clinical trial (i.e., to assess the safety and PKof PvP001, PvP002, and PvP003 in Part 1 ,Part 2 , and 
Part 4 , as well as the gluten degradation ability of PvP001 and PvP002 in Part 2 ). In addition, in 
Part 2 of the study, the number of subjects in Group 1 was selected so that at least two subjects 
would be randomized to each of the six possible treatment orders and the number of subjects in 
Group 3 was selected so that at le ast four subjects would be randomized to each of the six possible 
gluten amount, PvP001 dose, and treatment order combinations ; in Part 4 of the study, the num ber 
of subjects was selected so that at least three subjects would be randomized to each of the t wo 
possible treatment orders .
Sample size determination and justification were conducted only for Part 3 of this study. As 
residual gluten <50 mg is regarded as meaningful in reducing gluten -induced symptoms, the sample 
size calculation for Part 3 of the s tudy is based on the proportion of subjects with <50 mg residual 
gluten. For pooled Part 3 Group 2 and Part 3 Group 3, and for Part 3 Group 5, with a sample size of 
12 (i.e., sixsubjects in Group 2 and sixsubjects in Group 3), assuming the true (populati on) 
Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use

Amendment 6 (December 15, 2020) Page 28
proportion is 85%, the 80% exact confidence interval (CI) will be (62%, 95%) when the obs erved 
rate is 83% (10 out of 12 subjects). Based on the width of this CI, the chosen sample size was 
considered to provide an acceptable level or precision in the estimation of the primary endpoint.
Statistical Methods and Types of Analyses:
Full details of the statistical analyses will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).
Part 1 ,Part 2 , Part 3, and Part 4 analyses will be presented separately.
Part 1 analyses will be presented by dosage level of PvP001 and the MFD of PvP002. Healthy 
subjects and patients with CeD will be presented separately and combined.
Part 2 analyses will be presented by G roup and Cohort. Select analyses will also be present ed by 
Cohort order in each Group. Additional analyses for Part 2 Group 3 may be described in the SAP.
Part 3 analyses will be presented by Group and Cohort. Select analyses will also be presented by 
Cohort order in each Group.
Part 4 analyses will be prese nted by Cohort. Select analyses will also be presented by Cohort order .
In Part 2, the percent of gluten degraded by PvP001 and PvP002 35 minutes after study drug 
administration will be calculated for each Group 1 and Group 2 subject for each treatment rec eived ,
and t he percent of gluten degraded by PvP001 20, 35, and 65minutes after study drug administration
will be calculated for each Group 3 subject for each treatment received. In Part 3, the percent of 
gluten degraded by PvP003 35 and 65 minutes after study  drug administration will be calculated for 
each Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, and Group 5 subject for each treatment received, and the percent 
of gluten degraded by PvP003 65 minutes after study drug administration will be calculated for 
each Group 4 subject for each treatment received. The gluten amount recovered and the percent of 
gluten degraded at the scheduled time points after study  drug administration will be summarized 
using descriptive statistics. In addition, the amount of gluten recovered in t he subject’s stomach 
after active treatment relative to the amount of gluten recovered in the same subject’s stomach after 
placebo (comparator) treatment will be reported according to the formula utilized by Siegel 2012 : 
percent of gluten degraded = (1 –active/placebo) x 100. For Group 1, this calculation will be done 
for both active study drug using the MTD (Cohort 2B) and active study drug using the MTD with 
PPI pretreatment (Cohort 2C).
The count and percentage of subjects reporting TEAEs and TESA Es will be summarized overall, 
by System Organ Class, by  Preferred Term within the Sy stem Organ Class, by  maximum severity, 
and by relationship to study drug. In Part 2 and Part 3 , AEs and SAEs will also be summarized by 
relationship to study procedure (i.e., NG tube placement or presence). All other safety parameters, 
including clinical laboratory values, will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous 
variables and counts and percentages for categorical variables. Shift tables may be emp loyed to 
present out -of-range laboratory values and abnormal ECG findings.
Pharmacokinetic analyses to characterize drug exposure will include, at a minimum, determination 
for each Cohort of maximum plasma concentration, time of maximum plasma concentratio n, 
terminal half -life, and areas under the plasma concentration -time curve (AUC) following the dose 
administration, derived from the plasma concentration -time data. The AUC will be estimated by the 
linear trapezoidal rule. Actual times at which blood sampl es are obtained will be used in PK 
analy ses.
An interim analysis will be performed on a sub setof subjects in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study.

1 INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE
1.1 Background
Celiac disease (CeD) is an immuno logic disorder in which proximal small intest ine inflammat ion 
is triggered in genetically suscept ible individuals by the ingestion o f dietary  gluten. Celiac 
disease is t ypically associated with a variet y of gastroi ntestinal sympto ms, including d iarrhea, 
steatorrhea, b loating, flatul ence, abdo minal pain , and const ipation. Extraintestinal manifestations 
of the di sease include weight loss ,decreased body  mass index (BMI) , lower-than-expected 
height, abnormal liver funct ion tests (el evated transaminase levels) and other liver disorders, iron 
deficiency anemia, micronutrient deficiencies, low bone mineral densit yand increased fracture 
risk, skin disorders , increased risk of infert ility and pregnancy  com plicat ions in wo men, 
increased ris k of malignancy (e.g., enteropathy -associ ated lymphoma), and increased risk of 
mortalit y(Rubi o-Tapia 2013; Rostom 2006 ). Qualit y of life is adversely  affected by  CeD 
symptoms (Leffler 2016) .
Celiac disease , consi dered an autoimmune disorder, is commo n throughout the world and its 
prevalence has increased over the past several decades; its prevalence in the US is approximately 
1% 
(Rostom 2006). Its preval ence is increased in patients with a variet y of other autoimmune 
diseases, and patients with CeD appear to be at increased risk for the development of other 
autoimmune diseases (Rubi o
-Tapia 2013; Rostom 2006) .
The di agnosis of CeD is usually init ially based on signs, symptoms, and serologic testing for 
CeD-specific ant ibodies . Serol ogic tests serve as markers of CeD -specific autoimmunit y and are 
dependent on the ingestion of gluten ; when used for diagnostic purposes, such as to confirm a 
clinical suspicion o f CeD, a positive test obtained while a patient i son a gl uten-containing diet
are supporti ve of the di agnosis. Confirmation of the di agnosis of CeD requi res duodenal mucosal 
biopsies obtained while a patient is on a gluten -containing di et.The immune response to gluten 
in CeD leads to chronic inflammat ion and resultant architectural changes in the intestinal 
mucosa. Hi stologic findings include villous atrophy , crypt hy perplasia, and inflammatory cell 
infiltrat ion(Rubio -Tapia 2013; Rostom 2006).
There are no United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA) -approved medicat ions for 
CeD. The only  recommended treatm ent at this tim e is a gluten-free diet ( GFD ). A strict GFD is 
effect ive in most pati ents, wi thresol ution of gastrointest inalsymptom s, intest inal damage , and 
other disease manifestations, but it must be continued throughout the patient’s lifet ime. 
However, som e pati ents have persistent C eD manifestati
ons (symptom s, signs, or ty pical 
laboratory  abnorm alities) despite adherence to a GFD for 6 -12 months; this is considered 
non-responsive C eD and occurs in up to 30% (Rubio -Tapia 2013) of  patients. The m ost co mmo n 
cause of non -responsive C eD is inadvertent gl uten ingestion (Rubi o
-Tapia 2013; Rostom 2006), 
which leads to ongoing or intermittent symptoms and intest inal inflammat ion
.
Although the term “gluten -free di et” im plies the complete absence of gluten in the pat ient’s diet, 
this is not possible due to the presence of hidden sources of glu ten in many commercial foods 
and the contaminat ion of foods with trace amounts of gluten. According to the Codex 
Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use
Protocol Number: P vP-102-01 Millennium Pharmaceuticals , Inc.
Amendment 6 (December 15, 2020) Page 36
Alimentari us2and the Federal Register3, a food l abeled “gluten -free” should have less than 
20parts per millio n (ppm ) of gluten (20 m g of gluten per kilogram of food, or 0.002% ).The 
2013 FDA reco mmendat ion for voluntary  use in food labeling was based in part on this being 
the“lowest l evel at whi ch analy tical methods have been scient ifically validated to reliably and 
consistently detect glu ten across a range of f ood m atrices,” as well as the expected low likelihood
that this level of gluten would cause adverse healt h effects in most individuals wit h CeD.
Thus, t he term “gluten -free diet” actually indicates that the gluten level in the diet i s at levels 
thatare considered to have a low risk o f harm. The exact level below which dietary  gluten is 
considered “harmless” is not known and is likely to vary between individuals due to differing 
levels o f sensit ivity. According to
 Leonard 2017, trace amounts of gluten that may be present in 
foods labeled gluten -free m ay be as harmful as non -adherence to a GFD. O ne study evaluat ing 
intestinalbiopsies in patients with CeD who received 0, 10, or 50 mg of gluten per day  for 
90days concluded that the daily  gluten am ount shoul d be <50 m g 
(Catassi 2007). A system atic 
review fo und that l ess than 10 m g of gluten per day  is unlikely to cause significant histologic 
abnorm alities in most pati ents wi th CeD 
(Akobeng 2008; Rubio -Tapia 2013 ).
Quest ionnaire -based stu dies have highlighted the difficult y with maintaining a stri ct GFD despite 
the intention to do so, with frequent accidental (including inadvertent) gluten ingest ion 
(Hall 2013);  dissat isfaction with the GFD and interest in novel therap ies (Aziz 2011); barri ers to 
maintaining a GFD including restaurant eating and the availabilit y and cost of gluten -free foods 
(Tennyso n
2013); the high treatment burden ( Shah 2014) and its negat ive impact on qualit y of 
life ( Wolf2017); and the interest in and need for medicat ion (Aziz 2011; Tennyso n 2013).
As noted in the report of the third Gastroenterology Regulatory  Endpo ints and Advancement of 
Therap eutics workshop held in 2015 
(Leffler 2016 ), limitat ions to the adherence to and 
effect iveness of the GFD include the potential for gluten contamination when dining out and 
with the use of m edicati ons and supplements. Patients who report persistent intest inal or extra -
intestinal symptoms despite attempt ing to adhere to a GFD could especially benefit from non -
dietary  therapi es, according to the report. The workshop report also noted that patients desire 
non-dietary  treatm ents for CeD and are more interested in therapies that protect against gluten 
contaminat ion than those that facilitate intent ional gluten ingest ion. It was concluded that there is 
a high unmet medical need for therapy  beyond the GFD (i .e., pharm acologic interventi ons). 
Although there currently is no non -dietary  therapy  with FDA approval  for CeD, pharmacol ogic 
treatm ents for CeD are being evaluated in clinical trials, including supplemental enzyme therapy .
One co mponent of gluten, gliadin, const itutes approximately  50% of  the total  protein 
composition of  gluten and is rich in the amino acids proline (P) and glutamine (Q). In all 
individuals, gliadin undergoes only partial digestion by gastric, pancreatic, and inte stinal  brush 
border proteases in the upper gastrointestinal tract, as these proteases are unable to cleave the 
proline -and glutamine -rich regi ons wi thin gliadin. These inco mpletely digested peptides enter

the small intestine and, in suscept ible individual s, can tri gger an immune response 
(Rostom 2006 ; Lindfors 2012; Kaukinen 2015 ; Wolf 2015 ). Thus, oral enzyme supplementation 
with glutenases is designed to target and break down ingested proline -and gl utamine -rich 
pepti des, before they  reach the sm all intestine, into sm aller, non -immunogenic pept ides.
To address the unmet need for pharmaco logic therapy , a variet y of enzymes, including those 
derived fro m bacteri a, fungi, and germinat ing cereals, have been studied (Lindfors 2012 ). In 
published invitro studies, in vivo (animal) studies, and early phase clinical trials in healthy adul t 
subjects and adult patients with CeD treated with these gl utenases, a mixture of a barley -derived 
endoprotease (EP -B2) that targets the amino acid glutamine and a bacterium -derived prolyl 
endopeptidase (SC PEP) that targets the amino acid proline, as well as a fungus ( Aspergillus 
niger )-derived prolyl endoprotease (AN -PEP), have been reported to degrade and decrease the
immunogenicit y of gluten ( Siegel 2006 ; Gass 2007 ; Mitea2008; Tye -Din 2010 ; Siegel 2012 ; 
Salden2015; Janssen 2015). For example,  Siegel 2012 reported that ALV003 (a mixture of 
EP-B2 + SC PEP) 100 mg a nd 300 mg degraded 75% and 88%, respectively , of 1 g of gl uten in 
a meal containing proteins, fats, and carbohydrates i n the stom achof healthy adult subjects and 
adult pati ents wi th CeD in two Phase 1 clinical trials evaluat ing ALV003 as a potential oral 
treatm ent to be used in conjunct ion with a GFD for C eD.Tye-Din 2010 reported the results of a 
study  in which adult patients with CeD who were following a GFD and were challenged for three 
days wi th a single daily dose of 16 mg of gluten that had been pretreated before ingest ion with a 
mixture of EP -B2 and SC PEP, designated ALV003. Gluten -specific peripheral T cell responses 
were noted in significantly fewer patients in the group challenged with ALV003 -pretreated 
gluten com pared to the group challenged with placebo -pretreated gluten, and the mean increases 
in T cell responses fro m baseline to day  6 were si gnificant in the group challenged with placebo -
pretreated gluten.
Overall, however, in c linical trials of patients with CeD, symptomatic 
(Tye-Din2010 ; Tack 2013 ;
Lahdeaho 2014; Murray 2017; Syage2017 ) or hi stologic (Tack 2013; Lahdeaho 2014;
Murray 2017) responses associated with the use of these enzym es have not been consistent ly 
seen.
Significant safet y issues have not been reported in these clinical trials wit h EP -B2 + SC PEP 
(ALV003, lat iglutenase) or AN -PEP (Tye
-Din 2010 ; Siegel 2012 ; Tack 2013; Lahdeaho 2014; 
Salden2015; Murray 2017) , including in pat ients with CeD. In the study  reported by  
Siegel 2012, s ystemic exposure to the two components of ALV003 was low (i .e., EP -B2 was 
detected in a single sample collected two hours after dosing in a fasting subject who received the 
highest dose [1800 mg]) . Seven of the subjects who received ALV003 in the fast ing state 
developed ant ibodies to EP -B2, although there were no related clinical symptoms or sequel ae
(Siegel 2012) .AN-PEP has beco me commercially available in the US as a dietary supplement 
(Tolerase®G; DSM, The Netherlands) and, as such, does not require FDA approval.
Com putati onal protein design allows for the developmen t of proteins, such as enzymes, that have 
a specified set of characterist ics and thus would be ideally  suited for the treatm ent of  a target 
disease. An enzyme that specifically targets the proline -glutamine (PQ) di peptide, rather than the 
single amino acid proline (P) or glutamine (Q), 
found in the immunogenic gliadin pept ides is 
desirable as a potenti al treatm ent for CeD(Gordon 2012). Gordon 2012 reported ident ification o f

a naturally -occurring endopeptidase (kumamo lisin-As, designated “Kuma”), active in acidic 
condi tions, from  the bacteri um Alicyclobacillus sen daiensis . These researchers then used 
computati onal protein design and recombinant techno logy to re engineer this enzyme to have and 
to optimize all the traits that woul d make i t suitable for development as oral enzyme therapy  for 
CeD. In vitro studies with a highly act ive version of the enzyme, which the researchers referred 
to as KumaMax, indicated that it degraded >95% of an immunogenic (immunodominant) peptide 
present in α-gliadin within 50 minutes ( Gordon 2012).
As di scussed by Wolf2015, the proteoly tic act ivity required of an oral  enzyme is high, sin ce 
accidental  ingestion o f 1 g of gluten (approximately one -fourth of a slice o f bread) would require 
≥99% degradation within the stomach in a physio logically rel evant time frame to reduce the 
intragastric residual gluten amount to ≤10 mg, which would like ly avoid an immunologic response
within the duodenum. Thus, the versio n of Kuma evaluated in the study  published by  
Gordon 2012 was subsequent ly co mputationa lly redesigned to greatly increase enzymat ic 
activit y, which resul ted in >99% degradati on of  immunogenic pept ides in in vit ro studi es 
(Wolf2015) .In simulated gastric digest ion studies, the enzyme degraded >99.97% of 10,000 
ppm of
 gluten, which resul ted in a rem aining level of gl uten well  below the 20 ppm  thresho ld for 
“gluten free” labeling ( Wolf2015).
Millennium Pharmaceuticals , Inc. has conducted an in vivo animal study  inwhich the enzyme 
was capable of degrading up to >99% of gluten in a rat model of human gastric digest ion(Report 
H005, on file, Millennium Pharmaceut icals, Inc. ). Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has also 
conducted a variety  of other l aboratory  studies wi th Kuma, including a subsequent versio n of the 
enzyme (Kuma062) that was determined to be an optimal version based on comparisons between 
it and previous versio ns and which will be used in the current study . Kuma062 has been shown 
in 
vitro to rapi dly degra de up to >99% of gluten at doses ranging fro m 80 m g to 800 m g, 
including over a wide range of pH levels. It has also been shown in vitro and in simulated gastric 
digesti on studi es to degrade gl uten m ore effect ively than either AN -PEP or EP -B2 + SC PEP, 
including in simulated gastric digest ion studies with a “real world” meal containing a variet y of 
different protein sources in addit ion to gl uten, as well as carbohydrates and fat (Report H007, on 
file, Millennium Pharmaceut icals, Inc. ).
Thus, Kuma062 ’s abilit y to rapidly and effect ively degrade gluten under gastri c condi tions is 
expected to greatly reduce the potential of gluten to stimulate the human immune response and is 
essent ial to justify human studies assessing enzyme activit y in actual  meal digesti on scenari os.
Important ly, even low levels of intest inal gluten exposure can trigger symptoms and mucosal 
inflammat ion in pat ients with CeD.
Finally , the safet y profile of Kuma062 has been established in the clinical and nonclinical studies 
conducted to date; these studies are discussed in the I nvest igator’s Brochure (IB).

1.2 Study Rationale
The only currently recommended treatment for CeD is strict and lifelong adherence to a GFD. In 
light of the difficulty of strictly adhering to and maintaining a life-long GFD, the substantial risk 
and common occurrence of inadvertent gluten exposure, even in individuals attempting to adhere 
to a GFD, and the incomplete response to a GFD in man y patients, which is most commonly due 
to inadvertent gluten exposure, new therapies for CeD are needed and are desired by patients. As there is no non-dietary therap y with FDA approval for CeD, t here is a high unmet need for other 
treatment, especially a pharmacologic intervention that  could be used as an adjunct to a GFD. An 
oral glutenase appears to be a potential new therapy for CeD.
In particular, given the enzyme’s ability to rapidly and effectively degrade gluten in the laboratory
studies conducted thus far, as well as its sa fety profile in clinical and nonclinical studies to date, 
it is important to continue the development of Kuma062 to determine its potential as a new oral
enzyme therapy as an adjunct to a GFD for patients with CeD. Therefore, Phase 1 clinical trials are being conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of Kuma062 in humans.
In the current Phase 1 four-part clinical trial, PvP001 (liquid formulation of Kuma062), PvP002 
(capsule formulation of Kuma062), and PvP003 (tablet formulation of Kuma062) will be studied. 
PvP003, a tablet formulation developed after PvP001 and PvP002 in anticipation of Phase 2 clinical development, is expected to be more tolerant of the acidic environment of the stomach, 
to have more sustained activity in the stomach, and to have comparable gluten-degrading activity 
to PvP001 and PvP002. PvP001 and PvP002 have been studied in Phase 1 clinical trials; PvP003has not been previously studied in humans.
!In the first part (Part 1) of the study, the safety of single doses of PvP001 and PvP002 
administered in the presence of a standardized gluten-free study meal will be evaluated in 
healthy adult sub jects and in patients with CeD.
!In the second part (Part 2) of the study, the gluten-degrading activity of single doses of 
PvP001 and PvP002 in the stomach in the presence of a standardized gluten-containing 
study meal will be evaluated in healthy adult subjects; the effect of pretreatment with 
seven days of a standard dose of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) on the gluten-degrading activity of PvP001 will also be evaluated in this part of the study.
!In the third part (Part 3) of the study, the gluten-degrading activity of single doses of 
PvP003 in the stomach administered (a) with pretreatment buffer solution 
  
before a standardized gluten-containing study meal (just as 
pretreatment buffer solution is being administered with the enzyme in liquid and capsule 
formulations in Part 2 subjects, it is being administered with the enzyme in tablet 
formulation in this group of Part 3 subjects), (b) without pretreatment buffer solution before a standardized gluten -containing study meal, (c) during a standardized gluten-
containing study meal, and (d) before a standardized gluten-free study meal followed by 
a standardized gluten-containing study meal will be evaluated in healthy adult subjects; and (e) with a lower dose before a standardized gluten-containing study meal.CCI

In the fourth part (Part 4) of the study, the safety of multiple doses of PvP003 administered
in the pr esence of regular meal swill be evaluated in healt hy adult subjects to support a 
longer duration of treatment with this formulat ion in Phase 2 clinical development . 
Positive results fro m this study  will justify evaluat ing this enzyme further in patients with CeD in 
future studies.
1.3 Special Considerations
The effect of pretreatment with seven days of a standard dose of a PPI on the abilit y of PvP001 
to degrade gluten in a standardized study  meal in the stom ach in heal thy adul t subjects will  be

4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design
This is a four-part, Phase 1, single center study .Each part o f the study  begins wi th a Screening 
Period of  up to 4 weeks to allow for complet ion of Screening procedures and subject scheduling. 
Each subject will be screened by  means of medical history , medicati on review, GSQ, physical 
examinat ion, vital s igns, weight, height, laboratory tests, and ECG.
Following com pletion of all Screening procedures, eligible subjects will be enroll ed in the study . 
Part 1 of the study  in healthy subjects will be complet ed prior to enrollment of any subject in Part 
2 of the study.
A subject enrolled in Part 1 of the study will part icipate in one of five dose Cohorts. Healthy 
subjects will participate in Cohort 1A -1, 1B -1, 1C- 1, 1D -1, or 1E -1, and patients with CeD will 
participate in Cohort 1A -2, 1B -2, 1C-2, 1D- 2, or 1E -2. Enrollment of healt hy subjects in each of 
the five dose Cohorts will occur sequent ially. Enrollment of patients with CeD in each of the five 
dose Cohorts will occur sequentially, but each of these dose Cohorts will be open to enrollment 
only after dem onstration of  the safet y and tol erabili ty of the same dose level in healt hy subjects.
A healt hy subject enrolled in Part 2 of the study  will parti cipate in one of threeGroups (Group 1 
[Cohorts 2A, 2B, and 2C]) ,Group 2 [Cohorts 2D and 2E]) , or Group 3 [Cohor t
s 2F and 2G,
Cohorts 2F and 2H, or Cohorts 2I and 2J ]) . Each Group 1 and Group 2 subject will be 
rando mized to the treatment order. Each Group 3 subject will be rando mized to the gluten 
amount in the study  meal, the PvP001 dose, and the treatment order . Enrollment of subjects in 
Group 1 ,Group 2 , and Group 3 may occur in parallel.
A healt hy subject enrolled in Part 3 of the study  will parti cipate in one of fiveGroups (Group 1 
[Cohorts 3A and3B], Group 2 [Cohorts 3C and 3D], Group 3 [Cohorts 3Eand 3F ), Group 4 
[Cohorts 3G and 3H] , and Group 5 [Cohorts 3I and 3J]) . Each Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, and 
Group 4 subject will be randomized to the treatment order. Enrollment of subjects in Group 1, 
Group 2, Group 3, Group 4 , and Group 5 will occur sequent ially.
A healt hy subject enrolled in Part 4 of the study  will parti cipate in two Cohorts ( Cohort 4A and 
Cohort 4B ). Each Part 4 subject will be rando mized to the treatment order. Enrollment of
subjects in Part 4 may occur in parallel with enrollment of subjects in Part 3.
Subjects who participate in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study , and who are not ADA posit ive, may 
participate in Part 3 or Part 4 of the study . No other subjects m ay parti cipate in m ore than one 
Part/Group of the study .

A single dose of PvP001 placebo, PvP001 100 mg, PvP001 300 mg, or PvP001 900 mg will be 
administered in ascending order to healthy subjects in Cohorts 1A -1, 1B -1, 1C- 1, and 1D -1, and 
to patients with CeD in Cohorts 1A -2, 1B -2, 1C- 2, and 1D -2, respectively. A single dose of the 
MFD of PvP002 will then be administer ed to heal thy subjects in Cohort 1E -1 and to patients 
with CeD in Cohort 1E -2. Each subject will part icipate in only one of the five dose Cohorts and 
will be blinded to the PvP001 and PvP002 dose ( PvP001 placebo, PvP001 100 mg, PvP001 
300mg, PvP001 900 m g, or MFD of PvP002 ).The MFD of PvP002 will not exceed the MTD of

of PvP002 will not be used in Part 2
Once a given PvP001 dose level or the MFD of PvP002 is deemed safe in healt hy subjects based 
on these guidelines, enrollment of patients with CeD will begin at this do se level and will 
proceed according to the same dose escalation guidelines. Thi s may occur simultaneously with 
enrollment of healthy subjects in the next higher PvP001 dose Cohort or in the MFD of PvP002 
Cohort. Patients with CeD enrolled in Part 1 of the study  will only be administered dose levels of 
PvP001 or PvP002 that have previously  been deemed safe and well tolerated in healt hy subjects.

8 STUDY DRUG
8.1 Study Drug Description
PvP001 is a liquid containing the active enzyme, Kuma062, in a formulation buffer 
 It will be s upplied as a frozen liquid in 
single-use 5 mL screw-cap polypropylene cryogenic vials, each of which contains approximately
3.5 mL of PvP001 at a concentration of 100 mg/mL.
PvP001 will be thawed approximately 15 minutes pri or to the time of planned administration by 
gently rolling the vial between the hands until thawed and then gently inverting (not shaking) the vial approximately eight times, being careful to prevent foaming to preserve protein stability. 
Immediately prior to administration, to achieve the required PvP001 dose to be administered, 
sterile water will be poured into a polypropylene cup to the approximately 70-80 mL line. Studypersonnel will then slowly (to avoid air bubb les to preserve protein stability) pipette a specified 
volume of thawed PvP001 from the vial and add this to the sterile water. The contents of the cup 
will be gently swirled a few times to mix. Additional sterile water, to a total volume of 100 mL, will be added to the cup and the contents of the cup will again be gently swirled a few times to 
mix. The total volume of PvP001 plus sterile water will be the same (100 mL) for all PvP001 
doses. The volumes of thawed PvP001 and sterile water to achieve each required PvP001 dose in a total volume of 100 mL are shown in Table 9.

The MFD of PvP002 will be 
administered and will be based on the amount of enzyme included in each capsule and the 
maximum number of capsules that can easily be swallowed by a subject with 100 mL of ster ile 
water. The MFD of PvP002 is expected to be in  the range of 300-400 mg (e.g., 3-4 capsules, 
each containing 100 mg of active enzyme), but will not exceed the MTD of PvP001.CCI

9 DESCRIPTION OF STUDY PROCEDURES
Specific study  procedures are described below. The study  visits and time poi nts during study  
visits at whi ch these procedures are performed are included in Section 4.4(see Table 5, Table 6, 
Table 7, and Table 8) and in Secti on 7.2.
Safety of PvP001, PvP002 , and PvP003 will be assessed by  collecti on and review of AEs , GSQ s, 
physical examinat ions, vital signs, wei ght assessments, clinical laboratory  tests (chemistry, 
hematol ogy, and urinalysis) , ADA testing, serum and urine pregnancy  tests (in female s), and 
ECG s
.The GSQ is being used as a separate safet y monitoring tool  in this study to ensure th at all 
gastrointestinal co mplaints are reported by  the subject .The PK profile of PvP001 and PvP002 
will be assessed using blood samples obtained in Part 1 and Part 2 of the study .The PK profile of 
PvP003 will be assessed using blood samples obtained in Part 3 and Part 4 of the study . The 
efficacy of PvP001, PvP002 , and PvP003 will be assessed by  evaluating gluten degradation in 
gastri c samples obtained via an NG tube in Part 2 andPart 3 of the study .
9.1 Standardized Study Meal
A standar dized blended study  meal will be administered to subjects in this study . This m eal is 
intended to be similar to the meal in the study  reported by  Siegel 2012, as discussed in the IB.
Four versions of this standardized blended study meal will be admin istered in this study .
One 
meal is gluten -free (it includes bread that is gluten -free) and will be administered in Part 1 of the 
study  to both healt hy subjects and patients with CeD and in Part 3 of the study  to heal thy 
subjects in Group 4 (Cohorts 3G and 3H) (seeAppendix D). Ano thermeal contains 3g of gluten 
(it includes bread with 3 g of  gluten) and PEG 3350 and will be administered in Part 2 of the 
study  to heal thy subjects in Group 1 (Cohorts 2A, 2B, and 2C) and Group 2 (Cohorts 2D and 2E) 
(seeAppendix E). Another meal contains 1 g of gluten ( it includes bread with 1 g of gluten) and 
PEG 3350 and will be administered in Part 2 of the study  to heal thy subjects in Group 3 (Cohorts 
2F, 2G, and 2H ) and in Part 3 of the study to healthy subjects in Group 1 (Cohorts 3A and 3B) , 
Group 2 (Cohorts 3C and 3D) , Group 3 (Cohorts 3E and 3F) , Group 4 (Cohorts 3G and 3H) , and 
Group 5 (Cohorts 3I and 3J) (seeAppendix F). Another meal contains 6 g of gluten (it includes 
bread with 3 g of gluten as well as 3 g of gluten powder added to the meal ) and PEG 3350 and 
will be administered in Part 2 of the study to healt hy subjects in Group 3 (Cohorts 2I and 2J) (see 
Appendix G).Except for the bread and gl uten powder , all other ingredients of the study meal s
are the same. The approximate volume of allstudy meals is 300mL.A co mplete list of the 
ingredients, weight and energy  content of each ingredi ent, wei ght and energy content of all 
ingredients combined , and instructions for preparatio n, handling, and sto rage of th egluten-free 
meal ,the 3 g gluten -containing meal , the 1 g gl uten-containing m eal, and the 6 g gl uten-
containing meal are included in Appendix D,Appendix E,Appendix F, and Appendix G, 
respectively .
One gram o f PEG 3350 powder, taken from a mult idose co ntainer and weighed, will be added to 
and blended with the other ingredients at the time the standardized gluten -containing study  meal 
is prepared and will serve as a marker of dilut ion by endogenous gastric secret ions. It is taste -, 
preservat ive-, sugar -,and gluten -free, and contains no inact ive ingredients. The weight and

relative energy content of the study  meal will not be altered significant ly by the addit ion of this 
very low am ount of  PEG powder.
Ingest ion of the study  meal will  begin immediately aft er com pletion of  study  drug 
administration. The ent ire study  meal will  be ingested by  the subject wi thin 10 minutes of 
completion of study  drug administration.
Part 1
The obj ective o f Part 1 of thi s study  is to eval uate the safet y of PvP001 and PvP002 admi nistered 
to healt hy subjects and to patients with CeD, rather than to evaluate the gluten -degrading activit y 
of PvP001 and PvP002. Thus, patients with CeD who are on a GFD will be enrolled in this part 
of the study , will  maintain a GFD during study  parti cipation, and will not be challenged wit h a 
gluten-containing m eal. As i t is important to administer the same meal to both healt hy subjects 
and pat ients with CeD, a standardized gluten-free study  meal will be administered to both 
healt hy subjects and pat ients with CeD in this part of the study .
Part 2
The standardized 3 g gluten -containing study meal will be administered to Group 1 and Group 2 
subjects in Part 2 of this study  to eval uate the abilit y of PvP001 and PvP002 to degrade 3 g of 
gluten in healt hy adult subjects. The am ount of  gluten (3 g) in th isstudy  meal was selected based 
on the gl uten degradation capabilities observed under simulated gastric condit ions in the 
laboratory , as discussed in the IB.
The standardized 1 g and 6 g gluten -containing study  mealswill be administered to Group 3 
subjects in Part 2 of this study  to eval uate the abilit y of PvP001 to degrade 1 g of gluten and 6 g 
of gluten in healt hy adult subjects. The amount sof gluten (1 g and 6 g) in th esestudy  meals were
selected base d on the amount of gl uten in the meal in the study  reported by  Siegel 2012 and on 
the gluten degradation capabilit ies observed under simulated gastric condit ions in the laboratory , 
as discussed in the IB.
Part 3
The standardized 1 g gl uten-containing study  meal will be administered to Group 1, Group 2, 
Group 3, Group 4 , and Group 5 subjects in Part 3 of this study to evaluate the abilit y of PvP003 
to degrade 1 g of gluten in healt hy adult subjects. (Note: The standardized 1 g gluten -containing 
study  meal administered to Part 3 subjects will be ident ical to the standardized 1 g gluten -
containing meal administered to Part 2 Group 3 subjects.) The am ount of gl uten (1 g) in thi s

9.2 Gastrointestinal Symptoms Questionnaire
The GSQ (seeAppendix H)that will be completed at the Clinical Research Center by  a Part 1 , 
Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4 subject, as well as every  day at bedtime by a Part 4 subject ,is being 
used as a separate safet y monitoring tool  in this study  toensure that all gastrointestinal 
complaints are reported by  the subject . Thi s quest ionnaire will include nine items (abdominal 
discomfort, abdominal pain, abdo minal bloat ing, constipat ion,diarrhea, passing gas, 
belching/burping, nausea , and heartburn) , each rated on a five -point Li kert scal eon which t he 
lowest score, 0, denotes no symptoms and the highest score, 4 , denotes the most pronounced 
symptoms. This questi onnai re is a m odified versi on of  the “Symptom s Diary” described by 
Salden2015; modificati ons include minor changes to medical termino logy, addi tion of a relevant 
symptom (i.e., heartburn), and changes to the scale numbering (i.e., from 1 -5 to 0-4).
Part 1
Each subject will co mplete the GSQ at Screening and pre
-dose (i .e., before pretreatment buffer 
solution administration) on the Cohort Treatment Day  to ensure that the subject is free of 
clinically relevant gastrointestinal symptoms. The pre -dose GSQ on the Cohort Treatment Day  
will be considered the baseline GSQ. The subject will co mplete the GSQ post -dose (i.e., after 
completion of study  meal ingestion) at specified time points on the Cohort Treatment Day ,as 
well as at the 24-Hour Safety A ssessment ,to ensure that all gastrointestinal co mplaints are 
reported by  thesubject.
Part 2
Each subject will co mplete the GSQ at Screening to ensure that the subject is free of clinically  
relevant gastrointestinal symptoms. The subject will co mplete the pre-dose GSQ (i.e., before 
pretreatm ent buffer solut ion administration) twice on each Cohort Treatment Day . The subject 
will co mplete the first pre -dose GSQ prior to placement of the NG tube to ensure that the subject 
is free of clinically relevant gastro intestinal symptom s. The subject will co mplete the second pre -
dose GSQ after placement of the NG tube to ensure that all gastrointestinal co mplaints that occur 
in associat ion with the pl acement or presence of the NG tube are reported by  the subject. The 
post-NG tube GSQ on the Cohort Treatment Day will be considered the baseline GSQ.
The subject will co mplete the GSQ post -dose (i.e., after complet ion of study  meal ingesti
on) at 
specified time points on each Cohort Treatment Day to ensure that all gastrointe stinal co mplaints 
are reported by  the subject .
Part 3
Each subject will co mplete the GSQ at Screening to ensure that the subject is free of clinically 
relevant gastrointestinal symptoms. The subject will co mplete the pre -dose GSQ (i.e., before 
pretreatm entbuffer solut ion administration [Group 1], before study  drug administration [Group 
2,Group 4 ,and Group 5 ], or before ingestion o f a 50 mL portion of a standardized 1 g gluten-
containing study  meal [Group 3]) twice on each Cohort Treatment Day . The subjec t will 
complete the first pre -dose GSQ prior to placement of the NG tube to ensure that the subject is

free of clinically relevant gastrointest inal symptoms. The subject will co mplete the second pre -
dose GSQ after placement of the NG tube to ensure that al l gastrointestinal co mplaints that occur 
in associat ion with the pl acement or presence of the NG tube are reported by  the subject. The 
post-NG tube GSQ on the Cohort Treatment Day  will be considered the baseline GSQ.
The subject will co mplete the GSQ post -dose at specified time po ints on each Cohort Treatment 
Day to ensure that all gastrointestinal complaints are reported by  the subjec t.
Part 4
Each subject will co mplete the GSQ at Screening and pre- dose (i .e., before administration of the 
first daily  dose of study  drug) on Day  1 and Day 5 of each Cohort Treatment Period to ensure 
that the subject is free of clinically relevant gastrointestinal s ymptom s. The p re-dose GSQ on 
Day 1 of theCohort Treatment Period will be considered the baseline GSQ.
The subject will co mplete the GSQ post -dose (i.e., after administration of the first daily dose of 
study  drug) at specified time points on Day 1 of eachCohort Treatm ent Periodto ensure that all 
gastrointestinal co mplaints are reported by  the subject.
The subject will co mplete the GSQ every  day, at bedtime, starting on Day  1 of the fi rst Cohort 
Treatment Period and continuing through the day  prior to the Safet y Visit,to ensure that all 
gastrointestinal co mplaints are reported by  the subject . The subject will complete the GSQ based 
on symptom s that occur redsince the subject awoke that morning. The subject will be instructed
to bring theGSQs (com pleted a nd not completed) to each visit at the Clinical Research Center 
through the Safet y Visit, and study  personnel will review the GSQs on Day -1 of the second 
Cohort Treatment Period and on Day 4 of each Cohort Treatment Period to ensure they  have 
been co mpleted every day.
Research staff will dispense all GSQs for the subject to complete through the Safet y Visit on Day  
1 of the first Cohort Treatment Period, will collect completed GSQs on Day -1 of the second 
Cohort Treatment Period and on Day  4 of each Cohort Treatment Period, and will collect all 
remaining GSQs (com pleted and not com pleted) at the Safet y Visit.
9.3 Nasogastric Tube
In Part 2 and Part 3 of the study , the NG tube will be used to obtain gastric samples, as discussed 
in Secti on9.4. Both nasal passages will be examined by the Invest igator using anterior 
rhinoscopy  to ensure thei r patency , and to ensure that the mucosa is normal and the septum is 
intact, at Screening and prior to NG tube pl acement on each Cohort Treatment Day . A minor 
septal  deviat ion at Screening is not in itself exclusionary  for study parti cipat ion if, in the opinio n 
of the Invest igator, it will not preclude passage o f the NG tube or pose a safet y issue for the 
subject; however, the Invest igator will pass the NG tube through the more patent nasal passage 
or may choose to place an OG tube instead of an NG tube .
The subject’s fasting status (nothing by mouth for at least 12 hours ) will be confirmed prior to 
placement of the NG tube . Estimat ion of the tube length will be performed by measuring the

distance from  the ti p of the nose, around the external ear (pinna), to just below the left costal 
margin. The t ip of the tube will be cooled in ice prior to its pl acement to im prove i ts rigidity to 
facilitate passage through the nose , and topical lidocaine gel will be applied to the tube to 
decrease disco mfort in the nose and throat, and to reduce the gag reflex, during tube placement .
If the Investi gator determines that placement of an OG tube instead of an NG tube is preferable 
for a given subject , topi cal lidocaine spray may be applied to the pharynx . The topi cal lidocaine 
preparati on shoul d not con tain epinephrine or PEG. The subject wi ll be posi tioned si tting 
upright, neck partially  flexed, and asked to hol d a cup of 5 mL of sterile water wi th a straw in it 
and place the straw in the mouth. Thephysician Investigator will insert the NG tube (14-
18French size) through the nostril and along (parallel to) the floor of the nose until it reaches the 
back o f the nose (i.e., the nasopharynx). As the tube is advanced through the throat, the subject 
will be asked to sip water through the straw and swallow. The subject will be asked to swallow 
(without water) as the tube is advanced through the upper esophagus . The tube will be advanced 
past the lower esophageal sphincter and into the stomach , to the predetermined length; the 
desired locati on of  the NG tube ti p and aspirati on ports is the gastri c antrum . Proper pl acement 
of the NG tube will be assessed by  auscul tation over the stomach during insertion of air though 
the tube with a sy ringeand by gastri c pH testing . The gastric pH should be < 4to confirm proper 
placement of the NG tube, except on th e Cohort 2C Treatment Day  before which the subject will 
have been on a Nexium pretreatment regimen; if the Nexium  pretreatm ent regimen resul ts in a 
Cohort 2C Treatment Day  gastri c pH ≥4, proper placement of the NG tube will be assessed by  
auscultat ion only . The tube will be secured in place on the nose using tape. If incorrect tube 
placement i s suspected (e.g., based on auscultat ion, gastric pH testing, signs, or symptoms), the 
tube will be co mpletely wit hdrawn immediately; placement of the tube may be repe ated at the 
discreti on of  the Investi gator. There will be a minimum wait ing period of approximately 
15minutes after NG tube placement before the next study procedure is performed .
The placement and presence of an NG tube may be associated with a variet y of gastrointestinal 
symptoms. If a gastrointestinal sign or symptom (or other si gn or symptom ) occurs i n associ ation 
with the pl acement or presence of the NG tube, addit ional time may be allowed for it to resolve, 
or to lessen and be stable, such that the Investigator determines that the subject is able to 
continue in the study . If necessary (e.g., a symptom or sign associated with the placement or 
presence of the NG tube is severe) at any time during or after NG tube placement, the NG tube 
will be removed,and the subject will be withdrawn fro m the study .
A gastrointestinal symptom or sign that occurs af ter the NG tube is placed, but bef ore pretreatment
buffer solution administration (Part 2 and Part 3 Group 1) , before study drug administration (Part 3
Group 2 ,Part 3 Group 4 , and Part 3 Group 5 ), or before ingestion of  the50 mL porti on of the 1 g 
gluten -containing study  meal (Part 3 Group 3) will be considered an AE and assessed by the 
Invest igator for relatedness to the placement or presence of the NG tube. A new gastrointest inal 
symptom  or sign that occurs after the NG tube has been placed and the study meal has been 
completed (Part 2 , Part 3 Group 1, Part 3 Group 2 , Part 3 Group 4 , and Part 3 Group 5) , after the 
NG tube has been placed and the final porti on of  the study  meal has been com pleted (Part 3 
Group 3), or after the NG tube has been placed and the gluten -freestudy meal ha sbeen completed 
(Part 3 Group 4) , and/or worseni ng of a gastrointestinal symptom  or si gn that occurred after 
placement of the NG tube by ≥1 severit y grade based on CTCAE Version 4.031, will be

considered an AE and assessed by the Invest igator for relatedness to the placement or presence 
of the NG tube and to the study  drug.
The subject will remain in an upright (e.g., sitting)position while the NG tube is in place and for 
at least 15 minutes after it has been removed. The NG tube will be removed subsequent to 
completingallpost-dose gastric sampl ingand pri or to the ingestion of food and liquids (norm al 
diet) ad libitum in a Part 2 Group 1 and Part 2 Group 2 subject and prior to the ingest ion of plain 
gluten-free food and liquids in a Part 2 Group 3 and Part 3 subject (seeSection 7.2.10 ).
9.4 Gastric Sampl esfor pH and Gluten Degradation
In Part 2 and Part 3 of the study , the NG tube will be used to obtain gastric samples to evaluate 
the degradati on of  ingested gluten.
Immediate ly after the NG tube is placed on each Cohort Treatment Day , a gastri c sample 
(approximately 5 mL) will be aspirated . A porti on of  this gastri c sample will be tested for pH 
using a pH probe to confirm that the NG tube is in the stomach andto serve as the pretreatment 
pH measurement ; aseparate portion will be used for determinat ion of gluten degradat ion
.
Part 2
AGroup 1 and Group 2 subject will be asked to m oveapproximately 10 minutes after study  drug 
administration and a Group 3 subject will be asked to move approximately 10 and 45 minutes 
after study  drug administrati on in order to promote gastric content mixing . In addit ion, 
approximately  10, 15, and 2 0minutes after study  drug administration in a Group 1 and Group 2 
subject and 10, 12, and 14 minutes after study  drug administration in a Group 3 subject , 
approximately  
30-40 mL of gastri c contents will be gent ly aspirated from the NG tube using a 
60mL syringe, then reinjected through the NG tu be (as described by
 Siegel 2012). Beginning 
20 minutes (or, at most, 25 minutes) and beginning 3 5minutes (or, at most, 40 minutes) after 
study  drug administrati on in a Group 3 subject, a gastric sample (approximately 5 mL ) will  be 
aspirated. A porti on of  the approximately 5 mL gastric sample will then be tested for pH using a 
pH probe; a separate portion will be used for determinat ion of gluten degradat ion. Beginning 
35minutes (or, at m ost, 40 minutes) after study  drug administration in a Group 1 an d Group 2 
subject and 65 minutes (or, at most, 70minutes) after study  drug administration in a Group 3 
subject , the entire gastric content will be aspirated and itsvolume will be measured. Aporti on of  
the ent ire gastri c content sample will then be tested for pH using a pH probe ; a separate portion 
will be used for determinat ion of gluten degradat ion.The fo llowing m easures may  be utilized if
there is an inabilit y to aspi rate gastri c material(e.g., due to l ack of or i naccessible gastric 
content, adh erence of the NG tube to the gastric mucosa, blockage of the NG tube) for the pre -
dose gastric sample, for the 10-, 15- , or 20 -minute post -dose gastric mixing in a Group 1 or 
Group 2 subject, for the 10-, 12-, or 14-minute post -dose gastric mixing in a Gro up 3 subject , for 
the 35-minute post -dose gastric sample in a Group 1 orGroup 2 subject, or for the 20-, 35- , or 
65-minute post -dose gastric sample in a Group 3 subject : air may be inserted through the NG 
tube, the subject m ay be reposi tioned, or the NG tube may  be reposi tioned (in this case, the NG 
tube tip and aspirat ion ports should still be in the gastric antrum). If necessary, the least am ount

of sterile water necessary may be inserted through the NG tube and the volume of sterile water 
will be documented.  Each gluten degradation sample will be immediately placed in a heating 
block at a temperature of 85 °C for 15-20 minutes to halt enzyme activity; these samples will 
then immediately be frozen (-80 °C ±10 °C) and subs equently shipped to a third-party contract 
laboratory for immunogenic gluten quantif ication and PEG 3350 concentration determination.
Immunogenic gluten will be quantified using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) 
based on the commercially available monoclonal R5 and G12 antibodies that are specific for 
immunogenic fractions of gluten.
Samples will be banked for possible future testing for gluten degradation,
provided the subject consents to this.
Polyethylene glycol 3350 will be used as a marker of total gastric volume, to correct for any
gastric material that may not be recovered at the 35-minute post-dose time point in a Group 1 
and Group 2 subject or at the 20-, 35-, and 65-minute post-dose time point in a Group 3 subject.
The PEG 3350 concentration will be determined using LC-MS/MS, and total gastric volume willbe calculated by dividing the administered PEG 3350 amount by the measured PEG 3350 
concentration. This will allow the total gastri c gluten amount to be calculated based on total 
gastric volume.
Part 3
A Group 1, Group 2, or Group 5 subject will be asked to move approximately 10 minutes after 
study drug administration in order to promote ga stric content mixing. In addition, approximately
10, 15, and 20 minutes after study administration in a Group 1, Group 2, or Group 5 subject, 
approximately 30-40 mL of gastric contents will be gently aspirated from the NG tube using a 60 mL syringe, then reinjected through the NG tube (as described by Siegel 2012) . Beginning 
35 minutes (or, at most, 40 minutes) after study drug administration in a Group 1, Group 2, or 
Group 5 subject, a gastric sample (approximately 15 mL) will be aspirated and its volume will be 
measured. A portion of the approximately 15 mL gast ric sample will then be tested for pH using 
a pH probe; a separate portion will be used for determination of gluten degradation. Beginning 
65 minutes (or, at most, 70 minutes) after study drug administration in a Group 1, Group 2, or Group 5 subject, the entire gastric content will be aspirated and its volume will be measured. A 
portion of the entire gastric content sample will then be tested for pH using a pH probe; a 
separate portion will be used for determination of gluten degradation.
A Group 3 subject will be asked to move approximately 10 minutes after study drug 
administration in order to promote gastric content mixing. In addition, approximately 10, 12, and 
14 minutes after study administration in a Group 3 subject, approximately 30-40 mL of gastric 
contents will be gently aspirated from the NG tube using a 60 mL syringe, then reinjected through the NG tube (as described by Siegel 2012) . Beginning 35 minutes (or, at most, 
40 minutes) after study drug administration in a Group 3 subject, a gastric sample 
(approximately 15 mL) will be aspirated and its volume will be measured. A portion of theapproximately 15 mL gastric sample will then be tested for pH using a pH probe; a separate 
portion will be used for determination of gluten degradation. Beginning 65 minutes (or, at most, CCI

be aspirated and its volume will be measured. A por tion of the entire gastric content sample will 
then be tested for pH using a pH probe; a separate portion will be used for determination of 
gluten degradation.
A Group 4 subject will be asked to move approximately 10 and 40 minutes after study drug 
administration in order to promote gastric content mixing. In addition, approximately 10, 12, and 
14 minutes and approximately 40, 45, and 50 minutes after study administration in a Group 4 
subject, approximately 30-40 mL of gastric contents will be gently aspirated from the NG tube using a 60 mL syringe, then reinjected through the NG tube (as described by
Siegel 2012 ). 
Beginning 65 minutes (or, at most, 70 minutes) after study drug administration in a Group 4
subject, the entire gastric content will be aspirated and its volume will be measured. A portion of the entire gastric content sample will then be  tested for pH using a pH probe; a separate portion 
will be used for determination of gluten degradation.
The following measures may be utilized if there is  an inability to aspi rate gastric material (e.g., 
due to lack of or inaccessible gastric content, adherence of the NG tube to the gastric mucosa, blockage of the NG tube) for the pre-dose gast ric sample, for the 10-, 15-, or 20-minute post-
dose gastric mixing in a Group 1, Group 2, or Group 5 subject, for the 10-, 12-, or 14-minute 
post-dose gastric mixing in a Group 3 or Group 4 sub ject, for the 40-, 45-, or 50-minute post-
dose gastric mixing in a Group 4 subject, for the 35 -minute post-dose gastric sample in a Group 
1, Group 2, Group 3, or Group 5 subject, or for the 65-minute post-dose gastric sample in a 
Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, Group 4, or Group 5 sub ject: air may be in serted through the NG 
tube, the subject may be repositioned, or the NG tube may be repositioned (in this case, the NG 
tube tip and aspiration ports should st ill be in the gastric antrum). If n ecessary, the least amount 
of sterile water necessary may be inserted through the NG tube and the volume of sterile water will be documented.  Each gluten degradation sample will be immediately placed in a heating 
block at a temperature of 85 °C for 15-20 minutes to halt enzyme activity; these samples will 
then immediately be frozen (-80 °C ±10 °C) and s ubsequently shipped to a third-party contract 
laboratory for immunogenic gluten quantif ication and PEG 3350 concentration determination.
Immunogenic gluten will be quantified using ELISA based on the commercially available

11 A DVERSE EVENTS
11.1 Definition of Adverse Events
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical invest igation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have a causal  relati onship 
with theproduct. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a n
abnorm al laboratory  finding , for example ), symptom , or di sease tem porally associ ated wi th the 
use of apharmaceut ical product , whether or not it is considered related to the pharmaceutical 
product .
A clinically  significant l aboratory  value is an abnorm al laboratory  value that is accompanied by a
signor symptom; the sign or symptom (or the di agnosis when av ailable) is considered theAE 
and should be recorded as such. All laboratory  values, including abnormal values, will be 
recorded separately during the study .
A TEAE isdefined as an AE wi th onset after pretreatment buffer so lution/study  drug 
administration or an exist ing condit ion that worsens after pretreatment buffer solut ion/study  drug
administration .
11.2 Documenting Adverse Events
All reported AE swill be documented, including events that are spontaneously reported by  a 
subject and events that will be elici ted by asking each subject a general, non -directed questi on 
such as “How are y ou feeling?” or “How have you been feeling since the last visit ?” through the 
Safety Follow Up Call (Part 1) or Safety  Visi t (Part 2 ,Part 3, and Part 4). Adverse events that are
spontaneously reported after the Safet y Follow Up Call (Part 1) or Safety  Visi t (Part 2 ,Part 3, 
and Part 4 ) through the 28 ± 2 day s Follow Up Anti -Drug Ant ibody  Blood Sam pling Vi sit will 
be docum ented. Directed questioning and examination will then be do ne, as appropriate.
Gastrointestinal AE s(e.g., spontaneously  reported gastrointestinal symptoms or abnormal 
findings on abdo minal physical examinat ion) will be docum ented according to the above , while
the GSQ is being used as a separate safet y monitoring tool  in this study  to ensure that all 
gastrointestinal co mplaints are reported by  the subject. 
Whenever feasible, the AE should be documented as a medical diagnos is(highest possible level 
of integrati on). When thi s is not possible, the AE should be documented in terms of the sign
and/or symptom observed by  the Invest igator or reported by the subject.
Inform ation documented will include the descript ion of the AE, the date of onset and the date of 
resol ution (if applicable), severit y, seriousness, relati onship to study  drug, relationship to study  
procedure (i.e., NG tube placement or presence in Part 2 and Part 3 subjects) , acti on taken, and 
the outcom e.It is the responsibilit y of the Principal Investi gator to docum ent all  AEsthat occur 
after the first dose of study  drug i s administered, in accordance with the guidelines above, 
Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use
Protocol Number: P vP-102-01 Millennium Pharmaceuticals , Inc.
Amendment 6 (December 1 5, 2020) Page 132
regardl ess of whether or not they  are considered to be related to the study  drug or to the study  
procedure (i.e., NG tube placement or presence in Part 2 and Part 3 subjects).
11.3 Assessment of Severity
The Investigator will categorize the severity of each AE according to CTCAE Version 4.031.
11.4 Assessment of Causality
After care ful medical consideration, the Invest igator will assess the relationship of the AE to the 
study  drug according to the following categories:
Not related: A causal relat ionship between study  drug and the AE can be easily ruled 
out (e.g., based on the temporal  relati onship, absence of a reasonable 
pathophysio logicmechanism, or direct evidence of actual cause)
Unlikely  Related :A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormali ty, with a tem poral  
relationship to the study  drug which m akes a causal re lationship 
improbable, and in which other drugs, chemicals ,or underlying disease 
provi de pl ausible explanations
Possibly Related: A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormali ty, with a reasonable 
temporal  relationship to the study  drug, but which could also be 
explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals
Probably  Related :A clinical event, including laboratory  test abnormali ty, with a reasonable 
temporal  relationship to the study  drug, unlikely  to be attributed to 
concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals
Definitely  Related :An AE that is most likely caused by the study  drug, per Investigator 
assessment. Rechallenge is not required to fulfill this definit ion.
In Part 2 andPart 3 of this study , each subject will undergo placemen t of an NG tube. The 
placement and presence o f an NG tube may be associated with a variet y of signs and symptom s, 
including gastrointest inal symptoms. For this reason, the Invest igator will be asked to assess 
each AE for relatedness to the study  drug and f or rel atedness to the study  procedure (i .e., NG 
tube placement or presence).

Amendment 6 (December 1 5, 2020) Page 133
11.5 Adverse Event Outcome
The Investigator will categorize the outcome of each AE according to the following definit ions:
Reso lved: The subject recovered from the AE. Record the AE stop date.
Ongo ing: At the time of the last assessment, the event is ongoing, with an 
undetermined outcome. (Note: An o ngoing AE isnot consi dered resolved 
as a result of death. )No AE stop date should be recorded when an AE is 
ongoing.
Chronic/Stable :At the time of last assessment, the event is ongo ing and stabilized, with no 
change to the event outcome anticipated. Record the AE stop date.
Death : The AE direct ly caused death. Record the date of death as the AE stop 
date.
Unknown : There i s an inabilit y toaccess the subject or the subject’s records to 
determine the outcome (e.g., subject withdraws consent or is lost to fo llow 
up).No AE stop date should be recorded.
The Investigator will fo llow each AE unt il it resolves, the Invest igator feels the event is stable 
and chronic in nature, or the subject is lost to fo llow up.
11.5.1 Withdrawal Due to Adverse Event
If a subject withdraws or is withdrawn by  the Investi gator from  the study  wholly or in part due to 
an AE, every  effort m ust be m ade to follow this event unt il it resolves, the Investigator feels the 
event i s stable and chronic in nature, or the subject is lost to fo llow up.
11.6 Breaking the Blind
Not applicable, as this study  is single -blind (i .e., blinded to subject only).

12 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS
12.1 Definition of Se rious Adverse Events
AnAE is considered serious if it results in any of the fo llowing outcom es:
Death;
Life-threatening;
Inpat ient hospi talizat ion or prolongat ion of exist ing hospi talizat ion;
Persi stent or si gnificant disabilit y/incapacit y;
Congenital ano maly/birth defect in the offspring of a subject ; and/or
Other: Important m edical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
requi re hospi talizati on may  be considered SAE swhen, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they  may jeopardi ze the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervent ion to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definit ion. Examples of such 
events include :
oAllergic bronchospasm requiring i ntensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home;
oBlood dy scrasias or convulsio ns that do not result in inpatient hospitalizat ion; and
oDevelopment of drug dependency or drug abuse.
An AE that does not meet any o f the criteria for seri ousness listed above will be regarded as a 
nonseri ous AE.
If a female subject or a female partner of a male subject beco mes pregnant at any  time fo llowing 
the first dose of study  drug through the 28 ± 2 day s Follow Up Ant i-Drug Ant ibody  Blood 
Sampling Visi t, the Invest igator must notify the Medical Monitor and de signee within 24 hours 
of learning about the pregnancy. The female subject will be withdrawn from the study . Any  
prem ature terminat ions of pregnancy, including elective and/or spontaneous abortions, must be 
reported to the Medical Monitor and designee . The pregnancy will be fo llowed to term. The 
status of the mother and child after delivery must be forwarded to the Medical Monitor and 
designee . Although pregnancy occurring in a clinical trial is not considered to be an AE or SAE, 
any pregnancy  com plicati on or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be 
recorded as an AE or SAE and will be fo llowed as such. A spontaneous abortion is always 
considered to be an SAE.
Definition of Terms
Life-threatening: An AE is life -threatening if it places the subject at immediate risk of death 
from the event a s it occurred (i.e., it does not include a n event that, had i t occurred in a more 
severe form, might have caused death ).For example, drug induced hepat itis that resolved 
Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Use
Protocol Number: P vP-102-01 Millennium Pharmaceuticals , Inc.
Amendment 6 (December 1 5, 2020) Page 135
without evi dence of hepat ic failure woul d not be consi dered life threatening, even though drug 
induced hepat itis can be fatal.
Hospitalization: An AE requiring hospitalizat ion shoul d be considered an SAE.Hospitalizat ion 
scheduled for an elective procedure or treatm ent of  a pre -exist ing condit ion that has not 
worsened during participat ion in the study  (e.g., elective surgery  for a pre -exist ing condit ion that 
has not worsened), or for a 
routine clinical procedure that isnot the result of an AE need not be 
considered an SAE. If anythinguntoward i s reported during the procedure, that occurrence must 
be reported as an AE, either “serious”or “non- serious ”according to the defined criteria. In 
general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually invo lving at l eastan 
overnight stay ) at the hospital or in the emergency department for observation and/or treatment 
that woul d not have been appropriate in the physician's office or outpatient setting.
Disabili ty/incapaci ty: An AE is disabling or incapaci tating if the eventresul ts in a substant ial 
disrupt ion of asubject 's abilit y to conduct norm al life f unctions.
12.2 Serious Adverse Event Expectedness
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the IB or is 
not listed at the specific ityorseverit y that has been observed .If a serious unexpected AE is 
believed to be related to the study  drug, the Sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify  the 
Principal Invest igator participat ing in the clinical trialof the study  drug , as well as the 
appropriate regulatory  authori ties(see Section12.5).
12.3 Reporting S erious Adverse Events
Any AE that is assessed as serious , whether or not it is related to the study  drug, m ust be 
reported by  the Invest igator to the Medical Monitor and designee by tel ephone or em ail within 
24hours of knowledge of the event. An initial SAE report form should be filled out with the 
available informat ion, even if addit ional informa tion will be needed to fully document the event. 
All additional informat ion relevant to the SAE m ust be provi ded to the Medi cal Moni tor and 
designee within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s receipt of this informat ion. Relevant medical 
records, including, as applicable, hospital records and autopsy  reports, shoul d be obtained by the 
Invest igator and provided to the Medical Monitor and designee .
In the event of a fatal or life -threatening SAE, any  requi red inform ation for the init ial report must 
be provided to the Medical Monitor and designee within seven calendar days of the 
Invest igator’s init ial notificat ion of the Medical Monitor and designee . For an SAE that i s not 
fatal or life -threatening, any  required informati on for the init ial report m ust be provi ded to the 
Medical Monitor and designee within 15 calendar days of the Invest igator’s init ial notificat ion of 
the Medi cal Monitor and designee .
The Investigator will fo llow an SAE unt il it resolves, the Invest igator feels the event is stable and 
chronic in nature, or the subject is lost to fo llow up. All fo llow up informat ion relevant to the 
SAE m ust be provi ded to the Medi cal Monitor and designee within 24 hours of the Invest igator’s 
recei pt of this informati on.

Instances of death, cancer, or congenital abnormality, if brought to the attention of the Investigator
AT ANY TIME after study drug administration AND considered by the Investigator to be 
RELATED TO THE STUDY DRUG , must be reported to the Medical Monitor and designee.
No protocol-defined AEs for expedited reporting have been identified for this study.
12.4 Overdose
Any instance of overdose (suspected or confirmed, and irrespective of whether or not the study
drug was involved) must be reported by the Invest igator to the Medical Monitor and designee by 
telephone or email within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. An overdose with no associated signs or symptoms will not be classified as an AE or SAE, but should be reported to the Medical 
Monitor and designee. Any signs or symptoms of overdose should be documented as an AE or 
SAE (as applicable); an overdose associated with an SAE should be reported according to the procedures in Section 12.3.
In the case of an overdose, the subject will be monitored closely and managed with supportive 
care. Any symptoms will be treated according to the standard practices of the Investigator and 
the Clinical Research Center.
12.5 Safety Reporting to Regulatory Authorities
The Sponsor will prepare and submit safety reports (i.e., Investigational New Drug [IND] safety reports) to the FDA, as appropriate, in accordan ce with reporting requirements for SAEs. The 
Sponsor, or its representative, will send copies of these safety reports to the Principal Investigator.
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to submit this report, as well as other SAE information per the Institutional Review Board (IRB) guidelines, to the IRB.
A suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the
drug caused the AE. For the purposes of IND safety reporting of SAEs, "reasonable possibility" 
means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE.PPD

clinical trial (i.e., to assess the safet y and PKof PvP001, PvP002, and PvP003 in Part 1, Part 2 , 
and Part 4 , as well as the gluten degradat ion abilit y of PvP001 and PvP002 in Part 2 ).In 
addition, in Part 2 of the study , the number of subjects in Group 1 was selected so that at least 
two subjects would be rando mized to each of the six possible treatment orders and the number of 
subjects in Group 3 was selected so that at least four subjects would be rando mized to each of the 
six possible gluten am ount, PvP001 dose, and treatment order combinat ions;in Part 4 of the 
study , the number of subjects was selected so t hat at l east three subjects would be rando mized to 
each of the two possible treatment orders.
Sample size determinat ion and j ustificati on were conducted only  for Part 3 of this study . As 
residual gluten <50 m g is regarded as meaningful in reducing gluten -induced symptoms, the 
sample size calculat ion for Part 3 of th estudy  is based on the proportion of subjects with <50 mg 
residual gluten. For pool ed Part 3 Group 2 and Part 3 Grou p 3, and for Part 3 Group 5, with a 
sample size of 12 (i.e., sixsubjects in G roup 2 and sixsubjects in Group 3), assuming the true 
(popul ation) proporti on is 85%, the 80% exact confidence interval (CI) will be ( 62% ,95%)when 
the observed rate is 83% (10 out of 12 subjects) . Based on the width of this CI, the chosen 
sample size was considered to provide an acceptable level or precisio n in the estimat ion of the 
primary  endpoint .
14.4 Efficacy Analyses
Efficacy analyses only  apply to Part 2 and Part 3 of the study .
The percent of gluten degraded by PvP001 and PvP002 35 minutes after study drug administration
will be calculated for each Part 2 Group 1 and Part 2 Group 2 subject for each treatment 
received. The percent of gluten degraded by PvP001 20, 35, and 65 minutes after study  drug 
administration will be calculated for each Part 2 Group 3 subject for each treatment received. 
The percent of gluten degraded by PvP003 35 and 65 minutes after study  drug administration 
will be calculated for each Part 3 Group 1, Part 3 Group 2, Part 3 Group 3 , and Part 3 Group 5
subject for each treatmen t received, and the percent of gluten degraded by  PvP003 65 minutes 
after study  drug administrati on will be calculated for each Part 3 Group 4 subject for each 
treatm ent received. The calculat ion will also be performed for combined Part 3 Group 2 and Part 
3 Group 3. The gl uten am ount recovered and the percent of gluten degraded at the scheduled 
time points after study  drug administrati on will be summarized using descript ive statist ics. In 
addition, the am ount of  gluten recovered in the subject’s stomach aft er active treatm ent rel ative 
to the amount of gluten recovered in the same subject’s stomach after placebo /comparator 
treatm ent will be reported according to the formula utilized by  Siegel 2012: percent of gl uten 
degraded = (1 –active/placebo) x 100. For Group 1, this calculat ion will be done for both active 
study  drug using the MTD (Cohort 2B) and active study  drug using the MTD with PPI 
pretreatm ent (Cohort 2C).
Any other efficacy  analyses will  be described in the SAP.

PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS
Title of Study: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open -label, Single -sequence, Cross -over, 
Bioequivalence Study  to Evaluate the Pharm acokinetics, Safet y, and Tolerability  of IVIG -
PEG compared to Gamunex -C in Subjects with Primary  Humoral Immunodeficiency
Study Number: GC1902
Phase: 3
Study Objectives:
Primary  Pharmacokinetic Objective 
The primary  pharmacokinetic (PK) objective is to demonstrate bioequivalence of IVIG -PEG 
with Gamunex -C (IVIG-C)at stead y-state as determined by  comparing total IgG area under 
the concentration time curve during the defined dosing interval ([AUC 0-τ]either every  
3weeks [AUC 0-21 days ] or every  4 weeks [ AUC 0-28 days ]) and maximum concentration in a 
dosing interval (C max) in subjects diagnosed with primary  humoral immunodeficiency  (PI)
currentl y receiving chronic IVIG replacement treatment.
Other Pharmacokinetic Objectives
•To evaluate the mean steady -state trough IgG levels obtained with I VIG-PEG and 
Gamunex -C treatment in subjects with PI
To evaluate the PK profile for total IgG in the steady -state of IVIG -PEG and Gamunex -C 
for time of maximum observed concentration (T max)
To evaluate the PK profile for total IgG in the steady -state of IVIG -PEG and 
Gamunex -C 10% for clearance (Cl) and volume of distribution (V d)
Secondary  Efficacy  Objectives
•To evaluate the rate of serious bacterial infection (SBI)
•To evaluate all infections of an y kind (serious/nonserious including acute sinusitis, 
exacerbation of chronic sinusitis, acute otitis media, pneumonia, acute bronchitis, 
infectious diarrhea, etc.) as determined b y the Investigator
•Number of day s on antibiotics (including oral, parenteral, oral plus parenteral, 
prophylactic and therapeutic). Use of prophy lactic antibiotics will be distinguished from 
antibiotics for treatment of acute infection
•Number of hospitalizations due to infection
•Number of day s of work/school/daily  activities missed per subject year due to in fections 
and their treatment
Exploratory  Objectives

fungal, or protozoal pathogens (for instance, rapid streptococcal antigen detection test)
•Trough measles antibod y titers (functional assay) is an exploratory variable for 
informational purposes
Safety  Objective
The safet y objective is to evaluate the safet y and tolerability of IVIG -PEG as replacement
therap y in subjects with PI .
Overall Study Design and Description:
This is a clinical Phase 3, multicenter, open -label, single -sequence, cross- over, 
bioequivalence stud y to assess the stead y-state PK, safet y, and tolerability of IVIG -PEG 
compared with Gamunex -C in adult subjects with PI . A total of approximately  35 adult 
subjects will be enrolled in order to have 20 evaluable subj ects for PK analy sis.
The study  will include the following phases :
•Screening Phase of approximately  28 day s
•Gamunex -C Run -in Phase (IV administration of Gamunex -C) of up to 4.5 months (if 
applicable)
•Gamunex -C PK Phase of 3 or 4 weeks
•IVIG -PEG Treatment Ph aseof up to 4.5 months
•IVIG -PEG PK Phase of 3 or 4 weeks
•Final Visit/Early  Termination visit 
Prior to enrollment into the study , subjects with PI currently  receiving IVIG replacement 
treatment will be screened during the Screening Phase. Subjects must meet all the inclusion 
criteria and meet none of the exclusion criteria to be enrolled in this st udy. 
Depending on their current I VIG treatment regimen, eligible subjects may  enter directl y into 
the Gamunex -C PK Phase (those who are on a stable Gamunex- C treatment) or may  be 
required to enter the Gamunex -C Run-in Phase. Eligible subjects not on stable Gamunex -C 
treatment will be required to enter the Gamunex -C Run-in Phase to receive Gamunex -C 
treatment (Sponsor provided) to achieve an approximate steady -state condition prior to 
entering the Gamunex -C PK Phase . Subjects meeting the following conditions are required to 
enter the Run- in Phase :
Not currentl y receiving Gamunex -C 
Not on a stable dose of Gamunex- C 
Not receiving Gamunex -C every  3 weeks or 4 weeks 
After reaching a stable dose and approximate steady -state (i.e., administration of 5 
consecuti ve doses of Gamunex -C for subjects on every  4weeks dosing regimen and 6 
consecutive doses of Gamunex -C for subjects on every  3 weeks dosing regimen), the subjects 
will then enter the Gamunex -C PK Phase to determine the total IgG AUC profile of IV 5 of 121

infusions of Gamunex -C. Subjects currentl y receiving Gamunex -C who have been stable for 
4.5 to 5 months ( i.e., administration of at least 5 consecutive stable doses for subjects on 
every  4weeks dosing regimen and administration of at least 6 consecutive stable do ses for 
subjects on every  3 weeks dosing regimen) at doses between 200 and 800mg/kg prior to the 
Screening Visit will directly  enter the Gamunex -C PK Phase .
After the Screening Phase or Run -in Phase , subjects will enter the Gamunex -C PK Phase of 
3or 4 weeks duration depending on the individual dosing interval. PK samples will be drawn 
30minutes prior to the start of the PK Phase Gamunex -C infusion, immediately  upon the 
completion of the PK Phase Gamunex -C infusion (within 10 minutes of infusion 
completion), and at 1, 3, 6, 24, and 48 hours; and 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 day s (the PK sample 
drawn at 28 day s applies only  for subjects on every  4 weeks dosing regimen) after the 
completion of the PK Phase Gam unex -C infusion.
After the completion of the Gamunex -C PK Phase, subjects will enter the IVIG -PEG 
Treatment Phase. Subjects will receive a total of 5 or 6 consecutive doses of IVIG -PEG 
according to the subject’s previous Gamunex -C dosing interval ( i.e., administration of 
5consecutive doses for subjects on the every  4 weeks regimen and administration of 
6consecutive doses for subjects on the every  3 weeks regimen). The dose of IVIG- PEG 
administered during this phase will be the same as the subject’s dose d uring the Gamunex- C 
PK P hase.
Trough IgG levels will be obtained prior to all infusions in the Screening, Gamunex -C Run -
in, and IVIG -PEG Treatment phases . 
At the conclusion of the IVIG -PEG Treatment Phase ( i.e., after 5 or 6 infusions of IVIG -PEG 
dependin g on the individual dosing interval), subjects will enter into the IVIG-PEG PK Phase 
lasting 3 or 4 weeks in duration depending on the individual dosing interval. Pharmacokinetic 
samples will be drawn 30 minutes prior to the start of the IVIG -PEG infusion in the PK 
Phase, immediately  upon the completion of the PK Phase IVIG -PEG infusion (within 10 
minutes of infusion completion), and at 1, 3, 6, 24, and 48 hours; and 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 
days (the PK sample drawn at 28 day s applies only  for subjects on ever y 4 weeks dosing 
regimen) after the end of the PK Phase IVIG -PEG infusion.
At the end of the IVIG -PEG PK Phase, subjects will have their Final Visit. 
Treatment visits for the Gamunex -C Run-In Phase, Gamunex -C PK Phase, IVIG -PEG PK 
Phase ,and the Final Visit/Early  Termination Visit may be performed at the study  site or, if 
deemed appropriate, at an alternate site (e.g., subject's residence, local healthcare 
professional's site) under the care and supervision of trained healthcare personnel.  
Some treatment visits for the IVIG -PEG Treatment Phase may  also be performed at the study  
site or, if deemed appropriate, at an alternate site (e.g., subject's residence, local healthcare 
professional's site) under the care and supervision of trained healt hcare personnel . IVIG -PEG 
#1 and IVIG -PEG #2 treatment visits are to be performed at the stud y site. 6 of 121

Test Product, Dose ,and Mode of Administration
IVIG -PEG will be investigated in this study .
The IVIG -PEG dose and dosing interval will be individualized based on the previous 
Gamunex -C treatment the subject was receiving for PI  either at the Screening Visit or at the 
end of the Run- in Phase (for subjects not directl y entering the Gamunex -C Treatment Phase).
Subjects will receive IVIG- PEG by  means of an infusion pump at a dose of 200 to 800mg/kg 
per infusion at an infusion rate of 1 mg/kg/min or up to 8mg/kg/min depending on subject 
tolerance. IVIG -PEG will be administered every  3 weeks ( ±4 day s) or 4 weeks ( ±4 day s), 
depending on the subject’s prior IVIG dosing schedule.
Duration of Treatment:
The duration of Gamunex -C treatment will include the Gamunex -C PK Phase (up to 4 
weeks) plus the additional Gamunex -C Run -in Phase (up to 4.5 months) for subjects not 
receiving Gamunex -C or not on a stable dose of Gamunex -C upon entering the trial. The 
approximate maximum duration is up to 6 months .
The duration of IVIG -PEG treatment will include the IVIG -PEG Treatment Phase (up to 4.5 
months) and the IVIG -PEG PK Phase (up to 4 weeks), for an approximate maximum of up to 
6 months.
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration
Gamunex -C will be evaluated in this study as a comparator to IVIG -PEG .
The Gamunex -C dose and dosing interval will be individualized based on the previous IVIG 
treatment the subject was receiving for PI during the Screening Visit.
Subjects will receive Gam unex -C by  means of an infusion pump at a dose of 200to 
800mg/kg per infusion at an infusion rate of 1 mg/kg/min or up to 8 mg/kg/min depending 
on subject tolerance. The subject’s usual mg/kg dose (given on either a 3 or 4 week repeating 
schedule) will be the same mg/kg dose and schedule that the subject was receiving prior to 
entering screening. This mg/kg dose and schedule will be used throughout the study  duration. 
Note that the weight of the subject will be measured at each visit and if the subject’s w eight 
changes, the actual weight at each visit will be used to calculate amount of drug (mg) to be 10 of 121

Total IgG concentration will be assessed throughout the study , with total IgG trough PK 
samples taken within 1 hour prior to each IP infusion during the Gam unex -C Run -in and the 
IVIG -PEG T reatment phases. During the Gam unex -C and I VIG-PEG PK phases, total IgG 
PK samples will be taken within 30 minutes prior to the start of the IP infusion, immediately  
upon the completion of the infusion (within 10 minutes of infusion completion), and at 1, 3, 
6, 24, and 48 hours; and 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days (the PK sample drawn at 28 day s applies 
only for subjects on every  4 weeks dosing regimen) after the end of the infusion. A PK 
sample will also be taken at the lastvisit (Final/Early Termination Visit) of any subject s
discontinuing from the study early.
Statistical Methods:
Unless otherwise specified, descriptive statistics will include the number of non -missing 
observations, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum values for 
the continuous/quantitative data or absolute and relative frequency  counts and percentages 
for categorical/qualitative data.
Data handling and evaluation procedures will be described in the Statistical Analy sis Plan 
(SAP).
Primary  Pharmacokinetic Analy ses
Total IgG concentrations will be summarized for IVIG -PEG and Gamunex- C by  each time 
point. I ndividual and mean total IgG concentrations versus time curves will be plotted. PK 
parameters of total IgG will be determined b y noncompartmental PK methods using 
WinNonlin. Steady -state PK parameters to be calculated, as appropriate, or as permitted by  
data, will include AUC, C max, tmax, Cland Vd. All PK parameters will be calculated 
separately for IVIG -PEG and Gamunex- C administration and will be tabulated and 
summarized descriptively. The mean a nd the lower and upper bounds of the 90% confidence 
interval ( CI)will be calculated on ln -transformed AUC parameters. These mean and lower 
and upper bounds will be back -transformed (exponentiated) to provide the geometric mean 
and 90% CI on the original s cale.
Pharmacokinetic anal yses will be performed on the PK population. The Primary  PK 
endpoint sare the steady -state AUC over a dosing interval defined as AUC 0- τ(i.e., the AUC 
over a regular dosing interval (τ) at an approximate stead y-state condition, e ither every  3 
weeks or every  4 weeks, i.e., AUC 0-21daysor AUC 0-28 days , respectivel y) and C max. The 
hypothesis to be tested is that the IV dose of IVIG -PEG will achieve an approximate steady -
state AUC 0-τand Cmaxof total IgG that is bioequivalent to that achieved b y the IV dose of 
Gamunex -C. Bioequivalence of stead y-state IgG AUC and Cmaxbetween IVIG -PEG and 
Gamunex -C will be tested based on established regulatory  guidelines for bioequivalence 
testing. Anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with a mixed -effect model will be used with 
study  PK phase as a fixed effect, the exact administered dose and dose frequency  during the 
PK phase as covariates, and subject as a random effect. The 90% CI of the geometric least-
squares mean (LSM) AUC and Cmaxratio of IVIG -PEG to Gamunex -C will be calculated. 
IVIG -PEG is considered to be bioequivalent to Gamunex -C if the 90% CI  for the geometric 12 of 121

LSM AUC and Cmaxratio of IVIG -PEG to Gamunex -C is within (0.80, 1.25) based on log-
transform ed data.
Depending on the number of subjects being dosed at 3 -or 4-week dosing intervals, subgroup 
analyses may  be performed to evaluate PK variables by  IV dosing interval. Subgroup 
analyses will additionally include age, sex, race, and/or other factors a s appropriate.
Other Pharmacokinetic Analy ses
Other PK parameters will be listed and summarized for IVIG -PEG and Gamunex -C using 
arithmetic as well as geometric means and SD, percentage coefficient of variation (CV), 
median, and minimum/maximum, as appropr iate.
Other PK parameters include stead y-state mean trough concentration of total IgG, T max, Cl, 
and Vd. The stead y-state mean trough concentrations of total IgG will be determined as the 
average value of trough concentration measurements obtained at the P K visit and at 21 or 28 
days after the PK infusion (depending on dosing interval). Descriptive statistics will be 
calculated for the stead y-state mean trough concentration of total IgG and for the t max, Cl, and 
Vd.
Secondary  Efficacy  and Exploratory  variables
Secondary  efficacy  and e xploratory  parameters willbe summarized descriptively . The 
generalized linear model procedure for Poisson regression with log link will be used to 
estimate the SBI rate and its one- sided 99% upper confidence bound. 
Safet y Anal ysis
The safet y analyses will be addressed by  listing and tabulation of AEs (includes suspected 
ADRs [i.e., potentially  related AEs] ), vital signs, phy sical assessments and clinical laboratory  
tests. Data will be described using descriptive analy ses.The safety  anal yses are based on the 
safet y population.
Determination of Sample Size

2BACKGROUND INFORM ATION
A modified Gamunex -C manufacturing process has been developed b y Grifols to produce 
Immune Globulin (Human) 10% (Gamunex -C) PEG process ( IVIG -PEG ). Upon agreement 
with the United States (US) Food and Drug Administration (FDA), a clinical, bioequivalence 
study to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) , safety , and tolerability  of IVIG -PEG with those 
of Gamunex -C in adult subjects with primary  humoral immunodeficiency (PI) has been 
developed . The manufacturing process for Gamunex -C has been revised to produce the test 
product , IVIG -PEG, that contains the same product characteristics as Gamunex- C. 
In addition to the information provided below, please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure 
(IB) and an y additional data supplied by  the sponsor (1).
2.1 Name and Description of the Investigational Product s
IVIG -PEG is a sterile, liquid, highly purified, unmodified, human immunoglobulin (primarily  
immunoglobulin G [IgG]) product intended for intravenous (IV) adm inistration. I VIG-PEG 
is made from large pools of human plasma via modifications of the Immune Globulin 
(Human), 10% Capry late/Chromatograph y Purified Gamunex -C (IVIG -C) manufacturing 
process. 
Gamunex -C, used as a comparator (reference therapy )to IVIG -PEG in this study ,is a read y-
to-use sterile solution of human IgGindicated in the United States (US) for IV administration 
in subjects with PI , primary  immune thrombocy topenia (ITP), and chronic inflammatory  
demy elinating pol yneuropathy  (CIDP). Gamunex -C consists of 9 to 11% IgGin 0.16 to 0.24 
M gl ycine. 
See Section 4.4Study  Treatments for detail.
2.2 Relevant Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Trials
The nonclinical efficacy , PK, safet y and toxicity  profile of IVIG -PEG is similar to Gamunex -
C, as assessed in multiple nonclinical studies:
•In vitro efficacy  studies of opsonophagocy tic killing (OPK) or serum bactericidal killing 
(SBA) of select bacteria IVIG -PEG demonstrate functional activity  comparable to 22 of 121

Gamunex -C. Two virulent pathogens of clinical significance were included: 
Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoni ae)andHaemophilus influenzae (H. influenzae) 
type b.
•In a safety  pharmacology study  in cy nomolgus monkey s with IVIG -PEG doses up to 
2000 mg/kg, no clinically  relevant changes were observed in cardiovascular, respiratory , 
and neurological function.
•In New Zeala nd White rabbits, PKparameters of human IgG were similar between IVIG -
PEG and Gamunex -C comparator following single administration by  either IVor 
subcutaneous (SC) routes at both low and high dose levels. The IV to SC dose adjustment 
factor of 1.37 ×was confirmed using area under the curve concentration (AUC) anal ysis. 
•Safety  of IVIG -PEG was demonstrated in a repeated dose toxicology  study  in Sprague -
Dawley  rats. IVIG -PEG was administered using either IV or SC routes of delivery  at 
doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day  for 5 consecutive day s; these doses were well -tolerated. 
Based on the long half -life of human IgG, these doses were essentiall y cumulative. No 
differences between IVIG-PEG and Gamunex -C were noted in hematology, coagulation, 
clinical chemistry , orurinaly sis parameters. Any  findings were limited to repeated 
exposure to human xenogenic proteins.
•A repeated dose toxicology  study  in New Zealand White rabbits was confounded by  
species -specific adverse effects observed with both IVIG- PEG and Gamunex -C. 
Nonetheless, no differences between IVIG -PEG and Gamunex -C in hematology , 
coagulation, clinical chemistry , or urinal ysis parameters were noted in this study .
2.3 Known and Potential Risks and Benefits to Human Subjects
The PI diseases are a heterogeneous group of disorders in which there is an intrinsic defect in 
the tissues, cells, and/or proteins of the immune system resulting in immune deficiency . 
Many  of these disorders are characterized by  hypogammaglobulinemia and/or defective 
antibody  production and, andas a consequence, increased susceptibility  to infection ( 2).
Administration of poly clonal IGpreparations of human origin, including intravenous 
immunoglobulin ( IVIG), have long been used as replacement therap y in patients with PI(3). 
Administered intravenously , Gamunex -C is indicated as a replacement therapy  for patients 
with PI  to prevent infection. I t is approved in 57 countries worldwide under different trade 
names a nd for several indications. Gamunex -C was initially  approved in 2003 in t he United 
States (US ). This IGpreparation has been extensively  prescribed and confirmed to be safe, 
well-tolerated, and effective. I ts safet y profile is well established with a total number of 
8,159,628 estimated infusions ( 4).
IVIG -PEG results from an improved purification process for Gamunex- C, which allows a 
process simplificat ion as well as an improvement of final product purit y by reducing the 
levels of isoagglutinins (anti-A/anti -B).The manufacturing process developed by  Grifols is 
based on the implementation of an initial PEG precipitation step in the Gamunex -C 
manufacturin g process as a replacement for the capry late precipitation step.23 of 121

The PEG precipitation step has been used in the manufacturing process of another Grifols 
product, Flebogamma®DIF (Instituto Grifols, S.A. Parets del Vallès, Barcelona, Spain) for 
many  years. Flebogamma DIF is another IVIG product manufactured b y Grifols that was first 
authorized for marketing in the US in 2007 ( 5). This change in the manufacturing process of 
Gamunex -C is not expected to change either the structure of the IG, its activity , or the safet y 
of the product.
With the administration of an y IG preparation, there is the potential for acute adverse 
reactions to occur. Sy mptoms observed with the infusion of immunoglobulins include 
transfusion related acute lung injury  (TRALI), py rexia, rigors, cy anosis, hypoxia, 
bronchospasm, hepatic dysfunction, l eukopenia, pancy topenia, tremor, ery thema multiforme, 
epidermoly sis, pulmonary  edema, seizures, hy potension, thrombosis, warmth, flushing, 
urticaria, eczema, back pain, headache, fever, chills, anxiety , malaise, faintness, dizziness, 
nausea, vomiting, musc le and joint pain, abdominal pain, chest pain, chest tightness, isolated 
cases of hemoly sis/hemoly tic anemia, dy spnea, wheezing, tachy cardia, pruritus and rash .
Intravenous IG administration may  result in mild hemoly tic reactions, usually  due to the 
presen ce of anti -A or anti -B isoagglutinins or, less commonly , anti -D or anti -K antibodies. 
These blood group antibodies often result in a slight degree of hemol ysis, mild 
hyperbilirubinemia, and a positive direct Coombs’ test. These events are usually  subclinic al 
(6). The PEG precipitation step in IVIG-PEG manufacturing is aimed to reduce the levels of 
isoagglutinins. 
True anaph ylactic reactions to I VIG may occur in recipients with documented prior histories 
of severe allergic reactions to immunoglobulins. Very  rarel y an anaph ylactoid reaction may  
occur in subjects with no prior history of severe allergic reactions to IG administration. 
Gamunex -C is contrain dicated in individuals with known anaph ylactic or severe s ystemic 
response to Immune Globulin (Human) and in IgA deficient subjects with antibodies against 
IgA and history  of hypersensitivity .
Intravenous IGproducts have been reported to be associated wit h renal dy sfunction, acute 
renal failure, osmotic nephrosis and death ( 7). Subjects predisposed to acute renal failure 
include subjects with an y degree of pre -existing renal insufficiency , diabetes mellitus, age 
greater than 65, volume depletion, sepsis, paraproteinemia, or subjects receiving known 
nephrotoxic drugs. In subjec ts with a predisposition to renal insufficiency , IVIGproducts 
should be administered at the minimum concentration available and at the minimum rate of 
infusion. While these reports of renal d ysfunction and acute renal failure have been 
associated with the use of many  of the licensed I VIGproducts, those products containing 
sucrose as a stabilizer accounted for a disproportionate share of the total number. Gamunex -
C does not contain sucrose but contains glycine, a natural amino acid, as a stabilizer. In 
addition, proper h ydration will be ensured in this study and IVIG will be discontinued if 
signs/sy mptoms of renal insufficiency  develop.
Both IVIG -PEG and Gamunex -Careprepared from human plasma obtained from healthy  
donors. For products of biological origin , the presence of infectious agents cannot be totally  
excluded. However, in the case of products prepared from human plasma, the risk is reduced 
by: (1) epidemiological controls on the donor population and selection of individual donors 24 of 121

2.4 Description of and Justification fo r the Route of A dministration, 
Dosage, Dosage Regimen, and Treatment Phase(s )
2.4.1 Administration of Investigational Produ cts 
IVIG -PEG andGamunex -Cwill be administered intravenousl y (peripheral or central vein) 
through a separate infusion line. Mixing and administration of any  other drug (including 
normal saline) with the supplied product is strictly  prohibited. It is recommended that the 
investigat ional products ( IPs)should initially  be infused at a rate of 0.01 mL/kg /min
(1mg/kg/min) for the first 30 minutes. If well -tolerated, the rate may  be gradually  increased 
to a maximum of 0.08 mL/kg per minute (8 mg/kg/min). If AEs occur, the rate may  be 
reduced or the infusion interrupted until sy mptoms subside. L ack of tolerance at any  given 
rate must be recorded as an adverse event ( AE)at that rate. The infusion may  then be 
resumed at the rate that is tolerable for the subject .
2.4.2 Justification for Selecti on of Doses/Timing of Investigational Products
Gamunex -C is approved in a number of countries for IV administration for a number of 
immune disorders. In general, the recommended IV dosing regimen for PI varies from 
country  to country  from as low as 100 mg/ kg to up to 800 mg/kg per local labeling.
The dose of Gamunex -C and IVIG -PEG for subj ects with PI  is between 200 and 800mg/kg 
body  weight ( 2mL/kg to 8mL/kg) administered every  3 to 4 weeks and will be 
individualized based on each subject’s current IgG r egimen, which is assumed to be an 
effective dose. Subjects are required to have been clinically  stable at a dose of between 
200and 800mg/kg Gamunex -C administered every  3 or 4 weeks, for at least 6 or 5 
consecutive doses respectively , prior to the first dose of IVIG -PEG. Dosing is based on 
current Gamunex -C labeling (8,9).
The dosing schedule has been designed to maintain IgG trough levels ≥500 mg/dL, which are 
considered to be protective as a replacement therapy  in PI subjects ( 8,9).
The recommended initial infusion rate is 0.01 mL /kg/min (1 mg/kg/min). If the infusi on is 
well-tolerated, the rate may  be gradually  increased to a maximum of 0.08 mL/kg/min 
(8mg/kg/min). For subjects judged to be at risk for renal d ysfunction or thrombosis, I P 
infusion should be at the minimum infusion rate practicable.

2.7 Relevant Data and Literature Revie w
2.7.1 Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency
Primary humoral immunodeficiency  diseases are a family  of congenital disorders of the 
immune sy stem that lead to an increase in frequency  of infections, notably, but not limited to, 
bacterial infections of the respiratory  tract ( 2). Results from a recent study  suggest that in the 
US alone, 1 in 2,000 children and 1 in 1,200 persons (including adults and children) are 
diagnosed with PI , yielding a total US PI patient population estima te of approximately  
250,000 adults and children ( 10). Worldwide upper estimates suggest that 6 million people 
(638,000 in Europe alone ) may  be living with a PI, although onl y a fraction of these patients 
have been identified in registries ( 11). Patients with inherited deficiencies leading to 
impaired humora l immunity  are highl y susceptible to a wide range of infections, most 
commonly  bacterial infections. The efficacy  of IgG replacement therapy  in the treatment of 
these disorders has been well established ( 12,13) since 1952 when the use of serum globulin 
fraction was reported to reduce the freque ncy of infections in a patient with 
agammaglobulinemia ( 14). 
Although PI was the first US FDA- approved indication for IG therap y, it is becoming 
increasingl y recognized for the treatment of other immunodeficiency  diseases for which B -
cell function and antibody production are implicated in the immunodeficiency , but for which 
the role is not clearl y identified. Although the prevalence of subjects with 
immunodeficiencies is very  low, IG therapy  is vital for minimizing potentially  fatal 
infections and improving quality  of life and overall clinical outcomes ( 15). 
2.7.2 Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency Treatment
Immune globulin therap y is the mainstay  of treatment for a variet y of PI states ,and it is 
indicated for most PI diseases in accordance with recommendations from expert guidelines
(3,20,21). A systematic literature review performed by  the American Academy  of Allergy , 
Asthma & Immunology  designated IVIG and subcutaneous immunoglobulin (SCI G) as 
definitely  beneficial therapies across several PI diseases with an evidence category  IIb and 
strength of recommendation B (3).
The therapeutic management of PI  has been carried out via intramuscular (IM), IV, and SC 
injections of various IG preparatio ns (16,17). Patients with mild PI  were historically  treated 26 of 121

with IGadministered via the I M route up to a maximum dose of 25 mg/kg/wk , limiting the 
dose administration in subjects with more severe forms of deficiency  who required higher 
doses . Intravenous preparations allow edfor the treatment of subjects with severe PI disease 
(i.e., X- linked agammaglobulinemia [XL A], and common variable immunodeficiency  
[CVID]) with higher doses of IG ( 18); however, theefficacy of IVIG for treatment of IgG 
subclass deficiency , with or without IgA deficiency , is uncertain. S ubcutaneous infusion of 
IG is considered an effective alternative to IVtherapy , with the convenience of at home 
dosing ( 19).
2.7.3 Isoagglutinins and Hemolytic Adverse Events
Antibody -mediated hemoly sis is a rare AE of IVIG products. Clinically  significant hemoly tic
reactions reported after IVIG infusion have been attributed to isoagglutinins, antibodies 
present in IVIG products that react with red blood cell (RBC) antigens of the Rh and ABO 
blood group s ystems ( e.g., anti-Rh(D), anti -A, anti -B).The hemol ytic reactio ns range from 
mild cases in which there may  be a positive direct antiglobulin test ( DAT , Coombs’ test) to 
acute severe cases in which intravascular hemol ysis can cause hemoglobinemia (excess of 
hemoglobin in the plasma ), hemoglobinuria , and renal damage/dy sfunction ( 22-31).
An investigati on of 1000 patients receiving IVIG identified 16 cases of hemoly sis (1.6 
percent) in which females, non -O blood ty pe subjects, and subjects receiving high- dose IVIG 
infusions ( e.g., >100 grams) were at the greatest risk for hemoly sis (23,32, 33). The onset of 
hemoly sis ranged from 12 hours to 10 day s with a mean decrease in hemoglobin of 3.2 g/dL
and over half of the patients presented with t hese risk factors.
In addition, it has bee n reported that dividing the total I VIG dose into 4 or 5 doses 
administered on consecutive day s may  minimize the occurrence of hemolysis ( 34).
The purpose of the IVIG -PEG manufacturing change is to reduce the levels of isoagglutinins 
in the final product in order to reduce the chance of antibody  mediated hemoly sis occurring 
post-administration. The process changes are focused on the replacement of the capry late 
precipitation step b y a PEG precipitation step. To date, consistency of the IVIG -PEG process 
has been evaluated with 3 different processes at clinical scale (approximately  3500 L plasma 
equivalent) that demonstrate that the proposed process chang es consistently result in a 10% 
IVIG product with reduced levels of isoagglutinins while maintaining the current product 
characteristics and safet y profile.
A detailed study  of the isoagglutinin reduction capacity  of the process has been conducted. 
For thi s purpose, a new method for Anti A/B isoagglutinins determination by  flow cytometry  
has been developed, allowing an increased sensitivity . The process has also been followed 
with a DAT. The results confirmed the capacity  of the process to reduce isoaggluti nins, 
reaching lower levels than are currentl y present in Gamunex -C. In addition, a full 
characterization study  has been conducted including purit y, functionality, process, and 
product related carry  over constituents, antibodies titers, and procoagulant ac tivity . The 
results of these studies do not show significant variations due to the IVIG- PEG process.27 of 121

Effective
Decreasing the presence of isoagglutinins in IVIG products through manufacturing changes 
has been recommended to decrease in the incidence of hemol ysis ass ociated with I VIG 
administration ( 35). The PEG precipitation step in the IVIG -PEG manufacturing process can 
further reduce isoagglutinin levels in the final product compared to Gamunex -C, which in 
turn may  have an effect on the incidence of hemoly tic AEs. Events of hemoly sis in this study
will therefore be treated as events of special interest.

This is a P hase 3, multicenter, open -label, single -sequence , cross -over, bioequivalence 
clinical study to assess the steady -state PK, safet y, and tolerability  of IVIG -PEG compared 
with Gamunex -Cin adult subjects with PI . A total of approximately  35 adult subjects in 
which a minimum of 6 subjects are planned to be enrolled in each dosing interval ( i.e., 3-
week dosing interval vs 4 -week dosing interval) will be enrolled in order to have 20 
evaluable subjects for PK anal ysis.
The study  will include a Screening Phase of approximately  28 day s, aGamunex -CRun-in
Phase (IV administration of Gamunex -C) of up to 4.5 months, a Gamunex -CPK Phase of 3 
or4 weeks, an IVIG -PEG Treatment Phase of up to 4.5months, an IVIG-PEG PK Phase of 3 
or 4 weeks , and a Final Visit/Early  Termination visit. 
Prior to enrollment into the study , subjects with PI currently  receiving IVIG replacement

Depending on their current I VIG treatment regimen, eligible subjects may  be required to 
enter the Gamunex -C Run-inPhase to receive Gamunex -C treatment ( sponsor provided) to 
achieve an approximate steady -state condition prior to entering the Gamunex -C PK Phase. 
Subjects meeting the following conditions are required to enter the Run-inPhase
(Section 4.2.2.1):
Not currentl y receiving Gamunex -C 
Not on a stable dose of Gamunex- C 
Not receiving Gamunex -C every  3 weeks or 4 weeks 
After reaching a stable dose and approximate steady -state ( i.e., administration of 5 
consecutive doses of Gamunex -C for subjects on every  4weeks dosing regimen and 6 
consecutive doses of Gamunex -C for subjects on every  3 weeks dosing regimen), the subjects 
will then enter the Ga munex -C PK Phase to determine the AUC profile of IV infusions of 
Gamunex -C.
Subjects receiving Gamunex -C at Screening who have been stable for 4.5 to 5 months ( i.e., 
administration of at least 5 consecutive stable doses for subjects on every  4weeks dosin g 
regimen and administration of at least 6 consecutive stable doses for subjects on every  3 
weeks dosing regimen) at doses between 200and 800 mg/kg prior to the Screening Visit will 
directly  enter the Gamunex -C PK Phase.
After the Screening Phase or Gamun ex-C Run-inPhase, subjects will enter the Gamunex -C
PK Phase of 3-or 4-weeks duration depending on the individual dosing interval. PK samples 
will be drawn 30 minutes prior to the start of the PK Phase Gamunex -Cinfusion, 
immediately  upon the completion of the PK Phase Gamunex -Cinfusion (within 10 minutes 
of infusion completion), and at 1, 3, 6, 24, and 48 hours; and 4, 7, 14, 21, and 28 day s (the 
PK sample drawn at 28 day s applies only  for subjects on every  4 weeks dosing regimen) after 
the end of the PK Phase Gamunex -Cinfusion.
After the completion of the Gamunex -CPK Phase, subjects will enter the IVIG -PEG
Treatment Phase . Subjects will receive a total of 5 or 6 consecutive doses of IVIG -PEG
according to the subject’s previous Gamunex -Cdosing interval ( i.e., administration of 5 
consecutive doses for subjects on the every  4 weeks regimen and administration of 6 
consecutive doses for subjects on the every  3 weeks regimen).
Trough IgG levels will be obtained prior to all infusions in the Screening, Gam unex -CRun-
in,and IVIG -PEG Treatment Phase s. 
At the conclusion o fthe IVIG -PEG Treatment Phase ( i.e., after 5 or 6 infusions of IVIG -PEG
depending on the individual dosing interval), subjects will enter into the IVIG -PEG PK Phase 
lasting 3 or 4 weeks in duration depending on the individual dosing interval. Pharmacokinetic 
samples will be drawn 30 mi nutes prior to the start of the IVIG -PEG infusion in the PK 
Phase, immediately  upon the completion of the PK Phase  IVIG -PEG infusion (within 10 31 of 121

Furthermore, any subject who seprior dosing frequency  was not every  3 to 4 weeks will be 
adjusted to one of these two frequency  options by  their phy sician during the Run-in Phase
also to ensure that they  receive the same dose as with their previous immunog lobulin 
product .  
During the Run -in Phase, subjects will receive an individualized dose of Gamunex -C 
between 200 to 800 mg/kg that treating ph ysicians consider appropriate compared to their 
previous IVIG treatment regimen. The subject’s usual mg/kg dose ( given on either a 3 or 4 
week repeating schedule) will be the same mg/kg dose and schedule that the subject was 
receiving prior to entering screening. This mg/kg dose and schedule will be used throughout 
the study  duration. Note that the weight of the subj ect will be measured at each visit and if 
the subject’s weight changes, the actual weight at each visit will be used to calculate amount 
of drug (mg) to be administered . The first 3 consecutive doses of Gamunex- C during the 
Run-in Phase (visits #1, #2, and #3) can be adjusted as needed b y treating physicians to 
achieve a stable dose for subjects, and then such stable dose should be maintained throughout 
the remainder of the Run -in Phase (visits #4, #5, and #6). Doses during visits #4, #5, and #6 
cannot vary from each other or from the dose given during visit #3 by  more than 20%. 
Subjects who cannot achieve a stable dose of Gamunex -C during the Run- in Phase may  not 
continue to the Gamunex -C PK P hase and will be withdrawn from the study (see 
Section 5.3.2).

4.3 Measures Taken to Minimize/Avoid Bias
4.3.1 Subject Numbering
Within each study  site, subjects in the study  will receive a consecutive subject number. 
Subject numbers are generated beginning with the study  center number (3 digits, assigned by  
the sponsor) followed consecutively  with a unique number for each subject (4 digits, 
including leading zeros). For example, if the Investigator s’ center number is 301, subject 
number will be 3010001, 3010002, 3010003, etc., in consecutive order. Subject numbers, 
once assigned, will not be reused at an y center.
4.3.2 Randomization
This is an open- label, single -sequence, cross -over study  design, therefore ran domization is 
not applicable.
4.3.3 Blinding
Blinding is not applicable for this study .
4.4 Stud y Treatments
4.4.1 Treatments to Be Administered
IVIG -PEG and Gamunex -C (reference therap y) will be adm inistered during this study .
4.4.1.1 IVIG-PEG
IVIG-PEG is a 10% solution of purified human IgG made from large pools of human plasma 
via modifications of the Gamunex -Cmanufacturing process. IVIG -PEG is a sterile, liquid, 
highl y purified, unmodified human IgG prod uct intended for IV administration. In this study , 
administration of IVIG -PEG will be via the IV route only .
IVIG-PEG consists of 9 to 11% IgGin 0.16 to 0.24 M gl ycine. IVIG-PEG 10% may be 
supplied in vial sizes of 10, 25, 50, 100, 200 and 400 mL .For this study , IVIG -PEG will be 
supplied in 100 mL  vials.
4.4.1.2 Gamunex -C
Gamunex -C is a read y-to-use sterile solution of human IgGprotein for IV or SC 
administration. Gamunex -C is a licensed product. Gamunex -C vials may  be supplied in the 
vial sizes of 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mL . In this study , administration of Gamunex -C will be 
via the IV route onl y.
Gamunex -Cconsists of 9 to 11% IgGin 0.16 to 0.24 M gl ycine. The buffering capacit y of 
Gamunex -Cis 35.0 mEq/L (0.35 mEq/g protein). A dose of 1 g/kg bod y weight therefore 
represents an acid load of 0.35 mEq/kg bod y weight. The total buffering capacity of whole 
blood in a normal indi vidual is 45 to 50 mEq/L  of blood, or 3.6 mEq/kg body  weight. Thus, 38 of 121

the acid load delivered with a dose of 1 g/kg of Gamunex -Cwould be neutralized by  the 
buffering capacity  of whole blood alone, even if the dose was infused instantaneously (4).
4.4.2 Labeling of Investigational Products
Investigational products will be labeled according to the requirements of local law and 
legislation. Label text will be approved according to agreed Grifols’ procedures and a cop y 
of the labels will be made available to each individual study site.
4.4.3 Packaging of Investigational Products
The sponsor will be responsible for ensuring that the I P is manufactured in accordance with 
applicable current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and requirements.
4.4.4 Storage of Investigational Products
IVIG -PEG and Gamunex -Cmust be stored in a secure area accessible to study personnel 
authorized by  the Investigator , such as the study  staff re sponsible for the preparation and 
dispensing of IPs.
IVIG -PEG and Gamunex -Cmay be stored for up to 36 months from the date of manufacture 
at 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F) . The product smay be stored at temperatures not exceeding 25°C 
(77°F) for up to 6 months any time during the shelf life from date of manufacture , after 
which the product must be used immediatel y or discarded. Do not freeze. All partially  used 
vials should be discarded as no preservative is present. Do not use after expiration date. 
Investigators, or designees, are responsible for maintaining storage temperature logs and for 
immediately  reporting deviations in temperature to the monitor.
Details for the storage are located in the pharmacy manual provided to each study  site.
4.5 Expected Duration of Subject Participation in the Study
The study  consists of a Screening Phase (up to 28 day s), a Gamunex -C Run-inPhase (up to 
4.5 months) for subjects not currentl y receiving Gamunex -C or not on a stable dose of 
Gamunex -C, a Gamunex -C PK Phase (up to 4 weeks), an IVIG -PEG Treatment Phase (up to 
4.5 months), an IVIG -PEG PK Phase (up to 4 weeks), and a Final Visit/Early  Termination 
Visit. The expected duration of a subject’s participation in this study will be up to 54 weeks 
depending on dosing frequency  and Run-i n Phase requirement.

4.6.2 Premature Termination of Study/Closure of Center
The sponsor, Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (I RB/EC), and/or regulatory  
authorities have the right to close this study  or a study  center, and the Investigator /sponsor 
has the right to close a center, at an y time, although this should occur only  after consultation 
between involved parties. The I RB/EC must be informed. Should the study/center be closed 
prematurel y, all study  materials (except documentation that has to remain stored at site) must 
be returned to the sponsor. The Investigator will retain all other documents until notification 
given b y the sponsor for destruction.
The reasons a study  center can b e closed include, but are not limited to ,the following 
reasons:
•Lack of enrollment 
•Non-compliance with the requirements of the study protocol
•Non-compliance with I CH GCP
4.6.2.1 Study Stopping Rules
As a conservative measure, if 5 subjects on IVIG -PEG develop a serious adverse event 
(SAE) of exactl y the same type ( i.e., the same MedDRA [Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  
Activities] preferred term) which is not an infection or manifestation of an underly ing 
disorder documented in medical history , then this would c onstitute an unanticipated 
clustering which could signal a potential safety  concern. If this situation were to arise, the 
Sponsor will constitute a Safety  Review Committee (SRC) whose members (from Grifols) 
will be impartial and independent of the clinical trial team. In cases where there is a clear 
medical plausibility  supporting an uncommon clustering of SAEs of the same ty pe (not 
including infections), and these sentinel SAEs are designated as ‘definitel y related’, 
‘probabl y related’, or ‘possibly  relate d’ by  both the Investigator and the SRC, consideration 
would be given to possibly  discontinuing the study .
Furthermore, if an y of the two following situations occur for subjects on IVIG -PEG: 
•Three or more subjects develop at least a 50% decrease in trough IgG level from 
Screening or initiation of the first infusion, whichever is lower, and IVIG -PEG is 
correctly  dosed in terms of mg/kg dosage and treatment interval in all cases.
•Study  subjects develop a total of 6 independent and temporally  distinct SBIs while on 
IVIG -PEG given at the correct dose and treatment time interval.
All subsequent infusions of IVIG -PEG will be temporaril y suspended in all study subjects 
and the SRC convene to consider whether to discontinue the study  or not in agreement with 
the PI . 
If the SRC and Investigator decision is to discontinue the study  due to any  of the 
circumstances described above, all subjects will complete a Final Visit/Early  Termination 
Visit before initiation of treatment with a licensed IVIG.40 of 121

6TREATMENT OF SUBJECT S
See Section 4.4for the treatments to be administered, including the names of all the products, 
the doses, the dosing schedules, the route/modes of administration .
6.1 Administration and Timing of Investigational Products for Each 
Subject
The Gamunex -C dose and dosing interval during the Run -in Phase or Gamunex -C PK P hase 
will be individualized based on the previous IVIG treatment the subject was receiving for PI 
during the Screening Phase . During the IVIG -PEG phase s, the IVIG -PEG dose and dosing 
interval will be individualized based on the previous Gamunex -C treatment the subject was 
receiving for PI either during the Screening Phase or at the end of the Gamunex -C Run-in
Phase (for subjects not directl y entering the Gam unex -C PK Phase).
Subjects will receive IVIG-PEG and Gamunex -Cby means of an infusion pump at a dose of 
200to 800mg/kg per infusion at an infusion rate of 1 mg/kg/min or up to 8 mg/kg/min 
depending on subject tolerance. The subject’s usual mg/kg dose (given on either a 3 or 4 
week repeating schedule) will be the same mg/kg dose and schedule that the subject was 
receiving prior to entering screening. This mg/kg dose and schedule will be used throughout 
the study  duration. Note that the weight of the subje ct will be measured at each visit and if 
the subject’s weight changes, the actual weight at each visit will be used to calculate amount 
of drug (mg) to be administered. IVIG -PEG and Gamunex -Cwill be administered every  3 
weeks (±4 day s) or 4 weeks ( ±4 day s), depending on the subject’s prior IVIG dosing 
schedule. 
Subjects currentl y on stable Gamunex -C (for administration of at least 5 consecutive doses) 
will directly  enter the Gamunex -C PK P hase, followed b y the IV IG-PEG Treatment Phase in 
which they  will r eceive 5 or 6 consecutive doses of IVIG- PEG according to their previous 
dosing regimen (every  4 weeks or every  3 weeks, respectivel y) and IVIG -PEG PK Phase. 
Subjects currentl y on IV IG therap y other than Gamunex -C or on Gamunex -C treatment but 
not at a stab le dose of 200 to 800mg/kg per infusion or not at every  3-or 4-week intervals 
will receive Gamunex -C for approximately  4.5months during the Run -inPhase, prior to the

chloride) administration kit prepared b y qualified personnel, working to local standard 
operating procedures and under aseptic conditions.
IVIG -PEG and Gamunex-C will be brought to room temperature before each infusion. The 
nurse performing the infusion should verify  by touch that the temperature of product is 
approximately  room temperature. Heating devices should not be used to bring product to 
room temperature.
6.2 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
Concomitant medications must be recorded in the subject’s source documents and eCRF, 
including the trade and generic names of the medication, the dose, the route of 
administration, and the duration of the medication (frequency ).
Use of proph ylactic antibiotics must be recorded as appropriate in the subject’s medical 
records and eCRF todistinguish between proph ylactic use and use for treatment of an 
episode of infection .
6.2.1 Prohibited Medications Prior to Stu dy Participation
Use of the following medications excludes a subject from participating in this study :
•Received an y investigational product, with the exception of other IgG products, within 
the previous 3 months prior to the Screening Visit
•At the time of Screening , receiving s ystemic corticosteroids ( i.e., long -term daily  doses 
>1 mg of prednisone equivalent/kg/day  for >30 day s; intermittent courses not exceeding 
1mg of prednisone equivalent/kg/day  for >30 days would not exclude the subject )
Note: I nhaled or topical corticosteroids are allowed
•At the time of Screening , receiving immunosuppressants including chemotherapeutic 
agents or immunomodulators
•Clinically  significant drug or alcohol abuse or dependence in the opinion of the 
Investigator (must be with in the past 12 months and noted in the subject’s medical 
records or documented at Screening) excludes a subject from participating in this study
6.2.2 Prohibited Concomitant Medications during the Study
All concomitant medications used and therapies received b y subjects will be recorded on the 
appropriate subject ’smedical records and eCRF page. Use of the following medications is 
prohibited during stud y participation:
•Any IgG replacement therapy  other than IVIG -PEG or Gamunex -C provided in this study
with the exception of the screening visit, when subjects will receive their usual IVIG 
treatment
•Investigational products not included in this study46 of 121

6.2.3 Restricted Concomitant Medications during the Study
This section describes medications that are restricted, but not prohibited during stud y 
participation. Subjects cannot receive routine premedication during this study . Adequate 
hydration will be administered to all subjects prior to initiation of infusion with I VIG-PEG. If 
a subject who previously  required premedication is to be enrolled, they  must start this study  
without routine premedication. The previous use of premedication as well as the AE for 
which the premedication was used must be recorded on the subject ’smedical records and 
Screening eCRF page. If an AE which may  be prevented by  the use of a premedication 
occurs 2 or 3 times, the AE must be documented on the subject ’smedical records and 
appropriate eCRF page, and use of the premedication may  beresumed for the remaining 
study  infusions of the same product ( i.e., subjects who required premedication in the 
Gamunex -C Run -in period should start the IVIG -PEG period without using premedic ation).
The medications listed below are not allowed during the study  as premedication (unless after 
2 or 3 times occurrence as explained above) to an infusion; however ,these medications are 
allowed during the stud y for general use ( e.g., to treat an AE):
Acetaminophen
Antihistamines
NSAIDs
Steroids (provided dosing is as outlined in Section 6.2.1)
When premedication is needed, it is recommended that premedication is started using 
acetaminophen or/and antihis tamines, and that NSAIDS as well as steroids are used onl y if 
the sy mptoms are not controlled appropriately with acetaminophen or/and antihistamines.
Note:When premedication is administered, the medication will need to be entered into the 
eCRF each time t hat it is administered. The premedication should not be entered into 
the eCRF only  once with the frequency  of as needed (PRN) .
6.2.4 Drug Interactions
In the setting of a PI disease state, live viral vaccines have various contraindications and 
specific risks/deg rees of effectiveness dependent on the ty pe/category  of the immune 
deficiency  (35). Subjects may  not have received any  live virus vaccine within the 5 months 
prior to the Screening Visit (as per exclusion criterion 17). Passive transfer of antibodies 
from IVIG -PEG or Gamunex -Cmay transientl y interfere with the immune response to live 
viral vaccines such as measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella in the norm al host with an 
intact immune sy stem. Best medical practices should be followed regarding immunization 
requirements.47 of 121

8.3 Procedures for Eliciting Reports of and for Recording and 
Reporting A dverse Event and Intercurrent Illnesses
8.3.1 Warnings/Precautions
Forcomplete information on IVIG -PEG refer to the IB.
8.3.2 Adverse Event Monitoring
Subjects must be carefully monitored for AEs. This monitoring includes clinical and 
laboratory  tests and ph ysical signs and s ymptoms. Adverse events should be assessed in 
terms of their seriousness, severit y, and causal relationship to the I P. 
Adverse events will be elicited by  spontaneous reporting by  the study  individual or by  a non-
leading inquiry  or direct observation by  the study  staff. 
8.3.3 Adverse Event Definitions
8.3.3.1 Adverse Event s 
An AE is defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product or stud y treatment and which does not necessaril y 
have a causal relationship with this administration. An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including an y abnormal laboratory  finding, for example), sy mptom, or 
disease temporall y associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered 
related to the medicinal product.
Infusional AEs ( i.e., AEs temporally  associated with an infusion of I P) will be defined and 
reported. An y AE occurred during infusion or within 72 hours after completion of infusion 
will be considered temporally associated with the infusion and labelled as infusiona l AEs.
8.3.3.2 Suspected Adverse Drug Reactions/Adverse Reactions
All noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product or study  treatment related to 
any dose should be considered suspected ADRs ( i.e., potentially  related AE). The phrase 
“responses to a medi cinal product” means that a causal relationship between a medicinal 
product or stud y treatment and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility . 
8.3.4 Assessment of Causality of Adverse Event
The Investigator is required to provide a causalit y assessment for each AE reported to the 
Sponsor. The Sponsor will consider the Investigator’s causality  assessment and also provide 
its own assessment. 
Causal relationship to the I Ps will be established according to medical judgment on whether 
there is a reasonable possibili ty of a causal relationship between the AE and IP 
administration .67 of 121

Humoral Immunodeficiency
Effective
The Investigator must determine and classify  the AE causalit y according to the following 
categories:
Unrelated/Not related: there is not a reasonable possibility  of causal relationship between 
the AE and the IP.
Possibly related: there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the I P and the 
AE.
Definitely related: there is a reason to conclude that the I P caused t he AE.
Criteria to assess the causal relationship should take into account of the following conditions: 
1) a plausible temporal sequence from the IP administration to the AE onset; 2) whether the 
event follows a known response pattern to the suspected trea tment; 3) whether the AE could 
be reasonabl y explained by the subject’s clinical state, comorbidities, or concomitant 
medications, as well as 4) the occurrence of improvement on stopping/reducing the treatment 
(positive dechallenge) and/or reappearance of the event on repeated exposure (positive 
rechallenge).
For expedited safety reporting purposes, AEs assessed as either “definitively  related” or 
“possibly  related” will be considered POTENTIALLY RELATED or just REL ATED.
For an y subject, all AEs that occur at an y time from the beginning of IP administration until 
the final visit of the study will be considered treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs).
8.3.5 Severity of Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction
Adverse events and suspected ADRs ( i.e., potentially rela ted AEs) will be classified 
depending on their severity  according to the following definitions:
Mild : an AE which is well tolerated by  the subject, causing minimum degree of malaise and 
without affecting normal activities.
Moderate : an AE that interferes w ith the subject’s normal activities.
Severe : an AE that prevents the subject from performing their normal activities.
Adverse event and suspected ADR (i.e., potentially  related AE) severity  gradation must be 
distinguished from AE and suspected ADR seriousn ess gradation, which is defined according 
to event consequence. For example, headache can be mild, moderate or severe but not 
necessarily  serious in all these cases.
The Investigator will be responsible for assessing the AE and suspected ADR intensity  
during the study , taking into account current criteria included in this section.68 of 121

8.3.6 Expectedness of Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction
An AE or suspected ADR ( i.e., potentially  related AE) is considered “unexpected” if the 
nature, seriousness, sever ity or outcome of the reaction(s) is not consistent with the reference 
information. The expectedness shall be determined by  the Sponsor according to the reference 
document for an y serious ADRs (potentially  related SAEs) for expedited safety  reporting 
purpo ses. 
8.3.7 Seriousness of Adverse Event or Suspected Adverse Drug Reaction  
An AE or suspected ADR ( i.e., potentially  related AE) is considered “serious” if, in the view 
of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any  of the following outcomes: 
•Death
•Life-threatening AE (life -threatening in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hy potheticall y might have caused death if it were more severe)
•In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
•A persistent or significant incapacit y or substantial disruption of the ability  to conduct 
normal life functions 
•A congenital anomal y/birth defect
•An important medical event (important medical event in the definition of “serious” refers 
to those events which may not be immediatel y life -threatening, or result in death, or 
hospitalization, but from medical and scientific judgment may  jeopardize the subject 
or/and may  require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed above).
* Hospitalization is to be considered onl y hospital admission (including emergency room 
stay) for equal or more than 24 hours. The following hospitalizations should not be 
reported as SAEs:
-Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization needed for procedures required by 
the study protocol, or as part of a routine procedure followed by  the center.
-Admissions not associated with an AE ( e.g., social hospitalization for the purpose of 
respite care survey  visits or annual phy sicals).
-Elective or pre -planned hospitalizations for a pre -existing condition that had not 
worsened from Baseline ( e.g., elective or scheduled surgery  arranged prior to start of 
the study ).
This definition permits e ither the Sponsor or the Investigator to decide whether an event is 
“serious”. If either the Sponsor or the Investigator believes that the event is serious, the event 
must be considered “serious” and evaluated b y the Sponsor for expedited reporting. 69 of 121

8.3.8 Adver se Event Documentation
All AEs and SAEs occurring after the subject has signed the ICF through the Final Visit 
(i.e., end of study) must be fully  recorded in the subject’s source documentation and eCRF, 
and in the SAE form (if serious) as well as in the me dical record. If no AE has occurred 
during the stud y phase, this should also be indicated in the eCRF.
It is the responsibility  of the I nvestigator to ensure that AEs are appropriately  recorded.
At each visit, AEs will be elicited b y asking the individual a non -leading question such as 
“Do you feel different in any way  since the last visit?” Moreover, AEs will also be collected 
through directl y observed events or spontaneously volunteered b y the subject. Clearl y related 
signs, s ymptoms and abnormal diagnost ic procedures should preferabl y be grouped together 
and recorded as a single diagnosis or s yndrome wherever possible.
The following variables must be recorded in the AE CRF/eCRF and the subject’s source 
documents:
•The verbatim term (a diagnosis is preferred)
•Date/time of onset
•Date/time of resolution
•Severity  (mild, moderate, severe)
•Causality  (unrelated, possibly  related, definitel y related)*
•Seriousness (y es, no)
•Action taken (with regard to I P)
•Other action (to treat the event)
•Outcome and sequelae (follow -up on AE)
*Causality  assessment will be made only  when the AE occurs after the subject has initiated at 
least one infusion of the IP. An AE occurring before subject's exposure to IP will be alway s 
labeled as "unrelated".
For AEs that occur during infusions, the infusion rate in effect at the time of onset of the AE 
(if applicable), the time of onset of the AE and the time of AE change materially  in intensity  
and/or resolve will be captured in the eCRF and the subject’s source document. 
In addition to the I nvestigator’s own description of the AEs, each AE will be encoded 
according to the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA).
For example, a laboratory test abnormality  considered clinically  significant, e.g., causing the 
subject to wi thdraw from the study , requiring treatment or causing apparent clinical 
manifestations, or judged clinically significant in the context of the subject’s medical history  
by the Investigator, should be reported as an AE. Each event must be described in detai l 70 of 121

along with start and stop dates, severit y, relationship to IP, action taken and outcome. Each 
event must be adequatel y supported by documentation as it appears in the subject’s medical 
or case file.
8.3.9 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events 
8.3.9.1 Reporting of Serio us Adverse Events
Any SAE (see Section 8.3.7) that occurs after signing the study ICF through the Final 
Visit ( i.e., end of study) must be expeditio usly reported whether or not considered 
attributable to the I P. Each SAE must be fully  recorded in the subject’s medical records and 
the CRF/eCRF and SAE Report Form. 
In addition, any  SAE that occurs in a subject after their last study  visit should be reported 
only to Grifols Global Pharmacovigilance if the Investigator becomes aware of the event and 
feels that it is related to the use of IP.
SAEs will be reported using the designated paper SAE Report Form. When the I nvestigator 
becomes aware of an SAE, she/he must submit a completed, signed and dated SAE Report 
Form (in English) within 24 hours to the Sponsor by  email/fax. The date of this SAE 
discovery  by the site staff should be documented in the source documents ( i.e., medical 
records).
Each SAE report ed must be followed up until resolution or stabilization. After the initial 
report, all relevant information for SAE follow- up, and for the outcome, must also be 
supplied to the Sponsor in a timely  manner (within 3 day s from its identification or within 24
hours for relevant new information) b y means of the SAE Report Form. In addition, the 
Sponsor or CRO may request additional information and/or reports.
All SAE Report Forms must be reported to Grifols by  email to:
Grifols Global Pharmacovigilance
Email: 
FAX (back -up onl y): (US/Canada )
(International)
When required, and according to local law and regulations, SAEs must be reported to the 
IRB/EC and regulatory  authorities.

exposure. The Investigator must report an y pregnancy  that occurs in a s tudy subject 
subsequent to informed consent until 28 day s after the last dose of IP. 
A pregnancy  will not be considered an AE, unless a relation to the IP is suspected. In an y 
case, a Pregnancy Report Form must be completed and sent as soon as possible tothe 
Sponsor. A copy  of the form should be filed at the study site for follow -up until the end of 
the pregnancy . Any pregnancy  must be followed by  the Investigator until delivery  or to the 
end of pregnancy . Any anomalies, complications, abnormal outcomes, or birth defect 
observed in the child must be reported as an SAE within 24 hours of the Investigator or study  
personnel’s first knowledge. 
Please use the email address or fax numbers (back up only ) in Section 8.3.9.1 for reporting

Pregnancy  exposures that result in AEs/SAEs should be followed by  the Investigator until 
delivery  or to the end of pregnancy .
8.4 Type and Duration of the Follow -Up of Subjects after Adverse 
Events 
Insofar as is possible, all individuals will be followed up until the AE or suspected ADR ( i.e., 
potentially  related AE) has been resolved. If an AE/suspected ADR/SAE is present when the 
subject has completed the study , the course of the event must be followed until the final 
outcome is known, or the event has been stabilized and no further change is expected, and the 
Investigator decides that no further follow -up is necessary .
Any SAE that occurs after the end of the study  or after stud y completion due to earl y 
termination will not be actively  collected. However, if such cases are reported by  the 
Investigator as related to the study  treatment, they  will be considered for expedited reporting 
purposes.

9.1.2 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Total IgG concentrations will be summarized for IVIG-PEG and Gamunex- C by  each time 
point. I ndividual and mean total IgG concentrations versus time curves will be plotted. 
Pharmacokinetic parameters of total IgG will be determined b y noncompartmental PK 
methods using WinNonlin. Steady -state PK parameters to be calculated, as appropriate, or as 
permitted by  data, will include AUC, C max, tmax, Cl, and V d. All PK parameters will be 
calculated separatel y for IV IG-PEG and Gamunex-C administration and will be tabulated 
and summarized descriptively . The mean and the lower and upper bounds of the 90% CI wi ll 
be calculated on natural log-transformed AUC parameters. These mean and lower and upper 
bounds will be back -transformed (exponentiated) to provide the geometric mean and 90% CI 
on the original scale.
Pharmacokinetic anal yses will be performed on the PK population. The Primary  PK 
endpoint sare the steady -state AUC over a dosing interval defined as AUC 0-τ(i.e., the AUC 
over a regular dosing interval (τ) at an approximate stead y-state condition, either every  3 
weeks or every  4 weeks, i.e., AUC 0-21 days or AUC 0-28 days , respectivel y) and C max. The 
hypothesis to be tested is that the IV dose of IVIG -PEG will achieve an approximate steady -
state AUC 0-τand Cmaxof total IgG that is bioequivalent to that achieved b y the IV dose of 
Gamunex -C. Bioequivalence of steady -state IgG AUC and Cmaxbetween IVIG -PEG and 
Gamunex -C will be tested based on established regulatory  guidelines for bioequivalence 
testing. Anal ysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with a mixed -effect model will be used with 
study  PK phase as a fixed effect, t he exact administered dose and dose frequency  during the 
PK phase as covariates, and subject as a random effect. The 90% CI of the geometric least-
squares mean (LSM) AUC and Cmaxratio of IVIG -PEG to Gamunex -C will be calculated. 
IVIG -PEG is considered to be bioequivalent to Gamunex -C if the 90% CI  for the geometric 
LSM AUC and Cmaxratio of IVIG -PEG to Gamunex -C is within (0.80, 1.25) based on log-
transformed data.
Other PK parameters will be listed and summarized for IVIG -PEG and Gamunex -C using 
arithmeti c as well as geometric means and SD, percentage coefficient of variation (CV), 
median, and minimum/maximum, as appropriate.
Other PK parameters include stead y-state mean trough concentration of total IgG, T max, Cl, 
and V d. The stead y-state mean trough conc entrations of total IgG will be determined as the 
average value of trough concentration measurements obtained at the PK visit and at 21 or 28 
days after the PK infusion (depending on dosing interval). Descriptive statistics will be 
calculated for the stead y-state mean trough concentration of total IgG and for the T max, Cl, 
and V d.
Depending on the number of subjects being dosed at 3 -or 4-week dosing intervals, subgroup 
analyses may  be performed to evaluate PK variables by  IV dosing interval. Subgroup 
analyses will additionally include age, sex, race, and/or other factors as appropriate.
Furthermore, baseline corrected PK parameters ( i.e., AUC and C max) will be calculated and 
analyzed as a sensitivity  anal ysis similar to the primary  PK endpoints.73 of 121

and Gamunex -C. The generalized linear model procedure for Poisson regression with log 
link will be used to estimate the SBI rate and its one- sided 99% upper confidence bound. 
Person- year will be calculated for eac h subject and will be used in the generalized linear 
model as offset variable. No covariates but the intercept term are included in the model. The 
estimated intercept term and the upper limit of its confidence interval (CI) will be 
transformed b y using the natural exponential function.

activities, day s on antibiotics, and hospitalizations will be summarized descriptively  for the 
number and percentage of subjects with the events, the total number of events or day s, the 
annualized rate of events or day s for individual subjects, and the rate of events or day s per 
person per year for IVIG -PEG and Gamunex -C. Annualized rate of all infections, validated 
infusions, day s missed of work/school/daily  activities, day s on antibiotics, and 
hospitalizations will be calculated.
9.1.4 Safety Analysis
The safet y analyses will be addressed by  listing and tabulation of AEs (including suspected 
ADRs [ i.e., potentially  related AEs]), vital sign s, phy sical assessments and clinical laboratory  
tests. Data will be described using descriptive analy ses. The safety  anal yses are based on the 
safet y population.
9.1.4.1 Adverse Events
Adverse events will be coded and classified using MedDRA®terms (s ystem organ c lass and 
preferred terms). 
Adverse events will be classified as treatment- emergent AEs (TEAEs) or non -treatment -
emergent AEs (non-TEAEs) depending on the comparison of AE onset date/time with the 
start date/time of study  treatment with the I P. A TEAE will be defined as an AE which 
occurs between the beginning of the first infusion of I P and the final visit of the study . A 
non-TEAE will be defined as an AE which occurs prior to the start of study  treatment. Non-
TEAEs and TEAEs will be summarized separately .
All AEs, suspected ADRs ( i.e., potentially  related AEs), ARs, SAEs, and discontinuations 
due to AEs and SAEs will be summarized by  presenting subject incidences and percentages 
and will also be listed by  system organ class and preferred terms.74 of 121

Infusional AEs will be defined as an y AE that occurred during infusion or within 24 and 72 
hours after completion of infusion. I nfusional AEs within 24 and 72 hours after completion 
of the infusion will be separately summarized. Also, the infusional AE rate per infusion and 
the proportion of infusions with one or more infusional AEs will be summ arized.
Subjects with deaths, SAEs, and AEs leading to premature discontinuation from the study  
will be listed and presented in a narrative form.

9.7 Subject Populations for A nalysis
9.7.1 Safety Population
The sa fety population will include all subjects who received an y amount of study drug 
(IVIG -PEG and/or Gamunex -C) and will be used for safet y, secondary  efficacy ,and 
exploratory  anal yses.
9.7.2 Pharmacokinetic Population
The PK population will consist of all subjects who received study  drug and have sufficient 
and valid total IgG concentration versus time data for either the IVIG -PEG PK Phase or 
Gamunex -C PK Phase to allow calculation of AUC 0-τ(the primary PK endpoint).  
The validity  of total IgG concentrations will be reviewed and determined before database 
lock based on consideration of treatment compliance and blood sampling/testing issues (such 
as collection problem). Any  invalid total IgG concentrations will be flagged with the reason 
for invalidity  in the subje ct listing.  
9.7.3 Immunoglobulin G Population
The IgG population will consist of all subjects who receive study drugs and have an y total 
IgG concentration data. The summary  of total IgG concentration data, mean trough, IgG 
subclasses, and antibod y titers will be based on the IgG Population.

The data will be recorded and kept current in the subject’s medical records and the eCRFs b y 
the study  site personnel directly  responsible for the information and reviewed for 
complete ness b y the monitor. Grifols personnel or designee can review the records.
In accordance with ICH GCP guidelines, the monitor must have direct access to the 
Investigator’s source documentation in order to verify  the data recorded in the CRF/eCRFs 
for consi stency  and to verify  adherence to the protocol, and the completeness, consistency , 
and accuracy  of data entered. “Source documentation” includes individual subject files, 
separate from the eCRFs, which should be maintained and include visit dates, laborato ry 
results, concomitant treatment, vital signs, medical history , examinations, AEs, I P dispensing 
logs, and other notes as appropriate. The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to 
ensure that an y problems noted during the course of these monit oring visits are resolved.

Modifications to the study  protocol will not be implemented by  either the Sponsor or t he 
Investigator without agreement by  both parties. However, the Investigator may  implement a 
deviation from, or a change to, the protocol to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to the stud y 
subjects without prior I RB/EC/Sponsor approval/favorable opinion. As soon as possible, the 
implemented deviation or change, the reasons for it and if appropriate the proposed protocol 
amendment should be submitted to the I RB/EC/Sponsor. Any  deviations from the protocol 
must be fully  explained and documented by  the Investigator.
No medical waivers for protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria will be allowed by  the Sponsor. 
If a need for changes to the protocol inclusion/exclusion criteria is identified, the protocol 
will be amended to include such changes. The protocol amendment will be submitted to the 
competent regulatory  authority  and/or IRB/EC as applicable per regulations, which allows 
implementation of the revised inclusion/exclusion criteria in the stud y.78 of 121

Appendix 2 Diagnostic Criteria for Serious Infection Ty pes
Infection: Bacteremia/Sepsisa
•Symptoms: chills, rigors  
•Physical findings: fever, hypothermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypocarbia, hypotension (systolic 
blood pressure <90 mmHg or a reduction of >40 mmHg from Baseline in the absence of other 
causes of hypotension), altered mental status, petec hiae, purpura, oliguria, cutaneous 
vasodilation/vasoconstriction 
•Laboratory tests : positive blood cultureb, leukocytosis (white blood cell [WBC] count 
>12,000/mm3), differential WBC count demonstrating >10% immature (band) neutrophils, 
leukopenia, thromb ocytopenia, coagulopathy, lactic acidosis
Infection: Bacterial Meningitis 
•Symptoms: headache, stiff neck, mental status changes, irritability, decreased feeding (infants), 
photophobia, nausea/vomiting, rigors, seizures 
•Physical findings: Kernig’s sign, Brudzinski’s sign, meningococcal rash, fever of >38°C oral or 
>39°C rectal 
•Laboratory tests: positive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Gram stain and/or culture and/or positive CSF 
bacterial antigen assay, positive blood culture , CSF leukocytosis with neutrophil predominance, 
decrease in CSF glucose
Infection: Osteomyelitis/Septic Arthritis 
•Symptoms: pain, decreased range of motion, tenderness, edema, redness, warmth over the involved 
site (local inflammatory symptoms/signs may be lacking in adults) 
•Physical findings: evidence of soft tissue infection adjacent to the involved bone/joint, dra inage 
from sinus tract from involved bone, fever of >38°C oral or >39°C rectal 
•Laboratory tests: positive blood culture, positive probe to bone, positive bone aspirate culture, 
positive bone biopsy culture, positive bone histopathology, positive joint flu id Gram stain and 
culture 
Imaging studies : positive X-ray, nuclear medicine bone scan, magnetic resonance imaging 
(MR I) scan, or computed tomography (CT) scan showing bony destruction with radiolucent 
areas; for chronic osteomyelitis: sequestra, involucr a
Note: Items in bold are considered essential diagnostic features. 
aTwo of the following should be present to make the diagnosis of sepsis in adults: temperature >38°C oral/ 
>39°C rectal or <36°C oral or <37°C rectal; heart rate >90 beats/min; respiratory rate >20 breaths/min , or 
PaCO 2 <32 mmHg; WBC count >12,000/mm3, <4,000/mm3, or >10% immature (band) forms (36). For 
pediatric subjects, w e recommend you employ the definition of sepsis using age -specific criteria as 
recommended by the International Consensus Conference on Pediatric Sepsis (38). 
bIndw elling catheter -or vascular access device -related blood -borne infections are not included because 
evidence is lacking that these are preventable w ith IVIG replacement therapy. For subjects w ithout indwelling 
catheters or vascular access devices, a single blood culture positive for a pathogenic organism will meet the 
diagnostic criteria for bacteremia. (Multiple blood cultures are typically obtained in cases of suspected 
bacteremia/sepsis, as per standard medica l practice, and the finding of a single positive culture should prompt 
additional confirmatory cultures). Subjects meeting criteria for positive blood culture but without 2 or more of 
the sepsis criteria listed above will be classified as having bacteremia . 93 of 121

Note: Items in bold are considered essential diagnostic features.
dFor the diagnosis of pneumonia in adults, commonly at least 2 of the l isted symptoms and/or signs should be 
present in conjunction with at least one laboratory and one imaging studies diagnostic element. How ever, for 
the purposes of counting serious infection episodes in a clinical trial of IVIG, the finding of a new pulmona ry 
infiltrate with consolidation on CXR is considered sufficient. To establish the diagnosis of bacterial 
pneumonia for pediatric patients, most of the same diagnostic criteria listed may be used, with the following 
exceptions: Because pediatric patients m ay not produce a sputum specimen for culture, blood cultures or 
serology may be substituted to identify the etiologic bacterial pathogen. In infants age 3 to 24 months, who 
tend to have a higher baseline temperature, fever is defined as a rectal temperatur e >38.3°C (101°F). In 
children >2 years, fever is more commonly defined as a rectal temperature >38°C (100.4°F). In pediatric 
patients, elevations of WBC counts >15,000/mm3are frequent but could be variable in patients with bacterial 
pneumonia, or leukopenia with WBC count <5000/mm3may be observed, usually associated w ith severe 
infection ( 40).
eWe recommend a deep expectorated sputum gram stain to demonstrate the presence of microorganisms on 
examination of 10 to 20 oil immersion microscopic fields and <10 squamous epithelial cells and 
>25polymorphonuclear leukocytes at 10× low  power magnification to determine suitability of sputum cultur e

Appendix 3 Monitoring of Thromboembolic Events Risk
At Screening and during all the infusion visits, subjects will be activel y monitored for signs 
and sy mptoms of arterial and venous thromboembolic (TE) events. Arterial and venous TE 
events will be identified according to definitions in the I nternational Classification of 
Diseases (I CD) [ 41]. Such events include, but are not limited to, deep vein thrombosis 
(DVT), pulmonary  embolism (PE), acute my ocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, acute 
ischaemic heart disease, embolism or thrombosis of arteries of lower extremities, sagittal 
sinus thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis and injury  of mesenteric artery .
All TE events will be recorded as adverse events (AEs) and re ported accordingl y. An y TE 
event fulfilling any of the criteria for “serious” will be reported as a serious adverse event 
(SAE).
The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (or designee) will routinely  review reported AEs for possible 
TE events.
In addition, TE events r isk will be evaluated using the following assessments, schedule 
(Table 1) and algorithms ( Figure 1 and 2):
1.Measurement of D -dimer blood levels ( 42);
2.The Wells Score ( 43) will be utilized to assess the clinical characteristics indicative of 
possible DVT or PE ( Table 2 );
3.Evaluation of clinical signs and sy mptoms of arterial and venous TE (such as, dy spnea, 
pain, swelling, tenderness and discoloration [paleness or redness] in lower extremities).
After getting results from (1) to (3) and prior to the next study  infusion visit, a medical doctor 
will asse ss the risk of TE events considering algorithms (provided in Figure 1 and Figure 2 
below) from the first Gamunex- C to the last IVIG -PEG study  infusions.

will assess the risk of DVT and PE considering the following algorithms adapted from Wells 
[43] (Figure 1 and Figure 2):
Figure 1. Algorithm to assess thromboembolic events risk for DVT
Any subject with a total Wells prediction score >1 for DVT assessment should have further 
diagnostic testing per study  site standard of care to confirm the occurrence of a TE event 
(Figure 1).
Any subject with a total Wells prediction score ≤1 for DVT assessment and a positive D-
dimer value ( i.e., above baseline and out of normal range of the reporting laboratory ) in 
combination with clinical signs or s ymptoms of a TE event (as per AEs assessment and such 
as pain, d yspnea, discoloration —paleness or redn ess—in lower extremities) should have 
further diagnostic testing per study  site standard of care to confirm the occurrence of a TE 
event (Figure 1). For t his purpose, “baseline” refers to the first study  infusion (Run -In #1 or 
Gamunex -C PK visit).
If the s ubject experiences a confirmed TE event, the study  treatment must be discontinued

Appendix 4 Detection of Hemolysis
During all the infusion visits, subjects will be monitored for signs of hemolysis associat ed 
with the administration of the I P.
All hemoly tic events will be recorded as adverse events (AEs) and reported accordingl y. An y 
hemoly tic event fulfilling any  of the criteria for “serious” will be reported as a serious 
adverse event (SAE).
The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor (or designee) will routinely  review reported AEs for possible 
hemoly tic events.
Hemoly sis will be monitored using the following assessments and schedule (Table 1):
1.Blood testing: whole blood hemoglobin, plasma free hemoglobin, haptoglobin, lactate 
dehy drogenase (LDH), direct antiglobulin test (DAT), absolute reticulocy te count (ARC), 
red blood count (RBC), hematocrit, total and indirect and direct bilirubin , and blood 
smear.
2.Urine testing: urinary  sediment, and hemoglobinuria.
3.Evaluation of clinical parameters including red/dark urine, jaundice, as well as other 
signs and s ymptoms of anemia (such as pallor or tachy cardia) evaluated b y the 
Investigator or appropriate study  staff (medical doctor) at any  time on the day  of infusion 
before the in fusion and after the completion of the infusion, and via a phone call 10 day s

During the phone call, the following questions may be asked to the subject in addition to 
questions that the I nvestigator or designee medical doctor will consider necessary  to monitor 
the potential risk of hemoly sis associated with the use of IP:
•Are you more tired since the last infusion of the study drug?
•Do y ou feel an increase in y our heart rate since the last infusion of the study  drug?
•Do you have yellow eyes since the last infusion of the study  drug?
•Is your urine dark since the last infusion of the study drug?
•Do y ou have pale face or hands?
Important note:
If the Investigator or designee medical doctor detect an y evidence of risk of hemo lysis during 
the assessment of clinical parameters of hemol ysis after each infusion or b y the phone call (at 
Day 10, ±2 day s following each infusion), additional blood and urine testing will also be 
performed. In case the risk of hemoly sis is identified du ring the phone call, the subject will 
be asked to go to the investigational site to have a blood draw and to provide urine sample.
Definition of hemolysis associated with the administration of I P:
In this study , a hemol ytic reaction is one in which there is evidence of a new hemoly tic 
process within 10 day s (±2 day s) of each IP administration ( 31).
The following laboratory signs must be present: 
1.Drop in whole blood hemoglobin of ≥1 g/ dL1; and
2.Positive result of DAT2; and
3.At least 2 of the following:
•Increased ARC1 •Hemoglob inemia (excess of hemoglobin 
in the plasma )2
•Increased LDH level1 •Hemoglobinuria2
•Low haptoglobin level1 •Presence of significant spherocy tosis2
•Unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia2
1Changes from baseline values ( For this purpose, “baseline” refers to the first study infusion [ Run-In #1 or 
Gamunex -C PK visit ].)
2Results from blood and urine testing performed after infusion and/or at Day 10 after infusion of the IP.
Subjects from this study  may  be severel y ill and may  have anemia for a number of reasons. 
Therefore, it is important to exclude the underly ing condition and concomitant medications 
as a cause of anemia. The exclusions are:
•History  or examination consistent with an alternative cause of anemia including blood 
loss ( e.g., frequent phlebotomy  is highl y associated with changes in hemoglobin and 102 of 121

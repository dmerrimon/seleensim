 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 11 of 100 Study Design  This is a Phase 3, prospective , double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
multicenter , relapse prevention study in subjects with dementia -related 
psychosis.  
This study will have 4 treatment periods  (Figure  S–1): 
 Screening p eriod ( 3-35 days)  
 Open -label period (12 weeks)  
 Double -blind period (up to 26 weeks)  
 Safety f ollow -up period (approximately 4 w eeks)  
The schedule of assessments is provided in Table  S–1 and Table  S–2. 
Screening Period ( 3-35 Days ) 
During the screening period, subjects will be assessed for study 
eligibility and prohibited medications will be discontinued when 
medically appropriate. Subjects  and partner/caregivers will also receive 
a standardized psychosocial therapy training.  
Investigators should not withdraw a subject ’s prohibited medication for 
the purpose of enrolling them into the study . Medications should be 
discontinued only if it is d eemed clinically appropriate to do so.  
Open -label Period (12 Weeks)  
During the open -label period, eligible subjects will begin receiving 
pimavanserin 34 mg once daily (QD) beginning at Week 0 (open -label 
Baseline); subsequent clinic visits will occur at Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
Dose adjustments are permitted at scheduled or unscheduled visits until 
Week 4. After Week 4, the subject ’s dose will remain fixed at either 
34 mg or 20 mg once daily.  
To enter the double -blind period, eligible subjects must meet the 
following response  criteria at Weeks 8 and 12:  
 Subject experiences a ≥30% reduction (improvement) from Week 0 
(open -label Baseline ) on the SAPS -H+D Total Sc ore AND  
 Subject has a CGI-I score of 1 (very much improved) or 2  (much 
improved) , relative to Week 0 ( open -label Baseline ) 
A subject who does not meet response  criteria at Week 8 and 12 will be 
withdrawn from study drug and enter the safety follow -up period of the 
study . 
Double -blind Period (up to 26 Weeks)  
Randomization will occur at the double -blind Baseline visit (Week  12). 
Subjects will be randomly assigned 1:1 to continue their pimavanserin 
dose (34  mg or 20  mg) or matching placebo . Randomization will be 
stratified by : 
1. Most likely dementia subtype or most prominent cause of 
dementia :

disorders  
 Vascular dementia  
 Parkinson ’s disease dement ia or dementia with Lewy 
bodies  
2. Region  
The p rotocol -defined relapse criteria for dementia -related psychosis are: 
 Subject experiences a ≥30% increase (worsening) from Week 12 
(double -blind Baseline) on the SAPS -H+D Total Score AND has a 
CGI-I score of 6 (much worse) or 7 (very much worse) , relative to 
the double -blind Baseline ; OR  
 Subject is treated with an antipsychotic (other than pimavanserin) 
for dementia -related delusions and/or hallucinations ; OR 
 Subject stops study drug or withdraws from study for lack of 
efficacy (as reported by th e subject or  study partner/caregiver ) or 
the Investigator  discontinues study drug due to lack of efficacy; OR 
 Subject is hospitalized for worsening dementia -related psychosis  
Relapse criteria will be assessed weekly for the first 2 weeks after 
randomization (Weeks 13 and 14), every 2 weeks until Week 26, and 
every 4 weeks through Week 38. Relapse criteria may also be evaluated 
at unscheduled visits. Any subject who meets any of  the relapse criteria 
after randomization will be withdrawn from study drug and enter the 
safety follow -up period of the study.  
All s ubject s who discontinue the study between randomization and  
Week 38  should complete an  ET visit, if possible , and an indepe ndent 
adjudication committee (IAC) will review those cases that occurred 
before the study discontinuation date to determine if protocol -defined 
relapse criteria were met.  
Safety Follow -up Period ( Approximately 4 Weeks)  
Approximately 4 weeks after the last  dose of study drug, subjects will 
have a safety follow -up telephone call visit.  
The Sponsor will provide investigative sites with 3 months of after -
study assistance to transition subjects to standard of care therapy after  
their participation in the study.  
Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will review safety 
information on a regular basis throughout the study.  
Pharmacokinetic 
Assessments  During the open -label period, PK samples will be collected at Weeks 0, 
8, and 12.  
During the double -blind period, PK samples will be collected at Weeks 
13, 22, and 38/EOT.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16  August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 13 of 100 Pharmacokinetic  samples will also be collected, if possible,  at any ET 
visit or the visit immediately following an y SAE or following an AE 
leading to discont inuation.  
For all PK samples (scheduled and unscheduled), the dates and times of 
administration of the last 3 doses of study drug should be recorded , as 
well as the date and time of the sample draw . For samples collected 
from subjects who experience an y SAE or experience an AE leading to 
discontinuation, the date and time of the last dose of study drug prior t o 
the SAE or AE should also be recorded.  
Optional 
Pharmacogenomic 
Assessments  A blood sample will be collected at Visit 2 ( open -label Baseline ) or later 
from consenting subjects for potential future pharmacogenomics 
analyses (where local regulations permit).  
Data for genetic analyses  will be anonymized, as is the customary 
approach according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP).  
Sample Size 
Calculations  The sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: a 
placebo relapse event rate of 60% over 26 weeks; a pimavanserin 
relapse event rate of 35% over 26  weeks; a dropout rate of 25% over 
26 weeks; an overall two -sided alpha level of 0.05; use of a one -sided 
(0.025) O ’Brien -Fleming stopping boundary to adjust for a single 
interim analysis that will be performed when one half of the total 
planned number of post -randomization relapse events have occurred; 
and a power of 90% . The total number o f post -randomization relapse 
events required at the final analysis is 75 and the calculated sample siz e 
is 89 in each of the two treatment groups (giving a total of 178) . 
Study enrollment will be closed when approximately 178 subjects have 
been randomized in the double -blind period or when 75 adjudicated 
post-randomization relapse events have occurred. In the event that the 
randomization rate is lower than anticipated and/or the relapse event 
rate is lower than anticipated, the number enrolled and randomize d may 
be increased up to a maximum of 400 randomized subjects in order to 
observe 75 post -randomization relapse events.  
An interim efficacy analysis  of the primary efficacy endpoint  will be 
performed after 38 adjudicated relapse events have occurred . The s tudy 
may be terminated early if the interim analysis results meet prespecified  
stopping criteria For example, if there are exactly 38 relapse events at 
the interim analysis,  the significance level will be 0.0054. If the study is 
not stopped early and the f inal analysis includes exactly 75 relapse 
events (including the 38 events from the interim analysis), the 
significance level for the final analysis will be 0.0479. The actual 
significance levels to be used at the interim and final analyses will be 
calculat ed based on the actual number of events observed. The interim 
efficacy analysis will be performed by an independent statistician . 
Investigators, subjects, and Sponsor personnel will remain blinded 
throughout the study.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16  August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Information of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 14 of 100 Statistical 
Methods  The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the Intent -to-treat (ITT)  
population, defined as all randomized subjects . The time from 
randomization to relapse in the double -blind period will be compared 
between treatment groups using a Cox regression model with effects for 
treatment group, dementia subtype, and region. The nominal p -value, 
hazard ratio, and 95% confidence interval will be reported. Subjects 
who discontinue early or complete the study without having 
experienced a relapse event will be censored at the time of last 
assessment for relapse.  The key secondary endpoint of time from 
randomization to discontinuation  from the double -blind period  for any 
reason (other than termination of the study by the Sponsor) will be 
analyzed using the same methodology as for the primary endpoint.  
A hierarchical testing procedure will be used to control the overall 
type I error rat e for the primary  and key secondary  endpoints.  
Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
All exploratory efficacy endpoints will be summarized by treatment 
group using descriptive statistics . For all exploratory SAPS endpoints, 
CGI-S, ZBI, KSS, and EQ -5D-5L; the change from double -blind 
Baseline  will be analyzed using mixed model repeated measures 
(MMRM) . The independent variables in the model will include the 
following: treatment group (pimavanserin or placebo), visit, treatment 
by visit interaction, double -blind Baseline  score, double -blind Baseline  
score by visit interaction, designated  dementia subtype , and region . 
CGI-I will be analyzed using a n MMRM model with the following 
independent variables: treatment group (pimavanserin or placebo), visit, 
treatme nt by visit interaction, double -blind Baseline  CGI-S score, 
double -blind Baseline  CGI-S score by visit interaction, designated  
dementia subtype , and region . 
The treatment comparisons will be based on the difference in least 
squares means and will be teste d at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. The 
double -blind Baseline  score is defined as the last value prior to the first 
dose of double -blind study drug.  
In addition to the MMRM analyses  described above , last-observation -
carried -forward analyses will also be performed.  
Descriptive summaries of efficacy endpoints, including the number and 
percent of subjects meeting response criteria, will be provided for the 
open -label period.  
Safety Analyses  
All safety results will be summarized using descriptive statistics . 
Separate summaries will be provided for the open -label and double -
blind periods . The double -blind summaries will be presented by 
treatment group . Adverse events will be classified into standard 
terminology using the Medical Dictionary fo r Regulatory Activi ties. 
Adverse events may also be categorized into categories of special

discontinuation, TEAEs related to study drug, TEAEs by maximum 
severity, serious TEAEs, and serious TEAEs related to study dr ug will 
all be summarized . Other TEAEs of special interest may also be 
summarized.  
Descriptive statistics for ECG, vital signs, GCAS, MMSE, ESRS -A 
total score and all subscales, and clinical laboratory parameters, 
including change from Baseline  when applic able, will be tabulated by 
treatment group and timepoint . Additionally, categorical analyses will 
be conducted on the incidence of subjects with prolonged QTc intervals 
and changes in QTc intervals in accordance with International Council 
for Harmonisation  (ICH) guidelines. The incidence of clinically 
significant changes in selected laboratory parameters will also be 
summarized.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentration data for pimavanserin and AC -279 will be listed 
and summarized using descriptive statistics.  
If data allow, population PK and PK/PD analyses will be performed to 
further characterize the PK profile and exposure response relationship 
of pimavanserin using measures of safety  and efficacy parameters . The 
results of population PK and PK/PD  modeling will be presented in a 
separate report.  Investigators, subjects, and Sponsor personnel will 
remain blinded to p lasma concentration data from the double -blind 
period  until the unblinding of the clinical database at the end of the 
study.

This document is a research protocol and the described study will be conducted in 
compliance with the protocol  and International Council for Harmoni sation (ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice Guideline (GCP) . All key personnel (all individuals responsible for the 
design and conduct of this study) have completed or will complete human subjects p rotection 
training.  
1.1 Background Information  
Dementia is a syndrome with core symptoms, most notably a decline in cognitive function, 
but with a variety of other manifestations that are rarely confined to one subtype. Alzheimer ’s 
disease (AD) is the most com mon and well -known cause of dementia. Most studies of 
dementia -related psychosis focus on AD. However the various subtypes of dementia have 
more features in common than they have distinguishing them. The current study allows 
enrollment of subjects with psy chosis associated with the most common subtypes of 
dementia: AD, vascular dementia (VaD), Parkinson ’s disease dementia  (PDD) , dementia with 
Lewy bodies (DLB ), and the frontotemporal dementia  (FTD) -spectrum  disorders  (including  
behavioral variant FTD [bvFTD ], progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP], and  corticobasal 
degeneration  [CBD ]). These subtypes of dementia overlap greatly in 1) their clinical 
presentation and nosology and in 2) their pathological findings on autopsy 
(Brenowitz  et al. 2017 ). 
Psychosis is common in dementia . It is typical of DLB, very common in AD (Table  1–1) and 
occurs, although to a lesser degre e, in VaD and the FTD -spectrum  disorders . It is also a 
frequent complication of PDD . The psychosis in most dementias is typically dominated by 
visual hallucinations, with delusions often consisting of the reactions or rationalizations that 
follow . However delusions do occur as distinct phenomena, often taking the form of 
misinterpretations of real or imaginary objects, delusions of infidelity or abandonment, or 
beliefs such as thinking that spouses or relatives are duplicates of the original person . Among 
AD patients, delusions are more common than hallucinations ( Fischer et al. 2016 ; 
Ballard  et al. 1995 ) while hallucinations are more common in patients with DLB  and PDD . 
Patients with psychosis who had a clinical diagnosis of AD are often found on autopsy to 
have Lewy bodies or vascular lesions in addition to amyloidopathy (Fischer et al. 2016; 
Kim et al. 2017 ). Thus , the premortem diagnosis of dementia subtype may be less important 
when treating psychosis in dementia than the confirmation that the psychotic symptoms are 
associated with dementia and not with another psychiatric or medical illness such as 
schizophrenia or delirium.

Dementia -related psychosis  differs substantially from schizophrenia, mania with psychotic 
features, major depressive disorder with psychotic features , and other major mental illnesses . 
Jeste and Finkel ( 2000 ) laid out the ways in which the psychosis of AD is a different 
syndrome than the psychosis of schizophrenia in elderly patients . The same comparison can 
be made between dementia -related psychosis  in general and psychosis in  schizophrenia . 
Because of these differences , the assessment of psychosis in dementia is focused on a narrow 
set of symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) distinct from schizophrenia 
(Jeste  and Finkel  2000; Cohen -Mansfield and Golander  2011 ). There is evidence that 
psychotic features in AD, DLB, and PDD  are associated with polymorphisms in the 
serotonergic pathway genes, in particular the 5HTTLPR polymorphism in SLA6A4 , which 
codes for the serotonin transporter ( Sweet et al. 2001 ; Quaranta et al. 2009 ; 
DeMichele -Sweet  and Sweet  2010 ; Creese et al. 2014 ). 
Treatment of dementia -related  psychosis represents an area of high unmet need . Clinical 
experience and clinical trial data with atypical antipsychotics have consistently shown 
treatment effects across the spectrum of all neurodegenerative dementias ( Devan and et al. 
2012 supplementary material ; DeDeyn et al. 1999 ; Devanand et al. 1998 ; Katz et al. 1999 ; 
Street et al. 2000 ). However, the CATIE -AD study concluded that the adverse effects of 
risperidone, olanzapine , and quetiapine offset their advantages in efficacy . Although the 
atypical antipsychotic drugs were more effective than placebo, adverse effects limited their 
overall effectiveness . The authors stated that use of these agents may be restricted to patients 
who have few or no side effects and for whom benefits can be discerned  (Schneider  et al. 2006 ).

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16 August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 30 of 100 1.2 Investi gational Product  
Pimavanserin is an atypical antipsychotic that is present in the investigational product as  
pimavanserin tartrate salt with the chemical name, urea, N-[(4-fluorophenyl)methyl] -N-(1-
methyl -4-piperidinyl) -N’-[[4-(2-methylpropoxy)phenyl]methy l]-,(2R,3R)-2,3-
dihydroxybutanedioate (2:1) . In April 2016, pimavanserin was approved in the United States 
(US) for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson ’s disease 
psychosis ( PDP). 
Pimavanserin is a novel small molecule designed to specifically block serotoninergic 
neurotransmission mediated by the 5 -hydroxytryptamine (5 -HT [serotonin]) 2A (5 -HT 2A) 
receptor . At higher doses pimavanserin may block 5HT 2C receptors ( Vanover et al. 2006 ). 
Pimav anserin  shows no appreciable activity at dopaminergic, adrenergic, histaminergic, or 
muscarinic receptors . Activity at these receptors has been implicated in a range of dose -
limiting side effects associated with existing antipsychotic drugs including cogni tive dulling 
(Saeedi et al. 2006 ; Mehta et al. 2004 ; Peretti et al. 1997 ) and an increased risk of mortality in 
elderly patients with dementia ( Wang et al. 2005 ). On the basis of its novel receptor binding 
profile, pimavanserin may be effective in treating hallucinations and delusions associated 
with dementia -related psychosis  and may have added benefits with regard to overall 
tolerability relative to other antipsychotic agents.  
In this study, subjects will be asked to take pimavanserin tablets once daily as an oral 
formulation.  
1.3 Previous Clinical Experience  
Pimavanserin is an atypical antipsychotic that is approved for the treat ment of hallucinations 
and delusions associated with PDP. Studies have also been conducted in Alzheimer ’s disease 
psychosis ( ADP ) and schizophrenia . The PDP program and Phase 2 ADP study are reviewed 
below . A more complete discussion of these studies, as w ell as the schizophrenia program, is 
available in the pimavanserin Investigator ’s brochure.  
1.3.1 Parkinson ’s Disease Psychosis Program  
The scope of the development program for pimavanserin is the largest ever conducted in 
PDP. At the time of approval, 616 mostl y older, late -stage PDP subjects had been evaluated in 
16 countries over a span of >10 years . Clinically meaningful efficacy was established in 
Study ACP -103-020, a 6 -week, placebo -controlled Phase 3 study  (Cummings et al. 2014 ). 
This efficacy was supported by data from additional short -term Phase 2b /3 studies . In 
ACP -103-020, pimavanserin 34  mg consistently demonstrated statistically significant 
efficacy across multiple and independent endpoints, subject subgroups, and sens itivity 
analyses. Improvements in sleep and daytime wakefulness were also observed . These clinical

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16 August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 31 of 100 benefits were achieved without worsening of Parkinson ’s disease motor symptoms and 
without a number of other safety concerns associated with atypical antipsy chotics.  
Pimavanserin is considered to be generally safe and well tolerated . Across all clinical studies 
of pimavanserin, the most frequently reported treatment -emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) 
were in the central nervous system (CNS), gastrointestinal, and  psychiatric systems . Most 
events were mild to moderate in intensity . The most common CNS TEAEs included dizziness 
(including postural), headache, and somnolence (drowsiness) . Common gastrointestinal 
disturbances included dyspepsia, nausea, constipation, a nd vomiting . Severe nausea and 
vomiting were dose limiting in a few cases . Reported psychiatric conditions included 
agitation, insomnia, and confusional state.  
Clinical and nonclinical safety pharmacology studies of pimavanserin suggest a potential ri sk 
for QT prolongation . The magnitude of effect in humans has been assessed in a thorough QT 
study with doses of pimavanserin ranging from 17 to 68  mg. In the Phase 3 PDP program, an 
average prolongation of approximately 5  to 8 ms was observed  with pimavanserin  34 mg. 
The US package insert for pimavanserin has a boxed warning that elderly patients with 
dementia -related psychosis treated with antipsychotic drugs are at an increased risk of death. 
Pimavan serin is not approved in the treatment of patients with dementia -related psychosis 
unrelated to the hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson ’s disease psychosis . 
Additional information is provided in the pimavanserin Investigator ’s brochure and in the 
NUPLAZID® (pimavanserin) US package insert.  
1.3.2 Alzheimer ’s Disease Psychosis  
Evidence from the recently completed Phase 2 study (ACP -103-019) suggests that 
pimavanserin is effective in reducing hallucinations and delusions in subjects  with ADP  
(Ballard et al. 2018 ). 
Study ACP -103-019 was a Phase 2, 12 -week randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, 
single -center study to assess the safety and efficacy of pimavanserin 34  mg once daily in 
nursing home subjects with ADP . Eligible subjects were required to have a score of 4 or 
greater on either the hallucinations or delusions scale of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory -
Nursing Home Version (NPI -NH) or a combined hallucinations and delusions score of 6 or 
greater . The primary efficacy endpoint was change from Baseline to Day 43 in  the NPI -NH 
psychosis score (delusions+hallucinations domains).  
A total of 181 subjects were randomized (n=90 pimavanserin 34  mg and n=91 placebo) with 
178 subjects included in the full analysis set (FAS; n=87 pimavanserin and n=91 placebo). 
The mean (stan dard error [SE]) age of subjects was 85.9 (0.49) years . The mean (SE) 
Baseline  NPI-NH psychosis score for all FAS subjects was 9.8 (0.39) with comparable mean

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 32 of 100 scores in the pimavanserin (9.5) and placebo (10.0) groups . The mean (SE) Mini -mental State 
Exami nation (MMSE) score for all FAS subjects was 10.1  (0.40).  
Efficacy results for the primary endpoint (NPI -NH psychosis score after 6  weeks of treatment 
(Day 43) demonstrated a significant (p=0.0451) treatment effect for pimavanserin compared 
with placebo . Prespecified subgroup analyses for the primary endpoint at Week 6 confirmed 
the observation of efficacy with the enhancement of the efficacy signal and effect size 
observed in the overall population . Similarly, prespecified responder analyses showed 
signifi cant increases in responder rates at Week 6 in the pimavanserin treatment group 
compared to placebo . On the endpoint of mean change in NPI -NH psychosis score at 
Week  12, pimavanserin generally maintained the achieved improvement on psychosis 
observed at th e Week 6 primary endpoint, but the statistical difference from placebo was not 
maintained due to apparent improvement in the placebo group between Weeks 6 and 12.  
NPI-NH psychosis score responder analyses also demonstrate the significant and clinically 
relevant treatment effect of pimavanserin 34  mg compared with placebo in subjects with 
ADP . Furthermore, defining responder as either a 30% or greater improvement or a 50% or 
greater improvement from Baseline  NPI-NH psychosis score showed a significantly grea ter 
proportion of responders in the pimavanserin group ( Table  1–2).

With respect to safety, pimavanserin appeared to be well -tolerated with no new safety 
observations in this elderly and frail patient population compared to the pimavanserin PDP 
safety database.  An e qual number of post -randomization deaths were reported: 4 deaths in the 
pimavanserin group and 4 in the placebo group.  
There were more SAEs reported in pimavanserin group (16.7%) than in the placebo group 
(11.0%).  A review of individual SAEs revealed a sim ilar distribution of Medical Dictionary 
for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) preferred terms between the two treatment groups with 
no clusters or common underlying mechanisms identified. However, there were fewer

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 33 of 100 discontinuations due to AEs in the pimavanser in group (8.9%) compared with the placebo 
group (12.1%).  
The most frequently reported AEs in the pimavanserin group were fall (23.3%), urinary tract  
infection (22.2%), and agitation (21.1%).  Agitation was reported more often in the 
pimavanserin group than in the placebo group.  
The mean change from baseline in the QTc interval in subjects treated with pimavanserin was  
9.4 ms at 12 weeks (Day 85) with no significant outliers reported at Day 85 (>500 ms or del ta 
≥60 ms). One subject in the pimavanserin group a nd one subject in the placebo group had a 
delta ≥60 ms at Day 15. Each subject continued in the study.  
Weight data was available for about half of the study participants at Day 85. Mean body 
weight and body mass index ( BMI ) remained relatively unchanged from Baseline to Day 85 
in both treatment groups. Overall, 1 (1.8%) subject in the placebo group and  7 (14.6%)  
subjects in the pimavanserin group experienced weight decrease of ≥7% and 5 (8.8%) 
subjects in the placebo group a nd 4 (8.5%) subjects in the pimavanserin group experienced 
weight increase of ≥7%.  
Changes from baseline in MMSE were similar in placebo and pimavanserin group indicating 
that pimavanserin did not affect cognitive function in these patients. Similarly, tre atment with 
pimavanserin had no negative effect on motor function as measured by UPDRS Part III 
scores.  
1.4 Study Rationale  
As discussed above, dementia -related psychosis is an area of high unmet need. Psychosis is a 
common occurrence in the disease evolution of patients with dementia. The reported 
prevalence of psychotic symptoms in patients with dementia ranges from ~20 % to 90%. In 
spite of the sign ificant medical need, currently  there is no pharmacologic treatment approved 
for dementia -related psychosis. Aty pical antipsychotics are frequen tly used to treat this 
disorder  despite significant safety concerns  about their use in this population . 
Psychotic symptoms found in the various subtypes of dementia are similar to each other and 
quite different from the psyc hotic symptoms of major mental il lnesses such as schizophrenia. 
The clinical management of dementia -related psychosis does not differ among subtypes of 
dementia. The s ubtypes of dementia themselves overlap both clinically and pathologically. 
Most patients with dementia receive their diagnosis without further specification of dementia 
subtype.  
Clinical data presented above show p imavanserin to be  effective in the acute treatment of 
hallucinations and delusions in subjects  with PDP. Positive Phase 2 data in an acute treatment

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 34 of 100 setting in subjects with  ADP  are also described above . The purpose of this study is to evaluate 
relapse prevention in a broad group of subjects with dementia -related psychosis.  
The relapse prevention design of this study maximizes the dur ation of exposure to  a 
potentially  effective treatment and minimizes the duration of exposure to ineffective 
treatment ( Temple and Ellenberg 2000 ; US FDA 2012a ). Enrichment is a powerful design to 
demonstrate a drug ’s effectiveness using clinical trial data. Further more , it is an efficient 
design to determine whether a new drug is safe and effective for its intended use in a 
population with serious illness that lacks good treatment alternatives.  
The advant ages of the relapse prevention design stem from the fact that all subjects will 
receive open -label pimavanserin treatment upon entering the study and that there will be 
specific criteria for randomization based on an individual ’s response to flex ible-dose, open -
label treatment. Subjects who do not respond positively to pimavanserin treatment during th e 
open -label period will be withdrawn from the study. Subjects who respond positively (are 
stabilized according to predefined criteria) will be randomized in a doubl e-blind fashion to 
receive either pimavanserin or placebo. During this double -blind period, subjects who meet 
protocol -defined criteria for relapse  will be immediately withdrawn from study drug and 
enter the safety follow -up period of the study . Subjects w ho continue to benefit from 
treatment may continue treatment for the duration of the double -blind period (26  weeks).

3 STUDY DESCRIPTION  
3.1 Overview of Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, prospective, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, relapse 
prevention study in subjects with dementia -related psychosis.  Approximately 95 study sites 
will participate in this study.  
Study ACP -103-045 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16 August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 37 of 100 The duration of participation for individual study subjects will be up to 47 weeks, consisting 
of a screening period of up to 5 weeks; an open -label period of 12 weeks ; a double -blind 
period of up to 26 weeks ; and an approximately 4 -week safety follow -up period .  
The study discontinuation date is defined as  the day on which the S ponsor notifies sites that 
the study is ending (for example, in the event of a positive interim analysis or after 75 
adjudicated relapse events). The study completion date  is defined as  the day on which the last 
subject completes the l ast scheduled assessment (i.e.,  safety follow -up). A study schematic is 
provided in Figure  S–1. 
3.2 Screening Period  (3-35 Days)  
During the screening p eriod , subjects will be assessed for study eligibility and prohibited 
medications will be discontinued  when medically appropriate . Subjects and 
partner/caregivers will also receive a standardized psychosocial therapy  training . 
Investigators should not withdraw a subject ’s prohibited medication for the purpose of 
enrolling them into the study . Medications should be discontinued only if it is deemed 
clinically appropriate to do so.  
3.3 Open -label Period  (12 Weeks)  
During the open -label period, eligible subjects will begin receiving pimavanserin 34 mg once 
daily (QD) beginning at Week 0 (open -label Baseline ). Subsequent clinic visits will occur at 
Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12 . Dose adjustments are permitted at scheduled or unscheduled visits 
until Week 4 . After Week 4, the subject ’s dose will remain fixed at either 34 mg or 20 mg 
once daily.  
To enter the doubl e-blind period, eligible subjects must meet the following response criteria 
at Weeks 8 and 12:  
 Subject experiences a ≥30% reduction (improvement) from Week 0 ( open -label Baseline ) 
on the SAPS -H+D Total Score AND  
 Subject has a CGI -I score of 1 (very much im proved) or 2 (much improved), relative to 
Week 0 ( open -label Baseline ) 
A subject who does not meet response criteria at Week s 8 and 12 will be withdrawn from 
study drug and enter the safety follow -up period of the study . 
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected at Weeks 0, 8, and 12 . Pharmacokinetic samples 
will also be collected, if possible, at any ET visit or the visit immediately following an y SAE 
or following an AE leading to discontinuation .

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 38 of 100 3.4 Double -blind Period  (up to 26 Weeks)  
Randomization will occur at the double -blind Baseline visit (Week  12). Subjects will be 
randomly assigned 1:1 to continue their pimavanserin dose (34  mg or 20  mg) or matching 
placebo . 
The protocol -defined relapse criteria for dementia -related psychosis are designed to identify 
subjects with an impending relapse or relapse of psychosis:  
 Subject experiences a ≥30% increase (worsening) from Week 12 ( double -blind Baseline ) 
on the SAPS -H+D Total Score AND has a CGI -I score of 6 (much worse) or 7 (ve ry 
much worse), relative to the double -blind Baseline1; OR  
 Subject is treated with an antipsychotic (other than pimavanserin) for dementia -related 
delusions and/or hallucinations; OR  
 Subject stops study drug or withdraws from study for lack of efficacy, (as reported by the 
subject  or study partner/caregiver) or the Investigator discontinues study drug due to lack 
of efficacy; OR 
 Subject is hospitalized  for worsening dementia -related psychosis  
Relapse criteria will be assessed weekly for the first 2 weeks after randomization (Weeks 13 
and 14), every 2 weeks until Week 26, and every 4 weeks through Week 38. Relapse criteria 
may also be evaluated at unscheduled visits. Any subject who meets any of the relapse 
criteria after randomization will be withdrawn fro m study drug and enter the safety follow -up 
period of the study.  
All subjects who discontinue the study between randomization and Week 38 should complete 
an ET visit, if possible, and an independent adjudication committee  (IAC) will review th ose 
cases that occurred before the study discontinuation date to determine if protocol -defined 
relapse criteria were met.   
Pharmacokinetic samples will be collected at Weeks 13, 22, and 38 /EOT . Pharmacokinetic 
samples will also be collected, if possible, at any ET visit  or the visit immediately following 
any SAE or following an AE leading to discontinuation . 
3.5 Safety Follow -up Period  (Approximately 4 Weeks)  
Approximately 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug, subjects will have a safety

4 SUBJECT ELIGIBIL ITY AND WITHDRAWAL CR ITERIA  
4.1 Subject Selection and Withdrawal  
To be eligible for this study, subjects must me et all of the inclusion criteria and none of the 
exclusion criteria at Visit 1 (Screening), unless specified otherwise. Subject eligibility criteria 
will be verified prior to Visit 2 (open -label Baseline). This s tudy will randomize up to 
approximately 178 subjects with dementia -related psychosis who meet response criteria 
(Section  3.3). 
In order to participa te in the optional pharmacogenomics component of the study, subjects 
must sign a separate pharmacogenomics informed consent form (ICF), indicating their 
willingness to have their DNA sample stored for future use. Refusal to consent for this 
component does not exclude a subject from participation in the clinical study.  
Protocol waivers for eligibility will not be granted by the Sponsor under any circumstances . 
If, during the course of a subject ’s post-enrollment  participation in the study, it is disc overed 
that the subject did not me et all eligibility criteria, she or he will be discontinued, unless the 
discontinuation presents an unacceptable medical risk . The justification to allow the subject 
to continue in the study will be made by the Sponsor, with medic al input from the 
Investigator, and will be documented . If allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as 
a major protocol deviation and not a waiver.  
Subjects who screen fail will be allowed to rescreen with the permission of the Medical 
Monitor , provided the screen failure was due to a temporary condition that subsequently 
resolved.  
4.2 Inclusion Criteria

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 45 of 100 Subjects may be discontinued or withdrawn from the study for a number of reasons, 
including , but not limited to , those listed below:  
 Relapse of hallucinations and delusions associated with de mentia -related psychosis  
 Adverse event  
 Death  
 Lost to follow -up 
 Non-compliance with study drug  
 Use of prohibited medications  
 Physician decision  
 Pregnancy  
 Protocol violation  
 Study terminated by Sponsor  
 Subject withdraws consent  
 Other  
When a subject is found to be appropriate for discontinuation from the trial, the visit during 
which this is determined should immediately be converted to an ET visit (as described in 
Table  S–2) and all procedures and assessments listed in the schedule of events for  the ET visit 
(Week 38/EOT; Visit 17/ET) should be completed. Safety follow -up should be completed as 
scheduled.  
For subjects who discontinue from the trial between visits, every reasonable effort should be 
made to complete Visit 17/early termination (ET) and the safety follow -up period.  
If a subject is lost to follow -up, every reasonable effort should be made to pho ne the subject 
approximately 4 weeks  after last known contact with the subject in order to assess the 
subject ’s current status . All phone contact with the subject should be documented.  
For subjects who continue to be followed for safety, SAEs should contin ue to be reported as 
described in Section  7.4.2 . 
If a subject is discontinued from the study because of an AE, every reasonable attempt shou ld 
be made to follow the subject until the AE resolves or until the Investigator deems the AE to 
be chronic or stable.  
All SAEs will continue to be followed until su ch events have resolved or the Investigator 
deems them to be chronic or stable.

the un expected incidence of known AEs  
 Medical or ethical reasons affecting the continued performance of the study  
Regulatory Authorities also have the right to  terminate the conduct of the study in their region 
for any reason.  
4.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy  
Lifetime antipsychotic use and response is to be recorded. All other medications  used up to 
24 weeks prior to Visit 2 through Visit 18 (telephone visit) or ET  are to be recorded.  
In order to ensure that appropriate concomitant therapy is administered, it is essential that 
subjects be instructed not to take any medication without prior consultation with the 
Investigator (unless the subject is receiving treatment  for a medical emergency).  
4.5.1 Permitted, Restricted, and Prohibited Medications  
Prohibitions and r estrictions for concomitant medications , as specified in Appendix H  and 
Appendix I , should be followed between Visit 1 (Screening)  and Visit 17/ET . Medications 
that can prolong QT interval are prohibited (or restricted if approved by the Medical Monitor 
or appropriate designee) as specified in Appendix H . These appendices do not constitute an 
exhaustive list and any questions regarding prohibited and re stricted medications or the use of 
medications that could interfere with study conduct should be discussed with the Medical 
Monitor or appropriate designee.  
If a subject is on a restricted or prohibited  medication  at screening , the medication should be 
adjusted or discontinued only if it is determined by the Investigator to be clinically 
appropriate (e.g., if the subject's symptoms are not well -controlled or if the subject cannot 
tolerate the current medication).

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 48 of 100 During the treatment period, study drug will be supplied in treatment kits with blister cards 
containing 20 tablets  (10 days of treatment)  each. Kits will be distributed in a quantity 
sufficient to ensure the subje ct has an adequate supply of study drug between study visits.  
5.1.2 Product Storage and Stability  
Investigational product must be stored at 15°C to 30°C (59°F to 86°F) (see US 
Pharmacopeial Controlled Room Temperature) in a secure area with restricted access and  
according to local and national regulations.  
5.1.3 Dosing and Administration  
The first dose of study drug will be administered at the clinic; study drug kits will then be 
dispensed to the subject to take home . Each daily dose consists of 2 individual tablets th at 
should be taken together . Subjects should be instructed to take 2 whole tablets, orally, once 
each day . Subjects should be instructed to not crush the tablet s. The tablets may be taken with 
or without food.  
5.1.4 Dose Adjustments/Modifications/Delays  
The firs t dose of open -label pimavanserin 34  mg will be taken at the beginning of the open -
label period (Week 0 [Visit 2]). Pimavanserin will continue daily at this dose level for at least 
the first week of treatment. After the first week, if the subject is unable  to tolerate the 34  mg 
dose, the dose may be decreased to 20  mg at any study visit (scheduled or unscheduled) until 
Week  4 (Visit 4). If the dose is decreased to 20  mg it may later be increased to 34  mg based 
on investigator judgment at any study visit (sc heduled or unscheduled) until Week 4 (Visit 4). 
After Week 4 (Visit 4), the dose of study drug will remain fixed at either 34  mg or 20  mg 
once daily.  
When the dose is adjusted, subjects should be instructed to return all treatment kits, blister 
cards, and unused tablets from the previous dose level before the next dose level is dispensed. 
Dose adjustments will be recorded in the interactive response technology (IRT) system.  
5.1.5 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
At Week 12 (Visit 6), subjects who meet response  criteria ( Section  3.3) will be randomized in 
a 1:1 ratio to either continue receiving pimavanserin at the current dose level or to receive 
matched placebo.  
5.1.6 Blinding  
All subjects will receive open -label pimavanseri n (34  mg or 20  mg) during the open -label 
period of the study.  
Treatment assignment during the double -blind period will be double -blind such that neither 
the subjects, study partners/caregivers, Sponsor personnel who oversee the study, nor the

Details regarding medical emergency unblinding procedures are provided in Section  9.6.1 . 
5.1.7 Study Drug Compliance  
If a subject misses 1 d ose of study drug , he or she should not t ake an extra dose the next day.  
5.1.8 Overdose  
An overdose is a deliberate or inadvertent administration of a treatment at a dose higher than 
specified in the protocol . It must be reported, irrespective of outcome even if toxic effects 
were not observed . All events of overdose are to be captured on the overdose form 
(Section  7.4.4 ) as protocol deviations.  
5.2 Investigational Product Accountability Procedures  
The Investigator or designee will keep current and accurate records of the study drug produ ct 
dispensed, used, and returned for each subject to assure the health authority and the Sponsor  
that the study drug is being handled appropriately . Subjects should be inst ructed to return all 
treatment kits, blister cards , and unused tablets to the Investigator at regularly scheduled 
clinic visits  (except Visit 7) , any unscheduled visit where a dose change occurs, and any ET  
visits. At Visit 7 (Week 13), the amount o f study drug product used since Visit 6 (Week 12) 
will be recorded but no study drug should be returned to the Investigator and no new 
treatment kits will be dispensed to the subject.  
At appropriate intervals during the study, study drug reconciliation wil l be performed by the 
Sponsor  representative who may return appropriate unused study drug and used and unused 
packaging to the Sponsor ’s designee for destruction.  
At the conclusion of the study, final study drug reconciliation will be conducted at the site . 
Final study drug accountability documentation will be maintained at both the site and at 
ACADIA . Any remaining unused study drug and all used and unused packaging will be sent 
back to the Sponsor ’s designee for destruction, as allowed by country specific  regulations . 
Documentation of study drug destruction will be recorded and maintained by both the 
Sponsor  and the Sponsor ’s designee.  
The Investigator or  designee  is responsible for taking an inventory of each shipment of study 
drug received and comparing it with the accompan ying material shipping form . The 
Investigator or designee  will verify the accuracy of the information on the form, sign and date 
it, and provide a copy of it to the Sponsor  or designee . Any study drug supplied is for use in 
this study o nly and should not be used for any other purpose.

Study -specific procedures are detailed below . All assessments will be completed according to 
the schedule described in Table  S–1 for screening and the open-label period and as described 
in Table  S–2 for the double -blind period . Every reasonable effort should be made to complete 
the required procedures and evaluations at the designated visits and times.  
6.1 Screening Assessments  
6.1.1 Mini -Mental State Examination  
The MMSE  is a brief 30 -point questionnaire that is used to quantitatively assess cognition 
(Folstein et al. 1975 ). The MMSE includes simple questions and problems in a number of 
areas : the time and place of testing, repeating list s of words, arithmetic, language use and 
comprehension, and copying a drawing . The MMSE is being used in this study to screen for 
cognitive impairment  and as a safety measure . 
6.1.2 Medical History  and Demographics  
A complete medical history will be obtained fro m each potential subject , including details of 
the subject ’s psychiatric history and treatment (including prior use of and response to 
antipsychotic medication), details of the subject ’s dementia diagnosis and treatment 
(including date of onset of cognitiv e impairment), and details of any neurologic diagnosis and 
treatment.  
Subjects may be asked to provide pharmacy or medical records to substantiate the medication 
history  (Section  4.5). 
Demographic information, including date of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity will be recorded as well  
(as allowed by local regulations) . Any new medical condition reported after the ICF has been 
signed will be captured as  an AE . 
6.1.3 Brain Imaging  
A non -contrast brain MRI or non -contrast  head CT will be completed if the subject has not 
had a CT or MRI scan completed (a) within the past 3 years AND (b) during or subsequent to 
the onset of dementia . If the Investigator believes a brain MRI with contrast or a head CT 
with contrast is clinically warranted, such a study may be done . The purpose of the scan is to 
evaluate criteria excluding a clinically significant CNS abnormality ( Section  4). 
6.1.4 Psychosocial Therapy  – Non-pharmacologic Intervention Prior to 
Randomization  
During the screening period, the designated study partner/caregiver  will receive instruction 
for engaging in a structured psychosocial interaction with the subject. This psychological 
intervention is intended to aid the subject and caregiver in managing the subject ’s

trained site personnel and will have weekly supportive telephone contacts. It is recommended 
to conduct the intervention at a frequency of 5 times per week (minimum of 3  times per 
week) for the duration of t he screening period . 
6.2 Efficacy  Assessments  
6.2.1 Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms  – Hallucinations and Delusions  
The SAPS ( Andreasen 1984 ) was designed to measure positive psychotic symptoms . Positive 
symptoms inclu de hallucinations, delusions, abnormalities in language and behavior, and 
disordered thought processes . The SAPS Hallucinations and Delusions subscales (SAPS -H+D) 
will be administered in this study . The Hallucinations and De lusions subscales consist of 
20 items, including global ratings of severity both of hallucinations (H7) and of delusions 
(D13) , respectively . 
All efforts should be made to complete each visit in a single day. In the event of a split visit, the 
CGI-S/CGI -I and the SAPS H+D must be completed on the same day.  
6.2.2 Clinical Global Impression  – Severity  and Clinical Global Impression –
Improvement Scale s 
The CGI -S scale is a clinician -rated, 7 -point scale that is designed to rate the severity of the 
subject ’s hallucinations and delusions at the time of assessment using the Investigator ’s 
judgment and past experience with subjects who have the same disorder  (i.e., dementia -
related psychosis)  (Guy 1976 ). 
The CGI -I is a clinician -rated, 7 -point scale that is designed t o rate the improvement in the 
subject ’s hallucinations and delusions at the time of assessment, relative to the symptoms at 
Baseline  (relative to open -label Baseline  for response criteria and relative to double -blind 
Baseline  for relapse criteria).  
All eff orts should be made to complete  each visit in a single day. In the event of a split visit, the 
CGI-S/CGI -I and the SAPS H+D must be completed on the same day.  
6.2.3 Zarit Burden Interview  
The Zari t Burden Interview (ZBI) was designed to assess the stress experienced by caregivers 
of patients with dementia ( Zarit et al. 1980 ). The ZBI will be administered as an interview . 
The interview consists of 22 statements reflecti ng how people sometimes feel when taking 
care of another person . The statements are phrased as questions for the family member study 
partner/ caregiver to  indicate how often they feel the way described in the statement . 
Responses are Never, Rarely, Sometime s, Quite Frequently, and Nearly Always.  When the 
study partner/caregiver is not a family  member , this scale will not be completed.

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 52 of 100 6.2.4 Karolinska Sleepiness Scale  
The Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS) is a 9 -item, self -reported subjective measure of a 
subject ’s level of drowsiness ( Åkerstedt and Gillberg 1990 ). Respondents must choose the 
statement that most accurately describes their level of sleepiness  over the past few minutes.  
6.2.5 EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument used as a measure of health outcome 
(Kind  1996 ). It measures 5 dimensions (mobility, self -care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, 
anxiety/depression) each of which has 5 potential responses . The responses record 5 l evels of 
severity (no problems/slight problems/moderate problems/severe problems/extreme 
problems) within a particular EQ -5D dimension . The EQ -5D-5L Proxy version 1 will be 
used. For this version, a study partner/ caregiver (the proxy) is asked to rate subject's health -
related quality of life in their (the proxy ’s) opinion.  
6.3 Safety Assessments  
6.3.1 Physical and Neurological Examinations  
A general physical examination will be conducted.  The physical exam procedures will 
include  the following organ systems : 
 Head, ea rs, eyes, nose, and throat  
 Skin 
 Cardiovascular  
 Respiratory  
 Abdomen  
 Genitourinary  (optional)  
 Musculoskeletal  
 Lymph nodes  
In addition, a neurological exam (cranial nerve s, motor, sensory, reflexes, gait, and 
coordination) will be conducted.  
6.3.2 Vital Signs  
Vital  signs will include body temperature, resting respiration rate, sitting systolic and 
diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rate. The resting blood pressure should be measured after 
the subject has been sitting or supine for ≥5 minutes.  
6.3.3 Height, Weight and Body Mass Index  
Height will be recorded in centimeters  or in inches . 
Weight will be recorded in kilograms  or in pounds .

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16 August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 53 of 100 Body mass index (BMI) will be calculated using the following formula:  
Weight  (kg) / [height  (m)]2. 
6.3.4 Electrocardiograms  
All 12 -lead electr ocardiograms (ECGs) will be complete, standardized recordings . The 
subject must rest in a supine position before the ECG is obtained . ECG tracings (paper or 
electronic) will be reviewed and interpreted by a qualified clinician . All ECGs will be 
centrally r ead; the interpretation by the central cardiologist is considered the official 
interpretation. ECG tracings and results (ventricular rate, PR, QRS, QT, QTcF and QTcB 
intervals) will be included and summarized in the subject's study records.   
The ECG will b e completed in triplicate at Visit 1 (Screening)  and as a single tracing at all 
other visits . The following conditions apply:  
 If a site performs additional ECGs beyond the set of triplicate ECGs prescribed at 
Screening or the single ECG prescribed at Baseline, the mean QTcF/QRS values of all the 
tracings of adequate quality will be used to determine eligibility.  
 If the mean QTcF  value from the set of  ECGs done at Screening is  prolonged  due to an 
identifiable cause, and it is medically appropriate to address that cause, a repeat set of 
triplicate ECGs may be performed during Screening at the discretion of the Medical 
Monitor. In  this case, the repeat set of triplicate ECGs will be used in determination of 
subject eligibility.  
 At Baseline, a subject may be enrolled based on the machine read of the locally 
completed ECG. If the interpretation of the ECG by the central cardiologist indicates 
QTcF outside of the allowable range, the subject will be discontinued from the study, but 
enrollment of the subject will not be considered a protocol deviation.  
6.3.5 Global Clinician Assessment of Suicidality  
The GCAS is a clinician -rated, 5 -point sca le that is designed to rate the subject ’s suicidality 
based on the report of the subject, the report of the study partner/caregiver, and the clin ician ’s 
global assessment. Ratings can be 0 (“Absent ”), 1 (“ Feels life is not worth living ”), 
2 (“Wishes he/she  were dead or any thoughts of possible death to self ”), 3 (“ Suicidal ideas or 
gesture ”), or 4 (“Attempt at suicide ”). The Investigator will record a subject rating , a study 
partner/caregiver rating, and a clinician rating.  At Visit  1 (Screening) lifetime s uicidality and 
suicidality for the past 3 months will be assessed and at all other visits, suicid ality since the 
previous visit will be assessed.  
6.3.6 Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale  
The ESRS ( Chouinard and Margolese 2005 ) was developed to assess drug induced 
movement disorders such as Parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia and tardive dyskinesia with

reliability in idiopathic Parkinson ’s disease ( Chouinard et al. 1984 ). It consists of a 
questionnaire of Parkinsonian symptoms, physician examination of Parkinsonism, dyskinetic 
movements and global impression of tardive dyskinesia. The ESRS -A, an accepted modified 
form of the or iginal ESRS , will be used during treatment to monitor for any worsening in 
extrapyramidal symptoms or signs at scheduled visits.

6.3.8 Safety Follow -up 
A 4-week safety follow -up telephone contact is to be completed for all subjects . Subjects will 
have the following c ompleted via telephone approximately 4 weeks after the last dose of 
study drug:  
 Assessment of concomitant medications/treatments  
 Assessment of AEs  
6.4 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Pharmacokinetic  samples will be collected  for measurement of concentrations of 
pimavanserin and its metabolite AC -279. 
When possible, an additional PK sample  will be collected from subjects who experience an y 
SAE or experience an AE leading to discontinuation as soon as possible after the occurrence 
of that event.  
For all PK samples (s cheduled and unscheduled) the date and time of the last 3 doses  of study 
drug, as well as the date and time of the sample draw, should be recorded . For samples 
collected from subjects who experience an y SAE or experience an AE leading to 
discontinuation, t he date and time of the last dose of study drug prior to the SAE or AE 
should also be recorded.

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 57 of 100 6.4.1 Pharmacogenomic Assessment  
A single blood draw will be performed for subjects who have signed a separate 
pharmacogenomics consent form indicating their willingn ess to have their DNA sample 
stored for possible future genetic research related to pimavanserin or the indication(s) for 
which it is developed (where local regulations permit). Stored DNA samples and relevant 
clinical data will be made non -identifiable af ter the clinical study report has been issued. 
Personal identifiers will be removed and each study subject identifier will be replaced wit h a 
new number to limit the possibility of linking genetic data to a subject ’s identity.  
The pharmacogenomic asses sment is an optional component of the study requiring a  separate 
informed consent , which may be obtained at any time during the study . The 
pharmacogenomic sample may be collected at any time following informed consent for the 
pharmacogenomic component of th e study.  
6.4.2 Speci men Preparation, Handling, Storage, and Shipment  
Investigators, subjects, and Sponsor personnel will remain blinded to p imavanserin plasma 
concentration data from the double -blind period  until the unblinding of the clinical database 
at the en d of the study.  
6.5 Unscheduled Visits  
Unscheduled visits may occur as determined by the Investigator . The following safety 
assessments generally should be recorded at each unscheduled visit : assessment of AEs, 
assessment of concomitant medications/treatments,  and measurement of vital signs . The 
Investigator may perform any additional safety evaluations deemed by the Investigator to be  
clinically indicated.  Relapse criteria  may also be evaluated at unscheduled visits.  
7 ADVERSE EVENTS  
7.1 Specification of Safety Para meters  
7.1.1 Definition of Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as “any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related ” (US FDA 2012 b). 
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., an abnormal laboratory 
finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any 
judgment about causality or seriousness . An AE can arise from any use of the drug 
(e.g.,  off-label use, us e in combination with another drug) and from any route of 
administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
A suspected adverse reaction is any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the  
drug caused the AE.  
Study ACP -103-045 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16 August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 58 of 100 AEs do not include the fo llowing:  
 Stable or intermittent chronic conditions (such as myopia requiring eyeglasses) that are  
present prior to Baseline  and do not worsen during the study  
 Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, transfusion) . 
The con dition that leads to the procedure is an AE if not present at the open -label 
Baseline . 
 Overdose of either study drug (see Section  7.4.4 ) or concomi tant medication without any 
signs or symptoms unless the subject is hospitalized for observation  
 Hospitalization for elective surgery planned prior to study (situation where an untoward  
medical occurrence has not occurred)  
 Pregnancy will not be considered an AE, but if it occurs, it will be reported on a 
pregnancy form  
 
Adverse events  will be recorded from the time informed consent is obtained through 30 days 
after the last dose of study drug.  
All AEs must be either resolved or stable at end of study . If on going at the end of the study 
the subject should be referred for appropriate treatment.  
Serious AEs occurring after the safety follow -up period should be reported if in the judgme nt 
of the Investigator, there is “a reasonable possibility ” that the event ma y have been cause d by 
the study drug.  
7.1.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Event  
In addition to the severity rating, each AE will be classified by the Investigator as “serious” 
or “not serious. ” The seriousness of an event will be defined according to the applica ble 
regulations and generally refers to the outcome of an event . An SAE is one that meets one or 
more of the following:  
 Is fatal  
 Is immediately life threatening  
 Results in disability or permanent damage  
 Requires hospitalization  
 Prolongs existing hospitaliz ation  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect (in an offspring)  
 Is medically significant  
Study ACP -103-045 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16 August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 59 of 100 Definition of Life Threatening  
A life threatening event places the subject at immediate  risk of death from the event as it 
occurred . This does not include an AE  that might  have had an outcome of death  had it 
occurred in a more severe form . 
Definition of Hospitalization  
Hospitalization is defined as a full admission to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment . This 
includes prolongation of an existing inpatient ho spitalization .  
Examples of visits to a hospital facility that do not meet the serious criteria for hospitalization 
include:  
 Emergency room visits (that do not result in a full hospital admission)  
 Outpatient surgery  
 Preplanned or elective procedures  
 Protocol procedures  
 Social hospitalization, defined as admission to the hospital as a result of inadequate 
family support or care at the subject ’s primary residence  
 
Definition of Disability or Permanent Damage  
Disability is defined as a persistent or sign ificant incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions.  
Definition of Medically Significant  
Important medical events (medically significant events) that may not result in death, be life 
threatening, or require hospital ization may be considered to be an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition . Examples of 
such events are inte nsive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization or 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
An SAE may also include any other event that the Investigator  or Medical Monitor judges to 
be serious or that suggests a significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaut ion.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16 August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 60 of 100 7.2 Classification of an Adverse Event  
7.2.1 Severity of Event  
The severity of each AE will be graded on a 3 -point scale and reported in det ail as indicated 
on the eCRF:  
 Mild : awareness of sign or symptom but easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort, 
and not interfering with normal everyday activities  
 Moderate : sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities  
 Severe : incapacitating and/or preventing normal everyday activities  
7.2.2 Relationship to Study Drug  
The causality of each AE should be assessed and classified by the Investigator as “related ” or 
“not related. ” An event is considered related if there is a reasonable po ssibility that the  event 
may have been caused by the study drug under investigation (i.e., there are facts, evidence , or 
arguments to suggest possible causation).  
Consider the following when assessing causality:  
 Temporal associations between the agent and the event  
 Response to cessation (de -challenge) or re -challenge  
 Compatibility with known class effect  
 Known effects of concomitant medications  
 Pre-existing risk factors  
 A plausible mechanism  
 Concurrent illnesses  
7.2.2.1  Duration  
The start and stop dates for AEs will be recorded using the following criteria:  
 Start : Date of the first episode of the AE or date of significant sustained worsening in 
severity  
 Stop : Date when AE either ceased permanently or changed in severity  
7.2.2.2  Frequency  
The frequency of the AE should be  indicated according to the following definitions:  
 Single : Experienced once, without recurrence  
 Recurrent : More than one discrete episode with the same severity

 Recovered/resolved : Recovered or resolved  
 Recovered/resolved with sequelae : Recovered or resolved with sequelae  
 Not recovered/not resolved : Not recovered or not resolved  
 Fatal : Death related to AE  
 Unknown : Unknown  
 
7.2.2.6  Seriousness  
 Not serious  
 Serious  
 
7.2.3 Definition of Unexpectedness  
An AE, the nature or severity of which is not consistent with the information provided in t he 
Reference Safety Information section of the current Pimavanserin Investigator ’s Brochure.  
7.3 Time Perio d and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -up 
In the event that a subject is withdrawn from the study because of an AE, the subject shoul d 
be followed and treated by the Investigator until the AE has resolved, stabilized, or a new  
chronic  baseline  has been established.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16 August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 62 of 100 7.4 Reporting Procedures  
7.4.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
The Investigator must record all observed AEs and all reported AEs . At each visit, the 
Investigator should ask the subject a nonspecific question (e.g., “Have you noticed anythin g 
different si nce your last visit? ”) to assess whether any AEs have been experienced since the 
last report or visit.  
Note that any use of medication (and specifically any newly prescribed medication) during 
the course of a study may indicate the occurrence of an AE that  may need to be recorded on 
both the AE and the concomitant medication  page.  
All AEs will be coded by Data Management using MedDRA . 
All AEs, serious and not serious, will be recorded on the AE eCRF page using appropriate 
medical terminology . Severity and relationship to study drug will be assessed by the 
Investigator as described above.  
When possible, clinical AEs should be described by diagnosis and not by symptoms (e.g., 
“cold” or “seasonal allergies ” instead of “runny nose ”). 
All AEs, whether or not rel ated to the study drug , must be fully and completely documented 
on the AE eC RF and in the subject ’s notes.  
7.4.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
The reporting of SAEs by ACADIA to the Regulatory Authorities is a regulatory requirement . 
Each Regulatory Authority has established a timetable for reporting SAEs based upon 
established criteria.  
Serious AEs and other reportable information must be reported within 24  hours of discovery 
to ACADIA or its designee . The SAE (initial and/or follow -up), pregnancy  (Section  7.4.3 ), or 
overdose (Section  7.4.4 ) of study drug must be reported within 24  hours by completing the 
SAE , pregnancy , or overdose  forms, as appropriate (details on how to report SAEs are 
provided in a separate study reference m anual).  
At a minimum, events identified by ACADIA to require expedited reporting as serious, 
unexpected, and related to study drug must be brought to the attention of the responsible 
institutional review board  (IRB)/ethics committee  (EC). For European Unio n member states, 
ACADIA or its designee will provide reports of suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reactions (SUSARs) directly to the ECs, as required by local legislation . In all other 
countries, it is the Investigator ’s responsibility to provide these expedited reports to the 
responsible IRB/EC . It is also the Investigator ’s responsibility to notify the responsible 
IRB/EC regarding any new and significant safety information.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16 August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 63 of 100 For this study, sites will complete the paper overdose, SAE , and/or pregnancy form (for 
initial and/or follow -up information), including available supporting documentation relevant 
to the event and send (within 24 hours of discovery) to  the contact numbers and/or email 
designated on the SAE form provided to the sites . 
Subjects will be followed until Visit 17/ET  for any SAEs and/or other reportable information 
or until such events have resolved or the Investigator, in conjunction with ACADIA, deems 
them to be chronic or stable.  
In the event of any SAE (other than death), the study sub ject will be instructed to contact the 
Investigator (or designee) using the telephone number provided in the ICF . All subjects 
experiencing an SAE will be seen by the Investigator or designee as soon as is feasible 
following the report of the SAE.  
SAEs sho uld also be reported to the IRB/EC according to local regulations.  
7.4.3 Reporting of Pregnancy  
Any female subject who becomes pregnant during the study (with or without AEs) must be 
withdrawn from the study and the pregnancy must be reported on the pregnancy fo rm. Any 
female subject who becomes pregnant during the study will be followed through the first 
well-baby visit.  
Any AEs that are the consequence of pregnancy and which meet the criteria for serious 
should al so be reported via the SAE form . 
7.4.4 Reporting of Ov erdose  
Any overdose (Section  5.1.8 ) must be reported within 24  hours by completing the overdose 
form. Any AEs that are associated with the event and which meet the criteria for SAEs should 
also be reported via the SAE form.  
8 CLINICAL MONITORING  
Routine monitoring of study sites is described in Section  11. 
Clinical site monitoring is conducted to ensure that the rights and well -being of human 
subjects are protected, that the reported st udy data are accurate, complete, and verifiable, and 
that the conduct of the study is in compliance with the currently approved protocol and 
amendment(s) as applicable, with GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirements . Details 
of the study site monito ring process are described in a separate clinical monitoring plan 
document.

9.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans  
Statistical methods will be documented in detail in a statistical analysis plan to be approved 
by the Sponsor  prior to unblinding for the interim analysis . 
9.2 Statistical Hypotheses  
The hypotheses for the primary endpoint are stated in terms of the hazard ratio, HR= λPIM / 
λPBO, where λPIM and λPBO denote the hazard rates of relapse for the pimavanserin treatment 
group and the placebo treatment group, respectively.  
 The null hypothesis for the primary efficacy endpoint is: HR = 1  
 The alternative hypothesis for the prima ry efficacy endpoint is: HR ≠ 1 
 
The hypotheses for the key secondary endpoint are stated in terms of the hazard ratio, HR= 
λPIM / λPBO, where λPIM and λPBO denote the hazard rates of discontinuation from the double -
blind period for any reason (other than termination of the study by the  Sponsor) for the 
pimavanserin treatment group and the placebo treatment group, respectively.

9.3 Sample Size D etermination  
This study will enroll approximately 356 subjects in order to randomize approximately 
178 subjects with dementia -related psychosis who meet response criteria ( Section  3.3). 
The sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: a placebo relapse event  
rate of 60% over 26 weeks; a pimavanserin relapse event rate of 35% over 26 weeks  (hazard 
ratio =  0.47) ; a dropout rate of 25% over 26 weeks; an overall two -sided alpha level of 0.05; 
use of a one -sided (0.025) O ’Brien -Fleming stopping boundary to adjust for a single interim  
analysis that will be performed when one half of the total planned number of post-
randomization relapse events have occurred; and a power of 90% . The total number of post -
randomization relapse events required at the final analysis is 75 and the calculated sample  
size is 89 in each of the two treatment groups (giving a total estimat e of 178  subjects).  
Study enrollment will be closed when approximately 178 subjects have been randomized in 
the double -blind period or when 75 adjudicated post-randomization relapse events have 
occurred. In the event that the randomization rate is lower th an anticipated and/or the relapse 
event rate is lower than anticipated, the number enrolled and randomized may be increased 
up to a maximum of 400 randomized subjects in order to observe 75 post -randomization 
relapse events.

9.4 Subject Populations  for Analysis  
The open -label safety analysis set includes all s ubjects who received at least one dose of 
open -label study drug (pimavanserin) . Subjects will be analyzed based on the treatment that 
they actually received . The open -label safety analysis set will be used for analyses  of the 
open -label data . 
The double -blind safety analysis set includes all subjects who received at least one dose of 
double -blind study drug (pimavanserin or placebo) . Subjects will be analyzed based on the 
treatment that they actually received . The double -blind safety analysis set will be us ed for all 
analyses of the double -blind safety data.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the Intent -to-treat ( ITT) population , defined as 
all randomized subjects . Subjects will be analyzed based on their randomized treatment . The 
ITT population will be used for the double -blind analysis of all efficacy endpoints.  
The per -protocol (PP) analysis set will be defined prior to unblinding the study for the final 
analysis . Subjects will be analyzed based on their randomized treatment . The PP analysis set 
will be used for sensitivity analyses of selected efficacy endpoints.   
The PK analysis set includes all subjects in the safety anal ysis set who have sufficient 
PK data.  
9.5 Description of Statistical Methods  
For continuous variables, the f ollowing summary statistics will be provided : number of 
subjects, mean, standard error of the mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and 
median . For categorical variables, summaries will include the number and percentage of 
subjects in each category, using the number of subjects with non -missing values as the 
denominator for the percentages (unless otherwise specified).  
Unless otherwise specified, all reported p -values will be two -sided . All analyses will be 
performed using SAS® V9.4 (SAS Institute, In c., Cary, North Carolina) or higher . Validation 
and quality control of the tables, listings , and figures containing the results of the statistical 
analyses will follow appropriate standard operating procedures.  
9.5.1 Primary Efficacy Analyses  
The time from rando mization to relapse in the double -blind period will be compared between 
treatment groups using a Cox regression model with effects for treatment group, dementia 
subtype, and region. The nominal p -value, hazard ratio, and 95% confidence interval will be 
reported. Subjects who discontinue early or complete the study without having experienced a

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 66 of 100 relapse event will be censored at the time of last assessment for relapse. The primary analysis 
will be based on adjudicated relapse events ( Section  9.5.7 ). 
A sensitivity analysis will be performed based on the Investigator assessment of relapse. 
Additional sensitivity analyses to assess the potential impact of informative censoring will be 
specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
Kaplan -Meier curves of time from randomization to relapse will be presented for each 
treatment group. In addition, Kaplan -Meier estimates of the proportion of sub jects who 
relapse along with pointwise 95% confidence intervals will be provided for the 26 -week 
double -blind period.  
9.5.2 Key Secondary Analyses  
The key secondary endpoint of time from randomization to discontinuation from the double -
blind period for any reaso n (other than termination of the study by the Sponsor) will be 
analyzed using the same Cox regression model described above for the primary endpoint  
along with the Kaplan -Meier estimates . 
9.5.3 Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
All exploratory efficacy endpoints wi ll be summarized by treatment group using descriptive 
statistics . For all exploratory SAPS  endpoints , CGI -S, ZBI, KSS , and EQ -5D-5L, the change 
from double -blind Baseline  will be analyzed using mixed model repeated measures 
(MMRM) . The independent variables in the model will include the following: treatment 
group (pimavanserin or placebo), visit, treatment by visit interaction, double -blind Baseline  
score, double -blind Baseline  score by visit interaction, designated dementia subtype,  and 
region . 
CGI-I will be analyzed using a n MMRM model with the following independent variables: 
treatment group (pimavanserin or placebo), visit, treatment by visit interaction, double -blind 
Baseline  CGI-S score, double -blind Baseline  CGI-S score by visi t interaction, designated 
dementia subtype, and region . 
The treatment comparisons will be based on the difference in least squares means and will b e 
tested at a two-sided alpha level of 0.05. The double -blind Baseline  score is defined as the 
last value pri or to the first dose of double -blind study drug.  
In addition to the MMRM analyses  described above , last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
analyses will also be performed.  
Descriptive summaries of efficacy endpoints , including the number  and percent of sub jects 
meeting response  criteria, will be provided for the open -label period.

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16 August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 67 of 100 9.5.4 Safety Analyses  
All safety results will be summarized using descriptive statistics . Separate summaries will be 
provided for the open -label and double -blind periods . The double -blind summaries will be 
presented by treatment group . Adverse events will be classified into standard terminology 
using MedDRA . Adverse events may also be categorized into categories of special interest. 
Treatment -emergent AEs, TEAEs leading to disc ontinuation, TEAEs related to study drug, 
TEAEs by maximum severity, serious TEAEs, and serious TEAEs related to study drug will 
all be summarized . Other TEAEs of special interest may also be summarized.  
Descriptive statistics for ECG, vital signs, GCAS, MMSE, ESRS -A total score and all 
subscales, and clinical laboratory parameters, including change from Baseline  when 
applicable, will be tabulated by treatment group and timepoint . Additionally, categorical 
analyses will be conducted on the incidence of subj ects with prolonged QTc intervals and 
changes in QTc intervals in accordance with ICH guidelines. The incidence of clinically 
significant changes in selected laboratory parameters will also be summarized.  
9.5.5 Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma concentration data for pimavanserin and AC -279 will be listed and summarized using 
descriptive statistics.  
If data allow, population PK and PK/PD analyses will be performed to further characterize 
the PK profile and exposure response relationship of pimavanserin usi ng measur es of safety  
and efficacy parameters . The results of population PK and PK/PD modeling will be presented 
in a separate report . Investigators, subjects, and Sponsor personnel will remain blinded to 
plasma concentration data from the double -blind period  until the unblinding of the clinical 
database at the end of the study.  
9.5.6 Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review safety information 
on a regular basis throughout the study. The DSMB will be independent o f the Sponsor and 
will be empowered to recommend stopping the study due to safety concerns . The DSMB may 
review blinded, unblinded , or partially unblinded  data, but the Sponsor and the Investigators 
will remain blinded to the data provided to the DSMB until the official unblinding of the 
database at the completion of the study . The membership, activities, responsibilities, and 
frequency of meetings will be described separately in the DSMB charter.  
9.5.7 Independent Adjudication Committee  
An IAC will be established to perform validation of protocol -defined relapse events. The 
validation is based on review of predefined clinical data related to: 1) a relapse (identi fied by 
the Investigator ) occurring before the study discontinuation date , and 2) all early termination 
Study ACP -103-045 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16 August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 68 of 100 events which occur in the double -blind period before the study discontinuation date 
(Section  3.1). 
Predefined clinical data consist of copies of source documents collected and delivered by t he 
investigational sites. The IAC will review copies in English (translated if necessary) of 
medical documenta tion received in the adjudication packages. The Investigator must provide 
medical documentation as soon as possible after early termination . 
The IAC is composed of permanent members covering required medical specialties. IAC 
members must disclose any poten tial conflicts of interest and must be independent of the 
Sponsor.  
The events will be reviewed by the IAC in a blinded manner.  
Only events that have been adjudicated will be used in the primary efficacy an alysis 
(Section  9.5.1 ) and the interim analysis (Section  9.5.8 ). Furthermore, only adjudicated events 
will be used to guide the decision to close enrollment in the study, which is based on the 
number of relapse events observed ( Section  9.3). 
The IAC will work in accordance with written guidelines included in the IAC charter 
describing in details the composition, tasks, responsibilities and work processes of the 
committee.  
9.5.8 Planned Interim Analyses  
An interim efficacy analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint will be performed after 
38 adjudicated relapse events have occurred. The study m ay be terminated early if the interim 
analysis results meet prespecified stopping criteria . For example, if there are exactly 38 
relapse events at the interim analysis, the significance level  will be 0.0054. If the study is not 
stopped early and the final analysis includes exactly 75 relapse events (including the 38 
events from the interim analysis), the significance level for the final analysis will be 0.0479. 
The actual significance levels to be used at the interim and final analyses will be calculated 
based on the actual number of adjudicated events observed . The interim efficacy analysis will 
be performed by an independent statistician. Investigators, subjects, and Sponsor personnel  
will remain blinded throughout the study.  
9.5.9 Additional Subgroup Analyses  
Selected analyses will be performed in subgroups defined by dementia subtype:  
 AD or FTD -spectrum disorders  
 VaD 
 PDD  or DLB  
Subgroup analyses by region will also be provided.  
Study ACP -103-045 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16 August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 69 of 100 Additional subgroup analyses may be specified in the  statistical analysis plan . Sub group 
analyses will be performed for both the open -label and double -blind periods.  
9.5.10  Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity  
Adjustment of the primary efficacy analysis to account for the interim efficacy analysis is 
described in Section  9.5.8 . 
A hierarchical testing procedure will be used to control the overall ty pe I error rate for the 
primary and  key secondary efficacy endpoints.  Hypothesis testing will occur in the following 
sequential order:  
1. Primary endpoint  
2. Key secondary endpoint  
Statistical significance for the key secondary endpoint may only be claimed if the primary 
endpoint is statistically significant. The stopping boundar y to be used for the key secondary 
endpoint will be specified in the SAP.  
9.6 Enrollment, Randomization, and Masking Procedures  
Eligible subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2 treatment groups (pimavanserin or placebo)  
in a 1:1 ratio using an interactive resp onse technology (IRT) system . Randomization will be 
stratified by:  
1. Most likely dementia subtype or most prominent cause of dementia:  
 AD or FTD -spectrum disorders  
 VaD 
 PDD or DLB  
2. Region  
The assignments will be based on a pre -generated permuted -block randomiz ation schedule . 
Blinding will be assured by restricting access of Investigators and Sponsor personnel and/o r 
designee to the treatment codes, and providing identical tablets and packaging for the 
pimavanserin and placebo treatments.  
9.6.1 Breaking the Study Blin d/Subject Code  
For the final analysis, the treatment codes for all subjects will be released to the Sponsor after 
all subjects have completed the study and the clinical database is locked.  
For DSMB safety reviews, and for the interim efficacy analysis, the treatment codes will be 
released to an independent statistician/programmer to produce unblinded statistical outputs . 
The Sponsor and the Investigators will remain blinded.  
Study ACP -103-045 Final Version: 1.0  
Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16 August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 70 of 100 Unblinding of individual treatment assignment during the study is discouraged . The 
Investigator may break the blind in the event of a medical emergency if it is considered  
necessary for the care of the subject. The Investigator should contact the study Medical  
Monitor to discuss the event, but this need not be prior to unblinding the subject . In an 
emergency situation, the subject ’s treatment assignment may be obtained by the Investigator  
from the IRT system . Details of the process to be followed are provided in the IRT Manual . 
In the event that the IRT system is used to perform a code  break, the Sponsor or designee will 
be notified immediately via an automated notification from the IRT system that an unblindin g 
has occurred . The notification only alerts the Sponsor or designee that the unblinding 
occurred, and does not include any info rmation about the unblinded subject ’s treatment 
assignment.  
10 STUDY MANAGEMENT AND  DATA COLLECTION  
10.1 Data Collection and Management Responsibilities  
All documents required for the conduct of the study as specified in the ICH GCP guidelines 
will be maintained b y the Investigator in an orderly manner and made available for 
monitoring and/or auditing by the Sponsor and regulatory agencies.  
The Investigator and institution must permit authorized representatives of the Sponsor or 
designees (including monitors and au ditors), Regulatory Agencies (including inspectors), and 
the IRB/EC direct access to source documents (such as original medical records) . Direct 
access includes permission to examine, analyze, verify, and reproduce any records and 
reports that are needed f or the evaluation of the study . The Investigator must ensure the 
reliability and availability of source documents from which the information on the eCRF was  
derived.  
10.2 Source Documents  
All study specific information obtained at each study visit must be recor ded in the subject ’s 
record (source documentation), and then entered into a validated electronic data capture 
database by trained site personnel . The source documentation may consist of source notes 
captured by site personnel as well as laboratory reports,  ECG reports, and electronic source 
data.  
10.3 Case Report Forms  
Subject data required by this protocol are to be recorded in an electronic data capture system 
on eCRFs . The Investigator and his or her site personnel will be responsible for completing 
the eCRFs . The Investigator is responsible for the accuracy and reliability of all the 
information recorded on the eCRFs . All information requested on the eCRFs needs to be 
supplied, including subject identification data, visit date(s), assessment values, etc., and  any

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 71 of 100 omission or discrepancy will require explanation . All information on eCRFs must be 
traceable to source documentation at the site.  
10.4 Confidentiality  
The Investigator must ensure that each subject ’s anonymity is maintained . On the eCRFs or 
other documents  submitted to the Sponsor or designees, subjects must be identified by a 
Subject Identification Number only . Documents that are not for submission to the Sponsor or 
designees (e.g., signed ICFs) should be kept in strict confidence by the Investigator in 
compliance with Federal regulations or other applicable laws or ICH Guidance on GCP.  
10.5 Study Records Retention  
Investigators are required to maintain all essential study documentation as per ICH GCP 
guidelines . This includes, but is not limited to, copies of s igned, dated and completed eCRFs, 
documentation of eCRF corrections, signed ICFs, audio recordings, subject -related source 
documentation, and adequate records for the receipt and disposition of all study drug . 
Investigators should maintain all essential st udy documentation, for a period of at least 
2 years following the last approval of marketing application in an ICH region (US, Europe, 
and Japan), or until at least 2 years after the drug investigational program is discontinued, 
unless a longer period is r equired by applicable law or regulation . Only the Sponsor can 
notify an Investigator or vendor when any records may be discarded . Investigators should 
contact the Sponsor before destroying any files.  
10.6 Protocol Exceptions and Deviations  
No prospective entry criteria protocol deviations are allowed; all subjects must me et all 
eligibility criteria in order to participate in the study.  
Protocol waivers for eligibility and use of prohibited medication during the study 
(Section  4.5.1 ) will not be granted by the Sponsor under any circumstances . If, during the 
course of a subject ’s post-enrollment participation in the trial it is discovered that the subject 
did not me et all eligibility criteria, he or she will be discontinued, unless the discontinuation 
presents an unacceptable medical risk . The justification to allow the subject to continue in the 
trial will be made by the S ponsor, with medical input from the Investigator, and will be 
documented . If allowed to remain in the trial, this will be reported as a major protocol 
deviation and not a waiver . All follow -up safety assessments must be completed and 
documented as outlined  in the protocol ( Section  6.3.8 ). The Investigator must report any 
protocol deviation to the Sponsor and, if required, to the IRB/EC in accordance with local 
regulations, within reasonable time.

and visiting the Investigator for the purpose of inspecting the facilities and, upon request, 
inspecting the various records of the trial (e.g., eCRFs and other pertinent data) provided that 
subject confi dentiality is respected.  
The Sponsor ’s or designee ’s monitor is responsible for inspecting the eCRFs at regular 
intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to the protocol; completeness, accuracy,  
and consistency of the data; and adherence to local regulations on the conduct of clinical 
research . The monitor should have access to subject medical records and other study -related 
records needed to verify the entries on the eCRFs.  
The Investigator agrees to cooperate with the monitor to ensure that any p roblems detected in 
the course of these monitoring visits are resolved.  
In accordance with ICH Guidance on GCP and the Sponsor ’s audit plans, a certain 
percentage of sites participating in this study will be audited . These audits may include a 
review of si te facilities (e.g., pharmacy, drug storage areas, and laboratories) and review of 
study -related records may occur in order to evaluate the trial conduct and compliance with 
the protocol, ICH Guidance on GCP, and applicable regulatory requirements.

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 79 of 100 16 APPENDICES  
Appendix A  NIA-AA Guidelines for All-cause Dementia and Alzheimer ’s Disease  
All-cause Dementia  
Dementia is diagnosed when there are cognitive or behavi oral (neuropsychiatric) symptoms 
that: 
1. Interfere with the ability to function at work or at usual activities; and  
2. Represent a decline from previous levels of functioning and performing; and  
3. Are not explained by delirium or major psychiatric disorder;  
4. Cogni tive impairment is detected and diagnosed through a combination of (1) history -
taking from the patient and a knowledgeable informant and (2) an objective cognitive 
assessment, either a “bedside ” mental status examination or neuropsychological 
testing. Neur opsychological testing should be performed when the routine history and 
bedside mental status examination cannot provide a confident diagnosis.  
5. The cognitive or behavioral impairment involves a minimum of two of the following 
domains:  
a. Impaired ability to a cquire and remember new information ––symptoms 
include: repetitive questions or conversations, misplacing personal belongings, 
forgetting events or appointments, getting lost on a familiar route.  
b. Impaired reasoning and handling of complex tasks, poor judgme nt––symptoms 
include: poor understanding of safety risks, inability to manage finances, poor 
decision -making ability, inability to plan complex or sequential activities.  
c. Impaired visuospatial abilities ––symptoms include: inability to recognize faces 
or common objects or to find objects in direct view despite good acuity, 
inability to operate simple implements, or orient clothing to the body.  
d. Impaired language functions (speaking, reading, writing) ––symptoms include: 
difficulty thinking of common words wh ile speaking, hesitations; speech, 
spelling, and writing errors.  
e. Changes in personality, behavior, or comportment ––symptoms include: 
uncharacteristic mood fluctuations such as agitation, impaired motivation, 
initiative, apathy, loss of drive, social withdr awal, decreased interest in 
previous activities, loss of empathy, compulsive or obsessive behaviors, 
socially unacceptable behaviors

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 80 of 100 Probable Alzheimer ’s Disease Dementia  
Meets criteria for all -cause dementia (see above) and in addition, has the following  
characteristics:  
1. Insidious onset. Symptoms have a gradual onset over months to years, not sudden over 
hours or days;  
2. Clear -cut history of worsening of cognition by report or observation; and  
3. The initial and most prominent cognitive deficits are evident on  history and 
examination in one of the following categories:  
a. Amnestic presentation: It is the most common syndromic presentation of AD 
dementia. The deficits should include impairment in learning and recall of 
recently learned information. There should als o be evidence of cognitive 
dysfunction in at least one other cognitive domain, as defined earlier in the 
text. 
b. Nonamnestic presentations:  
i. Language presentation: The most prominent deficits are in word -
finding, but deficits in other cognitive domains should  be present.  
ii. Visuospatial presentation: The most prominent deficits are in spatial 
cognition, including object agnosia, impaired face recognition, 
simultanagnosia, and alexia. Deficits in other cognitive domains should 
be present.  
iii. Executive dysfunction: Th e most prominent deficits are impaired 
reasoning, judgment, and problem solving. Deficits in other cognitive 
domains should be present.  
4. The diagnosis of probable AD dementia should not be applied when there is evidence 
of  
a. substantial concomitant cerebrova scular disease, defined by a history of a 
stroke temporally related to the onset or worsening of cognitive impairment; or 
the presence of multiple or extensive infarcts or severe white matter 
hyperintensity burden; or  
b. core features of dementia with Lewy bo dies other than dementia itself; or  
c. prominent features of behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia; or  
d. prominent features of semantic variant primary progressive aphasia or 
nonfluent/agrammatic variant primary progressive aphasia; or  
e. evidence  for another concurrent, active neurological disease, or a non -
neurological medical comorbidity or use of medication that could have a 
substantial effect on cognition.

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 81 of 100 Possible Alzheimer ’s Disease Dementia  
A diagnosis of possible AD dementia should be made in either of the circumstances 
mentioned in the following paragraphs.  
Atypical course  
Atypical course meets the core clinical criteria in terms of the nature of the cognitive deficits 
for AD dementia, but either has a sudden onset of cognitive impairm ent or demonstrates 
insufficient historical detail or objective cognitive documentation of progressive decline,  
OR 
Etiologically mixed presentation  
Etiologically mixed presentation meets all core clinical criteria for AD dementia but has 
evidence of (a) co ncomitant cerebrovascular disease, defined by a history of stroke temporally 
related to the onset or worsening of cognitive impairment; or the presence of multiple or 
extensive infarcts or severe white matter hyperintensity burden; or (b) features of demen tia 
with Lewy bodies other than the dementia itself; or (c) evidence for another neurological 
disease or a non -neurological medical comorbidity or medication use that could have a 
substantial effect on cognition.

 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 84 of 100 Appendix C  Dementia with Lewy Bodies Consortium Clinical Diagnostic Criteria  
1. Central feature (essential for a diagnosis of possible or probable DLB)  
a. Dementia defined as progressive cognitive decline of sufficient magnitude 
to interfere with normal social or occupational function.  
b. Prominent or persistent memory impairment may not necessarily occur in 
the early stages but is usually evident with progression.  
c. Deficits on tests of attention, executive function, and vis uospatial ability 
may be especially prominent.  
2. Core  features (two core features are sufficient for a diagnosis of probable DLB, 
one for possible DLB)  
a. Fluctuating cognition with pronounced variations in attention and alertness  
b. Recurrent visual hallucinatio ns that are typically well formed and detailed  
c. Spontaneous features of parkinsonism  
3. Suggestive features (If one or more of these is present in the presence of one or 
more core features, a diagnosis of probable DLB can be made. In the absence of 
any core features, one or more suggestive features is sufficient for possible DLB.  
Probable DLB should not be diagn osed on the basis of suggestive features alone.)  
a. REM sleep behavior disorder  
b. Severe neuroleptic sensitivity  
c. Low dopamine transporter uptake in basal ganglia demonstrated by SPECT 
or PET imaging  
4. Supportive features (commonly present but not proven to have diagnostic 
specificity)  
a. Repeated falls and syncope  
b. Transient, unexplained loss of consciousness  
c. Severe autonomic dysfunction (e.g., orthostatic hypotension, urinary 
incontinence)  
d. Hallucinations in other modalities  
e. Systematized delusions  
f. Depression  
g. Relative  preservation of medial temporal lobe structures on CT/MRI scan

occipital activity  
i. Abnormal (low uptake) MIBG myocardial scintigraphy  
j. Prominent slow wave activity on EEG with temporal lobe transient sharp 
waves

Clinical Study Protocol Amendment 1  Date: 16 August 2018  
 
 Confidential and Proprietary Inform ation of ACADIA Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Page 85 of 100 5. A diagnosis of DLB is less likely  
a. In the presence of cerebrovascular disease evident as focal neurologic signs 
or on brain imaging  
b. In the presence of any other physical illness or brain disorder sufficient to  
account in part or in to tal for the clinical picture  
c. If parkinsonism only appears for the first time at a stage of severe dementia  
6. Temporal sequence of symptoms  
 DLB should be diagnosed when dementia occurs before or concurrently 
with parkinsonism  (if it is present). The term Parkinson disease dementia 
(PDD) should be used to describe dementia that occurs in the context of 
well-established Parkinson disease. In a practice setting the term that is most 
appropriate to the clinical situation should be  used and generic terms such as 
LB disease are often helpful. In research studies in which distinction needs 
to be made between DLB and PDD, the existing 1 -year rule between the 
onset of dementia and parkinsonism DLB continues to be recommended. 
Adoption o f other time periods will simply confound data pooling or 
comparison between studies. In other research settings that may include 
clinicopathologic studies and clinical trials, both clinical phenotypes may b e 
considered collectively under categories such a s LB disease or alpha -
synucleinopathy.

A. One of the following clinical features:  
1. The onset of the cognitive deficits is temporally related to one or more 
cerebrovascular events (CVE). [Onset is often abrupt with a stepwise or fluctuating 
course owing to  multiple such events, with cognitive deficits persisting beyond three 
months after the event. However, subcortical ischemic pathology may produce a 
picture of gradual onset and slowly progressive course, in which case A2 applies]. 
The evidence of CVEs is one of the following:  
a. Documented history of a stroke, with cognitive decline temporally associated 
with the event  
b. Physical signs consistent with stroke (e.g., hemiparesis, lower facial 
weakness, Babinski sign, sensory deficit including visual field defect,  
pseudobulbar syndrome – supranuclear weakness of muscles of face, tongue 
and pharynx, spastic dysarthria, swallowing difficulties and emotional 
incontinence)  
2. Evidence for decline is prominent in speed of information processing, complex 
attention and/or fr ontal -executive functioning in the absence of history of a stroke or 
transient ischemic attack. One of the following features is additionally present:  
a. Early presence of a gait disturbance (small step gait or marche petits pas, or  
magnetic, apraxic -ataxic o r parkinsonian gait); This may also manifest as 
unsteadiness and frequent, unprovoked falls  
b. Early urinary frequency, urgency, and other urinary symptoms not explained 
by urologic disease  
c. Personality and mood changes: abulia, depression, or emotional incont inence  
B. Presence of significant neuroimaging (MRI or CT) evidence of cerebrovascular disease 
(one of the following):  
1. One large vessel infarct is sufficient for Mild VCD, and two or more large vessel 
infarcts are generally necessary for VaD  (or Major VCD).  
2. An extensive or strategically placed single infarct, typically in the thalamus or ba sal 
ganglia may be sufficient for VaD (or Major VCD).  
3. Multiple lacunar infarcts (> two) outside the brainstem; 1–2 lacunes may be 
sufficient if strategical ly placed or in combination with extensive white matter 
lesions.  
4. Extensive and confluent white matter lesions  
5. Strategically placed intracerebral hemorrhage, or two or more intracerebral 
hemorrhages  
6. Combination of the above

1. History  
a. Early onset of memory deficit and progressive worsening of memory and 
other cognitive functions such as language (transcortical sensory aphasia), 
motor skills (apraxia), and perception (agnosia), in the absence of 
corresponding focal lesions on brain imaging or history of vascular events.  
b. Early and prominent parkinsonian features suggestive of Lewy body disease  
c. History strongly suggestive of another primary neurological disorder such as 
multiple sclerosis, encephalitis, toxic or metabo lic disorder, etc. sufficient to 
explain the cognitive impairment.  
2. Neuroimaging  
a. Absent or minimal cerebrovascular lesions on CT or MRI  
3. Other medical disorders severe enough to account for memory and related symptoms  
a. Other disease of sufficient severity to cause cognitive impairment (e.g., brain 
tumor, multiple sclerosis, encephalitis ) 
b. Major depression, with a temporal association between cognitive impairment 
and the likely onset of depression.  
c. Toxic and metabolic abnormalities, all of which may require specific 
investigations  
4. Other medical disorders severe enough to account for memory and related symptoms  
a. Other disease of sufficient severity to cause cognitive impairment (e.g., brain

The information presented here is intended to provide guidance and does not constitute an 
exhaustive list of strong CYP 3A4 enzyme (CYP3A4) inhibitors and inducers . Any questions 
should be discussed with the Medical M onitor or appropriate designee.  Details reg arding 
procedures for subjects who take a prohibited medication during the study are provided in 
Section 4.5.1 . 
The metabolism of pimavanserin is af fected by strong CYP3A4 inhibitors, resulting in an 
increase in maximum plasma concentration (C max) and area under the plasma concentration -
time curve (AUC) of approximately 3 -fold. 
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 are to be stopped at least 7 days or 5 half -lives prior to 
investigational product  administration, whichever is longer . Strong inducers of CYP3A4 are 
to be stopped 30 days or 5  half-lives  prior to investigational product  administration, 
whichever is longer.

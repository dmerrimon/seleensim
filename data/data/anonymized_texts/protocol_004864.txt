Principal Investigator:       Victor Montori, M.D.         Study Title:    Decision Aids for patients with Nonvalvular Chronic Atrial Fibrillation (DA4AFib)  
 
Protocol version number and date:     Protocol Version 2, 01/24/2019 
 
Research Question and Aims  
  Aims, purpose, or objectives:  We aim to develop, in close collaboration with stakeholders, evidence- based 
decision aid s for patients with nonvalvular chronic Atrial Fibrillation  
  Background:   
 A big public health problem: strokes in patients with atrial fibrillation  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is 
associated with ~5 -fold increase in the risk of stroke
1-3. Stroke affects 25 -35% of patients with AF in their 
lifetime4-6 and is usually more severe and twice as likely to be fatal (19-35%) than non-AF strokes (5-14%)7. 
Stroke survivors live with physical disabilities and burden their families and caregivers socially, physically, emotionally, and financially
8-15. Joo et al. estimated that caregivers spend 8.5 hours/week and > $8,000/year in 
the care of their patients with AF -related strokes15. 
 A failure of evidence translation – Large randomized trials have demonstrated the unequivocal and substantial benefits of anticoagulation in reducing the risk of AF- related strokes
1,16-18, yet many at-risk patients do not 
receive these benefits. In their systematic review of 29 studies from 1997-2008, Ogilvie et al. found fewer than 50% of high- risk AF patients were treated with anticoagulation
19 while more recent registry assessments 
document an anticoagulation gap of 20-50%, with a smaller but substantial gap (20- 30%) in specialty practice 
and very high- risk patients20,21. This practice gap is multifactorial: Clinicians fail to prescribe anticoagulation in 
high-risk patients, due to failure to recognize high risk patients22, misperceptions about the efficacy and safety 
of aspirin (no longer recommended for stroke prevention in AF)23, and fear of causing disabling bleeding24-27. 
Despite new evidence of safety and efficacy in risky groups, such as the very old, this pattern continues19,24,25. 
Of patients prescribed anticoagulation, 30-50% discontinue the drug within 12 months24,25,28 -31. Nonadherence is 
also multifactorial32-35: In some cases, patients perceive no benefit or overestimate their risk of bleeding26. 
Inadequate understanding of the value of anticoagulation with warfarin may reduce patient motivation to overcome the inconvenience of periodic INR monitoring and dietary alterations
26,36- 38. In order to translate 
anticoagulation guidelines into practice and reap the benefits of anticoagulation therapy, patients’ and clinicians’ challenges in initiating and implementing anticoagulation must be addressed.  Experts recommend shared decision making (SDM)  to realize the benefits of anticoagulation – In response 
to these challenges, the 2014 guidelines from the American Heart Association, American College of Cardiology, and The Heart Rhythm Society for the management of patients with AF formulated a strong class I 
Minimal Risk Protocol Template [IRB 10429.0 10]  Effective: 9/20/2017  
 
       Page 2 of 9 
 recommendation for patients and clinicians to make decisions together to individualize antithrombotic care1. 
Their call for SDM opens an opportunity and a challenge—viz., to improve the quality of care by making 
anticoagulation decisions more consistent with each patient's individualized stroke risk and with their situation, including comorbid conditions and socio-personal context.  To assist patients and clinicians to reach SDM about treatment options for patients with nonvalvular chronic Atrial Fibrillation screening we aim to develop evidence- based decision aid s to complement the clinical 
encounter s. Our goal is to promote evidence-based patient- centered care. Ideally, this care should reflect the 
research evidence about anticoagulation treatment. It should also reflect the values and preferences of the informed patient.  Our research team has approximately 15 years of experience designing and evaluating decision aids. These aids were designed with patient and clinician input and developed iteratively at the point-of- care. Randomized trials 
have found these aids acceptable, useful, desirable by both patients and clinicians; and effective in improving patient knowledge and participation in choice, and the quality of treatment decisions.  
Content and Evidence : These will be evidence- based decision aid s. Thus, they will present the best available 
comparative effectiveness evidence about the advantages and disadvantages related to different treatment choices and present, where pertinent and possible, estimates of the probability of these outcomes.  
   
Study Design and Methods  
 Methods:  
 
Observations of Clinical Encounters: 
To complete data collection, encounters of patients scheduled for AF treatment will be observed (by a study team member and/or using a video recording device) at Mayo Clinic Rochester and may be observed at Mayo Clinic Health System sites in Minnesota. We will identify patterns of patient-clinician conversations regarding AF treatment. This information will be summarized by our research team and integrated with prior knowledge from previous decision support work.  For Mayo Clinic Health System sites, we will seek approval from the sites to allow a member of the study team (from Mayo Clinic Rochester) to have access to clinicians and patients and conducts observations. Approval will be obtained prior to any observations conducted at the Mayo Clinic Health System sites.  We will explicitly indicate during an appointment if we plan to use a recording device in the room. These recordings will be used to further review and debrief with the team members on the protocol that cannot all be present at one time for the encounter.  
 
Interviews and Focus Groups:

       Page 3 of 9 
 In order to better understand the emotional experiences and problems of home- care management that patients 
with AF go through, we would like to conduct interviews and focus groups with patients and caregivers . 
Settings for recruitment may include: screening and approach of patients coming in for cardiology appointments 
at Mayo Clinic; members of online support groups; snowballing and referral; as well as the Stakeholder Group and other patients of the University of Utah, our partner site.  To complete data collection, interviews and/or 
focus groups of patients  and their caregivers (if applicable) will be conducted study team member and may be 
video or audio record ed. 
 
Field Testing and Iterative Development :  
We will create initial prototype s informed by the observations described above and in consultation with experts 
and stakeholders in the field. We will consult The International Patient Decision Aids Standards (IPDAS) for guidance during the construction of decision aids. These prototypes will be presented to patients  for input and 
refinement , including the KER Unit’s Patient Advisory Group.  
 After making as many revisions as necessary, a study team  member may introduce patients to the decision 
aid(s) and observe or record encounters of these patients with their clinicians. We will then further develop the 
prototype decision aids based on their performance. For field testing and iterative development, encounters of patients scheduled for AF treatment will be observed (by a study team member and/or using a video recording device) at Mayo Clinic Rochester and Mayo Clinic Health System sites in Minnesota. Patients may be introduced to the aid, with informed consent, prior to the encounter. In these cases, we may ask the patients to consider pre-encounter materials and provide their insight prior to the visit. Study team members involved with the recruitment process may also follow up with patients and clinicians following their visit to get feedback regarding the decision aids.  We will explicitly indicate during an appointment, focus group and/or interview if we plan to use a recording device in the room. These recordings will be used to further review and debrief with the team members on the protocol that cannot all be present at one time for the encounter. Patients may alternately choose to have an in -
person observer in the room in lieu of a recording device. Based on communication patterns identified, refinements to the tool will be made.   Iterations of the prototypes will be developed with input from all study team members and experience to -date. 
The process of field testing will continue until the study team, stakeholders, and PAG members reach a consensus that the prototypes are successful in involving patients in the decision- making process and satisfies 
IPDAS criteria. Based on our experience, up to 20 versions may be necessary to achieve this goal.   All patients who participate in the study will asked for their permission to use the data collected through their participation in the study (such as video recordings) for ongoing registry purposes for IRB- approved research, 
training and educational purposes. In situations such as video recordings, files will only be retained for future use as long as both the clinician and the patient in the video agree to this.

HIPAA Identifiers and Protected Health Information (PHI)  
 
Protected health information is medical data that can be linked to the subject directly or through a combination of indirect identifiers.  
 
Recording identifiers (including a code) during the conduct of the study allows you to return to the medical record or data source to delete duplicate subjects, check a missing or questionable entry, add new data points, etc. De -identified data is medical information that has been stripped of all  HIPAA identifier s so that it cannot be 
linked back to the subject. De- identified data is rarely  used in the conduct of a research study involving a chart 
review.   
 Review the list of subject identifiers below and, if applicable, check the box next to each HIPAA identifier being recorded at the time of data  collect ion or abstraction.  Identifiers apply to any subject enrolled in the 
study including Mayo Clinic staff, patients and their relatives and household members.   Internal  refers to the subject ’s identifier  that will be recorded at Mayo Clinic  by the study staff . 
External  refers to  the subject ’s identifier  that will be shared outside of Mayo Clinic.

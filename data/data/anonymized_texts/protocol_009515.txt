2) Objectives  
This is a single- center, pilot study to investigate the organ response s in subjects with 
COVID-19. We hypothesize that multiparametric imaging with dynamic 18F-
fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) positron emission tomography (PET) can monitor the 
functional changes in patients with  COVID-19. The primary objective  is to measure the 
change between COVID- 19 patients and normal subjects ; the secondary objective  is to 
measure the change in COVID -19 patients between baseline and 4 -mont h follow up. We 
will primarily assess the pulmonary blood- air barri er (BAB) permeability  to glucose but  
will also evaluate the FDG perfusion- metabolism changes in different organs such as brain, 
heart, and kidney. All the  functional parameters are derived from a single 18F-FDG 
dynamic PET scan on the EXPLORER total -body PET/CT scanner which  is uniquely 
available in  the UC Davis Medical Center .  
3) Background 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) is a highly infectious respiratory disease caused by 
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS -CoV-2) [1, 2]. The  majority 
of patients who are COVID -19 positive have mild symptoms [2] . However,  approximately 
20% of the patients can develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [3 -6], a 
common cause of respiratory failure [7] that is associated with a high mortality rate of 
about 40% in general [7, 8]  and even higher in COVID -19 [6, 9] . The complicatedness of 
COVID- 19 is further increased by the fact that “silent hypoxia” exists in many patients 
[10]. Those patients can breathe normally with a low blood oxygenation level but may be 
already at a late, very ill stage by the time they are admitted into the hospital.  
There is an urgent need for new methods, especially noninvasive imaging methods, to 
characterize COVID-19 severity  and early prediction of ARDS. Existing methods for risk 
stratification in patients with COVID -19 include clinical exams and laboratory tests which 
mainly evaluate th e body as a whole and do not evaluate the changes specifically in the 
lungs. Pulmonary function tests are also available. Nevertheless, many patients can have 
well-preserved lung mechanics while the disease severity keeps worsening, such as in those 
patien ts demonstrating silent hypoxia [10] . X-ray imaging, ultrasound, and computed 
tomography (CT) can image the lungs but focus on anatomical imaging. The anatomical changes may not occur before the disease reaches a late stage. Metabolic imaging with 
18F-
fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography ( PET) only demonstrated mixed 
results.   
Lung blood- air barrier (BAB, a.k.a. alveolar -capillary barrier) is formed by the epithelial 
cells of the alveolar wall, endothelial cells of the capillaries, and basement membrane [11] . 
BAB plays a crucial role for normal gas exchange in the lungs for taking in oxygen and 
releases carbon dioxide [11]. Increased BAB permeability has been well do cumented as a 
pathophysiological hallmark of early ARDS [7] and is closely associated with decreased 
PROTOCOL TITLE:  Total -Body Parametric 18F-FDG PET of COVID-19 
Page 2 of 11   Protocol Version 1. 9 (05/24 /2021) expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [12]. In patients with COVID -19, 
the ACE2 receptor  is the entry gate for  the SARS -Cov-2 virus to enters the host cells [13, 
14]. The virus binding can inhibit the normal role of ACE2 in protecting from lung injury , 
resulting in increased damage to pulmonary endothel ial cells, alveolar epithelial cells, and  
microangiopathy as confirmed by a very recent autopsy study of COVID-19 patients [15]. 
These types of injury may increase BAB permeability and lead to protein -rich liquid build -
up in the alveoli, which in turn impairs gas exchange [16, 17] . Therefore , the proposed 
study is aimed at assessing BAB permeability as a biomarker of COVID -19 severity .  
However, c linical assessment of BAB permeability  is not trivial. Transpulmonary 
thermodilution can evaluate pulmonary vascular permeability using the ratio of extravascular lung water over pulmonary blood volume [18]. Nevertheless,  the method is 
invasive, associated with complications [19], and affected by the type of ARDS [19] . 
Dynamic contrast -enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE -MRI) or DCE -CT may be 
used for imaging vascular permeability but their applications have been mainly limited in 
brain and tumors [20, 21]  with a short axial field of view  coverage . In addition, the contrast 
agents are associated with potential toxicity and injury to the kidney and brain [22-25] . 
Patients with COVID -19 are at higher risks for contrast toxicity because th e virus already 
attacks multiple organs including the kidney and brain [26-29].

and enabled multiparametric imaging (B -D). As compared to the clinical standardized uptake value (SUV) 
image  (B), the parametric image of FDG influx rate K i (C) can achieve higher lesion -to-background (e.g., 
the liver) contrast. In addition to glucose metabolism imaging by K i, total -body dynamic PET also enables 
multiparametric characterization of tumors and organs using additional physiologically important 
parameters, for example, glucose tra nsport rate K 1 (D), across the entire body.

Page 3 of 11   Protocol Version 1. 9 (05/24 /2021) utilized  for vascular permeability imaging [30- 32]. However, the radiotracer is  not widely 
accessible in clinics or would take a long process for clinical translation.  
We are developing a single- tracer multiparametric imaging method using PET and the 
widely available radiotracer 18F-FDG [33-35] . Different from the standard clinical usage 
of 18F-FDG PET only for metabolic imaging , we exploit dynamic PET imaging and 18F-
FDG tracer kinetic modeling  to enable simultaneous multiparametric imaging of glucose 
transport and metabolism. While conventional dynamic PET imaging has been mainly 
restricted to single -organ imaging because of the limited axial field -of-view (FOV) of 
traditional PET scanners (15 -30 cm), the world’s  first EXPLORER total- body PET scanner  
[36, 37]  has a long axial FOV of 194 cm with ultrahigh sensitivity and allowing 
simultaneous dynamic imaging of the entire human body. An example of multiparametric 
images from a  total- body dynamic 18F-FDG PET scan of cancer patients is shown in Figure 
1 [38] . In addition to the metabolic imaging as assessed by either the standardized uptake 
value (SUV) or FDG net influx rate (K i), the parametric image of FDG K 1 provides an 
additional dimension of information (glucose blood- to-tissue transport rate) on top of the 
images of glucose metabolism.  
In most organs and tumors, FDG K 1 can 
be considered as a surrogate of blood 
flow (perfusion). However, this not the case in the lungs. Our recent theoretical analysis has identified that lung FDG K
1 
may represent BAB permeability based 
on the fact that the extraction of 18F-FDG 
in lung ti ssues is small  (less than 10%) . 
This is theoretically justified by t he 
classic Renkin -Crone model  [39], 
K1=FE = F(1 -e-PS/F) where F represents 
blood flow, E is the extraction fraction of 
FDG and PS describes the product of 
tracer permeability and surfac e area. 
When E is small (PS ≪F), K1 ≈ F×PS/F

Page 4 of 11   Protocol Version 1. 9 (05/24 /2021) = PS, thus reflecting permeability, not blood flow . Given the association of BAB 
permeability with pulmonary ACE2  level  [12] , our working hypothesis is  that lung FDG 
K1 correlates with lung injury severity in COVID -19. Specifically, we hypothesize that 
lung FDG K 1 increases in patients diagnosed with COVID- 19 as compared to normal 
subjects and  decreases at 4 -month follow -up as compared to its baseline due to more 
complete recovery. S uccessful  testing of th ese hypothese s will establish lung FDG K 1 as a 
noninvasive imaging biomarker of COVID -19 severity , which has the potential to be 
applied for risk stratification and early assessment of therapeutic response. We have 
generated the quantification data in 5 healthy subjects. Figure 3 shows lung FDG K 1 versus 
subject age. While the sample size is small here, the plot shows a trend that increased age 
is associated with increased lung FDG K 1 and hence increased  BAB permeability . This 
preliminary result is consistent with the observation that elderly is  at higher risk of COVID -
19, which may be explained by the increased BAB permeability.  
From a total -body dynamic FDG -PET scan, we are also able to measure the perfusion -
metabolism pattern for other organs. Some of these organs (e.g., brain, kidney, heart) w ere 
previously reported of possible damages in patients with COVID -19 [26-29]. W e will also 
study the functional changes in different organs in each of the proposed comparisons.

6) Study Endpoints  
The primary  endpoint of this study is to evaluate  if there is a significant increase in BAB 
permeability (as assessed by lung FDG K 1) and changes in organ perfusion- metabolism 
between subjects diagnosed with COVID- 19 and normal subjects  (of which the 
EXPLORER scans are already available through another trial) . The secondary endpoint is 
to evaluate  the changes in patients with COVID- 19 between baseline and 4 -month follow -
up in a patient’s recovery phase.

Page 7 of 11   Protocol Version 1. 9 (05/24 /2021) 7) Procedures Involved 
COVID- 19 Testing : Potential participants with only a previous positive COVID-19 test 
(viral RNA) lacking radio logic findings, will be asked to undergo a SARS- CoV-2 
antibody test prior to enrollment. Prior to the baseline PET/CT scan, each participant 
must have a negative viral PCR COVID -19 test at least 14 days following the ir positive 
COVID-19 test.  These tests will be paid by the study . 
 
PET/CT  Scans: Each participant will undergo two 18F-FDG PET/CT scans, one at baseline 
and one at 4 -month (+/- 2 weeks) follow -up (Figure 4). A member of the research study 
team will reach out to the pa rticipant  prior to the 4 -month scan to inquire about the status 
and date of COVID -19 vaccination. For each scan, p articipants  will be asked to arrive for 
the study visits at the UC Davis EXPLORER Molecular Imaging Center (3195 Folsom Blvd, Sacramento, CA). A urine pregnancy test  will be  administered , at no charge, to all 
participants 18 to 60 years old able to become pregnant , unless documented hysterectomy 
or bilateral ovarian removal is available . Participants will then have a  routine finger stick 
test for measuring blood sugar level. A techn ologist will place a thin plastic needle (IV) 
into a vein at the arm of an eligible participant . The techn ologist will then instruct the 
participant to lie supine in the EXPLORER PET/CT scanner. The pa rticipant  will first 
undergo a n ultra low-dose X -ray CT imaging for attenuation correction purpose. After that, 
a standard dose of 
18F-FDG will be injected into the pa rticipant through the IV in a period 
of 10 seconds. The time when FDG is injected should be recorded. The PET scan commences 10 seconds before the FDG injection and lasts for 60 minutes. After the PET scan, the participant gets off the scanner.  
Cognitive Screening: Participants will also undergo screening with the Mini-Cog 
instrument.  The Mini -Cog1 is a standardized 3 -minute instrument utilized to screen for 
cognitive impairment.   The acquired total -body dynamic PET/CT data will be reconstructed into a sequence of 
dynamic images. An image -derived input function will be  extracted from the dynamic

doctor or hospital. The images will not receive any routine clinical review  by radiologists 
who interpret PET/CT scans. This means that some findings may be overlooked or misinterpreted. However, if the PET/CT technologists do notice findings that cause concern, they will notify the Study Radiologist. Additionally, if a member of  the research 
team notices any findings that cause concern while conducting image review for study purposes, they will notify the Study Radiologist. The Study Radiologist will conduct a brief review of part of the study images for quality purposes. If the Study Radiologist thinks a  
clinical problem is present, one of the IRB -approved study physicians will discuss these 
possible problems with the subject within 8 weeks or immediately upon recognition of any critical finding that requires immediate and/or urgent intervention as described in the Department of Radiology Critical Findings policy (full dataset of images are sometimes not available for review in less than 3 days). Upon written request, we will provide the subject with a copy of a subset of their C T images to take to the physician of their choosing. 
A subset of PET images may also be shared with the subject unless the images from the study are clinically uninterpretable. In addition, the sponsor may restrict sharing of PET images due to the nature of the research protocol. We will send a standard letter to the designated licensed medical provider identified by the subject, unless one of the study physicians is part of the subject’s care. The standard letter will state that (i) the subject’s images were acquired exclusively for a research study and incidental findings that may be related to a medical condition were observed by a UC Davis radiologist; (ii) the images did not receive any dedicated routine clinical review and findings may have been overlo oked 
or misinterpreted; (iii) the subject’s physician can contact the study doctor at any time if there are any concerns regarding the study or the subject’s findings.
 
 
8) Data and/or Specimen Management and Confidentiality  
All data and images acquired for research purposes will be coded with a research number. Subjects will be assigned sequential ID codes (1 -15). Subject identifiers and personal 
health information (PHI) will be removed from the DICOM header of PET/CT images to protect patient confidentiality  
Risk of loss of confidentiality and privacy will be mitigated by hospital EMR and PACS 
password security and by the protection of consent forms and datasheets with PHI are secured in a locked office and locked file cabinets in the EXPLORER Mol ecular Imagi ng 
Center office. Links in the data to the medical record will be removed before research 
personnel analyze the data. Access to the code key will be restricted to the investigators  
and coordinator(s) during the course of the study. 
Once informed consent is  obtained through a method approved by UC Davis , clinical data 
will be collected from the electronic medical record , including recent laboratory tests, 
cardiac function assessment, and imaging variables. Patient’s blood pressure, heart rate, 
and weight will also be obtained for the most recent visit.

N/A 
10) Provisions to Monitor the Data to Ensure the Safety of Subjects  
This study does NOT involve the administration of therapeutic agents. This study does 
NOT replace any of the safety monitoring that patients undergo as part of standard clinical care.  
18F-FDG PET/CT  is routinely used in clinical oncology, cardiology and neurology. 
Intervention for adverse events that occur during PET/CT scanning will be the responsibility of hospital radiology or nuclear medicine technicians and physician on duty.  
11) Withdrawal of Subjects 
Patients will be informed that they have the right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason, without prejudice to their medical care. The investigators also have the right to withdraw patients from the study for any of the following reasons: 
• Known or suspected pregnancy - this is verified as part of the clinical process since  
this test is clinically contraindicated on pregnant patients.  
• Circumstance(s) deemed by the Nuclear Medicine clinician to be contraindicated for PET/CT 
• Patient request  
12) Risks to Subjects 
Minor and uncommon clinical risks: 
• Additional discomfort from lying on the scanner table for 60 additional minutes 
Serious and rare risks:  
• Loss of privacy or confidentiality  
It is worth noting that all the risks listed below are similar to standard -of-care PET/CT test 
in oncological patients. 
Minor and common clinical risks: 
• The placement of the intravenous needle in a vein may cause temporary discomfort 
and a small bruise may form.  
• Discomfort due to lying in the PET/CT scanner for 1 hour 
Moderate and uncommon clinical risks:  
• Infection at the site with the intravenous catheter is placed.  
Radiation risks:  
• PET/CT involves a radiation exposure that is typical of other diagnostic tests using 
ionizing radiation  
• The amount of radiation exposure received in this study is below the levels that are 
thought to result in a significant risk of harmful effects.

Page 10 of 11   Protocol Version 1. 9 (05/24 /2021) 13) Potential Benefits to Subjects  
There are no direct benefits to the study subjects. The result of the study will benefit future 
patients once the methods are fully developed. 
14) Multi-Site Research  
This is a single -site study.  
15) Community- Based Participatory Research  
N/A 
16) Sharing of Results with Subjects  
The images acquired in this study are experimental and cannot be used by subjects or their clinicians for treatment decision -making.  No results will be shared with patients or 
clinicians.  
17) Prior Approvals  
Prior approval from the Radiation Use Committee will be obtained before the submission 
of this protocol for IRB approval. 
 
18) Provisions to Protect the Privacy Interests of Subjects  
The rights and welfare of subjects will be protected by the use of subject codes and the 
removal of all PHI identifiers from the research data and images. The subject code key used to link subject identities to coded data will be kept on a password-protect ed space to 
separate it from the clinical data and images. All identifiers, including the code key used to link subjects to coded data, will be destroyed by electronic deletion at the end of the study. Protected health information will not be re -used or disclosed to any other person or 
entity, expect as required by law or for authorized oversight of the research project. 
19) Compensation for Research- Related Injury  
The research does not involve more than minimal risk to subjects. If a subject is injured as a result of being in this study, the University of California will provide necessary medical treatment. The costs of the treatment may be billed to the subject’s insurance company just like any other medical costs. The University and the study sponsor do not normally provide any other form of compensation for injury. Subjects do not lose any legal rights by signing the informed consent form.  
20) Economic Burden to Subjects  
There are no additional expenses either to the study subjects or to the insurers. Study 
participants  will be provided with $100 gift cards after the completion of each  scanning 
visit to compensate for transportation and other trip costs associated with their participation 
in this study.

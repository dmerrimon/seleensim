  1 INTRODUCTION  
General dentistry can be stressful to both the patient and the doctor due to the fear of 
the needle before most dental procedures. One of the main benefits of using  Laser s is pain 
reduction and anti -inflammation. In some of the references, scientists use e lectrodes inserted 
in the brain of cats or rabbits. They have also placed electrodes in the pulp of teeth to 
measure action potentials as pain is perceived or attenuated. They were able to show that pain 
causes action potential formed and pain reduction (a nalgesia) causes diminishing effects on 
the action potential. However, this is not practical in human study. Using the Visual Analog 
Scale (VAS) is a good way in gauging the patient’s experience of the procedures. Small, 
medium, and large sized cavity prep arations all to be measured. Effort is made to standardize 
the amount of cutting with each technique. The study is aimed to show if there is Laser 
Analgesia and if the use of Low Level Laser Therapy makes a difference in providing better 
analgesia.   
2 DESCRIPTION OF THE INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT  
2.1 Overview   
Lasers have been used in several areas of medicine for a long time, even becoming a 
standard of care for many medical specialties, ophthalmology, dermatology, urology. In 
dentistry, the clinical use of lasers began in the 1980s. In search of the ideal wavelength for 
all dental needs, several manufacturers developed different systems and each had their own 
benefits and limitat ions. Overtime and research, it has been understood how these different 
laser s act on the bio -physical aspect, and that there wasn’t one laser that could answer all our 
needs in dentistry  [3]. Lasers work by emitting a wavelength of high energy light, which 
when focused on a certain skin condition that will create heat and destroy diseased cells. 
These lasers have a very high affinity for tissues containing water . Work performed by 
Ohshiro and Calderhead showed that an Er:YAG laser can be used to achieve laser analgesia 
based on the concept that Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) may oc cur simultaneously with 
high level laser treatment [1]. Laser analgesia does not produce a profound lack of sensation 
as is the case with using an injection anesthesia. It has been shown in  vivo studies that LLLT 
can produce an analgesic effect on nerves t hat innervate the oral cavity by using a near or 
middle infrar ed laser [2, 3, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. It is theorized that LLLT decreases the firing 
frequency of nociceptors (pain receptors), particularly the afferent axons from nociceptors  
that are of low ve locities. The LLLT affects only selective target fibers. As a result, The 
LLLT produces an analgesic effect, but not an anesthetic effect.   
Laser specific to this study is Er,Cr:YSGG (Erbium, Chromium : Yttrium, Scandium, 
Gallium, garnet) which is a waterla se iplus laser from Biolace, Inc. Irvine, CA. This laser is 
the markets best -selling all -tissue laser that is minimally invasive and used for dentistry. It 
features expanded and enhanced capabilities such as the Surefire delivery system and 
REPAIR protocol s to give patients the best expe rience and for practice growth. Waterlase 
 
  iplus offers complete versatility across all tissue types. It is engineered to provide a 
refreshing, comfortable patent experience when compared to traditional tools. It is cleared f or 
over 80 different indication for soft tissue, hard tissue and bone. This is more than any other 
dental laser  out there . Waterlaser iplus leads to results by empowering dentists to offer the 
best possible dental experience with single -visit, multi -quadra nt, minimally invasive 
dentistry.  This system is reliable, durable and flexible for any dental practice.  
Er, Cr:YSGG laser system (279 0nm, middle infrared) for cavity preparation and caries 
removal without the need of injection is one of the most attract ive advantages of using the 
laser [4 , 5, 16, 17, 18, 19].  Due to the plentiful amount of water and air cooling in the 
Er:Cr:YSGG laser, there is no temperature change on the surface.[6] There is already the 
benefit of no side effect of heat on the surfac e of treatment. Different techniques are being 
used to achieve cavity preparation with the Er:Cr:YSGG laser system with no injection 
anesthesia [7]. The results claimed by using the different techniques are generally presented 
based on anecdotal evidence. One group of users may use one setting, typically at higher 
power levels, to perform the entire cavity preparation. A few of these high power examples 
are 6 Watts at 20 Hz, 4.5 Watts at 15 Hz, or 3 Watts at 10 Hz. Another group of users may 
use a moderate power setting to perform the entire cavity preparation such as 4.5 Watts at 20 
Hz, 3.5 Watts at 15 Hz, or 2.5 Watts at 10 Hz and the setting is used. A third group of users 
use different settings for each step of the cavity preparation. They start out usin g relatively 
lower power such as 2 Watts, 30 Hz at a new lesion on the occlusal surface. The power is 
incrementally raised over time until ablation of the tooth takes place. After the cavity is 
removed, a lower power setting is used to finish and smooth th e final preparation. The setting 
used is 2 Watts at 30 Hz. The users of these different techniques all claim they could perform 
cavity preparations without giving injection anesthesia and the patients are comfortable.  
Because of the multiple variables invo lved in cavity preparation and causes of 
discomfort, the study will focus on specific parameters that may induce an analgesic effect. 
There are multiple variables in choice of power and frequencies that different users select for 
cavity preparation. In thi s study, we will focus on specific parameters and cavity preparations 
in small lesions ( 1.5mm  X 1.5mm X 2mm) and in medium ( 2mm X 2m X 2.5mm) / large 
lesions ( 3.5mm X 2.5mm X 3mm ).   
 
2.2 Proposed Intended Use Statement  
The intended use is to find out if there is laser analgesia and if LLLT makes a difference in 
providing better analgesia  to patients . 
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The principal objective of this study is to prove the phenomenon of laser analgesia. 
Traditionally before a cavity preparation is performed,  the doctor will use local anesthetic 
(Needle Injection) before using rotary instrument to do a cavity preparation. The study 
involves using the Er,Cr=YSGG Laser to perform cavity preparation without giving any 
injection anesthesia. VAS (Visual Analog Scal e) will be used to have patients rate the laser 
 
  cavity preparation procedure to show there is laser analgesia. On each patient subject that has 
two similar size cavities of the same classification, either Class I or Class V, on similar teeth. 
Two different  laser protocols will be used. One includes Low Level Laser Therapy (LLLT) 
to condition the pulp producing analgesia before using higher power to perform the cavity 
prep. The other protocol will skip the LLLT setting and prepare the cavity with the higher 
power to perform the cavity prep. The design of the study is to find out if there is laser 
analgesia and if LLLT makes a difference in providing better analgesia. The VAS forms 
from each procedure will be used to show there is laser analgesia and potential ly cavity 
preparations can be performed by using the laser without the need to give injection anesthesia 
first. 
4 STUDY OVERVIEW  
4.1 Study Approach  
Treatment . Preconditioning  and cavity  preparation  are done  using  the Er:Cr:YSGG  laser,  
Waterlase  MD (mfg:  Biolase  Technology  Inc, Irvine  CA),  and the gold hand  piece  with an 
MG6  fiber  tip, trunk  fiber,  contra -angle  hand  piece.  Preconditioning.  Precondit ioning  is 
preformed  using  laser  desensitization.  One tooth  will be randomly  selected,  and 
preconditioning  will be performed  using  LLLT  on the tooth  with minimal  tooth  ablation.  The 
LLLT  settings  that will be used for preconditioning  are 0.25 Watts,  50 Hz, 0% water,  0% air, 
H mode.  Follow ing this a fiber -optic  tip will be aimed  perpendicular  to the surface  of the 
cervical  portion  of the tooth,  ensuring  that a 2mm  distance  will be maintained  between  the 
end of the fiber  optic  tip and the surface.  The fiber -tip will be used to generate  a 2mm  line. 
The cavity  on the second  tooth  will be prepared  for without  laser  preconditioning.  Lesion  
Preparation  – small  preparations.  Small  preparations  are to be performed  as follows.  The 
Waterlase  MD is set to 4.5W,  15 Hz, 65% air, and 60% water  and the cavity is prepared  
according  to the preferred  technique.  If patients  indicate  sensitivity,  the procedure  will be 
halted,  patients  fill out the VAS  form  and anesthetic  will be offered.  For patients  who refuse  
anesthetic,  the procedure  will be continued  at the same  settings.  Lesion  Preparation  – small  
to medium  preparations.  Small  to medium  preparations  will be performed  as follows.  The 
Waterlase  MD will be set to 2W, 15 Hz, 65% air, and 60% water  and the cavity  will be 
prepared  according  to the preferred  techni que. If patients  indicate  sensitivity,  the procedure  
will be halted,  patients  fill out the VAS  form  and anesthetic  will be offered.  For patients  who 
refuse  anesthetic,  the procedure  will be continued  at the same  settings.  
 
Restoration . Overall  VAS Score.  Up to 3 intra-operative  VAS  measurements  are recorded.  If 
a patient  feels  even  the slightest  amount  of pain during  the procedure,  they will be instructed  
to raise  their hand  and the treatment  will be paused.  The patient  is then asked  to fill in the 
VAS  form  before  the procedure  will be continued.  After  conclusion  of the cavity  preparation,  
patients  will be asked  to mark  one last VAS  rating  indicating  the overall  pain of the 
procedure.  Patients  that do not raise  their hand  throughout  the entirety  of the procedure  will 
be given  an overall  VAS  rating  of zero.  Data  for each patient  will be recorded  and analyzed  
in this way.  
 
  Explanation of VAS analysis  
The VAS scale will be presented to the patients using a standard explanation 
(zero, indicating no pain at all, to 100, representing the ‘worst pain patient had ever 
felt’). Patients will be asked to place a vertical line on the VAS scale to indicate 
his/her discomfort status. They are encouraged to stop the treatment if they encounter 
any pain. The num ber of hand raises, as defined by the protocol, will be recorded and 
analyzed (small and medium/large preparations are analyzed separately), represent 
the number of times during the procedure the patient felt sufficient discomfort to stop 
the procedure.  
 VAS data will be  assessed by  the following assumptions : The 'lower' the average 
score, the 'better' the mode of treatment.  Once the patient marks their vertical line on 
the scale, a precise measurement, in millimeters, was taken from the “zero” line of the 
VAS scale to where the patient marked their line.

  7 STUDY PROCEDURES  
7.1 Workflow  
This study will consist of two procedures . Both procedures will be performed  on the same 
patient. Both procedures are cavity preparations.  The tooth is chosen and the first procedure 
is started.  The first one will be done with LLLT protocol prior to using the higher power to 
perform the cavity preparations. The second preparation will be done without LLLT first and 
thus using the higher power laser for cavity preparation from the beginning .  
Laser Preconditioning:  
A. Laser Desensitization/ preconditioning procedure  
a. Randomly select one tooth to have laser preconditioning performed on 
it 
• Preconditioning is using some LLLT on the tooth 
without expecting much , if any,  ablation of the tooth . 
• For preconditioning, the setting is 0.25 Watt, 50Hz, 0% 
water, 0% air, H mode.  
b. Aim fibre -optic tip perpendicular to the surface of cervical portion of 
tooth 
c. Ensure that a 2mm distance between the end of the fiver optic tip and 
the surface is maintained  
d. Go back and forth with the fibre -tip over a 2mm line for the number of 
seconds indicated  
e. Prep the cavity on the first tooth (settings to follow)  
f. Prep the c avity on the second tooth, without laser preconditioning  
Preparation of Lesion:  
               A. Laser ablation - Small  Preparation  
a. Waterlase MD settings: 4.5W, 15Hz, 65% air, 60% water  
b. Prepare cavity preparation using preferred technique  
c. If the patient indicates sensitivity,  
• Halt the procedure  
• Have the patient mark the VAS form,  
• Offer anaesthetic ; if refused, continue using the same settings  
                B. Laser ablation - Small and Medium  Preparation  
a. Waterlase MD settings: 2W, 15Hz, 65% air, 60% water  
b. Prepare cavity preparation using preferred technique  
c. If the patient indicates sensitivity, either  
• Halt the procedure  
 
  • Have the patient mark the VAS form,  
• Offer anaesthetic ; if refused, continue using the same settings  
Restoration :  
▪ Overall VAS Score: Up to 3 intra -operative VAS measurements are recorded. 
If a patient feels even the slightest amount of pain during the procedure, they 
are instructed to raise their hand and the treatment would be paused. The 
patient will then be asked t o fill in the VAS form. The procedure could then 
be continued. After the conclusion of the cavity preparation, the patients are 
asked to mark one last VAS rating indicating the overall pain of the 
procedure.  
 
7.2 Study Data  
Patients included in the study are adults  19-65 years old  who had at least two cavity 
preparations of the same type, with the same approximate size lesion . Excluded patients 
include children, people with language barriers, pregnant women, immune compromised 
patients  compromised (No bronchit is, no sinus infection, no ear infection, ect…) , patients 
with heart disease, uncontrolled hypertension  (high blood pressure) , cardiac arrhythmia, and 
patients whose teeth amalgam restorations were in close proximity to the lesion.  
 
When approved to be in the required parameters subject to  the appropriate  requirements, the 
paperwork will be  read, signed and  collected from each eligible subject . Once all the 
paperwork is filled out the study will then be started.  
7.2.1 Collection of data   
7.3 Randomization and Blinding    
The patient information  (including name, age ect.) will not be associated with the results of 
the study  that will be included in future articles . Dr. William Chen  will only  have record and  
know what results go with what patient s so confidentiality is kept .  
 
7.4 Procedures for Study Closure  
7.4.1 Routine study close -out 
The study will end when Dr. William Chen has obtained all data necessary . Study close -
out will follow Dr. William Chen standard procedures and may include , but is not limited 
to, review of regulatory documents, collection of completed case report forms, 
reconciliation of study records, removal or destruction of ancillary study supplies, and 
 
  informing the Investigator of remaining obligations (e .g., record re tention, final report 
submission to the IRB, financial disclosure updates, etc.).   
7.4.2 Suspension or premature termination of the study   
This study may prematurely terminate at any time because of a regulatory authority 
decision, a change in opinion of the IRB, or at the discretion of the Investigator or 
Sponsor. If this trial is temporarily suspended or prematurely discontinued, Dr. Willia m 
Chen will notify the Investigator(s) and provide instructions. If the study is temporarily 
suspended, Dr. William Chen will provide guidance on timing and procedures for 
resuming the study. If the study is prematurely discontinued, all study materials mu st be 
collected and all study forms completed to the extent possible.  
8 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The study site will be res ponsible for the accuracy of the data collected . 
9 STATISTICAL METHODS  
9.1 Determination of Sample Size  
The total number of individual subjec ts is expected to reach approximately forty -eight 
patients.   This estimate is based on the number of teeth that need  to be done . 
 
n =        c2*N*p*(1 -p)____       
      (A2*N) + (c*2p*[1 -p]) 
 
n = the sample size required  
N = the target population  (50) 
p = is the average proportion of records expected to meet the various criteria (1 -p) is the 
average proportion of records not expected to meet the criteria  if unknown choose 50%  you 
do not want more than 50% you actually prefer to be way under but it is alw ays better to 
estimate higher so you make sure you get enough results for your study.  
A =is the margin of error deemed to be acceptable (2.5%)  
c =is a mathematical constant defined by the Confidence Interval chosen ie (how sure we 
need to be of the result)   
To be 95% sure of the result the constant c = 1.96  which is always given . 
 
A narrower margin of error requires a  larger sample size.  Our margi n of error is 2.5% . 
 
n =        1.692*50*.50*(1 -.50) _______       
      (.0252*50) + (1.96*2.50*[1 -.50])  
 n = 48.42  
Which will get our result of about 48 
patients
 
 
  9.2 Bias Minimization  
All subjects  meeting the specified eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study until all 
spots are filled up.  
9.3 Planned Analyses  
The clinical study report will contain only information necessary to prove this phenomenon . 
 
Statistical analysis will include the VAS forms from each procedure which will be used to 
show there is laser analgesia and potentially cavity preparations can be performed by using 
the laser without the need to give injection anesthesia first . The VAS for m is used to  show  
how much pain they are in  and if  any.  All patient data will remain anonymous  during 
analyses to maintain patient confidentiality.  
 
10 ADVE RSE  EVENT REPORTING   
10.1 Non-Device -Associated Adverse Events  
Adverse events occurring during the enrollme nt period should be documented by the 
Investigator in progress notes, but will not be collected or analyzed unless considered serious 
by the Investigator.   
 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) encountered during study enrollment will be documented by 
the Investi gator and reported immediately upon discovery . SAEs are defined under current 
Good Clinical Practice (cGCP) guidelines as events that result in one or more of the 
following:  
• life-threatening illness or injury;  
• permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function;  
• medically necessary in -patient hospitalization;  
• medical or surgical intervention necessary to prevent permanent impairment 
to body structure or function; or  
• fetal distress, fetal death, or congenital abnormality.  
 
SAEs will be reported using an Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects (UADE) form , which 
serves the dual role of capturing pertinent SAE information per industry guidelines and 
capturing device information pertinent to medical device  standards. Other serious events that 
affect the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects must also be documented on the UADE  form 
and must be reported immediately to the Investigator’s IRB according to that IRB’s policies.  
 
All adverse events that happen du ring this study  will be treated seriously according to the 
appropriate policies , which should be none, will be documented in the patient’s medical 
record  using the UADE form and will be reported immediately to the Investigator’s IRB 
according to that IRB’s  policies.  Also, a F ollow -up will be implemented for AEs that cause 
interruption or discontinuation of the study, or those that are present at the end of study 
treatment as appropriate.  
 
  10.2 Device -Associated Adverse Events  
10.2.1  Definition of an unanticipated adver se device effect (UADE) event  
A UADE  event, as defined by cGCP guidelines, is any SAE, life -threatening problem, or 
death caused by or associated with a device (or with the process of evaluating a device) if 
that SAE, problem, or death was not previously i dentified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated, serious, device -associated problem that relates to the 
rights, safety, or welfare of subjects or operators using the investigational product system or 
the comparator product system.  
10.2.2  Reporting of device -associated adverse events  
Monitoring of adverse events (AEs) is critical to the patient’s safety (i.e., human subjects 
protection) and d ata integrity.  
 
Per this investigational plan, study subjects are not expected to experience any d evice -
associated adverse events.  
 
If instrument operators or research staff employed by the Sponsor experience any adverse 
events associated with study -specif ic use of the investigational device, the events will be 
processed according to the standard complaint investigation and handling policies, which 
may includ e recording of the event in the product’s design history file.

11 RISK ANALYSIS  
11.1 Potential Risks of the Investigational Product and Clinical Investigation  
The procedures used in this study are experimental. However, there is no more of a risk 
during this study than there would be during  any other cavity preparations performed by Dr. 
Chen. If you are having any pain during the procedure, we ask that you please signal us by 
raising your hand. We will  stop the procedure and use injection anesthesia as an option to 
finish the procedure. You may decline to answer any or all questions and you may terminate 
your involvement at any time if you choose with no penalty.  Dr. William Chen

  11.2 Potential Benefits of the Investigational Product and Clinical Investigation  
Subjects are expected to benefit in the way of having better care for their teeth over going to 
your average dentist.  One of the main benefits of using  Laser s is pain reduction and anti -
inflammation . 
 
The studies made possible by the data collected in thi s study are expected to prove the 
phenomenon of laser analgesia .  
11.3 Minimization of Risks  
Although the risk to subjects participating in the study  is anticipated to be minimal, the 
clinician, at his/her discretion, will not collect data from those individuals for whom 
collection is judged to pose an unusu ally high risk of physical or mental harm or discomfort.  
 
Participation in this study poses no risk to study personnel other than that normally 
encountered during standard practice. These risks will be minimized by adherence to the 
following guidelines:  
 
• Personnel should wear appropriate personal protective equipment to avoid contact of 
the eyes or skin with hazardous materials or products derived from biological sources.

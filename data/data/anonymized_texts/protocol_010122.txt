6. BCV A 0.1 logMAR  or better in each eye.  
7. Able to fit with available contact lenses  : within a range of 
powers from +3.00D  to -7.00 and requiring a near ADD of LO, 
MED or HI , as available  
8. Subject must possess spectacles that provide a corrected visual 
acuity of 20/40 or better OU . 
Exclusion Criteria  1. Any anterior segment infection, inflammation, or abnormality or 
disease (including systemic) that contraindicates contact lens 
wear, as determined by the investigator . 
2. Any use of systemic or ocular medications for which contact 
lens wear could be contraind icated, as determined by the 
investigator . 
3. History of refractive surgery or plan to have refractive surgery 
during the study or irregular cornea in either eye.  
4. Ocular or intraocular surgery (excluding placement of punctal 
plugs) within the previous 12 mont hs or planned during the 
study.  
5. Biomicroscopy findings at screening that are moderate (Grade 3) 
or higher and/or corneal vascularization that is mild (Grade 2) or 
higher, and/or any infiltrate.  
6. Current or history of pathologically dry eye in either eye tha t, in 
the opinion of the investigator , would preclude contact lens 
wear.  
7. Current or history of herpetic keratitis in either eye.  
8. Eye injury in either eye within 12 weeks immediately prior to 
enrollment for this trial.  
9. Current or history of intolerance, hyp ersensitivity , or allergy to 
any component of the study products.

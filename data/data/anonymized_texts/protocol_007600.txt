Hypothesis: 
 The interferon gamma ELISPOT assay is a commonly used biomarker  of T-cell activation in 
clinical trials of anti-viral and experimental anti-tumor immun otherapies.  Vigil autologous 
tumor cell immune therapy has induced ELISPOT positivity in 100 % (31 of 31) of patients 
treated in a Phase 2 clinical trial in ovarian cancer.  Several  immune checkpoint inhibitors 
have been tested for anti-tumor activity in advanced ovarian ca ncer and induce responses in 
approximately 15%-20% of patients.  These relatively low respon se rates may be a 
consequence of a low rate of immune activation in ovarian cance r in general.  By safely 
combining Vigil therapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors we ma y broaden and potentially 
deepen the responsiveness of tumors which are largely unrespons ive to checkpoint inhibitors 
alone.  
Summary : 
 This is a 3-part safety study of Vigil in combination with chec kpoint inhibitor atezolizumab, in 
patients with treatment refractory or recurrent epithelial ovar ian cancer, or other gynecological 
cancers (i.e. cervical, uterine). 
 
This study is intended as a companion study to protocol CL-PTL- 119, A Randomized, Double 
Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2 Trial of Vigil Engineered Aut ologous Tumor Cell 
Immunotherapy in Subjects with Stage IIIb-IV Ovarian Cancer in Clinical Complete Response 
following Surgery and Primary Chemotherapy, otherwise known as the VITAL study.  Patients 
who have tumor harvested at surgery and Vigil successfully manu factured, but then are 
ineligible for randomization onto the VITAL study or previously  randomized to placebo, will be 
offered the opportunity to participate in this protocol. 
 Subjects enrolled will either be: 
 Patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Furthermore, subjects who have previously 
received Vigil on this study may be considered for re-procureme nt for manufacture of 
Vigil (after consultation and approval from Sponsor) and re-enr olled into Part 2 (see 
below). 
OR 
 Patients with ovarian cancer who failed to meet the eligibilit y criteria for Protocol CL-
PTL-119 because of failure to achieve a complete clinical respo nse following primary 
debulking surgery and standard paclitaxel/carboplatin therapy,  
OR 
 Patients who failed to meet the eligibility criteria for Proto col CL-PTL-119 because of a 
histologic diagnosis of another gynecological cancer (i.e., cer vical, uterine) and not 
ovarian cancer. 
OR 
 Patients who were randomized on Protocol CL-PTL-119 and were s ubsequently 
unblinded at recurrence and were assigned to the placebo arm.

It is the user’s responsibility to ve rify adequate training before executing a doc ument.  Do not make unauthorized copies  The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety o f the Vigil and atezolizumab 
combination.  Secondary objectives include determination of the  immune response rate to 
Vigil alone, atezolizumab alone and the combination of the two agents.  In patients with 
measureable disease, anti-tumor activity as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria, will also be 
summarized and correlated to baseline tumor mutation burden, ba seline PD-L1 expression, 
post treatment TIL infiltration, change in PD-L1 expression and  circulating tumor cell 
response.  Overall assessment of time to progression and surviv al will also be summarized 
for each cohort.  Assuming no untoward adverse effects from the  combination of Vigil with 
atezolizumab, the treatment of 20-25 patients should be suffici ent to assess safety and 
provide an estimate of the immune response rate and RECIST resp onse rate. 
 
Part 1 The first part will be a safety run-in where the initial 3 subj ects registered will receive the 
combination of Vigil plus atezolizumab.  Part 1 will evaluate t he safety of Vigil in combination 
with atezolizumab. 
 
Vigil immunotherapy will be administered at a concentration of 1x10
7 cells/dose given via 
intradermal injection every 3 weeks for a minimum of 4 doses an d a maximum of 12 doses.  
Atezolizumab will be administered at the FDA approved dose and schedule as described in 
the U.S. Package Insert (USPI).  Thus, atezolizumab is to be ad ministered at a dose of 
1200mg as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.  The initial d ose is to be administered over 
one hour and if well tolerated, subsequent infusions may be adm inistered over 30 minutes.  
Vigil should be administered first, followed 30 minutes later b y atezolizumab. 
 The first subject to receive the combination of Vigil plus atez olizumab must complete the first 
21-day cycle of combination therapy without serious, unexpected  toxicity before the 
enrollment of any patients into Part 2 can occur. 
 
Part 2 Part 2 is a randomized, open label intra-patient crossover stud y of Vigil, the checkpoint 
inhibitor atezolizumab and the combination of the two agents.  Eligible patients will be 
randomized to receive two cycles of Vigil alone or two cycles o f atezolizumab alone, followed 
by combination treatment with both agents. 
 Vigil immunotherapy will be administered at a concentration of 1 x 10
6 or 1x107 cells/dose 
given via intradermal injection every 3 weeks for a minimum of 4 doses and a maximum of 12 
doses. 
 
Atezolizumab will be administered at the FDA approved dose and schedule as described in 
the U.S. Package Insert (USPI).  Thus, atezolizumab is to be ad ministered at a dose of 1200 
mg as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks, with a maximum of 12 doses.  The initial dose 
is to be administered over one hour and if well tolerated, subs equent infusions may be 
administered over 30 minutes. When combined, Vigil should be ad ministered first, followed 30 
minutes later by atezolizumab. 
 Atezolizumab related safety events, include, but are not limite d to immune related 
pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, meningitis/e ncephalitis, neuropathies and

the occurrence of a Grade 3 or 4 toxicity attributed to Vigil w ill result in the cessation of Vigil 
dosing and continuation of single agent atezolizumab only. 
 Part 3 
Part 3 is an expansion cohort tha t allows for subjects who have  completed all cycles of Part 2 
as noted above to continue on atezolizumab alone, after Cycle 1 2.  Eligible subjects will be 
pre-approved by Sponsor for inclusion into Part 3.  Subjects ma y continue on single agent 
atezolizumab until disease progression. 
 
Atezolizumab will be administered at the FDA approved dose and schedule as described in 
the U.S. Package Insert (USPI).  Thus, atezolizumab is to be ad ministered at a dose of 1200 
mg as an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks. 
 Atezolizumab related safety events include, but are not limited  to immune related 
pneumonitis, hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, meningitis/e ncephalitis, neuropathies and 
pancreatitis are to be managed per the guidelines in the USPI. 
 Part 1, radiological assessment of tumor response will be perfo rmed at baseline and every 
third cycle thereafter.  Tumor biopsy for correlative studies i ncluding scoring of tumor 
infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) and PD-1 / PD-L1 expression analy sis will be obtained at tissue 
procurement and at any time after the end of cycle 3.  Whole bl ood for correlative studies 
(immune function) will be obtained at baseline, prior to study agent administration at the start 
of cycle 3 and every third cycle thereafter. 
 Part 2, radiological assessment of tumor response will be perfo rmed at baseline, at the end of 
cycle 2 of single agent therapy, and every third cycle thereaft er.  Tumor biopsy for correlative 
studies including scoring of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL ) and PD-1 / PD-L1 expression 
analysis will be obtained at tissue procurement, prior to the s tart of combination therapy and 
at any time after the end of cycle 3.  Whole blood for correlat ive studies (immune function) will 
be obtained at baseline, prior to study agent administration at  the start of cycle 3 (the first 
cycle of combination therapy) and every third cycle thereafter.  
 
Part 3 schedule of assessments are noted in Appendix C.  The sc hedule will continue from 
Part 2 in which the following will be assessed every third cycl e: radiological assessments, 
tumor biopsy (if available), and whole blood collection for cor relative studies. 
 
The safety evaluation will include AEs, SAEs, and changes from baseline in laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, electr ocardiograms, and physical exam inations. The number and 
percentage of subjects reporting treatment-emergent AEs will be  summarized overall and by 
the worst Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE ) grade, system organ 
class, and preferred term.  Similarly, the number and percentag e of subjects reporting 
treatment-emergent AEs considered related to investigational pr oduct will be summarized.  At 
each level of subject summarization, a subject will be counted once using the highest grade 
and level of causality if one or more occurrences of the same s ystem organ class/preferred 
term is reported.

 BACKGROUND 
 
 Unmet Medical Need in Ovarian Cancer 
 
The majority of women diagnosed with cancer of the ovary presen t in an advanced stage 
(Jemal, Siegel et al. 2009) with 5-year survival rates of 59% f or Stage IIIa, 52% for Stage IIIb, 
39% for Stage IIIc (Heintz, Odicino et al. 2006), and 17% for S tage IV (American Cancer 
Society).   
 
The established standard of care for newly diagnosed ovarian ca ncer is maximal de-bulking 
surgery followed by 6 months of c hemotherapy with paclitaxel an d carboplatin.  About 75% of 
patients will be in complete remission following this front-lin e management. 
 
Unfortunately, approximately 75% of the women with Stage III/IV  ovarian cancer who achieve a 
complete clinical response will relapse, as will 50% of those a chieving pathologic complete 
response, with a median time to relapse of 16-24 months followi ng chemotherapy, depending 
on risk factors (Gadducci, Sartori et al. 1998; Markman, Liu et  al. 2003; Gadducci, Cosio et al. 
2005).  Once relapsed, ovarian cancer is incurable, and the goa ls of treatment are primarily to 
prevent further disease progression and to palliate symptoms of  advancing cancer. 
 
A variety of treatment options are available for relapsed ovari an cancer.  The type of treatment 
offered depends on the timing of relapse.  Women who relapse 6 months or more after 
completion of chemotherapy are generally considered platinum se nsitive and are treated with 
platinum doublet regimens such as carboplatin plus paclitaxel o r carboplatin plus gemcitabine.  
Women who progress while receiving platinum doublet therapy or relapse in less than 6 months 
after completion of platinum doublet chemotherapy are considere d platinum resistant.  These 
patients generally receive sequential single agent chemotherapy  with drugs such as pegylated 
liposomal doxorubicin, topotecan, weekly paclitaxel or the targ eted agent olaparib, used only in 
patients whose tumor expresses BRCA mutations. 
 
The anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab has been found to improve  relapse free and 
progression free survival when combined with initial chemothera py or with chemotherapy 
following relapse.  Dosing recommendations for bevacizumab in o varian cancer allow for the 
continuation of single agent bevacizumab following the completi on of chemotherapy until such 
time as the patient’s disease progresses or toxicity intervenes . 
 
A number of studies have attempted to improve outcome in ovaria n cancer by administering 
maintenance therapy after patients have achieved a complete res ponse following standard 
paclitaxel/carboplatin combination therapy.  None of these stud ies have demonstrated any 
advantage in relapse free (Sabbatini, Harter et al. 2013) or ov erall survival (Markman, Liu et al. 
2009; Sabbatini, Harter et al. 2013) and (Burger, Brady et al. 2011; Perren, Swart et al. 2011).  
In addition, a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of  maintenance chemotherapy in 
1644 women accrued to 8 trials concluded no significant differe nce in three-, five- and 10-year 
OS or PFS (Mei, Chen et al. 2013).  A subsequent, independent t rial-sequential analysis of 
these same data reached the same conclusion (Messori, Fadda et al. 2013).

In summary, the poor survival in advanced ovarian cancer is due  both to late diagnosis, as well 
as to the lack of effective therapy for patients who relapse. T he clinical course of ovarian cancer 
patients is marked by periods of remission and relapse of seque ntially shortening duration until 
chemotherapy resistance develops . Therefore, new treatment moda lities and paradigms are 
needed in order to significantly improve the prognosis of women  diagnosed with epithelial 
ovarian cancer. 
 
 Rationale for Immunotherapy in Ovarian Cancer 
 
One promising avenue of clinical re search in ovarian cancer is the use of immunotherapy, 
including immune checkpoint inhibitors and cellular immunothera pies.  An increasing body of 
data indicates that antitumor immunity impacts the clinical out come of ovarian cancer. Recent 
reports have detailed how ovarian cancer cells can acquire pote ntial escape mechanisms to 
evade host immunity via several immunosuppressive factors, incl uding a loss of MHC 
expression and the upregulation of immunosuppressive factors in cluding TGF-beta, indoleamine 
2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2). 
 
Increased expression of immunosuppressive TGF  isoforms in ovarian tumor as compared with 
normal ovarian tissue has been reported (Henriksen, Gobl et al.  1995; Bristow, Baldwin et al. 
1999) with significant increases in TGF 1 in both primary (2.9 fold; p ≤ 0.002) and recurrent (4.4 
fold; p ≤ 0.002) ovarian cancer (Bristow, Baldwin et al. 1999).   Secreted TGFβ from ovarian 
cancer cells generate immunosuppressive Treg cells (CD4+CD25+) from peripheral 
CD4+CD25- cells (Li, Ye et al. 2007).  Both Treg tumor infiltra tion and the granzyme 
B+/FOX3p+ ratio are associated with poor outcome in patients wi th high-grade serous ovarian 
carcinoma treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Polcher, Braun  et al. ; Milne, Kobel et al. 
2009).  The CD8/Treg ratio is also a prognostic indicator (Sato , Olson et al. 2005). 
 
An additional immunosuppressive mechanism shown to be active in  the ovarian cancer tumor 
microenvironment is enhanced immune checkpoint signaling via B7 /CTLA4 and PD-1/PD-L1.  
The increasing knowledge of these immunosuppressive mechanisms in ovarian cancer 
highlights the importance of developing new treatment strategie s in ovarian cancer.  This study 
aims to explore the application of one such novel strategy, the  combination of immune 
checkpoint inhibitor therapy and autologous cellular immunother apy. 
 Following their successful development in other solid tumors li ke melanoma and non-small cell 
lung cancer, several immune checkpoint inhibitors are now being  developed as therapeutics in 
ovarian cancer.  The immune checkpoint inhibitors target molecu les which dampen the normal 
human immune response and preven t uncontrolled immune stimulati on.  In ovarian cancer, 
cancer cells and tumor associated myeloid cells have been found  to over express the ligand 
PD-L1 (Curiel, Wei et al. 2003; Liu, Chen et al. 2008; Abiko, M andai et al. 2013), and 
expression of PD-L1 has been associated with decreased tumor in filtrating lymphocytes (TILs) 
and poor overall survival (Ham anishi, Mandai et al. 2007).  The se immune inhibitory proteins 
are overexpressed in the tumo r microenvironment and prevent nor mal immune surveillance. 
 
By blocking these inhibitory molecules, anti-cancer immune resp onses are restored and 
enhanced.  In animal models, blockade of PD-1 and PD-L1 has bee n shown to eradicate tumors

I/II studies with several of the immune checkpoint inhibitors d irected against PD-1 or PD-L1, 
single agent response rates of approximately 6% to 20% were obs erved in patients with 
advanced, relapsed ovarian cancer.  Durable partial responses a s well as some complete 
responses were reported.  As a result, several of these agents have progressed to Phase III 
clinical trials. 
 
 Vigil 
 
Vigil immunotherapy is one of the more advanced cellular immuno therapies being studies in 
clinical trials.  It is composed of autologous tumor cells harv ested from the patient at the time of 
initial de-bulking surgery which are then transfected extra-cor poreally, with a plasmid encoding 
for the gene for GM-CSF, an immune-stimulatory cytokine, and a bifunctional, short hairpin RNA 
which specifically knocks down the expression of furin, the cri tical convertase responsible for 
production of the two TGβ isoforms (TGFβ-1 and TGFβ-2). Followi ng manufacture, Vigil is 
administered to the patient from whom the tumor was harvested, via intra-dermal injection, once 
per month.  The rationale for the Vigil construct is outlined b elow. 
 Dendritic cells prime antigen-specific immune responses (Zeng, Wang et al. 2001) and express 
diverse receptors that allow for the recognition and capture of  antigens in peripheral tissues like 
the dermis.  They process this material efficiently into the MH C Class I and II presentation 
pathways, upregulate costimulatory molecules upon maturation, a nd migrate to secondary 
lymphoid tissues (Banchereau, Briere et al. 2000) where they pr esent the antigens to T cells. 
 Increasing evidence suggests that GMCSF is involved in the augm entation of tumor antigen 
presentation by dendritic cells (DCs) (Dranoff, Jaffee et al. 1 993; Huang, Golumbek et al. 1994).  
It has been shown to induce a subset of DCs that are superior f or the phagocytosis of apoptotic 
tumor cells (Young and Inaba 1996; Pulendran, Lingappa et al. 1 997; Shen, Reznikoff et al. 
1997).  It evokes higher levels of co-stimulatory molecules, wh ich is characteristic of greater 
functional maturation and more efficient T cell stimulation, th ereby broadening the arsenal of 
induced lymphocyte effector mechanisms (Murtaza, Kuchroo et al.  1999).  GMCSF also 
promotes the presentation of lipid antigens by dendritic cells which in turn leads to activation of 
Natural Killer T cells (NKT cells) a population of lymphocytes that may be pivotal in both 
endogenous and therapeutic responses to tumors (Smyth, Crowe et  al. 2002). 
 The immune suppressor functions of TGFβ are likely to play a ma jor role in modulating the 
effectiveness of cancer immunot herapy.  TGFβ inhibits GMCSF ind uced maturation of bone 
marrow derived dendritic cells (DCs) (Yamaguchi, Tsumura et al.  1997) as well as expression of 
MHC Class II and co-stimulatory molecules (Geissmann, Revy et a l. 1999).  It has been shown 
that antigen presentation by immature DCs result in T cell unre sponsiveness (Steinman, 
Hawiger et al. 2003).  TGFβ also inhibits activated macrophages  (Ashcroft 1999) including their 
antigen presenting function (Du and Sriram 1998; Takeuchi, Alar d et al. 1998).  The ubiquitous 
expression of the TGFβ isoforms as well as the inhibitory effec ts of these isoforms have on 
GMCSF immune stimulatory funct ion provide a strong rationale fo r combining TGFβ 
suppression and GMCSF upregulation within a single immunotherap eutic construct.

It is the user’s responsibility to ve rify adequate training before executing a doc ument.  Do not make unauthorized copies  Within the Vigil construct, the suppression of TGFβ isoforms is  achieved by knocking down the 
expression of furin.  Furin is a member of the subtilisin-like proprotein convertase family, an 
upstream regulator of the TGFβ isoforms.  Furin is required for  proteolytic activation of both 
TGFβ-1 and TGFβ-2.  High levels of furin mRNA and furin protein  are widely expressed in 
human tumors and, specifically, in ovarian tumors (Page, Klein- Szanto et al. 2007) where the 
gene  is differentially expressed (compared to normal human ova rian surface epithelium cell 
lines) and the level appears to be inversely correlated with su rvival (Page, Klein-Szanto et al. 
2007).  The presence of furin in tumor cells likely contributes  significantly to the maintenance of 
tumor directed, TGFβ-mediated peripheral immune tolerance (Pesu , Watford et al. 2008).  Down 
regulation of furin can be expected to simultaneously reduce TG Fβ-1 and TGFβ-2 levels.  
Indeed, this has been demonstrated consistently in the manufact ure of Vigil for completed and 
ongoing clinical trials. 
 
 Vigil Clinical Experience 
 
Since the initiation of clinical trials with Vigil in 2009, ove r 160 patients have received treatment 
with the therapy and over 900 doses have been administered in c ompleted and ongoing studies.  
The most frequently reported adverse reactions attributed to Vi gil engineered cell administration 
are injection site reactions which are mild to moderate in inte nsity, consisting primarily of 
redness and swelling at the injection site.  These occur in ess entially all Vigil treated patients.  
To date, there have been no severe or life threatening (CTC Gra de 3 or 4) adverse events 
attributed to Vigil treatment. 
 An early report (Senzer et. al. 2012) summarized the initial ex perience in 27 patients treated 
with the Vigil cellular immunotherapy construct (named FANG at the time), and in a matched 
control group of 18 patients.  All patients underwent surgery f or procurement of tumor tissue and 
manufacture of Vigil, however, the matched control group of 18 patients did not receive Vigil due 
to patient choice (14), failure to satisfy eligibility criteria  (2) or failure of manufacture (2).  Patient 
characteristics and dosing information are summarized in Table 1 below.

It is the user’s responsibility to ve rify adequate training before executing a doc ument.  Do not make unauthorized copies  Both GMCSF transgene expression and downregulation of expressio n of TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 
were apparent in all successfully manufactured Vigil preparatio ns.  Mean post-transfection 
GMCSF expression increased from 7.3 to 1,108 pg/106 cells/ml.  Mean TGFβ1 and β2 
knockdown were 93.5% and 92.5%, respectively. 
 Of the Vigil treated patients, 4 out of 27 had rapidly progress ive disease after 1 or 2 injections of 
Vigil and were removed from study.  The remaining 23 patients h ad stable disease as their best 
response to therapy and received between 3 and 11 monthly injec tions of Vigil.  Median survival 
of the Vigil treated patients was 554 days when measured from t issue procurement and was not 
reached when measured from start of Vigil treatment.  The 18 pa tients who had tumor 
harvested but did not receive Vigil therapy survived a median o f 132 days from tissue 
procurement (p < 0.0001).  There were no apparent differences i n response to treatment, 
survival or safety profile by dose level of the Vigil construct . 
 
The interferon gamma ELISPOT assay was piloted as a clinical bi omarker of immune activation 
in 18 of 27 Vigil treated patients on the study.  Only 1 of 18 patients demonstrated immune 
activation at baseline.  Nine of 18 patients converted to ELISP OT positivity by month 4 of Vigil 
treatment and remained positive throughout treatment and in som e cases for up to 6 months 
afterwards.  A tenth patient was noted to convert to ELISPOT po sitivity at 6 months after the 
start of Vigil.  Interestingly, the survival of ELISPOT positiv e patients was significantly longer 
than that of patients who failed to convert to positivity (p = 0.045 from time of tissue 
procurement or p = 0.025 from start of Vigil treatment). 
 The association of TGFβ expression with poor outcome in ovarian  cancer coupled with the 
safety, biomarker and survival correlations reported in the fir st-in-human study, provided the 
basis for a randomized Phase 2 study of Vigil Immunotherapy as maintenance therapy in 
women who achieved complete clinical response (cCR) following s urgical de-bulking and 
standard, paclitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy.  Following surge ry and chemotherapy, patients 
in the control arm underwent regular observation for recurrence , which is current standard of 
care (SOC).  Patients randomized to the control arm were permit ted to cross-over and receive 
their Vigil at the time of recurrence. 
 Eligible patients were initially randomized 2 (Vigil): 1 (SOC).   Patients received 1.0 x 10
7 cells / 
intradermal injection of Vigil once per month for up to 12 dose s as long as sufficient material 
was available.  Tumor procurement needed to be sufficient to su pply a minimum of 4 monthly 
injections in order for a patient to be entered into the study.   Treatment was continued until 
disease recurrence or exhaustion of the patient’s vaccine suppl y.  Clinical adverse events, as 
reported by the patient, were assessed continuously. Other sche duled safety assessments 
included monthly physical examination, performance status, heig ht, weight, vital signs and 
laboratory evaluations.  The primary efficacy endpoint was recu rrence free survival assessed 
radiographically by the investigators. CA-125 was monitored at baseline, monthly for the first 
year, every 3 months ± 2 weeks  for the second and third year. 
 Serial immune function analysis i ncluding ELISPOT analysis of m ononuclear cell function to 
pre-processed autologous tumor cells was monitored at baseline (screening), prior to Vigil 
injection and at Months 2, 4, 6 and at end of treatment (EOT).  A positive response was defined 
as > 10 ELISPOTs induced per 10
6 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and twice 
baseline response.

Results are reported in a total of 42 patients, 31 in the Vigil  arm and 11 in the control arm.  The 
original randomized design was abandoned after 21 patients were  randomized into the Vigil arm 
of the study and 11 to the control arm, when the sponsor decide d to initiate a definitive Phase 3 
study.  At that time, an additional 10 patients who were comple ting chemotherapy were allowed 
to receive Vigil without randomization.  
 A total of 241 intradermal (ID) injections of Vigil were admini stered to the 31 patients.  The most 
frequent treatment emergent adverse events, considered related to therapy were injection site 
reactions of CTCAE Grade 1 or 2, which occurred in essentially all Vigil treated patients.  There 
were no CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 treatment related adverse events amo ngst the Vigil treated 
patients. 
 
At baseline, 30 of 31 Vigil treated patients and 10 of 11 contr ol patients demonstrated negative 
ELISPOT reactivity prior to Vigil treatment at time of randomiz ation.  One Vigil treated patient 
was actually ELISPOT positive at baseline and one control patie nt was inevaluable for ELISPOT 
reactivity.  Following Vigil injection a positive ELISPOT respo nse was observed in 31 of the 31 
Vigil treated patients (median ELISPOT reactivity was 134; rang e, 12-448 spots).  The positive 
responses were first observed at Month 2 (n=28), 3 (n=1), 4 (n= 1) and 9 (n=1).  In the control 
arm, 7 of the 8 patients who relapsed and elected to cross over  to receive Vigil, were ELISPOT 
negative at the time of relapse and converted to positive ELISP OT by Month 2. 
 Comparison of RFS from time of procurement between Vigil or con trol patients following 
consolidation treatment with carboplatin/paclitaxel is summariz ed in Table 2 and shown in

On the basis of these results, a definitive comparison of maint enance Vigil vs. standard 
observation is underway in women with epithelial ovarian cancer  who have achieved a complete 
clinical response following surgical de-bulking and standard pa clitaxel/carboplatin chemotherapy 
(CL-PTL-119).  The study, A Randomized, Double Blind, Placebo C ontrolled trial of Vigil 
Autologous Tumor Cell Immunotherapy in Subjects with Stage IIIb -IV Ovarian Cancer in Clinical 
Complete Response following Surgery and Primary Chemotherapy is  otherwise known as the 
VITAL study. 
 
This study is intended as a companion to VITAL for those women who fail to achieve a complete 
clinical response following standard chemotherapy and are thus ineligible for randomization. 
 
 STUDY RATIONALE 
 
Early clinical results with both the checkpoint inhibitors and Vigil in ovarian cancer are 
promising.  Given the complementary mode of action of the two a gents, it is sensible to explore 
a combination of the two immunotherapy modalities.

 STUDY DESIGN 
 
This is a 3-part safety study of Vigil in combination with chec kpoint inhibitor atezolizumab, in 
patients with treatment refractory or recurrent epithelial ovar ian cancer, or other gynecological 
cancers (i.e. cervical, uterine). 
 This study is intended as a companion study to protocol CL-PTL- 119, A Randomized, Double 
Blind, Placebo-Controlled Phase 2 Trial of Vigil Engineered Aut ologous Tumor Cell 
Immunotherapy in Subjects with Stage IIIb-IV Ovarian Cancer in Clinical Complete Response 
following Surgery and Primary Chemotherapy, otherwise known as the VITAL study or 
previously randomized to placebo.  Patients who have tumor harv ested at surgery and Vigil 
successfully manufactured, but then are ineligible for randomiz ation onto the VITAL study, will 
be offered the opportunity to participate in this protocol. 
 Subjects enrolled will either be: 
 
 Patients with recurrent ovarian cancer. Furthermore, subjects who have previously 
received Vigil on this study may be considered for re-procureme nt for manufacture of 
Vigil (after consultation and approval from Sponsor) and re-enr olled into Part 2 (see 
below). 
OR 
 Patients with ovarian cancer who failed to meet the eligibilit y criteria for Protocol CL-
PTL-119 because of failure to achieve a complete clinical respo nse following primary 
debulking surgery and standard paclitaxel/carboplatin therapy,  
OR 
 Patients who fail to meet the eligibility criteria for Protoco l CL-PTL-119 because of a 
histologic diagnosis of another gynecological cancer (i.e., cer vical, uterine) and not 
ovarian cancer. 
OR 
 Patients who were randomized on Protocol CL-PTL-119 and were s ubsequently 
unblinded at recurrence and were assigned to the placebo arm.

It is the user’s responsibility to ve rify adequate training before executing a doc ument.  Do not make unauthorized copies  The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety o f the Vigil and atezolizumab 
combination.  Secondary objectives include determination of imm une response rate to Vigil 
alone, atezolizumab alone and the combination of the two agents .  In patients with measureable 
disease, anti-tumor activity as assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria , will also be summarized and 
correlated to baseline tumor mutation burden, baseline PD-L1 ex pression, post treatment TIL 
infiltration, change in PD-L1 expression and circulating tumor cell response.  Overall 
assessment of time to progression and survival will also be sum marized for each cohort.  
Assuming no untoward adverse effects from the combination of Vi gil with atezolizumab, the 
treatment of 20-25 patients should be sufficient to assess safe ty and provide an estimate of the 
immune response rate and RECIST response rate. 
 
Part 1 
The first part will be a safety run-in where the initial 3 subj ects registered will receive the 
combination of Vigil plus atezolizumab.  Part 1 will evaluate t he safety of Vigil in combination 
with atezolizumab. 
 
Vigil immunotherapy will be administered at a concentration of 1x107 cells/dose given via 
intradermal injection every 3 weeks for a minimum of 4 doses an d a maximum of 12 doses.  
Atezolizumab will be administered at the FDA approved dose and schedule as described in the 
U.S. Package Insert (USPI).  Thus, atezolizumab is to be admini stered at a dose of 1200 mg as 
an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.  The initial dose is to be administered over one hour and 
if well tolerated, subsequent infusions may be administered ove r 30 minutes.  Vigil should be 
administered first, followed 30 minutes later by atezolizumab. 
 
The first subject to receive the combination of Vigil plus atez olizumab must complete the first 
21-day cycle of combination therapy without serious, unexpected  toxicity before the enrollment 
of any patients into Part 2 can occur. 
 
Part 2 
Part 2 is a randomized, open label intra-patient crossover stud y of Vigil, the checkpoint inhibitor 
atezolizumab and the combination of the two agents.  Eligible p atients will be randomized to 
receive two cycles of Vigil alone or two cycles of atezolizumab  alone, followed by combination 
treatment with both agents. 
 Vigil immunotherapy will be administered at a concentration of 1 x 10
6 or 1x107 cells/dose given 
via intradermal injection every 3 weeks for a minimum of 4 dose s and a maximum of 12 doses. 
 
Atezolizumab will be administered at the FDA approved dose and schedule as described in the 
U.S. Package Insert (USPI).  Thus, atezolizumab is to be admini stered at a dose of 1200 mg as 
an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks, with a maximum of 12 dos es.  The initial dose is to be 
administered over one hour and if well tolerated, subsequent in fusions may be administered 
over 30 minutes. When combined, Vigil should be administered fi rst, followed 30 minutes later 
by atezolizumab. 
 Atezolizumab related safety events include, but are not limited  to immune related pneumonitis, 
hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, meningitis/encephalitis, neuropathies and pancreatitis are to 
be managed per the guidelines in the USPI.  For combination tre atment, the occurrence of a

It is the user’s responsibility to ve rify adequate training before executing a doc ument.  Do not make unauthorized copies  Grade 3 or 4 toxicity attributed to Vigil will result in the ce ssation of Vigil dosing and continuation 
of single agent atezolizumab only. 
 
Part 3 
Part 3 is an expansion cohort tha t allows for subjects who have  completed all cycles of Part 2 as 
noted above to continue on atezolizumab alone, after Cycle 12.  Eligible patients will be pre-
approved by Sponsor for inclusion into Part 3.  Subjects may co ntinue on single agent 
atezolizumab until disease progression. 
 
Atezolizumab will be administered at the FDA approved dose and schedule as described in the 
U.S. Package Insert (USPI).  Thus, atezolizumab is to be admini stered at a dose of 1200 mg as 
an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.

hepatitis, colitis, endocrinopathies, meningitis/encephalitis, neuropathies and pancreatitis are to 
be managed per the guidelines in the USPI. 
 Part 1, radiological assessment of tumor response will be perfo rmed at baseline and every third 
cycle thereafter.  Tumor biopsy for correlative studies includi ng scoring of tumor infiltrating 
lymphocyte (TIL) and PD-1 / PD-L1 expression analysis will be o btained at tissue procurement 
and at any time after the end of cycle 3.  Whole blood for corr elative studies (immune function) 
will be obtained at baseline, prior to study agent administrati on at the start of cycle 3 and every 
third cycle thereafter. 
 
Part 2, radiological assessment of tumor response will be perfo rmed at baseline, at the end of 
cycle 2 of single agent therapy and every third cycle thereafte r.  Tumor biopsy for correlative 
studies including scoring of tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL ) and PD-1 / PD-L1 expression 
analysis will be obtained at tissue procurement, prior to the s tart of combination therapy and at 
any time after the end of cycle 3.  Whole blood for correlative  studies (immune function) will be 
obtained at baseline, at the start of cycle 3 (the first cycle of combination therapy) and every 
third cycle thereafter. 
 Part 3 schedule of assessments are noted in Appendix C.  The sc hedule will continue from Part 
2 in which the following will be assessed every third cycle: ra diological assessments, tumor 
biopsy (if available), and whole blood collection for correlati ve studies. 
 
The safety evaluation will include all adverse events (AEs), se rious adverse events (SAEs) and 
adverse events of special intere st (AESIs) as well as changes f rom baseline in laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, electr ocardiograms, and physical exam inations. The number and 
percentage of subjects reporting treatment emergent AEs will be  summarized overall and by the 
worst Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) gr ade, system organ class, 
and preferred term.  Similarly, the number and percentage of su bjects reporting treatment-
emergent AEs considered related to investigational product will  be summarized.  At each level 
of subject summarization, a subject will be counted once using the highest grade and level of 
causality if one or more occurrences of the same system organ c lass/preferred term is reported.  
Adverse events will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v4.03

 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
 
 Subject Screening and Registration 
 
Written documentation of full, unconditional IRB approval of th e protocol and consent document 
must be on file before a subject can be screened.  Study partic ipation begins once written 
informed consent is obtained. 
 
The Research Nurse or Clinical Research Coordinator will regist er the subject via email 
addressed to the Sponsor. 
 Please allow 48 hours for subject registration as the subject’s  source documents will be 
reviewed to ensure they meet t he inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Once confirmed, the site will be 
notified of eligibility by the Sponsor. 
 
 Study Treatment Administration 
 
Treatment will be administered on an outpatient  basis. 
 
6.2.1 Schedule, Dose and Administration 
 
Subjects will receive Vigil and atezolizumab according to the s chedule outlined in Appendix B. 
 
A study cycle is defined as 21 days (3 weeks). 
 Vigil immunotherapy will be administered at a concentration of 1 x 10
6 or 1x107 cells/dose given 
via intradermal injection every 3 weeks for a minimum of 4 dose s and a maximum of 12 doses. 
 
Atezolizumab will be administered at the FDA approved dose and schedule as described in the 
U.S. Package Insert (USPI).  Thus, atezolizumab is to be admini stered at a dose of 1200 mg as 
an intravenous infusion every 3 weeks.  The initial dose is to be administered over one hour and 
if well tolerated, subsequent infusions may be administered ove r 30 minutes.

The sites of injection for Vigil will be rotated between the ri ght and left upper arms.  If the 
ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes w ere radiated or surgically re moved during prior therapy, 
alternative sites will be used.  Subjects receiving Vigil will be observed for at least 30 minutes 
following administration. 
 Investigational treatment may continue unless documented diseas e progression, discontinuation 
for toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or meeting other criteria for withdrawal from study detailed in 
Section 5.6. 
 
6.2.2 Dose Reduction / Escalation 
 
Dose reduction or dose increase is not allowed for Vigil or ate zolizumab. 
 
Dose Holding Criteria 
 Both atezolizumab and Vigil should be held for any of the follo wing AEs.  Cycles held for toxicity 
should be made up (that cycle number is delayed rather than ski pped).  Atezolizumab and Vigil 
held may be resumed in patients whose AEs recover to Grade 0-1,  with the exception of rash, 
which should recover to Grade 2 or better. 
 
 Grade 2 pneumonitis 
 Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase ( ALT) greater than 3 and 
up to 5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or total bilirubin gr eater than 1.5 and up to 3 
times ULN 
 Grade 2 or 3 diarrhea or colitis 
 Symptomatic hypophysitis, adrenal  insufficiency, hypothyroidis m, hyperthyroidism, or 
Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia 
 Grade 2 ocular inflammatory toxicity 
 Grade 2 or 3 pancreatitis, or Grade 3 or 4 increases in amylas e or lipase levels (greater 
than 2.0 times ULN)  
 Grade 3 or 4 infection 
 Grade 2 infusion-related reactions 
 Grade 3 rash 
 Grade 2 nephritis 
 Based on the mechanism of action of atezolizumab leading to T-c ell activation and proliferation, 
there is the possibility of observing immune related Adverse Ev ents (irAEs) during the conduct 
of this study.  Potential irAEs include immune related colitis,  pneumonitis, hepatitis, and 
endocrinopathies. Subjects should be monitored for signs and sy mptoms of irAEs.  Subjects 
should be monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs.  In the ab sence of an alternate etiology 
(e.g., infection or PD) signs or symptoms of colitis, pneumonit is, hepatitis, and endocrinopathy 
should be considered to be immune-related.

 Treatment beyond Initial Progression in Select Cases 
 
There is accumulating evidence that some subjects treated with immune system stimulating 
agents may appear to demonstrate progression of disease by conv entional response criteria 
before demonstrating clinical objective responses and/or stable  disease and ultimately survival 
benefit. This phenomenon has been observed in studies with inhi bitors of both the CTLA-4 and 
PD-1/PD-L1 pathways. It may be that enhanced inflammation withi n tumors initially leads to an 
increase in tumor size or new ly visible small lesions. Over tim e, both the malignant and 
inflammatory portions of the mass may then decrease leading to overt signs of clinical 
improvement.  Alternatively, in some individuals the kinetics o f tumor growth may initially 
outpace anti-tumor immune activity followed, with sufficient ti me, by clinically apparent anti-
tumor activity.  Therefore, select subjects may be allowed to c ontinue study therapy after 
investigator-assessed RECIST 1.1 progression and with agreement  by the study Medical 
Monitor if the subject is determined to be deriving clinical be nefit, tolerating study drug and 
meeting the following criteria: 
 
1. Absence of symptoms and signs indicating clinically signific ant PD indicating disease 
progression. 
2. No decline in ECOG performance status. 
3. Absence of rapid progression of disease or of progressive tu mor at critical anatomical 
sites (e.g., cord compression) requiring urgent alternative med ical intervention. 
 If subsequent imaging shows an objective response or stable dis ease relative to baseline, 
treatment with study agents will continue.  If subsequent imagi ng again shows PD, patients will 
be discontinued from study therapy. 
 
 Schedule of Assessments 
 
The schedule of assessments for the trial is shown in Appendix B.  If a required observation or 
procedure is missed, documentation is required in CRF and in th e subject’s source documents, 
to explain the reason for this protocol deviation. 
 
Based on findings during the study or during the follow up port ion of the trial, Gradalis may 
request for additional blood and / or tissue samples from subje cts during a routine blood draw or 
scheduled biopsy.  Collection of whole blood (40ml) and / or ti ssue samples (via biopsy or 
clinically indicated surgical removal) will be optional  and used to study the effects of the study 
agent (included, but not limited to testing of biomarkers, pred ictors or biological responses, 
toxicity, relationship between genotype and study agent respons es). 
 Should Gradalis request for additional blood or tissue, the cli nical site will present the option of 
the procurement to the participant and obtain written informed consent.

 Vigil Investigational Product 
 
Vigil is made up of irradiated autologous tumor cells which hav e been electroporated ex vivo 
with the Vigil plasmid designed to suppress expression of both the TGFβ1 and TGFβ2 proteins 
while simultaneously expressing rhGMCSF protein. 
 
 Safety Analysis 
 
Vigil plasmid employed in the generation of this product has be en tested for identity, sterility, 
purity and strength. 
 
Irradiated Gene Modified Tumor Cells 
 To ensure safety, all gene-modified tumor cells to be used in V igil administrations must be 
irradiated with a dose of 10,000 cGy prior to freezing.  This i s the same irradiation process as 
for the TAG vaccine, BB-IND 13650 and prior vaccines (Belagenpu matucel-L and GVAX® 
published trial results and BB-IND 13401 and BB-IND 12118) (Kum ar 2009; Maples PB 2009; 
Maples PB 2009).  The selection of this radiation dose is based  on the desire to utilize the 
lowest possible radiation dose for the transfected cells to opt imize the level and duration of 
bifunctional shRNA
furin transcription and GMCSF protein production and maximize the sa fety of 
vaccine cell injections at the same time.  In addition, investi gators have demonstrated that 
irradiating cultured tumor cells of different histologic origin s at 10,000 cGy completely arrests 
tumor colony formation. 
 
Preparation 
 Reference the Pharmacy Reference Manual for preparation and han dling information. 
 
Vigil concentrate: 1.0 x 10
6 or 1.0 x 107cells per injection in a volume of 1mL.

 ADVERSE EVENTS 
 
Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Definitions 
 
Adverse Event 
 An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinic al investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessa rily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable an d unintended sign (including a 
clinically significant abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, o r disease temporally associated 
with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal 
(investigational) product.

It is the user’s responsibility to ve rify adequate training before executing a doc ument.  Do not make unauthorized copies   
Serious Adverse Event 
 An AE (experience) or reaction occurring at any dose should be classified as a serious adverse 
event (SAE) if any of the following occur: 
 
 Initial or prolonged hospitalization  
 A life-threatening condition (i.e. an event in which the patie nt was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothet ically might have caused 
death if it was more severe)  
 Significant disability/incapacity (i.e. the AE resulted in a s ubstantial disruption of the 
subject’s ability to carry out normal life functions) 
 Congenital anomaly/birth defect 
 It does not meet any of the above serious criteria, but may je opardize the subject or may 
require surgical or medical inte rvention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
 Death 
 
Definition of Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is one of scientifi c and medical interest specific to 
understanding of the atezolizumab and may require close monitor ing and rapid communication 
by the investigator to the sponsor.  An AESI may be serious or non-serious.  The rapid reporting 
of AESIs allows ongoing surveillance of these events in order t o characterize and understand 
them in association with the use of this investigational produc t. 
 
AESIs for atezolizumab include but are not limited to events wi th a potential inflammatory or 
immune-related mechanism and which may require more frequent mo nitoring and/or 
interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants and/or hormo ne replacement therapy.  
These AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical studies wit h atezolizumab monotherapy and 
combination therapy.  An immune-related adverse event (irAE) is  defined as an adverse event 
that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an  immune-related mechanism of 
action and where there is no clear alternate etiology.  Serolog ic, immunologic, and histologic 
(biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to exclude altern ate etiologies and support an 
irAE diagnosis. Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, 
toxin, or other etiologic causes of the irAE. 
 
If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an adverse event (AE) being an irAE, the 
Investigator should promptly contact the Medical Monitor. 
 AESIs for this study include the following: 
 Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an e levated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaund ice, as defined by Hy's Law 
and based on the following observations: 
o Treatment-emergent ALT or AST  3  baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin  2  ULN (of which  35% is direct bilirubin)

It is the user’s responsibility to ve rify adequate training before executing a doc ument.  Do not make unauthorized copies  o Treatment-emergent ALT or AST  3  baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice 
 Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study tre atment, as defined below 
Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protei n transmitting 
transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non-pat hogenic, is 
considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectiou s agent may be 
suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that in dicate an infection 
in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This term applies  only when a 
contamination of study treatment is suspected. 
 Pneumonitis 
 Colitis 
 Endocrinopathies: diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, adrenal ins ufficiency, hyperthyroidism, 
and hypophysitis 
 Hepatitis, including AST or ALT  10  ULN  
 Systemic lupus erythematosus  
 Neurological disorders:  Guillain-Barré syndrome, myasthenic s yndrome or myasthenia 
gravis, and meningoencephalitis 
 Events suggestive of hypersensitivity, infusion-related reacti ons, cytokine release 
syndrome, influenza-like illness, systemic inflammatory respons e syndrome, and 
systemic immune activation 
 Nephritis 
 Ocular toxicities (e.g., uveitis, retinitis)  
 Myositis 
 Myopathies, including rhabdomyolysis  
 Grade  2 cardiac disorders (e.g., atrial fibrillation, myocarditis, p ericarditis) 
 
Criteria for Hy’s Law (FDA Guidance 2009) 
 The drug causes hepatocellular injury, generally shown by a hi gher incidence of 3-fold or 
greater elevations above the ULN of ALT or AST than the (non-he patotoxic) control drug  
 Among trial subjects showing such aminotransferase elevations,  often with 
aminotransferases much greater than 3 x ULN, one or more also s how elevation of 
serum total bilirubin to >2 x ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum 
alkaline phosphatase)  
 No other reason can be found to explain the combination of inc reased 
aminotransferases and total bilirubin, such as viral hepatitis A, B, or C; pre-existing or 
acute liver disease; or another drug capable of causing the obs erved injury. 
 
Unexpected Adverse Event 
 
An unexpected event is any AE that is not identified in nature,  severity or frequency in the 
Clinical Investigator’s brochure or the drug package insert.

Grading Adverse Events 
 Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded throughout the trial. Tox icities and AEs will be graded 
and reported using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Eve nts (CTCAE) Version 4.03 as 
linked in Appendix D. 
 Adverse events will be summarized using the MedDRA coding syste m or higher.  The NCI-
CTCAE will be used for AE grading.  All AEs, regardless of seve rity, will be followed by the 
Treating Physician until resolution is satisfactory. 
 
 Attribution of Causality 
 
The relationship of each event will be assessed by the Treating  Physician and recorded on the 
CRF. 
 
 Atezolizumab Infusion Reactions 
 
Severe infusion reactions have occurred in patients in clinical  trials of atezolizumab. Infusion 
related reactions occurred in 1.3% (25/1978) of patients across  clinical trials, 1.7% (9/523) of 
patients with urothelial carcinoma, and 1.6% (16/1027) of patie nts with NSCLC. Interrupt or slow 
the rate of infusion in patients with mild or moderate infusion  reactions. Permanently discontinue 
atezolizumab in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion reactions. 
 
 Risks Associated with Atezolizumab 
 
Refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for a detaile d description of anticipated safety 
risks for atezolizumab. 
 Systemic immune activation is a rare condition characterized by  an excessive immune 
response.  Given the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, syste mic immune activation is 
considered a potential risk when given in combination with othe r immunomodulating agents.  
Systemic immune activation should be included in the differenti al diagnosis for patients who, in 
the absence of an alternative etiology, develop a sepsis-like s yndrome after administration of 
atezolizumab, and the initial evaluation should include the fol lowing: 
 
 CBC with peripheral smear 
 PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer 
 Ferritin 
 Triglycerides 
 AST, ALT, and total bilirubin 
 L D H  
 Complete neurologic and abdominal examination (assess for hepa tosplenomegaly)

other cytopenias, hyperglycemia, vomiting, hypotension, infecti on at the immunization site. 
 
In addition, there may also be a risk of autoimmune disease dev elopment, although to date no 
evidence of this has been seen in any vaccination study.  There  may also be worsening of 
tumor related symptoms secondary to immune related attack on su bject’s tumor. 
 
 Recording of an Adverse Event 
 
Adverse events will be recorded for the duration of a subject’s  study treatment (following the first 
dose of Investigational Product, Vigil and/or atezolizumab), an d for up to 30 days following the 
last study treatment or until another therapy has been initiate d, whichever is earlier, regardless 
of causality. 
 SAEs and AESIs should be recorded for the duration of the study  treatment and for up to 30 
days following the last study treatment or the initiation of ne w therapy, whichever is earlier. 
 
All AEs, regardless of causal relationship are to be recorded i n the eCRF and source 
documentation.  Additional information about each event, such a s treatment required, eventual 
outcome, and whether or not therapy had to be interrupted or do sages reduced, will be noted in 
source documents and recorded on the eCRF. 
 
Pre-existing conditions will be recorded at baseline on the Med ical History Form. If a pre-
existing condition does not change, it does not have to be repo rted as an AE on subsequent 
cycles.

 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
 
All SAEs and AESIs will be reported within 24 hours of notifica tion by the site via email or fax to 
Gradalis, Inc.  This includes any death from any cause while a subject is receiving the study 
agent on this protocol, or  30 days following the last dose of the protocol study agent. 
 
The site will supply as much information as is available at the  time of the initial SAE or AESI 
reporting (study number, subject study number, onset date, rela tionship, subject demographics, 
event, dosing regimen of study agent).  All SAEs or AESIs must be followed until resolution.

Gradalis, Inc. and Genentech, Inc. will report adverse events t o the FDA in compliance with 21 
CFR 312.32. 
 
 Overdose 
 
An overdose is defined as a subject receiving a dose of atezoli zumab in excess of that specified 
in the Investigator’s Brochure, unless otherwise specified in t his protocol. 
 
Any overdose of a study subject with atezolizumab, with or with out associated AEs/SAEs, is 
required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the eve nt to the sponsor and Sponsor 
Partner Patient Safety or designee using the designated Safety e-mailbox. If the overdose 
results in an AE, the AE must also be recorded as an AE.  Overd ose does not automatically 
make an AE serious, but if the consequences of the overdose are  serious, for example death or 
hospitalization, the event is serious and must be recorded and reported as an SAE. There is 
currently no specific treatment in the event of an overdose of atezolizumab. 
 The investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdo se. 
 
 SUBJECT COMPLETION AND WITHDRAWAL 
 
 Indication for Taking Subjects Off Study 
 
The Investigator must notify the sponsor at any time following discontinuation of a subject on 
study for the occurrence of a serious or unexpected AE associat ed with the use of the study 
medication.

 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
 Safety Analysis 
 
The safety evaluation will include AEs, AESIs, SAEs, and change s from baseline in laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, electroc ardiograms, and physical exam inations. The number and 
percentage of subjects reporting treatment emergent AEs will be  summarized overall and by the 
highest Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade, system organ class, 
and preferred term, with a breakdown by dose and tumor type. Si milarly, the number and 
percentage of subjects reporting treatment-emergent AEs conside red related to investigational 
product will be summarized. At each level of subject summarizat ion, a subject will be counted 
once using the highest grade and level of causality if one or m ore occurrences of the same 
system organ class/preferred term is reported. Adverse events w ill be graded according to the 
National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE v4.03 and coded using the  Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities. Laboratory abnormalities will be graded according to the NCI CTCAE 
v4.03, if applicable. 
 
 Efficacy Analysis 
 
For each cohort, the ORR will be estimated, along with its two- sided exact binomial 95% 
confidence interval. The definitions of the response-related en dpoints and corresponding time-
to-event endpoints will be based on the programmatically-derive d response from the 
investigator’s recorded measurements and assessments for target , non-target, and new lesions 
according to RECIST 1.1. The distributions of PFS and OS will b e estimated within each cohort 
using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
 
 Sample Size Justification 
 
The sample size for this study is not based on statistical cons iderations.  The results of this trial 
will be used to help design future studies.

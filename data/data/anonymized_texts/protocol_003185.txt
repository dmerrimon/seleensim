A Multi -center Phase II Trial Randomizing  Novel Approaches for Graft -versus -Host Disease 
Prevention Compared to Contemporary Controls  
 
Co-Principal Investigators : Javier Bolaños  -Meade, MD; John Koreth, MBBS, DPhil;  
Ran Reshef, MD  
 
Study Design:  The study is designed as a Phase II , multicenter trial that 
randomizes  patients to one of  three GVHD prophylaxis 
approaches comparing each to a contemporary control . 
 
Primary Objective:  The primary objective of the randomized trial is to compare one 
year GVHD/relapse or progression -free survival (GRFS) after 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) between each 
of three novel GVHD prophylaxi s approaches and a 
contemporary control from the Center for International Blood 
and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) database . An 
event for this time to event outcome is defined as grade III -IV 
acute GVHD, chronic GVHD requiring systemic 
immunosuppressi ve treatment, disease relapse or progression, or 
death by any cause. . 
 
Secondary Objectives : Secondary o bjectives are to  describe for each  treatment arm:  
rates of grade II -IV and III -IV acute GVHD, vis ceral acute 
GVHD, chronic GVHD,  immun osuppression -free survival at 
one year, hematologic recovery ( neutrophil and platelet) , donor 
cell engraftment,  disease relapse  or progression , transplant -
related mortality, rates of Grade  3 toxicity according to the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (C TCAE) 
Version 4 .0; incidence of infections;  immune reconstitution  and 
overall survival.  
 
Eligibility Criteria:  Eligible patients  are between 18 and 75 years undergoing H SCT 
for treatment of acute  leukemia , chronic myelogenous leukemia 
or myelodysplasia wi th no circulating blasts and with less than 
5% blasts in the bone marrow ; chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia /small lymphocytic lymphoma, follicular lymph oma; 
marginal zone lymphoma ; Hodgkin’s Lymphoma, diffuse  large  
B cell lymphoma or, mantle cell lymphoma  sensitive to 
chemotherapy who are eligible for an allogeneic transplant . 
Patients must have a related or unrelated peripheral blood 
stem cell donor. Sibling donor must be a 6/6 match for 
HLA -A and -B at intermediate (or higher) resolution, and -
DRB1 at hig h resolution using DNA -based typing , and must 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol -1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
iii be willing to donate peripheral blood stem cells and meet 
institutional criteria for donation. Unrelated donor must be 
a 7/8 or 8/8 match at HLA -A, -B, -C and –DRB1 at high 
resolution using DNA -based typing . Unrelated donor must 
be willing to donate peripheral blood stem cells and be 
medically eligible to donate stem cells according to NMDP 
criteria.  Patients are eligible only if receiving a reduced 
intensity conditioning (RIC) regimen.   
 
Treatment Description : Patients will be randomized to receive one of the three specified 
regimens: Tac rolimus (Tac) /Methotrexate (Mtx)  with 
bortezomib 1.3  mg/m2 IV daily Days +1, +4 and +7  post HSCT; 
Tac/Mtx with maraviroc 300 mg PO twice a day from Day -3 to 
30 post H SCT; or cyclophosphamide  (Cy) 50 mg/kg Day +3 
and +4 , followed by Tac and mycophenolate  mofetil (MMF).   
Tac will be maintained at therapeutic doses  for a minimum of 
90 days  in all arms .  Methotrexate will be dosed at  15 mg/m2 
Day +1, and 10 mg/m2 Days +3, 6 and 11  in the maraviroc and 
bortezomib arms . MMF will be dosed at 15  mg/kg every 8 
hours from Day +5 to Day +35 in the Tac/MMF/Cy treatment 
arm.     
 
Accrual Objective:  The clinical trial will enroll  270 patients  or 90 per arm .  Patients 
will be compared to a minimum of 270 controls from the 
CIBMTR who received Tac/Mtx alone.  
 
Accrual Period:  The estimated accrual period is 30 months . 
 
Study Duration:  Patients will be followed for 1 year  following HSCT . 
 
Interim Analysis:  There will be no interim analyses for efficacy. An interim 
analysis for futility will be conducted based on the 6 month 
GRFS when 30 patients in each arm have 6 months of follow -up 
available.  If fewer than 14 are alive and GVHD/relapse free 
among the first 30 patients on an arm, closure o f the study arm 
for futility will be considered.   
 
Stopping Guidelines:  Monitoring of the key safety endpoint of death will be 
conducted   monthly. The rate of mortality will be monitored up 
to 100 days post -randomization separately in each of the three 
treatment arms.  At least three events must be observed in order 
to trigger review for consultation with the DSMB.

1. BACKGROUND AND RATIO NALE  
 
1.1. Introduction  
 
Acute Graft -versus -Host -Disease (GVHD) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality after 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).  Clinically significant grade II -IV 
acute GVHD occurs in 34 -40% of patients undergoing HLA -matched related donor HSCT, 47 -
52% of HLA -matched unrelated donor HSCT, and is further increased in those lacking HLA -
matched donors.1, 2, 3, 4 
 
GVHD is thought to be mediated by donor -derived T cells that are reactive against recipient 
antigens expressed in the context of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC or HLA). 
These a ntigens, termed minor histocompatibility antigens (mHA), are small peptides with 
immunogenic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) capable of eliciting potent T cell immune 
responses upon presentation by antigen presenting cells (APCs).  A number of these  mHAs have 
been identified.5  In fact, mismatches of known mHA among HLA identical donor -recipient pairs 
have been associated with the development of GVHD after stem cell transplantation.6  
 
Approximately 40% of patients with acute GVHD will have durable r esponses to corticosteroid 
therapy; there has been little change in this response rate over the past 20 years, despite addition 
or substitution of other immunosuppressive drugs to GVHD treatment regimens.7  The prognosis 
of the 60% of patients without long -lasting response is poor.8  A strategy that minimizes the 
incidence of GVHD, without other adverse effects, would be an effective approach to improve 
survival after allogeneic transplantation.  
 
GVHD incidence can be decreased with various pharmacologic ag ents.  Early transplants were 
done using post -transplant methotrexate to prevent GVHD; in the 1980s cyclosporine was shown 
to be superior to methotrexate and in 1986 the combined use of cyclosporine and methotrexate 
was shown to be superior to single agent  prophylaxis.9  More recently, other calcineurin -
inhibitors, such as tacrolimus have been developed as GVHD prophylactic agents due to 
favorable toxicity profiles in comparison with cyclosporine.10, 11 
 
Phase III trials comparing tacrolimus/methotrexate versus cyclosporine/methotrexate for related 
and unrelated donors have been performed. In the unrelated donor setting, the incidence of grade 
II-IV acute GVHD was 56% among the 46 patients randomized to tacrolimus arm versus 74% 
among the 63 patients rando mized to cyclosporine arm.12  The combination of 
tacrolimus/methotrexate remains a standard for GVHD prophylaxis, despite its limited efficacy.  
 
However, improved GVHD prophylaxis remains a si gnificant clinical need in HSCT . The current  
clinical trial will test three novel GVHD prophylaxis approaches: tacrolimus/methotrexate and 
bortezomib (Tac/MTX/Bort), tacrolimus/methotrexate and maraviroc (Tac/MTX/M VC) and 
tacrolimus/ mycophenolate  mofetil and cyclophosphamide (Tac/MMF/Cy).  This randomized 
Phase  II clini cal trial will compare each intervention arm with a Tac/MTX control.

1.2. Tacrolimus, Methotrexate and Bortezomib (Tac/MTX/Bort)  
 
1.2.1.  Bortezomib  
 
Bortezomib for Injection is a small -molecule proteasome inhibitor developed by Millennium 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (Mi llennium) as a novel agent to treat human malignancies.  Bortezomib 
is currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) for the 
treatment of patients with multiple myeloma (MM).  It is also indicated for the treatment of 
patien ts with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received at least 1 prior therapy.   
 
1.2.2.  Bortezomib Mechanism of Action  
 
By inhibiting a single molecular target, the proteasome, bortezomib affects multiple signaling 
pathways.  The antineoplastic effect of bortezo mib likely involves several distinct mechanisms, 
including inhibition of cell growth and survival pathways, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition 
of expression of genes that control cellular adhesion, migration, and angiogenesis.  Thus, the 
mechanisms by which bortezomib elicits its antitumor activity may vary among tumor types, and 
the extent to which each affected pathway is critical to the inhibition of tumor growth could also 
differ.  Bortezomib has a novel pattern of cytotoxicity in National Cancer In stitute (NCI) in  vitro 
and in vivo assays.13  In addition, bortezomib has cytotoxic activity in a variety of xenograft 
tumor models, both as a single agent and in combination with chemotherapy and 
radiation.14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26  Notably, bortezomib induces apoptosis in cells that over 
express bcl -2, a genetic trait that confers unregulated growth and resistance to conventional 
chemotherapeutics.27 
 
The mechanisms of action leading up to apoptosis have been more clearly defined an d include 
initiation of the unfolded protein response and direct/indirect effects on various molecular targets 
including cell cycle control proteins p27 and p21, cyclins, signal transduction molecules, 
transcription factors c -jun and HIF1 -, tumor suppress or protein p53, angiogenesis factors, and 
many others.  Bortezomib is thought to be efficacious in multiple myeloma via its inhibition of 
nuclear factor B (NF -B) activation, its attenuation of interleukin -6 (IL -6)-mediated cell 
growth, a direct apoptotic  effect, and possibly anti -angiogenic and other effects.28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35 
 
Bortezomib is thought to be efficacious in multiple myeloma via its inhibition of nuclear factor 
B (NF -B) activation, its attenuation of interleukin -6 (IL -6)-mediated cell growth, a  direct 
apoptotic effect, and possibly anti -angiogenic and other effects.36  Bortezomib also has 
immunomodulatory effects relevant to allogeneic HSCT.  The proteasome, acting via NF -kB, 
plays an important role in cytokine signaling and the generation of cel l mediated immune 
responses via T cell activation, proliferation and apoptosis.37, 38, 39  Bortezomib also attenuates 
TLR4 mediated antigen -presenting cell activation, with reduced cytokine production and 
immunostimulatory activity.40  In the allogeneic settin g, bortezomib preferentially and 
specifically depletes alloreactive T lymphocytes.41  It however spares human regulatory T cells 
(Treg) that act to suppress inappropriate immune responses underlying GVHD.42  Given the 
immunomodulatory effects of bortezomib o n APCs, alloreactive T lymphocytes and Tregs, as

Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
1-3 well as its anti -tumor effects and its lack of hematopoietic stem cell toxicity, it is an attractive 
candidate for control of GVHD after allogeneic transplantation.  
 
1.2.3.  Bortezomib and Graft -versus -Host -Disease:  Preclinical Data  
 
In murine models of severe acute GVHD involving fully -HLA mismatched myeloablative 
HSCT, bortezomib administered early after stem cell infusion protected against GVHD without 
impairing engraftment.43, 44  In a model intended to induce less severe GVHD, mice receiving 
bortezomib had 100% survival with no animal developing GVHD, while control animals all 
succumbed to GVHD prior to Day 50 post-transplant ation.43  
 
Additionally, in other in -vivo murine models  combination bortezomib/sirolimus synergistically 
reduced GVHD risk without hampering graft -versus -leukemia effect.   
 
1.2.4.  Bortezomib Clinical Pharmacokin etics and Pharmacodynamics  
 
The clinical pharmacology characterization of bortezomib  has been determined from Phase 1 
studies in subjects with solid tumors and hematological malig nancies, and confirmed in Phase 2 
studies in subjects with multiple myeloma.  
 
Bortezomib demonstrates multi -compartmental pharmacokinetics. Following intravenous 
administration of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2 dose, the mean first -dose maximum observed plasma 
concentrations of bortezomib were 57 and 112  ng/mL, respectively in 11 patients  with multiple 
myeloma and creatinine clearance values >50 mL/min participating in a pharmacokinetics study.  
In subsequent doses, mean maximum observed plasma concentrations ranged from 67 to 
106 ng/mL for the 1.0 mg/m2 dose and 89 to 120 ng/mL for the 1. 3 mg/m2 dose.  The mean 
elimination half -life of bortezomib upon multiple dosing ranged from 40 to 193  hours.  
Bortezomib is eliminated more rapidly following the first dose.  Mean Total Body Clearances 
were 102 and 112 L/h following the first dose for dos es of 1.0 mg/m2 and 1.3 mg/m2, 
respectively, and ranged from 15 to 32 L/h following subsequent doses for doses of 1.0 and 
1.3 mg/m2, respectively.  Clinical experience has shown that the change in clearance does not 
result in overt toxicity from accumulati on in this multi -dose regimen in humans.  
 
In subjects with advanced malignancies, the maximum pharmacodynamic effect (inhibition of 
20S activity) occurred within 1 -hour post dose.  At the therapeutic dose of 1.3 mg/m2 in subjects 
with multiple myeloma, the mean proteasome inhibition at 1 -hour post dose was approximately 
61%.  
 
The time course of proteasome inhibition in subjects is characterized by maximum inhibition 
observed within the first hour after administration, followed by partial recovery of proteasome 
activity over the next 6 to 24 hours to within 50% of the pretreatment activity.  On the Day 1, 4, 
8, and 11 schedule variable (10% –30%) levels of proteasome inhibition have been observed at 
next scheduled dosing.   In theory, this advantage allows cells to recover proteasome activity for 
normal cellular housekeeping functions between doses.

Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
1-4 The relationship between bortezomib plasma concentrations and proteasome inhibition can be 
described by a maximum effect (E max) model.  The E max curve is initially very steep, with small 
changes in plasma bortezomib concentration over the range of 0.5 to 2.0 ng/mL relating to large 
increases in the percent inhibition (0 –60%).  After that, a plateau occurs where marginal 
increase s of proteasome inhibition are observed in spite of large changes in plasma bortezomib 
concentrations.45  
 
1.2.5.  Clinical Experience with Bortezomib  
 
To date, more than 436,000 patients have been treated with bortezomib, including patients 
treated through Millenn ium-sponsored clinical trials, Investigator -Initiated Studies, the US NCI 
Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP), and with  commercially available drug.  
Bortezomib has been commercially available since 13 May 2003.  
 
1.2.6.  Clinical Experience  with Bortezomib fo r GVHD Prophylaxis  
 
In a Phase I trial in patients with refractory hematologic malignancies, the MTD for a twice 
weekly for 4 weeks of a 42 day cycle was 1.04 mg/m2/dose, with DLTs of thrombocytopenia, 
hyponatremia, hypokalemia, fatigue, and malaise.46  The toxicity was greatest during the third 
and fourth weeks of therapy.   In the 3 -week schedule of bortezomib  monotherapy (4 doses, given 
on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a 21 -day treatment cycle), the DLT occurred at 1.56 mg/m2/dose (3 
subjects with Grade 3 diarrh ea and 1 with peripheral sensory neuropathy).  Therefore, the MTD 
at this schedule was 1.3 mg/m2/dose.  In a 35 -day treatment cycle with 4 weekly doses of 
bortezomib  monotherapy in patients with advanced solid tumors, the MTD was 1.6 mg/m2/dose 
and DLT inc luded hypotension, tachycardia, diarrhea, and syncope.45  
 
In the allogeneic HSCT context, a Phase I/II clinical trial (DFCI protocol 06 -065) of a  regimen 
of bortezomib plus standard tacrolimus/methotrexate for GVHD prophylaxis after 
fludarabine/busulfan -based RIC HSCT with 1 -2 locus HLA -mismatched donors (HLA -A, -B, -C; 
-DQB1, -DRB1).  Bortezomib MTD was 1.3 mg/m2 administered on Days +1, +4 and +7  after 
stem cell infusion.  Phase I results indicated minimal toxicity (rapid engraftment, zero non -
relapse mortality  in the first year ) and excellent acute GVHD control with the bortezomib -based 
regimen.47  Phase  I/II results demonstrated that the grade II -IV acute GVHD rate at Day 180 was 
22% and no patients developed grade IV acute GVHD. Additionally, 2 -year probabilities of non-
relapse mortality  and relapse  were 11% and 38% respectively in a population receiving HLA -
mismatched unrelated donor HSCT.48  Consequently, the combination of b ortezomib, tacrolimus 
and methotrexate appears suitable for prospective multicenter evaluation.

1-5 1.3. Tacroli mus, Methotrexate and Maraviroc (Tac/MTX/ MVC ) 
 
1.3.1.  CCR5 and CCR5 inhibitors  
 
CCR5 is a chemokine receptor. Its natural liga nds are CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5, also known as 
macrophage inflammatory protein -1-alpha (MIP -1), MIP -1 and regulated and normal T cell 
expressed and secreted  (RANTES). CCR5 is expressed on subsets of T -cells, dendritic cells and 
macrophages.  It is a G -protein coupled receptor with 7 transmembrane domains .49  CCR5 is a 
major co -receptor for HIV entry into host cells ,50, 51 and a common polymorphism ( 32-CCR5) 
results in deletion and frame -shift and a non -functional receptor, leading to protection against 
HIV infection.  
 
1.3.2.  Maraviroc  
 
Maraviroc (SELZENTRY ™ – Pfizer, formerly UK -427,857) is the first FDA -approved drug in 
its class of CCR5 -antagonists.  It is a highly specific small molecule antagonist of CCR5, 
developed for the treatment of HIV -1 infec tion.  Two pivotal Phase  III trials (MOTIVATE -1 and 
MOTIVATE -2) have shown that in HIV patients maraviroc was able to produce a significant 
decrease in viral load and an increase in CD4 count .52, 53, 54  
 
1.3.3.  Maraviroc  Mechanism of Action  and Safety Studies  
 
Maraviroc is a true antagonist of the CCR5 receptor.  It creates an allosteric conformational 
change in the extracellular domain of the receptor and prevents binding of all 3 ligands (CCL3 -
5).  It is not a partial agonist and does not trigger any calcium i nflux or internalization of the 
receptor.  Pharmacokinetic studies showed  that drug absorption is rapid, bioavailability  is 23 -
33% due to a 1st pass effect in the liver with maximum  concentrations achieved 1 –4 h after 
dosing.  Absorption is decreased with food but no efficacy data determined any difference in 
outcome so the drug is given without food restrictions.55  
 
Maraviroc is  a substrate of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A 4.  Its level is affected by 
inducers and suppressors of the cytochrome P450  such as rifampin, antiretroviral medications 
and certain azoles, mainly ketoconazole and itraconazole.  The drug itself is not a significant 
inhibitor or inducer of any known metabolic pathway, and studies were conducted to guide the 
dosing in patients wh o are taking inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A455.  Therefore, the 
recommended dose is determined by concomitant medications.  Patients on strong inhibitors of 
CYP3A4 should take 150  mg bid, patients on strong inducers of CYP3A4 should take 600 mg 
bid and all other patients should take 300  mg bid.  
 
Phase I trials showed postural hypotension to be a dose -limiting side effect when a 600  mg dose 
was given to healthy volunteers.  No effects on blood counts, immunoglobulin levels or 
lymphocyte sub set numbers were observed in Phase I/II studies.  
 
The safety of maraviroc  has not been specifically studied in patients with significant underlying 
liver disorders.   Several c ases of hepatotoxicity and hepatic failure with allergic features have 
been repor ted in association with maraviroc, including one case in a study of healthy volunteers .  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol -1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
1-6 Phase III studies in HIV patients showed mild side effects.  Liver enzyme and bilirubin elevation 
occurred in 9.2% as opposed to 6.2% in the placebo groups.  These fin dings, together with 
reports of hepatotoxicity with other CCR5 antagonists, led the FDA to mandate a black box 
warning for hepatotoxicity.  Discontinuation of maraviroc  should be considered in any patient 
with signs or symptoms of acute hepatitis, in parti cular if drug -related hypersensitivity is 
suspected or with increased liver transaminases combined with rash or other systemic symptoms 
of potential hypersensitivity (e.g. pruritic rash, eosinophil ia or elevated IgE).   There are limited 
data in patients wi th hepatitis B/C infection, although such patients were not excluded from 
clinical trials in HIV patients. S pecial caution should be exercised when treating these patients 
with maraviroc .  
 
A study compared the pharmacokinetics of a single 300 mg dose of maraviroc  in subjects with 
severe renal impairment (CLcr < 30 ml/min, n=6) and end -stage renal disease (ESRD) to healthy 
volunteers (n=6).  Results show that dialysis had a minimal effect on exposure in subjects with 
ESRD. Exposures observed in subjects wi th severe renal impairment and ESRD were within the 
range observed in single maraviroc  300 mg dose studies in healthy volunteers with normal renal 
function.  Therefore, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with renal impairment receiving 
maraviroc  without a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor.   Dose adjustment is necessary in patients with 
renal impairment receiving maraviroc  with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
 
Maraviroc does not affect any major metabolic pathway. In particular, it does not affect the 
levels of drugs that are metabolized by the CYP450 -3A4 system. In the phase I/II study, no 
significant interaction was noted with tacrolimus and tacrolimus dosing was standard.  
 
The drug is available in oral form only.  The commercially -available formulation is in p ill form 
and a maraviroc solution  is available for clinical research , although the solution will not be 
available for the BMT CTN 1203 study . 
 
1.3.4.  CCR5 Inhibition and GVHD  
 
Blocking CCR5 in a GVHD murine model reduced the number of CD8+ lymphocytes that 
infilt rated the liver and prevented clinical GVHD.56  The entry of T -cells into Peyer’s patches 
was also dependent on CCR5.57  GVHD models  also support the role of CCR5 ligands in the 
recruitment of cytotoxic T -cells into tissues.58 
 
Retrospective epidemiologic data support an association between CCR5 and GVHD.  A 
European study analyzed 186 recipients and 163 donors of SCT, and revealed that recipient Δ32 
was a protective factor for acute GVHD of any grade.  Δ32 in the donor  did not predict outcome 
but the combi nation of Δ32 in both donor and recipient was protective (0/11 patients had 
GVHD).59  Another study used the NMDP sample repository and revealed that the H1/H1 
haplotype, which leads to high CCR5 expression, was  associated with severe GVHD.60

1-7 1.3.5.  Phase I/II Study of Maraviroc in GVHD Prophylaxis  
 
At the University of Pennsylvania, a Phase I/II clinical trial was conducted to study the role of 
maraviroc when added to conventional GVHD  prophylaxis following RIC SCT.61  The trial 
enrolled 38 subjects (Table 1 .3a), who received a standard RIC regimen of fludarabine and 
busulfan followed by the infusion of a peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) graft from either a 
matched related or unrelated donor.  Single -antigen mismatched donors were acceptable. In 
addition to stand ard tacrolimus and methotrexate (MTX) prophylaxis, all patients received 
maraviroc from Day -2 to Day+30.

1-8 Maraviroc dose level verification  
 
Studies in normal volunteers and HIV 
patients have established safe and effective  
doses of maraviroc and defined the 
expected drug interactions when the drug 
is administered together with inducers and 
inhibitors of CYP450 3A4.  In order to 
verify the dose level in patients undergoing 
allogeneic SCT, detailed pharmacokinetics 
and safety  data were studied from 13 
subjects at 2 dose levels (summarized in 
Figure 1 .3a); the 300 mg bid (n=6) and  
150 mg bid (n=7) doses resulted in mean 
Cavg (AUC/dosing interval) of 536 and 
118 ng/ml, respectively.  The results for 
the 300  mg bid dose were high compared 
to data from HIV trials, likely due to drug 
interactions; however, 3/7 patients at 150  mg bid did not reach the targeted minimum Cavg  
(100 ng/ml), while the higher dose level resulted in adequate Cavg in 6/6 patients.  Significant 
drug-related toxicity was not seen in either dose levels.   It was concluded that 300  mg bid should 
be the Phase II dose.   
 
Maraviroc safety  
 
Maraviroc  was well tolerated and s ignificant drug -related adverse events  were not identified . 
Prompt engraftment was seen in  all subjects with no primary graft failures.  Four  subjects 
encountered delayed  graft failure , three of them due to progressive primary myelofibrosis.  The 
frequency of microbiologically confirmed infections and CMV reactivations was no t different 
than ex pected.  Patterns of donor -recipient chimerism were  typical for RIC HSCT. 
 
Adverse events were similar to the expected toxicity of RIC HSCT.  One patient died within the 
first 30 days from septic shock and bacteremia.  The drug was briefly held in 7 patien ts due to 
grade 3 LFT abnormalities (n=2) or grade 3 –4 mucositis (n=5). LFT abnormalities did not recur 
when the drug was restarted in both patients.  The adverse event profile was similar to the 
expected toxicity observed in patients undergoing RIC HSCT.  
 
Maraviroc efficacy  
 
As of January 2012 t he median follow up was 19.6 months  (range 13.8 – 34.8) .  A final analysis 
for the primary end -point demonstrated that the cumulative incidence rates of acute GVHD  grade 
II-IV and III -IV at Day 100 were 14.7%  and 2.9% respectively .  By Day 100 all cases of acute 
GVHD  involved only the skin without liver or inte stinal involvement.  These  results were 
compared with a well -matched cohort of patients (n=48), who underwent RIC HSCT with 
Tac/MTX prophylaxis but with out maraviroc between 2009 -2011  at Penn (Reshef, unpublished 
data) .  This cohort included patients who underwent RIC HSCT prior to or after the completion

1-9 of the maraviroc  trial, or during its interim analyses.  These c omparison s are summarized in 
Table 1.3b and Figure 1.3b and demonstrate a significant decrease in GVHD of the gut (8.8% vs. 
27.1%; P=0.02) and liver (2.9% vs. 14.6%; P=0.05 ), leading to a lower cumulative incidence of 
grade III-IV GVHD  (5.9% vs. 20.8%; P=0.03 ).  The rates of skin GVHD  were un affected by 
maraviroc  and the cumulative incidence of grade II -IV GVHD  was lower but did not reac h 
statistical significance (23.6% vs. 35.4; P=0.24 ).  Significant differences in non -relapse 
mortality, relapse and survival rates were not observed, but non -relapse mortality was 
numerically lower (11.7% vs. 19.1%; P=0.35) .  In summary, this Phase I/II clinical trial showed 
low rates of GVHD , a significant decrease in visceral GVHD , leading to low rates of severe 
GVHD  without adverse ly affecting  the relapse rate.  These results are sufficiently encouraging to 
proceed to multicenter testing.

High dose cyclophosphamide is a potent immunosup pressor  that has been successfully used to 
prevent GVHD  in unrelated, HLA -matched sibling  and haploidentical bone marrow/ PBSC  
transplants in single cent er as well as in multi -center studies.62, 63, 64, 65, 66  Cyclophosphamide 
administered early post HSCT  preferential ly kills allo-reactive T cells while spar ing resting, non 
allo-reactive T cells leading to suppression of GVHD  as well as graft rejection.67 
 
1.4.2.  Post-transplant  Cyclophosphamide in Haploidentical Donor Transplants  
 
Based on promising pre -clinical results at Jo hns Hopkins, a Phase I/II clinical trial of 
haploidentical BMT to treat high -risk hematologic malign ancies was initiated in 1999.  
Following a non -myelo ablative regimen of fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and low -dose TBI , 
GVHD  prophylaxis consisted of cyclo phosphamide (Cy) given on Days +3 and +4 post -
transplant, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF).64 Primary graft failure occurred in 
13% of patients, and was fatal due to infection in one patient in wh om autologous hematopoiesis 
failed to occur.  In general, complete T -cell engraftment was  observed by Day +28 or the grafts 
were rejected.  Cumulative incidences of grades II -IV and grades III -IV acute GVHD by Day 
200 w ere 34% and 6%, respectively.  There was lower incidence of extensive chronic GVHD 
among recipients of two versus one dose of post-transplantation Cy (5% versus 25%; p=.05).  
There was no difference in the incidence of severe acute GVHD  with one or two doses of post -
transplant Cy.  The cumulative incidences of non -relapse mortality and relapse at 1 year were  
Figure 1.3b Cumulative incidence rates of acute GVHD (panel A) and organ -specific GVHD 
(panel B) in patients who received maraviroc in addition to standard Tac/MTX (n=35) in a Phase  
I/II trial in comparison with patie nts treated with Tac/MTX alone (n=48) during the same time 
period.

transplants in the BMT  CTN 0603 clinical trial.  15% and 51%, respecti vely. Actuarial overall and event -free survivals (EFS) at two years after 
transplantation were 36% and 26%, respectively.  Patients with lymphoid malignancies appeared 
to have an improved EFS compared to those with myeloid malignancies (p=.02).  
 
The B lood and  Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) sponsored a multi -
center Phase II trial of haploidentical BMT ( BMT CTN 0603) for high -risk hematologic 
malignancies modeled after the Hopkins approach.  This was published along with a similar 
study using cord grafts without post transplant  Cy (BMT CTN 0604).62  The 1 -year probabilities 
of overall and progression -free survival were 54% and 46% after cord transplantation and 62% 
and 48% after 
haploidentical bone 
marrow  
transplantation .  The 
Day +56 cumulative 
incidence of 
neutrophil recovery 
was 94% after dUCB 
and 96% after 
haploidentical 
marrow.  The 100 -
day cumulative incidence of grade II -IV acute GVHD was 40% with cord blood and 32% with 
haploidentical bone marrow.   The 1 -year cumulative incidences of non -relapse mortality and 
relapse after cord transplantation were 24% and 31% , respectively ; corresponding rates after 
haploidentical bone marrow transplantation were 7% and 45%.  
 
1.4.3.  Post-transplant  Cy as GVHD Prophylaxis  
 
Post-transplant Cy as GVHD  prophylaxis wa s developed initially for haploidentical bone 
marrow transplant ation  after nonablative conditioning but , recently , several small studies have 
extended the approach to myeloablative conditioning and to PBSC transplantation .  To date, 
haploidentical nonablat ive transplantation with post -transplant Cy has used bone marrow as the 
graft source.  Use of PBSC instead of marrow may allow wider applicability of this approach but 
there is concern about higher risks of acute and chronic GVHD  due to the 5 -10-fold highe r 
number of T -cells in the allograft. Recently, groups in Houston and Seattle/London reported 
small studies in which PBSC were substituted for bone marrow  with post transplant Cy in the 
haploidentical donor setting .65, 68  In both studies, the incidences of severe acute GVHD , chronic 
GVHD  and non-relapse mortality  at 1 year with PBSC  were comparable to the rates  seen with 
bone marrow.   
 
Also, experience in HLA -matched sibling s is being explored . Kasamon et al published on 10 
patients receiving nonablative transplants for lymphoma69 and Bolaños -Meade on 3 patients with 
sickle cell disease66. Kasamon’s patients also received rituximab and Bolaños -Meade’s received 
antithymoc yte globulin .  R ates of GVHD  and transplant related mortality were  very low.  
Therefore,  the inclusion of post-transplant  high dose Cy with MMF and tacrolimus as GVHD  
prophylaxis after a non -ablative conditioning regimen seems to be justified.

1-12 1.5.  Benchmark Analysis and Composite Endpoint  
 
In order to better evaluate the efficacy of novel approaches for GVHD prophylaxis, a benchmark 
analysis was performed using data from the  Center for International Blood and Marrow 
Transplant Research  (CIBMTR ) for patients who received a RIC HSCT.  
 
The CIBMTR maintains an outcomes registry that prospectiv ely collects data from all centers 
performing allogeneic HSCTs and almost all centers performing autologous HSCTs in the 
United States and about 100 non -US centers. Centers must report all consecutive patients and 
provide longitudinal follow -up on those pa tients according to set timelines that include a 
pretransplant report, a 100 day  report , a 6 month  report and an annual report through 6 years post  
transplant followed by a biannual report in perpetuity. Dat a are reported on two tracks: a  
“Transplant Essen tial Data” track and a “Comprehensive Report Form” track.  Centers provide a 
pretransplant Transplant Essential Data form for all patients .  Data from this form are used to 
select patients for the Comprehensive Report Form track using a weighted random sel ection that 
over selects  patients with rare diseases or procedures or for the purposes of specific studies.  For 
example, most patients on BMT CTN trials are selected for the Comprehensive Report Form 
track so that data collected by the CIBMTR can suppleme nt clinical trial data collected through 
AdvantageEDC and can allow for long -term follow -up of trial patients for specific late effects of 
treatment.  Longitudinal data are collected for patients on both the Transplant Essential Data and 
Comprehensive Repor t Form Track; the data differ in quantity and granularity.  Data quality is 
ensured by computerized error checks and on -site audits.  
 
The objective of the benchmark analysis was to select promising approaches to be further studied 
and to explore novel endp oints that could not only assess GVHD, but also the complex 
relationships between relapse and GVHD  as well as prolonged use of immune suppression. The 
control population selected from the CIBMTR database was comprised of patients who received 
HSCT  in a US center from 2006 to 2009 and who received tacrolimus and methotrexate as their 
sole GVHD prophylaxis. Data from single institution  studies of the three agents to be tested in 
this protocol were also studied. Populations differed according to disease, donor , conditioning 
intensity, disease risk and patient age. Each institutional cohort was compared with the CIBMTR 
controls , adjusting for differences in baseline populations  using multivariate regression 
techniques .  Table 1. 5a summarizes the results of both univariate  and multivariate  analyses.

to the Tac +MTX Control reference group (indicated by a HR of 1.00).  
 
 
We also were interested in evaluating a composite endpoint that would better reflect reductions 
in either or both acute and chronic GVHD as well as the sometimes opposite effects of reducing 
GVHD on transplant -related mortality and relapse . First the prognostic impact of acute GVHD 
was investigated as a time dependent covariate. Grades 3 and 4 but not grade 2 acute GVHD 
were significantly associated with survival (Table 1.5 b)

RR=relative risk; CI=confidence interval  
 
Using this information and considering the potential  impact of these regimens on ch ronic GVHD 
(Table 1. 5a), we computed the composite endpoint of Grade 3/4 acute GVHD -free, chronic 
GVHD -free, relapse -free survival ( GVHD/relapse -free survival or GRFS).  The GRFS endpoint 
was calculated for the patients in the CIBMTR Tac+MTX control group (see above) who 
received RIC HSCT  from 2006 to 2009 and who fulfill ed the eligibility for the planned BMT 
CTN 1203 trial  (N=628) .  The one year probability of GRF S was 23% (95% CI , 20-26%).  This 
rate was used as the baseline rate for power and sample size calc ulation s for this clinical trial. 
We also investigated whether GRFS rates differed by disease , for the diseases allowed in the 
trial.  Table 1. 5c demonstrate s one year GRFS rates by disease and the hazard ratio for the 
inverse of G RFS in each disease group compared to patients with AML , adjusting for other 
patient characteristics in multivariate analysis.

Patients transplanted for myelodysplastic syndrome and those transplanted for chronic 
lymphocytic leukemia had higher risks of treatment failure than patients transplanted for other 
diseases; however the reasons for treatment failure differed in these two groups .  Rates of grade 
III-IV acute GVHD were higher in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia than in patients 
with other diseases ; rates of disease relapse were higher in patients with myelodysplastic 
syndrome than in patients with other diseases.  F or analysis of this trial, disease will be 
categorized as low risk (acute leukemia, chronic myeloid leukemia, non -Hodgkin lymphoma)  or 
high risk (chronic lymphocytic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome) and randomization will 
be stratified based on risk status.

1-15 1.6. Rationale  
 
This multicenter Phase  II clinical trial will evaluate three novel GVHD prophylaxis approaches  
for their efficacy in  improv ing the proportion of patients who do not develop severe  acute  
GVHD , chronic GVHD that requires systemic therapy and disease progression or relapse by  one 
year post-transplant .  All treatment arms will be compared to a contemporary control group from 
the CIBMTR database in which all patients received the most commonly used GVHD 
prophylaxis regimen, Tac+MTX.   The results of this study will identify the most p romising 
approach(es) to be tested in a Phase III trial. Selection of the most promising therapy(ies) will be 
made based on the magnitude s of difference in the primary endpoint between each intervention 
group and the control.

2. STUDY DESIGN  
 
2.1.  Study Overview  
 
This is a Phase II randomized, open label, multicenter trial to identify the most promising GVHD 
prophylaxis approach(es) for patients with malignant disease receiving an allogeneic PBSC 
transplant  after a RIC regimen.  Patients will be randomized to one of three new strategies: 
Tac/MTX/Bortezomib, Tac/MTX/Maraviroc or Tac/MMF/Cy .  The primary endpoint of 
GVHD/relapse  or progression -free survival post-transplant  will be compared to a non -
randomized contemporary Tac/MTX control group collected through the CIBMTR to identify 
which agents are promising relative to control.  The control group of patients will not be 
individually matched to patients randomized to one of the treatment arms; rather they wil l be 
selected to satisfy similar eligibility requirements and multivariate regression analysis  will be 
used to adjust  for potential differences in the groups.  Comparisons among the three randomized 
arms will also be used to guide selection of the most pro mising agent for further study.   
 
2.2. Hypothesis and Specific  Objectives  
 
2.2.1.  Hypothesis  
 
At least one of the three treatment approaches will have promising GRFS  compared to the 
control group, which is anticipated to have a rate of GRFS  by 1 year of 23%.  
 
2.2.2.  Study  Objective s  
 
The primary objective of the randomized trial is to compare  one year GVHD/relapse or 
progression -free survival (GRFS) after HSCT between each of three novel GVHD prophylaxis 
approaches and a contemporary control.  An event for this time to eve nt outcome is defined as 
grade III -IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD requiring systemic immunosuppressive treatment, 
disease relapse or progression, or death by any cause. Secondary o bjectives are to describe rates 
of grade II -IV and III -IV acute GVHD, visceral acute GVHD and chronic GVHD; 
immunosuppression -free survival rate at one year; neutrophil and platelet engraftment; donor cell 
engraftment, immune reconstitution, disease relapse  or progression ; transplant -related mortality; 
rates of Grade  3 toxicity acc ording to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) Version 4 .0; incidence of infections; and overall survival.

• Day -1: TBI 200 cGY  
 
2.4.2 Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation  
 
Mobilized PBSC is the only allowed graft source for patients enrolled in this clinical trial.  
 
Donors  will undergo G -CSF mobilization according to local institutional  and donor center 
practices.   PBSC  will be collected by apheresis according to local institutional guidelines.  
Plasma and red cell depletion are allowed for volume reduction or ABO incompatibility but any 
other form of graft manipulation (including ex -vivo T cell depletion) is not permitt ed. 
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol -1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
2-7 The target stem cell dose is between 2 x 106/kg and 10 x 106/kg (actual body weight) CD34+ 
cells. The maximum CD34+ cell dose is 10 x 106/kg.    
 
Up to two leukapheresis procedures may be performed to obtain the minimum CD34+ cell target.  
If, after t wo leukapheresis procedures, fewer than 2 x 106/kg CD34+ cells have been collected, 
transplant centers will have the discretion to continue PBSC  cell harvesting or to proceed to bone 
marrow harvesting to obtain sufficient cells.   If bone marrow harvesting is needed in order to 
meet the desired cell dose, the transplant center needs to notify the Protocol Coordinator , Chairs 
or Officer.   
 
If more than 10 x 106/kg CD34+ stem cells are collected, the excess will either be discarded or 
cryopreserved for future  use, but will not be administered to the patient.  
 
PBSC  will be administered on Day 0 to all patients according to individual institutional 
guidelines after appropriate processing and quantification has been performed by the local 
laboratory. Stem cells a re administered through an indwelling central venous catheter. If infusion 
occurs over two days, Day 0 is the day the last infusion is completed. Sites should avoid  infusion 
after 4pm because this complicates the administration of Bortezomib  if dose modifications are 
required due to toxicity. If modifications are required, late infusion of the stem cell source could 
alter the calendar schedule and result in either a missed dose or a protocol violation.  
 
2.4.3 Tacrolimus/Methotrexate/Bortezomib  
 
Tacrolimus  
 
Tacrolimus  will be given  per institutional practices,  orally  at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg  or 
intravenously at a dose of 0.0 3 mg/kg  starting Day -3. The dose of tacrolimus may be rounded to 
the nearest 0.5 mg for oral formulations. Subsequent dosing wil l be based on blood levels . The 
dose should be  adjusted accordingly to maintain a suggested level of 5 -15 ng/mL . If patients are 
on medications which alter the metabolism of tacrolimus (e.g. azoles), the initial starting dose 
and subsequent doses should be  altered as per institutional practice s. Tacrolimus taper can be 
initiated at a minimum of 90 days post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD.  The rate 
of tapering will be done according institutional practices but patients should be off tacrolimus b y 
Day 180 post HSCT if there is  no evidence of active GVHD.  
 
Dose reductions should be made if toxicity is present or whole blood levels are above the  
recommended range, in the absence of toxicity.  Patients with severe  intolerance of tacrolimus 
may be placed on cyclosporine (trough level of 200 -400 ng/mL) or sirolimus (trough level of 3 -8  
ng/mL) . 
 
Methotrexate  
 
Methotrexate  will be administered , per institutional practices,  at the doses of  15 mg/m2 IV bolus 
on Day +1, and 10 mg/m2 IV bolus on Days +3, +6 and +11 after  hematopoietic  stem cell 
infusion. The Day +1 dose of methotrexate will be given at least 24 hours af ter the  hematopoietic  
stem cell infusion  and at least 30 minutes after the first dose of bortezomib. Dose reduction of

2-8 MTX due to worse ning creatinine clearance after initiation of conditioning regimen, high serum 
levels or development of oral mucositis is allowed according to institutional practices.  
 
Bortezomib  
 
Bortezomib  will be administered at the dose of  1.3 mg/m2 (based upon actual body weight) as an 
approximately  3-5 second IV push on Days +1, +4, and +7 after hematopoietic stem cell 
infusion. There must be at least 72 hours between each dose of bortezomib.  Subcutaneous 
administration of bortezomib is not allowed on this protocol.  
 
Bortezomib dose modifications : 
Before each drug dose, the patient will be evaluated for possible toxicities that may have 
occurred after the previous dose(s).  Toxicities are to be assessed according to the NCI Common 
Toxicity Criteria f or Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0  
Neuropathic pain and peripheral sensory neuropathy are to be managed as described in Table 
2.4b.

Patients with mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ 1.5  ULN) do not require dose adjustment.    
If a patient develops moderate or severe hepatic impairment with bilirubin ≥ Grade 2 ( > 1.5 -3.0 
X ULN) after exposure to Bortezomib , the dose should be held  until the toxicity returns to < 
Grade 2. Restarting Borte zomib  must be done at the next lower dose level as below.

Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
2-9 Once bortezomib is reduced for any toxicity, the dose may not be re -escalated.  
If after bortezomib has been held, the toxicity does not resolve, then bortezomib must be 
discontinued.  
If the toxicit y resolves, as described above, bortezomib may be restarted at the same schedule the 
patient was on prior to holding therapy, and the dose must be reduced by approximately 25% as 
follows:  
• If the patient was receiving 1.3 mg/m2, reduce the dose to 1 mg/m2. 
• If the patient was receiving 1 mg/m2, reduce the dose to 0.7 mg/m2. 
 
2.4.4 Tacrolimus/Methotrexate/Maraviroc  
 
Tacrolimus  
 
Tacrolimus  will be given per institutional practices, orally at a dose of 0.05 mg/kg or 
intravenously at a dose of 0.03 mg/kg starting Day -3. The dose of tacrolimus may be rounded to 
the nearest 0.5 mg for oral formulations. Subsequent dosing will be based on blood levels. The 
dose should be  adjusted accordingly to maintain a suggested level of 5 -15 ng/mL . If patients are 
on medications which  alter the metabolism of tacrolimus (e.g. azoles), the initial starting dose 
and subsequent doses should be altered as per institutional practice s. Tacrolimus taper can be 
initiated at a minimum of 90 days post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD. The rate 
of tapering will be done according to institutional practices but patients should be off tacrolimus 
by Day 180 post HSCT if there is no ev idence of active GVHD.  
 
Dose reductions should be made if toxicity is present or whole blood levels are above the  
recommended range, in the absence of toxicity.  Patients with severe  intolerance of tacrolimus 
may be placed on cyclosporine (trough level o f 200 -400 ng/mL) or sirolimus (trough level of 3 -8  
ng/mL) . 
 
Methotrexate  
 
Methotrexate  will be administered, per institutional practices, at the doses of  15 mg/m2 IV bolus 
on Day +1, and 10 mg/m2 IV bolus on Days +3, +6 and +11 after  hematopoietic  stem ce ll 
infusion. The Day +1 dose of methotrexate will be given at least 24 hours af ter the  hematopoietic  
stem cell infusion . Dose reduction of MTX due to worsening creatinine clearance after initiation 
of conditioning regimen, high serum levels or development of oral mucositis is allowed 
according to institutional practices.  
 
Maraviroc  
 
Maraviroc will be dosed at 300 mg orally twice a day and will start on Day -3 prior  to 
hematopoietic stem cell infusion, and continue until Day 30 post HSCT.   If the patient requires a 
two-day stem cell infusion, maraviroc treatment will end 30 days after the first infusion day  (on 
day 29) . There are no food restrictions .

Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
2-10 Maraviroc dose modifications  
 
The dose of maraviroc for patients who are not taking strong i nhibitors or inducers of CYP 450 
is 300 mg twice daily. The dose will be adjusted in patients who take specific concomitant 
medications based on Table 2. 4c. In particular, the use of anti -seizure medications that induce 
CYP 450 is allowed (with maraviroc d ose adjustment) only if patients are taking them 
chronically. The use of these medications ( carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin ) as anti -
seizure prophylaxis during conditioning is not allowed.  
 
 
TABLE 2 .4c: MARAVIROC DOSING REGIMEN WITH 
CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS Concomitant Medications  Dose of Maraviroc  
Potent CYP3A inhibitors (with or without a potent CYP3A inducer)1: 
ketoconazole , itraconazole, clarithromycin  150 mg twice daily  
Potent CYP3A inducers (without a pot ent CYP3A inhibitor) : 
Rifampin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin  600 mg twice daily  
1 Both voriconazole and posaconazole are moderate CYP3A inhibitors and do not require dose adjustment of 
maraviroc.  Pharmacokinetic data on maraviroc  and voriconazole combination demonstrated no need for dose 
reduction of maraviroc.  
 
Renal dysfunction does not require a dose modification in patients who receive maraviroc  
300 mg twice daily  and the drug should not be held in severe renal dysfunction o r in patients 
undergoing renal replacement therapy. In patients who receive m araviroc  600 mg twice daily or 
150 mg twice daily due to concomitant medications, the drug  should be held in severe renal 
failure (CrCl <30 mL/min), and restarted when the CrCl ≥ 30 at the same dose level  due to lack 
of data for these dose  level s and according to the approved prescribing information . Renal 
function will be calculated using the Cockcroft -Gault formula  and actual body weight . 
 
Maraviroc d ose reduction of 50% will tak e place if the following requirement is met:  
 
Symptoms of postural hypotension such as dizziness, syncope or loss of consciousness together 
with  evidence for postural hypotension defined as a decrease in supine to standing blood 
pressure of at least 10 mmH g (diastolic) or 20 mmHg (systolic) or a standing systolic blood 
pressure lower than 90 mmHg.  The drug must be held until symptomatic hypotension resolves 
prior to reducing the dose.  
 
The following events will mandate  holding maraviroc therapy:  
• Grade 3 or  higher liver toxicity not attributable to other causes such as infection, GVHD , 
toxicity from other drugs  or sinusoid obstructive syndrome/veno -occlusive disease . 
• Other non -hematologic grade 3 or higher toxicity , which is not attributable to other 
causes such as GVHD, infection, disease relapse and chemotherapy toxicity . 
• Severe mucositis, nausea or other complications that precludes administration of an oral 
medication.  
• Persistent symptomatic postural hypotension after reduction to 150 mg twice daily dose . 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol -1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
2-11  
The drug should  be restarted at the same dose after recovery of related toxicities to grade 2 or 
lower  or identification of an alternative cause for these toxicities.  
 
GVHD does not require holding maraviroc therapy unless other criteria are met (e.g., grade 3 
liver toxicity).  
 
2.4.5 Tacrolimus/Mycophenolate Mofetil/Cyclophosphamide  
 
Tacrolimus  
 
Tacrolimus  will be given  per institutional practices,  orally at a dose of 0. 05 mg/kg  or 
intravenously at a dose of 0.03 mg /kg starting Day +5.  Serum levels of tacrolimus will be 
measured at Day 7 and then should be checked  weekly thereafter , and the dose adjusted 
accordingly to maintain a suggested level of 5 -15 ng/mL .  Tacrolimus taper can be initiated at a 
minimum of 90 da ys post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD.  The rate of tapering 
will be done according to institutional practices but patients should be off tacrolimus by Day 180 
post HSCT if there is no evidence of active GVHD.  
 
Dose reductions should be made  if toxicity is present or whole blood levels are above the  
recommended range, in the absence of toxicity.  Patients with severe  intolerance of tacrolimus 
may be placed on cyclosporine (trough level of 200 -400 ng/mL) or sirolimus (trough level of 3 -8  
ng/mL) . 
 
Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)  
 
MMF will b e given at a dose of 15 mg/kg  TID (based upon actual body weight) with the 
maximum total daily do se not to exceed 3 grams (1g  TID, IV or PO ).  MMF prophylaxis will  
start Day 5 and discontinue  after the last dos e on Day 35, or may be continued if active GVHD is 
present.  
 
Cyclophosphamide  
 
Hydration prior to cyclophosphamide may be given according to institutional standards.  A 
recommended approach is as follows:  Patients are instructed to increase fluids overnight before 
cyclophosphamide administration.  Hydration with normal saline at 3 ml/kg/hr IV will be started 
2 hours prior to cyclophosphamide, then the rate will be reduced to 2 ml/kg/hr for 1 hour pre -
cyclophosphamide and continued at 2 ml/kg/hr for 8 hours post -cyclophosphamide.  
 
Mesna will be given in divided doses IV 30 min pre - and at 3, 6, and 8 hours post -
cyclophosphamide or administered per institutional standards.  Mesna dose will be based on the 
cyclophosphamide dose being g iven.  The total d aily dose of M esna is equal to 80% of the total 
daily dose of cyclophosphamide.   
 
Cyclophosphamide [50  mg/kg IBW ; if ABW < IBW, use ABW ] will be given on Day 3 post -
transplant (between 60 and 72 hours after the start of the PBSC infusion) and on Day 4 pos t-
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol -1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
2-12 transplant (approximately 24 hours after Day 3 cyclophosphamide).  Cyclophosphamide will be 
given as an IV infusion over 1 -2 hours (depending on volume).  
 
It is crucial that no immunosuppressive agents  are given prior to transplant, or until 24 
hours after the completion of the post -transplant cyclophosphamide .  This includes 
corticosteroids as anti -emetics.  
 
2.5  Supportive Care  
 
All supportive care will be given in keeping with the BMT CTN Manual of Procedures and local 
institutional pract ice.  Supportive care will be administered in a similar fashion to subjects 
randomized to all three  arms of the study.  
 
2.5.1 Growth Factors  
 
G-CSF may be given per institutional guidelines.  
 
2.5.2 Blood Products  
 
Transfusion thresholds for blood product support will be consistent with the BMT CTN MOP 
and standard institutional guidelines.  All bloo d products will be irradiated.  
 
2.5.3 Prophylaxis Against Infections  
 
Patients will receive infection prophylaxis accordin g to institutional guidelines. Infection 
prophylaxis will include, but is not limited to, agents or strategies (e.g., PCR screening and 
preemptive therapy) to reduce the risk of bacterial, herpes simplex, CMV, HHV -6, EBV, 
Pneumocystis jiroveci, and fungal infections : 
• Antifungal therapy: Prophylaxis with fluconaz ole or other antifungal agents  can be given 
as per local institutional guidelines.   
o Flucon azole , voriconazole  and other azoles  are expected to increas e serum 
tacrolimus  levels, therefore, dosages of tacrolimus should be adjusted 
accordingly.  These drugs also interact with bortezomib and it is recommended to 
avoid using them from Day 0 to Day +7 among patients who are randomized to 
bortezomib.  
 
• CMV: CMV monitoring will be done according to institutional guidelines. It is 
recommended that weekly assessment for CMV be done through Day 60 post -transplant. 
Any reactivation and/or CMV disease will be captured in this study . An Infection form 
must be submitted in AdvantageEDC .   
 
2.5.4 Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG)  
 
IVIG administration will be according to local i nstitutional standard practice.

BORTEZOMIB  
 
Drug Supply, Preparation, Handling and Storage : 
Bortezomib for Injection  (supplied by Millennium Pharmaceutic als, Inc.)  is a sterile lyophilized 
powder for reconstitution and is supplied in vials containing bortezomib and mannitol at a 1:10 
ratio.  For example, vials containing 3.5mg of bortezomib contain 35mg of mannitol.  
 
Vials containing lyophilized Bortezomib  for Injection will be stored according to the label 
requirements.   For the United States, store at USP Controlled Room Temperature which is 25ºC 
(77ºF); excursions permitted from 15 to 30ºC (59 to 86ºF).   To date, stability data indicate that 
the lyophili zed drug product is stable for at least 18 months when stored under the recommended 
conditions.  Stability studies are ongoing, and Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will notify  the 
investigator should this information be revised during the conduct of the s tudy.  
 
Bortezomib  is cytotoxic.  As with all cytotoxic drugs, caution is required when preparing and 
handling Bortezomib solutions.   Cytotoxic drugs should  only be handled by staff specially 
trained in the safe handling of such preparations.  The use of gloves and other appropriate 
protective clothing is recommended.   In case of skin contact, wash the affected area immediately 
and thoroughly with soap and water for at least 15 minutes.  If product contacts eye, immediately 
flush eye thoroughly with water for at least 15 minutes.   Always contact a physician after any 
form of body contact. All materials that have been used for preparation will be disposed of 
according to standard practices. A log must be kept of all disposed materials.  
 
Drug is available in sterile, single use vials containing 3.5 mg of Bortezomib . The vials are not 
patient specific.  Each vial of Bortezomib  for Injection will be reconstituted under a laminar flow 
biological cabinet (hood) within eight hours before dosing .  For intravenous infusions, 
reconstitution  must be  with 3.5 mL of normal (0.9%) saline, Sodium Chloride Injection USP

3-1 CHAPTER 3  
 
 
3. STUDY ENDPOINTS  
 
3.1. Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is GVHD/relapse or progression -free survival (GRFS).  All randomized 
patients and patients in the contemporary CIBMTR control will be analyzed for this endpoint.  
An event for this time to event outco me is defined as grade III -IV acute GVHD, chronic GVHD 
requiring systemic  immunosuppressive  treatment, disease relapse or progression, or death by any 
cause.  Patients will be followed up for at least one year for this endpoint.  
 
Use of systemic immunosupp ressive therapy for treatment of chronic GVHD is at the discretion 
of the treating physicians.  The event of interest is the development of chronic GVHD severe 
enough to warrant any additional systemic treatment(s).  Also, continuation of study -mandated 
GVHD prophylaxis  beyond Day 180 in the presence of chronic GVHD will also be considered 
an event  with time to  event determined as date of c hronic GVHD onset .   
 
3.2. Secondary Endpoints  
 
3.2.1.  Acute GVHD  
 
Cumulative incidences of grade II -IV and III -IV acute GVHD will be determined.  Acute GVHD 
will be grade d according to the BMT CTN MOP.   The time of onset of acute grades II -IV and 
III-IV acute GVHD will be recorded, as well as the maximum grade achieved.  This endpoint 
will be evaluated through 180 days post HSCT.  Within the acute GVHD endpoint, the 
proportion of patients with visceral involvement (liver or gut) will be described.  
 
3.2.2.  Chronic GVH D 
 
The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD will be determined.  Data will be collected directly 
from providers and chart revi ew according to the re commendations of the NIH Consen sus 
Conference.  Eight organs will be scored on a 0 -3 scale to reflect degree of chronic GVHD 
involvement.  Liver and pulmonary function test results , and use of systemic therapy for 
treatment of chronic  GVHD  will also be recorded.  These data will allow calculation of the NIH 
global severity scores of mild, moderate and severe chronic GVHD, which has been associated 
with transplant related mortality and overall survival.  Assessment of chronic GVHD will occur 
up to one year post HSCT.  
 
3.2.3.  1-year Immun osuppression -free Survival  
 
Patients who are alive, relapse -free, and do not need ongoing immune  suppression to control 
GVHD at one year post HSCT are considered successes for this endpoint.  Immune  suppression  
is defined as any systemic agents used to control or suppress GVHD .  Corticosteroid doses of 
>10 mg present will be considered active systemic immune suppression treatment.  Patients who 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol -1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
3-2 discontinued immune suppression < 15 days prior to the 1 -year time p oint will be considered to 
be on immune suppression for this endpoint.   
 
3.2.4.  Hematologic Recovery  
 
Hematologic recovery will be assessed according to neutrophil and platelet counts recovery after 
HSCT. Neutrophil recovery is defined as achieving an absolute neutrophil count (ANC)  
≥ 500/mm3 for three consecutive measurements on three different days.  The firs t of the three 
days will be designated the day of neutrophil recovery.  The competing event is de ath without 
neutrophil recovery.  For patients who never drop ANC below 500/mm3, the date of neutrophil 
recovery will be Day +1 post HSCT.  
 
Platelet recovery is defined by two different metrics : the first day of a sustained platelet count 
>20,000/mm3 or >50,000/mm3 with no platelet transfusion in the preceding seven days.  The first 
day of sustained platelet count above these thresholds will be designated the day of platelet 
engraftment.  For patients who never drop their platelet count below  20,000/mm3 or 50,000/mm3, 
the date of  platelet recovery will be Day +1 post HSCT.  
 
3.2.5.  Donor Cell Engraftment  
 
Donor cell engraftment will be assessed with donor/recipient chimerism studies .  Chimerism 
may be evaluated in bone marrow, whole blood or blood cell fractions, including CD3 and CD33 
or CD15 fraction.   For the purpose of this protocol, mixed chimerism is defined as the presence 
of donor cells, as a proportion of total cells to be <  95% but > 5% in the bone marrow or 
peripheral blood.   Full donor chimerism is defi ned as ≥ 95% of donor cells. Mixed and full 
chimerism will be evidence of donor cell engraftment.  Donor cells of ≤ 5% will be considered as 
graft rejection.  The proportion of patients with each level of chimerism described above will be 
described as part  of this outcome.  For sorted blood cell fractions, CD3+ donor cell chimerism 
will be used to define the donor/recipient chimerism status.  
 
3.2.6.  Disease Relapse or Progression  
 
Relapse is defined by either morphological or cytogenetic evidence of acute leukemi a or MDS 
consistent with pretransplant features, or radiologic evidence of lymphoma, documented or not 
by biopsy.  Progression of disease applies to patients with lymphoproliferative diseases 
(lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia) not in remission prio r to transplantation.  The 
event is defined as increase in size of prior sites of disease or evidence of new sites of disease, 
documented or not by biopsy.  
 
Acute leukemia and MDS  – Relapse will be diagnosed when there is:  
- Reappearance of leukemia blast c ells in the peripheral blood; or,  
- >5% blasts in the bone marrow, not attributable to another cause (e.g. bone marrow 
regeneration)  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol -1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
3-3 - The appearance of previous or new dysplastic changes  (MDS specific)  within the bone 
marrow  with or without falling donor chim erism ; or  
- The development of extramedullary leukemia or leukemic cells in the cerebral spinal 
fluid or  
- The reappearance of cytogenetic abnormalities present prior to transplantation  
 
Lymphoproliferative  Diseases  – Relapse or progression  will be diagnosed when there is:  
- Appearance of any new lesion more than 1.5 cm in any axis during or at the end of 
therapy, even if other lesions are decreasing in size.  Increased FDG uptake in a 
previously unaffected site will only be considered relapsed or progressive disease after 
confirmation with other modalities. In patients with no prior history of pulmonary 
lymphoma, new lung nodules identified by CT are mostly benign.  Thus, a therapeutic 
decision should not be made sol ely on the basis of the PET without histologic 
confirmation.  
- At least a 50% increase from nadir in the sum of the product diameters of any previously 
involved nodes, or in a single involved node, or the size of other lesions (e.g., splenic or 
hepatic nodul es).  To be considered progressive disease, a lymph node with a diameter of 
the short axis of less than 1.0 cm must increase by  50% and to a size of 1.5 x 1.5 cm or 
more than 1.5 cm in the long axis.  
 
Lesions should be PET positive if observed in a typi cal FDG -avid lymphoma or the 
lesion was PET positive before therapy unless the lesion is too small to be detected with 
current PET systems (<1.5 cm in its long axis by CT).  
 
- In addition to the criteria above, patients with CLL  who present in complete remis sion 
prior to transplantation  may fulfill the relapse definition if there is reappearance of 
circulating malignant cells that are phenotypic ally characteristic of CLL.  
 
Institution of any therapy to treat persistent, progressive or relapse d disease, inclu ding the 
withdrawal of immunosuppressive therapy or donor lymphocyte infusion , will be 
considered evidence of relapse/progression regardless of whether the criteria described 
above were met.  
 
3.2.7.  Transplant -related Mortality  
 
The cumulative incidence of TRM w ill be estimated at Days 100, 180, and 1 year after HSCT.  
An event for this endpoint is death without evidence of disease progression or recurrence. 
Disease progression or recurrence will be considered competing events.  
 
3.2.8.  Toxicity  
 
All grades ≥ 3 toxicitie s according to CTCAE, version 4 will be tabulated for each intervention 
arm.  The proportion of patients developing grade ≥ 3 AE across intervention arms will be 
compared.   
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol -1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
3-4  
3.2.9.  Infections  
 
The incidence of definite and probable viral,  fungal and bac terial infections will be tabul ated for 
each intervention arm.  The cumulative incidence of CMV reactivation in the first 100 days post 
HSCT will be described.  All Grade 2 and 3 infections will be reported according to the BMT 
CTN MOP.   
 
3.2.10.  Disease -Free Surv ival 
 
Disease free survival is the time from date of transplant to death or relapse/progression, 
whichever comes first.  The event for this endpoint is relapse/progression or death.  Patients alive 
and disease free will be censored at last follow -up.  
 
3.2.11.  GVH D-Free Survival  
 
An event for this time to event outcome is defined as grade III -IV acute GVHD, chronic  GVHD 
requiring systemic immunosuppressive treatment, or death by any cause.  The time for this 
GVHD -free survival endpoint is the time from date of tran splant to death or grade 3/4 acute 
GVHD or chronic GVHD requiring immunosuppressive treatment, whichever comes first.  
Patients alive without experiencing an event will be censored at last follow -up. 
 
3.2.12.  Overall Survival  
 
Overall survival is defined as the  time interval between date of transplant and death from any 
cause or for surviving patients, to last follow -up.  The event for this endpoint is death from any 
cause.

4. PATIENT ENROLLMENT AND EVALUATION S 
 
4.1. Approaching Patients, Eligibility Screening and Obtaining Consent  
 
Subjects will be approached for this study after the decision to proceed with transplantation is 
made and a suitable HLA -matched PBSC  donor is identified. Patients willing to participate in the 
trial will sign an Institutional Review Board approved consent form.   Transplant physicians will 
evaluate the patient eligibility for randomization onto this study (see Section 2.2).  Eligibility 
criteria will be verified and ineligible patients will proceed off study an d no further follow -up 
will be obtained .  Transplant center personnel will record the documentation of patient consent in 
EMMES AdvantageEDCSM (Electronic Data Capture, an Internet -based data entry system) and 
patients will be registered through AdvantageE DC. 
 
4.2. Transplant Protocol Registration  
 
Before randomization occurs, the transplant center must state through AdvantageEDC which 
conditioning regimen will be used for the enrolled subject.  Such a registration step will avoid 
potential biases that preferent ial use of a certain regimen on one treatment arm could confer to 
the study.  At this stage, the transplant center will also verify that the patient is still a candidate 
for transplantation, and eligible for the trial.    
 
4.3. Randomization  
 
Once the subject is  deemed eligible and has given written informed consent, and the transplant 
center has confirmed patient eligibility and registered the patient’s conditioning regimen, 
randomization occurs.  Patients should be randomized as close as possible to the initiat ion of the 
conditioning regimen, and preferably within 7 days of and not more than 14 days from the 
initiation of conditioning.  If there is a delay in conditioning, certain pre -transplant evaluations 
will have to be repeated . Refer to section 4.6.1 Patient  Assessments -pre-transplant evaluations.  
 
4.4. Treatment Scheduling  
 
Treatment should be initiated as soon as possible after randomization.  This will prevent subject 
attrition prior to HSCT  for reasons such as disease progression.  Consequently, all treatment s 
related to the transplant should be scheduled PRIOR to randomization. This includes planning an 
admission date and ensuring that the PBSC donor can be mobilized and undergo apheresis  in a 
coordinated fashion with the planned transplant.   
 
4.5. Patient Evalua tion 
 
The patient pre -transplant evaluation must be completed within three  weeks (≤21 days) of 
randomization. If an unexplained delay in treatment occurs and the initiation of conditioning is 
greater than 14 days after randomization, some pre -transplant evaluations may need to be 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol -1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
4-2 repeated. See section 4.6.1 Patient Assessments -pre-transplant evaluations. This step  is necessary 
because patient organ function, infection status and status of malignancy may vary over time.  
This evaluation will protect patients with a new contraindication to transplant from initiating 
transplant therapy at an unsafe time.  
 
4.6. Study Monito ring 
 
The follow -up schedule for scheduled study visits is outlined in Table 4.6a.  A detailed 
description of each of the forms and the procedures required for forms completion and 
submission can be found in the Data Management Handbook and User’s Guide.

4.6.2.  Criteria for Forms Submission  
 
Criteria for timeliness of submission for all study forms are detailed in the Data Management 
Handbook and User’s Guide.  Forms that are not entered into AdvantageEDC within the 
specified time will be considered delinquent.  A missing form will continue to be requested 
either until the form is entered into the AdvantageEDC and integrated into the Data and 
Coordinating Center’s (DCC) master database, or until an exception is granted and entered i nto 
the Missing Form Exception File, as detailed in the Data Management Handbook.  
 
4.6.3.  Reporting Patient Deaths  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol -1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
4-7 Recipient death information must  be entered into AdvantageEDC within 24 hours of knowledge 
of the patient’s death.  If the cause of death is unknow n at that time, it need not be recorded at 
that time.  However, once the cause of death is determined, the form must be updated in 
AdvantageEDC.  
 
4.7. Adverse Event Reporting  Requirements  
 
Reporting of adverse events on the BMT CTN 1203 trial has unique require ments due to the 
addition of bortezomib and maraviroc  as part of this protocol. Adverse event reporting 
requirements are summarized below and further described in Appendix J.  
 
4.7.1.  Definitions  
 
Adverse Event :  An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any unfavorable  and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease that is temporally associated 
with the use of a medical treatment or procedure regardless of whether it is considered related to 
the medical treatment or procedure.  
 
Expectedness : An adverse event can be Expected or Unexpected  
• Expected adverse events  are those that have been previously identified as resulting from 
administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered 
expected  when  it appears in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, 
the package insert or is included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.  
• Unexpected adverse events  are those that vary in nature, intensity or frequency from 
informa tion in the current adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package 
insert, or when it is not included in the informed consent document as a potential risk.  
 
4.7.2.  BMT CTN Adverse Event Reporting Guidelines  
 
It is BMT CTN policy that AEs must be rep orted even if the investigator is unsure whether a 
relationship exists between the adverse event and the use of the study treatment. Reporting of 
AEs for BMT CTN 1203 will be consistent with the BMT CTN Manual of Procedure s. 
Additional requirements specifi c to this protocol are outlined below an d in Appendix J.   
 
In BMT CTN studies, expected adverse events are reported via the web -based electronic data 
capture system, AdvantageEDC. Events are captured on calendar -driven case report forms (e.g., 
Toxicity and  Hematology/Chemistry) or event -driven case report forms (e.g., 
Relapse/Progression, Secondary Graft Failure, and Death).  
 
Unexpected, grades 3 -5 AEs , irrespective of the attribution of the event to the study drug  
/procedure/treatment,  will be reported th rough the expedited AE reporting system via  
AdvantageEDC , and will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for 
Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.0 .  The BMT CTN 1203 protocol has three distinct 
interventions to which  patients are randomi zed. Deter mination of expectedness for events 
occurring on each treatment arm will be at the discretion of the investigator as described in 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol -1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
4-8 Appendix J, section J.3. Unexpected, grades 4 -5 AEs must be reported within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event.  Une xpected, grade 3 AEs must be reported within three business 
days of knowledge of the event.  The NHLBI Data and Safety Monitoring Board will receive 
summary reports of all adverse experiences at least twice yearly . 
 
4.7.3.  Additional Adverse Event Reporting Requirements for Patients Randomized to the 
Tacrolimus/Methotrexate/Bortezomib Arm  
 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MPI) is supplying bortezomib for this study and a description 
of additional adverse event reporting requirements for this study, detailed in Appendix J apply  
to any patient who is randomized to receive bortezomib as part of the GVHD prophylaxis 
regimen. The additional adverse event reporting period for bortezomib  begins with the first dose 
(Day +1) and continues until 30 days after the last dose of bortezomib  (Day +7 plus 30 days = 
Day +37).  Along with the additional adverse event reporting requirements, any adverse event 
reported through the expedited AE reporting system will  include the investigator’s assessment of 
relationship to bortezomi b (unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite).  
 
4.7.4.  Adverse Event Reporting for Patients Randomized to the Tacrolimus/Methotrexate/  
Maraviroc  Arm 
 
Patients randomized to the maraviroc  arm will have all unexpected grade 3 -5 AEs reported 
throughout the course of the study, including  the investigator’s assessment of relationship to 
maraviroc  (unrelated, unlikely, possible, probable, or definite).  
 
4.7.5.  Procedures for Reporting Exposure to Bort ezomib  or Maraviroc  During Pregnancy and 
Birth Events  
 
If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects that she is pregnant while taking bortezomib or 
maraviroc for this study, she must inform the Investigator  immediately and permanently 
discontinue study drug .  The pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be 
reported within 24 hours of the Investigator’s knowledge of the pregnancy. The event must be 
reported through the expedited AE reporting system via AdvantageEDC  (Adverse Event forms) .  
 
The Investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must report the 
outcome of the pregnancy and neonatal status as a follow -up to the original expedited AE report 
in AdvantageEDC.  
 
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s participation in 
this study, the Investigator  must also immediately report the pregnancy as detailed above. Every 
effort should be made to follow the pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome.  
 
4.8. CIBMTR Data Reporting  
 
Centers participating in BMT CTN trials must register pre - and post -transplant outcomes on all 
consecutive hematopoietic stem cell transplants done at their institution during their time of 
participation to the Center for International Blood and Marrow Tra nsplant Research (CIBMTR).  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol -1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
4-9 Registration is done using procedures and forms of the Stem Cell Transplant Outcomes Database 
(SCTOD).  (Note: Federal legislation requires submission of these forms for all US allotransplant 
recipients.)  Enrollment in BMT CTN 1203  must be indicated on the SCTOD pre -transplant 
registration form.  Additionally, CIBMTR pre - and post - transplant  Comprehensive Report 
Forms must also be submitted for all patients enrolled on this trial. CIBMTR forms will be 
submitted directly to the CIBMTR at the times specified on the Form Submission Schedule.   
 
4.9. Registration of CIBMTR Controls  
 
This clinical trial will compare outcomes from patients enrolled in the intervention arms to a 
contemporary control from the CIBMTR. Selection of the controls  will start by the selection of 
transplant centers, which will not be the same centers participating in the enrollment of patients 
in the intervention arms.  
 
4.9.1.  Selection of Control Arm Participating Transplant Centers  
 
CIBMTR research centers with experienc e in submitting  comprehensive report  forms  to the 
CIBMTR will be eligible to participate in the study. Additionally, participating centers will need 
to agree to participat e in this study and to submit all CIBMTR and supplemental report forms 
required for t his study reported according to the pre -specified schedule.  
 
4.9.2.  Enrollment procedure for the control arm  
 
Data reported on pre -transplant Transplant Essential Data forms to CIBMTR by participating 
centers will be monitored on a weekly basis to screen patients who fulfill the eligibility criteria. 
Control patients who fulfill eligibility criteria (Section 2.2.3) and who have signed a consent to 
allow their data to be used f or research will be assigned to the CIBMTR comprehensive data 
reporting track (CRF –track) and centers will be notified. Forms due requirements for the CRF 
track will be implemented. Expected data reporting will be same as what routinely is collected by 
the CIBMTR from patients in the CRF -track, including basic recipient information, disease 
specific and infusion information , and fo llow-up at 100 days, 6 months and at 1 year. All 
required data for the primary end point analysis is included in the CIBMTR data  reporting forms .  
Supplemental data collection related to immune suppression use will be collected  along with the 
1 year follow up form.  CIBMTR data from control patients will be reviewed systematically for 
elements of the primary end point . 
 
Timely  data reporting will be a requirement for the control patients and reporting compliance 
will be monitored quarterly. A minimum of 270  controls will be target ed in order to ensure  
sufficient patients comparable to the randomized population for the compariso n.

5-1 CHAPTER 5  
 
 
5. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
5.1 Study Design  
 
The study is designed as a Phase II randomized, open label, multicenter trial to identify the most 
promising GVHD prophylaxis approach(es) for allogeneic transplant recipients with malignant 
disease using a reduced intensity conditioning regimen.  Patients will be randomized to one of 
three promising new strategies: Tac/MTX/Bortezomib, Tac/MTX/Mara viroc or Tac/MMF/Cy.  
The primary endpoint of GRFS  will be compared to a non -randomized concurrent Tac/MTX 
control group collected through the CIBMTR to identify which agents are promising on the basis 
of their efficacy relative to control.  The control gr oup of patients will not be individually 
matched to patients randomized to one of the treatment arms; rather , they will satisfy similar 
eligibility requirements and multivariate regression will be used to adjust for potential 
differences in the groups.  Estimates of primary and secondary endpoints for the three 
randomized arms will also be used to guide selection of the most promising agent(s) for further 
study.  The target enrollment is 540 patients  (270 patients across the 3 treatment arms and 270 
CIBMT R contemporary controls) . 
 
5.1.1.  Accrual  
 
It is estimated that 30 months of accrual will be necessary to enroll the targeted sample size.  
Both Core and Affiliate  Centers will enroll patients on this study.  Accrual will be reported by 
race, ethnicity, ge nder, a nd age . 
 
5.1.2.  Randomization  
 
All patients will be randomized within 7 days prior to the initiation of conditioning therapy.  
Randomization will be performed in a 1:1 :1 ratio using random block sizes for the three  arms.  
Randomization will be stratified by  donor  type/HLA mismatching (Matched Sibling vs. Matched 
Unrelated vs. Mismatched Unrelated)  and by disease risk (High vs Low , see Section 1.5). 
 
5.1.3.  Primary Endpoint  
 
The primary endpoint is  time to GRFS  from the time of transplant.  All transplanted patients will 
be followed for the primary endpoint for at least one year; however the primary endpoint will be 
analyzed as a time to event endpoint. The primary analysis will be performed using a modified 
intent -to-treat principle and will be performed among transplante d patients only.  
 
5.1.4.  Primary Hypothesis  
 
The primary objective of the study is to determine which if any of the three GVHD prophylaxis 
strategies have promising GRFS  compared to a non -randomized CIBMTR control group.  To 
address this objective, the hazard ra tio (HR) for GRFS  will be estimated for each treatment arm 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol -1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
5-2 compared to the control group, after adjustment for patient characteristics as described in Section 
5.5. The hypotheses of interest for each comparison to control are:  
 
H0: HR=1 vs. Ha: HR<1.  
 
5.2. Samp le Size and Power Considerations  
 
Sample size and power considerations are based on the comparison of each treatment group 
(n=90 patients) to the concurrent nonrandomized CIBMTR control cohort (n= 270 patients).  A 
treatment is considered promising relative  to the control if its HR relative to control, after 
adjustment for covariates, is significant at the one -sided significance level of 0.05.  We are using 
one-sided testing since this is a phase 2 trial to identify whether one of these agents is promising 
relative to the control , and we are not interested in detecting treatments that are worse than 
control since they would not be pursued further .  Control rates for GRFS  are expected to be 
approximately 23% by one year, based on a recent analysis of CIBMTR data, although we 
considered control rates at one year as high as 35%.  In addition to the final analysis, an interim 
analysis for futility will be conducted after 30 patients in each group have 6 months of follow -up, 
anticipated to be approximately 50% through the accrual period assuming uniform accrual over 
30 months.   If fewer than 1 4 patients are alive and GVHD/relapse free at 6 months, closure of the 
study arm for f utility will be considered.   
 
The operating characteristics of this study design, including the impact of the futility stopping 
rule, were determined in a simulation study.  GRFS  was assumed to follow an exponential 
distribution, and follow -up was censore d at one year for all patients. The probability of GRFS  by 
one year was assumed to be 23% or 35% for the control group, while probabilities of GRFS  for 
the treatment groups were 5%, 10%, or 20% higher at one year, depending on the scenario.  
Probabilities of stopping for futility were calculated for each arm, along with the expected 
sample size (ExpN) assuming uniform accrual over 30 months .  Final probabilities of identifying 
a treatment as promising relative to control were estimated, along with the proba bility of 
identifying at least one treatment as promising.  This latter probability is the same as the 
Familywise Type I error rate when all the treatments have the same GRFS .  Finally, we included 
the probabilities of selecting a particular treatment arm as the winner, among those identified as 
promising, based  on having the lowest HR relative to control.  However, this is for illustrative 
purposes only, since it is possible that multiple treatments may be identified as good candidates 
for further study in  a follow on phase 3 trial.  This probability is most interpretable when there is 
clear separation in outcomes between the best treatment and the other treatments.  The 
simulation results are shown in Table 5. 2 below.  Adjustment for covariates was not inc orporated 
into the simulation study, although it will be used in the final analysis.  
 
This study design has 81-87% power to identify a treatment as promising when its GRFS  at one 
year is 15% better than control.  The probability of stopping an arm for futi lity is approximately 
37% for treatment arms which are no better than control, when the control is correctly specified 
(23% at one year).  If the control rates are higher, there is less impact of the futility boundary, 
with a 6% likelihood of stopping an a rm for futility when it has the same outcome as the control.  
If none of the treatments has GRFS  better than the control, the overall (Familywise) type I error 
rate is approximately 11-13%.  When the best treatment has GRFS  which is 1 5% better than the 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol -1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
5-3 other two arms, the  probability of correct selection of the winner based on having the best 
observed outcomes is over 80%.  This means that there is at least an 80% chance that the truly 
best treatment will have the best observed outcomes.   When the GRFS  for the best treatment  is 
only 10% better  than the other two treatments , there is a 7 5-81% chance of correctly selecting 
the winner.

Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
5-5 5.3. Interim Analysis and Stopping Guidelines  
 
5.3.1.  Interim Analysis for Efficacy  
 
There will be no interim analyses for efficacy.  
 
5.3.2.  Interim Analysis for Futility  
 
An interim analysis for futility will be conducted based on the 6 month G RFS when 30 patients 
in each arm have 6 months of follow -up available.  If fewer than 1 4 are alive and GVHD/relapse 
free among the first 30 patients on an arm, closure of the study arm for futility will be 
considered.  This futility stopping rule is meant to be a guidance only, based on an anticipated 6 
month G RFS in the control group of 45 -50%; the DSMB may also consider other factors, such as 
the risk characteristics of these patients, when deciding whether to follow the futility stopping 
rule.  A futility stopping rule which incorporates a direct comparison to the concurrent CIBMTR 
controls  along with risk adjustment is not feasible because of the different sources for data 
collection.  However, if a futility rule is triggered so that the DSMB is considering dropping an 
arm for futility, a c omparison with CIBMTR controls may be considered bef ore a final decision 
to drop an arm is made.   
 
5.3.3.  Guidelines for Safety Monitoring  
 
Monitoring of a key safety endpoint will be conducted monthly, and if rates significantly exceed 
pre-set thresholds, the NHLBI will be notified in order that the DSMB can be advised.  Policies 
and composition of the DSMB are described in the BMT CTN's Manual of Procedures.  The 
stopping guideline serves as trigger for consultation with the DSMB for additional review.  
 
The key safety endpoint for this study is mortality.  The r ate of mortality will be monitored up to 
100 days post -randomization separately in each of the three treatment arms.  At least three events 
must be observed in order to trigger review.  The expected probability of 100 day mortality after 
a reduced intensit y conditioning transplant is 10 -15%, based on CIBMTR data.  Each month, the 
null hypothesis that the 100 -day mortality rate is less than or equal to 15% is tested.  An 
extension of the sequential probability ratio test (SPRT) for censored exponential data will be 
used for monitoring, as described in greater detail below and in Appendix E . 
 
This sequential testing procedure conserves type I error at 5% across all of the monthly 
examinations for a treatment arm.  The SPRT can be represented graphically.  At e ach monthly 
interim analysis, the total time on study is plotted against the total number of endpoints (e.g., 
patients experiencing death).  The continuation region of the SPRT is defined by two parallel 
lines.  Only the lower boundary will be used for mon itoring to protect against excessive 100 -day 
mortality.  If the graph falls below the lower boundary, the SPRT rejects the null hypothesis, and 
concludes that there are more events than predicted by the observed time on study.  Otherwise, 
the SPRT continue s until enrollment reaches the maximum of 90 patients.  
 
This procedure assumes a censored exponential distribution for the time until death during the 
first 100 days, and censors follow -up time after 100 days.  Only deaths that occur on or before 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
5-6 the patie nt has been followed for 100 days are counted.  Total time on study is computed as time 
from registration to death, or to 100 days, whichever comes first, summed for all patients on 
study.  
 
The usual measures of performance of an SPRT are the error probabi lities  and  of rejecting 
H0 when  = 0 and of accepting H 1 when  = 1, respectively, and the expected sample size 
E(N|i).  The tests to be used in this protocol were developed from the following SPRT:   
• A SPRT contrasting 15% versus 30% 100 -day rate of mortality results in decision 
boundaries with a common slope of 13.310 and a lower intercept of –42.278 , with 
nominal type I and II errors of 7% and 15%, respectively.  
 
The actual operating characteristics of the truncated test, shown in Table 5. 3, were determined in 
a simulation study that assumed uniform accrual of 90 individuals over a 30 month time period, 
and exponential time to failure after randomization.   
 
TABLE 5.3:  OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS OF SEQUENTIAL TESTING 
PROCEDURE FROM A SIMULATION STUDY WITH 10,000 REPLICATIONS  
 
Day 100 MORTALITY  
 
True 100 -Day Rate  15% 25% 30% 
Probability Reject Null  0.046 0.650 0.917 
Mean Month Stopped  32.3 21.3 14.4 
Mean # Endpoints in 100 Days  13.1 14.4 11.6 
Mean # Patients Enrolled  87.6 60.5 42.5 
 
For example, the testing procedure rejects the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative 5% of 
the time when the true 100 -day mortality rate is 15%, and 92% of the time when the rate is 30%.  
This corresponds to a type I error rate of  = 0.05 and a ty pe II error rate of  = 0.08.  When the 
true 100 -day mortality rate is 30%, on average, the DSMB will be consulted 1 4 months after 
opening, when 1 2 events have been observed in 42 patients.  
 
5.4. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics  
 
Demographics and baseli ne characteristics will be summarized for all patients.  Characteristics to 
be examined are: age, gender, race/ethnicity, performance status, primary disease,  disease 
specific risk categories , hematopoietic cell transplant comorbidity index (HCT CI), donor  type 
and HLA matching, donor/recipient CMV status, donor/recipient sex match, donor/recipient 
ABO match, and conditioning regimen .  Between group comparisons will be performed for 
continuous variables via a Kruskal -Wallis test and for categorical variable s, via the chi -square 
test.

Kaplan -Meier curves along with 90% confidence intervals will be constructed to estimate GRFS  
probabilities for each treatment group as well as the control.  The primary analysis will consist of 
a comparison of GRFS  among transplanted patients for each treatment arm to the control group, 
based on a multivariate Cox regression model.  The following factors will be included in the 
regression model: age, disease, donor type/HLA matching.  In addition, a stepwise model 
building strategy with a significance level of 0.1 will be used to consider additional factors from 
the list of demographic/baseline characteristics.  A significance level of 0.05 (one -sided) will be 
used for the hazard ratio of each treatment arm relative to the control to determine whether a 
treatment should be considered promising for further study.  Confidence intervals for the hazard 
ratio using a 90% confidence level will also be constructed for each hazard ratio.  The 
familywise type I error rate over all the comparisons to the control is expected to be 
approximately 10 -11% based on simulations in Section 5.2. This familywise type I error rate can 
be interpreted as the probability of incorrectly identifying at least one of the treatments as 
promising when they all have identical GRFS  compared to the control.  Direct statistical 
comparison of GRFS  among the randomized treatment arms will not be conducted, since the 
study is not powered for these co mparisons.   
 
5.6. Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
 
Since this is a Phase II trial, most of the analysis of secondary endpoints will involve estimation 
with 90% confidence intervals rather than formal statistical comparisons.  All secondary 
endpoints will be described from the time of transplant ation ; however, the number of patients 
randomized but dropping out prior to transplant ation  will also be described  by treatment arm .  
No direct statistical comparisons among the randomized treatment arms will be conduct ed, since 
the study is not powered for these comparisons.  For a select set of endpoints (acute and chronic 
GVHD, TRM, relapse, DFS, and survival ) which are components of the composite primary 
endpoint, an analysis comparing each treatment arm to the contr ol group will be conducted.  To 
alleviate concerns about multiple testing, these secondary analyses for a particular treatment 
group will only be performed if the primary endpoint is significantly different between that 
treatment group and the control grou p.  Details of the analyses of secondary endpoints are given 
below.   
 
5.6.1.  Acute GVHD  
 
Incidence of acute GVHD grade II-IV and grade III-IV up to 180 days will be estimated with 
90% confidence intervals for each treatment group as well as the control using the  cumulative 
incidence estimate, treating death prior to aGVHD as a competing event.  A multivariate Cox 
regression model for the cause -specific hazard of aGVHD will be used to compare the treatment 
groups with the control group, after adjustment for baseli ne characteristics as described for the 
primary endpoint.   
  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
5-8 5.6.2.  Chronic GVHD  
 
Incidence of chronic GVHD up to 1 year will be estimated with 90% confidence intervals for 
each treatment group as well as the control using the cumulative incidence estimate, trea ting 
death prior to c hronic GVHD as a competing event.  A multivariate Cox regression model for the 
cause -specific hazard of c hronic GVHD will be used to compare the treatment groups with the 
control group, after adjustment for baseline characteristics as described for the primary endpoint.   
 
5.6.3.  Immun osuppression -Free Survival at One Year  
 
Proportions of patients alive, relapse free, and off immune suppression at one year will be 
described for each treatment group and for the control, along with 90% confidenc e intervals.  If 
there is censoring prior to one year, multistate models will be constructed to estimate these 
probabilities.  Agreement between this endpoint and the primary endpoint of GRFS  will be 
described using cross -tabulation frequencies and assesse d using the Kappa statistic.   
 
5.6.4.  Hematologic Recovery  
 
Probabilities of neutrophil recovery  by Day 28 and Day 100 will be described with 90% 
confidence intervals for each treatment group using the cumulative incidence estimate, treating 
death as a competing  event.  Similarly, probabilities of platelet recovery  by Day 60 and Day 100 
will be described with 90% confidence intervals for each treatment group using the cumulative 
incidence estimate, treating death as a competing event.   
 
5.6.5.  Donor Cell Engraftment  
 
Donor chimerism at Day 28  and Day 100  after transplantation in each of the randomized 
treatment arm s will be described numerically as median and range for those evaluable as well as 
according to propor tions with full (>95%), mixed (5 -95% donor cells), graft  rejection (< 5%), or 
death prior to assessment of donor chimerism.   Incidence of secondary graft failure (chimerism 
<5% after initial donor cell engraftment) will be described for each arm using frequencies.  
 
5.6.6.  Disease Relapse or Progression  
 
Incidence of disease relapse or progression up to 1 year will be estimated with 90% confidence 
intervals for each treatment group as well as the control using the cumulative incidence estimate, 
treating death prior to disease relapse as a competing event.  A multivaria te Cox regression 
model for the cause -specific hazard of relapse or progression will be used to compare the 
treatment groups with the control group, after adjustment for baseline characteristics as described 
for the primary endpoint.   
 
5.6.7.  Transplant -related Mortality  
 
Incidence of transplant -related mortality (TRM) up to 1 year will be estimated for each treatment 
group as well as the control using the cumulative incidence estimate, treating disease relapse or 
progression as a competing event.  A multivariate  Cox regression model for the cause -specific 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
5-9 hazard of TRM will be used to compare the treatment groups with the control group, after 
adjustment for baseline characteristics as described for the primary endpoint.   
 
5.6.8.  Toxicity  
 
All Grade  3 toxicities will be tabulated by grade for each randomized treatment arm, by type of 
toxicity as well as the peak grade overall.  Toxicity frequencies will be described for each time 
interval as well as cumulative over time.   
 
5.6.9.  Infections  
 
The number of infections and the number of patients experiencing infections will be tabulated for 
each randomized treatment arm by type of infection, severity, and time period after transplant.   
 
5.6.10.  Disease -free Survival  
 
Kaplan -Meier curves will be constructed to estimate disease free surv ival probabilities for each 
treatment group as well as the control.  A multivariate Cox regression model for the risk of death 
or relapse/progression will be used to compare the treatment groups with the control group, after 
adjustment for baseline charact eristics as described for the primary endpoint.   
 
5.6.11.  GVHD -Free Survival  
 
Kaplan -Meier curves will be constructed to estimate GVHD free survival probabilities for each 
treatment group as well as the control.  A multivariate Cox regression model for the risk o f death 
or GVHD will be used to compare the treatment groups with the control group, after adjustment 
for baseline characteristics as described for the primary endpoint.    
 
5.6.12.  Overall Survival  
 
Kaplan -Meier curves will be constructed to estimate overall survival probabilities for each 
treatment group as well as the control.  A multivariate Cox regression model for the risk of death 
will be used to compare the treatment groups with the control group, after adjustment for 
baseline characteristics as describ ed for the primary endpoint.   
 
5.7. Safety Analysis  
 
All reported serious adverse events potentially associated with study drug s will be carefully 
examined with respect to the severity and relationship to the study drug s.  Adverse events will be 
graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Crite ria for Adverse Events Version 4 .0.   
 
5.8. Selection of Promising Approaches  
 
The objective of the Phase II trial is to identify promising agents to be tested on a Phase III 
setting.  Determination of whether a tre atment is promising relative to control is based on 
identifying a significant effect relative to control on the primary endpoint  using a 5% one -sided 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
5-10 significance level , and not on secondary analyses.  Among those identified as promising relative 
to contro l using this criterion, the actual  selection of promising agents for future study may also 
consider toxicities, secondary endpoints, and the magnitude of effect on  the primary end point 
compared to the control cohort.  Note that m ore than one approach migh t be identified as 
promising relative to control on the primary endpoint  and be selected for further study.

2. Study Background  
The National Institutes  of Health (NIH), th rough the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical 
Trials Network (BMT CTN), are providing staff support an d mon ey for this research study . The 
BMT CTN and the NIH will make decisions about how to manage the study.  
 
A stem cell transplant  is a standard therapy for blood cancers such as acute and chronic 
leukemias, lymphoma and myelodysplastic disorders.  A common p roblem that may occur after a 
stem cell transplant is a condition know n as GVHD .  The word “graft” refers to the donor blood 
cells that you will receive during your transplant.  The word “host” refers to the person (in this 
case, you) receiving the cells.  GVHD is a complication where the donor graft attacks and 
damages some of your (the transplant recipient's) tissues.   
• GVHD can cause skin rash, intestinal problems such as nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea,   
• It may also damage your liver and cause hepatitis or jaundice.   
• GVHD may also increase your risks of infection.  
 
 
3. Study Purpose  
We are inviting you to take part in this study because you have a cancer of the blood or lymph 
glands and a stem cell transplant is a treatment option.  
The purpose of this study is to compare three combinations of medications to see whether one or 
more of them are  better than the current standard of care (Tacrolimus/Methotrexate)  to prevent  
GVHD. These combinations of medication in this study are:  
Treatme nt Group A: Tacrolimus, methotrexate and bortezomib  
Treatment Group B: Tacrolimus, methotrexate and maraviroc  
Treatment Group C: Tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
B-4 Doctors want to know which combination (A, B or C) is better, or if they  give the same results. 
The current standard of care for preventing GVHD is Tacrolimus/Methotrexate . This 
combination is not available on this study. The study will help doctors make choices about 
medications to prevent GVHD for future transplant patients.  
 
 
4. Right to Ask Questions and/or Withdraw  
You have the right to ask questions about the study at any time.   If you have questions about 
your rights as a participant or you want to leave the study, please contact:  
[insert contact info ] 
Being in this study is voluntary. You can choose not to be in this study or leave this study at any 
time. If you choose not to take part or leave this study, it will not affect your regular medical care 
in any way.  
 
Your study doctor and study staff will be available to answ er any questions that you may have 
about taking part in or leaving this study.  
 
 
5. Study Treatment and Tests  
We will check your health before you start treatment, while you receive treatment, and for one 
year after transplant .   
 
Before You Begin the Study  
Before you begin  the study, you will need to have several exams, tests or procedures to find out 
if you can be in the study. All patients participating in this study need to have a matched donor. 
These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer  care and may be done even if you do 
not join the study. These include:  
• Medical history  
• Physical examination,  including height and weight  
• Blood and urine tests  
• Heart function tests, including EKG and ejection fraction  
• Lung (pulmonary) function tests  
• Tests to evaluate your cancer, including a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy  if you have acute 
leukemia, chronic myelogenous leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome, and imaging 
studies if you have lymphoma.   
• Chest X -ray or chest CT  
• A pregnancy test if you are a woman a ble to have children. If you are pregnant, you will 
not be able to take part in this study.

Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
B-5 • Optional  blood samples for future research (see Section 19: Blood Samples for Future 
Research).  
 
Study Participation  
If you decide to join the study, your participation will last for 1 year  after your transplant. We 
will ask you to sign this Consent Form and you will get a copy of the signed form to keep.   
 
Before the Transplant  
Before your transplant, your doctor will choose from one of several conditioning  regimens.  The 
conditioning regimen prepares your body for transplant.  It uses treatments such as chemotherapy 
and radiation to destroy the cancer cells and the cells that make up your immune system.  Your 
doctor will decide which conditioning regimen yo u will receive before you are assigned to one of 
the three (3) treatment groups.  
 
Randomization  
We will use a computer to randomly assign you to 1 of 3 treatment groups. You will have an equal 
chance of being placed in 1 of the 3 groups.  Neither you nor  your doctor or study investigator will 
have any control over which treatment group you will be assigned.  
 
During Your Tr ansplant  
The treatments that are used to prevent GVHD  either start  before or after the infusion of stem cells. 
These treatments are a combination of immune suppressing drugs and a standard component of the 
transplant.  
The 3 treatment groups being included in this study  are outlined below:  
Treatment Group A: Tacrolimus, methotrexate and bortezomib  
• Tacrolimus  will be given  daily  per institutional standards,  as a pill by mouth or by 
intravenous infusion (through your vein), beginning three (3) days before your 
transplant. The amount of drug given will slowly be decreased over time and 
eventually stopped.  This process occurs over several months.  
• Methotrexate  will be given by intravenous infusion (through your vein) on four 
(4) different days (1, 3, 6 and 11) after your transplant.  
• Bortezomib will be given by intravenous push  (3-5 second shot in your vein) on 
three (3) different days (1, 4 and 7) after your transplant.  
Treatment Group B: Tacrolimus, methotrexate and maraviroc group  
• Tacrolimus  will be given  daily per institutional standards,  as a pill by mouth or by 
intravenous  infusion (through your vein), beginning three (3) days before your 
transplant. The amount of drug given will slowly be decreased over time and 
eventually stopped.  This process occurs over several months.  
• Methotrexate  will be given by intravenous infusion  (through your vein) on four 
(4) different days (1, 3, 6 and 11) after your transplant.  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
B-6 • Maraviroc will be given as a pill by mouth twice a day, beginning three (3) days 
before your transplant and will continue for 30 days after your transplant . 
Treatment Group C: Tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and cyclophosphamide 
group  
• Tacrolimus  will be given  daily per institutional standards,  as a pill by mouth or by 
intravenous infusion (through your vein), beginning on day five (5) after your 
transplant. The amount  of drug given will slowly be decreased over time and 
eventually stopped.  This process occurs over several months.  
• Mycophenolate mofetil will be given  daily  by intravenous infusion (through your 
vein)  or as a pill by mouth  three times a day, beginning on Day 5 after your 
transplant, and will continue for 30 days. Your doctor may decide to continue this 
drug if active GVHD is present.  
• Cyclophosphamide will be given by intravenous infusion (through your vein), 
over 1 -2 hours, on Day 3 and Day 4 after your tr ansplant.  
 
Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant  
On your transplant day, the stem cells will be given to you through your catheter, like a blood 
transfusion. The cells will travel to your bone marrow where they will start to make healthy, new 
blood cells after several weeks.  
 
Health Evaluations After the Transplant  
We will test (evaluate) your health during the study. These tests and how often they are 
schedul ed are standard care for patients receiving an allogeneic transplant. They would be done 
even if you were not part of this study. You will be watched closely for any signs and symptoms 
of GVHD.  
• Physical exam to assess toxicities, an d infections weekly until D ay 63 and then at Days  
100, 120, 150, 180, 270 and 365.  
• Physical exam to assess GVHD weekly starting Day 7 until Day 63 and then at Days 100, 
120, 150, 180, 270 and 365.  
• Routine blood tests (cell counts, liver and kidney function) weekly until Day 6 3 and then 
at Days 100, 180, 270 and 365.  
• Blood or bone marrow tests to find the amount of donor cells in your body on Days  28 
and 100.  This is also called chimerism.  
• Disease evaluation  tests to see how much cancer you have after tre atment on Day s 100, 
180 and 365.  
• Lung (pulmonary) function tests on Day 365.  
• Optional  blood samples for future research  on Days 35 , 100, 180 and 365  (see Section 
19: Blood Samples for Future Research) .

B-7 6. Risks and Discomforts  
You will have side effects while on the study.  Side effect s can range from mild to serious.  
The risks and discomforts of participating in this study will be similar to what you may have 
with stem cell transplant if you do not participate in this study , but you might do better or worse 
than on standard transplant treatment .  Your health care team may give you medicines to help 
lessen  side effects  such as feeling sick to your stomach (nausea) .  In some cases, side effects can 
be long lasting or may never go away.  
Risks  and Toxicities  Related to Medicatio ns  
All immune suppressive drugs, except for bortezomib and maraviroc, are commonly used in 
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation.  
 
Table 1 - Risks and Side Effects  
Likely  What it means: This type of side effect is expected to occur in more than 
20% of patients. This means that 21 or more patients out of 100 might get 
this side effect.  
Less Likel y What it means: This type of side effect is expected to occur in 20% of 
patients or fewer. This means that 20 patients or fewer out of 100 might get 
this side effect.  
Rare , but 
Serious  What it means: This type of side effect does not occur very often – in fewer 
than 2% of patients – but is serious when it occurs. This means that 1 or 2 
patients (or fewer) out of 100 might get this side effect.

It is very important that you do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice  while taking 
Tacrolimus .  Grapefruit has an ingredient called bergamottin, which can affect some of the 
treatment drugs used in this study.  Common so ft drinks that have bergamottin are Fresca , 
Squirt , and Sunny  Delight .  
 
Risks and Toxicities Related to Transplant  
The following problems may occur as a result of stem cell  transplant ation . These risks may occur 
whether a transplant was done as part of th e study or not:  
Slow recovery of blood counts.  The red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets can be slow 
to recover after blood or marrow transplant. Until your blood counts recover, you will need 
blood and platelet transfusions, and will be at ri sk for bleeding and infections. To speed the 
recovery of the white cells as much as possible you may receive Filgrastim.   
Graft failure. The stem cells (the “graft”) may fail to grow inside your body. Past experience 
suggests that there can be up to a 10-15% chance of graft failure. If graft failure occurs, this may 
result in low blood counts for a long period of time. If your counts do not recover, you may need to 
receive a second transplant. Graft failure can be fatal.  
Graft -Versus -Host Disease (GVHD) . GVHD results from cells in the graft recognizing your body 
as foreign and attacking it. In most cases, GVHD can be successfully treated. Sometimes GVHD is 
severe or difficult to treat and may lead to death. You will be watched closely for this complicati on 
and given drugs to prevent and/or treat it.  
Acute GVHD may produce skin rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, abnormalities of 
liver function, and an increased risk of infection. Chronic GVHD may produce skin rashes, hair 
loss, thickened dr y skin, dry eyes, dry mouth, liver disease, weight loss, diarrhea, and an increased 
risk of infection. To confirm the diagnosis of acute  or chronic GVHD, you may be asked to have a 
biopsy (a small sample of your tissue to look at under the microscope) of y our skin, gut, or, rarely, 
your liver.

Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
B-13 Other complications. Other complications may include:  
a. Damage to the vital organs in your body. The transplant could cause problems in any body 
organ such as the heart, lungs, liver, gut, kidneys and bladder, or brain . The kidneys and the 
liver are most likely to be damaged. Some patients will experience serious lung problems from 
infections or the chemotherapy and radiation.  
b. Serious infections. Full and complete recovery of your immune system may take many months.  
During this time, there is an increased risk of infections.  You will be prescribed certain drugs to 
reduce the chance of those infections. However,  these treatments do not always work. If you 
have an infection, you may have to stay in the hospital longer or  be re -hospitalized after 
transplant. Although most infections can be successfully treated, some infections may result in 
death.  
c. Relapse of disease or a new blood cancer. Your leukemia or lymphoma may come back even 
if the transplant is initially successf ul. In rare cases, a new blood cancer may develop from the 
donor cells. Cyclophosphamide can cause damage to blood cells, which may result in a blood 
cancer such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The 
blood cancer usually de velops 2 -10 years after treatment, or 6 years on average. The  risk of 
developing a new blood cancer after allogeneic blood or marrow transplant is probably less 
than 2%. If cancer develops in your donor’s blood cells, you may require additional treatment 
with chemotherapy or another blood or marrow transplant.  
d. Risk to the unborn. The treatments in this study have not been proven to be safe at any stage of 
pregnancy. Therefore, if you are pregnant or nursing, you are not eligible for this study. Women 
who can become pregnant must use effective birth control while receiving chemotherapy, TBI, 
and drugs to prevent GVHD , and for 1 year after transplant . Effective birth control is defined as 
the following:  
1. Refraining from all acts of vaginal sex (abstinence)  
2. Consistent use of birth control pills  
3. Injectable birth control methods (Depo -Provera, Norplant)  
4. Tubal st erilization or male partner who has undergone a vasectomy  
5. Placement of an IUD (intrauterine device)  
6. Use of a diaphragm with contraceptive jelly and/or condoms with contraceptive foam 
every time you have sex.

Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
B-14 Reproductive Risks   
The drugs used in thi s research study may  damage your reproductive organs,  affect your ability to 
have children  or possibly cause birth defects if you take them while you are pregnant. I t is 
important that a woman is  not pregnant or breast -feeding and do es not become pregnant d uring 
the course of the study.   
It is important that both women  who can become pregnant and their male partners  use 
birth control for  
1 year after transplantation  while on this study . 
If you are a woman and can become pregnant , you will need to take a pre gnancy test before you 
start the study . You should discuss ways to prevent pregnancy while you are in the study.  
Women who have gone through puberty may find that their menstrual cycle becomes irregular or 
stops permanently. This does not mean that you can not become pregnant. You must still use an 
effective method of birth control during your transplant and continue until you are finished with 
your GVHD prevention treatment.  
If you are a man, your body may not be able to produce sperm (become sterile). You should talk 
with your doctor about banking your sperm before having a transplant.  
Please check with your doctor to understand more about these risks.  
Additional Information about Bortezomib (Velcade®) 
▪ The effect of Velcade® on reproduction and its safety in pregnancy are unknown. If you 
are a woman capable of becoming pregnant [anyone who has not undergone a 
hysterectomy (removal of the womb), has not had both ovaries removed or has not been 
post-menopausal (stopped menstrual periods) for more than 24 mont hs in a row], you 
must have a negative pregnancy test before beginning treatment. In addition, you must 
not be breastfeeding a baby during this study.  
▪ If you think that you have become pregnant or may have fathered a child while taking 
part in this study y ou must tell the study doctor immediately. The study doctor will advise 
you of the possible risks to your unborn baby and discuss options for managing the 
pregnancy with you. You should also notify the doctor managing your pregnancy that the 
mother/father received a study drug called Velcade®. 
▪ If you are a woman and you become pregnant during your participation in this study, 
your treatment with Velcade® will be stopped and you may be withdrawn from some of 
the study procedures but not from follow -up by you r study doctor. The study doctor will 
ask for your permission to stay in contact with you throughout the length of the 
pregnancy.  
▪ If you are a man and your partner becomes pregnant, the study doctor will ask for your 
partner’s permission to collect informa tion about her pregnancy and the health of the 
baby.  
▪ Laboratory tests show that Velcade® may damage DNA. Based on this information, it is 
possible that Velcade® may cause infertility in men and women.  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
B-15 Additional Information about MMF  
▪ MMF could be damaging to an unborn baby if you are pregnant or become pregnant 
while receiving the drug.  
▪ MMF can make birth control pills less effective and increase your chances of becoming 
pregnant while you are taking it.  
▪ If you could become pregnant, you must use 2 effecti ve forms of birth control for 4 
weeks before  starting MMF, during treatment, and for one year after transplantation . 
If you think you might be pregnant or could be become pregnant prior to enrollment, you should 
not join this study.  
Unforeseen Risks  
New risks might appear at any time during the study . These risks might be different from what is 
listed in this Consent Form. We will promptly tell you about  new information that may affect 
your decision to take part in the study . We may learn new things about  reduced -intensity 
transplants that might make you want to stop being in the study. We will let you know if this 
happens and you can decide if you want to continue in the study .  
Other Treatments or Medications  
Some medicines react with each other, and it is important that you tell the study doctor or staff 
about any other drugs, treatments, or medicines you are taking.  This includes non -prescription 
medications, vitamins and herbal treatments.  
It is also important that you tell the study staff about any changes to these medications during 
your participation in the study.  
For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.  
 
 
7. Alternative Treatments  
Participation in this study is optional. If you choose not to take part, you may stil l receive an 
allogeneic transplant to treat your disease.  The treatment and evaluations you would receive 
could be very similar to what would receive if you join this study.  
Your study doctor will talk with you about your options. If you decide not to pa rticipate in this 
study, your medical care will not be affected in any way.  
Your other choices may include:  
▪ Treatment with other drugs, radiation, or a combination of drugs and  radiation without a 
transplant.  
▪ An allogeneic blood or marrow  transplant that i s not part of the study , or another type of 
transplant  
▪ Participation in another clinical trial , if available (check with your doctor)

18.  Blood Samples for Research ( Optional ) 
This section of the informed consent form is about future research studies that will be done 
using blood samples from people who are taking part in the main study described above.  
You may give small b lood samples for these future research studies if you want to.  You can 
still be a part of the main study even if you say “no” to giving blood samples for future 
research studies.  You can say "yes" or "no" to giving blood samples for future research 
studi es.  Please mark your choice at the end of this section . 
 
We would like to have five (5) small blood samples  for future research.  If you agree, these 
samples will be drawn  before you begin the conditioning regimen for your transplant  (3 
teaspoons or 16 mL) , and  at 4 different times after your transplant: on Days 35 , 100, 180 and 365  
(10 teaspoons or 40 mL each) . These samples will be kept and may be used in research to learn 
more about immune reconstitution, GVHD, cancer and other dis eases.  Usually the blood can be 
drawn from a vein in your arm at the same time as other blood collections. When the samples are 
given to investigators for research, no information about your name, address, phone number or 
other information that will let t he researcher know who you are will be provided.  
 
The samples collected for research purposes will be sent to the BMT CTN  Repository.  The 
samples will be labeled with unique codes that do not contain information that could identify 
you.  A link to this co de does exist.  The link is stored at the Data and Coordinating Center for 
the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN  DCC ).  The staff at the 
Repository where your sample is being stored does not have a link to this code.  Your resear ch 
samples will continue to be stored at the BMT CTN  Repository until they are used up for 
approved research.

B-20  
Genome -Wide Association Studies : 
DNA from your stored blood samples might be used in genome -wide association (GWA) 
studies for a future project  either done or supported by the National Institutes of Health 
(NIH).  Genome -wide association studies are a way for scientists to find genes that have a 
role in human disease  or treatment . Each study can look at hundreds of thousands of genetic 
changes at t he same time.  
 
  If your coded samples are  used in such a study, the researcher is required to add your test 
results and sample information  into a public research database.  This public database is called 
the NIH Genotype and Phenotype Database and it is managed by the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI).  The NCBI will never have any information that would 
identify you, or link you to your information or research samples , although the results of 
genetic studies could theoretically include  identifying information about you .  
 
Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act:  
A new federal law (2009), called the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA), 
generally makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and employers of 
15 or more persons to discriminate against you based on your genetic information.  Health 
insurance companies and group health plans may not request your genetic information that we 
get from this research.  This means that they must not use yo ur genetic information when making 
decisions regarding insurability.  Be aware that this new federal law will not protect you against 
genetic discrimination by companies that sell life insurance, disability insurance, or long -term 
care insurance.  
 
Things t o Think About:  
• The choice to let us have blood samples for future research is up to you.  No matter what 
you decide to do, it will not affect your care.  
 
• If you decide now that your blood can be kept for research, you can change your mind at 
any time.  J ust contact your study doctor and let him or her know that you do not want us 
to use your blood sample.  Then any blood that remains will no longer be used for 
research.  
 
• In the future, people who do research on these blood samples may need to know more 
about your health.  While the study doctor or others involved in running this study may 
give the researchers reports about your health, it will not give them your name, address, 
phone number, or any other information that will let the researchers know who y ou are.  
 
• Sometimes blood is used for genetic research (about diseases that are passed on in 
families).  Even if your blood is used for this kind of research, the results will not be put 
in your health records.  
 
• Your blood will be used only for research a nd will not be sold.  The research done with 
your blood may help to develop new products in the future.

B-21  
• Reports about research done with your blood will not be given to you or your doctor.  
These reports will not be put in your health record.  The resear ch will not have an effect 
on your care.  
 
Benefits:  
The research that may be done with your blood is not designed specifically to help you.  The 
benefits of research using blood include learning more about what causes GVHD, cancer and 
other diseases, how to prevent them, and how to treat them.  
 
Risks:  
There is a small risk of an infection or fainting from the blood draw.   
 
The greatest risk to you is the release of information from your health records.  We will do our 
best to make sure that your personal information will be kept private.  The chance that this 
information will be given to someone else is very small.  
 
Making Your Choice:

DERIVATION OF A SEQUENTIAL TEST STATISTIC FOR CENSORED 
EXPONENTIAL DATA  
 
 
Background – The Sequential Probability Ratio Test  
 
Let 
)(.,f be the density function for random variable X.  According to Neyman  and Pearson, 
the most powerful test of 
o H:0  versus
1 1: H  decides in favor of 
1H  or 
0H if 
c Ln  
or 
c Ln , respectively, where 
n
ii i n xf xf L );(/);(0 1  is the likelihood ratio, and 
c is 
determined to have the size 
 .  When the sample size is not fixed in advance, further 
improvement is possible by using Wald’s Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT).  The SPRT 
continues to sample as long as 
A LBn  for some constant 
A B1 , stops sampling and 
decides in favor of 
1H as soon as 
A Ln , and stops sampling and decides in favor of 
0H as soon 
as 
B Ln . 
 
The usual measures of performance of such a procedure are the error probabilities 
 and
 of 
rejecting 
0H when 
0 , and of accepting 
0H when 
1 , respectively, and the expected 
sample size 
)( )|( NE NEj j .  Wald and Wolfowitz showed that among all tests, sequential or 
not, for which 
) reject (Pr0 0 H  and 
) reject (Pr0 1 H , and for which 
)(NEj  are finite, 
j=0,1, the SPRT with error probabilities 
  and 
 minimizes 
)(0NE  and 
)(1NE .  If, in 
addition, the

),(xf
, with monotone likelihood ratio in 
)(x , then any SPRT for testing 
0 against 
) (0 1  
has non -decreasing power function.  
 
For the SPRT with error probabilities 
 and
 , the SPRT boundaries are given approximately 
by 
/) 1(A  and 
) 1/(B .  The operating characteristics of the SPRT are given by

E-3 Derivation of the SPRT for Uncensored Exponential Survival Times  
 
For example, we wish to construct a sequential test for the composite null hypothesis that the rate 
of TRM at 180 days is less than or equal to 5% versus the alternative hypothesis that it is greater 
than or equal to 5%.  For the derivation of the uncensored SPRT, we will require that the type I 
error of the test be less than 10%, and that the test provide 90% power to reject the null 
hypothesis under a specified alternative that the true rate is 10%.  A maxim um sample size of 
250 patients will be permitted.  
 
Let us assume that the survival times, 
nT TT ,...,,2 1 , are completely observed (uncensored) and are 
i.i.d. with exponential density function 
Te Tf),( .  These assumptions will be relax ed to 
incompletely observed data subsequently.  In the exponential parameterization, a 180 -day 
survival rate of 95% translates into a mean survival of 9.747 years (
0 .1026), and 90% 
translates into a mean survival of 4.746 years (
1 .2107).  
 
The SPRT is derived with reference to a simple null and alternative hypothesis, in this case, 
o H:0
 .1026 versus
1 1: H  = .2107.  However, since the log -likelihood ratio for the 
exponential, 
    n
in
in
ii i i T n xf xf ) ()) log() (log( ),( log);( log0 1 0 1 0 1    , is a 
monotone function of 
n
iiT , the power of the test is non -decreasing in 
 .  Thus the SPRT is a 
one-sided level .10 test of a composite null (
1026. :0o H ) versus a composite alternative (
2107. :1o H
), with power of 
90. 1  at the selected alternative 
1 .2107.  
 
The SPRT can be represented graphically.  The continuation region is bounded by two parallel 
lines with common slope 
  ) log /(log) (0 1 0 1  0.150, and intercepts 
 ) log /(log log0 1 A
3.05 and 
 ) log /(log log0 1 B -3.05 for the lower and upper bounds, respectively.  As each 
individual unit is put on trial and observed to fail, the current sample size, n,  is plotted against 
the cumulative s um of failure times.  When this graph crosses the upper boundary, the null 
hypothesis is rejected.  
 
The maximum sample size of 250 patients requires that the SPRT be truncated.  We choose to 
truncate the SPRT by declaring that if the test has failed to ter minate after 250 patients, that the 
null hypothesis will be accepted.  Since the probability that the untruncated SPRT would reject 
the null at a sample size of 250 is negligible, it makes little difference how the final boundary 
value is selected, and thi s rule is chosen for simplicity.   
 
Derivation of a Modified SPRT for Censored Exponential Data  
 
The assumption of uncensored exponential survival times is flawed.  However, we consider it 
reasonable to assume the hazard for TRM is constant over the first 180 days post -transplant, and 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
E-4 we will restrict our attention to this time interval.  Furthermore, it is not practical to conduct a 
clinical study by putting each ind ividual on trial, and waiting until that individual is observed to 
fail.  We relax our assumptions as follows.  Firstly, each individual’s time on study will be 
computed as time from transplant to failure, or to the 180 day time point, whichever comes firs t.  
Secondly, we will put individuals on trial as soon as they become available, without waiting for 
the previous individual to fail.  
 
Let us consider the impact of relaxing these assumptions one at a time.  In a fixed sample size 
trial with uncensored exp onential failure times, mean survival time is estimated by the sample 
mean of the failure times, or total time on study divided by the number of individuals enrolled.  
When censoring is introduced, the estimate becomes the total time on study divided by th e 
number of observed (non -censored) failures.  This suggests that in an exponential SPRT test 
modified to incorporate censoring, we replace the observed failure times, 
nT TT ,...,,2 1 , with 
censored failures times, 
nx xx ,...,,2 1 , and the cu rrent sample size, 
n , with the number of observed 
failures, 
d .   
 
Now we relax the second assumption, and put individuals on trial as soon as they become 
available, without waiting for the previous individual to fa il.  Assume that three years are 
required for accrual of 250 patients to the study, and that the final analysis takes place 180 days 
after the last patient is entered.  Putting all of this together, we propose a modified truncated 
SPRT, where at any interi m time point, 
s , ranging from 0 to 3 years 180 days, the number of 
observed failures, d(s), is plotted against the sum of observed time on study, 
n
iisX)( .  In 
practice, monitoring will be scheduled monthly after the star t of enrollment to the study.  A 
further modification to the SPRT was to only use the upper boundary for stopping since the 
primary focus of the monitoring is to protect against unacceptable 180 -day TRM rates.  
 
Operating Characteristics of the Modified SPR T Test for Censored Exponential Data  
 
Recall that the uncensored SPRT targeted a drop in TRM -free survival at Day 180 from 95% to 
90%, with type I and II errors of 10% and 10%.  Since only the upper boundary is used for 
monitoring, the continuation region of the test was bounded above by a line with a slope of 0.150 
and intercept of 3.05.  In our example, the sample size is large enough that the reduction in 
power due to truncation of the test is negligible compared to the increase in power because the 
modi fied SPRT, lacking a lower boundary, cannot stop early to “accept” the null hypothesis.  In 
order to maintain type I error, we raise the upper boundary to make it harder to cross.  Under the 
further assumption of uniform accrual over a three year period, a nd monthly interim analyses 
over the course of the study, the operating characteristics of the modified SPRT were obtained 
from a simulation study.  These simulation show that an intercept of 4.02, corresponding to 
setting parameters 
  and 
 to 10% and 10%, result in empirical type I and II error rates of 10% 
and 10%.

Mean # Patients Enrolled  240.8  135.4  
 
While the motivation for this testing procedure is largely heuristic rather than theoretical, the 
simulation results validate the approach.  When the true rate of TRM on or before Day 180 was 
5%, the test crossed the lower boundary in 9484 of 100,000 replications, for an estimated type I 
error rate of 9.5%.  When the true rate of TRM on or before Day 180 was 10%,  the test failed to 
cross the boundary in the in 9742 of 100,000 replications, for an estimated type II error rate of 
9.7%.  In this setting, on average, the boundary will be crossed at 20.2 months.  
 
It is interesting to note that the SPRT derived above for exponential failure times with censoring 
at 180 days, has operating characteristics which are similar to those of a more traditional SPRT, 
derived for binomial variates with success probability equa l to the 180 day failure rate.  Using 
time to failure rather than a simple binary indicator of failure, leads to little improvement in 
power when failure times are censored relatively soon after entry on study.  We speculate that if 
the constant hazard rat e over the first 180 days were high, the exponential test would reject faster 
than the binomial test, but have not conducted simulation studies to demonstrate this.

PRODUCT COMPLAINTS FOR BORTEZOMIB  
 
 
A product complaint is a verbal, written, or electronic expression which implies dissatisfaction 
regarding the identity, strength, purity, quality, or stability of a d rug product.  Individuals who 
identify a potential product complaint situation should immediately contact MedComm Solutions 
(see below) and report the event.  Whenever possible, the associated product should be 
maintained in accordance with the label instr uctions pending further guidance from a Millennium 
quality representative.  
 
A medication error is a preventable event that involves an identifiable patient and that leads to 
inappropriate medication use, which may result in patient harm.  While overdoses a nd 
underdoses constitute medication errors, doses missed inadvertently by a patient do not.  
Individuals who identify a potential medication error situation should immediately contact 
MedComm Solutions (see below) and report the event.  
 
For Product Complaints or Medication Errors,  
call MedComm Solutions at  
1-866-835-2233 (US and International )  
 
Product complaints and medication errors in and of themselves are not AEs.  If a product 
complaint or medication error results in an Unexpected,  Grade 3 -5 Adverse Event, then the 
appropriate forms in AdvantageEDC should be completed (refer to Section 4.7 Adverse Event 
Reporting).

ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
J-2 APPENDIX J  
 
ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING  
 
J.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
 
Adverse event s (AEs) will be collected on calendar -driven forms and event -driven forms  in 
AdvantageEDC.    
 
The calendar -driven forms are those that appear in the AdvantageEDC Forms Grid for each 
enrolle d patient at designated time points (e.g., Day 28 post transplant) throughout the course of 
the study. Completion of a calendar -driven form is expected by the Target Date for the given 
assessment period.  
 
Calendar -driven forms for the BMT CTN 1203 study are as follows:   
• Toxicity Form : this form documents all expected toxicities for the BMT CTN 1203 
study; each toxicity is also assigned a grade, based on the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0.  
• Hematology/Chemistry Form : this form documents selected hematology 
(CBC/differential) and blood chemistry results.  
• Follow -Up Status Form : this form documents the status of each patient at various 
intervals on the study.  
 
Event -driven forms  must be completed when a certain event tri ggers the appearance of the form 
in the AdvantageEDC Forms Grid. Most often the event -driven form is triggered by information 
entered on the Follow -up Status Form. Event -driven forms for the BMT CTN 1203 study are as 
follows:  
• Re-Admission/Hospitalization F orm: this form documents all hospital admissions, 
including  the admission for transplant for this study.  
• Infection Form : this form documents infections from the Day 0 (date of transplant) 
through the 1 -year post -transplant follow -up period.  
• Secondary Gra ft Failure Form : this form captures the details associated with secondary 
graft failure. DO NOT report secondary graft failure as an Unexpected, Grade 3 -5 
Adverse Event.  
• Progression/Relapse Form : the form captures detailed information associated with 
progr ession or relapse of the primary disease. DO NOT report progression or relapse as 
an Unexpected, Grade 3 -5 Adverse Event.  
• Death Form : this form documents the death of a patient from the time of study 
enrollment and randomization through the 1 -year post -transplant follow -up period.  
• Bortezomib SAE Screening Form : this form captures basic information on all SAEs 
only for patients randomized to the bortezomib arm from the first dose of bortezomib 
through 30 days after the last dose.  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
J-3 • Adverse Event Forms : this s eries of forms captures details on adverse events that are 
both unexpected and grades 3 -5, based on the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0, regardless of 
attribution to any of the study interventions. These forms are also used to collect 
information on any SAE event required by the additional adverse event reporting 
requirements. These events will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor at the BMT CTN 
Data and Coordinating Center (DCC) within 2 business days of receiving the summary of 
the adverse event from the transplant center. If the Medical Monitor requires additional 
information t o make his/her assessment, the transplant center will have 4 business days to 
respond to the request for additional information.  
 
J.2 Reporting Expected Toxicities  
 
Expected toxicities for all patients enrolled on BMT CTN 1302 will be collected on the BMT 
CTN 1203 Calendar -Driven Toxicity Form.  
 
J.3 Reporting Unexpected, Grade 3 -5 Adverse Events  
 
All Unexpected, Grade 3 -5 Adverse Events should be reported for every patient enrolled on 
the study from the time of enrollment until 1 years post transplant . Add itional Adverse 
Event reporting applies to patients dependent on the treatment received on the study. 
Determination of the expectedness of adverse events should be differentiated between the arms 
at the discretion of the investigator. For example, sweat gl and disturbances would be an expected 
risk associated with maraviroc , but the investigator should assess the expectedness for a patient 
experiencing sweat gland disturbances randomized to the bortezomib arm.  
 
 
J.4 Additional Reporting Requirements for Patients Randomized to the Tacrolimus/  
Methotrexate/Bortezomib from the 1st dose of Bortezomib thr ough 30 Days A fter the 
Last Dose.  
 
This section outlines the adverse event reporting requirements for all patients randomized to the 
Tacrolimus/Methotrexate/ Bortezomib from the first dose  
 
Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (MPI) is supplying bortezomib for all patients who are 
randomized to receive tacrolimus/methotrexate/bortezomib as GVHD prophylaxis on this study. 
MPI has adverse event reporting requirement s for all patients who receive study bortezomib.  
 
In addition to the standard BMT CTN guidelines for reporting adverse events  (see Chapter 
4, Section 4.7 ), MPI is requiring the reporting of all Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) that occur 
after the initial dose  of study bortezomib (Day +1), during treatment , and within 30 days of 
the last dose  of study bortezomib (Day +7 plus 30 days).  This includes events meeting the 
definition of a Serious Adverse Event, per 21 CFR 312.32, as follows:  
 
Serious Adverse Eve nt: A serious adverse event (SAE) is any adverse event that results in one 
of the following outcomes, regardless of causality  and expectedness :  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
J-4 • Results in death  
• Is life -threatening . Life -threatening means that the person was at immediate risk of 
death fro m the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it does not include a reaction which 
hypothetically might have caused death had it occurred in a more severe form.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization  (i.e., the event required at least a 24 -
hour hospitalizat ion or prolonged a hospitalization beyond the expected length of stay). 
Hospitalization admissions and/or surgical operations scheduled to occur during the 
study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs if the illness or 
disease exi sted before the person was enrolled in the trial, provided that it did not 
deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., surgery performed earlier 
than planned).  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity . Disability is define d as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions.  
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect ; or 
• Is an important medical event  when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, it 
may jeopardize the participant and require med ical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed above. Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in in patient hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expected reporting is also 
appropriate in situations other than those listed above.  For example, important medical events may 
not be immediately life threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in the definition above (eg, 
suspected tran smission of an infectious agent by a medicinal product is considered a Serious 
Adverse Event). Any e vent is considered a Serious Adverse Event if it is associated with clinical 
signs or symptoms judged by the investigator to have a significant clinical imp act. 
 
J.4.1 Reporting Timelines for Events Occuring During Bortezomib Reporting Period  
 
• Fatal and Life -Threatening  events must be reported in AdvantageEDC within 24 hours, 
of the investigator’s observation or awareness of the event.  
• All Other Serious  events (non -fatal/non -life-threatening) must be reported in 
AdvantageEDC within 3 calendar days of the investigator’s observation or awareness of 
the event.  
 
J.4.2 How to Report Serious Adverse Events During Bortezomib Reporting Period  
 
All SAEs from the first dose of bortezomib through 30 days after the last dose will be reported in 
AdvantageEDC by completing the Bortezomib SAE Screening Form. .  All SAEs also require 
completion of the Adverse Event Forms (AE1 -AE6), unless any of the following SAEs are 
determined to be unrelated or unlikely related to the bortezomib, then the Adverse Event Forms 
are not required:  
 
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
J-5 • Neutropenia  
• Thrombocytopenia  
• Anemia  
• Minor bleeding episodes (i.e. epistaxis)  
• Graft -versus -host disease (GVHD)  
• Graft failure  
• Hepatic veno -occlusiv e disease (VOD)  
• Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)  
 
Accurate completion of the Bortezomib SAE and/or Adverse Event forms will allow the DCC to 
provide MPI with the details they require to fully understand each event, so it is critical  that all 
fields are fi lled in and comprehensive supporting source documents for the event (PHI redacted) 
are uploaded to the appropriate forms.  
 
If an adverse event does not meet the criteria of an SAE, it will require reporting on the Adverse 
Event form if it is both unexpecte d and grade 3 -5 based on the BMT CTN standard reporting 
guidelines.  
 
J.4.3 Frequently Asked Questions  
 
Below are some examples of anticipated questions with regard to the reporting requirements 
detailed above. These questions do not cover all possible scenarios, therefore it is important to 
contact the BMT CTN Adverse Event or 1203 Protocol Coordinator shou ld there be any 
questions or concerns regarding the reporting of an event and whether the event meets the MPI 
reporting requirements.  
• Since hospitalization is considered an SAE, should the patient’s admission for 
transplant be reported as an SAE?   NO. Admi ssions that are scheduled to occur during 
the study period, bu planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs given the 
disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial and provided that it did not 
deteriorate in an unexpected manner durin g the trial. The SAE reporting requirements 
also begin with the first dose of study drug (bortezomib on Day +1) , so the  admission for 
transplant will occur before this reporting begins.  Among patients who undergo the 
transplant procedure as outpatients and  have scheduled hospitalization at time they 
become neutropenic in the absence of fever, an SAE report is not required , unless the 
neutropenia prolongs the scheduled hospitalization .    
• Is neutropenia  and/or thrombocytopenia associated with the preparative  regimen 
and experienced during the transplant  admission  considered a life -threatening 
event?  NO. Pancytopenias associated with transplant are not considered life -threatening 
events for the purposes of these reporting requirements.  If patients are discharg ed after 
the transplant, followed as outpatients, and then re -hospitalized for neutropenic fever  
prior to day 37, SAE reporting will be required.  
• During the transplant admission a patient becomes critically ill (e.g., pneumonia 
requiring intubation). Does  this event need to be reported as an SAE?  YES. Even 
though the patient is already hospitalized, this is a life -threatening event that required 
intervention and likely prolonged hospitalization.  
BMT CLINICAL TRIALS NETWORK  GVHD Prophylaxis Protocol – 1203  
Version 3.0 dated July 17, 2015  
 
 
J-6 • A patient is discharged  from the hospital post -transplant on Day +32, and is then re -
admitted 2 days later  for diarrhea and nausea . Should this re -admission be reported 
as an SAE?   Possibly . Even though t he subsequent hospitalization falls within the 
reporting period (Day +7 plus 30 days)  the reason for admission is likely GVHD. If the 
GVHD is determined to be unrelated or unlikely related to the bortezomib, only the 
Bortezomib SAE screening form is required. If the GVHD is determined to be possibly, 
probably or definitely related to borte zomib, then an SAE should be reported on both the 
Bortezomib SAE screening form and the Adverse Event forms. If the work up is negative 
for GVHD of the gastrointestinal tract, then an SAE should be reported.  
• A patient is discharged from the hospital post -transplant, and is then re -admitted 
for nausea, vomiting and diarrhea  on Day +40. Should this hospitalization be 
reported as an SAE?   It is not required  that this event be reported as an SAE since the 
admission occurred outside of the reporting period (Day +7 plus 30 days). However, if 
the investigator has a reason to believe that the event is life -threatening and there is no 
evidence of GVHD,  the event may be reported at the discretion of the investigator.  
 
J.5 Reporting Requirements for Patients Randomized  to Tacrolimus/  
Methotrexate/Bortezomib Beginning 30 days After the Last Dose of Bortezomib  
 
This section outlines the adverse event reporting requirements for all patients beginning 30 days 
after the final dose of bortezomib until 1 year post transplant .

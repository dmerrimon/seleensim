Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 4 STUDY DESIGN Randomized, open label, 2 treatment-arm, 26- week treatment duration, parallel-
group multinational and multicenter study comparing the FRC to GLP-1 receptor 
agonist, with FRC single-arm extension of 26 weeks. 
The randomization (1:1) will be stratified by values of HbA1c at screening (<8%, 
≥8%) (<64 mmol/mol, ≥ 64 mmol/mol) and GLP-1 receptor agonist subtype 
(once/twice daily formulations, once weekly formulations). 
The study will comprise 4 periods: 
1- An up-to 2-week screening period; 2- A 26-week open-label randomized treat ment period: at V3, patients will be 
randomized to either receive the FRC plus metformin ± pioglitazone ± SGLT2 
inhibitors or to continue on GLP-1 receptor agonist plus metformin ± 
pioglitazone ± SGLT2 inhibitors;  
3- A 26-week single-arm extension period 
• For patients treated with the FRC  during the randomized period:
After the end of the randomized treatment period (Week 26) patients
will continue to use the FRC during the next  26 weeks of theextension period. Patients on re scue therapy during the randomized
period and still having their HbA1c >8% at Week 22 will not be invitedto participate in the extension period.
• For patients treated with GLP1-RA during the randomized period:Patients will not be invited to participate in the extension period and
will be prescribed the most appropriate antidiabetic treatment at the
Investigator’s discretion.
4- A post-treatment follow-up period: 
• Patients who will not participate in the extension period will perform
the safety follow up visit 3 days after Week 26, except those who
prematurely and permanently discont inued investigational medicinal
product (IMP) administration during the randomized treatment period
but continued in the study up to the scheduled date of study
completion. Patients receiving weekly GLP-1 RAs will perform the
safety follow-up 9 days after Week 26.
• Patients who will participate in the extension period will perform the
safety follow up visit 3 days after Week 52, except those who
prematurely and permanently discont inue IMP administration during
the extension period but continued in the study up to the scheduled
date of study completion.

Investigational medicinal product(s) 
Formulation: Test drug 
Insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio co mbination (FRC): FRC is supplied as a 
sterile aqueous solution in a pre-filled disposable SoloStar® pen-injector (100 
U/mL insulin glargine with 33 or 50 µ g/mL lixisenatide depending on the pen). 
Pen-injector devices 
The combination product will be self-administered with a pre-filled disposable 
SoloStar® pen-injector. 
The dose of the combination is titrated according to the patient’s need for 
insulin. Note that only the dose of insulin glargine appears in the pen dosing 
window. The dose ( µg) of lixisenatide does not appear in the dose window even 
though lixisenatide is pre-mixed in the cartridge. The lixisenatide dose is increased or decreased along with insulin glargine dose changes and also 
depends on which Pen (peach or olive) is used. 
There are two pens (peach and olive) with different insulin glargine/lixisenatide 
fixed ratios which allow insulin glargine titration from 10 to 60 U while limiting 
lixisenatide dose to a maximum of 20 µg/day: 
Peach Pen: pre-filled disposable SoloStar® pen-injector containing 3 mL of 
sterile solution of 100 U/mL insulin glargine and 50 µg/mL lixisenatide in ratio of 
2:1 (2 units of insulin glargine per 1 µg lixisenatide), glycerol , methionine, 
meta-cresol, zinc , HCl/NaOH and water for injection. This pen allows 
administration of daily combination doses between 10 U/5 µg and 40 U/20 µ g;

*If available at country level
Route(s) of administration: Subcutaneous for Investigational medicinal product (IMP)  
Dose regimen: Insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination (FRC) Injection time 
FRC: should be self-administered once daily in the morning in the hour (0 to 
60 minutes) before breakfast. 
Starting dose 
FRC: treatment will be initiated with the Peach Pen. The initial daily dose of FRC 
to be administered will be 10 U: this corresponds to an initial associated dose of 
10 U of insulin glargine and lixisenatide of 5 µg according to the 2 U/1 µg fixed 
ratio used in the Peach Pen. 
Dose adjustment 
During the first 8 weeks of treatment, fr om V3 (Week 0) to V19 (Week 8), the 
dose will be titrated twice a week as far as possible (see below algorithm in 
Table 1.) based on the insulin glargine dose, until the patient reaches a target 
fasting SMPG of 80 to 100 mg/dL (4.4 to 5.6 mmol/L) while avoiding 
hypoglycemia episodes. Titration will be done at the scheduled weekly visits 
(V5, V7, V9, V11, V13, V15, V17, V19)  plus at one additional weekly titration 
phone call visit to be scheduled between the weekly visits (V4, V6, V8, V10, 
V12, V14, V16, V18). The additio nal titration phone call visit should be 
scheduled to allow for at least two days in between successive visits (example: 
weekly visits to occur on Mondays and titration phone calls to occur on 
Thursdays or Fridays). In case t he additional phone call is missed during the 
week, the titration should continue as per the originally planned schedule. 
Thereafter from V19 (Week 8) until V28 (Week 26), the dose will be adjusted as 
necessary to maintain this fasting SMPG target, with recommendation to evaluate the dose at least once a week. Twice a week titration can be continued

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 9 if deemed appropriate by the investigator.  
Dose changes are based on the lowest fasting SMPG value from the last 
3 measurements, which may include the value measured on the day of titration, measured by the patient using glucom eters and accessories supplied by the 
sponsor. However, sound clinical judgment is to be exercised during titration and investigators may decide to further titrate if the lowest value 
from the last 3 measurements is between 80 and 100 mg/dL but the two 
other values are well above 100 mg/d L, if they believe that is an 
appropriate intervention in the best interest of the patient.  
Investigators may adjust or stop titrati on, or temporarily reduce dose if they 
believe further titration would be hazardous at that time.
 
The total daily dose will be capped at 60 U. In case a dose >60 U is needed to maintain glucose parameters below t he threshold value defined for rescue 
therapy, the dose should be kept at 60 U and a rescue therapy should be introduced (see section on rescue therapy). 
Patients continuing in the extension per iod will continue with their same dose 
and dose adjustment algorithm as duri ng the randomized treatment period.

Noninvestigational medicinal 
product(s) 
Background therapy  Background therapy: (commercial metform in tablet ± pioglitazone tablet 
± SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin,  
dapagliflozin, empagliflozin)) and rescue 
therapy will be considered as non-investigational medicinal products (NIMP(s)). 
Metformin and pioglitazone (if applicable) and SGLT2 inhibitors (if applicable) 
should be administered according to local product labeling.  
For metformin, it should be at a stable dose of at least 1500 mg/day or maximal 
tolerated dose for at least 3 months prior to screening visit (V1). The dose of 
pioglitazone (if applicable) and SGLT2 inhibi tors (if applicable) should also be 
stable for at least 3 months prior screening visit (V1).  
The doses of metformin and pioglitazone (i f applicable) and SGLT2 inhibitors (if 
applicable) should be continued and shoul d remain stable throughout the study 
unless there is a specific safety issue related to this treatment.  
Noninvestigational medicinal 
product(s) 
Rescue therapy: In case HbA1c is above 8% at Week 12 or later on, the Investigator will receive 
an alert issued by the central labora tory and should ensure that no reasonable 
explanation exists for insufficient glucose control and in particular that there is 
no intercurrent disease which may jeopardi ze glycemic control (eg, infectious 
disease), that the treatments are given at the planned dose and compliance to 
treatment and diet and lifestyle is appropriate. HbA1c assessment should be 
scheduled at next visit (if next visit is a phone call, it should be replaced by an 
unscheduled visit at site) or within 4 weeks. If appropriate corrective action fails 
and if the repeated HbA1c remains above 8%, a rescue therapy should be 
considered according to the Investigator’s judgment. 
For patients in the FRC arm(s): 
• rescue therapy is recommended only if further dose titration is not
possible, ie, the patient is already at the maximum daily dose of
60 units;
• rapid acting insulin (insulin- glulis ine when available) is suggested and
should be started as a single daily administration to be given at themain meal of the day (excluding breakfast).
• basal insulin is not allowed as rescue therapy in the FRC arm.
For patients in the GLP-1 RA arm: 
• suggested rescue therapy is basal insulin at the investigator’sdiscretion.
During the extension period, suggested rescue therapy is rapid acting insulin 
(insulin-glulisine when available) for all patients. 
If the rescue therapy is initiated during the randomized treatment period all 
assessments planned at the end of randomized treatment visit (V28) are to be 
performed before initiating rescue therapy. If the rescue therapy is initiated 
during the extension period all asse ssments planned at the end of extension 
treatment visit (V35) are to be perform ed before initiating the rescue therapy. 
After these assessments are completed and rescue therapy initiated, the patient will remain in the study and continue to administer the study treatment (including

Endpoints of the extension period 
All primary and secondary efficacy, sa fety, PK and other endpoints will be also 
assessed at the end of the extension period (Week 52).  
ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE Visit schedule The schedule of study-related procedures/assessments is detailed in the Study 
Flowchart ( Section  1.2).  
Early termination 
Patients who prematurely and permanent ly discontinue IMP administration 
during the randomized treatment period or  during the extension period for any 
reason should have a visit as soon as possible with the assessments normally 
planned for the last dosing day with the IMP, ie, the "final on-treatment 
assessment”. Afterward, these patients should continue in the study up to the 
scheduled date of study completion. They should be followed up according to 
the study procedures as specified in t he protocol (except for the safety post-
treatment follow-up). 
STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Sample size determination: 
A sample size of 250 patients per group will provide 90% power to detect a difference of 0.4% in the HbA1c change from baseline to Week 26 between the 
FRC and GLP-1 receptor agonist arm. This calculation assumes a common 
standard deviation of 1.1% at the 5% significance level (2-sided) and a common drop-out rate of 20% at 26 weeks. It is based on the intent-To-Treat (ITT) 
analysis and also assumes in the conservative manner that the FRC dropped 
patients will respond as the control patients, ie, no treatment difference between 
FRC dropped patients and the control patients. 
Analysis population: The primary efficacy population will be t he modified Intent-To-Treat (mITT) 
population, which includes all randomized patients who have a baseline 
assessment and at least one post-baseline assessment of any primary or secondary efficacy endpoints, irrespective of compliance with the study protocol 
and procedures. Patients will be analyzed in efficacy analyses by the treatment regimen allocated by interactive response technology (IRT) according to the 
randomization schedule at randomiz ation visit (as randomized). 
The safety analysis will be conducted on the safety population, defined as all randomized patients exposed to at least one dose of investigational medicinal 
product, regardless of the amount of tr eatment administered. Patients will be 
analyzed according to the treatment regimen actually received. 
Primary efficacy endpoint analysis: 
Analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline to Week 26 in 
HbA1c) will be performed using the mITT population, using HbA1c values 
obtained from the scheduled visits duri ng the 26-week randomized treatment 
period, including those obtained after IM P discontinuation or rescue medication 
use.  
The statistical test will be two-sided at the alpha level of 0.05.  The primary analysis method for the pr imary efficacy endpoint will be a mixed-
effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) under the missing at random 
framework. The MMRM model will incl ude the treatment groups, randomization

receptor agonist subtype (once/twice daily formulations, once weekly 
formulations) at screening visit, treatment-by-visit interaction, and world region as fixed-effect factors, and the baseline HbA1c-by-visit interaction as covariate. 
The baseline value is defined as the last available value prior to the first dose 
administration of investigational medicinal  product or the last available value on 
or before the date of randomization if not treated with open-label IMP. The adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 for each treatment group will be estimated in the framework of this model, as well as the between-
group difference and the 95% confidence in terval (CI) for the adjusted mean. 
The MMRM model will be run using Statistica l Analysis System (SAS®) (Version 
9.4 or higher) MIXED procedure (PROC MIXED) with an unstructured 
correlation matrix to model the within-patient errors. Parameters will be 
estimated using the restricted maxi mum likelihood method with the Newton-
Raphson algorithm. Denominator degree of  freedom will be estimated using the 
Kenward-Roger approximation by fitting values from post-randomization scheduled visits in the 26-week randomized treatment period.  This model will 
use only scheduled HbA1c
 measurements. 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, sensitivity analyses will be performed as necessary to explore different methods for handling missing data.  
Secondary efficacy endpoint analysis: 
The continuous secondary efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using a similar 
MMRM method. Differences between treatment groups and CI will be estimated within the framework of MMRM. Categorical efficacy endpoints will be analyzed 
by Cochran Mantel Haenszel method stratified by the randomization strata.  
Other endpoint analysis: Descriptive statistics will be summarized by treatment group. For PK 
parameters, lixisenatide total plasma concentrations will be listed and 
summarized by visit and time window and by anti-lixisenatide antibody status in 
the PK population, using descriptive statis tics by N, geometric mean, coefficient 
of variation, median,  minimum and maximum. 
Descriptive statistics will also be summarized for efficacy endpoints at scheduled visit for FRC group for the whol e study period including the extension 
period. 
Safety analysis: 
Safety analyses will be descriptive, based on the safety population (randomized 
and exposed). They will be performed for the 26 week randomized treatment 
period and for the whole study period in cluding the extension period (for FRC 
group only) as appropriate. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that 
developed or worsened or became serious during the period from the administration of first dose of the study treatments up to 3 days (9 days for the 
weekly GLP1-RA) after the last administration.

a During the screening period and for randomization visit a visit window of ± 3 days is acceptable, taking V1 as reference until the randomization visit (V3). During the treatment period a visit window of ± 3 days is acceptable taking V3 as reference for V5 to V19 (except for additional titration calls for fixed ratio combination treatment ar ms; please refer to footnote e), and a visit window of ± 5 days is acceptable from V20 to 
V35. A visit window of -1 day or + 3 days for the post-treatment follow-up visit is acceptable using the day of V28 and V35 res pectively as reference. For patients receiving weekly GLP1-RA, the post-treatment 
follow-up visit is scheduled 9 days after V28 with the same visit window as for the other patients. If one visit date is change d, the next visit should take place according to the original schedule.  
b Additional phone calls for titration purposes should be scheduled as often as deemed necessary by the Investigator.   
c Post-treatment follow-up visit: This visit can be a phone call visit, or an on-site visit in case of ongoing or new adverse eve nt during the post-treatment period, if necessary. 
d In case of premature permanent IMP discontinuation , patients should have a visit as soon as possible with the assessments normally planned in V28 or V35 for randomized treatment  or extension period, 
respectively (the 2-hour standardized meal test is performed only if the patient receives the IMP on the day of the meal test).  Afterwards, the patients should continue in the study up to the scheduled date of study 
completion. They should be followed up according to the study procedures as specified in the protocol (except for the 3 day saf ety post-treatment follow-up).  In case of rescue therapy,  all assessments planned 
in V28 or V35 for randomized treatment or extension period, respectively should be performed before starting rescue therapy, pa tients then continue the study treatment (including metformin ± pioglitazone± 
SGLT2 inhibitor ), and all visits and assessments should be performed as scheduled. 
e These additional titration phone calls are necessary only in the fixed ratio combination (FRC) arms during the first 8 weeks of  treatment, from V3 (Week 0) to V19 (Week 8). hereafter, from V19 (Week 8) until V28 
(Week 26), the dose w ill be adjusted as necessary to maintain this fasting SMPG target, wi th recommendation to evaluate the dos e at least once a week. Please see Section  8.1.4.1 on dose adjustment. 
f Whenever the patient feels hypoglycemic symptoms, plasma glucose should be measured by the patient (or others, if applicable), if possible. Patients should be instructed to measure plasma glucose levels prior 
to the administration of glucose or carbohydrate intake whenever symptomatic hypoglycemia is suspected, unless safety considerations necessitate immediate glucose/carbohydrate rescue prior to confirmation. 
g The training can be repeated as often as necessary.  
h The 7-point SMPG profile should be measured at the following 7 points: pre-prandial and 2 hours postprandial for breakfast, lun ch, dinner and at bedtime. 
i Any patient treated with a once weekly GLP-1 RA  upon entering the study who is assigned to receive FRC treatment should not receive their first dose until at least 1 week aft er their last dose of GLP-1 RA. For 
these patients baseline visit must be scheduled at least 1 week after administering their last dose of GLP1. 
j At V2 and V28 and V35, FPG and C-peptide are part of the standardized meal test. The standardized meal contains approximately 600 kcal and is composed of 50 to 55% carbohydrate, 15 to 20% protein and 25 to 30% fat. The standardized meal for all patients should be consumed within a 15-minute period.

Study LixiLan-G (EFC13794) will evaluate the effi cacy and safety of the combination of basal 
insulin glargine (Lantus®) and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) 
lixisenatide in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) not sufficiently controlled on oral anti-diabetic drug (OAD) therapy and GLP-1 rece ptor agonist therapy (liraglutide (Victoza®), 
exenatide (Byetta®), exenatide extended-release (Bydureon®), albiglutide (Tanzeum®), and dulaglutide (Trulicity®). 
Lixisenatide (AVE0010, Lyxumia®) is a polypeptide with pronounced glucagon-like peptide 1 
(GLP-1) agonist activity, approved since 2013 in the European Union (EU), Japan, Mexico, and 
other parts of the world for trea tment of adults with T2DM to achieve glycemic control in 
combination with oral glucose-lowering medici nal products and/or basal insulin when these, 
together with diet and exercise, do not provide ade quate glycemic control. In the US it is approved 
since 2016 as Adlyxin®. The indication may vary s lightly across the countries where lixisenatide 
is approved. Other information con cerning lixisenatide is available in the Clinical Investigator’s 
Brochure ( 1) and in the Lyxumia® Summary of  Product Characteristics (SmPC) ( 2) and 
Adlyxin® Prescribing Information (PI) ( 3). 
Insulin glargine (HOE901, Lantus®), an anal ogue of human insulin, provides 24-hour basal 
insulin supply after single dose subcutaneous injection. Lantus® has been marketed since June 2000 in Europe and since April 2000 in the USA and other parts of the world. Lantus® is 
indicated for the treatment of a dult and pediatric patients with T1 DM or adult patients with T2DM 
who require basal (long-acting) insulin for th e control of hyperglycemia. Other information 
concerning insulin glargine is available the Lantus® SmPC ( 4) and Lantus® PI ( 5). 
Since both lixisenatide and insulin glargine are efficacious when given once daily, and have similar physicochemical features such as good solubility at low pH, both components can be 
mixed as a defined fixed ratio formulation to  be delivered  in one single injection.  
Several GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are approved throughout the world. Liraglutide 
(Victoza®) has been marketed since 2009 in Europe  and 2010 in the USA, and is indicated as an 
adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glyce mic control in adults with T2DM. The indication 
may vary slightly across the countries wher e liraglutide is approved. Detailed information 
concerning liraglutide is available in the Victoza® SmPC ( 6) and Victoza® PI ( 7). 
Exenatide (Byetta®) has been initially approved in  Europe in 2006 and in 2005 in the USA, and is 
indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to  improve glycemic control in adults with T2DM. 
The indication may vary slightly across the countries where Byetta® is approved. Detailed 
information concerning Byetta® is available in the Byetta® SmPC ( 8) and Byetta® PI ( 9). The 
extended-release version of Exenatide (Bydureon® ) has been initially approved in Europe in 2011 
and in 2012 in the USA, and is indicated as an ad junct to diet and exerci se to improve glycemic 
control in adults with T2DM. The indication may vary slightly across the countries where 
Bydureon® is approved. Other information concerni ng Bydureon® is available in the Bydureon® 
SmPC ( 10) and Bydureon® PI ( 11).

information concerning Trulicity® is available in the Trulicity® SmPC ( 13) and Trulicity® PI

Metformin is generally considered to be the most appropriate first-line therapy for treating T2DM, but there is no general agreement on how to a dvance treatment when metformin and lifestyle 
modification become insufficient. As additional OAD therapy, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), and in particular pioglitazone, could be used in addition to metformin, among other OAD therapies. Another recently introduced class of OADs, the SG LT2 inhibitors, is steadily becoming a choice 
early in the stepwise advancing to dual and triple combination therapy. The new class of GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs has become increasingly us ed by health care prof essionals and has been 
included as part of both two and three drug therap eutic regimens in the recent American Diabetes 
Association/European association of the study of diabetes (ADA/EASD) treatment algorithm ( 15). 
However as with most type 2 diabetes drugs, GLP-1 RAs may fail after some time, and considering the progressive nature of T2DM, this means that a significant proportion of patients will eventually require an insulin-based combination therapy to attain and sustain glycemic control.  
The combined treatment of a GLP-1 RA with long acting basal insulin has been tested in many 
studies ( 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26). Different study designs have confirmed the 
original findings of Buse et al. ( 20) that the association of these two biological entities is 
advantageous in patients with T2DM ( 27). In addition to improving glycemic control, the 
association of the two can maximize other benefits and at the same time minimize some of the 
limitations of the other. While the studies conduc ted to date are heterogeneous in design, 
generally speaking, the combination promises to increase the number of patients at target with minimal weight gain or even weight loss while maintaining a manageable hypoglycemia profile. Therefore, the combination of basal insulin w ith a GLP-1 receptor agonist may provide an 
improved benefit/risk profile compared with each used individually. 
As basal insulin products target  primarily, although not exclusiv ely, fasting hyperglycemia, and 
are often given once daily, a desirable combinati on would be with a GLP-1 receptor agonist such 
as lixisenatide, which, when given once daily, s till effectively acts on post-prandial glycemia due 
to slowing down gastric emptying even when the ability to restore glucose sensitive insulin 
secretion is exhausted or limited. 
Given all the above, for patients who are not able  to control their type 2 diabetes with OAD 
therapy and a GLP-1 RA, treatment intensification with the insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed 
ratio combination (FRC) as a once daily injecti on by an easy to-use device could represent a 
valuable option in the management of their disease. The basal insulin Lantus® will provide a predictable and timely effect in reducing glycated hemoglobin A
1c (HbA1c), and the GLP-1

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 33 receptor agonist lixisenatide will have additional effect on glycemic control while mitigating body 
weight gain and hypoglycemia that can occur with insulin intensification.  
The safety and efficacy of the FRC ha s been assessed in 2 phase 3 studies: 
• Study EFC12404 (LixiLan-O): A randomized, 30-week, active-cont rolled, open-label, 
3 treatment arm, parallel-group multicenter stud y comparing the efficacy and safety of 
insulin glargine/lixisenatide FRC to insulin glargine alone and to Lixisenatide alone on top 
of metformin in 1170 patients with T2DM not sufficiently controlled on metformin with or without a second oral antidiabetic drug (O AD). The study met its primary objective 
demonstrating statistically superior reduction in HbA1c of the FRC compared with lixisenatide and compared with insulin glargine 100 units/mL. 
Greater reductions in HbA1c from baseline ( 8.1%) were achieved with the FRC compared 
with insulin glargine and lixisenatide ( −1.6%, −1.3%, − 0.9%, respectively), reaching mean 
final HbA1c levels of 6.5% for the FRC, vers us 6.8% and 7.3% for insulin glargine and 
lixisenatide, respectively (both p<0.0001).The FRC allowed more patients to reach HbA1c 
target <7% (74% versus 59% for insulin glargine and 33% for lixisenatide; p<0.0001 for 
all comparison) while preventing the body weight gain usually observed at initiation of an insulin-based therapy, without increasing the hypoglycemia rate compared to insulin glargine alone. The safety profile of the FRC generally reflected those of its components. 
Compared to lixisenatide, the FRC had markedly lower rates of nausea and vomiting, leading to fewer permanent treatment discontinuations. 
• Study EFC12405 (LixiLan-L): A randomized, 30-week, active-cont rolled, open-label, 
2 treatment arm, parallel-group, multicenter study comparing the efficacy and safety of the 
insulin glargine/lixisenatide FRC to insulin glargine with or without metformin, in 736 
patients with T2DM not sufficiently controlled on basal insulin. The study met its primary 
objective demonstrating statistically superior  reduction in HbA1c of the FRC compared 
with insulin glargine 100 units/mL, leading to a value of 6.9% at Week 30 compared to 7.5% with insulin glargine. It allowed more  patients to reach HbA1c target <7% ( 55% 
versus 30% for insulin glargine while preventing or minimizing the body weight gain usually observed at intensification of an insu lin-based therapy with no additional risk of 
hypoglycemia as compared to insulin glargine. Overall, the FRC had a safety profile reflecting those of its components. 
The lixisenatide stand-alone produc t has been developed and approved at a fixed dose of 20 µg 
once daily (QD) in several countries. The dosing of lixisenatide in the FRC ranges from between 
5 to 20 µg.  
In the two phase 3 studies as well as in the LixiLan-G (EFC13794) phase 3b study, the 
combination of insulin glargine and lixisenatide is  provided in two fixed ratio solutions delivered 
by prefilled disposable pen injectors. The dose of the combination is to be titrated according to the 
insulin needs of the patient. These 2 fixed ratios of the components are intended to obtain a good pharmacological effect within established tolerability limits. The lower end of the dosing range of lixisenatide is defined by the minimum dose for efficacy, the upper end by available safety 
database. Data derived fro m studies in T2DM patients and hea lthy subjects demonstrate that doses 
of 5-10 µg lixisenatide could provide sufficient concentrations to stimulate glucose sensitive

demonstrated a potent effect on i nhibition of gastric emptying ( 1). It is expected that the majority 
of the target patient population for the F RC would require 10 to 60 U of Lantus ( 28).  
The following two pens with 2 different strengths of the combination will be used in LixiLan-G 
(EFC13794) study:  
• The FRC 10 to 40 pen (Peach Pen) will deliver a dose from 10 U insulin glargine/5 µg 
lixisenatide to 40 U insulin glargine/20 µg lixisenatide (2 [units] to 1 [µg] ratio). Each unit of the FRC 10 to 40 pen contains 1 unit of in sulin glargine and 0.5 µg of lixisenatide; 
• The FRC 30 to 60 pen (Olive Pen) will deliver a dose from 30 U insulin glargine/10 µg lixisenatide to 60 U insulin glargine/20 µg lixisenatide (3 [units] to 1 [µg] ratio). Each unit of the FRC 30 to 60 pen contains 1 unit of in sulin glargine and 0.33 µg of lixisenatide. 
The LixiLan-G (EFC13794) study will consist of  a randomized comparative 26-week treatment 
period followed by a 26-week single arm extens ion period for patients randomized to the FRC 
group. The primary objective of the study is to demonstrate the superiority of the FRC to GLP-1 
receptor agonist in HbA1c change from base line to Week 26 in patients with T2DM not 
sufficiently controlled on GLP-1 receptor agonist  and metformin ± pioglit azone± SGLT2 inhibitor 
treatments.  
The secondary objectives of the study are to assess  the effects of the FRC versus GLP-1 receptor 
agonist on percentage of patients reaching HbA1c targets, fasting plasma glucose, 7-point Self- 
Monitored Plasma Glucose (SMPG) profile, glycemic control during a standardized meal test and 
body weight. Other parameters will also be assessed: C-peptide during a standardized meal test, 
composite endpoint of percentage  of patients reaching HbA1c target (<7%) with no weight gain,

before and following injection (FRC group). 
Screened patients will enter an up to 2-week sc reening period. Eligible patients whose HbA1c 
level at screening is ≥7 and ≤ 9% will enter a 26-week open la bel randomized treatment period 
comparing the FRC to GLP-1 receptor agonist (Victoza®, Byetta®, Bydureon®, Tanzeum®, or 
Trulicity®). The treatment period duration is c onsidered sufficient to allow an appropriate 
evaluation of the effect on HbA1c, plasma gl ucose levels, body weight and other secondary 
endpoints.  
Patients in the FRC group will star t their treatment with the Peach Pen at a dose of 10 units which 
corresponds to an associated dose of 10 U of insulin glargine and 5 µg of lixisenatide. During the 
first 8 weeks of treatment, the dose will be titrated twice a week as far as possible until the patient 
reaches a glycemic target of fasting SMPG in the range of 80 to 100 mg/dL (4.4 to 5.6 mmol/L) 
while avoiding hypoglycemia. Thereafter, the dose will be adjusted as necessary to maintain this fasting SMPG target, with recommendation to ev aluate the dose at least once a week. Patients 
needing a daily FRC dose of 41 U or more will switch to the Olive Pen. The maximal daily dose in the FRC treatment groups is 60 U, which corresponds to an associated dose of 60 U of insulin glargine and 20 µg of lixisenatide. Daily doses of FRC higher than 60 must not be administrated.

will continue to receive the same dose they receive at study entry.  
The investigational medicinal pr oducts (IMPs) should be adminis tered by deep subcutaneous

section in the tabular summary) for FRC and Vict oza®, twice daily (BID) for Byetta®, or once 
weekly for Bydureon®, Tanzeum®, or Trulicity®. At the end of the randomized treatment period (Week 26) patients treated with the FRC will 
continue to use the FRC during the next 26 week s of the extension peri od. Patients treated with 
the FRC and on rescue therapy during the randomized period and still having their HbA1c >8% at 
Week 26 will not be invited to participate in th e extension period.  The 26-week extension period 
aims to collect safety, immunogenicity, descri ptive efficacy and PK data beyond 26 weeks of 
treatment with the FRC. Indeed, the pivotal studies with the FRC provided data up to 30 weeks of treatment, and with the safety extension for the LixiLan-G study, additional valuable safety and 
efficacy data over one year in patients treated with the fixed ratio combination will be provided with the FRC. 
In the post-marketing experience with GLP-1 rece ptor agonists, spontaneously reported cases of 
pancreatitis raised concerns that drugs in this class could cause pancreatitis. Therefore, patients 
enrolled in this study should be followed for any evidence of suspected pancreatitis, eg, with symptoms and/or signs of acute abdominal distre ss or abnormal levels of  pancreatic enzymes. 
Serum amylase and lipase concentrations are to be monitored routinely at screening, baseline and periodically during the study treatment period. As th is monitoring may be difficult to interpret in 
patients who already have high values of amylase or lipase, patients with values above 3 times the 
upper limit of normal range at screening will not be included in the study. Guidance for 
Investigators on the follow-up of suspected pancrea titis is specified in the protocol. In addition, a 
Pancreatic Safety Assessment Committee (PSAC) has been established. The PSAC is a committee 
of experts in the field of panc reatitis and pancreatic neoplasm, independent from the Sponsor and 
the Investigators, implemented to assess pancreatic events that may occur during the study. 
Information from Victoza® (liraglutide) ( 6, 7), Bydureon® (exenatide-extended release) ( 10, 11), 
Tanzeum® (albiglutide) (, 12), and Trulicity® (dulaglutide) ( 13, 14) pre-clinical carcinogenicity 
studies has raised the issue of a potential incr eased risk of thyroid C-cell hyperplasia and 
neoplasm. Following a request from the health authorities concerning any clinical study longer 
than 3 months with a GLP-1 receptor agonist, serum calcitonin will be monitored in this study as a marker of thyroid C-cell hyperplasia and neoplasm, with specific monitoring implemented for 
patients with value ≥20 pg/mL (5.9 pmol/L). As this monitoring may be difficult to interpret in 
patients who already have high values, those with  calcitonin values equal to or above 20 pg/mL 
(5.9 pmol/L) at screening will not be included in the study. 
Like any other peptide product, there is a potential for antibody generation when treated with the 
FRC. Therefore, assessments of the immunogenicity of insulin glargine and lixisenatide will be performed. Antibodies against insulin glargine ar e well characterized. Therefore, assessment of 
anti-insulin antibodies is limited to antibody titers and cross-reactivity to human insulin. For lixisenatide, the time course of formation of antibodies and antibody concentrations will be

against lixisenatide, GLP-1 and glucagon will be assessed. 
In order to gain information about exposure to lixisenatide, blood samples will be collected to 
determine lixisenatide concentrations. 
Conclusion on the benefit ri sk assessment in this study 
The FRC is the combination of two products with  demonstrated glucose-lowering properties and 
which are approved for the treatment of adult pa tients with T2DM to improve glycemic control 
(insulin glargine was approved in 2000 in Europe and since 2001 in the US as well as many other 
parts of the world, and lixisenatide was appr oved in 2013 in Europe and other countries). 
The type and incidence of adverse events observed in previous lixisenatide clinical studies 
covering daily doses up to 60 µg, and in the F RC phase 2 study ACT12374 with daily doses up to 
60 U of insulin glargine/30 µg of lixisenatide a nd the completed phase 3 program did not reveal 
findings or concerns precluding the continuation of clinical development. Gi ven the safety profile 
observed in completed studies, combined treatment of insulin glargine and lixisenatide in a fixed 
ratio solution is considered we ll tolerated and reflective of th e individual components, with no 
new risk identified for the population to be included in study EFC13794. Therefore, the risk for 
patients participating in this study, using dail y doses up to 60 U of insulin glargine/20 µg of 
lixisenatide is considered limited.  
All patients entering this study will receive treat ment with FRC or GLP-1 receptor agonist both on 
top of OAD therapy (metformin ± pioglitazone ± SG LT2 inhibitors). In addition, all patients will 
benefit from close management of their T2DM. Rescue therapy is planned and described in the 
clinical study protocol for patients w hose glycemia remain s poorly controlled. 
Given the expected improvement of metabolic co ntrol and the additional measures to improve 
diabetes management, these benefits are considered to outweigh the potential risk associated with 
the FRC drug. Therefore the benefit-risk ratio for patients participatin g in study EFC13794 is 
considered favorable.

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 
The study will be an open label, randomize d, active-controlled, 2 treatment-arm, 26-week 
treatment duration, parallel-gr oup, multinational and multicenter phase 3 study comparing the 
FRC to GLP-1 receptor agonist. At the end of  the 26-week randomized period, patients from the 
FRC group will be invited to  participate in a 26-week single arm extension. The study will recruit 
outpatients with T2DM. At the end of the screening period, eligible patients will be randomized to 
one of two treatment groups: 
• FRC group; 
• GLP-1 receptor agonist group. 
The randomization (1:1) will be stratified by values of HbA1c at screening (<8%, ≥8%) 
(<64 mmol/mol, ≥ 64 mmol/mol) and GLP-1 receptor agonist subtype (once/twice daily 
formulations, once week ly formulations).  
The study will comprise 4 periods: 
1. An up-to 2-week screening period; 
- Eligible patients continue their GLP-1 RA (Victoza®, Byetta®, Bydureon®, 
Tanzeum®, or Trulicity®) on top of metformin ± pioglitazone ± SGLT2 inhibitors at 
the same doses/dose regimens as before the screening visit. 
2. A 26-week open-label randomized treatment period;  
- Eligible patients will be randomized at V3  to either receive the FRC on top of 
metformin ± pioglitazone ± SGLT2 inhibitors or to continue on GLP-1 receptor 
agonist on top of metformin ± pioglitazone ± SGLT2 inhibitors. 
3. A 26-week single-arm extension period  
- For patients treated with the FRC during the randomized period; 
After the end of the randomized treatment period (Week 26) patients will continue to 
use the FRC during the next 26 weeks of the extension period. Patients on rescue 
therapy during the randomized period and still having their HbA1c >8% at Week 22 and the patient who discontinued prematurely from treatment before Week 26 will not be invited to participat e in the extension period. 
- For patients treated with GLP1-RA during the randomized period. 
Patients will not be invited to participate in the extension period and will be prescribed 
the most appropriate antidiabetic treatment at the Inve stigator’s discretion.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 39 4. A post-treatment follow-up period:  
Patients who will not participate in the extension period will perform the safety follow up 
Visit 3 days after Week 26 except those w ho prematurely and permanently discontinue 
IMP administration during the randomized treatme nt period but continue in the study up to 
the scheduled date of study completion. Patients receiving weekly GLP-1 RAs will 
perform the safety follow-up 9 days after Week 26. 
Patients who will participate in the extension period will perform the safety follow up visit 
3 days after Week 52 except those who pr ematurely and permanently discontinue IMP 
administration during the extension period but continue in the study up to the scheduled 
date of study completion. 
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient 
The maximum study duration per patient will be approximately 29 weeks for the patients in the 
GLP1-RA arm (2 weeks for the screening period followed by 26 weeks for the randomized 
treatment period and + 3 days post-treatment safety follow up period), and 55 weeks for the 
patients in the FRC arm (including a 26-week extension period) as per description provided in 
Section  6.1. 
6.2.2 Determination of end of clinical trial (all patients) 
The end of the study is defined as Data Base Lo ck (DBL) instead of the usual “last patient last 
visit” as some delay in data integration into the data base after the “last patient last visit” might be anticipated due to the Committees’ reviews. 
6.3 INTERIM ANALYSIS 
No interim analysis is planned for this study. 
The primary analysis of the efficacy and safety wi ll be performed on the data collected during the 
26-week randomized treatment period. The timing of this analysis is when the last randomized 
patient has completed the 26-w eek randomized treatment period. The results of the primary 
analysis will not be used to change the conduct of the ongoing study in any aspect. 
6.4 STUDY COMMITTEES 
6.4.1 Steering Committee 
The Steering Committee is composed of scientists with clinical and methodological expertise in 
diabetes and conduct of clinical trials. This Committee, led by a Chairman, is responsible for 
producing and conducting a scientif ically sound study and for ensuring accurate reporting of the

the study. A detailed charter describes the Steering Committee procedures. 
6.4.2 Allergic Reaction Assessment Committee (ARAC) 
Since lixisenatide, liraglutide, exenatide, albiglutide, and dulaglutide are peptides that may 
potentially generate allergic reactions; an Allergic Reaction Assessment Committee (ARAC) has been set up. The ARAC is a committee of experts in the field of allergy, independent from the Sponsor and the Investigators, implemented to asse ss allergic reactions or allergic-like reactions 
that may occur during the study. The mission of the ARAC will be to adjudicate, in a timely manner, all allergic, or possible allergic events. The ARAC will review the reported cases in a 
blinded manner, and based on the information repo rted by the Investigator, confirm whether or 
not the event is allergic in nature. A deta iled charter describes the ARAC procedures. 
6.4.3 Pancreatic Safety Assessment Committee (PSAC) 
Potential safety signals for acute pancreatitis have been identified in the post-marketing 
experience with other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Specific monitoring for pancreatic events is 
planned in this study (see Section  10.6.4) and a Pancreatic Safety Assessment Committee (PSAC) 
has been set up. This is a committee of experts in the field of pancr eatitis and pancreatic 
neoplasm, independent from the Sponsor and the I nvestigators, implemented  to assess pancreatic 
events that may occur during the study. The PSAC will review selected pancreatic events, including pancreatitis, pancreatic  neoplasms and abnorma l levels of amylase or lipase. This 
review will be conducted in a b linded manner with regard to study treatment. A detailed charter 
describes the PSAC procedures.

8.1.2 Injection devices and training for insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio 
combination 
8.1.2.1 Pen-Injector devices 
The FRC product will be self-admin istered with a pre-filled dispos able SoloStar® pen-injector. 
The dose of the FRC is titrated according to the patient’s need for insulin glargine, while 
respecting the minimum and maximum lixisenatide dose of 5 to 20 µ g/day. Note that only the 
dose of insulin glargine appears in the pen dosing window. The dose ( µg) of lixisenatide does not 
appear in the dose window even though lixisenatide is pre-mixed in the cartridge. The lixisenatide dose is increased or decreased along with the insulin glargine dose changes, and the amount of change depends on which Pen (peach yellow or olive green) is used. 
There are two pens (peach and olive) with different insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratios which 
allow insulin glargine titration from 10 to 60 U while limiting lixisenatide dose to a maximum of 
20 µg/day:  
• Peach Pen:  pre-filled disposable SoloStar® pen injector containing 3 mL of sterile 
solution of 100 U/mL insulin glargine and 50 µg/mL lixisenatide in a ratio of 2:1 (2 units 
of insulin glargine per 1 µg lixisenatide, glycerol , methionine, meta-cresol, zinc 
, HCl/NaOH and water for injection). This pen allows administration of daily 
combination doses between 10 U/5 µ g and 40 U/20 µg in increments of 1 unit; the Peach 
Pen will be the pen used for starting the combination treatment. 
It is theoretically possible to dial less than 10 U (corresponding to less than 10 U insulin glargine), 
or to deliver more than 40 U (corresponding to more than 40 U of insulin glargine) by splitting the 
dose into 2 separate injections (e.g. giving 2 sequential injections of 25 U each). With the Peach 
Pen, no doses below 10 U or above 40 U should be given. All doses should be given as 1 single 
injection and never split into more than 1 injection per day.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 48 Each Peach Pen is specifically labeled for use in  the study and contains in total 300 units of 
insulin glargine and 150 µg of lixisenatide in 3 mL. 
• Olive Pen:  pre-filled disposable SoloStar® pen injector containing 3 mL of sterile 
solution of 100 U/mL insulin glargine and 33 µg/mL lixisenatide in ratio of 3:1 (3 units of 
insulin glargine per 1 µg lixisenatide, glycerol , methionine, meta-cresol, zinc 
, HCl/NaOH and water for injection). This pen allows administration of daily 
combination doses between 30 U/10 µg and 60 U/20 µg in increments of 1 unit (dose 
step). 
It is theoretically possible to dial less than 30 U (corresponding to less than 30 U insulin glargine), 
or to deliver more than 60 U (corresponding to  more than 60 U insulin glargine) by splitting the 
dose into 2 separate injections (e.g. giving 2 se quential injections of 35 U each). With the Olive 
Pen, no doses below 30 U or above 60 U should be given. All doses should be given as 1 single 
injection and never split into more than 1 injection per day. 
Each Olive Pen is specifically labeled for use in the study and contains in total 300 units of insulin 
glargine and 99 µg of lixisenatide in 3 mL. The lixisenatide dose is increased or decreased along with insulin glargine dose and also depends 
on which pen (Peach Pen or Olive Pen) is used. For example, wh en the dose window in the Peach 
Pen (ratio of 2:1) shows 30 U, this is a dose of 30 U of insulin glargine and 15 µg of lixisenatide, 
while for the Olive Pen (ratio of 3:1) when the dose window shows 30 U, this is a dose of 30 U of insulin glargine and 10 µg of lixisenatide.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 52 8.1.4 Starting dose and dose adjustment 
8.1.4.1 Insulin glargine/lixisenatide fixed ratio combination (FRC) group 
Starting dose 
Treatment will be initiated with the Peach Pen. The initial da ily dose of FRC to be administered 
will be 10 U: this corresponds to an initial associat ed dose of 10 U of insulin glargine and 5 µg of 
lixisenatide according to the 2 U/1 µg fixed ratio used in the Peach Pen. 
Patients who are randomized from once weekly fo rmulations of GLP-1 RA to the FRC group 
must not administer the first dose of FRC until at least 1 week after their last dose of once weekly 
GLP-1 RA. 
Dose adjustment 
During the first 8 weeks of treatment, from V3 (Week 0) to V19 (Week 8), the dose will be 
titrated twice a week as far as possible (see below algorithm in Table 1 ) based on the insulin 
glargine dose, until the patient reaches a targ et fasting SMPG of 80 to 100 mg/dL (4.4 to 
5.6 mmol/L) while avoiding hypoglycemia episod es. Titration will be done at the scheduled 
weekly visits (V5, V7, V9, V11, V13, V15, V17, V 19) plus at one additional weekly titration 
phone call visit to be scheduled between the weekly visits (V4, V6, V8, V10, V12, V14, V16, 
V18). The additional titration phone ca ll visit should be scheduled to allow for at least two days in 
between successive visits (example: weekly vis its to occur on Mondays and titration phone calls 
to occur on Thursdays or Fridays). In case the additional phone call is mi ssed during the week, the 
titration should continue as per the originally planned schedule. Thereafter, from V19 (Week 8) until V28 (Week 26), the dose will be adjusted as n ecessary to maintain this  fasting SMPG target, 
with recommendation to evaluate the dose at least once a week. Twice a week titration can be continued if deemed appropr iate by the investigator. 
During the extension period (Week 26 to Week 52) patients treated with the FRC during the 
randomized period will continue their FRC treatment with the same dose regimen and dose 
adjustment algorithm as during the randomized treatment period. 
Dose changes are based on the lowest fasting SMPG value from the last 3 measurements, which 
may include the value measured on the day of titra tion, measured by the patient using glucometers 
and accessories supplied by the sponsor. However, sound clinical judgment is to be exercised 
during titration and inve stigators may decide to further up titrate if the lowest value from 
the last 3 measurements is between 80 a nd 100 mg/dL but the two other values are well 
above 100 mg/dL, if they believe that is an appropri ate intervention in the best interest of 
the patient. 
Investigators may adjust or stop titration, or te mporarily reduce dose if they believe further 
titration would be hazardous at that time.

medically qualified designee 
In the insulin glargine fixed ratio combination group: choice of Peach Pen or Olive Pen  
• If the patient needs a FRC dose of 10 to 40 U, use the Peach Pen (insulin glargine/lixisenatide 2:1).  
• If the patient needs a FRC dose of 41 to 60 U, use the Olive Pen only (insulin glargine /lixisenatide 3:1).  
• Daily doses of FRC higher than 60 U must not be administrated. 
In case additional therapy (eg, a dose >60 U is needed to maintain HbA1c below the predefined 
threshold value (8% at 12 weeks treatment and th ereafter)), the dose should be kept at 60 U and a 
rescue therapy should be introduced (see Section  8.2.3). All assessments planned at the end of 
treatment visit (V28 or V35 for the randomized trea tment or extension period, respectively) are to 
be performed before initiating rescue therapy. 
Patients will be educated regarding the titration schedule so that they will be able to monitor the 
titration with the assistance of the Investigator or medically qualified designee. Patients will be 
allowed to increase the dose by themselves if necessary (ie, if the lowest fasting SMPG value from the preceding 3 measurements, which may include the value measured on the day of 
titration, is >100 mg/dL), but not more than a ma ximum dose increase of +2 U and not more often 
than twice a week. All other dose increases must be discussed between the patient and appropriate 
site personnel. All discussions mu st be properly documented in th e patient’s record. If needed, 
additional contacts will be made available for patients to discuss dose adjustments in between the 
scheduled visits. It is at the discretion of the I nvestigator to allow well-trained patients to make 
their IMP insulin dose adjustments in between the scheduled visits without  prior consultation of 
the site personnel. 
Doses may be reduced or modified at any time for hypoglycemia. Patients who experienced mild 
to moderate hypoglycemia as a result of a misse d meal, unusual exercise or alcohol use will be 
counseled on the correction of those behaviors and will not necessarily have their insulin dose 
decreased (decision to be based on I nvestigator's clinical judgment).

8.2 NON-INVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCT(S) 
8.2.1 Background therapy 
Background OAD treatment metformin, pioglitazone  and SGLT2 inhibitors (canagliflozin, 
dapagliflozin, empagliflozin) are considered as non-investigational medici nal products (NIMPs).  
Patients are enrolled with a background therapy co nsisting of metformin al one or metformin and 
pioglitazone or metformi n and SGLT2 inhibitor combination or  triple combina tion.  Metformin 
and pioglitazone (if applicable) and SGLT2 inhibitors (if app licable) should be administered 
orally according to local product labeling. For metf ormin, it should be at a stable dose of at least 
1500 mg/day or maximal tolerated dose for at least 3 months prior to screening (V1). The dose of 
pioglitazone (if applicable) and SGLT2 inhibitors (i f applicable) should also be stable for at least 
3 months prior screening visit (V1). The doses of background OAD treatment should be continued 
and should remain stable throughout the study unless there is a specific safety issue related to this 
treatment. 
The rescue therapy is also a NIMP and its introduction is described in Section  8.2.3. As per rescue 
therapy criteria rapid acting insulin is suggested (insulin glulisine when available) for patients in 
the FRC arm or basal insulin for patient s in the GLP-1 RA arm are suggested. 
Background therapy or rescue therapy are to be reported in the electronic case report form 
(e-CRF). 
The cost of the permitted background OAD treatment and suggested rescue therapy, if not 
covered by health insurance, will be reimbursed where permitted by local regulations. 
8.2.2 Diet and Exercise 
Lifestyle and diet therapy provided before the tim e of screening is to be continued during the 
study. Dietary and lifestyle counseling will be given by a health care professional at V2 or V3, 
V21, V28 and V32 which should be consistent with inte rnational or local guidelines for type 2 
diabetic patients (with regard to the distributi on of calories among carboh ydrates, proteins, and 
fats, exercise, etc). 
Compliance with the diet and lifestyle counseling will be assessed in case of insufficient glucose 
control.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 55 8.2.3 Rescue Therapy 
In case HbA1c is above 8% at Week 12 or later on , the Investigator will receive an alert issued 
by the central laboratory and should ensure that no reasonable explanation exists for insufficient 
glucose control and in particular that there is  no intercurrent disease which may jeopardize 
glycemic control (eg, infectious disease), that  the treatments are given at the planned dose and 
compliance to treatment and diet and lifestyle  is appropriate. HbA1c assessment should be 
scheduled at next visit (if next visit is a phone call, it should be replaced by an unscheduled visit 
at site) or within 4 weeks. If appropriate corrective action fails and if the repeated HbA1c remain 
above 8%, a rescue therapy should be considered  according to the Investigator’s judgment.  
In the FRC arm: 
• rescue therapy is recommended only if further dose titration is not possible, ie, the patient is already at the maximum daily dose of 60 units; 
• rapid acting insulin (insulin- glulisine when av ailable) is suggested and should be started 
as a single daily administration to be give n at the main meal of the day (excluding 
breakfast); 
• basal insulin is not allowed in the FRC arm. 
In the GLP-1 RA arm: 
• suggested rescue therapy is basal insulin at the investigator’s discretion. 
During the extension period, suggested rescue ther apy is rapid acting insulin (insulin- glulisine 
when available) for all patients. 
All assessments planned at the e nd of the randomized treatment visit (V28) are to be performed 
before initiating rescue therapy during the randomized treatment period. All assessments planned 
at the end of extension period treatment visit (V35) are to be performed before initiating rescue 
therapy during the extension period. After these assessments are completed and rescue therapy 
initiated, the patient will remain in the study and continue to administer the study treatment (including background therapy). The planned visits and assessments should be performed until the last scheduled visit. Patients r eceiving rescue therapy during th e randomized treatment period and 
eligible for the extension peri od can continue it as required.

Refer to Section  10.5 for suspected unexpected adverse drug  reaction unblinding by the Sponsor. 
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 
Patients will be randomized to one  of the two following treatment  arms during the 26-week open-
label treatment period: 
• FRC once daily, or 
• Victoza® once daily, Byetta® twice daily, Bydureon® once weekly, Tanzeum® once weekly, or Trulicity® once weekly (continuing  whichever therapy they were taking prior 
to randomization). 
The randomization ratio is 1:1. The rando mization is stratified by HbA1c (<8%, ≥8%) at 
screening and GLP-1 receptor agonist subtype at  screening (once/twice daily formulations, once 
weekly formulations).  
The randomization and the treatment allocation are performed centrally by an interactive response 
technology (IRT). The randomized treatment kit num ber list is generated ce ntrally by Sanofi, and 
the Study Biostatistician provides the randomization sc heme (including stratification) to the IRT. 
Then, the IRT generates the patient randomization list according to which it allocates treatment 
groups to the patients. 
The IMPs (FRC, or Victoza®, or Byetta®, or Bydureon®, or Tanzeum®, or Trulicity®) will be 
provided starting at V3 in ope n-label boxes and are identifie d with treatment kit numbers. 
At the screening visit the Investigator or designee has to contact the IRT center to receive the patient number. The patient identification (pa tient number) is composed of a 12-digit number 
containing the 3-digit country code, the 4-digit center code and the 5-dig it patient chronological 
number (which is 00001 for the first patient scr eened in a center, 00002 for the second patient 
screened in the same center, etc). 
A patient cannot be randomized more than once in the study.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 59 8.7 RESPONSIBILITIES 
The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or othe r personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP us ed in the clinical trial is securely maintained 
as specified by the Sponsor and in accordan ce with applicable regulatory requirements. 
All IMP will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the 
Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is 
maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or us e of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling,  expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor. Some deficiencies may be reco rded through a complaint procedure. 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be subject to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor. In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request 
made by the Sponsor, in order to r ecall IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator suppl y IMP to a third party, allow the IMP to be 
used other than as directed by this clinical tria l protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 
8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
The Investigator checks the compliance to the st udy treatments based on th e patient diary and by 
visually checking the returned FRC pens, Victoza®, Byetta®, Bydureon®, Tanzeum®, or Trulicity® pens and completes the appropriate “Treatment Log Form”. Visual check on return has to be performed by site staff. In addition he /she also records the dosing information on the 
appropriate pages of the e-CRF. The monitor in char ge of the study then checks the e-CRF data by 
comparing them with the IMP which he/she has retrieved and treatment log forms. 
For background OADs, name, start and end date of  treatment, total dail y dose, etc, will be 
documented in the source documents. Compliance to background OADs will be checked by 
interviewing the patient and reviewing the diary at  each visit and will be documented in the source 
documents and in the e-CRF. 
8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
Patients have to return all the used and in-use IMP (and corr esponding leaflets if appropriate) at 
each on-site visit. Patients should also return the unused IMP each time a re-supply is planned 
(see Section  1.2). 
Patients have to return all the used, in-use  and unused IMP at V28 (or final assessment on 
treatment visit in case of perm anent premature discontinuation). 
All used, partially used or unused treatments will be retrie ved by the Sponsor. A detailed 
treatment log of the returned IMP will be established with the Investigator (or the pharmacist) and countersigned by the Investigator and the Monitoring Team. 
For NIMP not provided by the Sponsor, tracking and reconciliation will be managed according to 
local regulation.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 60 8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
A concomitant medication is any treatment received by the patient  concomitantly to any IMP(s). 
8.8.1 Allowed concomitant therapy 
Any therapies or medications other than prohibited concomitant therapy in addition to the IMP 
should be kept to a minimum during the study. Howe ver, if these are considered necessary for the 
patient’s welfare and are unlikely to interfere with the IMP, they may be given at the discretion of 
the Investigator, with a stable dose (when possible). 
In the FRC treatment group, for or al treatments that are dependent on threshold concentrations for 
efficacy, such as oral contraceptives and antibio tics, patients should be advised to take those 
treatments at least 1 hour before study drug inje ction or about 11 hours afte r study drug injection. 
Gastro-resistant formulat ions containing substances sensitive to stomach degradation should also 
be administered 1 hour before or about  11 hours after injection of the FRC. 
Specific treatments, which are ongoing before the study and/or prescribed or changed during the 
study, must be recorded in the e-CRF and Source Data (please refer to Section  10.2.1). 
8.8.2 Concomitant diabetes therapy 
Background OADs (metformin, and pioglitazone a nd SGLT2 inhibitors) are non-investigational 
background therapies authorized during the study. Please see Section  8.2.1for details. 
Rapid acting insulin (insulin glulisine when available) for patients in the FRC arm or basal insulin 
for patients in the GLP-1 RA arm, are the non-in vestigational rescue therapies suggested during 
the study. Please see Section  8.2.3 for details. 
No other concomitant antidiabe tic treatments except the aut horized background and rescue 
therapies described above should be used in this study. 
8.8.3 Prohibited concomitant therapy 
The following drugs are not permitted during the screening period and the treatment periods of the 
study: 
• Any glucose-lowering agents other than the IMP, authorized background OADs and 
rescue therapy, if necessary; 
• Note:  Short-term use ( ≤10 days) of short/rapid-acting in sulin due to acute illness or 
surgery (eg, infectious disease) is allowed;  
• Systemic glucocorticoids for more than 10 days (topical or inhaled applications are 
allowed); 
• Body weight loss drugs.  
After the last administration of  IMP during the study period, any anti-diabetic treatments (other 
than GLP-1 receptor agonists) are permitted, as deemed necessary by the Investigator.

9.2.1.2 Efficacy Assessment Methods 
9.2.1.2.1 HbA1c measurement 
For the eligibility and efficacy assessments of the study, HbA1c is measured by a certified level I 
“National Glycohemoglobin St andardization Program” (N GSP) central laboratory. 
9.2.1.2.2 Standardized meal test 
Patients will undergo a standardized  meal challenge to assess fas ting and postprandial glucose 
(central laboratory), as well as plasma glucose excursion at V2 (Week -1) and V28 (Week 26), as 
well as V35 (Week 52) for patient c ontinuing in the extension period.  
The standardized meal contains approximately  600 kcal and is composed of 50 to 55% 
carbohydrate, 15 to 20% protein and 25 to 30% fat. The composition and the quantity of the 
standardized meal must be id entical throughout the study. 
If the patient needs to receive a rescue antidiabe tic medication, the standardized meal test should 
be performed before the introduction of the resc ue medication and will not  be performed at the 
final on-treatment visit. 
In case of permanent discontinuation of IMP, the standardized meal test should be performed only 
if the patient receives IMP on the day of the visit for daily IMP, or one to three days after the 
injection of the weekly GLP1-RA, and will not be repeated at the final on-treatment visit 
(Week 26 or Week 52).  
On the day of the standardized meal test, the patients will come to the investigational site in the 
morning, in fasting conditions for at least 8 hour s (no food or drink during this time except water), 
before the scheduled standardized meal test. At  V28 (Week 26) and V35 (Week 52) injection of

schedule. The meal test should be preferably perfo rmed from one to three days after the injection 
of the weekly GLP1-RA.  
The standardized meal for all patients s hould be consumed within a 15-minute period. 
Blood for plasma glucose and C–peptide is drawn 6 times: 
• 30 minutes prior to the start of the meal a nd before IMP administration if done before 
breakfast; 
• Just before the start of the standardized meal (0 minute); 
• 30 minutes after the start of the standardized meal; 
• 60 minutes after the start of the standardized meal; 
• 90 minutes after the start of the standardized meal; 
• 120 minutes after the start of the standardized meal.

9.2.1.2.3 Self-monitored plasma glucose profiles (SMPG) and glucometer 
9.2.1.2.3.1 Self-monitored plasma glucose profiles (SMPG) 
SMPG measurements are included the followi ngs and applies for all treatment groups: 
Fasting SMPG 
Fasting SMPG will be used by the Investigator and patients if appropriate to titrate and adjust the 
FRC dose and to monitor glycemic control in all groups. For all patient s (FRC arms and GLP-1 
RA control arm), the fasting SMPG should be measur ed by the patient before taking breakfast and 
administering the glucose-lowering agents: 
• once a day from randomization/IMP allocation V3 (Week 0) until V19 (Week 8) inclusive; 
• at least three times per week from V19 (Week 8) until the end of the randomized treatment visit V28 (Week 26) inclusive for all patients, and from V28 (Week  26) until the end of the extension treatment visit V35 (Week 52) inclusive for patients participating in the extension period, and  
• whenever the patient experiences hypoglycemia signs or symptoms.  
Fasting SMPG values should be recorded in the patient diary.

• For the first 8 weeks of the treatment period (from V3 until V19 inclusive): all available 
fasting SMPG values; 
• After the first 8 weeks until the end of the treatment period and during extension period: at 
least the last 3 available fasting SMPG values from the week prior to each site or phone 
visit; the last 3 available values leading to IMP dose change. 
The following daily fasting SMPG values in the GLP-1 RA control arm will be entered into the e-CRF: 
• For the first week of the treatment period (from V3 until V5 inclusive): all available fasting SMPG values; 
• After the first week until the end of the treatment period: at least the last 3 available fasting SMPG values from the week prior to each on site visit (V11, V19, V21, V24, V26, 
V28). 
7-point SMPG Profile 
The 7-point SMPG profile should be measured at the following 7 points: pre-prandial and 2 hours 
postprandial for breakfast, lunch, dinner and at bedtime. Two hours postprandial (breakfast, lunch 
and dinner) is defined as 2 hours after the start of the meal. 
The patients are requested to perform 7-point SMPG profile measurement over a single 24-hour 
period on 2 different days in the week before V3 (Week 0), V21 (Week 12), V28 (Week 26) and 
V35 (Week 52) for FRC patients- end of treatment asse ssment visit. The SMPG values measured 
for each 7-point SMPG profile will be recorded in the patient diary and transferred into the e-CRF. 
On the 7-point profile days, information on times of meals and bedtime, injection time and doses 
of IMP should be recorded in the patie nt’s diary and entered in the e-CRF. 
SMPG during episodes of symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Whenever the patient feels hypoglycemic symptoms, plasma glucose should be measured by the 
patient (or others, if applicable ), if possible. Patients should be  instructed to measure plasma 
glucose levels prior to the administration of  glucose or carbohydrate intake whenever 
symptomatic hypoglycemia is suspected ( Section  10.6.1), unless safety consid erations necessitate 
immediate glucose/carbohydrate rescue prior to confirmation. 
The SMPG values are to be entered in th e patient’s diary and entered in the e-CRF. 
Further SMPG 
The Investigator may decide to re quest more frequent self-monitoring  of plasma glucose if he/she 
considers necessary for the patient. The SMPG valu es are to be entered in the patient’s diary.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 65 9.2.1.2.3.2 Glucometer, patient diaries and training 
All patients are supplied with a glucometer, the co rresponding supplies (lancet s, test strips, etc), 
an instruction leaflet, and with diaries at visit V2 (Week -1) in order to perform self-measurement 
of plasma glucose and its recording. The patients will be instructed to bring their glucometers and patient diaries with them to each site visit. 
The glucometers should be calibrated according to instructions given in the package leaflet, and 
the study site should also check the glucose meters regularly using the provided control solutions for data validity. 
At visit V2 (Week -1) patients are trained to accu rately measure plasma glucose values with the 
glucometer and to correctly record the values and other requested information in the patient’s 
diaries. It is the Investigator’s responsibility to  explain the need to measure glucose at the times 
requested and to correctly record all SMPG values in the patient’s diaries to  patients. Training is 
repeated as often as necessary at the study visits. Instruction on how to complete the patient diary on a daily basis will be done by site staff. At each 
on site visit: 
• The study site staff reviews the patient’s diary; 
• SMPG values stored in the glucose meter memory will be downloaded, printed out, dated, 
signed and filed into the patient file. This information will help the Investigator to assess treatment effects, adjust insulin doses and compliance. 
Note: The SMPG values recorded into the diary, which have to be entered in the e-CRF, have to be checked for consistency with the information downloaded from the glucose meter. In case of inconsistency, the reason for inconsistency has to be documented. If needed, the resulting action (eg, training of the patient on correct documentati on of the values) is also to be documented. The 
confirmed values will be entered into e-CRF by the Investigator or designee based on the glucometer output values. 
The patient diary includes but is not limited to the following information: 
• Time and dose of IMP (insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination or Victoza®, or Byetta® 
or Bydureon®, or Tanzeum®, or Trulicity®) injections; 
• Days of no IMP use (including date of starting and ending); 
• Time and value of fasting SMPG measurements; 
• Time of start of meals and SMPG measurements  as well as plasma glucose values the days 
of the 7-point profile; 
• Potential changes in background OADs; 
• Adverse events, including signs and symptoms suggesting occurrence of hypoglycemia and local injection site reactions, if any; 
• Any problems with an injection pen.

Body weight should be obtained with the patient wearing undergarments or very light clothing 
and no shoes, and with an empty bladder. The sa me scale should be used throughout the study, 
and calibrated on a regular basis as recommended by the manufacturer. 
The use of balance scales is recommended; if digita l scales are used, testing with standard weights 
is of particular importance. The floor surface on which the scale rests must be hard and should not 
be carpeted or covered with other soft material. The scale should be balanced with both weights at 
zero and the balance bar aligned. Th e patient should stand in the cente r of the platform as standing 
off-center may affect measurement. The weights are moved until the beam balances (the arrows 
are aligned). The weight is read and recorded in the e-CRF and Source Data. Self-reported weights are not acceptable; patients must not read the scales themselves. 
9.2.1.2.5 Dose of IMP 
The patients document daily/weekly their IMP do se(s) or any missed IMP injection(s) in the

Clinical safety will be assessed by: 
• Physical examination; 
• Vital signs (systolic and diasto lic blood pressure, heart rate). 
Blood pressure (mmHg) should be measured when th e patient is quiet and seated and with their 
arm outstretched in line with mid-sternum and supported. Meas urement should be taken under 
standardized conditions, approximately at the same time of the day, on the same arm, with the 
same device (after the patient ha s rested comfortably for at least five minutes) and the values are 
to be recorded in the e-CRF. Both systolic bl ood pressure and diastolic blood pressure should be 
recorded. Devices for blood pressure measurement should be regularly recalibrated according to 
manufacturers´ instructions. 
Determination of the arm for blood pressure measurements: 
At V1 of the screening period, blood pressure ha s to be measured on both of the arms after 
5 minutes in seated position and then again after two minutes in both arms in seated position. The 
arm with the higher diastolic pressure will be dete rmined at this visit, identifying the reference 
arm for future measurements throughout the study. The highest value will be recorded in the 
e-CRF (all blood pressure values are to  be recorded in the source data). 
Heart rate (bpm) will be measured at the time of the measurement of blood pressure. 
9.2.2.5 Electrocardiogram variables 
The ECG assessment of “normal” or “abnormal” will be analyzed. 
Investigators will have 12-lead ECG devices which will automatically assess the ECG as 
“normal” or “abnormal”. ECG stat us of “normal” or “abnormal” will be repor ted in the e-CRF as 
determined by the Investigator. 
The 12-lead ECGs should be pe rformed after at least 10 minutes in supine position. The 
electrodes are to be positioned at the same place for each ECG recording throughout the study. 
Each trace is analyzed in comparison with the screening recorded tracing. The original tracing is 
kept as source data. 
Notes: Any abnormal ECG parameter should be immediately rech ecked for confirmation before 
making a decision of permanent discontinuation of treatment with IMPs fo r the concerned patient.

Antibody variables in FRC group: 
• Anti-insulin glargine antibody: 
- Status (Positive, Negative) and titer; 
- Cross-reactivity of anti-insulin glargne antibodies with human insulin. 
• Anti-lixisenatide antibody: - Status (Positive, Negative) and concentration;  
- Cross-reactivity of anti-lixisenatide antibodi es with GLP-1 and glucagon as well as 
neutralizing effects of these antibodies against lixisenatide, GLP-1 and glucagon. 
Sampling time: Blood samples for antibodies will be take n before injection of IMP in the FRC 
patients: for anti-lixisenatide antibody, at ba seline (V3, day 1), V11 (Week 4), V21 (Week 12) 
and V28 (Week 26), V35 (Week 52, for patient in ex tension period); for anti-insulin antibody, at 
baseline (V3, Day 1) and V28 (Week 26), V35 (Week 52, for patient in extension period). 
Samples will also be taken in case of premature discontinuation from IMP, if possible. One 
additional sample for potential a dditional assessments of immunogenicity will be taken when the 
patients completes the study (either at Week 26, Week 52 or in case of premature discontinuation). 
Antibodies handling procedures: Detailed procedures of samp le preparation, storage and 
shipment will be described in the specific laboratory manual. 
Bioanalytical method: Antibodies will be determined at centr alized laboratories using validated 
assay methodologies.     
9.3 OTHER ENDPOINTS 
9.3.1 Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics parameters: Total plasma concentrations of lixisenatide  
Lixisenatide PK sampling: For total concentrations of lixisenatide,  blood samples are to be taken 
for patients from the FRC group as described in the flowchart: 
• At Day 1 one sample will be  taken in the time period from 1 to 4 hours post injection. 
• At the other visits (Week 4, Week 12, Week  26 and Week 52), 1 sample will be taken 
immediately before IMP injection and 1 sample will be taken in the time period from 1 to 
4 hours post injection. 
Samples will also be taken in case of premature discontinuation from IMP or rescue therapy, if possible. In case of premature discontinuation, one PK sample is sufficient if the last dose of IMP is not administered at this visit.

injection at Week 4, Week 12, Week 26. 
9.4 ENDPOINTS OF THE EXTENSION PERIOD 
All primary and secondary effica cy, safety, PK and other endpoint s will be also assessed at the 
end of the extension period (Week 52). 
9.5 FUTURE USE OF SAMPLES 
Not applicable. 
9.6 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS  
The combination of basal insulin with a GLP-1 r eceptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) in a single daily 
injection is expected to lower HbA1c, as a result of complementary action on both fasting and 
postprandial glucose, with less or no weight gain compared to insulin alone, and a limited 
increased risk of hypoglycemia. 
The primary efficacy analysis of this study comparing FRC to GLP-1 receptor agonist will be 
based on the primary endpoint: change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26. 
The concentration of HbA1c reflects the glycemic hi story of the previous 120 days and is thus an 
index of mean glycemia, documen ting glycemic control over the pa st 2- to 3-months. HbA1c has 
also been shown to correlate with the development of long-term complications of diabetes, and reduction of HbA1c is known to reduce the risk  of long-term microva scular complications.

EFC13794 - HOE901/AVE0010 Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 72 Therefore, HbA1c is considered an appropriate primary endpoint for assessing the effect of a 
treatment on glycemic control. In addition to the analysis of the change from baseline in HbA1c, 
the responder analysis allows the clinical rele vance of the reduction observed in HbA1c to be 
demonstrated. The duration of study treatment is considered to be sufficient for achieving stable 
conditions with IMP and for enabling an adequate assessment of time-dependent changes in HbA1c and the concomitant risk of hypoglycemia. 
The problem of weight gain in type 2 diabet es is widely recognized. More than 80% of 
individuals with type 2 diabetes are overweight, many at the time of diagnosis. Consequently, 
iatrogenic weight gain is not only unwelcome, but re presents an important clinical issue that can 
become a barrier to the successful management of glycemic control. In this LixiLan-G study it is postulated that treatment  intensification with the combin ation product will ove rcome the burden 
of weight gain that is typical when adding or  up titrating basal insulin. Taking into account the 
major impact of insulin-related body weight gain, it is appropriate to incl ude body weight change 
as secondary efficacy endpoint. 
Insulin glargine targets primarily, although not exclusively, fasting hyperglycemia, and 
lixisenatide effectively acts on post-prandial glycaemia mainly by slowing down gastric emptying. Therefore assessment of both fas ting and post-prandial glucose (a fter a standardized meal) is 
relevant in this study. These 2 parameters are also considered by regulatory agencies to be 
supportive of efficacy of an antidiabetic agent.  C-peptide, which is cleaved from insulin in 
secretory granules, is a known as a marker for β-cell function and will therefore be also evaluated.  
Safety will be evaluated by standard clinical and laboratory measurements. Specific safety parameters of interest for a glucose lowering injectable peptide, such as symptomatic hypoglycemia, injection site reactions and potential allergic reactions, will also be assessed. In addition, due to the use of the GLP-1 receptor agon ists, pancreatic enzyme s (amylase and lipase) 
and serum calcitonin concentration will be monitored and reported over the study course according to specific procedures ( Section  10.6.4 and Section  10.6.5). Furthermore, assessments of 
the immunogenicity of insulin glargine  and lixisenatide will be performed.

This section is to summarize information not presented in the flow chart or in Section  9. 
10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
The visit schedule and procedures/assessments  listed in the “Study Flow Chart” in Section  1.2 are 
not repeated in this section. The aim of this s ection is to provide deta ils on how some of the 
procedures/assessments ha ve to be performed. 
This is an outpatient study. The 26-week rando mized period consists of 10 on-site visits, 
8 titration phone calls (only for FRC arm) and 11 phone-call vis its. Additional, optional phone 
call visits to monitor insulin glargine/lixisen atide combination dose adjustment should be 
scheduled whenever considered necessary by the Investigator. 
During the single-arm extension period there w ill be 3 additional on-site  visits and 4 phone call 
visits.  
The patient has to be fasting for a ll on-site visits. For all these visits, the patient should be seen in 
the morning, at approximately the same time, as far as possi ble. The patient should take 
background OADs and inject the FRC or Victoza® or Byetta® (if injected in the morning) at the 
investigational site after the fasting blood sample has been dr awn. Patients taking Bydureon®, 
Tanzeum®, or Trulicity® should follow their usua l weekly injection schedule, and therefore do 
not necessarily need to inject at the investig ational site on the day of an on-site visit. 
The fasting condition  is defined as an overnight fast no less than 8 hours that consisted of no 
food or liquid intake, other than water. IMP (not including the once weekly GLP-1 RAs) and other 
glucose-lowering agents should be administered after the fasting blood sample is drawn for all 
laboratory tests on the study site. 
Note:  If the patient is not fasting at the visits specified above, the blood sample will not be 
collected and a new appointment should be given to  the patient for the following day if possible, 
with instruction to be fasted. 
Visit window:  During the screening period and for ra ndomization visit (V3) a visit window of 
± 3 days is acceptable, taking the date of V1 as reference until the randomization V3. During the 
treatment period a visit window of ± 3 days is acceptable taking V3 as reference, for V5 to V19 
(except for additional titration calls for FRC treatment, see Section  10.1.2.4), and a visit window 
of ± 5 days is acceptable from V20 to V35. A visit window of -1 day or + 3 days for the post-
treatment follow-up visits for the randomized trea tment period and extension period is acceptable 
using the day of V28 and V35 respectively as reference. If one visit date is changed, the next visit 
should take place according to the original schedule.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 74 10.1.1 Screening period (Week -2 up to Week 0) 
The screening period is about 2 weeks ±3 days from screening visit (V1, Week -2) to baseline 
visit (V3, Week 0). The screening period must be a minimum of 1 week duration in order to ensure availability of IMP at the site (IMP must be available for the site to conduct the baseline visit). It must also be long enough to collect the data to establish if the patient satisfies the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Only patients who meet the inclusion criteria as noted in Section  7.1 may be screened. It will be 
the Investigator’s responsibility to confirm the diagnosis of T2DM. During the screening period the patients should c ontinue their anti-hyperglycemic treatment as 
before the screening visit, ie, their background therapy (please see Section  8.2 for details) as well 
as their GLP-1 RA treatment (Victoza®, Bye tta®, Bydureon®, Tanzeum®, or Trulicity®).  
All laboratory tests measured at a central laboratory that are needed for checking the exclusion 
criteria of the patients are performed at the sc reening visit (V1). After the screening period, 
patients who meet the selection criteria at the end of screening period as noted in Section  7 can 
enter into the open-label randomized treatment period. If any of the laboratory parameters are not available at the end of the screening period (eg, sample material damaged during transport…), a 
retest can be performed. Retesting done by the Central Laboratory for quality purposes by the 
reference lab for HbA1c cannot be used for sc reening purposes. Exceptionally, if justified 
according to the Investigator and after discussion with the medical monitor, this screening period 
can be extended by one additional week. This may occur in, but is not limited to, examples such 
as when source documentation (eg, from patient’s primary physician) need s to be obtained to 
confirm the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, when screening laboratory results demand further clarification, or in cases where there is a de lay in IMP supply or when the patient requires 
additional training and time to demonstrate compliance. Randomization V3 (baseline, Day 1) 
cannot be scheduled later than 3 weeks (± 3 days) after the screening visit (V1, Week -2). 
A patient should not be randomized more than on ce. In case of screen failure due to reasons 
expected to change at rescreening and based upon th e Investigator’s clinical judgment, the patient 
can be rescreened one time for this study.

At this visit, the patient must return to the investigation site in the morning after 8 hours fasting 
not having administered GLP-1 RA nor background therapy at home. Patients will visit the site with their blood glucometer and diary. 
Note:  Patients who are taking a once weekly form ulation of GLP-1 RA (Bydureon®, Tanzeum®, 
or Trulicity®) must have th eir baseline visit scheduled at least 1 week  after administering their 
last dose. If a patient arrives for their baseline visit and is found to have  administered their last 
dose of a once weekly GLP-1 RA less than 1 we ek prior, the visit should be cancelled and 
rescheduled to occur at least 1 week after their last dose, but within the allowed window of the 
screening period as per Section  10.1.1. 
Compliance check 
Compliance check includes compliance to back ground OAD treatment and use of glucometer, 
review of fasting SMPG values, a nd the 7-point SMPG profile and pa tient diary. If patient is not 
appropriately compliant with the study procedures, the training will be repeated by the site staff. 
IRT contact 
After the baseline assessments are completed and eligibility confirmed, the Investigator contacts 
IRT for randomization to the study.  
The HbA1c will be entered in the IRT (directly by the laboratory or by the Investigator): If the patient’s HbA1c at the screening (V1) results are 7% ≤HbA1c ≤9%, the treatment group

The patient is called by the Investigator or qualified designee at a scheduled time. If the call has 
been completed by site staff other than the Inves tigator, the Investigator has to be consulted if 
AE/SAE is suspected and informed in case AE/SAE occurred. In case of an AE the patient may be 
asked to come to the investigational site, as appropriate. A phone call visit can optionally be 
performed as a clinical visit in case of sy mptomatic hypoglycemia/AE or other reasons. 
During the phone call, the following questions are to be asked: 
• Did you experience any new medical event, disease or symptom since the last visit? 
• Did you experience any hypoglycemic events or symptoms? 
• Did you experience any possible allerg ic symptoms, or skin reactions? 
• Do you feel comfortable in handling the diar y, glucose meter and IM P injection device or 
do you need any more explanation? 
• Did you adjust IMP since last visit (if appropriate)? What is your IMP dose? 
• Which pen you are using? What is the daily dose you are using? Did you adjust IMP since last phone call/visit? In case th e patient has used two pens (a peach pen and an olive pen), 
it should be reported and documen ted in the diary as well as the doses administrated.  
• Did you experience any changes in a pre-ex isting medical condition, disease or symptom

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 80 10.1.2.6 Post-treatment follow-up phone call visit for randomized treatment period 
Post-treatment follow-up phone call visit is performed 3 (-1/+3) days following the last injection 
of the IMP (or 9 (-1/+3) days for patients receiving weekly GLP-1 RA). The visit is performed 
both for patients who completed the study and patients who withdrew from the study at the time of IMP discontinuation. The visit is NOT perform ed for patients who prematurely discontinued 
the IMP treatment and stay in the study. For patients continuing in the extension period, the visit is not performed in the randomized treatment period. This visit can be a phone call visit, or an on-
site visit in case of ongoing or new adverse ev ent during the post-treatme nt period, if necessary. 
The patient is called by the Investigator or me dically qualified designee at  a certain, previously 
agreed time point. 
During the phone call, the following questions are to be asked: 
• Did you experience any new medical event, disease or symptom since the last visit? 
• Did you experience any changes in a pre-ex isting medical condition, disease or symptom 
since the last visit? 
• Did you change, take or add any new medications since the last visit? 
• Did you experience any hypoglycemic symptoms or events? 
All reports of hypoglycemic events (if any) or any adverse events are recorded. The use or change 
of any concomitant medications, including rescue therapy, is recorded. 
IRT is contacted for notification of the end of study. 
10.1.3 Extension period (Week 26 to Week 52) 
Patients meeting all inclus ion criteria in the FRC treatment gr oup and with no exclusion criteria at 
the end of the randomized treatment period V28 (Week 26) continue into the extension period. 
The duration of the extension period for all pa tients is 26 weeks ± 5 days from end of the 
randomized treatment period visit (V28, Week 26) to the end of the extension visit (V35, 
Week 52). 
10.1.3.1 Baseline visit for the extension period: V28a (Week 26) 
V28a is performed on the same day as V28, upon completion of V28 procedures for patients 
consenting for the extension period.  
Eligibility for the extension will be assessed for patients treated with the FRC. Eligible patients 
will continue to use the FRC for the ne xt 26 weeks of the extension period.  
The investigator will contact the IRT in order to allocate the IMP for patients who will continue in the extension period. Diary and IMP will be dispensed.

visits: V29 (Week 30); V31 (Week 38); V33 (Week 46); V34 (Week 50) 
The patient is called by the Investigator or qualified designee at a scheduled time. If the call has 
been completed by site staff other than the Investigator, the Investigator has to be consulted if AE/SAE is suspected and informed in case AE/SAE occurred. In case of an AE the patient may be 
asked to come to the investigational site, as appropriate. A phone call visit can optionally be 
performed as a clinical visit in case of sy mptomatic hypoglycemia/AE or other reasons. 
During the phone call, the following questions are to be asked: 
• Did you experience any new medical event, disease or symptom since the last visit? 
• Did you experience any hypoglycemic events or symptoms? 
• Did you experience any possible allerg ic symptoms, or skin reactions? 
• Do you feel comfortable in handling the diar y, glucose meter and IM P injection device or 
do you need any more explanation? 
• Did you adjust IMP since last visit (if appropriate)? What is your IMP dose? 
• Which pen you are using? What is the daily dose you are using? Did you adjust IMP since last phone call/visit? In case th e patient has used two pens (a peach pen and an olive pen), 
it should be reported and documen ted in the diary as well as the doses administrated.  
• Did you experience any changes in a pre-ex isting medical condition, disease or symptom 
since the last visit? 
• Did you miss, change, take or add any new medications (including OAD if appropriate) 
since the last visit? 
• Did you measure any fasting SMPG value out side of the range 80 to 100 mg/dL (4.4 to 
5.6 mmol/L)? 
The phone visits will also include: 
• Asking patient’s fasting pre-breakfast SMPG and the insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination dose on the last 3 measurements including day of visit; 
• Adjustment of the dose of IMP, to continue treatment toward the target fasting SMPG between 80 and 100 mg/dL (4.4 and 5.6 mmol/L), inclusive; 
• Recording of AE and symptomatic hypoglycemia events (if any); 
• Recording of the use or change  of any concomitant medication.

10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possibl e. In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made tempor arily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort. Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the CRF. In any case, the 
patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 
10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be consider ed by the Investigator because of suspected 
AEs or for other reasons. In case of treatment interruption due to an AE, reinitiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under close and appropri ate clinical/and or laboratory monitoring once

selection criteria for the study are still met (refer to Section  7.1 and Section  7.2). 
For all temporary treatment discontinuations, duration should be reco rded by the Investigator in 
the appropriate pages of the e-CRF when considered as confirmed.  
10.3.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Permanent treatment discontinuation is any tr eatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the patient not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time. 
10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Inve stigator’s decision. All efforts should be made to 
document the reasons for treatment discontinuati on and this should be documented in the e-CRF. 
Patients may withdraw from treatment with IMP in case of the following reasons: 
• At patient’s own request, ie, wit hdrawal of consent for treatment; 
• If, in the Investigator's opinion, continuati on with the administration of IMP would be 
detrimental to the patient's well-being; 
• At the specific request of the Sponsor. 
A patient must withdraw from treatment with IMP in case of the following: 
• Intercurrent condition that requires discon tinuation of IMP: eg, laboratory abnormalities 
(see decision tree and general guidance for the follow up of laboratory abnormalities in Appendix B ), diagnosis of acute pancreatitis confirmed by gastroenterologic evaluation 
and imaging (see Section  10.6.4) calcitonin value ≥50 pg/mL (see Section  10.6.5); 
• Pregnancy. 
Any abnormal laboratory value or ECG parameter will be immediately rechecked for 
confirmation (eg, after 24 hours)  before making a decision of permanent discontinuation of the 
IMP for the patient concerned. 
10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients will be main tained in the study as much as possible and followed-up according to the 
study procedures as specified in this protocol (e xcept for the 3 day safety post-treatment follow-up 
assessment) up to the scheduled date of study completion, or up to recovery or stabilization of any 
AE requiring follow-up as specified in this protocol, whichever comes last.  
If possible, after the permanent discontinuation of  treatment regardless of the reason, the patients 
will be assessed as soon as possible using the pr ocedure normally planned for the last dosing day

For the meal test, please refer to Section  9.2.1.2.2. 
All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation s hould be recorded by the Investigator in the 
appropriate pages of the e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records when considered as 
confirmed. IRT should be notified when a pa tient prematurely di scontinues treatment. 
10.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study 
The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any 
time and irrespective of the reason. Withdrawal of  consent for treatment should be distinguished 
from withdrawal of consent for follow-up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non-patient 
contact follow-up, eg, medical records check. Patien ts requesting withdrawal should be informed 
that withdrawal of consent for follow-up may jeopardize the public health value of the study. If 
possible, the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planne d for the end-of-study visit. 
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible AEs to their decision to withdraw consent, and any AE inform ation elicited should be documented. Preferably 
the patient should withdraw consent in writing and, if the patient or the patient’s representative 
refuses or is physically unavailable, the site should document and sign the reason for the patient’s 
failure to withdraw consent in writing.  
All cases of study withdrawals should be recorded by the Investigator in the appropriate screens 
of the e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records when considered as confirmed. In the medical record, at least the date of the withdrawal a nd the reason should be documented. IRT should be 
notified when a patient withdraws from the study. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, unle ss the patient withdraws the consent for follow-up, 
the Investigator should make the best effort to  re-contact the patient (eg, contacting patient’s 
family or private physician, reviewing available re gistries or health care databases), and to 
determine his/her health status, in cluding at least his/her vital st atus. Attempts to contact such 
patients must be documented in the patient’s records (eg, times and dates of a ttempted telephone 
contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). 
The statistical analysis plan will specify how these patients lost to follow-up for their primary 
endpoints will be considered. 
Patients who have withdraw n from the study cannot be re-randomized (treated) in the study. Their 
inclusion and treatment numb ers must not be reused.

10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  
10.4.1.1 Adverse event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product an d which does not necessar ily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. 
10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
• Results in death, or 
• Is life-threatening, or 
 Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
 the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
 hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
• Requires inpatient hos pitalization or prolongation of  existing hospitalization, or 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, or 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect 
• Is a medically important event 
 Medical and scientific judg ment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited 
 reporting is appropriate in othe r situations, such as important medical events that may not 
 be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the  patient or may require medical or surgical in tervention (ie, specific measures or corrective 
 treatment) to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
Note: The following list of medically important events is intended to serve as a guideline for determining which conditi on has to be considered as a medi cally important event. The list is 
not intended to be exhaustive: 
- Intensive treatment in an emer gency room or at home for: 
- Allergic bronchospasm, 
- Blood dyscrasias (ie, agranulocytosis, aplastic anemia, bone marrow aplasia, 
myelodysplasia, pancytopenia),  
- Convulsions (seizures, epilepsy, epile ptic fit, absence seizures, etc). 
- Development of drug depe ndence or drug abuse, 
- ALT >3 x ULN + total bilirubin >2 x ULN or asymptomatic ALT increase >10 x ULN, 
- Suicide attempt or any event suggestive of suicidality, 
- Syncope, loss of consciousness (except if  documented as a consequence of blood 
sampling),

- Chronic neurodegenerative diseases (newly diagnosed) or aggravated during the study. 
10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an  AE (serious or non-ser ious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, fo r which ongoing monitoring and 
immediate notification by the Investigator to th e Sponsor is required. Such events may require 
further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special 
interest may be added or removed dur ing a study by protocol amendment. 
All AESI will be reported to the Sponsor in th e same timeframe as SAEs, ie within 24 hours as 
detailed in Section  10.4.1.2. 
AESI are listed below: 
• Confirmed ALT increase (>3 x ULN) (see Appendix B ); 
• Pregnancy occurring in a female patient entered in the study as well as pregnancy 
occurring in a female partner of a male patient entered in a study with IMP/NIMP; 
- Pregnancy will be recorded as an AESI with immediate notification in all cases. 
- It will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria (see Section  10.4.1.2); 
- In the event of pregnancy in a female pa rticipant, IMP should be discontinued;  
- Follow-up of the pregnancy in a female participant or in a female partner of a male participant is mandatory until the outcome has been determined. 
• Symptomatic overdose (serious or non-serious) with IMP/NIMP 
An overdose (accidental or intentional) with the IMP/NIMP is an event suspected by the 
Investigator or spontaneously notified by the patient (not based on systemic pen counts) 
and defined as follows: 
- For insulin glargine/lixisenatide combination: any dose corresponding to a lixisenatide 
daily dose greater than 40 µg (ie, >80 U for Peach pen and >120 U for Olive pen); 
- For GLP-1 RA: any dose greater than 2-fold above the recommended/planned or prescribed dose administrated per day within th is Clinical Trial (ie, greater than 3.6 mg 
per day for Victoza®, greater than 40 µg per day for Byetta®, greater than 4 mg per week for Bydureon®, greater than 100 mg per week for Tanzeum®, and greater than 3 mg per week for Trulicity®); 
- For background OADs, any dose greater than 2-fold above the recommended/planned or prescribed dose administrated per day within this Clinical trial. 
The circumstances of the overdose (i e, accidental or intentional) should be clearly specified in the 
verbatim and symptoms, if any, entered on separate AE forms. 
Note: Asymptomatic overdose with IMP does not need immediate notification, and thus is to be 
reported in the standard AE pages in the e-CRF.

criteria). 
• Suspected allergic reactions (please refer to Section  10.6.3); 
• Monitoring of patients with increased pancr eatic enzymes >2 x ULN/pancreatic events 
(please refer to Section  10.6.4);

Section  10.6.5); 
• Monitoring of device-related events (please refer to Section  10.6.8). 
10.4.2 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
• All AEs, regardless of seriousness or rela tionship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature of the informed consent form until the end of the study as defined by the 
protocol for that patient, are to be record ed on the corresponding screen(s) of the e-CRF. 
• Whenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, additional investigations performed, outcome, and his/her opinion as to whether there is a reasonable possibility that the AE was caused by the IMP or by the study procedure(s).  
• The Investigator should take appropriate measur es to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until progression has been stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the safety of the patients. This may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol , and that additional 
investigations may be requested by the monito ring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor.  
• When treatment is prematurely discontinued, the patient’s observations will continue until the end of the study as defined by  the protocol for that patient. 
• Laboratory, vital signs or ECG abnormalities are to be recorded as AEs only if:  
- Symptomatic and/or; 
- Requiring either corrective trea tment or consu ltation, and/or; 
- Leading to IMP discontinuation or modification of dosing, and/or; 
- Fulfilling a seriousness criterion, and/or; 
- Defined as an AESI or event requiring specific monitoring.

Care should be taken to ensure that the patient's identity is protected and the patient's 
identifiers in the clinical trial are properly mentioned on any copy of a source document 
provided to the Sponsor. For laboratory results, include the laboratory normal ranges. 
• All further data updates should be recorded in the e-CRF as appropriate, and further 
documentation as well as additional information (for laboratory data, concomitant medications, patient status, etc)  should be sent (by fax or e- mail) to the monitoring team 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the SAE. In addition, every effort should be made to 
further document any SAE that is fatal or life threatening within a week (7 days) of the initial notification. 
• A back-up plan (using a paper CRF process) is available and should be used when the 
e-CRF system does not work (please see Appendix C ). 
Any SAE brought to the attention of the Investigator at any time after the end of the study for the patient and considered by him/her  to be caused by the IMP with a reasonable possibility, should 
be reported to the monitoring team. 
10.4.4 Guidelines for reporting adverse events of special interest   
For AESIs, the Sponsor must be informed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), as per SAE 
notification guidelines described in Section  10.4.1.3, even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, 
using the corresponding pages of the CRF (t o be sent) or screens in the e-CRF. 
Instructions for AE reporting are summarized in Table 2 . 
10.4.5 Guidelines for management of specific laboratory abnormalities

10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Symptomatic Hypoglycemia 
Symptomatic hypoglycemia events will be categorized as follows: 
Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event requiring assistance of another person to actively 
administer carbohydrate, glucagon, or other re suscitative actions. These episodes may be 
associated with sufficient neuroglycopenia to induce seizure, unconscious ness or coma. Plasma 
glucose measurements may not be available durin g such an event, but neurological recovery 
attributable to the restoration of  plasma glucose to normal is cons idered sufficient evidence that 
the event was induced by a low plasma glucose concentration. 
The definition of severe symptomatic hypoglycem ia includes all episodes in which neurological 
impairment was severe enough to prevent self-tre atment and which were thus thought to place 
patients at risk for injury to themselves or others. 
Note  that “requires assistance” means that the patient  could not help himself or herself. Assisting 
a patient out of kindness, when assistance is not  required, should not be considered a “requires 
assistance” incident. Severe symptomatic hypoglycemia will be qualified as an SAE only if it fulfills SAE criteria. All 
events of seizure, unconsciousness or coma must be reported as SAEs. 
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Documented symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which typical symptoms of 
hypoglycemia are accompanied by a meas ured plasma glucose concentration of ≤70 mg/dL 
(3.9 mmol/L). 
Clinical symptoms that are considered to result from a hypoglycemic episode can include (but are 
not limited to): increased sweating, nervousness, as thenia, tremor, dizzine ss, increased appetite, 
palpitations, headache, sleep disorder, conf usion, seizures, unconsciousness, and coma.

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol No. 02  12-May-2017 
EFC13794 - HOE901/AVE0010 Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 94 Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia 
Probable symptomatic hypoglycemia is an event during which symptoms of hypoglycemia are not 
accompanied by a plasma glucose determination, but was presumably caused by a plasma glucose concentration less than or equal to 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L); symptoms improved with oral 
carbohydrate, or Intravenous glucose or glucagon in jection without a test of plasma glucose.  
Patients will be instructed to measure finger-stick plasma glucose levels prior to the 
administration of carbohydrates whenever symptomatic hypoglycemia is suspected, unless safety considerations necessita te immediate glucose administration prior to confirmation, and then a 
glucose measurement should be performed as soon  as safe, with appropr iate diary documentation. 
Details on hypoglycemia episodes will be captured in the patient diaries, and patients will contact the sites as soon as possible following severe ev ents to review the details and decide on any 
necessary measures to be taken. 
Symptomatic hypoglycemia episodes will be documented on the dedicated hypoglycemia event 
page in the e-CRF. Symptomatic hypoglycemia events fulfilling the criteria of a SAE will also be 
documented on AE and SAE forms in the e-CRF. 
10.6.2 Local tolerability at injection site 
In case the Investigator or the patient recognizes any signs of local intolerability at injection site 
this should be recorded on the standard AE page in the e-CRF. 
10.6.3 Allergic or allergic-like reaction 
In case a patient experiences an allergic reaction or  an allergic-like reaction this has to be reported 
as an adverse event and recorded in the e-CRF on the specific AE form for suspected allergic 
event. Additional information is collected on specific allergic reaction complementary form. Allergic reaction or possible allergic reaction will be adjudicated by the ARAC ( Section  6.4.2). 
Virtually all symptoms listed on the allergic reaction complementary form are possible adverse 
reactions that may be allergic in nature and ma y need to be addressed after medical judgment, 
excluding another etiology than allergy. 
Sometimes transient injection site reactions, irritant in nature, may occur requiring no intervention 
and are of dubious significance. These reactions woul d not be considered to be allergic reactions. 
Adverse events that are obviously not of allergic origin (eg, local injection site reactions) should 
not be recorded on the Allergic Event page  or Allergic Reaction Complementary Form. 
10.6.4 Monitoring of patients with increased lipase and/or amylase >2x ULN 
Potential safety signals for acute pancreatitis have been identified in the post-marketing 
experience of other GLP-1 receptor agonists. Ther efore, patients enrolled in this study should be 
followed for any suspected pancreatitis, eg, with  symptoms and/or signs of acute abdominal 
distress or abnormal levels of pancreatic en zymes. Serum amylase and lipase concentrations are 
monitored routinely at screening, baseline a nd periodically during the study treatment period.

EFC13794 - HOE901/AVE0010 Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 95 In the presence of clinical signs and/or symptoms evocative of pancreatitis, eg, persistent 
abdominal pain, which can radiate to the back, of ten with characteristic positional features, with 
possible occurrence of nausea, vomiting, fever and leukocytosis, further measurement of amylase and lipase should be performed. The clinical sign s and/or symptoms should be documented in the 
source data. 
(1) Elevation of Amylase and/or Lipase >2x ULN without clinical signs and/or symptoms 
In any case where amylase and/or lipase are >2x ULN, a retest (centrally assessed as far as 
possible) must be performed as follows: 
• If value(s) is/are >2-3x ULN: retest within 7 days; 
• If value(s) is/are >3x UL N: retest within 48 hours; 
• If the value(s) remain(s) >2x ULN upon retestin g: amylase and/or lipase levels should be 
retested weekly until values are <2x ULN. 
In case a retest is >2x ULN a gastroenterological  evaluation and imaging (ultrasound and/or CT or 
MRI with contrast, as appropriate) must be pe rformed. Please document in the source data the 
absence of clinical signs and/or symptoms (if c linical signs and/or symptoms develop, please see 
part (2) below). 
Best clinical judgment is to be used when interpreting elevated serum amylase and lipase levels in 
asymptomatic patients. Temporary discontinuation of the IMP may be considered in these cases if 
deemed necessary by the Investigator. 
(2) Elevation of Amylase and/or Lipase >2 x ULN with clinical signs and/or symptoms 
In the presence of clinical signs and/or symptoms evocative of pancreatitis (as described above) 
associated with elevated amylase and/or lipase, treatment with the IMP should be promptly and at least temporarily discontinued pending further clinical evaluation and diagnosis confirmation. 
Clinical signs and/or symptoms are to be  documented in the source data. A laboratory 
determination of amylase and lipase has to be obtained at the time of the event and again within 48 hours or earlier as clinically indicated. If the value(s) remain(s) >2x ULN, then amylase and/or 
lipase levels should be retested as described in (1) above, or more often if clinically indicated. 
A gastroenterologic evaluation and imaging (ultr asound and/or CT or MRI with contrast, as 
appropriate) must be perfo rmed. If a diagnosis of pancreatitis is confirmed, IMP should not be 
restarted and should be pe rmanently discontinued. 
In both cases as described above under (1) and (2), all laboratory or clinical documentations are to 
be collected. If the retest confirms lipase and/or amylase values are >2x ULN , the event must be reported in the e-CRF on the specific AE form for “Increased Lipase and/or Amylase >2x ULN” and the specific forms, using the appropriate verbatim: eg, “increased amylase and/or lipase” in 
case of isolated enzyme eleva tion, “suspected pancreatitis” in the presence of clinical signs 
evocative of pancreatitis if the diagnosis is suspected but cannot be c onfirmed or excluded, and 
“pancreatitis” if the diagnosis has been confirmed.

10.6.5 Management of patients with increased calcitonin values 
During the course of the study, if a calcitonin value is found ≥20 pg/mL (5.9 pmol/L): 
• A retest should be performed by the central laboratory within 7 days. In addition, blood should be collected and sent to the central laboratory for measurement of: calcium, phosphorus, gastrin, Thyroid Stimulating Hormone  (TSH), and anti-thyroid peroxidase 
(anti-TPO) antibodies; 
• The clinical and laboratory documentations lis ted below are to be collected and recorded 
in source documents as soon as possible: 
- Potential false positive circumstances: smoking status, proton-pump inhibitor 
treatments (eg, omeprazole), autoimmune thyroid diseases (Hashimoto’s thyroiditis or Graves’ disease), differentiated thyroid cancer, hypercalcemia, hypergastrinemia, 
chronic renal insufficiency (not on dialysis), other neuro-endocrine tumors (small cell lung cancer, intestinal carcinoid), acute pu lmonary inflammatory conditions, or sepsis. 
- Specific personal and/or familial medical history in relation to thyroid or other endocrine diseases; 
- Specific physical examination (neck, thyroid gland). 
If the retest confirms that the calcitonin value is ≥20 pg/mL: 
• The event must be reported in the e-CRF on the specific AE form and specific complementary form for “increased calcitonin ≥20 pg/mL” with all appropriate clinical 
and laboratory documentation. 
• An ultrasound scan of the thyroid should be perfo rmed and the patient may be referred to a 
thyroid specialist if judged necessary. 
• The patient should continue to  be followed according to protocol schedule (including 
planned calcitonin measurements). The specific AE form “increased calcitonin ≥20 pg/mL 
(5.9 pmol/L)” should be updated with any new information collected during the follow up. 
• If a calcitonin value ≥50 pg/mL (14.75 pmol/L) is found at any time during further follow 
up, the patient should be permanently discontinued from IMP (see Section  10.3.4) and 
referred to a specialist. As far as possible,  blood should be collected 1 to 2 weeks after 
IMP discontinuation and sent to the central  laboratory for calcitonin measurement. 
• If at any time during follow-up a calcitonin value ≥20 pg/mL increases by 20% or more 
between 2 assessments (while remaining below 50 pg/mL), a repeated measurement should be performed earlier than scheduled in the protocol, ie, 1 month later. Once results 
are available, discussion with Sponsor s hould be initiated without  delay for further 
guidance.

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 97 10.6.6 Monitoring of renal function in case of prolonged and severe nausea and vomiting 
In case of prolonged or severe nausea and vomiting, if clinically indicated, serum creatinine 
measurement has to be centrally performed. If there is an acute increase of serum creatinine, metformin has to be di scontinued until resolution of renal dysfunction. 
10.6.7 Follow-up of laboratory abnormalities 
Decision trees for the management of certain laboratory abnormalities are provided in Appendix B . 
10.6.8 Monitoring of device-related events 
A device-related event (DRE) includes any suspected problem with the injection device(s) used in 
the study which has or may lead to a health haza rd (eg, adverse event). Typical problems include 
pen performance failure, patient (or caregiver) havi ng difficulty understanding the instructions or 
using the pen or auto-injector, use error, etc. 
Examples of device-related events include but are not limited to: 
• Dosing problems: jamming, inability to inject, partial injection, need to repeat injection, 
dosage knob stuck; 
• Needle issues: difficulty attaching the needle; 
• Breakage of the pen; 
• Mix-up of pens/devices (patient injects using a pen/device different than the intended one); 
• Difficulty to understand the instructions in the product instructions leaflet; 
• Use error: Incorrect use of the pen/device by the patient/caregiver/healthcare provider. 
Device-related events will be pro-actively monitore d during the study by asking at each study visit 
whether the patient/caregiver experienced any DRE. If answer is yes, the specific e-CRF Device-
Related Event Questionnaire (DREQ) will be completed. 
If the device-related event is associated with a symptomatic hypoglycemic event, a hyperglycemic 
adverse event or another adverse event, the corresponding symptomatic hypoglycemic forms or 
adverse event forms must also be completed. This associated adverse event will be qualified as a 
serious adverse event only if it fulfills seriousness criteria, and in this case, the SAE reporting 
procedure (see Section  10.4.3, Instructions for reporting se rious adverse events) should be 
followed. 
As needed, further instruction and troubleshooting guidance should be provided to the patient by 
the study site according to the instructiona l materials/troubleshooting guide provided by the 
Sponsor. For device-related events, related to Solostar Pe n for patients on FRC, that are not resolved by 
further guidance/review of instructions or troubl eshooting with the pen during the visit (on site 
visit or phone visit), a PTC form must be comple ted, the pen associated with the event should be

11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
The sample size calculations are based on the primary efficacy variable change in HbA1c from 
baseline to Week 26 and intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis, with the following assumptions: 
• A common standard deviation of 1.1%; 
• A 0.4% mean difference between FRC and GLP- 1 receptor agonist in change in HbA1c 
from baseline to Week 26; 
• A drop-out rate of 20%; The F RC dropped patients are assumed to  respond the same as the 
control patients, ie, no trea tment difference between the FRC dropped patients and the 
control patients; 
• A t-test at a 2-sided 5% signific ance level with at least 90% power. 
Based on the above assumptions, 500 patients (250 per group) are needed for this study. 
Calculations were made using nQuery Advisor® 7.0. 
11.2 DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS 
The total number of patients for each of the following categories will be presented in the CSR: 
• Screened patients: patients who ha ve signed the informed consent;

11.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS 
11.3.1 Efficacy populations 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the treatment group allocated by the IRT according to the 
randomization schedule at randomiz ation visit (as randomized), irrespective of the treatment 
actually received. 
11.3.1.1 Modified intent-to-treat population 
Efficacy analyses will be based on the mITT popu lation, defined as all ra ndomized patients who 
have both a baseline assessment and at least one  post-baseline assessment of any primary or 
secondary efficacy variables, irrespective of compliance with the study protocol and procedures. Patients will be analyzed for efficacy analyses a ccording to the treatment group to which they are 
randomized. 
11.3.2 Safety population 
Safety analyses will be based on the safety population, defined as all randomized patients who 
receive at least one dose of open-label IMP (rega rdless of the amount of treatment administered). 
Patients will be analyzed for safety analyses  according to the treatment actually received. 
In addition: 
• Nonrandomized but treated patie nts will not be part of the safety population, but their 
safety data will be presented separately; 
• Randomized patients for whom it is unclear whether they took the study medication will 
be included in the safety population as randomized;

• Medical history of cardiovascul ar and cerebrovascular events; 
• Medical history of allergies; 
• Subject family allergy history; 
• Alcohol habits within the last 12 months; 
• Smoking habits.  
Medical and surgical history will be coded using the version of Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) currently in effect at Sanofi at the time of database lock. Medical history of 
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events and medical history of allergies will be summarized by searching for relevant “preferred term (PT) ” identified by medical and coding teams. 
No statistical test will be performed for the between-group difference on demographic and 
baseline characteristics (inc luding medical history and baseline efficacy data). 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics, baseline efficacy variables and medical history and medical findings will be summarized with appropriate descriptive statistics. Pathologies associated with past medical or surgical hist ory will be summarized by primary system organ 
class (SOC) and high level term (HLT). Th ese summaries will be provided on randomized 
patients for each treatment group (and overall). 
11.4.2 Prior and concomitant medications 
All medications will be coded using the version of World Health Organization-Drug Dictionary 
(WHO-DD) currently in effect at Sanofi at the time of database lock. 
Medications will be classified into the following three groups: 
• Prior medications are those the patient took prio r to the first injection of open-label IMP; 
• Concomitant medications are those the patient continued or started on or after the first 
dose of open-label IMP up to 3 days after the la st injection of daily IMP or 9 days after the 
last injection of weekly IMP); 
• Post-treatment medications are those the patie nt continued or started on or after 4 days 
after the last injection of daily IMP or 10 days  after the last injection of weekly IMP.

according to the WHO-DD, considering the first digit of the ATC class (anatomic category) and 
the first three digits of the ATC class (therape utic category). All ATC codes corresponding to a 
medication will be summarized, pa tients will be counted once in each ATC categories (anatomic 
or therapeutic) linked to the medication, therefor e patients may be counted  several time for the 
same medication. 
Summaries of prior, concomitant and post-treatment medications will be presented on randomized 
patients for each treatment group (and overall for the summary of prior medications) using counts 
and percentages. No statistical test for the between-group difference will be performed. 
11.4.3 Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 
The extent of study treatment exposure and compliance will be assessed and summarized by actual treatment received in the safety population. 
11.4.3.1 Extent of investigational medicinal product exposure 
The extent of study treatment exposure will be assessed by the duration of treatment exposure 
during the study. 
The duration of treatment exposure will be the total number of days of administration of the open-
label investigationa l medicinal product, rega rdless of unplanned inte rmittent discontinuations. 
The duration of daily IMP exposure will be calculated as: 
(Date of the last open-label IM P injection – Date of the firs t open-label IMP injection) + 1. 
The duration of weekly IMP exposure will be calculated as: (Date of the last open-label IM P injection – Date of the firs t open-label IMP injection) + 7. 
The number (%) of patients randomized and exposed to the open-label IMP will be presented by 
specific time periods for each treatment group in  the safety population. The time periods of 
interest are grouped as follows: 
• 1 to 14 days; 
• 15 to 28 days; 
• 29 to 56 days; 
• 57 to 84 days; 
• 85 to 126 days;

11.4.3.2 Compliance 
Overall treatment compliance is defined as the actual number of days with IMP injection 
compared to the planned number of days with IMP injection during the open-label treatment 
period, up to treatment discontinua tion. It is calculated according to the following formula:

11.4.4 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the mI TT population using efficacy assessment obtained 
during the study, including those obtained afte r IMP discontinuation or introduction of rescue 
therapy, unless otherwise specified. 
For a patient to be included in a change from baseline analysis (endpoint – baseline) or a baseline 
adjusted analysis of an endpoint, the patient  must have both a base line and a post-baseline 
measurement for that endpoint. 
11.4.4.1 Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint 
See Section  9.1.1. 
Primary analysis 
The statistical test will be two-sided tests at a nominal 5% significance level. 
The primary efficacy endpoint (change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26) will be analyzed 
using a mixed-effect model with repeated measures (MMRM) under the missing at random

Property of the Sanofi Group - strictly confidential Page 106 framework. The MMRM model will include treatme nt group (FRC or GLP-1 receptor agonist), 
randomization strata of HbA1c (<8%, ≥8%) at V1 (Week -2), randomization strata of GLP-1 
receptor agonist subtype (once/twice daily formul ations, once weekly formul ations) at screening, 
visit (Week 8, Week 12, Week 18, Week 22 and W eek 26), treatment-by-vi sit interaction and 
world region as fixed effects, and baseline HbA1c value-by-visit interaction as the covariates. The 
adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline to Week 26 for each treatment group will be 
estimated in the framework of this model, as well as the between group difference and the 95% 
confidence interval (CI) for the adjusted mean.  
The MMRM model will be implemented  using Statistical analysis system (SAS®) (Version 9.4 or 
higher) MIXED procedure (PROC MIXED) with an  unstructured correlation matrix to model the 
within-patient errors. Parame ters will be estimated using th e restricted maximum likelihood 
method with the Newton-Raphson algorithm. Deno minator degree of fr eedom will be estimated 
using the Kenward-Roger approximation by fitting values from post-randomization scheduled 
visits in the 26-week randomized treatment period. This model will use only scheduled HbA1c 
measurements. 
Sensitivity analyses 
The following sensitivity analyses will be performed for the primary endpoint: 
• The same MMRM model as described in the primary analysis will also be performed by 
including only the scheduled HbA1c measurements collected during the 26-week on-treatment period (see  Section 9.2). 
• A sensitivity analysis will also be conduc ted on the 26-week completers in mITT 
population (ie, all mITT patients who comp leted the 26-week open-label randomized 
treatment period and did not st art any rescue therapy before the end of the 26 week 
randomized treatment period) using the obs erved Week 26 values and the same MMRM 
model as described above. 
• To investigate the impact of rescue medica tion, the same MMRM mode l as described in 
the primary analysis will be performed by excluding the measurements after receiving the rescue medication. 
• In order for patients with missing data to be  adequately represented by the patients with 
data, a sensitivity analysis using multiple imputations with respect to jump to control under the MNAR assumption will be  performed. In particular,  
- For patients in the GLP1-RA group who have no HbA1c values at Week 26, the missing data will be considered as missing at random. Missing HbA1c values in this situation will be imputed by the regre ssion method using the observed data from  
GLP-1 RA group. The regression imputati on model will include baseline HbA1c 
values and randomization strata.  
- For patients in the FRC group who have no HbA1c value at Week 26, the missing 
HbA1c values will be imputed using baselin e HbA1c values, randomization strata and 
coefficients generated from the regression m odel in the GLP-1 RA group plus an error. 
The error term will be randomly drawn from normal distribution with mean zero and a standard deviation. The standa rd deviation of the normal di stribution will be calculated

FRC group will be generated using the obser ved data from FRC group and will include 
baseline HbA1c values a nd randomization strata.  
- Missing HbA1c values at Week 26 will be im puted 100 times to genera te 100 data sets 
with complete HbA1c values at Week 26. The change from baseline to Week 26 will 
be derived from observed and imputed HbA1c values at this time point. The completed data sets will be analyzed using an Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment groups, randomization strata, and world region as  factors and the baseline 
HbA1c value as a covariate. The results fro m the 100 analyses will be combined using 
SAS PROC MIANALYZE. 
Assessment of treatment effect by subgroup 
Descriptive analyses will be performed on the primary endpoint to summarize the treatment 
effects across subgroups defined by the fo llowing baseline or screening factors: 
• Race; 
• Ethnicity (Hispanic, Not Hispanic); 
• Age group (<50, ≥50 to <65, ≥ 65 to <75, ≥ 75 years of age); 
• Gender; 
• Baseline BMI level (<30, ≥30 kg/m2); 
• Baseline GLP-1 receptor agonist subtype (once/twice daily formulations, once weekly 
formulations); 
• Baseline HbA1c (<8%, ≥8%); 
• Pioglitazone use (Yes, No) at screening; 
• World region; 
• Country. 
The treatment effects across the subgroups defined for each of these factors will be estimated for 
the change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c in the mITT population, and using the MMRM approach with treatment group (F RC or GLP-1 receptor agonist), randomization strata of HbA1c 
(<8%, ≥ 8%) at V1 (Week -2), randomization strata of GLP-1 receptor agonist subtype (once/twice 
daily formulations, once weekly formulations) at screening vis it, subgroup factor, treatment-by-
visit, treatment-by-subgroup factor, visit-by-subgroup factor, treatment-by-visit-by-subgroup factor, and world region as fixed effects, and us ing the baseline HbA1c value-by-visit interaction 
as a covariate. The adjusted estimates of treatment mean differences (FRC versus GLP-1 receptor agonist) with standard errors and 95% CIs will be provided as appropria te across the subgroups. 
In case that the subgroup factor is identical or similar to a randomization stra ta factor (eg, baseline 
HbA1c category and GLP-1 RA category), only th e subgroup factor will be included in the model 
in order to avoid collinearity issue in the analysis.

A similar MMRM model will also be used to estima te the within-group treatment effect for the 
change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c for the following subgroups: 
• Anti-lixisenatide antibody status (positive, ne gative) at the end of 26-week treatment; 
• Anti-insulin glargine antibody status (positive, negative) at the end of 26-week treatment;  
• Anti-lixisenatide antibody concentration at th e end of 26-week treatment: <lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ), ≥ LLOQ to 100 nmol/L, >100 nmol/L. 
The adjusted means for each treatment gr oup will be provided across the subgroups as 
appropriate, as well as the associated standa rd errors and 95% confidence intervals. 
The change of HbA1c from baseline over time by visit will be evaluated by descriptive statistics 
(mean, SD, median and ranges) by  treatment for the 26-week randomized treatment period and for 
FRC group for the whole study period including the extension period. 
11.4.4.2 Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints 
Descriptive statistics (number, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, and maximum) will be provided by treatment for all continuous secondary variables defined in Section  9.2.1 at the 
scheduled visits for the 26-week randomized treatment period. For continuous variables in the extension period defined in  Section  9.2.1, descriptive statistics will be provided for FRC group at 
the scheduled visits for the whole stud y period including the extension period. 
Except for 2-hour PPG and glucose excursion, all continuous secondary efficacy endpoints at 
Week 26 defined in Section  9.2.1 will be analyzed using the same MMRM approach as described 
in Section  11.4.4.1 to compare FRC with GLP-1 receptor agonist. This model will include fixed 
effect terms including treatment group (FRC or GL P-1 receptor agonist), randomization strata of 
HbA1c (<8%, ≥8%) at V1 (Week -2), randomization strata of GLP-1 receptor agonist subtype 
(once/twice daily formulations, once weekly fo rmulations) at screening, scheduled visit, 
treatment-by-visit interaction, and world region, and the covariate of baseline value-by-visit 
interaction. Means and adjusted means of each  treatment group will be provided, as well as 
adjusted mean and associated two-sided 95% CI of the differences between treatment groups. The 
statistical tests for between-group differences will be two-sided at th e alpha level of 0.05. The 
analyses include all scheduled measurements collected during the 26-week randomized treatment period including those obtained after IMP discontinuation or resc ue medication use. 
2-hour PPG and glucose excursion, for which onl y one post baseline measurement is scheduled, 
will be analyzed using the similar ANCOVAwith the missing data at Week 26 imputed by LOCF 
as described in Section  11.4.4.1 to compare FRC with GLP-1 receptor agonist. This model will 
include fixed effect terms including treatment group (FRC or GLP-1 receptor agonist), randomization strata of HbA1c (<8%, ≥8%) at V1 (Week -2), randomization strata of GLP-1

taking the last available post-baseline collect ed during the 26-week randomized treatment period 
as the value at Week 26. 
All categorical secondary efficacy endpoints defined for the 26-week randomized treatment 
period in Section  9.2.1 will be analyzed using a Coch ran-Mantel-Haensz el (CMH) method 
stratified on randomization strata of HbA1c (<8%, ≥ 8%) and randomization strata of GLP-1 
receptor agonist subtype (once/twice daily formul ations, once weekly form ulations) at screening 
visit (V1, Week -2). The proportion in each tr eatment group will be provided, as well as the 
difference of proportions between groups with a ssociated 2-sided 95% CI. For the categorical 
secondary endpoints in which HbA1c is assessed at  Week 26, all values at Week 26 will be used 
to determine whether a patient is a responder or  not, even if they are measured after IMP 
discontinuation or introduction or re scue therapy. If no assessment is available at Week 26 at all, 
patients will be treated as  failures (non-responders).  For the categorical secondary endpoints 
defined for the extension period in Section  9.2.1, counts and percentages will be summarized 
using all data available at Week  52, with patients having data missing at Week 52 treated as non-
responders. 
11.4.4.3 Multiplicity considerations 
To control the type I error, a step-down testing procedure (please see Figure 1 ) will be applied.  
For the primary efficacy endpoint (change from baseline to Week 26 in HbA1c), no multiplicity 
adjustment is needed to control the Type I error since only one comparison of FRC versus GLP-1 
receptor agonist will be performed. 
If the primary variable is statistically significant at the 5% level, a hierarchical testing procedure 
will be performed to test the following secondary efficacy variables in the following prioritized 
order. Testing will stop when an endpoint is found not to be statistically significant at the 5% 
level: 
1. Percentage of patients reaching HbA1c <7% at Week 26. 
2. Change in FPG from baseline to Week 26. 
3. Change in the daily average of the 7- point SMPG from baseline to Week 26. 
4. Change in 2-hour Post Pra ndial Glucose (PPG) and/or glucose excursion during the 
standardized meal test from baseline to Week 26.

11.4.6.4 Analyses of vital sign variables 
See Section  9.2.2.4. 
The number and percentage of patients with PCSA at any evaluation during the on-treatment 
period will be summarized for each vital sign  parameter within each treatment group. The 
summaries will include patients in  the safety population who have at least one parameter to be 
analyzed during the on-treatment period. When th e PCSA definition involves the change from the 
baseline value, patients need also to have a ba seline value to be included in the summaries.  
Descriptive statistics w ill be used to summarize the results  for systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure and heart rate, and the changes from baseline by visit and for the last on-treatment value 
within each treatment group.  
Tabular and graphical methods may be used to present the results for parameters of interest. Listings will be provided with flags indicating the PCSA values.

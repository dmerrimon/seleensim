 1  GDM2 Trial Final Statistical Analysis Plan  
Study Design & Objectives 1. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) affects approximately 5 to 
7% of pregnancies and is associ ated with increased risk for fetal overgrowth, cesarean delivery, 
birth trauma, and pre -eclampsia. GDM is commonly diagnosed in the US using a two -step 
screening and confirmatory approach, whereas a one -step approach is commonly used outside 
the US. Recent  guidelines have suggested that the one -step approach should be used to diagnose 
GDM, although concern that this may increase the prevalence of GDM to approximately 18% —
as well as the lack of clinical trials -based evidence regarding the difference in perin atal 
outcomes –has led to skepticism about adopting the one -step approach. The Comparison of Two 
Screening Strategies for Gestational Diabetes (GDM2) Trial is a single -center, parallel -arm, 
comparative effectiveness trial of one -step versus two -step GDM scr eening strategies on the rate 
of adverse perinatal outcomes including: large -for-gestational age (LGA) deliveries (primary 
outcome), small -for-gestational age (SGA), macrosomia, cesarean delivery, fetal growth and 
body composition, and maternal and neonata l composite outcomes. This paper describes the 
design and analysis plan of the GDM2 Trial as well as overall challenges in assessing the impact 
of screening and diagnosis strategy on adverse pregnancy outcomes. We will also assess whether 
the additional wo men diagnosed with the one -step approach benefit from treatment as assessed 
by metabolic profiles at one year postpartum. Ultimately, this study will provide the necessary 
evidence for establishing universal guidelines for GDM diagnosis and implementation into 
clinical care.  The impetus for the GDM2 Trial is that women with mild glucose intolerance who 
are otherwise considered normal by the two -step approach would be identified by the one -step 
approach and subsequently treated with anticipated improved peri natal outcomes. The primary 
hypothesis is twofold : 1) Using an intention -to-treat approach, we will assess whether women 
diagnosed with the GDM one -step diagnostic approach have lower rates of LGA compared to 
those randomized to the two -step approach ; and 2) We hypothesize that women classified as 
“No GDM” by the one -step approach will have lower rates of LGA compared to their 
counterparts in the two -step approach . We will also follow up a sub -cohort of women at one year 
postpartum where we hypothesize that  women diagnosed with the one -step approach will have 
better metabolic profiles, compared to the two -step approach.  
 
The GDM2 Trial is a single -center, parallel -arm, comparative effectiveness trial comparing two 
GDM screening strategies (one -step versus two -step approach) on the rate of adverse perinatal 
outcomes (e.g. large for gestational age [LGA], macrosomia) and differences at one year 
postpartum in the mothers' metabolic profiles and the infants' growth. We recruit women from 
24 to 28 weeks G A to receive a one -hour, 50 g screening test; these women are then randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to either the two -hour, 75 g or three -hour, 100 g diagnostic test. Women and their 
infants are followed for up to one year postpartum.  
 
Sample Size Calculation.  The first co -primary hypothesis compares LGA incidence between 
screening methods. We expect to see the rate of LGA in the two -step approach (regardless of 
GDM diagnoses) to be approximately 15%, similar to that observed in a previous cohort study. 
To detect an absolute risk reduction of 7% (to 8% in the one -step approach) for LGA, a sample 
size of 460 per arm is required accounting for 15% participant attrition. The absolute risk 
reduction and corresponding odds ratio is considered small to moderate.  
 
For the  second co -primary hypothesis, we anticipate 84% (n = 329) of women in the one -step 
arm and 95% (n = 372) of those in the two -step arm will be classified as “No GDM”. Based on an 
estimated rate of LGA of approximately 13% among the “No GDM” women in the tw o-step arm, 
our anticipated sample size yields at least 80% power to detect a 7.1% absolute risk difference 
between screening arms. Since the analysis of the second hypothesis will be conducted on a 
subset of women after randomization, there could be imbal ances between the “No GDM” groups 
 2 in both arms on baseline characteristics. The magnitude of this imbalance will be quantified by a 
variance inflation factor (VIF), which is the coefficient of determination when the study arms 
(one -step versus two -step) ar e regressed on the covariates of interest. Assuming a large VIF, the 
detectable risk difference of LGA and macrosomia increases to 8.3%. To preserve an overall type 
I error of 5%, each of the co -primary hypotheses will be conducted at the 2.5% significance  
level.    
  
Interim & Final Analyses.   This study  will not have planned interim looks for the primary 
outcome. The final analyses will be conducted once study follow -up is complete, after all data is 
cleaned, and once the study database is locked.   
 
Hypoth eses.  The primary hypothesis is twofold : 1) Using an intention -to-treat approach, we 
will assess whether women diagnosed with the GDM one -step diagnostic approach have lower 
rates of LGA compared to those randomized to the two -step approach ; and 2) We hypothesize 
that women classified as “No GDM” by the one -step approach will have lower rates of LGA 
compared to their counterparts in the two -step approach . We will also follow up a sub -cohort of 
women at one year postpartum where we hypothesiz e that women diagnosed with the one -step 
approach will have better metabolic profiles, compared to the two -step approach.   
 
Analysis Sets. The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be based on an intention -to-treat (ITT) 
analysis, where all women are analyzed accor ding to the study arm they were randomized to.  
The Per-Protocol ( PP) analysis set will be defined as women who received the screening method 
they were randomized to. The As -Treated (AT) analysis set will be the same as the FAS, but the 
women will be analyz ed according to the screening method they actually received.  The Safety 
Analysis Set (SAS) will be a subset of the FAS and include all women who competed the 
intervention.

 3 delivery; 4) fetal growth and body composition outcomes (length, weight, and head 
circumference of the baby); 5) a maternal composite outcome; and 6) a neonatal composite 
outcome.   
     
Handling of Missing Values.  Reasons for attrition will be investigated at the time 
participants undergo the oral glucose tolerance test ( OGTT ), as well as at the end of the study. 
Missing outcome data will be investigated to see if they are ignorable, but we do not anticipate 
this to be an issue due to the integrated EHR system to ascertain clinical outcomes. If 
appropriate, we will consider various approaches to account for missing data, such as multiple 
imputations. Much of the missing data involving the outcomes of interest will be constrained by 
the natural design of the stud y, which includes a short time frame between study visits and the 
use of electronic health records to obtain pregnancy outcomes and healthcare utilization.   
 
Statistical Analyses. Each of the primary and secondary outcomes will be described within 
each study arm using sample means or sample proportions along with 95% confidence intervals. 
Continuous outcomes will be assessed for departures from normality, and suitable 
transformations will be used if needed. Demographic and clinical characteristics will b e 
compared between arms at baseline using two -sample t -tests and chi -square tests, as 
appropriate. Any variables that are significantly associated with either study arm will be 
included as covariates in primary and secondary analyses. Secondary and explora tory outcomes 
will be analyzed at the 5% significance level.  
 
Primary co -hypothesis : The primary analyses will use a logistic regression model to quantify the 
probability of LGA as a function of the study arm (one -step versus two -step) and clinic type 
(resident versus non -resident). For the first co -primary hypothesis, all of the women 
randomized will be considered in the analysis, while only the women classified as “No GDM” 
will be considered for the analysis of the second co -primary hypothesis. To preserv e an overall 
type I error of 5%, each of the co -primary hypotheses will be conducted at the 2.5% significance 
level.  Analyses of the secondary perinatal outcomes of cesarean delivery, fetal growth, and the 
maternal and neonatal composite outcome variables will use a logistic regression model to 
quantify the probability of the outcome as a function of the study arm and clinic type. We will 
use a linear regression model for the fetal growth and body composition outcomes.  Finally, we 
will compare the proportio n of women with serious adverse events (SAEs) between study arms 
using logistic regression.  
 
Secondary hypothesis : A secondary hypothesis is that women who undergo testing with the one -
step approach will have greater improvements in their metabolic profile  (cytokines, weight 
change, insulin resistance, and beta cell function) at one year postpartum compared to women 
in the two -step approach, because more women will be diagnosed with and treated for GDM. 
Metabolic profiles will be analyzed using linear regre ssion with the change in outcome at one 
year postpartum modeled as a function of the study arm, clinic type, and any baseline covariates 
that significantly differ between arms. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) will be used to model 
the one -year metabolic pr ofile as a function of baseline metabolic profile, study arm, clinic type, 
and any baseline covariates related to study arm.  
 
Secondary and Exploratory Analyses : The rate of healthcare utilization variables will be 
compared between screening arms using Poi sson regression due to the count -nature of these 
outcomes. We will use logistic regression to model the outcomes of labor induction and 
admission to the neonatal intensive care unit, as well as to compare the rate of 6 - to 12 -week 
postpartum diabetes melli tus testing between screening arms. Finally, we will assess the 
sensitivity and specificity of the one -hour, 50 g GCT against each of the OGTT study arms.

Trial design Phase Ia is an open-label, dose escalation study of BI 905711 
administered intravenously. The  eligible patient population will be 
patients with advanced refractory  gastrointestinal cancers. Dose 
escalation will be guided by a Bayesian logistic regression model with overdose control. Pharmac okinetics and efficacy will be 
evaluated to guide determination of a potentially effective dose range for phase Ib.
Phase Ib is a randomised, open label study to determine safety and 
efficacy of BI 905711 in the expansion cohorts of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients and pancreatic cancer (PDAC) patients. CRC

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 201712For phase Ia, an archival tumor tissue is mandatory.
13In CRC patients, [18F]FDG-PET/CT should be performed at baseline within 14 days (±7 days) prior to treatment start (Cycle 1 Day 1). A second [18F]FDG-PET/CT will be performed at the 8-
week tumor assessment timepoint. It may be performed together with standard CT assessment if feasible.
14After the individual patient’s end of the trial, the investigator should report only any occurrence of cancer, related SAEs and related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of and 
only via the SAE form, see Section 5.2.6.2.1 .
15Tumor assessment should include CT scans or MRI of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and if clinically indicated imaging of any other  known or suspected sites of disease (e.g. brain, bone). The 
same radiographic procedure must be used throughout the study. Tumor assessment does not need to be performed at the Screening v isit if there are valid results available from assessments 
which were performed as part of routine clinical practice within 28 days prior to start of treatment.  Repeat tumor assessment w ill be performed every 8 weeks (± 7 days) until progression or 
start of further treatment for disease: Repeat imaging at > 4 weeks to confirm response. In the event of early discontinuation for reasons other than progressive disea se or interruption/delay of treatment the tumor assessment 
schedule should not be changed. If the patient’s cancer is being monitored with a specific tumor marker (e.g. CEA, CA19.9, etc. ), tumor marker levels should be obtained at baseline, and at 
every protocol-specified tumor assessment timepoint.
16During phase Ia only , a brain MRI should be performed at baseline and repeated as clinically indicated. Brain MRI does not need to be performed at screening if there are results available 
from a brain MRI performed within 12 weeks prior to start of treatment. In case of contraindication for MRI, a brain CT scan can be performed after agreement between the investigator and 
Sponsor.
17To evaluate Exclusion criteria #13 , only in cases where the Investigator (or the treating physician or both) suspects cardiac disease with negative effect on the  ejection fraction (EF), the EF 
will be measured during screening using an appropriate method according to local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g., echoca rdiogram, multigated acquisition scan). A historic measurement of 
EF no older than 6 months prior to first administration of study drug can be accepted provided that there is clinical evidence that the EF value has not worsened since this measurement in the 
opinion of the Investigator or of the treating physician or both. Echocardiography (or multigated acquisition scan) may be perfo rmed at any time during the study if clinically indicated.

(**) Patients who discontinue trial treatment prematurely should undergo the End of Treatment (EOT) visit as soon as possible. If assessments due at EOT are not completed, they may be 
performed at the 30-Day Safety FUP Visit. 
(***) The 30-Day Safety Followup visit is the End of Residual Effect Period visit (EOR) which must happen at the earliest 30 (+ 5) da ys after the last dose of treatment (see Section 6.2.3.2 ). 
ǂAdditional follow-up visits for progression after the 30-Day safety follow-up visit will be performed for patients who disconti nue for reasons other than progression or death. Follow-up 
continues until progression per the imaging schedule (see Section 5.1 ).  The follow-up visits for survival status will be performed every 12 weeks (+/-7 days)(in person or by telephone) until 
death, lost to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or end of the whole trial (see Section 6.2.3.3 ).
βThe interval between two dose administrations must be always at least 7 days with the exception of the interval between dose adm inistration on Day 1 of an even-numbered cycle and Day 1 of 
the subsequent odd-number cycle which must always be at least 14 days (e.g. Cycle 2 Day 1 and Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1 and Cycle 5 Day 1, etc.). 
1Written informed consent must be obtained before any protocol specific screening assessments are performed. Re-consenting may b ecome necessary when new relevant information becomes 
available and should be conducted according to the Sponsor’s instructions. Separate consent is to be obtained for optional biom arker sampling.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 201714After the individual patient’s end of the trial, the investigator should report only any occurrence of cancer, related SAEs and  related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of and 
only via the SAE form, see Section 5.2.6.2.1 .
15Tumor assessment should include CT scans or MRI of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and if clinically indicated imaging of any other  known or suspected sites of disease (e.g. brain, bone). The 
same radiographic procedure must be used throughout the study. At least one prior pre-study digital scan of the target lesion s hould be sent to the central imaging facility of an independent 
vendor if available. Tumor assessment does not need to be performed at the Screening visit if there are valid results available  from assessments which were performed as part of routine clinical 
practice within 28 days prior to start of treatment.  Repeat tumor assessment will be performed every 8 weeks (± 7 days) until p rogression or start of further treatment for disease: 
Repeat imaging at > 4 weeks to confirm response. In the event of early discontinuation for reasons other than progressive disea se or interruption/delay of treatment the tumor assessment 
schedule should not be changed. 
16Patient’s cancer will be monitored with a specific tumor marker (e.g. CEA, CA19.9, etc.). Tumor marker levels should be obtained a t baseline, and at every protocol-specified tumor 
assessment timepoint.
17A patient will receive BI 905711 as a single administration every week for 3 weeks on, 1 week off (refer to Section 4.1.2.2 ).
18Required only for phase Ib PDAC cohort. SV1 and SV2 can occur in parallel.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 20171. INTRODUCTION
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Tumor cell death and apoptosis can be induced by activation of the extrinsic pathway via 
targeting TRAIL receptors ( R16-1878 ). TRAILR2 pathway represents a valid opportunity for 
cancer treatment, but it has not been successful in the clinic so far. Multiple clinical trials with 
conventional antibodies against TRAILR2 indicated minimal clinical activity with no toxicity,and these compounds have been discontinued ( P16-04691 ).
Targeting TRAILR2 requires agonistic properties of a potential drug candidate, and this is 
difficult to achieve with conventional antibodies ( R17-2985 ). Available data suggest that 
activation of TRAIL receptor depends not only on binding of the ligand to the receptor but 
require formation of complex higher level receptor-ligand multimeric structures. Suchreceptor clustering is critical for generation of an adequate signal capable of down-stream propagation and apoptosis induction ( R17-2986 ). Agonistic properties of conventional 
TRAILR2 targeting antibodies can be highly enhanced by antibody immobilisation via 
binding of their Fc part on the solid surface in-vitro or FcR cross-linking on membrane of the 
tumor infiltrating immune cells in-vivo (R17-2987 ). It is likely that first generation 
conventional TRAILR2 antibodies had very weak and inconsistent agonistic potential for 
TRAILR2 in human clinical trials related to the above mentioned reasons e.g. high level of endogenous immunoglobulins that were effectively competing for Fc gamma receptors on immune cells in-vivo and/or low and a variable number of immune cells in the tumormicroenvironment ( P16-04691 ).
New pharmacological approaches are needed that would overcome above mentioned 
limitation of conventional antibodies and capable to activate TRAIL receptors independently of Fc interactions. BI 905711 is a tetravalent bispecific molecule targeting both TRAILR2 and CDH17, and it is designed to selectively induce apoptosis in CDH17 expressing tumor cells via the CDH17-dependent clustering of TRAILR2. CDH17 is a cell surface molecule expressed in adenocarcinomas of gastrointestinal origin ( R18-1615 ). Via the CDH17-
dependent clustering of TRAILR2, BI 905711 induces the pro-apoptotic activity 
independently of additional cross-linking ( R17-4112 ) and selectively in CDH17 expressing 
tumor cells. The L234A/L235A mutation was incorporated to specifically avoid CDH17-
independent crosslinking by ablating binding to Fc #R and complements.
BI 905711 has the potential to provide a therapeutic window and avoid hepatotoxicity associated with clustering of TRAILR2 and apoptosis in the liver ( R16-1795 ) due to the lack 
of detectable CDH17 protein in non-neoplastic liver tissue ( R17-2598 ).The limited set of 
non-neoplastic tissues with CDH17 expression (small intestine, colon, gastric mucosa, gall 
bladder and pancreas ducts) should be spared from apoptosis and tissue damage due to their insensitivity to TRAILR2 activation ( R17-4113 , R16-4563 ).
Potential indications for BI 905711 include gastrointestinal cancers expressing CDH17: 
colorectal cancer, gastric cancer, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer and biliary tract cancers as indicated in Table 1.1: 1

* Method and threshold for CDH17-positivity by IHC vary between reports. For BI’s prevalence study, positive

#only metastatic samples  
Colorectal cancer (CRC) consistently expresses CDH17 at a high or intermediate level by 
immunohistochemistry in primary tumors and metastatic sites ( R17-2598 , R18-1615 ). High 
CDH17 expression in CRC was confirmed in a BI prevalence study where metastatic CRC
samples showed CDH17 expression in 100 % of the samples analyzed (n=39), and 97% of the samples showed CDH17 expression on over 50% of the tumor cells (77% of samples with >90% positive cells). Expression of CDH17 in gastric cancer, oesophageal adenocarcinoma, pancreatic cancer and biliary tract cancers is more variable.
The rate of positive CRC tumors with ≥5% CDH17 positive cells in 1412-0001 phase 1a was 
95%, with 78.5% being double-positive for CDH17/TRAILR2 (data on file). 
It is important to recognize that BI 905711 can potentially activate TRAILR2 on both CDH17 
positive tumor cells and adjacent tumor cells (cis- and trans-activation). BI 905711 can therefore induce TRAILR2 activation in the CDH17 negative cells if surrounded by CDH17 positive cells. Nevertheless, possible correlation between quantitative CDH17 expression and efficacy will be explored in this study.

Brochure (IB).    
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
Mode of action
BI 905711 is tetravalent bispecific antibody specifically designed to have potent agonistic 
activity via the CDH17-dependent clustering of TRAILR2 and therefore induces apoptosis in CDH17 expressing tumor cells. Refer also to the IB for additional details ( c16856466 ).

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017CDH17 is a cell surface molecule expressed in different gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas 
(R17-4114 ). In humans, CDH17 is also present in normal cells of stomach, intestine, pancreas 
and gall bladder, but it is not expressed in liver tissue. Normal GI tissues were shown to be 
resistant to TRAILR2 induced apoptosis ( R16-4563 ) while the liver may be sensitive to 
TRAILR2 activation ( R16-1795 ). BI 905711 should achieve a therapeutic window by 
avoiding liver toxicity due to lack of CDH17 on hepatocytes ( R17-2598 ), avoiding GI toxicity 
due to high threshold for TRAILR2 mediated apoptosis in normal cells of the GI tract ( R16-
4563 ). These expectations are supported by extensive pre-clinical data as described in the IB 
(c16856466 ) and summarized in the following sections.
Absorption, bioavailability, distribution, metabolism, and excretion
No human data are available. The information below is based on preclinical considerations. 
Distribution
No dedicated distribution studies have been performed. In the cynomolgus monkey, Cmax 
and AUC0-168 increased approximately dose-proportionally upon dosing for all dosing groups (1, 10, 30, and 100mg/kg), and it is expected that distribution of BI 905711 will be mostly distributed to the blood after IV administration in a manner typical of IgG molecules (c16856466 ). Once distributed from intravascular space into the tissues, BI 905711 is 
expected to bind CDH17 and TRAILR2. CDH17 in expressed in pancreas, small and large 
intestine, gall bladder, and target tumor tissue. TRAILR2 is broadly expressed in tumors and to some extent in normal tissues particularly liver ( R18-2045 , R17-4113 ).
Metabolism
BI 905711 is a protein and is expected to undergo protein catabolism in animals and humans 
to peptides and amino acids. Dedicated metabolism studies were not conducted for BI 905711.
Excretion
The molecular weight of BI 905711 is approximately 201 kDa, which is above the renal
filtration cut-off threshold (approximately 60 kDa). Dedicated excretion studies were notconducted.
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions
BI 905711 is a therapeutic protein, and its clearance is through protein catabolism. BI 905711
is not an immune modulator and is not expected to impact expression and production ofcytochrome P450 enzyme or certain drug transporters that may affect indirectly the exposureof co-administered small molecule drugs. Therefore, pharmacokinetic drug interactionbetween BI 905711 and co-administered small molecule drugs is not expected. 
Residual Effect Period
The expected Residual Effect Period (REP) of BI 905711 is 30 days (+ 5 days). This is the 
period after the last dose with measurable drug levels and/or pharmacodynamic effects still likely to be present.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017Non-clinical studies
BI 905711 demonstrated high preclinical activity in-vitro and in-vivo for CDH17 positive 
tumor cell lines in extensive batteries of pr e-clinical experiments fully described in the IB. A 
short summary is given below.
The sensitivity of a panel of 24 CDH17-positive colorectal cancer cell lines to BI 905711 
treatment was evaluated and is shown in Figure1.2: 1 . A V-shaped dose-response is predicted 
for this bi-specific MoA where concentrations above the optimum will favor individual target 
recruitment, thus preventing TRAILR2 cross-linking and therefore reducing efficacy. Within 
the range of concentrations tested, different cell lines showed a reduced efficacy when using higher than optimal doses. Importantly, despite differences in CDH17 and TRAILR2 protein expression levels and the intrinsic sensitivity to TRAILR2 agonists among these cells, there was a common concentration range inducing the maximal effect for all of them (Figure 1.2: 1)
Figure 1.2: 1 Dose response graph of CRC cell lines classified as sensitive to BI 905711 as 
determined in the Cell Titer-Glo assay. Within the range of concentrations tested, different cell lines showed a V-shaped dose-response curve, and reduced efficacy was detected when using higher than optimal doses(c16856466 ).
BI 905711 was also tested in CDH17 negative liver-derived cells, and Hep G2 was used as a 
surrogate for TRAIL sensitive hepatocytes. In Hep G2 cells, no significant effect of BI 905711 decreasing cell viability was observed. The potent tetrameric nanobody agonist targeting TRAILR2 (EX 77749) was used as a reference of sensitivity to TRAILR2 agonists. As expected for a CDH17-independent molecule, a significant effect of EX 77749 decreasing

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017cell viability was observed independently of the absence of CDH17 membrane expression 
(Figure 1.2: 2 ).
Figure 1.2: 2 Representative graph of concentration response curves as determined in the 
72h Hep G2 Cell Titer-Glo assay ( c16856466 ).
BI 905711 in vivo efficacy was demonstrated in the COLO 205 xenograft tumor model, where 
a single dose administration (0.3, 1, 5 and 15 mg/Kg) led to significant growth inhibition for all treatment groups. The GP2d cell line was selected as a second CRC xenograft tumor model for in vivo profiling of BI 905711. Compared to COLO 205 derived tumor samples, CDH17 
distribution in GP2d derived tumor samples was more similar to those of metastatic CRC patients. BI 905711 was initially administered at doses of 1.67, 5 and 15 mg/kg. After a single dose, BI 905711 administered at 1.67 mg/kg led to sustained tumor regressions for most of the tumors from day 6 until day 36 (end of the experiment). In a follow up study, BI 905711 was administered at lower doses (0.05, 0.2, 0.8, and 1.67 mg/kg). Similar to the 1.67mg/kg group, BI 905711 administered at 0.8 mg/kg as a single dose led to sustained tumor regressions for most of the tumors from day 3 until day 29. The minimal efficacious dose was defined as 0.2 mg/kg with only a few regressions as compared to the 1.67 and 0.8 mg/kg groups, but still demonstrating a statistical significant tumor growth inhibition at the end of the experiment.
Similar to the in vitro setting, reduced efficacy was observed in the GP2d xenograft model at 
both lower and higher than optimum doses, resulting in a V-shaped (evaluating in vitro 
treatment-induced cell death) or a bell-shaped (evaluating in vivo treatment induced-tumor 
growth inhibition relative to control) dose-response relationship ( Figure 1.2:1 ,Figure 4.1.2.1: 
1).

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017Anticancer activity of BI 905711 in PDAC was tested in vivo using 11 patient-derived PDAC 
xenograft models (PDX) characterized by target expression of TRAILR2 and CDH17 in the range of 45 to 174 TPM (transcripts per million) and 26 to 604 TPM, respectively. Upon treatment with BI 905711, 4/11 PDX models showed tumor growth inhibition [TGI] ranging from 107 to 126% and 2/11 models showed moderate response (TGI 61% and 76%).First in vivo experiments (two PDAC PDX models) to study synergistic anticancer effect of BI 905711 in combination with chemotherapy (irinotecan) showed deepened response.
The pharmacokinetics (PK) and immunogenicity for BI 905711 was investigated in the
cynomolgus monkey following a single intravenous (i.v.) dose at 8 mg/kg, or 100 mg/kg by bolus injection, demonstrating dose-proportional PK. The well-characterized cynomolgus PK was subsequently used to predict the human pharmacokinetics and inform the phase Ia dose selection, as described in Section 4.1.2 and in full detail in the IB ( c16856466 ).
Preclinical toxicology
Preclinical toxicology is fully described in the IB ( c16856466 ). BI 905711 intravenously 
administered once per week (Q1W) to cynomolgus monkeys for 6 weeks up to dose levels of 
100 mg/kg produced no overt adverse effects. No changes in clinical pathology (hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis), ophthalmology, or immunophenotyping were observed, nor were any alterations to body weight or food consumption apparent. The majority of treated monkeys displayed ADAs to BI 905711 at the end of the 6-week drug phase, which slightly reduced total exposure (AUC0-168) when compared to the first administration.
BI 905711-related effects in the 6-week monkey study were limited to microscopic findings
in the brain (choroid plexus, meninges, and cerebrum) at ≥ 30 mg/kg, and in the spinal cord
(meninges, gray matter) and kidney (glomerulus) at 100 mg/kg. Changes in the brain andspinal cord were characterized by minimal to mild perivascular mononuclear cell infiltratesthat contained admixed eosinophils. In animals allowed a 4-week recovery phase, changes in the choroid plexus and meninges of the brain remained apparent, but no findings were noted in the spinal cord. The perivascular accumulation of mononuclear cell infiltrates may represent immune responses originating within the Virchow-Robin space, continuous with the subarachnoid space and outside of the blood-brain barrier. In the kidney, glomerulopathy was observed in monkeys at the end of treatment and recovery phases and was considered related to BI 905711 administration, although no alterations to serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinine or urinary protein were observed. Immunohistochemical (IHC) investigation (Monkey IgM, IgG, C3) did not reveal evidence of immune complex deposition, suggesting an absence of immune complex formation or immune complex levels below the IHC detection limit.
The Highest Non-Severely Toxic Dose (HNSTD) in the 6-week monkey toxicity study was
judged to be 100 mg/kg Q1W, and the No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) wasconsidered to be 30 mg/kg Q1W. 
No hemolytic or local effects due to BI 905711 intravenous injection were noted. BI 905711 
did not cause in vitro cytokine release ( c16856466 ).

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017Median duration of treatment in non-CRC GI cancers patients was 35.5 days (range, 15–246) 
overall and 116.5 days (range, 15–211) in the 0.6 mg/kg group. Thirteen (13) of 22 non-CRC GI cancer patients had PDAC. Six (6/13) PDAC patients achieved best overall response of stable disease including 4 patients that remained progression-free at ≥4 months.
Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles, as well as preliminary antitumor 
activity of BI 905711 given biweekly at three dose levels (0.6 mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg and 2.4 mg/kg) or weekly at one dose level (0.6 mg/kg), will be assessed during 1412-0001 expansion phase 1b. 
For a more detailed description of the BI 905711 profile, refer to the current Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB).
1.3 RATIONALE FOR PERFORMING THE TRIAL
Efficacy of current standard therapies for gastrointestinal cancers at advanced or metastatic 
stage is limited. The majority of these patients die due to primary or secondary resistance to therapy, and there is a significant need to develop new approaches for their treatment. BI 905711 represents a novel class of bispecific antibody that may be developed as a new treatment option for these patients.  BI 905711 showed efficacy in relevant preclinical models,and its development is supported by extensive pharmacology and toxicology preclinical data (Section 1.2 ).
This open-label, dose-escalation study represents the first protocol for BI 905711 treatment in 
humans. Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic profiles, as well as preliminary antitumor activity assessments, acquired in this trial will provide the basis for further development of BI 905711.
Based on available preliminary data from phase I clinical studies (1412.1 and 1412.3), the
decision was made to terminate BI 905711 (TRAILR2/CDH17) development program. This decision is not related to any safety concerns or unfavorable benefit/risk balance, but to the lack of predictive biomarkers and the limited efficacy particularly in the context of the evolving treatment landscape for advanced CRC and other GI cancers.
The purpose of CTP v7.0 is to reduce the study related activities to the minimum required to 
monitor patient safety and to avoid undue burden on patients.
1.4 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
Most patients with advanced or metastatic gastrointestinal cancers have limited treatment 
options, develop resistance to currently available therapies, and succumb to their disease.  BI 905711 can potentially provide a new therapeutic option for these patients as suggested by its 
efficacy in relevant preclinical models and further supported by extensive pharmacology and toxicology preclinical data ( Section 1.2 ).

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017Only a minimum number of patients should be exposed to doses of BI 905711 with low 
likelihood of activity. Therefore, a Bayesian Logistic Regression Model (BLRM) design will be used in order to escalate the dose into a dose range where optimal efficacy may be seen while still minimizing the risk of undue toxicity.
Conventional anti-TRAILR2 antibodies have been extensively tested and well tolerated in 
clinic with a well-defined safety profile. The majority of these compounds did not induce 
DLTs in phase 1 trials with no established MTD. Treatment-related adverse events with such 
compounds mostly included mild elevation of AST, ALT and/or pancreatic amylase with no 
reported severe events ( R16-1793 , R16-1794 ,R17-2590 , R17-2600 , R17-2601 , R16-4524 , 
R17-2606 ).  There is limited clinical experience with the second generation of compounds 
inducing TRAILR2 clustering independently of FcR interactions. Recently, phase I data of 
the TRAILR2 binding tetramer (TAS 266) was report ed indicating reversible liver toxicity 
at the first administered dose level leading to TAS 266 discontinuation from further 
development ( R16-1795 ). Detailed review of published pre-clinical and clinical data 
suggest that a relatively high exposure at the starting dose in phase 1 trial may have 
contributed to the observed toxicity of this drug ( R16-1800 ). A similar compound (ABBV-
621) is currently investigated in an ongoing phase 1 study ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) ( R18-2222 ). A 
bi-specific compound targeting TRAILR2 and FAP (RG 7386) has completed phase 1
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) with no reported DLTs and MTD ( R18-1695 ).
The summary of observed adverse events during phase Ia is provided in previous section 1.2. 
The anticipated adverse events based on the BI 905711 mode of action, pharmacological data and results of preclinical toxicology studies are described below:
∀Injury of GI tissues expressing CDH17
CDH17 is expressed in the small intestine, colon, gastric mucosa, gall bladder and pancreatic 
ducts. BI 905711 may potentially cross-link TRAILR2 to CDH17 in these tissues and induce apoptosis and injury ( Section 1.2 ). No signs of GI injury were observed in preclinical 
toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys up to the highest administered dose ( c16856466 ). 
There are preclinical in-vitro data suggesting that normal human colon epithelial cells are 
insensitive to TRAILR2 induced apoptosis, but their sensitivity can be increased during 
inflammation and viral infection ( R16-4563 , R17-2592 ). Patients with inflammatory bowel 
disease and bowel infection should not participate in clinical trials with BI 905711. Based on 
above considerations, possible anticipated Adverse Events of BI 905711 may include nausea, anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting, pancreatitis, increase in pancreatic lipase/amylase, abdominal pain and/or other GI tract related signs/symptoms. Guidelines for management of nausea, diarrhea and vomiting are provided in Section 4.1.4.1.2 .
∀Liver injury
Liver tissue is reported as the most sensitive non-cancerous tissue to TRAILR2 mediated
apoptosis ( R16-1795 , R16-1793 ). Human hepatocytes do not express CDH17 and in Hep G2 
cells used as a surrogate for TRAIL sensitive hepatocytes, no significant effect of BI 905711 
on cell viability was observed. Still, liver damage induced by BI 905711 cannot be excluded particularly in patients with liver metastases. Patients should be followed closely for potential elevation of AST, ALT, and bilirubin, and for clinical signs/symptoms of liver injury as described in Section 5.2.6.1.4 .

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017∀Renal injury
A 6-week GLP toxicology study in monkeys showed glomerulopathy at the highest testeddose of 100 mg/kg ( c16856466 ). These finding were not accompanied by clinical or
biochemical changes in renal functions with no increase in serum creatinine or BUN and no
proteinuria. CDH17 has not been detected in the kidneys of monkeys or humans (c16856466).Granular deposits containing human IgG and/or monkey IgG were identified in the kidneys of animals displaying glomerulopathy.  The presence of these granular deposits is consistent with processes of immune complex formation, deposition, and clearance in response to the test article.  Formation of immune complexes followed by deposition in the kidneys with resultant glomerulopathy has been described when monkeys form ADA in response to heterologous protein administration and is generally not considered predictive of similar findings in humans. The relevance of these observed renal findings for humans is unknown. Patients will be monitored for changes in renal functions by serial measurement of creatinine and urea inblood and protein in urine as specified in Section 5.2.3 .
∀Tumor lysis
BI 905711 induces apoptosis within a short time frame in-vitro and leads to tumor regressionin-vivo in preclinical models. Theoretically, tumor lysis syndrome can occur. Patients should be monitored for occurrence of tumor lysis syndrome particularly after the first administration of BI 905711 with guidelines provided in Section 4.1.4.1.4 .
∀Infusion-related reaction
BI 905711 is a humanized bi-specific antibody with atypical format, and it may induce
infusion-related reactions due to multiple mechanisms. Recent data from a similar bi-specific antibody targeting TRAILR2 and FAP reported an incidence of 9% of grade 1-2 infusion reactions with no grade ≥3 (R18-1695 ). Management guidelines for infusion-related reactions 
are provided in Section 4.1.4.1.1 .
∀Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) and immune-mediated reactions
The TRAIL pathway has been implicated in inflammation in some preclinical experiments,but the clinical relevance of these findings are unknown ( R18-2770 ). BI 905711 did not
induce any cytokine release using a standard in vitro assay ( c16856466 ). There was no CRS 
reported in historical studies with conventional TRAILR2 antibodies and TRAILR2 clustering 
agents ( R16-1793 , R16-1794 , R17-2590 , R17-2600 , R17-2601 , R16-4524 , R17-2606 ). The 
risk of CRS cannot be excluded, and patients should be followed for possible occurrence of 
CRS with guidelines provided in Section 4.1.4.1.2 .
∀Neurological adverse events
A six week GLP toxicology study in m onkeys showed minimal to mild perivascular 
eosinophilic/monocyte cell infiltrations in brain and spine at doses of 30mg/kg and 100mg/kg with no apparent clinical neurological finding in affected animals. More details are described in the IB and in Section 5.3 .  Cytoplasmic CDH17 staining was occasionally present in 
cerebral neurons of both humans and monkeys. Since CDH17 is membrane bound, the 
cytoplasmic staining is non specific and pathological findings in monkey brains are not considered related to BI 905711 mediated cross-linking of TRAILR2 and CDH17. TRAILR2 have been described in human brain particularly in certain pathological conditions ( R18-

TRAILR2 agonists up to the highest tested dose levels ( R16-1793 ; R16-1794 ), R17-2590 , 
R17-2600 , R17-2601 , R16-4524 , R17-2606) . In summary, dose dependent, minimal to mild 
eosinophilic/monocyte cells infiltrations in perivascular region of the brain and spine observed 
in toxicology studies in monkeys are of unknown significance and were considered to be possibly secondary effects related to the immunogenicity of BI 905711 or test article platform. Relevance of these findings for humans is unknown. The risk of possible neurological adverse reactions will be closely monitored in human studies. Thus, a baseline brain MRI will be performed in all patients enrolled in the phase Ia part.  Patients who develop new neurological symptoms or deficits need to undergo neurological investigations including a brain MRI, and treatment with BI 905711 must be interrupted or discontinued. Guidelines for management of possible neurological toxicities are provided in Section 4.1.4.1.5 . The possibility of their 
relationship to ADA will be assessed.  
∀ADA (anti-drug antibodies) related adverse reaction
BI 905711 may lead to development of ADA, and its occurrence will be explored in this study (refer to Section 5.3.2 ). The consequence of ADA occurrence for safety is currently unknown.
There is a single preclinical report indicating the possibility of ADA mediated clustering of 
TRAILR2 and its potential contribution to liver injury ( R17-2603 ). Patients will be closely 
followed for development of liver injury for the whole duration of BI 905711 treatment, and 
possible contribution of ADA to liver injury will be assessed.
∀Tumor biopsy 
As part of the screening, patients are required to have a tumor tissue biopsy. Pre-treatment fresh tumor biopsy collections for biomarker analyses are considered optional in phase Ia and mandatory in phase Ib. There is an added risk for pain, swelling, bleeding for those patients who will undergo tumor biopsies. For this reason, biopsies will only be performed when deemed safe by the investigator and if the platelet count is sufficient to allow for haemostasis. As the results from the biopsy will provide more information which will assist clinical decisions for future patients, the benefit is assumed to outweigh the risks associated with the biopsy.
During 1412-0001 phase 1a dose escalation the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC)
assessed trial data to ensure the overall safety of the patients treated. Based on theaccumulated data, the SMC reached joint recommendations on the next dose level of BI 905711 to be investigated and the sample size for the next dose-escalation cohort. They also provided the Investigators and the Sponsor with advice about the overall conduct of the trial (refer to Section 8.7 ).
The Safety Monitoring Committee reviewed the safety data of BI 905711 up to 3.6 mg/kg in 
CRC and non-CRC GI cancer patients and concluded that no DLT was observed, no MTD was achieved, and there was no evidence of any dose/adverse effect relationship. In addition,there was no evidence for drug-induced liver injury and no pattern of anticipated AEs (seesection 7 of current IB) has been observed except infusion-related reactions (see previous section 1.2 for details).

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017A Benefit-Risk assessment in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic for patients treated with 
BI 905711 has been performed. Based on the mode of action, BI 905711 is not expected to have a relevant impact on the susceptibility to or the course of a SARS-CoV-2 infection.
  
In case of a confirmed infection, trial treatment will be discontinued immediately and appropriate measures for monitoring, treatment and quarantine will be implemented. The patient may resume trial treatment following recovery from a SARS-CoV-2 infection if the patient is expected to derive clinical benefit, as agreed between the investigator and sponsor .
Patients in this trial may be immuno-compromised and at higher risk for severe illness from 
COVID-19. In case of an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection due to the physical visits to the sites, the visits should be avoided where the investigator judges that this is the safest course of action. These measures ensure the safety of the patients throughout the trial, maintain the integrity of the trial and will not affect the benefit-risk balance of BI 905711.
In summary, the present trial has implemented a number of safety measures to mitigate
possible risks for patients. It is concluded that participation in this study and treatment with BI905711 may provide patients with potential clinical benefit at an acceptable risk.

2.1.1 Main objectives
Phase Ia:
∀Explore safety and establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended dose
levels for phase Ib expansion phase of BI 905711 based on the frequency of patients 
experiencing dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the MTD evaluation period. The MTD evaluation period is defined as the first two treatment cycles (from first dose administration until the day preceding the third dose administration or end of REP in case of discontinuation before start of Cycle 3).
∀Explore pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and efficacy to guide the determination 
of a potentially effective dose range for phase Ib in the absence of MTD.
Phase Ib:
∀Evaluate efficacy and safety of BI 905711 at a potentially effective dose range and 
determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D)
2.1.2 Primary endpoint(s)
Phase Ia:
∀Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) defined as the highest dose with less than 25% risk of 
the true DLT rate being equal or above 33% during the MTD evaluation period. For the definition of DLTs, refer to Section 5.2.6.1.5 .
∀Number of patients with DLTs in the MTD evaluation period. 
A BLRM employing the escalation with overdose control (EWOC) principle will be used 
during the escalation phase for the selection of the dose levels and, if applicable, the estimation of the MTD. Cohorts of patients will receive escalating doses of BI 905711 until the MTD is reached. Each cohort will consist of newly enrolled patients. Estimation of the MTD during the escalation phase of the trial will be based upon the estimation of the probability of a DLT in the MTD evaluation period in the set of evaluable patients for MTD. The corresponding methodology is described in Section 7 andAppendix 10.3 . The MTD 
estimate established during the dose escalation phase will be re-investigated after the 
expansion phase by re-running the BLRM including all data from escalation and expansion phases, including DLTs observed at all treatment cycles.
Phase Ib:
∀Objective response based on RECIST 1.1 criteria. Objective response is defined as 
best overall response of complete response or partial response, where best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the study treatment until the earliest of disease progression, death or last evaluable tumor assessment and before start of subsequent anti-cancer therapy.

3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
The study will consist of two parts: phase Ia (escalation part) and phase Ib (expansion part) as 
displayed in Figure 3.1: 1 and described in Sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2 .
Note: Displayed dose levels are for illustration only. The number of patients in the dose escalation cohorts may be increased 
in case of DLT observation. Non-CRC includes any other non-colorectal GI cancers.
Figure 3.1: 1 Overall study design
3.1.1 Phase Ia: dose escalation (Part A)
Phase Ia is an open-label, dose escalation study of BI 905711 administered intravenously. 
Provisional dose escalation levels are described in Table 4.1.2.1: 1 .  
Recruitment in Phase Ia is complete. 
3.1.1.1 Recruitment in CRC escalation cohorts
CRC patients represent a homogenous population regarding CDH17 expression. CRC 
preclinical models were used for prediction of dose levels to be tested in phase Ia and BI 905711 pharmacological activity. Thus, CRC patients will be recruited as mandatory cohorts at all dose levels. Gastrointestinal cancers in patients of various ethnicity, including Japanese patients, express CDH17 to a similar extent ( R18-3554 ), and ethnicity based differences for
BI 905711 tolerability and PK are not expected ( R18-3553 ).  Patients of any ethnicity can be

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017enrolled into the first two dose levels.  Starting from dose level 3 onwards, at least one 
Japanese patient should be included into each dose level to establish the safety for Japanese patients. The possible cohort size is described in Table 4.1.2.1: 1.
3.1.1.2 Recruitment in non-CRC GI cancer cohorts
Non-CRC GI cancer patients were recruited as “back-filled” cohorts at one level below the 
current dose being investigated in the CRC cohort to confirm safety also for this population. The decision to open enrollment of non-CRC GI cancer cohorts and the selection of the starting dose were taken by the SMC. Recruitment at a specified dose level occurred once it was determined to be safe in CRC cohorts per SMC decision.
Once the first site in China was initiated while the phase Ia was ongoing, the first Chinese 
patient was enrolled into the non-CRC dose level that was open at the time of site initiation. Thereafter, at least one Chinese patient was enrolled in China at each subsequent dose level in phase Ia.
3.1.1.3 MTD determination/recommended dose range for expansionThe data obtained from the trial was to determine the MTD estimate based on a BLRM with 
overdose control ( R13-4803 ). The BLRM estimates the MTD by updating estimates of the 
probability of observing a DLT in the MTD evaluation period for each dose level in the trial 
as patient information becomes available. At any time in the trial, it was not permitted to escalate to a dose which does not fulfil the escalation with overdose control (EWOC) principle (refer to Section 7 ). 
Recruitment at every dose level started with CRC patients. As soon as all CRC patients 
enrolled for safety evaluation on a dose level completed the MTD evaluation period, a BLRM with overdose control was be applied by using all available data from all dose levels assessed(from both CRC and non-CRC GI cancer patients) to determine the next dose levels in CRC and non-CRC cohorts and evaluate MTD. The overdose risk was then calculated for each preliminary dose level from Table 4.1.2.1: 1 and escalation was permitted to a dose level which 
fulfilled the EWOC criterion. Intermediate or higher dose levels could be used as long as it 
fulfilled the EWOC criterion. Specifications and details of the BLRM are indicated in Section 
7.1and Appendix 10.3 .
The safety data from non-CRC GI cancer patients as well as data from the Japanese patients
was evaluated additionally in a descriptive manner and provided to SMC at every dose escalation step. If DLTs in non-CRC GI cancer patients were observed in a lower dose level as compared to CRC patients, some sensitivity analysis was run based on BLRM by adding CRC/non-CRC as a covariate to evaluate whether to reduce the dose level or recruit more patients at the same dose level for non-CRC GI cancer patients. The SMC made a decision about continuation of dose escalation for non-CRC GI cancer patients based on these data. The SMC also discussed whether the dose level for CRC patients should be adjusted or not. 
Decision on further recruitment, dose escalation, de-escalation or cohort expansion was made 
by the SMC.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017At each dose level, the first patient was treated and was observed for at least 1 week 
before allowing the second patient to receive BI 905711 infusion.
∀For the initial two dose levels (dose levels of 0.02 mg/kg and 0.06 mg/kg), at least oneCRC patient was required.  In case patients have not experienced a DLT within the first two cycles, enrollment into a higher dose level occured. In case a DLT occured,the number of patients was increased to four patients per dose level, and BLRM was  performed to determine the next escalation steps. At least one Japanese patient should be included in the additional three patients that are enrolled. Then, all subsequent dose levels consisted of at least four patients. For further dose-escalation steps (dose level of 0.2 mg/kg and above), four CRC patients were required. However, in the case that only three patients were evaluable (including one Japanese patient) and none experienced a DLT as defined in Section 5.2.6.1.5 within the MTD evaluation period, 
then dose escalation occured based on these three evaluable patients.
If DLTs were observed in the first two consecutive patients of a previously untested dose 
level, subsequent enrollment to this dose cohort was stopped. The BLRM was to be re-run to confirm whether the dose level still fulfils the EWOC criterion. Based on this information, the SMC evaluated whether the next patients will be enrolled at the same dose level, or at a lower dose level.
The SMC may have recommended stopping the dose escalation phase after the criterion for 
MTD ( Section 7.1 ) is fulfilled. Further patients may have been included to confirm this MTD 
estimate, i.e. to confirm that the EWOC criterion is still fulfilled. 
The planned highest dose to be tested in the dose escalation was 4.8mg/kg based upon the 
pharmacodynamic modeling (refer to Figure 4.1.2.1: 1 ). Based on the available safety data 
and the BLRM, exploration of doses higher than 4.8 mg/kg was considered.
3.1.2 Phase Ib: expansion cohorts (Part B)
Phase Ib is a randomised open label study to determine safety and efficacy of BI 905711 in 
the 4 expansion cohorts of patients with colorectal cancer and the 1 expansion cohort of patients with pancreatic cancer. 
The selection of the dose levels for phase Ib wa s made by the SMC with the aim to select a 
safe and potentially effective dose range of BI 905711 based on all data collected in phase Ia.Selected dose(s) for phase Ib expansion cohorts can not be higher than the MTD. The overall 
framework for dose selection for phase Ib is described in Section 4.1.2.2 .
If any DLTs are observed during cohort expansion, the BLRM will be run to confirm if that
dose level still fulfils the overdose risk control. Further expansion to 15 patients for the CRC cohorts or 20 patients for the PDAC cohorts may be stopped due to over toxicity. 
The SMC can declare any dose fulfilling the EWOC criterion as RP2D by considering all 
available efficacy (OR), PK/PD, biomarker and safety data, independent of the MTD estimate.

be re-investigated after the expansion phase by re-running the BLRM including all data from escalation and expansion phases.
Furthermore, continuation of the trial using the optimal dose and selected patient population 
will be considered and further specified in a protocol amendment if appropriate. 
Recruitment in this trial was discontinued during Phase I expansion, and no PDAC patients 
were enrolled in this expansion cohort. 
3.1.2.1 Randomized CRC expansion cohort
Approximately 60 evaluable CRC patients can be enrolled into phase Ib into 3 dose levels 
with 4 cohorts of 15 evaluable CRC patients. Statistical justification for the number of patients per dose level is indicated in Section 7.7 . 
Patients will be randomised into three dose levels in four cohorts (three dose levels in 
biweekly regimen and one dose level in weekly regimen (3 weeks on, 1 week off)) of BI 905711 for a total of approximately 60 evaluable patients.  
3.1.2.2 Single Arm PDAC expansion cohortApproximately 20 evaluable patients with CDH17-positive PDAC will be enrolled into phase 
Ib. Patients will be enrolled on one dose level in weekly regimen (3 weeks on, 1 week off) of BI 905711. 
CDH17 analysis must be performed by a designated vendor and results reviewed prior to 
patient enrollment. 
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING THE CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
The primary objective of this trial is to determine the MTD and the RP2D. The secondary 
objective is to explore efficacy and safety at a potentially effective dose range of BI 905711 monotherapy. 
The phase Ia dose escalation and cohort size was determined based upon the recommendation 
of the SMC, guided by a BLRM with overdose control. An escalation with overdose controldesign would increase the chance of treating patients at efficacious doses while reducing therisk of overdosing. This design was based on practical experience and was a preferable algorithmic method due to its superior ability to identify the dose with the desired toxicity rate and its allocation of a greater proportion of patients  to doses at, or close to, that dose ( R13-
4802 ,R13-4804, R13-4805 ). The use of BLRM for phase I studies has also been advocated by 
the EMA guideline on small populations (R07-4856 ) and by the FDA ( R13-4881 ).
The phase Ib expansion part will serve for early evaluation of anti-tumor effect of BI 905711 
at a potentially effective dose range (0.6mg/kg, 1.2mg/kg, 2.4mg/kg) and to explore anti-cancer effect of BI 905711 at 0.6mg/kg dose given weekly (3 weeks on, 1 week off) and at 0.6mg/kg,

Only in cases where the Investigator (or the treating physician or both) suspects cardiac disease with negative effect on the EF, will the EF be measured during screening using an appropriate method according to local standards to confirm eligibility (e.g., echocardiogram, multigated acquisition scan). A historic measurement of EF no older than 6 months prior to first administration of study drug can be accepted provided that there is clinical evidencethat the EF value has not worsened since this measurement in the opinion of the Investigator or of the treating physician or both.
14. Known hypersensitivity to the trial medication and/or its components i.e. 
polysorbate 20, sodium citrate, lysine hydrochloride, sucrose, citric acid.
3.3.4 Withdrawal of patients from treatment or assessments
Patients may discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation as a whole
(“withdrawal of consent”) with very different implications (refer to Sections 3.3.4.1 and
3.3.4.2 ).
Every effort should be made to keep the patients in the trial: if possible on treatment, or at 
least to collect important trial data. Measures to control the withdrawal rate include careful patient selection, appropriate explanation of the trial requirements and procedures prior to trial enrollment, as well as the explanation of the consequences of withdrawal. 
The decision to discontinue trial treatment or withdraw consent to trial participation and the 
reason must be documented in the patient files and CRF. If the reason for treatment discontinuation is death, this should be reported on the SAE form as well, regardless of causal relationship.
3.3.4.1 Discontinuation of trial treatment
An individual patient will discontinue trial treatment if:
∀The patient wants to discontinue trial treatment, without the need to justify the 
decision.
∀The patient has repeatedly shown to be non-compliant with important trial procedures 
and, in the opinion of both, the investigator and Sponsor representative, is not willing or able to adhere to the trial requirements in the future. 
∀The patient needs to take concomitant medication that interferes with the 
investigational drug.
∀The patient can no longer receive trial treatment for medical reasons (such as cancer 
progression, surgery, adverse events, other intercurrent diseases, or pregnancy, or 
nursing).
∀The patient experiences an infection with SARS-CoV-2. The patient may resume trial 
treatment following recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection if the patient is expected to derive clinical benefit, as agreed between the investigator and sponsor.

early for non-safety related reasons (e.g. unable to attend the protocol defined visits for to personal reason), or trial disruption e.g.  measures to control the spreading of COVID-19. Patients may only be replaced after an agreement with the sponsor.
The patient may continue treatment beyond initial RECIST progression if:
∀The patient is clinically benefiting,
∀The criteria described below are met,
∀It is agreed between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor of the Sponsor, 
∀The patient has signed an informed consent describing this circumstance.
Criteria required to continue treatment through RECIST-defined radiological progression of 
disease: 
∀Absence of clinical symptoms or signs indicating clinically significant disease 
progression
∀No decline in performance status
∀Absence of rapid disease progression or threat to vital organs or critical anatomical 
sites [e.g., CNS metastasis, respiratory failure due to tumor compression, spinal cord compression] requiring urgent alternative medical intervention
∀No significant, unacceptable or irreversible toxicities related to study treatment
Even if the trial treatment is discontinued, the patient remains in the trial and, given his/her
agreement, will undergo the procedures for treatment discontinuation and follow up as outlined in the Flowchart and Section 6.2.3 .
3.3.4.2 Withdrawal of consent to trial participation
Patients may withdraw their consent to trial participation at any time without the need to 
justify the decision.
If a patient wants to withdraw consent, the investigator should be involved in the discussion 
with the patient and explain the difference between trial treatment discontinuation and withdrawal of consent to trial participation, as well as explain the options for continued follow up after trial treatment discontinuation, see Section 3.3.4.1 above.
3.3.4.3 Discontinuation of the trial by the Sponsor
Boehringer Ingelheim reserves the right to discontinue the trial overall or at a particular trial
site at any time for the following reasons:
1. Failure to meet expected enrollment goals overall or at a particular trial site.
2. Emergence of any efficacy/safety information that could significantly affect the 
continuation of the trial.
3. Violation of GCP, the trial protocol, or the contract impairing the appropriate conduct of 
the trial.

3.3.4.4 Replacement of patients for MTD determination and PK evaluation in phase IaPatients who experience a DLT during the MTD evaluation period were not replaced. 
The following patients without DLT during the MTD evaluation period were considered non-evaluable for MTD determination and were not included in the BLRM analysis:
∀Patients who withdrew consent or who were lost from follow-up before completing 
first two cycles of study treatment.
∀Patients who have received less than 70% of the planned BI 905711 doses during first 
two cycles of study treatment
∀Patients who missed 2 or more partial or complete visits during the first two cycles of 
study treatment.
∀Patients with missing PK and evaluation of safety parameters.
These patients were replaced for DLT evaluation during the MTD evaluation period if not 
decided otherwise by the SMC (e.g. if the number of evaluable patients for the current dose cohort is considered sufficient for a dose escalation decision or MTD determination).
Of note, the dose escalation was determined based on all the safety information of all treated 
patients including those who were not included in the BLRM analysis.

4.1.2.1 Dose(s) selection for Phase Ia
A detailed description of the methods and considerations to determine a safe starting dose and 
the phase Ia dose levels, taking into account the available nonclinical information, including 
PK/PD and toxicity data, is described in the current IB ( c16856466 ).
In summary, human pharmacokinetics of BI 905711 upon intravenous administration were 
predicted based on cynomolgus monkey PK data. Dose-normalized, concentration-time datawere scaled to human by means of elementary Dedrick scaling (scaling factors d=1 and b=0.85) with mean body weights of 2.9 and 70 kg for monkeys and humans, respectively.
PK and tumor growth inhibition data from both the COLO205 and GP2d xenograft models
were incorporated into dose–response models and used, by means of plasma exposure matching over the proposed 2 week dosing interval (AUC0-336h), to predict the efficacious human dose and relevant dose-range to be investigated in phase Ia. ( Figure 4.1.2.1: 1 ).

projected human doses levels (mg/kg) are shown as overlay
The recommended starting dose for phase Ia is based on an integrated evaluation of the 
predicted exposure-response relationship, the HNSTD exposure in the 6-week toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, literature review of other TRAILR2 agonists and the proposed patient population ( c16856466 ).
A starting dose of 0.02 mg/kg of BI 905711 with following characteristics has been selected:
∀The starting dose is a human equivalent dose (HED) based on matching 14 day 
predicted plasma exposure with the simulated PK/PD relationship in two xenograft models. This exposure level corresponds to an activity of ~ 30% tumor growth inhibition as compared to maximally active dose in those two models (25% for COLO 205 and 34% for GP2d) as shown in Figure 4.1.2.1: 1.
∀The starting dose is 30-fold lower as compared to the modelled maximally active 
human equivalent dose in the studied xenografts models (0.6 mg/kg).
∀The predicted exposure in humans at the starting dose is 1045- and 650-fold below the 
Cmax and AUC0-336, respectively, at the NOAEL, and >3600-fold below both 
parameters at the HNSTD in monkeys. Therefore, this starting dose is supported by the 6-week repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. 
For further starting dose details, refer to the Investigator’s Brochure (c16856466).The dose is planned to be escalated in cohorts at the pre-defined dose levels in Table 
4.1.2.1:1 . In-between or higher dose levels may be investigated as long as they fulfill the 
EWOC criterion. Rationale for the provisionally selected dose levels in phase Ia is based 
on the predicted human pharmacologically active dose and ensures a complete coverage and investigation of the projected BI 905711 dose-response relationship as shown in Figure 4.1.2.1: 1 . At any time during the trial, it will not be permitted to escalate to a dose

enrolled into the non-CRC dose level that is open at the time of site initiation. Thereafter, at least one Chinese patient will be enrolled in China at each subsequent dose level in phase Ia.
At the end of the MTD evaluation period for each treatment cohort, BI convened a meeting 
with the SMC. At the SMC meeting, the safety data including DLTs during and beyond the MTD evaluation period and PK/PD data as available for each patient in the current dose cohort was presented. Based on that, a decision on the next dose level to be tested was made. Dose escalation continued until identification of the MTD, safety concerns arose, or the trial was terminated for other reasons. Further escalation steps above 4.8 mg/kg could occur if deemed appropriate by the SMC.
4.1.2.2 Dose(s) selection for phase Ib
Dose(s) selection for phase Ib was made by the SMC with the aim to select a safe and 
potentially effective dose range of BI 905711 and is  based on integrated analysis of all data 
collected in phase Ia (including safety, PK, biomarker, tumor response) 
Selected dose(s) cannot be higher than the MTD observed in phase Ia, if the MTD was 
determined.

Patients who experience DLT ( Section 5.2.6.1.5 ) or any grade 3-4 AE possibly related to BI 
905711 should interrupt or delay treatment until recovery to CTCAE grade 1 or baseline 
condition.  Restart of BI 905711 treatment can be considered at reduced dose if toxicity is adequately managed and there is approval from the medical representative of Sponsor. 
For phase Ia, the subsequent dose level was reduced to the next lower dose level as specified 
in Table 4.1.2.1: 1 after approval by the Sponsor and provided SMC has agreed the lower dose 
level is considered safe.
Patients on the first 3 dose levels who continued treatment after completion of Cycle 4, were 
considered for intra-patient dose escalation to a higher dose level that was determined as being safe and appropriate by the SMC. More than one dose-escalation was considered if deemed appropriate by the Investigator.
For phase Ib, restart of BI 905711 treatment can be considered at a reduced dose by 25% to 
50%, if there is approval from the medical representative of the Sponsor.
No more than 2 dose reductions will be allowed. After a dose reduction, no dose re-escalation 
will be permitted.
At the time the recommended doses for expansion are determined by SMC, patients that are 
on any other dose levels may be adapted to the recommended dose at investigator's discretion.

4.1.3 Method of assigning patients to treatment groups
For phase Ia, treatment slots were assigned to recruiting sites that have identified a potentially 
eligible patient in consultation with the Clinical Trial Leader (CT Leader) to the current enrolling dose level cohort. Slots were assigned on a competitive basis based upon availability. 
Patients enrolled for safety evaluation were assigned to their dose levels by the SMC based on 
available data on toxicity, PK, PD, and anti-tumor activity, refer to Section 4.1.2.1 . 
Patients enrolled for efficacy evaluation were assigned to safe dose levels at which objective 
responses were observed. 
Enrollment into the current dose level cohort for dose escalation should have been always 
prioritized. 
If more than one dose cohort for efficacy evaluation was enrolling patients at the same time, 
the patient should have been enrolled into the dose level which had the lowest patient number(if ties happened, the patient should have been enrolled into the lower dose level first). 
For phase Ib, each eligible patient will be assigned to an appropriate expansion cohort, and the 
appropriate medication number will be assigned via Interactive Response Technology (IRT). Patients will be randomised via IRT into five cohorts (three dose levels in biweekly regimen and one dose level in weekly regimen (3 weeks on, 1 week off)) of BI 905711.
4.1.4 Drug assignment and administration of doses for each patient
The study drug will be prepared and handled according to the ‘Preparation and Handling of BI 
905711 for 1412-0001 instructions which will be filed in the ISF. Upon notification that a patient will be treated in the study, the pharmacy will prepare the study drug at the assigned dosage for administration to the patient.
The Cycle 1 Day 1 dose will be calculated using the Cycle 1 Day 1 weight or up to 3 days 
prior as the reference weight. If the patient’s weight changes by ≤10% compared to the 
reference weight, the dose (in mg) may remain the same for subsequent cycles. If the weight changes by >10% the dose will be recalculated and the new weight will be used as the reference weight.
BI 905711 will be given as an intra-venous infusion by authorised site staff in a specialised
unit where emergency care can be provided (e.g. intensive care unit available, medicalpersonnel trained in advanced life support). Appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat anaphylactic reactions must be immediately available, and study personnel must be trained to recognise and treat anaphylaxis. No routine premedication will be required for BI 905711 i.v. infusions.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017The infusion should take place over 30 minutes (+/-10 minutes), unless there is a necessity of 
administration rate reduction according to the protocol (e.g., in case of infusion-related reaction). If a patient’s weight is ≤50 kg, the infusion duration may be less than 30 minutes 
depending upon the infusion rate and the patient’s condition. 
Priming and flushing should not be included in the administration duration. Total storage time 
for ready-to-use solution at room temperature should not exceed 150 minutes between preparation and end of infusion time. 
Post-infusion observation period for phase Ia and phase Ib:
∀Patients will remain under surveillance for at least 8 hours after first, second and third
administrations of BI 905711. During the post-infusion observation period, body temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure will be measured at the end of the infusion and every 2 hours (± 15 minutes) thereafter.
∀If no adverse signs or symptoms, eg. infusion-related reactions, are observed during the 
first 3 administrations, the duration of the post-infusion observation period may be reduced to 4 hours for subsequent administrations. Body temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure will be measured at the end of the infusion, then after 2 and 4 hours (± 15 minutes).
∀After 6 administrations in the absence of infusion-related reactions, the post-infusion 
observation period can be reduced to 2 hours at investigator’s discretion. Body 
temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure will be measured at the end of the infusion, then after 2 hours (± 15 minutes). 
∀On the first day of treatment, although patients will not be required to stay overnight at the 
hospital, they should be advised to remain close to the study site where medical coverage will be ready to support them, if required. Thereafter, patients will be assessed at regular safety visits. 
In the event of force majeure or other disrupting circumstances (e.g. pandemic, war, please see 
Section 6 ), physical patient visits to the sites may not be feasible or may need to be restricted 
to ensure patient safety. Based on a thorough assessment of the benefits and risks, the 
investigator may still decide to continue trial treatment. 
4.1.4.1 Management of toxicities
4.1.4.1.1 Management of infusion-related reactionsInfusion-related reactions can have different mechanisms. Some are allergic in nature and are 
usually mediated by immunoglobulin E while others are not classical allergic reactions (so-called anaphylactoid reactions e.g. caused by cytokine release). Although infusion reactions can be allergic or nonallergic, clinical symptoms are difficult to distinguish and require rapid assessment and immediate management to avoid severe adverse events, including fatality.

permanently discontinued. If symptoms of an infusion-related reaction of CTCAE Grade 2 occur, which do not qualify as DLT according to Section 5.2.6.1.5 , the infusion should be 
temporarily stopped. Upon recovery, the following guidance should be followed:
∀If at least 50% of the planned dose of BI 905711 was administered, no further BI 905711
will be administered until the next scheduled dose.
∀If less than 50% of the planned dose of BI 905711 was administered due to an infusion-
related reaction, a further dose of 50% of the intended total dose may be administered on 
the following day and after recovery to baseline for at least 24 hours. Administration may occur within up to 3 days after the original planned dose. Refer to Section 10.2 for details 
regarding PK and biomarker sample collection. Remaining solution from the original 
dose must be discarded, and a new kit must be dispensed to prepare the dose of 50% of the intended total dose. 
∀During the first re-exposure, patients must remain under observation for at least 8 hours 
post start of infusion. If required, patients may be hospitalised for a longer observation period at the investigator’s discretion.
∀Premedication must be used for all subsequent treatment infusions. The recommended 
premedication is:
oAcetaminophen/Paracetamol 650 mg - 1000 mg p.o., or equivalent
oAntihistamine p.o. or i.v., equivalent to Diphenhydramine 50 mg i.v.
oGlucocorticoid i.v., equivalent to prednisolone 50-100 mg
∀The infusion rate for further treatment cycles may be adapted according to
Investigator’s decision, but any adaption of the infusion rate must be agreed with theSponsor. It must not exceed 150 minutes in total as outlined in Section 4.1.4 .
If infusion reactions and/or hypersensitivity reactions occur in a substantial proportion of
treated patients without premedication, the SMC may decide that all future patients treated inthe study must receive premedication (as described above) prior to BI 905711 infusion; thedosage and schedule of premedication will be aligned and will take into account any localclinical standards. Such a decision will be communicated to all investigators in writing.Premedications should be recorded in the eCRF.
4.1.4.1.2 Management of Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS)CRS is a disorder characterised by fever, tachypnea, headache, tachycardia, hypotension,
rash, and/or hypoxia caused by the release of cytokines. As outlined above in Section 
4.1.4.1.1 , clinical manifestations of CRS and other forms of infusion-related reactions are 
difficult to distinguish (especially at first occurrence) and require rapid diagnosis and 
immediate management to avoid severe adverse events, including fatality.
Patients must remain under observation for potential signs and symptoms of CRS (e.g. 
hypotension, rash, tachypnea, hypoxia, tachycardia, fever, nausea, fatigue, headache, myalgias and malaise) for at least 8 hours following the end of infusion of BI 905711. If no signs or symptoms of CRS are observed during the first 3 administrations, the duration of observation may be reduced to 4 hours for subsequent administrations.

clinical findings
4.1.4.1.4 Tumor lysis syndrome
All patients have to be assessed for clinical or laboratory suspicion of tumor lysis syndrome. 
To prevent tumor lysis syndrome, patients should remain appropriately hydrated throughout the administration period. For details of laboratory assessment, refer to Section 5.2.3 . In case 
tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is observed, patients should be managed according to local or 
available guidelines ( R10-4517 ).
4.1.4.1.5 Neurological adverse events
Toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys showed that BI 905711 at high doses induced 
minimal to mild monocytic/eosinophilic cells infiltrates in CNS ( c16856466 ). Clinical 
significance of these findings for humans is currently unknown. Patients should be monitored 
for possible neurological toxicity. During dose escalation phase (phase Ia), patients will undergo baseline brain MRI and should be followed for possible new neurological signs and symptoms at each visits of the study drug administration and at end of treatment. Patients who develop worsening or new neurological signs/symptoms CTCAE grade ≥ 2 should undergo 
full neurological investigation including a brain MRI. Treatment with BI 905711 must be interrupted or permanently discontinued unless alternative etiology is documented e.g. new metastases in the CNS, metabolic disturbances, sepsis, infection, hypoxia, tumor lysis syndrome, trauma, adverse effect of concomitant medications. Additional workup may be performed if clinically indicated e.g. lumbar puncture.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017Therapy with factor Xa inhibitors, direct thrombin inhibitors, and warfarin is allowed. Patients 
receiving warfarin must have their INR values closely monitored according to institutional guidelines.
Heparin is incompatible with many injectable preparations e.g. some antibiotics, opioid 
analgesics, antihistamines and cytotoxics ( R20-1190 , R20-1191 ).It has been reported in the 
literature that many incompatibilities are concentration-dependent ( R20-1196 ,R20-1190 ). At 
high concentrations, BI 905711 showed in-vitro incompatibility with heparin but not at 
clinically relevant concentrations (See IB section 4 for more details). Thus, the use of heparin(including flushing and locking of intravenous catheters) or LMWH is permitted during study treatment. However, the following restrictions must be applied: 
∀BI 905711 and heparin should not be mixed or infused through the same IV line
∀If the same IV line has to be used, flush thoroughly with 0.9% saline prior to and 
following BI 905711 infusion.
∀If a catheter will be locked with heparin, this must be flushed thoroughly with 0.9% 
saline prior to and following BI 905711 infusion. 
In phase Ia, hematopoietic growth factor agents were not allowed for use as primary 
prevention during the first 2 cycles. Thereafter hematopoietic growth factor agents may have 
been used according to institutional standard.
Erythropoietic therapy is allowed when used in accordance with the American Society of 
Clinical Oncology/American Society of Hematology or the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines.  In Japan, erythropoietic therapy is not approved for anemia caused by 
cancer chemotherapies.
The decision on COVID-19 vaccination of a BI study patient must be taken based on an individual benefit-risk assessment by the investigator after thorough discussion with the patient. This assessment should consider the approved labels of the respective vaccines as well as the provisions given in the protocol, including the time point when the vaccination should be given or a potential delay of the vaccination or of the study treatment. 
The package insert for approved COVID-19 vaccinations should be carefully reviewed for local 
guidance considering acute moderate/severe febrile illness, and the risk of an anaphylactic reaction to the vaccine.  Furthermore, the diminished response to the vaccine needs to be considered for immunocompromised conditions which may be observed in BI 905711 treated patients. 
It is important to encourage to continue tak ing precautions such as wearing a mask, maintaining 
social distancing and washing hands frequently, even after a patient receives a COVID-19 vaccine. These precautions will be necessary until public health experts advise otherwise.
4.2.2.2 Restrictions on diet and lifestyle
There are no restrictions regarding diet and lifestyle.

quality reasons and the repeated recording used for analysis. ECGs will be performed locally. 
If necessary, additional ECGs may be recorded for safety reasons. Clinically relevant abnormal findings will be reported either as baseline condition (if 
identified at the screening visit) or otherwise as AEs and will be followed up and/or treated as medically appropriate.
5.2.5 Other safety parameters
Not applicable. 
5.2.6 Assessment of adverse events
5.2.6.1 Definitions of AEs 
5.2.6.1.1 Adverse eventAn AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
The following should also be recorded as an AE in the CRF and BI SAE form (if applicable):
∀Worsening of the underlying disease or of other pre-existing conditions 
∀Changes in vital signs, ECG, physical examination and laboratory test results, if they 
are judged clinically relevant by the investigator.
If such abnormalities already exist prior to trial inclusion, they will be considered as baseline 
conditions and should be collected in the eCRF only.
5.2.6.1.2 Serious adverse eventA serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any AE, which fulfils at least one of the 
following criteria:- results in death,- is life-threatening, which refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if more severe,
- requires inpatient hospitalisation,- requires prolongation of existing hospitalisation,- results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,

- is deemed serious for any other reason if it is an important medical event when based on 
appropriate medical judgement which may jeopardise the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definitions. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation or development of dependency or abuse. 
For Japan only : the following events will be handled as “deemed serious for any other 
reason”. AEs which possibly lead to disability will be reported as SAEs.
5.2.6.1.3 AEs considered “Always Serious”In accordance with the European Medicines Agency initiative on Important Medical Events, 
Boehringer Ingelheim has set up a list of further AEs, which by their nature, can always be considered to be “serious” even though they may not have met the criteria of an SAE as defined above.
The latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the EDC system. A copy of the latest 
list of “Always Serious AEs” will be provided upon request. These events should always be reported as SAEs as described above.
Every new occurrence of cancer of new histology must be classified as a serious event 
regardless of the time since the discontinuation of the trial medication and must be reported as described in Section 5.2.6.2 , subsections “AE Collection” and “ AE reporting to Sponsor
and timelines ”.
5.2.6.1.4 Adverse events of special interestThe term adverse events of special interest (AESI) relates to any specific AE that has been 
identified at the project level as being of particular concern for prospective safety monitoring and safety assessment within this trial, e.g. the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. AESIs need to be reported to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAEs, please see Section 5.2.6.2.2 .
The following are considered as AESIs:
Potential Severe DILI
A potential severe Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) that requires follow-up is defined by the 
following alterations of hepatic laboratory parameters: 
For patients with normal hepatic function at baseline:
∀an elevation of AST and/or ALT ≥3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of total 
bilirubin ≥2 fold ULN measured in the same blood sample, or in samples drawn within 
30 days of each other, or
ALT and / or AST elevations ≥10 fold ULN

>1 and <3 x ULN at baseline: 
oAn elevation of AST and/or ALT ≥3 fold the baseline value combined with an 
elevation of bilirubin ≥2 fold ULN (if bilirubin is normal at baseline) or ≥2 fold 
the baseline value (if bilirubin is elevated at baseline), measured in the same blood sample, or in samples drawn within 30 days of each other
oroAminotransferase elevations (ALT and/or AST ≥5 fold the baseline value). 
∀For patients with abnormal aminotransaminase levels; ALT and/or AST between ≥3 
and <5 x ULN at baseline: 
oAn elevation of AST and/or ALT ≥2 fold the baseline value combined with an 
elevation of bilirubin ≥2 fold ULN (if bilirubin is normal at baseline) and/or ≥2 
fold the baseline value (if bilirubin is elevated at baseline) measured in the same blood sample or in samples drawn within 30 days of each other
oroAminotransferase elevations (ALT and/or AST ≥3 fold the baseline value).
These lab findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these lab 
abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the eDC system. In case of clinical symptoms of hepatic injury (icterus, unexplained encephalopathy, unexplained coagulopathy, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the investigator should make sure these parameters are analyzed, if necessary in an unscheduled blood test. Should the results meet the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be followed.

medical interventions and/or prophylaxis as dictated by local institutional clinical practices or the judgment of the investigator, except for:
- Fatigue/ asthenia present at baseline that worsens on study and lasts 
less than 7 days. 
- New onset of Grade 3 nausea or Grade 3 vomiting lasting ≤ 48 hours, 
and which resolved to ≤ Grade 1 either spontaneously or with 
conventional medical intervention. 
- Nausea or vomiting present at baseline that worsens on-study, and 
resolves with treatment within 24 hours.  
- Grade 3 diarrhea not requiring hospitalization, lasting ≤ 48 hours, and 
which resolved to ≤ Grade 1 either spontaneously or with conventional 
medical intervention.
∀Any other toxicity considered significant enough to be qualified as DLT in the 
opinion of the investigator, and confirmed by the SMC, will be reported as a DLT.
∀Any toxicity Grade ≥ 2 leading to dose reduction will be considered as a DLT.
∀Any death not clearly due to the underlying disease or extraneous causes.
Treatment delay ∀Any toxicity that result in a treatment delay >14 days 
Dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be recorded throughout the trial. Any DLT must be 
reported to the Sponsor’s Pharmacovigilance Department by the Investigator or designee within 24 hours of first knowledge regardless of the relationship to the study drug. All DLTs will be agreed upon by the SMC after review of the data from each cohort. Only DLTs occurring in the first two cycles are necessary for dose-escalation decisions made by the SMC. DLTs observed during the MTD evaluation period will be considered for MTD determination. However, all AEs and SAEs meeting criteria of DLT observed in all treatment cycles will be considered for determining a RP2D.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017Replacement of patients for DLT evaluation during MTD evaluation period
For the definition of DLT, it is essential that patients were sufficiently treated according to
supportive care standards described in Section 4.1.4.1 . Patients with treatable AEs (nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea) that were not sufficiently treated did not qualify for DLT and needed
to be replaced, if this occurred in Cycle 1 or 2. Dose escalation was determined based on all the safety information of all treated patients including those who do not complete the first 2 cycles for reasons other than a DLT. Criteria for replacement of patients during the MTD evaluation period is described in Section 3.3.4.4 .
5.2.6.1.6 Intensity (severity) of AEs
The intensity (severity) of adverse events should be classified and recorded in the CRF
according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 5.0 (CTCAE)(R18-1357 ).
5.2.6.1.7 Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judgement should be used to determine whether there is a reasonable possibility of a 
causal relationship between the adverse event and the given study treatment, considering all relevant factors, including pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de-challenge or re-challenge, confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant history. 
Arguments that may suggest that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship could 
be:
∀The event is consistent with the known pharmacology of the drug.
∀The event is known to be caused by or attributed to the drug class.
∀A plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure.
∀Evidence that the event is reproducible when the drug is re-introduced.
∀No medically sound alternative aetiologies that could explain the event (e.g. pre-
existing or concomitant diseases, or co-medications).
∀The event is typically drug-related and infrequent in the general population not 
exposed to drugs (e.g. Stevens-Johnson syndrome).
∀An indication of dose-response (i.e. greater effect size if the dose is increased, smaller 
effect size if dose is reduced).
Arguments that may suggest that there is no reasonable possibility of a causal relationship 
could be:
∀No plausible time to onset of the event relative to the time of drug exposure is evident 
(e.g. pre-treatment cases, diagnosis of cancer or chronic disease within days / weeks of drug administration; an allergic reaction weeks after discontinuation of the drug concerned).
∀Continuation of the event despite the withdrawal of the medication, taking into 
account the pharmacological properties of the compound (e.g. after 5 half-lives).Of note, this criterion may not be applicable to events whose time course is prolonged despite removing the original trigger.

situations where other drugs or underlying diseases appear to provide a more likely explanation for the observed event than the drug concerned).
∀Disappearance of the event even though the trial drug treatment continues or remains 
unchanged.
5.2.6.2 Adverse event collection and reporting
5.2.6.2.1 AE CollectionThe investigator shall maintain and keep detailed records of all AEs in the patient files.
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate CRF(s) by the 
investigator: 
From signing the informed consent onwards until the follow-up visit 1 (including the Residual 
Effect Period, REP):• all AEs (non-serious and serious) and all AESIs.
• After Follow Up visit 1 until the individual patient’s end of trial:
cancers of new histology and exacerbations of existing cancer, all related SAEs and all related AESIs.
• After the individual patient’s end of the trial: 
the investigator does not need to actively monitor the patient for new AEs but should report any occurrence of cancer and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs of which the investigator may become aware of by any means of communication, e.g. phone call. Those AEs should be reported on the BI SAE form (see section 5.2.6.2.2 ), 
but not on the CRF.
The rules for Adverse Event Reporting exemptions still apply please see Section 5.2.6.2.4 .
Vital Status Data Collection
Patients who discontinue trial medication prematurely, who agree to be contacted further but 
do not agree to physical visits, should be followed as described in Section 3.3.4.1 , withdrawal 
from trial treatment. From then on until the individual patient’s end of the trial the investigator 
must report all deaths/fatal AEs regardless of relationship, and trial treatment related SAEs and trial treatment related AESIs the investigator becomes aware of. 
For description of trial completion for an individual patient, refer to Section 6.2.3.4 . 
5.2.6.2.2 AE reporting to the Sponsor and timelines
The investigator must report SAEs, AESIs, and non-serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form via fax immediately (within 24 hours) to the Sponsor’s unique entry point (country specific contact details will be provided in the ISF). The same timeline applies if follow-up information becomes available. In specific occasions,the investigator could inform the Sponsor upfront via telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017With receipt of any further information to these events, a follow-up SAE form has to be 
provided. For follow-up information the same rules and timeline apply as for initial information. All (S)AEs, including those persisting after individual patient’s end of trial must be followed up until they have resolved, have been assessed as “chronic” or “stable” , or no further information can be obtained.
5.2.6.2.3 PregnancyIn rare cases, pregnancy might occur in a clinical trial. Once a patient has been enrolled in the 
clinical trial and has taken trial medication, the investigator must report any drug exposure during pregnancy in a trial participant immediately (within 24 hours) by means of Part A of the Pregnancy Monitoring Form to the Sponsor’s unique entry point.
Similarly, potential drug exposure during pregnancy must be reported if a partner of a male 
trial participant becomes pregnant. This requires a written consent of the pregnant partner; inthe event that consent cannot be obtained, information will be collected and reported in accordance with regulatory requirements. The ISF will contain the trial specific information and consent for the pregnant partner.
The outcome of the pregnancy associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy must be 
followed up and reported to the Sponsor’s unique entry point on the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part B).The ISF will contain the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B).
As pregnancy itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompanying SAE 
and/or AESI, only the Pregnancy Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials and not the SAE form is to be completed. If there is an SAE and/or AESI associated with the pregnancy an SAE form must be completed in addition.
5.2.6.2.4 Exemption to (S)AE reporting
Collection and reporting of PD
The outcome progressive disease (PD) is used to assess trial endpoints for the analysis of 
efficacy. It will be recorded on the appropriate page of the eCRF. Only if it meets standard seriousness criteria (see ‘Serious adverse event’ definition) it will also be recorded on the AE page in the eCRF and on the BI SAE form and SAE reporting process will be followed.
Clinical symptoms and/or signs of PD will be recorded on the AE page in the eCRF. If signs 
and symptoms of progressive disease (PD) of the patient's underlying malignancy meet standard seriousness criteria, they will additionally be reported on the BI SAE form and SAE reporting procedures will be followed.

PHARMACOKINETICS
5.3.1 Assessment of pharmacokinetics
BI 905711 PK parameters will be calculated according to the relevant BI internal procedures.
Pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of BI 905711 will be investigated after the first and after
repeated doses. Standard PK parameters as listed in Appendix 10.1 will be calculated, if data 
allows and if scientifically reasonable. Noncompartmental PK parameters will be calculated 
based on actual sampling times using a validated PK software Phoenix WinNonlinTM (version 8.1.1 or higher, ) or SAS Version 9.4 (or later version).
. Statistical analyses will be performed as described in Section 7.3 . A patient’s PK data will be 
flagged and excluded from the statistical analyses in case of protocol violations relevant to the 
evaluation of PK (to be decided no later than in the Blinded Report Planning Meeting or in case of PK non-evaluability (as revealed during data analysis, based on the criteria specified below). Reasons for exclusion of a patient’s data will be documented in the Clinical Trial Report (CTR). 
PK data may additionally be analyzed using population PK approach. If required, modelling 
activities will be planned and documented separately according to internal and external guidelines and SOP.
Preliminary PK analyses can be performed as necessary, e.g. for SMC decisions. In contrast to 
the final PK analysis, the preliminary analyses will be based on planned sampling times rather than on actual times; no supplementary patient information, e.g. on AEs or concomitant medication, will be used in these analyses, and the outputs will not be validated. Minor discrepancies between preliminary and final results may therefore occur.
5.3.2 Methods of sample collection
Effective from CTP v7.0, PK and ADA samples are no longer collected for ongoing patients.
The timepoints for collection of PK and ADA samples are given in Appendix 10.2 . Details of 
the sample collection, preparation, storage and shipment are described in the ISF/laboratory
manual.
Date and clock time of drug administration(s) and PK sampling will be recorded in the CRFs. 
Exact time points of plasma sampling will be documented in the CRFs by the medical personnel or sent as electronic files to the Trial Data Manager. 
The samples may be used for further methodological investigations, e.g. for further 
investigations to characterise ADA response or to address Health authority questions regarding the results/methodology, stability testing, however, only data related to the analyte and anti-drug antibodies will be generated by these additional investigations.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 20175.5 BIOBANKING (OPTIONAL)
The therapeutic benefit or occurrence of specific adverse events in patients cannot always be 
anticipated during the trial setup. Later on there may be new scientific knowledge about biomarkers and other factors contributing to diseases or the action of a drug. In order to be able to address future scientific questions, patients will be asked to voluntarily donate biospecimens for banking. If the patient agrees, banked samples may be used for future drug development projects, e.g. to identify patients that are more likely to benefit from a treatment or experience an adverse event, and thereby better match patients with therapies or to gain mechanistic understanding of drug effects and/or to identify genetic or other factors associated with response to therapy or the risk of adverse drug reactions. Participation in biobanking is voluntary and not a prerequisite for participation in the trial. Biobanking samples will only be banked after a separate biobanking informed consent has been given in accordance with local ethical and regulatory requirements.
Measures are in place to comply with the applicable rules for the collection, biobanking and 
future use of biological samples and clinical data, see Section 8.5.1 .
The leftovers of the following biomarker samples as specified in Section 5.4 might be banked:
∀Leftover tumor tissue or derivatives (e.g., RNA, DNA)
∀Leftover from patient’s plasma
5.5.1 Methods and timing of sample collection
Detailed instructions on sampling, preparation, processing, shipment and storage are provided 
in the laboratory manual. For sampling timepoints see the Flowchart .
All leftover biomarker samples (except for sample for genomic DNA), as specified in Section
5.4, may be banked if the biobanking consent has been signed by the patient. Samples will be 
stored at an external biobanking facility contracted by the Sponsor. If the patient has not 
consented to optional biobanking (see Section 5.5 ) trial samples left over after primary 
analysis will be discarded after completion of these additional investigations but not later than 
5 years after the final trial report has been signed.

6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
Patients must satisfy all inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to treatment administration (see
Section 3.3 ). Details of any patient who is screened for the study but is found ineligible must
be entered in an enrollment log (see ISF) and documented in the eCRF. All patients are to 
adhere to the visit schedule as specified in the Flowchart .
If a patient misses a visit during which there is no treatment administration planned, the visit 
should be rescheduled as soon as possible and the delayed visit documented with the actual date and the reason for the delay. The scheduling of subsequent visits must not be altered, so if it is not possible to reschedule prior to the next planned visit, the missed visit should be skipped.
In the event of force majeure or other disruptive circumstances (e.g. pandemic, war) the 
investigational plan as per this clinical trial protocol may not be feasible at a site. With the consent of the patient, sponsor and investigator may agree on alternative, back-up or rescue methodology which may include but will not be limited to virtual patient visits and assessments, and home healthcare nurse visits. The implementation of these measures will depend on patient’s consent, operational feasibility, local law and regulations. If alternative methodology is implemented, the deviations from the original plan will be precisely documented.
6.2 DETAILS OF TRIAL PROCEDURES AT SELECTED VISITS
6.2.1 Screening period
Screening for Phase Ia, and Phase Ib CRC patients
The examinations required for the screening visit may be conducted within a time interval of
28 days prior to the first study drug administration. Tumor assessments performed prior to informed consent as part of routine clinical practice will be accepted if they meet the requirements of the protocol and are performed within 28 days prior to treatment start.
Screening for Phase Ib PDAC patients 
There are two screening visits for PDAC patients in Phase Ib: screening Visit 1 (SV1) for CDH17 status, and screening Visit 2 (SV2) for entry into the treatment period and treatment. 
Screening visit 1 (SV1) for CDH17 status
The purpose of SV1 for CDH17 status is to offer testing for CHD17 status in archival 
tumour tissue or in fresh biopsy before proceeding into SV2 for entry into the treatment period. This procedure will require a separate informed consent (Tissue Analysis Consent) for assessment of CHD17 expression via a central laboratory designated by the sponsor. 
No maximum time between SV1 for CDH17 status and SV2 for entry into the 
treatment period is defined, and the two screening visits can occur in parallel.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017Therefore, patients can be enrolled in the SV1 for CDH17 status at any time, even 
while ongoing on other treatments and/or clinical trials.
Screening visit 2 (SV2) for entry into the treatment period
The purpose of SV2 is to check full patient eligibility according to in/exclusion 
criteria. Following informed consent for main study, patients will undergo screening assessment as indicated in the Flowchart . 
The SV2 assessments should be performed after CDH17 status is known within 28
days prior to start of treatment (screening visit window) but do not need to be performed on the same day. 
For patients whose eligibility was based on archival tissue that is more than 6 months 
old during SV1, a confirmatory test will be performed on a fresh biopsy that should be collected during SV2. SV2 fresh biopsy analysis will not prevent patient enrolment, should SV1 analysis show CDH17 positivity. SV2 analysis will be only used as a retrospective confirmation of CDH17 positivity.

status and on SV2 for entry into the treatment period.
Baseline Conditions
Any new clinically relevant findings assessed during the screening visit should be included in 
the eCRF. Baseline conditions including demographics, sex, birth date, race, and ethnicity (in accordance with local laws and regulations), and concomitant diagnoses and/or therapies present during screening, will be recorded in the eCRF.

SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
The trial will be performed as an open-label trial. There will be 2 parts phase Ia and Ib, which 
have different objectives and designs. 
Phase Ia : 
The primary objective of phase Ia is to determine the MTD of BI 905711 defined as the highest dose with less than 25% risk of the true DLT rate being equal or above 0.33 (EWOC criterion). Dose-escalation will be guided by a two-parameter Bayesian Logistic Regression 
Model (BLRM), escalating with overdose control (EWOC) ( R13-4803 ; R13-4806 ).
The Bayesian logistic regression model (BLRM) is formulated as follows:
logit(πd) = log(α) + β*log(d/d*), 
where logit( π) = log(π/(1-π)).
πdrepresents the probability of having a DLT in the MTD evaluation period at dose d, d* =  
3.6 mg/kg is the reference dose, allowing for the interpretation of α as the odds of a DLT at 
dose d*, and θ = (log(α), log(β)) with α, β > 0 is the parameter vector of the model.
The estimated probability of a DLT at each dose level from the model will be summarized 
using the following intervals:
Under toxicity: [0.00, 0.16)
Targeted toxicity: [0.16, 0.33)Over toxicity: [0.33, 1.00]
The BLRM-recommended dose for the next dose cohort is the dose level with the highest 
posterior probability of the DLT rate falling in the target interval of [0.16, 0.33) among the doses fulfilling the EWOC principle. With the EWOC criterion, it should be unlikely (i.e. posterior probability <25%) that the DLT rate at the recommended dose will exceed 0.33. However, according to the dose selection scheme in Table 4.1.2.1:1 , the maximum allowable 
dose increment for each escalation step shall not be more than 230%. 
The MTD will be considered reached if one of the following criteria is fulfilled: 
∀the posterior probability of the true DLT rate in the target interval [0.16, 0.33) of the 
MTD is above 0.5
OR 
∀at least 15 patients have been treated in phase Ia, of which at least 6 at the MTD. 
The SMC may recommend stopping the dose escalation phase after the criterion for MTD is 
fulfilled.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017Since a Bayesian approach is applied, a prior distribution f( θ) for the unknown parameter vector 
θ needs to be specified. This prior distribution used in the BLRM will be specified as a mixture 
of three multivariate normal distributions, i.e.
а(θ) = a 1f1(θ) + a 2f2(θ) + a 3f3(θ)
witha
i, i = 1, 2, 3 the prior mixture weights (a 1+ a2+ a 3= 1)

matrix Σi, where 
Σ =   
 ,    ,    ,    
  ,    ,      
 ,   
Mixture prior distributions have the advantage that they allow for specification of different 
logistic dose-toxicity curves, therefore making the prior more robust.
Prior derivation:
For the current trial, no relevant information in the form of human data was available, since 
no trial has been conducted before. Therefore, the three mixture components are established as follows:
1. A weakly informative prior was derived to reflect a priori assumption that the median DLT 
rate at the starting dose of 0.02 mg/kg would equal 1%, and the median DLT rate at 4.8mg/kg would equal 15%. This yields μ
1= (-1.885, -0.650). The standard deviations were 
set such that large uncertainty about the parameter means is reflected, and the correlation was set to 0, thus yielding σ
1,11= 2, σ1,22  = 1 and ρ1= 0, respectively. The prior weight a 1
for the first component was chosen as 0.9.
2. A high-toxicity weakly informative prior was derived to reflect the case that the compound 
would be much more toxic than expected. For this prior component, it was assumed that the median DLT rate at the starting dose of 0.02mg/kg would equal 20%, and the median DLT rate at 4.8mg/kg would equal 60%. These assumptions yield μ
2= (0.311, -1.118). The 
standard deviations and correlations were set id entical to the weakly informative prior, i.e. 
σ2,11= 2, σ2,22  = 1 and ρ2= 0, respectively. The prior weight a 2for the second component 
was chosen as 0.05.
3. A low-toxicity weakly informative prior was derived to reflect the case that the compound 
would be much less toxic than expected. For this prior component, it was assumed that the median DLT rate at the starting dose of 0.02mg/kg would equal 0.1%, and the median DLT rate 4.8mg/kg would equal 2%. These assumptions yield μ
3= (-4.050, -0.598). The standard 
deviations and correlations were set to σ3,11= 5, σ3,22  = 0.01, therefore almost fixing the 
slope parameter to its mean. The correlation was set to 0, i.e. ρ3= 0. The prior weight a 3for 
the third component was chosen as 0.05.
A summary of the prior distribution is provided in Table 7.1: 1 . Additionally, the prior 
probabilities of DLTs at different doses, as well as the corresponding probability of under-, 
targeted and overtoxicity, are shown in Table 7.1: 2 . Graphically, the prior medians with

Beyond the abovementioned BLRM that considers mainly DLT probability, in order to select 
the dose(s) for phase Ib, we will also consider plasma PK data, biomarker and efficacy data as available. For example, a BLRM that computes the posterior probability of the plasma PK (AUC) falling in a target range (e.g. 80% maximal efficacy exposure) if applicable.
Phase Ib:
In this phase, patients will be randomised into five cohorts of BI 905711 with approximately 
80 patients (see section 4.1.2.2 ).  Dose(s) selection for phase Ib was made by a SMC with the 
aim to select a safe and potentially effective dose range of BI 905711 based on all data 
collected in phase Ia.  
Data collected during this phase Ib will be recorded and presented by descriptive statistics. If applicable, we may use Bayesian hierarchical models incorporating biomarker information
to support decision-making in selecting the RP2D.
If the trial is terminated due to unexpected causes, only descriptive analysis will be provided.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 20177.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
No formal hypothesis testing is planned in this trial. All analyses in this trial are descriptive 
and exploratory in nature.
7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES
Analysis of efficacy and safety will be based on the treated set, which will consist of all 
patients who receive at least one dose of BI 905711.
For the determination of the MTD, only DLT evaluable patients will be considered. Patients 
will be analyzed according to their starting doses. Any other analysis sets will be defined in the TSAP. No per protocol set will be used in the analysis. However, important protocol violations will be summarised. The TSAP will specify the important protocol violations in detail.
7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses
Phase Ia: In order to determine the MTD, the number of patients with DLTs will be assessed 
per dose level in phase Ia. The MTD will be determined as described in Section 7.1 . Patients 
with DLTs that occurred during the first two treatment cycles and later cycles may be 
tabulated separately.
For doses that will be recommended for phase Ib, totality of data will be considered including 
efficacy and PK. Details are described in Section 3.1.1 .
Time frame: Database lock (DBL) will occur when either MTD is found or the recommended 
dose range for phase Ib is determined, and all the patients have had at least 2 post-baseline tumor assessment timepoints excluding patients who have discontinued earlier. 
Phase Ib: 
The primary endpoints in the dose-expansion part are objective response (OR) and PFS 
derived from the data of all cycles. The PFS will be summarized using PFS4 rate, defined as the proportion of patients with PFS >= 4 months, and will be presented descriptively.Objective response will be analyzed in terms of objective response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). For each dose level, the proportion of patients with objective response (CR and PR) will be calculated with 95% confidence interval.
The observed response rate and PFS4 rate for different dose levels will be compared to 
recommend the optimal dose level (RP2D). If applicable, a Bayesian hierarchical model will be used to get the adjusted response rate for each dose level, and comparisons will be made among different dose levels to make a recommendation on the optimal dose level (RP2D). 
Time frame: The database lock will occur after all treated patients have had at least three post-
baseline tumor assessment timepoints (unless patients discontinue the treatment early due to any reasons). A clinical trial report will follow.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 20177.3.2 Secondary endpoint analyses
Secondary endpoints will be analyzed by descriptive statistics. PK analyses are specified in 
Section 7.3.5 and Section 5.3 .
Time frame: the same as the primary endpoint analyses time frame. 
Details will be provided in the TSAP.
7.3.4 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities
(MedDRA). Standard BI summary tables and listings will be produced. All adverse events with an onset between start of treatment and end of the REP, a period of 30 days (+ ≤ 5 days) 
after the last dose of trial medication, will be assigned to the on-treatment period for evaluation.
All treated patients will be included in the safety analysis. In general, safety analyses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be based on BI standards. No hypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analysis and reporting of adverse events will concentrate on treatment-emergent 
adverse events, i.e. all adverse events occurring between start of treatment and end of the REP. Adverse events that start before first drug intake and deteriorate under treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment-emergent’.
Frequency, severity, and causal relationship of adverse events will be tabulated by system 
organ class and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Drug Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) at database lock.
Laboratory data will be analyzed both quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The latter will be 
done via comparison of laboratory data to their reference ranges. Values outside the reference range as well as values defined as clinically relevant will be summarised. Treatment groupswill be compared descriptively with regard to distribution parameters as well as with regard to frequency and percentage of patients with abnormal values or clinically relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs, physical examinations, or other safety-relevant data observed at screening, 
baseline, during the course of the trial and at the end-of-trial evaluation will be assessed with regard to possible changes compared to findings before start of treatment.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 20177.3.5 Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic analyses
The PK parameters will be calculated by means of non-compartmental analysis. Descriptive 
statistics will be used to evaluate plasma concentration data and PK parameters. PK parameters will be calculated according to the relevant BI internal procedures.Further details on analysis will be described in the TSAP.
7.4 INTERIM ANALYSES
The Sponsor will continuously monitor the safety. The dose escalation design foresees that the 
Sponsor and the SMC perform regular safety evaluations. These evaluations will be unblinded.
For efficacy, in phase Ib, an arm might be terminated early due to futility if lack of efficacy 
signal (in terms of OR, PFS and PD-modulation) observed among evaluable patients. If any DLTs observed in patients enrolled in phase Ib, the BLRM will be run to confirm if the dose level still fulfills the overdose risk control. 
No formal interim analysis is planned for PK and immunogenicity.Preliminary, exploratory analysis of PK and if applicable of immunogenicity will be 
performed prior to database lock during study conduct based on all evaluable data at the time of analysis. This will be performed to support dose escalations and e.g. in case the information is needed to inform other activities during the development of substance such as concomitant treatment restrictions in other trials. In contrast to the final calculations, the preliminary, exploratory analysis will be based on planned sampling times rather than on actual times, regardless of whether actual times were within the time windows or not. Therefore, minor deviations of preliminary and final results may occur. No formal preliminary PK and immunogenicity report will be written.
7.5 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA
No imputation will be performed on missing efficacy data. Missing baseline laboratory values 
will be imputed by the respective values from the screening visit. No other imputations will be performed on missing data although every effort will be made to obtain complete information on all adverse events, with particular emphasis on potential DLTs.
Pharmacokinetcis:Handling of missing PK data will be performed according to the relevant BI internal
procedure.PK parameters that cannot be reasonably calculated based on the available drug concentration-time data will not be imputed.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017If the actual sampling time is not recorded or is missing for a certain time point, the planned
time will generally be used for this time point instead. Pharmacokinetic parameters whichcannot be determined will be identified by "not calculated" (NC).
7.6 RANDOMISATION
For phase Ib, patients will be randomised into four cohorts of BI 905711 with approximately 
60 patients.  BI will arrange for the randomisation and the packaging and labelling of trialmedication. The randomisation list will be generated using a validated system, which involves a pseudo-random number generator so that the resulting treatment will be both reproducible and non-predictable. Access to the randomisation list will be controlled and documented.
7.7 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE
No formal statistical power calculations to determine sample size were performed for this 
trial. In total, approximately up to 140 patients are planned (
approximately 40 evaluable CRC 
patients and 20 non-CRC GI cancer patients for phase Ia, approximately 60 evaluable CRC 
patients and 20 PDAC patients for phase Ib) for this study. 
For phase Ia:
Given the pre-specified possible dose levels ( Table 4.1.2.1: 1 ) and the number of patients per 
dose level, approximately 28 CRC patients will be needed to complete dose escalation. 
The actual number of patients will depend on the number of dose cohorts and the cohort sizes 
actually tested. Based on the simulation studies to evaluate operating characteristics of the BLRM (see Appendix 10.3 ), on average 20-36 evaluable patients are expected to be treated in 
the dose escalation part for safety evaluation for the model to have reasonable operating 
characteristics relating to its MTD recommendation.
In addition, 12 CRC patients are planned for efficacy evaluation in phase Ia. Thus, for 
planning purpose, a total of 40 CRC patients and 20 non-CRC patients are planned for phase Ia.
For phase Ib (Part B):
For planning purposes, up to 15 CRC patients per each dose group for up to 4 cohorts, i.e. 
total of up to 60 CRC patients, and up to 20 PDAC patients for the single arm cohort will be enrolled for this part.
A Bayesian Hierarchical Model (BHM) approach ( R13-4803 ) will be used to analyze the 
PFS4/ORR rate based on all data from different arms. The simulation results in Table 7.7: 1
show that with the proposed sample size per arm, the BHM approach has reasonable 
performance under a wide range of scenarios. The probability of passing the positive boundaries under a negative scenario is well controlled per arm (<= 3%). The probability of passing the positive boundaries under a positive/mix scenario is at least 75% per arm.

Re-consenting may become necessary when new relevant information becomes available and 
should be conducted according to the Sponsor’s instructions. The consent and re-consenting process should be properly documented in the source documentation.
8.2 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE
A risk-based approach is used for trial quality management. It is initiated by the assessment of 
critical data and processes for trial patient protection and reliability of the results as well as identification and assessment of associated risks. An Integrated Quality and Risk Management Plan documents the rationale and strategies for risk management during trial conduct including monitoring approaches, vendor management and other processes focusing on areas of greatest risk.
Continuous risk review and assessment may lead to adjustments in trial conduct, trial design 
or monitoring approaches. 
A quality assurance audit/inspection of this trial may be conducted by the Sponsor, Sponsor’s 
designees, or by IRB / IEC or by regulatory authorities. The quality assurance auditor will have access to all medical records, the investigator’s trial-related files and correspondence, and the informed consent documentation of this clinical trial.
8.3 RECORDS
CRFs for individual patients will be provided by the Sponsor. For drug accountability, refer to 
Section 4.1.8 .
8.3.1 Source documents
In accordance with regulatory requirements, the investigator should prepare and maintain 
adequate and accurate source documents and trial records that include all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation on each trial patient. Source data as well as reported data should follow the “ALCOA principles” and be attributable, legible, contemporaneous, 
original and accurate. Changes to the data should be traceable (audit trail).
Data reported on the CRF must be consistent with the source data or the discrepancies must be 
explained.
The current medical history of the patient may not be sufficient to confirm eligibility for the 
trial and the investigator may need to request previous medical histories and evidence of any diagnostic tests. In this case, the investigator must make three documented attempts to retrieve previous medical records. If this fails, a verbal history from the patient, documented in their medical records, would be acceptable.

review. Before sending or uploading those copies, the investigator must ensure that all patientidentifiers (e.g. patient’s name, initials, address, phone number, social security number) have properly been removed or redacted from any copy of the patients’ source documents.
If the patient is not compliant with the protocol, any corrective action e.g. re-training must be 
documented in the patient file.For the CRF, data must be derived from source documents, for example:
∀Patient identification: gender, year of birth (in accordance with local laws and 
regulations)
∀Patient participation in the trial (substance, trial number, patient number, date patient
was informed)
∀Dates of patient’s visits, including dispensing of trial medication
∀Medical history (including trial indication and concomitant diseases, if applicable)
∀Medication history
∀Adverse events and outcome events (onset date (mandatory), and end date (if 
available))
∀Serious adverse events (onset date (mandatory), and end date (if available))
∀Concomitant therapy (start date, changes)
∀Originals or copies of laboratory results and other imaging or testing results, with 
proper documented medical evaluation (in validated electronic format, if available)
∀Completion of patient’s participation in the trial” (end date; in case of premature 
discontinuation document the reason for it).
∀Prior to allocation of a patient to a treatment into a clinical trial, there must be 
documented evidence in the source data (e.g. medical records) that the trial participant meets all inclusion criteria and does not meet any exclusion criteria. The absence of records (either medical records, verbal documented feedback of the patient or testing conducted specific for a protocol) to support inclusion/exclusion criteria does not make the patient eligible for the clinical trial.
8.3.2 Direct access to source data and documents
The investigator /institution will allow site trial-related monitoring, audits, IRB / IEC review 
and regulatory inspections. Direct access must be provided to the CRF and all source documents/data, including progress notes, copies of laboratory and medical test results, which must be available at all times for review by the CRA, auditor and regulatory inspector (e.g. FDA). They may review all CRFs and informed consents. The accuracy of the data will be verified by direct comparison with the source documents described in Section 8.3.1 .T h e  
Sponsor will also monitor compliance with the protocol and GCP.
In the event of force majeure or other disrupting circumstances (e.g. pandemic, war, please see 
Section 6 ), site access may be restricted thus limiting the ability to perform standard site 
monitoring activities on site such as on-site source data review and source data verification. 
Therefore, some of these activities may be performed remotely or replaced by centralized monitoring to the extent possible, based on a documented risk assessment and in alignment with local regulations.

The start of the trial is defined as the date when the first patient in the whole trial signs 
informed consent.
The end of the trial is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient in the whole trial
(“Last Patient Completed”) or when all patients have been discontinued from study treatment and have been followed up for overall survival for at least 12 weeks after treatment discontinuation. The “ Last Patient Last Treatment” (LPLT) date is defined as the date on which the last 
patient in the whole trial is administered the last dose of trial treatment (as scheduled per protocol or prematurely). Individual investigators will be notified of SUSARs occurring with the trial medication until 30 days after LPLT at their site.
The “ Last Patient Last Visit Primary Endpoint (LPLV PE) ” is defined as the date at which 
the last patient was examined or received an intervention for the purposes of final collection of data for the primary endpoint (according to the protocol specified schedule or after premature discontinuation) for each part of the trial. Patient treatment and follow up may continue after this time point. For phase Ia, if the last patient is enrolled for dose escalation evaluation, this is the date when the patient has had Cycle 3 Day 1 visit or EOR visit (if the patient is discontinued early). If the last patient is enrolled for efficacy evaluation in phase Ia or Ib, this is the date when the patient has had at least three tumor assessment timepoints (unless the patient discontinues the treatment early due to any reasons). 
Early termination of the trial is defined as the premature termination of the trial due to any 
reason before the end of the trial as specified in this protocol.Temporary halt of the trial is defined as any unplanned interruption of the trial by the 
Sponsor with the intention to resume it.Suspension of the trial is defined as an interruption of the trial based on a Health Authority 
request.
The IEC / competent authority in each participating EU member state will be notified about 
the trial milestones according to the respective laws.
A final report of the clinical trial data will be written only after all patients have completed the 
trial in all countries (EU or non-EU) to incorporate and consider all data in the report.The Sponsor will submit to the EU database a summary of the final trial results within one year from the end of a clinical trial as a whole, regardless of the country of the last patient (EU or non-EU).
8.7 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE OF THE TRIAL
The trial is sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI).
A Coordinating Investigator is responsible to coordinate investigators at the different sites 
participating in this trial. Tasks and responsibilities are defined in a contract.

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 2017The following committees will be established to evaluate data and allow transition between 
components of the study.
SMC (Safety Monitoring Committee)
The SMC served for decision regarding dose escalation in phase Ia and dose(s) determination for phase Ib. SMC will be composed of participating investigators in dose escalation and members of the BI trial team. SMC reviewed individual and aggregated safety data at regular intervals to determine the safety profile and risk/benefit ratio and recommend next dose leveland appropriateness of further enrollment into dose level cohorts following escalation rules as described in the CTP. Details of the SMC responsibilities and procedures were described in the SMC charter.
Relevant documentation on the participating (Principal) Investigators (e.g. their curricula 
vitae) were filed in the ISF. The investigators had access to the BI clinical trial portal (Clinergize) to facilitate document exchange and maintain electronic ISF. 
BI has appointed a CT Leader, responsible for coordinating all required activities, in order to 
- manage the trial in accordance with applicable regulations and internal SOPs,- direct the clinical trial team in the preparation, conduct, and reporting of the trial,- ensure appropriate training and information of Clinical Trial Managers (CT 
Managers), Clinical Research Associates (CRAs), and investigators of participating countries.
The organisation of the trial in the participating countries will be performed by the respective local or regional BI-organisation (Operating Unit, OPU) in accordance with applicable regulations and BI SOPs, or by a Contract Research Organisation (CRO) with which the responsibilities and tasks will have been agreed and a written contract filed before initiation of the clinical trial.
Data Management and Statistical Evaluation will be done by BI according to BI SOPs.Tasks and functions assigned in order to organise, manage, and evaluate the trial are defined 
according to BI SOPs. A list of responsible persons and relevant local information can be found in the ISF. An IRT vendor will be used in this trial. Details will be provided in the IRT Manual, available in the ISF.

10.1 PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES
If feasible, BI 905711 PK parameters will be calculated according to the relevant BI internal 
procedures.
After the first doses:
• Cmax (maximum measured concentration)
• AUC0- ∞ (area under the concentration-time curve over the time interval from zero 
extrapolated to infinity)
• AUC0-tz (area under the concentration-time curve over the time interval from 0 up to 
the last quantifiable data point)
•t z(time point of the last quantifiable plasma concentration)
• %AUCtz- ∞ (the percentage of the AUC0- ∞ that is obtained by extrapolation)
• AUCt1-t2 (area under the concentration time curve over the time interval t1 to t2)• tmax (time from dosing to the maximum measured concentration)• Cpre,N (the pre-dose concentration of the analyte in plasma immediately before 
administration of the Nth dose after N-1 doses were administered)
• t1/2 (terminal half-life)• CL (total clearance of the analyte)• Vz (apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase)• Vss (volume of distribution after intravenous infusion)
If feasible, the following additional PK parameters may be determined after repeated doses 
[e.g. if steady state can reasonably be assumed, the parameters will be denoted with ss as shown; otherwise, they will be denoted with the dose number of the last dose]:
• Cmax,ss (maximum measured concentration at steady state)
• Cmin,ss (minimum concentration at steady state)• tmin,ss (time to reach minimum concentration at steady state)• Cavg (average concentration at steady state)• Cpre, N,ss (pre-dose concentration at steady state immediately before administration 
of the next dose)
• AUCτ,ss (area under the concentration-time curve at steady state over a uniform 
dosing interval τ)
• AUCt1-t2,ss (area under the concentration time curve over the time interval t1 to t2 at 
steady state)
• tmax,ss (time from last dosing to maximum concentration at steady state)•t
z,ss(time of last measurable concentration within the dosing interval τ at steady state)
•λz,ss (terminal rate constant at steady state)
• t1/2,ss (terminal half-life at steady state)• MRTinf,ss (mean residence time in the body after intravenous infusion at steady state)• CLss (total clearance at steady state)• Vz,ss (volume of distribution during the terminal phase after multiple intravascular
administrations at steady)

001-MCS-40-106-RD-03 (15.0) / Saved on: 30. Nov 201710.3 DETAILS OF BLRM SETUP AND OPERATING CHARACTERISTICS
The BLRM was assessed by two different metrics: hypothetical on-study data scenarios and 
long-run operating characteristics. The simulations for scenarios and operating characteristics were produced using R version 3.4.2 and Jags version 4.3.0. Both the hypothetical data scenarios and the operating characteristics are based on the CRC patients data for safety evaluation only. Note that in the real trial more data will be available from the non-CRC GI cancer patients and also from additional patients enrolled for efficacy evaluation which will lead to improved data scenarios and operating characteristics
Hypothetical data scenariosHypothetical data scenarios are shown in Table 10.3: 1 . These scenarios reflect potential on-
study data constellations and related escalation as allowed by the model. For each scenario, the 
probability of overdose for the current dose is shown, as well as the next optimal dose recommended by the model in terms of the probability of target dose, and the related probabilities of under-dosing, target dose, and overdosing for the next optimal dose. The actual dose chosen for the next cohort, not shown in Table 10.3: 1, will be determined by the SMC after taking into consideration of the recommended dose from the model as well as other relevant data from this study.
For example, scenario 1 represents the case that no DLT is observed in the first patient at the 
starting dose of 0.02 mg/kg. In this case, the next dose permitted by the model and by the escalation rule is 0.06 mg/kg. Similarly scenarios 3 and 6 represent cases where no DLTs are 
observed, and the model will recommend escalatin g to the next dose level that is permitted by 
escalation rule. In scenario 2, one DLT is observed already in the patient at the lowest dose level. In this case, the model cannot provide the next recommended dose level. However, according the escalation rule specified in Section 3.1.1 , two more patients may be enrolled into 
this dose level. The same holds for scenario 4.
Scenarios 17 illustrate a case where dose level 2.4 mg/kg has probability of overdose exceeds 
25%, per BLRM with the given provisional dose levels, the next optimal dose recommended would be 1.2 mg/kg. However, BLRM has flexibility to explore intermediate dose level, in both scenarios, if intermediate dose levels of 1.6 mg/kg and 1.8 mg/kg are explored, 1.6 mg/kg would be recommended as the next dose level because it has the highest probability of target dose, and overdose probability less than 25%. 
Scenario 20 illustrates a case where low dose cohorts have no DLT, or 1 DLT, and the highest 
dose level 4.8 mg/kg has 1 DLT. In such cases, BLRM would continue to put patients on 4.8 mg/kg, but if higher dose levels are allowed, higher level e.g. 6.4 mg/kg would be recommended.

Operating characteristics
Operating characteristics are a way to assess the long-run behaviour of a model. Under an 
assumed true dose-toxicity curve, metrics such as the probability of recommending a dose with true DLT rate in the target interval can be approximated via simulation. Table 10.3: 2 describes

of the model. These scenarios reflect a wide range of possible cases. Scenario 1 represents the DLT rates that are aligned with prior means per dose level. Scenarios 2 and 3 reflect the extreme cases of high and low t oxicity probabilities, respectively. Scenario  4 represents an even more 
extreme case with very low toxicity probability.  Scenario 5 covers the case of a true dose-
toxicity relationship that does not have a logistic form. Finally, Scenarios 6 and 7 reflect the possibility of having non-monotonic true dose-toxicity relationship.

* Additional dose level 300mg added (assumed true tox probability of 0.789) to allow R code to run
For each of these scenarios, 1000 trials were simulated. 4 patients per dose cohort were assumed 
as default cohort size for the simulations. It was then assessed how often a dose was declared as MTD with true DLT rate in the under-, targeted or over-dose range. Furthermore, the average, minimum and maximum number of patients per trial and the average number of DLTs per trial are reported. Results are shown in Table 10.3: 3 .

*1 trial declared the additional dose 300mg/kg as MTD
In Scenario 1, which reflects the case that the t rue dose-toxicity is aligned with prior means, 
62.7% of the simulated trials declared a dose as MTD with true DLT rate in the targeted dose range. 
Scenarios 4 and 5 (very low-toxicity scenario) s hows, that when the true DLT rate is very low, 
i.e. the majority dose levels with true DLT rate below the target interval, then more likely the model will declare a underdose as MTD. Since in scenario 4 none of the dose levels has an assumed true toxicity rate in the target interva l, none of the simulated trials has declared a MTD 
with true DLT rate in the target dose range. In scenario 5 only few dose level was assumed to have true DLT rate in the target range, but at the upper end of the target range, therefore only a low number of simulated trials declared MTD at this dose with true DLT rate in the target range. The probability of observing a DLT at 1.2mg/kg is 0.13 and therefore close to the lower bound of the target interval. Adding up the corresponding probability of declaring this dose as an MTD (35.8% leads to a target rate of 83.2). Both scenarios have a very low percentage of trials stopped since no MTD was reached (either because the maximum number of patients was reached before declaring MTD or because too many DLTs were simulated to continue escalation).
In Scenarios 6 and 7, dose-toxicity relationship is non-monotonic. Scenarios 6 and 7 illustrates 
that the majority simulated trials (over 70%) declare the target dose levels as MTD. 
The mean patient numbers across different scenarios is around 28, though the maximum can go 
up to 52 during simulation. This shows that the planned maximum of 40 patients is reasonable for phase Ia. 
In summary, the considered data scenarios s how a reasonable behaviour of the model and the 
operating characteristics demonstrate a good precision of MTD determination.

collection in phase Ib
Rationale for change Availability and willingness to provide an 
archived tumor tissue specimen and undergo tumor biopsy before treatment. Pre-treatment fresh tumor biopsy collections for biomarker analyses are considered optional in phase Ia and mandatory in phase Ib. Only non-significant riskprocedures per the investigator’s judgment will be used to obtain any biopsies specified in this study. In case a fresh tumor biopsy cannot be obtained due to before mentioned reasons an archived tumor tissue specimen obtained within ≤6 months 
of screening must be submitted. In case the patient undergoes baseline tumor biopsy, an archived tumor tissue specimen must be submitted regardless of the date of collection.

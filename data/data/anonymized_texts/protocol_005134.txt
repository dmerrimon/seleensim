 1 BACKGROUND AND SIGNI FICANCE  
  
According to the American Diabetes Association  the cost to treat diabetes has risen to $245 
billion of which antidiabetic medications including insulin account s for 12% of the total costs.[ 1] 
People with diagnosed diabetes incur average medical expenditures of approximately $13,700 
per year creating a  high cost burden carried by themselves and insurers .[1] As the population 
ages and as disease progresses, the amount of medications prescribed will increase which can 
further escalate the financial burden to both the subject  and health care system.   
 
With the progression of diabetes, insulin therapy is warranted for most subject s and many require 
both fasting and prandial insulin due to inadequate insulin secretion and insulin resistance in type 
2 diabetes.  Different types of insulin are available with n ew analogue insulins typically 
preferred over RHI (RHI) due to improved insulin profiles and a more predictable glucose 
response when given via subcutaneous injection . [2] Ninety -six percent (96%) of subject s with 
type 2 diabetes who take insulin in the Un ited States use analog insulin(s). This is an increase 
from 19% in the year 2000.  [3,4]  In subject s prescribed basal -bolus or bolus -only therapy,  rapid 
acting insulin (RAI) analogs have surpassed usage of RHI.  However, the steep increase in the 
cost of RAI has led to rationing of insulin or the total discontinuance of therap y by many 
subject s due to cost.  [5] The lack of affordability of RAI has forced the clinical and economic 
benefits of RAI to be reconsidered in clinical practice and in literature. Fo r many subject s, RHI 
provides a more affordable option for insulin therapy when compared to RAIs, especially if the 
limitations of the insulin profile can be overcome by delivering RAI through continuous 
subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) using a wearabl e insulin delivery device.   
 
V-Go (Valeritas, Inc. Bridgewater, NJ) is worn like a patch, and insulin is initiated when the 
subject  presses a button to insert a small needle subcutaneously.  Once the needle is inserted, a 
continuous basal rate of insulin is delivered for 24 hours, and on -demand bolus dosing of insulin 
can be administered in 2 -unit increments to meet prandial (mealtime ) insulin needs by pressing 
two buttons. [6]  Tubing, programming, or batteries are not required with V -Go, unlike other CSII 
devices.  V-Go is cleared by the FDA for use with a U-100 fast -acting insulin (e.g. insulin lispro, 
insulin aspart)  and has been pro ven to improve clinical outcomes with less insulin .    
 
Research has demonstrated as the cost of treatment increases the  patient adherence decreases, 
which  can be associated with poor health outcomes .[7,8,9]  Based on the rising costs for insulin 
analogs, investigating the prospective use of RHI delivered with V -Go could be a viable option 
6 
 to decrease costs while improving glycemic control.  The utilization of RHI addresses the issue 
of affordability and cost challenges for many subject s and insurance plans . 
 
2 ETHICS  
 
2.1 Good Clinical Practice (GCP)  
This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), in accordance 
with the United States Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 50 (21CFR50). The study will 
be conducted in compliance w ith the protocol.  
All potential protocol deviations or violations must be reported to the IRB immediately. A 
protocol deviation or violation is defined as a violation of the GCP guidelines regarding the 
study protocol, which is likely to significantly aff ect the safety of the subjects in the study or the 
scientific validity of the study. Study staff involved in conducting this study will be qualified by 
education, training, and experience to perform their respective tasks and this study will not use 
study staff where there has been scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure, 
debarment).  
2.2 Institutional Review Board (IRB)  
Before initiation of the study, the investigator must have received IRB approval for the protocol, 
ICF, subject recruitment materials (eg, advertisements), and any other written information to be 
provided to subjects.   
During the clinical study, any amend ment to the clinical trial protocol must be submitted to the 
IRB before implementation, unless the change is necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to 
the subjects, in which case the IRB should be informed as soon as possible. The IRB should also 
be in formed of any event likely to change the safety of subjects in the clinical trial. The 
investigator must send a progress report to the IRB at least annually, as well as a summary of the 
clinical trial’s outcome at the end of the clinical trial.  
2.3 Informed Consent  
The investigator will ensure that the ICF includes all elements required by GCP and applicable 
regulatory requirements, as well as follow the ethical principles within the Declaration of 
Helsinki. The investigator will ensure that the ICF is review ed and approved by the IRB prior to 
use in a clinical trial.  
7 
 The Investigator, or a person designated by the Investigator, should fully inform the subject of all 
relevant aspects of the clinical trial including the purpose, potential risks, required proce dures, 
etc. in which they volunteer to participate.  All subjects should be informed about the study, in a 
language and at a level they are able to understand. In circumstances where consent cannot be 
given to subjects, their legally acceptable representati ves must be clearly and fully informed 
about the purpose, potential risks, required procedures, etc. regarding the clinical trial in which 
the subject will  participate   
Prior to a subject’s participation in the clinical trial, the written ICF should be sig ned and dated 
personally by the subject or by the subject’s legally acceptable representative, and by the person 
who conducted the informed consent discussion. A copy of the signed and dated written ICF will 
be provided to the subject.  
 
3 HYPOTHESIS  
Subject s administering RAI with V -Go can be safely switched to U-100 RHI delivery with V -Go 
and maintain similar glycemic control measured by glycated hemoglobin (A1C).    
 
4 PRELIMINARY DATA  
V-Go has been previously demonstrated to be safe for use with RAI, and h as been shown to 
allow subject s to achieve improved blood sug ar control with a continuous preset basal rate of 
insulin and on -demand mealtime bolus dosing  (10-13).  RHI U-100 has been reported to be 
stable in V -Go devices and clinical findings from two small retrospective studies have 
demonstrated efficacy and safety using U-100 RHI in V -Go.     
 
Available data for use of RHI U-100 with V -Go (14-16) 
 
Stability Study  
For insulin  delivery devices it is important to assess the stability of the insulin used within the 
device, to understand if different types of insulin have differing stability profiles, and to 
determine if insulin stability is impacted by pre -filling and storage con ditions. The purpose of the 
study was to evaluate the stability (up to 6 days) of RHI U-100 when used with V -Go.  
 
V-Go devices were filled u sing the EZ Fill™ adapter with RHI  and stored at 77°F for 1, 3, and 5 
days followed by 1 day (24 hours) at 86°F to simulate potential actual -use.  
The data demonstrated 6 days of stability for RHI U-100. All tests performed met specifications 
at all time -points.  
8 
 Clinical Retrospective Analyses  
A retrospective analysis was conducted by querying an electronic medical records database for 
subject s administering RHI U-100 with V -Go at a large endocrine practice in Jacksonville, 
Florida.  
 
Eleven subject s meeting the inclusion criteria were evaluated. At baseline, 7 subject s were on 
basal -bolus insulin injections, 1 subject  was on basal -only insulin, 2 subject s were on pre -mix 
insulin injections, and 1 subject  was naive to insulin therapy prior to RHI del ivery via V -Go.  
Baseline mean A1C was 8.6% (6.0% - 10.7%) and mean insulin total daily dose (TDD) was 82 
U/day.  After 6 months, A1C was significantly reduced by 0.7% (p=0.029) and mean TDD 
decreased to 61 U/day reflecting a 26% insulin dose reduction as shown in Figure 1 .  Body 
weight remained stable.  At baseline, the direct pharmacy cost per subject  per month for insulin 
therapy was $568 which was reduced to $309 for V -Go with RHI.  Costs were calculated using 
wholesale acquisition cost and retail prici ng, Figure 1 .

A second retrospective analysis was conducted by a specialized diabetes system across Texas 
and evaluated change in A1C, insulin dosing, weight and subject  reported severe hypoglycemia

administering insulin (mean TDD 99 U/day) at baseline. V -Go was initiated in 6 subject s using 
RHI and 4 tra nsitioned to RHI following the use of rapid acting insulin (RAI) first in V -Go.  
Hierarchical linear models were developed for statistical evaluations. A1C results over time are 
shown in Figure 2 .  Model adjusted A1C and TDD decreased significantly from ba seline 
(p<0.001), with a least squares mean change of -1.8% in A1C and -46 U/day in TDD following a 
mean of 194  + 159 days on V -Go therapy for all subject s. Weight did not significantly change 
from baseline (p=0.175). Regardless of initiating V -Go therapy with RHI or transitioning to RHI 
from RAI, similar changes in A1C, insulin, and weight were observed over time.

in the study to complete an end of study visit (visit 4) even if the subject does not 
continue treatment on product until then.  
 
5.3.4 Approximate Duration of Study  
This study is anticipated to be  completed within approximately seven  months  after study 
initiation , including subject  enrollment, data collection, and analysis.   
 
5.4 Procedures  
 
The following procedures will be performed at the times shown in the Schedule of Activities .  
 
Demography  
Demography will be recorded at Screening (Visit 1)  and will consists of:  
• Date of birth  
• Sex 
• Ethnicity  
• Race  
 
14 
 Medical History  
Medical history will be recorded at Screening (Visit 1) and Day 0 (Visit 2). Medical history is a 
medical event that the subject has experienced in the past , not including past surgeries or 
procedures . There must be medical records present in the subject’s source documents to verify 
the subject’s med ical history.  
 
Concomitant Medications  
Concomitant medications  will be recorded at Screening (Visit 1), Day 0 (Visit 2), Week 2 (Visit 
3) and Week 12 (Visit 4). A concomitant medication is any treatment received by the subject  
concomitantly to any study treatments (RAI or RHI via V -Go). All concomitant medications 
should be documented in the subject’s source documents . This  includes a ll medications that the 
subject takes at any time during the clinical study,  beginning at Screening (Visit 1) . Additionally, 
all medications taken in the 3 months prior to Screening (Visit 1)  should be reported.  
 
Body Weight, Height, and Body Mass Index (B MI) 
Body weight, height, and BMI will be completed  at Screening (Visit 1). Body weight will also be 
completed at Week 12 (Visit 4). Body weight should be measured  without shoes on, wearing 
only light clothing and is recorded as pounds  (lb) to the nearest one decimal place, preferably 
using  the same scale throughout the study . Height should be measured  without shoes on, in 
inches  (in) and recorded to the  nearest one decimal place.  BMI  will be calculated once the height 
and weight  are obtained using the Nati onal Institute of Health BMI calculator 
(www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/educational/lose_wt/BMI/bmicalc.htm ) 
 
Physical Exam  
A complete physical examination will be completed  at Day 0 (Visit 2) and Week 12 (Visit 4) and 
should include general appearance, head, eyes, ears, nose,  throat, neck, cardiovascular, lungs, 
abdomen, lymph nodes, extremities, neurological, skin, and musculoskeletal.  
 
Pregnancy Test  
Females who are of child -bearing potential being considered for participation in the trial will be 
given a pr egnancy test at Screening (Visit 1). Childbearing potential will be obtained at 
Screening (Visit 1).  
 
Hemoglobin A1c  (A1c)  
A1c will be a ssessed at Screening (Visit 1) and Week 12 (Visit 4) , via the central laboratory for 
the study.   
15 
 Vital Signs ( Blood Pressure  and Pulse)  
Systolic and diastolic blood pressure and pulse will be assessed at Screening (Visit 1), Day 0 
(Visit 2) and Week 12 (Visit 4) on the non-dominant arm . Blood pressure and pulse should be 
measured with the subject in a sitting  position a fter the subject has been resting for at least 5 
minutes . The subject’s legs should be  uncrossed with the soles of the feet flat on the ground.  
Blood pressure must be measured using a  calibrated digital blood pressure monitoring device.  
 
V-Go Insulin Dosin g Adjustment and Data Collection  
Modification  of a subject’s pre -existing insulin dosing regimen may be required during the  study,  
due to changes in diet, activity, and potential effects of changing insulin from RAI to U-100 
RHI. During the trial, subjects will be advised to perform SMBG and document their SMBG 
results in the paper diary provided by the study . Subjects are to be instructed to document their 
daily individual insulin  doses on their study paper diary . This information will be used to  
facilitate appropriate  insulin dose adjustment and  ensure subject safety. Overall g lucose control 
will be reviewed by the investigator at each visit  and the in sulin  dose may be adjusted as deemed 
appropriate to be consistent with good medical practice  and to target gly cemic control goals for 
all subjects si milar to those  recommended by the American Diabetes Association (ADA). 
 
Table 1: Target Glucose Values for Adjustment of Insulin Therapy  
Time of Target Blood Glucose 
Measurement  Self-Monitored Blood Glu cose (SMBG) Target *  
Pre-prandial Plasma Glucose   80 to <1 30 mg/dL  
Peak Postprandial Plasma Glucose  < 180 mg/dL  
*More or less stringent glycemic targets  may be appropriate for individual patients. Goals should be individualized based on 
duration of diabetes, age/life expectancy, comorbid conditions, known CVD or advanced microvascular complications, 
hypoglycemia unawareness, and individual patient conside rations.  
 
Postprandial glucose measurements should be made 1 –2 h after the beginning of the meal, generally peak levels in patients 
with diabetes.  
 
Prandial hypoglycemia should be addressed by lowering the bolus doses and adjustment to the 
V-Go option (ba sal rate) should be made depending on the subject  fasting glucose and in the case 
of hypoglycemia , nocturnal hypoglycemia  or severe hyperglycemia.  If consistent or repeated  
blood glucose levels  are lower than the target range and/or frequent episodes of po st-prandial or 
pre-prandial hypoglycemia  are recorded , then an assessment of the subject  to evaluate physical 
activity and carbohydrate intake prior to considering a reduction in prandial insulin dose, may be 
required.  
 
16 
 Self-Monitoring Blood Glucose  (SMBG)  
Subjects should bring their glucose meter with them to each study visit to  ensure that it is 
functioning properly and for review of SMBG results.  All subjects do not need to utilize the 
same brand of glucose meter; however, all subjects will use their own  glucometer and that meter 
should remain  the same throughout the study.  In the event that a glucose meter is changed or 
replaced by the subject, the investigator will be notified.  Subjects will be provided with a paper 
diary to record all SMBG measurement s.   
Subjects should be instructed to measure a minimum of 2 SMBG readings daily , which will 
consist of fasting (pre -morning meal)  and either  a pre-evening meal or pre-bedtime. Subjects 
should be informed that checking their blood glucose at additional tim es throughout the day is 
recommended. In addition, subjects should obtain additional readings, as needed, in they 
experience hypoglycemic symptoms, and contact the investigator if they experience unusually  
high or low blood glucose value s.  
 
Seven -Point Se lf-Monitoring Blood Glucose  (SMBG)  
Subjects must  be instructed to perform required 7-point SMBG profiles prior to  3 visits during 
the study (Visits 2, Visit 3, and Visit 4 ). Each 7 -point profile should be completed over a 1 -day 
period , within the 3 days prior to each study visit when a 7 -point profile is required (Visits 2, 
Visit 3, and Visit 4 ). The 7-point profile consists of 7 SMBG  measurements on the same day at 
pre-morning meal (fasting), pre-midday meal, pre -evening meal, and 2 -hours after the start of the 
morning,  midday, and evening meals , and at bedtime. Subjects  should be urged  to eat a morning, 
midday, and evening  meal on the days that the 7-point SMBG is monitored. Pre -meal 
measurements should be taken  before the subject  begins eating the meal .  
 
Re-screening  
If a subject does not meet inclusion and/or exclusion criteria at the Screening Visit or 
Randomization Visit, the subject may be re -screened at a later time.  
 
The following conditions are pre -requisites of re -screening:  
• Before re -screening, new written informed consent must be obtained  
• Allocation of a new subject identification number  
• All assessments for the study must be repeated  
• A minimum of 1 month between the initial Screening Visit and re -screening  
 
 
 
17 
 Randomization   
Randomization will occur at the second visit (7 -14 days from visit 1 -screening). The study 
statistician will generate a blocked randomization scheme (1:1 treatment allocation ratio) ,, 
stratified by  study site and  A1c (<9%, ≥9%).    The randomization assig nments will be concealed 
and will  revealed only after the enrolled participant has completed all baseline assessments,  
including the 7-point glucose profile , and it is time to allocate the intervention to the study 
subject.  Opaque envelopes labeled for ea ch HbA1c stratum will sent to each study site to be 
opened in enrollment order within each stratum.  Authorized study personnel will then obtain the 
randomization assignment after providing the Subject ID and corresponding stratification 
information.  Eligib le subject s will be randomized to either stay on RAI delivered by V -Go (RAI 
cohort) or randomized to switch to U-100 RHI delivered by V -Go (RHI cohort)  at Day 0 (Visit 
2).  
 
NIGLM will remain stable with the exception of the removal of a medication due to documented 
clinically significant hypoglycemia during the screening process.   
Subject s switched from RAI to U-100 RHI in their V -Go will be expected to fill the new U -100 
RHI prescription within 48 hours of Day 0 (Visit 2) and obtain the U-100 RHI through  standard 
pharmacy channels.  Subject s will also be educated on potential risks associated with U-100 
RHI.  
 
Subjects randomized to U-100 RHI in V -Go will be instructed to dose (click) 20 minutes before 
meals and snacks. Subjects randomized to continue  RAI will be instructed to dose (click) 5 
minutes before meals  and snacks .

5.5 Study Endpoints   
 
5.5.1 Primary Endpoints  
• To demonstrate that RHI delivered by V -Go is non -inferior to RAI delivered by V -Go as 
measured by A1C after 12 weeks of treatment.     
  
19 
 5.5.2 Secondary Endpoints  
• Evaluate the change in prevalence and incidence of hypoglycemic events based on 7 - 
point glucose profiles between groups  
• Compare change in TDD of insulin (units/day and units/kg) between groups  
• Compare direct pharmacy insulin costs to insurance payor using wholesale acquisition 
costs between g roups   
5.5.3 Exploratory Endpoint  
• Evaluate 7-point  glucose profile s for glucose patterns  
 
5.6 Data Analysis  
 
5.6.1 Statistical Analysis Plan  
 
All statistical analyses will be performed by the study statistician (Beverley Huet), who has 
extensive experience in clinical trials analysis.  
Primary analysis: The primary analysis will be  the per-protocol analysis comparing HbA1c 
response because, in n on-inferiority hypothesis testing, the i ntention -to-treat analysis may 
be biased toward the null hypothesis. The per -protocol population is defined as the 
population who continued the assigned intervention as randomized for the duration of the 
study period , comp leting the end of study week 12 visit (V4) . The non -inferiority of U-100 
RHI treatment strategy compared to  rapid acting insulin regimen will be assessed using a  
95% confidence interval for the between treatment group net difference ( Visit 4 minus 
Visit 1) in HbA1c at end of study. This 95% confidence interval will be derived from the 
differences of least square means estimated from a mixed -effects  model repeated measures 
analysis.  The study subject will be modelled as a random effect.  Non-inferiority of U-100 
RHI treatment  will be concluded if the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval is less 
than the non -inferiority margin of 0.4%.    
Secondary analyses: Intention -to-treat (ITT) which will include all randomized participants 
who receive at least one dose of a study medication  will be performed as a secondary 
analysis . HbA1c will be compared in a mixed -effects model which can accommodate cases 
with missing data in the ITT analysis data set, assuming the data are missing at random.  
After evaluation of the  non-inferiority of U -100 RHI hypothesis, the superiority of the 
HbA1c as a secondary endpoint will be tested  in a fixed sequence;  if the primary hypothesis 
of non -inferiority is significant then superiority will be tested . This ana lysis will be 
20 
 performed in both the per -protocol and ITT data sets. Secondary analyses will assess 
baseline covariates and their association with treatment efficacy.  Group comparisons and 
changes from baseline over time (study visits) of continuous seconda ry outcome variables 
will be analysed with mixed -effects model repeated measures analysis. Hypoglycemic 
events, as defined in section 6.3.1.1 , will summarized as percent of participants with at 
least one event and will be compared between treatment groups with Fisher’s exact test. 
Hypoglycemic events will also be summarized as events per person time and analyzed with 
Poisson or negative binomial regression models.  Safety endpoints and other adverse events 
will be summarized in detail with descriptive stati stics. The analysis of safety data will be 
performed for the ITT population.   
Model assumptions regarding normality and covariance structure will be carefully 
assessed. Nonparametric tests or data transformations will be used if necessary to meet 
assumpti ons. Statistical analysis will be performed with SAS software (SAS Institute, Cary 
NC), particularly Proc Mixed for linear models with both fixed and random effects.  A two -
sided alpha <5% will be considered significant for all analyses  unless otherwise spe cified . 
Interim analysis. After 75% of the participants are randomized,  the Data Safety and 
Monitoring Committee ( DMSC) will evaluate a simple analysis for the purpose of 
reassessment of sample size . The DSMC will be asked to evaluate  our initial power and 
sample size assumptions and estimation based on accumulated HbA1c results. Based on 
this limited analysis , the final study sample size may be modified  and the DSMC  will 
approve the final study sample size.   If any subsequent formal efficacy interim analysis is 
undertaken, the type I error rate will be controlled using a Lan -Demets alpha -spending 
function with O -Brien -Fleming boundaries  for testing the primary non -inferiority HbA1c 
endpoint.  This will include calculation of the confid ence interval (and p -value) for testing 
the non -inferiority hypothesis  in relation to the O -Brien -Fleming group sequential 
boundaries  (stopping guideline) . The per -protocol analysis is the primary  analysis for 
comparing  the HbA1c week 12 change from baseline  between the two study groups.  The 
study statistician will perform the  interim analysis and the results will be forwarded to the 
Data Safety and Monitoring Committee  for evaluation of study progress . If non -inferiority 
is demonstrated  then the DSMC  will advise the study investigators  with regard to study 
continuation without protocol modification,  study continuation with protocol modification, 
or stopping the trial . To ensure trial integrity, efficacy results will not be disclosed to study 
investiga tors.  
21 
 5.6.2 Cost Analysis  
Direct diabetes -related pharmacy costs will be calculated to assess cost impact to the 
pharmacy budget.  All insulin costs will be normalized by calculating a 30 -day insulin 
requirement based on the total prescribed TDD and multiplying  the monthly insulin dose in 
units by the unit cost of the prescribed insulin. Costs of insulin will be based on current 
published wholesale acquisition costs (WAC) and reported in U.S. dollars.  
 
5.6.3 Statistical Power and Sample Size Considerations  
To demonstrate that delivery of RHI with V -Go is non -inferior to the delivery or RAI with 
V-Go with regard to the change in A1C from baseline to end of study with a NIM of 0.4%, 
81 completers per treatment cohort (162 in total) are needed. This calculation  assumes a SD 
of 0.9% for A1C at 12 weeks of treatment, a 2 -sided significance level of 0.05, and 80% 
power. PASS 15 Power Analysis and Sample Size Software (2017). NCSS, LLC. 
Kaysville, Utah, USA, ncss.com/software/pass.  We will need to randomize 180 subjects to 
test this hypothesis assuming a 10% drop -out rate (estimated drop -out rate based on our 
extensive prior experience with similar population and length of study). We plan to screen 
approximately 225 subject s to account for approximately 20% anticipa ted screen and run -in 
failures.  
 
5.7 Data Management  
 
5.7.1 Data Collection and Storage   
Data required by the protocol will be collected using a data collection form  created by the 
investigative sites.  The investigator has ultimate responsibility for the collection and 
reporting of all clinical data entered on the data collection form.   Excel worksheets will be 
used create the data repository for the analysis data set which will be de -identified and will  
employ range checking derived from the study data dictionary.  Final data merges for 
analysis will be performed with SAS software.  Electronic data will be stored on encrypted 
drives and backed up regularly to a secure server. At the end of study completi on, all 
electronic data will be stored on a password protected CD -ROM and archived with study 
documents.  
 
Subject completed blood glucose and insulin diaries will also be included in the subject 
source documents.  All subject diaries and glucometer downlo ads will be considered to be 
source documentation.  The data will be transcribed to data collection forms by study 
personnel, when applicable.  
22 
  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the 
requirements of the Heal th Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
(HIPAA).  All physical records will be kept in a locked file cabinet.  
 
5.7.2 Records Retention   
The investigator must agree to archive the study documentation (both electronic and paper  
based  records) in a n archive after completion or discontinuation of the trial. The 
investigator should not destroy any documents without prior permission  from Valeritas . If 
the investigator cannot archive the documents at the trial site, they should notify Valeritas. 
At the conclusion of this study, data from this study will be archived  for 15 years for 
possible use in future research studies.   
 
6 SAFETY MONITORING  
 
6.1 Adverse Event Reporting  
Clinical adverse events (AEs) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) will be monitored through out 
the study.  All AEs and SAEs will be reported to the  Principal  Investigator  and to Valeritas, Inc  
regardless of whether they are considered study related.  The date and time of onset and 
outcome, seriousness, intensity, action taken, and causality to study treatment will be assessed by 
the study PI.    
 
6.2 Definitions  
 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward, undesired, or unplanned event in the form of signs, 
symptoms, disease, or laboratory or physiologic observations occurring in a person given a test 
article or in a clinical study. This includes a clinically significant worsening of a  concomitant 
illness  and clinical laboratory abnormalities which are clinically significant, i.e. an abnormality 
that suggests a disease and is  of a severity that requires active management.   The event does not 
need to be causally related to the device  or clinical study.  
 
The following definitions are used when assessing  the intensity of an AE:  
• Mild: no or transient symptoms, no interference with the subject’s daily activities.  
• Moderate : marked symptoms, moderate interference with  the subject’s daily activi ties. 
• Severe : considerable interference with the subject’s daily activities; unacceptable.  
 
23 
 The following definitions are used when assessing  the causality (relationship) of an AE:  
• Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility.  The Investigator must further qualify the degree of certainty as “possible” or 
“probable.”  
o Possible: A causal relationship is conceivable and cannot be dismissed.  
o Probable: Good reason and sufficient documentation to assume a causal 
relationship.  
• Not Related: A causal relationship between the study treatment and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility.  
 
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are:  
• Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment;  
• The course of the event, considering especially the effect of the discontinuation of study 
treatment or the reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable;  
• Whether the event is known to be associated  with the study treatment or with other similar 
treatments;  
• The presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event; and,  
• The presence of non -study treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with 
the o ccurrence of the event.  
 
The following definitions are used when assessing the outcome  of an AE:  
• Recovered/resolved: The subject has fully recovered, or by medical or surgical treatment 
the condition has returned to the level observed at the first trial -related activity after the 
subject signed the ICF.  
• Recovering/resolving: The condition is improving and the subject is expected to recover 
from the event. This term is only applicable if the subject has completed the trial or has 
died from another AE.  
• Recove red/resolved with sequelae: The subject has recovered from the condition, but with 
lasting effect due to a disease, injury, treatment or procedure. If a sequela meets an SAE 
criterion, the AE must be reported as an SAE.  
• Not recovered/not resolved: The con dition of the subject has not improved and the 
symptoms are unchanged, or the outcome is not known.  
• Unknown: This term is only applicable if the subject is lost to follow -up. 
 
24 
 A serious advers e event  (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dos e: 
• Results in death ; 
• Is life -threatening (i .e., the subject  was at immediate risk  of death from the AE  as it occurred; 
this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to 
continue, might have caused death) ; 
• Requires  inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ; 
• Results in persistent or signi ficant disability/incapacity;  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect;  
• Is a medically important event.  
 
6.3 Recording and Reporting  
A subject ’s AEs and SAEs will  be recorded and reported from the signing of the informed 
consent form to the subject ’s last study visit. All SAEs must be reported to Valeritas by 
investigative sites.  The investigative sites are to report all SAEs by calling Valeritas Customer 
Care and  providing all requested information within 24 hours of becoming aware of the SAEs . 
 
Valeritas contact information for SAE reporting is:  
V-Go Customer Care (VCC)  
Phone:  1-866-881-1209  (toll-free)  
 
 Hypoglycemic Events  
  
Reported hypoglycemia will be analyzed according to the following definitions according 
to the International Hypoglycemia Study Group .[13]  
 
Level 1  A glucose alert value of 70mg/dL or less  
Level 2  A glucose level of less than 54mg/dL is sufficiently low to indicate 
serious, clinically important hypoglycemia  
Level 3  Severe hypoglycemia, as defined by the ADA, denotes severe 
cognitive impairment requiring external assistance for recovery . 
 
Hypoglyc emia, as defined above, will be reported by both incidence and prevalence : 
Incidence will be reported as the percentage of subject s in a treatment group reporting at 
least one event for the duration of the study.   
 
25 
 6.4 V-Go Product Complaint Reporting  
The V-Go product  complaint information includes, but not limited to the following:  
• Any type of unusual local or bodily reaction to a device  
• Alleged non -sterility  
• Alleged product failure -design defect or abnormal functional behavior  
• Improper use of the product  whether or not physical injury or product failure results  
• User error in handling the product regardless of final outcome to the subject  
• Packaging or product labeling misunderstandings  
6.4.1 Reporting Period of Product Complaints  
All Product Complaints must be reported to Valeritas by investigative sites.  The 
investigative sites are to report all Product Complaints by calling Valeritas Customer 
Care and providing all requested information within 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
Product Complaint.    
 
Valeritas  contact information for V -Go Product Complaint reporting is:  
V-Go Customer Care (VCC)  
Phone:  1-866-881-1209  (toll-free)  
 
7 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCE DURES  
7.1.1 Changes to the Protocol  
There are to be no changes to the protocol without written approval from the Investigators and 
sponsors.  Protocols will be followed as written.  
 
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change that 
must be approved before implementation by the sponsor  and IRB .  Amendments specifically 
affecting the safety of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientific quality of the 
study require additional approval by the applicable IRBs of all investigational sites.  These 
requirements should in no way prevent any immediate action from bei ng taken by the 
Investigator or by the Sponsor in the interest of preserving the safety of all subjects included in 
the study.  If an immediate change to the protocol is felt by the Investigator to be necessary for 
safety reasons, the sponsor and IRB  must be notified promptly .   
 
Changes affecting only the administrative aspects of the study do not require formal protocol 
26 
 amendments or IRB approval, but the IRB must be kept informed of such changes.  In these 
cases, the Pri ncipal  Investigator will send a le tter to the IRB detailing such changes.  
 
7.1.2 Adherence to the Protocol  
The Investigators will conduct the study in strict accordance with the protocol, which has been 
written to enable the Investigator’s compliance with Good Clinical Practices.  
 
7.1.3 Monitoring Pro cedures  
 Responsibilities of the Principal Investigator  
The principal i nvestigator is required to ensure compliance with all procedures required by the 
clinical trial  protocol and agrees to provide reliable data requested by the clinical trial  protocol in 
an accurate and legible manner.  The principal i nvestigator may delegate  other individuals as they 
may deem appropriate as  sub-investigators to assist in the conduct of the clinical trial. The s ub-
investigators will work u nder the responsibility of the principal i nvestigator. The  principal 
investigator will provide them with a copy of the clinical trial protocol and all necessary  
information.  
 Responsibilities of the Monitor  
The monitor  of this clinical trial is responsible for  taking all reasonable steps  to ensure the proper 
conduct of the clinical trial regarding ethics,  clinical trial protocol compliance, and integrity and 
validity of the data recorded.  Thus, the main duty of the monitor  is to help the principal 
investigator maintain a  high level of eth ical, scientific, technical and regulatory quality in all 
aspects of the clinical trial.   
Throughout  the clinical trial, the monitor will contact the site, through monitoring visits or phone 
calls, to review study progress,  investigator and patient complia nce with the protocol, and any 
issues. The monitoring visits will include , but not be limited to , review of the following  aspects: 
patient ICFs , patient recruitment and follow -up, SAE documentation and  reporting, AE 
documentation, patient compliance with t he study protocol, and quality of data.  The monitor  
must check the data collected  against the source  documents .  
  
8 PUBLICATION PLAN

2.1 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
Primary  Objective  
 
1) To evaluate  whether  receiving  romiplostim  after HDT-AHCT  decreases  the number  of 
days requiring  platelet  transfusions  or grade  4 CTCAE  thrombocytopenia  following  HDT- 
AHCT  
 
Secondary  Objectives  INTERVENTION 
• Romiplostim  3.0 mcg/kg  SC on Day +1 and Romiplostim  2.0 mcg/kg  
SC on Day +8 after HDT-AHCT.  Beyond  Day +8, patients  will be 
treated  weekly  until platelet  count  is >50,000/mcL,  without  any platelet  
transfusions  in the prior 48 hours.  All doses  after the second  
Romiplostim  dose  will be titrated  as per Table  3, based  on weekly  
CBC/platelet  counts.  Patients  will receive  a maximum  of six weekly  
doses  of romiplostim.  
➢ Romiplostim  doses  after Day +8 may have a +2 day window  
• Lab assessments:  
➢ CBC,  CMP,  and Immature  Platelet  Fraction  every  day from day 
of AHCT  (Day  0) until Day +15. All patients  will get at least 
weekly  (+/- 3 days)  labs until day +30. Patients  who need  3 or 
more  doses  of romiplostim  will get weekly  (+/- 3 days)  labs as 
long as their platelet  count  is ≥25,000.  For patients  who need  3 
or more  doses  of romiplostim  they will receive  labs every  
second  day until their platelets  are ≥25,000.  
➢ LDH,  PT/INR,  APTT  every  7 days (+/-2 days)  from Day +1 until 
Day +15. 
➢ CBC,  CMP,  Immature  Platelet  Fraction,  LDH,  PT/INR,  and 
APTT  will be done  at days +30 (+/- 7 days),  +60 (+/- 7 days)  
and at +100  (+/- 14 days)  from AHCT.  TARGET PATIENTS

1) To evaluate  whether  romiplostim  can reduce  the number  of platelet  transfusions  issued  
during  the AHCT  admission  
 
2) To evaluate  whether  romiplostim  can reduce  the time to platelet  engraftment  after HDT- 
AHCT  Platelet  engraftment  is defined  as the first day of seven  consecutive  days with a 
platelet  count  of ≥20 K/mcL  without  transfusion  support.  
 
3) To evaluate  whether  romiplostim  can reduce  the length  of stay of AHCT  
 
4) The safety  profile  of romiplostim  will be assessed  in this patient  population  during  the 
course  of the study  as per Section  11.0 Toxicities/Side  Effects.  
 
3.0 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
HDT-AHCT and Chemotherapy -Induced  Thrombocytopenia  (CIT)  
 
High-dose  therapy  and autologous  hematopoietic  cell transplantation  (HDT -AHCT)  remains  a 
standard  of care consolidation  strategy  for patients  with multiple  myeloma  (MM)   that provides  
prolonged  disease -free survival.1,2  The standard  conditioning  regimen  for MM is  
monotherapy  with high-dose  melphalan.2  HDT-AHCT  is also a potentially  curative  modality   
for patients  with relapsed,  chemosensitive  Hodgkin  lymphoma  (HL) and non-Hodgkin  
lymphoma  (NHL).3,4  For HL and the majority  of NHL subtypes,  the most  commonly  used  
conditioning  regimen  is BEAM  [carmustine,  etoposide,  cytarabine,  and melphalan]  followed  
by CBV [cyclophosphamide,  carmustine,  and etoposide].4–6   In recent  years,  for patients  with 
central  nervous  system  lymphoma  (CNSL),  our group  and others  have successfully  utilized  
an intensive  conditioning  regimen,  TBC [thiotepa,  busulfan,  and cyclophosphamide.]7–9 
The HDT-AHCT  platform  is built upon  myeloablative  conditioning,  which  consists  of single  
agent  or combination  chemotherapies  aimed  at overcoming  potential  residual  disease  and 
any possible  chemoresistance.4 In doing  so, the normal  hematopoietic  cell compartment  of 
the bone  marrow  is also eliminated,  after which  an infusion  of autologous  stem  cells is 
required  to restore  normal  hematopoiesis  roughly  2 weeks  after AHCT.  There  are profound  
cytopenias  following  AHCT  prior to engraftment,  notably  thrombocytopenia.  Currently,  the 
management  of chemotherapy -induced  thrombocytopenia  (CIT)  is supportive  with platelet  
transfusions  per the discretion  of the treating  medical  oncologist.10  Most patients  undergoing  
HDT-AHCT  require  multiple  platelet  transfusions  during  their AHCT  hospitalization.  Platelet  
transfusions  are generally  given  to non-bleeding  patients  with severe   thrombocytopenia.  For 
inpatient  stem  cell transplantations,  the standard  platelet  transfusion  threshold  is to transfuse  
if platelets  are < 10,000/mcL.  For outpatient  stem  cell transplantations,  the standard  platelet  
transfusion  threshold  is to transfuse  if platelets  are < 20,000/mcL.  Patients  may also be 
transfused  for any platelet  count  if necessary  for clinical  reasons,  if deemed  appropriate  by 
the treating  physician.  Even  after neutrophil  engraftment,  thrombocytopenia  often  delays  
hospital  discharge  and increases  the risk of bleeding  complications.11,12  Table  1 presents  the 
MSKCC  historic  thrombocytopenia  data in patients  undergoing  HDT-AHCT  from 2014  
through  2016.  The key parameters  presented  are platelet  transfusions  issued  (mean,  
median,  range),  day to platelet  engraftment,  day to neutrophil  engraftment,  and length  of 
stay. Neutrophil  engraftment  after transplantation  is defined  as an absolute  neutrophil  count

(ANC)  ≥ 500 K/mcL  for 3 consecutive  days.  The first of these  3 consecutive  days is 
considered  the day of neutrophil  engraftment.  Platelet  engraftment  is defined  as the time 
after transplantation  needed  to achieve  a platelet  count  exceeding  20,000/mcL  without  
transfusion  support  for 7 consecutive  days.  The first of those  7 consecutive  days is 
considered  the day of platelet  engraftment.

Romiplostim – Mechanism of Action and Clinical Activity 
 
Romiplostim  (Nplate®)  is a thrombopoietin  (TPO)  mimetic  that binds  to the TPO receptor  
(Mpl).13  It is a ‘peptibody’  formed  by the fusion  of the Fc portion  of an IgG1 monoclonal  
antibody  with four TPO mimetic  peptides.  It binds  the distal  cytokine  homology  region  of the 
TPO receptor  leading  to the activation  of the JAK/STAT  pathyway.14  In addition,  it has been  
shown  to activate  the MAP kinase  pathway  leading  to activation  of anti-apoptotic  pathways  
resulting  in increased  platelet  production.  Romiplostim  is FDA approved  for use in chronic  
immune  thrombocytopenia  (ITP),  and it has been  shown  to increase  and maintain  platelet  
counts  in splenectomized  and non-splenectomized  patients  with few adverse  effects.15,16  To 
date,  no anti-TPO antibody  formation  of clinical  significance  has been  reported.  In several  
trials of patients  with ITP, the mean  therapeutic  dose  of romiplostim  to achieve  a platelet  
count  of 50-200,000/mcL  was 3-4 mcg/kg.10,14 
At MSKCC,  our Hematology  Service  has extensive  experience  using  romiplostim  for 
chemotherapy -induced  thrombocytopenia  (CIT),  in patients  with advanced  stage  solid tumor  
malignancies.18  The goal of romiplostim  therapy  was improvement  and maintenance  of 
platelet  counts  to >100,000/mcL  in order  to allow  for the resumption  and continuation  of 
cancer -directed  therapy.  The results  of an investigator -initiated,  phase  II,  open -label clinical

trial of romiplostim  for CIT in patients  with advanced  stage  solid tumors  versus  observation  
control  were  recently  reported.19   The observation -control  patients  who did not correct  their 
platelet  counts  were  eligible  to crossover  to the romiplostim  arm. A total of 40 patients  were  
enrolled,  with 32 patients  receiving  up-front romiplostim  and 8 observation  patients.   27 of the 
32 (84%)  of the romiplostim -treated  patients  corrected  their platelets  to target  goal within  3 
weeks.  After correction  of their platelet  count,  25 of these  patients  resumed  chemotherapy,  
and all but one were  able to maintain  their scheduled  chemotherapy  treatments  without  
recurrence  of CIT.  The mean  effective  romiplostim  dose  was 2.5 mcg/kg  (range  1.8-4.1). 
Importantly,  there  were  no observed  adverse  effects  on the bone  marrow.   Four patients  
(12.5%)  of the 32 treated  patients  had a non-fatal thrombotic  event.  It is important  to note 
that all of these  patients  were  at high risk of thrombosis  based  on their underlying  
malignancy,  and this incidence  of thrombosis  is considered  within  a typical  range  in patients  
with advanced  solid tumors  on chemotheray.19 
An unmet  need  exists  for an alternative  to platelet  transfusions  for patients  undergoing  HDT- 
AHCT.  Blood  product  transfusions  are costly  and there  are risks of short -term and long-term 
transfusion  complications.   Further,  responses  to platelet  transfusions  are short -lived,  
typically  12 hours  or less.  Enhancing  platelet  engraftment  with romiplostim,  post HDT-AHCT  
would  be a highly  attractive.  
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
We are proposing  a single -center,  open -label,  pilot study  of romiplostim  for patients  
undergoing  HDT-AHCT.  We will enroll  a total of 63 patients  within  18 months  of opening  of 
the study  to reach  a sample  size of 60 patients.  Patients  will have (A) MM undergoing  high- 
dose  melphalan  and AHCT,  (B) HL or NHL undergoing  BEAM - or CBV-AHCT  or (C) CNSL  
undergoing   TBC-AHCT.  
 
Further:  
 
• At least 20 will have MM undergoing  high-dose  melphalan  and AHCT  
• At least 20 will have HL or NHL undergoing  BEAM - or CBV-AHCT.  
• Remaining  patients  with MM or HL/NHL  as available  to reach  final sample  size of 60 
patients  
Patients  will be enrolled  prior to admission  for HDT-AHCT,  and they will undergo  their 
planned  HDT-AHCT  for their respective  hematologic  malignancy  as per institutional  
standards  as follows:  
We hypothesize  that the use of romiplostim  after HDT-AHCT  will: (A) Reduce  the number  of 
days requiring  platelet  transfusions  or grade  4 CTCAE  thrombocytopenia  following  HDT- 
AHCT;  (B) Reduce  the number  of platelet  transfusions  issued  during  the AHCT  admission;

(C) Reduce  the time to platelet  engraftment  after AHCT;  (D) Reduce  the length  of stay for the 
AHCT  as compared  to historical  data.  
4.3 Intervention  
 
Patients  will be enrolled  prior to admission  for HDT-AHCT,  and they will undergo  their 
planned  HDT-AHCT  for their respective  hematologic  malignancy  as per institutional  
standards  as detailed  in Section  9.0 Treatment/Intervention  Plan.  
Regardless  of the conditioning  regimen  received,  all patients  will receive  romiplostim  3.0 
mcg/kg  SC on Day +1 and romiplostim  2.0 mcg/kg  SC on Day +8 after HDT-AHCT.  Beyond  
Day +8, patients  will be treated  until platelet  count  is >50,000/mcL,  without  any platelet  
transfusions  in the prior 48 hours.  All doses  after the second  romiplostim  dose  will be titrated  
as per Table  3, based  on weekly  CBC/platelet  counts.  No patient  will receive  more  than six 
doses  of romiplostim,  even if platelets  have not corrected  by Day +42. 
If there  is a medical  circumstance  wherein  the platelets  decrease  to <20,000/mcL,  
romiplostim  can be resumed  during  hospitalization  at the discretion  of the treating  physician  
for medical  necessity.  Throughout  the study,  all patients  will receive  weekly  doses  of 
romiplostim.

5.1 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC  AGENTS  & NON -THERAPEUTIC  ASSESSMENTS  
 
Romiplostim,  a TPO mimetic,  is an Fc-peptide  fusion  protein  (peptibody)  that activates  
intracellular  transcriptional  pathways  leading  to increased  platelet  production  via the TPO 
receptor  (known  as cMpl).  The peptibody  molecule  contains  two identical  single -chain  
subunits,  each  consisting  of human  immunoglobulin  IgG1 Fc domain,  covalently  linked  at the 
C-terminus  to a peptide  containing  two thrombopoietin  receptor -binding  domains.  
Romiplostim  has no amino  acid sequence  homology  to endogenous  TPO.  Romiplostim  is 
produced  by recombinant  DNA technology  in Escherichia  coli (E coli).14,15 
Romiplostim  is approximately  59 kilodalton  and is comprised  of 4 Mpl-binding  domains  and 
an Fc fragment.  The peptibody  is produced  by recombinant  DNA technology  in Escherichia  
coli (E coli). Though  it has no amino  acid sequence  homology  to endogenous  thrombopoietin  
(eTPO),  romiplostim  is an agonist  of the thrombopoietin  (TPO)  receptor  and signals  and 
activates  intracellular  transcriptional  pathways  to increase  platelet  production.  
Romiplostim  is supplied  as a sterile,  preservative -free lyophilized  white  powder  ready  for 
reconstitution.  It is supplied  for single  use in 5 cc Type  I glass vials containing  625 μg of

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
This study  will be conducted  at MSKCC.  Potential  research  subjects  will be identified  by 
members  of the Adult  Bone  Marrow  Transplant  (BMT)  and Hematology  Services.  After 
consultation  with the Adult  BMT attending  physician,  eligible  patients  will be asked  to 
participate  in the study.  If consent  is offered,  the risks and benefits  will be presented  to the 
patient  by an investigator  prior to the patient  consenting.  If the patient  consents,  they will be 
enrolled/registered  by a clinical  research  coordinator.  
 
This study  does not compete  with any existing  or planned  other  studies  for conditioning - 
regimen  induced  thrombocytopenia,  and therefore,  we anticipate  a high percent  of the 
appropriate  patients  who are undergoing  HDT-AHCT  will be referred  and enrolled.

10.1 TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  PLAN  
 
Patients  will be enrolled  prior to admission  for HDT-AHCT,  and they will undergo  their 
planned  AHCT  for their respective  hematologic  malignancy  as per institutional  standards.  
A. Regardless  of the conditioning  regimen  received,  all patients  will receive  romiplostim  3.0 
mcg/kg  SC on Day +1 and romiplostim  2.0 mcg/kg  SC on Day +8 after HDT-AHCT.  
Beyond  Day +8, patients  will be treated  until platelet  count  is >50,000/mcL,  without  any 
platelet  transfusions  in the prior 48 hours.  All doses  after the second  romiplostim  dose  
will be titrated  as per Table  3, based  on weekly  CBC/platelet  counts.  Patients  will receive  
a maximum  of six weekly  doses  of romiplostim.  
B. Laboratory  Assessments  
a. CBC,  CMP,  and Immature  Platelet  Fraction  every  day from day of AHCT  (Day  0) 
until Day +15.  All patients  will get at least weekly  (+/- 3 days)  labs until Day +30. 
Patients  who need  3 or more  doses  of romiplostim  will get weekly  (+/- 3 days)  
labs as long as their platelet  count  is ≥25,000.  For patients  who need  3 or more  
doses  of romiplostim  and whose  platelet  counts  are <25,000  they will receive  labs 
every  second  day until their platelets  are ≥25,000 . 
b. LDH,  PT/INR,  APTT  every  7 days (+/-2 days)  from Day +1 until Day +15. 
c.   CBC  with differential,  CMP,  Immature  Platelet  Fraction,  LDH,  PT/INR,  and APTT  
will be done  at days +30 (+/- 7 days),  +60 (+/- 7 days)  and at +100  (+/-14 days)  
from AHCT.  
C. If there  is a medical  circumstance  wherein  the platelets  decrease  to <20,000/mcL,  
romiplostim  can be resumed  during  hospitalization  at the discretion  of the treating  
physician  for medical  necessity.  However,  a patient  will not exceed  six total doses  of 
romiplostim.  
D. If there  is a medical  circumstance  (e.g. prolonged  infection,  sepsis,  pneumonia)  wherein  
a subject  remains  admitted  for more  than 30 days post-AHCT,  which  inhibits  platelet  
recovery  and platelet  engraftment,  daily labs will be discontinued  and will instead  be 
collected  at least once  weekly  until discharge  from hospital.  
E. Toxicity  assessments  will be done  weekly  until 7 days after the last dose  of Romiplostim  
(Days  +1, +8, +15, +22, +29, … +/- 2 days),  and Days  +30 (+/-7 days),  +60 (+/-7 days),  
and +100  (+/- 14 days)  from AHCT.

11.1 EVALUATION  DURING  TREATMENT/INTERVENTION  
 
The following  assessments  will be made  during  the study  to assess  efficacy  and safety.  See 
Table  4 Schedule  of Assessments.  
Laboratory  Assessments  
a. CBC  with differential,  CMP,  and Immature  Platelet  Fraction  every  day from day of 
AHCT  (Day 0) until day +15 All patients  will get at least weekly  (+/- 3 days)  labs 
until day +30. Patients  who need  3 or more  doses  of romiplostim  will get weekly  
(+/- 3 days)  labs as long as their platelet  count  is ≥25,000.  For patients  who need  
3 or more  doses  of romiplostim  and whose  platelet  counts  are <25,000  they will 
receive  labs every  second  day until their platelets  are ≥25,000.  
b. LDH,  PT/INR,  APTT  every  7 days (+/-2 days)  from Day +1 until Day +15. 
c. CBC  with differential,  CMP,  Immature  Platelet  Fraction,  LDH,  PT/INR,  and APTT  
will be done  at days +30 (+/- 7 days),  +60 (+/- 7 days)  and at +100  (+/- 14 days)  
from AHCT.  
d. For women  of childbearing  potential,  a pregnancy  test (negative  serum  or urine  
hCG)  must  be done  at the end of treatment  visit, 7 days after the last dose  of 
romiplostim.  
Safety  endpoints  will include  change  in typical  neutrophil  engraftment  kinetics,  venous  or 
arterial  thrombosis,  evidence  of marrow  toxicity,  and evidence  of organ  dysfunction.  
 
12.1 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
 
Treatment  will continue  until the occurrence  of any of the following  events:  
• Continuation  is no longer  in the patient’s  best interest  as determined  by the patient’s  
treating  oncologist.  
• Patient  withdraws  consent  
• Death  
• Lost to follow -up 
• Major  violation  of study  protocol,  such  as non-compliance.  
• Adverse  event(s)  that, in the judgment  of the Investigator  or treating  oncologist,  may 
cause  severe  or permanent  harm  or which  rule out continuation  of the trial. 
 
Discontinuation  of Romiplostim:  
 
If a patient  develops  a Grade  3/4 adverse  event,  attributable  to romiplostim,  based  on the 
Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE  version  5), the Romiplostim  
will be discontinued.  
If a patient  develops  an asymptomatic  deep  vein thrombosis  and/or  pulmonary  embolism,  
or a symptomatic  deep  vein thrombosis  and/or  pulmonary  embolism,  not associated  with 
hemodynamic  instability,  and not considered  life-threatening,  the romiplostim  may be 
continued  if there  is consensus  of judgment  of the treating  oncologist  and study  
investigator.

13.0 CRITERIA  FOR OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  AND ENDPOINT  EVALUABILITY  
 
13.1 Criteria for Therapeutic Response/Outcome Assessment 
Primary  Endpoint  
 
1) The number  of days requiring  platelet  transfusions  or grade  4 CTCAE  thrombocytopenia  
following  HDT-AHCT  
Secondary  Endpoints  
 
1) The number  of platelet  transfusions  issued  during  the AHCT  admission  
 
2) The time to platelet  engraftment  after HDT-AHCT  Platelet  engraftment  is defined  as the 
first day of seven  consecutive  days with a platelet  count  of ≥20 K/mcL  without  transfusion  
support.  
 
3) The length  of stay of AHCT  
 
4) The safety  profile  of romiplostim  as per Section  11.0 Toxicities/Side  Effects.  
 
Platelet  transfusions  will be at the discretion  of the treating  BMT attending  at will not be 
specified  in the protocol.  However,  a member  of the investigator  team  will review  the medical  
record  to determine  the reason  for the transfusion,  specified  as (a) thrombocytopenia  alone,  
(b) bleeding  attributed,  at least in part to thrombocytopenia,  and/or  (c) need  for interventional  
procedure  while  thrombocytopenia  is present.  
13.2 Criteria  for Study  Endpoint  Evaluability  
All patients  who enroll,  and receive  at least two dose  of romiplostim,  will be evaluable  for 
primary  and secondary  endpoints.  If a patient  has enrolled,  but does not receive  two doses  of 
romiplostim  due to death,  or change  in medical  status,  they will not be evaluable  and they will 
be replaced  on the study.  
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
This pilot study  will investigate  whether  romiplostim  reduces  the number  of days requiring  
platelet  transfusions  or grade  4 CTCAE  thrombocytopenia  following  HDT-AHCT.  The study  
includes  patients  with (1) MM undergoing  high-dose  melphalan  and AHCT,  (2) HL or NHL 
undergoing  BEAM - or CBV-AHCT  or (3) CNSL  undergoing  TBC-AHCT.   Further,  at least 20 
will have MM undergoing  high-dose  melphalan  and AHCT,  and at least 20 will have HL or 
NHL undergoing  BEAM -, CBV-, or TBC-AHCT.  The primary  endpoint  along  with the 
secondary  endpoints  will be evaluated  in cohorts  (1) MM and (2) HL or NHL separately.  Due 
to anticipated  low numbers,  patients  with CNSL  receiving  TBC-conditioning  will be 
considered  exploaratory  only. 
The primary  endpoint  is the number  of days post HDT-AHCT  requiring  transfusions  or grade  
4 CTCAE  thrombocytopenia.  The study  does not include  a formal  hypothesis  test for the 
primary  endpoint  or corresponding  decision  rule. Instead  the median  and interquartile  range

IRB Number: 20 -180 A(9)  
Approval date: 15 -Sep-2021   
  
(IQR)  of the number  of days will be used  to describe  the number  of days post HDT-AHCT  
requiring  transfusions  or grade  4 CTCAE  thrombocytopenia  for each  cohort  separately.  The 
mean  number  of days along  with a 95% confidence  interval  will additionally  be reported.  
These  summary  statistics  will be compared  to the summary  statistics  of the historical  data 
from patients  transplanted  from 2014 -2016,  presented  in Table  1. For Cohort  1 (MM),  the 
associated  standard  deviation  for the mean  of days post HDT-AHCT  requiring  transfusions  or 
grade  4 CTCAE  thrombocytopenia  is 3.5. With 20 or more  patients,  the half width  of the 95% 
confidence  interval  for the mean  number  of days for patients  treated  with  romiplostim  is  +/- 
1.6 or less if a similar  standard  deviation  is observed.  For Cohort  2 (HL/NHL),  the standard  
deviation  is 4.7, corresponding  to a half width  of +/- 2.1 or less. While  not formally  comparing  
these  data to the historical  MSKCC  data,  observed  improvements  in the mean  number  of 
days requiring  transfusions  or grade  4 CTCAE  thrombocytopenia  will help design  a larger  
phase  II study  to formally  evaluate  romiplostim  in the HDT-AHCT  setting.  If the mean  number  
of days requiring  platelet  transfusions  decreases  by at least 1.5 days for Cohort  1, and/or  at 
least 2 days for Cohorts  2, this study  will be considered  sufficiently  promising.  We will then 
proceed  with a phase  II trial for the cohort  or cohorts  that reached  the above  criteria  (i.e. the 
specified  decrease  in days requiring  platelet  transfusion).  
Evaluability  criteria  for both the primary  and secondary  endpoints  are provided  in Section  13.2.  
In addition  to the primary  endpoint,  the pilot study  includes  a number  of secondary  objectives.  
1. To estimate  the median  and mean  number  of platelet  transfusions  issued  during  
AHCT  admission.  In addition  to the mean,  the 95% confidence  interval  will be 
reported.This  will be reported  separately  for each  cohort.  
2. To estimate  the median  and mean  time to platelet  engraftment  after AHCT.   In 
addition  to the mean,  the 95% confidence  interval  will be reported.This  will be 
reported  separately  for each  cohort.  
3. To estimate  the  median  and mean  AHCT  length  of stay.  In addition  to the mean,  the 
95% confidence  interval  will be reported.This  will be reported  separately  for each  
cohort.  
4. To describe  the safety  and toxicity  profile  of romiplostim  in this patient  population.  
Toxcitiy  will be described  by grade  and will be reported  separately  for each  cohort.  
15.1 TOXICITIES/RISKS/SIDE  EFFECTS  
 
Based  on our initial  experience,  we have not observed  treatment -related  toxicities  in our 
patients  treated  with romiplostim  for CIT.  Based  on the romiplostim  Prescribing  Information,  
the most  common  adverse  reactions  (≥ 5% higher  patient  incidence  in romiplostim  versus  
placebo)  are arthralgia,  dizziness,  insomnia,  myalgia,  pain in extremity,  abdominal  pain, 
shoulder  pain, dyspepsia,  and paresthesia.  
Individual  cases  of thrombosis  and been  reported  in patients  receiving  romiplostim,  but in 
one recent  review  of long-term use of romiplostim,  “The thrombotic  adverse  event  rate

across  all studies  was 0.09 events  per 100 patient -weeks  on romiplostim  therapy,”  markedly  
lower  than would  expected  in patients  with active  cancer  receiving  chemotherapy.  We have 
not observed  an increased  thrombosis  rate compared  with expected  rates  in patients  with 
metastatic  cancer,  on chemotherapy,  however,  we will monitor  any clinical  evidence  of 
thrombosis  as well as hemorrhage.  
Assessment  of potential  toxicity  will be based  on the Common  Terminology  Criteria  for 
Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  Version  5.  We will monitor  for evidence  of marrow  toxicity,  with 
weekly  CBC  (CBC  must  include:  WBC,  Hgb, platelet,  MCV,  cell differential)  and lab toxicities  
of grade  3/4 will be adjudicated  on a regular  basis by the PI or Co-PI of the study.  
Toxicity  assessments  will be done  weekly  (+/- 3 days while  COVID  restrictions  remain  in 
place)  until 7 days after the last dose  of Romiplostim,  and Days  +30 (+/-7 days),  +60 (+/-7 
days),  and +100  (+/- 14 days)  from AHCT.  If a patient  is discontinuing  
chemotherapy/treatment  and going  to hospice/  comfort  care,  the final toxicity  assessments  
will be omitted  if toxicities  were  managed  regularly.  
The study  will report  all toxicities  from the time a patient  signs  consent  until 30 days after the 
last dose  of treatment,  unless  they are at least possible  related  to the protocol,  in which  case  
they will be reported  beyond  the 30-day period.  All toxicities  meeting  these  criteria  should  be 
reported  to MSKCC  as a toxicity  in CRDBi -Multicenter  with supporting  source  
documentation.  
Longterm  safety  follow  up for secondary  malignancy  is not planned  within  this protocol  
because  the patients  enrolled  will be followed  as part of their standard  of care on the Adult  
Bone  Marrow  Transplant  Service  at MSKCC.  
15.1 Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reporting 
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  
hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  
normal  life functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or 
require  hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when,  based  upon  medical  judgment,  
they may jeopardize  the patient  or participant  and may require  medical  or surgical  
intervention  to prevent  one of the outcomes  listed  in this definition  
 
Note: Hospital  admission  for a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an 
SAE.

Approval date: 15 -Sep-2021   
  
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  starts  investigational  
treatment/intervention.  SAE reporting  is required  for 30-days after the participant’s  last 
investigational  treatment/intervention.  Any event  that occur  after the 30-day period  that is 
unexpected  and at least possibly  related  to protocol  treatment  must  be reported.  
 
Please  note:  Any SAE that occurs  prior to the start of investigational  treatment/intervention  
and is related  to a screening  test or procedure  (i.e., a screening  biopsy)  must  be reported.  
 
All patients  will be followed  for safety  and toxicity  related  to the study  drug (romiplostim).  
Potentially  serious  toxicities  are an expected  part of autologous  stem  cell transplantation.   
The reportable  adverse  events  (AEs)  and serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  associated  with 
autologous  stem  cell transplantation  will be defined  according  to the Adult  Bone  Marrow  
Transplant  (ABMT)  Adverse  Event  (AE) and Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE  Guide).  The ABMT  
AE and SAE Guide  is posted  as a Standard  Working  Procedure  (SWP)  on the Clinical  
Research  Policies  and Regulations  page:  
https://one.mskcc.org/sites/pub/clinresearch/Policies/Departmental%20SOPs/Adult%20BMT  
%20AE%20and%20SAE%20Guide.pdf  
 
All SAEs  must  be submitted  in PIMS.  If an SAE requires  submission  to the HRPP  office  per 
IRB SOP  RR-408 ‘Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  Events’,  the SAE report  must  be submitted  
within  5 calendar  days of the event.   All other  SAEs  must  be submitted  within  30 calendar  
days of the event.  
The report  should  contain  the following  information:

The MSKCC  research  staff must  also inform  Amgen,  Inc. of any pregnanacy  or exposure  to 
drug through  lactation  and the associated  reports  and outcomes  (i.e. unexpected  pregnancy,  
pregnancy  of partner,  spontaneous  abortion,  congenital  abnormality  etc.).  This report  must  
be sent to Amgen  Safety  within  1 business  day of MSKCC  research  staff awareness  for 
reports  meeting  serious  criteria,  and is not to exceed  15 calendar  days of MSKCC  research  
staff awareness  for non-serious  reports.  
16.1 PROTECTION  OF HUMAN  PARTICIPANTS  
 
Inclusion  of Children  in Research:  
This protocol/project  does not include  children  because  the number  of children  is limited  and 
the majority  are already  accessed  by a nationwide  pediatric  cancer  research  network.  This 
statement  is based  on exclusion  4b of the NIH Policy  and Guidelines  on the Inclusion  of 
Children  as Participants  in Research  Involving  Human  Subjects.  
 
Incentives/Costs/Benefits:  
No incentives  will be offered  to patients/subjects  for participation  in this study.  Participation  is 
voluntary.  The potential  benefits  of participation  in the study  will be weighed  against  other  
treatment  options  (see below)  including  supportive  care.  The patient/subject  or their health  
insurance  provider  will be responsible  for the costs  of standard  medical  care including  MD 
visits,  routine  blood  tests,  administration  of the study  drug,  and bone  marrow  biopsies  and 
aspirates.  The patient/subject  or their health  insurance  provider  will not be charged  for the 
study  drug romiplostim.  
 
Alternative  treatment  of patients:   Usual  care with transfusion  of platelets  when  necessary  as 
deemed  by treating  oncologist.  
 
16.1 Privacy  
 
MSK’s Privacy  Office  may allow  the use and disclosure  of protected  health  information  
pursuant  to a completed  and signed  Research  Authorization  form.  The use and disclosure  of 
protected health information will be limited to the individuals/entities described in the 
Research  Authorization  form.  A Research  Authorization  form must  be approved  by the IRB 
and Privacy  Board  (IRB/PB).  
The consent  indicates  that individualized   de identified  information  collected  for the purposes  
of this study  may be shared  with other  qualified  researchers.  Only researchers  who have 
received  approval  from MSK will be allowed  to access  this information  which  will not include  
protected  health  information,  such  as the participant’s  name,  except  for dates.  It is also 
stated  in the Research  Authorization  that their research  data may be shared  with others  at 
the time of study  publication.  
 
 
16.2 Data  Management  
 
A Clinical  Research  Coordinator  (CRC)  will be assigned  to the study  at MSKCC.  The 
responsibilities  of the CRC  include  project  compliance,  data collection,  abstraction  and entry,  
data reporting,  regulatory  monitoring,  problem  resolution  and prioritization,  and coordinate  
the activities  of the protocol  study  team.

Approval date: 15 -Sep-2021   
  
The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  database,  Medidata  Rave.  
Source  documentation  will be available  to support  the computerized  patient  record.  
Investigators  will permit  study -related  audits  by the sponsor,  IRB review,  and regulatory  
inspection(s)  (e.g.,  FDA,  EMEA,  TPP),  providing  direct  access  to the facilities  where  the 
study  took place,  to the source  documents,  and to all other  study  documents.  
Final data sets for publication  are required  to be locked  and stored  centrally  for potential  
future  access  requests  from outside  entities.  
16.3 Quality Assurance 
 
Weekly  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness  of 
registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing data and 
inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates,  the extent  and accuracy of evaluations  and follow -ups will be 
monitored  periodically  throughout  the study  period  for potential  problems,  which  will be brought  
to the attention  of the study  team  for discussion  and action.  
Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  will be conducted  by the study  
team,  at a minimum  of two times  per year,  or more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.4 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  Plan utilized  for this study  must  align with the MSK DSM   
Plan, where  applicable.  
 
The Data and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  were  approved  by 
the National  Cancer  Institute  in August  2018.  The plans  address  the new policies  set forth by 
the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the National  Cancer  Institute  for Data and Safety   
Monitoring   of Clinical  Trials.” 
 
There  are several  different  mechanisms  by which  clinical  studies  are monitored  for data,  
safety  and quality.  At a departmental/PI  level there  exists  procedures  for quality  control  by 
the research  team(s).  Institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  include  protocol  
monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  staff education  on clinical  research  QA 
and two institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our 
clinical  trials programs.  The committees:  Data and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for 
Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and the Data and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB) for Phase  III 
clinical  trials,  report  to the Deputy  Physician -in-Chief,   Clinical  Research.  
 
During  the protocol  development  and review  process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its 
level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  
The MSK DSMB  monitors  phase  III trials and the DSMC  monitors  non-phase  III trials.   The 
DSMB/C  have oversight  over the following  trials:  
• MSK Investigator  Initiated  Trials  (IITs;  MSK as sponsor)  
• External  studies  where  MSK is the data coordinating  center

IRB Number: 20 -180 A(9)  
Approval date: 15 -Sep-2021   
  
• Low risk studies  identified  as requiring  DSMB/C  review  
 
The DSMC  will initiate  review  following  the enrollment  of the first participant/or  by the end of 
the year one if no accruals and will continue  for the study  lifecycle  until there  are no 
participants  under  active  therapy  and the protocol  has closed  to accrual.  The DSMB  will 
initiate  review  once  the protocol  is open  to accrual.  
The MSKCC  research  staff will submit  to Amgen,  Inc. annual  safety  reports.  These  reports  
will include  SUSARs  and pregnancy  and lactation  exposure  (and any associated  
reports/outcomes).  The reports  will be sent to the NASCR  Manager  once  per year and at the 
end of the study.  Any other  report  containing  safety  data generated  during  the course  of the 
study  will also be sent to Amgen,  Inc. at the time of submission  to any body governing  
research  conduct.  A final end of study  safety report  will be sent to Amgen,  Inc. at the time of 
submission  to any body governing  but no later than 1 calendar  year past study  completion.

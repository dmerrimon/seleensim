Exclusion criteria 5 was updated to 
include exclusionary bilirubin 
levels at the Screening Visit, 
“…direct bilirubin level >2 mg/dL, 
or indirect bilirubin level 
>5mg/dL.” Due to the nature of this phase 
1 safety study, the exclusion 
criteri onwas clarified for 
elevated bilirubin levels. 
Exclusion criteria for indirect 
bilirubin ensures unconjugated 
bilirubin levels remain within 
the range validated for the 
ADAMTS13 activity assay. 
High direct bilirubin levels 
were excluded, which may 
indicate hepatic dysfunction.Section 1.1,Synopsis

Exclusion criteria 11 and 12 were 
deleted.Exclusion criteria 11 and 12 
were designed for hospitalized 
subjects in Part B and are no

criteria.
Detailed definitions of acceptable 
methods of contraception for 
female and male subjects w ere

subjects and those with in fections 
requiring IV antibiotics.Removal of subjects 
presenting with a VOC allows 
the criteria to be simplified to

crizanlizumab within the past 30 
days before dosing; and voxelotor 
within the past 14 days before 
dosing.To specify wash -out periods 
for 1.) anticoagulant and anti -
platelet therapies, based on 
advice from the FDA that these 
should be restricted during the 
study; and 2.) recently

hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or HIV 
infections.To clarify the exclusion 
criteria for the protocol -
specified viral serology 
assessments.Section 1.1, Synopsis

Details regarding exploratory 
biomarkers were removed in

The 9 h (±30 min) PK assessment 
timepoint was changed to 8 h 
(±30 min).Subject burden may be 
reduced w ith an 8 -hour PK 
sampling time point, as it 
limits the amount of time spent 
at the clinic. Section 1.3(Table 2)
Collection of daily opioid use data 
was removed from the Schedule of 
Activities and text regarding 
collection of oral opioid use as a 
Prior Treatment was updated.To reflect the removal of Part 
B endpoints related to opioid 
use; data on oral opioid use 
will be collected in the same 
manner as other prior and 
concomitant treatments.Section 1.3(Table 1)
Section 6.6.1
The introduction of this study was 
updated to reflect relevant 
background information for SCD 
subjects at baseline.To reflect the removal of Part 
B, and to reduce excess 
information that may not 
pertain to the current study 
population.Section 2
Follow ing the review of unblinded 
data for a completed dose cohort by 
the DEC, and a recommendation by 
the DEC that it is safe to proceed 
with enrollment of the next dose 
cohort, the Sponsor study team will 
have access to the unblinded data 
for the complet ed dose cohort, w ith 
details to be specified in an 
unblinding plan. Clarify the procedure for 
Sponsor review of unblinded 
data follow ing com pletion of a 
dose cohort and review  of 
safety data by the DEC. 
Unblinding the Sponsor study 
team is unlikely to int roduce a 
bias as efficacy is not being 
evaluated and cohorts are 
independent from each other.Section 6.2.4

1.PROTOCOL SUMMARY
1.1Synopsis
Protocol num ber: SHP655 -101 Drug: recombinant ADAMTS13 
Title of the study: A Phase 1, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, ascending dose, safety 
and PK/PD study of SHP655 (rADAMTS13) in sickle cell disease at baseline health
Short title: A Phase 1 study of SHP655 (rADAMTS13) in sickle cell disease
Study phase: Phase 1
Number of subjects (total and per treatment arm):
A total of approximately 20 subjects will be randomized to IP or placebo as follows: Four evaluable subjects 
(3active:1 placebo) at the 40 IU/kg dose cohort to be increased to 8 evaluable subjects per dose cohort 
(6active:2 placebo) in the 80 IU/kg and 160 IU/kg dose cohorts.
Investigator(s): Multicenter study
Site(s) and Regi on(s): 
The study will be conducted approximately at 20 sites in the United States
Study period (planned): 2019 -2022 Clinical phase: 1
Objectives:
Prim ary: 
•Assess safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of SHP655 in subjects w ith SCD at baseline health.
Secondary:
Pharm acokinetic
•Assess the single dose pharmacokinetics (PK) of SHP655 at 3 dose levels in subjects with SCD.
Pharm acody namic
•Assess the effect of SHP655 on von Willebrand factor (VWF) and platelets. Study the correlation of plasma 
free hemoglobin and thrombospondin on SHP655 activity and VWF. 
Exploratory:
•Assess additional exploratory biomarkers,  
.
Rationale:
This study will assess safety (including immunogenicity), tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics (PD) of 
ascending doses of SHP655 in SCD. It is expected that SHP655 (rADAMTS13) activity will be inhibited by 
plasma free hemoglobin and thrombospondin -1 to v ariable degrees across subjects. Additionally, dosing of 
SHP655 to supraphysiologic levels has not been characterized clinically. Understanding the relationships among 
PK, PD, biomarkers, and their clinical correlates can guide the design of the adaptive P hase 2/3 study.

Mode of Adm inistration : Single intravenous (IV) infusion.
Dose:
SHP655 w ill be administered at 3 dose levels of 40, 80, and 160 IU/kg. 
Placebo w ill be administered in an equivalent volume of the 3 dose levels of 40, 80, and 160 IU/kg as single IV 
infusion.
Methodology:
This is a Phase 1, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter, ascending dose study evaluating 
safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of SHP655 (rADAMTS13) in 12 -to 65 -year-old subjects with SCD. 
This study will characterize the PK and PD profile of SHP655.
Approximately 20 subjects w ith baseline SCD will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either SH P655 or 
placebo as a single IV infusion at one of the 3 dose levels of 40, 80, or 160 IU/kg. The dose cohorts w ill be 
opened sequentially, after safety data up to the Day 13 visit of the last subject in the previous dose cohort has 
been reviewed by the Dose Escalation Committee. 
The first 3 subjects will be dosed a minimum of 14 days apart to observe and interpret reactions and adverse 
events in order to ensure that no SAE requiring a pause or stop of the clinical trial (see Section 6.2.3.1 and 
Section 6.2.3.2) has occurred in the most recently treated subject.
Enrollment and escalation to the next dose cohort w ill be paused for review if anaphylaxis, neutralizing antibody, 
or death is reported.

2.INTRODUCTION
2.1Indication and Current Treatment Options 
Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a common genetic disorder affecting millions of people globall y and 
decreasing life expectancy  by 25 to 30 y ears (U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, 1996 ). 
In2006, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized SCD as a global public health 
problem ( World Health Organization., 2006) . Sickle cell disease is caused by  a single base 
substitution of valine for a glutamic acid a t the sixth amino acid of the gene coding for the 
hemoglobin (Hgb) βchain. This leads to sickle beta globin, which when deoxy genated forms 
chains of hemoglobin polymers that cause rigid and deformed (sickle -shaped) red blood cells. 
These sickle red cells are adhesive to endothelium and often unable to traverse the 
microcirculation. Damaged endothelium promotes white blood cell and platelet activations and 
adhesion, which in conjunction with sickled red cells, form blockages (vaso -occlusion) that 
cause decr eased ox ygen supply  to tissues. The resulting ischemic blockages in the 
microvasculature cause severe h ypoxia in tissues throughout the bod y, which can cause 
excruciating pain -often in multiple sites simultaneously  - and additional debilitating 
comorbidi ties. Protracted and repeated exposure to these hy
poxic crises can cause broad- ranging 
tissue injury, potentially  leading to organ failure and even death.
Management of SCD has evolved slowly . Currently , the onl y curative therapy  for SCD isbone 
marrow tra nsplant but the use of this procedure is limited because of a lack ofrelated or 
well-matched stem cell donors and risk for mortality and complications such as graft versus host 
disease (Bolaños -Meade and Brodsk y, 2014 ). Chronic red cell transfusion therap y can reduce 
symptoms and complications of SCD but comes with a risk of infection, allo -immunization and 
significant iron overload. The primary  pharmacotherap y approved for SCD is hydrox yurea. 
Hydroxy urea has been shown to reduce, but not eliminate VOCs requiring medical care and 
reduce the need for blood transfusions. Hy droxyurea continues to have a relatively low rate of 
use, especially  in adults, partly  because of its side effect profile, need for monitoring and 
conce rns of toxicity . L-glutamine was recentl y approved b y the food and drug administration for 
the reduction of VOCs as well, but there has yet to be widespread use of this agent partl y 
because of a modest effect in clinical studies. Currently  there are no age nts approved for the 
amelioration of vaso -occlusive painful episodes once they  occur ( Kato et al., 2018 ).Despite 
these therapeutic options, patients with SCD continue to suffer significant morbidity  and 
mortality , and there is an imperative to identify  and evaluate new treatments.
There ha s been increasing evidence to suggest that an elevated level of von Willebrand factor 
(VWF) antigen and the accumulation of larger VWF multimers in circulation are associated with 
the development of vaso -occlusion and thrombotic complications in patients w ith SCD 
(Zhou et al., 2009 ).

SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
Theexistence ofhyper-adhesive ultralarge VWF (ULVWF) multimers inplasma and on vascular 
endothelium indicates that the activity  of metalloprotease ADAMTS13, which cleaves ULVWF 
multimers to reduce their adhesiveness, is probably impaired in these patients with SCD. This 
impairment may  come from biochemical inhibitors of ADAMTS13 (free hemoglobin and 
thrombospondin- 1) and/or by  the relative deficiency  of ADAMTS13 that occurs as the 
concentrations of ULVWF increase without a concomitant increase in ADAMTS13 
concentration (Bonnefo y et al., 2006 ; Novelli et al., 2013 ; Zhou et al., 2011 ).
Ultralarge VWF additionally  promotes the aggregation of other process es that lead to 
vaso-occlusion in SCD (see Figure 2 in Zhou et al., 2011 ). As VWF binds endothelium and 
activated platelets, blood flow decreases. Decreased blood flow promotes white blood cell 
adherence to endothelium, decreases red cell transit time to promote increased deox ygenation 
and further sickling and hemoly sis, which in turn releases free hemo globin that impairs 
ADAMTS13 function.
The pathoph ysiologic role of VWF is thought to be common to all VOCs, and therefore 
treatment with rADAMTS13 may  be relevant for all VOCs. As therapeutic concentrations of 
ADAMTS13 are achieved, ULVWF is cleaved into lower molecular weight forms that are less 
adhesive and less able to trap cells in low blood flow areas. Therapeutic levels of ADAMTS13 is 
hypothesized to increase blood flow and lead to faster resolution of VOC pain that is caused by  
ischemia.
There may  be multiple reasons for the acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency  associated with SCD, all 
affecting the sy nthesis and activity  of the metalloprotease. The proinflammatory  cytokines such 
as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha and interleukin (IL) -8 have been shown to stimulate the 
secretion of ULVWF from inflamed endothelial cells, and IL- 6 has been shown to inhibit 
ADAMTS13. I t was also observed that the VWF cleavage activity  of plasma ADAMTS13 is 
about 35% lower in patients with SCD than in normal individuals, even t hough the antigen level 
of the metalloprotease was normal. Similarly , others have reported that the ADAMTS13 
activity /VWF antigen ratio is lower in patients with SCD. These observations support the view 
that there is acquired ADAMTS13 deficiency  associated with SCD.
2.2Product Background and Clinical Information
Takeda has developed a recombinant ADAMTS13 (rADAMTS13) named SHP655 (previously  
known as BAX 930) which is sy nthesized by  a genetically  engineered Chinese hamster ovary  
(CHO) cell line that expresses the human ADAMTS13 complementary  DNA (cDNA). To 
address concerns regarding the risk of transmission of blood- borne pathogens that may  be 
introduced b y human plasma, no exogenousl y added raw materials of human or animal origin are 
employ ed in the cell cultu re, purification, or formulation of the final product.

SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
Aplasma -protein- free method and 2 virus inactivation steps are used in this process. This 
process virtuall y eliminates an y risk of transmission of human blood- borne viruses or other 
adventitious agent s that could, in theory , be introduced by  the use of animal -or human
-derived 
raw materials. The onl y proteins present in the final product other than SHP655 are trace 
quantities of host cell (i.e., CHO) protein.
SHP655 is a composition of the fully  glycosylated recombinant human ADAMTS13 protein and 
a fully  glycosylated recombinant human ADAMTS13 protein variant. Testing of the SHP655 
cell bank in 2017 revealed a single nucleotide exchange (A to G) in the cataly tic domain 
resulting in amino acid change Glu tamine “Q” to Arginine “R” at position 97 at the protein level 
(described as “Q97R variant”). Further investigation revealed that the Q97R variant was 
consistent throughout product development, was a rare naturall y occurring variant in humans and 
did not a ppear to increase immunogenicit y. No differences in the structure/function relationship 
of native and variant protein in the composition was observed and no safety  concerns have been 
identified.  Variant protein constitutes between 52%- 72% of the product.
SHP655 is a ly ophilized formulation for intravenous (IV) injection. SHP655 is a composition of 
the fully  glycosylated recombinant human ADAMTS13 protein and a full y glycosylated 
recombinant human ADAMTS13 protein variant that appears to be benign in nature .
See Section 6.1for further information on the investigational product (IP) and its usage in this 
study . A detailed description of SHP655 is also provided in the investigator’s brochure (IB).
2.2.1 Nonclinical studies
Nonclinical studies have been performed in vitro and in vivo to characterize the safet y, efficacy, 
pharmacokinetic (PK), and toxicity  of SHP655 (Denorme et al., 2016 ; Denorme et al., 2015 ; 
Höllriegl et al., 2013 ; Kopic et al., 2016; Plaimauer and Scheiflinger, 2004 ).
The SHP655 nonclinical development program to support the planned Phase 1 trial in patients 
with sickle cell disease is based on the nonclinical program conducted with SHP655 for the 
indication of congenital TTP (cTTP). It includes in vivo testing for efficacy , safet y 
pharmacology , pharmacokinetics (PK), and toxicity  in several rodent and nonrodent species, 
including non
-human primates.
In addition to the nonclinical efficacy  studies already  submitted in support of TTP, which are 
considered supportive for the SCD indication, because the underly ing proposed mechanism of 
action is the same, the sponsor completed specific in vitro and in vivo efficacy  studies with 
SHP655 to support the use in the indication of SCD.

In an in vitro pharmacology  proof -of-concept study , the inhibitory  effect of hemoglobin on 
ADAMTS13 -mediated VWF multimer cleavage and whether ADAMTS13 can prevent or 
override this inhibitory  effect of hemoglobin were evaluated. Results confirmed the inhibitory  
effect of hemoglobin at concentrations approximating those in patients during acute VOC and 
showed that this effect can be prevented b y appropriate concentrations of rADAMTS13.
In an in vivo pharmacology  proof -of-concept study, a transgenic mouse model for human SCD 
(Tim Townes mouse), was used to assess the effects of SHP655 administration on hy poxia 
induced SCD -related acute VOC. Mice were studied under two forms of hypoxia, a severe form 
to study  the survival and more mild version to study  the effect on blood and tissue parameters. 
Under the severe h ypoxic conditions, SS mice treated with SHP655 survived, while all 
vehicle -treated SS animals were sacrificed in extremis. Under the milder hy poxic conditions, 
SHP655 reduced the h ypoxia-induced sy stemic inflammation and hemoly sis, pulmonary  vascular 
leakage, vaso -constriction, inflammatory  vasculopathy , formation of cell inflammatory  infiltrate, 
and thrombi in lung and kidney .
General safet y pharmacology  evaluations did not find deleterious effects of SHP655 on 
cardiovascular and respiratory  functions in cy nomolgus monkey s. Pharmacokinetic evaluations 
demonstrated similar PK profiles for SHP655 in rats and cynomolgus monkey s. 
Overall, the completed nonclinical toxicity  studies with SHP655 support the following 
conclusions:
SHP655 did not cause any  adverse effects on respiratory  and cardiovascular functi on in 
cynomolgus monkey s at a dose up to 400 IU/kg, which was the highest dose tested.
In a 4 -week repeat dose toxicity  study  in rats the no -observed -
adverse- effect -level 
(NOAEL) was 1820 IU/kg/day , the highest dose tested in this study  and the maximum 
feasible dose.
In a long- term toxicity  study  in rats, there was no evidence of toxicity  after IV injection of 
400 IU/kg every  3 day s for 26 weeks. Based on these results, the NOAEL was considered 
to be at 400 IU/kg, which was the highest dose tested.
Administ ration of 80, 200, or 400 IU/kg SHP655 once a week for 29 day s in cy nomolgus 
monkey s did not cause any  adverse clinical s ymptoms, target organ pathologies, or other 
adverse findings directl y attributable to the test item. The NOAEL was the highest dose 
tested, 400 IU/kg.
SHP655 was well tolerated after IV (intended clinical administration route) (5 mL), 
intra-arterial (5 mL), and paravenous (0.5 mL) administration in a local tolerance study  in 
New Zealand white rabbits.

In female fertility  and embry o-fetal development and pre and postnatal development 
studies in rats, no reproductive toxicity  was observed at doses up to 400 IU/kg, which was 
the highest dose tested. A human placenta transfer study  demonstrated that there is no 
biologicall y relevant transfer of SHP655 from the maternal blood circulation to the 
embry o.
Please see Section 4 of the IB for further details on nonclinical studies of SHP655.
2.2.2 Clinical studies
The use of SHP655 has not yet been examined in patients with SCD. I n the completed first in 
human Phase 1 Study  281101 in patients with congenital thrombotic thrombocy topenic purpura, 
SHP655 was active in vivo, including effects on VWF multimers and platelet counts. 
Please refer to Section 5of the IB for further details on effects of SHP655.
2.3Study Rationale
Sickle cell disease patients have a higher ratio of ULVWF:ADAMTS13 activity  compared to 
that found in the health y population. By  increasing the concentration of plasma ADAMTS13 
with SHP655, a more physiologic balance of ULVWF:ADAMTS13 ratio may be restored 
(Schnog et al., 2006 ; Sins et al., 2017) . Dosing to achieve a m eaningful increase over normal 
activity  (i.e., supraph ysiologic) levels is anticipated to be necessary  to achieve a therapeutic 
effect in the presence of biochemical inhibitors (i.e., plasma free hemoglobin and 
thrombospondin- 1) to ADAMTS13 and relativel y high concentrations of ULVWF.
This study  will assess safety  (including immunogenicity ), tolerability , PK and 
pharmacod ynamics (PD) of SHP655 in SCD. Understanding the relationships among PK, PD, 
biomarkers, and their clinical correlates can guide the desig n of the subsequent studies. 
2.4Benefit/Risk Assessment
The benefit -risk relationship was carefull y considered in the planning of this study . Based on the 
nonclinical data available from the IB to date, the conduct of this study  is considered justifiable 
using the dose(s) and dosage regimen(s) of SHP655 as specified in this clinical study protocol. A 
direct benefit is considered unlikely  for participants in this Phase 1 study . The sample size of the 
dose cohorts was chosen to provide descriptive statistics to further explore the safet y, PK, PD, 
and immunogenicit y of SHP655 in the specific indication. Participation in this study  may  help 
develop important scientific knowledge that should contribute to the development of better 
comprehensive treatment of subject s with SCD. A Dose Escalation Committee is planned for 
ongoing safet y review during the stud y.

The Dose Escalation Committee may stop enrollment and/or escalation to the next dose cohort 
based on the criteria outlined in Section 6.2.3.1 and Section 6.2.3.2. A list of dose -limiting 
toxicities can be found in Section
 6.2.3.2.
In summary , it needs to be determined that the benefits of conducting the study  outweigh the 
potential risks of SHP655 administration at this stage of product development. The key societal 
benefit is a better understanding of treatment options for patients with SCD.
Currently , the highest dose planned for this study  is 160 I U/kg, allowing a 2.5 -fold safet y margin 
from the lowest NOAEL in the 6- month toxicity  study  (400 IU/kg). Data from the most recent 
repeat dose toxicity  study  in rat, with daily  administration of 800 and 1820 IU/kg/day for 30 days 
even allow 5- fold and 11 -fold, based on exposure and dose respectivel y, safety margin for the 
highest d ose planned for this study  of 160 IU/kg.
Alway s refer to the latest version of the SHP655 IB for the overall benefit/risk assessment and 
the most accurate and current information regarding drug metabolism, pharmacokinetics, 
efficacy , and safet y of SHP655.

4.STUDY DESIGN
4.1 Overall Design 
This is a Phase 1, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, multicenter ascending dose 
study  evaluating the safety , tolerability , and immunogenicity  of SHP655 (rADAMTS13) in 18 to 
65-year-old subjects with SCD. This study  will also characterize the PK and assess the PD of 
SHP655 and its effect on biomarkers.
Dose escalation
Approximately  20subjects with baseline SCD wi ll be randomized in a 3:1 ratio to receive either 
SHP655 or placebo as single IV infusion at 3 dose levels: 40 IU/kg (n=4), 80 IU/kg (n=8), or 
160IU/kg (n=8). The dose cohorts will be opened sequentially, after safet y data up to the Day 13 
visit of the la st subject in the previous dose cohort has been reviewed b y the Dose Escalation 
Committee. The number of subjects will be increased to 8 subjects per dose cohort 
(6active:2 placebo) in the 80 IU/kg and 160 IU/kg dose cohorts for more robust PK, PD, 
clinic al, and biomarker assessments.
There will be a 14 -day interval between dosing for the first 3 subjects in any  dose cohort. The 
higher dose cohorts will be opened onl y after safety  data from up to Day 13 post -infusion from 
all subjects at the corresponding dose have been evaluated by  the Dose Escalation Committee. 
Enrollment and escalation to next dose cohort will be paused for review if anaphylaxis, 
neutralizing antibod y, or death is reported.
4.2Scientific Rationale for Study Design
The ratio of ULVWF:ADAMTS13 activity  is higher in subjects with SCD than in healthy  
people. Hence, the stud y population selected for thisstudy  includes subjects with SCD. 
Additionally , dosing of SHP655 to supraphysiologic levels has not been characterized clinically . 
In this Phase 1, dose escalation study , SHP655 or placebo will be administered as single dose 
IVinfusion at 3 dose levels (40, 80, and 160 IU/kg) to evaluate PK, PD, clinical, and biomarker 
assessments.
Using a placebo improves the integrit y of the study in several way s. Placebo provides a 
comparison group for evaluation of safet y in a study  population that is anticipated to have 
comorbidities that are reported as AEs. Obtaining PK/PD assessments on subjects receiving 
placebo serves as a control group for PK/PD and biomarker assessments.

Blinding IP treatment removes bias from the study design. Knowledge of active versus placebo 
treatment can influence reporting of safety events, perception and reporting of pain, and affect 
clinical management decisions tha t can influence study  outcomes. Similarly, randomization
reduces bias b y ensuring that a relationship between baseline characteristics and outcomes is due 
to chance, and not b y confounding traits (e.g., disease severity).
A Dose Escalation Committee is inc luded in the study  design to provide ongoing monitoring of 
safet y and stud y progress. At each dose level, a decision must be made about the safet y of 
increasing to a higher dose level. The Dose Escalation Committee may  recommend that the 
number of subjects at a dose level be changed to obtain additional safet y information, cap 
enrollment at a dose level, or modify  a dose at a subsequent dose level, taking into consideration 
data that are observed in other cohorts.
4.3Justification for Dose
Dosing to achieve a meaningful increase over normal activity  (i.e., supraphy siologic) levels is 
anticipated to be needed for a therapeutic effect in the presence of biochemical inhibitors to 
ADAMTS13 and relatively  high concentrations of ULVWF. Doses are escalated to evaluate
safet y prior to higher dose exposure. Single dose exposure to 40 IU/kg has been found to be safe 
and well tolerated in subjects with congenital thrombotic thrombocy topenia purpura and was 
selected as the starting dose for this study . 
A mechanistic PK/PD modeling stud y guided dosing of SHP655 b y providing a quantitative 
relationship between dose level and VWF activity. Based on the clinical goal of reducing the 
VWF activity  level in SCD patients with a VOC to a normal level, the model indicates that this 
can be achieved with a single dose of approximately  120 U/kg. The low exposures of SHP655 in 
the monkey  study  were attributed to neutralizing antibodies and are not considered to be 
predictive of antibody  formation in humans, therefore the rat data is more relevant for deriving 
safet y margins. The NOAEL  (1820 U/kg) observed in the 30 -day daily administration study  in 
rats represents a 10.8X safet y margin to the starting dose (40 U/kg) and a 5.6X safet y margin to 
the highest proposed clinical dose 160 U/kg in
the initial Phase 1 clinical trial based upon 
predicted clinical exposure. Thus, the dose levels selected in this study  were 40, 80, and 
160IU/kg.
4.4Duration of Subject Participation and Study Completion Definition

6.2.1 Interactive Response Technology for Inves tigational Product Management
An IRT s ystem will be used for screening and randomizing subjects, recording subject visits, I P 
supply  dispensation and management, inventory  management and suppl y ordering, IP expiration 
tracking and management, I P return, and emergency  unblinding. Please refer to the Study  
Manual for additional details regarding the IRT system.
6.2.2 Allocation of Subjects to Treatment 
This is a double -blind, placebo -controlled stud y. The actual treatment given to individual 
subjects is determined by a randomization schedule.
Subject numbers are assigned to all subjects as they consent to take part in the study . Within each 
site (numbered uniquel y within a protocol), the subject number is assigned to subjects according 
to the sequence of presentation for study  participation.
The randomization number represents a unique number corresponding to I P allocated to the 
subject, once eligibility  has been determined.
Individual subject treatment is automatically  assigned by  the IRT following a 3:1 ratio between 
SHP655 vs. placebo within each dose cohort.
Once a randomization number/unique identifier has been assigned, that number must not be used 
again if, for example, a subject is withdrawn from the study . If a randomization number/unique 
identifie r is allocated incorrectl y, the clinical research associate (CRA)/study monitor must be 
notified as soon as the error is discovered.
Investigational product packaging identification numbers, separate from randomization 
numbers/unique identifiers, may  also be assigned to subjects for specific treatment assignment as 
dictated b y the study. In these cases, the same IP packing identification number may  not be 
assigned to more than one subject.
6.2.3 Dosing
The I P will be administered intravenousl y.
SHP655/placebo will be administered as a single IV infusion at 3 dose levels: 40 IU/kg (n=4), 
80IU/kg (n=8), and 160 IU/kg (n=8).
The IP will be infused at 4 mL /min, to achieve an infusion rate of 1200 IU/min with 300 IU/vial 
preparation.
Note: For 100 kg person at 160 IU/ kg = 16 000 IU/1200 I U/min = 13 minutes.

The first 3 subjects in each dose cohort will be dosed a minimum of 14 days apart to observe and 
interpret reactions and adverse events in order to ensure that no related SAE requiring a pause or 
stop of the clinica l trial (see Section 6.2.3.1 and Section 6.2.3.2) has occurred in the most 
recentl y treated subject.
In the event that DLT criteria are met (see Section
 6.2.3.2), either revision of the dose to a lowe r, 
intermediate level or augmented enrollment of the previous dose level will be considered.
6.2.3.1 Stopping Criteria for Dose Escalation 
1.If 2 or more subjects in a given cohort receiving active drug have a related SAE in any  vital 
organ or bod y system, no further subjects will be enrolled or dosed until further evaluation of 
the available data is made by  the medical monitor and investigator to determine whether to 
stop or proceed with the study . Following a safet
y review of the event, study enrollment or 
dosing of currentl y enrolled subjects may be restarted if the Dose Escalation Committee 
determines that it is safe to proceed with the stud y.
2.Any neutralizing antibody  to SHP655 that develops after administration.
3.Any death that is possibly  related to SHP655 administration.
4.If any other drug -
related event occurs in subjects receiving active drug and is deemed to pose 
an unacceptable risk to subjects by  the investigator or medical monitor after further 
evaluation, no further subjects will be enrolled or dosed until further evaluation of the 
available data is made b y the Dose Escalation Committee to determine whether to proceed 
with the study . Following a safet y review of the event, study  enrollment or dosing of 
currentl y enrolled subjects may be restarted if th e medical monitor and the investigator 
determine that it is safe to proceed with the study .
6.2.3.2 Dose Limiting Toxicities
DLT are defined according to Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
v5.0. 
DLT are defined as two events of any  of the foll owing AEs at least possibly related to SHP655 
within a dose cohort:
Purpura Grade 2
Gastrointestinal hemorrhage Grade 1 (lower gastrointestinal, oral, esophageal, gastric, 
duodenal, ileal, cecal, or colonic hemorrhage)
Epistaxis Grade 2 
For non-commercial use only
Takeda CONFIDENTIAL Page 41
recom binant ADAMTS13
SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
Menorrhagia Grade 2
Hematuria Grade 1
In the event that 2 DLTs are observed within a dose cohort, a Dose Escalation Committee 
meeting will be convened to review the treatment assignment of the subjects experiencing the 
toxicities to determine if DL T criteria have been met. 
The following are DLTs if observed in one SHP655 treated subject:
Purpura Grade 3 or higher
Gastrointestinal hemorrhage Grade 2 or higher (lower gastrointestinal, oral, esophageal, 
gastric, duodenal, ileal, cecal, or colonic hemorrhage)
Epistaxis Grade 3 or higher
Menorrhagia Grade 3 or higher
Hematuria Grade 2 or higher
Stroke Grade 2 or higher
Intracranial hemorrhage Grade 1 or higher
Any Grade 4 AE at least possibly  related to SHP655 exposure.
DLTs are not to be AEs assessed by  the investigator as disease related. 
6.2.3.3 Dose Escalation Committee 
Throughout the stud y, dose escalation meetings will commence at regular time points to review 
safet y data and authorize progression into the next cohort. Th e Dose Escalation Committee may  
recommend continuing the study , stop dose escalation, expand a dose cohort to obtain more 
safet y data, modify or add a dose escalation in between planned dose cohorts (e.g., 120 IU/kg 
after the 80 IU/kg dose cohort is evalua ted), and add a dose to a treatment regimen within a dose 
cohort. The following arrangement is planned for the Dose Escalation Committee to help 
maintain study  integrity .
The Dose Escalation Committee will convene at least after every  dose cohort has been enrolled 
and completed up to the 2 week Follow
-Up Visit. 
If AEs are observed within a dose cohort that could meet DLT criteria, the Dose Escalation 
Committee will review treatment assignments to determine whether the DLT has been reached.
The Dose Escalat ion Committee will recommend whether:
1. It is safe to proceed to the next dose cohort

SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
2.A dose level may  be modified, reduced, or repeated, depending on the outcome of the safety  
data review
3.A dose level should be added or eliminated
4.Protocol modifications reg arding dosing are needed
Dose escalation committee review meetings will be held after SAE and immunogenicit y data are 
available up to Day 13 of the last subject in the dose cohort. This dose cohort will be opened for 
Dose Escalation Committee review. Enrol lment will be paused for review for any  case of 
anaph ylaxis, neutralizing antibody , life-threatening condition, or death.
The Dose Escalation Committee will have a charter that defines roles, responsibilities, and 
procedures.
6.2.4 Unblinding the Treatment Assig nment
The treatment assignment must not be unblinded to the investigator during the study except in 
emergency  situations where identification of the IP is required for medical management of the 
subject. The investigator should contact the medical monitor as soon as possible after the 
treatment code has been broken and the investigator is unblinded. 
In the event that the treatment assignment code is broken, the date and the signature of the person 
who broke the code are recorded on the IRT and in the source docum ents, as applicable. The 
reason for breaking the code will be recorded in the source documents, as appropriate, based on 
safet y or deviation reporting. Upon breaking the blind, the subject will be withdrawn from the 
study , but should be followed up for saf ety purposes. An ycode -breaks that occur must be 
reported to IQVIA and Takeda. For blinded studies, there will be a provision for unblinding to 
ensure adequate management of the subject in the case of an emergency .
Following the review of unblinded data fo r a completed dose cohort by  the DEC, and a 
recommendation b y the DEC that it is safe to proceed with enrollment of the next dose cohort, 
theSponsor study  team will have access to the unblinded data for the completed dose cohort, 
with details to be specif ied in anunblinding plan . 
6.2.5 Dose Modification
The decision to proceed to the next dose cohort will be made b y the Dose Escalation Committee 
based on safet y, tolerability , and preliminary  PK and/or pharmacod ynamic data. Enrollment will 
be paused for review for any  case of anaphy laxis, neutralizing antibody , or death.

SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
The Dose Escalation Committee will monitor the safet y of the stud y and will have standing to 
stop dose escalation, expand a dose cohort to obtain more safet y data, modify or add a dose 
escalation in between planned dose cohort, and add a dose to a treatment regimen within a dose 
cohort.
In the event that DLT criteria are met (see Section 6.2.3.2), either revision of the dose to a lower, 
intermediate level or augmented enrollment of the previous dose level will be considered.
The I
P will be permanently  discontinued or temporaril y discon tinued based on Dose Escalation
Committee ’s decision or after discussion with sponsor.
6.3 Labeling, Packaging, Storage, and Handling of Investigational Product
6.3.1 Labeling
Labels containing study  information and pack identification are applied to the I P(s) cont ainer.
All IP(s) is labeled with a minimum of the following: Protocol number, dosage form (including 
product name and quantity in pack), directions for use, storage conditions, expiry  date, batch 
number and/or packaging reference, the statements “For clini cal study  use only ” and/or 
“CAUTION: New Drug –Limited by  Federal (or US) Law to Investigational Use”.
Space is allocated on the label so that the site representative can record a unique subject 
identifier.
Additional labels (e.g., those used when dispensing marketed product) may, on a case- by-case 
basis, be applied to the IP in order to satisfy  local or institutional requirements, but must not:
Contradict the clinical study  label.
Obscure the clinical study label.
Identify  the study  subject by  name.
Break the study  blind
Additional labels may  not be added without the sponsor’s prior full agreement.
6.3.2 Packaging
Details are provided in Section 6.1.1.
Changes to sponsor -supplied packaging prior to dosing may  not occur without full agreement in 
advance b y the sponsor.

SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
6.3.3 Storage
The investigator has overall responsibility  for ensuring that IP is stored in a secure, limited 
access location. L imited responsibil ity may  be delegated to the pharmacy  or member of the stud y 
team, but this delegation must be documented. Investigational products are administered by  
qualified study  personnel or designee. The pharmacist/nominated team member will enter the 
unique subject identifier on the I P bottle/carton labels as they  are distributed. Unblinded 
pharmacists will have access to I P supplied by  the sponsor. Other study  staff should only  have 
access to I P in blinded s yringes with the appropriate label.
Investigational produc t must be stored in accordance with labeled storage conditions. 
Temperature monitoring is required at the storage location to ensure that the I P is maintained 
within an established temperature range. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the 
temperature is monitored throughout the duration of the study  and that records are maintained; 
the temperature should be monitored continuously by  using either an in -house sy stem, a 
mechanical recording device such as a calibrated chart recorder, or b y manua l means, such that 
both minimum and maximum thermometric values over a specific time period can be recorded 
and retrieved as required.
Such a device (i.e., certified min/max thermometer) would require manual resetting upon each 
recording. The sponsor must be notified immediately upon discovery of any  excursion from the 
established range. Temperature excursions will require site investigation as to cause and 
remediation. The sponsor will determine the ultimate impact of excursions on the I P and will 
provide supportive documentation as necessary . Under no circumstances should the product be 
dispensed to subjects until the impact has been determined and the product is deemed appropriate 
for use b y the sponsor.
The sponsor should be notified immediately  if there are an y changes to the storage area of the IP 
that could affect the integrity  of the product(s), e.g., fumigation of a storage room.
All controlled -substance IP for the sponsor’s studies must be stored in a securely  locked, 
substantially  constructed room or cabinet according to all applicable local, state, and/or national 
laws. L imited, controlled access to these IP(s) must be maintained, as well as chain of custody , 
for all I P movement.
6.3.4 Special Handling
SHP655 must not be used bey ond the expiration date printed on the vial. Freezing should be 
avoided at all times to prevent damage to the diluent vial. Before administration, the 
reconstituted product has to be brought to room temperature. Storage of SHP655 
post-reconstitution should be limited to 3 hours a t room temperature. 
For non-commercial use only
Takeda CONFIDENTIAL Page 45
recom binant ADAMTS13
SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
Incase large volumes of SHP655 are required, it is possible to pool multiple vials of SHP655 
together. The contents of each reconstituted product can be drawn in a single sy ringe. The 
recommended storage condition for SHP655 is 2 to 8°C. The expiration date for SHP655 is 
included on the I P label. The stability  of the clinical lots will be monitored throughout the period 
of use in clinical studies.
For additional information please refer to the SHP655 IB and/or other specific instruction s 
provided b y the sponsor. Changes to sponsor -supplied packaging prior to dosing may  not occur 
without full agreement in advance b y the sponsor. 
6.4 Drug Accountability
Investigators will be provided with sufficient amounts of the I P to carry  out this protoco l 
fortheagreed number of subjects. The investigator or designee will acknowledge 
receipt oftheIP, documenting shipment content and condition. Accurate records of all 
IPdispensed, used, returned, and/or destro yed must be maintained as detailed further in this 
section.
The investigator has overall responsibility  for administering/dispensing I P. Where permissible, 
tasks may  be delegated to a qualified designee (e.g., a pharmacist) who is adequatel y trained in 
the protocol and who works under the direct su pervision of the investigator. This delegation must 
be documented in the applicable study  delegation of authority  form.
The investigator or his/her designee (as documented by  the investigator in the applicable study  
delegation of authorit y form) will admin ister the IP only  to subjects included in this study  
following the procedures set out in the study  protocol. Each subject will be given onl y the IP 
carrying his/her treatment assignment. All administered medication will be documented in the 
subject’s sourc e and/or other I P record.
No IP stock or returned inventory  from a Takeda -sponsored study  may  be removed from the site 
where originally  shipped without prior knowledge and consent by  the sponsor. If such transfer is 
authorized by  the sponsor, all applicable local, state, and national laws must be adhered to for the 
transfer.
The sponsor or its representatives must be permitted access to review the supplies storage and 
distribution procedures and records provided that the blind of the study  is not compromise d.
At the end of the stud y, or as instructed b y the sponsor, all unused stock, and empty/used IP 
packaging are to be sent to a nominated contractor on behalf of the sponsor. Investigational 
products being returned to the sponsor’s designated contractors mu st be counted and verified by  
clinical site personnel and the sponsor (or designated CRO).

SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
Forunused supplies where theoriginal supplied tamper -evident feature is verified as intact, the 
tamper -evident feature must not be broken and the labeled amount is to be documented in lieu of 
counting. Shipment return forms, when used, must be signed prior to shipment from the site. 
Validated electronic return sy stems (i.e., IRT) do not require a shipment form. Returned 
IP(s)must be packed in a tamper -evident manne r to ensure product integrity . Contact the sponsor 
for authorization to return any  IP prior to shipment. Shipment of all returned I P must comply  
with local, state, and national laws.
Based on entries in the site drug accountability  forms, it must be possib le to reconcile IPs 
delivered with those used and returned. All I P(s) must be accounted for and all discrepancies 
investigated and documented to the sponsor’s satisfaction.
6.5 Subject Compliance
The I P will be administered in the study  center b y the authorize d study  center staff. The 
investigator or designee will record the correct dose, date, and time of administration on the 
Drug Accountability  Record.
6.6 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
All non- study  treatment (including but not limited to herbal treatments, vita mins, behavioral 
treatment, non -pharmacological treatment, such as psy chotherap y, as appropriate) received 
within 30 day s prior to the Screening Visit (Visit 1) (or pharmacokinetic equivalent of 
5half-lives, whichever is longer) and through the final stud y contact (including protocol defined 
follow -up period) must be recorded in the subject’s source document. 
6.6.1 Prior Treatment
Prior treatment includes all treatment (including but not limited to herbal treatments, vitamins, 
non-pharmacological treatment such as ps ychotherap y as appropriate) received within 30 days of 
the date of screening. Prior blood transfusion history  will be collected for 90 day s prior to 
screening. Prior treatment information must be recorded in the subject’s source document, 
including u se of oral opioids.
6.6.2
Concomitant Treatment 
Concomitant treatment refers to all treatment taken between screening and the study  
completion/termination visit, inclusive. Concomitant treatment information must be recorded in 
the subject’s source document.

6.6.3 Permitted Treatment
Use of stable dose of h ydroxyurea for 3 months prior to Screening Visit, and steroid for 
inhalation or topical application are permitted during the study . Females of childbearing potential 
are to continue using their hormonal contraceptives and postmenopausal women are allowed to 
use hormone replacement therap y.
The investigator must record the use of all concomitant medications, both prescribed and 
over-the-counter, into the electronic case report form (eCRF) and subject’s medical records. This 
includes medications used on both a regular and an as needed basis.
Subjects should be discouraged from starting an y new medication, both prescribed and 
over-the-counter, without consulting the investigator, unless the new medication is required for 
emergency  use or has been prescribed for clinical need.
The Sponsor recommends that subjects not be administered a vaccine against SARS -CoV2 
during the Stud y Period. Should a subject receive such a vaccination during the Stud y Period, the 
Sponsor recommend s study  investigators to follow patients closel y for vaccine -related adverse 
events for 14 day s after vaccination, in collaboration with the study medical monitor.
6.6.4 Prohibited Treatment
Systemic steroids within 48 hours prior to randomization
L-glutamine, voxelotor, and crizanlizumab are restricted during the study  period
Anticoagulant or anti- platelet medications
Illicit drugs are prohibited during the stud y treatment 
Coagulation factor concentrates 
Administration of another investigational drug or devic e 
A subject who has taken any  of these medications or received an y of these non- drug therapies 
during the stud y ma y be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the sponsor.
6.7Adverse event management
The mechanism of action of SHP655 reduces high molecular weight von Willebrand factor. 
SHP655 dosing theoretically  could induce a von Willebrand disease phenoty pe. In the event of 
hemorrhage after SHP655 dosing consistent with DL T criteria in Section 6.2.3.2 , treatment that 
replenishes von Willebrand factor may  be indicated.

Immunogenicit y to SHP655 theoreticall y could result in a TTP -like syndrome. I n case of 
evolving thrombocy topenia, neurologic c hanges, or thrombotic microangiopathy  that emerges 
after IP dosing, ADAMTS13 activity  should be tested. Treatment of an immunogenicit y-induced 
TTP event with standard TTP treatment would be expected to be beneficial.
SHP655 should not be administered in pa tients with known hy persensitivity to any  of the 
components of rADAMTS13. As with any  i.v. protein product, allergic- type hy persensitivity  
reactions are possible. Subjects must be closely monitored for an y symptoms throughout the 
infusion period. Subjects should be informed of the earl y signs of h ypersensitivity  reactions 
including hives, generalized urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, h ypotension, and 
anaph ylaxis. I f these s ymptoms occur, the administration should be discontinued immediately . In 
case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.

7.DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY TREATMENT AND S UBJECT 
DISCONTINUATION/WITH DRAWAL
7.1Discontinuation of Study Treatment
If IP is discontinued, regardless of the reason, the evaluations listed f or study  completion visit 
will be performed as completely  as possible. Whenever possible, all discontinued subjects should 
also undergo the protocol -specified evaluations at termination visit. Comments (spontaneous or 
elicited) or complaints made b y the su bject regarding discontinuation must be recorded in the 
source documents. The reason for discontinuation, date of discontinuation of the I P, and the total 
amount of I P administered must be recorded in the source documents.
Subjects may  be replaced at the s ame dose cohort for drop out prior to the Day 13 
immunogenicit y sampling.
7.2Reasons for Discontinuation 
The reason for discontinuation must be determined by  the investigator and recorded in the 
subject’s source document. I f a subject is discontinued for mor e than one reason, each 
reason should be documented in the source and the most clinically  relevant reason should be 
indicated. 
Reasons for discontinuation include, but are not limited to:
Adverse event
Protocol deviation
Withdrawal by  subject
Lost to follow -up
Other (e.g., pregnancy )
7.3Withdrawal from the Study
A subject may  withdraw from the study  at any  time and for an y reason without prejudice to 
his/her future medical care b y the ph ysician or at the institution, or may  be withdrawn at an y 
time at the discretion of the investigator or sponsor (e.g., in the interest of subject safet y). The 
investigator is encouraged to discuss withdrawal of a subject with the medical monitor when 
possible.
7.4 Subjects “Lost to Follow- up” Prior to the Last Scheduled Visit
Aminimum of 3 documented attempts must be made to contact an y subject who is lost to 
follow -up at an y time point prior to the last scheduled contact (office visit or telephone contact).

8.STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Prior to performing an y study assessme nts that are not part of routine medical care for 
thesubject, the investigator will obtain written informed consent as described in Appendix 1.5. 
Any subject who is randomized is considered a subject enrolled in the study .
The following series of numbers will comprise the subject identifier: The last three digits of 
theprotocol identifie r (i.e., 101), a 3- digit study  site number (e.g., 002), and 4 -digit subject 
number (e.g., 0003) assigned by  the IRT sy stem and reflecting the order of enrollment 
(i.e., signing the ICF). For example, the third subject who signed an ICF at study  site 002 wi ll 
beidentified as Subject 101-002- 0003. All study  documents (e.g., case report forms [CRFs], 
clinical documentation, sample containers, drug accountability  logs, etc.) will include the 
subject identifier. Subjects who fail to meet eligibility  criteria ma y be re -screened during the 
open screening period of the study . A different subject identifier will be issued to all such 
subjects.
8.1Study Schedule
The overall study  design is illustrated in Figure 1. Details on the assessments to be performed at 
each stud y visit, including screening, are provided in
 Table 1. Study  assessments are detailed in 
Section 8.2.
8.1.1 Screening Visit
All screening procedures and confirmation of eligibility  shall take place within 28 day s prior to 
the first infusion of I P. If the I P is not infused within 28 day s, all scree ning assessments must be 
repeated to reconfirm eligibility .
The study  site is responsible for maintaining a screening and enrollment log that includes all 
subjects who provided informed consent. The log also will serve to document the reason for 
screening failure.
A screen failure is a subject who has given informed consent and failed to meet the inclusion 
and/or met at least 1 of the exclusion criteria and has not been randomized or administered IP. A 
complete or partial re -screen may  also become necessary at the discretion of the investigator or 
sponsor.
8.1.2 Treatment Period 
On Day 1, the subjects will be randomized to receive either SHP655 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. 
Additional Day 1 procedures will be carried out in accordance with the Schedule of Assessment
in Table 1. 
For non-commercial use only
Takeda CONFIDENTIAL Page 52
recom binant ADAMTS13
SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
Subjects with anyongoing AEs orSAEs atthetime ofscheduled discharge from thestudy  center 
should remain at the study center until the investigator has determined that these events have 
been resolved or deemed as not clinically  significant by  the investigator.
The Treatment Period consists of the Day  1 IP infusion through the last planned PK/PD 
assessment.
8.1.3 Follow -up Period
The follow -up period for this protocol is 13 days. At the end of this period there will be 
aFollow -Up Visit query  for SAEs, AEs, and concomitant treatments. All AEs and SAEs that are 
not resolved at the time of this contact will be followed to closure (see Appendix 3.2).
8.1.4 Study Completion/Termination Visit
After the follow -up period, all subjects will return to the study  center for the EOS Visit. The 
EOS will be on Day 28 fo llowing IP infusion. Subjects who discontinue the study  early will be 
asked to return to the study  center for the termination visit. 
Different procedures will be carried out in accordance with the Schedule of Assessments in 
Table 1.
8.1.5
Additional Care of Subjects after the Study
No aftercare is planned for this study .
8.2Study Assessments 
8.2.1 Demographic and Other Baseline Characteristics
Subject demographic in formation and other baseline characteristics including gender, age, and 
race, vital signs, ph ysical examination, height/weight, medical history , prior medications, AE, 
etc. will be collected prior to the subject receiving the first dose of IP.
8.2.2 Safety
8.2.2.1 Physi cal Examination
At screening and subsequent study visits (refer to Section 1.3), a ph ysical examination will be 
performed b y the investigator. A complete ph ysical examination includes, general appearance, 
eyes, ears, nose, throat, chest/respiratory , heart/cardiovascular, liver/gastrointestinal, 
extremities/musculoskeletal, skin/dermatological, neck/thyroid, lymph nodes, 
psychiatric/neurological sy stems.

recom binant ADAMTS13
SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
Abnormalities identified at the Screening Visit and at subsequent study  visits will be recorded in 
the subject’s source documents. At study  visits, if a new abnormal or worsened abnormal 
pre-existing condition is detected, the condition will be descr ibed on the AE CRF. If the 
abnormal value was not deemed an AE because it was due to an error, due to a preexisting 
disease not clinicall y significant, a s ymptom of a new/worsened condition alread y recorded as an 
AE, or due to another issue that will be sp ecified, the investigator will record the justification on 
the source record.
8.2.2.2 Adverse Events
At each stud y visit, subjects will be questioned in a general way to ascertain if AEs have 
occurred since the previous visit (e.g., “Have you had an y health proble ms since y our last 
visit?”). Adverse events are collected from the time informed consent is signed. Refer to 
Appendix 3 for AE definitions, assessment, collection time frame, and reporting procedures. 
8.2.2.3 Vital Signs
Vital signs will be assessed pre -and post -infusion at each visit, if not stated otherwise:
Height (cm) and weight (kg).
Systolic/diastolic blood pressure (mmHg) baseline measurements will be measured after a 
10-minute rest in the supine/semi- recumbent position.
Pulse (beats/min) will be measured at the distal radial arteries under the same conditions as 
above.
Respiratory  rate (breaths/min) will be measured over a period of 1 minute under the same 
cond itions as above.
Body temperature (ºC or ºF) may be determined by oral, rectal, axillary, temporal, or 
tympanic measurement at the discretion of the investigator. However, the same method 
should be used for all measurements in 1 subject
.
Vital signs, excluding height and weight, will be measured at screening and within 5 minutes
before the 15 -minutes and 1 -hour PK sampling s, and within 30 minutes before all other PK 
samplings and at each study  visit, and at study  completion/termination. Blood pressure will be 
measured when subjects are in the supine/semi -recumbent position.
The investigator will assess whether a change from the Baseline Visit in vital signs may  be 
deemed clinicall y significant and whether the change should be considered and recorded as an 
AE. If assessed as an AE, the medical diagnosis (preferabl y), symptom, or sign, will be recorded 
on the AE eCRF. Additional tests and other evaluations required to establish the significance or 
etiology  of an abnormal value, or to monitor the course of an AE should be obtained when 
clinically  indicated. Any  abnormal value that persists should be followed at the discretion of the 
investigator.

8.2.2.4 Clinical Laboratory Tests
All clinical laboratory  tests will be performed according to the laboratory ’s standard proce dures. 
Reference ranges will be supplied by  the laboratory  and used to assess the results for clinical 
significance and out of range changes which may be associated with, or constitute, an AE. The 
investigator should assess out of range clinical laboratory values for clinical significance, 
indicating if the value(s) is/are not clinically  significant or clinicall y significant. Abnormal 
clinical laboratory  values, which are unexpected or not explained by  the subject’s clinical 
condition, may , at the discretio n of the investigator or sponsor, be repeated as soon as possible 
until confirmed, explained, or resolved.
A complete list of the clinical laboratory  tests to be performed is provided in Appendix 2 .
8.2.2.5 Pregnancy Test
A urine or serum pregnancy  test will be performed on all females of childbearing potential at the 
screening visit (Visit 1) and Baseline Visit; if pregnancy  is suspected; or o n withdrawal of the 
subject from the stud y.
8.2.3 Pharmacokinetics
Blood samples will be assessed to determine ADAMTS13 activity  and ADAMTS13 antigen 
according to Schedule of Assessment presented in Table 1as per the timepoints mentioned 
inTable 2. The actual date and time of dosing and of the blood samp le collection will be 
recorded in the subject’s eCRF. The details of blood sample collection, sample tube labeling, 
sample preparation, storage, and shipping procedures will be described in a separate laboratory  
manual.
8.2.4 Pharmacodynamics
PD effects will be assessed by  measuring VWF:Ag, VWF:RCo, and platelets, as specified in 
Table 2. The impact of plasma free hemoglobin and plasma thrombospondin levels will also be 
assessed. 
The actual date and time of the sample collection will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. 
Thedetails of blood sample collection, sample tube labeling, sample preparation, 
storage, andshipping procedures will be described in a separate laboratory  manual. The 
analytical methods used to measure these PD endpoints will be described in a separate 
bioana lytical report.
8.2.5 Additional Exploratory Biomarkers
Biomarkers of SCD severity  and additional PD readouts that may  be impacted by  SHP655 will

9.STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
9.1Statistical Analysis Process
The study  will be anal yzed by  the sponsor or its agent.
The statistical anal ysis plan (SAP) will provide the statistical methods and definitions for the 
analysis of the safety , pharmacokinetic, and pharmacody namic data, as well as describe the 
approaches to be taken for summarizing other study  information such as subject disposition, 
demographics and baseline characteristics, I P exposure, and both prior and concomitant 
medications. I t will also provide the preparation of tables, listings, and figure details.
The SAP will be finalized prior to final unblinding to pre serve the integrity  of the statistical 
analysis and study  conclusions. Data handling approaches, including imputation of missing 
values, will be provided in the SAP.
Data will be summarized by  dose level. The placebo group will be pooled for the presentati on.
All statistical analy ses will be performed using statistical analy sis sy stem (SAS) (SAS Institute, 
Cary , NC 27513) Version 9.4 or above.
9.2Planned Interim Analysis, Adaptive Design, and Data Escalation Committee
Although no formal DMC will be involved i n the management of this study, safet y will be 
monitored by  a Takeda Dose Escalation Committee. Please refer to Section 6.2.3.2 for more 
details.
9.3 Sample Size and Power Considerations
Four evaluable subjects (3 active:1 placebo) will be the first to be enrolled at the 40 IU/kg dose 
cohort in baseline health in order to obtain initial safet y and PK data. The number of subjects 
will be increased to 8 ev aluable per dose cohort (6 active:2 placebo) in the 80 and 160 IU/kg 
dose cohorts for more robust PK, PD, clinical and biomarker assessments. 
Sample size: 
40 IU/kg
(n=3)80 IU/kg
(n=6)160 IU/kg
(n=6)Placebo
(n=5)
Sample size is not selected by  a power calculation. I t is chosen to provide descriptive statistics 
for safety , tolerability , immunogenicit y and PK data following administration of SHP655.

Subjects may  be replaced at the same dose cohort for drop out prior to the Day 13 
immunogenicit y sampling.
9.4 Statistical Analysis Set(s)
Classification into all Analy sis Sets, except for PK and PD Anal ysis Sets, will be conducted prior 
to database lock. The PK and PD Anal ysis Sets will be concluded after database lock using final 
data from the database and final concentrations in accordance to the criteria specified below.
The Safety Analysis Set will consist of all subjects randomized and who received an y dose of IP.
The PK Analysis Set will contain all subjects who receive at least one complete dose of SHP655 
or placebo and provide at least 1 concentration measured at a scheduled time post start of 
infusion for at least 1 of the PK anal ytes and have no major protocol deviations or events that 
may affect the integrit y of the PK data. Subjects in this population w ill be used for all PK 
summaries.
The PD Analysis Set will contain all subjects who receive at least one complete dose of SHP655 
or placebo and provide at least 1 valid data point postdose of the respective infusion for at least 
1PD measurement for any of the PD outcome measures, and have no major protocol deviations 
or events that may  affect the integrit y of the PD data. Subjects in this population will be used for 
all PD summaries.
9.5Safety Analyses
All safet y anal yses (including the primary  anal ysis and e xploratory  anal yses) will be performed 
on the Safet y Anal ysis Set.
9.5.1 Primary Safety Endpoint
The safet y endpoints will include SAEs and AEs, adverse changes in vital signs and laboratory  
parameters, and incidence of binding and inhibitory antibodies to SHP65 5 occurring up to 
28±3 days after SHP655 infusion.
9.5.2 Statistical Analysis of Safety Parameters
Safety , including immunogenicity  data, will be assessed using descriptive summaries by  dose 
cohort appropriate for the measure (e.g., number and percent for catego rical measures and mean, 
standard deviation, quartiles, and range as appropriate for continuous measures).
For each measure, baseline is the last non -missing value reported prior to the first infusion of IP.

SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are defined as AEs that started or worsened in 
severit y on or after the infusion of IP. 
The number of events, incidence, and percentage of TEAEs will be calculated overall, by  system 
organ class, b y preferred term , and b y treatment cohort. Treatment- emergent adverse events will 
be further summarized by severit y and relationship to I P. Adverse events related to I P, AEs 
leading to withdrawal, SAEs, and deaths will be similarly  summarized/listed. AEs and SAEs will 
be tabulated and summarized according to the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities.
Individual and summary  vital signs and clinical laboratory  data will be presented in tabular form. 
For laboratory  safet y data, out of range values will be flagged in t he data listings and a list of 
clinically  significant abnormal values will be presented. 
The number and proportion of subjects will be summarized by  dose for incidence of binding and 
inhibitory  antibodies to SHP655.
9.6 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Ana lyses
The PK, PD, and PK/PD anal yses are described below. Additional details will be provided in the 
SAP.
9.6.1 Pharmacokinetic Analysis
Pharmacokinetic parameters for ADAMTS13 activity  and ADAMTS13: Ag following SHP655 
or placebo infusion will be derived using non-compartmental methods, including but not limited 
to, where applicable and estimable:
Incremental recovery
Observed maximum concentration (C
max)
Time to reach C max (tmax)
Terminal half -life (t 1/2)
Mean residence time from zero (predose) extrapolated to infinite time (MRT 0-inf) and 
from zero (predose) to 72 hours postdose (MRT
0-72)
Area under the concentration
-time curve from zero (predose) to time of last quantifiable 
concentration (AUC 0-last)
Area under the concentration
-time curve from zero (predose) to 72 hours postdose 
(AUC 0-72) and/or partial AUC over other time intervals may  be calculated as appropriate
Area under the concentration
-time curve from zero (predose) extrapolated to infinite time 
(AUC 0-inf)
For non-commercial use only
Takeda CONFIDENTIAL Page 59
recom binant ADAMTS13
SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
Systemic clearance (CL)
Volume of distribution at steady  state (V ss)
Weight measured at the PK Baseline Visit on the IP infusion day  will be used to calculate total 
dose. ADAMTS13 activity  and ADAMTS13:Ag in SHP655 dosing solutions will be used to 
derive actual dose amount for calculating IR, CL, and V ss.
Area under the curves will be calculated using linear up/log down trapezoidal summation.
For PK parameter calculations, should the measurement at pre -infusion of the respective PK 
infusion be above the lower limit of quantitation, baseline may  be subtr acted from post -infusion 
measurements, or used as a covariate as applicable if other anal ysis methods are employ ed.
PK concentrations and PK parameters will be listed and summarized b y treatment and dose 
cohorts (and b y scheduled time for PK concentrations). Individual and mean PK 
concentration -time profiles over time will be presented. Scatter plots of individual and geometric 
mean PK exposure parameters (C max, AUC 0-last, and AUC 0-inf) versus dose level will be presented 
for dose proportionality  assessment. Additional figures may  be generated as applicable.
9.6.2 Pharmacodynamic Analysis
The observed PD measurements of plasma VWF:Ag, VWF:RCo, plasma free hemoglobin, 
plasma thrombospondin, and platelet count will be listed and summarized by  treatment, dose 
level, and scheduled time. Ratio to baseline values will be calculated for VWF:Ag, VWF:RCo, 
and platelet count. Individual and mean PD profiles over time will be presented. The correlation 
of plasma free hemoglobin and thrombospondin with ADAMTS13 a ctivity  and VWF will be 
assessed.
9.6.3 Pharmacokinetic -Pharmacodynamic Relationship
The PK/PD assessments will be performed to evaluate the correlation of plasma free hemoglobin 
and thrombospondin with ADAMTS13 activity  and VWF.
Graphical assessments of plasma free hemoglobin and thrombospondin versus ADAMTS13 
activity  and VWF activity  will be generated.
Other assessments may  be performed to evaluate the PK/PD relationships.

Appendix 1.4 Data Management Considerations
Data Collection
The investigators’ authorized site personnel must enter the information required by  the study  
CRF Completion Guidelines or similar for all data requiring transcription of the source. A study  
monitor will visit each site in accordance with the monitoring pl an and review the CRF data 
against the source data for completeness and accuracy . Discrepancies between source data and 
data entered on the CRF will be addressed b y qualified site personnel. When a data discrepancy  
warrants correction, the correction will be made by  authorized site personnel. Data collection 
procedures will be discussed with the site at the site initiation visit and/or at the investigator’s 
meeting. 
Data Management
Data are to be reviewed and checked for omissions, errors, and values requi ring further 
clarification using computerized and manual procedures. Data queries requiring 
clarification areto be communicated to the site for resolution. Only  authorized personnel 
willmake corrections to the clinical database, and all corrections are d ocumented in an 
auditable manner.
Data Handling
Data that may  potentiall y unblind the treatment assignment (ie, investigational product serum 
concentrations, antibodies to SHP655, and investigational product preparation/accountability  
data) will be handled with special care during the data cleaning and review process. These 
data will be handled in such a way  that, prior to unblinding, any data that may  unblind study  
team personnel will be presented as blinded information or otherwise will not be made 
availa ble.If applicable, unblinded data may  be made available to quality  assurance 
representatives for the purposes of conducting independent drug audits. Following the review 
ofunblinded data for a completed dose cohort b y the DEC, and a recommendation by  the
DEC that it is safe to proceed with enrollment of the next dose cohort, Sponsor study  team 
willhave access to the unblinded data for the completed dose cohort, as specified in the 
unblinding plan .  
Appendix 1.5 Ethical Considerations

Appendix 3 Adverse Events: Definitions and Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, 
Follow -Up, and Reporting
Appendix 3.1 Adverse Event Definitions
Anadverse event (AE) is any  untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject 
administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily  have a causal relationship 
with this investigational product or medicinal product. An AE can ther efore be an y unfavorable 
and unintended sign (including a clinically  significant laboratory  finding), sy mptom, or disease 
temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not 
causality  is suspected (I CH Guidance E2A 1995).
Treatment -emergent Adverse Event
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an y event emerging or manifesting at 
or after the initiation of treatment with an investigational product or medicinal product or an y 
existing event that worsens in either intensity  or frequency  following exposure to the 
investigational product or medicinal product.
Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any  untoward clinical manifestation of signs, sy mptoms, or 
outcomes (whether considered related to investigational product or not and at any  dose):
Results in death
Is life -threatening. Note: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to 
an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not r efer 
to an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.
Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization. Note: Hospitalizations 
that are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled investigations proced ures or surgery  
for pre -existing conditions and have not worsened after initiation of treatment should not 
be classified as SAEs. 
For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be 
classified as an SAE; however, compli cation(s) resulting from a hospitalization for an 
elective or previously  scheduled surgery  that meet(s) serious criteria must be reported as 
SAE(s).
Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity
Results in a congenital abnormality /birth defect

SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
Is an important medical event. Note: I mportant medical events that may  not result in death, 
be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may  be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of 
such medical events include:
Bronchospasm associated with anaph ylaxis requiring intensive treatment in an emergency  
room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient 
hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
Reviewed and confirmed seroconversion for human immunodeficiency  virus (HIV), 
hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis E 
virus (HEV), or parvovirus B19 (B19V)
Unexpected Adverse Event
An unexpected adverse event is an AE whose nature, severity, specificit y, or outcome is not 
consistent with the term, representation, or description used in the Refere nce Safet y Information 
(RSI ). “Unexpected” also refers to the AEs that are mentioned in the IB as occurring with a class 
of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the product but are not 
specificall y mentioned as occurring with the particular product under investigation.
The expectedness of AEs will be determined b y the sponsor using the IB as the RSI . 
This determination will include considerations such as the number of AEs previously  observed, 
but not on the basis of what might be a nticipated form the pharmacological properties of a 
product.
Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
A Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) is defined as any  suspected 
adverse reaction to study  treatment (ie, including active comparators) that is both serious and 
unexpected. 
The event(s) must meet all of the following:
Suspected adverse reaction
Serious
Unexpected
Assessed as related to study  treatment

recom binant ADAMTS13
SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
Symptoms of the Disease under Study
Symptoms of the disease under study  should not be classed as AEs as long as they  are within the 
normal day -to-day fluctuation or expected disease progression and are part of the efficacy  or 
effectiveness data collected in the study . Significant worsening of s ymptoms should be recorded 
as an AE.
Whe n there is an increase in the severit y of a pre -existing condition, duration or frequency  of a 
preexisting condition, the event must be described on the AE CRF.
Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Assessment
A change in the value of a clinical laboratory  parameter, or vital sign measure can represent an 
AE if the change is clinically  relevant or if, during administration of investigational product, a 
shift of a parameter is observed from a value in the normative range to a value that is outside the 
normal range and considered clinically  significant, or a further waning of an alread y clinically  
significant value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference 
range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while cont inuing administration or 
after the end of administration with the investigational product, and the range of variation of the 
respective parameter within its reference range, should also be considered.
If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnorm al clinical laboratory  (such as hematology  
panel or clinical chemistry  panel), or vital sign values, which were not present at the 
pretreatment evaluation observed closest to the start of study  treatment, further investigations 
should be performed until the values return to within the reference range or until a plausible 
explanation (eg, concomitant disease or expected disease evolution) is found for the abnormal 
values.
The investigator should assess, based on the above criteria and the clinical conditio n of the 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory  value, or vital sign is clinically  significant and 
represents an AE.
Appendix 3.2 Collection of Adverse Events 
All AEs/SAEs are collected from the time the informed consent document is signed unt il the 
defined follow -up period stated in Section 8.1.3 . This includes events occurring during the 
screening phase of the study , regardless of whet her or not investigational product is 
administered. 
For non-commercial use only
Takeda CONFIDENTIAL Page 75
recom binant ADAMTS13
SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
All AEs/SAEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her baseline 
status or all variables have returned to baseline), regardless of whether the subject is still 
participatin g in the stud y. Closure indicates that an outcome is reached, stabilization achieved 
(the investigator does not expect any  further improvement or worsening of the event), or the 
event is otherwise explained.
Appendix 3.3 Assessment of Adverse Events
Severi ty Categorization
The severit y of AEs must be recorded during the course of the event including the start and stop 
dates for each change in severity. An event that changes in severity is captured as a new event. 
Worsening medical conditions, signs or sy mptoms present prior to initiation of investigational 
product, must be recorded as new AEs.
For example, if a subject reports mild intermittent dy spepsia prior to initiation of dosing with the 
investigational product, and the dy spepsia becomes severe and more frequent after first dose a 
new AE of severe d yspepsia (with the appropriate date of onset) should be documented in the 
source.
The medical assessment of severit y is determined by using the following definitions:
Mild: A ty pe of AE that is usually  transie nt and may  require only  minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally  interfere with usual activities of 
daily  living.
Moderate: A t ype of AE that is usually  alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. 
The event interfe res with usual activities of daily  living, causing discomfort but poses no 
significant or permanent risk of harm to the research subject.
Severe: A t ype of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or ma y require intensive therapeutic intervention.
Relationship Categorization
A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for 
each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, ther e is a 
reasonable possibility  that the event may  have been caused b y the investigational product. If 
there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not 
related”. Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting 
a possible cause -and-effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence 
of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”. The causality  assessment must be 
documented in the source.

SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
The following additional guidance may  be helpful:
Table A1 Adverse Event Relationship Categorization
Related The temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the 
investigational product is compelling enough and/or follows a known or suspected 
response pattern to that product, and the event cannot be explained by the subject’s 
medical condition, other therapies, or accident.
Not related The event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underlying 
medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or 
biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event.
Outcome Categorization
The outcome of AEs must be documented in the source during the course of the study . Outcomes 
are as follows:
Fatal
Not Recovered/Not Resolved
Recovered/Resolved
Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae
Recovering/Resolving
Unknown
If applicable, action taken (ie, dose increased, dose not changed, dose reduced, drug interrupted, 
drug withdrawn, no t applicable, or unknown) will also be recorded on the AE CRF.
Appendix 3.4 Safety Reporting
Reference Safety Information
The RSI  for this study  is the IB which the sponsor has provided under separate cover to all 
investigators.
Reporting Procedures
All initial and follow -up SAE reports must be reported by  the investigator to the Takeda Global 
Drug Safet y Department and the CRO/ Takeda medical monitor within 24 hours of becoming 
aware of the event. Note: The 24 -
hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply  to reports 
of abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors (see Appendix 3.9) unless they  result in an 
SAE.

The investigator must complete, sign, an d date the Takeda “Clinical Study  Adverse Event 
Form for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non -serious AEs as Required by  Protocol”, 
verify the accuracy  of the information recorded on the form with the corresponding source 
documents (Note: Source documents are not to be sent unless requested), and fax or e- mail 
theform to the Takeda Global Drug Safet y Department. A cop y of the Takeda Clinical Study  
Adverse Event Form for Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and Non- serious AEs as Required 
byProtocol (and any  applicable follow -up reports) must also be sent to the CRO/ Takeda 
medical monitor using the details specified in the emergency  contact information section of the 
protocol.
Appendix 3.5 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to investigational product) are collected from the time the 
subject signs the informed consent until the defined EOS Visit stated in Section 8.1.3 and must 
be reported to the Takeda Global Drug Safet y Department and the CRO/ Takeda medical monitor 
within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event.
In addition, any  SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by 
theinvestigator at an y interval after the stud y has completed must be reported to the Takeda 
Global Drug Safet y Department within 24 hours of the reported first becoming aware of the 
event.
Appendix 3.6 Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates
The onset date of the SAE is defined as the date the event meets serious criteria. The resolution 
date is the date the event no longer meets serious criteria, the date the s ymptoms resolve, or the 
event is considered chronic. I n the case of hospitalizatio ns, the hospital admission and discharge 
dates are considered the onset and resolution dates, respectivel y.
In addition, any  signs or sy mptoms reported b y the subject after signing the I CF or leading up to 
the onset date of the SAE, or following the resolution date of the SAE, must be recorded as an 
AE, if appropriate.
Appendix 3.7 Fatal Outcome
Any SAE that results in the subject’s death (eg, the SAE was noted as the primary  cause of 
death) must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recor ded as the resolution 
date. For all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s 
death, the outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded.

SHP655 -101 Protocol Amendment 2.0 (Global) 12 Jul 2021
For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any  ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another investigational product action was previously  taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, 
withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not 
changed” or “not a pplicable” (if the subject never received investigational product). The 
investigational product action of withdrawn should not be selected solel y as a result of the 
subject’s death.
Appendix 3.8 Pregnancy
All pregnancies are reported from the time informed consent is signed until the defined EOS 
Visit stated in Section 8.1.3 .
Any report of pregnancy  for any  female study  participant must be reported wi thin 24 hours to the 
Takeda Global Drug Safety  Department using the Takeda Investigational and Marketed Products 
Pregnancy  Report Form.
A cop y of the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form (and an y 
applicable follow -up reports) m ust also be sent to the CRO/ Takeda medical monitor using the 
details specified in the emergency contact information section of the protocol. The pregnant 
female stud y participant must be withdrawn from the study.
Every  effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy  outcome 
andcondition of the infant. I t is the responsibility  of the investigator to obtain this information 
within 30 calendar day s after the initial notification and approximately  30calendar day s 
post-partum.
Pregnanc y complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage, elective abortion or 
congenital abnormalit y are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Takeda Clinical 
Study  Serious Adverse Event and Non -serious AEs Required by  the Protocol Form.
A pregna ncy that occurs in the partner of a study  subject during the study must be reported and 
recorded on the appropriate CRF.
In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy  meets serious criteria, 
it must be reported as an SAE using the Takeda Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event and 
Non-serious AEs Required by  the Protocol Form as well as the Takeda Investigational and 
Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form. The test date of the first positive serum/urine -hCG 
test or ultrasound r esult will determine the pregnancy  onset date.

Appendix 3.9 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose and Medication Error
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined below) must be reported to the sponsor 
according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they result in an AE/SAE as described 
in Appendix 3.9.
Note: The 24
-hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of abuse, misuse, 
overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE.
The categories below are not mutually  exclusive; the event can meet more than one category .
Abuse – Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when used for a 
non-medical purpose (eg, to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner that 
may be detrimental to the individual and/or society
Misuse 
–Intentional use of investigational product other than as directed or indicated at 
any dose (Note: this includes a situation where the investigational product is not used as 
directed at the dose prescribed by  the protocol)
Overdose –Intentional or unintentional intake of a dose of investigational product higher 
than the protocol -prescribed dose
Medication Error –An e rror made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use of 
an investigational product. For studies, medication errors are reportable to the sponsor only  
as defined below.
Medication errors should be collected/reported for all products under invest igation.
The administration and/or use of the unassigned treatment is/are alway s reportable as a 
medication error.
The administration and/or use of an expired investigational product should be considered as a 
reportable medication error.
Appendix 3.10 Urge nt Safety Measures
An urgent safet y measure is an immediate action taken, which is not defined by the protocol, in 
order to protect subjects participating in a clinical study  from immediate harm, these do not 
constitute de facto deviation from the protocol . Urgent safet y measures may be taken b y the 
sponsor or clinical investigator, and may  include any  of the following:
Immediate change in study  design or stud y procedures
Temporary  or permanent halt of a given clinical study  or studies

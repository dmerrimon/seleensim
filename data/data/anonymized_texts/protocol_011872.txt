  applied QD for up to 6 months in pediatric subjects ≥9 years to ≤17  years of age with 
axillary  hyperhidrosis  previously enrolled in Study BBI -4000- CL-105.  
Following completion of the initial PK and safety study (Study BBI -4000- CL-105), 
subjects will be provided the opportunity to enter this 6- month open- label extension 
study. Subjects will be screened for eligibility at Day 8 of Study BBI -4000- CL-105 
(last PK sample collection under BBI -4000- CL-105 study).  Therefore,  for participating 
subjects, the final treatment vi sit (i.e., Day 8 /Visit 4 ) of Study BBI -4000- CL-105 and 
the Screening/Enrollment visit (i.e., Week 0 [Day 1 ]) of Study BBI -4000- CL-108 
(long-term extension study) will take place simultaneously.  
Subjects (parent/guardian) will be dispensed one contain er of sofpironium bromide gel, 
15% each month at Visits 1 -6. Subjects (and parent/guardian) will be instructed on the 
correct application procedure for sofpironium bromide gel, 15% ( to be applied QD 
before bedtime to both axilla for up to 24 weeks).  
Vital signs,  review of concomitant medications , assessme nt of AEs, completion of 
patient -reported outcomes ( HDSM -Ax or HDSM -Ax, Child , and PGI -S), and urine 
pregnancy tests (UPT) for all females will be done  each visit . Application site 
tolerability will be assessed a t all visits through the end of treatment (EOT)  at Week 24 
(Day 168) . Blood and urine for safety testing will be collected and analyzed at Week 4 
(Day 28)  and Week 24 (Day 168)  for routine hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis 
parameters. ECGs will be assessed at Week 0  (pre-dose, Day 1), Week 4  (Day 28) , and 
Week 24  (Day 168) . A PK sample will also be collected at Week 4  (Day 28) and at 
Week 24 (Day 168) . At Week 12 (Day 84) and at  the end of treatment Week 26 ( Day 
168), the subject will also complete the PGI -C. A final visit will be conducted 2 weeks 
after the last application of study drug . Clinically significant abnormal laboratory 
parameters , and abnormal ECG  noted at the previous visit, should be repeated  at this 
visit. Comfort measures (e.g., topi cal analgesics and mechanical interference devices) 
may be used during all study blood collection events to reduce subject discomfort.  
A total of 8 scheduled visits will take place over approximately 26 weeks : Week 0 (Day 
1), Week 4 (Day 28), Week 8 (Day 5 6), Week 12 (Day 84), Week 16 ( Day 1 12), Week 
20 (Day 140), Week 24 (Day 168), and Week 26 (Day 182) . Subjects who prematurely 
discontinue study drug will complete the EOT  (Week 24/Visit 7 ) visit.  
An internal Study Review Committee ( SRC) , comprising the Sponsor  Medical Monitor, 
Lead Investigator and Contract Research Organization ( CRO ) Medical Monitor, will 
facilitate the management and identification of potential safety concerns , will assess 
whether revisions to the study protocol and/or consent are requ ired, and will evaluate 
the overall progress of the study.   
Description of Test

Study Centers  Up to 10 investigational sites in the United States (US) who participate  in Study BBI -
4000 -CL-105 will be eligible to  participate in this study .  
Main Inclusion Criteria  For a study subject to be evaluated for study participation:  
1. Written Informed Consent (including HIPAA) will be obtained from the 
Parent(s)/Legal Guardian(s) prior to the conduct of any study related 
procedures to permit participation of a minor in a clinical research study in 
accordance with federal and local laws. Additionally, assent from a minor 
child will be obtained in accordance with federal and local laws as well as in 
compliance with the recommendations of the approving Institutional Review 
Board (IRB)/ Independent Ethics Committee ( IEC).  
Study subjects will be eligible for inclusion in the study if they meet all the following 
criteria at Screening/Enrollment ( Week 0  [Day 1 ]) as applicable:  
2. Are male or female ≥9 to ≤17 years of age at the time of consent.  
3. Have enrolled and completed treatment in Study BBI -4000- CL-105 and met 
all inclusion/exclusion criteria, were compliant with study procedures (e.g., 
visits and PK sample collection) , and did not experience any clinically 
significant AEs that wo uld preclude safe continuation of study drug for up to 
an additional 24 weeks . 
4. Continue to be in generally good health based on Investigator's assessment 
(other than axillary hyperhidrosis), with no clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities, co -morbi dities or psychiatric conditions which, in the opinion 
of the Investigator, would place the subject at increased risk or would 
confound the objectives of the study.  
5. The Parent(s)/Legal guardian(s) and study subject are willing and able to 
follow all study -related procedures, including but not limited to application of 
study drug and venipuncture and are willing and able to return to the study 
clinic for required study visits.  
6. If female, must be willing to take monthly pregnancy tests during the study .  
7. Sexually active females must agree to use a medically  acceptable method of 
contraception while receiving study drug. For purposes of this study, all 
female subjects are considered of childbearing potential as axillary 
hyperhidrosis generally occurs in post -pubescent individuals . Acceptable 
contraceptive methods include the following:  
a. Abstinence for the duration of the study or where partner is sterile 
(e.g., vasectomy) is an acceptable form of contraception.  
b. Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectabl e, or implantable 
methods started at least 2 months prior to screening, or  
c. Two forms of non- hormonal contraception, including intrauterine 
devices (IUD) (at least 1 -week status post placement) and  properly 
used barrier methods (e.g., male or female condoms , cervical 
cap/diaphragm, spermicidal agents, etc.).  
The Investigator will educate the subject regarding abstinence or contraception 
options and the correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods 
in order to successfully prevent pregnancy.

Confidential  1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background   
Sofpironium bromide (BBI -4000) is a novel soft -anticholinergic ester analog of 
glycopyrrolate in development for the topical treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis .  
1.2 Rationale   
The pediatric pharmacokinetic and safety study (BBI -4000 -CL-105) that precedes this long -
term safety extension study, is a short treatment duration (7 days [±1 day]) PK study. The 
purpose of this study is to collect additional safety and tolerability information on chi ldren 
and adolescents  following once daily sofpironium bromide gel, 15% treatment for up to 24 
wks. Furthermore, s ubjects  enrolled in Study BBI -4000- CL-105 may only begin to perceive 
improvement of symptoms near its conclusion. Therefore, s ubjects who complete Study BBI -
4000- CL-105 will be allowed the opportunity to participate in this long -term extension study 
(i.e., 24 weeks of treatment) in which they may potentially experience additional clinical 
benefit from sofpironium bromide gel, 15%. The data collected will further inform enhance 
the pediatric safety and tolerability  profile of the study drug.  
1.3 Risk / Benefit Assessment  
The results to date of the clinical program support the safe use of sofpironium bromide gel , 
15% for the treatment of primar y axillary hyperhidrosis. Ten clinical studies have been 
conducted with sofpironium bromide gel exposing over 700 adult  subjects to the active 
ingredient: two Phase 1 studies in healthy adults, four Phase 1 and three Phase 2 studies in 
adults with primary axillary hyperhidrosis, and a Phase 2 study in adults with primary palmar 
hyperhidrosis.  
Sofpironium bromide has consistently demonstrated low incidence of treatment -emergent 
adverse event s (TEAEs) following daily application for periods of time up to 6 w eeks.  Most 
AEs have been mild and transient, with all resolving after treatment discontinuation. A long -
term safety study  (BBI-4000- CL-303) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of sofpironium 
bromide gel, 15% in subjects ≥12 years of age has been initia ted and is ongoing at this time.  
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
3.1 Objectives  
3.1.1 Primary Objectives

Confidential  4 STUDY DESIGN 
4.1 General Description  
This multi- center, open -label ext ension study will evaluate the long -term safety, tolerability, 
and pharmacokinetics of sofpironium bromide gel, 15%, when applied QD for up to 6 
months in pediatric subjects ≥9 years to ≤17 years of age with axillary hyperhidrosis 
previously enrolled in St udy BBI -4000- CL-105.  
Following completion of the initial PK and safety study (Study BBI -4000 -CL-105), subjects 
will be provided the opportunity to enter this 6- month open- label extension study. Subjects 
will be screened for eligibility at Day 8 of Study B BI-4000- CL-105 (last PK sample 
collection under BBI -4000- CL-105 study). Therefore, for participating subjects, the final 
treatment visit (i.e., Day 8/Visit 4) of Study BBI -4000- CL-105 and the Screening/Enrollment 
visit (i.e., Week 0 [D ay 1]) of Study BBI -4000 -CL-108 (long- term extension study) will take 
place simultaneously.  
Subjects (parent/guardian) will be dispensed one container of sofpironium bromide gel, 15% 
each month at Visits 1 -6. Subjects (and parent/guardian) will be instructed on the correct 
application procedure for sofpironium bromide gel, 15% ( to be applied QD before bedtime to 
both axilla for up to 24 weeks).  
Vital signs, review of concomitant medications, assessment of AE s, completion of patient -
reported outcomes (HDSM -Ax or HDSM -Ax, Child, and PGI -S), and urine pregnancy tests 
(UPT) for all females will be done each visit. Application site tolerability will be assessed at 
all visits through the end of treatment (EOT) at Week 24 (Day 168 [ ±5 days ]). Blood and 
urine for safety testing will be collected and analyzed at Week 4 (Day 28  [±3 days ]) and 
Week 24 (Day 168 [ ±5 days ]) for routine hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis parameters. 
ECGs will be assessed at Week 0 (pre- dose, Day 1), Week 4 (Day 28 [ ±3 days ]), and Week 
24 (Day 168[  ±5 days ]). A PK sample will also be collected at Week 4 (Day 28 [±3 days ]) 
and at Week 24 (Day 168 [ ±5 days ]). At Week 12 (Day [ 84 ±5 days ]) and at the end of 
treatment at Week 2 4 (Day [1 62 ±5 days ]), the subject will also complete the PGI -C. A final 
visit will be conducted 2 weeks after the last application of study drug. Clinically significant 
abnormal laboratory parameters, and abnormal ECG noted at the previous visit, should be 
repeated at this vis it. Comfort measures (e.g., topical analgesics and mechanical interference 
devices) may be used during all study blood collection events to reduce subject discomfort.  
A total of 8 scheduled visits will take place over approximately 26 weeks: Week 0 (Day 1) , 
Week 4 (Day 28 [ ±3 days ]), Week 8 (Day 56 [ ±5 days ]), Week 12 (Day 84  [±5 days ]), Week 
16 (Day 112 [ ±5 days ]), Week 20 (Day 140 [ ±5 days ]), Week 24 (Day 168  [±5 days ]), and 
Week 26 (Day [ 182 ± 5 days ]). Subjects who prematurely discontinue study drug will 
complete the EOT ( Week 24/ Visit 7) visit.  
An internal Study Review Committee (SRC), comprising the Sponsor Medical Monitor, Lead 
Investigator and Contract Research Organization (CRO) Medical Monitor, will facilitate the 
management and identification of potential safety concerns, will assess whether revisions to 
the study protocol and/or consent are required, and will evaluate the overall progress of the 
study.

Confidential  5 STUDY SUBJECT  SELECTION  
5.1 Inclusion Criteria  
For a study subject to be evaluated for study participation:  
 Written Informed Consent (including HIPAA) will be obtained from the 
Parent(s)/Legal Guardian(s) prior to the conduct of any study related procedures to 
permit participation of a minor in a clin ical research study in accordance with federal 
and local laws. Additionally, assent from a minor child will be obtained in accordance 
with federal and local laws as well as in compliance with the recommendations of the 
approving Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Institutional Ethics Committee (EC).  
Study subjects will be eligible for inclusion in the study if they meet all the following criteria 
at Screening/Enrollment (Week 0  [Day 1 ]) as applicable:  
 Are male or female ≥9 to ≤17 years of age at the time of consent.  
 Have enrolled and completed treatment in Study BBI -4000 -CL-105 and met all 
inclusion/exclusion criteria, were compliant with study procedures (e.g., visits and PK 
sample collection) and did not experience any clinically significant AE s that would 
preclude safe continuation of study drug for up to an additional 24 weeks.  
 Continue to be in generally good health based on Investigator's assessment (other 
than axillary hyperhidrosis), with no clinically significant laboratory abnormalities, 
co-morbidities or psychiatric conditions which, in the opinion of the Investigator, 
would place the subject at increased risk or would confound the objectives of the 
study.  
 The Parent(s)/Legal guardian(s) and study subject are willing and able to follow all 
study -related procedures, including but not limited to application of study drug and 
venipuncture and are willing and able to return to the study clinic for required study 
visits.  
 If female, must be willing to take monthly pregnancy tests during the study.  
 Sexually  active females must agree to use a medically  acceptable method of 
contraception while receiving study drug. For purposes of this study, all female 
subjects are considered of childbearing potential as axillary hyperhidrosis generally 
occurs in post -pubesce nt individuals. Acceptable contraceptive methods include the 
following:  
a. Abstinence for the duration of the study or where partner is sterile (e.g., 
vasectomy) is an acceptable form of contraception. 
b. Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods 
started at least 2 months prior to screening, or  
c. Two forms of non- hormonal contraception, including intrauterine devices 
(IUD) (at least 1 -week status post placement) and properly used barrier 
methods (e.g., male or female condoms, cervical cap/diaphragm, spermicidal 
agents, etc.).  
The Investigator will educate the subject regarding abstinence or contraception options and 
the correct and consistent use of effective contraceptive methods in order to successfully 
prevent pregnancy .

6 DESCRIPTION OF S TUDY PROCEDURES  
A description of study procedures and frequency are listed in the SCHEDULE OF 
ACTIVITIES  and is provided within the content of this protocol .  
6.1  Obtaining Informed Consen t 
6.1.1 Written Parental/Legal Guardian Consent  
Adequate provisions must be made for soliciting the permission of t he subject’s parent(s) or 
legally authorized representative/guardian.  If a subject  turns 18 years of age during the 
course of the study, written informed consent will be obtained from the subject  at the next 
visit.  
The process for obtaining oral and/or written assent  for children and adolescents is similar to 
that of obtaining consent for adults. An effective informed consent process involves at 
minimum these elements:

Confidential  6.1.2 Minimum Federal Requirements for Consent  
The Institutional Review Board ( IRB)/Independent  Ethics Committee ( IEC) will determine 
the permissions (one or both parents/legal guardian(s)) required for participation of a minor 
in this study based on level of risk (e.g., minimal or greater than minimal) .  
6.1.3 When Parents/Legal G uardians Disagree  
If there are two parents /legal guardians  available to give permission but they disagree about 
allowing their child to participate in the study, the child may not be enrolled unless that 
disagreement can be resolved. This applies even if only one parent’s (guardian ’s) signature is 
required . When both parents (guardians) are involved in the decision, they must agree for the 
child to be enrolled. If a parent who was not involved or available for the original consent 
later becomes involved or available, the two parents (guardians) must then agree.  
6.1.4 Assent  
The Investigator should carefully consider and propose adequate provisions for obtaining 
assent of children and adolescents prior to their participating in research. In general , assent is 
usually obtained from a child ≥ 7 years of age, however the approving IRB/ IEC will 
determine  whether or how assent will be obtained. The child should be provided with 
essential information and asked if  they wish to participate in the research study.  
6.1.5 Documenting the Consent/Assent Process  
Consent/Assent MUST be obtained and documented PRIOR to initiation of any study 
procedure s. The Principal Investigator  or his/her approved designee must explain the nature 
of the study and associated risks to the parent(s)/legal guardian and study subject. The 
date/time that the informed consent is signed, a brief description of the consent/as sent 
process (e.g., questions asked by the subject), and the name of the individual who obtained 
consent will be recorded in the source record. A copy of the signed informed consent should 
be provided to the parent(s)/legal guardian. Depending on the approving IRB and local 
requirements, an assent form may be included as part of the consent and may or may not be 
required to be signed by the child. Investigators must adhere to their local requirements for 
proper documentation of consent/assent. A summary of assent procedures for execution of 
this study must be maintained in the Investigator Essential Regulatory File. It is the 
responsibility of the Principal Investigator  to ensure that any individual delegated the 
responsibility for obtaining consent/assent are familiar and adhere to the applicable 
consent/assent requirements . 
6.2 Demographics  
Subject  demographic information will be recorded at Screening /Enrollment ( Week 0 [ Day 
1]). Demographic information will include date of birth, gender  (at the time of birth) , race, 
and ethnicity. Findings will be documented in the source documentation and the eCRF.  
6.3 Histories

medication s and environmental) will also be recorded at screening. Findings will be 
documented in the source documentation and the eCRF. 
6.3.2 History – Hyperhidrosis  
The parent/guardian and subject will provide historical information pertaining to the 
diagnosis of axilla ry hyperhidrosis , including  date of diagnosis . 
6.3.3 Medication  History  
Medications taken within the last month ( 30 days) prior to first dose of sofpironium bromide 
gel, 15% under Study BBI -4000 -CL-105 and within 1 week prior to Sc reening /Enrollment 
(Week 0 [Day 1 ]) will be recorded in the source document and on the eCRF. Also refer to 
Section  6.13 c oncomitant m edications and restrictions for additional information. 
6.4 Abbreviated Physical Examination  
The abbreviated physical examination  will include an examination of general appearance, 
skin ( including  specific evaluation of axillary vaults ), lungs, and heart . Additional systems 
will be evaluated as needed.  Physical exam  findings  must be recorded  in the source 
documentation and include the date and name of the individual conducting the examination. 
Physical examinations must be performed by an individual licensed to conduct standard 
physical examinations.  An examination w ill be done  at every visit.  
6.5 Height and Weight  
Height and weight will be  collected at Baseline, prior to first dose , collected under BBI -
4000- CL-105, and will be carried over to the current study . 
6.6 Application Site Tolerability Assessment  
Application site  tolerability assessments  will be evaluated through assessment of symptoms 
at the drug -application site. These assessments are to be performed for each axilla 
individually. Subject assessments will be made prior to the Investigator assessments  
(Appendix F ).  
Subject Local Tolerability Assessments:  Subjects will be queried about whether any 
symptoms of burning, stinging, or itching occurred at the drug -application site within the 
previous 24 hours and further whether any  such symptoms persisted longer than 1 hour 
following study drug application. Standardized scales will be used to describe specifically the 
severity of any burning, stinging or itching  (Appendix F ).  
Investigator Local Tolerabi lity Assessments: Investigators will observe for the existence of 
any significant local symptoms of scaling or erythema at the drug -application site. 
Significant local symptoms are defined as those not ordinarily observed following 
application of a topical  product. Standardized scales will be used to describe specifically the 
severity of any erythema or scaling  (Appendix F ).  
Local tolerability signs and symptoms that result in the subject’s requiring a concomitant 
therapy, inte rruption of treatment, or discontinuation from the study, will also be  reported as 
an AE.

Confidential  6.7 Vital Signs   
Vital signs will be taken at every visit.  
6.7.1 Temperature and Respiratory Rate  
Temperature (oral or oral equivalent) and respiratory rate will be recorded once at each 
scheduled time point . Findings will be recorded in the source documentation and in the 
eCRF . 
6.7.2 Seated Blood Pressure and Heart Rate  
Blood pressure should always be measu red on the SAME arm (location should be 
documented) and with an appropriate ly sized (e.g., pediatric cuff)  blood pressure cuff (that 
should be the same size d cuff  throughout the study ) for accurate comparison of readings over 
time.  Position is critical for  accurate BP measurements. Therefore, w hen the BP is measured, 
the arm  (cuff) should be at the level of the heart . When seated, feet should be flat on the floor 
(if possible) with back supported and arm supported at the level of the heart (e.g., resting on a 
table). Blood pressure (systolic/diastolic) and HR  will be assessed after the study subject  has 
rested in a seated position for at least five (5) minutes.   
It is important that vital signs  be taken either before a meal , or at least 30 minutes after a 
meal or consuming caffeine  containing products . 
6.8 Twelve- Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
Investigative sites will use a calibrated ECG machine to obtained ECGs. The ECG paper 
speed will be set to 25 mm/second. Site personnel must assess the quality of the ECG whi le 
the subject is still at the investigative site in the event that an additional ECG needs to be 
performed (i.e., if artefact is present). Subject QT intervals will be reported as corrected for 
HR according to the Fridericia Formula (QTcF).   
TWO ORIGINAL IDENTI CAL ECGs should be printed (1 source and 1 for Sponsor) and 
labelled with Subject ID, and collection timepoint.  The Investigator will read, provide 
interpretation, and sign and date the source document ECG.  
For younger children who have difficulty l ying still, the parent/guardian (caregiver) should 
practice prior to the Day 1 study visit.  It is suggested that parents/guardians be instructed on 
the use of a timer to help the child understand how long to hold still. If possible, have the 
subject rest q uietly for at least 10 minutes.  
ECGs will be done at  Week 0 (Day 1)  [data to carry over from Day 8/Visit 4 of Study BBI -
4000- CL-105], Week 4 (Day 28 [ ±3 days ]), Week 24 (Day 168 [ ±5 days ]) and Week 26 (Day 
182 [ ±5 days ]), if abnormal at Week 24. 
6.9 Hyperhidr osis Disease Severity Measure- Axillary (HDSM -Ax) 
The HDSM -Ax (Appendix B ) was developed to determine the severity of excessive sweating 
in patients ≥12 years of age with primary axilla ry hyperhidrosis. The HDSM -Ax is a well -
developed, validated measure of patient -reported signs and symptoms that quantifies changes 
in symptom  severity in response to treatment ( Kirsch, 2018). A child version (refer to 
Appendix A ) suitabl e for use in children ≥9 to <12 years of age  (HDMX- Ax, Child) , will 
also be used in this study . The subject will be asked to complete the first 5 questions. 
Measure will be assessed at  Week 0 ( pre-dose Day 1), Week 4 (Day 28 [ ±3 days ]), Week 8

(Day 140 [ ±5 days ]), and Week 24 (Day 168 [ ±5 days ]) and Week 26 (Day 182 [ ±5 days ]).  
6.10 Patient Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S) 
All subjects will be asked to complete one question pertaining to the severity of underarm 
sweating over the pas t week (refer to Appendix A , No. 6 and Appendix B , No. 6). Measure 
will be assessed at  Week 0 (pre -dose Day 1), Week 4 (Day 28 [ ±3 days ]), Week 8 (Day 46 
[±5 days]), Week 12 (Day 84 [ ±5 days ]), Week 16 (Day  112 [± 5 days]) Week 20 (Day 140 
[±5 days]) , Week 24 (Day 168 [ ±5 days ]) and Week 26 (Day 182 [±5 days]) . 
6.11 Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI -C) 
All subjects will be asked to complete one question pertaining to  the overall change in 
undera rm sweating since the subject started the study drug  (refer to Appendix A , No. 7 and 
Appendix B , No. 7).  Measure will be assessed at Week 12 (Day 84 [ ±5 days ]) and the end of 
treatment , Week 24 (Day 168 [ ±5 days ]).  
6.12 Laboratory Testing 
6.12.1 Testing Facilities  
Blood samples for routine safety laboratory testing will be analyzed by a centralized 
laboratory that is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA).   
6.12.2 Sample Collection and Blood Volumes  
Blood samples will be collected via venipuncture . Measures should be taken to minimize 
discomfort during sample collection including but not limited to diversion or use of a  topical 
anesthetic (supplied) .  
Total blood volume (TBV) is related to body weight. The TBV of a child is approximately 
75-80 mL/kg. Existing guidelines for blood sample volume limits (ranging from 1 –5% of 
total blood volume within 24 hours and up to 10% of total blood volume over 8 weeks) are 
consistent with the limited evidence available on “minimal risk” to children  (Howie, 2011).  
In this study, t he smallest volume of blood possible will be collected for analysis of safety 
and PK. Blood samples are scheduled to be collected Week 4 (Day 28 [ ±3 days ]) and  Week 
24 (Day 168 [ ±5 days ]). Approximat ely 6 mL will be collected for safety , and approximately 
2 mL for PK at each collection time point.  Laboratory  tests may be repeated as clinically 
indicated at  Week 26 (Day 182 [ ±5 days ]).  
6.12.3 Sampl e Identification  
Blood samples will be labeled with the subject ID , sample collection date/time , and sample 
type.  The Sponsor will not have any information that would identify the study subject .  
6.12.4 Screening and Safety Laboratory Testing  
6.12.4.1 Pregnancy Test ing  
A pregnancy test is required for all female subjects . A U PT (local) will be done at all visits  
through Week 24 (Day 168 [ ±5 days ]). Testing will be performed utilizing CLIA waived 
methodology . Testing supplies will be provided by the Sponsor  to be used  locally at the site.

9 PROTOCOL VIOLATIONS  
A protocol violation occurs when the study subject , Investigator, or Sponsor  fails to adhere to 
significant protocol requirements affecting the inclusion, exclusion, study subject  safety and 
primary endpoint criteria. Protocol violations for this study inc lude, but are not limited to, the 
following:  
• Failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria  
• Dosing error  
Brickell Biotech, Inc.  21 September 2018  
Protocol BBI -4000- CL-108 Page 36 of 60 
 
Confidential  • Out of window blood sample collection or visit  
Failure to comply with GCP guidelines will also result in a protocol violation. The Sponsor 
will determine  if a protocol violation will result in withdrawal of a study subject or if data 
analysis will be censored.  
When a protocol violation occurs, it will be discussed with the Investigator , and the detail s 
will be documented and reviewed by the Sponsor represe ntative and the Investigator. A copy 
of such documentation will be filed in the site’s regulatory binder and in the Sponsor’s file s 
and may be reported to the IRB/IEC as applicable . 
10 ADVERSE EVENTS  
10.1 Safety Evaluations  
The Investigator is responsible for the appropriate medical care and the safety of subjects 
who have entered this study. Safety will be assessed by physical examinations, laboratory 
tests, and measurement of vital signs assessed as indicated throughout the study schedule. 
Clinically significant changes in these parameters may be captured as AEs . 
The Investigator must document any AE experienced by subjects who have entered this study 
and report all SAEs to the Sponsor (see  Section  10.3.1).  Contact information for the 
Sponsor’s medical monitor is provided on the protocol covering page.  
10.2 Adverse Events  
10.2.1 Definition of Adverse Event s 
According to the Code of Federal Regulations, 21 CFR Parts 312.32 and 320.32 (IND Safety 
Reporting, Applicability of requirements regarding an "Investigational New Drug 
Application"), FDA Guidance for Industry (Investigational New Drug Safety Reporting 
Requirements for Human Drug and Biological Products  and Safety Reporting Requirements 
for Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies in Humans) (Federal Register/Vol. 75, No. 
188/September 29, 2010) and ICH E2A (Clinical Safety and Data Management: Definitions 
and Standards for Expedited Reporting):  
• An AE means any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
• A suspected drug- related adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE.  
The f ollowing information should be considered when determining whether to classify a test 
result, medical condition, or other incident as an AE : 
• Adverse events will be recorded from the time of informed consent. 
• Abnormal laboratory values should not generally be recorded as an AE  unless an 
intervention is required, the laboratory abnormality is associated with clinical signs or 
symptoms, or the lab abnormality results in study termination or 
interruption/discontinuation of study treatment. When recording an AE  resulting from 
a laboratory abnormality, the resulting medical condition rather than the abnormality 
itself should be recorded (e.g., record “anemia” rather than “low hemoglobin”).  
Brickell Biotech, Inc.  21 September 2018  
Protocol BBI -4000- CL-108 Page 37 of 60 
 
Confidential  • Complications that occur in association with a protocol -mandated interventi on (e.g., 
invasive procedures such as biopsies) should be recorded as AEs.  
• Whenever possible, the Investigator should group signs or symptoms that constitute a 
single diagnosis under a single event term. For example, cough, rhinitis, and sneezing 
might be grouped together as “upper respiratory tract infection”. If possible, abnormal 
laboratory results that meet the definition of an AE  (see above) should be reported as a 
clinical diagnosis rather than the abnormal value itself (e.g., “anemia” rather than 
“decreased blood count”). 
10.2.2 Documentation and Monitoring Adverse Events  
All AEs encountered during the clinical trial following subject consent through the last study 
visit will be recorded on the appropriate Adverse Events case report form (eCRF).  
Special cons iderations:  
• Elective procedures or routinely scheduled treatments are not considered AEs. 
However, an untoward medical event occurring in association with a prescheduled 
elective procedure should be recorded as an AE.  
• A baseline condition is not considered an AE unless the condition worsens following 
study drug administration.  
• Death itself is not considered an AE; it is, instead, the outcome of an AE.  
• SAEs that are considered related (i.e., determined to be possibly, probably, or 
definitely related) to sofp ironium bromide by the Investigator or Sponsor should be 
followed until the event resolves or stabilizes (see Section 10.3.1).  
10.2.3 Assessment of Adverse Events  
For each  reported  AE, the start and resolution dates, intensity, seriousness (i.e., whether the 
event meets the definition of an SAE [ Section 10.3.1]) , relationship of the event to the study 
drug, action taken regarding study drug, and outcome of the event will be documented on the 
eCRF.  
Intensity  
The following definitions should be used to assess and grade AE intensity, including 
laboratory a bnormalities judged to be clinically significant.  
 
Severity  Grade  Description  
Mild  1 Awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated  
Moderate  2 Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activity  
Severe  3 Incapacitating with inability to work or do usual activity  
Note: a severe AE is not necessarily serious.  
Relationship  
The relationship of a  reported  AE to study drug should be assessed using the guidelines 
presented in the  following  table.  
 
Brickell Biotech, Inc.  21 September 2018  
Protocol BBI -4000- CL-108 Page 38 of 60 
 
Confidential  Degree of Certainty  Description  
Definitely Related  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; 
and that is confirmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage, and 
reappe arance of the event on repeated exposure (re -challenge).  
Probably Related  An event that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the 
test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; 
and that is conf irmed by improvement on stopping or reducing the dosage of the 
test article; and that is unlikely to have been caused by concurrent/underlying 
illness or other drugs, procedures, or other causes.  
Possibly Related  An event that follows a reasonable tempora l sequence from administration of the 
test article; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the test article; 
but may have been caused by concurrent/underlying illness, other drug, procedure, 
or other causes.  
Unlikely Related  An event that do es not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from administration 
of the test article; that does not follow a known or expected response pattern to the 
test article, or most likely was caused by concurrent/underlying illness, other drug, 
procedure, or other  causes, because of their known effects.  
Not related  An event almost certainly caused by concurrent/underlying illness, other drug, 
procedure, or other causes.  
 
Outcome  
Each AE will be characterized according to the outcomes described in the following table . 
 
Outcome  Description  
Recovered/Resolved  The subject has fully recovered from the event with no 
observable residual effects.  
Recovering/Resolving  The effects of the event are improving, or events have 
stabilized (are constant and not expected to improve or 
worsen) but have not returned to baseline.  
Not recovered/Not Resolved  The effects of the event are still present and changing. The 
event is not considered stabilized or resolved.  
Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae  The subject has fully recovered  from the event with some 
observable residual effects.  
Fatal  The event was the primary cause of death (may or may not 
be the immediate cause of death).  
Unknown  The event outcome is unknown.  
Death is an outcome of an event and not an event per se. Sudden death or death due to 
unexplainable cause(s) is to be reported, but follow -up will be pursued until cause of death is 
determined.  
Action Taken with Study Drug 
Action taken with study drug in relation to each AE will be characterized as follows:  
• None  
• Drug withdrawn  
• Drug interrupted  
• Unknown 
• Not applicable

Confidential  • Other (specify on e CRF)  
10.3 Serious Adverse Events  
Any AE that is serious (see definition below) and occurs after administration of study drug 
must be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of discovery  of the event. An event 
occurring after informed consent but before administration of study drug that is considered 
serious and possibly related to a protocol procedure must also be reported to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of discovery of the event.  
10.3.1 Definit ion and Reporting Procedures  
An AE should be classified as an SAE if it meets one of the following criteria . 
 
Fatal:  The AE resulted in death.  
Life Threatening:  The AE placed the patient at immediate risk of death. This classification 
does not apply to an AE that hypothetically might cause death if it were 
more severe.  
Hospitalization:  The AE required or prolonged an existing inpatient hospitalization. 
Hospitalizations for elective medical or surgical procedures or treatments 
planned before the signing of informed consent in the study or routine 
check -ups are not serious AEs by this criterion. Hospitalizations or 
prolonged hospitalizations for scheduled therapy need not be captured as 
SAEs.  
Disabling/Incapacitating:  Resulted in a substantial and permanent disruption of the patient’s ability 
to carry out activities of daily living.  
Congenital Anomaly or Birth 
Defect:  An adverse outcome in a child or fetus of a patient exposed to the study 
drug or study treatment regimen before conception or during pregnancy.  
Medically Significant:  The AE did not meet any of the above criteria but co uld have jeopardized 
the patient and might have required medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed above.  
Every SAE (regardless of suspected causality) should be reported to the Sponsor within 24 
hours of discovery of the event. The processes for reporting and documenting SAEs are 
provided in the study manual. Investigators are responsible for reporting these events to their 
IRB/IEC in accordance with federal and institutional laws and regulations. 
Additional updates from t he Investigator may be necessary as more information becomes 
available on the SAE, and all treatment -related SAEs will be followed until the acute event 
has resolved or stabilized, even if the subject discontinues study participation prior to the 
SAE resol ution. Any new information or follow -up information pertaining to previously 
reported SAEs will be reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of becoming aware of the new 
or follow -up information. The new or follow -up information should be faxed to the Sponsor 
at 1-866-666-7392 or emailed to safety@brickellbio.com . 
Any SAE that occurs after study completion and is considered by the Investigator to be 
related to sofpironium bromide, should be reported to the Sponsor . 
10.3.2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events to Regulatory Agencies  
The Sponsor will determine which SAEs qualify for expedited reporting to regulatory 
agencies. SAEs that qualify for expedited reporting will be submitted to regulatory agencies 
in accordance with ap plicable federal regulation s.  
Brickell Biotech, Inc.  21 September 2018  
Protocol BBI -4000- CL-108 Page 40 of 60 
 
Confidential  10.4 Follow -up of Adverse Events and Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
Adverse event  information will be collected during the clinical trial from the time the subject 
signs informed consent through the final study visit. SAEs that are  considered related to 
study drug by the Investigator or Sponsor should be followed until the events resolve or 
stabilize.  
10.5  Pregnancy Reporting  
10.5.1 Definition of Female of Childbearing Potential  
For purposes of this study, all female subjects are considered of  childbearing potential.  
10.5.2 Testing and Acceptable Methods of Birth Control  
Females must agree to periodic pregnancy testing and use a medically  acceptable method of 
contraception while receiving protocol -assigned study drug. Refer to Section 6.14.1 for 
additional information . 
10.5.3 Time Period for Collecting Pregnancy Information  
Females of child bearing potential should be instructed to contact the Investigator 
immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period). If 
a subject or Investigator suspects that a subject may be pregnant at any time during the study, 
the investigational product must be withheld until the results of laboratory pregnancy testing 
are available.  If pregnancy is confirmed, the subject must not receive or apply further 
investigational product and must be discontinued from the study.  
10.5.4 Action to be Taken if Pregnancy Occurs  
If following initiation of investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a trial 
subject was pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational product 
exposure, the Investigator must immediately notify the Medical Monitor of this event and 
record the pregnancy on the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form. The form will be sent 
to the Medical Monitor by fax to 1- 866-666-7392 or email at safety@brickellbio.com . The 
Investigator must notify the IRB of any pregnancy associated with the study therapy and 
keep careful source documentation of the event.  
Protocol -required procedures for those subjects that are discontinued from the study must be 
performed on the subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (e.g., x -ray studies). Other 
appropriate pregnancy  follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated, including 
counseling of the subject by the Investigator and her managing physician or health care 
provider (e.g., obstetrician). In addition, the Investigator must report to the Medical Monitor, 
on the appropriate pregnancy surveillance form(s), any follow -up information regarding the 
course of the pregnancy, including perinatal (period immediately before and after birth) and 
neonatal (infants up to 28 days after birth) outcome.  
Although pregnancy it self is not an AE, any complications during pregnancy should be 
recorded as AEs (or SAEs – if they fulfill the SAE criteria). Offspring will be followed for a 
minimum of eight weeks.  Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a subject 
exposed to the test article(s) will be recorded as a SAE and details documented in the 
pregnancy surveillance form. An abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic or spontaneous 
will be report ed as a SAE.

A sample size of t wenty -four (24) subjects is based on the maximum planned enrollment 
under Study BBI -4000- CL-105.  
11.2 Analysis Populations  
Two populations  will be used for analysi s: Safety and PK.  The definition of these two 
populations follows:   
• Safety  Population : All enrolled subjects who applied  at least one dose of study drug 
and have at least one post -baseline safety assessment . 
• Pharmacokinetic Population:  All enrolled subjects  who applied at least one dose of 
study drug and have at least one quantifiable PK sample for analysis.  
11.3  Statistical Analysis  
11.3.1 General Statistical Methodology  
• Baseline is defined as the last assessment prior to the first application  of study drug on 
Day 1  under Study BBI -4000- CL-105. 
• All statistical processing will be performed using Statistical Analysis System ( SAS®) 
unless otherwise stated . 
• Continuous data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (number of values, 
mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum). Categorical data will be 
summarized using frequency tables (frequencies and percent).  
• A SAP, describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate document. The 
SAP will be finalized prior to locking the database. The S AP will contain any 
modifications to the analysis plan presented below. 
11.3.2 Demographics , Baseline Characteristics, Medical History, Hyperhidrosis 
History , and Concomitant Medications

Confidential  11.4  Primary Analysis  
11.4.1 Safety  
Safety evaluations will consist of AEs, local application site tolerability, vital signs, 
laboratory measurements (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis , and pregnancy testing) , 
ECGs and physical examinations . Full details will be  specified in the SAP.  A general 
description of the planned analysis is as follows:  
• Adverse Events : 
o Adverse events will be descriptions will be mapped to standard terms, i.e., 
MedDRA System Organ Class and Preferred Term.  
o Adverse events that occurred duri ng the screening period will be listed 
separately and will not be included in the AE tabulations. 
o Adverse events that start on or after first dose will be considered a TEAE. At 
each post -baseline visit, the number and proportion of subjects reporting any 
given TEAE will be tabulated by severity; each subject will be counted only 
once according to the worst severity reported up to the current visit. Separate 
tables will be constructed for (a) all reported TEAEs, (b) protocol treatment 
related TEAEs, (c) seri ous TEAEs, and (d) TEAEs leading to protocol 
treatment discontinuation . 
• At each visit, local tolerability (burning, itching,  stinging, scaling , and erythema at 
either axilla) will be described by severity  as defined in  Appendix  F.  
• Vital signs will be summarized similarly as for laboratory parameters but without shift 
tables.  
• Laboratory parameters will be descriptively summarized (mean, SD, median, 
minimum, maximum) for values at each visit and for changes from baseline at each 
subsequent visit. In addition, at each post baseline visit, parameter status (low, normal, 
high) will also be summarized as shift tables vs. baseline status.  
• Descriptive statistics and/or frequency tables will be prepared as appropriate for 
physical examinations, and ECG (HR, RR, QTcF, PR, and QRS) parameters  
• Concomitant medications will be mapped  accord ing to the World Health Organization 
Drug Dictionary  and will be presented in data listings.  
11.4.2 Pharmacokinetics  
Plasma concentrations of sofpironium and BBI -4010, will be determined using validated 
liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry  (LC-MS/MS) analytical methods. 
The lower limit of quantification (LLQ) of the assay in plasma is 0.0555 ng/mL for both 
sofpironium and BBI -4010. Specifics of the analytical procedures  will be provided in 
separate bioanalytical documentation. 
Individual plasma C trough values of sofpironium and BBI -4010 will be summarized 
descriptively using the arithmetic mean, SD, CV (%), median, minimum and maximum. 
Mean (±SD) C trough values will also be presented graphically by week to assess exposure, 
accumulation and steady state  
Additional details regarding PK analysis will be provided in the SAP.

Summary Questions (No. 4 and No. 5) and PGI -S. Mean changes from baseline and 
observed valu es will be summarized by time point. The SAP will contain full details.  
• For HDSM -Ax and HDSM -Ax, Child, the mean of the items in S ection No. 1, No. 2, 
and No. 3 will be calculated for every subject at each time point. The mean will be 
derived by taking the  total score and dividing it by the number of questions answered. 
Subjects must answer ≥6 of the 11 sub- items to be evaluable for HDSM -Ax or 
HDSM -Ax, Child total score. Observed values and changes from baseline at each time 
point will be summarized and plo tted over time using descriptive statistics.  
• For the HDSM -Ax or HDSM -Ax, Child Summary Questions (No. 4 and No. 5), the 
score for each question, will be reported for every subject at every visit and 
summarized and plotted over time using descriptive statis tics.  
• For PGI -S, the score will be reported for every subject at every visit and summarized 
and plotted over time using descriptive statistics.  
• For PGI -C, the score will be reported for every subject at Week 12 and Week 24 
(EOT) and summarized and plotted over time using descriptive statistics.  
Missing data will not be imputed for any analyses.   
11.6 Interim  
No interim analyses are planned.  
12 DATA COLLECTION, RETENTION AND MONITORING  
12.1 Data Collection Instruments  
The Investigator will maintain adequate and accurate source documents designed to record 
all observations and other pertinent data for each study subject  treated with the test article . 
Study personnel at each site will enter data from source documents corr esponding to a study 
subject ’s visit into the protocol -specific electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) when the 
information corresponding to that visit is available.  
Study subjects  will not be identified by name in the study database or on any study 
documents  to be collected by the Sponsor (or designee)  but will be identified by a site 
number  and study subject  number.  
When changes or corrections are made in the eCRF, the EDC systems will maintain an audit 
trail of the person making the changes, the date and t ime of the change and the reason for the 
change. Only individuals listed on the Delegation of Responsibilities Log with responsibility 
for eCRF completion may make entries in the eCRFs.  
The Investigator is responsible for all information collected on study subject s enrolled in this 
study. All data collected during the course of this study must be reviewed and verified for 
completeness and accuracy by the Investigator.  Copies of final completed eCRFs will be 
provided on a compact disk or other similar media for archiving at the study site following 
database lock and at or prior to study closure.

Confidential  12.2 Data Management Procedures  
The data will be entered into a validated database.  The Data Management group will be 
responsible for data processing, in accordance with procedural documentation. Database lock 
will occur once quality assurance procedures have been completed.  All procedures for the 
handling and analysis of data will be conducted using good computing practices meeting 
FDA guidelines for the handling and analysis of data for clinical trials.  
12.2.1 Data Quality Control and Reporting 
After data have been entered into the study database, a system of computerized data 
validation checks will be implemen ted and applied to the database on a regular basis. Queries 
are entered, tracked, and resolved through the EDC system directly.  The study database will 
be updated in accordance with the resolved queries. All changes to the study database will be 
documented.  
12.2.2 Data Entry  
Data must be recorded using the EDC system as the study is in progress. All site personnel 
must log into the system using their secure user name and password in order to enter, review, 
or correct study data. These procedures must comply with T itle 21 of the Code of Federal 
Regulations (21 CFR Part 11) and other appropriate international regulations. All passwords 
will be strictly confidential.  Data should be entered onto the eCRF approximately no later 
than 72 hours after the visit has taken pl ace. 
12.2.3 Medical Information Coding  
For medical information, the following thesauri will be used: 
• Latest version of the  MedDRA for medical history and AEs; and 
• World Health Organization Drug Dictionary for prior and concomitant medications. 
12.2.4 Data Validation  
Validation checks programmed within the EDC system, as well as supplemental validation 
performed via review of the uploaded data, will be applied to the data in order to ensure 
accurate, consistent, and reliable data. Data identified as erroneous, or data that are missing, 
will be referred to the investigative site for resolution through data queries. The e CRFs must 
be reviewed and electronically signed by the Investigator who signed the protocol. 
12.3 Archival of Data 
The database is safeguarded against unautho rized access by established security procedures; 
appropriate backup copies of the database and related software files will be maintained.  
Databases  are backed up by the database administrator in conjunction with any updates or 
changes to the database.  At critical junctures of the protocol (e.g., production of interim 
reports and final reports), data for analysis is locked and cleaned per established procedures.  
12.4 Availability and Retention of Investigational Records  
The Investigator must make study data accessible to the monitor, other authorized 
representatives of the Sponsor (or designee), IRB/IEC, and Regulatory Agency (e.g., FDA) 
inspectors upon request. A file for each study subject  must be maintained that includes the

Confidential  signed Informed Consent, HIPAA Authorization and Assent Form and copies of all source 
documentation related to that study subject . The Investigator must ensure the reliability and 
availability of source documents from which the information on the e CRF was derived.  
All study documents ( patient and subject files, signed informed consent forms, copies of 
eCRFs, Study File Notebook, etc.) must be kept secured for a period of two years following 
marketing of the investigational product or for two years after centers have been notified that 
the IND has been discontinued. There may be other circumstances for which the Sponsor is 
required to maintain study records and, therefore, the Sponsor should be contacted prior to 
removing study records for any reason.  
12.5 Monitor ing 
Monitoring visits will be conducted by representatives of the Sponsor (or designee) 
according to the U.S. CFR Title 21 Parts 50, 56, and 312 and ICH Guidelines for GCP (E6 
(R2)).  By signing this protocol, the Investigator grants permission to the Spons or (or 
designee), and appropriate regulatory authorities to conduct on- site monitoring and/or 
auditing of all appropriate study documentation. 
12.6 Subject  Confidentiality  
In order to maintain study subject  confidentiality, only a site number, and subject  numbe r 
will identify all study subject s on e CRFs , blood samples, and other documentation submitted 
to the Sponsor. Additional study subject  confidentiality issues (if applicable) are covered in 
the Clinical Study Agreement. 
12.7 Retained Blood Samples  
Blood samples collected during the study for pharmacokinetic analysis may be retained for 
future testing as necessary. Study subject’s  confidentiality will be maintained and only the 
site and study subjec t number will identify the sample. No other linked or identifying 
information is maintained by the Sponsor.  
13 ADMINISTRATIVE, ETHICAL, REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
The study will be conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki, Protection of Human 
Subjects (21 CFR 50), Institutional Review Boards (21 CFR 56), and Obligations of Clinical 
Investigators (21 CFR 312 Subpart D).  
To maintain confidentiality, all laboratory specimens, evaluation forms, reports and other 
records will be identified by a coded number only.  All study records will be kept in a locked 
secured area. The Investigator must also comply with all applicable privacy regulations (e.g., 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, EU Data Protection Directive 
95/46/EC). 
13.1 Protocol Amendments  
Any amendment to the protocol will be written by  the S ponsor  or Sponsor designee . Protocol 
amendments cannot be implemented without prior written IRB/IEC approval except as 
necessary to eliminate immediate safety hazards to study subjects/ patients.  A protocol 
amendment intended to eliminate an apparent immediate hazard to study subjects/ patients 
may be implemented immediately, provided the IRBs are notified within five working days.

Confidential  13.2 Institutional Review Boards and Independent Ethics Committees  
The protocol and consent form s [parental consent and assent collect ively referred to as 
“con sent”] will be reviewed and approved by the IRB/IEC of each participating center prior 
to study initiation.  Serious adverse experiences regardless of causality will be reported to the 
IRB/IEC in accordance with the standard operati ng procedures and policies of the IRB/IEC, 
and the Investigator will keep the IRB/IEC informed as  to the progress of the study. The 
Investigator will obtain assurance of IRB/IEC compliance with regulations.  
Any documents that the IRB/IEC may need to fulfill its responsibilities (such as protocol,

Confidential  APPENDIX F  APPLICATION SITE TOLERABILITY ASSESSMENTS  
These assessments are to be performed for each axilla individually. The designation of 
“Right Axilla” or “Left Axilla” in the source documents and eCRFs refers to the subject’s 
right and left axilla respectively in all cases. Subject assessments are to be performed prior to 
Investigator assessment s. 
Local Tolerability (Subject):  As reported by the Subject to the Investigator, the severity of 
any symptoms of burning, stinging or itching at the application -site within the previous 24 
hours and further any such symptoms persisting longer than 1 hour f ollowing study drug 
application will be described specifically by severity using the following standardized scales:  
 
Score  Burning  Stinging  Itching  
0 = Absent  Normal, no discomfort  Normal, no discomfort  Normal, no discomfort  
1 = Minimal  An awareness, but no

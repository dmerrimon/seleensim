COMPOUND: SAR231893 STUDY No: EFC13691  
STUDY NAME: VENTURE  
TITLE A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of dupilumab in patients with severe steroid dependent asthma 
INVESTIGATOR/TRIAL LOCATION Worldwide 
PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT 3 
STUDY OBJECTIVE(S) 
 Primary objective 
x To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab compared with placebo, for 
reducing the use of maintenance oral corticosteroids (OCS) in patients with severe steroid-dependent asthma. 
Secondary objectives  
x To evaluate the safety and tolerability of dupilumab 
x To evaluate the effect of dupilumab in improving patient-reported 
outcomes (PROs) 
x To evaluate dupilumab systemic exposure and the incidence of 
treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (ADA) 
Exploratory objectives  
x To evaluate baseline and on-treatment levels of biomarkers in 
association with treatment response and for their potential to predict treatment responses  
x To evaluate patient genetic profiles and their potential to predict 
treatment responses 
x To evaluate the effect of dupilumab on airway markers of 
inflammation (at selected study sites within Canada) 
STUDY DESIGN General Design 
Multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
assessing the effect of dupilumab administered subcutaneously (SC) for a 
maximum of 24 weeks in patients with severe steroid-dependent asthma. 
Periods 
The clinical trial will be divided into the following periods: 
x Screening and OCS Optimization period (from 3 to up to 8 weeks 
[up to 10 weeks for patients experiencing an asthma exacerbation 
that requires a change in OCS dose to allow for 2 weeks of 
stabilization prior to randomization]): to determine a patient’s 
eligibility status and to ensure that patients enter the treatment 
period on the lowest dose of OCS that will manage their symptoms 
x Treatment period (24 weeks): includes a 4-week induction phase, a 
16-week OCS reduction phase, and a 4-week maintenance phase  
x Post-treatment period (12 weeks): to monitor a patient’s status after 
completing/withdrawing from study drug treatment for patients not 
rolling over into a long-term  study.

Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 4 Screening and OCS Optimization Period  
Patients who meet eligibility criteria at the Screening visit will enter the OCS 
Optimization Phase.  Prednisone or prednisolone will be the only OCS used.  During the Screening visit, patients currently using  other  OCS medications 
will be switched to either of these corticosteroids at a dose clinically 
equivalent  to their current stable OCS dose.  The definition of stable OCS 
maintenance dose in EFC13691 is no change of OCS dose within 4 weeks of 
Screening Visit 1.  
OCS optimization phase interruption criteria 
The lowest effective OCS dose
 will be defined during this phase as the lowest 
dose a patient can tolerate without experiencing any of the following criteria: 
x Increase in Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ)-5 of at least  0.5 
from the last ACQ-5 score recorded in the e-diary 
x Severe asthma exacerbation 
x Clinically significant event, based on investigator judgment that 
requires treatment by OCS dose adjustment 
In general, the investigator can refer to the ACQ-5 score at Screening Visit 1 
to guide the OCS dose adjustments made during the optimization phase of 
the study;  however, the decision to titrate can be based on the investigator’s 
clinical judgement.  Once determined, the optimized dose must remain stable for 2 consecutive weeks along with baseline medications without meeting any 
of the OCS optimization phase interruption criteria prior to randomization.  
Investigators should adjust the OCS dose according to a prespecified titration 
schedule based on the OCS optimization phase interruption criteria, and in 
accordance with their clinical judgement.  During the OCS optimization phase, 
the patient’s asthma control will be assessed weekly by reviewing these 
criteria via scheduled phone calls after Visit 2.  If the patient’s asthma status remains controlled and none of the above criteria are met, the investigator 
should down-titrate the patient’s OCS dose.  The downward titration will 
continue until a point when at least 1 of the OCS optimization phase 
interruption criteria is met.  If the down-titration is stopped,  the investigator 
should up-titrate the OCS dose by 1 step per Table 1,  unless the patient’s medical condition requires treatment with a higher dose of OCS.   
Those patients who are able to down titrate their OCS dose to 2.5 mg during 
the OCS Optimization phase without experiencing any of the above bulleted 
criteria will be considered screen failures and will not be randomized. 
If a patient experiences a severe asthma exacerbation during the OCS 
Optimization Phase, the exacerbation should be treated with the use of oral or 
parenteral steroids at least double the dose of current maintenance dose of OCS.  Following exacerbation treatment, the patient should be placed on the 
OCS dose 1 step higher than the dose they were on when the exacerbation 
occurred.  Note that the optimization period can be extended to 10 weeks to 
allow for 2 weeks of stabilization prior to randomization.

EFC13691 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 5 Induction Phase (4 weeks) 
At Visit 3 (Week 0), patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 600 mg loading dose followed by 300 mg once every 2 weeks (q2w) of dupilumab or matching placebo, respectively.  During 
this phase, patients will remain on their optimized dose of OCS along with 
their baseline asthma medications. 
OCS Reduction Phase (16 weeks) 
The OCS dose should be down-titrated during this phase following a 
predetermined schedule that is based upon the optimized OCS dose 
identified during the OCS Optimization Period.  Dose reductions may occur 
every 4 weeks which should allow the minimization of any carryover effects 
from the previous dose and reduce the risk for adrenal insufficiency.  The last 
possible dose reduction can occur at Week 20. No down-titration beyond this 
time point is permitted.  The reduction in OCS dose should occur per the 
schedule unless the patient meets defined criteria indicating that it is not acceptable for the patient to reduce the dose.  A clinical assessment should 
be completed prior to each dose reduction.  Primary reasons for not following 
the scheduled dose reduction include: 
x Mean morning peak expiratory flows (PEF) <70% of baseline 
stability limit 
x Forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV
1) 20% reduction from 
baseline stability limit 
x Rescue medication (metered dose inhaler) use requiring 4 or more 
puffs/day above the mean baseline value for any 2 consecutive 
days in the prior week, or 12 puffs or more on any 1 day in the prior 
week 
x Change in ACQ-5 score  +0.5 from the prior month OCS dose 
assessment 
x Clinically significant asthma exacerbation 
x Clinically significant event, based on investigator judgment, that 
requires treatment by OCS dose adjustment 
The Investigator will decide, depending on the reason for not reducing the 
OCS dose per schedule, whether to maintain or increase his /her current OCS 
dose by 1 step. 
Maintenance Phase (4 weeks) 
Patients will be maintained for the last 4 weeks of the treatment period on the 
same OCS dose established at Week 20.  However, when any of the above 
criteria for not reducing OCS dose is met, the Investigator should decide 
whether to maintain or increase the current OCS dose accordingly. 
If a severe asthma exacerbation occurs during the Reduction or Maintenance 
Phases, the exacerbation should be treated with the use of oral or parenteral 
steroids at a dose at least equivalent to double the dose of current 
maintenance dose of OCS.  Following resolution, the patient should be placed 
on the OCS dose 1 step higher than that which he/she was on when the exacerbation occurred for at least 4 weeks and continue with dose reductions

Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 6 (only during the Reduction phase) as per the predefined schedule at the 
following visit.  If a patient experiences 2 exacerbations, no further OCS dose 
reductions will be allowed. 
Post-treatment Period  
After completing the treatment period, patients who do not rollover into a long-
term study will be evaluated for 12 weeks in the post-treatment period.  
During this follow-up period, patients will continue treatment with their stable 
dose of controller medication (includes all medications used to control asthma symptoms, with the exception of the investigational medicinal product [IMP]) 
that can be modified based on their level of asthma control, as determined by 
the Investigator. 
During the post-treatment period, patients will continue to collect e-diary 
information that can be used to determine asthma control. 
Eligible patients completing the treatment period may have the opportunity to 
roll over into a long-term study with dupilumab.  Patients subsequently 
enrolled in this long-term study will not participate in the Post-treatment period 
of this trial. 
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and 
encouraged to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits.  In addition, 
patients who discontinue early from treatment or patients who choose not to roll over into a long-term study may be asked to return to the clinic to have 
additional ADA samples collected for analysis based on the overall 
assessment of antibody titers and clinical presentation.

STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 Sample size determination  
The sample size estimation is based on the comparison between dupilumab 
versus placebo in regards to the primary endpoint and the key secondary 
endpoint: percentage reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 compared with the baseline dose and proportion of patients achieving a reduction of 50% or 
greater in their OCS dose compared with baseline at Week 24, while 
maintaining asthma control.  For the primary endpoint, assuming a common 
standard deviation of 50%, with 90 randomized patients per group, the study 
will have 94% power to detect a treatment difference of 27% at the 2-tailed 
significance level of Į=0.05.  For the key secondary endpoint, with the same 
sample size of 90 randomized patients per group, the study will have 81% power to detect a difference in the proportion of patients achieving 50% or 
greater in their OCS dose of 33% in the placebo group, compared to 54% in 
the dupilumab group at the 2-tailed significance level of Į=0.05. 
Patients will be randomized using a 1:1 randomization ratio for dupilumab 
300mg q2w and placebo.  Randomization will be stratified by optimized OCS dose at Week 0 ( 10 mg/day, >10 mg/day) and country.  
Recruitment of patients whose eosinophil level is below 150 cells/ μL will stop 
when approximately 46 (25% of the total sample size) of such patients are 
randomized.  Recruitment will continue with patients whose eosinophil level is 
greater or equal to 150 cells/ μL until reaching the total sample size of 180.  In 
addition, the number of patients receiving 5 mg OCS at Visit 3 will be limited 
to approximately 54 patients (approximately 30% of the study population). 
Analysis population 
The analysis population for the efficacy endpoints will be the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population defined as all randomized patients.  The efficacy analyses 
will be conducted according to the treatment to which they are randomized. 
The analysis population for the safety endpoints will be the safety population 
defined as all patients exposed to study medication, regardless of the amount 
of treatment administered.  The safety analyses will be conducted according 
to the treatment patients actually received. 
Primary analysis 
The outcome of the percentage reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 compared 
with the baseline dose, while maintaining asthma control, will be calculated 
as: (optimized OCS dose – final OCS dose at Week 24)/optimized OCS dose 
× 100%.  The percentage reduction will be analyzed using an analysis of

EFC13691 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 12 covariance (ANCOVA) model.  The model will include the percentage 
reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 as the response variable, and treatment 
group, baseline eosinophil level subgroups (<150 cells/ μL and 150 cells/μL), 
optimized OCS dose at baseline, region as covariates.  Patients who 
permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged 
to return to the clinic for all remaining study visits and the Investigator will 
continue to prescribe OCS at the dose specified for OCS titration.  The off-
treatment OCS dose at Week 24 will be used in the primary analysis. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints  
The absolute reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 will be analyzed using an 
ANCOVA model in the same fashion as for the primary endpoint (percent 
reduction of OCS dose at Week 24). 
The proportion of patients achieving OCS reduction will be analyzed using a 
logistic regression model including treatment, baseline eosinophil level 
subgroups, optimized OCS dose at baseline, and region as covariates. 
The annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation events will be analyzed 
using a negative binomial regression model.  The model will include the total 
number of events occurring during the 24-week Randomized Treatment 
period as the response variable, with the treatment group, baseline eosinophil 
level subgroups, region, baseline optimized OCS dose strata, and number of severe exacerbation events prior to the study as covariates.  Log transformed 
treatment duration will be the offset variable.  For patients who permanently 
discontinue the treatment, the events which occurred up to Week 24 will be 
included and the last contact date will be used to calculate the offset variable.  
For patients lost to follow up prior to Week 24, events that occurred up to the 
last contact date will be analyzed, and the last contact date will be used to 
calculate the offset variable. 
Time to severe asthma exacerbation will be analyzed using a Cox regression 
model with time to event as the dependent variable, and treatment group, 
baseline eosinophil level subgroups, region, baseline optimized OCS dose 
strata, number of asthma events prior to the study, and region as covariates.  
The Kaplan-Meier method will be used to derive the proportion of patients with an asthma exacerbation event at Weeks 12 and 24 for each treatment 
group. 
The change from baseline in FEV
1 will be analyzed using a mixed-effect 
model with repeated measures (MMRM) approach.  The model will include 
change from baseline FEV 1 values up to Week 24 as response variables, and 
factors (fixed effects) for treatment, age, sex, height, baseline eosinophil level 
subgroups, region, baseline optimized OCS dose strata, visit, treatment 
by-visit interaction, baseline FEV 1 value, and baseline-by-visit interaction.  An 
unstructured correlation matrix will be used to model the within-patient errors.  
Parameters will be estimated using restricted maximum likelihood method 
with the Newton-Raphson algorithm.  Statistical inferences on treatment 
comparisons for the key secondary endpoint, percentage change from 
baseline in FEV 1 at each visit, will be derived from the mixed-effect model.  
The change from baseline for continuous endpoints will be analyzed using a 
MMRM in the same fashion as for the change in FEV 1.  Data up to Week 24 
will be included as response variables.  Age, sex, and height will be included 
as covariates in the models for spirometry parameters only. 
The safety variables, including AEs, laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECG 
and physical examinations will be summarized using descriptive statistics.

applicable for patients who plan to roll over into a long-term study and available chest imaging is over 1 year from rolling ov er into a long-term study. 
iPrior to screening, patients must be on a stable high-dose ICS (fluticasone propionate >500 μg total daily or equivalent) plus a second controller (LABA, LTRA, etc) for 1 month prior 
to  Visit 1.  Patients requiring a third controller are considered eligible for this study.  Patients should be on well-documen ted, regular prescribed treatment of maintenance systemic 
corticosteroids in the 6 months prior to Visit 1 and using a stable OCS dose for 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.  Patients must be ta king 5 to 35 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent at Visit 1. 
jInvestigational product administrations (q2w) must be separated by at least 11 days.  The randomized Treatment Period visits oc cur every 2 weeks up to Week 8 and then every 4 weeks, 
alternating with q2w home administration of IMP (patient, caregiver, or health care professional) without study visit up to the  end of treatment period at Week 24.  After Visit 7 (Week 8), if the 
patient or Investigator decides not to administer IMP at home, the IMP injections can be performed at the site by way of unsche duled visits.  Patients will be monitored at the study site for a 
minimum of 30 minutes after injections. 
kElectronic diary/PEF meter is used for daily recording of salbutamol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol use, ICS, LABA, L AMA, LTRA, and other controller use, OCS requirements, 
nocturnal awakenings, morning and evening asthma symptom scores, and AM and PM PEF.  The device is dispensed at Visit 1. The eD iary data must be reviewed on a weekly basis by the 
Investigator during the Optimization Period and prior to OCS dose reduction during the OCS Reduction Phase of the study, includ ing Visit 5. 
lDuring the OCS Optimization period, the ACQ-5 will be completed weekly in the patient’s electronic diary. During the Treatment and Post-treatment periods, the ACQ-7 will be performed at 
clinic visits and the ACQ-5 will be completed on a weekly basis for those weeks that the patient does not have a scheduled clin ic visit. 
mFeNO assessment is conducted prior to spirometry and following a fast of 1 hour. 
nVital signs, including blood pressure (mmHg), heart rate (beats per minute), respiratory rate (breaths per minute), body temper ature (degrees Celsius) and body weight (kg) will be measured 
at the Screening and Randomization visits (Visits 1, 2 and 3) and every subsequent visit.  Height (cm) will be measured at scre ening (Visit 1) only.  Vital signs will be measured in the sitting 
position using the same arm at each visit, and will be measured prior to receiving investigational product at the clinic visits . 
oOCS dose adjustments can be made during scheduled phone visits or scheduled in-clinic visits. 
pPatients who  do not meet the criteria for OCS reduction at Visit 5 may begin reduction at a later visit. 
qOCS titration during the OCS Optimization Phase can occur weekly following Visit 2 until the optimal OCS dose is determined and  every 4 weeks during the OCS Reduction Phase but is not 
necessarily required to occur during a scheduled in-clinic visit. 
rAt the EOT visit (Visit 11), the final OCS dose the patient is receiving needs to be documented; no adjustments to the OCS dose  will be permitted (except for those patients who experience an 
asthma exacerbation). 
sSerum pregnancy test at Visit 1 and urine pregnancy tests at other visits.  A negative result must be obtained at Visits 1 and 3 prior to randomization. 
tHematology: hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, total white blood cell count with 5-part differential count, and total red blood cell count. Serum chemistry: creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, 
glucose (only at Visits 3, 8,.and 11), HbA1c, uric acid, total cholesterol, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin (reflex tes ting will be triggered by elevated bilirubin), alanine aminotransferase, 
aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), bicarbonat e, and creatine phosphokinase.  Clinical laboratory testing at 
Visit 1 and Visit 10 (only for patients who planned roll over into a long-term study)  includes hepatitis screen (HBsAg, HBsAb,  IgM and IgG/total-HBcAb, and HCVAb), HIV screen (anti-HIV-1 
and anti-HIV-2 antibodies), and ANA. Patients who are IgG/Total-HBc Ab positive and  HBs Ag negative at Visit 1 must undergo HB V DNA testing prior to randomization to determine eligibility 
(only applicable for patients who plan to roll over into  a long term study).  Note: Anti-ds DNA antibody will be tested if ANA  is positive ( 1:160 titer).  At Visits 3 (randomization), 8, and 11, the 
blood sample should be taken with the patient in fasting state which means no intake of any food or drink except for water for at least 8 hours.  If the visit can only be done at a different time of 
the day and the patient is not fasting, then he/she should be advised to eat a light meal and the site should document that ser um chemistry was not obtained under fasting conditions. 
uUrine dipstick analysis, including specific gravity, pH, glucose, ketones, blood protein, nitrate, leukocyte esterase, urobilin ogen, and bilirubin. If any parameter on the dipstick is abnormal, a 
urine sample should be sent to the central laboratory for testing.  If positive for proteins, microscopic analysis will be perf ormed by central laboratory. 
vPharmacokinetic samples will be collected prior to dosing.   
wSystemic drug concentration and ADA samples are to be collected prior to dosing. In the event of any SAE or any adverse event o f special interest (AESI) of anaphylaxis or systemic allergic 
reaction related to IMP and requiring treatment, or severe injection site reaction lasting longer than 24 hours, samples will b e collected near the onset and resolution of the event for any 
additional analysis if required or for archival purposes. See Section  9.2.5  for more details.

yArchival serum will be collected for potential use in retrospective safety follow-up or additional biomarker analysis. Collecti on of archival serum is optional and requires the patient to sign 
consent.  
zOptional sampling for exploratory analysis of DNA and RNA, requiring separate pharmacogenetics informed consent. Blood for DNA can be collected any time during the study;  blood for RNA 
must be collected prior to any IMP administration. 
aaFor those patients with bilateral nasal polyposis/chronic rhinosinusitis. 
bbSputum and additional blood samples will be collected at selected Canadian sites as an optional assessment.  At Visits 3 and 11 , both sputum and blood will be collected.  At Visit 14, only a 
sputum sample will be collected (for patients who have not rolled over into a long-term study).  In addition, sputum collection  will be obtained when a patient experiences symptoms of an 
asthma exacerbation (collected during an unscheduled visit). 
ccAn optional assessment to be done in selected Canadian sites (only for patients with a FEV 170% of predicted).

4.1 INTRODUCTION 
Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by airway 
hyperresponsiveness, acute and chronic bronchoconstriction, airway edema, and mucus plugging.  The inflammatory component of asthma involves many cell types, including mast cells, eosinophils, T-lymphocytes, neutrophils, and epithelial cells and their biological products.  For most asthma patients, a reg imen of controller therapy and reliever therapy provides adequate 
long-term control.  However, it is estimated that 5% to 10% of asthma pa tients have symptomatic 
disease despite maximum recommended treatment w ith combinations of anti-inflammatory and 
bronchodilator drugs.  These patients account for up to 50% of the total health cost through hospital admissions, use of emergency services, and unscheduled physician visits ( 1). 
Although asthma is well controlled with inhaled therapy in most patients, approximately 10% of 
the patients have severe asthma that is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality.  
Severe asthma is a heterogene ous syndrome with multiple distin ct phenotypes based on several 
clinical, functional, and in flammatory parameters ( 2,3).  From a clinical perspective, severe 
asthma has been divided into 3 subgroups ( 1,4):  
xFrequent asthma exacerbations with relatively stable periods in between 
xAsthma with fixed airway obstruction 
xCorticosteroid-dependent asthma 
Corticosteroids are highly effectiv e in patients with severe asth ma; however, the regular use of 
systemic steroids can result in serious deleteri ous side effects affecting numerous body systems 
(eg, formation of cataracts, muscle weakening, central nervous system disorders, and osteoporosis) ( 5,6).  There is a clear need for safe cor ticosteroid sparing therapies for these 
patients. Current available options do not offer a po sitive benefit-risk ratio.  The consequences of 
unresponsiveness to therapy or lack of compliance with therapy is loss of asthma control and ultimately, asthma exacerbation. The poor response of some patients with asthma may reflect the number of cellular and molecular mechanisms operative in asthma. There is increasing interest in distinct phenotypes because targeted therapy is more likely to be successful in patients with 
similar underlying pathobiologic features ( 4). 
In a recently published trial involving 135 patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, treated with 
oral corticosteroids (OCS) for more than 6 months in addition to high dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in combination with a second controller, received mepolizumab (an anti-interleukin [IL]-5 monoclonal antibody) or placebo for 24 weeks.  Patients treated with mepolizumab were 2.4 times more likely to have a dose reduction in their OCS daily dose.  The median percentage reduction was 50% for the actively treated patients ( 7). 
Recent therapeutic approaches in asthma have b een focused on trying to control the T-helper 
cell-2 (Th-2) response.  Up-regulation of IL-4 and IL-13 activity has been implicated as an 45

Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 31 important inflammatory component of asthma disease progression.  Dupilumab is under 
development as a potential novel treatment for asthma.  Dupilumab, a fully human monoclonal antibody, is directed against the IL-4 receptor alpha subunit (IL-4R Į), which is a component of 
IL-4 receptors Type I and Type II, as well as the IL-13 receptor.  The binding of dupilumab to 
IL-4RĮ results in blockade of downstream signaling initiated by both IL-4 and IL-13.  Recently 
published clinical data from a Phase 2 clinical tr ial, demonstrated that dupilumab had a significant 
clinical effect in reducing asthma exacerbations , improving lung function and asthma control in 
patients with moderate to severe uncont rolled asthma in comparison with placebo ( 8).  For 
complete information regarding the preclinical an d clinical evaluation of dupilumab to date, see 
the Investigator’s Brochure. 
4.2 RATIONALE 
4.2.1 Rational for study design 
This Phase 3 study will investigate the efficacy and tolerability of dupilumab, in comparison with 
placebo, in reducing the use of OCS while maintaining asthma control in patients with severe 
refractory asthma.  The study will also investigate the effects of dupilumab on clinical markers of 
asthma control, including asthma exacerbation rate , quality of life, and lung function (eg, forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second [FEV 1]).  The study will enroll patie nts with severe asthma and 
well-documented, regular prescribed  treatment of maintenance syst emic corticosteroids  in the 
6 months prior to screening.  The clinical trial will be divided into 3 periods: 
xScreening and OCS optimization period (from 3 to up to 8 weeks [up to 10 weeks for those 
patients who experience an asthma exacerbati on that requires a change in OCS dose to 
allow for 2 weeks of stabilization prior to randomization]). 
xTreatment period (24 weeks): includes a 4-week induction phase, a 16-week OCS 
reduction phase, and a 4-week maintenance phase. 
xPost-treatment period (12 weeks): to monitor the patients’ status following completion of 
study drug treatment.  This period only applies for those patients not rolling over into a 
long-term  study. 
The presence of a placebo arm is appropriate for the objectives of this study, since it will provide 
the most robust assessment of the efficacy and safety of dupilumab while still providing patients access to standard of care. 
The OCS adjustments (increase or  decrease) during the Optimization phase and the length of the 
Optimization phase are deemed suitable because the patients have been managed on a stable dose of OCS for a significant period of time prior to the start of the study (as per by the inclusion 
criteria).  A similar optimization approach was successfully employed in 3 published OCS reduction studies ( 7,9,10). 
The proposed study design provides the opportunity to better understand the efficacy of 
dupilumab on multiple asthma domains including lung function, prevention of severe asthma exacerbations, and symptom control while reducing the dose of OCS over a period of 24 weeks.

EFC13691 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 32 4.2.2 Rationale for dose selection 
The dose regimen of subcutaneous (SC) dupilumab selected for this study is 300 mg every 
2 weeks (q2w).  All patients randomized to receive treatment with dupilumab will get an initial loading dose of 600 mg on Day 1.  The administration of the loading dose of dupilumab will allow systemic concentrations to reach steady-state faster, potentially reducing the time to onset of clinical effect.  
Proof of concept has been established in the ACT11457 study at 300 mg weekly.  One hundred 
and four patients with persistent, moderate-to-severe asthma and a blood eosinophil count of at 
least 300 cells/ PL or a sputum eosinophil level of at least 3%, partially controlled or uncontrolled 
by medium-to-high doses of ICS plus long-acting beta agonist (LABA; fluticasone/salmeterol, 
budesonide/formoterol, or mometasone/formoterol) were randomized to the study.  The study showed unprecedented efficacy in a population of mostly severe asthmatics with poor asthma control and decreased lung function inadequately controlled with mostly high doses of ICS in combination with a LABA. 
In addition, in the Phase 2b study DRI12544, 776 patients were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1 ratio to 
1 of 4 dupilumab regimens or placebo.  The doses tested were: 200 mg every 4 weeks (q4w), 
300 mg q4w, 200 mg q2w, 300 mg q2w, and placebo.  Patients on the 300 mg regimens received a 600 mg loading dose on Day 1, whereas those treated with 200 mg doses received a loading dose of 400 mg.  Study treatment was administered for 24 weeks.  A prespecified interim analysis, based upon all available data at that time, was performed when the last patient completed 12 weeks of treatment.  The assessment, change from baseline in FEV
1 at Week 12, was the final 
analysis of the primary endpoint.  The analysis of annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbation included all events that occurred during the treatment period, adjusted by the treatment duration.  At the time of this analysis, the average observed treatment duration was approximately 21.4 out of 24 weeks (approximately 89% of study information), with 70% of patient having completed 
24 weeks of treatment, and 30% of patients had completed the 16-week off-treatment follow-up.   
Compared with placebo, treatment with dupilumab demonstrated dose-dependent improvement in 
FEV
1 and reduction in the annualized severe asthma exacerbation rate.  In general, the q2w dosing 
regimens demonstrated greater efficacy than the q4w dosing regimen.  Both the 200 mg q2w and 300 mg q2w dose regimens demonstrated statistically significant improvements in FEV
1 and a 
significant reduction in the annualized rate of severe asthma exacerbations versus placebo in the overall intent-to-treat (ITT) population, patients with a baseline high eosinophil count ( 300 
cells/μL), and patients with a lower baseline blood eosinophil (<300 cells/ μL).  In contrast to the 
q2w regimen, the q4w dosing regimens demonstrated a consistently lower improvement in FEV
1 
from baseline compared with placebo than the q2w dosing regimens and the 200 mg q4w dose did 
not reach a statistically significant improvement in FEV 1 in all patients as well as those with high 
baseline blood eosinophils. Secondary efficacy analysis)on endpoints such as patient reported outcomes (Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 question version [ACQ-5] and Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire [AQLQ]) also support the superiority of the q2w regimens compared with the q4w dosing.  
Although the results of the Phase 2b study didn't show a clear differentiation between the 
2 biweekly regimens, modeling and simulation data suggest that the 300 mg q2w may exhibit 
(electronic 
Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 02  25-Jan-2017 
EFC13691 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 33 better clinical efficacy.  Because this trial will enroll patients with  greater asthma severity than 
those randomized in the Phase 2b and in the planned pivotal Phase 3 trial, the Sponsor prefers to optimize the chances for these patients for exhibiting the best clinical response to dupilumab.  For these reasons, the 300 mg q2w dose regimen has been selected for this trial. 
A population pharmacokinetic (PK) model prediction demonstrated that exposure in adolescents 
at the dose 300 mg q2w is not expected to exceed the observed adult exposure at the dupilumab dose regimen of 300 mg once weekly, which was observed to be generally well tolerated in adults. Therefore, adolescent dosing at 300 mg q2w regimen is expected to yield dupilumab exposure that is expected to result in efficacious exposures and unlikely to be associated with a heightened 
safety risk in this age population. 
Dupilumab has been safe and well- tolerated in all clini cal trials completed in healthy volunteers, 
patients with atopic dermatitis, na sal polyposis with chronic sinusitis, or asthma dosed for up to 
16 weeks with a maximum dose of 300 mg administered every week.  No important identified risks have been established during the dupilumab clinical program.  A low discontinuation rate 
has been observed across the completed clinical trials in dupilumab treated patients.  Furthermore, 
patients on placebo demonstrated a higher discontinuation rate in comparison to those on dupilumab.  The reported rate of suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) has also been low.  In addition, no imbalance in the frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) between patients treated with dupilumab versus those treated with placebo has been observed, with the exception of injection site reactions (ISRs).  In summary, the safety data observed so far in completed and currently ongo ing studies in patients with atopic dermatitis, 
asthma, or nasal polyps with chronic sinusitis ha ve demonstrated a very positive profile for 
dupilumab in comparison with placebo.

6.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROTOCOL 
This is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study assessing 
the effect of dupilumab administered SC for a maximum of 24 weeks in patients with severe 
steroid-dependent asthma.  Patients will be treated on an outpatie nt basis and will be stratified by 
optimized OCS dose at Week 0 ( 10 mg/day, >10 mg/day) and country. 
6.2 DURATION OF STUDY PARTICIPATION 
6.2.1 Duration of study participation for each patient 
Screening is from signed informed consent to randomization and the study observation period 
starts at randomization and lasts until the end of the study.   
The total duration of the study (per patient) is expected to be up to 44 weeks (or up to 46 weeks in 
patients who experience an asthma exacerbation th at requires a change in OCS dose to allow for 
2 weeks of stabilization prior to randomization) and consists of: 
xUp to 10 weeks for the Screening period/OCS Optimization phase 
x24 weeks for the Treatment period 
x12 weeks for the Post-treatme nt period (for patients not rolling over into a long-term 
study) 
Patients who discontinue early from treatment or patients who choose not to roll over into a 
long-term study may be asked to return to the c linic to have additional ADA samples collected for 
analysis based on the overall assessment of antibody titers and clinical presentation. 
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to 
return to the clinic for all remaining study visits. 
6.2.2 Determination of end of clinical trial (all patients) 
The last patient last visit will occur when the la st patient either comple tes the end-of-treatment 
(EOT) visit (Visit 11) and rolls over into long-term study, or at the end of the 12-week safety follow-up period if the patient co mpletes treatment and elects not to  roll over into long-term study 
or discontinues treatment early, or withdraws during the Post-treatment period for any reason, whichever occurs last.

6.4 STUDY COMMITTEES 
6.4.1 Data monitoring committee  
A data monitoring committee (DMC) is independent from the Sponsor and is commissioned for 
the dupilumab clinical development program.  This committee is comprised of externally-based 
individuals with expertise in the diseases under study, biostatistics, or clinical research.  The primary responsibilities of the DMC are to review and evaluate the safety data during the course of the trial and make appropriate recommendations regarding the conduct of the clinical trial to the Sponsor. 
The DMC procedures and safety data to be reviewed by the DMC are described in the DMC 
charter.  In the above capacities, the DMC is advisory to the Sponsor.  The Sponsor is responsible for promptly reviewing and for taking into account in a timely manner the recommendations of 
the DMC in terms of trial continuation with or without alterations or of potential trial termination. 
6.5 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN AND CHOICE OF CONTROL GROUPS 
The study design (including reductions in OCS dosing) and choice of a control group is based on 
similar optimization approach of studies that have been successfully employed in 3 published OCS reduction studies ( 7,9,10).

administer the IMP for the doses that are not scheduled to be given at the study site.  Patients who prefer to have the clinic staff administer study drug may choose to have injections administered in the clinic. 
If the study visit is not performed at the site as scheduled, the dose will be administered by the 
patient and/or their caregiver/health care professional, or arrangements must be made for an unscheduled visit at the site to administer the IM P.  When the IMP is administered at home, the 
patients must be advised by the site staff to self-monitor for potential signs and symptoms that 
may suggest a hypersensitivity reaction for at least 30 minutes after administration. 
If the patient, or caregiver does not develop the comfort to inject the investigational drug at home, 
or the Investigator determines that the patient (or caregiver) injection at home is not appropriate, 
injections can be performed at the site by way of unscheduled visits. 
Subcutaneous injection sites should be alternated among the 4 quadrants of the abdomen 
(avoiding navel and waist areas), the upper thighs or the upper arms, so that the same site is not injected twice consecutively.  Injection in the upper arms could be done only by a trained person (parent/ caregiver trained by Investigator or delegate) or health care professional but not the patient themselves.  This instruction pertains to th e day that the loading dose is injected as well as 
the administration of q2w injections.  For each injection, the anatomic site of administration will be recorded in the electronic case report form (e-CRF) and, as applicable, the home diary. 
Detailed instructions for transport, storage, preparation, and administration of the IMP are 
provided to the patient.  Patients will complete a Home Dosi ng Diary to document compliance 
with self-injection (or caregiver) injection of IMP. 
8.2 NONINVESTIGATIONAL MEDICINAL PRODUCTS 
Oral corticosteroids will be provide d by each investigational site. 
8.2.1 Inhaled corticosteroid with a second or third controller 
Prior to and during the Screening period, patients must be on a stable dose of high dose ICS with a 
second controller medication (LABA, LTRA, theophylline, etc).  Patients requiring a third controller for their asthma will be considered eligible for this study, and it should also be used for at least 3 months with a stable dose 1 month prior to Visit 1. 
During the Randomized Treatment period and Post-treatment peri od (for those patients not rolling 
over into a long-term study), patients will con tinue taking their c ontroller medication(s).

Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 44 The recognized controllers in this study will incl ude the following 5 classes: ICS, LABA, LAMA, 
anti-leukotrienes and methylxanthine. For examples of commonly used asthma controller therapies, refer to Appendix M  for a list of controller medications approved for this study. 
8.2.2 Oral corticosteroids 
During the course of the study, patie nts will receive variable doses of OCS 
(prednisone/prednisolone).  Predni sone/prednisolone use will be capt ured on a daily basis by the 
patient using an eDiary. 
8.2.2.1 Screening Period/Oral Corticosteroid Optimization Phase (Visits 1 and 2) 
Patients who meet eligibility criteria at the Scr eening visit will enter the OCS Optimization Phase.  
Prednisone or predniso lone will be the only OCS used.  At  the Screening visit (V1), patients 
currently using other forms of maintenance OCS w ill have their corticostero ids switched to either 
of these corticosteroids at a dose clinically equi valent to their current stable OCS maintenance 
dose.  The definition of stable OCS maintenance dose in EFC13691 is no change of OCS dose within 4 weeks of Screening Visit 1 
OCS optimization phase interruption criteria 
The lowest effective or optimized OCS dose
 will be defined during this phase as the lowest dose a 
patient can tolerate without experien cing any of the following criteria: 
xIncrease in ACQ-5 of 0.5 from the last ACQ-5 score recorded in the e-diary 
xSevere asthma exacerbation 
xClinically significant event, based on investigator judgment that requires treatment by 
OCS dose adjustment 
In general, the investigator can refer to the ACQ-5 score at Screening Visit 1 to guide the OCS 
dose adjustments made during the optimization phase of the study; however, the decision to titrate 
can be based on the investigator’s clinical ju dgement.  Once determined, the optimized dose must 
remain stable for 2 consecutive weeks along with baseline medications without meeting any of the OCS optimization phase interruption criteria in order to be eligible for randomization.   
Investigators should adjust the OCS dose according to a prespecified titration schedule ( Table 1 ) 
based on the OCS optimization phase in terruption criteria, and in acco rdance with their clinical 
judgement.  The decision rule of the titration sc hedule will be based on changes in the patient’s 
asthma control, assessed by the above criteria.  In the absence of a severe asthma exacerbation or 
a clinically significant event, the change in OCS dose should be guided directly by the ACQ-5 
score. 
A severe asthma exacerbation event during the study is defined as a deterioration of asthma 
requiring: 
xUse of systemic corticosteroids for 3 days (at least double the dose currently used
) and/or

Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 45 xHospitalization or emergency room (ER) visit because of asthma requiring intervention 
with a systemic corticosteroid treatment (at least double the dose currently used) 
No change in OCS dose will be made at Visit 1.  One week after the Screening visit (Visit 1), 
patients will return to the clinic for Visit 2.  At Visit 2, and weekly throughout the Optimization 
phase, patient stability will be assessed by the above outlined criteria.   
If at Visit 2, the patient’s asthma status remains controlled (ie, none of the above criteria are met), 
the Investigator should down titrate the patient’s OCS dose.  The downward titration will continue 
until a point when at least 1 of the OCS optimizati on phase interruption crite ria are met.  If the 
down-titration is stopped, the investigator should up-titrate the OCS dose by 1 step per Table 1 , 
unless the patient’s medical condition requires treatment with a higher dose of OCS. 
Deterioration is defined as an increase in the ACQ-5 score of 0.5 from the last ACQ-5 score 
recorded in the e-diary, the occurrence of a severe asthma exacerbation, or a clinically significant event, based on investigator judgment that requires treatment by OCS dose adjustment.  In these cases, the patient will return to the prior OCS dose at which none of the OCS optimization phase interruption criteria were met.   
If at Visit 2, or weekly thereafter, the patient's asthma status deteriorates as outlined above their 
OCS dose should be increased by 1 step ( Table 1 ).  In this manner, the Screening/OCS 
Optimization phase can range from 3 to 8 weeks until an optimized dose of OCS is achieved 
(Note: If an asthma exacerbation occurs that requires a change in OCS dose, this period can be extended up to 10 weeks to allow for 2 weeks of stabilization prior to randomization.)  
In cases where the stable OCS dose for 4 weeks prior to Visit 1 does not conform to a dose found 
on Table 1, the initial dose reduction should be the most conservative decrease that approximates the Table 1 protocol guidance.  As an example, 6 mg could be reduced to 5 mg and then per protocol to 2.5 mg thereafter, or 8 mg to 7.5 mg and then 5 mg, depending upon the individual patient and the investigator’s judgment.  In th e event of any uncertainty, the Investigator will 
discuss the therapy directly with the Sponsor prior to the first OCS dose reduction. 
Those patients who are able to down titrate their OCS dose to 2.5 mg during the OCS 
Optimization phase without meeting any of the above criteria, will be considered screen failures 
and will not be randomized.

exacerbation occurs, the OCS dose should be increased 1 step; however, no further OCS dose reductions will be allowed. 
8.2.3 Posttreatment/Follow-up Period 
During this follow-up period, patients will continue treatment with their stable dose of OCS.  The dose of OCS can be modified based on their level of asthma control, as determined by the Investigator. 
8.2.4 Reliever Medication 
Patients may administer albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol  metered dose inhaler 
(MDI) as reliever medication as needed during the study.  Nebulizer solutions may be used as an alternative delivery method. 
8.2.5 Treatment of severe asthma exacerbations 
Severe asthma exacerbations will be treated with the use of oral or parenteral corticosteroids at a dose at least equivalent to double the dose of current maintenance dose of OCS for a minimum of 3 days to a maximum of 7 days, this is to ensure that exacerbations are managed in a timely manner and consistently, when possible, for all patients participating in this study.  If the exacerbation is not resolved after 7 days, the tr eatment of the exacerbation may continue at the 
discretion of the Investigator. 
8.2.6 Treatment after the end of the study 
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that consideration has been given to the post study care of the patient’s medical condition.  
Patients who complete the 24-week treatment period, and return for the EOT visit at Week 24, 
may be eligible to roll over into a long-term study. 
At the end of the study, patients who do not roll over into a long-term study may be prescribed 
appropriate alternative as thma therapy if needed and as determined by the study Investigator. 
8.3 BLINDING PROCEDURES 
8.3.1 Methods of blinding 
Dupilumab and placebo will be pr ovided in identically matched 2 mL prefilled syringes.  To 
protect the blind, each treatment kit of 2 mL (dupilumab or placebo) glass prefilled syringe will be prepared such that the treatments (dupilumab or pl acebo) are identical and indistinguishable and 
will be labeled with a treatment kit number.  The randomized treatment kit number list will be generated by Sanofi.

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 02  25-Jan-2017 
EFC13691 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 49 Both the patient and the Investigator will be blinded to the assigned active drug or placebo.  Study 
patients, Investigators, and study site personnel will not have access to the randomization (treatment codes) except under circumstances described in Section  8.3.2 . 
Patients, Investigators, and site personnel will not have access to assay results for 
immunoglobulins (IgG, IgG subclasses, IgA, and IgM) after the first administration of IMP 
because these values have the potential for unblinding.  Furthermore, neither patients, investigators, nor site personnel will have access to eotaxin-3, antigen-specific IgE, thymus and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), or periostin while the study is ongoing or upon study completion, as the related data are not essential for patient care and have the potential for unblinding.   
The DMC will receive blinded results by treatment group or unblinded (if necessary) confidential 
reports from an independent statistician for review, which have to be handled  
  None of these reports can be delivered to unauthorized persons. 
8.3.2 Randomization code breaking during the study 
In case of an adverse event (AE), the code should only be broken in circumstances when knowledge of the IMP is required for treating the patient.  
Code breaking can be performed at any time by using the proper module of the interactive voice 
response system (IVRS)/interactive web response system (IWRS) and/or by calling any other phone number provided by the Sponsor for that purpose.  If the blind is broken, the Investigator 
should document the date, time of day, and reason for code breaking.   
Patient withdrawal will only occur when the code break  call is made at the s ite level, not the study 
level.  This means that if the emergency unblinding transaction is performed by the Investigator (ie, at the site level), then the patient will be withdrawn from treatme nt.  However, if the 
emergency unblinding transaction is performed by the Global Safety Officer (GSO; ie, at the study level, as the GSO is not site  based), then the patient will not  be withdrawn from treatment.  
At the facilities where the systemic drug co ncentration measurements, ADA, and selected 
biomarkers are determined, the sa mples will be analyzed prior to data base lock leading to 
unblinding of responsible bioanalysts.  Bioanalysts are excluded from the clinical trial team. 
8.4 METHOD OF ASSIGNING PATIENTS TO TREATMENT GROUP 
A randomized treatment kit number list will be generated centrally  by Sanofi.  The investigational 
product (dupilumab or placebo) will be packaged in accordance with this list.   
The Sanofi Clinical Supplies team will provide the randomized treatment kit number list and the 
Study Biostatistician will provide the randomization scheme to the centralized treatment allocation system.  This cent ralized treatment allocation syst em will generate the patient 
randomization list according to which it will allocate the treatments to the patients. 
Patients who meet the entry criteria will be randomized to receive either dupilumab or placebo.

Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 50 Patients who meet any exclusion criteria may be  rescreened once during the open enrollment of 
the study.  A different patient identification will be  issued for these patients.  Rescreening is not 
permitted if the patient fails to meet all inclusion criteria.  Th ere is no requirement for a waiting 
period between the screen-failure date and the re screening date.  The IVRS/IWRS report will flag 
rescreened patients.  Patients that are rescreened must sign a new consent form and all Visit 1 
procedures must be repeated. 
The Investigator obtains treatment kit numbers at randomization and subsequent scheduled visits 
via an IVRS/IWRS that will be available 24 hours a day. 
Patients will be randomized using a 1:1 randomization ratio for dupilumab 300 mg q2w and 
placebo q2w.  Randomization will be st ratified by the optimized OCS dose ( 10 mg/day and 
>10 mg/day) at Week 0 and country.  
Recruitment of patients whose eosinophil level is <150 cells/ μL will stop when approximately 46 
(25% of the total sample size) of such patients are randomized.  Recruitment will continue with 
patients whose eosinophil level is 150 cells/ μL until reaching the total sample size of 180.  In 
addition, the number of patients receiving 5 mg OCS at Visit 3 will be limited to approximately 
54 patients (approximately 30% of the study population). 
A randomized patient is defined as a patient who is registered and assigned with a treatment kit 
number from the centralized treatment allocation system, as documented from its log file.  A 
patient cannot be randomized more than once in the study. 
8.5 PACKAGING AND LABELING 
Dupilumab and placebo will be supplied as 1 glass prefilled syringe packed in a patient kit box.  Both glass prefilled syring e and box will be labeled. 
Packaging is in accordance with the administratio n schedule.  The content of the labeling is in 
accordance with the local regulatory specifications and requirements. 
8.6 STORAGE CONDITIONS AND SHELF LIFE 
All investigational products should be stored at a temperature between 2°C and 8°C in an appropriate, locked room under the responsibility of the Investigator or other authorized persons (eg, pharmacists) in accordance with local regulations, policies, and procedures. 
Control of investigational product storage conditions, especially control of temperature (eg, 
refrigerated storage), information on in-use stabilit y, and instructions for handling the Sanofi 
compound should be managed according to the rules provided by the Sponsor.

The Investigator, the hospital pharmacist, or other personnel allowed to store and dispense the 
IMP will be responsible for ensuring that the IMP used in the clinical trial is securely maintained as specified by the Sponsor and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
All IMPs will be dispensed in accordance with the Investigator's prescription and it is the 
Investigator's responsibility to ensure that an accurate record of IMP issued and returned is maintained. 
Any quality issue noticed with the receipt or use of an IMP (deficiency in condition, appearance, 
pertaining documentation, labeling, expiration date, etc) should be promptly notified to the 
Sponsor.  Some deficiencies may be recorded through a complaint procedure. 
A potential defect in the quality of IMP may be pa tient to initiation of a recall procedure by the 
Sponsor.  In this case, the Investigator will be responsible for promptly addressing any request made by the Sponsor, in order to recall IMP and eliminate potential hazards. 
Under no circumstances will the Investigator supply IMP to a third party, allow the IMP to be 
used other than as directed by this clinical trial protocol, or dispose of IMP in any other manner. 
8.7.1 Treatment accountability and compliance 
Measures taken to ensure and document treatment compliance and accountability include: 
xProper recording of treatment kit number as required on the appropriate e-CRF page for 
accounting purposes. 
xAll medication treatment kits  (whether empty or unused) are returned by the patient at 
each visit when a treatment dispensing is planned. 
- The completed patient injection diary (retur ned to the site at each visit), returned 
treatment kit boxes, and any unused prefilled syringes will be used for drug accountability purposes. 
xThe Investigator or designee tr acks treatment accountability/co mpliance, either by diary, 
or by counting the number of used treatment kits, and provides this information in the 
treatment log. 
xPatients will record IMP dosin g self-administered through the use of a Home Dosing 
Diary.  Site personnel will review the diary at each clinic visit and follow up with the 
patient accordingly. 
xPrednisone/prednisolone use w ill be captured on a daily basis by the patient (or caregiver) 
through the use of a daily eDiary.  The Investig ator or designee will review the eDiary at 
each clinic visit and follow up with the patient accordingly. 
The monitor in charge of the study then checks the data entered on the IMP administration page 
by comparing them with the IMP that has been  retrieved and the patie nt treatment log form.

8.7.2 Return and/or destruction of treatments 
All partially used or unused treatment kits will be retrieved by the Sponsor or destroyed at study site.  All used prefilled syringes should be kept in a sharps container by the patients and be returned to sites for destroy.  A detailed treatment log of the returned IMP will be established with 
the Investigator (or the pharmacist) and countersigned by the Investigator and the monitoring team.  The Investigator will not destroy the unused IMP unless the Sponsor provides written authorization. 
8.8 CONCOMITANT MEDICATION 
A concomitant medication is any treatment received by the patient concomitantly to any IMP(s).  All concomitant medications take n during the study will be recorded in the eCRF, including the 
drug name and the dates of administration. 
The following concomitant treatments are not permitted during the Screening Period or the 
Randomized Treatment period: 
xAnti-immunoglobulin E (IgE) therapy (eg, omalizumab)  
xOther biologic therapies such as mepolizumab, benralizumab, anti-TNF, anti-IL-17, or 
other intravenous Ig therapies 
xSystemic immunosuppressant  
xBronchial thermoplasty  
xBeta-adrenergic receptor blockers (beta-blockers)  
xInvestigational drugs  
xLive/attenuated vaccines: refer to Appendix B   
xAsthma relievers other than salbutamol/albuter ol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol: their use 
is not recommended during the study period. In case of use in exceptional circumstances 
(eg, prescribed by a physicia n not participating in the stud y), their use will be documented 
in the patient's file and reported in the eCRF. 
Of note, the following me dications will be permitted

The impact of dupilumab on cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme activity has not been studied and 
the effect of dupilumab on levels of IL-4 and IL-13 has not been fully characterized.  However, IL-4 was reported to upregulate CYP2E1, 2B6, 3A4 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) 
expression or down regulate CYP1A2 mRNA in human hepatocyte or human peripheral blood 
mononuclear cell culture ( 11,12).  Human peripheral blood mononuclear cells incubated with 
various Th-2 cytokines showed that IL-13 increased mRNA expression of CYP2B6 and CYP3A4 (13).  Since the clinical significance of th e limited in vitro findings for IL-4 and IL-13 
involvement in CYP regulation and the impact of dupilumab on CYP enzymes is not fully understood, during the study treatment and at least up to the end of follow-up, caution should be used for drugs which are metabolized via these CYP isoforms and which have a narrow therapeutic index.  This means that close c linical observation and/or laboratory monitoring as 
applicable are required in order to enable early detection of toxic manifestations or lack of activity/efficacy of these drugs, followed by dose adjustment or their withdrawal if needed 
(11,12,13 ).  Some examples of CYP450 substrates with narrow therapeutic index are provided in

9.1 PRIMARY ENDPOINT 
9.1.1 Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the percentage reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 
compared with the baseline dose,  while maintaining asthma cont rol.  The percent reduction in 
OCS dose will be calculated as: (optimized OCS do se – final OCS dose at Week 24)/optimized 
OCS dose × 100.  A patient will be considered as having maintained asthma control between 
Week 20 and Week 24 if he/she does not have a clinically significant event, based on investigator 
judgment that requires treatment by OCS dose adjustment during this period.  For those patients who experience an exacerbation, the final OCS dose will be considered to be 1 step higher than the dose they were receiving at the time of the exacerbation.  Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked an d encouraged to return to the clinic for all 
remaining study visits and the Investigator will continue to prescribe OCS at the dose specified 
for OCS titration.  The off-treatment OCS dose at Week 24 will be used in the primary analysis. 
9.1.1.1 Oral corticosteroid dose adjustments 
The dose adjustment of OCS through the OCS Re duction phase of the stud y will be based on the 
following: 
xAsthma symptom data collected through the eDiary (ACQ-5 score) 
xClinically significant asthma exacerbation(s) 
xMean morning PEF <70% of baseline stability limit as assessed in the week prior to the 
clinical visit 
xFEV 1 20% reduction from baseline stability limit 
xRescue medication use requiring 4 or more puffs/day above the mean baseline value for 
any 2 consecutive days in the prior week, or 12 puffs on any 1 day in the week prior to 
the clinical visit 
xClinically significant event, based on Investigator judgment that requires treatment by 
OCS dose adjustment 
The patient will complete the ACQ-5 on a weekly  basis and record the score in the eDiary 
(starting with Visit 1 onwards).  The Investigat or will review the eDiary data on a weekly basis 
during the OCS Optimization phase and monthly during the Randomized Treatment period. 
Daily OCS dose will be recorded using the eDiary.

9.2.1 Secondary efficacy endpoints related to adjustments in oral corticosteroid dosing 
The key secondary endpoint is: 
xProportion of patients achieving a reduction of 50% or greater in their OCS dose compared 
with baseline at Week 24 while maintaining asthma control.  The relative reduction for 
each patient will be calculated as (optimized OCS dose – final OCS dose at 
Week 24)/optimized OCS dose × 100. 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints include: 
xAbsolute reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 compared with the baseline dose while 
maintaining asthma control 
xProportion of patients achieving a reduction of OCS dose to <5 mg/day at Week 24 while 
maintaining asthma control 
xProportion of patients no longer requiring OCS at Week 24 while maintaining asthma 
control 
xProportion of patients achieving their maximum possible reduction of OCS dose per 
protocol at Week 24 while maintaining asthma control.

For safety reasons, alerts will be  programmed into the eDiary that  will notify both the patient and 
the site to monitor the clinical situation closely in  case the patient’s asthma worsens.  However, an 
alert in itself will not be classified as a clinically significant asthma exacerbation.

dose of LABA for at least 12 hours and withholding the last dose of LAMA for at least 24 hours. 
For post-bronchodilator FEV 1, the measure should follow the steps described for reversibility 
validation. 
At all visits, spirometry should be performed in the morning if possible, but if the test can only be 
done at a different time of the day, the testing should be done at approximately the same time of the day at each visit throughout the study.  The same spirometer and standard spirometric techniques, including calibration, will be used to perform spirometry at all visits and, whenever possible, the same person should perform the measurements.  Please refer to the Operational Manual for additional information. 
Pulmonary function tests will be measured in the sitting position; however, if necessary to 
undertake the testing with the patient standing or in another position, this should be noted on the spirometry report.  For any patient, the position should be consistent throughout the study. 
Three measurements fulfilling the ATS acceptability and repeatability criteria should be obtained 
at every visit, if possible.  The acceptability criteria must be applied before the repeatability 
criteria.  Unacceptable maneuvers must be discarde d before applying the repeatability criteria.  If 
a patient fails to provide repeatable and/or acceptable maneuvers, an explanation should be documented.   
The largest FEV
1 and largest FVC should be recorded after the data are examined from all of the 
acceptable curves, even if they do not come from the same curve.  The FEF 25-75%  should be 
obtained from the single curve that meets the ac ceptability criteria and gives the largest sum of 
FVC plus FEV 1 (best performance). 
Automated best efforts, which combine FEV 1 and FVC are not acceptable. 
The spirometer must be calibrated following the principles of the ATS/ERS guidelines every day 
that a study patient is seen and spirometry is carried out.  The calibration records should be kept in 
a reviewable log.  It is preferred that the calibra tion equipment (ie, 3-liter syringe) that is used to 
calibrate the spirometer be subjected to a valid ated calibration according to the manufacturer’s 
specifications. 
Reversibility/post-bronchodilator FEV 1 
Reversibility, which is defined as  an increase in absolute FEV 1 of 12% over the baseline value, 
with an absolute increase of at least 200 mL, must be demonstrated within 30 minutes of bronchodilator administration.   
A reversibility test will be administered (if not do ne and documented within 12 months of Visit 1) 
following pulmonary function testing after asthma medications have been withheld for the 
appropriate intervals.  Patients will receive 2 to up to 4 puffs of albuterol/salbutamol.  
Alternatively, and only if it is consistent , with usual office practice (to be documented),

may be repeated several times within 30 minutes after administration of bronchodilator.   
If the patient does not meet the reversibility at Vi sit 1, 2 additional assessments can be performed 
at any time (ie, unscheduled visits) prior to randomization (Visit 3). 
Further details on spirometry will be available in a separate operationa l manual provided to the 
sites. 
9.2.2.3 Electronic diary/peak expiratory flow meter 
On a daily basis throughout the study, the pa tient uses an electroni c diary/PEF meter to: 
xMeasure morning and evening PEF 
xRespond to the morning and evening asthma symptom scale questions 
xRecord daily prednisone/prednisolone usage 
xIndicate the number of puffs/day of salbutam ol/albuterol or levosalbutamol/levalbuterol 
for symptom relief 
xRecord the use of daily controller medications  
xRecord the number of nocturnal awakenings due to asthma symptoms 
xRecord oral steroids use for asthma exacerbation event 
At Screening (Visit 1), patients will be issued an eDiary/PEF.  Patients will be instructed on the 
use of the device, and written inst ructions on the use of the elec tronic PEF meter will be provided 
to the patients.  In addition, the Investigator will instruct the patients on how to record the following variables in the electronic PEF meter: 
xMorning PEF performed within 15 minutes after arising (between 5:30 AM and 10 AM) 
prior to taking any albuterol or levalbuterol 
xEvening PEF performed in the evening (between 5:30 PM and 10 PM) prior to taking any 
albuterol or levalbuterol 
xPatients should try to withhold albuterol/salbutamol or levalbuterol/levosalbutamol for at 
least 6 hours prior to measuring their PEF 
xThree PEF efforts will be performed by the pa tient; all 3 values will be recorded by the 
electronic PEF meter, and the highes t value will be used for evaluation 
Baseline morning PEF will be the mean AM meas urement recorded for the 7 days prior to 
randomization, and baseline evening PEF will be the mean PM measurement recorded for the 7 days prior to randomization.  Period stability limit is defined as the respective mean morning or 
evening PEF obtained over the last 7 days prior to Day1.  There should be at least 4 days’ 
measurement for setting up the stability limit, and the first dosing visit should be rescheduled until data for 4 days are available.  Please refer to the Operational Manual for additional information.

9.2.2.4 Asthma Control Questionnaire 
The ACQ was designed to measure both the adequa cy of asthma control and change in asthma 
control which occurs either spontaneously or as a result of treatment.  During the OCS Optimization period, the ACQ-5 will be completed weekly in the patient’s eDiary.  During the treatment period, the ACQ-7 will be performed at clinic visits and the ACQ-5 will be completed on a weekly basis for those weeks that the patient does not have a scheduled clinic visit. 
9.2.2.4.1 Asthma Control Questionnaire-5 question version 
The ACQ-5 is a 5-item questionnaire, which has been developed as a measure of patients’ asthma control that can be quickly and easil y completed in clinical practice ( 14).  The questions are 
designed to be self-completed by the patient.  The 5 questions enquire about the frequency and/or severity of symptoms (nocturnal awakening on waking in the morning, activity limitation, shortness of breath, and wheezing).  The response options for all these questions consist of a 0 (no 
impairment/limitation) to 6 (total impairment/ limitation) scale ( Appendix D ).  The ACQ-5 score 
is a mean of the values recorded for the individual questions. 
Throughout the study patients should complete the ACQ-5 on a weekly basis using their eDiary.  
The results from the ACQ-5 will be used as a part of the assessmen t to determine patient 
eligibility for OCS dose adjustment.  The patient should complete the questionnaire within the eDiary.  The patient should be instructed to complete the questions as accurately as possible.  The patient should be reassured that there are no right or wrong answers.  If the patient requests help or clarification with any of the questions, he/she will be asked to reread the instructions and give 
the answer that best reflects how he/she felt over the previous week.  The Investigator should not provide the patient with any answer or attempt to interpret any portion of a question. 
If the ACQ-5 is completed through the eDiary while the patient is at a scheduled in-clinic visit, it 
is recommended that the ACQ-5 be  administered at the same time during the visit.  To avoid 
biasing responses, the patients should not be told the results of diagnostic tests prior to completing the questionnaire and should be completed before any procedures are performed on the patient to avoid influencing the patient’s response.  Adequate time should be allowed to complete all items on the ACQ-5. 
9.2.2.4.2 Asthma Control Quesionnaire-7 question version 
The ACQ-7 consists of 7 questions.  The first 5 questions assess the most common asthma symptoms: 1. frequency in past week awoken by asthma during the night, 2. severity of asthma symptoms in the morning, 3. limitation of daily activ ities due to asthma, 4. s hortness of breath due 
to asthma and 5. wheeze, plus 6. short-acting bronchodilator use and 7. FEV
1 (pre-bronchodilator 
use, % and % predicted use).  Patients are asked to recall how their asthma has been during the 
previous week and to respond to the symptom questions on a 7-point scale (0=no impairment, 6= maximum impairment; Appendix E ).

Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 60 Clinic staff scores the FEV 1% predicted on a 7-point scale.  The questions are equally weighted 
and the ACQ score is the mean of the 7 questions and therefore between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled). 
A global score is calculated: the questions are equally weighted and the ACQ-7 score is the mean 
of the 7 questions and, therefore, between 0 (totally controlled) and 6 (severely uncontrolled).  
Higher score indicates lower asthma control.  Pa tients with a score below 1.0 reflect adequately 
controlled asthma and patients with scores above 1.0 reflect inadequately controlled asthma.  On the 7-point scale of the ACQ-7, a change or difference in score of 0.5 is the smallest change that can be considered clinically important, corresponding to the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) defined by the developer. 
Measurement properties such as re liability and ability to detect change have been documented in 
the literature ( 14). 
9.2.2.5 Health care resource utilization 
A questionnaire of health care resource utilization (reliever medication, specialist visit, 
hospitalization, emergency or urgent medical care facility visit, outcome, sick leaves, school days’ loss, etc) will be administered at each visit. 
9.2.2.6 Airway hyperresponsiveness (optional; only for patients enrolled in select sites in 
Canada)
Airway hyperresponsiveness will be assessed through a bronchial provocation test using 
methacholine (to be done only if the patient’s FEV 1 is 70% of predicted).  A 20% decrease in the 
FEV 1 will be considered as a positive test and the PC 20 of agonist to cause this decrease is 
calculated by interpolation from the dose-response curve.  
9.2.3 Safety and tolerability endpoints  
The same safety assessments will be applied across both arms.  A dverse events, including serious 
adverse events (SAEs) and AEs of  special interest (AESI), will be collected at every visit.  The 
Investigator will ask the patient how he/she has fe lt since the last study visit.  To assure the 
continuing safety of patients in this study, an  independent DMC will be responsible for reviewing 
the safety data on a periodic basis throughout the course of the study as outlined in Section  6.4.1 . 
Safety observations 
xThe Investigator should take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the patients.  
Notably, he/she should follow up the outcome of SAEs /AESI until clinical recovery is 
complete and laboratory results  have returned to normal or until progression has been 
stabilized or death.  In all cases, this may imply that observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional investigations may be requested by the Sponsor.

9.2.3.1 Adverse events 
Adverse events for each patient will be monito red and documented from th e time the patient gives 
informed consent at Visit 1 until the End-of-Stu dy visit (Visit 14) or until the rollover to a 
long-term study, except for: 
xSerious AEs 
xAdverse events that are ongoing at database lock 
Adverse events, AESI, and SAEs will be reported as described in Section  10.4. 
9.2.3.2 Vital signs 
Vital signs, including blood pressure (mmHg), he art rate (beats per minute), respiratory rate 
(breaths per minute), body temperature (degrees Celsius) and body weight (kg) will be measured 
at every visit.  Height (cm) will be measur ed at the Screening visit (Visit 1) only.  
Vital signs will be measured in the sitting position using the same arm at each visit, and will be 
measured prior to receiving investigational product at the clinic visits.  
Refer to Section  1.1 for the schedule of vital signs performed throughout this study. 
9.2.3.3 Physical examination 
Physical examinations will include an asse ssment of general appearance, skin, eyes, 
ear/nose/throat, heart, chest, abdomen, reflexes, lymph nodes, spine, and extremities.  All deviations from normal will be reco rded, including those attributab le to the patient’s disease. 
Refer to Section  1.1 for the schedule of physical examinations performed throughout this study. 
9.2.3.4 ECG 
One recording of a standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be performed centrally.  Refer 
to Section  1.1 for the schedule of ECGs performed throughout this study.  At the 
post-randomization visits in which an ECG is sc heduled, the ECG will be performed prior to 
investigational product administration.

Please refer to the Operational Manual for additional information. The ECGs will be manually read at  a central reading vendor.   
9.2.3.5 Clinical laboratory tests 
The clinical laboratory tests will be conducted by an accredited (College of American Pathologists 
or equivalent) central laboratory with national and regional clinical licenses as required for diagnostic testing and must provide evidence of participation in prof iciency testing, as 
appropriate.  After reviewing the laboratory report and evaluating any results that are outside the 
normal range, the Investigator must sign and date the laboratory report.   
Abnormal laboratory values that are considered to be clinically significant by the Investigator 
must be repeated as soon as possible after rece iving the laboratory repor t to rule out laboratory 
error.  Persistent abnormal laboratory values should be repeated until they return to normal or until an etiology of the persistent abnormality is determined. 
Refer to Section  1.1 for the description of the clinical laboratory evaluations and the schedule of 
laboratory evaluations performed throughout this study. 
The clinical laboratory parameters that will be measured are: 
xHematology: To include hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelet count, total white blood cell 
(WBC) count with 5-part differential count, and total red blood cell count. 
xSerum chemistry: To include creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, glucose, hemoglobin A1c 
(HbA1c), uric acid, total chol esterol, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin (in case of 
values above the normal range, differentiation in conjugated and non-conjugated bilirubin), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), AST, alkaline phosphatase, lactate 
dehydrogenase, electrolytes (sodium, potassium, chloride), bicarbonate, and creatine 
phosphokinase.  At Visits 3 (randomization), 8, and 11, the blood sample should be taken with the patient in fasting state which means no intake of any food or drink except for water for at least 8 hours.  If the visit can only be done at a different time of the day and the patient is not fasting, then he/she should be advised to eat a light meal and the site should document that the serum chemistry was not obtained under fasting conditions. 
xUrine dipstick analysis: To include specific gravity, pH, glucose, ketones, blood, protein, 
nitrate, leukocyte esterase, urobilinogen and bilirubin (by dipstick).  If any parameter on 
the dipstick is abnormal, a urine sample should be sent to the central laboratory for testing. If positive for proteins, microscopic analys is is performed by central laboratory. 
xSerum immunoglobulins: quantitative immunoassays for total IgG, IgG subclasses 1-4, 
IgM, and IgA (after the first administration of  IMP, results are blinded to the sites and 
sponsor study team).

9.2.4 Patient Reported Outcomes (Health-related Quality of Life/health economic 
variables/other endpoints) 
Patients should complete PROs before undergoing spirometry testing. 
9.2.4.1 Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire 
The AQLQ was designed as a self-administered PRO to measure the functional impairments that 
are most troublesome to patients as a result of their asthma (see Appendix G ).  The instrument is 
comprised of 32 items, each rated on a 7-point Likert scale (from 1 to 7).  The AQLQ has 4 domains.  The domains and the number of items in each domain are as follows: 
xSymptoms (12 items) 
xActivity limitation (11 items) 
xEmotional function (5 items) 
xEnvironmental Stimuli (4 items) 
A global score is calculated ranging from 1 to 7 and a score by domain.  Higher scores indicate 
better quality of life. 
The instrument has been used in many clinical tr ials, and it has been shown to be reliable, valid 
(patient interviews), and sensitive to change.  The MCID for the AQLQ is 0.5 ( 15).

The SNOT-22 is a validated questionnaire to assess the impact of chronic rhinosinusitis on health 
related quality of life (see Appendix H ).  The SNOT-22 has 22 items, 5 domains and a global 
score.  The 5 domains include: 
xNasal (range 0-30) with a MCID of -2.5 
xEar (range 0-15) with a MCID of -1.25 
xSleep (0-20) with a MCID of -1.67 
xGeneral and practical (0-30) with a MCID of -2.50 
xEmotional (0-15) with a MCID of -1.25.  
The range of the global score is 0-110 and an MCID of 8.9 ( 16).  Lower scores indicate less 
impact.  The recall period of the assessm ent is within the past 2 weeks. 
9.2.4.3 Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
The HADS is a general scale used to detect states of anxiety and depression and has been 
validated in patients with asthma (see Appendix I ).  The instrument is comprised of 14 items: 
7 items each related to anxiety and depression.  Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0-3; 
with a score for either anxiety or depression ranging between 0 and 21. 
The minimal important difference for the HADS-A (anx iety) has been reported to be in the range 
of 0.41 (anxious and depressed patients in active treatment controlled studies) to 1.32 (COPD patients), in the range of 0.50 (anxious and depressed patients in active treatment controlled studies) to 1.40 (COPD patients) for HADS-D (depression) and approximately 1.5 (COPD patients) for the HADS total score ( 17,18). 
Alternatively, a significant improvement in treatment versus placebo group was defined as the 
percentage of patients who moved from a defined category of moderate to severe depression or anxiety (8) to not having the disease (<8) ( 19).  Using this methodology Stelara (Ustekinumab) 
was able to make the claim in summary of produ ct characteristics that “HADS was significantly 
improved in the treatment group compared with placebo” ( 20). 
9.2.4.4 EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ-5D-5L is a standardized health-related quality of life questionnaire developed by the 
EuroQol Group in order to provide a simple, generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal ( 21).  The EQ-5D is designed for self-completion by patients. 
The EQ-5D essentially consists of 2 pages – the EQ-5D descriptive system and the EQ visual 
analogue scale (VAS; see Appendix J) .  The EQ-5D descriptive system comprises 5 dimensions: 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression.  Each dimension has 5 levels: no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.  The EQ VAS records the respondent’s self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue

and 0 (worst imaginable health state) at the bottom.  The MCID for the EQ-5D in asthma patients has been reported to be in the range of 0.001 to 0.074 ( 22,23). 
9.2.4.5 Asthma symptom score 
Patients will record overall sympto m scores in an eDiary twice a day prior to measuring their 
PEF.  Symptoms experienced during the night will be recorded upon arising (AM symptom score).  The patient’s overall asthma symptoms experienced during the waking hours will be recorded in the evening (PM symptom score).  Baseline symptom scores will be the mean AM 
and mean PM scores recorded for the 7 days prior to randomization.  Scores can range between 
0-4 with 0 indicating more mild symptoms and 4 indicating more severe symptoms.  There is no 
global score, just an AM score and a PM score.  An MCID of 0.35 will be used. 
9.2.5 Systemic drug concentration and anti-drug antibodies 
9.2.5.1 Sampling time 
Blood samples of serum functional dupilumab and anti-dupilumab antibodies will be collected as 
designated in the study flow chart ( Section  1.1).  Patients who discontinue early from treatment or 
patients who choose not to roll over into a long-term study may be asked to return to the clinic to have additional ADA samples collected for analysis based on the overall clinical presentation at that time.  
In the event of an SAE or any AESI of anaphylaxis or systemic allergic reaction related to IMP 
and requiring treatment, or severe injection site reaction lasting longer than 24 hours, samples will 
be collected near the onset and resolution of the event for any additional analysis if required or for archival purposes. An unscheduled systemic drug concentration page in the e-CRF must be completed as well. 
Pre-existing anti-drug antibodies are defined as:  
xAn ADA positive response in the assay at baseline with all post treatment ADA results 
negative, OR 
xAn ADA positive response at baseline with all post treatment ADA responses less than 4-
fold over baseline titer levels. 
Treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies are defined as:  
xAn ADA positive response in the assay post first dose, when baseline results are negative 
or missing. 
xTreatment-boosted anti-drug antibodies are defined as:   
xAn ADA positive response in the assay post first dose that is greater-than or equal to 4-
fold over baseline titer levels, when baseline results are positive.

9.2.6 Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamics is an exploratory endpoint. 
Several biomarkers related to asthmatic inflammation and Th2 pol arization will be assessed for 
their value in predicting therapeutic response and/or in documenting the time course of drug 
response.  In 2 prior asthma trials (ACT11457 and DRI12544), treatment with dupilumab 
significantly suppressed systemic levels of serum TARC (CCL17; a ligand of CCR4 receptors that attracts Th2 cells), plasma eotaxin-3 (CCL26; a ligand of CCR3 receptors that attracts eosinophils and lung mast cells), and serum total IgE (a product of immunoglobulin class switching driven by IL-4), as well as reduced the concentrations of FeNO (a marker of airway inflammation).  Periostin (a protein reported to be elevated at baseline in patients responsive to treatment with anti-IL-13 antibodies) is included to differentiate dupilumab from the anti-IL-13 therapeutic class. 
Assay methodologies are briefly summarized below.  More detailed information on the collection, 
handling, transport and preservation of samples (eg, minimum volumes required for blood collection and for aliquots for each biomarker assay) will be provided in a separate laboratory 
manual. 
9.2.6.1 Whole blood biomarkers 
Blood eosinophil count will be measured as part of the standard 5-part WBC differential cell 
count on a hematology autoanalyzer. 
9.2.6.2 Plasma biomarkers 
Eotaxin-3 will be measured in heparinized plasma with a validated enzyme immunoassay (Human Eotaxin-3 Quantikine ELISA kit; R&D Systems). 
9.2.6.3 Serum biomarkers 
Antigen-specific IgE will be detected using panels of antigens appropriate to the location of the clinical site (ImmunoCAP test; Phadia). 
Total IgE will be measured with a quantitative method (eg, ImmunoCAP) approved for diagnostic 
testing.

9.2.6.4 Fractional exhaled nitric oxide 
Exhaled nitric oxide will be analyzed using a NI OX instrument (Aerocrine AB, Solna, Sweden), 
or similar analyzer using a flow rate of 50 mL/s, and reported in parts per billion (ppb).  This assessment should be conducted prior to spirometry and following a fast of at least 1 hour.  Further details on the procedure for measuring exha led nitric oxide with NIOX will be provided in 
a separate inst ruction manual. 
9.2.6.5 ILC2 and CD34 cells and cytokines in sputum and blood (optional; only for 
patients enrolled in select sites in Canada) 
Innate lymphoid type 2 cells (ILC2) secrete IL-5 and IL-13, and to a lesser extent IL-4, when 
stimulated by several factors released from inflamed respiratory epithelium such as IL-25, IL-33, and thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) and are thought to have a pivotal role in perpetuating asthma.  CD34+ eosinophil progenitor cells are known to be elevated in the sputum of patients with asthma and may participate in asthmatic inflammation.  To assess the effect of IL-4R blockade on the trafficking of IL C2 and CD34+ cells into the airway, these cells will be measured 
in the blood and induced sputum using flow cytometry.  Cytokines will be assayed in the sputum and blood using immunoassays. 
Please refer to the Operational Manual for additional information regarding sputum and blood 
collection. 
9.2.7 Pharmacogenetic assessment 
Pharmacogenetic testing is optional and voluntary. 
For those patients who sign the optional pharmacogenetic informed consent form, blood samples 
for exploratory genetic analysis of DNA or RNA will be collected at the study visit as specified in 
the study flow chart and these samples will be st ored up to 15 years after completion of the final 
report of the main clinic al trial or as appropriate accordin g to local regulations.  Specific 
procedures for collection, storage, and shipping  of pharmacogenetic samples  will be provided in a 
lab manual. 
The DNA or RNA samples may be used to determine a possible relationship between genes and 
response to treatment with dupilumab, possible adverse reactions to dupilumab, and to study the genetics of asthma.  The DNA may be subjected to a genome-wide association study by whole genome array (common single nucleotide polymorphisms) analysis and/or to whole exome sequencing or whole genome analysis in order to thoroughly explore genetic associations with disease progression or treatment response.  The RNA may be subjected to discrete panels of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analyses, microarray analyses, or RNA sequencing analyses.

Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 69 The blood DNA sample, and the DNA or RNA that is extracted, will be assigned a second 
number, a Genetic ID (de-identification code) that is different from the Patient ID.  This “double coding” is performed to separate a patient’s medical information and DNA data. 
The clinical study data (coded by  Patient ID) will be stored in the clinical data management 
system (CDMS), which is a distinct database in a separate environment from the database 
containing the pharmacogenetic data (coded by Genetic ID).  The key linking Patient ID and Genetic ID will be ma intained by a third party, under appropriate access control.  The matching of 
clinical data and pharmacogenetic data, for the purpose of data analysis, will be possible only by using this key, which will be under strict access control.  All data will be reported only in coded form in order to main tain confidentiality. 
9.3 FUTURE USE OF SAMPLES 
Not all of the samples collected during this stud y may be required for the tests planned in this 
clinical trial.  For patients who have consented to it, the samples that are archived, unused or left over after planned testing may be used for additional research purposes (excluding genetic analysis, patient to sign additional consent per Section  9.2.6 ).  For patients who have consented to 
it, archival blood samples will be collected at the visit specified in the study flow chart, 15 mL each, will be collected into a dry, red topped tube with clot activator (or into smaller tubes of equivalent total volume) kept at room temperat ure for 30 minutes and then centrifuged at 
approximately 1500 × g for 10 minutes at room temperature.  The serum will then be transferred, 
in equal portions, into 3 storage tubes, which w ill be immediately capped and frozen in an upright 
position at -20°C or colder. 
These archived serum samples, and any residual or leftover serum, plasma or blood remaining 
from planned laboratory work, may be used for research purposes related to asthma (eg, exploratory biomarkers of disease or drug effect), additional drug safety assessments, or development and validation of bioassay methods beyond those defined in the present protocol.  These samples will remain labeled with the same id entifiers as the ones used during the study (ie, 
patient ID, sample ID).  They w ill be transferred to a Sanofi site  (or a subcontractor site) which 
can be located outside of the country where the study is conducted.  The Sponsor has included safeguards for protecting patient confidentiality and personal data (see Section  14.3 and 
Section  14.5). 
9.4 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS  
The efficacy and safety assessments used in this study are standard for the evaluation of therapy in 
patients with asthma

10.1 VISIT SCHEDULE 
The clinical study consists of 3 periods:  
1. Screening and OCS Optimization Period (from 3 to up to 8 weeks for those patients who 
experience an asthma exacerbation that require s a change in OCS dose this period can be 
extended to 10 weeks to allow for 2 weeks of stabilization prior to randomization; Visits 1 and 2) 
2. Treatment Period (24 weeks): includes the randomization visit (Visit 3) and a 4-week 
induction phase (Visits 4 and 5), a 16-week OCS reduction phase (Visits 6-10), and a 4-week maintenance phase (Visit 11)  
3. Post-treatment Period (12 weeks; Visits 12-14) 
The study visits occur on the planned dates (rela tive to the first injection), as scheduled. After 
randomization, the visit schedule should be adhered to within the ± 3 day visit window. 
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to 
return to the clinic for all remaining study vi sits and participate in follow-up assessments 
according to the visit schedule.  Under exceptional circumstances when a patient cannot come to the site for the scheduled visit/s, a phone contact can be made after sponsor approval is given. During the phone contact information about AEs, concomitant medications and exacerbation events should be collected. 
Patients should be reminded that sexually active female patients of reproductive potential are 
required to practice effective contraception during the entire study duration, while taking dupilumab and for 12 weeks post last IMP dose. 
Prior to all screening assessments, after discussi on of participation in  the study, the written 
consent form (including voluntary participation in pharmacogenetic testing/future use of blood samples) must be signed and dated. 
Although the screening assessments for this study are grouped under the heading of 2 visits in this 
protocol, it is possible for them to be performed over more than the 2 scheduled site visits if necessary, as long as the screening window prior to randomization (Day 1) is respected.  If certain dynamic laboratory tests do not meet the eligibility  criteria, these laboratory assessments may be 
repeated, at the discretion of the Investigator, if it is judged to be likely to return to acceptable range for study inclusion within the screening visit window prior to Day 1.  These patients do not need to sign a new ICF and be allocated a ne w patient number within this same screening 
window. 
Patients that fail the initial screening for exclus ion criteria, eg, concomita nt medications, may be 
rescreened for study eligibility 1 additional time.  Patients that are rescreened must sign a new

instructions related to rescreen ing) unless a prior assessment is  performed within the time frame 
permitted prior to study entry. 
Patients who fail the Screening Visit because of eDiary/spirometry equipment malfunction, or 
patient-related/site perso nnel-related unintentional errors may be rescreened 1 time after approval 
is granted by the Sponsor’s clinical study director. In every case of rescreen allowance due to technical equipment malfunction and/or unintentional human error(s), the Study Investigator must document receipt of Sponsor approval and, when applicable, document the site’s corrective action plan to prevent future occurrences. 
All clinical assessments and blood samples should be performed/collected prior to the 
administration of the IMP, unless otherwise specified.  
For patients at select sites in Canada who have agreed to participate in the optional assessment, a 
sputum sample will be collected at the time of an asthma exacerbation during an unscheduled visit. 
10.1.1 Screening and Oral Corticosteroid Optimization Period 
Patients who meet eligibility criteria at the Screening visit (Visit 1) will enter the OCS Optimization phase.  The Screening/ OCS Optimization Period will be from 3 to up to 8 weeks (if 
an asthma exacerbation occurs that requires a change in OCS dose this period can be extended to 10 weeks to allow for 2 weeks of stabilization prior to randomization) in duration, dependent upon 
the length of time the patient requires to optimize their OCS dose. 
Prednisone or prednisolo ne will be used as the OCS.  At th e Screening visit, patients currently 
using other forms of maintenance OCS must have their corticosteroids switched to the 
corresponding equivalent daily dose of prednisone/prednisolone.  
Follow up visits/phone calls may be added during this period depending on the patient’s response 
to OCS dose changes. 
10.1.1.1 Visit 1 (Week -8 to -3) 
Following a discussion of participation in the clinical trial, informed consent must be obtained and documented.  These steps precede any study procedures.  In patients who experience an asthma exacerbation during the OCS Optimization phase, this visit may occur at Week -9 or -10. 
The following procedures will then be performed: 
xCall IVRS/IWRS to assign patient number and register screening visit 
xInterview to collect patient demographic information including gender, ethnic origin, race, 
date of birth, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI).

Source data is all information in original records a nd certified copies of original records of clinical 
findings, observations, or other activities in a clin ical trial necessary fo r the reconstruction and 
evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  Source documents are original documents, data and records such as hospital records, clinic and office charts, laboratory 
notes, memoranda, pharmacy dispensing records, record ed data from automated instruments, etc.  
All the data collected in the e-CRF should be transcribed directly from source documents.  Data 
downloaded from the study-associated central labora tories, spirometry, nitric oxide measurement, 
ECG, patient electronic diary/PEF meter, and the Home Dosing Diary will be considered source 
data.

EFC13691 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 91 10.3 HANDLING OF PATIENT TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TREATMENT 
DISCONTINUATION AND OF PATIENT STUDY DISCONTINUATION  
The IMP should be continued whenever possible.  In case the IMP is stopped, it should be 
determined whether the stop can be made temporarily; permanent IMP discontinuation should be 
a last resort.  Any IMP discontinuation should be fully documented in the eCRF.  In any case, the 
patient should remain in the study as long as possible. 
10.3.1 Temporary treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal products 
Temporary treatment discontinuation may be considered by the Investigator because of AEs.  Re-initiation of treatment with the IMP will be done under close and appropriate clinical and/or 
laboratory monitoring once the Investigator will have  considered according to his/her best medical 
judgment that the AE is sufficiently resolved and unlikely to recur after resuming therapy with 
IMP.   
In addition, the following conditions(s) will be cause for temporary treatment discontinuation: 
xInfections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment. 
xAny laboratory abnormality that meets temporary treatment discontinuation criteria as per 
Appendix F . 
10.3.2 Permanent treatment discontinuation with investigational medicinal product(s) 
Permanent treatment discontinua tion is any treatment discontinuation associated with the 
definitive decision from the Investigator or the pati ent not to re-expose the patient to the IMP at 
any time. 
10.3.3 List of criteria for permanent treatment discontinuation 
The patients may withdraw from treatment with the IMP if they decide to do so, at any time and 
irrespective of the reason, or this may be the Investigator’s decision.  All efforts should be made to document the reasons for treatment discontinuation and this should be documented in the 
e-CRF. 
Patients must be withdrawn from tr eatment (ie, from any further in vestigational treatment) for the 
following reasons: 
xAt their own request or at the request of their legally authorized representative (legally 
authorized representative means an individual or judicial or other body authorized under 
applicable law to consent on behalf of a prospectiv e patient to the patient ’s participation in 
the procedure(s) involved in the research). 
xIf, in the Investigator’s opinion, continuation in the study would be detrimental to the 
patient’s well-being. 
xAt the specific request of the Sponsor.

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 02  25-Jan-2017 
EFC13691 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 92 xIn the event of a protocol deviation, at the discretion of the Investigator or the Sponsor. 
xAny code breaking requested by the Invest igator will lead to permanent treatment 
discontinuation. 
xPregnancy  
xAnaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require 
treatment. 
xDiagnosis of a malignancy during study, excluding carcinoma in situ of the cervix, or 
squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin. 
xAny opportunistic infection, such as tuberculosis or other infections whose nature or 
course may suggest an immunocompromised status ( Appendix L ). 
xSerum ALT >3 ULN and total bilirubin > 2ULN ( Appendix F ). 
xSerum ALT > 5 ULN if baseline ALT < 2 ULN, or ALT >8 ULN if baseline 
ALT > 2 ULN ( Appendix F ). 
10.3.4 Handling of patients after permanent treatment discontinuation 
Patients will be followed-up according to the study procedures as specified in  this protocol up to 
the scheduled date of study completion, or up to recovery or stabilization of any AE to be 
followed-up as specified in this protocol, whichever comes last. Study investigators should continue OCS dose adjustment after treatment discontinuation, as guided by their medical judgment, including up-titration and down-titration in accordance with Table 2  (Titration schedule 
for oral corticosteroids during the OCS Reduction Phase of the Randomized Period). 
All cases of permanent treatment discontinuation should be recorded by the Investigator in the 
appropriate pages of the CRF when considered as confirmed.   
Patients who discontinue early from treatment may be asked to return to  the clinic to have 
additional ADA samples collected based on the overall assessment of antibody titers and clinical presentation. 
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to 
return to the clinic for remaining study visits and participate in follow-up assessments according 
to the visit schedule. 
Under exceptional circumstances when a patient  cannot come to the site for the scheduled visit/s, 
a phone contact can be made after sponsor approval is given. During the phone contact information about AEs, concomitant medications and exacerbation events should be collected. 
10.3.5 Procedure and consequence for patient withdrawal from study  
The patients may withdraw from the study before study completion if they decide to do so, at any time and irrespective of the reason.

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 02  25-Jan-2017 
EFC13691 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 93 Withdrawal of consent for follow-up should be accompanied by documentation of the reason for 
withdrawal. Withdrawal of consent for treatment should be distinguished from withdrawal of consent for follow-up visits and from withdrawal of consent for non-patient contact follow-up, eg, medical records checks. Patients requesting withdrawal should be informed that withdrawal of 
consent for follow-up will jeopardize the public health value of the study. 
Patients who withdraw should be explicitly asked about the contribution of possible adverse 
events to their decision to withdraw consent, and any adverse event information elicited should be documented.  
Patients may withdraw consent verbally or in writing and, if verbal, then the site needs to 
document in source records that patient withdrew consent verbally.  All study withdrawals should be recorded by the investigator in the appropriate screens of the e-CRF and in the patient’s medical records when considered as confirmed. In the medical record, at least the date of the 
withdrawal and the reason should be documented. 
If possible, the patients are assessed using the procedure normally planned for the end-of-study 
visit including a systemic drug concentration sample, if appropriate, and three Post treatment 
Period Visits. 
For patients who fail to return to the site, the Investigator should make the best effort to re-contact 
the patient (eg, contacting patient’s family or private physician, reviewing available registries or health care databases), and to determine his/her health status, including at least his/her vital status. Attempts to contact such patient s must be documented in the patie nt’s records (eg, times and dates 
of attempted telephone contact, receipt for sending a registered letter). 
A patient should only be designated as lost to follow-up if the site is unable to establish contact 
with the patient after 3 documented attempts via 2 different methods (phone, text, e-mail, certified letter, etc). 
The statistical analysis plan (SAP) will specify how these patients lost to follow-up for their 
primary endpoints will be considered. Patients who have withdrawn from the study cannot be rerandomized (treated) in the study. Their inclusion and treatment numbers must not be reused. 
10.4 OBLIGATION OF THE INVESTIGATOR REGARDING SAFETY REPORTING 
10.4.1 Definitions of adverse events  10.4.1.1 Adverse event 
An adverse event  (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
patient administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Asthma exacerbations should only be reported as AEs if they fulfill a seriousness criterion.

medical judgment and applicable national/inte rnational asthma management guidelines. 
10.4.1.2 Serious adverse event 
A serious adverse event  (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
xResults in death, or 
xIs life-threatening, or 
Note: The term “life-threatening”  in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in which 
 the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which 
 hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
xRequires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, or 
xResults in persistent or sign ificant disability/incapacity, or

10.4.1.3 Adverse event of special interest 
An adverse event of special interest (AESI) is an AE (serious or non-serious) of scientific and 
medical concern specific to the Sponsor’s product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and immediate notification by the Investigator to the Sponsor is required. Such events may require further investigation in order to characterize and understand them. Adverse events of special interest may be added or removed during a study by protocol amendment. 
For these AESIs, the Sponsor will be informed immediately (ie, within 24 hours), per SAE 
notification described Section  10.4.2 , even if not fulfilling a seriousness criterion, using the 
corresponding pages in the CRF (to be sent) or screens in the e-CRF.  
xAnaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require 
treatment (refer to Appendix K for the definition of anaphylaxis) 
xSevere injection site reactions that last longer than 24 hours 
xAny infection meeting at least 1 of the following criteria: 
- Any serious infection (SAE) 
- Requires parenteral (intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous) antimicrobial therapy 
- Requires oral antimicrobial therapy for longer than 2 weeks - Is a parasitic infection  - Is an opportunistic infection ( Appendix L ) 
Note:  Antimicrobial therapy refers to an tibiotic, antiviral, and antifungal agents 
xSignificant ALT elevation 
- ALT >5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN) in patients with baseline ALT 2 x ULN; 
or 
- ALT >8 x ULN if baseline ALT >2 x ULN 
xPregnancy of a female patient entered in a study as well as pregnancy occurring in a 
female partner of a male patient entered in a study with IMP/noninvestigational medicinal 
product (NIMP);  
- Pregnancy occurring in a female patient entered in the clinical trial or in a female 
partner of a male patient ente red in the clinical trial. It will be qualified as an SAE only 
if it fulfills one of the seriousness criteria (see Section 10.4.1.2). 
- In the event of pregnancy in a female participant, IMP should be discontinued.  - Follow-up of the pregnancy in a female par ticipant or in a female partner of a male 
participant is mandatory until th e outcome has be en determined.

10.4.3 General guidelines for reporting adverse events 
xAll AEs, regardless of seriousness or relationship to IMP/NIMP, spanning from the 
signature of the informed consent form un til the end of the study as defined by the 
protocol for that patient, are to be recorded on the corresponding page(s) or screen(s) of the e-CRF. 
xProtocol defined asthma exacerbation events ar e collected as efficacy endpoints via the 
asthma exacerbation form.  These events should not be reported as AEs unless they fulfill 
a seriousness criterion.   
xWhenever possible, diagnosis or single syndrome should be reported instead of symptoms. 
The Investigator should specify the date of onset, intensity, action taken with respect to 
IMP, corrective treatment/therapy given, add itional investigations performed, outcome, 
and his/her opinion as to whether there is a r easonable possibility that the AE was caused 
by the IMP or by the study procedure(s).  In studies that require the use of 
combined/multiple IMPs/NIMPs, the GSO with input from other appropriate study team members must determine if the causal relationship will either be assessed for the combined 
product as a regimen or as distinct entities.  The GSO must communicate this decision to the study team for inclusion in the protocol and AE CRF. 
xThe Investigator should take appropriate measures to follow all AEs until clinical recovery 
is complete and laborat ory results have returned to nor mal, or until progression has been 
stabilized, or until death, in order to ensure the sa fety of the patients.  This may imply that 
observations will continue beyond the last planned visit per protocol, and that additional investigations may be requested by the monitoring team up to as noticed by the Sponsor.  Patients who experience an ongoing SAE or an AESI, at the prespecified study end-date, should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or death and related data will be 
collected. The duration of poststudy follow-up and reporting of AEs will be specified (eg, 
until recovery).

During the course of the study, the Sponsor will report in an expedited manner: 
- All SAEs that are both unexpected and at least reasonably related to the IMP 
(SUSAR), to the regulatory author ities, Institutional Ethics Committees 
(IECs)/Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) as appropriate and to the Investigators.

EFC13691 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 99 In this study, some AEs are considered related to the underlying condition and thus will not be 
considered unexpected (eg, wheezing related to asthma). 
Any other AE not listed as an expected event in the Investigator’s Brochure or in this protocol 
will be considered unexpected. 
For safety, the treatment code will be unblinded by the Sponsor for reporting to the Health 
Authority of any suspected unexpected adverse dr ug reaction (SUSAR) and reasonably associated 
with the use of the IMP according to either the judgment of the Investigator and/or the Sponsor. 
In case of a SUSAR, Sanofi Global Pharmacovigila nce and Epidemiology will utilize XGRID to 
reveal medication assignment for regulatory reporting requirements for the particular case. 
The Sponsor will report all safety observations made during the conduct of the trial in the clinical 
study report. 
10.6 SAFETY INSTRUCTIONS 
10.6.1 Hypersensitivity 
Allergic reaction is a potential risk associated with the admin istration of most therapeutic 
monoclonal antibodies. 
Allergic reactions may be defined as immunologically-mediated responses to a pharmaceutical 
and/or formulation agent in a sensitized person. Signs and symptoms are often experienced during or shortly after therapeutic administration.  These reactions may present in a variety of ways, including dizziness, headache, anxiety, dyspnea, hypotension, tachycardia, pruritus, rash, urticaria/angioedema, flushing, nausea, or vomiting.  Refer to Appendix K  “Definition of 
Anaphylaxis”, which describe s the clinical criteria for the diagnosis of anaphylaxis.  
Patients should be monitored for at least 30 minutes after each study-site administered 
investigational product administration for any signs or symptoms of a hypersensitivity reaction. Trained personnel and medications should be available to treat anaphylaxis or any severe allergic 
reaction if it occurs.  Furthermore, the patients will be advised, when the IMP is administered at 
home, to self-monitor for potential signs and symp toms that may suggest a hypersensitive reaction 
for at least 30 minutes after administration.  
Anaphylactic reactions or systemic allergic reactions that are related to IMP and require treatment 
must be reported as an adverse event of special interest (AESI) (within 24 hours; for further details, see AESI definition in Section  10.4.1.3  and Appendix K ) and study medication must be 
permanently discontinued. ADA and PK samples will be collected near the onset and resolution of the AESI for any additional analysis.

Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 02  25-Jan-2017 
EFC13691 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 100 10.6.2 Severe injection site reactions 
Based on the SC mode of administration of high doses of protein and on a higher incidence of 
local injection site reactions observed at the highest dose level (300 mg weekly), severe injection site reactions, are considered as a potential risk.  Patients who experience an injection site reaction 
must be closely monitored for the possibility of a more intense injec tion site reaction with a future 
injection.  Any severe injection reaction that lasts over 24 hours will be reported as an AESI with immediate notification. ADA and PK samples will be collected near the onset and resolution of the AESI for any additional analysis. 
Prophylactic treatment/ premedication for an injection site reaction is not permitted. 
10.6.3 Infections 
Some biologic therapies have been associated with an increased risk of infection, including 
opportunistic infection.  As a precautionary measure, the Investigator is required to carefully monitor for any signs or symptoms of infec tion such as, but not limited to, increased body 
temperature, malaise, weight loss, sweats, cough, dyspnea, pulmonary infiltrates, or serious febrile 
systemic illness. 
Since dupilumab binds to IL-4R Į, preventing IL-4 and IL-13 activation of their respective 
receptors, it inhibits the T-helper 2 (Th2) cytokines production. Infections with a diversity of helminthic parasites elicit eosinophilia via stimulation of Th2-like lymphocyte responses. The Th2 response is characterized by production of IL-4, IL-13 and IL-5, subsequently generating IgG1 and IgE-secreting cells, and eliciting eosinophilia.  Eosinophilia is prominent in a number of helminthic parasitic diseases. The eosinophilic response to helminths is determined both by the host's immune response and by the parasite, including its distribution, migration, and development within the infected host. Therefore, patients treated with dupilumab may potentially have an 
increased risk of parasitic infection. 
Section  10.4.1.3  defines infections that should be reported as AESIs (ie, within 24 hours). 
A complete diagnostic work-up should be performed (ie, cultures, histopathological or cytological 
evaluation, antigen detection, and serum antibody titers).  Patients should be referred to an infectious disease specialist if deemed necessary for diagnostic work up and appropriate treatment. 
Infections or infestations that do not respond to medical treatment should have study drug 
discontinued until the in fection is resolved. 
For any opportunistic infection, such as TB or other infections whose nature or course may 
suggest an immunocompromised status (Appendix L), patients must be permanently discontinued from study medication. 
In order to minimize this risk, any patient with an active parasitic infection should be excluded 
from the study. Similarly, patients with suspected parasitic infection, or those at high risk of parasitic infection are also ex cluded, unless clinical and (if ne cessary) laboratory assessments 
(electronic 
Amended Clinical Trial Protocol 02  25-Jan-2017 
EFC13691 - dupilumab Version number: 1 
Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 101 have ruled out active infection before randomization. During the study, appearance of signs or 
symptoms (such as abdominal pain, cough, diarrhea, fever, fatigue hepatosplenomegaly) that could be associated with a parasitic  infection should be carefully eval uated, especially if there is a 
history of parasitic exposure through recent travel to/ or residence in endemic areas, especially 
when conditions are conducive to infection (eg, extended stay, rural or slum areas, lack of running 
water, consumption of uncooked, undercooked, or otherwise potentially contaminated food, close contact with carriers and vectors, etc). Subsequent medical assessments (eg, stool exam, blood tests, etc) must be performed in order to rule out parasitic infection/infestation.   Patients with confirmed parasitic infections during the study should be reported as AESI with immediate notification.  
10.6.4 Elevated liver function tests 
No preclinical and clinica l data has suggested any hepatic toxicity of dupilumab; however, as a 
general consideration of clinical development, the administration of immunosuppressant or immunomodulating agents may represent an additional risk factor for hepatotoxicity. 
In order to closely follow potential liver function abnormalities, assessment of total protein, 
albumin, total bilirubin, ALT, aspartate aminotra nsferase, and alkaline ph osphatase are measured 
as part of the clinical laboratory testing.  Clin ical laboratory testing at Visit 1 and Visit 10 (only 
applicable for patients who pla nned to roll over into a long-term study) adds hepatitis screen 
(HBsAg, HBsAb, IgM and IgG/total-HBcAb, and HCVAb).  Patients who are IgG/total-HBcAb 
positive and HBsAg negative at Visit 1 or Visit 10 must undergo HBV DNA testing prior to 
randomization to determine eligibility (only applicable for patie nts who plan to roll over into a 
long-term study).  Furthermore, it is recommended that patients who are receiving potentially immunosuppressive therapy and are IgG HBcAb positive and HBV DNA negative undergo surveillance HBV DNA studies every 1 to 3 months depending upon the individual potential therapeutic risk and comorbidities.  If necessary, a hepatologist should be consulted on a case-by-case basis. 
Hepatitis virus tests and liver f unction tests (LFTs) will be performed at Visit 1, prior to 
randomization, to exclude those patients with high risk of hepatitis infection or severe liver injury from this study  (Section  7.2 and Section  9.2.3.5 ). 
In order to closely follow potential liver abnormalities, assessment of total protein, albumin, total 
bilirubin (in case of values above the normal range, differentiation in conjugated and nonconjugated bilirubin), alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase are measured as part of the clinical laboratory testing ( Section  9.2.3.5 ).  
Guidance for the investigation of elevated LFTs is provided in  Appendix F. 
10.7 ADVERSE EVENTS MONITORING 
All events will be managed a nd reported in compliance with all applicable regulations, and 
included in the final clinical study report.

Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 102 11 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
11.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE 
The sample size estimation is based on the comparison between dupilumab doses versus placebo 
with regard to the primary endpoint and the key secondary endpoint: percentage reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 compared with the baseline dose and proportion of patients achieving a reduction of 50% or greater in their OCS dose compared with baseline at Week 24, while maintaining asthma control.  For the primary endpoint, assuming a common standard deviation of 50%, with  90 randomized patients per group, the study will have 94% power to detect a treatment difference of 27% ( 24) at the 2-tailed significance level of Į=0.05.  For the key secondary endpoint, with the 
same sample size of 90 randomized patients per group, the study will have 81% power to detect a difference in the proportion of patients achieving 50% or greater in their OCS dose of 33% in the placebo group, compared to 54% in the dupilumab group ( 22), at the 2-tailed significance level of 
Į=0.05. Calculations were made using nQuery Advisor 7.0. 
Patients will be randomized using a 1:1 randomization ratio for dupilumab 300mg q2w and 
placebo. Randomization will be stratified by optimized OCS dose at Week 0 ( 10 mg/day, 
>10 mg/day) and country. 
Recruitment of patients whose eosinophil level is below 150 cells/ μL will stop when 
approximately 46 (25% of the total sample size) of such patients are randomized. Recruitment will continue with patients whose eosinophil level is greater than or equal to 150 cells/ μL until 
reaching the total sample size of 180.  In addition, the number of patients receiving 5 mg OCS at Visit 3 will be limited to approximately 54 patients (approximately 30% of the study population). 
11.2 DISPOSITION OF PATIENTS 
Screened patients are defined as any patient who signed the informed consent.  
Randomized patients consis t of all patients with a treatment kit number allocated and recorded in 
the IVRS database, regardless of whether the treatment kit was used or not. 
Patients treated without being randomized will not be considered as randomized and will not be 
included in any efficacy population.

11.3.2 Safety population 
The analysis population for the safety endpoints will be the safety population defined as all patients exposed to study medication, regardless of the amount of treatment administered. The safety analyses will be conducted according to the treatment patients actually received. 
The treatment-emergent period for the safety population is defined as the time between the first 
administration of study medication to the end of the Post-treatment period (12 weeks after the end 
of study treatment) or until the patient rolls over into a long-term study. 
In addition:  
xRandomized patients for whom it is unclear whether they took the study medication will 
be included in the safety population as randomized. 
xFor patients receiving more than 1 study treatment during the trial, the treatment group 
allocation for as-treated analysis will be the dupilumab group. 
11.3.3 Systemic drug concentration population 
The systemic drug concentration population will consist of all patients in the safety population 
with at least 1 evaluable functional dupilumab co ncentration result.  Patients will be analyzed 
according to the treatment they actually received. 
11.3.4 Anti-drug antibody population 
The ADA population will consist of all patients in the safety population who had at least 1 reportable ADA result (either “ADA negative” or “ADA positive”) after the first dose of the study treatment. 
11.4 STATISTICAL METHODS 
11.4.1 Extent of study treatment exposure and compliance 
The extent of study treatment exposure and co mpliance will be assessed and summarized by 
actual treatment received within the safety population.

Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 104 11.4.1.2 Compliance  
Compliance with the IMP will be su mmarized in the following manner. 
A given administration will be considered noncompliant if the patient did not take the planned 
dose of treatment as required by  the protocol.  No imputation will be made for patients with 
missing or incomplete data.  
The percentage of compliance for a patient will be  defined as the number of administrations the 
patient was compliant divided by the total number of  administrations the pa tient was planned to 
take during the treatment pe riod (ie, from the 1st to the last administration). 
Treatment compliance, above-planned and under-planned dosing percentages will be summarized 
descriptively (N, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, and maximum).  The 
percentage of patients with a compliance <80% will be summarized.  In addition, the number and percentage of patients with at least 1 dose greate r than the planned dosing administration will be 
provided, as well as the number and percentage of patients with 0, (0, 20%), and >20% under-planned dosing administrations. 
Compliance to OCS and controlle r medications will be summari zed separately and will be 
specified in the SAP. 
11.4.2 Analyses of efficacy endpoints 
11.4.2.1 Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint 
The outcome of the percentage reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 compared with the baseline 
dose, while maintaining asthma control, w ill be calculated as (optimized OCS dose at  
baseline – final OCS dose at Week 24)/ optimized OCS dose at baseline × 100%.   
The percentage reduction will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model.  
The model will include the percentage reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 as the response variable, and the treatment groups, optimized OCS dose at baseline, regions (pooled countries), and baseline eosinophil level subgroups (<150 cells/ μL, 150 cells/ μL) as covariates.  A review of 
the residuals will be done to determine whether the normality assumption is met.  If the normality assumption is not met, a rank ANCOVA model will be used to corroborate the result. 
The treatment difference will be tested at the 2-sided significance level of Į=0.05.  Descriptive 
statistics for the primary efficacy endpoint will be provided, including the number of patients, means, standard errors, and least squares (LS) mea ns by the treatment groups, as well as the 
difference in LS means and the corresponding 95% confidence interval (CI).  
Patients who permanently discontinue the study medication will be asked and encouraged to 
return to the clinic for all remaining study visits  and the Investigator will continue to prescribe 
OCS at the dose specified for OCS titration (as described in Section  8.2.2.2 ).  The off-treatment 
OCS dose at Week 24 will be used in the primary analysis.  For patients with an ongoing severe asthma exacerbation and who has not completed treatment of the exacerbation at Week 24, the

exacerbation occurred. 
A sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy  endpoint will be specified in the SAP. 
11.4.2.1.1 Subgroup analysis 
To assess the consistency in treatment effects across the subgroup levels, subgroup analyses will 
be conducted for the primary efficacy endpoint with respect to baseline optimized OCS dose strata, age group, gender, region, race, baseline FEV
1, predicted FEV 1 %, ACQ-5, weight, BMI, 
smoking history, atopic medical history, age of onset of asthma, number of prior asthma exacerbations, baseline eosinophil level (<150 cells/ μL or 150 cells/ μL), and select baseline 
biomarker levels.  The details  will be provided in the SAP. 
11.4.2.2 Analyses of secondary efficacy endpoints 
11.4.2.2.1 Analysis of the key secondary efficacy endpoint 
The proportion of patients achieving a reduction of 50% or greater in their OCS dose at Week 24 
compared with baseline will be analyzed using a logistic regression model.  The model will use 
the binary status of whether or not a patient achieved the 50% OCS dose reduction criterion as the response variable, and treatment groups, optimized OCS dose at baseline, regions (pooled countries), and baseline eosinophil level subgroups (<150 cells/ μL or 150 cells/ μL) as covariates.  
For patients who permanently discontinue the treatment, their final dose used for the primary efficacy endpoint will be used to determine whether or not they achieve the OCS dose reduction 
criterion. 
11.4.2.2.2 Analysis of the absolute reduction of OCS dose  
The absolute reduction of OCS dose at Week 24 will be analyzed using an ANCOVA model in 
the same fashion as for the primary endpoint, percent reduction of OCS dose at Week 24. 
11.4.2.2.3 Analysis of proportion of patients achieving a certain reduction of OCS dose 
The proportion of patients achieving a certain reduction of OCS dose will be analyzed in the same manner as the key secondary endpoint.  The model will use the binary status of whether or not a patient achieves the prespecified OCS dose reduction criterion as the response variable, and the treatment groups, optimized OCS dose at baseline, regions (pooled countries), and baseline eosinophil level subgroups (<150 cells/ μL or 150 cells/ μL) as covariates.  For patients who 
permanently discontinue the treatment, their final dose used for the primary efficacy endpoint will

model will include the total number of the events  occurring during the 24-week Treatment Period 
as the response variable, and the treatment groups, baseline optimized OCS dose strata, regions (pooled countries), number of the events within 1 year prior to the study, and baseline eosinophil level subgroups (<150 cells/ μL, 150 cells/ μL) as covariates.  Log-transformed treatment duration 
will be the offset variable.  For patients who pe rmanently discontinue the treatment, the events 
which occurred up to Week 24 will be included and th e last contact date at Week 24 will be used 
to calculate offset variable.  For patients who are lost to follow up prior to Week 24, events that occurred up to the last contact date will be anal yzed, and the last contac t date will be used to 
calculate the offset variable. 
11.4.2.3.2 Analysis of time to event variables 
Time to event parameters (eg, first severe asthma exacerbation, first exacerbation requiring hospitalization or ED visit) will be analyzed usin g a Cox regression model with the time to event 
as the response variable, and the treatment groups, baseline optimized OCS dose strata, regions (pooled countries), number of the events within 1 year prior to the study, and baseline eosinophil level subgroups (<150 cells/ μL, 150 cells/ μL) as covariates.  The Kaplan-Meier (KM) method 
will be used to derive the proportion of patients with an event at Weeks 12 and 24 specific to each 
treatment group.  For patients who are lost to follow up or who discontinue the study prior to Week 24, events that occurred up to the last contact date will be analyzed. 
11.4.2.3.3 Analysis of change/ percentage change from baseline for other continuous variables 
The change/percentage change from baseline for other continuous variables (eg, FEV 1, PEF, FVC, 
FEF 25-75% , ACQ, asthma symptom scores) will be analyzed using a mixed effect model with 
repeated measures (MMRM) approach.  For a continuous variable, the corresponding MMRM 
model will include the change/percent change from baseline as response variables, and factors (fixed effects) for the treatment groups, baseline optimized OCS dose strata, regions (pooled 
countries), baseline eosinophil level subgroups (<150 cells/ PL, 150 cells/ PL) visits, 
treatment-by-visit interaction, the corresponding baseline value of the endpoint, and baseline-by-visit interaction.  Additionally, age, gender, and height will be included as covariates 
in the models for spirometry variables but not for other variables.  An unstructured correlation 
matrix will be used to model the within-patie nt errors.  Parameters will be estimated using 
restricted maximum likelihood method with the Newton-Raphson algorithm.  Statistical inferences on treatment comparisons for an endpoint will be derived from the corresponding mixed-effect model.

Property of the Sanofi Group - Page 107 11.4.2.4 Multiplicity considerations 
The primary endpoint will be tested at a 2-sided 5% significance level.  If the primary endpoint 
meets the significance level, the following secondary endpoints will be tested at a 2-sided 5% significance level in the hierar chical order defined below: 
xProportion of patients achieving a reduction of 50% or greater in their OCS dose compared 
with baseline at Week 24 while  maintaining asthma control; 
xProportion of patients achieving a reduction of OCS dose to <5 mg/day at Week 24 while 
maintaining asthma control  
xProportion of patients achieving their maximum possible reduction of OCS dose per 
protocol at Week 24 while maintaining asthma control; 
xProportion of patients no longer requiring OCS at Week 24 while maintaining asthma 
control. 
11.4.3 Analyses of safety data 
The summary of safety results will be presented by treatment group.   
All safety analyses will be performed on the safety population using the following common rules: 
xThe baseline value is defined generally as the last available value before the first dose of 
study drug. 
xThe following definitions will be applied to laboratory parameters, vital signs and ECG. 
- The potentially clinically significant abnormality (PCSA) values are defined as 
abnormal values considered medically important by the Sponsor according to predefined criteria/thresholds based on a re view of the literature and defined by the 
Sponsor for clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG.  
- The criteria for PCSA will de termine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during the 
treatment-emergent period, taking into account all evaluations performed during the on-treatment period, including unscheduled or repeated evaluations.  The number of all such patients will be the numerator fo r the on-treatment PCSA percentage.   
11.4.3.1 Adverse events 
Adverse event incidence tables will present by system organ class (SOC) (sorted by 
internationally agreed order), high-level group term (HLGT), high level term (HLT), and preferred term (PT) sorted in alphabetical order for each treatment group, the number (n) and percentage (%) of patients experiencing an AE.  Multiple occurrences of the same event in the 
same patient will be coun ted only once in the tables within a treatment phase.  The denominator 
for computation of percentages is the safety population within each treatment group. 
The proportion of patients with at least 1 TEAE, serious TEAE, and TEAE leading to 
discontinuation of the study will be tabulated by treatment group.  In addition, TEAEs will be described according to maximum intensity and relation to the study drug.  Serious AEs and AEs

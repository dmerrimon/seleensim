 
 A Prospective Randomized Control Trial Comparing Preoperative Bilateral 
Superficial Cervical Plexus Block and Local Wound Infiltration Under General 
Anesthesia In Parathyroidectomy and Total and Partial Thyroidectomy  Principal Investigtors: Raymon H. Grogan M.D., Peter Angelos M.D., Ph.D., Edwin L. 
Kaplan M.D.   A. Study Abstract: Background: Administration of local anesthetic for cervical incisions has proven 
benefits in reduction of post -operative pain
iii, nausea, and vomitingiiiiv in 
prospective randomized controlled trials .  Methods of applying anesthetic to 
cervical incisions include bilateral superficial cervical plexus block (BSCPB) and local wound infiltration (LWI).  BSCPB involves the surgeon injecting 10 mL of 0.25% Marcaine solution just lateral to  the SCM at the level of the planned 
incision prior to the operation.  5 mL of the Marcaine solution are injected intradermaly while the remaining 5 mLs are injected 1 cm deep toward the planned incision.  This is then repeated on the contralateral side fo r a total 
injection of 20 mL of 0.25% Marcaine.  LWI involves injecting 20 mL of 0.25% marcaine solution intradermaly along the planned incision immediately prior to incision.  To date, there is no evidence suggesting one methodology’s superiority over the other.   Methods: A prospective randomized control trial will be performed at our 
institution evaluating patients receiving either BSCPB or LWI with either anesthetic or placebo.  The primary aim of this study will be to evaluate intra operative pain medication utilization, post -operative pain as well as pain 
medication use at various intervals during recovery.  Secondary aims include post-operative nausea and vomiting, perioperative sequela of BSCPB and LWI, return to work, total pain medication utilizati on, site of pain, and return to driving 
will be evaluated at the first post -operative visit. 
  1. Primary Hypothesis We hypothesize there is equivalent pain control between the two methods of local anesthetic administration when used in conjunction with a general 
anesthetic. 
  2. Purpose of Proposed Protocol The primary goal of the proposed study is to compare outcomes in prospective controlled fashion between BSCPB and LWI.  The collected data will include post -operative pain scores, nausea scores, number of 
episodes of emesis, unanticipated overnight observation, unanticipated admission, total pain medication utilization, time to return to work, and time to return to driving. 
 
 
 B. Prior Literature and Studies  
Numerous studies have examined various methods o f local pain management in 
neck surgery.  To date the data comparing BSCPBi ii iii iv ix, LWIvviviiviii, and placebo 
remain equivocal.  A recent meta-analysis of eight RCTs examining BSCPB 
versus various controls found a small but variable benefit to BSCPB the a uthors 
felt was not clinically significantix.  With such heterogeneity present in the data, 
however, continued studies adding to the power of available data and examining further variable such as post -operative nausea vomiting should be performed.  
Only a single study exists studying the effect of local analgesia and intraoperative pain medication utilization in thyroidectomy
x.  To our knowledge there are no 
RCTs comparing the efficacy of BSCPB to that of LWI. 
  C. Study Objectives 
 
 1. Primary Aim 
Compare intraoperative pain medication utilization between the four arms.  
 
2.  Secondary Aim Compare serial post-operative pain scores during hospital recovery, post -
operative analgesic use, nausea scores, number of episodes of emesis, 
unanticipated overnight obser vation, unanticipated admission, total pain 
medication utilization, time to return to work, and time to return to driving in a prospective fashion.  
  3. Rationale for Selection of Outcome Measures  
To date various studies have demonstrated variable results with local pain 
control therapies in conjunction with a general anesthetic.  If a benefit is demonstrated with either BSCPB or LWI it would suggest further study is warranted to determine an optimal pain control regimen for partial and total thyroidectomy procedures 
 D. Investigational Intervention Patients evaluated in the outpatient offices and who are scheduled and consented for a parathyroidectomy or partial or total thyroidectomy will be approached for the study.  After consenting to participate the pa tient will undergo 
his/her scheduled procedure.  A research coordinator will be in charge of collecting demographic, clinical, and operative data.  Patients will have a form (see Appendix A) attached to their chart that will be completed by the anesthesiologist postoperatively and by PACU/floor nursing postoperatively.  In addition, a questionnaire will be provided to the patient at their first follow up visit and be collected by the research coordinator at that time.  
 E. Study Design 
 
  1.  Overview 
This is a prospective randomized control trial examining post -operative 
pain, nausea, vomiting, return to activities of daily living.  The patients will be enrolled randomly into one of the  four arms of the study as follows:  BSCPB with anesthetic (0.25% marcaine ), BSCPB with placebo (saline), 
LWI with anesthetic (025% marcaine), and LWI with placebo.  BSCPB and LWI will be performed as described above.  The surgeon will be provided 2 syringes of 10 mLs of either 0.9% normal saline or 0.25% Marcaine solution in the operating room labeled with only the patient’s name and study ID number to be correlated to saline or Marcaine by the research coordinator.  The anesthesiologist or nurse anesthetist providing anesthesia with standardized fentanyl and versed preoperative ly (see 
appendix A), Fentanyl used at their discretion intraoperatively in conjunction with standardized inhalational anesthetic (Desflurane or Sevoflurane), and record the patient‘s medication requirements.  Patients 
will follow up as previously scheduled  1-2 weeks post operatively.  Clinical 
data from PACU and 24 hours observation stays will be accrued as well 
as a survey of post operative pain, nausea, and return to activities of daily living at the first follow up appointment.  
 2. Subject Selection and Withdrawal 
  a. Inclusion Criteria -Patient ≥ 18 years old
 
-Surgical indication for parathyroidectomy or thyroidectomy (benign 
or malignant pathologies)  
  b. Exclusion Criteria 
-Patients < 18 years old -Patient with history of chronic opioid use -Patient with chronic pain syndromes  
-Patient with allergy to marcaine, opioids, or inhalation anesthetic  
  c. Ethical Considerations  
-All races, gender, and ethnicities of patients may be enrolled in this study 
  d. Subject Recruitment Plans and Consent Process  
Patients who present with a disease process normally managed with the partial or total thyroidectomy will be presented with the study and given the choice of participation by the surgeon.  They will be informed of all aspects of the study procedure, risks and  
benefits, study schedule and requirements, including multiple questionnaires.  A written consent form will be provided.   Patients will be given considerable time to discuss the study with their family and to make their decision.  
  e. Early Withdrawal of Subjects Subjects may withdraw from participation in the research protocol at any time 
 3. Risks and Benefits 
 
   a. Risks 
Risks associated with surgery for which they consented, no new risks associated with study protocol or procedure, patients in the placebo arms may be introduced to more intra - and post-operative 
pain from the cervical incision and therefore require increased narcotic.  This risk is easily assessed and treated with narcotic pain medication they will already be receiving.  
  b. Benefits Benefits associated with surgery for which they consented, no new benefit associated with study protocol or procedure.

 G. Data Handling and Record Keeping  
We recognize the importance for confidentiality of the patient’s protected health 
information (PHI).  PHI will be collected and transferred only where necessary.  
Patients will be identified only by generic ID’s.   
 We require use of current passwords and log-on codes to protect sensitive data 
from unauthorized access. All system access requires a user name and 
password.  All users who require full access to the University of Chicago LAN must have a unique ID assigned. The LAN ID is used to control access to data 
files and applications that reside on the network. Every LAN ID is required to 
have a password assigned.  We require that all sensitive material be stored in a 
secure location when not in use. Study records will be maintained within the 
confines of the Surgical Research Office in locked cabinets.  
 
 
If study results are published, no personal inf ormation will be identified.  
 
 Study records will be retained for at least 2 years following trial closure.  
 H. Statistics and Data analysis 
 Parametric outcomes such as patient demographics will be  compared using 
analysis of variance and t -tests where appropriate.  Non-parametric outcomes 
such as intraoperative Fentanyl and pos t-operative pain scores will be  compared 
using Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA.  All statistical analysis will be performed using 
STATA 15 (College Station, TX).

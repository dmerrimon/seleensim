1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
In the setting of the opioid abuse epidemic, it has become even more important for 
anesthesiologists to seek alternative analgesics to treat perioperative pain. The use of 
peripheral nerve blocks and oral non -narcotic analgesics have helped reduce opioid 
consumption after total knee replacement (TKR) , but a highly successful low -dose opioid 
regimen, with the goal of being opioid free, for total knee replacements has not been 
achieved. Intraoperative auricular acupuncture may be a low -cost adjunctive therapy to 
assist in achieving a minimal opioid peri operative experience following TKR.  
 
In recent years, opioid abuse has skyrocketed in the United States, with more than 11 
million people misusing prescription opioids in 2016, including 2 million people abusing narcotics for the first time
1. A recent repo rt using data from the National Survey on Drug Use 
and Health from 2009 -2014 found that older adults who abuse narcotics are more likely to 
obtain them legally from their physicians2, including 40% of patients aged 50- 64 and almost 
50% of those over 65. Fr equently, these patients are first exposed to opioids during their 
perioperative course. One recent study reported 6% of opioid- naive patients became chronic 
users at 90 days after surgery3. Additionally, the Intraoperative use of opioids can lead to 
acute opioid tolerance and hyperalgesia that causes patients to require additional opioids 
postoperatively4,5. 
 With increasing use of regional anesthesia and non- opioid analgesics, the potential for 
“opioid- sparing” anesthesia has been considered and described  by various case reports
6-8 
randomized trials5,9. In addition to non- opioid analgesics, Auricular therapy has been studied 
as a method for relieving perioperative pain in a wide range of surgeries including IVF10, 
GI11, ENT12, and orthopedic procedures. In  a 2014 meta- analyses of 13 RCTs with 806 
subjects, a mean decrease in pain from auricular therapy was 1.59 standard deviations greater than that seen in the sham therapy group
13. Looking at studies focusing on 
orthopedic procedures, several positive repor ts of auricular therapy exist in the literature. In 
2005, Usichenko and colleagues reported on their pilot work using semi -permanent auricular 
needles for perioperative pain management of patients undergoing knee arthroscopy and 
total hip arthroplasty demonstrating reductions in postoperative analgesic requirements14-16. 
 Regional anesthesia and use of multimodal analgesia are well -known strategies for reducing 
opioid consumption after total joint replacement surgery. This study looks to extend the use 
of auricular therapy as part of a low opioid or opioid- sparing anesthetic regime for total knee 
replacements, and assist in achieving a low dose opioid maintenance perioperative course 
following the procedure.

2.0 OBJECTIVE (S) OF CLINICAL STUDY   
The feasibility of an opioid- minimizin g protocol that incorporates acupuncture for 
postoperative analgesia is unknown for patients undergoing total joint replacement. 
Furthermore, previous studies of acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy for postoperative 
analgesia have primarily investigated patient satisfaction rather than the impact on 
postoperative opioid consumption. The majority of studies also place acupuncture needles 
preoperatively, rather than following induction of anesthesia. We hope to show that placing 
auricular therapy needles int raoperatively is a feasible part of a protocol for motivated 
patients to minimize opioids after total knee arthroplasty.  
The majority of patients undergoing total knee replacement rely on opioids for postoperative 
analgesia. These medications have undesirable side effects and potential for abuse and 
addiction. The aim of this cohort study is to determine the incidence rate of patients who are 
able to maintain a low dose opioid regimen after TKR with the use of a multimodal approach that includes intraoperat ive auricular acupuncture protocol.  
1. Maintain a low dose opioid regimen (15 pills or less of 5mg oxycodones or 112.5 
OME) from POD 0 to POD 30 throughout their TKR.  
2. What are the NRS pain scores (numeric scale 0- 10) assessed in the PACU at spinal 
resolution.  Additional pain score assessments will be performed on postoperative 
days 1- 3 (approximately 24, 48, 72 hours postoperatively), postoperative day 14 (the 
first postoperative clinic visit) and postoperative day 30.  
3. What is the incidence of deviations from the intraoperative and postoperative pain 
regimen protocol, and what are those deviations? 
4. For those who exceed the low dose regimen, how many oxycodone (5mg) pills are 
used by these patients (as measured at each of the time points described in question 
2? 
5. How many patients require rescue intravenous narcotic?

Secondary aims of the study are to assess patient satisfaction with their overall 
perioperative pain control and the experience of the intraoperative auricular acupuncture in 
particular, and to determ ine the incidence of adverse events commonly associated with 
opioid use, specifically nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and constipation.  
1. How satisfied are patients with their overall perioperative pain control? 
2. How satisfied are patients with their experience w ith the auricular acupuncture?  
3. What is the incidence of each of the following: nausea, vomiting, pruritus, and constipation?  
3.0 STUDY HYPOTHESES 
This is a prospective cohort study to assess the feasibility of patients to undergo TKR while 
adhering to a low -dose opioid regimen by using a multimodal analgesic approach that 
includes intraoperative auricular acupuncture.  We hypothesize that it will be feasible to 
maintain a low -dose opioid regimen during TKR while following the intraoperative auricular 
acupuncture  protocol, and that patients will be satisfied with their pain control with a low 
incidence of adverse events.

6.0 PROCEDURES  
6.1 Intraoperative Protocol  
 
Following patient transfer to the operating room, neuraxial anesthesia (spinal or combined 
spinal epidural (CSE) with up to 4cc mepivacaine 1.5%) and two blocks for postoperative 
pain (IPACK and adductor canal peripheral nerve blocks) will be placed by the  
anesthesiologist. Each peripheral nerve block will be dosed with 15cc bupivacaine 0.5% with 2mg preservative free dexamethasone (30cc total). Sedation will be provided intraoperatively with midazolam (up to 5mg), ketamine (up to 50mg), ketorolac (up to 30 mg), 
and propofol (titrated to effect). Tranexemic acid (TXA) will be dosed per surgeon request.  
 
Once sedation has been deemed adequate by the anesthesiologist, a certified medical 
acupuncturist will perform ipsilateral Auricular Trauma Protocol (ATP) acupuncture at eight

ear points (Hypothalamus, Amygdala, Hippocampus, Prefrontal Cortex, Point Zero, Shen 
Men, Insula, Vagus) with 30Hz electrostimulation at two of those points (Shen Men and 
Hypothalamus). Acupuncture needles will be left in place and stimul ated for 60 min and then 
removed. If an epidural is placed, it may be re- dosed with lidocaine as needed (up to 100mg 
total) and will be removed prior to transfer to the recovery room.  
 
A periarticular injection (PAI) will be placed by the surgeon during t he surgery (timing at the 
discretion of the surgeon) and will include:  
• 30cc 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:100,000 Epi  
• 40mg of depomedrol (1cc)  
• 500mg cefazolin (10cc)  
• 20cc of 0.9% NaCl solution 
 
Postoperatively, all patients will receive oral dexamethasone 10mg every 8 hours (3 doses), 
intravenous ketorolac 15mg (7.5 if under 50kg) every 6 hours, and oral acetaminophen 
1000mg every 6 hours until discharged. For pain not controlled on this regimen, patients will 
be offered oral oxycodone, and intractable pain will  be treated at the discretion of the 
provider. After 24 hours, patients will be transitioned to and discharged on oral meloxicam 
7.5mg every 6 hours and oral acetaminophen 1000mg every 6 hours for thirty days. The PA 
or fellow working with the surgeon will  place a discharge order for 42 oxycodone 5mg with 
no refills. Patients will be discharged with Mobic 15mg (7.5 if under 50kg) and acetaminophen 500mg.  
 
NRS pain scores (numeric scale 0- 10) will be assessed at spinal resolution in the PACU. 
postoperative admission. Additional pain score assessments will be performed on 
postoperative days 1, postoperative day 14 (the first postoperative clinic visit) and 
postoperative day 30. In addition, at each of those times, the number of oxycodone pills 
used (5mg each) or the MME, any deviations from the standing oral pain medication 
regimen (e.g., early discontinuation of ketorolac or acetaminophen), and any adverse events 
(e.g., postoperative nausea or vomiting, bleeding, pruritus) will be assessed.

• Total sample size required: 37 +4 (10% attrition rate)= 41  
 
Proportion (27.8%) comes from practice data by one anesthesiologist who also practices 
medical acupuncture (Dr. Stephanie Cheng) and one surgeon (Dr. Michael Ast) on patients 
undergoing TK R from October to December 2018.  
 
Null proportion (9%) comes from unpublished study (PI: Dr Todd Albert, 2018, “Opioid consumption and disposal patterns after total knee arthroplasty as characterized by a novel mobile phone text messaging platform.”). The purpose of getting the null proportion is to see 
what percentage of patients can maintain a minimal opioid consumption after TKR without a 
controlled multimodal analgesic approach that includes intraoperative auricular therapy.  
 
Primary outcome: the percentage of patients who can maintain a low -dose opioid regimen 
(15 pills or less of 5mg oxycodone or the OME) from POD 0 to POD 30 throughout their TKR will be compared to 9% using a one- sample test of proportion (Z -test).  
 Secondary outcomes (listed above) measured once per patient will be analyzed by t -test or 
Wilcoxon rank -sum test (continuous data) and χ2 or Fisher’s exact test (categorical data). 
Outcomes measured multiple times per patient will be analyzed using regression based on a generalized estimat ing equation approach.

PHASE  Phase 2  
PROTOCOL TITLE  A Multicenter, 6 -Week, Double -blind,  Randomized, Placebo -controlled, Parallel -
design Study to Assess the Efficacy and Safety of NFC -1 in Adolescents 
(Ages  12-17 Years) with Genetic Disorders Impacting Metabotropic Glutamate 
Receptors and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder  
INDICATION  Genetic disorders impacting metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) in subjects 
with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)  
OBJECTIVES  The objectives of this study are:  
 To assess the efficacy of NFC -1 relative to placebo in reducing the severity of 
symptoms associated with ADHD in adolescents with genetic disorders 
impacting mGluRs . 
 To obtain additional safety data following exposure to NFC -1 in this 
population . 
STUDY DE SIGN  This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group study of 
adolescents with ADHD who have genetic disorders impacting mGluRs.  
Approximately 90 subjects will receive randomized treatment with NFC -1 or placebo.  
Dosing will be opti mized during the first 4 weeks of treatment , based on clinical 
response and tolerability , and maintained for an additional 2 weeks when the primary 
assessments of efficacy and tolerability will be performed.  A follow -up telephone 
call will be performed at  Week 7. 
PLANNED NUMBER 
OF SUBJECTS  Ninety subjects are planned to  be enrolled.  It is anticipated that this will yield 
80 subjects who will complete the study as planned.

TREATMENT  All ADHD medications will be discontinued prior to starting this study.  There will be 
a wash -out phase of 5 days for stimulants and 14 days for atomoxetine and 
noradrenergic agonists.  Subjects will not start any new ADHD medication during the 
study.  Due  to their potential to interfere with safety, efficacy, or tolerability 
assessments, the following medications are prohibited: norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitors, anxiolytic or sedative hypnotic medications, antidepressants, clonidine, 
guanfacine, mood sta bilizers (including lithium, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics), 
antihypertensive agents, psychostimulants, sedating antihistamines, and 
investigational compounds.  As NFC -1 is a potential inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4, 
2B6 and 2D6 , medications that are metabolized by these enzymes are prohibited.

INVESTIGATOR   
PLANNED STUDY 
SITES  Approximately 35 sites in North America  
CRITERIA FOR 
EVALUATION  Response to treatment will be assessed with tools commonly use d in ADHD research.  
These include ADHD -RS-5, Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale  (ASHS ), Screen for 
Childhood Anxiety -related Emotional Disorders (SCARED ), and Clinical Global 
Impression of Severity (CGI -S) and Improvement (CGI -I). 
Safety and tolerability will  be assessed by the frequency and severity of adverse 
events (AEs) as well as the evaluation of changes in clinical laboratory values, vital 
signs, ECG recordings, and C -SSRS.  
STATISTICAL 
METHODS  Efficacy:  
The primary endpoint for the assessment of efficacy will be the ADHD -RS-5 score.  
Secondary endpoints will include the CGI -S, ASHS, and SCARED .  The analysis will 
be based on changes from the baseline value and will test the hypothesis that there is 
no difference between the treatments (ie, that th e difference is 0) against a 2 -tailed 
alternative.  Further exploratory analyses may be performed that include additional 
independent factors (eg, age, gender, and/or maintenance dose of study drug)  as well 
as covariates that are determined to be associated with the experimental results 
(eg, baseline value of the dependent variable ).  All quantitative endpoints will be 
described with traditional summary statistics and tabulated by treatment group and 
visit.  
Safety:  
Adverse events will be coded with the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs  
(MedDRA)  and tabulated by system organ class and preferred term.  Adverse events 
will be analyzed by frequency, severity, relationship to IP, and their effect on 
participation in the study.  
Clinical laboratory values will be compared to normal ranges and flagged for levels of 
clinical concern.  The analysis will focus on the frequencies of abnormal values as 
well as within -subject changes observed during the course of the study.  
Vital signs an d ECG recordings will also be examined for changes during the study 
that may be attributed to exposure to IP. 
The C -SSRS will also be examined for changes that may be attributed to exposure to 
IP. 
SAMPLE SIZE 
DETERMINATION  Enrollment of 90 subjects is exp ected to yield 80 subjects who complete the study  as 
planned.  Assuming an effect size of 0.7, this number  will provide approximately 
90% power to detect a significant difference between the treatments based on a 
2-tailed α = 0.05 comparison of mean change  from Baseline.  
STUDY AND 
TREATMENT 
DURATION  The sequence and maximum duration of the study periods will be as follows:  
 Screening period: approximately 21 days . 
 Wash -out period: if applicable, up to 14 days . 
 Dose optimization phase: 28 days . 
 Dose maintenance phase: 14 days . 
 Follow -up: 7 days ( +5 days) after the last dose of IP. 
 The maximum study duration for each subject is approximately 70 days.  
 The maximum treatment duration for each subject is 42 days.

NS FOR AMENDMENT 
The protocol was amended due to receipt of in vitro data indicating the potential of NFC-1 to be 
an inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4, 2B6 and 2D6. As such, the concomitant administration of 
NFC-1 with drugs that are metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2B6, or CYP2D6 could potentially 
reduce the therapeutic effect of those drugs. The following changes were made to the protocol:  
1. Me dications that may potentially be impacted by the interaction with NFC-1 are now 
prohibited.  
2. The  wording related to medication usage during the study to manage anxiety, mood 
disorders, ADHD, and symptoms of autism was removed as this information is repetitive 
with the bullet points that followed.

AD-MW-07.04 29- Mar-2013   Page 17 of 58 5. INTRODUC TION 
5.1 B ackground and Rationale 
Several candidate genes related to dopamine and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems are 
associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD) severity and subtypes 
(persistence, comorbidity, functional impairment, and treatment effects), such as DAT1 , DRD4, 
M
AO-A , ADRA2A , ADRA2C , NET , a nd COMT .  Recently, a large-scale, genome-wide study 
comparing copy number variations (CNVs) in 3,500  ADHD cases versus approximately 
13,000
 controls revealed that rare, recurring CNVs impacting specific glutamate receptor 
metabotropic (GRM) gen
es (ie, GRM1, GRM5, GRM7, and GRM8) were found in patients with 
ADHD at significantly higher frequencies compared to healthy controls.  
Originally developed by Nippon Shinyaku Co., fasoracetam monohydrate (NFC-1, previously 
referre
d to as NS-105) is an important candidate to explore for use in restoring metabotropic 
glutamate rec
eptors (mGluR s) activity in patients with ADHD exhibiting mGluR hypofunction.  
I
t has been shown to improve symptoms of depression and memory/learning in animal models.  
The drug activity is based on regulating the intracellular adenylyl cyclase-activity stimulated by 
mGluRs and works by inhibiting the brain gamma-aminobutyric acid B (GABA) receptor 
stimulus response and enha
ncing the beta-adrenergic receptor response and the acetylcholine-
mediated neurologic system response ( 1). 
Data from animal m
odels, pharmacotherapeutic interventions, and brain and genetic studies in 
humans implicate glutamatergic system involvement in ADHD pathophysiology.  Interventions 
specifically targeting this system remain to be developed even though a recent, large-scale, 
genome-wide study revealed that rare, recurring CNVs impacting genes in the glutamatergic 
network (ie, GRM1, GR
M5, GRM7, and GRM8 ) were detected in approximately 10% of the total 
ADHD cases ( 2). 
Published preclinical studies indicate that NFC-1 exerts its bioactivity through mGluRs ( 3, 4, 5).  
NF
C-1 was also found to be efficacious in ameliorating learning and memory impairment, which 
can be interpreted in the context of improved attention span, and in reducing locomotor activity, 
which is a correlate of hyperactivity ( 6).  Thus, NFC-1 may be a potentially effective therapeutic 
a
gent in the subgroup of patients with ADHD identified through genetic profiling with variants 
in the GRM network that the sponsor is leve
raging as a biomarker indicative of the mGluR 
signaling pathway being disrupted. 
5.2 Clin ical Experience 
Previously, NFC-1 was in phase 3 development for adults with cerebrovascular diseases and 
dementia.  The previous sponsor (Nippon Shinyaku Co., Ltd.) performed the following studies: 
 Phase 1 dose-finding and pharmacokinetic study in healthy volunteers. 
 Phase 2 studies in subject s with residual symptoms following cerebral infarct or cerebral 
hemorrhage. 
 P hase 3 study in subjects with cerebrovascular diseases and dementia. 
Exposure to NFC-1 in the
se studies is presented in Table 1.

recommended do se obtained during dose finding ( 200 mg). 
c Relationship to study treatment was categorized as unknown. 
 
Nippon Shinyaku terminated development because the phase 3 study failed to meet the defined 
efficacy e
ndpoints.  Although a written report is unavailable, information in the Investigator’s 
Brochure (IB) ( 1) for this phase 3 study indicated that NFC-1 was well-tolerated over 8 weeks of 
c
ontinuous daily dosin
g at doses up to 450 mg/day.  The most frequently reported adverse events 
(AEs) were nausea (2% of subjects) and laboratory abnormalities including elevated liver 
function tests, including alanine aminotransferase , aspartate aminotransferase, and alkaline 
phosphatase (in 3% of the subj
ects each), and elevated creatinine kinase (in 1% of the subjects). 
Research ha
s also been conducted on NFC-1 in adolescents with ADHD.  The recently 
completed NFC1
-2014 trial was a 30-subject phase 1b study that evaluated adolescents with 
ADHD and disruptions in the mGluR
 gene network.  The objectives of the study were to 
evaluate the safety, tolerability, and single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of NFC-1 and to 
evaluate the eff
ect of NFC-1 on ADHD during 4 weeks of continuous treatment (at doses up to 
400 mg twice daily) following 1 week of placebo therapy. 
The study was condu
cted at the Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.  
S
ubjects were classified into three tiers, based on their mGluR mutations.  During the dose 
escalation phase of this stud
y, NFC-1 was well tolerated with no treatment-related serious 
adverse events (SAEs) reported.  All AEs were mild to moderate, and the most frequently 
reported treatm
ent-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were headaches in 17/30 subjects (56.7%),

tigue in 9/30 subjects (30.0%), upper abdominal pain in 7/30 subjects (23.3%), and irritability 
in 6/30 subjects (20.0%). 
I
n addition to several exploratory measures, efficacy was assessed using the Clinical Global 
Impression of Se
verity (CGI-S) and Improvement (CGI-I) scales, and the Vanderbilt Parent 
Assessment Score.  Clinical improvement, based on the CGI-S, CGI-I, and Vanderbilt scores, 
was demonstrated in ana
lyses of all subjects.  Improvement in the mean scores after 4 weeks of 
active treatment w as observed as follows: CGI-S scores decreased from 3.97 to 3.00 ( P < 0.001), 
C
GI-I scores decreased from 3.83 to 2.24 ( P < 0.001), and the Vanderbilt score decreased from 
29.1 to 22.5 ( P < 0.001).  Improvement was greatest in the Tier-1/Tier-2 mGluR mutation 
posi
tive subjects ( P < 0.001).  In this group, 80% of the subjects were deemed to be responders 
(de
fined a
s at least a 25% improvement in the Vanderbilt Score).  Approximately half of the 
participants opted to participa
te in the currently ongoing open-label extension study of NFC-1. 
5.3 S ummary of Potential Risks and Benefits 
The potential benefits of study participation are that mGluRs mutation-positive subjects with 
ADHD (1) may ex
perience a reduction in symptoms as a result of treatment with NFC-1 and 
(2) will understand that they are contributing to the scientific knowledge that may lead to 
e
xpansion of the treatment options for patients with genetic disorders impacting mGluRs 
together with ADHD.  No other benefits of participation are anticipated. 
The potential risks of study participation include those associated with exposure to NFC-1 and 
the risks of medical eval
uation, including venipuncture. 
A summary of the pharmaceutical properties and known potential risks of NFC-1 is provided in 
the current version of the
 IB (1).  The investigator must become familiar with all sections of the 
NF
C-1 IB before the start of the study. 
6. OBJECTIVES 
The objectives of this study are: 
 To assess the efficacy of NFC-1 relative to placebo in reducing the severity of symptoms 
associated with ADHD in adolescents with genetic disorders impacting mGluRs. 
 To obtain additional safety data following exposure to NFC-1 in this population. 
7. S TUDY DESIGN 
7.1 Over all Study Design and Plan 
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group phase 2 study of 
adolescents to compare the safety and efficacy of NFC-1 with that of placebo.  Approximately 
90 male and female subjects will receive randomized treatment with NFC-1 or placebo to obtain 
80 subjects that complete the study as planned.  Subjects must be ≥ 12 to ≤ 17 years of age and 
have ADHD as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition 
(DSM-5) and Version 5 of the Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Rating Scale 
(ADHD- RS-5) > 28 at Baseline with or without conventional ADHD therapy. 
S
ubjects will not be eli
gible if they are mentally or legally incapacitated, have significant 
e
motional problems, have a prior diagnosis of co-morbid major psychiatric disorders or any 
clinically sig
nificant medical condition that would interfere with the conduct of study 
evaluations, are pregnant or nursing, and/or have abnormal laboratory values that indicate 
clinically significant endocrine, gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hematological, hepatic, 
immunological, renal, respiratory, or genitourinary abnormalities or diseases.

AD-MW-07.04 29- Mar-2013   Page 20 of 58 As shown in
 Figure 7.1, subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either NFC-1 or placebo 
on Day -1 and 
will start taking the investigational product ( IP) at a dose of 100 mg twice daily on 
Da
y 1.  Dosing will be optimized to 100 mg , 200  mg, or 400 mg twice daily, as appropriate, over 
the
 4 weeks of treatment (dose optimization phase), based on clinical response and tolerability.  
I
f the subject tolerates a dose well, the dose will be maintained for an additional 2 weeks (dose 
maintenance phase) whe
n the primary assessments of efficacy and tolerability will be performed.  
A follow-up telephone call will be performed at Week 7. 
Approximately 45 subje
cts will be randomly assigned to  each treatment group.  The duration of 
stud
y participation
 is expected to be 70 days. 
Efficacy will be
 assessed by the ADHD- RS-5 score, CGI-I, CGI-S, Adolescent Sleep Hygiene 
Scale (ASHS), a
nd Screen for Childhood Anxiety-related Emotional Disorders (SCARED). 
Safety
 will be
 assessed by evaluating AEs, physical examination findings, vital sign 
measurements, electrocardiograms (ECGs), clinical laboratory test results, and Columbia Suicide 
Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) scores. 
All AEs observed by the study pe
rsonnel or reported by the subject during the study (from the 
time of the signing of the informed consent through the posttreatment visit) will be documented.

AD-MW-07.04 29- Mar-2013   Page 21 of 58 7.2 Disc ussion of Study Design 
The randomized, double-blind, parallel group design chosen for this study is standard for the 
head -to-head comparison of treatments.  After assessing the baseline status of the disease (in the 
absence of study drug), the 4-week dose titration paradigm allows for individualized dose 
optimization.  This i
s the norm for pharmacological interventions in neuropsychiatric indications.  
The subsequent 2-week maintenance period will allow stabilization of drug effect(s) prior to 
assessing the disease
 status at the end of the treatment (ie, the primary endpoint in this study). 
7.3 S tudy Site(s) 
The study will take place at approximately 35 sites in the United States.  Each site is anticipated 
to screen a suff
icient number of subjects to be able to randomize approximately 2-3 subjects.  
A study s ite with a high recruitment rate may be allowed to recruit more subjects if other sites 
ha
ve slow enrollment

8. S UBJECT POPULATION 
8.1 S election of Study Population 
Approximately 90 subjects will be randomized.  It is anticipated that this will yield 80 subjects

8.3 P remature Subject Withdrawal 
All subjects will be advised that they are free to withdraw from participation in this study at any 
time, for any reason, and without prejudice.  Every reasonable attempt should be made by the 
investigator to keep subj
ects in the study; however, subjects must be withdrawn from the study if 
they withdraw consent to participate.  Investigators must attempt to contact subjects who fail to 
attend scheduled visits by
 telephone or other means to exclude the possibility of an AE being the 
cause of withdrawal.  Should this be the cause, the AE must be documented, reported, and 
followed as described in S
ection 11.2. 
The
 sponsor reserves the right to request the withdrawal of a subject due to protocol violations or 
other reasons. 
The investigator also has the right to withdraw subjects from the study at any time for lack of 
therapeutic effect that is intolerable or otherwise unacceptable to the subject, for intolerable or 
unacceptable AEs, int
ercurrent illness, noncompliance with study procedures, administrative 
reasons, or in the investigator’s opinion, to protect the subject’s best interest. 
If a subject is withdrawn before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal and the date of 
discontinuation will be 
recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).  
Whenever possible a
nd reasonable, the evaluations that were to be conducted at the completion 
of the study should be pe
rformed at the time of premature discontinuation. 
8.4 Subject Replacement Criteria 
Once randomized, subjects who discontinue from the study will not be replaced.

9.2.2 P ackaging 
NFC-1 and placebo will be supplied by the sponsor.  NFC-1 will be packaged in high-density 
polyethylen
e bottles of 20 capsules. NFC-1 and placebo will be packaged so that the investigator, 
the stud
y clinic personnel, and subje
cts are blinded to study treatment. 
9.3 T reatments Administered 
Eligible subjects will be randomized to either NFC-1 or placebo for 6 weeks of treatment; a 
4-week stepwise dose-optimization period will be followed by a 2-week maintenance period. 
NFC-1 or placebo will be administered twice daily for a maximum of 6 weeks.  At Baseline, 
randomized subjec
ts will receive blinded IP to begin treatment the following day at a dose of 
100 mg twice daily.  Doses will be optimized to 100 mg , 200 mg , or 400 mg twice daily over the 
following 4 weeks as de
termined by the investigator’s assessment of clinical response and 
tolerability to 
IP.  Additional dose adjustments will not be allowed after Week 4, and if well 
tolerate
d, subjects will be maintained at their Week-4 dose. 
The objective of this period is to ensure subjects are titrated to an optimal dose of IP based upon 
the investigator’s review of efficacy, AEs, and clinical judgment.

AD-MW-07.04 29- Mar-2013   Page 25 of 58 9.4 Disp ensing and Storage 
The IP supplied by Medgenics is to be used exclusively in th is clinical study according to the 
inst
ructions of this protocol.  The investigator is responsible for dispensing the IP according to 
the dosage scheme and for e
nsuring proper storage of the IP. 
The investigator must confirm the receipt of the IP with his/her signature.  A copy of this receipt 
must be kept by the investigator, and another copy will be stored at Medgenics and/or  
.  Until the IP
 is dispensed to the subjects, it must be stored at 20-25°C and in a dry 
place in a securely
 locked area that is not generally accessible. 
The key to the storage area is to be kept by the investigator or designee responsible for the IP.  
The storage area will be accessible only to those persons authorized by the investigator to 
dispense the IP. 
9.4.1 In teractive Web Response System for Investigational Product Management 
An Interactive Web Response System (IWRS) will be employed in this study to register and 
randomize subjects, maintain the blind during the study, provide a mechanism for unblinding, 
dispense and manage investigational product, and track final subject disposition (ie, study 
completion or discontinuation). 
A user manual with specific functions and instructions for the IWRS will be provided to the site. 
9.5 M ethod of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups 
In this parallel-group randomized study, subjects who meet study entry criteria will be randomly 
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to NFC-1 or placebo.  The randomization schedule will be computer-
generat
ed using a permuted block algorithm and will randomly allocate IP to randomization 
numbers.  The randomization numbers will be assigned sequentially through the central IWRS as 
subjects are enter
ed into the study. 
The randomization schedule will be prepared by  in advance of study initiation.  
All efforts will be made to ensure the integrity of the study blind up until the final database has 
been locked.  No one involved in study conduct will have access to the randomization schedule 
prior to that even t.  No subject will be randomized into this study more than once. 
9.6 B linding and Unblinding Treatment Assignment 
All su
bjects, investigator
s, and study personnel involved in the conduct of the study, including 
data management, will be blinded to treatment assignment with the exception of a specified 
unblinded statistician from  who will have access to the randomization code.  
The unblinded study pe
rsonnel will not otherwise participate in study procedures or data analysis 
prior to unblinding of the study data to all study related personnel. 
Study personnel will endeavor to safeguard the integrity of the study blind to minimize bias in 
the conduct of the study.  Treatment unblinding is discouraged if knowledge of the treatment 
assignment will not materia
lly change the planned management of a medical emergency.  
Unblinding will be permitted in a medical emergency that requires immediate knowledge of the 
subject’s treatment assignment. Unblinding should be discussed in advance with the medical 
monitor if possible.  For emergency unblinding, study personnel will access the IWRS 
unblinding module.  If the
 investigator is not able to discuss treatment unblinding in advance, 
then he/she must notify the medic
al monitor as soon as possible about the unblinding incident 
without revealing the subject’s treatment assignment.  The investigator or designee must record 
the date and reason for study
 discontinuation on the appropriate eCRF for that subject.  In all

ases that are not emergencies, the investigator should discuss the event with the medical 
monitor prior to unblinding the subjec
t’s treatment assignment. 
If treatment assignment is unblinded for an individual subject, study personnel will be notified of 
that subj
ect’s treatment assignment without unblinding the treatment assignments for the 
remaining subjects in the study.  Thus, the overall study blind will not be compromised.  If a 
subject’s treatme
nt assignment is unblinded, he/she may or may not be asked to withdraw from 
the study.  The investigator will make this decision after consultation with the medical monitor. 
9.7 S election of Doses in the Study 
Doses of 100 mg , 200 mg , or 400 mg twice daily will be administered in this study.  These doses 
were found to be safe and well tolerated in a phase 1 study of adolescents with ADHD. 
Previous PK studies in both healthy adults (aged 26 to 48 years) and young adults (aged 20 to 
32 years) showed an elimination half-life (t ½) o f about 4 hours.  In view of the short half-life, 
twice daily dosing is expected to provide a more consistent pharmacologic effect throughout the 
day. 
Administration of single oral doses of 100 mg NFC-1 after a meal to young adults (aged 20 to 
32 years) showed rapid absorption (time to maximum plasma concentration [T max] fr om 0.6 to 
1.5 hours), dose-proportional increases in exposure, and a t ½ of 3.7 to 4.4 hours in healthy male 
a
dults.  Comparison of dose
s administered under fed and fasted conditions to healthy male adults 
showed that food caused slowe
r absorption (T max of 1.5 versus 0.7 hours) and decreased the 
m
aximum observed plasma concentration (C max) (4.14 versus 5.65 μg/mL), but no difference in 
the 
area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated from time 0 to infinity ( AUC 0-∞) 
(29.3 versus 31.3 μg  h/mL) and t ½ (4.2 versus 4.3 hours).  In separate studies, similar 
PK parameters were obtained following administration of 100 mg NFC-1 to healthy male adults 
a
nd young adults, respectively, with T max of 1.0 versus 1.2 hours, C max of 2.57 versus 
2.14 μg/mL, AUC 0 -∞ of 17.0 versus 14.0 μg  h/mL, and t ½ of 4.4 versus 4.4 hours. 
Preliminary
 evaluation of PK data from the recent adolescent PK study is consistent with 
previous PK data and de
monstrated a linear dose/concentration profile with a t ½ of 
a
pproximately 4 hours. 
9.8 S election of Timing of Dose for Each Subject 
NFC-1 or matching placebo is to be taken orally twice daily during the treatment period (in the 
morning upon awakening [7:00 a.m.
to 9:00 a.m.] and in the mid-afternoon [between 3:00 p.m.to 
5:00 p.m.]) and can be taken in the fed or fasting state. 
9.9 Dose  Adjustment Criteria 
The duration of the dose-optimization period is 4 weeks to allow for up-titration to the highest 
dose and no more than one down-
titration to the previous dose, if necessary. 
Subjects will be instructed to take NF
C-1 or placebo each morning upon awakening (at 7:00 a.m. 
to 9:00 a.m.) and in the mid-
afternoon (3:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.).  On Day 1, all subjects will begin 
taking NFC-1 or plac
ebo and will be evaluated after 7 days (± 2 days) for tolerability and 
effecti
veness.  Subjects may be titrated weekly to the next available dose strength after 7 days 
(± 2 days) on the previous dose, based on the overall response of the subject.  Additionally, if 
ne
eded, a subje
ct may be down-titrated to the previous dose level in order to optimize tolerability 
and efficacy.  Subject response will be categorized by the investigator as 1 of 3 conditions and 
associated actions, with ti
tration continuing until an “acceptable response” is achieved.  These 
conditions are defined as follows: 
Medgenics, Inc. Confidential  
MDGN-NFC1-ADHD- 201 
 
27 Oct 2016 Version: Final Version v4.0 
AD-MW-07.04 29- Mar-2013   Page 27 of 58 Intolerable response (ie, intolerable side effects):  Requires the subject to be tapered to a lower 
dose of NFC-1 (if available).  However, if this lower dose produces an intolerable response as 
well, the subject should be discontinued from the study. 
Ineffective response:  The subject is not showing a significant reduction in symptoms, and 
requires increasing titration of NFC-1 to the next available dose strength, provided tolerability is 
acceptable, followed by weekly evaluation. 
Acceptable response:  A response is defined as acceptable if it shows a significant reduction in 
symptoms with tolerable side effects.  Subjects categorized as “acceptable” may be maintained at 
their current dose for the remainder of the optimization period. Subjects who are tolerating study 
medication at the
 highest available dose but do not achieve an acceptable response should 
continue in the trial at that dose. 
Further, if the “acceptable” dose is well tolerated and, in the opinion of the investigator, the 
subject would potentially receive additional symptom reduction, the dose may be increased to the 
next higher dose level. 
If the subject expe
riences unacceptable intolerability, in the opinion of the investigator, the dose 
may be reduced (if available) by 1 dose level (to the previous dose).  If the subject tolerates the 
dose reduction well and maintains symptom control, the subject may be maintained at that 
reduced dose for the remainder of the optimization period (through Visit 6).  
Only 1 dose reducti
on is permitted during the optimization period.  Visit 5 will be the last visit at 
which titration can occur.  Once a subject has reached an optimal dose, this dose will be 
maintained for the remainder of
 the dose-optimization phase of the study (through Visit 6).  
Subjects who are unable to tolerate the IP will be discontinued.  After the dose optimization 
period, subjects will continue to receive the current optimized dose of IP for an additional 
2 weeks.  A 7-day follow-up call will occur after discontinuing study treatment. 
S
ubjects who discontinue bec
ause they are unable to tolerate the IP must complete all early 
termination (ET) visit
 assessments required during the last study visit. These subjects will also 
receive a 7-
day follow-up call after discontinuing study treatment. 
9.10 Dr ug Accountability 
The investigator must maintain adequate records showing the receipt, dispensing, return, or other 
disposition of the IP including the date, quantity, batch or code number, and identification of 
subjects (subject number and initials) who received the IP.  The investigator will not supply the 
IP to any person e
xcept those named as subinvestigators on the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) F
orm FDA 1572, designated study personnel, and subjects in this study.  
The investigator will not
 dispense the IP from any study sites other than those listed on Form 
FDA 1572.  IP(s) may not be relabeled or reassigned for use by other subjects.  If any of the IP is 
not di
spensed; is lost, st
olen, spilled, unusable, or is received in a damaged container, this 
information must be documented and re
ported to Medgenics and appropriate regulatory agencies, 
as required. 
Upon compl
etion of the study, the IP (partly used, unused, and empty packaging [eg, bottles] ) 
must be left in the original packaging and returned to the sponsor or designee for destruction. 
9.11 T reatment Compliance 
Treatment compliance with IP regimens will be assessed by study personnel via capsule counts 
of returned medication and by questioning the subject, if necessary, at every post-baseline visit.  
A subject who is not compliant (taken < 80% or > 100% of IP) will be counseled at each visit on

nce of taking IP as instructed.  A subject who is noncompliant on 3 consecutive visits 
will be discharged f
rom the study. 
9.12 P ermitted and Prohibited Therapies 
All concomitant medications used (including
 over-the-counter [OTC] medications) will be 
recorded in the sourc
e document and on the appropriate eCRF. 
9.12.1 Permitted Therapies 
Ongoing behavioral therapies, including individual cognitive behavioral therapy, group cognitive 
behavioral therapy, social effectiveness training, ADHD behavioral therapy, or applied 
behavioral analy
sis are allowed and must be maintained at the same frequency/intensity as at 
Screening.  The initiation of new behavioral therapies is not allowed. 
The use of inhaled bronchodilators is allowed, if needed.  Antibiotics and OTC medications that 
do not affect blood press
ure, heart rate, or the central nervous system, which are considered 
necessary
 for the subject’s welfare, may be administered at the discretion of the investigator.   
The administration of
 all such medication must be recorded in the appropriate section of the 
source documentation and eCRF.  Non-sedating antihistamines such as Allegra® are allowed, as 
a
re OTC non-stimulant cold remedies such as guaifenesin. 
The
 use of inhaled ste
roids (corticosteroids ) for asthma is allowed. 
9.12.2
 Prohibited Therapies 
All ADH
D medications will be discontinued prior to starting this study.  There will be a wash-
out phase of 5 days for stimulants and 14 days for atomoxetine and noradrenergic agonists.  
Study subjects wil
l not start any new ADHD medication during the study.  Due to their potential 
to interfere with safety, efficacy, or tolerability assessments, the following medications are 
prohibited during the study: 
 Any medication which is a substrate of CYP3A4, CYP2B6 or CYP2D6.  
 Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. 
 Anx iolytic or sedative hypnotic medications. 
 Antidepr essants, tricyclic antidepressants , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), 
selective norepinephr
ine reuptake inhibitors including atomoxetine (Strattera).

The ADHD- RS-5 (7) wil l be used as the primary measure.  Th is parent-reported clinician-rated 
sc
ale will be administered at each visit, beginning at Screening to capture the ADHD symptoms 
withi
n each study 
week.  The ADHD- RS-5 is a parent-reported/clinician-rated scale that was 
de
veloped to measure the
 behaviors of children with ADHD, and comes in a Home Version and 
a School Version, with separate forms for children (ages 5-10 years) and adolescents (11-17 
years); it c
onsists of 18 items designed to reflect the symptomatology of ADHD based on the 
Diagnostic and S
tatistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) DSM-5  criteria.  Each item will 
be scored on a ran
ge of 0 (re flecting no symptoms) to 3 (reflecting severe symptoms) with total 
scores ranging
 from 0-54. The 18 items may be grouped into 2 subscales: inattention and 
hyperacti
vity
/impulsivity.  The Inattention subscale raw score is computed by summing the item 
scores for Items 1–9. 
 The Hyperactivity–Impulsivity subscale  raw score is computed by 
summing the item scores for Items 10–18. Additionally, the ADHD- RS-5 incorporates 2 
im
pairment scales keyed to the inattention and hyperactivity–impulsivity dimensions, which 
allow the clinician to 
assess the extent to which ADHD-related problems adversely affect the 
home and/or school functioning of children and adolescents 
Time of administration: 10-15 minutes  
10.3.2.2 Clinical Global Impre
ssion-Improvement and Severity Scales 
The CGI-I and CGI-S scales will be used as a secondary outcome measure for estimating level of 
functioning in response to NFC-1 treatment.  These scales record the investigator’s global 
assessment of the se
verity of the symptoms and changes in symptoms from Baseline based on 
reports from parents, subject, and minimal direct observation ( 8).  This assessment will guide the 
investi
gator during dosing adjustments.

10.3.2.3 Adolescent Sleep Hygiene Scale 
The ASHS is  a self-report questionnaire assessing sleep practices theoretically important for 
optimal sleep in adolescents 
aged ≥ 12 years of age.  It assesses physiological (eg, evening 
caffeine consum
ption)
, cognitive (eg, thinking about things that need to be done at bedtime), 
emotional (eg
, going
 to bed feeling upset), sleep environment (eg, falling asleep with the lights 
on), sleep stability (eg, different bedtime/wake time pattern on weekdays and at weekends), 
subst
ance use (eg
, evening alcohol use), daytime sleep (eg, napping), and having a bedtime 
routine. 
The ASHS will be

f a laboratory value is out of the reference range, it is not necessarily clinically relevant.  The 
investigator must evalua
te the out-of-range values and record his/her assessment of the clinical 
relevance in the appropriate eCRF. 
All laboratory values which, in the investigator’s opinion, show clinically relevant or 
pathological changes during or after termination of the treatment are to be discussed with the 
medical monitor and re
ported as AEs and followed, as described in Section 11.2.5. 
All measurements des
cribed in this section are recognized standard methods. 
10.3.3.2 Clinical Examinations 
10.3.3.2.1 Vital Signs 
Vital signs, including heart rate, respiratory rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure will be 
measured after the subject has been in a sitting position for 5 minutes. 
10.3.3.2.2 Electrocar
diogram 
A standard 12-lead ECG will be performed after the subject has been supine for at least 
5 minutes.  All ECG recordings will be identified with the subject number, subject initials, date, 
a
nd time of the recording a
nd will be attached to the subject’s eCRF. 
All ECG values which, in the investigator’s opinion, show clinically relevant or pathological 
changes during o
r after termination of the treatment are to be discussed with the medical monitor 
and reported as AEs and followed, as described in S ection 11.2.5. 
10.3.3.2.3
 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examination (excluding the genitourinary examination) will be performed at 
Visit 1 before potential exposure to the IP and at Visit 8 at the completion of exposure. 
10.3.3.3
 Columbia Su
icide Severity Rating Scale 
The C-SSRS ( 10) is a se mi-structured interview that captures the occurrence, severity, and 
frequency of suicide-related thoughts and behaviors during the assessment period.  The interview 
includes definitions and suggested questions to solicit the type of information needed to 
determine if a suicide-related thought or behavior has occurred.  The interview and rating for the 
C-SSRS must be completed by a licensed clinician and is medically responsible for the subject.  
A licensed clinician is define
d as a doctor of medicine, doctor of osteopathic medicine, or 
licensed psychologist with a PhD.  The C-SSRS has a “baseline” version which will be 
completed at Scree
ning (Visit 1) and a “Since Last Visit” version that will be completed at all 
subsequent visits.  There are a maximum of 19 items to be completed: 7 that are required, 
10 potential additional items if there is a positive response to a required item, and 2 items for 
suicide
/suicide behavior present during the interview.  The C- SSRS uses dichotomous scales 
(ie, yes or no), Likert scales, and text or narrative to further describe the thoughts or behaviors.

AD-MW-07.04 29- Mar-2013   Page 37 of 58 11. AD VERSE EVENTS 
11.1 De finitions 
11.1.1 Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product that does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with the product.  An A
E can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including a new, c
linically important abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, 
temporally associated with the product, whether or not related to the product. 
Pre-existing diseases or conditions will not be considered AEs unless there is an increase in the 
frequency or severity, or a change in the quality, of the disease or condition (worsening of a 
pre-existing c
ondition is considered an AE). 
Events occurring in subjects treated with placebo or during treatment-free periods of the study 
are also considered AEs. 
11.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Event 
An expected AE is one for which the nature or severity is consistent with the known AE profile 
of the product.  For an IP, the known information is contained in the IB.  For a marketed product, 
the know
n information is contained in the current package insert for the product. 
An unexpected AE is one for which the specificity or severity is not consistent with the current 
I
B.  For example, hepatic necrosis would be unexpected (greater severity) if the IB only listed 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Likewise, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis would be unexpected (greater specificity) if the IB only listed cerebral vascular 
accidents. 
Furthermore, reports that add significant information on specificity or severity of a known, 
already doc
umented adverse reaction constitute unexpected events.  Examples would be (a) acute 
renal failure a
s an expected adverse reaction with a subsequent new occurrence of interstitial 
nephritis (interstitial nephritis would be unexpected) and (b) hepatitis with a first occurrence of 
fulminant hepatitis (fulminant hepatitis would be unexpected). 
11.1.3 Serious Adver
se Events 
An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
 R esults in death. 
 Is life-threatening. 
NOTE: The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers to an event in 
w
hich the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event 
which hypothetically might have c
aused death if it were more severe.  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
NOTE: Inpatient hospitalization is defined as 24 hours in a hospital or an overnight stay.  
An e
lective hospital admission to treat a condition present before exposure to the test 
drug, or a hospital admission for a diagnostic evaluation of an AE, does not qualify the 
condition or event as an SAE. Further, an overnight stay in the hospital that is only due 
to transportation, organization, or accommodation problems and without medical 
background does not need to be considered an SAE. 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
Medgenics, Inc. Confidential  
MDGN-NFC1-ADHD- 201 
 
27 Oct 2016 Version: Final Version v4.0 
AD-MW-07.04 29- Mar-2013   Page 38 of 58  Is a congenital anomaly. 
NOTE: A congenital anomaly in an infant born to a mother who was exposed to the IP 
duri
ng pregnancy is an SAE.  However, a newly diagnosed pregnancy in a subject that 
has received an IP is not considered an SAE unless it is suspected that the IP(s) 
interacted with a contraceptive method and led to the pregnancy.  
 Is an important medical event. 
NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether it is 
appropri
ate to consider other situations serious, such as important medical events that 
may not be immediately life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may 
jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes 
listed in the definition above.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an 
e
mergency room or at ho
me for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
11.1.4 Significant Adverse Events 
Other significant AEs are defined as marked hematological and other laboratory abnormalities 
(other than those meeti
ng the definition of serious) and any events that led to an intervention, 
including withdrawal of test drug, dose reduction, or significant additional concomitant therapy. 
11.1.5 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as treatment emergent if the first onset or worsening is after the first 
administration of
 IP (NFC-1 or placebo) and not more than 7 days after the last administration of 
IP. 
11.2 M anagement of Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be collected from the time of signing informed consent form (ICF) through 
the Follow-up Visit or Early Termination Visit, whichever occurs first. 
11.2.1
 Collection 
The investigator is re
sponsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an AE or SAE described previously.  At each visit, the subject will be allowed 
time to spontaneously 
report any issues since the last visit or evaluation.  The investigator will 
then monitor and/or ask about or eva
luate AEs using nonleading questions, such as: 
 “How are you feeling?” 
 “ Have you experienced any issues since your last visit?” 
 “Have you taken any new medications since your last visit?” 
Any clinically relevant observations made during the visit will also be considered AEs. 
11.2.2 Evaluation 
11.2.2.1 Se
verity of Adverse Events 
The clinical severity of an AE will be classified as: 
Mild : Usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or therapeutic 
intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of 
daily living.  
Moderate : Usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention.  The 
event  interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing discomfort but 
poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.

27 Oct 2016 Version: Final Version v4.0 
AD-MW-07.04 29- Mar-2013   Page 39 of 58 Severe : Interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects clinical 
status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention . 
It is important to distinguish between severe AEs and SAEs.  Severity is a classification of 
intensity where
as an SAE is an AE that meets serious criteria, as described in Section 11.1.3. 
11.2.2.2
 Seriousness 
The investigator is to evaluate whether the AE meets serious criteria, as described in 
Section 11.1.3.
 
11.2.2.3 Action(s) Tak
en 
Action(s) taken may consist of: 
Dose increased : An indication that a medication schedule was modified by addition; 
either by changing the frequency, strength or amount.  
Dose not changed : An indication that a medication schedule was maintained.  
Dose reduced : An indication that a medication schedule was modified by subtraction, 
either by changing the frequency, strength or amount.  
Drug interrupted : An indication that a medication schedule was  modified by temporarily 
terminating a prescribed regimen of medication.  
Drug withdrawn : An indication that a medication schedule was modified through 
termination of a prescribed regimen of medication.  
Not applicable : Determination of a value is not rele vant in the current context.  
Unknown : Not known, not observed, not recorded, or refused.  
11.2.2.4 Outcome at the Time of Last Observation 
The outcome at the time of last observation will be classified as: 
 R ecovered/resolved. 
 R ecovered/resolved with sequelae. 
 R ecovering/resolving. 
 Not r ecovered/not resolved. 
 F atal* . 
 Unknow n. 
*Only select fatal as an outcome when the AE results in death.  If more than one AE is possibly 
related to the subject’s de
ath, the outcome of death should be indicated for each such AE.  
Although “fatal” is usually an event outcome, events such as sudden death or unexplained death 
should be reported as SAEs. 
11.2.2.5 Adverse Event Relationship to Investigational Product 
The investigator must make an assessment of each AE’s relationship to the IP.  The categories 
for classifying the inve
stigator’s opinion of the relationship are listed below. 
Not related : An AE with sufficient evidence to accept that there is no causal 
relationship to IP administration (eg, no temporal relationship to drug 
administr ation, because the drug was administered after onset of event; 
Medgenics, Inc. Confidential  
MDGN-NFC1-ADHD- 201 
 
27 Oct 2016 Version: Final Version v4.0 
AD-MW-07.04 29- Mar-2013   Page 40 of 58 investigation shows that the drug was not administered; another cause was 
proven ). 
Unlikely related : An AE, including laboratory test abnormality, with a temporal 
relationship to IP administration that makes a causal relationship 
improbable, and in which other drugs, events or underlying disease 
provide plausible explanations.  
Possibly related : An AE with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the IP, but 
which could also be  explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
events.  Information on drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  
Related : An AE occurring in a plausible time relationship to IP administration, and 
which cannot be explained by a concurrent disease or other drugs or 
events. The response to withdrawal of the drug (dechallenge) is clinically 
reasonable.  
The AE relationship to IP will be assessed separately by the investigator and Medgenics. 
11.2.3 Documentation 
All AEs occurring within the period of observation for the study must be documented in the 
e
CRF with the following
 information, where appropriate.  The period of observation for the 
study is desc
ribed in Section 11.2. 
 AE  name or term. 
 W hen the AE first occurred (start date and time). 
 W hen the AE stopped (stop date and time or an indication of “ongoing”). 
 S everity of the AE. 
 Seriousness (hospitalization, death, etc.). 
 Ac tions taken. 
 Outc ome. 
 I nvestigator opinion regarding the AE relationship to the IP. 
11.2.4 Treatm
ent of Adverse Events 
Adve
rse events that occur during the study will be treated, if necessary, by established standards 
of care. If such treatment constitutes a deviation from the protocol, the subject may continue in 
the study/should be withdrawn from the study and the reason must be documented in the eCRF.  
The
 decision about whether the subject may continue in the study will be made by the sponsor 
after consultation with the investigator and/or medical monitor. 
If AEs occur in a subject that are not tolerable, or for which continued administration of IP is not 
reasonable in view of the potential benefit to subject, the investigator must decide whether to 
stop the study and/or treat the subject.  Special procedures may be recommended for the specific 
IP, such as the c
ollection of a serum sample for blood concentrations of IP, specific tapering 
procedures, or treatment regimens, as appropriate. 
For double- or triple-blinded studies, it is not necessary to unblind a subject’s treatment 
assignment in most circumstances, even if an SAE has occurred.  If unblinding is necessary, see 
Section 9.6 for a description of the unblinding procedures.

 Follow- up 
Any AE will be followed (up to a maximum of 7 days after the last dose of the IP) to a 
satisfactory r
esolution, until it becomes stable, or until it can be explained by another known 
cause(s) (ie, concurrent condition or medication) and clinical judgment indicates that further 
evaluation is not warranted.  All findings relevant to the final outcome of an AE must be reported 
in the subject’s medical r
ecord and recorded on the appropriate e CRF . 
11.2.6 Notification 
11.2.6.1 S
erious Adverse Events 
The investigator or designee must report all SAEs promptly to  within 24 hours 
of first becoming awa
re of the event by completing, signing, and dating the SAE pages, verifying 
the accuracy
 of the information recorded on the SAE pages with the corresponding source 
documents and eCRF, and sending the SAE pages to the  Pharmacovigilance 
Department by one of the
 following methods: 
 Ema il: . 
 F AX number:  
The written report should be submitted on the
 SAE form provided for this purpose.  At the time 
of first notification, the investigator or designee should provide the following information, if 
available: 
 P rotocol number. 
 R eporter (study site and investigator). 
 S ubject’s study number. 
 S ubject’s year of birth. 
 Subject’s gender. 
 Da te of first dose of IP. 
 Da te of last dose of IP, if applicable. 
 Adve rse event term. 
 Da te of occurrence of the event. 
 A br ief description of the event, outcome to date, and any actions taken. 
 The seriousness criteria(on) that were met. 
 Concomitant medication at onset of the event. 
 Relevant past history information. 
 Relevant laboratory test findings. 
 I nvestigator’s opinion of the relationship to IP(s) (“Is there a reasonable possibility that the 
IP caused the SAE? Yes or No?”). 
 W hether and when the investigator was unblinded as to the subject’s treatment assignment. 
Any missing or additional relevant information concerning the SAE should be provided to the 
recipient(s) of the initial information as soon as possible on a follow-up SAE Report Form 
together with the following information: AE, date of occurrence, subject ID, study ID, IP, and 
site number.  This will allow the follow-up information to be linked to the initial SAE report.

pecific information may be requested by the  Pharmacovigilance Department 
using a follow up request form.  Th e investigator is required to comply with applicable 
regulations (including lo
cal laws and guidances) regarding the notification of his/her health 
authorities, institutional review boards (IRBs), principal and coordinating investigators, study 
investigators, and institutions. 
11.2.6.2 Non-serious Adverse
 Events 
Nonserious AEs will be recorded in the eCRF and reported by  to Medgenics. 
11.3 S pecial Considerations 
11.3.1 Adverse Events of Special Interest 
The following events will be considered as AEs of special interest during this study: 
 P sychosis. 
 S uicidal ideation. 
Based on the population under study
, and their age, suicidal ideation will be considered as an AE 
of special interest. 
11.3.2 Pregnancy 
All women of childbearing potential who participate in the study should be counseled on the 
need to practice a
dequate birth control and on the importance of avoiding pregnancy during 
study participation.  Women should be instructed to contact the investigator or study staff 
immediately if pregna
ncy occurs or is suspected. 
Pregnancy testing will be conducted prior to administration of IP on every woman of 
childbearing potential.  A woman who is found to be pregnant at the Screening Visit will be 
excluded from the study 
and considered to be a screening failure. 
A woman wh o becomes pregnant during IP treatment or within 30 days of discontinuing the IP 
will be immediately
 discontinued from study participation.  The investigator must report the 
pregnancy withi
n 24 hours of learning of the pregnancy to  Pharmacovigilance 
using the Pregnancy D
ata Collection Form via the same fax and email address as for SAE 
reporting.  The investigator should contact the designated individual(s) who receive SAE 
notification and rec
ord information related to the pregnancy on an Exposure in Utero form/other 
designated form provid
ed by the sponsor or its designee. 
Early Termination Visit asse
ssments are required as soon as possible after learning of the 
pregnancy.  The invest
igator is also responsible for following the pregnancy until delivery or 
termination.  These
 findings must be reported on the Exposure in Utero Form/other designated 
form and forwarded to the designated individual(s).  The event meets the SAE criterion only if it 
re
sults in a sponta
neous a
bortion or a congenital anomaly. 
12. DA TA SAFETY MONITORING BOARD 
No Data Safety Monitoring Board will be required. 
13. S TATISTICS 
13.1 Study Endpoints 
13.1.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary endpoint for
 the assessment of efficacy will be the ADHD- RS-5 score.   The analysis 
will be based on changes from the baseline value and will test the hypothesis that there is no 
difference between the treatments (ie, that the difference is 0) against a 2-tailed alternative.

AD-MW-07.04 29- Mar-2013   Page 43 of 58 13.1.2
 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints will include the CGI-I, CGI-S, and other assessment scales.  Further 
exploratory analyses will examine the effect of covariates such as dose-level and age.  All 
quantitative endpoints will be described with traditional summary statistics and tabulated by 
treatment group and visit. 
13.1.3 Safety Endpoints 
Adverse events will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) and tabulated by system organ class and preferred term.  Adverse 
events will be analyzed by frequency, severity, relationship to IP, and their effect on 
participation in the study. 
Clinical laboratory values will be compared to normal ranges and flagged for levels of clinical 
concern.  The analysis will focus on the frequencies of abnormal values as well as within-subject 
changes observed during the course of the study. 
Vital signs and ECG recordings will also be examined for changes during the study that may be 
attributed to exposure to IP. 
The C-SSRS will also be examined for changes that may be attributed to exposure to IP. 
13.2 S ample Size Determination 
Enrollment of 90 subjects is expected to yield 80 subjects who complete the study as planned.  
Assuming an effect size of 0.7, this number will provide approximately 90% power to detect a 
significant difference between the treatments based on a 2-tailed α = 0.05 comparison of mean 
change from Baseline. 
13.3 Analysis Populations 
The design of this study yields 3 main populations of scientific interest. 
The Safety Population will consist of all subjects who are randomized into the study and receive 
any amount of IP. 
The Intent- to-Treat (ITT) Population will be composed of all subjects who are randomized into 
the study. 
The occurrence of significant protocol deviations may lead to the exclusion of some subjects 
from specific analyses, thereby yielding a Per-protocol (PP) Population. 
Specific subgroups of these populations may also be evaluated as warranted by the experimental 
results. 
Membership in the analysis populations will be determined prior to unblinding. 
13.4 Statistical Analyses 
This section presents a summary of the planned statistical analyses.  Additional details regarding 
data handling, a
nalytical methods, and presentation of results will be found in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan for this study.  The Statistical Analysis Plan will be finalized prior to database 
lock. 
13.4.1 Study Sub
jects and Demographics 
13.4.1.1 Disposition and Withdrawals 
The disposition of all subjects enrolled in this study will be fully described with respect to their 
randomization status and ultimate discontinuation.  Subjects who discontinue the study will be 
summarized with the re
ason for discontinuation.

 Protocol Deviations 
All subject data will be reviewed for the occurrence of protocol deviations.  Prior to database 
lock, all protocol deviations will be reviewed in a blinded fashion and classified with respect to 
the potential to influence experimental outcomes.  The results of this review may lead to 
enumeration of a
 PP Population, as described in Section 13.3. 
13.4.1.3
 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics 
The analysis of 
demographic and baseline data will be performed for all study populations. 
Demographic variables inc
lude age, gender, race, ethnicity, height, and weight.  Baseline subject 
characteristics to be summarized will include medical history, physical examination, 
ECG assessment, C-SSRS evaluation, an IQ test (WASI- II) , and clinical laboratory tests. 
Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized by treatment group and by the number 
and percentage
 of subjects taking each medication.  Medications will be coded according to the 
World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO- DD) Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical 
(A
TC) classes and preferred terms. 
13.4.2 Exposure and Compliance 
Exposure to IP will be summarized for all participating subjects.  Subjects will be described with 
re
spect to cumulative exposure as well as categorized by the highest dose received. 
Compliance with study
 medication will be determined for each subject.  Based on capsule 
counts, the number of doses administered will be expressed as the proportion of doses scheduled.  
Compliance will be assessed independently for each phase of the study (ie, dose optimization 
a
nd maintenance). 
13.4.3
 Efficacy Analyses 
All ef
ficacy measures will be described with standard summary statistics.  Continuous variables 
will be summarized by N, mean, and standard deviation, and categorical variables by the number 
and percent of subjects i
n each category.  Where appropriate, estimates will be presented with 
95% confidence intervals. 
Ef
ficacy analyses will attempt to quantify the effects of treatment with NFC-1 relative to 
placebo.  The null hypothesis of no difference between active and placebo will be tested against 
a 2-tailed alternative with a type-I error rate of 0.05. 
13.4.3.1
 Primary Analysis 
The primary analysis will focus on the effect of treatment on ADHD, as indicated by the 
ADHD- RS-5.  The change in ADHD- RS- 5 will be derived as the difference between the last 
post
-treatment value and that recorded at the Baseline visit.  The analysis of the change will 
employ a 1-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) model with a term for treatment (active or 
placebo).  Depending on the fit of the single-factor model, subsequent exploratory analyses may 
be
 performed that includ
e additional in dependent factors (eg, age, gender, and/or maintenance 
dose of study drug
) as well as covariates that have been determined to be associated with 
experimental re
sults (eg, baseline value of the dependent variable).  Results of these exploratory 
analyses
 will be presented as estimates for all factors included in the model with corresponding 
95%
 confidence intervals and associated levels of statistical significance. 
This ana
lysis will be performed with primary focus on the ITT Population.

 Secondary Analyses 
Secondary efficacy analyses will examine the effects of the treatment on changes observed in 
other efficacy measures (ie, CGI-S, ASHS, and SCARED).  These analyses will model the 
ove
rall or total scale
 scores and will employ the same general approach as for the primary 
analysis.  All secondary efficacy measures will be treated as continuous measurement scales and 
analyzed by the ANOVA methods described above. 
Results of the CGI-I assessment will also be dichotomized and presented for each week of 
treatment.  CGI-I scores of 1 or 2 will be combined into a single group labelled “Improved” and 
scores of 3 to 7 will be combined and labelled “No Improvement.”  The observed proportions of 
“Improved” subj
ects will be compared between treatment groups at each week of the study. 
In addition, analysis of the weekly results from ADHD- RS-5 and CGI-I will be evaluated for 
e
vidence of trend over time.  This analysis will employ a linear mixed-effects model with 
repeated measur
es on each subject.  Terms for the model will be selected as described for the 
primary analy
sis. 
Secondary analyses will focus on the ITT Population.  However, analyses of the PP Population 
may be pe
rformed if warranted by the data. 
13.4.4
 Safety and Tolerability Analyses 
Safety analyses will be conducted using data from the Safety Population (as defined in 
Section 13.3
).  Safety variables include treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), clinical 
laboratory va
lues, vital signs, ECG results, C-SSRS, and physical examination results.  No 
formal inferential ana
lyses will be conducted for safety variables, unless otherwise noted. 
13.4.4.1 Adverse Events 
Adverse events will be coded using the most recent version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized by system 
organ class (SOC)
 a
nd preferred term.  Treatment-emergent AEs will be presented as the number 
and proportion of subjects reporting
 each event.  Similar summaries will be produced for post-
treatment AEs, SAE
s, AEs leading to termination, and AEs with at least a possible relationship 
to the IP.  The intensity of AEs and the relationship to the IP will also be summarized for each 
S
OC and preferre
d term. 
13.4.4.2 Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Descriptive summaries of actual (absolute) values and changes from baseline values will be 
presented by treatment group for each study visit. 
The number of subjects with cli
nical laboratory values below, within, or above normal ranges, at 
each study visit will be tabulated (shift tables) for each clinical laboratory analyte by treatment 
group. 
13.4.4.3 Vital Signs and Electrocardiograms 
Vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse, and respiratory rate), and ECG results 
will be summarized by visit and treatment group using appropriate descriptive statistics.  The 
number and percentage of subjects with abnormal ECG findings will be summarized by 
treatment group for each study visit. 
13.4.4.4 Columbia Suicid
e Severity Rating Scale 
The C-SSRS score will be summarized by visit and treatment group using descriptive statistics.

a Caregivers will receive a follow-up telephone call from a study staff member 7 days after the last visit to collect information about any ongoing AEs and 
concomitant medication. 
b Informed consent to be completed by a duly authorized subject representative.  Assent is to be provided by subject where required. 
c Medical and medication history including confirmation from the sponsor that each subject has been determined to have disruptive mutations in genes within 
the GRM-network as determined by the presence of CNVs (GRM biomarker-positive subjects).   
d
 The CGI–S rates illness severity on the following 7-point scale: 1 = normal, not at all ill, 2 = borderline mentally ill, 3 = mildly ill, 4 = moderately ill, 
5 = markedly ill, 6 = severely ill, and 7 = among the most extremely ill subjects. 
e The CGI-I requires the investigator to assess how much the subject’s illness has improved or worsened: 1 = very much  improved, 2 = much improved, 
3 = minimally improved, 4  = no change, 5 = minimally worse, 6 = muc h worse, and 7 = very much worse.  
f IWRS will assign treatment numbers and will also manage all logistical aspects of treatments (eg, drug resupply and expiry dates).  
g If more than 23 days have elapsed between the Screening Visit and the Baseline Visit clinical laboratory tests, serum pregnancy test, vital signs and weight, 
urine drug test, and ECG must be repeated and the results available and reviewed prior to proceeding with the Baseline Visit.

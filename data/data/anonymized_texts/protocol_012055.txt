BACKGROUND  
 
Chronic pain and depression frequently co- exist in late and mid- life and contribute to 
increased disability, high health care costs, psychiatric comorbidity, and suicide. Older 
and middle- aged depressed- pain patients: a) are mainly treated in primary care 
practices; and b) are often prescribed medication, w hich increases the risk for addiction 
to opioids and benzodiazepines. Despite the need -  and desire by the pat ients and 
providers - for primary care behavioral interventions, be havioral interventions are scarce 
in primary care. To address this need, we wor ked with primary care practices of the 
Weill Cornell Medical Associates (WCMA), and developed Relief, a 9- session 
behavioral intervention, designed to be administered by license d social workers 
(LCSWs) and/or nurse practitioners (NP) in primary care practi ces.  
 
Our conceptual model assumes that chronic pain and depression are characterized by 
an attentional bias assigning greater salience to  interoceptive stimuli and to negative 
emotions along with difficulty shifting attention to goal -oriented/ reward- driven state 
leading to inadequate engagement of the reward network . Accordingly, Relief  aims to 
change the attent ional bias of depressed- pain patients favoring interoceptive 
experi ences (discomfort, negative feelings), and increase the salience of newly 
devel oped adaptive and rewarding behaviors. Relief also examines patients’ 
expectations of pain treatment (which may be adversely affected by depression), and 
uses techniques to reduc e negative emotions associated with pain treatment, modify 
unrealistic expectations and enhance the communication between the patient and 
primary care physician. To facilitate and enhance i ts delivery, Relief uses easy -to 
operate smartphone applications.  
 
This project aims to meet the needs of financially, ethnically and socially di verse older 
and middle- aged primary care patients with chronic pain and depression, who are 
mostly treated in primary care and are at risk of adverse outcomes. Pharmacological 
pain interventions (e.g., antidepressants, opioids) and physical therapy are in common use, but offer inadequate relief, and increase the risk of abuse. Behavioral interventions for depression and chronic pain are scarce in primary care.  
 Consistent with th e NIMH Objective 3 for a person- centered approach using RDoC, 
Relief uses a neurobiological model to streamline and structure its interventions for use in primary care practices.  
 Relief u ses targeted mobile technology applications to facilitate and enhance its 
delivery, i.e. reminders to participants to perform their treatment ass ignments, 
summaries of behavioral graphs to help therapists target their interventions, augmented assessment th rough passive sensing, and active entries.

 If effective, Relief m ay reduce depression and pain- related disability, break the vicious 
cycle of i nactivity, and improve quality of life for this large group of patients who suffer 
and have few viable treatmen t options. Relief has the potential for broad uptake and 
sustainabi lity by large practices (e.g. Affordable Care Organizations or practices with 
large caseloads of adults with pain and depression who have limited access to 
psychiatrists or pain specialists ) that may employ or engage LCSWs and NPs whose 
services are reimbursable by Medicare and other insurances.

STUDY AIMS  
 
 
 
 
    
 
         
 
 The goals of the study are:  
 MONTHS 1 -3: 
 
1. Finalize the Relief Manual and establish feasibility of therapist training: We will continue to work with the WCMA to finalize Relief (9 s essions) and train practice 
LCSWs and NPs. We will determine the success rate of training and number of 
hours needed to achieve Relief certification.  
 
2. Develop Relief’s Operations Manual: W e will work with the WCMA’s clinicians 
and managers and create an O perations Manual to guide the integration of Relief 
into the practice, i.e., p rocedures for screening, referral and hand- off to therapists 
and research team, communication with WCMA physici ans and staff.  
 MONTHS 4 -36: 
 
3. Assess Relief’s reach, feasibility a nd acceptability: We will assess across 
conditions:  
Relief Study Operations Manual  
May 2020  
13 
 a. Reach: Number of patients screened, and those who meet inclusion 
criteria;  
b. Feasibility: Number of patients who initiate Relief or UC/ RMH [referral 
(based on clinical indication) for mental health care]  and research 
procedures (tim ely referrals, assessments);  
c. Acceptability: P atient’s treatment satisfaction  at 6, 9, and 12 weeks.  
 
Benchmarks  of the study progress : Feasibility: At least 75 % of Relief 
participants will complete Relief. Acceptability: We will obtain treatment satisfaction score  at the end of Relief treatment.  
 
4. Preliminary Effectiveness: Over the course of 12 weeks, Relief participants, 
compared to participants in UC/ RMH  [referral (based on clinical indication) for 
mental health care] , will have greater (effect size) and cl inically significant 
reductions in depressi on, pain- related disability.  
 
5. Preliminary Evidence of  Target Engagement/Secondary: The differential effect of 
Relief vs. UC/ RMH in reducing depression and pain- related disability will be 
independently mediated by r eduction of interoceptive focus  and positi ve and 
negative emotions.

 PROTOCOL  
1. Study staff  review s the Electronic Health Records (EHR) on Electro nic Privacy 
Information Center (EPIC) and will identify patien ts with diagnoses of chronic 
pain,  a DSM 5 diagnoses of depression and anxiety , as well as patients who are 
on psychotropic and/or pain medications .  
2. Study staff wil l also attend meetings at eac h of the PCP practic es every few 
months to present/review the study and ask  the PCPs to write down the  names  
of any patients th ey think may be appropriate .  
3. Study s taff will then contact potential participants  via phone . If they meet 
preliminary eligibilit y criter ia (based on administering the phone screen script) 
and are interested,  they will be in vited to come to our offices in White Pla ins or 
NYC,  or to schedule a video or phone appointment , depending on the 
circumstances.  During the appointm ent, the co nsenting process will take place 
first, and then if the patient consents, the research assistant will conduct the 
scree ning assessment (either in person or remotely) .  
4. RA will then discuss the results of the assessment  with Dr. Kiosses.  
5. If the patient is eligible, the RA will email the data manager  with the patient 
information.  
6. The data manager  will randomize the patient to either Relief or UC/RMH . 
7. The data manager will notify Dr. Kiosses and the supervising therapist (not 
administering the intervention)  about the randomization.  
8. The supervising therapist  will contact the physician to let them know that the 
patient is part of the study and whether they are receiving Relief or UC/ RMH.  
9. The s upervising therapist  will notify the patient that  they are receivin g Relief or 
UC/RMH  and will assign a therapist to the patient  if randomized to Relief.  
10. Both groups will receive (from the RA or via mail):  
• Educational (TCAP) booklet  
• Withing s Watch with cha rger 
• iPhone 7 with charger (if patient does not have a smart phone or doesn ’t 
want to use their ow n) 
• W2H application downloaded to smartphone  
• Technology Manual  
In addition , patients r andomized to Relief will receive a therapy participant guide 
from the study therapist.  
11. Team w eekly meetings : 
• Review recruitment (specifically  the numbers of positive screen patients)  
• Referrals  
• Tracking of  all patients ; we will discuss:   
o The st atus of assessments  
o If in Relief, the status of therapy sessions  
 RAs will leave the room to protect randomization.  
• The data manager  will generate char ts with recruitment progress.  
Relief Study Operations Manual

 12. The RA will conduct assessments a t follow up time points: 6,  9, and 12 weeks 
after the baseline assessment. The p atient will receive  $25 (cash, check or gift  
card)  for each assessment . 
13. The RA will periodically contact the subject to make sure he/she i s using the 
phone app and Withings watch and to answer any questions they may have 
about the app.  
14. At week 12 t he therapist  will determ ine whether their  subjects in Relief are 
eligible for an additional  $50 gift card based on the activi ties they have 
completed,  and will distr ibute gi ft card s accordingly . 
15. After  the 12-week  assessment , the patient  in UC/RMH will receive an evaluation 
from a clinician.  
16. All technol ogy l ent to patients will be returned  to study staff .

 RESEARCH ASSESSMENT  
The r esearch assistant will describe the s tudy, ask potenti al participants to sign 
consent, and ad minister a screening assessment to evaluate eligibility. Once this is 
confirmed, the research assistant will ad minister a baseline assessment. At this 
assessment, the research assistant will explain t hat follow -up assessments will be 
administered at 6, 9, and 12 weeks. The research assistant will also explain that the 
partic ipants will be compensated $25 for each completed assessment. The research 
assistant will the n facilitate a referral to the data m anager, who will identify the 
participant’s group and notify Dr. Kiosses, who will notify the appropriate social worker to sch edule a meeting.

INTERVENTION 
 
Relief: Relief utilizes a stru ctured, yet personalized, approach. The goals of Relief are 
to shift the attention of depressed- pain patients away from pain, discomfort and 
negative feelings, increase involvement in meaningful and pleasurable activities, use 
techniques to reduce negative emotions associated with pain, modify unrealistic 
expectations and enhance communication between the patient and primary care physician. The Relief therapist uses the following techniques: attention- shift ( e.g 
“distract and refocus” technique, shaping procedure to sustain attention), de- escalation 
(e.g.  avoidance of situations that trigger negative emotions, modification of situations, 
changing perspective), reward exposure (through explicit action plans), planning (e.g., step by step division of task/acti on, preparatory steps for a task), and motivational 
techniques (e.g. use of notebooks, calendars)  to achieve its goals (Manual in 
Appendix). Relief also includes techniques to address negative emotions and v iews 
related to the treatment process and to reduce tension between patients and family 
members. Mobile technology is used to augment the Relief intervention.  Finally, at the 
end of treatment Relief therapists provide to patients a personalized summary of  
treatment that highlights the problems that were addressed, and the successful 
techniques that had been used to solve them.  
 
Comparison Condition:  UC/RMH Offered at WCMA: UC/RMH is a strong comparison 
condition because routine care for depression in WCMA  practices is superior to more 
than 80% of primar y care practices. T he practices do not have ongoing, standardized 
fidelity procedures to mental health treatments or guidelines. Our team will not interfere 
with these procedures but record treatment of study participants (percent referred, type 
of treatme nt received, frequency of sessions, attendance, referral to psychiatrist, and 
psychotropic prescriptions). In addition to the regular referral services, we will offer an educational booklet on chronic pain and depression.
 
 
 
  
FOLLOW UP ASSESSMENTS  
 
Follow up assessments are conducted by the WCM  research assistant at 6, 9, and 12 
weeks after the baseline, and include measures of depression and anxiety symptoms, 
and pain. Subjects will receive $25 (cash, check or gift card)  as co mpensation for 
completing each assessment.

 WAY TO HEALTH  APPLICATION 
 
In conjunction with psychotherapy sessions , participants will be asked to download, 
activate, and use a smartphone application designed by Way to Health. If particip ants 
do not own a s martphone or do not want to use their own phone, we will provide them 
with a free smartphone to be used for the duration of the study. To maximize the use 
and benefits of the app , the RA and/or therapist will review its use, prepare writ ten 
personalized instructions, ask patients for feedback, and repeat the instructions in 
subsequent sessions as needed  
A smart phone and a Withings watch will be the vehicles for mobile technology interventions .  
Augmentation of Relief among participants i n the Relief interv ention group consists of:  
1) Daily ratings  of mood, interest or pleasure in activities, stress, and pain. A text 
message sent by Way to Health prompts participants to rate these 4 items on a scale of 1 to 10.  
2) Daily reminders to pursue preparatory steps and sc heduled meaningful, rewarding 
activitie s as well as interventions for negative emotions.  
3) Passive sensing of movement (steps) and sleep daily  by the Withings watch. 
Participants are reminded to review their step count and deep and light s leep 
duration daily  and receive and a weekly summary of both on Fridays.  
4) Participants receive a text message asking them whether they practiced their negative emotions intervention and engaged in their planned rewarding activity and to rate the sense of pl easure (scale 1 to 10) and the sense of satisfaction (scal e 1 to 
10) they derived.  
5) At the end of each week, participants receive a text message indicating to them the reward level they achieved. Based on studies of non- depressed older adults by U. 
Penn inv estigators, we are using an incentive plan based on behavi oral economics . 
 Participants in the UC/RMH group will also receive a smart phone and Withings watch.  They will receive text messages prompting d aily ratings of mood, interest or pleasure in 
activi ties, stress, and p ain 
 
 
 
PROCEDURES FOR TREATMENT AFTER STUDY COMPLETION  
Participants whose follow up assessments indicate a need for cont inued mental health 
services will be provided with mental health referrals. If participants are members of a 
senior center in the W -MH condition they will automatically receive a referral for mental 
health services.

 DATA MANAGEMENT 
Data will be collected  by the study RA at baseline and at follow -up assessments. The 
RA will also be responsible for writing and presenting patient summaries  to the PI.  The 
clinician will complete updates on t he progress of their therapy sessions . Brian Liles 
manage s the Relief database and weekly reporting.  
Research records will be kept confidential to the extent permitted by law. Subjects  will 
be assigned I D numbers by the R elief study team and all identifying information will be 
removed from records that  are submitted to Weill Cornell Medicine for data analysis. 
Paper research records will be kept in locked file cabinets. When necessary f or 
purposes of audi ting, the Cornell IRB, NIMH, and all Federal oversight agencies will be 
provided to these files. Com puters will be password protected and all staff participating 
in the study are trained in protecting human subjects in research. Data wil l be published 
in aggregate form without unique identifiers. No analyses will be published in which it is 
possible to i dentify individuals based on data.  
 
SUSTAINABILITY  
 
Dr. Kiosses will train three  LCSWs in R elief (or more if needed). Training will cons ist of 
a one- day workshop with didactics, role- play and review of previously audiotaped 
sessions. After the workshop, t he therapist will administer 6 R elief sessions to 2 pilot 
participants during the first four months.  To be certified in R elief, therapis ts must 
achieve a s core of greater than or equal to 4 (very good) out of 5 on the R elief 
Adherence Scale.

1.  Purpose and objectives.           List the purpose and objectives:  
 
There is a worldwide epidemic of diabetes. Foot ulcers are one of the most common complications in diabetic patients leading to 
amputation and hospitalization. The identification of biomarkers to determine which patients will heal and those that need more extensive intervention is critical to improve healing outcomes. The purpose of this study is to evaluate two different applic ation 
paradigms with AMNIOEXCEL Plus® in Diabetic Foot Ulcer.  The study will further characterize AE+ in wound healing outcomes and assess the role of aggressive debridement in wound healing outcomes.  Study outcomes include  
• Incidence of healing at 12 weeks  
• Percent area reduction  
• Percent volume reduction  
• Level and type of Debridement  
• Wound bed perfusion (hyperspectral imaging)  
  
2.  Background.

a. Background  
The overall objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the use of AMNIOEXCEL Plus® to heal diabetic foot wounds. Failure of  
a wound to heal in an organized and timely fashion is complex and multifactorial. Chronic wounds are characterized by a 
persistent  inflammatory state resulting from local wound factors such as necrotic tissue, high microbial burden, low oxygen, 
and repetitive injury. Also, diabetes associated metabolic co-morbidities, especially peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and hyperglycemia, contribute to the persistence of chronic wounds.  Treatments include re-vascularization, wound debridement, 
pressure off -loading, glycemic control, and modification of patient behaviors, such as tobacco abuse and compliance with off -
loading devices.  
 
b. Curre nt practice  
Human amniotic membrane (AM) has been widely applied in the management of burns, dermatological defects and ocular 
surface reconstruction.  AMNIOEXCEL Plus® is a human placental -based tissue consisting of dehydrated, tri -layer Placental 
(Amnion/Chorion/Amnion) Allograft Membrane (T -PAM) layers. T -PAM is a minimally manipulated placental membrane 
product intended for homologous use for the repair, reconstruction and replacement of skin at the direction of a physician. 
AMNIOEXCEL Plus contains Human Cellular and Tissue Based Products (HCT/P) as defined by US FDA 21 CFR Part 1271.  
It has been estimated that 15% of diabetics will have a lower extremity ulcer in their lifetime. In the United States there are approximately 120,000 non-traumatic lower extremity amputations performed each year. The direct cost of foot ulcers and 
amputations has been conservatively estimated to be approximately 1.6 billion dollars a year without consideration for 
physician fees, prosthetics, or rehabilita tion costs.

3.  Study Design.  
Describe the study design (e.g., single/double blind, parallel, crossover, etc.)  Consider inserting a scheme to visually present the 
study design.  
 
We plan to evaluate healing in two cohorts of patients with diabetic foot wounds (n=20) that receive optimal treatment includ ing 
serial wound debridement and off -loading with a boot or  postop shoe and AmnioEXCEL+. In one cohort, AmnioEXCEL+ will be 
applied weekly at study visits and in the second cohort, AmnioEXCEL+ will be applied maximum every 2 weeks (PRN, in the 
case that the wound requires debridement at a visit not intended for AE+ application, the wound will be treated as SOC). In 
addition, we will collect data on other potential confounding factors that could affect healing such as antibiotic, anti -fungal and 
anti-infective medications, tobacco, comorbidities, diabetes control, infection, perfusion, and activity. Wound healing, including 
wound size a nd adverse events will be evaluated.

     1) Provide the order in which tests/procedures will be performed ,  
     2) Provide the setting  for these events and a description of the methods used to protect privacy  during the study.   
     3) Provide the plan for data analysis (include as applicable the sample size calculation)  
 
Please respond to all components of this item, or clearly indicate which components are not applicable.  
 
Subjects will be identified by the PI or Sub- from the investigators' clinic schedule. We plan a prospective cohort study of 40 
diabetic patients with foot ulcerations treated at Parkland foot wound clinic and UTSW wound clinic.  
 
The PI, Sub-I, or study coordinator will carefully review this research study with the subject  in a private area and any family 
members or caregivers. Any questions will be answered, and it will be emphasized that participation in the research is volunt ary. 
When all questions are answered, and the subject has agreed to participation in the research, the subject will sign the Consent 
and HIPAA Authorization.  The subject will receive a copy of the signed documents. Subjects will be enrolled based on basic 
inclusion/exclusion criteri a. Subject will be given ample time to consider.  
 
Study Procedures:  
 Collection of Demographic data, medical/social history  
Collection of medications1  
Ankle Brachial Index2  
Wound debridement3 (standard of care procedure)  and tissue collection of normally discarded tissue of up to 3 samples on 
Baseline visit and weeks 3, 6, and 9.  
Imaging with eKare4  
Hyperspectral Imaging  
Application of study product  
 
1Only collect antibiotics, anti -fungal and anti -infective medications.  
2 ABI (with toe pressure) can be done at screening or baseline.  
3 Once wound is healed, wound debridement will not be done at weekly visits.  
4 Once wound is healed, eKare will not be done at weekly visits.  
5 EOS will occur on the date the subject is healed.  
*Screening and Visit 1 may be done on the same day.

Analysis and Statistical Approaches  
As this study is designed as open- label case series to evaluate different treatment protocols using AmnioEXCEL+.  Descriptive 
statistics will be performed there will be no statistical analysis for this study.  Wound healing outcomes will be assessed in bot h 
treatment cohorts.  
The eKare and Hyperspectral Imaging cameras are research-only. Everything else is standard of care. The cameras do not touch 
the patient. We will collect up to 3 samples of discarded tissue from debridement at Baseline and weeks 3, 6,  and 9 if applicable. 
This is the standard of care debridement and tissue that would have been discarded.

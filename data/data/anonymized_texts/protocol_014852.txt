2.0 BACKGROUND 
 Background  The need for alternative donor options in  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
 Hematopoietic stem cell transp lantation (HSCT) is a curativ e treatment for a variety of 
malignant and non-malignant hematologic disorders
1-3. HSCT from a human leukocyte antigen 
(HLA)-matched sibling has produced the best outc omes as measured by overall and progression-
free survival4. Unfortunately, only about a third of candidates for HSCT have HLA-matched 
siblings5;6.  For patients who lack HLA-matched sib lings, there are two alternative sources of 
unrelated HLA-matched stem cells for HSCT: 1) volunteer matched unrelated donors and 2) 
umbilical cord blood7.  However, outcomes following transpla nts using these sources are inferior 
compared to those performed using HLA-matched related donors, largely due to the increased 
incidence of post-transplant complications such as GVHD, infections and graft failure. 
Furthermore, the frequency with which an URD can be identified may be around 50% for 
Caucasians, but the likelihood falls to ≤10% for those of certain ethnic or mixed race 
backgrounds6. Worldwide, one million HSCT had b een performed by the end of 2012, as 
treatment for over 70 different diseases8.  Despite this success, over 1,000 patients are estimated 
to die each year in the U.S. because a suita ble matched donor cannot be identified.  Thus, the 
development of suitable approaches for alterna tive mismatched donors represents an important 
issue in the field of HSCT.  Cost is also a consideration for alternative donor strategies, as overa ll transplant costs, 
duration of hospitalization, and donor acquisition fees vary by graft source and are greatly 
increased in unrelated transplants.  A recen tly published single-institution report of pediatric 
allogeneic HSCT demonstrated the increased co sts of unrelated donor and umbilical cord blood 
transplants compared to matched related donor transplants.  For 2004-2006, the mean costs per day survived were $3,446 for matched related donors (median duration of  hospitalization 36 
days), $4,050 for matched unrelated donors (media n duration of hospitalization 47 days), and 
$4,522 for umbilical cord blood recipients (median duration of hospitalization 57 days).  Additionally, costs of graft acquisition varied by donor s ource.  The mean costs of graft 
acquisition were $8,891 for matched related do nors, $57,134 for matched unrelated donors, and 
$58,910 for umbilical cord blood
9.  Thus, an unrelated donor source adds approximately 
$100,000 to the cost of the first 3 months of HSCT medical care.  
Historical Haploidentical HSCT 
 Since individuals share exactly one HLA haplot ype with each biologic al parent or child 
and with half of one’s siblings, haploidentical relatives can be  identified quickly as a readily 
available source of stem cells for virtually all patie nts.  Historically, haploHSCT has been 
associated with significant risks of graft rejection and severe GVHD
10-12 , which are 
manifestations of excessive alloreactivity by host13 and donor T cells14, respectively.  The risk of 
severe GVHD may be reduced in in tensively conditioned recipients of grafts that have been 
rigorously depleted of mature T cells or selectiv ely depleted of alloreactive T cells, so called T 
cell depleted (TCD) grafts, but the risks of se rious infection and deat h from prolonged immune 
compromise in these patients remains high15-20. Mortality from CMV dis ease alone was 14% in a 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 12recent study of nonmyeloablative 
transplantation using HLA-haploidentical donors
21 and as high as 
35% in other reports from all causes16-18 
 TCD haploidentical grafts with “megadoses” of CD34
+ cells have 
achieved acceptable engraftment rates
22. This approach was tested in a 
phase II clinical trial at MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC) using a reduced-intensity conditioning regimen with fludarabine, melphalan and thiotepa (FMT) for patients with hematologic malignancies
23. A high 
rate of disease relapse and serious infectious complications occurred, similar to previous reports
19-21;24-27. 
Patients with AML/MDS and high disease burden at the time of transplant (>10% blasts) had a particularly poor outcome ( Figure 1 ) 
23.  These results were confirmed in a 
large retrospective study summarizing the experi ence of haploHSCT with  T-cell depletion in 
Europe28. Thus, the use of a T-cell depleted (T CD) graft, even with increased CD34+ stem cells, 
decreases the rate of GVHD at the expense of a higher risk of re jection, reduced  graft-versus-
leukemia effect, and severe infections29. Thus, to reduce toxicity and improve the efficacy of 
haploidentical HSCT, methods to selectively inhibit a lloreactivity while pr eserving immunity to 
infection and the malignancy are needed30. 
 
The use of cyclophosphamide as a post-transplant immunosuppressant 
Cyclophosphamide (Cy) is a highly immunosuppre ssive antineoplastic agent that has an 
established role in conditioning for HSCT. Typically, the drug is administered prior to 
transplantation to prevent graf t rejection by suppressing the host immune system.  However, pre-
transplantation conditioning with Cy also increases  the risk of GVHD following allogeneic T 
cell infusion in mouse models31.  In contrast, administration of a properly timed, high dose of Cy 
after  HSCT inhibits both graft rejection and GVHD32-35 .    
 
Initial results of haploHSCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide at JHU  
In light of these observations, a non-myeloabl ative conditioning regimen was developed at 
Johns Hopkins University (JHU) for transplantation of T cell replete, unmanipulated marrow from haploidentical first-degree relatives 
36.  The main goal of this study was to titrate the dose 
of post-transplantation Cy (PT/Cy) given in conj unction with pre-transpla ntation fludarabine and 
total body irradiation (TBI).  All patients r eceived mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus, 
beginning on day 4 or 5 and terminating on da ys 35 and 50-180, respectively, to reduce the 
incidence and severity of GVHD (s ee Figure 2).  At the same time,  a trial was being conducted in 
Seattle utilizing Cy 50mg/kg IV on day 3 only and MMF three times a day. All study subjects 
had poor risk hematologic malignancies. A total of 68 patients were consecutively enrolled on 
these two protocols. The median tim es to neutrophil and platelet r ecovery for all patients were 15

 13 
and 24 days, respectively. Graft failure occurred in  a total of 15/84 patients (18%): 6 of 19 (32%) 
in the Hopkins group that  received only one dose of PT/Cy, 3 of 26 (12%) in the Seattle group 
that received one dose of PT/Cy, and 6 of 39 (15%) in the Hopkins  group that received 2 doses 
of PT/Cy, indicating that 2 doses of post-transp lant cyclophosphamide was more efficacious at 
preventing engraftment failure. Al l but two of the patients w ith graft failure experienced 
recovery of autologous hematopoiesis, with median times to neutrophil and platelet engraftment 
of 15 days (range 11-48 days) and 24 da ys (range 15-395 da ys), respectively. Graft rejection 
occurred in 9 of 66 evaluable pa tients (13%). All but 1 patient with graft failure experienced 
recovery of autologous hematopoiesis with median  times to neutrophil a nd platelet engraftment 
of 15 days (range: 11-42 days) and 28 da ys (range: 0-395 days), respectively.  
For the entire population of patients transplanted in these two studies, the probabilities of 
grades II-IV and III-IV aGVHD by day 200 were 34% and 6%, 
respectively. There was no 
statistically significant difference 
in the probability of aGVHD 
between patients who received 1 
versus 2 doses of post 
transplantation Cy. However, the 
incidence of extensive cGVHD at 
1 year in the group of patients who 
received 2 doses of post 
transplantation Cy (5%) was 
suggestively lower than the 
incidence of extensive cGVHD in the group of patients who received 1 dose of post 
transplantation Cy (25%; hazard ratio [HR] 0.21; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-1.01; P = 
.05). The probabilities of NRM at 100 days and at 1 year after transplanta tion were 4% and 15%, 
respectively, and the probabilities of relapse at 1 and 2 years after transp lantation were 51% and 
58%, respectively. At a median follow-up amon g survivors of 745 days (range: 112-1483 days), 
the actuarial OS at 1 and at 2 years was 46% and 36%, respectively. The actuarial EFS at 1 and 
at 2 years was 34% and 26%, respectively. OS and EFS were not statis tically significantly 
different between groups (data not shown).  
Furthermore, CMV reactivation was observed in 17 of  45 (38%) high-risk patients with a 
median time to reactivation of 34 days. Proved or probable invasive mold infections post 
transplant, all caused by Aspergillus  sp, were observed in 5 of 68 (7%) patients. Two patients 
died from Aspergillus  infection: 1 while persistently neut ropenic following graft failure, and 1 
with fungal sinusitis. There was no CMV-associated mortality36.  
 
Results of haploHSCT with post-transplant cyclophosphamide in the BMT-CTN 
 Based on the promising results using post-tr ansplant Cy in the two pilot studies, two 
Phase 2 trials (Protocols 0603, 0604)  were conducted by Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical 
Trials Network for adults with leukemia or  lymphoma and no suitable related donor were 
conducted and published recently37. Either double umbilical cord blood (dUCB) or 
haploidentical bone marrow was utilized as stem  cell source with RIC using cyclophosphamide, 
fludarabine, and 200 cGy of total body irradiation.  Figure 2. Schema

              Figure 3. Results of BMT-CTN dUCBT and haploBMT trials  
The 1-year probabilities of 
overall and progression-free survival were 54% and 46%, respectively, after dUCB transplantation (n = 50) and 62% and 48%, respectively, after haploBMT (n = 50). The cumulative incidence of neutrophil recovery was 94% after dUCB and 96% after haploBMT. The 100-day cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD was 40% after dUCB and 32% after haploBMT. The 1-year cumulative incidences of nonrelapse mortality and relapse after dUCB transplantation were 24% and 31%, respectively, with corresponding results of 7% and 
45%, respectively, after haploBMT (Figure 3). In 
summary trend towards reduced NRM for haploB MT was balanced by increased relapse as 
compared to dUCB to yield almost equivalent 1 yr overall and progression free survival (Figure 
3).  
Post-transplant Cy in matched HSCT with full-intensity conditioning 
 Relapse was the major source of treatment failure for patients in each of the haploHSCT 
studies described above. Potential explanations ar e that the transplantation conditioning intensity 
was not sufficient to achieve adequate tumor cytoreduction or to augment a graft-versus-host reaction through epithel ial tissue damage.  
Post-transplant Cy in combination with Bu  Cy myeloablative conditioning was used for 
HLA-matched HSCT at JHU in study J0373, which enrolled 117 patients (median age 50, range 21-66) with advanced hematologic malignancies
38. These patients received HLA-matched related 
(n=78) or unrelated (n=39) bone marrow transplants after conditioning with busulfan on days -7 to -3 and Cy (50 mg/kg/day) on days -2 and -1, +3, and +4 and no additional GVHD prophylaxis. The incidences of acute grades  II through IV and grades III through IV GVHD for all patients 
were 43% and 10%, respectively. The nonrelap se mortality at day 100 and 2 years after 
transplantation were 9% and 17%, respectively. The actuarial overall survival and event-free survivals at 2 years after transplantation were 55% and 39%, respectively, for all patients and 63% and 54%, respectively, for patients who underw ent transplantation while in remission. With 
a median follow-up of 26.3 months among surv iving patients, the cumulative incidence of 
chronic GVHD is 10%. Seven pediatric patients w ith high risk hematologic malignancies were 
treated in the same way and al l patients engrafted, none of th e patients had aGVHD or cGVHD 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 15and there were no TRMs. Two out of the eight pa tients relapsed. One patient with early ALL 
relapse who was transplanted wi thout evidence of disease but with aplasia after reinduction 
chemotherapy relapsed early post transplant and one patient with AML relapsed two years post 
BMT. These results suggest that high-dose post transplantation cyclophosphamide is an effective 
single-agent prophylaxis of acute and chronic GVHD after BuCy conditioning and HLA-
matched BMT39. 
 
Myeloablative conditioning with post-transplant Cy for haploHSCT 
The combination of myeloablativ e conditioning with a haploide ntical graft source and post 
transplant Cy was studied at JHU.  This tria l combined the Bu/Cy myeloablative preparative 
regimen utilized in the matche d setting (J0373) with the post tr ansplantation immunosuppression 
utilized in the nonmyeloablative setting (J 9966 and J0457: tid MMF and FK506), along with 
post-

transplantation Cy on days +3 and +4 utilized in both trials in an effort to achieve the same low 
toxicity profile while augmenting diseas e response and decreasing relapse rates39.  All patients 
with high risk hematologic malignancies received a busulfan and cyclophosphamide preparative regimen except those with ALL or lymphoblas tic lymphoma who received a TBI based 
preparative regimen (Figure 4). The primary obj ective was to establish feasibility (day 60 
engraftment). Ninety-six patients were evaluated on this protocol. Median age of the patients is 42y (1y-65y). Median total nucleated cell (TNC)/kg cells infused 4.8x10
8. Disease breakdown 
included 42 patients with AML, 21 patients wi th ALL, 2 patients with bilineage leukemia, 12 
patients with MDS, 4 patients with CML, 11 patie nts with lymphoma and 4 patients with other 
diagnosis. Donor engraftment at Day 60 was obs erved in 91% of patie nts (80/88 evaluable 
patients). The median time to neutrophil recovery is 24 days and platelet recovery is 29 days. 
The cumulative incidence of TRM at 100 days was 6%, and at 1 year 11%. The cumulative 
incidence of acute GVHD grades 2-4 was 17% at  100 days and severe acute GVHD grades 3-4 
was 7% at 100 days, and chroni c GVHD (cGVHD) at one year was 15%, with 5% moderate-
severe cGVHD. The one-year cumulative incidence of relapse in this group of patients with high-risk malignancy is 36%. Overall survival  at 1 year is 72% and EFS is 56%. CMV

 16reactivation was seen in 22% at risk, and 
hemorrhagic cystitis was seen in 24% of 
patients (all BK+ and 70% grades 1-2).  
In a recent report from Italy, 50 
patients received unmanipulated haploHSCT following myeloablative conditioning with busulfan, fludarabine, and thiotepa followed by post transplant Cy, CSA, and MMF
40.  
This was a high-risk population of patients with lymphoid and myeloid malignancies, 54% of whom were not in remission at the time of transplant and 20% of whom had received a prior alloHSCT.  Engraftment was 90%; grade 2-4 acute GvHD 12%, and moderate chronic GvHD 10%.  The 2-year DFS was 68% for those transplanted in CR and 37% for those not in remission at transplant, with overall TRM of 18% and a relapse rate of 26%.  Bashey et al from 
Atlanta treated 20 patients who did not have suitable matched related or unrelated donors with a myeloablative preparative regimen consisting of fluda rabine, busulfan, 
pretransplant cyclophosphamide (14.5mg/kg) and post transplant cyclophosphamide (50mg/kg/dx2) with haploidentical 
unmanipulated peripheral blood stem cells for 
adults with hematological malignancies. Donor engraftment occurred in all 20 patients with full donor T cell and myeloid chimerism 
by day 130. The cumulative incidence of grades II-IV and III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) was 30% and 10%, respectively. The cumulative incidence of  chronic GVHD (cGVHD) was 35%. Nonrelapse 
mortality (NRM) at 100 days an d 1 year was 10% for all patien ts and 0% for standard-risk 
patients. With a median follow-up of 20 months, th e estimated 1-year overall survival (OS) and 
disease-free survival (DFS) wa s 69% and 50%, respectively, for all patients, and 88% and 67% 
for standard-risk patients
41. 
MDACC recently published their results of a myeloablative haploBMT with fludarabine, 
melphalan, and thiotepa (FMT), in order to  compare the outcomes with concurrent TCD 
aploHSCT that received the same FMT conditioning regimen42.  They analyzed 65 consecutive 
adult patients with hematologic malignancies who received T-cell replete (N = 32) or TCD (N = 
33) haploHSCT. The TCR group received post-tran splantation treatment with Cy, tacrolimus, 
and MMF. Patients with TCD received antit hymocyte globulin followed by infusion of 
CD34+selected cells with no post-transplantation immunosuppression. The majority of patients 
in each group had active disease at the time of  transplantation.  Engraftment was achieved in

plant.

 1794% of TCD versus 81% of TCR (NS). The TCR tr ansplants were superior, however, in NRM at 
1 year (16% versus 42%, P = .02), overall survival (64% vers us 30%, P = 0.02) and progression-
free survival (50% versus 21%, P = 0.02) whether or not the patien ts were in remission at the 
time of transplant (Figure 5 ). The TCR cohort had a non-signifi cant trend toward reduced grade 
II-IV aGVHD (20% versus 11% , P = 0.20), and a significant decrease in cGVHD (7% versus 
18%, P = 0.03).  Improved reconstitution of T cell subsets, NK cells, and a lower rate of 
infection were observed in the TCR post-transplant Cy group.   
Experience in pediatric patients receivi ng haploHSCT with post-transplant Cy 
Twenty-nine pediatric patients <24 years of age ha ve been treated at JHU using a myeloablative 
haploHSCT with the post-transplant Cy platform depicted in Figur e 4.  Median age for this group 
of patients was 14y (range 1y-24y). Median time to neutrophil recovery was 24 days and platelet 
recovery was 29 days. Donor engraftment at Day 60 was 96%. The three year  overall survival is 
75%. Acute GvHD grades 2-4 occu rred in 16%, and aGvHD grades  3-4 in 7%.  The cumulative 
incidence of chronic GvHD is 25%, 12% moderate -severe. The cumulative incidence of TRM is 
11% and relapse at 3 years 25%43.  
 Stem cell source- bone marrow vs. mobilized peripheral blood 
Some studies have demonstrated that peripheral blood grafts have a higher sustained 
engraftment rate than marrow grafts in the matched unrelated setting after nonmyeloablative 
conditioning. (85% vs. 56%, p=.007)
44. In one trial, a multivariate statistical analysis identified 
significantly increased risks of graft rejection for patients who received marrow instead of 
peripheral blood (PB) grafts (p=.003) and t hose without preceding chemotherapy (p=.003). 
However, the same study also showed the probab ility of severe GVHD grades III-IV was higher 
among PB recipients (11% vs. 0%, p=.05).  Additionally, Anasetti et al conducted a phase III multicenter trial randomizing patients to rece ive PBSC versus bone marrow from unrelated 
donors that enrolled 551 patients. There was no significant survival difference between PBSC 
and BMT from unrelated donors. There was a sligh tly higher rate of gr aft failure with bone 
marrow (9% vs. 3%, p=0.002) but a higher rate of cGVHD with PBSC versus BM (53% vs. 41%, p=0.01)
45. Given our successful engraftment rate s with BM on the nonmyeloablative and 
myeloablative haploidentical HSCT protocols and the myeloa blative matched related or 
unrelated protocols as well as the increased risk for severe GVHD using haploidentical donors, 
this trial will be restricted to BM as the stem cell source. 
 
Use of a Cy/TBI prep in ALL patients 
Preparative regimens utilizing busulfan and Cy versus Cy and TBI have been compared 
in children receiving bone marrow transplants fo r hematologic malignancies. It has been shown 
that for pediatric patients (age < 20 years) with  acute lymphoblastic leuk emia, a TBI based prep 
regimen resulted in superior overall survival (55% v 40%, p=0.003) and three-year leukemia free 
survival (50% v 35%, p=0.005). In addition, treatm ent related mortality was higher in the Bu/Cy 
group (RR, 1.68, p=0.012), as were death and tr eatment failure (p=0.017 for death and p=0.006 
for relapse)46. Thus, patients with acute lymphocytic  leukemia will receive a Cy/TBI based 
preparative regimen on this trial.  
Shortened Duration Tacrolimus 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 18Kasamon et al presented the JHH data using shortened duration tacrolimus at the American 
Society of Hematology 2016 annual meeting. In this trial, tacrolimus was discontinued at Day 60 
or Day 90 after nonmyeloblative haploBMT instead of the historical Day +180. Of the 47 pts in 
the Day 90 cohort (median follow-up 44 months),  23 (49%) stopped tacro early as planned. 
Safety stopping criteria were not met. Of these 23 patients, 16 (70%) had no safety events before 
Day 180, 5 (22%) developed grade 2 acute GVHD (1  complicated by severe  chronic GVHD) and 
2 (9%) developed grade 3-4 acute GVHD. Of the 55 patients in the Day 60 cohort (median follow-up 14 months), 38 (69%) stopped tacro early as planned, and safety stopping criteria were 
likewise not met. Of these 38 patients, 25 (66%) had no safety events before Day 180, 1 
developed graft failure, 9 (24%) developed gr ade 2 acute GVHD and 3 (8%) developed grade 3-
4 acute GVHD. In both cohorts, the D 180 cumulati ve incidence (CuI) of grade 2-4 acute GVHD 
was < 40% and was < 10% for gr ade 3-4 acute GVHD and NRM. The 1-year CuI of any chronic 
GVHD was 11% for the Day 90 arm and 13% for the Day 60 arm (12% historically).  Risks of 
acute GVHD, chronic GVHD, graft fa ilure and NRM appear similar to  historical outcomes with 
tacro until Day 180. These data show that many pts (60% in this trial)  can discontinue tacro 
without taper well before Day 180. The favorable t oxicity profile of the PTCy platform, coupled 
with the feasibility and safety of early tacro cessation, provides an idea l setting to incorporate 
posttransplantation approaches for rela pse reduction (Kasamon, ASH abstracts, 
Blood 2016 
128:831) . JHH has since adopted Day +90 as its time point to stop and/or wean tacro (over 4 
weeks) after myeloablative and/or  nonmyeloablative haploBMT.  
 
Second Transplants for Relapsed Disease 
Relapse of the primary malignancy after hema topoietic stem cell tr ansplantation is a 
common cause of transplant failure. In the pediatric population one in three children will likely 
relapse following HSCT. In a retr ospective study of 77 consecutive patients aged 2 to 51 years 
who relapsed after allogeneic HSCT, pediatri c patients fared much better than the adults47. 
Disease Free Survival (DFS) in the 19 pediatric patients in this study was 44%. In a subsequent 
dedicated pediatric study of 25 patie nts, the 10 year survival was 48%48. Second allogeneic 
HSCT has been considered as a potential treatme nt option for patients who relapse following a 
first transplant. A recent retrospective mu lti-center pediatric study including 532 patients49  
evaluated the outcome of the 160 patients (30 %) who relapsed.  The tr eatment options after 
relapse included: (a) Palliative therapy with  non-curative intent (n = 43); (b) Salvage 
chemotherapy without a second HSCT (n = 55), and (c) Salvage chemotherapy followed by second HSCT (n = 62). The one-year DFS of th e patients who underwent a second transplant 
was 50%, and this dropped to 35% at year two. In comparison, those who did not undergo 
second transplant had a 9% and 2% one and tw o year DFS, respectively (P=<0.0001).  After the 
second transplant, 43 (69 %) of the patients died; 24 % from non-relapse causes and the 
remaining from relapse of primary disease. Patien ts with NRM died at a median of 2 months. A 
multivariate analysis of this cohort showed that the outcome of the second transplant improved in 
proportion to the length of time to relapse followi ng the first transplant. Furthermore, a time to 
relapse of more than twelve months from the fi rst transplant, and receiv ing a second transplant 
were the only significant factors influencing overall outcome.  In a second retrospective analysis 
at a single institution, 40 of 93 (43%) patients expe rienced relapse after a first alloHCT. Eleven 
patients underwent a second alloHCT. The three-year  overall survival probability in patients who 
underwent a second transplant was 27% (95% CI  6.5-54%) versus 5.4% (95% CI 0-20%,) for 
those who did not receive a second transplant. Eight (72%) died from post-HCT complications 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 19including infection, multisystem organ failure, and sinusoidal obstructive syndrome. (N. Shah; 
personal communication, manuscript submitted) 
In this protocol, we plan to include  patients who have relapsed after a 1st HSCT as 
separate cohort, based on the experience with se cond transplant in the pe diatric setting and the 
low rates of TRM and infectious complications thus far in the myeloablative haploidentical 
setting. Indeed, two pediatric s econd transplant recipients on th e JHH protocol are long-term 
survivors. Outcome in second transplant recipien ts has historically b een considerably worse 
because of both TRM and relapse compared with patients who undergo their first HSCT. Thus, 
this small cohort of patients would be consid ered separately from patients receiving a first 
transplant, and providing descriptive outcome results with appropriate stopping rules for 
excessive TRM as described in the statistical section. 
Summary  
Multiple institutions have demonstrated the safe ty and feasibility of haploidentical HSCT 
after myeloablative conditioning with post-transplant Cy, and JHH has preliminary data 
demonstrating promising results in children.  We propose a multi-institu tional phase II study in 
children with high-risk leukemias in 1st CR, acute leukemias in 2nd CR, MDS, and JMML.  The 
myeloablative conditioning regimen prescribed will be TBI-based for lymphoid leukemias and 
busulfan-based for myeloid leukemias, or for ly mphoid leukemias in which a TBI-based regimen 
was used for the first transplant.  Our goal is to establish an easily exportable, inexpensive 
platform for haplotransplantation that has a safe ty profile equivalent to matched related and 
unrelated BMTs.  The primary objective will be to estimate the incidence of 6-month non-relapse mortality, hypothesizing that NRM is < 18%. Th is is slightly higher than the 15%  Johns 
Hopkins has seen in the combined adult and pedi atric data on the myeloablative haploidentical 
BMT protocol with PT/Cy, and within the ra nge of published TRM data for myeloablative 
haploBMT within PT/Cy as mentioned above (10-18%).

3.1 Recipient eligibility  
 3.1.1 Patient age 0.5-25years   3.1.2  Lack of a suitable HLA-matched related donor  
 3.1.3 Patients must have a first-degree related donor or half-sibling who is at minimum  
HLA haploidentical to be enrolled.  The donor and recipient must be identical at at least 
one allele of each of the following genetic  loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-Cw, HLA-DRB1, 
and HLA-DQB1. A minimum match of 5/10 is th erefore required, and will be considered 
sufficient evidence that the donor and recipient share one HLA haplotype.  
 3.1.4 An unrelated donor search is not required for a patient to be eligible for this protocol, or a 
donor search and donor mobilization may be abandoned if the clinical situation dictates an urgent transplant.  Clinical urgency is defined as high likelihood that greater 6-8 weeks will 
be required to proceed to transplant or a low-likelihood of finding a matched, unrelated 
donor.

 Institution with any donor selection questions. Dr. Symons can  help with donor selection upon 
request.  
4.0 Treatment Plan  
4.1  Indwelling central venous catheter 
Placement of a double lumen central venous catheter will be required for administration 
of IV medications and transfus ion of blood products, as per standard BMT requirements.  
This catheter may be removed and replaced as  clinically indicated. However, the graft 
MUST be infused through a central line. 
 4.2  Pre-treatment Evaluation 
All patients will require documentation of a detailed history and physical examination 
and standard BMT evaluation of cardiac, pu lmonary, liver and rena l function. All patients 
with leukemia will undergo a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy for morphological, cytogenetic and flow cy tometric evaluation.  
 4.3  Preparative regimen administration:  4.3.1 Appropriate seizure prophylaxis  (Keppra preferred) for patie nts above 10 years of age who 
are receiving busulfan will be administered. If institutional practice is to provide seizure prophylaxis for patients <10years of age, that is not a protocol violation. 
4.3.2 IV Busulfan will be administ ered at a starting dosage of: 
<12 kg: 1.1mg/kg/dose Q 6 hours IV (each dose over 2 hours) for 4 days (16 doses) 
>12 kg: 0.8mg/kg/dose Q 6 hours IV (each dose over 2 hours) for 4 days (16 doses) 
 OR <12 kg: 1.1mg/kg/dose Q 6 hours IV (each dose over 2 hours) for 4 days (16 doses) 
< 6 years of age and >/= 12 kg: 32mg/m2/dose Q 6 hours IV (each dose over 2 hours) for 4 days 
(16 doses) 6 years of age and older: 0.8mg/kg/dose Q 6 hour s IV (each dose over 2 hours) for 4 days (16 
doses)  It is recommended that the dose be based on the lesser of ideal body weight and actual body 
weight, however, dosing per institutional standards is allowed.  For q 6 hour dosing, IV Busulfan is  diluted in 5% Dextrose or NS  for IV infusion over 2 hours. 
For accurate pharmacokinetics, it is recommended that the IV tubing be primed with drug, and 
connected as close as possible to the patient’s central venous catheter. At the conclusion of the 2 hour infusion, it is recommended that the tubing mu st be disconnected so that no additional drug 
is given. With IV administration, blood sample s will be drawn accord ing to institutional 
protocol. The first dose should be administered  in the evening. Busulfan kinetics should be 
drawn with the first dose. Samples will be sent  to a reference laboratory to quantify each 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 24individual patient’s busulfan concentratio ns and subsequently undergo pharmacokinetic 
modeling to determine the indivi dual’s AUC and clearance. Targ et AUC is 800-1400, target Css 
is 600-900.  
 IV Busulfan may be given once daily as a 3 hour infusion as per in stitutional standards as long as 
pharmacokinetics are drawn around a test dose or th e first dose. For 24 hr dosing, target AUC is 
3600-6000 
uMol*min  per day based on the dose being infused over 3 hours.  
 If dose adjustments are made, repeat kinetics  should be performed if  at all possible to 
demonstrate the target AUC or Css was obtained.   4.3.3 Cyclophosphamide will be given at a dose of  50 mg/kg/day IV over 1-2 hours x 2 days on 
day -2 and day -1. Dosing of cyclophosphamide is based on the LESSER of ideal body weight 
and actual body weight (ABW). Hyperhydration and maintenance of significant urine output 
after administration is required. Recommendations in clude starting intravenous  fluids at least 2 
hours prior to cyclophosphamide and continuing fo r at least 8 hr post-cyclophosphamide. Fluids 
may be tailored to the individu al patient and this will not resu lt in any protocol violations. 
Recommended hydration: Hydration with ½ NS at 2x maintenance IV will be started 2 hours 
prior to cyclophosphamide and conti nued for 8 hours post-cyclophosphamide. 
 
Ideal Body Weight (IBW) Children (1-18 years)         IBW (kg) =((height in cm)2  x 1.65) / 1000 Children (5 feet and taller) 
        IBW (male) = 39 + (2.27 x height in inches >60)         IBW (female) = 42.2 + (2.27 x height in inches >60) Adults (18 years and older) 
        IBW (male) = 50 + (2.3 x height in inches >60) 
        IBW (female) = 45.5 + (2.3 x height in inches >60) 
 
  
Mesna will be given to prevent hemorrhagic cy stitis at >80% of cy clophosphamide dosing per 
institutional standards.  Recommended but not mandatory  MESNA administration:  
Mesna 10 mg/kg lesser of IBW or ABW/dose IV  mixed with cyclophosphamide over 1 hour, 
followed immediately by Mesna 40mg/kg lesser of  IBW or ABW IV continuous infusion 
between hours 1-13 once daily.    It is recommended that patients achieve and maintain a urine output over > 3ml/kg/hr before 
administering cyclophosphamide a nd throughout administration. Urinalysis will be performed to 
detect evidence of hemorrhagic cystitis, a known complication of high-dose Cy therapy. 
 4.3.4 TBI will be given to those patients with ac ute lymphocytic leukemia, or for patients who 
have had a prior non-TBI-based BMT. Individual  institutions can also choose to give a TBI 
based regimen for patients with mixed phenotyp e leukemia. All patients will receive 1200 cGy 
of total body irradiation (eithe r 200 cGy bid x 3 days beginning on Day -3 or 150 cGy bid x 4 
days beginning on Day -4.). If TBI is over 4 days, then cyclophosphamide will be given on Days -6 and -5)
. Patients will be simulated for radiation prior to  the start of their transplant preparative 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 25regimen and the final TBI dose rate, field arrangem ents, treatment distance, field size, and beam 
energy will follow the recommendations of radiation oncology in adhere nce to institutional 
guidelines. TBI will be given at low-dose rate.  
Important considerations for TBI: 
- Effort should be made to avoid interruptions in TBI administration 
- The inter-fraction interval sha ll be no less than 5 hours between treatments (sta rt to start) 
- A mid-plane dose rate of between 6 and 15cGy per minute is required 
 
Restricting the lung dose to < 800 cG y is required on this protocol . This requirement applies to 
both AP/PA and lateral treatments. To limit overall total lung dose to < 800 cGy, partial 
transmission lung blocks can be used. For AP/P A treatments the lung blocks may be placed in 
both AP and PA fields or alternat ively in just the AP or PA fiel d alone. Partial transmission lung 
blocks can be used to lim it the overall total lung dose. 
Institutions are allowed to us e their preferred method of beam attenuation to achieve the dose 
reduction to lungs.   Any patient who is felt to warrant additional cranio or craniospinal irradiation based on CNS disease risk or testicular radi ation will be addressed on a case by case basis by the oncology and 
radiation oncology teams and should be discussed with the PI. TBI may be given before Cy (TBI 
Days -5 through -3 or -6 through -3 and Cy Days -2 and -1 for scheduling issues. TBI may also be given once a day in the pm on Day -3 (200 cgY), twice a day on Days -2 and -1 (200 cGy 
twice a day) and once a day on Day 0 in the am (200cGy) for scheduling issues. 
 
4.3.5 Unmanipulated bone marrow on Day 0 must be infused at least 24 hour s after the last dose 
of Cy. Graft may be infused on the same day as TBI administration as long as there is 4-6 hours 
between administration of TBI and infusion of bone marrow. 
 One day of rest may be added between Days -1 and Day 0 prior to bone marrow infusion, 
depending on donor availability, operating room schedules, and as clinically indicated. 
 
4.4  Marrow processing and infusion 
 
On Day 0, patients will receive unprocessed marrow unless there is a major ABO 
incompatibility, in which case red blood cells  will be depleted from the donor marrow 
using institutional practices.  Minor ABO incompatible grafts will have plasma removed. 
Institutional practices will determine if there will be processing for minor ABO 
incompatibilities. Donor bone marrow will be harvested with a target yield of 4 x 10
8 
nucleated cells/kg recipient IBW, and a recommended minimum yield of 2.5 x 108 
nucleated cells/kg of recipi ent IBW. We recommend taki ng no more than 10 mL per 
aspirate. In addition to calc ulating the total nuc leated cell dose /kg, a sample of the 
product to be infused will be sent for flow  cytometry to determine the content of 
CD34+cells. The use of cryopreserve d marrow is not permitted.  
 
4.5  Post-transplantation cyclophosphamide 
 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 26Cyclophosphamide will be given at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day IV over 1 hour x 2 days on 
day +3 and day +4 post-transplant. Begin Day +3 cyclophosphamide 60-72 hours after 
the start of bone marrow infusion. Dosing of cyclophosphamide is based on the LESSER 
of ideal body weight and actua l body weight (ABW). Hyper hydration and maintenance of 
significant urine output after administration is required.  Recommendations include 
starting intravenous fluids at least 2 hours pr ior to cyclophosphamide and continuing for 
at least 8 hr post-cyclophosphamide. Fluids ma y be tailored to the individual patient and 
this will not result in any protocol viol ations. Recommended hydration: Hydration with ½ 
NS at 2x maintenance IV will be started 2 hours prior to cyclophosphamide and 
continued for 8 hours post-cyclophosphamide.  Mesna will be given to prevent hemorrhagic  cystitis at >80% of cyclophosphamide 
dosing per institutional standards.  Recommended but not mandatory  MESNA administration:  
Mesna 10 mg/kg lesser of IBW or ABW/dose IV mixed with cyclophosphamide over 1 
hour, followed immediately by Mesna 40mg/kg lesser of IBW or ABW IV continuous infusion between hours 1-13 once daily.   
 
It is recommended that patients achieve an d maintain a urine ou tput over > 3ml/kg/hr 
before administering cyclophosphamide and throughout administration. Urinalysis will be performed to detect evidence of hemorrh agic cystitis, a know n complication of high-
dose Cy therapy. 
 
It is crucial that no immunosuppressive  agents are given until 24 hours after the 
completion of the post-transplant Cy. This includes corticosteroids as antiemetics. 
Corticosteroids used for adrenal support or during a medical emergency (e.g. treatment of 
anaphylaxis) will not be a violation of the protocol.  
4.6  GVHD prophylaxis 
On day +5, patients will begin prophylaxis with Tacrolimus and Mycophenolate Mofetil 
(MMF).  Begin these at least 24 hour s after the last PT/Cy infusion.  
 The recommended starting dose of tacrol imus is 0.015mg/kg IBW/dose IV over 4 hours 
every 12 hours. Serum trough levels of tacr olimus should be measured around D+7 and 
the dose should be adjusted based on this level to maintain a level of 5-15 ng/ml (or institutional equivalent). Institutional standards (i.e. continuous infusion, etc.) of administering tacrolimus is allowed as long as tacrolimus is started on Day +5 and trough levels are maintained between 5-15 ng/ml (o r institutional equivalent).  Tacrolimus 
should be converted to oral dosing when patien t has a stable, therapeu tic level and is able 
to tolerate food or other oral medications. For pediatric patients, the oral dosing is 
approximately two to four times the IV dosing. It is recommended that serum trough levels should be checked at steady state af ter any dose modification and when switching 
from IV to oral to ensure therapeutic trough concentrations . Serum trough concentrations 
should be checked at a minimum weekly ther eafter and the dose adju sted accordingly to 
maintain a level of 5-15 ng/ml. Tacrolimus can be discontinued or weaned as early as 
Day +90 if the patient has full engraftment and no evidence of GVHD. If weaning, please 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 27wean by approximately 25% per week such that tacro is discontinued after 4 weeks. At 
the latest, tacrolimus  will be discontinued after the last dose around Day 180, or may be 
continued if active GVHD is present. This s hould be discussed with the PI. Tacrolimus 
may also be discontinued early if  patients relapse. This should  also be discussed with the 
PI.  Mycophenolic acid mofetil (MMF) will be give n at a dose of 15mg/ kg/dose po or IV TID 
(based upon actual body weight ) with the maximum total daily dose not to exceed 3 
g/day (1 g po/IV TID). MMF prophylaxis will be discontinued after the last dose on D35 unless there is concern about engraftment a nd/or GVHD. Concerns should be discussed 
directly with the PI.  
 4.7  Supportive care  
Patients will receive transfusions, nutri tional support, infection prophylaxis and 
treatment, and other supportive care accordin g to standard of care and institutional 
guidelines. Infection prophylaxis should include, but is not limited to, agents or strategies 
(e.g. PCR screening and preemptive therapy) to  reduce the risk of bacterial, herpes 
simplex, CMV, Pneumocystis jiroveci, and fungal infections. GCSF is not routinely 
given prior to engraftment on this protocol. Reasons to give GCSF prior to engraftment 
can include circumstances such as neutropeni a with severe infection.  The PI should be 
notified. If GSCF will be given, the dose shou ld be 5 mcg/kg daily. After engraftment, 
filgrastim may be given for severe neutropenia (ANC < 500/μ L), without discussion with 
the PI. Other reasons for neutropenia should be considered such as bactrim or other myelosuppressive drugs.  Othe r growth factors (GM-CSF, erythropoietin) should be 
given only if clin ically indicated. 
 
4.8  Anti-ovulatory treatment  
Menstruating females must begin an anti-o vulatory agent per institutional guidelines 
before starting the preparative regimen.  
 
4.10 Post-BMT intrathecal chemotherapy Post-BMT intrathecal chemotherapy may be given or not given as per institutional practice.  
Intrathecal chemotherapy (IT) may not be star ted before Day +30 an d, ideally, should begin 
when platelets are > 50,000 with out supportive transfusions. IT chemo may be started with 
platelet transfusion suppor t if platelets have not recovered by Day +60.

5.0 DATA MONITORING  AND MANAGEMENT  
This study will be conducted in compliance wi th the JHM-IRB approve d SKCCC Coordinating 
Center Operations Manual. The protocol chair,  Dr. Heather Symons, will serve as liaison and 
will coordinate protocol development, submissi on, approval, amendments, results reporting and 
publications.  
 
5.1 General Guidelines 
 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 29Eligible patients will be regi stered on study centrally at the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive 
Cancer Center.  
 
Patients should be registered by two weeks be fore the start of prep regimen. Following 
registration, patients should begin protocol treatment within two w eeks. Issues that would cause 
treatment delays should be discussed with th e Principal Investigator . The Study Coordinator 
should be notified of cancellations as soon as possible. 
 
5.2 Registration Process 
 
A centralized, 3-part registration procedure will be used. After el igibility screening, patients who 
are selected to particip ate will be registered with the C oordinating Center (SKCCC) and with 
their study site/institution. A record  of patients who fail to meet entry criteria (i.e., screen 
failures) will be maintained by each individual si te. Patient registration must be complete before 
beginning any treatment or study activities.  
 
5.2.1 Coordinating Center (SKCCC) registration  
Prior to protocol enrollment and initiation of treatment, subjects must sign and date an IRB-
approved consent form.  To initiate registration, study sites/institutions should forward copies of 
the signed informed consent form, the research  authorization/HIPAA fo rm, the institutional 
registration form, plus any require d laboratory tests to the coordi nating center or sponsor by fax 
or email. Upon receipt of these forms, research  personnel at the coordinating center will confirm 
patient eligibility with study personnel, assign a unique patient study iden tification number, and 
complete patient registration. Treatment must not commence until the site has received their 
patient’s identification number. All patients must be registered centrally at SKCCC.  
 
To register a patient, participating sites must send the documents by email ( crocc@jhmi.edu )  
and CC the Lead Study Coordinator to the Coor dinating Center. The C oordinating Center fax 
(410-502-9933) may be used if email is not available.  
 Signed patient consent form  
 Registration Form 
 Eligibility Checklist  
 Copies of all source documentation of all clin ical studies confirming eligibility and HLA 
typing results 
 The Coordinating Center will review the documents  to confirm eligibility. To complete the 
registration process the Coor dinating Center will:  
• Assign a patient study number  
• Register the patient on the study wi th SKCCC’s CRO Coor dinating Center  
• Fax or e-mail the patient study numb er to the participating site  
 
The Johns Hopkins Pediatric Oncology Research Team will not register their patients through 
the SKCCC’s CRO Coordinating Center.  Eligibility  for Hopkins subjects will be reviewed and 
confirmed internally by the Pediatric Oncology Re search Team and verified by the Study PI.  A 
subject number, however, must be requested upon cons ent and prior to enrollment from the 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 30SKCCC’s CRO Coordinating Center via email or telephone.  The SK CCC CRO Coordinating 
Center Lead Study Coordinator will provi de this number to the study team. 
 
5.2.2 Institutional registration  
Patient registration at each study site/institution will be conducte d according to the institution’s 
established policies. Before registration, patients will be asked to sign and date an Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)-approved consent form and a research authorization/HIPAA form. Patients 
must be registered with their lo cal site/institution and also with  the sponsor before beginning any 
treatment or study activities.

5.4 Data Entry Data collected during this study will be entered into a secure database. 
 
5.4.1 Case Report Forms 
Case report forms will be genera ted by the Coordinating Center for the collection of all study 
data. Investigators will be responsible for en suring that the CRFs are kept up-to-date. 
 
5.4.2 Source Documents 
Study personnel will record clinical data in each  patient’s source documents (i.e., the patient’s 
medical record). Source documentation will be ma de available to support the patient research 
record. Study monitors will review entries on the CRFs at regular intervals, comparing the content with source documents. 
 
5.4.3 Data Submission 
All data will be collected on case report forms. Case report forms will be provided to participating sites by the Coordinating Center. A pr imary research data file (research chart) will 
be maintained at each site, and must include completed case report forms and copies of required source documentation. Copies of  the completed case report forms and source documents should 
be submitted to the Coordinating Center accord ing to the following recommended schedule via 
email (crocc@jhmi.edu).  
 
Baseline/ On Study Forms Submit within one week of screening

5.4.4 Record Retention 
The investigator will maintain ad equate and accurate records to  enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be  subsequently verified. After study closure, the 
investigator will maintain all source docum ents, study-related documents, and the CRFs. 
Because the length of time requi red for retaining records depends upon a number of regulatory 
and legal factors, documents should be stored until the investigator is notified that the documents 
may be destroyed. In this study, records are to be retained and securely stored for a minimum of 
7 years after the completion of all study activities. 
 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 325.5 Data Management 
 
5.5.1 Research Program Coordinators 
A Lead Research Program Coordinator at the C oordinating Center will be  assigned to the study 
and will manage the study activities at each of the participating sites. The responsibilities of the 
Research Program Coordinator include project compliance, data collect ion, data entry, data 
reporting, regulatory monitoring, problem resolution and prioritization, and coordination of the activities of the protocol team. 
 
5.6 Study Monitoring and Quality Assurance 
 
Regularly scheduled registration reports will be generated to monitor patient accruals and the 
completeness of registration data. Routine data quality reports will be generated to assess 
missing data and inconsistencies. Accrual rates and the extent and accuracy of evaluations and 
follow-up will be monitored periodically through out the study period, and potential problems 
will be brought to the attention of the Principal Investigator for discussion and action. 
 
Random-sample data quality monitoring will be conducted by the Coordinating Center at least 
every 6 months; and protocol compliance audits w ill be conducted by the Coordinating Center at 
least once a year and more frequently if indica ted. Audits by the Coordi nating Center may entail 
(1) faxing source documents and research records fo r selected patients from participating sites to 
the coordinating center for audit, or (2) on-si te auditing of selected  patient records at 
participating sites.   
All clinical work conducted under this protocol is subject to Good C linical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines. This includes inspection of study -related records by the Coordinating Center, 
sponsor, its designee, or health auth ority representatives at any time. 
 
5.7 Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
 
5.7.1 Role of the DSMB 
 
This study will be monitored by a DSMB. The primar y role of the DSMB w ill be to monitor the 
conduct of the study as it pertains to TRM based on the protoc ol statistical guidelines and 
stopping rules (Section 13.0). A secondary role will be to monitor protocol specific adverse 
events and all SAEs.  
 5.7.2 DSMB Membership 
The PBMTC will be providing DSMB oversight. 
 
5.7.3 Operations and respons ibilities of the DSMB 
The DSMB will meet after the fi rst 5 patients have reached day 100 after HCT. Future meetings 
will be held at 6-month intervals. At each mee ting the DSMB will review the data related to 
patient safety. The safety report to the DSMB will include a summary of all protocol-specific 
adverse events as defined in Section 5.9.1, a ll SAEs and all unanticipated problems.  
 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 33Based on the information available at each of these meetings, the DSMB is charged with 
deciding whether a) no action is required, b) the protocol shou ld be modified, c) further 
enrollment should be suspended pending additional review, or d) the protoc ol should be closed.  
The DSMB will keep minutes of its meetings and provide its findings in a letter to the 
Coordinating Center within 10 working days. An exception to this time requirement will occur if 
the DSMB recommends study termination, suspensi on of enrollment or a protocol modification 
that significantly affects patient safety. In thes e cases, the DSMB will be expected to provide 
their recommendations to the Protocol Chair/Prin cipal Investigator with in 24 hours. Copies of 
the letter will be also distributed to the local PI at the participating institutions. An ad hoc 
meeting or discussion with the DSMB will be arranged as deemed necessary by the protocol PIs. Each institution will forward the minutes to th eir IRB per local institutional practice.  
 
5.7.4 Reporting data to the DSMB 
 
The Coordinating Center will be responsible fo r providing the DSMB with a summary of acute 
GVHD and safety data sufficient to meet their responsibilities.  The participating centers are 
required to provide the Coordina ting Center with completed case report forms and SAE reports 
in a timely manner to meet th eir obligations to the DSMB.  
 
This is a DSMP Level I study under the SKCCC Da ta Safety Monitoring Plan (12/6/2012). The 
Clinical Research Office will perform an audit af ter the first subject has been treated and then 
periodically depending on the ra te of accrual and prior audit re sults. All trial monitoring and 
reporting will be reviewed annually by the SKCCC Safety Monitoring Committee.  The PI is 
responsible for internally monito ring the study. Data must be revi ewed to assure the validity of 
data, as well as, the safety of the subjects. Th e PI will also monitor the progress of the trial, 
review safety reports, and clinical trial effi cacy endpoints and to confirm that the safety 
outcomes favor continuation of the study. 
 
5.8 Adverse Event Reporting  
Allogeneic hematopoietic cell tr ansplantation (HCT) is an in trinsically complex procedure 
associated with a variety of previously well- described adverse events, most of which are non-
serious without long-term sequelae. Therefore, for this study, adverse events (AEs) requiring 
reporting will be limited to post transp lant Cy-related events, Serious AEs and 
Unanticipated Problems as defined in the sectio ns below.  Only Adverse Events in any way 
realted to Cy-infusion and not related to th e BMT will be captured on the Adverse Event 
Log.  Additionally, only clinically signific ant laboratory results considered in any way 
related to the Cy-infusion, and not at all related to the BMT are also to be captured on the 
Adverse Events Log.  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) must be individually assessed by the 
PI on the Adverse Event Log.  
 
5.8.1 Definition and Documentation of Adverse Event (AE) 
An adverse event is the development of an undesi rable medical condition or the deterioration of 
a pre-existing medical co ndition following or during treatmen t, whether or not considered 
causally related to the treatment. There are many expected toxicities of allogeneic BMT. The 
following are examples of toxicities that are serious but not unexpected : Grade 4 cytopenias; 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 34neutropenic fever and sepsis; bact erial, fungal, or viral (includi ng CMV, BK virus) infection; 
severe mucositis; pulmonary toxicities ; bleeding without hemodynamic compromise. 
 
Toxicities should be described according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Toxicity Criteria for Advers e Events (CTCAE), version 4.0, which can be accessed and 
downloaded via the website: http://ctep.cancer.gov/r eporting/ctc.html.  
 
As the primary research intervention in this study is the ad ministration of cyclophosphamide 
after transplantation, adverse event reporting will  focus on Cy related events. Patients will be 
assessed for the following events:  
 
 Failure to engraft neutrophils (>500/mc l) by day 60 after transplantation  
 Other unexpected grade 3-5 events (p er CTCAE, v. 4.0 possibly, probably, and 
definitely related to  the cyclophosphamide  
 Grades 3-4 aGVHD  
 Failure to detect donor chimerism >5%, as defined by the BMT-CTN and as per 
section 8.1.4 in whole blood at Day 60 
 Grade 3-5 infections (per CTCAE, v4.0)  
 Cardiac: (per CTCAE, v. 4.0)  
Clinical Heart Failure or Cardiomyopathy:  
Left Ventricular dysfunction: Grade 3- 5  
 Gastrointestinal: (per CTCAE, v. 4.0) 
Mucositis/stomatitis (clinical exam): Grade 3- 5 
 Hemorrhage/Bleeding; (per CTCAE, v. 4.0) Hemorrhage, GU, - Bladder, Grade 2 – 5 (and not relate d to infection) 
 
Attribution of the event to th e investigational product may be  characterized as follows:  
 definitely related, cl early associated with  study drug/treatment  
 probably related, likely associat ed with study drug/treatment  
 possibly related, may be associated w ith study drug or other treatment  
 unlikely to be related, or  
 definitely not related to  the study drug/treatment 
 For reporting purposes, an AE should be regarded as possibly, probably, or definitely related to 
the regimen if the investigator believes that at least one of following criteria are met:  
a) There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and the administration 
of the study drug or treatment;  b) There is a biologically plausible mechan ism for the study drug or treatment causing or 
contributing to the AE;  
c) The AE cannot be attributed solely to concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, or   
procedures 
 
In those cases where the NCI criteria do not apply, intensity will be defined as: 
• Mild: awareness of symptom or sign, but easily tolerated 
• Moderate: discomfort is enough to cause  interference with normal activities 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 35 • Severe: inability to perform normal daily activities 
• Life threatening: immedi ate risk of death from th e reaction as it occurred  
 
Adverse events will be documented on AE logs and submitted to the Coordinating Center on a 
monthly basis. Adverse events wi ll be collected through the time of  discharge from the transplant 
center, but no longer than 100 days after transplantation.  
 
5.8.2 Definition and reporting of Serious Adverse Event (SAE) A serious adverse event is an AE that fulfills one or more of the following criteria:  
 Results in death 
 Is immediately life-threatening 
 Requires or prolongs a hospital stay** 
Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect 
 Represents a significant medical cond ition which, without urgent medical 
intervention, would lead to one of the above outcomes.  
 
Life-threatening means that the AE represen ted an immediate threat of death without 
medical intervention.  
 
All events that meet the definition of an SA E in section 5.8.2, regardless of whether they 
are related or unrelated to the protocol inte rvention will be reported to the Coordinating 
Center. SAEs will be reported to the Coordinating Center through the time of discharge 
from the transplant center, but no longer than  100 days after tran splantation, with the 
exception of any deaths, which will be re ported throughout the duration of the study. 
SAE reports also must be submitted to the local IRB per the institutional requirements.  
 
**The following hospitalizations are NOT considered SAEs: 
 Admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure 
 Routine health assessment requiring ad mission for baseline/trending of health 
status (e.g., routine colonoscopy) 
 Medical/surgical admission for the purpos e other than remedying ill heath state 
and was planned prior to entry into the study [Documentation is required in these 
cases]. 
 Admissions encountered from another life circumstance that carries no bearing on 
health status and requires no medical/sur gical intervention (e.g. lack of housing, 
economic inadequacy, care-giver respite, family circumstances, administrative) 
 Admission directly related to the BMT but not to the PTCy 
 
5.8.3. Role of Protocol Chair/Principal I nvestigator in adverse event reporting 
The Protocol Chair/Principal Inve stigator is ultimately responsib le for the required reporting of 
all adverse events.  
 5.8.4 Role of Coordinating Center  in adverse event reporting  
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 36The Coordinating Center is the central loca tion for the collection and maintenance of 
documentation of adverse events and is responsible for submitting adverse event reports to the 
Protocol Chair promptly. The Coordinating Center will maintain documentation of all adverse events for each participating site. Adverse even t reports submitted to the Coordinating Center 
must be signed and dated by the participating site’s Principal Invest igator. The Coordinating 
Center will provide  appropriate forms to be used by all participating sites for reporting adverse 
events.  
 
Documentation of all SAEs must include: 
 •Subject ID number, and initials 
• Date of the event 
• Description of the event  
• Description of site's response to the event 
• Assessment of the subject's condition • Subject's status on the study ( on study, in follow-up, off study )  
• Attribution of ev ent to study drug  
 
5.8.5. Role of Participating Site s in adverse event reporting 
Participating sites are responsible for repor ting adverse events to  the local IRB,  
per local institutional requirements, and to  the Coordinating Center as follows:  
 
Fatal Events whether anticipated or unan ticipated, and whether or not related to the study must 
be reported to the Coordinating Center within 24 hours of the participating site Principal 
Investigator's learning of the event.  
 
Other Serious Adverse Events must be reported to the Coordi nating Center within 72 business 
hours of the participating site Principal I nvestigator’s learning  of the event.  
 
Serious Adverse Event reports are to be emailed ( crocc@jhmi.edu ) or faxed (410-502-9933) to 
the Coordinating Center . Follow-up reports are faxed, mailed, or sent electronically to the 
Coordinating Center as necessary.  
 
The investigator must also report follow-up information about SAEs within the same time frames. Investigators must follow patients with SAEs until the event has resolved or the condition has stabilized. If the pa tient is lost to follow-up with an ongoing SAE, this should be 
captured accordingly on a follow-up SAE report.  If a non-serious AE becomes serious, this and othe r relevant follow-up information must also be 
provided within the same time frames described above. 
 
All SAEs must be collected wh ether or not they are consid ered causally related to the 
investigational product.  Investigators and other site personne l also are responsible for reporting 
all casually related SAEs to their IRB and the Pr otocol Chair. Site PIs and other investigators 
must provide expedited reports of all SAEs to the protocol chair.  It is the responsibility of the protocol chair to determine whether the SAE is related to the study and wh ether it is unexpected 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 37by virtue of greater severity or higher freque ncy when evaluated in the context of prior 
expectations and experience in the study to date. 
 
5.9 GVHD 
 A major toxicity of allogeneic BMT from an  unrelated or mismatched donor is GVHD. Acute 
graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) shall be graded clinically accord ing to the criteria developed 
by the consensus conference on acute GVHD5 (Appendix 3). All suspected cases of acute GVHD 
should be confirmed  histologically by biopsy of an affected organ (skin, liv er, or gastrointestinal 
tract).  Diarrhea and/or hyperbilirubinemia in a pa tient with histologically documented skin 
GVHD may be assumed to be a manifestation of visceral GVHD and will be graded as such. All 
patients with histologically documented, clinic al grade >2 acute GVHD should receive initial 
treatment according to instituti onal preference. If skin GVHD resolves with treatment but 
suspected visceral GVHD does not, bi opsy of the affected organ (liver or gastrointestinal tract) 
should be obtained to rule out other causes of hyperbilirubinemia and/or diarrhea. Steroid refractory acute GVHD will be treated according to institutional prefer ences. In patients who 
develop GVHD, the GVHD assessment questionnaire must be completed at the time of onset, 
weekly until GVHD resolves, and at Day 60+/-7 da ys, regardless of whether or not the patient 
has GVHD. The following information shall be co llected on all patients with acute GVHD:   
      
 Date of onset (defined as the date of first biopsy confirming GVHD) 
 Initial overall clinical grade  
 Maximum overall clinical grade 
 Date of onset of grade III-IV acute GVHD, if any 
 
Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) shall be graded clini cally according to the criteria 
developed by the NIH consensus conference on chronic GVHD
48 (Appendix 4). All suspected 
cases of chronic GVHD should be confirmed  histologically by biops y of an affected organ 
whenever possible. Mild chronic GVHD involves only 1 or 2 organs or sites (except the lung), 
with no clinically significant functional impairment  (maximum of score 1 in all affected organs 
or sites). Moderate chronic GVHD i nvolves (1) at least 1 organ or site with clinical ly significant 
but no major disability (maximum score of 2 in any affected orga n or site) or (2) 3 or more 
organs or sites with no clini cally significant functional impairme nt (maximum score of 1 in all 
affected organs or sites). A lung score of 1 will also be co nsidered moderate chronic GVHD. 
Severe chronic GVHD indicates ma jor disability caused by chronic GVHD (score of 3 in any 
organ or site). A lung score of 2 or greater will also be consider ed severe chronic GVHD. 
 The following information shall be collected on all patients with chronic GVHD:  
 Date of onset (defined as th e date of first biopsy confir ming GVHD, if possible or the 
first day of onset of clinical sy mptoms if no biopsy is performed) 
 Initial overall clinical score 
 Maximum overall clinical score 
 5.10  Non-relapse mortality (NRM)  
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 38Causes of NRM, i.e., death in the absence of relapse or disease progressi on, will be documented 
as important indicators of procedure-associated  toxicity, particularly as these causes relate 
directly or indirectly to GVHD. Analysis will stratify mortality with respect to the peri-transplant 
period (<100 d post-BMT) or  later times post-BMT. 
 
5.11 Protocol Deviations 
 When an emergency occurs that requires a devi ation from the protocol for patient safety, a 
decision will be made as soon as  possible to determine whether or  not the subject (for whom the 
deviation from protocol was effected) is to continue in the study. The subject ’s medical records 
will completely describe the deviation from the pr otocol and state the reasons for such deviation. 
In addition, the Investigat or will notify their local IRB as requ ired in writing of the deviation 
from protocol. The Transplant Center Local Princi pal Investigator is resp onsible for notifying the 
Protocol Coordinator as soon as possible of the deviation. Major deviations in this protocol 
consist of modifications of the pr eparative regimen or a last minut e change of stem cell source or 
significant delay in stem  cell source infusion.  
Non-emergency minor deviations from the protocol will be permitted with approval of the Protocol Coordinator. Modifi cations of GVHD prophylaxis/imm une suppression necessary for 
good patient care are not consid ered protocol  deviations.

 7.0 RISKS AND TOXICITIES 
 
7.1  Busulfan (Bu) 
Busulfan Toxicities: a)  Nausea and vomiting - this occurs in some patients. It is usually mild but antiemetics 
may be required. 
b)  Hematologic - the doses of busulfan ar e expected to produce marrow ablation from 
which the patient would not be expect ed to recover without marrow rescue. 
c)  Pulmonary complications - diffuse interstitial pneumonitis with fibrosis has been 
reported as a complication of busulfan thera py when the drug is given in small doses 
over long periods of time. Changes in pul monary function tests may occur following 
bone marrow transplantation. To date, no sp ecific pulmonary complications have 
been attributed to busulfan as used in the transplant setting at this institution. 
d)  Seizures - preliminary studies suggest that  significant levels of Busulfan are attained 
in the cerebrospinal fluid. In the past a bout 10% of our patients have experienced 
grand mal seizures during Busu lfan administration. This toxi city is avoi ded by the use 
of keppra as outlined in the treatment plan. 
e)  Other toxic effects which may be produ ced by Busulfan include erythematous skin 
rash, hyperpigmentation, hepatic dysfunc tion, amenorrhea, testicular atrophy, 
gynecomastia, myasthenia symptoms, cataract and atrophic bronchitis associated with 
 cytologic dysplasia. 
   7.2  Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) 
Cyclophosphamide is an alkylating agent w hose metabolites form cross-links with 
DNA resulting in cell cycle-nonspecific inhi bition of DNA synthe sis and function. 
Commercial supply of cyclophosphamide will be used. 
Cyclophosphamide Toxicities: a)  Hematologic: Leukopenia, anemia b)  Dermatologic: Alopecia c)  Gastrointestinal: Naus ea, vomiting, increased AST, ALT, mucositis, diarrhea 
d)  Neurologic: H eadache, dizziness 
e)  Cardiovascular: Cardiac necrosis rarely with high dose cyclophosphamide f)  Renal: Hemorrhagic cystitis, SIADH g)  Other: teratogenic, may cause s econdary neoplasms, anaphylaxis (rare) 
h)  Fluid retention. Cy has anti-diuretic effect usually counteracted by furosemide  
administration. Careful physical examinati on should be made and accurate weights 
should be determined to de tect fluid overload early. 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 44i)  Cardiomyopathy. At doses greater than 200mg/kg, Cy can cause fatal myocardial 
necrosis with clinical heart failure. N on-specific ST changes on EKG are not unusual 
but a decrease in volta ge is significant. 
j)  Hemorrhagic cystitis. Hematuria is not uncommon at this dose le vel, but is usually 
not symptomatic or severe unless there is inadequate diuresis. An occasional patient 
will get severe cystitis de spite prophylactic measures. 
  7.3 TBI 
Early side effects (< 1 month): Most patients experience some degree of nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhea either dur ing or immediately after treatment. Fever that develops 
soon after TBI is not uncommon. Other side e ffects include skin erythema, parotid gland 
swelling, diminished salivary gland functi on, stomatitis, mouth ulcers, sore throat, 
generalized weakness and fatigue and alope cia. Myelosuppression  occurs promptly 
following TBI and doses of 1000cGy or more are assumed to cause permanent bone marrow aplasia and would be  lethal without BMT. 
Intermediate side effects (1-4 months): In terstitial pneumonia can be seen with a fatal 
incidence of up to 5-10%. Other side effect s may include graft versus host disease and 
infection from prolonged immunoincompetence.  
Late effects (>4months): An increased risk of sterility and cataracts is known; the risk of 
developing a second malignancy may be incr eased. Additional complications for long 
term survivors may include cardiac, pulmona ry, liver, and kidney damage as well as 
hearing loss. Changes in horm one levels may also occur. 
 7.4  Mesna (sodium-2-mercapto ethane sulphonate)   
Mesna is a prophylactic agent used to prev ent hemorrhagic cystitis induced by the 
oxasophosphorines (cyclophosphamide and ifosphamide ). It has no intrinsic cytotoxicity and no 
antagonistic effects on chemotherapy. Mesna bi nds with acrolein, the urotoxic metabolite 
produced by the oxasophosphorines, to produce a non-toxic thioether and slows the rate of 
acrolein formation by combining with 4- hydroxy metabolites of oxasophosphorines.  
 The total daily dose of mesna is equal to at least 80% of the total daily dose of cyclophosphamide. At the doses used for uroprotection, mesna is virtually non-toxic. However, potential adverse effects include nausea and vom iting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, altered taste, 
rash, urticaria, headache, joint or limb pain, hypotension, and fatigue. 
 7.5  Tacrolimus (FK-506, Prograf ®) 
Tacrolimus is a macrolide immunosuppressant that inhibits lymphocytes through calcineurin 
inhibition.   Toxicities: There is a spectrum of well-described  toxicities of tacrol imus. Toxicities include 
renal insufficiency, hypertension, hyperglyce mia, hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, nausea, 
diarrhea, headache, neurologic toxicity includi ng tremor and leukoencepha lopathy, infection, and 
rarely thrombotic throm bocytopenic purpura (TTP).  
 Drug interactions: Tacrol imus is well absorbed orally. Tacrolimus is extensively metabolized by 
the cytochrome P-450 (CYP 3A4) system and metabolized produc ts are excreted in the urine. 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 45Drugs that may increase tacrolimus levels incl ude tri-azole drugs (esp ecially voriconazole and 
posaconazole), nephrotoxic drugs, calcium ch annel blockers, cimetidine and omeprazole, 
metoclopramide, macrolide antib iotics, quinupristin/dal fopristin, danazol, ethinyl estradiol, 
methylprednisolone, and HIV prot ease inhibitors. Drugs that ma y decrease tacrolimus levels 
include some anticonvulsants (phenobarb ital, phenytoin, carbamezepine), caspofungin, 
rifamycins, and St. John’s Wort.  
 Dose adjustments: The tacrolimus dose is ad justed to maintain a serum trough level of 5-15 
ng/mL. Patients with hepatic or renal insuffici ency should receive doses  at the lower end of 
therapeutic concentrations. No dose adjust ments are required in patients undergoing 
hemodialysis.  
 
Due to extreme interactions with voriconaz ole and posaconazole, the tacrolimus dose 
should be empirically lowered when these azol es are initiated at steady state levels of 
tacrolimus. Guidelines are provided in the table below. Dose adjustments for therapy with other 
azoles may be indicated. However, the initial tacrolimus dose (on Day 5) remains fixed.   Dosing considerations with concurrent azole therapy: Triazole antifungal medications are expected to increase serum CNI levels; ther efore dosages of CNI’s should be adjusted 
accordingly. Guidelines are provided in the tabl e below. Of note, reversal of azole-mediated 
inhibition of CYP3A4 (and others) and P-glycop rotein is gradual when azoles are stopped. 
Therefore, immediate significant dose increases in  tacrolimus are not ad vised when azoles are 
stopped. Rather, tacrolimus dose increases should  be cautious and based on more frequent 
monitoring of levels as appropriate.

MMF is an ester prodrug of the active im munosuppressant mycophenolic acid (MPA).  
Side effects include: pancytopeni a, infection (including sepsis, CMV, HSV, VZV, and Candida), 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, allergic reactions, hypertension, headache, dizziness, insomnia, 
hyperglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, rash, and leg cramps/bone pain.  
 Drug interactions: MMF activity is decreased with  oral antacids and cholestyramine. There are 
no pharmacokinetic interactions with cotrimoxazo le, oral contraceptives, or cyclosporine. 
Acyclovir or ganciclovir blood levels may incr ease due to competition for tubular secretion. 
High doses of salicylates or ot her highly protein-bound drugs may increase the free fraction of 
MPA and exaggerate the poten tial for myelosuppression.  
 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 46Dose adjustments: No dose adjustments are required for liver dysfunction. For renal 
insufficiency, MMF dosing should not be modified  unless dialysis is needed, in which case 
MMF can be reduced to 25-50% of the starting dose. 
 
8.0 STUDY PARAMETERS  
8.1  Hematologic parameters  
 
8.11 Neutrophil recovery : The cumulative incidence of neutr ophil engraftment from the time of 
transplant will be estimated using the cumulative incidence function with death and relapse prior 
to engraftment as the competing risk. The definition of neutrophil engraftment is a post-nadir ANC > 500/mm3 for three consecutive measurements  on different days. The first of the three 
days will be designated as the day of neutrophil recovery.  
 
8.12 Platelet recovery : The cumulative incidence of platel et engraftment from the time of 
transplant will be estimated using the cumulative incidence function with death and relapse prior 
to engraftment as the competing ri sk.  The definition of platelet e ngraftment is sustained platelet 
count > 20,000/mm
3 and > 50,000/mm3 with no platelet transfusions in the preceding seven days. 
The first of three consecutive measurements on different days will be designated as the day of initial platelet recovery.  
 
8.13 Donor chimerism : Mixed donor chimerism is defined as > 5%, but < 95%, donor. Full 
donor chimerism is defined as > 95% donor. Prior to transplantation, a sample of peripheral 
blood from the patient, and either harvested bone marrow or blood from the donor, are collected 
for genetic studies to establish a base line for subsequent chimerism assays.  
 It is recommended (not re quired) that chimerism determinations from T cells (CD3+ sorted) and 
whole blood (total nucleated ce lls) will be made from peripheral blood per Section 6.2, and more 
frequently as indicated. Methods  may include (i) PCR analysis of variable number of tandem 
repeats (VNTR) in PBMC if informative, (ii) restriction fragment le ngth polymorphism (RFLP) 
if the donor and recipient RFLPs are informative,  (iii) fluorescence in-sit u hybridization (FISH) 
for Y-chromosome markers on PBMC if the donor is male and patient is female, (iv) cytogenetic 
analysis, (v) flow cytometric analysis of HLA- A, B or DR on lymphocytes in the peripheral 
blood if haploidentical and suitable reagents exist, (v) other in stitutional standards. Chimerism 
should also be determined from the bone marrow at required timepoints.  
 
8.14 Graft failure : < 5% donor chimerism in blood and/or bone marrow by ~Day 60 and on all 
subsequent measurements. This time point was chosen based on the median and range of donor 
engraftment seen on the Hopkins and other single institutional published studies of 
myeloablative haploBMT with PT/Cy. 
 Primary graft failure: < 5% donor chimerism in blood and/or bone marrow by ~ Day 60  
 Secondary graft failure: achievement of > 5%  donor chimerism, followed by sustained <5% 
donor chimerism in blood and/or bone marrow.   
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 47< 5% donor T cell chimerism, but with > 5 % donor chimerism in to tal leukocytes, is not 
considered graft failure. 
 Patients who have relapsed or died prior to day 60 will not be evaluable for full donor 
chimerism, as these are competing risk factors. 
 
8.2 Graft-versus-host Disease  
 
8.21 Acute GVHD : The cumulative incidence of acute GVHD Grades 2-4 and 3-4 will be 
assessed according to the BMT-CTN Manual of Procedures (MOP): 
https://web.emmes.com/study/bmt2/ public/MOP/BMTCTNTechnicalMOPv3.pdf . Standard 
assessment criteria is also listed in Appendix 4.( Appendix 4). It is str ongly recommended, when 
possible (not required), that biopsies be taken for histologic al confirmation of GVHD of an 
affected organ (e.g., skin, liver, or gastrointestinal tract). Date of symptom onset, date of biopsy 
confirmation of GVHD, maximum clin ical grade, sites affected, a nd dates and types of treatment 
will be recorded. Dates of symptom onset of  grade II or higher GVHD and grade III-IV GVHD 
will be recorded.   The cumulative incidences of acute grade II-IV and grade III-IV GVHD will be determined through competing risk analysis. Relapse/progress ion, graft failure, or death without aGVHD are 
considered competing risks for aGVHD. . In addition, aGVHD will be re ported with only graft 
failure and death regarded as competing risks.   Recommended primary systemic treatment for acute GVHD will be corticosteroids. However, 
initiation of calcineurin inhibitors or other systemic immunosuppressant s will be per discretion 
of the treating physician. All effo rts should be made to record the systemic immunosuppressants 
used, timing of their administration and duration of treatment administered beyond the originally 
planned prophylaxis regimen We will characterize the duration, number, and type of steroid and 
non-steroid immunosuppressants used to treat aGVHD.  
 
8.22 Chronic GVHD: The cumulative incidence and severity of   chronic GVHD will be 
assessed according to the BMT-CTN Manual of Procedures (MOP): 
https://web.emmes.com/study/bmt2/ public/MOP/BMTCTNTechnicalMOPv3.pdf  using the  NIH 
consensus criteria.51 Date of onset, date of biopsy confirmation (if any), dates and types of 
treatment, and extent will be recorded. The cumulative incidence of chronic GVHD (overall and 
according to extent) will be determined through competing risk analysis.  Relapse/progression, 
graft failure, or death without cGVHD are considered competing risks for cGVHD. The 
cumulative incidence of cGVHD will be describe d at 6 months and 1 year post transplant. 
 
Use of systemic immunosuppressive therapy for treatment of chronic GVHD is at the discretion 
of the treating physicians. The event of interest is the development of any chronic GVHD severe enough to warrant systemic therapy, which includes corticosteroids (prednisone dose ≥0.5mg/kg/day or equivalent), any systemic immunosuppressive agen t or extracorporeal 
photopheresis. Use of topical immunosuppressive ag ents is not necessary for triggering this 
endpoint. Patients who continue on immunos uppressive therapy beyond day 180 due to 
manifestation of chronic GVHD will also be considered an event for the primary endpoint. 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 48 
We will characterize the duration, number , and type of steroid and non-steroid 
immunosuppressants used to treat cGVHD.  
 
8.3 Disease and survival endpoints  
 
8.3.1 Progression-free surviva l: Interval from Day 0 to date of  first objective disease progression 
or relapse, death from any cause, or last patient evaluation. Patie nts who have not progressed or 
died will be censored at the last date they were assessed and deemed free of relapse or 
progression. Disease persistence in the absence of progression is not included in this analysis.  
 
8.3.2 Event-free survival: Interval from Day 0 to date of first objective disease progression or 
relapse, an unplanned therapeutic  maneuver for disease persistence,  death from any cause, or last 
patient evaluation. Patients without events will be censored at th e last date they were assessed 
and deemed event-free. EFS will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and EFS at one 
and two years after transplantation will be es timated along with 90% confidence intervals. 
 
8.3.3  Disease-Free Survival (DFS): Di sease free survival is the time from date of transplant to 
death or relapse/progression, whichever comes first.  The event for this endpoint is 
relapse/progression or death.  Patients alive and disease free will be censored at last follow-up 
 
8.3.4 Overall survival: Interval fr om Day 0 to date of death fr om any cause or last patient 
contact. Overall Survival (OS) will be estimated  using the Kaplan-Meier method.  OS at one and 
two years after transplantation will be esti mated along with 90% confidence intervals. 
 
8.3.5  GVHD/relapse or progression-free survival  (GRFS): An event for this time to event 
outcome is defined as grade III-IV ac ute GVHD, chronic GVHD requiring systemic 
immunosuppressive treatment, disease relapse or progression, or death by  any cause.  Patients 
will be followed up for at least one year for this endpoint. 
 
8.3.6 Nonrelapse mortality: The cumulative incidence of death without evidence of disease 
progression or relapse will be characterized at  days 100, 180, and 1 year post-transplant.  An 
event for this endpoint is death without ev idence of disease progression or recurrence 
Relapse/progression is a competing risk for NRM.  
 
8.3.7 Relapse or progression: Relaps e is defined by either morphologi cal or cytogenetic evidence 
of acute leukemia or MDS consistent with pret ransplant features. High clinical suspicion of 
relapse will most likely lead to a disease-specific evaluation, fo r example a bone marrow aspirate 
for patients with leukemia or myelodysplasia. Cytogenetic studies or decreasing donor 
chimerism also increase the suspicion of relapse as well and can sometimes detect asymptomatic 
relapse in routine protocol-related marrow samples.  If there is evidence of early relapse and no 
evidence of GVHD following BMT, immunosuppressi ve therapy may be discontinued earlier 
than indicated in Section 4.6, after discussion with  PI. If there is evidence of donor chimerism 
and no evidence of GVHD, patients may be eligib le for subsequent donor lymphocyte infusions. 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 49 
Acute leukemia and MDS  – Relapse will be diagnosed when there is: 
- Reappearance of leukemia blast cel ls in the peripheral blood; or, 
- >5% blasts in the bone marrow, not attrib utable to another cause (e.g. bone marrow 
regeneration) 
- The appearance of previous or new dysplasti c changes (MDS specific) within the bone 
marrow with or without falling donor chimerism; or  
- The development of extramedullary leukemia or leukemic cells in the cerebral spinal fluid or 
- The reappearance of cytogenetic abnorma lities present prior to transplantation 
 Designation of disease status in other histologie s will also follow standa rd criteria. NRM is a 
competing risk for relapse/progression.   Institution of any therapy to treat persistent, progressive or relapsed disease, including the withdrawal of immunosuppressive  therapy or donor lymphocyte infusion, will be considered 
evidence of relapse/progression regardless of whether the criteria  described above were met. 
 8.3.8 Minimal residual disease (MRD) : MRD is defined by the sole evidence of malignant cells 
by flow cytometry, FISH, PCR or other techniques,  in absence of morphological or cytogenetic 
evidence of disease in blood or marrow. Since th e frequency and sensitiv ity of testing for MRD 
are variable, evidence of MRD will not be sufficient to meet the definition of relapse or progression in this study, but will be captured in the case report forms along with data on 
changing management in re sponse to MRD detection.  
 8.3.9 Primary cause of death. Primary cause of  death will be clas sified as follows: 
- Relapse/Primary disease:  If the patient relapsed/progres sed after day 0 prior to death, 
the primary cause of death is relapse/progres sion, even if they subsequently developed 
GVHD, organ toxicities or infections that may have c ontributed to subsequent death.  
- GVHD:  Death from acute or chronic GVHD, in  the absence of relapse or AML/MDS 
disease progression.  
- Infection:  Death from documented viral, bacterial or fungal infections in the absence of 
GVHD or relapse/disease progression. 
- Organ toxicity:  Death from major organ toxicities not attributable to AML/MDS, 
infection or GVHD. 
- Other: Any other causes of death than those listed above. 
   
9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 
 
Overall Study Design 
 
This study is a single-arm Phase II trial with th e primary objective bei ng to assess nonrelapse 
mortality at 180 days (NRM 180) of a myeloablative preparative regimen and post transplantation 
cyclophosphamide with a partially HLA-mismat ched donor in patients with hematologic 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 50malignancies who have not had a bone ma rrow transplant before (cohort 1). NRM 180 is defined 
from transplant date to date of death without evidence of disease progression or relapse at 180 
days. Patients who relapse or progress will be counted as compe ting risks events.  Patients with 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia will receive a Cy/T BI preparative regimen. All other patients will 
receive a busulfan/cytoxan preparative regimen.  In the Johns Hopkins Hospital Phase 2 single 
institutional study (n=85), there wa s no difference in transplant to xicities includi ng engraftment, 
NRM, or GVHD in patients treated with Cy/TBI versus Bu/Cy therefore all patients will be 
analyzed together.  
 We will enroll a second cohort of patients who ha ve relapsed after bone marrow transplant and 
will be receiving this regimen as their second or  greater transplant.  Given these patients are 
expected to have a significantly higher NRM based on reports in the li terature, their NRM will 
be descriptive only.    
 
9.1 Accrual 
 
We plan to accrue 31 patients over approximately one-two years in cohort 1.  Cohort 2 (descriptive only) expects to accrue 5-7 patients. Subjects will be followed for the primary endpoint of NRM
180, which will be described at 180 days.  
 
9.2 Sample Size Considerations 
Cohort 1 will accrue all eligible patients who ar e receiving their first bone marrow transplant.  
Previous literature using haploidentical bone marrow transplant without post-transplant Cy 
suggests that NRM 180 is 35% or higher in this patient popu lation. Literature using post-transplant 
Cy in the myeloablative setting suggests a NRM of 6-20%. At our in stitution, NRM is around 
13%.  In this mu lticenter study, we are interest ed in showing that NRM 180 will be no higher than 
17%. NRM will be estimated through a cumulativ e incidence function, but for sample size 
considerations we performed a calculation using an exact binomi al test to determine what 
difference we could detect with our projected sample size.  A sample size of 28 patients who 
meet the inclusion criteria of cohort 1 and a one-s ided type 1 error rate of 10%, would yield 80% 
power to test if NRM is significantly improved fr om 35% (historical rate s of TRM in haploBMT 
without PT/Cy as in background se ction) to 17%, based on an exact binomial test.  Because we 
expect approximately 10% of patients to expe rience a competing event (relapse), and these 
patients will not contribute in the risk set of NRM, thus we are in flating the sample size to 31.   
 Due to the small number of patients expected to enroll on this protocol who have already relapsed after their firs t BMT, we are not providing formal  sample size estimates for cohort 2. 
We anticipate enrolling 5-7 patients who meet th e inclusion criteria of cohort 2, and will examine 
their outcomes in an exploratory manner. As de scribed in the background section, NRM for these 
patients has been 25-75%. We woul d like to see if this regimen seems feasible for those in need 
of a second BMT such that it would be e xplored further on a fu ture clinical trial 
 
9.3 Analysis of Primary Endpoint 
Cumulative incidence of NRM will be estimated using Gray’s method 
50 with disease relapse or 
progression considered as competing events.  The cumulative incidence of NRM for cohort 2 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 51will be estimated using the same approach, though we expect the confidence intervals to be fairly 
wide. Cumulative incidence of NRM at 100 days, 180 days and one year will be calculated and 
reported with 90% confidence intervals for each cohort.  
9.4 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
Secondary endpoints such as donor engraftment, platelet and neutroph il engraftment, aGVHD, 
cGVHD, survival endpoints, and relapse will be analyzed, as per section 8.1. 
9.4.1 Additional hematologic and non-hematologic t oxicities: These will be recorded using 
NCI’s Common Terminology Criteria for A dverse Events (CTCAE) Version 4.0 at 
regular intervals as defined in the patient monitoring section (sect ion 5.0). Toxicities will 
be tabulated by type and appropriate confidence inte rvals will be estimated. 
9.4.2  Statistical Methodology:  When appr opriate, we will apply Gray’s method
50 to examine 
differences in cumulative incidence functions with  respect to the two co horts of patients (BMT 
#1 vs. BMT >1) and also by regimen within cohort 1. The differences in overall survival and 
event-free survival will be explored as well us ing standard methods.  Thus, we will report the 
cumulative incidence of NRM at 100 days, 180 days and one year with respect to patients based 
on received regimens. In addition, we will compare these groups with respect to overall survival and event free survival in an explor atory manner using standard methods. 
 
9.5  Stopping Rules 
 
Because patients with severe GVHD and engraftment failures who die will be captured in NRM, we will apply a stopping rule based on incidence of NRM.  As outlined in Section 2.0 (Background), the overall NRM on the mini-h aplo BMT BMT-CTN trial was 7%. Our 
institutional experience with my eloablative haploBMT has shown an overall NRM of 15% and a 
pediatric NRM of 6%. Other groups using PT/C y after myeloablative haploBMT have shown 
NRM’s in the range of 10-15%. Other hapl oidentical BMT trials without PT/Cy, both 
nonmyeloablative and ablative ha ve shown NRM in the range of 30-40%, mostly from infectious 
causes. The working hypothesis of this trial is that the overall  toxicity of fully ablative 
haploBMT in a national, multicenter trial is not  significantly greater than the single institution 
experience with haploidentical BMT afte r myeloablative conditioning utilizing post-
transplantation Cy, and less then what has been seen with other nonmyeloablative and ablative 
haploidentical BMT trials that do not utilize post-transplantation Cy. NRM will capture patients that have transplant related mortality includ ing, but not limited to death from severe GVHD or 
engraftment failure.  Both cohorts will be monitored separately  based on the observed NRM rate by day 100 
(NRM
100). Within cohort 1, because we do not know how many patients will be accrued to each 
regimen at any one time and the NRM rate will be expected to be similar, we will separately 
monitor the NRM results of patie nts treated with Cy/TBI vers us Bu/Cy but with the same 
stopping rule. We will monitor for NRM 100 after every 2 patients enrolled at each treated 
regimen in cohort 1, and every patient in  cohort 2. The stopping rule for NRM 100 will hold 
enrollment if the posterior probability of NRM 100 exceeding 25% within treated regimen in 
cohort 1 or 50% in cohort 2 is 0.75 or higher. The pr ior for this monitoring rule is a beta(1,3) for 
each regimen in cohort 1, and a beta(3,3) for cohort 2. This means that our prior guess at the proportion of NRM
100 is 25% for each regimen in cohort 1 and 50% for cohort 2, and there is a 
J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 5290% probability that these proportions are between 1.7-63.2% for each regimen in cohort 1 and 
18.9-81.1% for cohort 2. In cohort 1,  if both regimens trigger a re view, then consideration would 
be given to stopping the trial; othe rwise if only one regimen triggers a review, then accrual to 
this regimen will be temporarily halted and cons ideration will be given to  trial modification. We 
expect approximately 1/3 of patients to be treat ed with Cy/TBI and the remaining 2/3 to be 
treated with Bu/Cy, but we have included stopping rules up to the full sample size for 
completeness in Table 1 for the stopping rules. Table 2 shows the operatin g characteristics based 
5000 simulations. The probability of stopping in cohort 1 was estimated from the simulation 
results in two regimens, assuming the independent NRM 100 event between two regimens, the 
same true toxicity rate in two regimens’ groups, and under 10 and 21 patients in Cy/TBI amd Bu/Cy, respectively.         Table 1. Stopping rules for NRM

  10.0 INFORMED CONSENT/ASSENT  
Patients eligible for marrow grafting are comp letely evaluated and presented at group 
conference. The group's recommendations are disc ussed with the patient. If the patient is 
approved for BMT, the marrow processing procedure itself, the risks of the preparative regimen, 
risks of BMT complications including infection and GVHD and alternate forms of therapy are 
presented as objectively as possible. For pediatric pa tients (<18 yr of age) assent is obtained from 
the patient and informed consent is obtained from all parents. Informed consent is obtained from 
the recipient using the forms approved by the JCCI IRB. 
 The requirement and process for assent will be  at the discretion of the IRB at each site. 
 10.1  On-study date : 
Date of consent signing. 
  10.2  Off-study date: 
Upon completion of “Day 365” evaluations, patients have completed their treatment 
except for patient follow-up beyond day 365 which will consist of co llecting information 
regarding ongoing engraftment, disease status, late effects of this  protocol, acute and 
chronic graft vs.- host disease, immune recons titution, additional therapies, and survival 
as per standard BMT long-term follow-up. Patients will go off study early in the event of: 1.  Death 2.  Disease progression and/or graft failure prior to day 100. In the event that a patient 
comes off study prior to day 60-100 due to disease progression, efforts will be made to obtain blood and bone marrow at the time of study discontinuation to assess 
chimerism, and to assess for the presence  of GVHD. We will continue to update 
survival information on these patients. 
3.  Patient decision (or decision by a parent or guardian on behalf of a minor) 4.  Unacceptable toxicity associated with prot ocol therapy, as determined by the treating 
physicians in consultation with the investigators.

J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 59 
Organ scoring of chronic GVHD. *AP may be elevated in growing children, and not reflective of liver dysfunction. 
†Pulmonary scoring should be performed using both the symptom and pulmonary function testing (PFT) scale whenever possible. When discrepancy exists between pulmona ry symptom or PFT scores the higher value should be 
used for final scoring. Scoring using the Lung Function Score (LFS) is preferred, but if DLCO is not available, grading using FEV1 should be used. The LFS is a global assessment of lung function after the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans has already been established [29] . The percent predicted FEV1 and DLCO (adjusted for 
hematocrit but not alveolar volume) should be converted to a numeric score as follows: >80% = 1; 70-79% = 2; 60-69% = 3; 50-59% = 4; 40-49% = 5; <40% = 6. The LFS = FEV1 score + DLCO score, with a possible range of 2-12. 

J13161 Protocol Version 5.1         April 20, 2017 
 60GVHD indicates graft versus host disease; ECOG, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group; KPS, Karnofsky 
Performance Status; LPS, Lansky Performance Status; BS A, body surface area; ADL, activities of daily living; 
LFTs, liver function tests; AP, al kaline phosphatase; ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate 
aminotransferase; ULN, upper limit of normal. Mild chronic GVHD involves only 1 or 2 organs or sites (e xcept the lung: see below), with no clinically significant 
functional impairment (maximum of score 1 in all affected organs or sites). Moderate chronic GVHD involves (1) at least 1 organ or site with clinically significant but no major disability (maximum score of 2 in any affected organ or site) or (2) 3 or more organs or sites with no clinically  significant functional impairment (maximum score of 1 in all 
affected organs or sites). A lung sc ore of 1 will also be considered mode rate chronic GVHD. Severe chronic GVHD 
indicates major disability caused by chronic GVHD (score of 3 in any organ or site). A lung score of 2 or greater will also be considered severe chronic GVHD.

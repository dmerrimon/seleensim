1.1 Primary  Objective 
1.1.1. To evaluate the survival for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with first -line treatment with 
FOLFOX -A as compared to historical controls of gemcitabine alone. 
1.2 Secondary  Objectives 
1.2.1 To assess the toxicities associated with FOLFOX -A for metastatic pancreatic cancer  
1.2.2 To evaluate the response of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer who receive the FOLFOX -A 
regimen  
 
2.0  BACKGROUND 
Advanced pancreatic cancer:   
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth -leading cause of cancer- related death in the United States.1 Single agent 
gemcitabine has been the most commonly utilized treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer improving 
survival and quality of life as compared to single agent fluorouracil.2  The median survival for patients  
with  metastatic pancreatic cancer t reated with gemcitabine is approximately 6 .5 months. 3-5  
FOLFIRINOX:   The PRODIGE 4/ACCOR D 11 trial compared FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, leucovorin, 
irinotecan and fluorouracil) to gemcitabine for first- line treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer. The 
trial enrolled 342 patients between 01/2005 and 10/2009. The median overall survival was 11.1 months in 
the FOLFIRINOX group as compared with 6.8 months in the gemcitabine group (P<0.001).6 Median 
progression-free survival was 6.4 months in the FOLFIRINOX group and 3.3 months in the gemcitabine group. The objective response rate was 31.6% in the FOLFIRINOX group versus 9.4% in the gemcitabine group. FOLFIRINOX has significant toxicity. Grade 3/4 toxicities increased with FOLFIRINOX 
including neutropenia (18.7%  versus 45.7%), febrile neutropenia (0.6% versus 5.4%), diarrhea (1.2% 
versus 12.7%) and neuropathy (0% to 9%), respectively.  
Irinotecan is not an effective agent in pancreatic cancer:  The contribution of irinotecan in 
FOLFIRINOX is unclear. Single agent irinotecan is without significant activity in pancreatic cancer.7 
Furthermore, the combination of irinotecan and gemcitabine does not improve survival as compared to 
gemcitabine alone.8 However, the inclusion of irinotecan adds substantially to the toxicit y of 
FOLFIRINOX.  
Abraxane® : Abraxane ®  is a biologically interactive albumin -bound paclitaxel combining a protein 
with a chemotherapeutic agent in the particle form. This composition provides a novel approach of increasing intra -tumoral concentrations of the drug by a receptor-mediated transport process allowing 
transcytosis across the endothelial cell. This albumin -specific receptor mediated process involves the 
binding of albumin to a specific receptor (gp60) on the intralumminal endothelial cell membrane, resulting in activation of a protein (caveolin -1), which initiates an internalization process in the 
endothelial cell through the formation of caveolae, with transport of the intact albumin-bound chemotherapeutic complex via these caveolae to the underlying tumor interstitium.
9 A protein specifically 
secreted by the tumor (SPARC) binds albumin, allowing release of the hydrophobic drug to the tumor cell membrane.
10 Abraxane ®  is the first biologically interactive nanoparticle product leveraging this gp -

toxic effects in normal tissue.10 Pancreatic cancer cells and surrounding s troma are known to overexpress 
SPARC (secreted protein acid rich in cysteine), which is associated with poor clinical outcomes.11 The 
albumin-bound nanoparticle form of paclitaxel increases tumor accumulation of paclitaxel through 
binding of albumin to SPA RC.11,12  
Abraxane ®  + Gemcitabine in pancreatic cancer:   The regimen of Abraxane ® , 125mg/m2, and 
gemcitabine, 1gm/m2, weekly x 3 weeks in 28 day cycles, was developed by Von Hoff et al in a phase I/II 
study for patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer.11,12 A phase III study of 861 patients demonstrated 
that the combination of Abraxane ®  and gemcitabine was superior to gemcitabine alone. As shown in the 
table 1 below, overall survival (OS), progression -free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure ( TTF), and 
response rate (RR) were significantly improved in the Abraxane ®  + gemcitabine arm.13

Phase I Study of FOLFOX -Abraxane ® (FOLFOX -A): Irinotecan is responsible for much of the toxicity 
of FOLFIRINOX but may not contribute significantly to the regimen’s activity. The addition of irinotecan to gemcitabine was not superior to gemcitabine alone. In contrast, the addition of Abraxane ®  to 
gemcitabine increased survival. Therefore, the Brown University Oncology Research Group initiated a protocol to remove irinotecan from FOLFIRINOX and substitute Abraxane ®  in patients with metastatic 
pancreatic cancer – this new regimen is called FOLFOX -A. All patients receive d oxaliplatin, 85 mg/m
2, 
leucovorin 400 mg/m2 and 5- FU 2400 mg/m2 IVI over 46 hours with Abraxane ® . Cycles we re repeated 
every 14 days. Three d ose-levels of Abraxane ®  were  evaluated:  
• Level 1: Abraxane ®  125mg/m2

• Level 3: Abraxane ®  175 mg/m2  
All patients received 1 gram of magnesium sulfate and 1 gram of calcium gluconate before and after 
oxaliplatin. Neulasta wa s required with the fi rst 2 cycles of FOLFOX -A then became optional. The 
protocol received an IND exemption and is listed via clinicaltrials.gov [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]. 
All 3 dose- levels have been evaluated and the maximum tolerated dose has been determined  in patients 
with metastatic pancreatic cancer .  One of six patients at dose -level 1 had grade 3 nausea. At dose-level 2, 
one of six patients had urosepsis with an absolute neutrophil count of  900 cell/mm3. Noteworthy was that 
on dose- level 2 an 81 year-old and a 76 year-old patient have been on treatment without signific ant 
toxicity.  (In contrast, FOLFIRINOX is not recommended for patients > 75 years of age).  
At dose-level 2, one of six patients had urosepsis with an absolute neutrophil count of 900 cell/mm3. 
Noteworthy was that on dose- level 2 an 81 year-old and a 76 y ear-old patient have been on treatment 
without significant toxicity.  (In contrast, FOLFIRINOX is not recommended for patients > 75 years of 
age). The MTD of Abraxane ®    is 150mg/m2 every 2 weeks with FOLFOX. Cumulative peripheral 
neuropathy, similar to other FOLFOX regimens, is the most significant toxicity generally occurring after 
> 10 cycles of treatment. Eight of 9 patients (88%) who received 10  or more cycles of FOLFOX -A had 
grade 2 or greater neuropathy including 2 of 9 (22%) with  grade 3 neuropathy, None of the patients 
receiving less than 10 cycles of FOLFOX -A developed grade 2 neuropathy.  FOLFOX -A has substantial 
activity and may represent a promising regimen in pancreatic cancer. Based on the initial activity and toxicity profile from the phase I study, FOLFOX- A appears to be a promising regimen for patients with 
advanced pancreatic cancer. To further evaluate efficacy and toxicity, a phase II study will be initiated. To reduce the potential for neurotoxicity, this protocol will include dose reductions of oxaliplatin for grade 2 neurotoxicity. 
Current Proposal - A Phase II Study of FOLFOX -A: Based on the initial activity and toxicity profile 
from the phase I study, FOLFOX -A appears to be a promising regimen for patients with adv anced 
pancreatic cancer. To further evaluate efficacy a nd toxicity, a  phase II study will be initiated.

• Delay of treatment for > 2 weeks due to  treatment related  toxicity , not applicable for neuropathy, 
for neuropathy refe r to section 5.3 
 
        Each patient can be dose reduced a total of 2 times. All dose reductions are permanent.  
 
5.3  Neuropathy  
The goals of the following dose modification rules are to prevent patients from developing grade 3/4 
neuropathy during or after completion of FOLFOX -A and to facilitate patients being able to receive 12 
cycles of FOLFOX -A without grade 3/4 neuropathy. Fluo rouracil and leucovorin are not reduced for 
neuropathy. 
5.3.1 For patients experiencing grade 2 neuropathy: 
• Hold Oxali platin  For patients developing a first episode of grade 2 neuropathy, to reinstitute 
oxaliplatin, neuropathy must have improved to Grade < 1, however, Abraxane ®, 5-FU and 
leucovorin may be administered. For patients developing a first episode of grade 2 neuropathy, 
oxaliplatin should be permanently decreased to oxaliplatin dose level - 1 (68mg/m2) . Abraxane 
®, 5-FU and Leucovorin doses are not reduced for grade 2 neuropathy.  
• For patients developing a second episode of grade 2 neuropathy, oxaliplatin should be 
permanently decreased to oxaliplatin dose level - 2 (54mg/m2) . Abraxane ® and 5-FU and 
Leucovorin doses are not reduced for grade 2 neuropathy.  
• For patients developing a second episode of grade 2 neuropathy, to reinstitute oxaliplatin, neuropathy must have improved to Grade < 1, however, Abraxane ®, 5-FU and leucovorin may 
be administered. 
• For patients developing a third episode of grade 2 neuropathy, oxaliplatin should be permanently 
discontinued, however, Abraxane ®, 5-FU and leucovorin may be continued. 
• It is the investigators discretion to hold FOLFOX -A treatment for up to six weeks  secondary to 
patient’s experiencing grade 2 neuropathy. Hold for neuropathy must be documented.

after 10 cycles instead of continuing to 12 cycles. Reason for patient discontinuing treatment 
must be documented. 
5.3.2 For patients experiencing grade 3 neuropathy: 
• For patients developing grade 3  neuropathy, FOLFOX-A should be held until neuropathy 
improves to grade 1 or less. When treatment is resumed oxaliplatin and Abraxane ®  dose should 
be permanently decreased to 68mg/m2 and 120mg/m2 respectively. 5-FU and Leucovorin are not 
reduced for grade 3 neuropathy. 
• For patients developing a second episode of grade 3 neuropathy, FOLFOX-A should be held unti l 
neuropathy improves to grade 1 or less. When treatment is resumed oxaliplatin and Abraxane ®  
dose should be permanently decreased to 54mg/m2 and 96mg/m2 respectively.  
• For patients developing a third episode of grade 3 neuropathy they should be removed from study 
treatment.  
• Patients d eveloping grade 3 neuropathy should not receive more than 10 cycles of FOLFOX- A. 
Reason for patient discontinuing treatment must be documented. 
• It is also at the investigator ’s discretion to hold FOLFOX-A treatment for up to six weeks 
secondary to patient experiencing grade 3  neuropathy. Hold for neuropathy must be documented 
on treatment and AE forms. 
5.3.3: For patients experiencing grade 4 neuropathy, patients must come off study treatment.  
For patients who experience neuropathy grade 2 or worse and thus require a dose reduction to drugs as per 5.3.1 and 5.3.2 and then require a dose reduction per the criteria in section 5.2, please note that patients 
will be reduced per the dose modification table under section 5.0 per drug.  
For example if a patient experiences grade 2 neuropathy, per section 5.3.1, Abraxane, Leucovorin and 5_FU are to be administered, but only when neuropathy is < grade 1 can Oxaliplatin be reinstituted.  
Oxaliplatin will be reduced by 1 dose level. However if they then experience a toxicity per section 5.2 
which prompts a dose reduction per the dose modification table in section 5.0, the Abraxane ®  and 5-
FU would be reduced per Dose level - 1 and the Oxaliplatin would be reduced per Dose level -2 
(Oxaliplatin would be reduced per Dose level - 2 as this patient would have experienced a dose reduction 
to Oxaliplatin per the neuropathy grade 2) . Please note that investigators can hold treatment for 6 weeks 
secondary to neuropathy and this will not count as another reason for dose reduction, the grade 2 
neuropathy is the event that would prompt the dose modification per section 5.3.1. 
For patients who experience neuropathy grade 3, per section 5.3.2, FOLFOX -A wil l be held and when 
neuropathy is < grade 1, Abraxane ® and Oxaliplatin will be reduced by 1 dose level  and 5- FU and 
Leucovorin are not reduced.  However if they then  subsequently experience a toxicity per section 5.2 
which prompts a dose reduction per the dose modification table in section 5.0, the 5- FU will be reduced 
per Dose level - 1 and the Oxaliplatin and Abraxane ®  will be reduced per Dose level -2. Leucovorin is 
not reduce d. Please note that investigators can hold treatment for 6 weeks secondary to neuropathy and 
this will not count as another reason for dose reduction ( as noted above in bullet 6 of section 5.2).  
There are no further reductions past Dose level -2

Patients with severe (defined as grade ≥ 3) hypersensitivity reactions from oxaliplatin or Abraxane ®  must 
be removed from protocol treatment. Patients with  hypersensitivity reactions, including pneumonitis, 
cannot be re -challenged.  
Examples of medications to reduce risk of hypersensitivity reactions to oxaliplatin and Abraxane ® include: 
Dexamethasone 20 mg PO or IV, 12 and 6 hours prior to the oxaliplatin or Abraxane ®  dose;  
Dexamethasone 20 mg PO or IV, as well as diphenhydramine 50 mg IV, and one of the following: 
cimetidine 300 mg IV, ranitidine 50 mg IV, or famotidine 20 mg IV 30- 60 minutes  prior to oxalipla tin or 
Abraxane ®  administration.  
 
If these prophylactic measures or institutional practices fail to prev ent severe oxaliplatin or Abraxane ® 
related hypersensitivity, therapy with oxaliplatin and Abraxane® should be discontinued and the patient 
should be r emoved from protocol treatment. 
 5.5  Pulmonary Fibrosis  
In the case of unexplained respiratory symptoms such as nonproductive cough, dyspnea or 
radiological pulmonary infiltrates, Abraxane ®  and oxaliplatin should be held until further 
investigation excludes interstitial pulmonary fibrosis.  If interstitial pulmonary fibrosis is confirmed, both  Abraxane ®  and oxaliplatin therapy should be terminated and the patient 
removed from protocol treatment. If pulmonary fibrosis is not confirmed and the investigator 
believes the patient can continue on study, the patient will begin treatment at their next scheduled 
cycle at a 20% dose reduction. If this is their third episode of dose reduction, patie nt will be 
removed from study. 
 
Interstitial Pneumonitis  
Interstitial pneumonitis has been observed in < 1% during Abraxane ®  monotherapy and in < 1% during 
combination treatment with Abraxane ®  and carboplatin. However, the risk has been higher for the 
combination of Abraxane ®  with gemcitabine. Pneumonitis has been reported at a rate of 4% with the 
use of Abraxane ®  in combination with gemcitabine. Monitor patients c losely for signs and symptoms of 
pneumonitis. After ruling out infectious etiology and upon making a diagnosis of pneumonitis, 
permanently discontinue treatment with Abraxane ®  and gemcitabine and promptly initiate appropriate treatment and supportive measures.  
Prevention, Surveillance and Management of Interstitial Pneumonitis  
a. Before starting treatment with Abraxane ®  candidates should be evaluated for familial, 
environmental or occupational exposure to opportunistic pathogens: do not enroll patients with a 
history of slowly progressive dyspnea and unproductive cough, or pulmonary conditions such as sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis or multiple 
allergies.  
b. During treatment with Abraxane ®  episodes of transient or repeated dyspnea with unproductive persistent cough or fever should be paid attention to. Radiographic evaluation with c hest X -rays 
and computed tomography (CT) scans (normal or high resolution) may be indicated to look for infiltrates ground-glass opacities or honeycombing patterns. Pulse oximetry and pulmonary 
function tests can show respiratory and ventilation compromise. 
c. Infections should be ruled out with routine microbiological and/or immunologic methods. 
Transbronchial lung biopsy is not recommended, given its limited value and risk of 
pneumothorax and hemorrhage, and should be reserved for cases with unclear etiology. 
d.  Upon a diagnosis of interstitial pneumonitis Abraxane ®  should be permanently discontinued. 
After ruling out an infectious etiology, intravenous high-dose corticosteroid therapy should be

Patients with an added immunological component may also require immune modulation with 
azathioprine or cyclophosphamide. Appropriate ventilation and oxygen support should be used 
when required. 
 
5.6 Sepsis  
Sepsis has been reported in less than 1% during monotherapy and fatalities attributed to these events have been rare. However, the risk was appreciably higher in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreatic 
cancer receiving Abraxane ®  in combination with gemcitabine with a rate of 5% in patients with or 
without neutropenia receiving Abraxane ®  /gemcitabine. Complications due to the underlying pancreatic 
cancer, especially biliary obstruction or presence of biliary stent, were identified as significant contributing factors. The increased risk of sepsis in the setting of advanced or metastatic cancer in 
combination with gemcitabine could be managed with prophylactic antibiotic treatment in febrile patients 
(regardless of neutrophil count) and dose reduction, and with G-CSF treatment in neutropenic patients. If 
a patient becomes febrile (regardless of neutrophil count), initiate treatment with broad spectrum antibiotics. For febrile neutropenia, withhold Abraxane ®  and gemcitabine until fever resolves and ANC 
≥ 1500, then resume treatment at reduced dose levels.  
 
5.7 Drug Interactions 
While no drug interactions have been studied, the metabolism of paclitaxel is enhanced by CYP2C8 and 
CYP3A4. Therefore patients should be informed about the potential of a drug interaction if they are also 
taking drug that induce or inhibit CYP2C8 (antifungals, erythromycin, cimetidine etc) or CYP3A4 
(rifampicin, phenytoin, etc).

Note: The primary endpoint of this study is survival. Measurable or assessable disease is not 
required in this study, but for patients who do  have measurable disease, measurements must be 
submitted to BrUOG at baseline and RECIST to be used throughout to assess response. 
Radiographic response will be recorded when available but is not a primary endpoint.  
 
Patient’s without measurable disease a t baseline:  To be followed for survival. Progression and 
response can be defined as clinical progression, the appearance of one or more new lesions and tumor 
burden at baseline  to be used for assessment and measurement for objective response by treating MD .   
    
Patient’s with measurable disease at baseline : 
Measurement of Response  
Response will be evaluated in this study using the international criteria proposed in the Revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)  Guideline version 1.1 [ Eur J Cancer . 2009;45:228-247.]  
See http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/docs/recist_guideline.pdf?  further details.  
Measurable disease: Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least 
one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥20 mm by chest x- ray, as ≥10 mm with CT scan, or 
≥10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or 
decimal fractions of centimeters).  
Non-measurable disease:  All other lesions (o r sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter 
<10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥ 10 to <15 mm short axis) .  
Response Criteria: Evaluation of Target Lesions 
Complete Response 
(CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions; Any pathologica l 
lymph nodes (whether target or non- target) must have 
reduction in short axis to <10 mm. 
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters  
Progressive Disease 
(PD):  At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demons trate an absolute increase of at 
least 5 mm.  (Note:  the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).

9.0  PHARMACEUTICAL INFORMATION OF CHEMOTHERAPEUTICS  
9.1 Fluorouracil  
See package insert for comprehensive information.  
9.1.1  Formulation 
Each 10 ml ampule contains 500 mg of the drug (50 mg/ml), adjusted to a pH of approximately 9 with sodium hydroxide. 5-Fluorouracil is a fluorinated pyrimidine differing from the normal RNA substrate, 
uracil, by a fluorinated number 5 carbon. The chemical has a pH of 8.1, and the 
commercially available solution is buffered with NaOH to obtain an alkalin e solution 
with a pH of around 9.0. The drug is both light sensitive and will precipitate at low 
temperatures or, occasionally, after a prolonged period at room temperature. Melting Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study

sodium content is 8.24 mg/ml and molecular weight 130.08. 
9.1.2  Mechanism of Action   
The metabolism of 5 -FU in the anabolic pathway blocks the methylation reaction of 
deoxyuridylic acid to thymidylic acid. In this fashion, 5- FU interferes wi th the synthesis 
of DNA. This creates a thymine deficiency that provides unbalanced growth and cell 
death. Prolonged administration of 5- FU continuous infusion may favor 5- FU 
incorporation into RNA. 
9.1.3  Pharmacokinetics  
5-FU is rapidly absorbed by the t issues. Studies with radioactively labeled 5 -FU 
administered i.v., have indicated passage of the drug through the blood- brain barrier. 
Intravenous administration gives a half -time of 5 -7.5 minutes at a 15 mg/kg dose. 
Following the i.v. administration of a single 15 mg/kg dose of radioactively labeled drug, 
levels of 28 mcg/ml, 2 -8 mcg/ml, and 0.72 mcg/ml in plasma were observed at 10 
minutes, 2 hours, and 24 hours, respectively. The drug is largely catabolized in the liver 
and excreted in the form of nontox ic metabolites. Eighty percent of the drug is excreted 
as CO 2 from the lungs, and approximately 15% is excreted intact in the urine in 6 hours. 
Of this, 90% is excreted in the first hour.  
9.1.4  Administration  
5-FU will be administered as a continuous IV infusion over 46 hours every 2 weeks.   
9.1.5  Known Side Effects and Toxicities 
Mild nausea and vomiting, stomatitis, anorexia, diarrhea, alopecia, hand/foot syndrome, 
myelosuppression, cerebellar ataxia, skin, and cardiac toxicity have been observed. The most common toxicities with continuous infusion 5- FU are mucositis and hand/foot 
syndrome. 
9.1.6  Storage and Stability 
5-FU is stored at room temperature. 5- FU is light sensitive and forms precipitates at low 
temperatures.  
9.1.7  Supply

oxaliplatin. The powder is a white to off -white cake or powder contained in clear glass 
vials, sealed with an elastomeric stopper and aluminum seal with a flip -off cover. The 
excipient is lactose monohydrate, 450 mg and 900 mg respectively. 
9.2.5 Preparation 
Reconstitute with 10 mL for 50 mg and 20 mL for 100 mg product sterile water or 5% 
dextrose to provide an initial concentration of 5 mg/mL. Subsequent dilution with 
250-500 mL 5% Dextrose. 
9.2.6 Incompatibilities  
Do not mix or administer with saline or other chloride containing solutions. Oxaliplatin is unstable in the presence of chloride. Oxaliplatin may be administered simultaneously with leucovorin by the same infusion line, provided that they are 
reconstituted in D5W. Do not mix with alkaline solutions. Oxaliplatin is unstable 
under alkaline conditions. Do not use components containing aluminum for the preparation of oxaliplatin administration. There is a risk of drug degradation when in contact with aluminum. 
9.2.7 Administration 
The diluted solution of oxaliplatin in 250- 500 ml 5% dextrose is administered IV by 
an infusion pump over 2 hours.

Reconstituted ABRAXANE ®  should be used immediately, but may be refrigerated at 2ºC to 8ºC 
(36ºF to 46ºF) for a maximum of 8 hours if necessary. If not used immediately, each vial of 
reconstituted suspension should be replaced in the original carton to protect it from bright light. Discard 
any unused portion.  
Stability of Reconstituted Suspension in the Infusion Bag  
The suspension for infusion prepared as recommended in an infusion bag should be used immediately, but may be stored at ambient temperature (approximately 25º C) and lighting conditions for up to 4 
hours.  
Study Medication Administration 
ABRAXANE ®  is injected into a vein [intravenous (I.V.) infusion] over approximately 30 minutes.  
The use of an in- line filter is not recommended.  
Reconstitution and use of ABRAXANE ®  
1. Calculate the patient’s body surface area at the beginning of the study and if the weight changes 
by > 10% by using the formula provided in the study manual. If this is not done it will be 
considered a minor deviation. Weight gain secondary to edema does not require dose re-
calculation. 
2. Calculate the total dose (in mg) t o be administered by:  
• Total Dose (mg) = BSA x (study dose mg/m2 )  
3. Calculate the total number of vials required by: 
Total Number of Vials = Total Dose (mg)  
                             100 (mg/vial) 
Round up the number of vials to be reconstituted to the next higher whole number when a 
fractional number of vials is obtained by the above formula (eg, if the total number of vials = 4.05 or 4.5, then 5 vials would be reconstituted).  
4. Using sterile technique, prepare the vials for reconstitution.  
5. Swab the rubber stoppers with alcohol.  
6. Aseptically, reconstitute each ABRAXANE ®  vial by injecting 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium 
Chloride Injection, USP.  
• Slowly  inject the 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, over a minimum of 1 
minute , using the sterile syringe directing the solution flow onto the inside wall  of the 
vial. 
• DO NOT INJECT  the 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP solution directly onto the 
lyophilized cake as this will result in foaming.  
• Once the injection is complete, allow the vial to sit for a minimum of 5 (five) minutes to 
ensure proper wetting of the lyophilized cake/powder.   
• Gently  swirl and/or invert the vial slowly for at least 2 minutes until complete dissolution 
of any cake/powder occurs.  Avoid generation of foam.  Rapid agitation or shaking will 
result in foaming.  
• If foaming or clumping occurs, stand solution for at least 15 minutes until foam subsides.

7. Calculate the exact total dosing volume of 5 mg/ml suspension required for the patient:  
• Dosing volume (ml) = Total dose (mg) / 5 (mg/ml) 
8. The reconstituted suspension should be milky and homogeneous without visible particulates.  If 
particulates or settling are visible, the vial should be gently inverted again to ensure complete 
resuspension prior to use.  Discard the reconstituted suspension if precipitates are observed.  
9. Once the exact volume of reconstituted ABRAXANE ®  has been withdrawn from the vials, 
discard any excess solution left over in accordance with standard operating  procedures.  
10. Further dilution is not necessary. Inject the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted 
ABRAXANE ®  suspension into an empty sterile, standard PVC IV bag using an injection port.  
Inject perpendicularly into the center of the injection port to  avoid dislodging plastic material 
into the IV bag.   
11. Administer the calculated dosing volume of reconstituted ABRAXANE ®  suspension by IV 
infusion over 30 minutes.  The use of in- line filters is not recommended because the 
reconstituted solution may clog the filter  
12.  Following administration of Abraxane, the intravenous line should be flushed with sodium 
chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure administration of the complete dose, according to local practice

BrUOG considers the SAE reporting period to begin when the subject signs the study specific inf ormed 
consent.  
 
This study will utilize the descriptions and grading scales found in the NCI Common Terminology 
Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 for grading all adverse events. All appropriate 
treatment areas should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. A copy of the CTCAE version 
4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP web site (http://ctep.cancer.gov).  
 An Adverse Event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical 
investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have to have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign 
(including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of 
Abraxane ® whether or not considered related to Abraxane ® . This includes any newly occurring event or 
previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of drug. 
 During clinical trials, adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open-ended 
questioning, examination, or evaluation of a subject. (In order to prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more adverse events.) 
 
Adverse events (AEs) will be recorded in the case report form for the duration of the trial, regardless of whether or not the event(s) are considered related to trial medication. All AEs considered related to trial 
medication will be followed until resolution even  if this occurs post -trial. 
11.1 Definitions  
An adverse event  is any new, undesirable medical experience or change of an existing condition that 
occurs during or after treatment, whether or not considered product- related.  
 Serious adverse event (SAE) 
An adverse event occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes (CFR 312.32): 
• death  
• is life -threatening  
• inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization excluding  those for study drug 
administration, transfusional support, disease staging/re-staging procedures, concomitant 
radiotherapy, thoracentesis / paracentesis, or placement of an indwelling catheter, unless associated with other serious events. 
• persistent or significant disability or incapacity,  
• congenital anoma ly / birth defect.  
 The definition of serious adverse event (experience) also includes important medical event . Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as importa nt medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or  result in  
death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the 
other outcomes listed in the definition above.  These should also usually be considered serious.  Examples 
of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse. A new  diagnosis of cancer during the course of treatment should be considered an important 
medical event.

experience. 
 
Unexpected adverse event  
An adverse event that is not mentioned in the Investigator's Brochure or package insert or the specificity or severity of which is not consistent with the investigator's brochure or package insert.  
 
Life-threatening  
Any adverse drug experience that places the patien t or subject, in the view of the investigator, at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  It does not include a reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  
 
11.2 Monitoring of Adverse Events and Period of Observation  
Adverse events, both serious and non- serious, and deaths that occur during the patient’s study 
participation will be recorded in the source documents.  All SAEs should be monitored until they are 
resolved or are clearly determined to be due to a patient’s stable or chronic condition or intercurrent 
illness(es).  
 
11.3 BRUOG ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS   
Investigators are required by Federal Regulation to report adverse drug reactions. Questions regarding 
drugs as used in this study should be directed to the Brown University Oncology Research Group 
(BrUOG) Central Office, Phone: (401) 863-3000 Fax (401) 863-3820, which will in turn notify the 
Principal Investigator.  
 
Intensity for each adverse event will be scored using CTCAE Version 4.0.  A copy of the CTCAE 
Version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP homepage ( http://ctep.info.nih.gov
).  All appropriate 
treatment areas have access to a copy of the CTCAE Version 4.0.  All adverse clinical experiences, whether observed by the investigator or reported by the patient, must be recorded, with details about the duration and intensity of each episode, the action taken with respect to the test drug, and the patient’s 
outcome.  The investigator must eval uate each adverse experience for its relationship to the test drug and 
for its seriousness.  
 
11.3.1 Pregnancies  
Pregnancies occurring while the subject is on study drug or within 4 weeks after the subject’s last dose of 
study drug are considered expedited reportable events.  If the subject is on study drug, the study drug is to 
be discontinued immediately.  The pregnancy must be reported to the Brown University Oncology 
Research Group, by the site, immediately (within 24 hours), via the site completed Celgene pregnancy 
reporting Form and a 3500A MedWatch form (site to submit to BrUOG), and BrUOG will in turn report 
to Celgene immediately (within 1 working day and once in receipt of the site submitted SAE forms). 
Pregnancies and suspected pregnancies (including a positive pregnancy test regardless of age or disease 
state) of a female subject occurring while the subject is on IP, or within 4 weeks  (30 days) of the subject’s 
last dose of IP, are considered immediatel y reportable events. IP is to be discontinued immediately. The 
pregnancy, suspected pregnancy, or positive pregnancy test must be reported to Celgene Drug Safety 
immediately by facsimile, or other appropriate method  (to be done by BrUOG), using the Celgene  
pregnancy report form and the Medwatch3500A form ( Celgene pregnancy  reporting form and MedWatch 
3500A- to be completed by site) . 
 
The Investigator will follow the subject until completion of the pregnancy, and must notify Celgene (by 
informing BrUOG)  of the outcome as specified below.  The Investigator will provide this information as a

classification as a SAE (i.e., spontaneous abortion [any congenital anomaly  detected in an aborted fetus is 
to be documented], stillbirth, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly), the Investigator should follow the 
procedures for reporting SAEs (i.e., report the event to BrUOG who will then report to Celgene  by 
facsimile  or email  within 1 working day of being in receipt of the submitted SAE forms from the site ). 
 Any suspected fetal exposure to Abraxane ® must be reported to BrUOG within 24 hours who will then 
report to  Celgene  within 1 working day  of being in receipt of the submi tted SAE forms from the site .  The 
patient should be referred to an obstetrician/gynecologist experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and counseling. 
 All neonatal deaths that occur within 30 days of birth should be reported, without re gard to causality, as 
SAEs.  In addition, any infant death after 30 days that the Investigator suspects to be related to the in utero exposure to the study drug should also be reported. In the case of a live “normal” birth, Celgene  
should be advised as soon as the information is available.  
 
If a female partner of a male subject taking investigational product becomes pregnant, the male subject 
taking IP should notify the Investigator, and the pregnant female partner should be advised to call their 
healthcare provider immediately.  Male patients treated with nab -paclitaxel are advised not to father a 
child during and up to 6 months after treatment.  
11.3.2: Serious Adverse Event Reporting Procedures  All pregnanc ies or suspected pregnancies, including suspected fetal exposure or neonatal deaths must be 
reported to the Brown University Oncology Research Group within 24 hours. BrUOG will report all pregnancies to Celgene within 1 working day of being made aware of t he event  via the submission of the 
Celgene Pregnancy Reporting Form/Follow up Pregnancy Reporting Form and the Medwatch 3500A, 
which will be sent to BrUOG from the site. All SAEs are to be reported via phone or email to BrUOG 
within 24 hours and t he site h as 5 business days (from being made aware of the event) to send the written 
report to BrUOG, who will then report the SAE  to Celgene product safety within 1 working day of receipt 
of the SAE forms sent to BrUOG by the site.  Initial SAE information and all amendments or additions must be recorded on an SAE  Form and faxed to Celgene. Sites are required to report any pregnancy, 
suspected fetal exposure or neonatal deaths via the Celgene pregnancy reporting form and a 3500A Medwa tch form. Both forms need to have the following labeled on both forms: 
o AX-CL-PANC- PI-003263  
o BrUOG  292

alert Celgene within 1 business day  of being in receipt of the SAE forms sent to BrUOG from the site. 
BrUOG will submit the SAE memo, and Medwatch 3500A to the FDA within 7 days. 
 
11.3.3 Expedited Reporting by Investigator to Celgene  
Serious adverse events (SAE) are defined above.  All events must be reported, by FAX  or email,  to the 
Brown University Oncology Research Group who must inform Celgene in writing using a MEDWATCH 
3500A form, of any SAE within 1 business day of being in receipt of the Medwatch form sent to BrUOG 
from the site.  The written report must be completed and it will then be  supplied by BrUOG to Celgene by 
facsimile  or email within 1 business day  of BrUOG b eing in receipt of the SAE documentation from the 
site.  The initial report must be as complete as possible, including an assessment of the causal relationship 
between the event and the investigational product(s), if available.  Information not available at the time of the initial report (e.g., an end date for the adverse event or laboratory values received after the report) 
must be documented on a follow-up report.  A final report to document resolution of the SAE (such as 
discharge from hospital)  is requi red.  The Celgene tracking number ( AX-CL-PANC -PI-003263) and the 
institutional protocol number should be included on SAE reports (or on the fax cover letter) sent to 
Celgene.  A copy of the fa x or email  transmission  confirmation of the SAE report to Celgene should be 
attached to the SAE and retained with the study records  at BrUOG. (Celgene does NOT send a 
confirmation so BrUOG will have to use documentation from their fax that it was sent) 
 
This includes serious, re lated, labeled (expected) and serious, related, unlabeled (unexpected) adverse 
experiences. All deaths during treatment or within 30 days following completion of active protocol 
therapy must be reported within 5 business days (from being made aware of the event) or as soon as the 
investigator is made aware of the event.  If the death is thought to be related to the study drug, deaths must 
be reported within 24 hours of the investigator being made aware of the event. 
All adverse events and special reporting situations, whether serious or non- serious, related or unrelated, 
will be reported from the time a signed and dated ICF is obtained until 30 days after the last dose of 
FOXLFOX -A, or until the subject withdraws consent from study participation (declines participation) or 
at the time patient becomes a screen failure, whichever occurs first.  
This includes the period in which the study protocol interferes with the standard medical treatment given 
to a patient (e.g. treatment withdrawal during washout period, change in treatment to a fixed dose of 
concomitant medication).   
 
Serious adverse events occurring more than 4 weeks after study discontinuation need only be reported if a relationship to the Celgene  study drug (or therapy) is suspected.  
For Comparator D rugs/Secondary Suspects (Concomitant Medications), all serious adverse experiences 
will be forwarded to the product manufacturer by the investigator. 
11.3.4 Overdose (to be reported as an important medical event)  
Overdose, as defined for this protocol, ref ers to ABRAXANE
® dosing only.   
On a per dose basis, an overdose is defined as the following amount over the protocol-specified dose of 
ABRAXANE® assigned to a given patient, regardless of any associated adverse events or sequelae.  
PO any amount over the protocol- specified dose  
Submitted to FDA 4 -8-14, 5/16/14, 5/19/14, 5/20/14, 5/29/14, 6/4/14, Amendment # 1 6/24/14, Amendment # 2 9/10/14, Amendment # 3, 
1/13/15, Amendment # 4 3/19/15, Amendment #5 8/11/15 HS approved, Amendment #5V2 10/6/15 Celgene approved, Amendment #6 
12/8/1 5 HS approved, 12/15/15 celgene approved, Amendment # 7 3/23/16, Amendment # 8 7/5/16, Celgene approved 8/8 /16, Amendment 
# 912/4/16, Amendment # 10 2/3/17 with IB 19, Amendment # 11 5/22/17, HS approved 5/24/17, Amendment # 12 8/21/17, Amendment # 13 12/ 26/18 26  IV 10% over the protocol- specified dose   
SC 10% over the protocol- specified dose  
On a schedule or frequency basis, an overdose is defined as anything more frequent than the protocol 
required schedule or frequency.   
On an infusion rate basis, an overdose is defined as any rate faster than the protocol -specified rate.  For 
nab-paclitaxel, an infusion completed in less than 25 minutes may increase Cmax by approximately 20%, 
therefore a nab-paclitaxel infusion completed in less than 25 minutes will meet the infusion rate criterion 
for an overdose.  
Complete data about drug administration, including any overdose, regardless of whether the overdose was accidental or intentional, should be reported. 
11.4 Reporting requirements and procedures depend upon:  
1. Whether investigational agents are suspected of causing toxicity;  
2. Whether the possibility of such a toxicity was reported in the protocol, consent form, or 
manufacturer’s literature (Expected toxicity); and  
3. The severity of grade of  the toxicity.   
 
11.5 Assessing Causality: 
Investigators are required to assess whether there is a reasonable possibility that treatment caused or contributed to an adverse event.  The following general guidance may be used: 
 
Yes: if the temporal relation ship of the clinical event to treatment administration makes a  
causal relationship possible, and other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions do not provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event.  
No: if the temporal relationship of the clinical event to treatment administration makes a  
causal relationship unlikely, or other drugs, therapeutic interventions or underlying conditions provide a sufficient explanation for the observed event. 
 11.6 Types of Report: For sites:  
Telephone report :  For SAE’s contact BrUOG Central Office (401) 863-3000 (or via email), 
immediately upon learning of the event (within 24 hours). Alert BrUOG with 24 hour notice before 
submitting a SAE report. 
 Written report : Send the copy of the Medwatch 3500 A form (and Celgene pregnancy reporting form for 
pregnancies if applicable) within 5 business days ( from  being made aware of the event ) to the BrUOG 
Central Office by email, scan or Fax:

within 24 hours of the investigator being made aware of the event.  
 MedWatch 3500A Reporting Guidelines:  
In addition to completing appropriate patient demographic and suspect medication information, the report 
should include the following information within the Event Description (section 5) of the MedWatch 3500A form: 
• Treatment regimen (dosing frequency, combination therapy)  
• Protocol description (and number, if assigned)  
• Description of event, severity, treatment, and outcome, if known  
• Supportive laboratory results and diagnostics 
• Investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to each investig ational product 
and suspect medication  (sites to document what event is related to as well as relationship to 
Abraxane)  
• Site must be clear about what events are being reported as serious  
• Must be typed 
• **It is required that you put the following numbers o n the Medwatch form for tracking:  
o AX-CL-PANC- PI-003263  
o BrUOG  292 
• Document patient status on study (i.e cycle being held, patient coming off secondary to SAE, patient off study etc) 
 A final report to document resolution of the SAE (such as discharge from hospital) is required.  
 Follow -up information:   
Additional Info may be added to a previously submitted report by any of the following methods. 
• Adding to the original MedWatch 3500A report and submitting it as follow-up 
• Adding supplemental summary information and submitting it as follow-up with the original MedWatch 3500A form  
 
Summarize new information and fax it with a cover letter including subject identifiers (i.e. D.O.B. initial, 
subject number), protocol description and number, if assigned, suspect d rug, brief adverse event 
description, and notation that additional or follow -up information is being submitted.  (The subject 
identifiers are important so that the new information is added to the correct initial report).  
 
The principal Investigator is required to notify his/her Institutional Review Board (IRB) of a serious 
adverse event according to institutional policy.    
11.7 BrUOG Responsibility Regarding Reporting:   
The BrUOG Central Office will notify by phone and/or fax all drug reaction reports to the FDA, the Principal Investigator, and the participating sites (who will in turn notify their local IRBs) as soon as 
possible but no later than 7 calendar days after initial receipt of the information from the site. BrUOG will alert Celgene to an SAE wit hin 1 business day of being made aware of the event via site submitted  
documentation. SAEs  will be reported as an amendment to the IND (if applicable)  within 15 days of 
sponsor notification. They will all receive a simultaneous copy via facsimile or email  of all adverse 
events filed with the FDA (which will be sent to the Medwatch fax line for IND exemption or to the 
division fax if there is an IND) . A copy of the form will be kept by the BrUOG Central Office.

If the FDA has granted an IND number, it is a requirement of 21 CFR 312.33, that an annual report is provided to the FDA within 60- days of the IND anniversary date.   21 CRF 312.33 provides the data 
elements that are to be submitted in the report.  The Annual Report should be filed in the study's 
Regulatory Binder, and a copy provided to Celgene Corporation as a supporter of this study as follows.  
Celgene Corporation 
Attn: Medical Affairs Operations  
Connell Corporate Park  
400 Connell Drive Suite 700 
Berkeley Heights, NJ   07922 
 All adverse experience reports must include the patient number, age, sex, weight, severity of reaction (e.g. mild, moderate, severe), relationship to drug (e.g. probably related, unknown relationship, definitely not 
related), date and time of administration of test medications and all concomitant medications, and medical 
treatment provided.   The investigator is responsible for evaluating all adverse events to determine 
whether criteria for “serious” as defined above are present.  The Brown University Oncology Research Group is responsible for reporting adverse events to Celgene as described  above. 
 
11.9 Adverse event updates/IND safety reports  
Celgene shall notify the Brown University Oncology Research Group (BrUOG) via an IND Safety Report of the following information:  
• Any AE associated with the use of study drug in this study or in other studies that is both serious 
and unexpected.

unexpected AE(s) or significant risks to subjects. 
 
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition that did not worsen from baseline is not 
considered an AE.  
 12.0 REMOVAL OF PATIENTS FROM PROTOCOL THERAPY 
Extraordinary medical circumstances or withdrawal of consent by the patient: If, at any time, the constraints 
of this protocol are detrimental to the patient's health, and/or the patient no longer wishes to continue protocol therapy, the patient shall be withdrawn from protocol therapy.  Patients will also be withdrawn from study for the following reasons:  
1. Disease Progression: Any patient with disease progression should be removed from study.  Details and tumor measurements sh ould be documented on flow sheets.  
2. Patient is unable to tolerate the toxicity resulting from the study treatment, even with optimal 
supportive care, in the opinion of the Treating Physician. Adverse event(s) that, in the judgment of the 
investigator, may cause severe or permanent harm or which rule out continuation of study drug.  
3. The physician feels it is in the best interest of the patient to stop the treatment. 
4. Inter current illness that would, in the judgment of the Investigator, affect assessment of cl inical 
status to a significant degree or require discontinuation of study treatment 5. Non protocol chemotherapy or immunotherapy is administered during the study 
6. Noncompliance with protocol or treatment—major violation 
7. Pregnancies or Suspected Pregnancies(including positive pregnancy test) 
8. Patient is lost to follow -up 
9. Patient refuses to continue treatment (patient will continue to be followed for disease -free 
survival and overall survival)  
10. Death  
In this event notify: 
Brown University Oncology Research Group  (BrUOG) Central Office,  
Phone:  (401) 863-3000 
Fax:  (401) 860-3820 
 
The BrUOG Central Office will in turn notify the Principal Investigator.  
*Document the reason(s) for withdrawal on flow sheets.  Follow the patient for survival with follow -
up forms as dictated by the protocol  
13.0 FOLLOW -UP  
All Subjects that discontinue treatment early for any reason as well as patients who complete therapy will 
be followed for survival  (up to 5 years). At treatment discontinuation, subjects will undergo adverse event 
evaluation and again approximately 30 days post the last dose of study drug. In addition off study 
evaluations will be done when treatment is discontinued -Section 6.0.   
14.0 REGULATORY CONSIDERATIONS  
This research study is sponsored by the Principal Investigator, Dr. Howard Safran, in collaboration with 
Brown University Oncology Research Group (BrUOG), which will serve as the central coordinating office for the study. This study is suppor ted by Celgene (the makers of Abraxane ® ).

The Investigator must ensure that patients or their legally acceptable representatives are clearly and fully 
informed about the purpose, potential risks and other critical issues regarding clinical trials in which they 
volunteer to participate.  Preparation of the consent form is the responsibility of the Investigator and must 
include all elements required by CFR 21 Part 50.25 and the local IRB. 
14.2 Compliance with the Protocol and Protocol Revisions:  
The study must be conducted as described in this approved protocol.   
All revisions to the protocol must be provided to Brown University Oncology Research Group, and 
Celgene.  The Investigator should not implement any deviation or change to the protocol without prior review and documented approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC and Celgene of an Amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study patients.  
Documentation of approval signed by the chairpers on or designee of the IRB(s)/IEC(s) must be sent to 
Brown University Oncology Research Group, and Celgene.  If the revision is an Administrative Letter, Investigators must inform their IRB(s)/IEC(s).  
The Investigator must ensure that patients or their leg ally acceptable representatives are clearly and fully 
informed about the purpose, potential risks and other critical issues regarding clinical trials in which they 
volunteer to participate.  Preparation of the consent form is the responsibility of the Inve stigator and must 
include all elements required by CFR 21 Part 50.25 and the local IRB. 
After the study has been fully explained, written informed consent will be obtained from either the patient 
or his/her guardian or legal representative prior to study participation.  The method of obtaining and documenting the informed consent and the contents of the consent will comply with ICH-GCP and all 
applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
 
14.3 Protocol amendments or changes in study conduct:  Any change or addition (excluding administrative) to this protocol requires a written protocol amendment that must be reviewed and approved by Brown University Oncology Research Group, Celgene and the 
investigator before implementation. Amendments significantly affecting the safety of subjects, the scope 
of the investigation or the scientific quality of the study require additional approval by the IRB at each study center.  A copy of the written approval of the IRB must be provided to Brown University Oncology Research Group, and Celgene. 
• Examples of amendments requiring such approval  
• Increases in drug dose or duration of exposure of subjects  
• Significant changes in the study design (e.g. addition or deletion of a control group) 
• Increases in the number of invasive procedures  
• Addition or deletions of a test procedure required for monitoring of safety.

necessary by the investigator and is implemented for safety reasons Brown University Oncology Research Group and Celgene must be notified and the IRB at the center must be informed immediately. 
Amendments affecting only administrative aspects of the study do not require formal protocol 
amendments or IRB approval but the IRB must be kept informed of such administrative changes.  
Examples of administrative changes not requiring formal protocol amendments and IRB approval include: 
• Changes in the staff used to monitor trials (Celgene considers a change in Principal Investigator 
or the addition of sub- site(s) to be substantial and requires Celgene approval prior to 
implementation)  
• Minor changes in the packaging or labeling of study drug. 
 
15.0 DATA MONITORING / QUALITY ASSURANCE/ RECORD RETENTION 15.1 Good Clinical Practice:  The study will be conducted in accordance with the International 
Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and in the US Code of Federal 
Regulations.  The investigator will be thoroughly familiar with the appropriate use of the drug as 
described in the protocol and Investigator’s Brochure.  E ssential clinical documents will be maintained to 
demonstrate the validity of the study and the integrity of the data collected.  Master files should be established at the beginning of the study, maintained for the duration of the study and retained accord ing 
to the appropriate regulations.   
15.2 Patient Confidentiality:  In order to maintain patient privacy, all data capture records, drug 
accountability records, study reports and communications will identify the patient by initials and the 
assigned patient  number.  The investigator will grant monitor(s) and auditor(s) from Celgene or its 
designees and regulatory authority (ies) access to the patient’s original medical records for verification of 
data gathered on the data capture records and to audit the data collection process.  The patient’s confidentiality will be maintained and will not be made publicly available to the extent permitted by the applicable laws and regulations.  
15.3 Protocol Compliance:  The investigator will conduct the study in compliance with the protocol 
given approval/favorable opinion by the IRB/IEC and the appropriate regulatory authority(ies).  Changes to the protocol will require approval from Celgene and written IRB/IEC approval/favorable opinion prior 
to implementation, except when the modification is needed to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to 
patients.  The IRB/IEC may provide, if applicable regulatory authority (ies) permit, expedited review and approval/favorable opinion for minor change(s) in ongoing studies that have the approval /favorable opinion of the IRB/IEC.  The investigator will submit all protocol modifications to Celgene and the 
regulatory authority (ies) in accordance with the governing regulations.  
Any departures from the protocol must be fully documented in the source documents.   
15.4 On- site Audits:  Regulatory authorities, the IEC/IRB and/or Celgene clinical quality assurance group 
may request access to all source documents, data capture records, and other study documentation for on-
site audit or inspection.  D irect access to these documents must be guaranteed by the investigator, who 
must provide support at all times for these activities.

principal investigator .  The investigator will ensure that the drug is used only in accordance with this 
protocol.  Drug accountability records indicating the drug’s delivery date to the site (if applicable), 
inventory at the site (if applicable), use by each patient, and retur n to Celgene for disposal of the drug (if 
applicable and if approved by Celgene) will be maintained by the clinical site.  Accountability records 
will include dates, quantities, lot numbers, expiration dates (if applicable), and patient numbers.   
All material containing Abraxane ® will be treated and disposed of as hazardous waste in accordance 
with governing regulations. 
15.6 Premature Closure of the Study: This study may be prematurely terminated, if in the opinion of 
the investigator or Celgene, there is sufficient reasonable cause.  Written notification documenting the 
reason for study termination will be provided to the investigator or Celgene by the terminating party.   
Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to patients 
• Failure to enter patients at an acceptable rate  
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements  
• Insufficient complete and/or evaluable data  
• Plans to modify, suspend or discontinue the development of the drug 
• Should the study be closed prematurely, all study materials must be returned to Celgene. 
15.7 Record Retention:  The investigator w ill maintain all study records according to ICH -GCP and applicable regulatory 
requirement(s).   
The Brown University Oncology Research Group, as coordinator of this study, is responsible for ensuring 
proper conduct of the study with regard to protocol adhe rence and the validity of the data recorded on the 
case report forms. The Principle Investigator (Howard Safran, M.D.) and Brown University Oncology 
Research Group will monitor this study. The case report forms will be monitored against the submitted 
docum ents for accuracy, completeness, adherence to the protocol and regulatory compliance.  
U.S. FDA regulations (21CFR312.62[c] require all records and documents pertaining to the conduct of 
this study and the distribution of investigational drug, including CR Fs, consents forms, laboratory test 
results and medication inventory records, must be retained by the Principal Investigator for 2 years after 
marketing application approval. If no application is filed, these records must be kept 2 years after the investig ation is discontinued and the FDA and the applicable local health authorities are notified. Celgene 
will notify the Principle Investigator if an application is filed.  
16.0 DATA SAFETY AND MONITORING BOARDS  
All trials initiated by the Brown University Onco logy Research Group (BrUOG) are subject to oversight 
by the Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB).  This board meets two times per year with any additional 
meetings scheduled when needed.  The responsibilities are as follows:

• Review interim analyses of outcome data and cumulative toxicity data summaries to determine 
whether the trial should continue as originally designed, should be changed, or should be terminated based on these data.   
• The DSMB also determines whether and to whom outcome results should be released prior to the reporting of study results. 
• All adverse events are reviewed by the committee, with assurances that these have been in fact sent for review to all pertinent IRBs.  
• Review of reports of related studies to determine whether the monitored study needs to be changed or terminated.  
• Review major proposed modifications to the study prior to their implementation (e.g., termination, dropping an arm based on toxicity results or other reported trial outcomes, increasing target sample size).  
• Following each DSMB meeting, provide the study leadership with written information concerning findings for the trial as a whole rela ted to cumulative toxicities observed and any 
relevant recommendations related to continuing, changing, or terminating the trial.  
 
The study leadership will provide information on cumulative toxicities and relevant recommendations to 
the local principal investigators to be shared with their IRB’s.  
17.0 STATISTICS Null Hypothesis:  
Median survival with experimental FOLFOX -A in metastatic pancreatic cancer is less than or equal to that 
with standard gemcitabine.  
Alternate Hypothesis:  
Median survival with experimental FOLFOX -A in advanced pancreatic cancer is increased by 3 months  
with standard gemcitabine.  
This study is a phase II non- randomized clinical trial that would compare  survival of patients receiving 
FOLFOX -A regimen in this trial to that of historical controls who received gemcitabine.  The median 
survival of patients receiving gemcitabine alone is approximately 6.5 months. We would assume that our 
study would show that median survival by FOLFOX -A is increased by 3 months with  FOLFOX -A, i.e. to 
about 9.5 months . 
We calculated a sample size of about 50 patients with an accrual period of 24 months (about 2 patients/month) with a 6 month additional follow up time after recruitment. This would provide a power (1-beta) of 75% to reject the null hypothesis with a type I error probability (alpha) of 0.2.  
Patients treated at the phase II dose level from the phase I study with metastatic pancreatic cancer may be included in the analysis of the phase II study.

Agreement to Participate in a Research Study  And  Authorization for Use and Disclosure of 
Informatio n 
FOLFOX -A For Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer:  
A Phase II Brown University Oncology Research Group Trial  
 
You are being asked to take part in a research study.  All research studies at  <insert Hospital name > 
hospitals follow the rules of the state of < insert state >, the United States government and  <insert 
Hospital name> .  Before you decide whether to be in the study, you and the researcher will engage in the 
“informed consent” process.   During this proce ss, the researcher will explain the purpose of the study, 
how it will be carried out, and what you will be expected to do if you participate.  The researcher will also 
explain the possible risks and benefits of being in the study, and will provide other information.  You should feel free to ask any questions you might have.  The purpose of these discussions is for you to decide whether participating in the study is the best decision for you.  
If you decide to be in the study, you will be asked to sign and date this form in front of the person who 
explained the study to you.  This form summarizes the information you discussed.  You will be given a copy of this form to keep.   Nature and Purpose of the Study      
Your doctors are participating in this research study with  the Principal Investigator, Dr. Howard Safran, in 
collaboration with Brown University Oncology Research Group (BrUOG), which will serve as the central 
coordinating office for the study.  
You are be ing asked to take part in this study because you have recently been diagnosed with advanced  
(metastatic)  pancreatic cancer. This means that your cancer has spread from your pancreas to other parts 
of your body and cannot  be removed by surgery.  A standard treatment for your cancer is called 
FOLFIRINOX using FDA approved chemotherapy drugs: fluorouracil, leucovorin, oxaliplatin and 
irinotecan). In this study you will receive the chemotherapy treatment FOLFOX -A (fluorouracil, 
leucovorin, oxaliplatin  and Abrax ane ® ), removing irinotecan and using Abraxane ® instead . Even 
though Abraxane is FDA approved for pancreatic cancer, the combination of Abraxane with the other 3 drugs is being investigated. Your doctors are studying the activity and side effects of FOLFOX- A in 
advanced (metastatic) pancreatic cancer.  
This study is supported by Celgene Corporation, the maker of Abraxane ® . 
How Many People will take part in the Study?  
Approximately 50 patients will participate  
Explanation of Procedures   
What will happen if I take part in this research study?  
If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take part, then 
you will need the following tests and procedures, while on the study.  They are part of regular cancer care.

• Physical examination prior to starting treatment  and then every 2 weeks 
• Blood tests ( requiring approximately 2 tablespoons of blood)  prior to starting treatment and then 
every 2 weeks 
• CT scan (or MRI /PET  scan ) of the abdomen and chest prior to starting treatment and then 
approximately every 12 weeks (3 months). 
• EKG ( a test to  check your heart function) prior to starting treatment 
• Pregnancy Test -Women of child bearing potential must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test 
within 7 days pri or to starting treatment 
 
FOLFOX -A is administered intravenous ly (IV) every 2 weeks (one treatment cycle is equal to 2 weeks). 
These drugs are given into a special intravenous (into your vein) device called a port -a-cath. A port-a- cath 
is a standard intravenous device used for chemotherapy that is implanted beneath the skin below the 
collarbone. A surgeon or radiologist will place the port-a- cath. You will sign a separate surgical consent 
for placement of the port -a-cath. This is standa rd-of-care.  
When you receive FOLFOX -A treatment, you will first be given Abraxane ® over 30 minutes. The 
oxaliplatin is then administered over 2 hours. The leucovorin can either be administered after the 
oxaliplatin or at the same time and takes about 2 h ours. The fluorouracil is then given using a small 
outpatient chemotherapy pump which will last over 4 6 hours. Hospitalization is usually not required for 
the administration of these drugs. After completion of FOLFOX -A, a nurse will come to your home or 
you will return to the clinic to have the chemotherapy pump disconnected. After completion of the 48-
hour treatment of FOLFOX -A your doctors may recommend that receive the standard drug Neulasta, 
which is given as a shot beneath the skin to help reduce the risk that your white blood cells will become 
too low after FOLFOX -A and to  reduce your risk of infection .  
How long will I be in the study?  
You wi ll receive FOLFOX -A for up to six months (12 treatments) or as long as your cancer does not 
grow or spread and you do not have severe side effects from FOLFOX- A. After completion of FOLFOX-
A, you will be followed for up to 5 years for survival. 
Can I stop being in the study?  
Yes. You can decide to stop at any time.  Tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping or decide to stop.  He or she will tell you how to stop safely.   
It is important to tell the study doctor if you are thinking about stopping so any risks from the 
discontinuation of treatment can be evaluated by your doctor.  Another reason to tell your doctor that you 
are thinking about stopping is to discuss what follow-up care and testing could be most helpful for you.  
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in your 
best interest; if you do not follow the study rules; or if the study is stopped.

Reproductive Risks  
Chemotherapy may decrease the sperm count. This is usually temporary but is infrequently permanent, 
which would result in sterility. Because the drugs in this study can affect an unborn baby, you should not 
become pregnant while on this study. Ask your study doctor for more information regarding preventing 
pregnancy during the study treatments. You should not nurse your baby while on this study. If you are premenopausal, your periods are likely to stop temporarily and may stop permanently due to the study 
treatments, which may lead to symptoms of menopause, such as hot flashes, and the inability to become

for preserving your reproductive choices, which may include referral to a specialist in this field.   
Females:  Abraxane ®  ( nab-paclitaxel ) can cause harm to an unborn child if given to a pregnant 
woman.  You cannot take part in this study if you are pregnant or breast- feeding.  Because of the possible 
risks to an unborn child, if you are a female who can become pregnant, you will be asked to take a 
pregnancy test within 7 days  prior to starting study drug treatment. 
If you decide to take part in this study, you should avoid becoming pregnant while receiving study 
medication. Yo u must commit to comp lete abstinence from heterosexual contact, or agree to use 
medical docto r-approved contraception throughout the study with out interruption;  while receiving  study 
medication or for a l onge r period if required by local regulations.  If you become pregnant while 
receiving study m edicat ion or within 3 months after taking y our l ast dose of study medica tion, you must 
tell the study doctor ri ght away.  If this happens, study m edication will be di scontinu ed.  The study 
doctor wil l follow you and your pregnancy to comp letion. 
 
Males:   
If yo u have a partner of childbearing  potential, you should avoid fathering  a child  while receiving  study 
medicat ion and for 6 m onths after the last dose of study  medication.  You  must agree to  comp lete 
abstinenc e from heterosexual contact  or use a condom during sexual contact with a f emale of child 
bearing potential while receiving study m edicat ion and within 6 months af ter last dose of study 
medication.  If your partner beco mes pregnant  while  you are receiving study m edication or wi thin 6 
mont hs after  you took y our l ast dose  of study medica tion, you m ust tell the study  doctor ri ght away. 
 
B
y signing this document you are acknowledging that you understand and agree to the information 
presented in the Reproductive Risk section above.  
Antiemetics (anti -nausea medications): Various medications used to prevent nausea and 
vomiting may cause drowsiness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation, headache, restlessness, 
agitation, anxiety, dizziness, involuntary tremors, skin rash, and possible allergic reaction. 
You will receive pre-medication to reduce the risk of infusion/injection reactions on your treatment days. 
Overall, the pre -medications you wi ll be given are well tolerated.  
 
Venipuncture (inserting a needle into a vein to obtain blood or give medication): May cause 
inflammation, pain, bruising, bleeding, or infection. 
When you receive chemotherapy by vein, there is a slight risk that some of the drug may leak out around 
the needle at the injection site. A skin burn may result. Most skin burns are treatable and heal well.  
In order to monitor the side effects, and as part of standard of care,  your physician will examine you 
frequently and obtain laboratory tests (blood tests, chest x -rays, or CT scans as needed) to determine the 
effects of your treatment and alter the drug dosages if necessary.  
There may be other side effects that have not been reported. If you have any unusual symptoms, you should report them immediately to your doctor or nurse.

Taking part in this study may or may not make your health better. While doctors hope that FOLFOX- A 
will be  active against pancreatic cancer and the side effects are not too severe, this is not yet known. We 
do know that the information from this study will help doctors learn more about these drugs as a 
treatment for cancer. This information could help future c ancer patients.  
Alternative Therapies  
What other choices do I have if I do not take part in this study?  
• Getting treatment or care for your cancer without being in a study  such as receiving the chemotherapy 
drug gemcitabine or combinations of chemotherapy such as FOLFOX or FOLFIRINOX 
• Taking part in another study 
• Getting no treatment 
• Getting comfort care, also called palliative care. This type of care helps reduce pain, tiredness, appetite 
problems, and other problems caused by the cancer. It does not treat the cancer directly, but instead tries to improve how you feel. Comfort care tries to keep you as active and comfortable as possible.  
 Talk to your doctor about your choices before you decide if you will take part in this study. 
 
Refusal/Withdrawal  
It is up to you whether you want to be in the study.  You are not required to enroll or participate.  If you 
decide to participate, you can always change your mind and quit at any time.  If you decide not to be in the study, or if you quit later, you will still be able to get the standard of care health care services you 
normally get.  If you join, but later on the researcher or your doctor feels being in the study is no longer good for you, they may choose to take you out of the study before it is over.  If new information becomes 
available that might change your mind about whether you want to stay in the study the researcher will share this information with you as soon as possibl e. 
 If you decide to withdraw from this study (stop taking study medication) for any reason, you will be 
asked to sign a form indicating whether you give your permission for your doctor and the research staff to 
continue to collect and submit follow-up information on your health status from your physicians and 
medical record. After signing the form, you still have the right to change your mind, at any time, regarding follow- up after withdrawal.  
 
If you decide to quit the study please tell your site Principal Investigator, <Insert Name>,  MD at <Insert 
phone number.> 
 
Medical Treatment/Payment in Case of Injury  
A research injury is any physical or mental injury or illness caused by being in the study. If you are 
injured by a medical treatment or procedure you would have received even if you were not in the study that is not a research injury. To help avoid research injury and added medical expenses, it is very important to follow all study directions carefully. If you do experience a research injury, <insert

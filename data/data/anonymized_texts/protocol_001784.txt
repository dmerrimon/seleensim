Section 2.0Study SummaryAdded exclusion criterion for any 
subjects with suspected or known 
COVID -19 infection. To include this exclusion, related to 
the COVID -19 pandemic situation.
Section 7.3Excluded Medications Added OATP1B1/1B3 inhibitors 
and otilonium bromide/Spasmomen 
to excluded medications .A recently complete d OATP (drug -
drug interaction ( DDI)study (Study 
TAK -906-1009) suggested that 
coadministration of TAK -906 with a 
single dose of rifampin (OATP1B1 
and 1B3 inhibitor) resulted in high 
exposure of TAK -906,which may 
potentially increase the safety risk (eg, 
adverse events [ AEs], toxicities). Thus, 
the concomitant use of OATP1B1/1B3 
inhibito rs will be excluded.
Added otilonium bromide/Spasmomen 
to the list of excluded medications due 
to its anticholinergic and 
antispasmodic effects.
Section 7.5Criteria for 
Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a 
SubjectRevised Section 7.5Criteria for 
Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a

TAK -906
Title of Protocol: 
A Multicenter, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -
Controlled, Parallel -Group, Phase 2b Study to Evaluate the 
Efficacy and Safety of Twice -Daily  Oral Administration of 
a Peripherally Acting Dopamine Receptor D 2/D3
Antago nist, TAK -906 for the Treatment of Adult Subjects 
With Sy mptomatic Idiopathic or Diabetic GastroparesisIND No.: 125296 EudraCT No.: 
2018 -001275 -21
Study Number: TAK -906-2002 Phase: 2b
Study Design : This is a global multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, phase 2b 
study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of twice daily (BID) oral (PO) capsule administration of a peripherally 
acting dopamine (DA) receptor D 2/D3antago nist, TAK -906, in adult male and female s ubjects aged 18 to 85 years, 
inclusive, with symptomatic idiopathic or diabetic gastroparesis ([IG and DG], respectively). Gastroparesis is a 
disorder of the stomach characterized by delayed gastric emptying, in the absence of mechanical obstruction.
Subje cts will attend the study site for a screening/consent visit (Visit 1, Day -35), when their consent will be 
obtained, and general eligibility to participate in the study will be reviewed. After signing the informed consent 
form, subjects will have a blood sample taken to assess their laboratory values. Subjects will discontinue all 
excluded medications and return to the site 3 to 17 days later to perform a 4 -hour 13C-Spirulina Gastric Emptying 
Breath Test (GEBT) (Visit 2, Day -21). Subjects with confirmed d elayed gastric emptying by an accepted diagnostic 
method that is documented in the subject’s medical records prior to screening do not have to undergo the Visit 2 
GEBT and may skip Visit 2. Subjects who are not taking any medications at the screening visit that require washout 
may attend the clinic for Visit 2 earlier than 2 weeks and only after laboratory results have been reviewed by the 
investigator. An 8 -hour fast is required before the GEBT. Subjects who required the Visit 2 GEBT will then 
complete Vis it 3 (Day -14)within 7 days after the GEBT visit to confirm their eligibility based on the gastric 
empty ing c riteria. Once the subject is confirmed to have delayed gastric emptying, subjects will be instructed on the 
use of an electronic patient reported outcomes tool (ePRO) for collecting the daily symptoms of gastroparesis, daily 
dosing and meal time recordings, and capture of rescue medication use. The instrument used to capture symptom 
data will be the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Societ y Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index -
Daily Diary  (ANMS GCSI -DD) along with a bloating severity scale. Subjects will record their symptoms once daily 
(in the evening) and will return to the clinic approximately 2 weeks later to assess their gastroparesis symptom 
eligibility based on the ANMS GCSI -DD (Visit 4, randomization). Subjects need to be compliant with completing 
the Daily Symptom Diary, defined as ≥80% diary completions, during the 2 -week symptom assessment period. 
Subjects will be randomized 1:1: 1 into 1 of 3 treatment groups: TAK -906 maleate (TAK -906M) 25, and 50 mg 
capsule BID or matching placebo BID, stratified by IG and DG. Medication should be taken 1 dose in the morning 
approximately 1 hour before the first meal of the day and another dose i n the evening approximately 1 hour before 
the main last meal of the day, at a regular dose interval. Subjects will take their first dose of study medication at the 
randomization visit (Day 1) and will take their morning dose in clinic at Visits 5, 6, and 7 . Subjects will complete 
the Daily Symptom Diary daily for 12 weeks and complete visits at Weeks 4 (Visit 5), 8 (Visit 6), and 12 (Visit 7). 
At Day  1 and Weeks 4, 8, and 12/early termination, pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be taken both predose and 
postdose. A safety follow -up phone call will be made approximately 30 days after last dose of study medication.
Subjects who withdraw prematurely will be followed up by the physician for an early termination visit as soon as 
possible and will continue completing the Daily Symptom Diary until this termination visit using the ePRO device. 
Subjects will be contacted for a follow -up safety  call approximately 30 days a fter the last dose of study medication 
to check if any adverse events occurre d during this follow -up period.

Statistical Considerations:
The full analysis set (FAS) will include all subjects who were randomized, received at least 1 dose of study drug, 
have baseline and at least 1 postbaseline value for assessment of efficacy. In the FAS efficacy summaries, subjects 
will be analyzed by the treatment to which they were randomized. 
The safety set will include all subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of double -blind study  
medication. In safety summaries, subjects will b e analyzed according to the treatment they received. If a subject 
receives more than 1 treatment, the actual treatment will be defined as the one that is used most frequently. If the 2 
most common treatments are used with equal frequency, then the randomiz ed treatment will be used as the actual 
treatment.
Primary  Efficacy Analysis: The primary endpoint is the change from baseline to Week 12 in weekly ANMS GCSI -
DD composite score. Analysis will be based on a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) with treatment, 
center, week, subject disease population (DG and IG), and treatment -by-week interaction as fixed effects, baseline 
and baseline score -by-week interaction as covariates, with an unstructured covariance structure if applicable. The 
point -estimates , nominal p -values and confidence intervals (CIs) for the primary analysis will be based on the Week 
12 statistical comparisons between each of the 2 TAK -906 dose groups and placebo, with respect to the primary 
endpoint. The 2 statistical tests for the pri mary  efficacy analysis are 1 -sided and will be conducted using a 5% level 
of significance. Nominal p-values will be evaluated for statistical significance. In addition, point estimates and CIs 
along with descriptive statistics for change from baseline scor es in ANMS GCSI -DD at earlier time points, will be 
presented. The MMRM -based analysis assumes that missing data follow a missing -at-random (MAR) assumption. 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis: The secondary endpoint of proportion of subjects with at least 50% re ductio n from 
baseline in ANMS GCSI -DD composite score will be analyzed at all time points by logistic regression adjusting for 
baseline score, subject disease population and treatment by the last observation carried forward method to handle 
missing data.
Sample Size Justification: 
In order to manage the likelihood of statistical, clinical, and operational success of this study in the setting of the 
COVID -19 pandemic, the sample -size considerations are revisited in Protocol Amendment 8 . The statistical testing 
is revised from 2 -sided (with a significance level of 5%) to 1 -sided (with a significance level of 5%), the planned 
sample size is reduced by 10 subjects per arm and randomization into the 5 mg dose arm is to be discontinued. 
Thesample -size rationale for the resultant reduced sample size and updated 1 -sided statistical testing is as follows: 
Assuming a SD of 1.25 anda true difference of 0.625 between TAK -906M active dose and placebo in the change 
from baseline in the ANMS GCSI -DD composite score, and a 15% dropout rate, a total of 205 subjects is sufficient 
to achieve approximately 80% power to detect the treatment effect of 0.625 at a 1 -sided 5% significance level. The 
total of 205 subjects consists of approximately 25 subjects who have already been randomized to receive 5 mg 
capsule BID prior to terminating randomization of subjects into the 5 mg dose arm ,and 60 subjects per treatment 
groups of placebo, TAK -906M 25 mg, and TAK -906M 50 mg .

gastroparesi s (DG) and i diopathic gastroparesis (IG). A significant unmet medical need for safe 
and effective chronic therapies remains for these patients. Gastroparesis is a disorder of the 
stom ach characteri zed by  delayed gastric empt ying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. It 
is est imated that there is in the range of 5 to 10 millio n gastroparetics (approximately 3% of the 
total popul ation) in the United States (US) [1], with idiopathic (36%), di abetic (29%), 
postsurgical (13%), and Parkinson (7%) etiologies comprising the majorit y of cases in the 
tertiary referral  setting [2]. Symptoms consist of nausea, vo miting, early satiety, abdo minal pain,
and postprandial fullness that are chronic wit h episodi c symptom  exacerbat ion [3]. Gastroparesis 
causes nutrit ional co mpromise, impaired glucose control, and a reduced qualit y of life, 
independent of other factors such as age, tobacco and alcoho l use, or ty pe of diabetes [3]. The 
impact of gastroparesis has a serious outcome on day -to-day functioning i s well -docum ented 
both for the patient’s deteriorating qualit y of life, productivit y, and on the di rect and indirect 
economic burden placed on societ y [4].
Current ly in the US, there ex ists a significant unmet medical need because there are no approved 
therapi es for the chroni c treatm ent of DG. Validated targets for gastroparesis are the dopamine 
(DA) receptors D 2and D 3. The D 2receptor antagonist metoclopramide is indicated for the sho rt-
term treatm ent of acute and recurrent DG and has been limit ed in dose and duration of treatment 
because of well -docum ented toxi cities, the m ost notabl e of which are extrapy ramidal  symptoms 
(EPS) [5]. EPS are caused by th e blockade of  the D 2receptor in the dorsal striatum and thus are

potential side effects of all centrally-acting drugs that sharethis mechanism of action, including 
D2receptor antagonists. Of greatest concern is tardive dyskinesia, a severe and often irreversible 
EPS. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia increases with dose level and duration of 
treatment (total cumulative dose), and conse quently, the US package insert for metoclopramide 
includes a black box warning regarding the chronic use of metoclopramide for longer than 
12weeks [6].
Domperidone is a peripherally-acting DA receptor D 2/D3antagonist marketed for use as an 
antiemetic and prokinetic agent in a number of countries worldwide, although not in the US 
because of its cardiovascular safety profile, which includes a risk for drug-induced QT 
prolongation, t orsades de pointes, and sudden cardiac death [7]. DA receptor antagonists are 
effective in the treatment of delayed gastric emptying and gastroparesis symptoms because of the 
role of DA receptors D 2and D3in the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract and in the area postrema, 
which controls vomiting [8-10].Both of these areas are outside of the blood brain barrier. 
Therefore, a peripherally-selective D 2/D3antagonist could achieve the desired efficacy without 
the undesired central nervous system (CNS) effects such as EPS [11,12].
TAK-906 is a peripherally acting (ie, limited penetration of the blood brain barrier) DA receptor 
D2/D3antagonist. 
4.2 Nonclinical Information4.2.1 Nonclin ical Pharmacology
In vitro studies of receptor binding affinity a nd activity and in vivo studies of pharmacodynamic 
effects on prolactin secretion in rats and apom orphine-induced emesis in dogs have demonstrated 
primary pharmacologic actions of TAK-906 c onsistent with D2/D3antagonism. Overall, 
TAK906 is expected to be e ffective in the treatment of gastroparesis, based on nonclinical 
pharmacology data demonstrating D2/D3 antagonism  with a potency comparable to or greater 
than domperidone and metoclopramide. 
4.2.2 Safety Pharmacology
A series of safety pharmacology studies evaluated TAK-906 as outlined inInternational 
Conference on Harmonisation(ICH)S7A, including assessments of cardiovascular safety, CNS 
safety, and respiratory safety. TAK-906 weak ly blocked human ether-à-go-go–related gene
(hERG)potassium channel current ( 50% inhibitory concentration [IC
50] = 15.6 μM). In a dog 
cardiovascular safety pharmacology study, small decreases in systolic and pulse pressure were 
observed at ≥10 mg/kg with a compensatory increase in heart rate with associated lower QT and 
PR interval electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters observed at 30 mg/kg. There were no changes 
in corrected QT interval (QTc). Changes in lo comotor activity (rearing, basic, and fine 
movement) were observed at ≥100mg/kg in the repeat-dose 28-day rat study, but TAK-906 was 
not associated with any other biologically signif icant changes in CNS or respiratory parameters. Property of Takeda: For Non-Commercial Use Only and Subject to the Applicable Terms of Usede de

4.2.3 Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism
Absorpti on, di stributi on, metabolism , excreti on, and pharmacokineti c (PK)properties of TAK -
906 and [14C]TAK -906 were evaluated using in vit ro or in vivo assays. Using the maleate form 
intended for the clinic, studies in rats and dogs demo nstrated that TAK -906 i s absorbed 
following PO administration. The abso lute bioavail ability (BA) of TAK -906 was approximately 
19% in rats fo llowing PO gavage administration, and up to 18% in dogs fo llowing PO capsule 
administration. At pharmaco logically relevant PO doses, time of first occurrence of maximum 
observed plasm concentration (t max) was 20 to 30 minutes. TAK -906 administered PO shows a 
somewhat greater than proportional increase in TAK- 906 exposure with dose across the wide 
range of doses studied; 3 to 1000 mg/kg in rats and 1 to 500 mg/kg in dogs. Exposure in female 
animals was generally greater than that in males but usually by less than 2 -fold. Accumulat ion 
was not observed with repeated dosing. An in vitro permeabilit y study  of [14C]TAK -906 using 
human co lonic adenocarcino ma(Caco -2)cells showed that TAK -906 has m oderate perm eabili ty. 
[14C]TAK -
906-derived radioactivit y distributed widely into tissues, and almost completely  
eliminated fro m them by 72 hours after a single PO dose to albino rats; in pigmented rats, 
[14C]TAK -
906-derived radioactivit y had litt le affinit y for melanin. Pl asma protein binding of 
TAK -906 in m ouse, rat, dog, and human plasma was ≥90% and mainly to human serum albumin 
(HSA) . Penetrati on of  TAK -906 into the brain is minimal as demonstrated by  
plasma -to-cerebrospinal fluid(CSF) level comparisons in rats an d dogs using the PO route of 
administration, and by plasma to whole brain level comparisons in mice using the intraperitoneal 
(IP)route of administration.
In vitro, using hepatocy tes from humans, rats, and dogs, TAK -906 is m etabo lized to a ketone 
reducti on m etabo lite (M23) and unident ified metabo lites. No uni que human metabo lites are 
observed. TAK -906 is m ainly metabolized by a non -cytochrome P
-450 ( CYP )pathway and via 
CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5. In vitro investigations demo nstrated that format ion of M23 occurred in 
human liver cy tosol  and not in CYP -expressing liver microsomes. Therefore, M23 is likely 
formed by  a cy tosolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) -dependent 
reductase like aldo-keto ( AKR )and/or short -chain dehydrogenase ( SDR )rather than by CYP. A 
metabo lic stabilit y study  with TAK -906 in human liver S9 with or without a pan CYP inhibitor 
(ABT), indicated the relat ive contribution of CYP and non-CYP toward in vitro metabo lism o f 
TAK -906 was 43.3% and 56.7%, respectively. In vi vo m etabolic profiling of plasma and excreta 
from rats and dogs indicated the presence of TAK- 906, M23, N-dealkylated m etabo lite (M28), 
and unident ified metabo lites. TAK -906 was the major component in rat and dog plasma. In 
fasted rats, the excret ion of ra dioactivi ty was largely  via feces. Biliary  excret ion was the major 
excretory  route for TAK -906 and related substances in bile duct- cannulated rats. Similarly, in 
fasted dogs, urinary  and fecal  excretion were 8.0% and 91.3%, respectively , over 96 hours.
TAK -906 showed little potential to inhibit or induce CYP. TAK -906 i s a substrate of P -
glycoprotein (Pgp), OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, but not breast cancer resistance protein , organic 
anion transporter 1/3, organi c cat ion transporter 2, multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 1, 
and multidrug and toxin extrusion transporter 2-K. In vitro invest igations using human 
hepatocy tes and OATP1B1/1B3
-expressing cells demonstrated that uptake of [14C]TAK -906 into

human hepatocy tes is primarily  mediated by OATP1B1. TAK -906 i sunlikely  to inhibit 
transporter proteins at clinically relevant concentrations.
4.2.4 Toxicology
The safet y of TAK -906 was tested in range -finding and pivotal repeat -dose toxicit y studi es up to 
13 weeks in duration in rats and dogs with once daily  oral administ ration. Rat and dog repeat 
dose studies with twice daily  dosing (BID) up to 28 -days were com pleted to be consistent with 
the BID clinical dose regimen and to guide dose select ion for 6-month rat and 9- month dog BID 
studi es. A full  battery  of genotoxi city assays (in vitro Am es and chrom osom e aberrati on and in 
vivo rat micronucleus assays), embry o-fetal devel opment studi es in rats and rabbits, a fert ility 
and early  embry onic devel opment study  in rats, and a phototoxicit y study  in rats were also 
conducted. Mou se repeat dose BID studies were conducted to guide dose select ion for a 6-month 
transgenic mouse carcinogenicit y study .
Dose -limit ing toxicit y was seen in the form of tremors and weight loss in dogs treated with 
TAK -906 at ≥250 mg/kg for up to 4 day s. At l ower repeated doses (<100 mg/kg/day) , slight 
tremor and the presence of expected class- related pharmacol ogical effects, including signs 
associ ated wi th mild sedat ion, were observed in dogs.
In the pivotal 13 -week repeat -dose toxicit y study  in rats wi th TAK-906 administered once daily  
(QD) by  PO gavage, the no-observed -adverse -event l evel (NOAEL )was 1000 mg/kg/day. Target 
organ effects in male and female mammary t issue, mucificat ion in the cervix and vagina, and 
corpus l uteum  hypertrophy  in the ovary  were associated with hyperprolact inemia, which is a 
known indicator for target engagement for this drug class and may result in reproductive changes 
consistent with hyperprolactinemia (ie, amenorrhea, infertilit y in females, gyneco mast ia in 
males). 
In the pivo tal 13-week repeat -dose toxicit y study  in dogs wi th TAK -906 administered QD PO by  
capsule, the NOAEL was 50 mg/kg/day, at which CNS -associ ated pharmacol ogical effects 
typical of this pharmaco logic class occurred at 50 mg/kg/day , including decreased act ivity, 
tremors, incoordinat ion (ataxia), decreased muscle tone (drooping eye lids), partly  closed eyes 
(squint ing), and protruding nictitating membrane (periocular swelling). Based on the overall 
nonclinical safet y profile, the dog is considered the more sensi tive species.
In 28 -day repeat dose toxi city studi es wi th TAK -906 in both rats and dogs, NOAELs were lower 
with BID versus QD administration. The 28 -day rat BID NOAEL was determined to be 
150mg/kg BID (300 mg/kg/day), as doses of 500 mg/kg BID (1000 mg/k g/day) were not 
tolerated and adverse liver findings (hepatocellular vacuo lation with occasi onal inflammat ion) 
were noted at 375 mg/kg BID (750 mg/kg/day). The 28- day female dog BID NOAEL was 
determined to be 10 mg/kg BID (20 mg/kg/day) due to adverse prol actin-related m ammary  gland 
inflammat ion and fibrosis at 30 mg/kg BID (60 mg/kg/day ).
TAK -906 was nongenotoxic in in vitro mutagenicity  and chro mosomal aberrati on assays or in an 
in vivo micronucleus assay  in rats at a limit dose of 1000 mg/kg BID (2000 mg /kg/day  total  
dose) administered by  PO gavage . TAK -906 was negative for cutaneous and ocular phototoxicit y 
in pigmented rats at doses up to 500 mg/kg BID (1000 mg/kg/day).

In the pivotal rat embryo -fetal devel opment study  at QD doses of 30, 100, and 300 mg/kg/day , 
TAK -906- related clinical observations of squint ing ey es, clear ocul ar discharge, hypoactivit y, 
and dilated vagina were observed at 300 mg/kg/day . TAK -906 di d not cause fetal toxicit y or 
developmental effects at any  dose l evel. The m aternal and fet al NOAELs were 100 m g/kg/day  
and 300 mg/kg/day, respectively . In the pivotal  rabbi t embry o
-fetal devel opment study  at doses 
of 50, 150, and 500 mg/kg BID (100, 300, and 1000 mg/kg/day), TAK -906 di d not resul t in 
maternal toxicit y, fetal  toxicity, or devel opmental  effects at any  dose l evel. Based on a lack of 
adverse effects, the rabbit maternal and fetal NOAEL was 500 mg/kg BID (1000 mg/kg/day). In 
the pivotal rat fertilit y and early embryo nic develo pment study  at doses of 50, 150, and 
325mg/kg BID (100, 3 00, and 650 mg/kg/day) in males and females, TAK -906 was associated 
with effects on gross necropsy  findings and/or organ weights in the prostate, uterus, and ovary , 
reproducti ve perform ance, and intrauterine parameters at ≥100 mg/kg/day. The NOAEL for 
fema le reproductive toxicit y and early embry onic toxi city coul d not be determined because all 
doses were considered adverse. The effects on reproduction performance in males were 
considered secondary  to the effects noted for the females. The NOAELs for systemic toxicit y 
were 300 mg/kg/day and 650 mg/kg/day for males and females, respect ively.
4.3 Human Experience
4.3.1 Clinical Pharmacology
To date, 6 clinical studies wit h TAK -906 m aleate (TAK -906M) capsule have been completed, 
and 1 clinical study  is ongoing in s ubjects wi th DG and IG.
Study  AT-01C consisted of 2 phases: a single ascending dose phase and a mult iple ascending 
dose phase. In general, PO administration o f single (5 to 300 mg) or mult iple (50 or 100 mg BID 
over 5 day s) doses of TAK -906M was safe and w ell tolerated in healt hy male and female 
subjects.
TAK -906 showed a rapid absorption (median plasma TAK -906 t maxacross both single and 
multiple PO doses of TAK -906M across all cohorts was approximately  1.1 hours) and a rapi d 
eliminat ion over 24 hours (mea n plasma TAK -906 terminal disposit ion phase half -life was 
approximately  4.0 hours across all cohorts in the single ascending dose phase and was 11.0 and 
6.2 hours at the 50 and 100 mg BID doses, respectively, on Day  5 in the m ultiple ascending dose 
phase). Food significant ly reduced exposure to TAK -906M 25 mg; maximum observed 
concentration (C max) and area under the concentration -time curve (AUC) in fed subjects were 
approximately  40% l ower com pared wi th the same subjects when fast ing. Wit h single PO doses 
of TAK -906M between 5 and 300 mg, TAK -906 exposure increased in a manner proportional to 
dose increment. With BID dosing o f 50 and 100 mg TAK -906M for 5 days, accumulat ion was 
minor. Addit ionally, TAK -906 PK profiles were generally  similar between Japanese men 
(TAK -906- 1004) and non -Japanese healthy men and women (Study  AT -01C).
M23, the major and pharmaco logically  inactive m etaboli te identified in rat and dog plasma, 
represented approximately  11% of  the TAK -906 (parent) AUC. Following PO administration of
TAK -906, approximately 1.5% of the administered dose was excreted as unchanged TAK -906 in 
the urine of humans. Based on preliminary populatio n PK analysis (ut ilizing data from first in

human AT-01C and TAK -906-1002) , estimated glomerular filtrat ion rate ( eGFR) had no 
significant effect on exposure of TAK -906 in healt hy subjects or DG and IG subjects.
Coadministration of itraconazo le (potent inhibitor of CYP3A4 and Pgp) with TAK -906 increased 
geom etric mean C maxby approximately  1.98 -fold and area under the concentration -time curve 
from time 0 to infinit y of TAK -906 by  approximately 1.28 -fold (TAK -906- 1003). AUC ∞and 
Cmaxof TAK -906 decreased approximately  12% to 13% when coadministered with 40 mg 
esomeprazo le compared to 25 mg TAK -906 administration alone i n healt hy subjects 
(TAK -
906-1006).
Coadministration of a single intravenous ( IV)infusion of 600 mg rifampin (a prototypic inhibitor 
of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3) with a single oral dose of 25 mg TAK -906 increased the mean area 
under the concentration
-time curve from time 0 to infinit y (AUC ∞), and C maxbyapproximately 
5.2 and 6.2 -fold (TAK -906- 1009). 
The pr olactin increase fo llowing PO administration of single doses of TAK -906M, which was 
substant ia
l compared wi th placebo, was rapi d and short -lived. Serum prolactin concentrati on di d 
not increase in a dose -proporti onal manner. There was litt le if any accumulati on in serum  
prolactin concentration wit h BID dosing for 5 day s.
The concentration QT interval wit h Fridericia correction method (QTcF) analysis o f data from 
Study  AT-01C was perform ed using linear mixed effects modeling methods. The analysis 
demonstrated that TAK -906M in single doses from 5 to 300 mg, which resulted in plasma 
concentrations of up to 171 ng/mL, did not have a clinically meaningful effect (<10 msec) on the 
placebo -adjusted change from baseline in QTcF (at relevant concentration range <200 ng/mL).
In summary, given the efficacy associated with D 2antagonist drugs and the nonclinical and 
phase 1 clinical observat ions, TAK -906 m ay be a promis ing new therapeutic for the treatment of 
gastroparesi s.

4.4 Rationale for the Proposed Study
The prevalence of gastroparesis in the US is 24.2 per 100,000 [1]. The m ost comm on causes of 
gastroparesi sin these countries are idiopathic (~36%) and diabetes (~29%). Domperidone and 
metocl opramide are D 2antagonists, which have been shown to reduce symptoms associated with 
gastroparesi sbut are associ ated wi th serious cardi ovascular (dom peridone) and CNS 
(metocl opramide) side effects. There is, therefore, a significant unmet need for a safe and 
efficacious chronic treatment of gastroparesis in patients. TAK -906 is a per ipherally act ing 
D2/D3antagonist with minimal known CNS penetration and cardiac effects, likely attributable to 
structural  difference or chemoty pe difference fro m metoclopramide and domperidone. In phase 1 
studi es in heal thy volunteers, TAK -906 dem onstrated suitable PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) 
properties without the CNS liabilit ies of metoclopramide or cardiac liabilit ies associated with 
domperidone. Given the posit ive on -target effects and good tolerabilit y, TAK -906 is being 
developed for use in patients with gastroparesis .

TAK -906-2002 is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
phase 2b study  to eval uate the efficacy  and safet y of BID PO administration of TAK -906M 
capsules in adult male and female subjects aged 18 to 8 5 years inclusive, with symptomatic IG or 
DG. 
Pharmacogeno mic (PGx) analysis may be conducted to evaluate the contribut ion of genet ic 
variance and/or gene expressio n on drug response, for example, its efficacy and safet y. 
Parti cipation of  study  subjects i n PGx sample collection is optional.
As PGx is an evo lving science, currently many genes and their funct ion are not y et fully 
understood. Future data may suggest a role o f some of these genes in drug response or disease, 
which may  lead to addi tional hypothesis -generating exploratory  research on sto red samples.
4.5 Benefit/Risk Profile 
Gastroparesis causes nutrit ional compromise, impaired glucose control, and a reduced qualit y of 
life, independent of other factors such as age, tobacco and alcoho l use, or ty pe of diabetes [4]. 
The serious negative impact of gastroparesis on day
-to-day functioning is well- documented both 
for the patient’s deteriorating qualit y of life, productivit y and on the di rect and indirect eco nomic 
burden placed on societ y.
DA receptors D 2and D 3have been shown to be validated targets for gastroparesis since D 2
receptors are known to be invo lved in the control of nausea and vo miting, and D 3receptors pl ay 
a role in gastric m otilit y [8-10] . Blocking D 2receptors is associated with a reduction in nausea 
and vo miting and blocking D 3receptors i s associ ated wi th an increase in gastric motilit y [8-10] .
However, DA receptor D 2/D3antagonist domperidone’s
safet y profile includes a risk for 
drug-induced QT prolongat ion, cardi ac arrhy thmia, and death [7], and DA receptor D 2antagonist 
metocl opramide’s neurological safet y profile includes increased risk of  adverse events (AEs) 
related to EPS and the potential for tardive dyskinesia . In addi tion, DA receptor D2/D3
antagonists elevate serum  prolactin levels, w hich may lead to AEs related to reproductive 
endocrino logy such as infert ility, galactorrhea, amenorrhea, gyneco mastia, and impotence in 
some subjects.
Consequent ly, there current ly exists a significant unmet medical need because there are no 
approved ther apies for the chronic treatment of DG or IG.
TAK -906 i s a peri pherally  acting DA receptor D 2/D3antagonist with a high safet y margin 
between in vitro hERG channel inhibit ion and projected efficacious clinical exposures; no effects 
in dog ECG parameters in nonclinical safety studies, no clinically significant cardiovascular AEs 
in the phase 1 healt hy subject study  or in the drug -drug interaction studies were observed. 
Therefore, treatment with TAK -906 is not expected to result in the adverse effects associat ed 
with cardi otoxi city especially the QT prolongat ion observed with do mper idone. EPS side effects 
such as tardive dyskinesia, acute dy stoni a and Parkinson -like symptom s have been reported with 
the use of metoclopramide. However, TAK -906 i s a peri pherally a cting DA receptor D 2/D3
antagonist with limited CNS penetration expected. As such, the risk of CNS and extrapyramidal 
system  effects are ant icipated to be low. Hy perprolactinemia and prolact in related symptoms are

expected of all D 2receptor antagonists such as domperidone, metoclopramide and neuroleptics. 
However, given the relat ively short (12 weeks) duration of the study , this ri sk is considered 
manageable and risk mit igation measures have been included in this study  to ensure safet y of 
subjects who may devel op hyperprol actinemia or prolact in related symptoms.
Therefore, given the significant unmet medical need and the expected reduced cardiovascular 
and CNS safet y risk and manageabilit y of risk of hyperprolact inemia /prolactin related symptoms
compared wi th other drugs in the cl ass, the benefit -risk profile is thought to be favorable for the 
use of clinically effective doses of TAK -906 in DG/IG subjects.

STUDY DESIGN AND DES CRIPTION 6.0
6.1 Study Design
This is a global mult icenter, randomized, double- blind, placebo -controlled, parallel- group, phase 
2b study  to eval uate the efficacy and safet y of BID PO capsul e administrati on of  a peri pherally  
acting DA receptor D 2/D3antagonist, TAK -906, in adul t male and female subjects aged 18 to 
85years, inclusive, with symptomat ic IG or DG. Gastroparesis is a disorder of the stomach 
characterized by delayed gastric emptying, in the absence of mechanical obstruction.
The study  is designed to characterize the dose -response relat ionship to support dose selection for 
evaluat ion of subjects to be enrolled in the planned phase 3 studies. 
Subjects will attend the study  site for a screening/consent visit (Visit 1, Day  -35), when their 
consent will be obtained, and general eligibilit y to parti cipate in the study  will be reviewed. After 
signing the informed consent form, subjects will have a blood sample taken to assess their 
laboratory  values. Subjects will discont inue all excluded medicat ions and return to the site 3 to 
17 day s later to perform a 4 -hour 13C-Spirulina GEBT (Vi sit2, Day  -21). Subjects who have 
confirmat ion of delayed gastric empt ying confirmed by an accepted diagnostic testing method 
(ie, scint igraphy, GEBT, or wireless mot ility capsule) that is documented in the subject’s medical 
records prior to screening, are not required to undergo the Visit 2 GEBT, and may proceed 
directly to Visit 3 for instruction on use of the electronic patient reported outcomes tool. Subjects 
who are not taking any medicat ions at the screening visit that req uire washout may attend the 
clinic for Visit 2 earlier than 2 weeks and only after laboratory  resul ts have been reviewed by the 
investigator. An 8 -hour fast i s requi red before the GEBT. Subj ects will then complete Visit 3 
(Day  -14) wi thin 7 days after the GEBT visit to confirm their eligibilit y based on the gastric 
emptying criteria. At Visit 3, subjects confirmed to have delayed gastric empt ying will be 
instructed on the use of an electronic pati ent reported outcomes tool (ePRO) for collect ing the 
daily symptoms of gastroparesis, daily dosing and meal time recordings, and capture of rescue

medicat ion use . The instrum ent used to capture symptom data will be the ANMS GCSI- DD 
along wi th a bloating se verity scale. Subjects will record their symptoms once daily (in the 
evening) and will return to the clinic approximately 2 weeks later to assess their gastroparesis
symptom  eligibilit y based on the ANMS GCSI -DD (Visit 4, randomizat ion). Subjects need to b e 
compliant wi th com pleting the Daily Symptom Diary ,defined as ≥80% di ary com pletions, 
during the 2 -week symptom assessme nt period.
Subjects will be rando mized 1:1:1 into 1 of 3 treatment groups: TAK -906 m aleate (TAK -906M) 
25, and 50 mg capsule BID or ma tching pl acebo BI D, stratified by IG and DG. Medicat ion 
shoul d be taken 1 dose in the morning approximately 1 hour before the first meal of the day and 
another dose in the evening approximately 1 hour before the main last meal of the day, at a 
regul ar dose interval. Subjects will take their first dose of study  medicat ion at the rando mizat ion 
visit (Day  1)and will take their morning dose in clinic at Visit s 5, 6, and 7. Subjects will 
complete the Daily Symptom Diary  daily for 12 weeks and attend the clinic at Weeks 4 (Vi sit 5), 
8 (Visit 6), and 12 (Visit 7). At Day 1 and Weeks 4, 8, and 12/early termination, PK samples will 
be taken both predose and postdose. A safety fo llow-up phone call will be made approximately 
30 day s after l ast dose of study  medicat ion.
Subjects who withdraw prematurely will be seen by the physician for an early terminat ion visit 
as soon as possible and will continue complet ing the Daily Symptom Diary until this terminat ion 
visit using the ePRO device. They will then be contacted for a follow-up safet y call 
approximately  30 days after the last dose of study  medicat ion to check if any AEs occurred 
during thi s follow-up peri od.

6.2 Justification for Study Design, Dose, and Endpoints
6.2.1 Rationale for Study Design
This is a global, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, pl acebo -controlled, parallel -group, phase 
2b study  to eval uate the efficacy and safet y of BID PO administrati on of  a peri pherally  acting 
DA receptor D 2/D3antagonist, TAK -906 in adult male and female subjects aged 18 to 85 years 
inclusive, with symptomat ic IG or DG. Subjects will be eligible for enrollment if they have a 
body  mass index (BMI) ≥18 to ≤40 kg/m2and a minimum o f 3-month history  of symptom s 
consistent with gastroparesis as assessed by a physician (eg, post prandial fullness, nausea, 
vomiting, upper abdominal pain, and early sat iety [at least intermittent ly]). Subjects need to be 
compliant wi th com pleting the Daily Symptom Diary, defined as ≥80% di ary com pletions during 
the 2-week symptom assessment period (+ 3-day window). Subjects without previous 
confirmat ion of delayed gastric empt ying prior to screening will undergo a GEBT after they have 
stopped taking prohibited medicat ions. 
Subjects who have a history  of gastroparesis symptoms and confirmed slow gastri c em ptying 
meet ing entry criteria will be instructed on the use of an ePRO tool to record their baseline 
symptoms. They  must have an average co mposite ANMS GCSI -DD symptom score ≥2 during 
the last week of the screening period. The predominant symptom exper ienced by subjects must 
not be abdo minal pain and subjects must also experience nausea: nausea subscale (of ANMS 
GCSI -DD) symptom score ≥2at least 4 of 7days or an average nausea subscale symptom score 
≥2 during the last week of the screening period. Nau sea symptom s shoul d not be attributable to a 
central  disorder.
Subjects with diabetes must qualify by having diabetes mellitus wit h glycosylated hemoglobin 
(HbA1c) ≤11% at screening, before rando mizat ion.
The comprehensive inclusio n criteria outlined with thefocus on delayed gastric empt ying, 
history  of gastroparesis symptoms, and moderate -to-severe gastroparesis symptoms at baseline, 
before receiving study  drug, will ensure the enrollment of an appropriate populat ion of subjects 
with moderate -to-severe sy mptom atic gastroparesis most likely to respond to and benefit fro m 
treatm ent wi th TAK -
906.
The study  will be randomized, doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled, parallel -group enrollment with 
3 treatment arms (2 active doses and plac ebo) to characteri ze the dose -response relat ionship for 
TAK -906. The use of rando mizat ion and blinding will remo ve bias on allocating subjects to 
treatm ent arm s and on treatm ent outcomes. There will be a screening period of up to 5 weeks, 
during which gast ric motility and gastroparesis symptom s will be assessed. The run -in period is 
of sufficient duration to allow subjects to stop taking their prescribed GI motilit y drugs before 
measuring their GI motilit y using the GEBT, where required. It will also allow subjects to 
beco me proficient at using the ePRO device and providing sufficient and accurate baseline 
symptom  data to assess their suitabilit y for randomizat ion. Subjects will then be treated for 
12 weeks during which time their symptoms will be recorded d aily. A 12 -week treatm ent peri od 
has been selected for this study as this is a sufficient duration to allow for the drug to take effect 
and for the collect ion of symptom data to evaluate efficacy  and for the collect ion of safet y data.

The study  will also be used to perform final validatio n of the ePRO tool (Daily Symptom Diary ) 
[13] for use in the phase 3 studies. 
Overall, the design of the study , incl uding the use of randomizat ion, blinding, size, duration, 
subject populat ion, and endpo ints will provide good qualit y efficacy  and safet y data in a safe 
study  environment to show if there is a treatment effect of study  drug.
6.2.2 Rationale for Dose
This study  was ori ginally  designed wi th 3 active treatm ent doses that were chosen based on the 
data in healthy subjects fro m the phase 1 Study  AT
-01C. The TAK -906 5 , 25, and 50 mg BID 
doses are expected to maximize therapeutic effect and minimize potential safet y and tol erabilit y 
concerns. Under Protocol Amendment 8, randomization into the 5 mg dose arm has been 
discontinued. Rando mizat ion into the 5 mg dose arm was halted to improve operational 
feasibilit y in the setting of the COVID -19 pandemic and to reduce the number of subjects being 
exposed to a potentially minimally efficacious dose that likely approaches the lower end of the 
dose response curve .This change wa s not necessit ated by  safet y findings. Several drug -related 
param eters were evaluated for dose -selection including safet y, tolerabilit y, PK, and PD. In 
general, oral administration of single (5 to 300 mg) or mult iple (50 or 100 mg BID over 5 days) 
doses of TAK -906 was well tol erated in heal thy mal e and female subjects. Prolactin has been 
used as a measure of target engagement. At a TAK- 906 plasma concentration of approximately 
20ng/mL (~C maxof 50 m g dose), the TAK -906–prol actin concentration relat ionship reached 
near maximum, and wit hout clinically meaningful adverse effects. TAK
-906 pl asma 
concentration of approximately 2 ng/mL (~C maxof 5 m g dose) i s expected to be the minimum 
effect ive concentration. The 25 mg dose is between the estimated minimum and m aximum  effect 
concentration and is expected to be a safe and efficacious dose. The 10 -fold window in PK 
exposure (2 ng/mL to 20 ng/mL) will permit adequate characterizat ion of the exposure/response 
relationships for TAK -906. 
6.2.3 Rationale for Placebo
Current ly in the US, there are no approved therapies for the chronic treatment of DG. 
Metocl opramide is indicated for the short- term treatm ent of  acute and recurrent DG and has been 
limited in dose and duration of treatment by well -docum ented toxi cities, the m ost notable of 
which are a category  of movement di sorders known as EPS, including tardive dyskinesia, a 
severe and often irreversible EPS [5]. The risk of developing tardive dyskinesia increases with 
dose l evel and durati on of  treatm ent and as such, the US package insert includes a black box 
warning regarding the chronic use of metoclopramide for longer than 12 weeks.
Dom peridone is a DA receptor D 2/D3antagonist marketed for use as an antiemet ic and prokinet ic 
agent in a number of countries worldwide, although not in the US because o f its cardi ovascular 
safet y profile, which includes a risk for drug -induced long QT syndrome, torsades de pointes, 
and su dden cardiac death [
7].
Erythromycin is a macrolide ant ibiotic with prokinetic properties. In addit ion to the risk of 
developing ant imicrobial resistances, tachyphylaxis develops in pat ients receiving chronic

erythromycin therapy , due to down -regulat ion of mot ilin receptors, which can develop as early 
as a few days of init iating therapy [14].
Therefore, because of safet y concerns associated wit h the above treatments and the fact that this 
will be a glo bal study  including the US, there is no suitable act ive comparator that can be used in 
a clinical study  of 12 weeks durati on. 
There i s often a s ignificant treatment response to placebo in patients with functional GI disease 
including gastroparesis and this has been observed in clinical trials using experimental GI 
motility compounds such as relamorelin [15]. It is therefore important to take this potenti al for a 
placebo effect into account by  having a pl
acebo treatm ent arm  when designing the study  to show 
that there is a posit ive treatment effect over placebo and not just from baseline to the end of the 
study .
The study  is therefore pl acebo -controlled as the choice of co mpet itors is severely limited by 
potenti al side effects (m etocl oprami de, dom peridone) or tachyphylaxis (ery thromycin) and to 
observe any potential for a placebo response in the study  popul ation.
During screening, there will be no restrict ions on the use of rescue medicat ion until Visit 3 
(Day -14).After Vi sit 3, the use of rescue medicat ion will be limited to 2 doses per day  for up to 
3 day s per week only  when subjects experience nausea and/or vomit ing (oral intake decreased 
without si gnificant wei ght loss, dehydrat ion or m alnutri tion) of  Comm on Termino logy Cri teria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE) grade 2 or greater. Note that during the randomized treatment 
period, rescue m edicat ion use will be limited to BID for up to 3 day s per we ek. If the subject 
uses rescue medicat ion BID for 3 days per week for 2 consecutive weeks, the subject will be 
discontinued fro m the study  due to l ack of  efficacy. All types and doses of 
antinausea/ant ivomiting rescue medicat ion will be documented and the rescue m edicati on will  be 
provi ded by the subject’s treating physician. 
Antinausea/ant ivomiting rescue medicat ion is recommended for use as nausea and vo miting are 
likely  to be the m ost debilitating and comm only reported symptoms in the gastroparesis 
popu lation [2,16,17] . The preferred rescue medicatio n is ondansetron 4 mg given orally. 
Alternat ively, ant iemetics such as diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, or others 
may be provided based on local guidelines and principal invest igator (PI) and subject preference. 
All types and doses of ant inausea/ant ivomiting rescu e medicat ion prescript ion will  be 
docum ented and the rescue medication will be provided by  the subject’s study  invest igator.
6.2.4 Rationale for Endpoints
Gastroparesis is a disorder of the stomach characterized by delayed gastric empt ying in the 
absence of mechanical obstruction and is associated with symptoms consist ing of nausea, 
vomiting, early satiety , abdominal pain, and postprandial fullness that are chronic with episodic 
symptom  exacerbat ion [
14]. The core signs and symptom sof gastroparesis, reported by  
incidence, are nausea (92% to 96%), vomit ing (68% to 88%), postprandial fullness (54% to 
77%), early sat iety (42% to 86%), and upper abdominal pain (36% to 85%) [
2,16,17] . Given that 
gastroparesi s is a symptomat ic disease, it is important to assess improvement in symptoms as a 
clinical outcome. Symptom data will be used for the primary endpoint in the study  which is

change from baseline to Week 12 of the treatment period in the ANMS GCSI -DD Com posite 
Score (nausea, early sat iety, upper abdominal pain, and postprandial fullness). Symptom data 
will be captured each evening using the Daily Symptom Diary on an ePRO device.
As part of the Daily Symptom Diary , the ANMS G CSI-DD has been selected for use in this 
study  as it is current ly under development to measure symptoms to evaluate potential new 
treatm ents in DG and IG clinical trials. The ANMS GCSI -DD was based on the original 
Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index (GCSI ) [18,19], which is the most frequently used 
symptom  severi ty measure in gastroparesis clinical trials and other clinical studies [16,20-27] , 
including the National Institutes of Healt h Gastroparesis Clinical Research Consortium 
Gastroparesis Registry  study  [
28,29] . 
Efficacy will be based on a significant difference between group means. The primary  endpoint 
will be between group differences on the ANMS CGSI
-DDcomposite score of nausea, upper 
abdo minal pain, early satiety, and postp randial fullness. Furthermore, item level responses will 
be evaluated as secondary  endpoints to determine which symptom item(s) are driving changes in 
the overall co mposite score, and to evaluate if any symptoms within the co mposite score are 
worsening. Of note, bloating will also be recorded using the electronic diary alo ng wit h the other 
symptoms routinely  captured in the ANMS GCSI -DD (nausea, early sat iety, upper abdominal 
pain, postprandial fullness, vo miting episodes, and overall symptom severit y) for ease of patient 
use. Bl oating is being captured as an addit ional endpoint using the electronic diary  and is 
currently not part of the ANMS GCSI -DD.

Anticholinergic agents (eg, dicyclo mine, hy oscyamine, scopol amine, otilonium 
bromide/Spasmo men).
Dopamine agon ists and antagonists. Promethazine can be used as part of protocol specific 
rescue m edicati on.
Glucagon -like peptide -1 agoni sts (eg, exenatide, liraglutide) and amylin analogues (eg, 
pramlint ide). Note that other medicat ions for the treatment of diabetes a re permitted.
Cannabino id use. 
Medicat ions that prolong QT/corrected QT interval or are at risk of causing Torsades de 
Pointes. Including but not limited to amiodarone, arsenic trioxide, astemizo le, bepridil, 
chloroquine, chlorpromazine, cisapride, clarit hromycin, disopyramide, dofet ilide, 
domperidone, droperido l, erythromycin, halo fantrine, haloperido l, ibutilide, levomethadyl, 
mesori dazine, methadone, m
oxifloxacin, pentami dine, pim ozide, probucol , procainamide, 
quinidine, sotalo l, sparflo xacin, terfenadi ne, thi oridazine, vandetanib. Note that the use of 
ondansetron at a maximal dose of 8 mg twice a day is allowed as part of protocol specific 
rescue m edicati on. 
Medicat ions that can cause EPS or persistent ly ele vate serum prolact in.
Use of antinausea/ant ivomiting rescue medicat ion is permitted for moderate nausea and/or 
vomiting CTCAE Grade 2 (for nausea, oral intake decreased without significant weight loss, 
dehydrat ion or malnutrit ion; for vomiting; outpatient IV hy dration requi red) or hi gher. 
Rescue medi cation use is limited to BID for up to 3 day s per week. If the subject takes this 
dose regimen for 2 consecutive weeks, they  will be discont inued fro m the study  due to l ack 
of efficacy. The prescript ion for rescue medicat ion will be provided by  study  investigator. 
The preferred rescue medicat ion is ondansetron 4 mg given orally . Alternat ively, other 
antiemetics such as diphenhydramine, dimenhydrinate or promethazine may  be provi ded 
based on l ocal guidelines, PI and subject preference. Although there is a ri sk of  dose -related 
prolonged QT with ondansetron and development of EPS symptoms wit h prom ethazine, thi s 
risk is considered low based on the minimal doses being given for a short period of time. 
Permitted concomitant medications
Permitted concomi tant medi cations must be stable for at least 2 weeks leading up to the init ial 
screening/consent visit (Visit 1, Day  -35) and m ust be m aintained at the same doses during the 
study  (daily adjust ments of insulin doses are permitted). Changes to permitted medicat ions 
(eg,laxatives taken as needed) need to be documented.
Subjects m ust be instructed not to take any  medicati ons including over -the-counter or herbal 
products, without first consulting with the investigator. 
The fo llowing m edicat ions are permitted only  in the fo llowing ci rcumstances:
A stable dose of a single ant idepressant for the treatment of depressio n. Note that an 
additional antidepressant can be allo wed if used for another indication such as chronic pain 
or inso mnia.

Subjects will be instructed to take medicat ion 1 dose in the morning approximately 1 hour before 
the first meal o f the day  and another dose in the evening approximately 1 hour before the main 
last m eal of the day , at a regular dose interval. An 8 -hour fast is requi red before the GEBT 
procedure is to be performed. 
There should be no lifest yle changes during the study including no changes to the amount of 
alcoho l, caffeine, and tobacco consumed. The subject must be willing to abstain fro m smoking 
durin g the visit when the GEBT is being performed. Consumption o f alcoho l, caffeine and 
tobacco should not be excessive, per invest igator discretion, for the duration of the study.
Exercise should be moderate and be consistent for the duration of the study.
7.5 Criteria for Discontinuation or Withdrawal of a Subject
The primary  reason for di scont inuat ion or wi thdrawal  of the subject from  the study  or study drug 
shoul d be recorded in the el ectroni c case report form (eCRF) using the fo llowing categori es. For 
screen failure subjects, refer to Section 9.1.16 .

ALT or AST >3×ULN with appearan ce of  fatigue, nausea, vomit ing, ri ght upper quadrant 
pain or tenderness, fever, rash, and/or eosinophilia (>5%).
Important protocol deviat ion. The discovery  postrandomizat ion that the subject failed to meet 3.
protocol  entry  criteria or di d not adhere to pro tocol requirements, and continued participation 
poses an unacceptable risk to the subject’s health , foll owing consul tation wi th the sponsor or 
designee. 
Lost to follow -up. The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact the subject 4.
were u nsuccessful. Attempts to contact the subject must be documented in the subject’s 
source documents. 
Voluntary  withdrawal. The subject (or subject’s legally acceptable representative) wishes to 5.
withdraw from  the study . The reason for wi thdrawal , if provided , must be recorded i n the 
eCRF.
Note: All attempts should be made to determine the underlying reason for the withdrawal 
and, where possible, the primary  underlying reason shoul d be recorded (i e, wi thdrawal  due to 
an AE should not be recorded in the “vo luntary withdrawal” category . Similarly , lack of 
efficacy should not be recorded in the “vo luntary withdrawal” category ).
Study  terminat ion. The sponsor, IRB/IEC or regulatory  agency  terminates the study . 6.

CLINICAL STUDY MATER IAL MANAGEMENT 8.0
8.1 Study Drug and Materials
8.1.1 Dosage Form, Manufacturing, Packaging, and Labeling
In thi s protocol , the term  study  medicat ion refers to all or any  of the drugs defined below.
TAK -906M capsules in strengths of 5, 25, and 50 mg.
Matching placebo capsul es.
The study  drug is TAK -906 m aleate sal t in an immediate -release capsule formulat ion, which 
contains 5, 25, or 50 mg of TAK -906 calculated on the basis of the free base. The 3 strengths of 
capsules have an ident ical appearance in capsule size and co lor. Matching placebo capsules are 
also provi ded.
The study  medicat ion will be packaged in high -densit y polyethylene bottles. E ach bottle contains 
65 TAK -906M capsules for 4 -week dosing plus 9 extra capsules. Each subject will receive 
1bottle at each visit. Th e study  subjects will be instructed to take 1 capsule at each dosing t ime.
Randomization into the 5 mg dose arm  was halted in Protocol Amendment 8 to improve 
operati onal feasibilit y in the setting of the COVID -19 pandemic and to reduce the number of 
subjec ts being exposed to a poten tially minimally efficacious dose that likely approaches the 
lower end of the dose response curve . This change was not necessitated by  safety  findings.
Rescue Medication
During screening, there will be no restrict ions on the use of rescue m edicat ion until Visit 3 
(Day -14).After Vi sit 3, the use of rescue medicat ion will be limited to 2 doses per day for up to 
3 day s per week only  when subjects experience nausea and/or vomit ing (oral intake decreased 
without si gnificant wei ght loss, dehydrat ion or m alnutri tion) of  CTCAE Grade 2 or greater. Note 
that during the randomized treatment period, rescue medicat ion use will be limited to BID for up 
to 3 days per week. If the subject uses rescue medication BID for 3 day s per week for 2 
consecutive weeks, the subject will be discontinued fro m the study  due to l ack of efficacy. All 
types and doses of antinausea/ant ivomiting rescue medicat ion will be documented and the rescue 
medicat ion will be provided by  the subject’s treating physician. The preferred rescue medicat ion 
will be ondansetron 4 mg given orally. Other routes of administration of ondansetron are allowed 
if clinically indicated (eg, intravenous in case of vomit ing). Alternat ively, other antiemet ics may 
be provided based on local guid elines and PI and subject preference if not prohibited per 
protocol . Exam ples of al ternat ive allowed rescue medicat ions include diphenhydramine, 
dimenhydrinate or promethazine.

8.1.2 Storage
Study  drug m ust be stored in a secure, limited -access l ocati on under t he storage condit ions 
specified on the label until dispensed or returned to the sponsor or designee for destruction .The 
capsules should remain in the original container until dispensed.
8.1.3 Dose and Regimen
Subjects will take their first dose of study  medica tion at the randomization visit and their 
morning dose in clinic at Visits 5 (Week 4), 6 (Week 8), and 7 (Week 12). Subjects will be 
instructed to take medicat ion 1 dose in the morning approximately 1 hour before the first meal of 
the day  and another dose in the evening approximately 1 hour before the main last meal of the 
day, at a regul ar dose interval. If a subject missed any individual dose, they  may take the dose 
within a 4- hour window from the normal expected dosage time. If not taken within a 4 -hour 
window, they  shoul d not take that dose and proceed to take the normal dose at the next scheduled 
time point.
8.1.4 Overdose
An overdose is defined as a known deliberate or accidental administration of study  drug, to or by  
a study  subject, at a dose above that wh ich is assigned to that individual subject according to the 
study  protocol .
All cases of overdose (with or without associated AEs) will be documented on an Overdose page 
of the eCRF, to capture this important safet y informat ion consistent ly in the database . Cases of 
overdose without manifested signs or symptoms are not considered AEs. AEs associated with an 
overdose will be documented on AE CRF(s) according to Section
 10.0.
Serious adverse events (SAEs) associated with overdose should be reported according to the 
procedure outlined in Sect ion 10.2.2 .
To date, the effects of an overdose of TAK -906 have not been characterized. TAK -906 has been 
investigated in clinical studies up to a maximum single oral dose of TAK -906M 300 m g and 
100mg BID for 9 day s. Treatm ent-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) obs erved at vari ous dose 
levels include mild facial swelling, constipat ion, headache, dizziness and fat igue. All TEAEs 
were mild to moderate in intensit y. 
In the event of an overdose, discont inue the study  drug and treat the subject symptomat ically and 
provi de supportive care as needed. In the event of drug overdose, the next scheduled dose should 
be wit hheld, and the subjects should be treated considering their clinical presentation per local 
guidelines. Regular dosing may resume after discussio n with the m edical  monitor af ter the 
subject recovers from effects of overdose. 
8.2 Study Drug Assignment and Dispensing Procedures
The invest igator or the invest igator’s designee will access the interactive response techno logy
(IRT) at screening to obtain the subject stu dy number. The investigator or the invest igator’s 
designee will use the IRT to randomize the subject into the study  at Vi sit 4 (Day  1) shoul d they

qualify . Randomizat ion into the 5 m g dose arm  is discontinued in Protocol Amendment 8. 
Subjects will be assig ned in a 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the 3 treatment arms of TAK- 906M 25 or 50 m g 
or placebo BID.
During this contact, the invest igator or designee will provide the necessary subject -ident ifying 
inform ation, including the subject number assigned at screening. The medication identificat ion 
(ID) number of the study  drug to be dispensed will then be provided by  the IRT. If sponsor -
supplied drug is lost or damaged, the site can request a replacement fro m IRT. (Refer to IRT 
manual provided separately.) At subsequent dr ug-dispensing visits, the invest igator or designee 
will again access IRT to request additional study  drug (and other sponsor -supplied drug[s]) for a 
subject. The medicat ion ID number of the study  drug to be dispensed will be provided by the 
IRT and entered onto the appropriate drug accountabilit y log.
8.3 Randomization Code Creation and Storage 
The Sponsor’s randomization personnel or designee will generate the randomizat ion schedule for 
the study; an IRT will be used in a centralized fashio n for subject randomizat ion and study  
medicat ion assignments. All rando mizat ion information will be stored in a secured area, 
accessible only by authorized personnel.
8.4 Study Drug Blind Maintenance 
The study  medicat ion blind will be maintained using the IRT. The principal investigator at each 
study  site will  receive instructi ons on obtaining the medicat ion assignment through the IRT.
During regularly  scheduled m onitoring visit s, a study  monitor from the sponsor or a designee 
will perform accountabilit y of study  drug inventory. All assigned/unassigned treatment 
medicat ion will be reconciled and returned to the sponsor or a designee or authorized for on -site 
destruction or return at study  closure.
After rem oval of the 5 m g treatm ent arm  in Protocol Amendment 8, the study  team  will remain 
blinded to subject’s treatment allocation.
8.5 Unblinding Procedure 
The study  drug blind shall not be broken by  the investi gator unl ess inform ation concerning the 
study  drug i s necessary for the medical treatment of the subject. All stu
dy assessments and 
causalit y assessments should be perform ed, if possible, before unblinding. In the event of a 
medical emergency, if possible, the medical mo nitor should be contacted before the study  drug 
blind is broken to discuss the need for unblinding .
For unblinding a subject, the study  drug blind can be obtained by the invest igator through the 
IRT.
The sponsor must be notified as soon as possible if the study  drug blind is broken. The date, 
time, and reason the blind is broken must be recorded in the source documents and eCRF/IRT.

If any site personnel are unblinded, study  drug m ust be stopped immediately, and the subject 
must be withdrawn fro m the study . 
8.6 Accountability and Destruction of Sponsor- Supplied Drugs
Drug supplies will be counted and recon ciled at the site before being returned to the sponsor or 
designee or authorized for destruction.
The invest igator or designee must ensure that the sponsor -supplied drug is used in accordance 
with the protocol  and is dispensed only to subjects enrolled in the study . To docum ent 
appropriate use of sponsor -supplied drug, the investigator or designee must maintain records of 
all sponsor -supplied drug delivered to the site, site inventory , dispensat ion and use by each 
subject, and return to the sponsor or desig nee.
On receipt of sponsor -supplied drug, the invest igator or designee must verify the contents of the 
shipments against the packing list. The verifier should ensure that the quantit y is correct, and the 
medicat ion is in good condit ion. If quant ity and con ditions are acceptable, investigator or 
designee should acknowledge the receipt of the shipment by  recording in IRT. If there are any  
discrepancies between the packing list versus the actual product received, Takeda or designee 
must be contacted to resolve the issue. All packing lists should be filed in the investigator’s 
essent ial docum ent or pharm acy file.
The invest igator or designee must maintain 100% accountabilit y for all sponsor -supplied drugs 
received and dispensed during his or her entire participa tion in the study . Proper drug 
accountabilit y includes, but is not limit ed to:
Continuously mo nitoring expiration dates if (expiry date/retest date) is provided to the 
investigator or designee. 
Frequent ly verifying that actual inventory  matches docum ented inventory .
Verifying that all containers used are documented accurately on the log.
Verifying that required fields are co mpleted accurately and legibly.
If any dispensing errors or discrepancies are discovered, the sponsor or designee must be notified 
immediately .
The IRT will include all required informat ion as a separate entry  for each subject to whom 
sponsor -supplied drug is dispensed.
The invest igator or designee must record the current inventory of all sponsor -supplied drugs on a 
sponsor -approved drug accountabilit y log. The log should include all required informat ion as a 
separate entry  for each subject to whom sponsor -supplied drug is dispensed. All log entries must 
be timely and legible, and all must be acco mpanied by the init ials, signature, or sea l of the person 
completing the noted action. 
All study  drug not returned to the site by a subject must be invest igated by the site and 
appropriately  docum ented on the drug accoun tability  log.

Before si te closure or at appropriate intervals, a representati ve from the sponsor or i ts designee 
will perform sponsor -supplied drug accountabilit y and reconciliat ion. In all cases, this will be 
performed before sponsor -supplied drugs are returned to the sponsor or its designee or before 
destruction. The invest igator or desi gnee will retain a copy  of the docum entati on regarding 
sponsor -supplied drug accountabilit y, return, and/or destruction, and a copy  will be sent to the 
sponsor or designee.
The invest igator will be notified of any expiry date or retest date extensi on of sponsor -supplied 
drug during the study  conduct. On expiry date notificat ion from the sponsor or designee, the site 
must com plete all  instructi ons outlined in the notification, including segregat ion of expired 
sponsor -supplied drug for return to the sponsor or its designee for destruction.
In the event of expiry date extensio n of sponsor -supplied drug already at the study site, 
sponsor -supplied drugs may be relabeled with the new expiry date at that site. In such cases, 
Takeda or i ts desi gnee will  prep are addi tional labels, certificates of analyses, and all necessary  
docum entati on for com pletion of  the procedure at the sites.

Medical history  to be obtain ed will include determining whether the subject has any  significant 
condi tions or di seases rel evant to the di sease under study  that resolved at or before signing of 
inform ed consent. Ongoing condit ions are considered concurrent medical condit ions (see 
Section9.1.9 ).
Medicat ion history  informat ion to be obtained includes any medicat ion relevant to eligibilit y 
criteria (and efficacy/safet y evaluat ion)stopped at or within 90days before signing o f informed 
consent.
9.1.3 Physical Examination Procedure
A baseline physical examinat ion (defined as the assessment before first dose of study  drug) will 
consist of the fo llowing body  systems: (1) ey es; (2) ears, nos e, throat; (3) cardiovascular system; 
(4) respi ratory  system; (5) GI sy stem; (6) dermatologic system; (7) extremit ies; 
(8)musculo skeletal  system; (9) nervous system; (10) lymph nodes; (11) other. All subsequent 
physical examinat ions should assess clinical ly significant changes from  the assessment before 
first dose examinat ion. Any clinically  significant changes from the baseline examinat ion will be 
recorded as an AE.
9.1.4 Assessment of the Extrapyramidal System 
A detailed assessment of the extrapy ramidal syste m will be performed at study  entry , Weeks 4, 
8, and 12 or study  exit by  a heal thcare professio nal qualified to perform this assessment using the 
guidance provi ded by Takeda. Subjects with any neurologic abnormalit ies will be referred to a 
neuro logist for appropri ate medical  evaluati on and any  AEs shoul d be reported as per AE 
reporting procedures provided in Sect ion 10.0 of this protocol . A copy  of the Gui dance for 
Assessment of the Extrapy ramidal System is provided in Appendix C.
9.1.5 Weight, Height, and BMI
A subject should have weight and height measured while wearing indoor clothing and with shoes 
off. Height is recorded in cent imeters without decimal places. Weight is co llected in kilograms 
(kg) wi th 1 dec imal place. BMI should be derived as:
Metri c: BMI = wei ght (kg)/height (m)²
The eCRF will perform the BMI calculat ion based on the height and weight values entered.
9.1.6 Vital Signs Procedure
Vital signs will  include body  temperature (oral , tympanic, or axilla ry measurement), respi ratory  
rate (supine/semisupine), blood pressure (sy stolic and diastolic) and pulse (beats per minute). 
Vital signs can be performed in supine or semisupine posit ion but should be performed after 
resting for 5 minutes and consistent ly for each subject.
Vital signs assessment should occur before the study  drug i s taken. When vital signs are 
scheduled at the same t ime as blood sampling, vital signs will take pri ority and vi tal signs will be 
obtained wit hin 0.5 hour before the scheduled bl ood draw .

Concomitant medicat ion is any drug given in addit ion to the study  drug. These may  be 
prescribed by  a physician or obtained by  the subject over the counter and is not provided by the 
sponsor. At each study  visit, subjects will be asked whether they  have taken any medicat ion 
other than the study  drug (used from signing of informed consent through the end of the study ), 
and all medicat ion including vitamin supplements, over -the-counter m edicat ions, and oral herbal 
preparati ons, m ust be recorded in the eCRF.
9.1.9 Documentation of Concurrent Medical Conditions
Concurrent medical condit ions are those significant ongoing condit ions or di seases that are 
present at signing of informed consent. This includes clinically significant laboratory , ECG, or 
physical examinat ion abnormalit ies noted at the screening/baseline examinat ion, according to the 
judgment of the investigator. The condit ion (ie, diagnosis) sh ould be docum ented.
9.1.10 Procedures for Clinical Laboratory Samples
All samples will be co llected in accordance with acceptable laboratory  procedures and after

9.1.11 Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance Procedure
9.1.11.1 Male Subjects and Their Female Partners
From  signing of informed consent, throughout the duration of the study ,and for 95 days after last 
dose of study  drug, nonsterilized** male subjects who are sexually  active wi th a female partner 
of childbearing potential* must use barrier contraception (eg, condom wit h or without 
spermicidal cream or jelly). In addit ion, they must not donate sperm during this period. Women 
of childbearing potential* who are partners of male subjects must also use highly  effect ive 
contraception during this period as shown in the list below.
9.1.11.2 Female Subjects and Their Male Partners
From  signing o f informed consent, throughout the duration of the study , and for 35 days after last 
dose of study  drug, female subjects of childbearing potential* who are sexually  active wi th a 
nonsterilized male partner** must use a highly effective method of contracept ion (fro m the list 
below). 
In addit ion, they  must be advised not to donate ova during this period.

9.1.11.3 Definitions and Procedures for Contraception and Pregnancy Avoidance
The follow ing definitions apply for contraception and pregnancy avoidance procedures.
*A woman is considered a woman of childbearing potential, that is, fertile, fo llowing menarche 
and until beco ming postmenopausal unless permanent ly sterile. Permanent sterilizat ion methods 
include hysterectomy, and bilateral oophorectomy. A postmenopausal state i s defined as no 
menses for 12 months wit hout an alternative medical cause. A high follicle -stimulat ing hormone
(FSH) level in the postmenopausal range (FSH >40 IU/L) may be used to confirm a 
postm enopausal state in y ounger women (eg, those <45 y ears old) or wom en who are not using 
horm onal contracepti on or horm onal replacement therapy. However, in the absence of 12 months 
of amenorrhea wi th an FSH >40 IU/L or at l east 5 years since l ast regul ar menses, a single FSH 
measurement is insufficient.
** Ste rilized men should be at least 1 -year postbilateral vasectomy and have confirmed that they 
have obtained documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate or have had bilateral 
orchi ectomy .
The follow ing procedures apply for contraception and pregnanc y avoidance.
Highly effective methods of contraception are defined as those, alone or in combinat ion, that 1.
resul t in a l ow failure rate (i e, less than 1% failure rate per y ear when used consistent ly and 
correctly ). In this study , where m edicat ions and devi ces containing hormones are included, 
the only acceptable methods of contraception are:
Nonhorm onal methods: 
– Intrauterine device. 
–Bilateral tubal occlusio n. 
–Vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the study 
participant) and that the vasectomized partner has received medical assessment of the 
surgi cal success. 
Horm onal methods:
–Combined (estrogen and progestogen) hormonal contraception associated with 
inhibit ion of ovulation initiated at least 3 months before the first d ose of study  drug 
OR combined with a barrier method (male condom, female condo m or diaphragm) if 
for shorter durati on unt il she has been on contraceptive for 3 months:
Oral.
Intravaginal (eg, ring).
Transdermal.
–Progestogen -only hormonal contracepti on associ ated wi th inhibit ion of ovulation 
initiated at least 3 months before the first dose of study  drug OR combined with a

barrier m ethod (m ale condo m, female condo m, or di aphragm ) if shorter till  she has 
been on con tracepti ve for 3 m onths.
Oral.
Injectable/implantable.
Unacceptable methods of contraception are:2.
Periodic abst inence (eg, calendar, ovulat ion, symptothermal, postovulat ion methods).
Spermicides only .
Withdrawal.
No m ethod at all.
Use of female and male co ndoms together.
Cap/di aphragm/sponge wi thout spermicide and wit hout condom.
Sexual abst inence is NOT an acceptable method of contraception.
Subjects will be provided with information on highly effect ive methods of contraception as 3.
part of the subject infor med consent process and will be asked to sign a consent form stating 
that they  understand the requi rements for avoi dance of pregnancy, donation of ova and sperm 
donati on during the study .
During the study , regul ar urine human chori onic gonadotropin (hCG) p regnancy  tests will be 4.
performed only  for wom en of childbearing potential and all subjects (male and female) will 
receive cont inued guidance with respect to the avoidance o f pregnancy and sperm donat ion 
as part of the study  procedures. Such gui dance shoul dinclude a reminder of the fo llowing:
Contraceptive requirements of the study.
Reasons for use of barrier methods (ie, condom) in male subjects with pregnant partners.
Assessment of subject compliance through questions such as:
–Have you used the contracept ion consistent ly and correctly since the last visit ?
– H ave y ou forgotten to use contraception since the last visit ?
–Are y our menses l ate (even in women with irregular or infrequent menstrual cy cles a 
pregnancy test must be performed if the answer is “yes”).
–Is there a chance you could be pregnant ?
In addi tion to a negative serum hCG pregnancy test at screening, female subjects of 5.
childbearing potential must also have a negat ive urine hCG pregnancy test before receiving 
any dose of study  medicat ion [as close as possible and before the first dose of study  
medicat ion, preferably on the same day ].

In wom en of childbearing potential who present with amenorrhea or signs/symptoms 
suggest ive of pregnancy or delayed/missed menstrual period by >5 days (whichever co mes 
first), the study  drug m ust be immediately discont inued, a serum pregnancy test must be 
perform  and if negative, the subject may restart the study  drug. In cases of positive 
pregnancy, the subjects must be managed as described in Sect ion 9.1.12 .
An onsite end of study  pregnancy test should be performed for subjects with menstrual 
irregularit ies, variable menstrual cycle length by more than ±5 days or missed last menstrual 
period by  more than 5 days at the time of the safety  follow-up call. 
9.1.12 Pregna ncy
If any subject is confirmed to be pregnant during the study , the subject should be withdrawn, and 
any sponsor -supplied drug should be immediately discontinued. In addit ion, any  pregnancies in 
the partner of a male subject occurring during study conduct or wi thin 95 days after the last dose, 
shoul d also be recorded following authorizat ion from the subject’s partner. 
If the pregnancy  occurs during administration of active study  drug, for exam ple, after the 
rando mizat ion visit, the pregnancy should be rep orted immediately, using a pregnancy 
notification form, to the contact listed in Section 1.0.
Shoul d the pregnancy  occur during or after administration of blinded drug, the invest igator must 
inform  the subject of their right to receive treatment information. If the subject chooses to 
receive unblinded treatment informat ion, the individual blind should be broken by the 
investigator. Subjects rando mized to placebo need not be fo llowed.
If the female subject and/or female partner of a male subject agrees to the primary care physician 
being informed, the invest igator should notify the primary care physician that the female 
subject/female partner of the subject was participating in a clinical study  at the time she became 
pregnant and provide details o f the study  drug the subject received (blinded or unblinded, as 
applicable).
All pregnancies, including female partners of male subjects, in subjects on active study  drug will  
be followed up to final outcome using the pregnancy  form. Pregnancies will remain blinded to 
the study  team . The outcom e, including any premature terminat ion, must be reported to the 
sponsor. An evaluation after the birth of the child will also be conducted.
9.1.13 ECG Procedure 
A standard 12- lead ECG will be recorded. Subject should have rested in supine or semisupine 
position for at l east 5 minutes before ECG. When the timing of these measurements coincides 
with a blood collecti on, th e ECG shoul d be obtained before the nominal time o f the blood 
collect ion. Tri plicate tracings of ECGs should be performed. ECG will be assessed at Visit 1 
(Day  -35), and approximately 1 to 2 hours postdose at Visit 4 (Day  1), Vi sit 5 (Week 4), Visi t 6 
(Wee k 8), and Vi sit 7 (Week 12) on those visit days requiring study  dosing, and at early 
termination (as specified in
 Appendix A). The time that the ECG was performed will be 
recorded.

The invest igator (or a qualified observer at the study site) will interpret the ECG using 1 of the 
following categori es: wi thin norm al limits, abnormal  but not clinically significant, or abnormal 
and clinically  significant. ECGs assessed as abnormal and clinically significant must be sent to 
the sponsor’s or designee’s medical mo nitor for assessment and to confirm if the subject should 
continue in the study . 
The fo llowing param eters will  be recorded on the eCRF from the subject’ s ECG trace: heart rate, 
PR, QT and QTc, and QRS intervals. 
QTc interval will be calculated using Fridericia ’s form ula: QTcF=QT/RR1/3.

9.1.18 Other Pr ocedures
9.1.18.1 GEBT
For subjects who do not have documented delayed gastric empt ying using an accepted diagnost ic 
method (see Section 7.1), a 4 -hour 13C-Spirulina GEBT will be performed at Visit 2 (up to 
approximately 14 days after consent). The GEBT is preceded by  a test m eal and an 8 -hour fast is 
requi red before the GEBT test meal. 
The GEBT is simple to administer and the test meal is manufactured under highly -controlled 
drug m anufacturing procedures and subject’s breath samples are analyzed using sophist icated 
gas isotope rati o mass spectrom etry, a US F ood and Drug Administration (FDA) approved, 
validated analyt ical system.
The test is conducted over a 4-hour evaluat ion period after an 8 -hour fast and is designed to 
show how rapidly the stomach empt ies solids by measuring carbon dioxide in a pat ient’s breath. 
Prem eal breath samples are collected at the start of the test. Subjects then eat a special test meal. 
After consuming the meal, addit ional breath samples are collected at specified times. To ensure 
that the samples are evaluable, subjects are required to consume the ent ire test m eal (egg mixture 
and at least 4 of the meal crackers).
Delayed gastri c emptying by GEBT is defined as t 1/2≥79 minutes (80th percent ile).
If GEBT falls between 67 to 79 minutes, then site must confirm the diagnostic detail of the prior 
history :

9.5 Possible Changes to the Procedures to Address Interruptions Due to Pandemic 
Outbreak
The fo llowing i s intended to give guidance about which changes to the procedures could be 
accepted in case any study  partici pants or study  sites are impact ed by the COVID -19 pandemic 
outbreak. The guidance takes references from the FDA Guidance on Conduct of Clinical Trials 
of Medical Products during COVID -19 Pandemic Gui dance for Industry , Invest igators, and 
Institutional Review Boards, March 2020 and the u
pdate from 11 May  2020, and the EMA 
Guidance on the Management of Clinical Trials during the COVID -19 (Coronavirus) pandemic, 
Versi on 3 (28/04/2020).
As the COVID -19 pandemic outbreak may peak in different regions at different times and 
restri ctions implem ented by l ocal laws and recommendat ions may vary , any  decisi on on 
procedural  changes shoul d be m ade on a case by  case basis fo llowing consultat ion with the 
medical mo nitor, wi th patient safet y as the pri ority.
In case there are restrictions to conduct procedures as originally planned in consequence to the 
COVID -19 pandemic:
Inform ed consent form  procedure for i nvest igational sites and study  parti cipants rel ated to 
the COVID -19 pandemic situat ion: If necessary , inform ed consent from  a potenti al or curren t 
trial parti cipant may be obtained via electronic informed consent (eIC) capabilit ies, or an 
electroni c face-to-face consent interview when these individuals are unable to travel to the 
site.
Sites will emplo y all efforts to see subjects as described in t he clinical assessments. In 
unavo idable circumstances, such as the COVID -19 pandemic, except ions m ay be granted for 
alternat ive methods for conducting subject visits wit h approval by  the medical  monitor 
and/or sponsor. Such instances will be documented in the study  records. These data collected 
with alternat ive methods m ay be handled different ly in the final data analysis, with this 
docum ented in the statistical analysis plan.
Procedures for clinical laboratory  samples:
–Allow blood draws or other diagnostic tests to be performed by  the invest igator or the 
study  coordinator or by  a qualified nurse who can enter the trial part icipant’s ho me.
–Allow blood draws or other diagnostic tests to be conducted at a local laboratory  (or 
relevant clinical or office facili ty) authori zed/cert ified to perform such tests routinely.

Starti ng wi th Visi t 4 (Day  1), if samples are collected and analyzed by local lab, prolactin 
will not be evaluated, in order to maintain investigator blinding.
Assessment of the Extrapy ramidal Syste m: Allow the assessment via video to observe 
whether ty pical  EPS symptom s (eg, pseudoparkinsonism, acute dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, 
akathisia) are present.
ECG, wei ght, and vi tal sign procedures: In situations when an on -site visi t is not possible,
ECGs , wei ght, and vital signs may  be perf ormed by  a qualified heal th care professio nal, or at 
a local heal thcare facili ty, which is authori zed/certified to perform such tests routinely.
Allow the use of web -based back -up system  on el ectroni c devices.
Deviat ions from the protocol  (eg, missing required bloodwork, visit performed outside of 
window) will be noted as a protocol deviat ion related to COVID -19.

An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unint ended sign (eg, a clinically significant 
abnorm al laboratory  value), symptom, or disease temporally  associated wi th the use of a drug 
whether or not it is considered related to the drug.
10.1.3 Additional Points to Consider for AEs
An untoward finding generally may:
Indicate a new diagnosis or unexpected worsening of a pre -exist ing condit ion. (Intermittent 
events for pre -exist ing condit ions or underlying disease should not be considered AEs.)
Necessitate therapeutic intervent ion.
Requi re an invasive diagnosti c procedure.
Requi re discont inuat ion or a change in dose of study  drug or a concomitant medicat ion.
Be considered unfavorable by the invest igator for any reason.

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 8 13July 2020
Diagnoses vs signs and symptoms:
Each event should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Acco mpanying signs 
(including abnormal laboratory  values or ECG findings) or symptoms should NOT be 
recorded as additional AEs. If a diagnosi s is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) should be 
recorded appropriately as an AE(s).
Laboratory  values and ECG findings:
Changes in laboratory  values or ECG findings are only  considered to be AEs if they are 
judged to be clinically  significant (i e, if som e act ion or intervent ion is required or if the 
investigator judges the change to be bey ond the range of normal physio logic fluctuati on). A 
laboratory  or ECG retest an d/or conti nued m onitoring of an abnorm al value or finding is not 
considered an intervention. In addit ion, repeated or additional noninvasive testing for 
verification, evaluat ion or monitoring o f an abnormalit y is not consi dered an intervent ion.
If abnorm allaboratory  values or ECG findings are the result of pathology  for which there is 
an overall diagnosis (eg, increased creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be 
reported appropriately  as an AE.
Pre-exist ing condit ions:
Pre-exist ing condit ions (present at the time o f signing of informed consent) are considered 
concurrent medical condit ions and should NOT be recorded as AEs. If the subject 
experiences a worsening or complicat ion of such a concurrent medical condit ion, the 
worsening or complica tion shoul d be recorded appropriately an AE (worsening or 
complicat ion occurs after start of study  drug). Investigators should ensure that the event term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
If a subject has a pre -exist ing episodi c concurrent medical condit ion (eg, asthma, epilepsy) 
any occurrence of an episode should only be captured as an AE if the condit ion becomes 
more frequent, seri ous or severe in nature. Invest igators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures t he change in the condit ion from baseline (eg “worsening of…”).
If a subject has a degenerat ive concurrent medical condit ion (eg, cataracts, rheumatoid 
arthri tis), worsening of the condition should only  be recorded as an AE if occurring to a 
greater extent to that which would be expected. Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condit ion (eg, “worsening o f…”).
Worsening of AEs:
If the subject experiences a worsening or complication of an AE after any  change in study  
drug, the worsening or complicat ion shoul d be recorded as a new AE. Invest igators should 
ensure that the AE term recorded captures the change in the condition (eg, “worsening 
of…”).

Changes in intensit y of AEs:
If the subject experiences changes in severit yof an AE, the event shoul d be captured once 
with the m aximum  intensity recorded.
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or intervent ions):
Prepl anned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that were scheduled before signing of 
inform ed consent are not considered AEs/SAEs. Complicat ions result ing from any planned 
surgery  shoul d be reported as AEs.
Elect ive surgeries or procedures:
Elect ive procedures performed where there is no change in the subject’s medical condit ion 
shoul d not be recorded as AEs/SAEs but should be docum ented in the subject’s source 
docum ents. Com plicat ions result ing from an elect ive surgery should be reported as AEs.
Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy):
Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacologic act ion should NOT be recorded as 
an AE. The investigator must make the dist inction between exacerbation o f pre-exist ing 
illness and lack of therapeut ic efficacy.
Overdose:
Cases of overdose with any medication wit hout manifested side effects are NOT considered 
AEs, but instead will be documented on an overdose page of the eCRF. Any manifested side 
effects will be considered as an AEs and will be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. 
10.1.4 SAEs
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
Results in DEATH.1.
IsLIFE THREATENING. 2.
The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at 
the time o f the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused 
death if it were more severe.
Requi res inpat ient HOSPI TALIZATION or prolongation of exist ing hospitalizat ion. 3.
Results in persistent or significant DISABILITY/INCAPACITY.4.
Leads to a CONGENITAL ANOMALY/BIRTH DEFECT.5.
Is an IMPORTANT MEDICAL EVENT that satisfies any of the fo llowing: 6.
May require intervent ion to prevent items 1 through 5 above.
May expose the subject to danger, even though the event is not immediately life 
threatening or fatal or does not result in hospitalization.

10.1.5 AEs of S pecial Interest
An AE of special interest ([AESI]; serious or n onseri ous) is one of scientific and medical 
concern specific to the compoun d or program , for which ongoing monitoring and rapid 
communicat ion by the invest igator to Takeda may be appropriate. Such events may require 
further invest igation to characterize and understand them and would be described in protocols 
and instructi ons prov ided for invest igators as to how and when they should be reported to 
Takeda. The fo llowing events are AESI for this study :
Extrapy ramidal  symptom s and other clinically relevant CNS or neuropsy chiatric di sease 1.
including tardive dyskinesia, neuroleptic malig nant syndrome, acute dystonia, parkinsonian -
like symptoms, convulsive seizure, severe mental depression, and hallucinations.
Clinically relevant hy perprolact inemia (see below). 2.
Guidance to investigators for management of extrapyramidal symptoms and central
nervous system/neuropsychiatric AEs
Extrapy ramidal  symptom s incl uding tardive dyskinesia, acute dy stoni c react ions, 
parkinsonian -like symptoms [30]and akathisia are considered to be mainly caused by the 
blockade o f D2receptor in the dorsal striatum in the brain. These side effects have been reported 
with all centrally  acting DA receptor D 2antagonists such as metoclopramide and atypical 
neuro leptics. TAK -906 is considered as a peripherally select ive DA receptor D 2/D3antagonist 
with limited penetrati on of  the bl ood brain barrier, hence it is considered to have a low potential

for causing ex trapy ramidal  symptoms com pared wi th metocl opramide or aty pical  neurol eptics. 
However, as TAK- 906 is in early development and its complete safet y profile is not 
characterized at this time, Takeda is closely monit oring m edical events that may potentially  be 
extrapy ramidal  in nature.
Of greatest concern is tardive dy skinesia, a severe and often irreversible and disfiguring disorder 
characterized by  involuntary  movements of the face, tongue, mouth, or jaw, and trunk and/or 
extremit ies. Alt hough the risk for dev eloping tardive dyskinesia in the general populat ion may be 
increased among the elderly, women, and individuals with diabetes, it is not possible to predict 
which pat ients will develop D 2receptor antagonist -induced tardive dyskinesia. 
There i s no known e ffective treatment of established cases of tardive dyskinesia, although in 
some patients, tardive dyskinesia may remit, partially or completely, within several weeks to 
months after discont inuat ion of causative agent. 
In subjects with suspected EPS, study drug shoul d be immediately  interrupted, and subjects 
referred for appropriate neurological consultation. If, after neurological consultat ion, EPS i s 
confirmed, study  drug shoul d be discont inued, and the subject withdrawn fro m the study . In the 
remaining c ases restarting of the study  drug shoul d be eval uated individually  after discussi on 
with the m edical m onitor.
In subjects who develop suspected CTCAE Grade 1 CNS/neuropsy chiatri c AEs, the study  drug 
may be continued at invest igator’s discretion after discu ssion with the m edical mo nitor. 
However, in subjects with CTCAE ≥ Grade 2 CNS/neuropsy chiatri c AEs, the study  drug should 
be immediately  interrupted, and subjects referred for appropriate neurological consultat ion. If 
after neurol ogical consul tation, a CNS /neuropsy chiatri c AE is confirmed and considered related 
to the study  drug, the study  drug shoul d be discontinued, and the subject withdrawn from the 
study . In the rem aining cases restarting of the study  drug shoul d be eval uated individually  after 
discussi on with the m edical mo nitor. If the study  drug i s interrupted for m ore than 10 days, the 
subject should be discont inued form the study and procedures stated in Section 7.6“Procedures 
for Discont inuat ion or Wi thdrawal  of a Subject” should be followed.
Guidance to investigator for management of elevated serum prolactin
Several physio logic and patho logic condi tions f or example, pregnancy , breast feeding , breast 
stimulat ion, prol actinomas, vascular disorders, autoimmune disorders, chronic renal failure, chest 
wall trauma, seizures, and stress can result in increased plasma prolact in levels [31].
TAK -906 i s a D 2receptor antagonist, which increases pr olactin release by inhibit ing the negat ive 
control  mechanism  of DA on prol actin, a pharmacol ogical class effect shared with other D 2
receptor antagonists. It is ant icipated that TAK -
906 will also increase serum prolactin levels. 
The m ost frequent symptoms of chronic hyperprolactinemia include reproductive dysfunct ion 
(anovulat ion, menstrual  irregulari ty, subfert ility, decreased estrogen and testosterone 
producti on), sexual impairment (diminished libido, erectile dysfunct ion, retro grade or painful 
ejaculat ion, orgasmic dysfunct ion, impotence), breast pathology  (galactorrhea and breast 
enlargement) [32].

Medicat ion-induced hyperprolact inemia is usually associated with prolact in levels ranging fro m 
25 to 100 µg/L; however, TAK -906 in so me cases may lead to serum prolact in levels exceeding 
200µg/L.
In subjects with symptoms suggest ive of hyperprolactinemia, the invest igator should manage the 
subject as clinically indicated. In these subjects, the benefit -risk of cont inued participat ion in the 
study  shoul d be evaluated and documented in the eCRF.
Only prol actin related symptoms leading to discontinuat ion of a subject from the study  shoul d be 
reported as an AESI and recorded as an AE in the eCRF and reported as per Section 10.2.2
shoul d they  meet the cri teria for SAE (Secti on 10.1.4 ).
Prolactin related symptoms not leading to discont inuat ion of  a subject from  the study  shoul d not 
be reported as an AESI but recorded as an AE in the eCRF and reported as per Section 10.2.2
shoul d they  meet the cri teria for SAE (Secti on
 10.1.4 ). 
Elevated serum prolact in without clinical manifestations (asymptomat ic hyperprolact inemia) 
shoul d not be reported as an AESI, AE, or SAE; however, serum prolactin levels >ULN will be 
summarized as per statist ical analysis plan (SAP) of this study. 
Subjects will be wit hdrawn from the study  if the investi gator requi res unblinding of the study  
treatm ent or ser um prolactin level because of suspected hy perprol actinemia.
In wom an of childbearing potential who present with postdosing amenorrhea or signs/symptoms 
suggest ive of pregnancy or delayed/missed menstrual period by >5 days (whichever co mes first), 
the study drug m ust be immediately  discontinued, a serum  pregnancy  test m ust be performed and 
if negat ive, the subject may restart the study  drug. In cases of positive pregnancy, the subjects 
must be managed as described in Sect ion 9.1.12 .
TheAESI should be recor ded in an AE of special interest named Form and reported to the 
clinical contract research organizat ion (CRO)/Pharmacovigilance depart ment within 24 hours. 
AEs of special interest must be recorded as AEs in the eCRF. An evaluat ion form along with all 
other required documentation must be submitted to the sponsor.
If an AESI also meets the criteria of SAE (Section 10.1.4 )
, it shoul d be reported using both the 
AESI named Form AND the SAE Form.
10.1.6 Severity of AEs
All AEs, including clinically  significant treatm ent-emergent laboratory  abnorm alities, will be 
graded according to CTCAE Version 4.03 
(https://evs.nci.nih.gov/ftp1/CTCAE/CTCAE_4.03_2010- 06 14_QuickReference_8.5x11.pdf).
AEs not listed by  the NCI CTCAE will be graded as below:
Grade 1: Mild; asymptomat ic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observat ions only; 
intervent ion not indicated.

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 8 13July 2020
Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or non -invasive intervent ion indicated; limit ing age 
appropriate instr umental  activities of daily living (ADL) (Instrumental ADL refer to preparing 
meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing mo ney, etc.).
Grade 3: severe or medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalizati on or 
prolongati on of  hospi talizati on indicated; disabling; limit ing self -care ADL.
Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervent ion indicated.
Grade 5: Fatal  AE; an event that results in the death of the subject.
10.1.7 Causality of AEs
The rel ationship of each AE to study  drug(s) will be assessed using the fo llowing categori es:
Related: An AE that fo llows a reasonable temporal sequence fro m administration of a 
drug (including the course after withdrawal o f the drug), or for which possible 
involvement of the drug cannot be ruled out, although factors other than the 
drug, such as underlying diseases, complicat ions, concomitant medicat ions and 
concurrent treatments, may  also be responsible.
Not Rel ated: An AE that does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence fro m 
administration of a drug and/or that can reasonably be explained by other 
factors, such as underlying diseases, complicat ions, concomitant medicat ions 
and concurrent treatments.
10.1.8 Relationship to Study Procedures
Relationship (causalit y) to st udy procedures should be determined for all AEs.
The rel ationship should be assessed as Related if the invest igator considers that there is 
reasonable possibilit y that an event i s due to a study  procedure. Otherwise, the relat ionship 
shoul d be assessed as Not Related. 
10.1.9 Start Date
The start date of the AE/SAE is the date that the first signs/symptoms were noted by  the subject 
and/or invest igator.
10.1.10 Stop Date 
The stop date of the AE/SAE is the date at which the subject recovered, the event resolved but 
with sequelae or the subject died.
10.1.11 Frequency 
Episodi c AEs/SAE or th ose that occur repeatedly  over a peri od of  consecut ive days are 
intermittent. All other events are continuous.

10.1.12 Action Concerning Study Drug 
Drug withdrawn: a study  drug i s stopped due to the par ticular AE.
Dose interrupted: the dose was interrupted due to the particular AE. 
Dose not changed: the particular AE did not require stopping a study drug.
Unknown: only to be used if it has not been possible to determine what action has been 
taken.
Not a pplicable: a study drug was stopped for a reason other than the particular AE, for 
example, the study  has been terminated, the subject died, dosing with study  drug was al ready  
stopped before the onset of the AE.
10.1.13 Outcome 
Recovered/reso lved: subject returne d to first assessment status with respect to the AE.
Recovering/resolving: the intensit y is lowered by 1 or m ore stages: the diagnosed AE or 
signs/symptom s has almost di sappeared; the abnormal laboratory  value improved but has not 
returned to the reference range or to baseline; the subject died from a cause other than the 
particular AE wi th the condi tion rem aining “recovering/resolving”.
Not recovered/not resolved: there is no change in the diagnosis, signs or symptoms; the 
intensity of the diagnosed AE , signs/ symptom s or laboratory  value on the l ast day  of the 
observed study  period has got worse than when it started; is an irreversible congenital 
anomaly; the subject died fro m another cause with the particular AE state remaining “Not 
recovered/not resolv ed”.
Reso lved with sequelae: the subject recovered from an acute AE but was left with 
perm anent/si gnificant impairment (eg, recovered from a cardiovascular accident but with 
some persisting paresis.
Fatal : the AEs which are considered as the cause of death . 
Unknown: the course of the AE cannot be fo llowed up due to hospital change or residence 
change at the end of the subject’s participation in the study .
10.2 Procedures
10.2.1 Collection and Reporting of AEs
10.2.1.1 AE Collection Period
After informed consent, but before ini tiation of  study  medicat ions, only SAEs will be co llected. 
Collect ion of all AEs (serious and nonserious) will commence fro m the time that the subject is 
first administered study  drug (randomizat ion visit). Routine collection o f AEs will cont inue for 
each subject throughout the study  until 30 days after the last dose of study drug is taken.

Protocol Incorporating Amendment No. 8 13July 2020
If an AE i s ongoing at the end of the study  for a subject, fo llow-up shoul d be provi ded until 
resol ution/stable level of sequelae is achieved, or unt il the invest igator no longer deems that i t is 
clinically significant, or until the subject is lost to follow up. If no fo llow-up is provi ded, the 
investigator must provide a just ificat ion. The fo llow-up will be continued for up to 8 weeks after 
the subject has discont inued his/her invest igational medicinal product. Informat ion on SAEs 
obtained after clinical database lock will be captured through the safet y database wit hout 
limitation of  time.
10.2.1.2 AE Reporting
At each study  visit, the investi gator will assess whether any  subject ive AEs have occurred. A 
neutral  quest ion, such as “How have you been feeling since your last visit ?” may be asked. 
Subjects may report AEs occurring at any other time during the study. Subjects experiencing an 
SAE m ust be m onitored until  the symptoms subs ide and any  clinically rel evant changes in 
laboratory  values have returned to baseline or there is a sat isfactory  explanati on for the change. 
All subjects experiencing AEs (postdose), whether considered associated with the use of the 
study  drug or not, m ust be m onitored until the symptoms subside and any clinically  relevant 
changes in laboratory  values have returned to baseline or until there is a satisfactory  explanat ion 
for the changes observed. All AEs will be documented in the AE page of the eCRF, whet her or 
not the invest igator concludes that the event is related to the drug treatment. The fo llowing 
inform ation will be documented for each event:
Event term.1.
Start and stop date and time.2.
Frequency.3.
Intensit y. 4.
Invest igator’s opinio n of the causal relatio nship between the event and administration of 5.
study  drug(s) (rel ated or not rel ated).
Invest igator’s opinio n of the causal relationship to study  procedure(s), including the details 6.
of the suspected procedure.
Action concerning study  drug 7.
Outcom e of event. 8.
Seriousness. 9.
The Daily Symptom Diary will not be used as a primary  means to collect AEs. However, should 
the invest igator become aware of a potential AE through the informat ion collected with this 
instrum ent, proper follow -up wi th the subject for medical e valuat ion shoul d be undertaken. 
Through this fo llow-up if it is determined that an AE not previously  reported has been i dentified, 
norm al reporting requi rements shoul d be applied.

10.2.2 Collection and Reporting of SAEs/AESI
When an SAE and/or AESI occurs through the AE collect ion peri od it shoul d be reported 
according to the fo llowing procedure:
As soon as an SAE/AESI is entered into the electronic data capture system, an alert is sent to the 
attenti on of  the contact listed in Section 1.1and to the safet y database.
The SAE/AESI eCRF should be transmitted within 24 hours of first onset or notification o f the 
event. However, as a back -up, if required, the SAE form should be co mpleted and reported to the 
attenti on of  the contact listed in Section 1.1.
The informat ion shoul d be com pleted as fully  as possible but contain, at a minimum:
A short descript ion of the event and the reason why  the event i s categori zed as serious.
Subject ID number.
Invest igator’s name.
Nam e of the study  drug(s).
Causalit y assessment.
Any SAE/AESI spontaneously  reported to the investigator following the AE collect ion peri od 
shoul d be reported to the sponsor if considered related to study  participat ion.
10.2.3 Reporting of Abnormal LFTs 
If a subject is noted to have ALT or AST elevated >3×ULN on 2 consecutive occasions, the 
abnorm ality should be recorded as an AE. In addition, an LFT Increases eCRF must be 
completed provi ding addi tional informationon relevant recent history , risk factors, clinical signs 
and symptoms and results of any  addi tional diagnosti c tests perform ed.
If a subject is noted to have ALT or AST >3×ULN and total bilirubin >2×ULN for which an 
alternat ive etio logy has not been i dentified, the event should be recorded as an SAE and reported 
per Section 10.2.2 . The investigator must contact the medical mo nitor for discussio n of the 
relevant subject details and possible alternative etiologies, such as acute viral hepat itis A or B or 
other acute liver disease or medical history /concurrent m edical  condi tions. Fo llow-up laboratory  
tests as described in Sect ion
 9.1.10 must also be performed. In addit ion, an LFT Increases eCRF 
must be completed and transmitted with the Takeda SAE form (per Section 10.2.2 ).
10.3 Follow -up of SAEs
If informat ion not available at the time of the first report becomes available at a later date, the 
investigator should complete a fo llow-up SAE form  or provide other written documentation and 
fax it immediately, within 24 hours of receipt. Copies of any relevant data from the hospital 
notes (eg, ECGs, laboratory  tests, di scharge summary , postm ortem  resul ts) shoul d be sent to the 
addressee, if requested.

All SAEs should be fo llowed up unt il reso lution or permanent outcome of the event. The 
timelines and procedure for follow-up reports are the same as those for the init ial report.
10.3.1 Safety Reporting to Investigators, IRBs or IECs, and Regulatory Authorities
The sponsor or designee will be responsible for reporting all suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSARs) and any other applicable SAEs to regulatory authorit ies, including 
the European Medicines Agency, invest igators and IRBs or IECs, as applica ble, in accordance 
with national regulat ions in the countries where the study  is conducted. Relat ive to the first 
awareness o f the event by /or further provisio n to the sponsor or sponsor’s designee, SUSARs 
will be submitted to the regulatory  authori ties as expedited report within 7 days for fatal and 
life-threatening events and 15 days for other serious events, unless otherwise required by 
national regulat ions. The sponsor will also prepare an expedited report for other safet y issues 
where these might mater ially alter the current benefit -risk assessment of a study  drug/sponsor 
supplied drug or that would be sufficient to consider changes in the study drug/sponsor supplied 
drug administration or in the overall conduct of the trial. The study  site also will  forward a copy  
of all expedited reports to his or her IRB or IEC in accordance with local regulat ions.

STATISTICAL METHODS 13.0
13.1 Statistical and Analytical Plans
A SAP will b e prepared and finalized before unblinding of subject’s treatment assignment. This 
docum ent will provi de further details regarding the definit ion of analysis variables and analysis 
methodol ogy to address all study  objectives.
A blinded data review will be conducted before unblinding of subject’s treatment assignment . 
This review will assess the accuracy and completeness of the study database, subject 
evaluabilit y, and appropri ateness of the planned statist ical methods.
13.1.1 Analysis Sets
The safet y set will include all subjects who were rando mized and received at least 1 dose of 
doubl e-blind study  medicat ion. In safety  summaries, subjects will be analyzed according to the 
treatm ent they  received. If a subject receives more than 1 treatment , the actual treatment will be 
defined as the one that is used most frequently. If the 2 most commo n treatments are used with 
equal  frequency , then the randomized treatment will be used for safet y summaries .
The full analysis set (FAS) will include all sub jects who were randomized, received at least 
1dose of study  drug, and have a baseline value and at least 1 valid postbaseline value for 
assessment of primary efficacy. In FAS efficacy summaries, subjects will be analyzed by the 
treatm ent to whi ch they  were rando mized.
The per protocol set (PPS) will include all FAS subjects who had no major protocol vio lations. If 
more than 5% of the total  subjects in the FAS have major protocol vio lations, analyses based on 
the PPS will be performed for the primary effica cy vari able only .
13.1.2 Analysis of Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics
Dem ographic and baseline characterist ics including sex, age, race, height, weight, BMI, and 
subject disease populat ion (DG and IG) will be listed and summarized for each treatmen t group 
and overall. The demographic and baseline characterist ics summary will be based on all 
rando mized subjects.
Baseline values for efficacy parameters (ANMS GCSI -DD, PAGI -SYM, and Clinician Symptom 
Severit y Rating, etc.) will also be presented for eac h treatment group and overall based on all 
rando mized subjects.
Height and wei ght values will  be presented in metric units (cm and kg respectively). BMI is 
calculated as [wei ght (kg)/hei ght (m )2], using the weight collected at the first screening visit. 
For continuous variables, number of nonmissing values and the mean, median, SD, minimum 
and maximum will be tabulated by treatment group and overall. For the categorical variables, the 
count and percentages of each possible value will be tabulated by treatm ent group and overall.
For continuous variables, comparabilit y of treatm ent groups will be assessed using an analysis o f 
variance (ANOVA) with treatment, subject disease population and center as fixed factors. For

discrete vari ables, com parabili ty will be assessed using the Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel general 
associ ation test, stratified by center and subject disease population. P- values will be displayed as 
descript ive statistics of co mparabilit y.
All individual demographic and baseline data will be listed by treatm ent, study  center and 
subject number.
13.1.3 Efficacy Analysis
The efficacy analyses and summaries will be based on the FAS. 
13.1.3.1 Primary Efficacy Analysis 
Change from baseline to Week 12 in weekly ANMS GCSI -DD composite score (nausea, early 
satiety , upper abd ominal pain, postprandial fullness) will be the primary  endpoint. Analysis will 
be based on a mixed model for repeated measurements (MMRM) with treatment, center, week, 
subject disease populat ion, and treatment -by-week interaction as fixed effects, baselin e and 
baseline score -by-week interacti on as covariates, with an unstructured covariance structure, if 
applicable . The po int-estimates, nominal p- values and confidence intervals (CIs) for the primary 
analysis will be based on the Week 12 statist ical compari sons between each of the 2TAK -906 
dose groups and placebo, with respect to the primary  endpo int. The 2statistical tests for the 
primary  efficacy  analysis are 1 -sided and will be conducted using a 5% level of significance. 
Nominal p -values will be evaluat ed for statist ical significance. In addit ion, point estimates and 
CIs al ong wi th descri ptive statist ics for change from baseline scores in ANMS GCSI -DD at 
earlier time points, will be presented. The MMRM -based analysis assumes that missing data 
followa missing -at-random (MAR) assumption. 
As a sensit ivity analysis, a method for missing value imputation based on pattern mixture models 
will be implemented.
13.1.3.2 Secondary Efficacy Analyses
For change from baseline in the cont inuous secondary  variables (ANMS GCSI -DD total score, 
ANMS GCSI -DD individual symptom score, A NMS GCSI -DD overall severit y of gastroparesi s 
symptoms score, bloating severit y scale score, and PAGI -SYM total  score), com parisons 
between different doses of TAK- 906 and placebo will be based on the s imilar methodology  
described for the primary  efficacy analysis. 
The proporti on of  subjects with at least 50% reduction from baseline in ANMS GCSI -DD 
composite score will  be analyzed at all t ime points by logist ic regressio n adjusting for baseline 
score, s ubject disease populat ion, and treatm ent using the l ast observat ion carri ed forward 
method to handle missing data. 
Percentage of symptomat ic weeks (weeks with symptoms assessed as >mild) using the ANMS 
GCSI -DD after 12 weeks of treatment will be analyzed using ANOVA wit h treatment, subject 
disease popul ation and center as fixed factors.

13.1.4 PK Analysis 
No formal noncom partm ental  PK analyses will be performed on concentration -time data. 
Individual concentration -time data will be included in list ings only. Addi tional analyses may  be 
conducted if deemed necessary  for the interpretation of the data.
A more detailed descript ion of these analyses will be given in a separate analysis plan. The 
resul ts from these analyses will not be included in the clinical study  report and will be a 
stand -alone report.
13.1.5 Other Analyses
The PGx samples will be stored and may  be analyzed at a l ater date, if required. A separate PGx 
analysis plan will be created.
13.1.6 Safety Analysis
Safety summaries will be based on the safet y set. 
13.1.6.1 AEs
AEs will be reported throughout the study .
The definit ion of treatment -emergent AEs will be provided in the SAP. AEs will be coded using 
MedDRA and will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term in the core treatment 
period and ent ire study .
AEs t hat were reported more than once by a subject during the same period will be counted only 
once for that subject and period at the maximum severit y.
13.1.6.2 Other Safety Evaluations
Absolute values and changes fro m screening/baseline in clinical safet y laboratory  tests, vital 
signs, ECG param eters, and wei ght will  be summari zed for each treatment group using 
descript ive techniques. Values outside reference ranges and markedly abnormal values will be 
flagged and tabulated.
13.2 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis o f efficacy data will be conducted.
Periodic interim safet y data reviews will be performed by  IDMC. Frequency  of IDMC safet y 
review meet ings and procedures to protect the study blinding will be documented fully in the 
IDMC charter.
In addit ion, blinded sample s ize re -estimation may be performed if the variance of the primary  
endpo int or study  dropout rate i s much l arger than ori ginally assumed.

13.3 Determination of Sample Size
In order to manage the likelihood of statist ical, clinical, and operational success of thi s study  in 
the setting of the COVID -19 pandemic, the sample- size consi derati ons are revisi ted in Protocol  
Amendment 8. The statistical testing is revised from 2 -sided (wi th a significance level o f 5%) to 
1-sided (wi th a significance l evel of 5%), the pl anned sample size is reduced by  10 subjects per 
arm and rando mizat ion into the 5 mg dose arm is to be discontinued. 
The sample -size rati onale for the resul tant reduced sample size and updated 1 -sided statistical 
testing is as fo llows: Assuming a SD of 1.25 a nd a true difference of 0.625 between TAK
-906M 
active dose and placebo in the change fro m baseline in the ANMS GCSI -DD com posite score, 
and a 15% dropout rate, a total of 205 subjects is sufficient to achieve approximately 80% power 
to detect the treatment effect of 0.625 at a 1 -sided 5% significance level. The total o f 
205subjects consists of approximately 25 subjects who have already been rando mized to receive 
5mg capsule BID prior to terminating rando mizat ion of subjects into the 5 mg dose arm, and 
60subjects per treatment groups of placebo, TAK -906M 25 mg, and TAK -906M 50 m g.
QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE 14.0
14.1 Study -Site Monitoring Visits
Moni toring visit s to the study  site will  be made peri odically  during the study  to ensure that all 
aspects of the protocol are fo llowed. Source documents will be reviewed for verificat ion of data 
recorded on the eCRFs. Source documents are defined as original documents, data, and records. 
The invest igator and the study site guarantee access to source documents by the sponsor or i ts 
designee (CRO) and by  the IRB or IEC.
All aspects of the study  and i ts docum entati on will be subject to review by the sponsor or 
sponsor’s designee (as long as blinding is not jeopardized), including but not limited to the 
Invest igator’s Binder , study  drug, subj ect m edical records, informed consent documentation and 
review of eCRFs and associated source documents. It is important that the invest igator and other 
study  personnel are available during the monitoring visits and that sufficient time is devoted to 
the process.
14.2 Protocol Deviations
The invest igator should not deviate fro m the protocol , except where necessary  to eliminate an 
immediate hazard to study  subjects. Shoul d other unexpected circumstances arise that will 
requi re deviat ion from protocol -specified procedures, the invest igator should consult with the 
sponsor or designee (and IRB or IEC, as required) to determine the appropriate course of act ion. 
There will be no exempt ions (a prospectively approved deviat ion) fro m the inclusi onor 
exclusio n criteria.
The site should document all protocol deviat ions in the subject’s source documents. In the event 
of an important devi ation, the si te shoul d notify the sponsor or its designee (and IRB or IEC, as 
requi red). Im portant devi ations inclu de, but are not limited to, th ose that invo lve fraud or

assessment.
14.3 Quality Assurance Audits and Regulatory Agency Inspections
The study  site also m ay be subject to qualit y assurance audi ts by  the sponsor or desi gnees. In this 
circumstance, the sponsor -designated audi tor will  contact the si te in advance to arrange an 
auditing visit. The auditor may ask to visit the facilit ies wher e laboratory  samples are collected, 
where the medication is stored and prepared, and any other facilit y used during the study . In 
addition, there is the possibilit y that thi s study  may be inspected by  regulatory  agencies, 
including those of foreign governm ents (eg, the FDA, European National Agencies). If the study  
site is contacted for an inspect ion by a regulatory  body , the sponsor shoul d be notified 
immediately. The investigator and study  site guarantee access for qualit y assurance auditors to 
all study  documents as described in Sect ion 14.1.
ETHICAL ASPECTS OF T HE STUDY 15.0
This study  will be conducted wi th the highest respect for the individual partic ipants (i e, subjects) 
according to the protocol, the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration o f 
Helsinki, and the ICH Harmonised Tripart ite Guideline for GCP. Each investigator will conduct 
the study  according to applicable local or re gional regul atory  requi rements and align his or her 
conduct in accordance with the “Responsibilit ies of the Invest igator” that are listed in 
Appendix F. The principles of Helsinki are addressed through the protocol and through 
appendices containing requirements for informed consent and invest igator responsibilit ies.
15.1 IRB and/or IEC Approval
IRBs and IECs must be constituted according to the applicable sta te and federal/local 
requi rements of each participating region. The sponsor or designee will require documentation 
noting all names and tit les of members who make up the respect ive IRB or IEC. If any member 
of the IRB or IEC has direct participat ion in thi s study , written notificat ion regarding his or her 
abstinence fro m voting must also be obtained. Those Americas sites unwilling to provide names 
and tit les of all members due to privacy  and conflict of interest concerns should instead provide a 
Federal Wid e Assurance Number or comparable number assigned by the Depart ment of Healt h 
and Human Services.
The sponsor or designee will supply relevant documents for submissio n to the respective IRB or 
IEC for the protocol’s review and approval. This protocol, the I B, a copy  of the inform ed consent 
form, and, if applicable, subject recruitment materials and/or advertisements and other 
docum ents requi red by all  applicable laws and regul ations, must be submitted to a central or 
local IRB or IEC for approval. The IRB’s or IEC’s written approval o f the protocol and subject 
inform ed consent m ust be obtained and submitted to the sponsor or designee before

confirmed the adequacy of site regulatory  docum entati on and, when applicable, the sponsor has 
received permissio n from competent authori ty to begin the study . Until the si te receives 
drug/notificat ion, no protocol act ivities, including screening may occur .
Study  sites m ust adhere to all requirements st ipulated by their respect ive IRB or IEC. This may 
include notificat ion to the IRB or IEC regarding protocol amendments, updates to the informed 
consent form, recruit ment materials intended for viewing by  subj ects, l ocal safety reporting 
requi rements, reports and updates regarding the ongoing review of the study  at intervals 
specified by the respective IRB or IEC, and submissio n of the investigator’s final status report to 
IRB or IEC. All IRB and IEC approvals and relevant documentation for these items must be 
provi ded to the sponsor or its designee.
Subject incentives should not exert undue influence for participat ion. Payments to subjects must 
be approved by the IRB or IEC and sponsor.
15.2 Subject Information, Inf ormed Consent, and Subject Authorization
Written consent documents will embody  the elements of informed consent as described in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and the ICH Guidelines for GCP and will be in accordance with all 
applicable laws and regulations. T he informed consent form describes the planned and permitted 
uses, transfers, and disclo sures of the subject’s personal and personal healt h informat ion for 
purposes of conduct ing the study. The informed consent form further explains the nature of the 
study , its obj ectives, and potential risks and benefit s, as well as the date informed consent are 
given. The informed consent form will detail the requirements of the participant and the fact that 
he or she is free to withdraw at any  time without giving a reaso n and wit hout prejudice to his or 
her further medical care.
The invest igator is responsible for the preparation, content, and IRB or IEC approval of the 
inform ed consent form  and if applicable, the subject authorization form. The informed consent 
form mustbe approved by both the IRB or IEC and the sponsor prior to use.
The informed consent form must be written in a language fully co mprehensible to the 
prospective subject. It is the responsibilit y of the investigator to explain the detailed elements of 
the informed consent form to the subject. Informatio n shoul d be given in both oral and written 
form whenever possible and in the manner deemed appropriate by  the IRB or IEC. In the event 
the subject i s not capable of rendering adequate written informed consent , then the subject’s 
legally acceptable representative may provide such consent for the subject in accordance wit h 
applicable laws and regulations.
The subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, must be given ample opportunity  
to: (1) inq uire about details of the study  and (2) deci de whether or not to participate in the study . 
If the subject, or the subject’s legally acceptable representative, determines he or she will 
participate in the study , then the informed consent form and subject auth orization form (if 
applicable) must be signed and dated by  the subject, or the subject’s legally  acceptable 
representative, at the time of consent and prior to the subject entering into the study . The subject 
or the subject’s legally acceptable represent ative should be instructed to sign using their legal 
names, not nicknames, using blue or black ballpo int ink. The invest igator must also sign and date

the informed consent form and subject authorizat ion (if applicable) at the time of consent and 
prior to s ubject entering into the study; however, the sponsor may allow a designee o f the 
investigator to sign to the extent permitted by  applicable law.
Once signed, the original informed consent form will be stored in the invest igator’s site file. The 
investigato r must docum ent the date the subject signs the informed consent in the subject’s 
medical record. Copies of the signed informed consent form shall be given to the subject.
All revised informed consent forms must be reviewed and signed by relevant subjects o r the 
relevant subject’s legally  acceptable representative in the same manner as the original informed 
consent. The date the revised consent was ob tained shoul d be recorded in the subject’s medical 
record, and the subject should receive a copy  of the revis ed informed consent form.
Subjects who consented and provided a PGx sample for DNA analysis can wit hdraw their 
consent and request disposal o f a stored sample at any time prior to analysis. Notify  sponsor of 
consent withdrawal.
15.3 Subject Confidentiality
The sponsor and designees affirm and upho ld the principle of the subject’s right to protection 
against invasio n of privacy. Throughout this study , a subject’s source data will only be linked to 
the sponsor’s clinical trial database or documentation via a subje ct ID number. As permitted by  
all applicable laws and regulat ions, limited subject attributes, such as sex, age, or date of birth 
and subject init ialsmay be used to verify  the subject and accuracy  of the subject’s unique ID 
number.
To com ply with ICH Gui delines for GCP and to verify co mpliance with this protocol, the 
sponsor requires the investigator to permit the monitor or the sponsor’s designee, representatives 
from any regulatory  authori ty (eg, FDA, European National Agencies), the sponsor’s designated
auditors, and the appropriate IRBs and IECs to review the subject’s original medical records 
(source data or documents), including, but not limited to, laboratory  test result reports, ECG 
reports, admissio n and discharge summaries for hospital admissio ns occurring during a subject’s 
study  participati on, and autopsy  reports. Access to a subject’s original medical records requires 
the specific authorizat ion of the subject as part of the informed consent process (see 
Secti on15.2).
Copi es of  any subject source documents that are provided to the sponsor must have certain 
personally ident ifiable informat ion rem oved (ie, subject name, address, and other iden tifier fields 
not collected on the subject’s eCRF).
15.4 Publication, Disclosure, and Clinical Trial Registration Policy
15.4.1 Publication and Disclosure
The invest igator is obliged to provide the sponsor with complete test results and all data derived 
by the investi gator f rom the study . During and after the study , only  the sponsor m ay make study  
inform ation available to other study  invest igators or to regulatory  agencies, except as required by

15.4.2 Clinical Trial Registration
To ensure that information on clinical trials reaches the public in a timely manner and to comply 
with applicable l aws, regul ations and guidance, Takeda will, at a minimum register all 
intervent ional clinical trials it sponsors anywhere in the world on ClinicalTrials.go v and/or other 
publicly  accessible websites before start of study , as defined in Takeda Policy/Standard. Takeda 
contact informat ion, along wi th invest igator’s cit y, state (for American invest igators), country, 
and recruit ing status will be registered and a vailable for public viewing. 
For some registries, Takeda will assist callers in lo cating study  sites cl osest to thei r homes by 
provi ding the invest igator name, address, and phone number to the callers request ing trial 
inform ation. Once subjects receive in vestigator contact informat ion, they  may call  the si te 
requesting enrollment into the trial. The invest igative sites are encouraged to handle the trial 
inquiries according to their established subject screening process. If the caller asks addit ional 
questi ons bey ond the topic of trial enro llment, they should be referred to the sponsor .
Any invest igator who objects to the sponsor providing this informat ion to callers must provide 
the sponsor with a written notice request ing that their informat ion not be lis ted on the registry  
site.
15.4.3 Clinical Trial Results Disclosure
Takeda will post the results of clinical trials on ClinicalTrials.gov and/or other publicly 
accessible websites, as required by Takeda Policy/Standard, applicable laws and/or regulat ions.
15.5 Insurance and Compensation for Injury
Each subject in the study  must be insured in accordance with the regulat ions applicable to the 
site where the subject is participat ing. If a local underwriter is required, then the sponsor or 
sponsor’s designee will ob tain clinical study  insurance against the risk of injury  to study  
subjects. Refer to the study  site agreement regarding the sponsor’s policy on subject 
compensat ion and treatment of injury. If the investigator has quest ions regarding this policy, he 
or she shoul d contact the sponsor or sponsor’s designee.

aSubjects will discontinue all medications to treat gastroparesis or the symptoms of gastroparesis. Treatment naïve subjects or subjects who have not been treated with prokinetics 
in the previous 2 weeks may proceed with Visit 2 after all laboratory results from Visit 1 have been evaluated. Subjects taking medications for gastroparesis that require washout
should retur n for Visit 2, 14 to 17 days after Visit 1. 
bSubjects requiring a washout period of their current gastroparesis medication(s) will use the 14+3 day window between Visit 1 and Visit 2. Treatment naïve subjects or subjects 
who have not been treated with prokinetics in the previous 2 weeks may return after receipt and evaluation of all Visit 1 study procedures (approximately 3 da ys).
cSubjects will complete Visit 3 once their GEBT results have been received and evaluated by the site (7±3 days from Visit 2). Subjects begin ANMS GCSI -DD.
dSubjects must be 80% compliant with the ePRO device for a minimum of 14 days between Visits 3 and 4.
eSubjects who withdraw prematurely will be seen for an early termination visit as soon as possible and will then be contac ted for a follow -up approximately 30 days (30±5 days) 
after the last dose of study medication. These subjects will continue entering the Daily Symptom Diary until the early termin ation visit. 
fA safety follow -up phone call will be made approximately 30 days after last dose of study medication.
gInformed consent must be signed before any study -specific procedures are performed.
hAll physical examinations (including assessment of the extrapyram idal system) are to be performed by the investigator, subinvestigator, or a qualified healthcare professional. 
Assessment of the extrapyramidal system should be performed by a healthcare professional qualified to perform this assessment using the guidance provided by Takeda. Subjects 
with any abnormalities will be referred for appropriate medical consultation and AEs should be reported as per AE reporting p rocedures provided in Section 10.0 of this protocol.
iVital signs (eg, oral/tympanic/axillary temperature, respiration, pulse, and blood pressure) will be assessed at Visit 1 (Day -35), and predose at Visit 4 (Day 1), and onward at 
Visit 5 (Week 4), Visit 6 (Week 8), and Visit 7 (Week 12) on those visit days requiring study dosing, and at early termination. Vital signs should be measured after 5 minutes 
resting in the supine or semi -supine position and consistently for each subject. When the timing o f the vital signs coincides with a blood collection, vital signs should be obtained 
before the nominal time of the blood collection and before the study medication is taken.
jHeight and weight are measured, and BMI is calculated at initial screening visit only. Weight only is measured at subsequent visits. 
kSubject should have rested in supine or semisupine position for at least 5 minutes before ECG. When the timing of these measu rements coincides with a blood collection, the 
ECG should be obtained befor e the nominal time of the blood collection. Triplicate tracings of ECGs should be performed. ECG will be assessed at Visit 1 (Day -35), and 
approximately 1 to 2 hours postdose at Visit 4 (Day 1), Visit 5 (Week 4), Visit 6 (Week 8), and Visit 7 (Week 12) on those visit days requiring study dosing, and at early 
termination.
lClinical laboratory tests (chemistry, hematology) will be assessed at Visit 1 (Day -35), and predose at Visit 4 (Day 1), and onward at Visit 5 (Week 4), Visit 6 (Week 8), and Visit

mFor women of child -bearing potential. Must be confirmed negative by serum hCG at screening and by urine hCG before medication dispensing at rand omization and study visits.
nOnsite end of study pregnancy test m ust be performed for subjects with menstrual irregularities, variable menstrual cycle length by more than ±5 days or missed last menstrual 
period by more than 5 days.
oFSH level will be obtained for female subjects at screening if they are postmenopausal by history (eg, defined as at least 1 year since last regular menses with an FSH >40 IU/mL 
or at least 5 years since last regular menses, confirmed before any study medication is implemented) and not surgically steri le. The FSH result must be >40 IU/mL for the subject 
to be permitted not to use adequate contraception.
pSubjects will take their first dose of study medication at the randomization visit. Subjects will take their morning dose in clinic at Visits 5, 6, and 7. Subjects will be instructed to 
take medication 1 dose in the morning approximately 1 hour before the first meal of the day and another dose in the evening approximately 1 hour before the main last meal of the 
day, at a regular dose interval. If a subject missed any individual dose, they may take the dose within a 4- hour window from the normal expected dosage time. If not taken within a 
4-hour window, they should not take that dose and proceed to take the normal dose at the next scheduled time point.

-Spirulina GEBT, which is pr eceded by test meal. An 8 -hour fast is required prior to the GEBT test meal. GEBT is not required for subjects who have confirmed 
delayed gastric emptying by an accepted diagnostic method (scintigraphy, GEBT, or wireless motility capsule) that is document ed in the subject’s medical records prior to 
screening. 
rThe Daily Study Diary is inclusive of: Daily Symptom Diary (including ANMS -GCSI -DD plus bloating severity scale), daily dosing, and meal time recordings, and capture of 
rescue medication use. Compli ance with the daily completion of the Daily Symptom Diary, defined ≥80% diary completions, from the 2 -week symptom assessment period (Day -
14 to randomization; +3 -day window). Diary should be completed daily at approximately the same time each day (evening ) in e -format with the ePRO device. 
sThe sample for PGx may be drawn before dosing on Day 1.
tPK: Subjects will be asked to take their morning dose of study medication at the clinic when PK samples are being collected. The blood samples for PK analysis will collected on 
Day1, Weeks 4, 8, 12 at the following time -points: Day 1: predose sample, Week 4: predose and 1 postdose sample at 0.5 -1 h window, Week 8: predose and 1 postdose sample at 
1-3 h window and Week 12: predose and 2 postdose samples at 0.5 - 1 hand 2 -4 h window or immediately before leaving the clinic, respectively. One blood sample will be 
collected at early termination. The actual date and times of all PK blood draws will be recorded for each subject on the eCRF s. The actual dates and times of the dose 
administration in the clinic should be recorded. PK sampling may be performed during unscheduled visits.
uSamples for prolactin measurement to be collected and analyzed as part of clinical laboratory evaluations at Visit 1, at sche duled Visits 4 to 7, and any necessary unscheduled 
visit. A high screening prolactin level at screening visit 1, which is considered to be due to stress of venipuncture, chest wall stimulation, or other physiological causes, may be 
retested at Visits 2 or 3. Then, if prolactin levels are normal or falling within the allowable range, the subjects may be enrolled in the study. A subset of sam ples may be used for 
prolactin assay bridging studies as needed. As TAK -906 may  increase serum prolactin levels, investigators will be blinded to prolactin measurements beginning with Visit 4. In 
cases where investigators request unblinding of the study treatment or serum prolactin level, the subject must be withdrawn f rom the study immediately.
vSAEs will be collected from the time the subject signs an informed consent form through the duration of the study up to 30 days post –end of treatment. All nonserious AEs, in 
addition to SAEs, are collected from the first dosing through 30 days post –end of treatment.

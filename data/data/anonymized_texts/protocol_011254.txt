Abatacept  6 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  A phase I/II trial of Abatacept (Orencia) in the 
treatment of refractory non -infectious uveitis.  
Site Numbers & Names:  1 Site  
Research Hypothesis:  Among subjects with uveitis that are refractory to 
conventional immunosuppressive therapy , abatacept is a 
safe and effective treatment  and a decreased dose is 
effective for maintenance of therapy . 
Study Rationale  The majority of n on-infectious  uveitis cases are  thought to 
be immune -mediated, possibly triggered by environmental 
stimuli and mediated primarily by T -cells in patients with an 
immunogenetic predisposition. The implication of cell -
mediated immunity in the pathogenesis of uveitis has 
provided a  rationale for treatment with immunosuppressive 
medications such as corticosteroids, which have been 
shown to be effective in improving the signs and 
symptoms of ocular inflammation, as well as the prognosis 
for preservation of visual acuity. The well -know n side 
effects of chronic corticosteroid therapy, however, have led 
ophthalmologists to employ corticosteroid -sparing agents 
to reduce the toxicity of long term corticosteroid use. 
Continuing effort is underway to identify more effective 
therap ies, which w ould ideally focus on targeting the action 
of specific mediators of the immune response, allowing for 
increased efficacy and decreased side effects of 
treatment.  
Study Objectives:  
Primary:  
Secondary:   
To assess the safety of the study drug in patients with 
refractory, non -infectious uveitis . 
To assess the efficacy of the study drug in the treatment of 
subjects with refractory, non -infectious uveitis.  
Study Design:  This is a  randomized, controlled, dose -modification,  phase 
I/II, prospective clinical trial to examine the safety and 
efficacy of abatacept in treatment of uveitis.   
Study Schema  
Drugs / Doses /   
Length of Treatment)  Subjects will receive approximately 10 mg/kg abatacept 
infusions at Day 1, Day 15, Day 30 and then  every 4 
weeks for 6 months .Subjects will be randomized 
subsequently to receive either 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg dose s 
every four weeks,  and will continue receiving infusions for 
up to 2 years.  
 
Abatacept   7 Accrual Goal:  
(Total number of subject s) 20 subjects with non -infectious uveitis refractory to

a higher chance of getting a serious infection if you 
take ORENCIA with other biologic medicines.  
 
Abatacept   9 Criteria for Evaluation:  
(Efficacy, safety,  
stopping rules, etc.)  Safety assessments will be done at every visit including 
inquiring about systemic or ocular  adverse events. Blood 
work and chest x -rays will be done as required for the 
study drug.   The following clinical assessments will provide 
outcome data at scr eening,  week 12, 24,,52, 76, and at 2 
year study closure: Fl uorescein Angiography, Ocular 
Coherence Tomography, graded assessment of anterior 
and posterior segment ocular inflammation, Best 
Corrected Visual Acuity, and patient and physic ian 
assessments of well -being utilizing Visual Analog Scale s.  
Statistics:  Safety measures will be assessed at every visit.  At week s 
12, 24, 52, 76, and at study closure  clinical efficacy will be 
assessed and compared to baseline values. If the subject 
is deemed a non -responder at this assessment, the 
subject will exit the study. For subjects who respond 
positively to treatment, clinical efficacy data will be 
collected at  week 12, 24,  52, 76 and 104 and  will be 
compared to the baseline values.   The primary efficacy 
endpoint will be at 52 weeks.  
 
Abatacept   10 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Research Hypothesis  
Abatacept is a safe and effective treatment  for subjects with  uveitis refractory to 
conventional  immunosuppressive therapy , and after induction with higher dose therapy 
(10 mg/kg/dose), will be able to be  safely and effective ly managedwith  maintenance 
therapy at 5 mg/kg/dose in these subjects.  
1.2 Product Development Rationale  
Abatacept is a recombinant  fusion protein consisting of the extracellular domain of 
human CTLA (cytotoxic T -lymphocyte antigen) 4 and a hinge fragment of the CH2 -CH3 
portions of the Fc domain of human IgG1 that has been modified to prevent complement 
fixation and antibody -dependent  cellular cytotoxicity.  
Abatacept is the first drug in a new class of agents termed “selective costimulation 
modulators.” Abatacept binds specifically to the CD80 and CD86 molecules, proteins 
prominently displayed on the surface of antigen -presenting cells  (APCs). Activation of 
naive T -lymphocytes, also termed T -cells, during an immune response requires two 
stimuli from APCs. The first signal is antigen -specific; antigens are presented by APCs, 
with the signal transmitted to the T -cell through the T -cell’s antigen receptor. The 
second, or costimulatory, signal is not antigen -specific and is delivered following the 
engagement of a costimulatory ligand on the APC with a cognate receptor on the T -cell. 
A key costimulatory receptor on T -cells is CD28. CD28 is co nstitutively expressed on 
resting T -cells and binds to both CD80 (B7 -1) and CD86 (B7 -2) on the APC.1,2,3,4 A 
costimulatory signal is required not only for the full activation of naive T -cells, but also 
may be required for the survival of memory and autoimm une effector cells.5,6 In the 
presence of CD28, successful costimulation may occur, leading to T -cell activation.  
When modulation of the T -cell activation is required, one operative mechanism is to 
reduce costimulation via expression of CTLA4 on the surfa ce of T -lymphocytes.  CTLA -
4expression, which may begin 24 to 48 hours following initial T -cell activation,  
successfully interferes with CD28’s ability to bind to its ligands on the APC; CD80 and 
CD86 preferentially bind to CTLA4 with a much higher avidit y than with CD28. 
Although the precise mechanisms are as yet unclear, CTLA4 expression is associated 
with a decrease in T -cell activation. After the T -cell activity has been dampened, the 
CTLA4 recycles into the T  cell’s cytoplasm.   
 
Abatacept   11 The CTLA4 section of a batacept binds specifically to CD80 and CD86 (B7 -1 and B7 -2, 
respectively) and down -modulates the CD28 -mediated costimulation of T -cells. Thus, 
abatacept uses a segment of a molecule that is part of the normal immune homeostatic 
mechanism to suppress T -cell activity involved in the immunopathogenesis of 
autoimmune diseases. The Fc region of abatacept was engineered with several point 
mutations designed to inactivate it. Because of these changes, abatacept does not mediate 
pathways such as antibody -dependent  cell cytotoxicity or complement -dependent 
cytotoxicity.7 
1.2.1  Overview of Uveitis  
The term uveitis is used clinically to describe a heterogeneous group of diseases having 
in common inflammation of intraocular structures. Despite accounting for <1% of ocular 
disease in most clinical settings, uveitis accounts for 10 -15% of legal blindness in some 
series, and as many as a third of patients affected with the more severe manifestations of 
uveitis are blinded in series reported from tertiary centers8.  In addition , uveitis 
disproportionately affects a younger population compared to more prevalent blinding 
diseases such as glaucoma and macular degeneration, leading to loss of a 
disproportionately high number of productive person -years to society.  Therefore, despite  
its relative uncommonness, uveitis is a significant public health problem.  
Although frequently associated with systemic inflammatory or autoimmune diseases such 
as sarcoidosis, multiple sclerosis, Behçet's disease, and the seronegative 
spondylarthropathie s, a significant number of cases defy disease classification and are 
labeled idiopathic.  In many such cases, disease may be limited to the eye.  In general, 
non-infectious cases of uveitis are thought to represent immune -mediated disease, 
possibly trigger ed by environmental stimuli and mediated primarily by T -cells in patients 
with an immunogenetic predisposition.9,10 
The implication of cell -mediated immunity in the pathogenesis of uveitis has provided a 
rationale for treatment with immunosuppressive medic ations such as corticosteroids, 
which have been shown to be effective in improving the signs and symptoms of ocular 
inflammation, as well as the prognosis for preservation of visual acuity.11  The well -
known side effects of chronic corticosteroid therapy, however, have led ophthalmologists 
to employ corticosteroid -sparing agents to reduce the toxicity associated with long term 
corticosteroid use.  Unfortunately, each of these agents may be associated with 
undesirable toxicity.12  Continuing  effort is underway to identify more effective therapy, 
 
Abatacept   12 which would ideally focus on targeting the action of specific mediators of the immune 
response, allowing for increased efficacy and decreased side effects of treatment. 
1.3 Summary of Results of Investiga tional Program  
The initial efficacy and safety of abatacept (previously known as CTLA4 -Ig and 
BMS -188667) was established in clinical studies of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) , psoriasis, 
and multiple sclerosis. Currently, there are no active registrational stu dies for psoriasis or 
multiple sclerosis. The subsequent registrational program was in juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (JIA), with data being collected from the ongoing long -term extension portion. 
Current active registrational programs for abatacept include  studies in systemic lupus 
erythematosus (SLE) including lupus nephritis, and psoriatic arthritis.  
A full development program conducted in adult RA led to regulatory approval in the 
United States for this indication in December  2005, in Canada in June  2006 , and in 
Europe in May  2007. In the US, abatacept now has two indications: (1) treatment of 
moderate to severe active RA in adults, and (2) treatment of moderate to severe (JIA  in 
patients who have failed prior therapy with disease -modifying anti -rheumatic  drugs 
(DMARDs).   There are no reported or registered studies of abatacept for the treatment of 
inflammatory eye diseases, although many of the above noted diseases may cause ocular 
inflammation, providing a rationale for studying this indication.  
1.3.1  Immunog enicity Experience with Abatacept  
In the RA program, the frequency of development of anti -abatacept antibodies (ie, 
immunogenicity) was examined in 2337 subjects. Among all subjects, 62 of 2337 (2.8%) 
developed antibodies to abatacept. Overall, there was n o apparent correlation of antibody 
development to clinical response or adverse events. However, the number of subjects that 
developed antibodies was too limited to make a definitive assessment. The potential 
clinical relevance of neutralizing antibody form ation is not known.13,14 
1.4 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment  
Existing data exists on the safety or efficacy of abatacept for patients with inflammatory 
eye disease  is limited to small case reports; however ; The published experience in 
patients with other immun e-mediated diseases is instructive , and will be discussed below . 
In 2010, Zulian and colleagues reported a series of 7 children with juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis and uveitis, all of whom had failed therapy with multiple standard 
immunosuppresssives and TN F blockers, and noted six treatment successes using 
monthly intravenous abatacept.   A respondent to this publication in February 2011 added 
 
Abatacept   13 two other successfully treated patients, along with a single case report of one successful 
case in 2008.15, 16  In the past decade, the development of biologic DMARDs such as 
TNF - inhibitors, along with other advances and new insights into rheumatoid disease 
progression, have led to a re -evaluation of management of RA to include earlier use of 
DMARD and combination DMA RD therapy  to limit the occurrence of functionally 
significant complications.  Similarly , early aggressive therapy of inflammatory eye 
disease may limit the occurrence of visually significant complications . The efficacy, 
tolerability, and safety profile of  abatacept was demonstrated in the RA  clinical 
development program. Abatacept, a biologic DMARD with a unique mechanism of 
action, has demonstrated a good efficacy/safety profile. Abatacept has been on the market 
in the US  since January  2006 and in Europe since May  2007.  
The major identified risk of abatacept is an increased incidence of infections. The 
abatacept RA program identified both non -serious and serious infections, mainly 
bacterial (upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonias) and viral (herpes  simplex), as 
occurring more frequently in abatacept -treated subjects than in subjects on placebo.  Most 
infections responded appropriately to treatment, and no major differences in outcome 
were apparent between abatacept and placebo. The risk for serious i nfections did not 
increase with increasing exposure in the open -label periods of the clinical studies.  
The effect of increasing exposure on the risk of serious infections was assessed by 
comparing the incidence rate of serious adverse events in the “infect ions and infestations” 
classification over the cumulative double -blind and open -label study periods  (10,365 
person -years) with that observed during the double -blind study periods alone 
(1688  person -years). This analysis revealed that that the incidence per  100 person -years 
(double -blind versus cumulative) remained stable for serious infections  
(3.47  versus  2.98).17 Opportunistic infections and tuberculosis (TB) were uncommon, 
although all subjects were screened for latent TB.  
The overall risk of malignancy for abatacept -treated subjects was comparable to that of 
placebo -treated subjects during the double -blind periods. The effect of increasing 
duration of exposure on the risk of malignancy was assessed by comparing the incidence  
rates of malignancies (per 10 0 person -years) in the cumulative double -blind and open -
label study periods (10,365  person -years as of December  2007) with that observed during 
the double -blind study periods alone (1688  person years). This analysis revealed that the 
incidence per 100  person-years (double -blind versus cumulative) remained stable for 
malignancies overall, excluding non -melanomatous skin cancer (0.59 versus 0.71). More 
specifically, the incidence rates for lung cancer (0.24 versus 0.16) and lymphoma (0.06 
 
Abatacept   14 versus 0.07) remaine d stable. In addition, in double -blind and cumulative study periods, 
the incide nce rate of malignancy (per 100  person -years) for abatacept -treated subjects 
was similar to that seen in the double -blind placebo group and RA cohort overall and for 
major categ ories (skin, solid, hematologic). Clinical presentation and incidence over time 
do not suggest increased risk with abatacept.18 
Treatment with abatacept was associated with an excellent peri -infusional safety profile 
and a low level of immunogenicity. In t he only existing study evaluating the safety and 
efficacy of abatacept or infliximab versus placebo (IM101 -043, the ATTEST study), the 
safety and  tolerability results through 1  year suggest that abatacept may have  a superior  
safety and tolerability profile .19   
In summary, the potential overall benefit/risk ratio for abatacept -treated patients in this 
study appears to be favorable. The risks are probably no worse than those of infliximab 
therapy, which has been extensively studied in inflammatory eye diseas e, and may be 
superior.  To minimize the overall risk to participating patients, this protocol has 
inclusion and exclusion criteria appropriate to the population and proposed treatments, 
exclusionary screening tests, and specific follow up safety assessmen ts. In addition, the 
adverse events and serious adverse events will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by the 
medical monitors and pharmacovigilance group to detect trends and any potential safety 
issues.  
1.5 Study Rationale  
As noted previously, n on-infectious cases of uveitis are thought to represent immune -
mediated disease, possibly triggered by environmental stimuli and mediated primarily by 
T-cells in patients with an immunogenetic predisposition. The implication of cell -
mediated immunity in th e pathogenesis of uveitis has provided a rationale for treatment 
with immunosuppressive medications such as corticosteroids, which have been shown to 
be effective in improving the signs and symptoms of ocular inflammation, as well as the 
prognosis for pres ervation of visual acuity. The well -known side effects of chronic 
corticosteroid therapy, however, have led ophthalmologists to employ corticosteroid -
sparing agents to reduce the toxicity associated with long term corticosteroid use. 
Continuing effort is u nderway to identify more effective therapy, which would ideally 
focus on targeting the action of specific mediators of the immune response, allowing for 
increased efficacy and decreased side effects of treatment.  
 
Abatacept   15 2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
2.1 Primary Objective  
To assess the safety of the study drug in this patient population , ascertained by tracking 
the type, frequency, severity, and relationship of ad verse events during study treatment, 
and where possible, determining whether or not a causal link exists between th e event 
and study therapy.  
 
2.2 Secondary Objectives  
 To assess the efficacy of the study drug in the treatment of subjects with refractory, non -
infectious uveitis  and to assess the efficacy of a reduced dose as maintenance therapy .   
Refractory disease is def ined as that which is unable to be successfully treated by 
corticosteroids and at least one “standard” immunosuppressive, or when toxicity makes 
such therapy untenable.  
Efficacy of the study drug will be assessed using a  composite clinical endpoint  
compr ised of 4 criteria.  Treatment will be judged to be successful if there is 
improvement in at least one of these criteria without significant worsening in any of 
them.  These criteria include:  
 Improvement by 2 or more lines of best -corrected ETDRS or Snelle n visual acuity 
in at least one eye   
 Reduction in dose of systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy  
by at least 50%  
 Control of ocular inflammation, as judged on clinical criteria, according to 
standard methods  
o Reduction of anterior chamber  cellular activity and/or vitreous haze by 2 
grades, and to a level of trace or less  (SUN)  
o Reduction of chorioretinal infiltrates  or reduction of retinal vasculitis 
(documented by fundus photography  and fluorescein angiography ) 
 Reduction of cystoid macular  edema  and/or retinal inflammation , as judged 
clinically and by fluorescein angiogram and/or optical coherence tomography.  
 
 
Abatacept   16 3 ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
3.1 Good Clinical Practice  
This study will be conducted in accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), as 
defin ed by the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) and in accordance with 
the ethical principles underlying European Union Directive 2001/20/EC and the United 
States Code of Federal Regulations, Title  21, Part  50 (21CFR50).  
The study will be conduct ed in compliance with the protocol. The protocol, any 
amendments, and the subject informed consent will receive Institutional Review 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/IEC) approval/favorable opinion before 
initiation of the study.  
All potential serio us breaches must be reported to Bristol -Myers  Squibb (BMS) 
immediately. A serious breach is a breach of the conditions and principles of GCP in 
connection with the study or the protocol, which is likely to affect, to a significant degree, 
the safety or phy sical or mental integrity of the subjects of the study or the scientific 
value of the study.  
Study personnel involved in conducting this study will be qualified by education, 
training, and experience to perform their respective tasks. This study will not u se the 
services of study personnel where sanctions have been invoked or where there has been 
scientific misconduct or fraud (eg, loss of medical licensure; debarment). Systems with 
procedures that ensure the quality of every aspect of the study will be imp lemented.

Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable 
opinion from the IRB/IEC for the protocol, consent form, subject recruitment 
materials/process (eg, a dvertisements), and any other written information to be provided 
to subjects. The investigator should also provide the IRB/IEC with a copy of the 
Investigator Brochure or product labeling, information to be provided to subjects, and any 
updates. The invest igator should provide the IRB/IEC with reports, updates, and other 
information (eg, expedited safety reports, amendments, and administrative letters) 
according to regulatory requirements or institution procedures.  
3.3 Informed Consent  
Investigators must ensure  that subjects (or, in those situations where consent cannot be 
given by subjects, the legally acceptable representative) are clearly and fully informed 
about the purpose, potential risks, and other critical issues regarding clinical studies in 
which they volunteer to participate. Freely given written informed consent must be 
obtained from every subject (or, in those situations where consent cannot be given by 
subjects, the legally acceptable representative) before clinical study participation, 
including in formed consent for any screening procedures conducted to establish subject 
eligibility for the study.  
The rights, safety, and well -being of the study subjects are the most important 
considerations and should prevail over interests of science and society.  
For minors, according to local legislation, one or both parents or a legally acceptable 
representative must be informed of the study procedures and must sign the informed 
consent form approved for the study before clinical study participation. The explicit wish 
of a minor who is capable of forming an opinion and assessing this information to refuse 
participation in, or to be withdrawn from, the clinical study at any time, should be 
considered by the investigator. Minors who are judged to be of an age of reas on must also 
give their written assent.  
4 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
4.1 Study Design and Duration  
This is a  single -center, randomized, , dose -ranging , prospective clinical trial to examine 
the safety and efficacy of abatacept in treatment of refractory uveitis.  Subj ects will 
 
Abatacept   18 receive 10 mg/kg intravenous infusions at Day 1, Day 15, Day 30 and every 4 weeks for 
6 months, then subjects will be randomized to receive either 5 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg 
infusions every 4 weeks for up to 1.5 years  after to ascertain the effectivenes s of the 
lower dose in maintaining control of inflammation .  Subjects will undergo efficacy 
assessments at weeks 12, 24 , 52, 76, and 104  and non -responder s will be removed from 
the study.    
The study will be split into 2 segments.  The first segment will b e Weeks 0 through 24 in 
which the subjects will receive the standard , validated  dose of 10 mg/kg and will undergo 
graded outcome assessments along with receiving study drug.  Upon completion of the 
first segment, subjects will be randomized to continue rec eiving study drug masked at 
either the standard dose of 10 mg/kg or at a reduced dose of 5 mg/kg.  Subjects may 
continue receiving infusions for an additional 1.5 years.After week 52, the subject will be 
followed as clinically necessary by the physician  and will be seen for study grading visits 
at week 76 and week 104 .  Concomitant medication exclusion criteria will still need to be 
followed during this period.  
Due to  the inherent heterogeneity among this patient group, it is impractical to utilize a 
single  primary end -point to assess effectiveness of the treatment.  Different patients are 
expected to show improvements in different aspects of the clinical assessments, which we 
would expect to be captured by use of the composite endpoint utilized in this tria l.  It is 
because of this heterogeneity that we will enroll 20 subjects who would be expected to 
have a broad variety of autoimmune uveiti des including the following : sarcoidosis, 
idiopathic intermediate, idiopathic posterior, idiopathic panuveitis, birdsh ot 
chorioretinopathy, pars planitis tubulointerstitial nephritis and uveitis (TINU), Vogt -
Koyanagi -Harada syndrome (VKH), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), multifocal 
choroiditis, retinal vasculitis, and sympathetic ophthalmia.  
A detailed description of  procedures and timelines can be found in Section 6.  
4.2 Study Population

study described to them, and they will be given a written informed consent 
 
Abatacept   19 document to read. Then, if subjects consent to participate in the study, th ey will 
indicate that consent by signing and dating the informed consent document in the 
presence of study personnel.  
2) Target Population  
1. Patients with vision -threatening autoimmune uveitis.

5 TREATMENTS  
5.1 Study Treatment : Abatacept  
An invest igational product, also known as investigational medicinal product in some 
regions, is defined as follows: A pharmaceutical form of an active substance or placebo 
being tested or used as a reference in a clinical study, including products already with a 
marketing authorization but used or assembled (formulated or packaged) in a way 
different from the authorized form, or used for an unauthorized indication, or when used 
to gain further information about the authorized form. In this protocol, the investigatio nal 
product is abatacept.  
Other medications used in the study as support or escape medication for preventative, 
diagnostic, or therapeutic reasons as components of a given standard of care are 
considered noninvestigational products. In this protocol, nonin vestigational products 
include prednisone and other systemic immunosuppressives such as methotrexate, 
azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine, and chlorambucil.  
 
Abatacept   23 5.1.1  Identification  
Abatacept  (ORENCIA®) is supplied as a 250 mg/vial sterile, white, preservative -free, 
lyophilized powder for parenteral administration. Following reconstitution with 10 mL of 
Sterile Water for Injection, USP, the solution is clear, colorless to pale yellow, with a p H 
range of 7.0 to 8.0.  
Product : Abatacept for Injection (Abatacept = BMS -188667 + CTLA4Ig)  
Potency : 250 mg/vial  
Appearance : White to off -white, whole or fragmented cake in a vial  
In addition, Norm -Ject® non -siliconized syringes and in -line filters will be supplied. 
Each investigator will be responsible for supplying any intravenous admixture solutions 
(Sterile Water for Injection, 5% Dextrose in Water Injection, 0.9% Sodium chloride 
Injection) needed for the reconstitution and dilution of investigational pr oduct identified 
in the protocol.  
5.1.2  Storage, Handling, and Dispensing  
The investigational product should be stored in a secure area according to local 
regulations. The investigator is responsible for ensuring that it is dispensed only to study 
subjects and o nly from official study sites by authorized personnel, as dictated by local 
regulations.  
All investigational product supplies that will be used in the study must be maintained 
securely under the direct responsibility of the investigator or delegated by the  investigator 
to the hospital pharmacist, or other personnel licensed to store and dispense drugs. All 
drugs shall be dispensed in accordance with the investigator’s responsibility to ensure 
that an accurate record of drugs issued and returned is maintaine d. 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that the investigational product is stored 
under the appropriate environmental conditions (temperature, light, and humidity), as 
determined by the sponsor and defined by the Investigator Brochure or SmPC/ ref erence 
label. If concerns regarding the quality or appearance of the investigational product arise, 
do not dispense the investigational product and contact the sponsor immediately. Care 
should be taken when handling the injectable drug products that are us ed in this protocol. 
Proper aseptic techniques must be used when preparing and administering sterile 
parenteral products such as abatacept. Parenteral drug products should be inspected 
visually for particulate matter prior to administration. Refer to the I nvestigator Brochure 
for additional information regarding handling, preparation, and storage of abatacept.  
 
Abatacept   24 5.1.3  Additional Information for the Handling, Dispensing, and Storage 
of Abatacept  
A pharmacist or qualified personnel at the site will reconstitute the drug for intravenous 
(IV) administration. All reconstitution and dilutions must be performed using 
polypropylene nonsiliconized syringes (Norm -Ject®) manufactured by Henke Sass Wolf 
in Germany (to be provided by BMS).  
NOTE: A separate needle and syringe must be used for each vial reconstituted.  
Abatacept vials are sealed under vacuum. If any vials are found without this vacuum, 
they should be segregated and not used. These vials must be r etained until reconciliation 
by your Study Drug Monitor.  
NOTE: The vial should NOT be vented prior to reconstitution. To avoid foam formation 
following the addition of SWFI (Sterile Water for Injection), the vial should be gently 
swirled until the contents  are completely dissolved. Upon complete dissolution of the 
lyophilized powder, the vial should then be vented with a needle to dissipate any foam 
that may be present.  
Each vial of abatacept for injection, 250  mg/vial, should be reconstituted with 10  mL of  
Sterile Water for Injection (without bacteriostatic agent)  to yield a concentration of 
25 mg/mL. In order to minimize foaming, the stream of SWFI should be directed to the 
sides of the vial.  
A sufficient excess of abatacept is incorporated into each vial to account for withdrawal 
losses so that 10  mL of the reconstituted solution containing 250  mg can be withdrawn 
for parenteral administration. After reconstitution of the product the solution must be 
diluted further with 5% Dextrose in Water Injection (D5W ) or 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
(Normal Saline). For all doses the final total volume for infusion is 100  mL. 
The continuous infusion solution must be filtered upon administration using an in line, 
sterile, non -pyrogenic, low protein -binding filter with a pore s ize of 1.2  μm. This infusion 
should be administered in a fixed volume of 100  mL ov er a period of not less than 
30 minutes. Any unused portion of the infusion solution should not be stored for reuse.  
No data is available on the compatibility of abatacept wi th other intravenous substances. 
Abatacept should be administered in a separate intravenous line whenever possible and 
not mixed with other medications. Assure adequate and appropriate flushing between any 
other drug substances if other drugs are administe red through the same line sequentially. 
No incompatibilities have been observed with glass bottles or polyvinyl chloride bags and 
 
Abatacept   25 administration sets. Care must be taken to assure sterility of the prepared solution, as the 
drug product does NOT contain any  antimicrobial preservatives or bacteriostatic agents. 
Vials of abatacept for injection, 250  mg/vial, should be stored under refrigeration (28°C) 
and should be protected from long -term exposure to light. Intact vials are stable for at 
least one year under these conditions.  
All dilutions of abatacept for injec tion must be used within the 24  hours after 
reconstitution of the original vial.  
 Specific stability guidelines for each dilution are as follows:  
 Reconstituted abatacept for injection, 25 mg/mL, may be s tored at temperatures from 
15°- 25°C and room light or at refrigeration (2° -8°C) for up to 24 hours in the original 
vial. 
 Dilutions of reconstituted abatacept for injection from 1  to 25  mg/mL in NS or D5W 
in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or non -PVC IV bags may be stored at temperatures from 
15°-25°C and room light or at refrigerati on (2° -8°C) for no more than 24  hours from 
the time of initial reconstitution.  
 Diluted solutions of abatacept for injection are compatible with standard PVC IV 
infusion sets.  
5.2 Drug Acco untability  
Please refer to Section  9.2 (Records Retention) for details on drug accountability 
requirements.  
5.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject  
During the first 24 weeks, all s ubjects will receive  approximately 10 mg/kg calculated 
based on the  patient’s body weight at each administration , rounded to the nearest 25 mg.   
 
Abatacept will  be administered as a  30-minute intravenous infusion. Following the initial 
administration, abatacept will be given at 2 and 4 weeks after the first infusion and ever y 
4 weeks thereafter  for up to 2 years . Any  unuse d portions in the vials must be 
immediately discarded . 
 
After the 24 week infusion, subjects who have responded to treatment will be randomized 
to receive either the standard 10 mg/kg dose or a reduced dose of 5 mg/kg, rounded to the 
nearest 25 mg.  
 
5.3.1  Dose Modifications in the Absence of Adverse Events  
In the absence of adverse events deemed at least possibly related to abatacept, subjects 
will complete their scheduled infusions as prescribed per protoco l. For visits scheduled 
 
Abatacept   26 for Day  15 and Day  29, the dose may be administered within 72  hours (±  3 days) before 
or after the target date to adjust for the subject’s or site personnel’s convenience. For all 
subsequent doses, a window of ±  7 days is acceptable . 
5.3.2  Dose Modifications for Adverse Events  
If there is evidence of toxicity, as determined by laboratory tests or by clinical assessment 
that could place the subject at increased risk in the judgment of the investigator, 
administration of abatacept should be interrupted and the investigator should notify BMS. 
Subjects may be considered eligible to continue with abatacept treatment only if full 
resolution of the adverse event is documented. If the adverse event completely resolves 
and the next dose of abatacept  cannot be administered within 14  days of the target date, 
then that scheduled dose should be skipped. The next dose of abatacept should then be 
administered on the next targeted day for administration.  
5.4 Concomitant Treatments  
5.4.1  Prohibited and/or Restricted T reatments  
The following medications are prohibited throughout the complete study period:  
 Any biologic DMARD (such as but not limited to: anakinra, infliximab, etanercept, 
adalimumab, rituximab or any other investigational biologic).  
 Cyclophosphamide, Cyclo sporine  
 Live vaccines.  
 Use of any investigational drug other than study medication.  
5.4.2  Other Restrictions and Precautions  
5.4.2.1  Immunizations  
There is limited information available regarding the effectiveness of immunizations in 
non-human primates and humans that h ave been treated with abatacept. Limited data are 
available on the effect of therapeutic vaccinations in subjects receiving abatacept.  
Due to the risk of infection, vaccination of subjects with any live vaccine is absolutely 
contraindicated during the trea tment phase of the study (that is, at any time after entry 
into the induction period), as is the administration of LIVE oral polio vaccine to 
household contacts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Advisory  
Committee  on Immunization Practices (C DC-ACIP) recommends that subjects should 
not be administered a live virus vaccination for at least 3  months after discontinuing high -
dose corticosteroid therapy (defined as more than 20  mg of pre dnisone per day for more 
 
Abatacept   27 than 2  weeks). In view of the long h alf-life of abatacept, study subjects should not be 
administered a live virus vaccine for a minimum of 3  months following the last dose of 
abatacept.  
5.5 Management of Possible Acute Hypersensitivity 
Reactions to Abatacept  
Hypersensitivity or acute allergic re actions may occur as a result of the protein nature of 
abatacept. In this study, subjects’ vital signs will be monitored before and following 
administration of abatacept. Appropriate emergency equipment and qualified personnel 
must be available where the s ubjects are treated in the event of a serious anaphylactic 
reaction.  
The following information is provided to assist in the recognition of hypersensitivity 
reactions and in the management of those reactions should they occur during or after the 
administrat ion of abatacept. Care should be taken to treat any acute toxicities 
expeditiously, should they occur. The following equipment and supplies should be 
readily available when abatacept is administered: a portable tank or wall source of 
oxygen, endotracheal i ntubation set, oral airway, mask, manual resuscitation bag, 
syringes, injectable epinephrine, injectable antihistamine, and injectable glucocorticoids.  
Signs and management of potential acute hypersensitivity reactions:  
Sign  Management  
Symptomatic 
Hypotension  Discontinue the abatacept infusion. Place the subject in 
the Trendelenburg position and administering IV fluid. 
Administer epinephrine, glucocorticoids, antihistamines, 
and pressor agents as indicated.  
Dyspnea  Discontinue the abatacept infusio n. Observe the subject 
for worsening of the event and for the appearance of 
additional signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis. 
Administer antihistamines, epinephrine, and 
glucocorticoids as indicated.  
Acute Pain in Chest, 
Back or Extremities  These are potentia l signs of anaphylaxis. Follow the 
same treatment regimen as is used to treat dyspnea.  
Chills, Fever, 
Urticaria, or 
Generalized Erythema  These may be signs of an allergic reaction to protein 
products. Treat by administration of acetaminophen and 
antihistamines.  
Because abatacept has immunomodulatory activity, subjects may be at increased risk of 
infectious complications. Significant infectious complications should be treated 
 
Abatacept   28 appropriately. Study medication should be withheld, and restarted only w hen the 
infection is clinically resolved.

Abatacept   30 6.2 Study Materials  
Bristol -Myers Squibb (BMS) will provide abatacept  at no cost for this study.  
6.3 Safety Assessments  
All subjects who receive a dose of abatacept will be evaluated for safety  at every visit . 
Safety outcomes include adverse events, clinically significant changes in vital signs, 
laboratory test abnormalities, and clinical tolerability of the drug. The inves tigator will 
determine the severity of each adverse event as mild, moderate, severe, or very severe. 
Laboratory findings that the investigator feels are clinically relevant should be recorded 
as adverse events. In addition, the investigator will determine the relationship of the 
adverse event to the administration of the study drug. Any occurrence of a SAE from 
time of consent forward, up to and including follow -up visit s will be reported. See 
Section  7.3.1 for the SAE reporting procedures.  
6.3.1  Physical Examina tions  
During the treatment period, the physical examination is to be performed before 
administration of abatacept. While the interim physical examination may not be as 
comprehensive as the complete physical examination, important body systems should be 
included as deemed clinically indicated by the investigator. An interim physical 
examination may note any changes in the subject’s condition since the last assessment 
and does not preclude examination of any of the body systems as clinically indicated.  
6.3.2  Tuberc ulin Skin Testing  
A tuberculin skin test (PPD test: purified protein derivative tuberculosis skin test) should 
be performed and interpreted according to the applicable local Health Authority and/or 
Medical Society guidelines (those that provide recommendat ions for tuberculin skin 
testing for subjects who are to receive biologics, who are immunosuppressed, who have a 
prior history of BCG vaccinations,20,21 or who have a prior positive test). Tuberculin skin 
testing is not contraindicated for persons who have  been vaccinated with BCG.  
QuantiFERON® testing is an acceptable alternative when tuberculin skin testing is not 
appropriate. A tuberculin skin test is not required if one was performed within 6  months 
of screening and documentation of testing is on file. If tuberculin skin testing is 
performed at screening, then the 72 -hour reading must be completed before 
administration of abatacept.  
 
 
Abatacept   31 6.4 Efficacy Assessments  
The efficacy assessments during the treatment phase of the study will be done at the 
intervals specifi ed in the Schedule of Assessments.  The following clinical assessments 
will provide outcome data:  visual acuity, graded assessment of ocular inflammation, 
optical coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiogra phy (FA), and fundus 
photography.  
6.4.1  Visual Acu ity 
Snellen b est corrected visual acuity will be measured at screening/baseline, week 8, 16, 
24, 32, 40 , 52, 76 and 104 .  If the subject cannot read or is unfamiliar with the Roman 
alphabet, then the tumbling E chart will be used.    
6.4.2  Graded Assessment of Oc ular Inflammation  
The grading of ocular inflammation will be performed at screening/baseline, week 8, 16, 
24, 32, 40 , 52, 76 and 104 .  The scales for vitreous haze and anterior chamber cells will 
be based off of the Nussenblatt scoring system and the SUN n omenclature ( Appendices 
A, B).  
6.4.3   Measurement of Macular Thickness Using OCT  
OCT assessments will be used to document changes in macular thickness.   OCT exams 
will be performed at the baseline visit an d weeks 1 2, 24, 52, 76 and 104 .  This assessment 
can be p erformed whenever clinically indicated . 
6.4.4  Fluorescein Angiography  
Fluorescein angiography will be performed at the baseline visit and week s 12, 24,  52, 76 
and 104 .  This assessment can be performed whenever clinically indicated.  Fluorescein 
angiography will  be used to document inflammatory signs by accepted criteria.  
6.4.5  Fundus Photography  
Fundus photography will be performed at the baseline visit and weeks 12, 24,  52, 76 and 
104.  This assessment can be performed whenever clinically indicated.  Fundus  
photography will be used to document chorioretinal infiltrates and/or retinal vasculitis  
 
 
Abatacept   32 6.5 Other Assessments  
6.5.1  Ocular Examinations  
Ocular exams will be performed using slit lamp and dilated fundus exams according to 
the Table . 
6.5.2  Subject and Physician Global Assessments of Disease  
The Subject and Physician Global Assessments of Disease Activity will be performed 
during baseline, week  12, 24, 52, 76 and 104   The assessments will be recorded on the 
subject’s chart as a single vertical mark on a 100 -mm VAS.  The distance from the mark 
to the left -hand boundary of the scale will be recorded on the CRF.  
6.5.3  Visual Analog Scale for Pain  
The VAS for Pain will be completed during baseline, week 12, 24, 52, 76 and 104.   The 
subject will be asked to place a vertical line on a 100 -mm scale on which the left -hand 
boundary represents “no pain,” and the right -hand boundary represents “pain as severe as 
can be imagined.”  The distance from the mark to the left -hand boundary will be recorded 
on the CRF.  
7 ADVERSE EVENT  REPORTING  
7.1 Adve rse Events  
An Adverse Event  (AE)  is defined as any new untoward medical occurrence or 
worsening of a pre -existing medical condition in a patient or clinical investigation subject 
administered an investigational (medicinal) product and that does not necessa rily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and 
unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of investigational product, whet her or not 
considered related to the investigational product.  
7.1.1  Serious Adverse Events  
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose :  
 results in death  
 is life -threatening (defined as an event in which the subject was at r isk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death if it were more severe)  
 
 
Abatacept   33  requires inpatient hospitalization or causes prolongation of existing hospitalization 
(see note below for exceptions)  
 results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
 is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
 is an important medical event, defined as a medical event that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but, based on 
appro priate medical and scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject or may 
require intervention (eg, medical, surgical) to prevent one of the other serious 
outcomes listed above. Examples of such events include but are not limited to 
intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization.  
All pregnancies, regardless of outcome, must be reported to BMS, including 
pregnancies that occur in the female partner of a male study subject. All 
pregnancies must be followed to outcome. See Section  7.6 for instructions on reporting 
pregnancies.  
Although overdose and cancer are not always serious by regulatory definition, these 
events should also be reported to BMS in an ex pedited manner, as described in 
Section  7.2. 
NOTE: The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs in BMS clinical studies:  
 a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department lasting less than 24  hours 
that does not result in admission (unless considered an “important medical event” or a 
life-threatening event)  
 elective surgery planned before signing consent  
 admissions as per protocol for a planned medical/surgical procedure  
 routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/tren ding of health status 
(eg, routine colonoscopy)  
 medical/surgical admission for purpose other than remedying ill health state that was 
planned before study entry. Appropriate documentation is required in these cases.  
 admission encountered for another life c ircumstance that carries no bearing on health 
status and requires no medical/surgical intervention (eg, lack of housing, economic 
inadequacy, caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative).  
7.1.2  Nonserious Adverse Events  
Nonserious adverse events are all adverse events that are not classified as SAEs.  
 
 
Abatacept   34 7.2 Assignment of Adverse Event Intensity and 
Relationship to Abatacept  
All adverse events, including those that are serious, will be graded by the investigator as 
follows:  
 Mild  (Grade 1) : awareness of event but easily tolerated  
 Moderate  (Grade 2) : discomfort enough to cause some interference with usual 
activity  
 Severe  (Grade 3) : inability to carry out usual activity  
 Very  Severe (Grade 4) : debilitating ; significantly incapacitates subject despite 
symptomatic therapy . 
The following categories and definitions of causal relationship to investigational product 
as determined by a physician should be used:  
 Related:  There is a reasonable causal relationship to investigational product 
administration and the adverse event.  
 Not Related:  There is not a reasonable causal relationship to investigational product 
administration and the adverse event.  
The expression “reasonable causal relationship” is meant to convey in general that there 
are facts (eg, evidence such as de -challenge/re -challenge) or other arguments to suggest a 
positive causal relationship.  
7.3 Collection and Reporting  
Adverse events can be spontaneously reported or elicited during open -ended questioning, 
examination, or evaluation of a subject. To prevent reporting bias, subjects should not be 
questioned regarding the specific occurrence of one or more adverse events.  
If known, the diagnosis of the underlying illness or disorder should be recorded, rather 
than its individual symptoms. The following information should be captured for all AEs: 
onset, duration, intensity, seriousness, relationship to investigational product, action 
taken, and treatment required. If treatment for the event was administered, it should be 
recorded in the medical record. The investigator must supply BMS and the IRB/IEC with 
any additional information requested, notably for reported deaths of subjects.  
Completion of supplemental CRFs may be requested for AEs and/or laboratory 
abnorm alities that are reported/identified during the course of the study.  
 
 
Abatacept   35 7.3.1  Serious Adverse Events  
Following the subject’s written consent to participate in the study, all SAEs must be 
collected, including those thought to be associated with protocol -specified pr ocedures. 
Collection of all SAEs must continue for 30  days after the last administration of the 
investigational product. If applicable, SAEs must be collected that relate to any later 
protocol -specified procedure. The investigator should notify BMS of any SAE occurring 
after this time period that is believed to be related to the investigational product or 
protocol -specified procedure.  
All SAEs, whether considered related or unrelated to abatacept, must be reported to BMS 
(by the investigator or designee) wi thin 24  hours of study personnel becoming aware of 
the event. If only limited information is initially available, follow -up reports are required. 
The original SAE form must be kept on file at the study site.  
All SAEs should be faxed or emailed to BMS at:  
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epidemiology  
Bristol -Myers Squibb Company  
Fax Number: 609 -818-3804  
Email: Worldwide.safety@bms.com  
For studies conducted under an Investigator IND , any event that is both serious and 
unexpected must be reported to the Food and Dru g Administration (FDA) as soon as 
possible and no later than 7  days  (for a death or life -threatening event) or 15  days  (for 
all other SAEs) after the investigator’s or institution’s initial receipt of the 
information.  BMS will be provided with a simultaneo us copy of all adverse events filed 
with the FDA. SAEs should be reported on MedWatch  Form  3500A, which can be 
accessed at: http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/.  
MedWatch SAE forms should be sent to the FDA at:  
MEDWATCH  
5600 Fishers Lane  
Rockvil le, MD 20852 -9787  
Fax: 1 -800-FDA -0178 (1 -800-332-0178)  
http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/medwatch/  
 
 
Abatacept   36 All SAEs should simultaneously be faxed or e -mailed to BMS at:  
Global Pharmacovigilance & Epidemiology  
Bristol -Myers Squibb Company  
Fax Number: 609-818-3804  
Email: Worldwide.safety@bms.com  
Serious adverse events, whether related or unrelated to abatacept, must be recorded on 
the SAE page and reported within 24 -hours to BMS (or designee) to comply with 
regulatory requirements. An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt 
exists regarding its status of seriousness.  
All SAEs must be reported within 24 -hours by confirmed facsimile transmission (fax) 
and mailing of the completed SAE page. In some instances where a facsimile machine is 
not available, overnight express mail may be used. If only limited information is initially 
available, follow -up reports are required. (Note: Follow -up SAE reports should include 
the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) In selected circumstances, t he protocol 
may specify conditions that require additional telephone reporting.  
If the investigator believes that an SAE is not related to the investigational product but is 
potentially related to the conditions of the study (such as withdrawal of previous  therapy, 
or a complication of a study procedure), the potential relationship should be specified in 
the narrative section of the SAE report.  
If an ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to the investigational product, a 
follow -up SAE report should be sent within 24  hours to BMS. As follow -up information 
becomes available it should be sent within 24  hours using the same procedure used for 
transmitting the initial SAE report. All SAEs should be followed to resolution or 
stabilization.  
7.3.2  Handling of Expedited Safety Reports  
In accordance with local regulations, BMS will notify investigators of all SAEs that are 
suspected (related to the investigational product) and unexpected (ie, not previously 
described in the Investigator Brochure). In the Europ ean Union, an event meeting these 
criteria is termed a Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR). BMS will 
send investigators an expedited safety report (ESR) to notify them of such an event.  
Other important findings that BMS may report as ESRs  include increased frequency of a 
clinically significant expected SAE, an SAE considered associated with study procedures 
 
 
Abatacept   37 that could modify the conduct of the study, lack of efficacy that poses significant hazard 
to study subjects, clinically significant s afety findings from a nonclinical (eg, animal) 
study, important safety recommendations from a study data monitoring committee, or the 
decision by BMS to end or temporarily halt a clinical study for safety reasons.  
Upon receiving an ESR from BMS, the invest igator must review and retain the ESR with 
the Investigator Brochure. Where required by local regulations or when there is a central 
IRB/IEC for the study, BMS will submit the ESR to the appropriate IRB/IEC. The 
investigator and IRB/IEC will determine if t he informed consent requires revision. The 
investigator should also comply with the IRB/IEC procedures for reporting any other 
safety information.  
In addition, BMS will report suspected serious adverse reactions (whether expected or 
unexpected) to the rele vant health authorities in all concerned countries according to local 
regulations (either as expedited and/or in aggregate reports).  
7.3.3  Nonserious Adverse Events  
The investigator will begin collecting nonserious adverse event (NSAE) information once 
administr ation of the investigational product is initiated until completion of the study.  
All identified NSAEs must be recorded and described in the medical record. If an 
ongoing NSAE worsens in its intensity, or if its relationship to the investigational product 
changes, a new NSAE entry for the event should be completed. NSAEs should be 
followed to resolution or stabilization, or reported as SAEs if they become serious. 
Follow -up is also required for NSAEs that cause interruption or discontinuation of 
investigatio nal product, or those that are present at the end of study participation. 
Subjects with NSAEs at study completion should receive post -treatment follow -up as 
appropriate.  
7.4 Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
All laboratory test results captured as part of the study should be recorded following 
institutional procedures. When reporting a test result that constitutes an adverse event, the 
clinical term should be used; for example, the event should be reported as “anemia” not 
“low hemoglobin.” Test results that con stitute SAEs should be documented and reported 
as such.  
 
 
Abatacept   38 7.5 Pregnancy  
Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during the course 
of the study, in such a manner that the risk of failure is minimized. (See Section  4.2.1 for 
the definit ion of WOCBP.) Before enrolling WOCBP in this study, investigators must 
review the BMS -provided information about study participation for WOCBP, which can 
also be found in the GCP Manual for Investigators. The topics include the following:   
 General Informa tion 
 Informed Consent Form  
 Pregnancy Prevention Information Sheet  
 Drug Interactions with Hormonal Contraceptives  
 Contraceptives in Current Use  
 Guidelines for the Follow -up of a Reported Pregnancy.  
Before study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the impor tance of avoiding 
pregnancy during study participation and of the potential risk factors for an unintentional 
pregnancy. The subject must sign an informed consent form documenting this discussion.  
7.5.1  Requirements for Pregnancy Testing  
All WOCBP MUST have a n egative pregnancy test within 72  hours before receiving 
abatacept.  The minimum sensitivity of the pregnancy test must be 25  IU/L or equivalent 
units of HCG. If the pregnancy test is positive, the subject must not receive abatacept and 
must not continue in the study.  
In addition, all WOCBP must be instructed to contact the investigator and/or other 
study personnel immediately if they suspect they might be pregnant (eg, missed or 
late menstrual period) at any time during study participation.  
7.5.2  Reporting of Preg nancy  
If, following initiation of the investigational product, it is subsequently discovered that a 
study subject is pregnant or may have been pregnant at the time of investigational product 
exposure, including during at least 6  half-lives after administra tion, the investigational 
product will be permanently discontinued in an appropriate manner (eg, dose tapering if 
necessary for subject safety). The investigator must immediately notify BMS of this 
event and record the pregnancy on the Pregnancy Surveillan ce Form (not on an SAE 
form). Initial information on a pregnancy must be reported immediately to BMS, and 
 
 
Abatacept   39 information on the outcome provided once it is available. Completed Pregnancy 
Surveillance Forms must be forwarded to BMS according to SAE reporting p rocedures.  
Note:  Any pregnancy that occurs in a female partner of a male study subject  must be 
reported to BMS using the Pregnancy Surveillance Form.  
Protocol -required procedures for study discontinuation and follow -up must be performed 
for the subject un less contraindicated by pregnancy (eg, x -ray studies). Other appropriate 
pregnancy follow -up procedures should be considered if indicated. Information regarding 
the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal outcome, must be reported 
to BMS on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form. Infants should be followed for a minimum 
of 8 weeks.  
7.6 Other Safety Considerations  
Any significant worsening noted during interim or final physical examinations, 
electrocardiograms, x -rays, and any other potential safety assessments, whether or not 
these procedures are required by the protocol, should also be recorded in the medical 
record.  
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
8.1 Overview  
This is a pilot study.  The primary safety endpoint will be measured by tracking the type, 
frequency, severity, and relationship of adverse events to study treatment.  The secondary 
efficacy  analysis is to test whether at least 50% of patients show clinica l improvement in 
our composite clinical endpoint, comprised of  1) improvement of visual acuity, 2) 
reduction of systemic corticosteroid and other immunosuppressive therapy, 3) improved 
control of inflammation, and/or 4) reduction of cystoid macular edema .  Patients will 
serve as their own controls, and descriptive statistics will be utilized to determine effect 
of treatment within -patients and in the study cohort as a whole.  
8.2 Datasets to be Analyzed  
Visual acuity will be used to determine improvement by 2 or more lines of visual acuity.  
Concomitant medications will be used to monitor systemic corticosteroid and other 
immunosuppressive therapy.  Grading of ocular inflammation using the anterior chamber 
cellular activity and protein flare, vitreous cellular a ctivity and haze as well as the fundus 
photography will be used to analyze improved control of ocular inflammation.  OCT and 
 
 
Abatacept   40 FA will be used to analyze the reduction of cystoid macular edema  and signs of retinal 
inflammation.  Corticosteroid reduction from  baseline will also be ascertained.  
8.3 Endpoint Definitions  
8.3.1  Safety Endpoints  
This will be measured by tracking the  type, frequency, severity, and relationship of 
adverse events to study treatment.  
8.3.2  Efficacy Endpoints  
The composite clinical endpoint for succes s will be comprised of 4 criteria.  The primary 
efficacy endpoint will be at one year.  Treatment will be judged to be successful if there 
is improvement in at least one of these criteria without significant worsening in any of 
them.  These criteria includ e: 
 Improvement by 2 or more lines of best -corrected ETDRS or Snellen visual acuity 
in at least one eye  
 Reduction in dose of systemic corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive therapy  
by at least 50%  
 Control of ocular inflammation, as judged on clinical cri teria, according to 
standard methods  
o Reduction of anterior chamber cellular activity and vitreous haze by at 
least two grades and to a level of trace or less  (SUN)  
o Reduction of chorioretinal infiltrates  or reduction of retinal vasculitis 
(documented by fun dus photography  and fluorescein angiography ) 
 Reduction of cystoid macular edema, as judged clinically and by fluorescein 
angiogram and/or optical coherence tomography.  
 
9 ADMINISTRATIVE SECTI ON 
9.1 Compliance with the Protocol  
The study must be conducted as desc ribed in the final IRB/IEC -approved protocol. 
Documentation of approval, signed by the IRB/IEC chairperson or designee, will be sent 
to the BMS protocol manager.  
All protocol amendments and revisions to the informed consent will be submitted to the 
BMS pro tocol manager and to the IRB/IEC. No protocol amendments will be 
 
 
Abatacept   41 implemented until written approval has been given by the IRB/IEC, except when 
necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. Administrative letters 
should also be sent to the B MS protocol manager and IRB/IEC; however, they do not 
require approval.  
If a protocol amendment mandates a revision to the informed consent, the revised consent 
must be used to obtain consent from subjects currently enrolled in the study if it affects 
them  (eg, if it contains new information regarding safety), and the revised consent must 
be used to obtain consent from new subjects before enrollment.  
9.2 Records Retention  
The investigator will retain, in a confidential manner, all data pertinent to the study for all 
treated subjects as well as those entered as control subjects. The investigator will retain 
source documents and accurate case histories that record all observations and other data 
pertinent to the investigation (eg, the medical record) for the max imum period required 
by applicable regulations and guidelines or following institutional procedures. If the 
investigator withdraws from the study (eg, relocation or retirement), the records will be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee, such as an other investigator or an IRB. 
Written documentation of such transfer will be provided to BMS.  
The investigator will ensure that a current record of disposition of investigational product 
is maintained at each study site where the investigational product is  inventoried and 
disposed. Records or logs must comply with applicable regulations and guidelines and 
should include:  
 amount received and placed in storage area  
 amount currently in storage area  
 label identification number or batch number and use date or ex piry date  
 dates and initials of person responsible for each inventory entry/movement  
 amount dispensed to and returned by each subject, including unique subject 
identifiers  
 amount transferred to another area/site for dispensing or storage  
 non-study disposit ion (eg, lost, wasted, broken), and  
 amount destroyed at study site.  
 
 
Abatacept   42 9.3 Destruction of Investigational Product  
If the investigational product is to be destroyed on site, it is the investigator’s 
responsibility to ensure that arrangements have been made for dis posal, and that 
procedures for proper disposal have been established according to applicable regulations, 
guidelines, and institutional procedures. Appropriate records of the disposal must be 
maintained.

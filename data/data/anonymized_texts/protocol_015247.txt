Title of Study:  
A Dose -escalation Study to Detect Urease -producing Bacteria in Lungs of Healthy Volunteers  and 
Subjects  with Cystic Fibrosis  Using Aerosolized 13C-urea 
Indication :  Use of a 13C-urea breath tes t in the qualitative detection of urease -containing bacteria in the 
respiratory tract and as an aid in  the initial and post -treatment detection  of respiratory tract infections  
Study Design:   This is a single -center, single -administration, dose -escalation study designed to determine 
the safety and dose response of aerosolized 13C-urea 20 mg and 50  mg in detecti ng urease -producing 
bacteria in the lungs of healthy volunteers  (those without and those diagnosed with Helicobacter pylori  
infection ) and in subject s with cystic fibrosis (CF) .  Subjects will be contacted by telephone the next day 
and asked a non -leading question a bout adverse events.  
The dose will not be escalated until at least 24  hours after all subjects in the cohort have been tested at the 
current dose.  If a subject has an adverse event or new symptom that remains unresolved at 48  hours, no 
new subjects will be enrolled until the relationship between the AE and symptom can be evaluated.  If any 
subject experiences an  adverse event considered by the data safety monitor  to be dose limiting, then three 
additional subjects will be enrolled at that current dose.  Dose escalation will stop if more than one 
additional subject experiences dose -limiting toxicity.   
After the safety of the maximum dose  in the cohort of healthy volunteers without H. pylori  infection  has 
been reviewed  by a data safety monitor , healthy volunteers diagnosed with H. pylori  infection and 
subjects with CF will be  enrolled .  Three subjects diagnosed with  H. pylori  infection will be tested at the 
maximum dose to assess potential interference of urease producing bacteria in the stomach ; subjects 
infected with H. pylori  can be enrolled at any time after the safety of the maximum dose in healthy 
volunteers without H. pylori  infection has been evaluated, but they will meet the entrance criteria for 
healthy volunteers without H. pylori  infection . 
Sputum will be collected from each subject with CF before administering study drug in order to i dentify 
bacterial flora using two standard microbiologic methods. The first is a quantitative method in which 
colonies are stained and counted, the second is a colorimetric method in which a sample is plated in a 
medium that changes to a blue color as its pH is increased by the production of ammonia, a by -product of 
the urease -catalyzed degradation of urea.  
Study Duration:   The maximum duration of study participation for each subject  is approximately 9 days:  
up to 7 days between the screening visit and the study visit plus a follow -up visit 24  hours after study 
drug administration.

Study Objectives:   The primary objective is to assess the safety of 13C-urea administered by inhalation.  
The secondary objective is to assess the kinetics of 13C-carbon dioxide production by measuring the 
isotopic ratio of 13C to 12C in exhaled carbon dioxide up to 15 minutes  after administration  and to assess 
potential interference of urease -producing bacteria in the stomach . 
Study Endpoints:   The primary endpoint is the safety of inhaled 13C-urea assessed by adverse events  
including pulmonary findings  and changes from baseline in physical examination findings, pulse 
oximetry r esults, pulmonary function test  result s, and vita l signs.   Secondary endpoints are the isotopic 
ratios of 13C to 12C in exhaled carbon dioxide measured with the POCone detector (Meretek Diagnostics 
Group of Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Rockville, MD) at 5, 10, and 15 minute s after study drug 
administration .

University of New Mexico Confidential  1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1 CYSTIC FIBROSIS  
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disease whi ch affects approximately 30,000  people in the United 
States.  Prior to the development of therapies, most people with CF died in childhood.  New 
advances in therapies  have increased t he average lifespan to about 35  years with respiratory 
failure continuing to be the primary cause of death.  
The CF gene that codes  the CF protein  (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator 
[CFTR ]) was discovered in 1989.  CFTR is a protein that regulates the flows of ions , including 
chloride and bicarbonate , across membranes.  
One consequence of abnormal CFTR is that glandular fluid s thick en, which  leads to obstruction 
of the ducts.  In the pancreas, th is obstruction blocks the release of digestive enzymes into the 
gastrointestinal tract , result ing in poor absorption of nutrients.  Patients with  CF take  
replacement pancreatic enzymes  before every meal to aid digestion and absorption.  
In the lungs of patients with CF, thickened  layers of fluid lining the airways obstruct  the removal 
of bacteria .  Bacteria that are normally present in healthy lungs, and that are normally washed out 
by movement of thin layers of surface  fluid, are not cleared easily from lungs of patients with 
CF.  Urease -producing bacteria Staph ylococcus  aureus  and pseudomonas  are the most prominent 
bacteria found in increased numbers in lungs  of patients with CF .  As bacterial loads increase , 
patient s with CF start to develop mild ly increased symptoms such as cough , but they generally 
do not develop the dramatic signs of lung infection seen in healthy  patient s who have sudden  
increase s in bacteria that develop into  pneumonia.  
Patients with CF are followed in CF centers where the insidious nature of increasing bacterial 
loads is followed  by routine sputum or t hroat cultures at least every three months .  The bacterial 
profile of each patient is known and used to guide aggressive an tibiotic therapy for 
exacerbations .  All bacteria are not cleared  with antibiotic therapy , but it is believed that 
antibiotic therapy decreases bacterial burden.   It is further believed  that patients with CF would 
experience fewer or less severe exacerbati ons if more timely antibiotic therapy was administered  
in advance of exacerbations .  To date, however, the timing of these exacerbations cannot be 
predicted.  
1.2 13C-UREA BREATH TEST  
The 13C-urea breath test is based upon a modification of existing breath testing technology that 
detects and monitors a biomarker associated with peptic ulcers.  The mechanism of action for 
detecting urease -containing bacteria in the lungs is the same as for detecting  another 
urease -containing bacterium, Helicobacte r pylori , in the stomachs of patients with peptic ulcers.  
University of New Mexico  Page 11 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea Breath Test  
University of New Mexico Confidential  For the intended indication, inhaled 13C-urea is catalytically hydrolyzed into 13C-carbon dioxide 
by urease, an enzyme associated with certain bacter ial pathogens common to lung infection s in 
patients who develop CF (I). 
 13CO(NH 2)2 + 3H 2O urease→     13CO 2 + 2NH 4OH (I) 
By measuring the ratio of two stable and naturally occurring isotopes of carbon in exhaled 
carbon dioxide before and after inhalation of 13C-urea, the presence of urease -containing bacteria 
can be confirmed.  In the absence of urease -containing bacteria in the lungs, the isotopic ratio of 
13C to 12C in the baseline and test breath samples will be approximately the same.  If 
urease -containing bacteria are present within the lungs, the concentration of exhaled 13C will be 
increased measurably in the test breath sample relative to baseline.  It is not anticipated that the 
identity or numbers of organisms in the lungs can be deduced from the numer ical δ value 
reported by the breath test, but it is anticipated that the magnitude of the numerical δ value will 
reflect the underlying bacterial load.  It is anticipated that urease -producing bacteria can be 
detected within 15  minutes of initiating the br eath test.  
1.3 UREA  
Urea has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) for oral administration  
(75 mg when  labeled with  13C) in the diagnosis of H. pylori  infection in the stomac h and f or 
intravenous administration  in high doses (500 to 1500  mg/kg/day, up to 120  g/day) as an osmotic 
diuretic to treat patients with cerebral edema and glaucoma .  There is a significant amount of 
safety and toxicology data of urea administration via these routes  (Crews and Davidson 1961 , 
Crews and Davidson 1962 , Gisbert and Pajares 2005 , Pathak et al 2004 , Pathak et al 2010 , 
Soupart and Decaux 1996 ). 
Urea liquefies  viscid mucus when injected into the auditor y canal (Bauer 1970 ) and is capable of 
reducing mucus viscosity and increasing mucus expectoration in lung diseases such a s chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , bronchiectasis, CF, and asthma when administered by 
inhalation . 
No adverse effects on lung function were reported when 2  to 14  g of urea was administered daily 
by inhalation with an intermittent positive -pressure ventilator over “short intervals” for 14  to 
30 days to 32  patients with chronic bronchitis, cystic fibrosi s, asthma, bronchiectasis, and 
emphysema ; and no adverse effects were reported when approximately 7.3  g of urea was 
administered by inhalation over 10  minutes to 6  patients with CF using a DeVilbis nebulizer  
(assuming 6  mL 2M urea/min)  (Waldron -Edward and Skoryna 1966 ). 
The mucolytic properties of urea have not been pursued , however,  because hyper tonic solutions 
were  subsequently shown to be a broncho -constrictor in patients with asthma (Cade and Pain 
1972 , Pain and Denborough 1967 ).  In one such study, mean forced expiratory volume in 
1 second ( FEV 1) decreased 12 % ± 20% in 56  adults who inhaled urea aerosolized using a Wright 
nebuli zer (Cade and Pain 1972 ).  It is estimated that approximately 32  mg of urea was inhaled by 
each patient in this study assuming  typical values of parameters of operation (output, 
University of New Mexico  Page 12 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea Breath Test  
University of New Mexico Confidential  0.13 mL/min; airflow, 9  L/min) and reported experimental detail (urea concentration, 4M; 
inhalation time, 10  min).  
It is now known that inhalation of  osmotic agents such as urea, mannitol, and hypertonic saline 
cause the release of mast cell mediators (histamine and leukotrienes) in patients with asthma, 
resulting in bronchospasm (Anderson 2010 , Brannan et al 2003 , Brannan et al 2009 , Sverrild et  
al 2009 ).  Hypertonic saline has been used as a test for bronchial hyper -responsiveness in 
patients with asthma , and is widely used, n onetheless, with preventive bronchodilator 
administration to treat hyper -responsive patients with CF. 
Overall , evidence points to the safety of inhaled urea.  As with all inhaled  solutions, it is possible 
that it will trigger some cough and bronchospasm ; this does not occur in all subjects , however,  
and when it does occur, it is mild and transient.  Further, pretreatment with a bronchodilator 
(albuterol) has been  shown to prevent the response in most subjects.  When bronchospasm does 
occur, it also can be rapidly reversed with albuterol therapy.  
1.4 RATI ONALE  
It is anticipated that rapid detection and monitoring of lung pathogens will provide an early 
warning signal of the onset of bacterial load and early confirmation of the therapeutic effect of 
the treatment regimen.  In laboratory experiments, urease -producing bacteria were detected 
within approximately 15  to 20  minutes after exposure to urea.  
1.5 BENEFIT -TO-RISK A SSESSMENT  
The safety profile of 13C-urea 20 mg and 50 mg administered by inhalation will be assessed in a 
dose escalation study conducted in two  parts at a single center located at  
University of New Mexico Hospital  
Pediatric/Adult Pulmonary Clinic  
Ambulatory Care Center  
2211 Lomas Blvd NE  
Albuquerque, NM  87106  
This facility has the required equipment/protocol on site to respond to an emergent adverse effect 
of treatment.  Co -investigators Dr. Harkins or Davies will be available on site should an 
emergent adverse event (such as severe bronchospasm or cardiopulmonary arrest) occur during 
study administration.  
This is the first study in humans of this 13C-urea breath test.  In part 1, a  conventional 
dose-escalation study design will assess the safety of inhaled 13C-urea in healthy volunteers.  The 
maximum dose administered will not exceed  50 mg, which approximates the lowest estimated 
dose (32  mg) studied in humans (Cade and Pain 1972 ).  In part 2, the same dose -escal ation study 
design will assess the safety of inhaled 13C-urea in subjects with CF.

University of New Mexico Confidential  Thus, the risk to subjects enrolled in this study is small; there is no direct benefit to subjects who 
enrolled.  The potential benefit of an early warning of accelerated co lonization of bacteria that 
compromises or destroys lung function that may extend or save lives  is significant . 
2. OBJECTIVES  
2.1 PRIMARY OBJECTIVE  
The primary objective is to assess the safety of 13C-urea administered to healthy volunteers and 
subjects with CF by inhalation.  
2.2 SECONDARY OBJECTIVES  
The secondary  objective is t o assess the kinetics of 13C-carbon dioxide production by measuring 
the isotopic ratio of 13C to 12C in exhaled carbon dioxide up to 15 minutes  after administration.  
3. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN  
3.1 OVERA LL DESCRIPTION OF ST UDY DESIGN AND PLAN  
3.1.1 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is the safety of inhaled 13C-urea in healthy volunteers and in subjects with 
CF assessed by adverse events, spirometry test results (FEV 1 and forced vital capacity [FVC]), 
and re spiratory examinations ( respiratory rate, auscultation  [presence of wheezing and crackles ], 
pulse oximetry, and related symptoms, such as cough ). 
3.1.2 Secondary Endpoint  
The s econdary endpoint is the isotopic ratio of 13C to 12C in exhaled carbon dioxide of healthy 
volunteers and in subjects with CF  measured with the POCone detector (Meretek Diagnostics 
Group of Otsuka America Pharmaceutical, Rockville, MD) before study drug administration and 
at 5, 10, and 15  minutes after stud y drug administration . 
3.1.3 Study Design  
This is a single -center, single -administration, dose -escalation study designed to determine the 
safety and dose response of aerosolized 13C-urea 20  mg and 50  mg in detecting urease -producing 
bacteria in the lungs of heal thy volunteers (those without and those diagnosed with H. pylori  
infection)  and in subjects with CF.  Subjects will be contacted by telephone the next day and 
asked a non -leading question about adverse events.  
The dose will not be escalated until at least 24 hours after all subjects in the cohort have been 
tested at the current dose.  If a subject has an adverse event or new symptom that remains 
unresolved at 48  hours, no new subjects will be enrolled until the relationship between the AE 
and symptom can be  evaluated.  If any subject experiences an adverse event considered by the 
data safety monitor to be dose limiting, then three additional subjects will be enrolled at that 
University of New Mexico  Page 14 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea Breath Test  
University of New Mexico Confidential  current dose.  Dose escalation will stop  as described in Table 1 if more than one additional 
subject experiences dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) (Section  3.1.3.1 ).  
After the safety of the maximum dose in the cohort of healthy volunteers without H. pylori  
infection has been reviewed by a data safety monitor, healthy volunteers diagnosed with H. 
pylori  infection and subjects with CF will be enrolled.  T hree subjects diagnosed with H. pylori  
infection will be tested at the maximum dose to assess potential interference of urease producing 
bacteria in the stomach; subjects infected with H. pylori  can be enrolled at any time after the 
safety of the maximum d ose in healthy volunteers without H. pylori  infection has been evaluated, 
but they will meet the entrance criteria for healthy volunteers without H pylori  infection.   
Subjects will be discharged from the study site after 30 minutes  or thereafter when oxyge n 
saturation levels and FEV 1 values return to baseline and coughing symptoms are resolved.  
Supportive treatment for symptom resolution, if needed, will be recorded on the case report form 
(CRF).

DLT  Dose -limiting toxicity.  
 
Sputum will be collected from each subject with CF before administering study drug in order to 
identify bacterial flora using two standard microbiologic methods. The first is a qua ntitative 
method in which colonies are stained and counted, the second is a colorimetric method in which 
a sample is plated in a medium that changes to a blue color as its pH is increased by the 
production of ammonia, a by -product of the urease -catalyzed d egradation of urea.  
The pharmacokinetics of the production of 13C-carbon dioxide will be characterized by 
determining  the isotopic ratio of 13C to 12C in exhaled carbon dioxide of subjects in each part 
before study drug administration and  at 5, 10, and 15 minutes . 
University of New Mexico  Page 15 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea Breath Test  
University of New Mexico Confidential  3.1.3.1  Dose -limiting Toxicity  
The following significant respiratory events will be considered DLTs  (Rosenfeld et al 2011 ): 
• an absolute decrease from baseline FEV 1 of 20% of baseline  or gre ater 
• an absolute decrease from baseline oxygen saturation of at least 10% 
• an increase from baseline  respiratory rate of 10  breaths per minute for more than 
2 minutes during quiet breathing  
• new wheezes or rales on examination . 
In addition to these events that are mandated DLT, the data safety monitor  may determine any 
serious adverse event attributed to study drug to be dose limiting.  
3.1.3.2  Maximum Tolerated Dose  
The maximum tolerated dose is either the dose level administered before enrollment was stopped 
because of DLT or a lower dose if, in the data safety monitor’s  opinion, significant evidence 
exists to reasonably predict an adverse safety profile at that dose  for the study drug.  
3.2 DISCUSSION OF STUDY DESIGN  
Aerosolized urea has bee n studied  in doses ranging from approximately 32  mg (Cade and Pain 
1972 ) to approximately over 7000  mg (Waldron -Edward and Skoryna 1966 ).  The present st udy 
investigates doses up to 50 mg, whic h, based upon laboratory studies  discussed below , is 
anticipated to evidence early indication of changes in the number of urease -containing bacteria in 
the lungs.    
Subjects with CF are selected because th ey have lar ge amounts of urease -producing bacteria in 
their lungs, are not acutely ill, and are familiar with procedures used in this study.  Subjects with 
CF who are known to be colonized with Pseudomonas  will be selected because  pseudomonas  has 
well documented urease activity.  It is likely that subjects with CF  will have additional  lung 
pathogen s that may  also contribute to the signal ; the breath test is intended to be specific for 
urease -producing bacteria .  Pathogens in s putum cultures from subjects with CF will also be 
identified and tested for urease activity.  
Healthy volunteers diagnosed with H. pylori  infection are enrolled to determine whether a 
urease -producing pathogen in the stomach can produce 13C-carbon dioxide in exhaled breath 
within 15  minutes after administering study drug by inhalation.  
The dose -escalation model minimizes subject  risk by incrementally increasing the dose of  study 
drug administered to healthy volunteers , beginning at a dose that approximates  0.1% of one that 
produced no adverse effects  in patients with CF and ending with a dose that approximates the 
minimum amount administered to patients with asthma.  
A maximum dose of 50 mg of 13C-urea was selected because it can be reconstituted to provide an 
isotonic solutio n in a volume that can be inhaled in a sufficiently short time window using a 
standard nebulizer.  The urease reaction is rapid , and the direct delivery of 13C-urea to the lung 
University of New Mexico  Page 16 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea Breath Test  
University of New Mexico Confidential  combined with immediate release of 13C-carbon  dioxide enables the production o f a signal.  
Because a 7 5 mg oral dose of 13C-urea is suffici ent to reliably produce a measurable amount of 
exhaled 13C-carbon dioxide in patients infected with stomach H. pylori , which requires the 
carbon dioxide produced by the catalyzed hydrolysis of urea in the stomach to be absorbed into 
the blood stream and transported to the lung, it is likely that a 50 mg dose administered to the 
lung directly will produce a reliably measu rable signal.  The suitability of a lower  dose, 20 mg 
dose, 13C-urea will also be tested.  
In addition to mandatory rules that stop dose escalation in the event of DLT, dose escalation may 
also be stopped at the discretion of the data safety monitor . 
Albute rol is standard therapy for relief of bronchospasm  (Eng et al 1996 ) and also for the 
prevention of bronchospa sm in diseases such as exercise -induced asthma  (Raissy et al 2008 ).  
Patients with CF are frequently pretreated with albuterol if a therapy may produce  
bronchospasm , e.g., inhalation of 7% saline .  Although nebulized isotonic solutions are not 
expected to produce bronchospasm, subjects with CF will be pretreated with albuterol because of 
the potential of mild bronchospasm induced from irritation of lung pathogens at the  time of study 
drug administration.  
The characterization of the pharmacokinetics of 13C-carbon dioxide will info rm the useful time 
interval during which the isotopic ratio of 13C to 12C can be measured after administration of 
study drug  in patients with lu ng infections  (Otsuka  America Pharmaceutical, Rockville, 
Maryland ).  Multiple breath specimens will be obtained at 15  minute s to estimate intra -patient 
variability.  
3.2.1 Number of Subjects  
Approximately 15  subjects will be enrolled, 9  healthy volunteers and 6  subjects with CF.  Three 
healthy volunteers without H. pylori  infection will each receive a single 20  mg dose and 3  will 
each receive a single 50  mg dose.  After the safety of the 50  mg dose has been  evaluated , 
3 subjects with CF will each receive a single  20 mg dose and 3  subjects with CF will each 
receive a single 50  mg dose .  Three subjects diagnosed with H. pylori  infection will also each 
receive a 50  mg dose to assess potential interference of urease -producing bacteria in the stomach .  
Three additional  subjects will be added to every dose level at which a dose -limiting adverse 
event occurs .  If one subject at each dose level experiences DLT, then a maximum of 30 subjects 
will enroll.  
3.2.2 Duration of Study  
Subjects will participate in the study for approxima tely 9  days, up to 7 days between the 
screening visit and the study visit plus a follow -up visit 24  hours after study drug administration .  
Subjects will receive a single dose of study drug and remain in the clinic for at 30 minutes  for 
evaluation and obse rvation.  Subjects will be discharged from the study site after 30 minutes  or 
thereafter when oxygen saturation levels and FEV 1 values return to baseline and coughing 
symptoms are resolved.  Twenty -four hours after administration of study drug, subjects wi ll be 
contacted by telephone for a safety evaluation by study personnel.   If an adverse event is 
University of New Mexico  Page 17 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea Breath Test  
University of New Mexico Confidential  reported at the telephone contact, the subject will be asked to return to the clinic for an 
evaluation.  
A 24 -hour period will separate dose escalations.  Thus,  the study is anticipated to be completed 
within approximately 4 to 8 weeks after the first subject enrolls.  
3.2.3 Premature Termination of Study  
Dose escalation will be stopped if more than one subject experiences DLT at  any dose level.  The 
data safety monitor  may terminate the study early by stopping enrollment based upon safety 
concerns.

two self -adhesive stickers.  Place one sticker on the collection bag and the other on the CRF 
(Section  7.1.2.1 ). 
11. Administer study drug by inhalation (Section  5.1.3 ).  Record the clock time at the beginning 
and en d of study drug administration.  
12. Measuring time from the end of the inhalation of study drug, collect breath specimens at 
5 ± 1, 10 ± 2, 15 ± 2 minutes (three specimens at this  time point only)  after the inhalation of 
study drug is completed.  Record the clock time of each breath collection on two 
self-adhesive stickers.  Place one sticker on the collection bag and the other on the CRF 
(Section  7.1.2.1 ). 
13. Perform spirometry after collecting the breath specimen at 10 and 30  minutes after the end of 
study drug administration  (Section  7.2.1 ). 
14. Assess adverse events (Section  8). 
6.3 FOLLOW -UP 
Twenty -four hours after administration of study drug, subjects will be contacted by telephone 
and asked a non -leading question to assess adverse events such as “How do you feel after 
participating in the study?”  Additionally, subjects will be asked if they have taken any

Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  medications since receiving study dru g.  All medications taken from the time of study drug 
administration until the follow -up assessment will be recorded on the CRF.   Subjects who have  
adverse events at the follow -up visit will be asked to return to the clinic for evaluation.  
6.4 DISCONTINUATION  
Subjects who discontinue from the study prematurely will receive a follow -up assessment 
(Section  6.3). 
7. STUDY VARIABLES AND METHODS OF ASSESSMEN T 
7.1 EFFICACY V ARIABLE  
7.1.1 Overview of V ariable  
The 13C-urea breath test will be administered to all subjects  after performing baseline spirometry.  
7.1.2 Methods of Assessment  
7.1.2.1  Collection of Breath Specimen  
Samples of exhaled breath will be collected immediately before and at 5 ± 1, 10 ± 2, 15 ± 2 
minutes after the inhala tion of study drug is completed.  Five breath specimens will be obtained 
before the inhalation of study drug; one specimen  will be obtained at each subsequent assessment  
excep t for the 15 -minute assessment at which time th ree exhaled breath specimens will be 
obtained .  Step-wise instructions for performing the breath test are provided in Appendix A. 
1. Record the clock time , intended samp le time (e.g., baseline, 5 -minute) , and subject 
demographic information  on two self -adhesive stickers in the 13C-urea breath test kit.  Place 
one of the stickers on the breath collection bag and the other sticker on the CRF.  
2. Remove the pull -off cap from the mouthpiece of the breath collection bag.  
3. Instruct the subject to breath normally, then take a deep breath and pause momentarily before 
exhaling into the mouthpiece of the bag.  
4. Place the cap on the mouthpiece of the bag until it clicks into place.  
5. Store  the breath specimen at 15 º to 30 º C (59 º to 86 º F) until analyzed . 
7.1.2.2  Analysis of Breath Specimen  
After collection, a ll breath test specimens will be picked up within 24  hours by the central 
laboratory to be analyzed within 7  days of collection.   The isotopi c ratio of 13C to 12C is 
calculated from breath samples collected before and after administration of 13C-urea using a 
POCone® Infrared Spectrophotometer (Otsuka America Pharmace utical, Rockville, Maryland).  
The relative increase in isotopic ratio, δ, is determined automatically by the spectrophotometer 
(I).

where R x is the ratio of the abundance of 13C to 12C in the post -administration sample and R std is 
the corresponding ratio at baseline.  
7.1.3 Microbial Analysis of Sputum  
7.1.3.1  Overview  of Variables  
Sputum specimens will be obtained from subjects with CF after the performance of baseline 
spirometry and before administration of study drug.  Specimens will be obtained using standard 
practices at the study site, and in all cases will be expectorated into a sterile sputum cup, labeled 
with the time of day, date , and unique study identifier for that patient.  
7.1.3.2   Methods of Assessment  
The presence of urease -containing bacteria will be determined locally using  a colorimetric 
method in which a sampl e is plated in a medium that changes to a blue color as its pH is 
increased by the production of ammonia, a by -product of the urease -catalyzed degradation of 
urea (Cox et al 1977 , Damato et al 1982 , Isenberg 2004 ). 
Additionally, bacterial flora in collected sputum will be assessed using standard quantitative 
microbiologic methods employed at the study site in which colony forming units (CFU) are 
identified and counted, and in all cases organisms in numbers greater than 104 and appearing in 
more than one CFU will be identified and counted.  
7.2 SAFETY  VARIABLES  
The safety of 13C-urea will be assessed from a dverse events ( Section  8), spirometry test results  
(FEV 1 and FVC) , and respiratory examinations (respiratory rate, auscultation [presence of 
wheezing and crackles ], pulse oximetr y, and related symptoms, such as cough ). 
7.2.1 Spirometry  
7.2.1.1  Overview of Variables  
Spirometry will be performed at the initial respiratory examination (baseline , Day  1) and  after 
collecting breath specimens at 10  and 30  minutes.   If the last FEV 1 measurement is less than 10% 
of baseline, 4 puffs of albuterol will be administered and spirometry will be repea ted in 15  
minutes.  Patients will be discharged from the clinic when FEV 1 is within 10% of baseline 
measurements and patients are symptom free.  For subjects with CF, spirometry will be 
performed before and 10  minutes after administration of albuterol on Day  1.  
University of New Mexico  Page 27 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  7.2.1.2  Methods of Assessment  
Spirometry will be performed using standard techniques specified by the American Thoracic 
Society and the European Respiratory Society (Miller et al 2005 ). 
7.2.2 Respiratory Examination  
7.2.2.1  Overview of Variables  
Respiratory rate, pulse oximetry data , and related symptoms, such as cough, will be recorded 
before performing each spirometry (at baseline and after collecting the bre ath specimen at  10 and 
30 minutes ).  Auscul tation, noting the presence of wheezing and crackles , will be performed at 
baseline and at any assessment at which FEV 1 decreases at least 20% from baseline.  
7.2.2.2  Methods of Assessment  
Respiratory rate will be determined by counting the number of breaths in one minute.  Arterial 
blood saturation will be determined by oximetry ; the same location will be used for each 
individual subject.   The number of coughs in the 90 -second interval foll owing the end of the 
administration of study drug will be recorded in the CRF (Koskela et al 2005 ).  Wheezing an d 
crackles will be noted when auscultation is performed.  
7.3 PHARMACOKINETICS  
The pharmacokinetics of 13C-carbon dioxide production will be determined  from isotopic ratios 
of 13C to 12C as described in Section  7.1.2.2 . 
7.4 APPROPRIATENESS OF MEASUREMENTS  
Data will be collected using standard methods , widely used and generally regarded as reliable, 
accurate, and relevant.  
8. ADVERSE EVENTS, SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENTS, AND 
SUSPECTED  ADVERSE REACTIONS  
The investigator is responsible for the detection and documentation of events meeting the criteria 
and definition of an adverse event ( AE) or serious adverse event ( SAE ) as provided in this 
protocol.  During the study, when there is a sa fety evaluation, the investigator or site staff will be 
responsible for detecting AEs and SAEs as detailed in this section of the protocol.   All AEs will 
be reviewed by a data safety monitor.  
8.1 DEFINITION OF AN ADV ERSE EVENT  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether  or not considered drug related.  
University of New Mexico  Page 28 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a  study medication, whether or not 
considered causally associated with the use of the study medication.  Any abnormal laboratory 
value deemed clinically significant by the investigator, regardless of causal relationship, must be 
reported as an AE.  
Examples of an AE include the following:  
• significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or indication 
under study  
• exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including either an 
increase in frequency or intensity of the co ndition (e.g., abnormal physical 
examination finding)  
• signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction  
• signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study 
medication or a concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be reported as an 
AE or SAE, unless nonserious or serious sequelae occur)  
The following examples are not considered AEs:  
• medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy), although the 
condition that leads to the procedure is an AE  
• anticipa ted day to day fluctuations of preexisting disease(s) or condition(s) 
(including laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not 
worsen  
• the disease or disorder being studied, or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the d isease or disorder being studied, unless they become more severe or occur with 
a greater frequency than expected for the subject’s condition  
All AEs, whether volunteered, elicited, or noted on physical examination, and regardless of 
causality or seriousnes s, will be assessed and recorded on the CRF beginning after administration 
of study medication through the final follow -up assessment.  SAEs will be assessed and recorded 
after administration of study medication through 30 days after study drug administrat ion 
(Sections  8.2 and 8.4). 
8.2 DEFINITION OF A SUSP ECTED ADVERSE REACTI ON 
A suspected adverse reaction (SAR ) is defined as any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the adverse event was caused by the study drug.  ‘Reasonable 
possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between  the drug and the 
adverse event.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about causality 
than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug.  
University of New Mexico  Page 29 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  8.3 DEFINITION OF A SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENT  OR SUSPECTED 
ADVERSE REACTION  
An SAE  or serious suspected adverse reaction (SSAR)  is defined as any event that meets the 
following criteria:  
• It results in death or is life -threatening (i.e., presents an immediate risk of death from 
the event as it occurred).  (This criterion is not int ended to include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.)  
• It results in persistent or substantial disability or incapacitation.  (This criterion is not 
intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical signific ance, such as 
uncomplicated headache, diarrhea, or sprained ankle.)  
• It results in hospitalization.  
• It results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization.  
• It is a congenital anomaly or birth defect.  
• It requires medical or surgical intervention to prevent any of the above outcomes.  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in determining whether an AE is serious 
when considering important medical events that may not be immediately life -threatening or 
result in death or hospitalization, but  may jeopardize the subject or may require intervention to 
prevent any of the other outcomes listed.  Examples of such medical events that may also be 
considered serious include, but are not limited to, intensive treatment in an emergency room or at 
home f or allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsions that do not result in 
hospitalization.  
Hospitalization for elective treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen from 
baseline does not meet the definition of an SAE.  
Social or convenie nce admission to a hospital or prolongation of a hospitalization for social or 
convenience reasons not associated with the occurrence of an AE does not meet the definition of 
an SAE.  
8.3.1 Serious Adverse Events That Occur Before Administration of Study Medicati on 
Before administration of study medication, only SAEs assessed by the investigator as related to 
study participation (e.g., related to study procedures or a change in existing therapy) will be 
transcribed onto the SAE reporting form and reported to the data safety monitor . 
8.3.2 Serious Adverse Events That Occur After Last Administration of Study Drug  
If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE or death occurring  within 30 days after a subject 
receives the last administration of study medication, the investigato r should report this  to the data 
safety monitor . 
If an investigator becomes aware of an SAE or death occurring more than 30 days after a subject 
receives study medication and the investigator considers the event to be related to the study 
medication, the i nvestigator is obligated to report the SAE to the data safety monitor . 
University of New Mexico  Page 30 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  8.4 RECORDING AND EVALUA TING ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS 
ADVERSE EVENTS  
The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, 
symptoms, or other clinical  information.  In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs or 
symptoms, should be documented as the AE or SAE.  
8.4.1 Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator will assess the  intensity of each AE and SAE re ported during the study .  The 
intensity of eac h AE and SAE recorded on the CRF should be assigned to one of the following 
categories:  
• mild:  an event that is easily tolerated by the subject, causes minimal discomfort, and 
does not interfere with everyday activities  
• moderate:  an event that is sufficie ntly discomforting to interfere with normal 
everyday activities  
• severe:  an event that prevents normal everyday activities  
An AE that is assessed as severe should not be confused with an SAE.  Severity is a term used to 
describe the intensity of a specific  event, and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe.  The 
event itself, however, may be of relatively minor medical significance (such as a severe 
headache).  This is not the same as serious, which is based on the subject’s or event’s outcome or 
on act ion criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a subject’s life or 
functioning (Section  8.2). 
8.4.2 Assessment of Causality  
The investigator is oblig ated to use his or her clinical judgment to assess the relationship 
between the study medication and the occurrence of each AE or SAE.  The investigator will 
assess the relationship to the study medication by using the following criteria:  
• Definitely Related:  An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  The 
AE is most likely explained by study drug.  Dechallenge and rechallenge (if possible) 
are positive.  The AE is consistent with a known response to the study drug.   Another 
etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
• Probably Related:  An AE has a strong temporal relationship to the study drug.  The 
AE is more likely explained by study drug than by another cause.  Dechallenge (if 
performed) is positive.  
• Possibly Related:  An AE  has a reasonable temporal relationship to study drug.  The 
AE could have been due to another equally likely cause.  Dechallenge is positive.  
• Not Related:  The subject did not receive the study drug OR the AE has no temporal 
relationship to study drug OR t he AE has a much more likely alternate etiology OR 
the AE is due to an underlying or concurrent illness or effect of another drug.  
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for the initial SAE report, it is 
important that the investigato r always make an assessment of causality for every event before 
University of New Mexico  Page 31 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  transmitting the SAE reporting form and AE CRF page(s) to the data safety monitor .  The 
causality assessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory reporting 
requirements.  Th e investigator may change his or her opinion of causality in light of follow -up 
information and amend the SAE reporting form and AE CRF page(s) accordingly.  
8.4.3 Assessment of Outcome  
The investigator will assess the outcome of the event by using the following terms:  
• Resolved:  The event resolved or the subject recovered without sequelae.  An event 
(either serious or nonserious) occurred and had an endpoint, and the subject 
experienced no restrictions.  For example, if an AE led to surgery that resulted in a 
postoperative wound infection, the infection would not be considered a sequela . 
• Resolved with sequelae:  The event has at least one secondary outcome that may 
result in permanent disability, functional limitation, or both.  Such sequelae are 
usually limited t o SAEs.  For example, if an AE of stroke resulted  in paralysis, or 
emboli formation after a n AE of  bacterial infection resulted  in a renal inf arct and loss 
of renal function, then paralysis and loss of renal function would be considered 
sequelae.  
• Not resol ved:  At the end of the study, a nonserious event either has not changed in 
intensity or may not have recovered to baseline values.  Examples include headache, 
low-grade fever, or nausea.  
• Unknown: The status of the event is unknown.  
• Death  
8.5 DATA SAFETY MONIT OR 
Clinical data obtained from each subject will be presented daily to the data safety monitor, who 
will adjudicate AEs and determine when dose levels may be increased and when subjects may be 
enrolled into the study.  All the adverse events will be reported to IRB as soon as possible but no 
later than 5 days from the event date or the reported date by the patients or as specified  in 
Section 8.7, whichever is earlier.  
8.6 FOLLOW -UP OF ADVERSE  EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
After the occurrence of an AE or SAE, the investigator is required to follow each subject 
proactively and provide further information on the subject’s condition.  All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit or contact are designated as ongoing and will be reviewed at 
subsequent visits or contacts.  
Nonserious AEs will be followed after the last scheduled study visit, until an appropriate 
resolution can be documented.  
SAEs wi ll be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise 
explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator will ensure that follow -up 
information provided to the data safety monitor  includes results of any a dditional laboratory tests 
University of New Mexico  Page 32 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  or investigations, histopathologic examinations, or consultations with other healthcare 
professionals that serve to clarify the nature of the event, the cause of the event, or both.  
For SAEs only, n ew or updated information will be recorded on the or iginally completed SAE 
reporting form and CRF pages, with all changes signed and dated by the investigator.  The 
updated SAE reporting form and CRF pages should be resubmitted to the data safety monitor  
within the time frames outlined in Section 8.7. 
8.7 PROMPT REPORTING OF SERIOUS ADVERSE EVEN TS TO THE DATA 
SAFETY MONITOR  
Once the investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an SAE, the 
investigator  must notify the data safety monitor  within 24 hours.  
Complete the SAE details reporting form and forward by e -mail to the following contact : 
Mark Schuy ler, MD  
mschulyer@ salud.unm.edu  
In the initial e -mail, the investigator must provide to the data safety monitor  the following CRF 
pages, completed to the greatest extent possible:  
• AE record  
• medical history  
• prior and concomitant medications  
Also, the follow ing documents are to be forwarded:  any laboratory results, diagnostic test 
results, and medical reports relevant to the SAE.  
E-mail transmission is the preferred method to transmit SAE information.  In rare circumstances 
and in the absence of e -mail capacity, notification by fax (505-272-8700 ) or telephone ( 505-272-
4751 ) is acceptable, with a copy of the SAE reporting form and C RF pages sent by overnight 
mail to:

Professor of Medicine  
The University of New Mexico  
Department of Internal Medicine, Pulmonary Division, MSC10 -5590  
1 University of New Mexico  
Albuquerque, NM  87131  
Initial notific ation via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to complete the 
SAE reporting form and CRF pages within the time frames outlined.  
The investigator must not wait to  have all information regarding an SAE before notifying the 
data safety mon itor of the event.  The SAE details reporting form  must be updated when 
University of New Mexico  Page 33 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  additional information is received.  Follow -up information received on all SAEs must be 
forwarded to the data safety mo nitor  using the same procedure and in the same timeframe  as for 
an initial report.  
8.8 REGULATORY REPORTING  REQUIREMENTS  
The investigator must promptly report all SAEs to the data safety monitor  in accordance with the 
procedures detailed in Section  8.7, “Prompt Reporting of Serious Adverse Events to the Data 
safety monitor .”  The data safety monitor  has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both 
the local regulatory authority and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a product under 
clinical investigation.  
Prompt notification of SAEs by the investigator to the appropriate project contact for SAE 
receipt is essential so that SSARs that are either unexpected or observed with increasing 
occurrence, be reported and legal obligations and ethical responsibilities regarding the safety of 
other subjects are met.  
The investigator, or respon sible person according to local requirements, must comply with 
requirements related to the reporting of SAEs to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or 
Independent Ethics Committee  (IEC) . 
8.9 PRECAUTIONS  
Any subject who becomes pregnant during the study must b e discontinued immediately, but 
should be followed through delivery or termination of the pregnancy.  A subject should also 
notify the investigator if she becomes pregnant within 30 days after receiving study medication.  
The data safety monitor  must be no tified of all pregnancies reported to the investigator (see 
Section  8.7 for contact information).  
9. STATISTICS  
9.1 DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE  
The sample size is not based upon inferential analyses, but is deemed appropriate based on 
standard designs of Phase  1 dose -escalation studies in which increasing doses of study drug are 
administered to cohorts of three subjects.   Approximately 15  subjects will be enrolled,  9 healthy 
volunteers and 6  subjects with CF.  Three healthy volunteers without H. pylori  infection will 
each receive a single 20  mg dose and 3  will each receive a single 50  mg dose.  After the safety of 
the 50  mg dose has been  evaluated , 3 subjects with CF will each receive a single 20  mg dose and 
3 subjects with CF will each receive a single 50  mg dose .  Three subjects diagnosed with H. 
pylori  infection will also each receive a 50  mg dose to assess potential interference of 
urease -producing bacteria in t he stomach .  Three additional subjects will be added to every dose 
level at which a dose -limiting adverse event occurs .  If one subject at each dose level experiences 
DLT, then a maximum of 30  subjects will enroll.

13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  9.2 RANDOMIZATION AND BLINDING  
This is an ope n-label study.  Subjects are assigned to treatment based upon the ir sequential order 
of enrollment . 
9.3 ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
Three populations will be analyzed:  
• The intention -to-treat (ITT) population is those subjects who enroll in the study.  
• The safety popul ation is the subset of the ITT population who are exposed to study drug 
and receive at least one safety evaluation.  
• The pharmacodynamics population is the subset of the safety population who contribute 
at least one post -administration evaluable breath spec imen.  
9.4 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  AND METHODS  
This section outlines the nature of and rationale for the statistical methods to be used for the 
analysis of data from the study.  A separate Statistical Analys is Plan  will describe the data 
handling and statistical t echniques in full detail.  
All subject s who meet the inclusion criteria for the study, sign the informed consent form, and 
are enrolled and exposed to the study medication will be accounted for in the analyses.  Subject s 
who are deemed screen failures will not be accounted for in the data presentation of response or 
safety.  
Demographic variables and subject  characteristics will be summarized descriptively by cohort  
and overall.  Demographic variables will include age, weight, height, and race/ethnicity.  
Continuous demographic parameters such as the subject ’s age at the time of enrollment will be 
summarized for the ITT population using descriptive statistics (N, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum value, and 95% two -sided confidence limits).   Categorical 
demographic parameters, such as sex, will be summarized as a proportion of the ITT population .  
Other important subject  characteristics for the ITT population will also be summarized using 
counts and percentages and presented in a listing for mat.  These tabular summaries will be 
prepared by cohort  and overall.  
Heart rate, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and body temperature recorded before  study 
drug administration will be summarized descriptively by cohort  and overall for the ITT 
population.  Spirometry measurements will summarized descriptively by cohort  at each time 
point, including the change from bas eline, for the ITT population.   The number of coughs in the 
90-second interval following the end of the a dministration of study drug will summarized 
descriptively by cohort . 
The incidence of all reported adverse events and treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAE) will 
be tabulated .  A TEAE is defined as an event that first occurs or worsens in intensity after  the 
administration of study drug.  Adverse events will be classified by system organ class and 
University of New Mexico  Page 35 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  For 
incidence reporting, if a subject  reports more than one adverse event that is coded to the same 
system organ class or preferred term, the subject  will be counted only once for that specific 
system organ class or preferred term.  
An overview of adverse events, which includes incidence of TEAEs, treatment -related adverse 
events, adv erse events related to study procedures, SAEs, deaths, and adverse events leading to 
discontinuation, will be presented .  For adverse events presented by severity, the worst severity 
during the study will be presented for each subject .  The subject  inciden ce of TEAEs will be 
summarized by system organ class and preferred term .  The subject  incidence of 
treatment -related adverse events will be summarized by preferred term.  
Missing values will not be substituted using estimated values, but treated as missing in the 
statistical evaluation.  All data from all subject s who receive 13C-urea in the study will be 
included in all listings, plots, summary tables, and statistical analyses.  All analyses will be 
performed using SAS (version  9.2). 
10. STUDY ADMINISTRATION  
10.1 REGULATORY AND ETHICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1.1  Regulatory Authority Approval  
The investigator  will obtain approval to conduct the study from the appropriate regulatory 
agency in accorda nce with any applicable country -specific regulatory requirements before any 
site may initiate the study in that country.  
10.1.2  Ethical Conduct of the Study and Ethics Approval  
This study will be conducted according to GCP; US 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 
50 (Protection of Human Subjects); US 21 CFR Part 56 (IRBs); US 21 CFR Part  54 (Financial 
Disclosure); International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) Guidance for Industry, E6 GCP: 
Consolidated Guidance; the Nuremberg Code; and, where applicable , the principles of the 
Declaration of Helsinki (Recommendations guiding Medical Doct ors in Biomedical Research 
Involving Human Subjects).  
10.1.2.1  Ethics Committees  
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that this protocol, the site’s informed consent form, 
and any other information that will be presented to potential subjects (e.g., adverti sements or 
information that supports or supplements the informed consent form) are reviewed and approved 
by the appropriate IRB or IEC.  The investigator agrees to allow the IRB or IEC direct access to 
all relevant documents.  The IRB or IEC must be consti tuted in accordance with all applicable 
regulatory requirements.  The investigator  will provide relevant documents or data needed for 
IRB or IEC review and approval of the study.  Before investigational products and CRFs can be 
shipped to the site, the investigator  must receive copies of the IRB or IEC approval, the approved 
University of New Mexico  Page 36 
Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  informed consent form, and any other information that the IRB or IEC has approved for 
presentation to potential subjects.  
If the protocol, the informed consent form, or any other inform ation that the IRB or IEC has 
approved for presentation to potential subjects is amended during the study, the investigator is 
responsible for ensuring that the IRB or IEC reviews and approves, where applicable, these 
amended documents.  The investigator m ust follow all applicable regulatory requirements 
pertaining to the use of an amended informed consent form, including obtaining IRB or IEC 
approval of the amended form, before new subjects consent to take part in the study using the 
new version of the for m.  IRB or IEC approval of the consent forms must be obtained in addition 
to the approval given for the clinical study.  Regulatory review and approval may be required in 
some countries before IRB or IEC approval can be sought.  
10.1.2.2  General Considerations  
The e thical standards defined within GCP are intended to ensure the following:  
• Human subjects are provided with an adequate understanding of the possible risks of 
their participation in the study, and they have a free choice to participate or not.  
• The study is conducted with diligence and in conformance with the protocol in such 
a way as to ensure the integrity of the findings.  
• The potential benefits of the research justify the risks.  
This is an investigator -sponsored study.   The investigator  is responsible for all of the following:  
• selecting qualified co-investigators  
• providing co-investigators with the information they need to conduct the 
investigation properly  
• ensuring proper monitoring of the investigation  
• ensuring that appropriate regulatory agencies and all  participating co-investigators 
are properly informed of significant new information regarding AEs or risks 
associated with 13C-urea. 
10.1.3  Informed Consent  
The investigator  will provide a n informed consent form for this study  to suit the needs of the  
institution (although it must reflect the required elements of informed consent specified in 21 
CFR Part 50.25).  The final informed consent form must be approved by the IRB or IEC.  If any 
new information becomes available that might affect subjects’ wil lingness to participate in the 
study, or if any amendments to the protocol require changes to the informed consent form, the  
investigator  will revise the  informed consent form.  The revised informed consent form must be 
approved by the IRB or IEC in advanc e of its use.  
Investigators must provide subjects with all the information necessary to make an informed 
decision about their participation in the study, including the nature and intended purpose of the 
study, possible benefits, and possible risks.

Clinical Study Protocol 12-521 
13C-urea  
University of New Mexico Confidential  All inf ormation in the informed consent form should be provided in a language (whether written 
or spoken) that is as nontechnical as practical and that is understandable to the subjects.  
Before written informed consent is obtained, the subject should be given amp le time and 
opportunity to inquire about the details of the study.  All questions must be answered to t he 
satisfaction of the subject or the subject’s  legally authorized representative . 
Before a subject undergoes procedures specific to the protocol, the informed consent form must 
be signed and dated by the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative  and any 
other signatories as required by the IRB or IEC in accordance with 21 CFR 50.27 (b2).  
After all required signatures have been obtained, a copy of the informed consent form should be 
provided to the subject, and the original must be kept on file at the site and made available for 
review by the IRB or IEC .  Documentation of  the informed consent discussion must be noted in 
the subject’s CRF . 
10.1.4  Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The investigator is responsible for completing and maintaining adequate and accurate CRFs and 
source documentation.  Source documentation constitutes o riginal records (first point of entry, 
either hard copy or electronic), which may include progress notes, medication administration 
records, operation reports, laboratory reports, discharge summaries, and so on.  All CRFs should 
be completed contemporaneou sly in their entirety and stored in a confidential and locked 
location.  
10.2 STUDY MONITORING  
The investigator  is responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the study with regard to 
subject protection, ethics, protocol adherence, site procedures,  and integr ity of the data.  The IRB 
or IEC  will review study progress and CRF completion and address any concerns or questions 
regarding the study conduct.  The IRB or IEC may monitor documentation and procedures 
including, but not limited to,  subjects’ informed con sent documents, subject recruitment 
procedures, subjects’ compliance with the study procedures, source -data verification, drug 
accountability, use of concomitant therapy by subjects, AE and SAE documentation and 
reporting, and quality of data.  
10.3 QUALITY ASSU RANCE  
A regulatory authority  or an IRB representative may visit the study site at any time during the 
study or after completion of the study to perform audits or inspections.  The purpose of a n audit 
or regulatory inspection is to examine systematica lly an d independently all study -related 
activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted according to the 
protocol, GCP, ICH guidelines, and any other applicable regulatory requirements.  Investigators 
should contact the IRB or IEC  immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an 
inspection at their site.

University of New Mexico Confidential  10.4 STUDY AND SITE CLOSU RE 
If the investigator , IRB or IEC,  or officials from regulatory agencies discover conditions arising 
during the study that indicate that the study should  be halted or that the study site should be 
closed, this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between the IRB or IEC  and 
investigator.  Conditions that may warrant termination of the study include, but are not limited 
to, the following:  
• disco very of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects enrolled in 
the study  
• submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to the data 
safety  monitor, IRB or IEC or regulatory agencies  
• failure of the investigator to com ply with GCP (e.g., ICH guidelines, regulatory 
agency guidelines)  
• insufficient adherence to protocol requirements or an unacceptably high rate of 
missing, erroneous, or improperly collected data  
• evidence from the blinded data of sufficient technical proble ms with the study that 
one could believe with a high degree of certainty that subjects are being exposed to 
the investigational drug without a realistic expectation of evaluable data  
• a decision on the part of the data safety monitor  to suspend or discontin ue testing 
evaluation or development of the product  
• failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable rate  
10.5 RECORDS RETENTION

University of New Mexico Confidential  Appendix A 13C-urea  Breath Test Kit Instructions for Use  
Warnings and Precautions:  
1. The use of this kit is restricted by federal law to investigational use only.  The 13C-urea 
breath test should be administered only by trained personnel to patients who have 
enrolled in clinical studies approved by a local institutional review board.  
2. Recon stituted 13C-urea should not be used if the resulting solution is cloudy.  
3. No information is available on the use of 13C-urea in pregnant or nursing women.  
4. The performance characteristics for persons under the age of 18  have not been 
established for this te st. 
5. The specimen integrity of breath samples and reference gases stored in breath bags under 
ambient conditions has not been determined beyond 7  days.  
6. A correlation between the number of organisms in the lungs and the 13C-urea breath test 
result has not be en established.  
Preparation of 13C-urea: 
1. Remove the overseals on the vial of 13C-urea and WFI to expose the septa.  
2. Using the supplied 3  mL syringe, withdraw 3  mL of WFI and inject it into the vial of 
13C-urea. 
3. While the syringe needle remains in the vial o f 13C-urea, gently swirl the 10  mL vial in 
order to ensure complete dissolution of 13C-urea.  Do not use the solution if it is cloudy or 
undissolved material is present.  
4. Draw the reconstituted 13C-urea into the syringe for subsequent charging of the nebuli zer 
cup. 
Preparation of the nebulizer:  
1. Ensure availability of PARI compressor for the nebulizer.  
2. Connect the tubing from the air source to the nebulizer cup.  
3. Express the 13C-urea solution into the nebulizer cup.  
Collection of baseline sample:  
1. Place a self -adhesive bar -code sticker supplied with the kit onto the blue Mylar collection 
bag and the case report form.  
2. On the blue Mylar collection bag, record the subject ID, initials, sex, and age, collection 
date, and clock time at which the baseline sample is be ing taken.  
3. Remove the pull -off cap from the breath collection bag.  
4. Instruct the subject to breath normally, to take a deep breath and pause momentarily, and 
then to exhale into the mouthpiece of the collection bag.

4. Turn on power to the compressor.  
5. Instruct the subject to place the mouthpiece on top of the tongue, closing the lips around 
the mouthpiece.  The subject should take slow,  deep breaths, inhaling and exhaling 
though the mouth.  The valve on the mouthpiece will open during exhalation to allow 
exhaled mist to escape.  
6. The subject should continue to breath through the mouthpiece of the nebulizer cup until 
the study drug is empti ed from the nebulizer cup  or until a slight sputtering sound is 
heard.  
7. Turn power off to the compressor.

Study Design
This will be a single -center, part -randomized, open -label, single -dose, 3 -period crossover study 
to investigate the effect of food and of esomeprazole on the PK of balovaptan in healthy 
volunteers.
Screening will be conducted between Day -28 and Day -2. 
In Period 1, eligible subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU ) on Day -1 (the 
day prior to balovaptan dosing on Day 1) and will remain confined in the CRU until discharge on 
the morning of Day 5.
In Period 2, subjects will be re- admitted to the CRU on Day -1 (the day prior to balovaptan 
dosing on Day 1) and will rem ain confined in the CRU until discharge on the morning of Day 5. 
In Period 3, subjects will return to the CRU for re -admission 5 day s prior to administration of 
balovaptan (Day 9 of Period 2) to begin esomeprazole dosing. Esomeprazole will be dosed for 6 
days: for 4 day s prior to co -administration with balovaptan on Day 1 of Period 3, plus an 
additional dose on Day 2. Subjects will be discharged on Day 5.
In each period, following discharge from the CRU on Day 5, subjects will return to the CRU on 
Day 7 an d Day 9 for further PK sampling.
There will be a washout of at least 12 days and up to 21 days between administration sof 
balovaptan . Thus, re -admission for Period 2 may be between 3 to 12 days after Day 9 of 
Period 1, and readmission for Period 3 will be on Day  9 of Period 2.
Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences (ABC or BAC) on Day 1 of Period 1 , 
with the treatments being as follows:
Treatment A: 20mg balovaptan administered as a single oral dose following consumption 
of high- fat, high -calorie meal 
Treatment B: 20mg balovaptan administered as a single oral dose after a ≥10-hourfast
Treatment C: 40 mg esomeprazole administered once daily for 6 day s and with a single 
dose of balovaptan 20mg 1 hour after the fifthesomeprazole dose in thefasted state
Subjects will return for a follow -up visit on Day 16 ± 2 of Period 3 .

Investigational Medicinal Products
Test Product (Investigational Drug)
Balovaptan 20-mg dispersible tablets (Ro 528 -5119/F 41), administered as a single oral dose 
after a high -fat, high -calorie meal (Treatment A), after a 10 -hour fast (Tre atment B), and after a 
10-hour fast with esomeprazole 40 mg (Treatment C).
Esomeprazole 40 mg capsule administered once daily for 6 days and with a single dose of 
balovaptan 20 mg 1hour after the fifthesomeprazole dose .
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 13Statistical Methods
Primary Analysis
Analysis of variance models will be applied to the logarithmically transformed PK parameters of 
balovaptan AUC 0-inf and C max, to investigate 1) the relative bioavailability of balovaptan 20 -mg
dispersible tablets administered following a high -fat, high -calorie meal vs in the fasted state, and 
2) the relative bioavailability of balovaptan 20 -mgdispersible tablets administered in the fasted 
state either alone or in combination with esomeprazole.
Determination of Sample Size :
Sixteen subjects will be enrolled with the target of at least 12 subjects available for the final PK 
analysis. Considering the observed residual CV% for AUC 0-inf from Study WP40038 of 
approximately 14%, with 12 subjects the 90% CI would be obtained by dividing/multiplying the 
ratio estimate by a factor of 1.11.

Protocol WP41047 v1.0 161. BACKGROUND
1.1 AUTISM SPECTRUM DISO RDER
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorder
characterized by twocore domains: impairments in social interaction and communication
and the presence of repetitive or restricted behaviors, interests, or activities ( American
Psychiatric Association, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 2013 ). 
The Autism and Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network recently reported, based 
on pediatric records, that the estimated prevalence of ASD in the U Sfor the year 2010 
was 14.7 per 1000 ( 1in 68) children aged 8 years ( Autism and Developmental 
Disabilities Monitoring Network Surveillance Year 2010 Principal Investigators, 2014 ). 
Core symptoms of ASD affecting domains of socialization, communication, and repetitive 
behavior are usually observ ed by 3 years of age, although typical language development 
might delay identification of symptoms.
Evidence from both human and animal studies strongly implicates the V1a receptor in 
mediating and modulating key social behaviors that are deficient in ASD. Together with 
the known negative effects of intranasal administration of vasopressin on emotional 
cognition, a V1a receptor antagonist may provide a novel and first approach to treat the 
deficits at the core of these disorders.
Balovaptan (RO5285119) is a potent and selective human V1a receptor antagonist that 
blocks the activation of the V1a G protein -coupled receptor . More detailed information 
regarding ASD and balovaptan are presented in the Investigator ’s Brochure.
1.2 PRECLINICA LBACKGROUND ON BALOVA PTAN
The in vitro metabolism of balovaptan was studied in hepatic preparations from human,

1.2.1 Previous and On going Clinical Studies
The clinical development program of balovaptan started with the entry -into-human Study 
BP25694, which assessed the safety, tolerability, PK, and pharmacodynamics of 
escalating single and multiple doses of balovaptan. Subsequently, the excretion balance, 
PK, and metabolism of balovaptan were investigated in a mass balance study (Study 
BP29279). Four drug -drug interaction studies assessed the interaction of balovapt an as 
a P-gp inhibitor with the P -gp substrate risperidone (Study BP28318), the effect of the 
CYP3A4 inhibitors itraconazole and fluoxetine on the PK of a single dose of balovaptan 
(Study BP28977), and the effect of itraconazole and rifampicin on the PK of multiple 
doses of balovaptan (Studies W P40609 and W P40608, respectively). A study comparing 
the Phase 3tablet formulation with formulations used in Phase 1and 2studies has been 
completed (Study WP40038). A proof -of-mechanism study (Study BP29412) to 
investigate the effect of balovaptan on vasopressin pathway activation in healthy male 
volunteers has also been completed. Additionally, a thorough QT (TQT) study 
(WP40734) and an absolute bioavailability study (W P40607) are clinically complete, with 
reporti ng ongoing at the time of protocol writing.

Protocol WP41047 v1.0 19A Phase 2study investigating the efficacy and safety of balovaptan in male adults with 
ASD (Study BP28420) has been completed. In total 223 patients were enrolled into this 
study at 26 sites in the U S. The patie nts were randomized 2:1 to balovaptan or placebo. 
In total, 192 patients completed 12 weeks of treatment ; of these 192 patients, 25, 69, 
and 30 patients received 1.5mg, 4mg, and 10mg balovaptan, respectively, and 67 
patients received placebo .
Balovaptan is currently being investigated in a Phase 2pediatric study to assess the
efficacy, safety, and PK of balovaptan in adolescents (13 to 17 years of age ) and 
children (5 to 12years of age) with ASD (Study BP30153). Recruitment into this study 
started in November 2016 and wascompleted in September 2019 (339 enrolled) . A 
Phase 3study investigating the efficacy and safety of balovaptan in adults with ASD 
(Study W N39434) is underway. Recruitment into this study started in August 2018 and 
wasongoing at the time of protocol writing .A Phase 1b study investigating the 
pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability in children (2 -4 years of age) with ASD 
(WP40877) is also ongoing.
1.2.1.1 Clinical Pharmacology
Exposure of balovaptan increased in a greater than dose -proporti onal manner following 
single doses of 0.5 to 76 mg, whereas an approximately linear increase in exposure was 
observed after repeated dosing with 12 to 52 mg once daily (qd) for 14 days . Balovaptan 
was rapidly absorbed with a median time to maximum observed plasma concentration 
(Tmax ) between 1 and 4.5 hours after administration of single doses in fasted state and 
between 3 and 4 hours in the fed state following multiple dosing . Steady state was 
achieved after approximately 7 days; the mean apparent eliminat ion half -life after the 
last dose (Day 14) was approximately 46 hours . Food had no relevant effect on the 
overall exposure of balovaptan. The terminal half -livesafter 14 once daily dosing of 
balovaptan 10 mg for balovaptan, , respectively 
In the human mass balance study (Study BP29279), an almost complete absorption of 
the study drug was observed within the first 72 hours follow ing administration.
 
 
Mean cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) -to-plasma concentration ratios of balovaptan  
following 7days of dosing of 10 and 52 mg qd balovaptan were independent of dose .

1.3 STUDY RA TIONA LE A ND BENEFIT -RISK A SSESSMENT
This study willinvestigate the effect of esomeprazole and the effect of food on the PK of 
balovaptan in healthy volunteers. Balovaptan has shown pH dependent solubility ,which 
may affect its absorption at values closer to neutral pH . The 20 mg tablet used in this 
study is the highest possible dose strength of the to -be-marketed formulation .
The study will be performed in healthy subjects who will not receive any health benefit 
from participating in this study . The study is necessary for the further development of
balovaptan and may be of benefit for future patients .

Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 22The balovaptan dose planned forthis study is20 mgwith a single tablet of the highest 
dose strength of the final formulation that may be used in pivotal studies .Plasma 
exposures with a single dose of balovaptan 20 mg are predicted to be approximately 
8-fold below the concentrations observed after the once daily balovaptan doses for 14 
days in Study BP25694 (52 mgqd) and Studies W P40607 and W P40734 (50 mg qd; 
both studies are clinically completed but have not yet reported) . The SAD part in the 
entry -into-human study (BP25694) applied single doses up to 7 6 mg. No safety concern 
for the administration of a single dose of 20 mg have emerged from these trials or from 
any other clinical trial. 
Esomeprazole is an approved medication, and the dose planned for this study ,40mgqd,
is the recommended dose fo rthe trea tment of duodenal and gast ric ulcers . 
Whileplanned study treatments in this study are expected to be well tolerated ,routine
safety monitoring and in- house stays are included in this study during dosing. Subjects 
will be asked to report any events of feeling “not well” to study staff immediately.

3. STUDY DESIGN
3.1 DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY
This will be a single -center, part -randomized, open- label, single -dose , 3-period 
crossover study to investigate the effect of food and of esomeprazole on the PK of 
balovaptan in healthy volunteers.
Screening will be conducted between Day -28 and Day -2. 
In Period 1, eli gible subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) on 
Day -1 (the day prior to balovaptan dosing on Day 1 ) and will remain confined in the 
CRU until discharge on the morning of Day 5. 
In Period 2, subjects will be re -admitted to the CRU on Day -1 (the day prior to 
balovaptan dosing on Day 1 ) and will remain confined in the CRU until discharge on the 
morning of Day 5.
In Period 3 , subjects will return to the CRU for re-admission 5 days prior to 
administration of balovaptan (Day 9 of Period 2)to begin esomeprazole dosing . 
Esomeprazole will be dosed for 6 days :for 4 days prior to co -administration with 
balovaptan on Day 1 of Period 3, plus an additional dose on Day 2. Subjects will be 
discharged on Day 5.
In each period, following discharge from the CRU on Day 5, subjects will return to the 
CRU on Day 7 and Day 9 for further PK sampling.
There will be a washout of at least 12 days and up to 21 days between administration s
of balovaptan. Thus, re-admission for Period 2 may be between 3 to 12 days after Day 9 
of Period 1, and re- admission for Period 3 will be on Day 9 of Period 2 .
Balovaptan —F.Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd

3.3 RATIONA LE FOR STUDY DESIGN
Thisstudy is designed to evaluate the effect of food and modification of gastric pH by 
esomeprazole on the PK of balovaptan, with the highest dose strength of the final 
formulation of balovaptan that may be used in pivotal studies .The PK parameters of 
balovaptan administered fasted with or without administration of esomeprazole, a gastric 
pH modifier ,or balovaptan administere d following a high -fat, high -calorie meal, will be 
compared. A crossover design was chosen to allow for within -subject assessments, 
minimizing the impact of variability across subjects on the planned analyses. An open -
label study was considered appropriate because of the objective nature of the PK 
measures.
3.3.1 Rationale for Balova ptan and Esom eprazole Dose 
3.3.1.1 Balovaptan
A dose of 20mg balovaptan is the highest daily dose that is currently foreseen to be 
used in further clinical development .
Based on previous clinical experience ,single dose sof balovaptan 20mg are expected 
to be well tolerated . The effect of food on the plasma exposure of balovaptan has 
previously been shown to be small ,within particular ,a reduction in C max;esomeprazole 
is expected to have either no effect on or to reduce the exposure of balova ptan.
3.3.1.2 Esomeprazole
The study will examine the effect of esomeprazole 40mgon the PK of a single dose of 
20mg balovaptan. Esomeprazole is an approved medication ,and the dose planned for 
this study ,40mgqd,is approved for the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers and 
has an acceptable safety profile. During repeated once- daily dosing with an 
enteric- coated granule capsule omeprazole formulation, inhibition of acid secretion 
increases initially, and stabilizes within about 4 days ( Olbe, 1989 ). The mean percentage 
of time with intragastric pH > 4 increases significantly after 5 days of dosing compared to 
after a single dose with esomeprazole 40 mg (Röhss, 2002 ). Intragastric pH rises to 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 26above 4 about 1 hour to 2 hours after the morning of Day 5 ( Lind, 2000). In the current 
study, esomeprazole 40 mg will be dosed for 4consecutive days prior to 
coadministration with a single dose of balovaptan on the fifthday of esomeprazole 
dosing (Day 1), followe d by a further single dose of esomeprazole on Day 2 , to ensure 
that during any recirculation of balovaptan in the first 48 hours after administration ,
inhibition of acid production is maintained .
3.3.2 Rationale for Study Population
Healthy male or female volunt eers aged 18 to 6 5years inclusive have been chosen as 
the study population due to the low risk of this study . Moreover, use of healthy subjects, 
as opposed to patients, will allow a clearer interpretation of the study results, as there 
will be no confounding factors that result from changes in disease state and/or 
concomitant medication use.
4. MATERI ALS AND METHOD S
4.1 SUBJECTS
The target population will be healthy male or female volunteers aged 18 to 65 years ,
inclusive . An attempt will be made to have 50% male and 50% female participants, and

4.5.1 Informed Consent F orms and Screening Log
Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before 
performing any study -related procedures (including screening evaluations) . Informed 
Consent Forms for enrolled subjects and for subjects who are not subs equently enrolled 
will be maintained at the study site.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that subjects meet 
all eligibility criteria before enrollment . The Investigator or designee will maintain a 
screening log to record details of all subjects screened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.
4.5.2 Medical History , Baseline Conditions, Concomitant Medication,
and Demographic Data
Medical history, including clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history 
(including prior cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive status, smoking 
history, and use of alcohol and drugs of abuse, will be recorded at baseline . In addition, 
all medications ( e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-counter drugs, vaccines, herbal or 
homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the subject within 4weeks prior 
to initiation of study treatment will be recorded.
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity.
4.5.3 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination will be performed at screening and at the follow -up visit
(Appendix 1 ). The examination should include an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat ;and the cardiovascular, dermatologic , musc uloskeletal, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, and 
genitourinary (at the Investigator discretion) systems . Any clinically 
significant abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical 
History and Baseline Conditions eCRF . Changes from baseline abnormalities should be 
recorded in subject notes . New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be 
recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form.
4.5.4 Vital Signs
Oral body temperature, pulse rate, blood pressure , and respiratory rate will be measured 
at the time points described in Appendix 1.Blood pressure and pulse rate 
measurements will be performed after the subject has rested in a supine position for at 
least 5 minutes.
4.5.4.1 Orthostatic Challenge Test ing
Orthostatic challenge testing will be performed at Screening. 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 36During a 15 -minute period during which subjects will remain in a supine position, blood 
pressure according to the Riva -Rocci method and pulse rate will be measured after 10 
and 15 minutes. If the second blood pressure measurement deviates from the previous 
measurement by more than 5 mmHg, another 5 -minute extension period will be added, 
and blood pressure and pulse rate will be obtained after 20 minutes in the supine 
position.
The subject wi ll then be asked to erect rapidly into a standing position, and blood 
pressure and pulse rate will be assessed again after 3 minutes of standing.
Standing blood pressure and pulse rates will be compared against the latest blood 
pressure and pulse rate valu es obtained in the supine position. Orthostatic hypotension 
is defined as a decrease in systolic blood pressure by at least 20 mmHg and/or a 
decrease in diastolic blood pressure by at least 10 mmHg.
Such changes used to define orthostatic hypotension or pr e-syncopal/ syncopal events 
during standing will result in exclusion.
4.5.5 Clinical Laboratory Samples
For sampling and sample processing procedures, storage conditions, and shipment 
instructions, see the Laboratory Manual.
Biological samples will be destroyed when the final Clinical Study Report has been 
issued, except where specified otherwise.
When a subject withdraws from the study, samples collected prior to the date of 
withdrawal may still be analyzed, unless the subject specifically requests that the 
samp les be destroyed, or local laws require destruction of the samples . However, if 
samples have been tested prior to withdrawal, results from those tests will remain as 
part of the overall research data.
Data arising from sample analysis will be subject to th e confidentiality standards 
described in Section 8.4.
Laboratory samples will be collected at the time points indicated in Appendix 1. 
Additional blood or urine sam ples may be taken at the discretion of the Investigator or 
designee if the results of any test fall soutside the reference ranges, or clinical symptoms 
necessitate additional testing to monitor subject safety . Subjects must fast for at least 8 
hours prior to laboratory safety assessments (except for urine assessments) .
Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to the study site’s local laboratory 
for analysis:
Hematology: leucocytes, erythrocytes, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, MCH, 
MCV, W BC and differential count , including absolute counts and percentages
[neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, monocytes, lymphocytes] 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 37Urinalysis: A midstream, clean -catch urine specimen will be collected for dipstick 
analysis of pH, glucose, leucocytes, nitr ites, protein , and blood. Microscopy to be 
performed if abnormalities are observed and deemed necessary by the Investigator, 
in particular when blood or protein is positive or strong positive. If there is an 
explanation for the positive dipstick result, it should be recorded, and there is no 
need to perform laboratory for microscopy and culture
Coagulation: prothrombin time ( international normalized ratio ) and activated 
thromboplastin time 
Blood chemistry panel: sodium, potassium, glucose (fasting), creatinine, albumin, 
total and conjugated bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alkaline aminotransferase 
(ALT), aspartate aminotransferase ( AST), gamma -glutamyl -transferase, creatine 
phosphokinase (CPK), lactate dehydrogenase , total choleste rol and, triglycerides

benzodiazepines cannabinoids, cocaine, cotinine, opiates, methamphetamines, and 
methadone )and alcohol will be measured in urine at Screening and day of 
admission for each treatment period. Further testing may be performed throughout 
the study to confirm compliance, at the discretion of the Investigator.
Viral serology: HIV-1 and -2 antibodies, hepatitis Bcore antibody (anti-HBc) , 
hepatitis C virus antibody at screening; hepatitis B surface antigen and hepatitis B 
viral DNA will be assessed at screening if anti-HBc is positive
Pregnancy test: beta -human chorionic gonadotropin (serum pregnancy test) will be 
performed at screening and day of admission of each treatment period and at 
follow -up forall female subjects .
Follicle -stimulating hormone: at screening for postmenopausal women to confirm 
menopause
4.5.6 Pharmacokinetic Samples

the Pharmacokinetic and Clinical Genotyping Sample Manual.
4.5.7 Genotyping Samples
A mandatory whole blood sample will be taken for DNA extraction from every subject 
during the study on Day -1 of Treatment Period 1 . The DNA may be used to determine 
whether genes relating to drug -metabolizing enzymes and/or drug transporter enzymes 
affect the PKand/or the safety profile of balovaptan . Genotyping samples will be sent to 
the Sponsor or a designee for analysis . This specimen will be destroyed no later than 2 
years after the final Clinical Study Report has been issued.
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 38The Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by coding each subject enrolled in the 
study through assignment of a unique subject identification number. This number is used 
to code the samples. Subject names are not included in samples that are sent for 
analysis. 
4.5.8 Electrocardiograms
Safety 12-lead ECG assessments will be performed in this study at the timepoint s 
indicated in Appendix 1 .Safety 12-lead ECGs will be performed in triplicate at Screening 
and Day -1; single ECGs will be performed at all other time points . These ECG 
recordings will only be used to assess /define a safety baseline and determine the 
immediate safety of each subject during each treatment period. Safety ECG recordings 
may be obtained at unscheduled timepoints as required by the Investigator ,or designee ,
to ensure the safety of study subjects . For safety monitoring purposes, the Investigator ,
or designee ,must review, sign, and date all ECG tracings.
4.5.9 Drug and Metabolite Concentration Measurements
For each treatment period plasma samples will be collected ,as described in Appendix 1 ,
to determine concentrations of balovaptan and its metabolites M2 (as appropriate )and 
M3 utilizing a specific and validated liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) method. In Period 3,plasma samples to determine concentrations of 
esomeprazole will be collected, and concentrations will be determined using a separate 
specific and validated LC -MS/MS method.
Timing of Study  Assessments
If performed at the same timepoint, assessments shou ld be prioritized as follows, while 
ensuring PK blood sampling is conducted at the scheduled time , when possible : 
12-lead ECGs
Vital signs measurements
PK blood sampling
Laboratory tests
For PK assessments, the following windows arerecommended : -30minutes for predose 
time points; ± 5 min utes for time points within the first 36 hours post dose; ±10 minutes 
for the next time points up to 96 hours post dose; and ±12 hours forDay 7 and Day 9

Balovaptan is not approved in any country and clinical development is ongoing . The 
safety plan for subjects in this study is based on clinical experience with balovaptan in 
completed and ongoing studies . Please refer to the balovaptan ( RO5285119) IBfor a 
complete summary of the safety information available for the balovaptan .
 
 
 

Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 42 
5.2 SAFETY PA RAMETERS AND DEFINITIONS
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording AEs, including SAEs and 
AEs of special interest (AESI) , performing protocol -specified safety laboratory 
assessments, measuring protocol -specified vital signs, and conducting other protocol -
specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety evaluation of the stu dy.The 
schedule for conducting these activities is provided in Appendix 1 .
Certain types of events require immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4.
5.2.1 Adverse Events
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) , an AEis any untoward 
medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical 
product, regardless of causal attribution. An AEcan therefore be any of the following:
Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or n ot considered related to the medicinal product
Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition )(Section 5.3.5.8).
Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at 
baseline
Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other clinical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms o r leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant 
treatment or discontinuation from study drug
Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g., screening invas ive 
procedures such as biopsies)
5.2.2 Serious A dverse Events (Immediately  Reportable to the 
Sponsor)
AnSAE is any AEthat meets any of the following criteria:
Is fatal (i.e., the AEactually causes or leads to death)
Is life threatening (i.e., the AE, in the view of the Investigator or designee , places the 
subject at immediate risk of death)
oThis does not include any AEthat,had it occurred in a more severe form 
or was allowed to continue ,might have caused death.
Requires or prolongs subject hospita lization (Section 5.3.5.9 )

5.3 METHODS A ND TIMING F OR CA PTURING A ND ASSESSING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS
The Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs are recorded on the Adverse 
Event eCRF and source form and reported to the Sponsor in accordance with 
instructions provided in this Section and in Sections 5.4-5.6.
For each AErecorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form, the Investi gator or 
designee will make an assessment of seriousness (see Section 5.2.2 ), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ). 
5.3.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period
All AEs, whether reported by the subject or noted by study personnel, will be recorded in 
the subject ’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form .
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug ,only SAEs
caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., discontinuation of medications) should 
be reported (see Section 5.4.2 for instructions for reporting SAEs).
After initiation of study drug, all AEs will be reported until up to 14 days after the final
dose of study drug.
Instructions for reporting AEs that occur after the AEreporting period are provided in 
Section 5.6.
5.3.2 Eliciting A dverse Ev ent Information
A consistent methodology of non directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting AE
information. Examples of non- directive questions include the following:
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit? "
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here? "
5.3.3 Assessment of Severity  of A dverse Events
Table 3provides guidance for assessing AE severity.

Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 45Table 3Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale
Severity Description
Mild Discomfort noticed, but no disruption of normal daily activity
Moderate Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal daily activity
Severe Incapacitating with inability to work or to perform normal daily activity
Note : Regardless of severity, some events may  also meet seriousness criteria. Refer 
to definition of a nSAE (see Section 5.2.2 ).
5.3.4 Assessment of Causality  of Adverse Events
Investigator or designee s should use their knowledge of the subject , the circumstances 
surrounding the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to 
determine whether an AEis considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes"
or "no"accordingly . The following guidance should be taken into consideration (see also 
Table 4 )
Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug
Course of the event, with special consideration of the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug ( asapplicable)
Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments
Known association of the event with the disease under study
Presence of risk factors in the subject or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event
Presence of non treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event
Table 4Causal A ttribution Guidance
Is the AEsuspected to be caused by the study drug on the basis of facts, evidence, 
science -based rationales, and clinical judgment?
YES There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AEand 
administration of the study drug, and the AEcannot be readily explained by the 
subject 'sclinical state, intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the AE
follows a kno wn pattern of response to the study drug; and/or the AEabates or resolves 
upon discontinuation of the study drug or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears 
upon re -challenge.
NO An AEwill be considered related, unless it fulfills the criteria specified below . 
Evidence exists that the AEhas an etiology other than the study drug (e.g., preexisting 
medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); 
and/or the AEhas no plausible temporal relationship to administr ation of the study drug 
(e.g., cancer diagnosed 2 days after first dose of study drug).
For subjects receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy .
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 465.3.5 Procedures for Recording A dverse Events
Investigator or designee s should use correct medical terminology/concepts when 
recording AEs on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form . Avoid colloquialisms and 
abbreviations.
Only one AEterm should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF and 
source form .
5.3.5.1 Diagnosis versus Signs and Sy mptoms
A diagnosis (if known) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form
rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis 
rather than jaundice, asterixi s, and elevated transaminases) . However, if a constellation 
of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or 
syndrome at the time of reporting, each individual event should be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and source form. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all 
previously reported AEs based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced 
by one AEreport based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to 
the starting date of the fi rst symptom of the eventual diagnosis.
5.3.5.2 Adverse Events That A reSecondary  to Other Events
In general, AEs that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or clinical 
sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of sever e or 
serious secondary events . A medically significant secondary AEthat is separated in time 
from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent event on the Adverse 
Event eCRF and source form . For example:
If vomiting results in mild dehydrati on with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, 
only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.
If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.
If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF.
If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all 3events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.
If neutropenia is accompanied by a ninfection, both events should be reported 
separatel y on the eCRF.
All AEs should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form if it 
is unclear as to whether the events are associated.
5.3.5.3 Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events
A persistent AEis one that extends continuously, without resolution, between subject
evaluation timepoints . Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event 
eCRF and source form . The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 47recorded at the time the event is first reported . If a persistent AEbecomes more severe, 
the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and 
source form . If the event becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning that the event became serious; 
see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions) . The Adverse Event eCRF and source form
should be updated by changing the event from "nonserious " to "serious," providing the 
date that the event became serious, and completing all data fields related to SAEs.
A recurrent AEis one that resolves between subject evaluation timepoints and 
subsequently recurs . Each recurrence of an AEshould be recorded as a separate event 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form .
5.3.5.4 Abnormal Laboratory Values
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an AE. A laboratory test result must be 
reported as an AEif it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by clinical symptoms
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium suppl ementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the Investigator or designee ’s judgment 
It is the Investigator or designee’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings . Medical 
and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an AE.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 ULN associated with chole stasis ), only the 
diagnosis (i.e., chole stasis ) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and source 
form.
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form , 
along with a descriptor indicating whether the test result is above or below the normal 
range (e.g., "elevated potassium, "as opposed to "abnormal potassium "). If the 
laboratory abnormality can be characterized by a precise clinical term per standard 
definitions, the clinical term should be recorded as the AE. For example, an elevated
serum potassium level of 7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia. "
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form (see 
Section 5.3.5.3 for details on recording persistent AEs).
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 485.3.5.5 Abnormal Vital Sign Values
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an AE. A vital sign result must be reported 
as an AEif it meets any of the following criteria:
Is accompanied by clinical symptoms
Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)
Results in a medical intervent ion or a change in concomitant therapy
Is clinically significant in the Investigator or designee ’s judgment 
It is the Investigator or designee’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings . Medical 
and scientific judgment should be exercised in deci ding whether an isolated vital sign 
abnormality should be classified as an AE.
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e., hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF and source form .
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form (see 
Section 5.3.5.3 for details on recording persistent AEs).
5.3.5.6 Abnormal Liver Function Tests
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST ( 3ULN) in combination with either an elevated 
total bilirubin ( 2ULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or other 
causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as 
defined by Hy's Law ). Therefore, Investigator or designees must report as an AEthe 
occurrence of either of the following:
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with total bilirubin 
2ULN
Treatment -emergent ALT or AST 3ULN in combination with clinical jaundice
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form (see 
Section 5.3.5.1 ) and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learning of the event), either as a SAE or an AESI (see Section 5.4.2).
5.3.5.7 Deaths
All deaths that occur during the protocol -specified AEreporting period (see 
Section 5.3.1 ), regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and source form and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see 
Section 5.4.2 ).
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event . The event or condition 
that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 49concept on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form . Generally, only one such eve nt 
should be reported . If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the 
time of reporting, "unexplained death "should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF 
and source form . If the cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy ), 
"unexplained death "should be replaced by the established cause of death . The term 
"sudden death" should not be used unless combined with the presumed cause of death 
(e.g., "sudden cardiac death").
Deaths that occur after the AEreporting period should be reported as described in 
Section 5.6.
5.3.5.8 Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study . 
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an AEonly if the frequency, 
severity, or character of the condition worsens during the study . When recording such 
events on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form , it is i mportant to convey the 
concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors 
(e.g., "more frequent headaches ").
5.3.5.9 Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization
Any AEthat results in hospitalization (i.e., inpatient admission to a hospital) or prolonged 
hospitalization should be documented and reported as a nSAE (per the definition of SAE
in Section 5.2.2 ), except as out lined below.
An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances should not be 
reported as an AEor a SAE:
Hospitalization for respite care
Planned hospitalization required by the protocol
Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following criteria 
are met:
oThe hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled 
during the study when elective surgery became necessary because of the 
expected normal progression of the disease
oThe subject has not experienced an AE
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 50An event that leads to hospitalization under the following circumstances is not 
considered to be a SAE, but should be reported as an AEinstead:
Hospitalization that was necessary because of subject requirement for outpatient 
care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours
5.4 IMMEDIA TE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGA TOR TO SPON SOR
Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate 
measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial . The Investigator or designee
must report such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should 
reporting take place more than 24 hours after the Investigator or designee learns of the 
event . The following is a list of events that the Investigat or or designee must report to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours after learning of the event, regardless of relationship to study 
drug:
SAEs (defined in Section 5.2.2 ; see Section 5.4.2 for details on reporting 
requirements )
 see Section 5.4.2 for 
details on reporting requirements)
Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for details on reporting requirements )
For SAEs and AESIs , the Investigator or designee must report new significant follow -up 
to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
information) . New significant information includes the following:
New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis
Significant new diagnostic test results
Change in causality based on new information
Change in the event’s outcome, i ncluding recovery
Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event

pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the mother during or after the 
pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should be reported on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and source form . In addition , the Investigator or designee will 
submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated information on the 
course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available . 
5.4.3.2 Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Subjects
Male subjects will be ins tructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately 
inform the Investigator or designee if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or 
within 90 days after the finaldose of study drug . A paper Clinical Trial Pregnancy 
Reporting Form should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by 
faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address
provided to investigators . Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the 
course and outcome of any pregnancy in the partner of a male subject exposed to study 
drug. When permitted by the site, the pregnant partner would need to sign an 
Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to allow for 
follow -up on her pregnancy . Ifthe authorization has been signed, the Investigator or 
designee should submit a Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form when updated
information on the course and outcome of the pregnancy becomes available . An 
Investigator or designee who is contacted by the male subject or his pregnant partner 
may provide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the 
fetus, to support an informed decision in cooperation with the treating physician and/or 
obstetrician.
5.4.3.3 Abortions
Aspontaneous abortion should be classified as a nSAE (asthe Sponsor considers 
abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and source 
form, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after 
learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). 
If a therapeutic or elective abortion was performed because of an underlying maternal or 
embryofetal toxicity, the toxicity should be classified as a nSAE, recorded on the 
Adverse Event eC RF, and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 
hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). A therapeutic or elective abortion 
performed for reasons other than an underlying maternal or embryofetal toxicity is not 
considered an AE.
All abortions should be reported as pregnancy outcomes on the paper Clinical Trial 
Pregnancy Reporting Form.
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 535.4.3.4 Congenital A nomalies /Birth Defec ts
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject exposed to study 
drug orthefemale partner of a male subject exposed to study drug should be classified 
as anSAE, recorded on the Adverse Event form, and reported to the Sponsor 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ).
5.4.4 Reporting Requirements for Cases of Accidental Overdose or 
Medication Error 
Accidental overdose and medication error (hereafter collectively referred to as "special 
situations"), are defined as follows:
Accidental overdose: accidental administration of a drug in a quantity that is higher 
than the assigned dose
Medication error : accidental deviation in the administration of a drug 
In some cases, a medication error may be intercepted prior to administration of 
the drug.
Special situations are not in themselves adverse events but may result in adverse 
events . Each AEassociated with a special situation should be recorded separately on 
the Adverse Event eCRF . If the associated AEfulfills seriousness criteria, the event 
should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., nomore than 24 hours after 
learning of the event; see Section 5.4.2 ). For balovaptan, adverse events associated 
with special situations should be recorded as described below for each situation:
Accidental over dose: Enter the AEterm. Check the "Accidental overdose" and 
"Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose : Enter the AEterm. Check the 
"Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose : Enter the AEterm. Check the 
"Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
In addition, all special situations associated with balovaptan, regardless of whether they 
result in an AE, should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF as described below:
Accidental ove rdose : Enter the drug name and "accidental overdose" as the event 
term. Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes.
Medication error that does not qualify as an overdose : Enter the name of the drug 
administered and a description of the er ror (e.g., wrong dose administered, wrong 
dosing schedule, incorrect route of administration, wrong drug, expired drug 
administered) as the event term . Check the "Medication error" box.
Medication error that qualifies as an overdose : Enter the drug name an d "accidental 
overdose" as the event term . Check the "Accidental overdose" and "Medication 
error" boxes . Enter a description of the error in the additional case details.
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 54Intercepted medication error : Enter the drug name and "intercepted medication 
error" a s the event term . Check the "Medication error" box . Enter a description of the 
error in the additional case details.
As an example, an accidental overdose that resulted in a headache would require 2
entries on the Adverse Event eCRF, one entry to report t he accidental overdose and one 
entry to report the headache . The "Accidental overdose" and "Medication error" boxes 
would need to be checked for both entries.
5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF SUBJECTS AFTER A DVERSE EVENTS
5.5.1 Investigator Follow -Up
TheInvestigator or designee should follow each AEuntil the event has resolved to baseline 
grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the Investigator or designee , the subject
is lost to follow -up, or the subject withdraws consent . Every effort should be made to follow 
all SAEs considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures until a final 
outcome can be reported.
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented 
on the Adverse Event eCRF and source form and in the subject ’s medical record to 
facilitate source data verification.
All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.
5.5.2 Sponsor Follow -Up
For SAEs , and pregnancies, the Sponsor or a designee may follow up by telephone, fax, 
email, and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information 
(e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to 
perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case.
5.6 ADVERSE EVENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE A DVERSE 
EVENT REPORTING PERI OD
The Sponsor should be notified if the Investigator or designee becomes aware of any 
SAE that occurs after the end of the AEreporting period (defined as 14days after the 
final dose of study drug), if the event is believed to be related to prior study drug 
treatment . These events should be reported through use of the Adverse Event eCRF 
and source form . The Investigator or designee should report these events directly to the 
Sponsor or its designee, either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the paper Clinical 
Trial Serious Adverse Event/Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form using the 
fax number or email address provided to investigators.
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 555.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEA LTH AUTHORITIE S, 
INVESTIGA TORS, IN STITUTIONA L REVIEW B OARDS, A ND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all SAEs and AESI against cumulative product 
experience to identify and expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to 
Investigator (or designee ), IRBs, ECs, and applicable health authorities based on 
applicable legislation.
Independent from the causality assessment, the following SAEs and non- SAEs of 
special interest will be reported to the FDA on an expedited basis: death, arrhythmia, 
syncope, dyspnea, palpitations, and chest pain . 
To determine reporting requirements for single AEcases, the Sponsor will assess the 
expectedness of these events through use of the reference safety information in the 
documents listed below :
Drug Document
Balovaptan RO5285119 V1a Receptor Antagonist (Balovaptan) 
Investigator's Brochure
Esomeprazole Esomeprazole US Package Insert
The Sponsor will compare the sev erity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the 
applicable reference document.
Reporting requirements will also be based on the Investigator or designee 's assessment 
of causality and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed.
An aggregate report of any clinically relevant imbalances that do not favor the test 
product will be submitted to health authorities.
6. STATISTICA L CONSIDERA TIONS AND ANAL YSIS PLA N
A statistical analysis plan will be generated and will be finalized prior to database lock . 
6.1 DETERMINA TION OF SA MPLE SIZE
Sixteen subjects will be enrolled with the target of at least 12 evaluable subjects 
available for the final PK analysis. Considering the o bserved residual CV% for AUC 0-inf 
from S tudy WP40038 of approximately 14%, with 12 subjects the 90% CI would be 
obtained by dividing/multiplying the ratio estimate by a factor of 1.11.
6.2 SUMMA RIES OF CONDUCT OF STUDY
The number of subjects who enroll, discontinue, or complete the study will be 
summarized . Reasons for premature study withdrawal will be listed and summarized. 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 56Enrollment and major protocol deviations will be listed and evaluated for their potential 
effects on the interpretation of study results.
6.3 SUMMA RIES OF DEMOGRA PHIC AND BA SELINE 
CHA RACTERISTICS
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized using means, standard 
deviations, medians, and ranges for continuous variables and proportions for categorical 
variables, as appropriate . Summaries will be presented overall and by treatment 
sequence .
6.4 EFFICA CY ANAL YSES
Not Applicable
6.5 SAFETY ANAL YSES
The Safety population will include all subjects who are randomized and receive at least 
one dose of the study medication (either balovaptan or esomeprazole ), whether 
prematurely withdrawn from the study or not .
Safety will be assessed through summaries of exposure to study treatment, adverse 
events, changes in laboratory test results, and changes in vital signs and ECGs.
Study tre atment exposure (such as treatment , duration [as applicable] ,and total dose 
received) will be summarized with descriptive statistics.
All verbatim AEterms will be mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities 
thesaurus terms, and AEseverity will be graded according to Table 3. All AEs, SAEs , 
AEs leading to death, AESIs , and AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation that 
occur on or after the first dose of study treatment (i.e., treatment -emergent adverse 
events) will be summarized by mapped term, appropriate thesaurus level, and severity 
grade . For events of varying severity, the highest grade will be used in the summaries .
Deaths and cause of death will be summarized.
Relevant laboratory, vital sign (pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and 
temperature), and ECG data will be displayed by time, with grades identified where 
appropriate . Additionally, a shift table of selected laboratory tests will be used to 
summarize the baseline and maximum postbaseline severity grade . Changes in vital 
signs and ECGs will be summarized.
6.6 PHA RMA COKINETICS ANAL YSES
The PK population will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of balovaptan and 
have sufficient evaluable concentrations to determine the overall exposure to balovaptan .
Subjects will be excluded from the PK analysis population if they significantly violate the 
inclusion or exclusion criteria, deviate significantly from the protocol, or if data are 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 57unavailable or incomplete. Excluded cases will be documented together with the reason 
for exclusion. All decisions on exclusions from the analysis will be made prior to 
database lock.
The following balovaptan, metabolites M2(as appropriate) and M3, and esomeprazole 
PK parameters will be estimated:
Cmax:maximum plasma concentration
AUC( 0-inf):area under the concentration -time curve from time extrapolated to infinity 
AUC( 0-24h):area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to 24 hours 
AUC last:area under the concentration -time curve from time 0 to the time of the last 
quantifiable concentration 
Tmax:time to reach Cmaxin plasma 
Clast:last quantifiable concentration 
Tlast:time to the last quantif iable concentration 
 Tlag: time between dosing and time of first balovaptan plasma concentration.
Cl/F: apparent clearance
Vd/F: apparent volume of distribution
T1/2:terminal elimination phase half -life
Individual and mean concentration versus time data will be plotted on linear and 
semi logarithmic scales. Plasma concentrations and derived plasma PK parameters will 
be listed for balovaptan and its metabolites. Summary statistics of PK parameters, 
includin g means, geometric means, medians, ranges, SD, CV% will be presented for 
each treatment. Analysis of variance models will be applied to the logarithmically 
transformed PK parameters of balovaptan AUC 0-infand C max, to investigate 1) the relative 
bioavailab ility of balovaptan 20 -mgdispersible tablets administered following a high -fat, 
high-calorie meal vs in the fasted state, and 2) the relative bioavailability of balovaptan 
20-mgdispersible tablets administered in the fasted state either alone or in combi nation 
with esomeprazole.
The effect of food on the PK of balovaptan will be assessed using the ratio and 90% CIs 
of the geometric least squares (LS) means of the plasma PK parameters Cmaxand 
AUC 0-inffor balovaptan. A linear mixed model with fixed effect s for treatment, period, 
sequence, and a random effect for subject nested in sequence will be used on the 
natural log -transformed parameters. Point estimates on the natural log scale will be 
exponentiated to obtain point estimates on the original scale of measurement. Geometric 
LS means will be provided for each treatment. Food had no relevant effect on the overall 
exposure of the capsule formulation of balovaptan but T maxwas shifted from 1 hour after 
dosing under fasted condition sto approximately 3 hours in fed conditions.
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 58The effect of esomeprazole on the PK of balovaptan will be assessed using the ratio and 
90% CIs of the geometric LS means of the plasma PK parameters: Cmaxand AUC 0-inffor 
balovaptan. A linear mixed model with a fixed effect for treatment and a random effect 
for subject will be used on the natural log -transformed parameters. Point estimates on 
the natural log scale will be exponentiated to obtain point estimates on the original scale 
of measurement. LS geometric means will be provided for each treatment.
In all comparisons, balovaptan under fasted conditions will be used as the reference. No 
adjustments will be made for multiplicity.
PK parameters will be estimated using standard non compartmental methods. 
Additi onal PK analyses maybe be conducted as appropriate forbalovaptan, M2 , and M3.

PRA will be responsible for data management of this study, including quality checking of 
the data . Data entered manually will be collected through use of eCRFs . In the event of 
discrepant data, the Sponsor will request data clarification from the sites.
PRA will produce a Data Management Plan that describes the quality checking to be 
performed on the data . Central laboratory data (safety) will be sent directly to PRA using 
PRA’s standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of these data. 
The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, including 
approval of the PRA’s data management plans and specifications . Data will be 
periodically transferred electronically from PRA to the Sponsor, and the Sponsor’s
standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these 
data. 
Electronic CRFs and correction documentation will b e maintained in the EDC system’s 
audit trail . System backups for data stored at the contract research organization ( CRO )
and records retention for the study data will be consistent with the CRO’s standard 
procedures . eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC 
system’s audit trail . System backups for data stored at the CRO and records retention 
for the study data will be consistent with the CRO’s standard procedures. 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 597.2 ELECTRONIC CA SE REPO RT FORMS 
eCRFs are to be completed through use o f a PRA EDC system . Sites will receive 
training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion . eCRFs will be 
submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in accordance with 
instructions from the Sponsor .
All eCRFs should be c ompleted by designated, trained site staff . eCRFs should be 
reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the Investigator or a designee.
At the end of the study, the Investigator will receive subject data for his or her site in a 
readable format on a co mpact disc that must be kept with the study records. 
Acknowledg ment of receipt of the compact disc is required.
7.3 SOURCE DA TA DOCUMENT ATION
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification and review to confirm that 
critical protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site 
personnel are accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents. 
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which subject data are recorded 
and documented for the first time . They include, but are not limited to, hospital records, 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subject -reported outcomes, 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automate d 
instruments (e.g., ECG) , copies of transcriptions that are certified after verification as 
being accurate and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic 
media, X -rays, subject files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and 
medico -technical departments involved in a clinical trial.
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan. This includes any protocol data to be entered 
directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and 
considered source data.
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data 
entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be reta ined per 
the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5.
To facilitate source data verification and review , the Investigator (or desi gnee s)and 
institutions must provide the Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and 
reports for trial -related monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review . The study site 
must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities.
7.4 USE OF CO MPUTERIZED SYSTEMS
When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical 
record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve 
Balovaptan —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd
Protocol WP41047 v1.0 60as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health 
authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research . An 
acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry 
of data . If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail 
that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person 
making the change, and date of the change.
7.5 RETENTION OF RECORDS
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of 
IMP, including eCRFs, electronic or paper subject reported outcome data (if applicable), 
Informed Consent Forms, laboratory test results, and medication inventory records, must 
be retained by the Principal Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or 
discontinuation of the study or for the length of time requir ed by relevant national or local 
health authorities, whichever is longer . After that period of time, the documents may be 
destroyed, subject to local regulations . 
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor . Written

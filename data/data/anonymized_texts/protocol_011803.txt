1.0 PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  AND  SCHEMA  
 
Triple  negative  breast  cancer  patients  with metastatic  or unresectable,  locally  advanced  disease  who 
require  radiation  therapy  to a measurable  tumor  site are eligible.  Prior  to treatment,  all patients  will 
receive  a biopsy  of the tumor  to be irradiated.  Utilizing  the Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  Homologous 
Recombination  Repair  (MSK -HRR)  Assay,  patients  will be identified  as either  HR-deficient  or HR- 
proficient.  Knowledge  of the HR repair  status  prior to treatment  is not necessary,  since  all patients  in 
the study  will receive  the same  treatment,  regardless  of the knowledge  of the tumor - concurrent  
cisplatin  and radiation  (RT) to the tumor.  
The primary  purpose  of the trial is to assess  whether  or not HR repair  status  is a sensitive  biomarker  
of response,  as measured  by complete  response  (CR) rate in patients  receiving  cisplatin  and 
radiation.  Cisplatin  will be given  once  a week( + 3 days)  for 1-2 weeks,  followed  by concurrent  delivery  
with RT to the tumor.  Following  the completion  of RT, pending  no toxicities,  but prior to the week  12 
post RT evaluable  timepoint,  patients  will continue  to receive  cisplatin  or until POD,  based  on MD 
discretion.  
 
Secondary  objectives  are to assess  time to progression and overall  response  rate (CR+PR+SD)  by 
HRR status.  Exploratory  objectives  are to assess  association  between  tumor  infiltrating  lymphocyte  
(TIL) and treatment  response  and to compare  the effectiveness  of RECIST  1.1 criteria  with PET 
Response  Criteria  in metabolically  active  tumors.  
At baseline,  all patients  will receive  PET-CT. An MR will be obtained  in addition  only if the study  
radiologist  determines  that tumor  is insufficiently  evaluable  with PET-CT. At 12 +2 weeks  after 
completion  of RT, patients  will undergo  the same  imaging  modality  used  at baseline  assessment  
(PET -CT or MR) in order  to assess  treatment  response.  The target  accrual  is 54 patients,  to be 
achieved  within  3.5 years.

2 Obtain  study  staging  only if unavailable  28 days prior to study  registration.  All patients  will receive baseline  PET-CT performed  
at MSKCC.  An MR will be added  if PET-CT is deemed  to be insufficient  for tumor  evaluation  by the study  radiologist  at baseline  
evaluation.  
3 Radiation  dose  will be 250 cGy × 15 fx = 3750  cGy to the metastatic  site delivered  in 3 weeks  for metastatic  disease  or 200 
cGy x 25 fx=5000  cGy delivered  in 5 weeks  to the chest  wall,  breast  and/or  regional  lymph  nodes  , plus an optional  10-14 Gy 
boost  to areas  of gross  tumor,  for non-metastatic/locallyrecurrent  disease.  
4  The length  of one Cisplatin  cycle  is 21 days.If  cisplatin  is withheld,  the cycle  count  for treatment  is also held.  
5 Cisplatin  will be once  a week  (+3 days).  The dose  of cisplatin  can be reduced  in the event  of toxicities  defined  in Section  4.2.1.  
6 Following  the completion  of RT, pending  no toxicities,  but prior to the week  12 post RT evaluable  timepoint,  patients  will 
continue  to receive  cisplatin  or until POD,  based  on MD discretion.  
7 At 12+2 weeks  after RT, all patients  will receive PET-CT for treatment  response  and/or  staging.  MR will also be obtained  if the 
patient  had an MR at baseline.  
8 PET-CT +/- MR will occur  at 12+2 weeks  after RT. PET/CT  +/- MRI q6 months  after RT is recommended  but not required.  
 
 
2.0 OBJECTIVES  AND SCIENTIFIC  AIMS  
 
The primary  objective  of this trial is to evaluate  the performance  of the MSK -HR repair  assay  as a 
biomarker  in predicting  response  to concurrent  cisplatin  and RT in breast  cancer  patients  with 
measurable  metastatic  or unresectable,  locally  advanced  disease.  Radiographic  complete  response  
(CR) of the irradiated  tumor  will be counted  as a positive  response  to treatment.  Radiographic  
response  less than a CR, progression  of the irradiated  tumor  or appearance  of a new lesion  within  the 
radiated  field will be categorized  as a failure  to respond  to treatment.  All other  sites of metastatic  
disease  that is outside  of the irradiated  field will be monitored  and counted  toward  disease  
progression. 
Secondary  objectives  are to assess:  
 
• Partial response,  stable  disease  and progression  of disease  within  the irradiated  tumor  as well as 
systemically  (in sites distant  to the irradiated  tumor)  
• Overall  time to progression  
• Toxicities  of concurrent  cisplatin  and radiation

Exploratory  objectives  are to assess:  
 
• Examine  immune  correlates  to determine  the impact  of treatment  on anti-tumor  immunity  and as a 
predictor  of treatment  response  
• Determine  the sensitivity  of ctDNA detection  in patients  receiving  chemoradiation  for metastatic 
and locally  recurrent  TNBC  
• Compare  the efficacy  of RECIST  1.1 vs. PET Response  Criteria  (PRC)  as measurement  tools for 
treatment  response  
 
3.1 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
 
Triple  negative  breast  cancer  (TNBC),  defined  as estrogen  receptor  and progesterone  receptor  levels  
<1% and HER2 -negative  (0-1+ by immunohistochemistry  or HER2/CEP17  ratio <2 or HER2  
signals/cell  <4 by in-situ hybridization  [1]), comprises  12-17% of breast  cancers.  TNBC  is associated  
with rapid  growth,  early  metastasis  and unfavorable  prognosis  compared  to other  subtypes  of breast  
cancer  [2]. Since  targeted  treatment  options  such as endocrine  therapy  and HER2 -directed  therapies  
are unavailable,  chemotherapy  is the mainstay  of treatment.  Although  chemotherapy  and radiation  
therapy  (RT) are common  treatments  for palliation  and local control  in metastatic  or recurrent  breast  
cancer,  there  are no effective  biomarkers  that can reliably  predict  the sensitivity  of these  tumors  to 
these  treatments.  
TNBCs  are characterized  by a genomic  profile  that is similar  to those  of breast  cancer  patients  who 
are BRCA1 -mutation  carriers.  This profile  is indicative  of defects  in the BRCA  pathway,  therefore  
resulting  in a “BRCA -like” phenotype . Although  rarely  mutated  in sporadic  breast  cancer  (<5%  of 
breast  cancer  patients  harbor  germline  mutations  in either  gene),  BRCA1  expression  has been  
reported  to be reduced  in a small  number  of sporadic  tumors,  particularly  in TNBC  [3-5].  BRCA1  and 
BRCA2  are only two of many  proteins  involved  in executing  HRR  [6]. A subset  of sporadic  breast  
cancers  may also have defects  in HR, in the absence  of mutations  in either  BRCA1  or BRCA2  [7-9]. 
3.2 Rationale  for Homologous  Recombination  (HR)  Repair  Testing  In the Clinic  
 
BRCA1  and BRCA2  are essential  for error-free repair  of double  strand  breaks  (DSB)  induced  by 
ionizing  radiation  and certain  DNA  damaging  chemotherapeutic  agents,  through  their activity  in the 
BRCA1 -BRCA2 -RAD51  DNA  repair  pathway  of homologous  recombination  (HR).  In homologous  
recombination  (HR),  both BRCA1  and BRCA2  are required  for the recruitment  of Rad51  to sites of 
DSB’s,  with BRCA2  interacting  directly  with Rad51.  Rad51  is a vital downstream  protein  required  for 
homology  search  and strand  invasion,  using  the sister  chromatid  as a template  for error-free repair  of 
the DSB.  In the absence  of HR, cells rely on more  error-prone  mechanisms,  including  non- 
homologous  end-joining,   in which  pieces  of DNA  are pieced  together  in a quick  but error-prone  way, 
resulting  in deletions  of significant  amounts  of genetic  material  and chromosomal  instability.  
PARP  is an important  enzyme  involved  in base -excision  repair  which  repairs  endogenous  or therapy - 
induced  single  strand  breaks.  Inhibition  of that pathway  by a PARP  inhibitor  results  in the 
accumulation  of large  amounts  of single  strand  breaks  which  can be converted  to double  strand

breaks  at stalled  replication  forks.  In HR-proficient  cells,  these  DSB’s  are repaired  by homology  
directed  repair  which  is a Rad51 -dependent  process.  In HR-deficient  cells,  however,  such as cells 
with loss of BRCA1,  BRCA2  or other  proteins  involved  in the complex  BRCA1 -BRCA2  pathway,  the 
repair  machinery  of the cell can be overwhelmed,  leading  to error-prone  repair  by alternative  
mechanisms  such as non-homologous   end joining,  leading  to chromosomal  instability  and cell death.  
Inhibition  of homologous  recombination  or PARPs  may be well tolerated  in isolation,  but combined  
inactivation  of these  distinct  DNA -repair  pathways,  it can result  in cell death  through  a process  called  
“synthetic  lethality.”  
In preclinical  models,  BRCA1  and BRCA2 -deficient  cells have been  shown  to be sensitive  to PARP  
inhibitors.  However,  clinical  studies  utilizing  PARP  inhibitors  in unselected  sporadic  TNBC  have failed  
to show  benefit  of PARP  inhibitors  in improving  progression -free survival  [10]. These  findings  
underscore  the importance  of assaying  the function  of the HRR  pathway  in order  to better  identify  
TNBC  patients  who would  most  likely  to benefit  from DNA  repair -based  therapies.  
 
3.3 The Memorial  Sloan  Kettering  HR Repair  (HRR)  Assay  
There  are two components  of the MSK  HRR assay.  The first, the induction  of RAD51  foci, is a 
functional  assay  that assesses  HRR status  in real-time,  prior to the initiation  of study  treatment.  The 
second,  the CGH  (comparative  genomic  hybridization)  array,  validates  the RAD51  foci by detecting  
copy  number  changes  in the genome  that are characteristic  of HRR  status.  Fresh  tumor  tissue  is 
required  for the RAD51  foci assay,  whereas  extracted  DNA  from the fresh  tumor  specimens  is used  
for array -CGH  studies.  The assays  will be conducted  in the lab of Dr. Simon  Powell.  
The rationale  for using  both components  of the assay  is to detect  HRR deficiency  as determined  by 
RAD51  foci assembly,  and then to validate  these  results  with the CGH read-out of the genomic  
architecture.  We anticipate  that validation  with the array  CGH will be particularly  useful  in identifying  
“conversion”  patients  in whom  HRR-deficient  status  may have converted  to HR-proficient  status  
secondary  to pre-treated  with multiple  systemic  agents  prior to study  enrollment.  
 
3.3.1  RAD51  Foci 
 
DNA  repair  proteins  accumulate  into foci in the nuclei  of cells following  DNA  damage  including  
irradiation,  and these  foci can be detected  by immunofluorescence   and represent  sites of ongoing  
repair.  This method  has proven  to be a robust  method  of observing  HR in cells [11].  Given  its 
downstream  location  in the BRCA1 -BRCA2  pathway  of HR, the recruitment  of Rad51  into foci 
correlates  well with the ability  to carry  out HR and has been  utilized  to assay  the integrity  of the entire  
pathway.  BRCA1  and BRCA2  deficient  cells are unable  to form RAD51  foci following  exposure  to 
ionizing  radiation  [12]. Powell  et al. has previously  reported  the feasibility  of quantifying  ionizing  
radiation  (IR) induced  RAD51  and other  DNA  repair  foci formation  ex vivo in fresh  pretreatment  
breast  cancer  specimens  as a means  of assessing  the function  of the BRCA1 -BRCA2 -RAD51  
pathway[ 13].

Figure  2: Immunofluorescent  representation  of the induction  of nuclear  foci in human  tumor  
cells  with and without  RT: a) There  is prominent  phosphorylation  of histone  H2AX  (at serine  139) 
following  10Gy.  H2AX  was used  as an upstream  event  in the DNA damage  response  as a control  for 
cell viability  and adequacy  of the preparation.  In one of the cells shown,  there  is recruitment  of both 
BRCA1  and RAD51  into foci following  10Gy.  At least 100 cells were  counted  in each  condition  (no RT 
vs RT) and cells were  considered  positive  if they have >5 foci. The nuclei  of the MCF 7 cells are  
stained  blue with DAPI,  and on the right following  10Gy,  >50%  increase  in rad51  foci is visible  after RT, 
suggesting  an intact  BRCA1 -BRCA2  pathway   b) The nuclei  of the MCF 7 cells are stained  blue with 
DAPI,  and on the right following  10Gy.  There  was normal  gammaH2AX  foci formation  upstream,  but a 
failure  to recruit  BRCA1  or Rad51  into foci following  10Gy.  This tumor  was therefore  deemed  to have a 
defective  BRCA1 -BRCA2  pathway.  
 
 
3.3.2  Array -CGH  
Array  CGH uses microarray  technology  to assess  for copy  number  changes  (genomic  gains,  
heterozygous   losses,  high-level amplifications,  homozygous  deletions).  DNA  from a test sample  and 
normal  reference  sample  are labeled  differentially  using  different  fluorophores,  and hybridized  to 
several  thousand  probes.  The probes  are derived  from most  of the known  genes  and non-coding  
regions  of the genome  and printed  on a glass  slide.  
The ratio of the fluorescence  intensity  of the test to that of the reference  DNA  is then calculated,  to 
measure  the copy  number  changes  for a particular  location  in the genome.  Typical  CGH genomic  
profiles  from breast  cancers  in BRCA1  and BRCA2  mutation  carriers  are characterized  by prominent  
large  segment  deletions  and some  gains  likely  due to aberrant  processing  of chromatid  breaks  during  
mitosis.  In contrast,  sporadic  tumors  tend to have one of two types  of genome  profiles,  with either  
very few larger  altered  segments  or a high number  of small  copy  number  alterations  throughout  the 
genome,  with occasional high-level amplification  events.

assay.  On the right are 6 HRR -proficient  tumors.  Gains  are shown  in red and losses  are shown  in blue. The 6 
HRR -deficient  tumors  characteristically  show  a greater  number  of large  deletions  and some  gains,  compared  
to the 6 HRR -proficient  tumors,  displaying  a BRCA -like genomic  landscape  with significantly  more  deletions  of 
large  segments  of genetic  material  likely due to aberrant  processing  of chromatid  breaks  . 
 
3.3.3  Exome  Resequencing  
 
To evaluate  for homologous  recombination  pathway  alterations  in genes  other  than BRCA1  and 
BRCA2,  we will obtain  whole  exome  resequencing  data through  the MSK  Genomics  Core  Facility  
using  genomic  DNA  obtained  from core biopsy  samples  and matched  against  normal  tissue  (buffy  
coat of peripheral  blood  samples).   Exome  resequencing  of breast  cancer  samples  in our pilot study  
that were  MSK -HRR  deficient  and BRCA1/2  wild type revealed  that 65% had potentially  deleterious  
alterations  in other  components  of the HR pathway  (unpublished).   Quality  control  of extracted  DNA,  
and sequencing  library  preparation  will be performed  by the MSK  Genomics  Core  Facility.   We will 
use a data-analysis  pipeline  wherein  germline  variants  will be filtered  out of sequencing  analyses  
using  matched  blood  samples.   Thus,  germline  alterations  will not become  apparent  to researchers.  
 
3.3.4  Preliminary  Data  on the Frequency  of HRR  Defects  by Breast  Cancer  Subtype  
 
The frequency  of BRCA1 -BRCA2 -RAD51  pathway  defects  in sporadic  breast  cancer  has been  
quantified  using  the MSK  HRR  assay  in 60 invasive  breast  cancer  patients  receiving  lumpectomy  or 
mastectomy  in whom  fresh  tumor  tissue  specimens  were  collected  at the time of surgery  (IRB 
protocol  #10-093).  Overall,  seventeen  of 60 (28%)  tumors  displayed  defective  RAD51  recruitment

following  ex-vivo irradiation.  HRR -deficiency  was seen  in all subtypes  of breast  cancer  but was 
enriched  in TNBC:  7 of 33 (21%)  ER positive,  4 of 14(29%)  HER2  amplified,  and 6 of 13 (48%)  
TNBCs.  HRR deficiency  was not associated  with low BRCA1  mRNA  or protein  expression.  As noted  
above,  HRR -deficient  sporadic  breast  cancers  displayed  genomic  landscapes  characterized  by large  
segment  gains  and losses  due to genomic  instability  from loss of HR [14]. 
 
 
3.3 Rationale  for Concurrent  Cisplatin  and RT 
 
Biologically,  cisplatin  is a known  radiosensitizer,  with both additive  and synergistic  potentiation  of 
radiation.  Platinum  potentiates  radiation -induced  cell injury  through  a number  of putative  
mechanisms. These agents act via formation of DNA cross links resulting in DNA double-strand 
breaks.  When  cisplatin  is integrated  into DNA  adjacent  to a radiation -induced  single  cell strand  break,  
it can make  the break  more  difficult  to repair  and thus lead to cell death  [15,16]. In addition,  cisplatin  
increases  cellular  platinum  uptake  [16], and enhance  formation  of toxic platinum  intermediates  [17]. 
The potentiation  of radiation -induced  cell injury  appears  under  both oxic and hypoxic  conditions  [18]. 
 
Preclinical studies  have shown  that the combination  of cisplatin  and RT delivers  the maximum  ex- 
vitro stress  response  needed  to stimulate  HRR repair,  compared  to cisplatin  or RT when  delivered  
individually.  Mouse  embryo  fibroblast  cells with mutated  DNA  repair  pathways  were  measured  for 
responses  after cisplatin,  radiation  and combination  treatments.  The combination  treatment  showed  
that inhibition  of the HRR pathway  resulted  in super  additive  effects,  compared  to cisplatin  or RT 
alone  [19]. 
 
Concurrent  cisplatin  and radiation treatment  is standard  of care in the definitive  treatment  of 
advanced  head  and neck as well as cervical  cancer  [20-30]. A large  meta -analysis  has established  
the survival  benefit  of concurrent  chemoradiation  versus  RT alone  for head  and neck cancer  [27]. 
The efficacy  and safety  profile  of concurrent  cisplatin  and RT in cervical  cancer  has also been  well 
established  in randomized  trials [20-24]. The toxicities  of concurrent  cisplatin  and RT are specific  to 
the irradiated  site but are generally  tolerable.  Adverse  events  among  cervical  cancer  patients  who 
received  both cisplatin  and RT included  12% grade  3 leukopenia,  1.1%  thrombocytopenia,  5.6%  other  
hematologic  toxicities  and 4.5%  grade  3 gastrointestinal  toxicities.  Grade  2 toxicities  included  14.7%  
leukopenia,  2.3%  thrombocytopenia,  15.3%  other  hematologic  toxicities  and 15.9%  gastrointestinal  
toxicities.  No treatment -related   deaths  were  reported  in these  trials.  
Whereas  q3 week  dosing  (100 mg/m2) of cisplatin  has been  shown  to result  in significant  toxicity  in 
patients  with laryngeal  cancer  when  delivered  concurrently  with RT (40), lower  weekly  doses  (30-50 
mg/m2) has been  well tolerated  [29,30]. Based  on these  data,  we plan to utilize  weekly  cisplatin  (+ 3 
days)  at 25 mg/m2 prior to and after RT. During  RT, the dose  of cisplatin  will be weekly  (+ 3 days)  25 
mg/m2. 
Following  the completion  of RT, pending  no toxicities,  but prior to the week  12 post RT evaluable  
timepoint,  patients  will either  continue  to receive  cisplatin  or until POD,  based  on MD discretion.

3.4 Evidence  for Cisplatin  and Biomarkers  of Response  in Triple  Negative  Breast  Cancer  
 
Currently,  there  is no standard  chemotherapy  for the treatment  of metastatic  or recurrent  triple  
negative  breast  cancer.  Generally,  these  patients  receive  a single  agent  chemotherapy,  of which  
there  are many  options.  The standard  chemotherapy  treatment  for breast  cancer  patients  with 
BRCA1  or BRCA2  mutations  are the same  as those  treatments  for sporadic  breast  cancer  patients,  
which  do not include  platinum  chemotherapy  for non-metastatic  disease.  The “BRCA -ness” features  
of sporadic  TNBC  are suggestive  of sensitivity  to interstrand  crosslinking  agents  such as platinum  
chemotherapy  [31]. There  is mounting  preclinical  as well as early  clinical  evidence  suggesting  
benefits  of platinum  chemotherapy  in patients  with BRCA1  and BRCA2  mutations  and TNBC.  
Single -agent  weekly  cisplatin  is not routinely  used  in breast  cancer,  but there  is growing  use of 
cisplatin  in triple  negative  breast  cancer  because  patients  with BRCA  mutations  appear  to be uniquely  
sensitive  to cisplatin  in non-randomized  trials,  and the broader  array  of TNBC  patients  with HRR 
defects  (but no known  BRCA  mutations)  are thought  to be sensitive  to cisplatin.  Several  clinical  
studies  have evaluated  the role of platinum  chemotherapy  among  TNBC  patients,  including  those   
with and without  BRCA1  or BRCA2  mutations.  A Dutch  study  demonstrated  that patients  with BRCA - 
like genomic  profiles  observed  a greater  benefit  with high dose  platinum  chemotherapy  vs 
conventional  chemotherapy,  compared  to patients  with non-BRCA -like tumors  [32]. A proof -of- 
concept  neoadjuvant  study  from Poland  involving  12 breast  cancer  patients  who were  BRCA1  
mutation  carriers  demonstrated  a pCR of 83% following  treatment  with 4 cycles  of single -agent  
cisplatin  75 mg/m2 [33]. Two studies,  both from the Dana -Farber  Cancer  Institute,  evaluated  
neoadjuvant  cisplatin  at 75 mg/m2 for four cycles.  Silver  et al reported  a response  rate of 21% in a 
study  of 28 unselected  TNBC  [34], whereas  the larger  n=51  patient  study  by Ryan  et al [35], in which  
patients  also received  bevacizumab  every  3 weeks  for three  cycles,  demonstrated  a pCR rate of 15% 
among  patients  without  BRCA  mutations.  Factors  associated  with good  cisplatin  response  in the 
Silver  et al. study  included  young  age (p=0.001),  low BRCA1:mRNA  expression  (p= 0.03),  BRCA1  
promoter  methylation  (p=0.04),  p53 nonsense  or frameshift  mutations  (p=0.01),  and a gene  
expression  signature  of E2F3  activation  (p=0.03),  suggesting  that biomarkers  other  than BRCA1  may 
be predictive  for cisplatin  response  [34]. 
A study  of preoperative  cisplatin  in early -stage  breast  cancer  patients  with germline  BRCA1  mutations  
demonstrated  high rates  of pathologic  complete  response  (72%)  [36]. Others  have shown  high rates  
of pathologic  complete  response  in mutation  carriers,  including  a neoadjuvant  trial of gemcitabine,  
carboplatin  and iniparib.  Among  17 enrolled  women  with germline  BRCA1  or BRCA2  mutations,   
15/17  (88%)  achieved  a pathologic  complete  response  (pCRs)  or had minimal  residual  disease  at the 
time of surgery  [35]. 
Recently  published  results  from the GepardSixto  (GBG  66) trial also suggest  a beneficial  role for 
platinum  chemotherapy  in TNBC.  This trial included  595 patients  with HER2+  and TNBC.   All patients  
received  paclitaxel  and non-pegylated -liposomal  doxorubicin.  HER2+  patients  also received  
trastuzumab   and lapatinib,  whereas  TNBC  patients  also received  bevacizumab.  All patients  were  
randomized  1:1 to receive  concurrent  carboplatin  or not, stratified  by subtype.  Among  the TNBC  
patients,  pCR rates  increased  by 20%;  84 (53.2%)  of 158 patients  achieved  a pCR with carboplatin,

compared  with 58 (36.9%)  of 157 without  (p=0.005).   This effect  was not seen  among  the HER2+  
patients,  45 (32.8%)  of 137 of  whom  achieved  a pCR with carboplatin  compared  with 50 (36.8%)  of 
136 without  (p=0.58)  [37]. The advantage  seen  with carboplatin  was driven  by patients  with triple  
negative  disease.  The regimen  was very toxic,  with about  50% of patients  receiving  carboplatin  
having  to discontinue  treatment  due to adverse  events.  
The preliminary  results  of CALGB/Alliance  40603  study  (presented  at the 2013  San Antonio  Breast  
Cancer  Sympos ium) also support  these  findings.  In this study,  454 patients  with stage  II/III TNBC  
were  randomized  to standard  neoadjuvant  chemotherapy  or chemotherapy  plus either  carboplatin,  
bevacizumab,  or the combination  of carboplatin/bevacizumab.   Patients  were  randomly  assigned  in a 
2×2 schema  to receive  weekly  paclitaxel  plus dose -dense  anthracycline/cyclophosphamide   +/- either  
the addition  of bevacizumab  or the addition  of carboplatin.  For patients  receiving  carboplatin,  60% 
achieved  a pCR,  compared  to 46% of those  who did not carboplatin  - an increase  of 76% (p=0.0018).  
Defined  by no disease  in the breast  or axilla,  pCR rates  were  54% with carboplatin  vs 41% without  
carboplatin,  a 71% increase  (p=0.0029).  When  the combination  of carboplatin  and bevacizumab  were  
used  in addition  to chemotherapy,  67% of patients  achieved  a pCR,  however,  a significant  treatment  
interaction  between  the two drugs  was not shown.  Bevacizumab  resulted  in a greater  frequency  of 
adverse  effects,  as did the combination  of bevacizumab  and carboplatin.  Patients  receiving  
carboplatin were more likely to experience neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. 
 
Finally,  the PrECOG  0105  study  included  80 TNBC  and BRCA1/2  mutated  patients  treated  with 
neoadjuvant  carboplatin,  gemcitabine  and iniparib  [38]. Pathologic  CR was achieved  in 36% of the 
overall  population,  47% in the BRCA1/2  mutated  population  and 56% in triple  negative  patients  who 
also had BRCA  1/2 mutations.  The toxicity  profile  was more  favorable  than that of the Gepar  Sixto  
regimen,  with myelosuppression  (grade  3 or 4 neutropenia  in 49%)  and elevations  in liver enzymes  
(grade  3 in 24%).  
 
Whereas  the aforementioned  trials evaluated  platinum  chemotherapy  in the neoadjuvant  setting,  the 
efficacy  of platinum  chemotherapy  has also been  studied  in metastatic  TNBC  patients.  TBCRC  009 
was a multicenter  single -arm phase  III      study  of single -agent  platinum  in 86 patients  with metastatic  
TNBC  [39]. Patients  received  cisplatin  75mg/m2 or carboplatin  AUC=6  every  3 wks, by physician  
choice.  The objective  response  rate (ORR)  was 30.2%  overall,  including  4 CR (4.7%),  22 PR 
(25.6%).  The ORR  was 54.5%  vs. 19.7%  in BRCA1/2  carriers  (n=11)  vs. non-carriers  (n=66);  
(p=0.02).  Six long-term responders  remain  disease -free at median  follow  up of 4 yrs, 3 of whom  
stopped  treatment  after 6 cycles.  Exploratory  subgroup  analysis  of RR: Cisplatin  37%,  Carboplatin  
23%;  1st line therapy  31.7%,  2nd line therapy  20%.  33% of pts progressed  by 6 weeks,  but 33% 
remained  on study  for ≥ 6 mos.  51 treatment -related   grade  3/4 toxicities  occurred.  2 patients  had 
grade  4 toxicities  (neutropenia  (1) and hypertension  (1)), while  the others  were  grade  3 (fatigue  (8), 
neutropenia  (6), anemia  (5), hyponatremia  (4)). 
 
In a subsequent  analysis  presented  at the ASCO  2014  Annual  Meeting,  predictors  of response  to 
platinum  chemotherapy  were  assessed,  including  p63/p73  expression  by RT-PCR as a predictor  of 
response.  Tumor -based  exploratory  studies  included  gene  expression  (GE) profiling,  PIK3CA  and 
p53 mutational  status,  and homologous  recombination  deficiency  (HRD)  assays  correlating  with

BRCA1/2  inactivation.  All biomarkers  except  the HRD assays  failed  to predict  responses  to platinum  
chemotherapy.  Types  of HRD assays  performed  included  Loss  of Heterozygosity  (LOH),  Telomere  
Allelic  Imbalance  (TAI),  and Large -scale  State  Transition  (LST).  Among  the small  group  of 22 patients  
with available  tissue,  scores  in all of the HRD assays  were  higher  in BRCA1/2  carriers  than non- 
carriers,  and in responders  than non-responders  (HRD -LST responders  vs. nonresponders,  
p=0.0016).  
 
Birback  et al. have also suggested  that the number  of subchromosomal  regions  with allelic  imbalance  
extending  to the telomere  [N(tAI)]  is predictive  for pathologic  response  to preoperative  cisplatin  
treatment  in sporadic  TNBC  patients.  They  found  an inverse  relationship  between  BRCA1  expression  
and N(tAI),  suggesting  that N(tAI)  could  be a genomic  measure  of DNA  repair  pathway  defects  and 
thereby  identify  patients  who could  benefit  from cisplatin  therapy[ 40] 
 
The results  from a clinical  trial performed  at Washington  University  provide  the most  compelling  
preliminary  evidence  for this proposed  study  [41]. In this trial, neoadjuvant  pre-operative  cisplatin  + 
RT were  administered  for locally  advanced  triple -negative  breast  cancer  patients,  all of whom  
received  modified  radical  mastectomy  as definitive  surgical  treatment.  Response  was analyzed  by 
HRR status,  utilizing  the functional  HRR assay  developed  by Powell  et al. Among  the 10 patients  
enrolled  to date,  6/10 show  pathologic  CR, of whom  5/6 (83%)  were  HR-defective.  Given  the small  
number  of patients  accrued  to this trial, further  validation  of the results  are required,  and is therefore  
the aim of this proposed  protocol.  
 
3.5 Immune  Correlates  
A large  body  of research  using  experimental  animal  models  indicates  that the immune  system  controls  
the development  of cancer  through  immune  surveillance  mechanisms[ 42]. Histologic               
analyses  of solid malignancies  reveal  that they are infiltrated  by various  cells of the innate  and 
adaptive  immune  system  [43]. Therapeutic  modulation  of the immune  system  for clinical  benefit in 
cancer  patients  has been  demonstrated  by numerous  modalities,  including  antibody  blockade  of 
inhibitory  molecules,  adoptive  T cell transfer,  and autologous  cell-based  vaccines  [44-47]. A recent  
large -scale  meta -analysis  of the correlation  of tumor  infiltrating  T cells with survival  clearly  establishes  
that a relative  high density  of TH1 and cytotoxic  memory  T cells correlated  with a favorable  prognosis  
in the majority  of cancers  [48]. 
Tumor  infiltrating  lymphocytes  (TILs)  may be a useful  histological  predictor  of benefit  from 
chemotherapy  in breast  cancer  patients,  although it has not been  established  whether  or not 
response  to chemotherapy  would  be specific  to a class  of chemotherapy.  Specific  to breast  cancer,  
the evaluation  of TILs has been  shown  in the GeparSixto  (GBG  66) trial to be relevant  for response  to 
chemotherapy  in triple  negative  and Her2 -positive  early  breast  cancers  [37,49]. In this analysis,  a 
lymphocyte  predominant  pattern of infiltrate  was predictive  of a complete  pathologic  response  to 
neoadjuvant  chemotherapy.  Similarly,  the association  of TILs and response  to trastuzumab   and 
chemotherapy  (epirubicin/cyclophosphamide  with docetaxel  +/- capecitabine)  was evaluated  in 156 
HER2+  patients  from the neoadjuvant  GeparQuattro  trial [50]. TILs were  associated  with higher  
responses  to the trastuzumab  and chemotherapy  combination,  and tumor -mediated  
immunosuppression  was evident  in the lymphocytic  infiltrate,  with PD-1 and IDO1  significantly

13  
  
 
predictive  of trastuzumab  benefit.  
The prognostic  value  of TILs has also been  validated  in a combined  analysis  of two Phase  III 
randomized  adjuvant  breast  cancer  clinical  trials [37,51-54]. In these  studies,  the percentage  of 
intratumoral  and stromal  lymphocytes  in pre-treatment  tumor  biopsies  was found  to be an 
independent  predictor  of pCR in both the training  and validation  cohorts.  Higher  TIL pathologic  scores  
were  associated  with a better  prognosis:  for every  10% increment  in stromal  TIL, a 14% reduction  of 
risk for recurrence  or death  was observed  (p=0.02),  and for every  10% increment  in intratumoral  TIL, a 
28% risk reduction  was seen  (p=0.06).  Multivariate  analysis  confirmed  stromal  TIL to be an 
independent  prognostic  marker  of disease -free survival.  
Collectively,  these  data suggest  that the natural  course  of breast  cancer  as well as the response  to 
therapy  is linked  to the degree  by which  the tumor  is recognized  by the immune  system.  Response  to 
radiotherapy  may be also be predicted  by the level of TIL, however  data supporting  this in breast  
cancer  is scant.  In squamous  cell carcinoma  of the head  and neck as well as rectal  cancer  however,  
TILs can predict  response  to combination  chemoradiotherapy  [55,56]. The induction  of an immune  
response  by radiotherapy  may also have important  consequences.  Several  studies  have shown  the 
various  mechanisms  by which  RT stimulates  the immune  system.  One effect  of localized  tumor  
irradiation  is the exposure  of a large  amount  of tumor  antigens  in the form of necrotic  and apoptotic  
tumor  cells [57]. The contexts  in which  these  antigens  are presented  to the immune  system  are also 
impacted  by tumor  irradiation.  Tumor  radiotherapy  leads  to an inflammatory  tumor  microenvironment  
by inducing  the expression  of several  proinflammatory  cytokines  [5858]. In addition,  upregulation  of 
major  histocompatibility  molecules  and costimulatory  molecules  can potentiate  effector  cytolytic  T cell 
responses  [59]. 
The pretreatment  biopsy  planned  in this study  will allow  for the comprehensive  assessme  nt of TIL 
which  will be correlated  to response.  This will provide  important  insight  into the role of the tumor  
immunity  in the response  to chemoradiotherapy.  In addition  the assessment  of homologous  
recombination  can also factor  into the endogenous  response  of the immune  system  to the tumor  as 
well as response  to therapy.  The effect  of homologous  recombination  on tumor  immunity  is not well 
characterized,  however  the induction  of microsatellite  instability  as a pathway  of carcinogenesis  has 
clearly  been  linked  to tumor  immune  response  [60]. Tumor  cells with deficient  DNA  mismatch  repair  
develop  microsatellite  instability  and the resulting  tumors  are densely  infiltrated  by TILs [61]. It is 
suggested  that mismatch  repair  deficiency  leads  to numerous  insertion/deletions  that ultimately  
translate  to the generation  of tumor -specific  neopeptides  that can then be recognized  by the immune  
system  [62]. Radiation  administered  to a tumor  with an underlying  homologous  recombination  defect  
may lead to significant  “epitope  spreading”  resulting  in the induction  of an immune  response  against  
newly  recognized  tumor  associated  antigens.  This study  will begin  to address  the immune  
consequences  of tumor  genomic  instability.

3.6 Circulating  Tumor  DNA  (ctDNA)  Sensitivity  
 
In a number  of clinical  settings,  circulating  tumor  DNA(ctDNA)  has emerged  as a promising  biomarker  
of disease  burden  that in some  cases  provides  greater  sensitivity  than imaging.   Furthermore,  ctDNA  
in patients  with very high disease  burdens  can also be used  to track  emergence  of treatment  resistant  
subclones[ 63,64].  However,  ctDNA  in the setting  of cisplatin  and radiation  for recurrent/metastatic  
breast  cancer  remains  entirely  uninves tigated  and the sensitivity  of detection  is unknown.  
 
When  feasible,  we will collect  1 tube of blood  (8-10mL)  in EDTA  or Streck  tubes[ 65] for ctDNA  
analysis  at the scheduled  time periods  of blood  sample  collection  as outlined  in Section  10.0.   The 
plasma  will be isolated  through  centrifugation  (820xg  x 10 minutes,  then 16,000g  x 10 minutes)  and 
stored  at -80C for analysis.   Using  known  somatic  mutations  obtained  through  exome  resequencing  
data of tumor  samples,  mutant  alleles  in ctDNA  will be assessed  through  amplification  of loci from 
extracted  cell free DNA  and massively  parallel  sequencing  or detected  through  digital  droplet  
polymerase  chain  reaction  (ddPCR).  We will use a data-analysis  pipeline  wherein  incidentally  
sequenced  germline  variants  will be filtered  out of sequencing  analyses  using  matched  DNA  from 
buffy coat DNA.  Thus,  germline  alterations  will not become  apparent  to researchers.  
 
 
4.1 OVERVIEW  OF STUDY  DESIGN/INTERVENTION  
 
4.2 Design  
 
This is a single -arm Phase  II trial testing  the efficacy  of concurrent  cisplatin  and radiation  in breast  
cancer  patients  with measurable  metastatic  or locally  recurrent  tumor,  based  on HRR status  as 
determined  by the MSK -HRR  assay.  Prior  to study  enrollment,  all patients  will require  assessment  by 
the radiation  oncologist  and medical  oncologist.  Patients  will receive  a baseline  PET-CT +/- MR for 
evaluation  of the tumor  to be irradiated  and to assess  extent  of disease  systemically.  If unavailable  
within  the time specifications  of the study,  the PET-CT +/- MR will be performed  after study  
registration.  Biopsy  of the tumor  to be irradiated  will be performed.  Fresh  tissue  specimens  will be 
sent to the laboratory  of Dr. Simon  Powell  for performance  of the MSK -HRR  Assay.  Results  from the 
functional  assay  will be utilized  towards  the primary  endpoint.  Additional  unutilized  tissue  will be sent 
to the Immune   Monitoring  Facility  Laboratories  for TIL analyses  to be conducted  by Dr. George  Plitas.  
Bloodwork  will be sent to the lab of Dr. Daniel  Higginson  for ctDNA  analyses.  After the biopsy,  
patients  will undergo  simulation  for palliative  radiation  to the tumor  site. Following  simulation,  patient  
will initiate  a 25 mg/m2 infusion  of cisplatin once  a week  + 3 days.  The starting  dose  will depend  on 
baseline  laboratory  results  within  28 days prior to registration.  Following  1-2 weeks  of cisplatin,  RT  
will be initiated.  Weekly  cisplatin  (+ 3 days)  will be continued  and delivered  concurrently  with RT. After 
the completion  of RT, weekly  cisplatin  (+ 3 days)  will be continued  until disease  progression  or until 
assessment  of treatment  response  at Week  12 post RT (+/- 2 weeks),  based  on MD discretion.  
Patients  whose  HRR status  is found  to be inevaluable  by the MSK  assay  will not be included  in the 
study  and will be replaced  by eligible  patients.  
 
At Week  12 (12+2 weeks  after RT; with strong  recommendation  at 12 weeks),  repeat  imaging  with the 
same  imaging  methods  used  for baseline  assessment  will be performed.  Treatment  response  will be

determined  by either  PRC or RECIST  1.1. 
 
We estimate  accrual  will occur  at the rate of 15 patients  per year.  It will take 3.5 years  to accrue  the 
total of 54 patients.  Patients  will be followed  up to 24 weeks  after completion  of RT to determine  all 
study  endpoints.  Clinical follow -up will continue  until death.  
 
 
4.3 Intervention  
 
4.3.1  Cisplatin  Administration  
 
Cisplatin  treatment  should  be initiated  following  study  registration.  The starting  dose  of cisplatin  is 
established  as 25 mg/m2 ivpb once  a week  (+ 3 days)  for 1-2 weeks  prior to radiation.  Dose  
modification  following  the first dose  of cisplatin  is subject  to the discretion  of the treating  physician.  
Dosing  calculation  guidelines  will follow  MSKCC  policies  described  on the website:   
http://mskweb5.mskcc.org/intranet/shared/pharmacy/guidelines/Chemo_Guidelines/Manuals/Cisplatin.html  
 
Cisplatin  may be initiated  immediately  following  simulation  but prior to first radiation  fraction.  The 
rationale  is so that the patient  may initiate  a form of treatment  while  waiting  1-2 weeks  for radiation  
treatment  planning  to be completed.  
Cisplatin  may cause  myelosuppression  or other  known  non-hematologic  toxicities.  Following  the 
completion  of RT, pending  no toxicities,  but prior to the week  12 post RT evaluable  timepoint,  patients  
will continue  to receive  cisplatin  based  on MD discretion,  or until POD.  
 
The starting  (first)  dose  of cisplatin  will be 25  mg/m2  ivpb once  a week  (+ 3 days) . Following  the first 
dose  of cisplatin,  a CBC  will be drawn  once  a week  (+ 3 days)  prior to treatment  to ensure  treatment  
parameters  are met. A comprehensive  panel  and Mg++  level will be obtained  on D15 (+3 days)  of 
every  cycle  of cisplatin;  these  values  will inform  the dose  for the following  cycle  of cisplatin.  The 
length  of one cycle  of Cisplatin  is 21 days.  If cisplatin  is withheld,  the cycle  count  for treatment  is also 
held. Based  on the laboratory  values  drawn  from the prior week’s  bloodwork , if the following  
parameters  are met, cisplatin  should  be held as directed.  
• If ANC is <1,000  mcL and/or  platelets  are <100,000  mcL,  withhold  cisplatin  therapy  for one week  
and repeat  measurements.   Physicians  have the option  of administering  growth  factor  support  
during  the time when  ANC<1,000  mcL or platelets  are <100,000  mcL.  The treating  MD may 
modify  the subsequent  cisplatin  doses  at their discretion.  If there  is a delay  of 3 consecutive  
weeks  of treatment  due to toxicity,  then the patient  must  discontinue  protocol  therapy  and be 
removed  from the study.  
• If the ANC is still <1,000  mcL or platelets  are 75,000 -99,000  mcL,  then hold weekly  cisplatin  again  
until the ANC is >1,000  mcL and platelets  are >100,000  mcL.  The treating  MD may modify  the 
subsequent  cisplatin  doses  at their discretion.  
• If serum  creatinine  is >1.5 mg/dL,  delay  treatment,  provide  intravenous  hydration  and check  12 or 
24 hour creatinine  clearance,  serum  creatinine  and electrolytes  after 24 hours.  If the serum  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center

Approval date: 11 -Nov-2020  
16  
  
 
creatinine  is <1.5 mg/dL  and creatinine  clearance  >60 cc/min,   may give full dose  of cisplatin.  If 
serum  creatinine  is 1.6-1.9 and creatinine  clearance  is between  30-60 cc/min,  cisplatin  can be 
given  at the discretion  of the treating  physician.  If serum  creatinine  is >2 OR creatinine  clearance  
is <30 cc/min,  hold cisplatin.  
 
• If the patient  develops  any non-hematologic  grade  3-4 toxicity,  cisplatin  will be held until toxicity  is 
reduced  to grade  2 or less. Dose  reduction  is permitted  at the discretion  of the treating  physician.  
If a patient  experiences  grade  2 toxicity  (with exception  of alopecia)  that lasts >2 weeks,  cisplatin  
will be held and dose  reduction  recommended  at discretion  of the treating  physician.  Cisplatin  will 
be discontinued  if greater  than grade  2 toxicity  persists  following  2 dose  reductions.  
• If the patient  develops  an intercurrent  illness  (e.g. infection)  that, in the opinion  of the treating  
medical  oncologist,  mandates  a delay  of cisplatin  therapy,  the intercurrent  illness  must  be 
resolved  within  a time frame  such that no more  than 2 weekly  doses  of cisplati  n are withheld.  If 
therapy  must  be withheld  for a longer  period  of time,  the patient  will be removed  from the study.  
• Following  the completion  of RT but prior to the week  12 post  RT evaluable  timepoint,  patients  will 
continue  receiving   cisplatin  based  on MD discretion.  The dose  and schedule  of cisplatin  after the 
completion  of RT will be at the discretion  of the treating  MD. If there  is a delay  of 3 consecutive  
weeks  of treatment,  then the patient  must discontinue  protocol therapy  and will be removed  from 
study.  Continuation  of cisplatin  and the dose  and schedule  of cisplatin  after Week  12 post RT 
assessment  will be at the discretion  of the treating  MD. 
• Note:  Disruption  to the cisplatin  treatment  schedule  for 3 weeks  due to unforeseen  circumstances,  
holidays  or the patient  being  on vacation  is permitted  and will be reviewed  on a case -by-case  
basis.  
 
 
4.3.2  Radiation  Therapy  
 
Radiation  therapy  to the target  tumor  will be delivered  with external  beam  radiation  therapy.  In 
metastatic  cases  where  the intent  is palliative,  the dose  of radiation  will be 3750  cGy delivered  in 15 
daily fractions,  4-5 days a week.  In locoregionally  recurrent  or progressive  cases  where  the intent  is 
to enhance  locoregional  control,  the dose  of radiation  will be 5000  cGy delivered  in 25 fractions,  4-5 
days a week  plus an optional  10-14 Gy boost  to areas  of gross  tumor.  In cases  where  patients  have 
had prior radiation  and there  is overlap  between  current  and prior fields,  normal  tissue  constraints  will 
be followed  as per departmental  guidelines.  
 
Radiation  therapy  will not be delivered  on holidays  for which  the Department  of Radiation  Oncology  is 
closed.  When  radiation  treatment  is missed  because  of a holiday  or unforeseen  circumstances,  the 
missed  dose  will be made  up at the end of RT.

Commercially  available  cisplatin  injection  (1 mg/ml):  Each  ml of sterile,  unpreserved  solution  contains  
1mg of cisplatin  with 9mg of sodium  chloride  and 1mg of mannitol  in water  for injection.  Hydrochloric  
acid is added  to adjust  the pH. Single -dose  glass  vials of 10 and 50 ml contain  10 and 50 mg of 
cisplatin,  respectively.  None  of the injection  components  such as IV needles,  syringes  and sets should   
have aluminum  components,  because  aluminum  is incompatible  with cisplatin.  A black          
precipitate  forms  (platinum)  when  exposed  to aluminum  and loss of potency  will occur.  Vials  of 
cisplatin  injection,  USP,  are stored  at room  temperature  between  15-25 degrees  Celsius.  Please  refer 
to the FDA-approved  package  insert  for complete  product  information.  
5.3 Tumor  Biopsy  
 
4 cores  biopsies  are required,  with 2 optional  cores,  will be obtained  from the tumor  to be irradiated,  
with image -guidance  as necessary.  The safety  and feasibility  of the biopsy  will be determined  by the 
study Interventional Radiologist. Clip placement in target lesion is recommended if CT or MR-guided 
biopsy  is performed.  Skin metastases  will be biopsied  by an MSKCC  surgeon,  dermatologist  or a 
radiation  oncologist.  The minimum  core length  is 6 mm. One out of the 4 cores  will be fixed in 10% 
neutral  buffered  formalin  and sent to Pathology  for routine  diagnostic  confirmation  of triple  negative  
breast  cancer,  prior to irradiation.  The remainder  of the cores  will be placed  in a 1 mL freezer  vial in 
DMEM  standard  medium  at room  temperature  with regular  ice on top of the specimens  and 
transported  directly  to Dr. Powell’s  laboratory  for the MSK -HRR  assay.  If there  is any remaining  tissue  
left after the MSK -HRR  assay,  DNA  will be extracted  and stored  in Dr. Powell’s  lab for possible  future  
analysis.  The estimated  turn-around   time for functional  assay,  from receipt  of tissue  to interpretation,  
is 5 business  days.  However,  the results  of the assay  (determining  HR-proficient  vs HR-deficient)  
status  are not necessary  for patients  in order  to receive  the study  treatment  and will only be shared  
with the study  statistician  and primary  investigator,  for the purposes  of confirming  which  patients  can 
remain  on study  (i.e. they must  have a definitive  HRR repair  status).  Patients  who are unable  to 
obtain  a definitive  HRR status  will be excluded  from analysis  of the primary  endpoint  of the study,  but 
will be counted  towards  the secondary  and exploratory  objectives  of the study.  
5.4 MSK -HRR  Assay  
 
The specimens  will be transported  to the Laboratory  of Molecular  Radiation  Biology  in the Zuckerman  
Research  Building,  Room  419, led by Dr. Simon  Powell  and managed  by Rob Delsite.  The time from 
tumor  harvest  to initiation  of laboratory  processing  should  ideally  not exceed  2 hours.  Tumor  
specimens  will be divided  into 2 separate  and equally  sized  parts;  one part will be irradiated  to 10 Gy 
137 
(gamma -rays from the Shepard  Mark -I Cs irradiator,  Model 68, SN643),  in the SKI Radiation  Core  
Facility  and the second  part will be sham -treated.  Following  irradiation  or sham  treatment,  the 
specimens  will be incubated  in humidified  cell culture  incubators  at 37°C with 5% CO2 for 4 hours.  
One part of each  specimen  will then be snap -frozen  in optimal cutting  temperature  (OCT)  compound  
(Sigma -Aldrich),  with a view to preparing  histological sections  in the Molecular  Cytology  Core  Facility  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -032 A(16)  
Approval date: 11 -Nov-2020  
18  
  
 
(MCCF).  Tumor  will be snap  frozen  in optimal cutting  temperature  compound  and stored  at -80°C.  
RNA was extracted  using  standard  Trizol  extraction.  The DNeasy  kit (Quiagen,  Valencia,  CA) was 
used  to isolate  genomic  DNA.  The quality  of the DNA  was verified  on a 1% agarose  gel. RNA quality  
was assessed  using  the Agilent  Bioanalyzer  2100.  
Hematoxylin  and eosin  staining  of representative  sections  will also be performed  by the MCCF.  The 
second  part will be disaggregated  by scalpel  mincing,  with or without  collagenase,  to develop  a cell 
suspension  which  can be used  in a cytospin  followed  by formaldehyde  fixation  and cytologic  analysis.  
Thin sections  or cytospin  preparations  will be stained  using  the published  immunofluorescence  
protocols. Immunofluorescence  microscopy will be carried out in the Labo ratory of Molecular 
Radiation  Biology  on a confocal  microscope.  Briefly,  cryoslides  or cytospin  slides  will be fixed and 
permeabilized,  then blocked  and probed  with anti-RAD51,  anti-BRCA1,  and anti-FANCD2  antibodies.  
Slides  will then be washed  and incubated  with fluorescently  labeled  secondary  antibodies.  Images  will 
be captured  and subnuclear  foci will then be quantified.  
Cell nuclei  will be analyzed  for subnucl ear foci formation  of phosphohistone  H2AX  (γH2AX),  BRCA1,  
and RAD51  in both the irradiated  and non-irradiated  states  using  a Zeiss  LSM 510 confocal  
microscope.  In order  to quantify  foci formation,  over 200 nuclei  will be counted  for both the irradiated  
and non-irradiated  conditions.  A nucleus  will be scored  as positive  if it contains  greater  than 5 foci. 
The formation  of γH2AX  foci is an upstream  event  in the DNA  damage  response  and indicates  the 
presence  of a double  strand  break  [66]. γH2AX  staining  will be used  as a control  for cell viability  at 
the time of fixation  and adequacy  of the staining  procedures.   In addition,  the mean  number  of 
positive  BRCA1  and RAD51  nuclei  for each  condition  will be quantified  as a function  of the percent  of 
nuclei  with γH2AX  foci following  IR in order  to normalize  for differences  in cell viability  across  various  
tumor  specimens.  
Comparative  genomic  hybridization  (CGH)  will be performed  at the Genomics  Core  Laboratory  at 
Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  by cy5 labeling  tumor  DNA  to 1M aCGH  human  microarrays  
from Agilent  (Santa  Clara,  CA) with cy3 labeled  genomic  DNA  from Roche  (Indianapolis,  IN). The 
arrays  will be scanned  with Agilent  high-resolution  microarray  scanner  (G2538C).  Data  will be 
extracted  with Agilent  feature  extraction  software  (v10.7).  Data  analysis  will be performed  using  the 
RAE algorithm  [67]. 
Any remaining  tissue  from the tumor  biopsies  will be flash frozen  in liquid  nitrogen  and stored  at - 
80°C and banked  in Dr. Powell’s  lab for future  analyses,  including  BRCA  promotor  methylation  status.  
If BRCA  status  is not known  at the time of study  registration,  patients  will either  be referred  to the 
MSKCC  Genetics  department  for evaluation  of BRCA  status,  or this information  may be obtained  
from analysis  of the fresh  tumor  biopsy  in Dr. Powell’s  laboratory.  
 
5.5 Immune  Correlates  
 
In order  to evaluate  the association  between  intratumoral  and stromal  lymphocytes  and response  to 
treatment  [65-67], the pre-treatment  tumor  biopsy  slides  (formalin  fixed paraffin  embedded,  FFPE)  will 
be reviewed  by the two study  pathologists,  using  the standardized  methodology  for evaluating  TILs 
based  on H&E sections  of core biopsies  [68]. Intratumoral   lymphocytes  are defined  as intraepithelial  
Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center 
IRB Number: 15 -032 A(16)  
Approval date: 11 -Nov-2020  
19  
  
 
mononuclear  cells within  tumor  cell nests  or in direct  contact  with tumor  cells and will be reported  as 
the percentage  of the tumor  epithelial  nests  that contain  infiltrating  lymphocytes  [65]. Stromal  
lymphocytes  are defined  as the percentage  of tumor  stroma  area that contains  a lymphocytic  infiltrate  
without  direct  contact  to tumor  cells.  In addition,  immunohistochemical  analyses  including  but not 
limited  to CD3,  CD4,  CD8,  FOXP3  and CD20  will be performed  in order  to further  characterize  TILs. 
Peripheral  blood  will be drawn  before  treatment  and at two time points  following  completion  of the 
cisplatin/RT  to evaluate  epitope  spreading  by seromic  analysis  for tumor -associated  antigens.  In 
addition,  the peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells will also be preserved  for evaluation  of T cell 
immunophenotyping. Immunophenotyping  will be determined using flow cytometry to determine the 
effect  on individual  lymphocyte  subsets  in peripheral  blood  mononuclear  cells (PBMC).  Flow 
cytometric  assessment  of the lymphocyte  subsets  CD4+, CD8+, CD16+, CD19+ and CD56+  will be 
examined  as percent  and absolute  number.  FOXP3+ and FOXP3- lymphocytes   with the following  
markers  will also include  but not limited  to: CD4+, CD25,  CD45RA,  CD45RO,  LAG3,  GARP,  PD1,  and 
CTLA4.  Activation  markers  such as CD44  and CD69  will also be examined.  The blood  samples  will  
be delivered  to the Immune  Monitoring  Core  Facility  where  the processing  and storage  will occur.  The 
IMF may also perform  ELISPOT,  flow tetramer  staining,  and/or  intracellular  polyfunctional  cytokine  
staining,  TCR Vβ Repertoire  analysis  and Spectratyping  to further  characterize  tumor -antigen  specific  
CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response  before  and after treatment.  PBMCs  will be archived  for all patients  to 
support  complete  analysis  of the profile.  Archived  serum  may also be assayed  for levels  of 
chemokines,  cytokines,  and tumor -associated  soluble  proteins  by techniques  that may include  but are 
not limited  to, ELISA  or multiplex  assays.  Analyses  may include  markers  of inflammation,  immune  
activation,  host tumor  growth  factors,  and tumor -derived  proteins.  These  assays  will also take place  in 
the Immune  Monitoring  Facility  (IMF).

7.0 RECRUITMENT  PLAN  
 
Potential  research  subjects  will be identified  by either  a breast  medical  oncologist,  breast  surgeon  or 
breast  radiation  oncologist  at MSKCC.  Eligible  patients  include  women  with breast  cancer  with 
measurable  disease  requiring  radiation  treatment.  These  include  locoregionally  progressive  or 
recurrent  disease  in the breast/chest  wall and/or  regional  lymph  nodes,  or sites of metastatic  disease  
requiring  local palliative  treatment.  The patients  will be referred  to the Department  of Radiation  
Oncology,  where  informed  consent  will be obtained.  This study  is open  to recruitment  all Regional  
sites,  however  biopsies  of the target  tumor  for the study  must  be performed  at the Main  Campus.

MSKCC  has filed forms  HHS 441, 641 and 639-A. We have taken  notice  of NIH/ADAMHA  policies  
concerning  the inclusion  of women  and minorities  in clinical  research  populations.  We expect  that the 
study  population  will be fully representative  of the range  of patients  seen  at MSKCC  without  exclusion  
to age (>18 years)  or ethnic  background.  
 
Potential  research  subjects  will be identified  by a member  of the patient’s  treatment  team,  the 
protocol  investigator,  or research  team  at Memorial  Sloan -Kettering  Cancer  Center  (MSKCC).  If the 
investigator  is a member  of the treatment  team,  s/he will screen  their patient’s  medical  records  for 
suitable  research  study  participants  and discuss  the study  and their potential  for enrolling  in the 
research  study.  Potential  subjects  contacted  by their treating  physician  will be referred  to the 
investigator/research  staff of the study.  
 
The principal investigator  may also screen  the medical  records  of patients  with whom  they do not 
have a treatment  relationship  for the limited  purpose  of identifying  patients  who would  be eligible  to 
enroll  in the study  and to record  appropriate  contact  information  in order  to approach  these  patients  
regarding  the possibility  of enrolling  in the study.  
 
During  the initial conversation  between  the investigator/research  staff and the patient,  the patient  may 
be asked  to provide  certain  health  information  that is necessary  to the recruitment  and enrollment  
process.  The investigator/research  staff may also review  portions  of their medical  records  at MSKCC  
in order  to further  assess  eligibility.  They  will use the information  provided  by the patient  and/or  
medical  record  to confirm  that the patient  is eligible  and to contact  the patient  regarding  study  
enrollment.  If the patient  turns out to be ineligible  for the research  study,  the research  staff will  
destroy  all information  collected  on the patient  during  the initial conversation  and medical  records  
review,  except  for any information  that must  be maintained  for screening  log purposes.  
 
In most  cases,  the initial contact  with the prospective  subject  will be conducted  either  by the treatment  
team,  investigator  or the research  staff working  in consultation  with the treatment  team.  The 
recruitment  process  outlined  presents  no more  than minimal  risk to the privacy  of the patients  who  
are screened  and minimal  PHI will be maintained  as part of a screening  log. For these  reasons,  we 
seek  a (partial)  limited  waiver  of authorization  for the purposes  of (1) reviewing  medical  records  to 
identify  potential  research  subjects  and obtain  information  relevant  to the enrollment  process;  (2) 
conversing  with patients  regarding  possible  enrollment ; (3) handling  of PHI contained  within  those  
records  and provided  by the potential  subjects;  and (4) maintaining  information  in a screening  log of 
patients  approached  (if applicable).

9.0 TREATMENT/  INTERVENTION  PLAN  
 
During  radiation  therapy,  patients  will undergo  a physical  exam  and evaluation  by a radiation  
oncologist  once  a week  for toxicities  in a status  check  visit as per current  standard  practice.  
While  receiving  cisplatin,  patients  will be followed  by a medical  oncologist,  who will obtain  complete  
blood  count  once  a week  and serum  chemistries  with Mg2+ on D15 (+3 days)  of every  cycle  of 
cisplatin  therapy.  The medical  oncologist  will evaluate  the patient  on D1 of every  cycle  of cisplatin  
therapy.  The length  of one cycle  of Cisplatin  is 21 days.  
Following  the completion  of RT, pending  no toxicities,  but prior to the week  12 post RT evaluable  
timepoint,  patients  will continue  to receive  cisplatin  or until POD,  based  on MD discretion.  
 
At Week  12 (12+2 weeks  after completion  of radiation  therapy),  patients  will be seen  either  by a 
radiation  oncologist  or a medical  oncologist,  and then every  6 months  for routine  follow -up visits   
either  by a radiation  oncologist  or medical  oncologist,  until removal  from study  or death.  Peripheral  
bloods  and blood  banking  research  samples  (ctDNA)  be collected  at baseline,  at the end of RT and at 
the 12 +2 week  assessment  point.  Follow -up imaging  studies  (PET -CT +/- MRI) will be obtained  at 
12+2 weeks  after RT. PET/CT  +/- MRI of the target  lesion  q6 months  afterwards  will be  
recommended  but not required.

6Radiation  will begin  following   1-2 weeks  of cisplatin.  Weekly  cisplatin  (+ 3 days)  will be continued  and delivered  
concurrently  with RT. 
7 The length  of one Cisplatin  cycle  is 21 days.  Cisplatin  is administered  on D1, D8 and D15 (+3 days)  of every  
cycle.  Following  the completion  of RT, pending   no toxicities,  but prior to the week  12 post RT evaluable   timepoint,  
patients  will continue  to receive  cisplatin  or until POD,  based  on MD discretion.  
8 The medical  oncologist  will evaluate   the patient  on D1 of each  cisplatin  cycle.  The patient  will be assessed  for 
toxicities  and will be recorded  on a ClinDoc  Toxicity  form,  complete  with grade,   attribution,  start,  and stop dates.  
9 Bloodwork   will be obtained  during  the last week  of RT for immune  correlates   and ctDNA.  
10The radiation  oncologist  will evaluate   the patient  weekly  during  RT at status  checks.  The patient  will be 
assessed  for toxicities  and will be recorded  on a standard  radiation  oncology   toxicity  form,  complete  with grade,  
attribution,  start,  and stop dates.  
11Evaluations  by both Radiation  and Medical  oncologists  will include:  medical  history  (baseline  only),  physical  
exam,  ECOG/KPS,  review  of prior and concurrent  medications  and vital signs  (blood  pressure,  height,  weight,  
temperature,   respiratory   rate and heart  rate).  
12If not completed  prior to registration  
13 Required   weekly  during  radiation  therapy  in either  the clinic  of medical  oncology  or radiation  oncology   and then 
on D1 of each  cycle  after the completion  of radiation  therapy.  
 
11.1 TOXICITIES/SIDE  EFFECTS  
A severe  toxicity  will be defined  as any grade  3 toxicity,  attributed  to radiation  or chemotherapy,  which  
can be observed  within  2 months  of completion  of protocol  radiation.   Toxicities  will be assessed  
using  the CTEP  Version  4.0 of the NCI Common  Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE  
version  4.0) at the website:  
http://ctep.cancer.go  v/p rotocolDe  velop  ment/e  lectro  nic_applications  /ctc .htm. Patients  will be assessed  
for toxicities  until progression  or death.  Only adverse  events  that are possibly,  probably  or definitely  
related  to protocol  therapy  will be documented  on the CTCAE  toxicities  form and will be collected  for 
data entry.  Only hematologic  toxicities  that are considered  Grade  >2, per CTCAE  version  4.0 will be 
captured  for this trial. 
11.2 Toxicities  of Cisplatin  
Nephrotoxicity  
A major  toxicity  of cisplatin  is cumulative  nephrotoxicity.  Tubular  necrosis  of both proximal  and distal  
renal  tubules  has been  noted  in 28-36% of subjects  treated  with a single  dose  of 50 mg/m2. It is first 
noted  14 days after a dose  and is manifested  by elevations  in BUN  and creatinine,  serum  uric acid 
and/or  a decrease  in creatinine  clearance.  Renal  toxicity  becomes  more  prolonged  and severe  with 
repeated  courses  of the drug.  Renal  function  must  return  to normal  before  another  dose  of cisplatin  
can be given.  Nephrotoxicity  can be reduced  by IV hydration  and mannitol  diuresis.  
Nausea  and Vomiting  
Cisplatin  causes  moderate  to severe  nausea  and vomiting  in almost  all subjects  treated.  Nausea  and 
vomiting  usually  begin  within  1 to 4 hours  after treatment  and lasts up to 24 hours.  Various  degrees  of 
vomiting,  nausea  and/or  anorexia  may persist  up to 1 week  after the treatment.  Delayed  nausea  and 
vomiting  (beginning  24 hours  or more  after chemotherapy)  has occurred  with complete  emetic  control  
on the day of cisplatin  therapy.  The use of prophylactic  and continuing  antiemetic  medication  reduces  
these  adverse  effects.  Subjects  should  receive  prophylactic  anti-nausea  medications  according  to 
ASCO  guidelines  for highly  emetogenic  chemotherapy  regimens.

Hypomagnesemia  
Hypomagnesemia  has been  reported  in subjects  treated  with cisplatin  and is probably  related  to renal  
tubular  damage.  It may become  sever  enough  to cause  tetany.  Generally,  serum  electrolytes  return  to 
normal  levels  when  cisplatin  is discontinued  and supplemental  electrolytes  are administered.  
Ototoxicity  
Ototoxicity  has been  observed  in up to 31% of subjects  treated  with a single  dose  of cisplatin  (50 
mg/m2)  and is manifested  by tinnitus  and/or  hearing  loss in the high frequency  range  (4000  -8000  Hz). 
Decreased  ability  to hear normal  conversational  tones  may occur  occasionally.  Ototoxicity  can be 
more  severe  in children  than in adults  and more  frequent  and severe  with repeated  administration.  
Hearing  loss can be unilateral  or bilateral  and is usually  not reversible.  
 
Myelosuppression  
Myelosuppression  occurs  in 25-30% of subjects  treated  with cisplatin.  The nadirs  in circulating  
platelets  and leukocytes  occur  between  days 18 and 23, with most  subjects  recovering  by day 39. 
Leukopenia  and thrombocytopenia  are more  pronounced  at higher  doses  (>50 mg/m2) than will be 
administered  in this study.  Anemia  (a decrease  in hemoglobin  of 2gm.100  ml) occurs  at 
approximately  the same  frequency  and with the same  timing  as leukopenia  and thrombocytopenia.  
Neurotoxicity  
Cisplatin  neurotoxicity  is characterized  by peripheral  neuropathies,  which  are sensory  in nature  but 
can also include  motor  difficulties  such as reduced  deep -tendon  reflexes  and leg weakness.  The 
symptoms  usually  occur  after prolonged  therapy  (4-7 months).  Cisplatin  therapy  should  be 
discontinued  when  serious  neuropathy  develops  (defined  in Section  4.2.1).  The neuropathy,  however,  
may progress  further  even  after discontinuation  of treatment.  
 
11.3 Dose  Delays  and Modifications  for Cisplatin  
 
See section  4.2.1  for guidelines  for dose  modification  of cisplatin  during  RT or after RT. 
 
Following  the completion  of RT, pending  no toxicities,  but prior to the week  12 post RT evaluable  
timepoint,  patients  will continue  to receive  cisplatin  or until POD,  based  on MD discretion.  
11.4 Toxicities  of Radiation  
 
Toxicities  may occur  from radiation  treatment.  The type and risk of toxicity  will depend  on the 
presence  of normal  tissue  structures  in close  proximity  to the target.  These  normal  tissue  doses  will 
be constrained  by the treatment  plan to deliver  doses  no more  than those  recommended  in our 
departmental  guidelines:  
(http://teamshare/dep  t/medp  hys/eb  tp/P ublic%20Docume  nts/Forms  /Pub lic%20View.asp  x) 
 
The estimated  risk of each  type of toxicity  is noted  below,  and include:  
 
1. Skin (erythema,  dry or moist  desquamation,  patchy  ulceration)  - 40-50% 
2. Non-debilitating  fatigue - 50%

3. Brachial plexopathy - 5-7% 
4. Bowel (bowel  perforation,  obstruction  or hemorrhage)  - 2-5% 
5. Peripheral  nerve  (neuropathy  or severe  neuropathic  pain unresponsive  to medications) -2-5% 
6. Bladder  (hemorrhagic  cystitis,  chronic  cystitis  manifesting  in frequency  and urgency)  - 2-5% 
7. Rectum  (injury  including  ulceration  or perforation) -2-5% 
8. Osteonecrosis  or bone  fracture - 5-10% 
 
12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THERAPEUTIC  RESPONSE/OUTCOME  ASSESSMENT  
 
Response  to radiation  and chemotherapy  treatments  will be using  the Reviewed  Response   
Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  guidelines  version  1.1 . However  there  are limitations  in 
using  anatomic  response  criteria  alone,  particularly  when  evaluating  bone  metastases  without  an 
extra -osseous  component,  which  is common  in breast  cancer  patients.  “PERCIST”  (PET  Response  
Criteria  in Solid  Tumors),  is a commonly  proposed  method  for measuring  treatment  response  based  
on metabolic  response  criteria  with PET [68].  A limitation  of PERCIST  is that it only takes  into 
account  the single  hottest  lesion  and it relies  upon  SUV peak  measurements,  which  are not easily  
reproducible  in lesions  with low FDG-avidity,  as are often  found  in breast  cancer.  Since  there  are no 
standardized  methods  for quantifying  FDG -tracer  avidity  in individual  tumor  lesions,  we will use a 
modification  of PERCIST  criteria  called “PET  Response  Criteria”  (PRC ) that is currently  being  utilized  
in other  cancer  protocols  at MSK  requiring  metabolic  assessment.  In brief,  the SUVmax  of the tumor  
to be irradiated  will be measured  and recorded.  On subsequent  studies,  the same  target  lesion  will 
be measured  and recorded.  Lesions  where  SUVmax  is no greater  than background  will be recorded  
as zero.  
Response  or progression  will be graded  as follows:  
 
CR: All lesions  no greater  than  background  SUVmax  
 
PR: SUVmax  decreased  by >30% greater  than  background  
 
SD: Lesions  that do not fit criteria  for response  or progression  
 
PD: SUM  SUVmax  increased  by >30% or development  of a new lesion  within  the radiated  
field 
 
Radiological  review  will be conducted  by the study  radiologists.  PET-CT will be obtained  in all 
patients  at baseline.  In general,  PRC will be preferred  over RECIS  T 1.1 for response  assessment , 
except  in cases  where  the tumor  target  is not clearly  defined  on PET-CT (e.g.  lesions  obscured  by 
areas  of physiologic  FDG-avidity).  In such cases,  the study  radiologists  will decide  when  baseline  
images  are available  whether  or not to use PRC or RECIST  1.1. If PET-CT evaluation  is determined  
to be insufficient  for tumor  evaluation,  MR will be recommended.  The same  imaging study  (PET -CT 
or MR) or response  criteria  (PRC  or RECIST  1.1) used  at baseline  assessment  will be utilized  for the 
follow -up assessments  of the irradiated  tumor.  
We anticipate  that the most  common  discrepancy  between  PRC and RECIST  1.1 will be when  there  
is a CR on PRC,  but PR on RECIST  1.1. In these  cases,  PRC will be utilized  for response

assessment.  If PRC will be used,  RECIST  1.1 is not required  for the primary  endpoint.  However,  for 
the secondary  endpoints  of comparing  PRC to RECIST  1.1, RECIST  1.1 measurements  will be done  
on the CT portion  of the PET/CT.  
 
13.0 CRITERIA  FOR REMOVAL  FROM  STUDY  
Participants  will be removed  from the protocol  for any of the following  reasons:  
• Development  of disease  progression  that warrants  a change  in the radiation  or chemotherapy  
treatment  plan or an alternative  therapy.  
• Any grade  4 non-hematologic  toxicity,  except  in cases  where  the treating  physician  believes  
the patient  is deriving  benefit  from remaining  on the study.  
• Chemotherapy  treatment  delay  of  3 consecutive  weeks  for any reason  
Note: Disruption to the cisplatin treatment schedu le for 3 weeks due to unforeseen 
circumstances, holidays or the patient being on vacation is permitted and will be reviewed on a 
case -by-case  basis.  
• For safety  reasons,  the investigator  considers  it to be in the best interest  of the participant  that 
they be withdrawn  
• The patient  wishes  to withdraw  from the study  
• HRR status  is unable  to be obtained  from the core biopsy  taken  at the beginning  of the study.  
 
 
14.0 BIOSTATISTICS  
 
The proposed  study  is a prospective  Phase  II trial testing  the efficacy  of concurrent  cisplatin  and 
radiation  in TNBC  patients  with measurable  metastatic  or locally  recurrent  tumor,  based  on HRR 
status.   All patients  (regardless  of HRR status)  who meet the eligibility  criteria  and agree  to be part of 
the trial will be enrolled.  That is, knowledge  of HRR status  is not necessary  at the start of the study,  
as all patients  will receive  the study  therapy  of concurrent  cisplatin  and radiation.  The primary  
objective  of this trial is to evaluate  whether  patients  with HRR -deficiency  have higher  complete  
response  (CR) rates  than patients  who are HRR -proficient.  For the primary  endpoint,  response  will be 
measured  at 12+/- 2 weeks  after the completion  of RT. 
Preliminary  data from our institution  has demonstrated  the incidence  of HRR deficiency  in non- 
metastatic  TNBC  patients  to be 48% [13]. However,  because  these  studies  were  performed  in non- 
metastatic  breast  cancer  patients  and cannot  be fully extrapolated  to metastatic  patients,  we 
conservatively  estimated  that the incidence  of HRR deficiency  in our proposed  study  population  of 
patients  with locally  recurrent  or metastatic  TNBC  to be 40%.  Based  on preliminary  data from 
Washington  University  in which  HRR -deficient  patients  had a greater  than 4-fold pathologic  CR rate 
compared  to HRR -proficient  patients  [39], we conservatively  assumed  that HRR -deficient  patients  
would  achieve  approximately  2.5x higher  CR rate than HRR -proficient  patients.   We estimated  that 
the CR rate of in HRR -proficient  patients  following  concurrent  cisplatin  and RT to be 30%, and that 
the CR rate in HRR -deficient  patients  would  be increased  to 65%.  This corresponds  to an absolute  
difference  in CR rates  of 35%.  These  estimates  were  based  on response  rates  after platinum

chemotherapy  observed  in metastatic  TNBC  patients  in the TBCRC009  study  [39] and adjusted  for 
the additional cytotoxic  effect  of radiation  therapy  on the target  tumor.  The below  table  provides  
power  calculations  for varying  proportions  of HRR deficiency  (30%  to 40%), assuming  a one-sided  
type I error of 5% and for a sample  size of 54.

However,  we will plan to accrue  a total of 62 patients  in order  to allow  for early  dropout  due to disease  
progression/death  prior to response  evaluation,  or inability  to obtain  HRR status  from the core 
biopsy.  For the primary  analysis,  all patients  for whom  HRR  status  can be ascertained  will be  
included  in the denominator.  Patients  who progress  or die prior to the response  evaluation  at 12 +/- 2 
weeks  post-RT will be included  as failures.   This includes  patients  with disease  progression  outside  of 
the irradiated  tumor.   Patients  for whom  HRR status  cannot  be ascertained  or who left the study  for 
nondisease  related  reasons  will be replaced.  
 
A secondary  analysis  of interest  is to evaluate  the CR rate among  the subset  of patients  who are able 
to complete  the planned  study  treatment  and have a scan  at the 12 +/- 2 week  post-RT time point.  
Radiographic  complete  response  (CR) of the irradiated  tumor  will be counted  as a positive  response  
to treatment.  Radiographic  response  less than a CR, progression  of the irradiated  tumor  or 
appearance  of a new lesion  within  the radiated  field will be categorized  as a failure  to respond  to 
treatment.  All other  sites of metastatic  disease  that is outside  of the irradiated  field wi l be monitored  
and counted toward disease progression. 
Based  on prior experience  with the HRR assay,  we estimate  that approximately  10% of patients  will 
either  1) not have a definitive  HRR status,  or 2) will not complete  the planned  study  treatment  or 3) 
not have a response  assessment  at 12-14 week  time point.   To ensure  we have 80% power  for both 
the primary  and secondary  analyses  we have added  8 patients  to the sample  size for a total of 
62.The  accrual  number  has been  adjusted  to 54 patients.  
We expect  to accrue  1 to 2 patients  per month,  or approximately  18 patients  per year.  Thus,  accrual  
for the trial will be completed  in 3.5 years.  Based  on previous  data on the tolerability  of cisplatin  and 
radiation  extrapolated  from head  and neck and gynecologic  malignancies,  we do not anticipate  
toxicities  associated  with the study  treatment  and as such,  we have not incorporated  an early  
stopping  rule. 
Secondary  endpoints  include  overall  response  rates  (CR+PR+stable  disease),  time to progression  
and CTCAE  v4.0 toxicities.  These  endpoints  will be compared  by HRR status  using  the log-rank test 
for time-to-event  endpoints  and Fisher’s  exact  test for binary  endpoints.

Exploratory  objectives  are to evaluate  the association  of tumor -infiltrating   lymphocytes  (TIL),  other  
immune  correlates  within  the tumor  biopsy  specimen  and circulating  tumor  DNA  as stated  in section  
3.6 and 5.4 as a predictor  of treatment  response.   This will be done  using  a Wilcoxon  rank-sum test. 
In a second  exploratory  objective,  in patients  who have both RECIST  1.1 and PRC assessments,  
agreement  will be calculated  and if there  is a sufficient  sample  size, a McNemar’s  test will be done.  
 
15.1 RESEARCH  PARTICIPANT  REGISTRATION AND RANDOMIZATION  PROCEDURES  
 
15.2 Research  Participant  Registration  
 
 
Confirm  eligibility   as defined  in the section  entitled   Inclusion/Exclusion   Criteria.  Obtain  informed  consent,  
by following   procedures   defined   in section  entitled   Informed   Consent  Procedures.  During  the registration  
process  registering   individuals   will be required  to complete  a protocol  specific  Eligibility   Checklist.  The 
individual   signing  the Eligibility   Checklist  is confirming  whether  or not the participant   is eligible   to enroll  in 
the study.  Study  staff are responsible   for ensuring  that all institutional   requirements   necessary  to enroll  a 
participant   to the study  have been  completed.  See related   Clinical  Research  Policy  and Procedure  #401  
(Protocol   Participant   Registration)  
15.3 Randomization  
 
There  is no randomization.  
 
16.1 DATA  MANAGEMENT  ISSUES  
 
A Clinical Research  Coordinator  (CRC)  from the Department  of Radiation  Oncology  (Breast  Service)  
will be assigned  to the study.  The responsibilities  of the CRC  include  project  compliance,  data 
collection,  abstraction  and entry,  data reporting,  regulatory  monitoring,  problem  resolution  and 
prioritization,  and coordinating  the activities  of the protocol  study  team.  
The data collected  for this study  will be entered  into a secure  database  (Clinical  Research  Database  – 
CRDB).  Source  documentation  will be available  to support  the computerized  patient  record.  
16.2 Quality  Assurance  
 
Regular  registration  reports  will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals  and completeness  of 
registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to assess  missing  data and 
inconsistencies.  Accrual  rates  and extent  and accuracy  of evaluations  and follow -up will be monitored  
periodically  throughout  the study  period  and potential  proble ms will be brought  to the attention  of the 
study  team  for discussion  and action.  Random -sample  data quality  and protocol  compliance  audits  
may be conducted  by the study  team,  at a minimum  of once  per year,  more  frequently  if indicated  . 
 
16.3 Data  and Safety  Monitoring  
 
The Data  and Safety  Monitoring  (DSM)  Plans  at MSKCC  were  approved  by the NCI in September 
2001.  The plans  address  the new policies  set forth by the NCI in the document  entitled  “Policy  of the

http://cancertrials.nci.ni  h.gov/researchers/dsm/index.html.   The DSM  Plans  at MSKCC  were  
established  and are monitored  by the Office  of Clinical Research.  The MSKCC  DSM  Plans  can be 
found  on the MSKCC  Intranet  
athttps://one.mskcc.o  rg/sites/p  ub/c linresearc  h/Doc  ume nts /MSKCC%20Data%20and%20Safety%20M   
onitoring%20Plans.pdf   . There  are several  different  mecha nisms  by which  clinical  trials are  
monitored  for data,  safety,  and quality.  There  are institutional  processes  in place  for quality  assurance  
(e.g. protocol  monitoring,  compliance  and data verification  audits,  therapeutic  response,  and staff 
education  on clinical  research  QA) and departmental  procedures  for quality  control,  plus there  are two 
institutional  committees  that are responsible  for monitoring  the activities  of our clinical  trials programs.  
The committees:  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  for Phase  I and II clinical  trials,  and 
the Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  for Phase  III   I clinical  trials,  report  to the Center’s  
Research  Council  and Institutional  Review  Board.  During  the protocol  development  and review  
process,  each  protocol  will be assessed  for its level of risk and degree  of monitoring  required.  Every  
type of protocol  (e.g.,  NIH sponsored,  in-house  sponsored,  industrial  sponsored,  NCI cooperative  
group,  etc.) will be addressed  and the monitoring  procedures  will be established  at the time of 
protocol  activation .

17.3 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
 
An adverse  event  is considered  serious  if it results  in ANY of the following  outcomes:  
• Death  
• A life-threatening  adverse  event  
• An adverse  event  that results  in inpatient  hospitalization  or prolongation  of existing  hospitalization  
• A persistent  or significant  incapacity  or substantial  disruption  of the ability  to conduct  normal  life 
functions  
• A congenital  anomaly/birth  defect  
• Important  Medical  Events  (IME)  that may not result  in death,  be life threatening,  or require  
hospitalization  may be considered  serious  when,  based  upon  medical  judgment,  they may jeopardize  
the patient  or participant  and may require  medical  or surgical  intervention  to prevent  one of the 
outcomes  listed  in this definition  
Note:  Hospital  admission  for a planned  procedure/disease  treatment  is not considered  an SAE.  
 
SAE reporting  is required  as soon  as the participant  starts  investigational  treatment/intervention.  SAE reporting  
is required  for 30-days after the participant’s  last investigational  treatment/intervention.  Any event  that occur  
after the 30-day period  that is unexpected  and at least possibly  related  to protocol  treatment  must  be reported.  
Please  note:  Any SAE that occurs prior to the start of investigational  treatment/intervention  and is related  to a 
screening  test or procedure  (i.e., a screening  biopsy)  must  be reported.  
 
Please  note:  Any SAE that occurs prior to the start of investigational  treatment/intervention  and is related  to a 
screening  test or procedure  (i.e., a screening  biopsy)  must  be reported.  
 
 
 
All SAEs  must  be submitted  in PIMS.  If an SAE requires  submission  to the HRPP  office  per IRB SOP  RR-408 
‘Reporting  of Serious  Adverse  Events’,  the SAE report  must  be submitted  within  5 calendar  days of the event.  
All other  SAEs  must  be submitted  within  30 calendar  days of the event.  
 
 
The report  should  contain  the following  information:

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 4 of 114 • To determine  the pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics of ibrutinib  
in patient s with CLL/SLL 
• To investigate predictive biomarkers and mechanism of resistance  
Study Design:  This is a randomized, multicenter, open-label, Phase 3 study designed to 
compare the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib versus ofatumumab in 
patient s with relapsed/refractory CLL or SLL with active disease 
requiring treatment (as defined by IWCLL 2008 criteria  for initiation of 
therapy) who have failed at least 1 prior line of therapy and are not 
appropriate candidates for treatment  or retreatment  with purine analog 
based therapy . 
Eligible patient s will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio into 2 arms  to receiv e 
either IV ofatumumab (Treatment Arm A) per package insert or ibrutinib  
(Treatment Arm B)  420 mg daily until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, or criteria specified in Section 10.1, whichever occurs first .  
Two randomization schemes will be generated: one for each geographic 
region (North America versus Rest of World).  Under each scheme, 
patients will be randomized based on the following two stratification 
factors:  disease refractory  to purine analog and anti -CD20 containing 
chemoimmunotherapy regimen, and the del etion  17p13.1 (17p  del).  The 
stratified analysis will be performed based on  these two randomization 
stratification factors . 
Assessment for tumor response and progression will be conducted in 
accordance with the IWCLL 2008 criteria for patient s with CLL and SLL 
until progressive disease with the modification that isolated treatment-related lymphocytosis will not  be considered as disease progression  as 
recommended by the IWCLL 2008 guideline clarification ( Hallek 2012 ) 
and the  National Comprehensive Cancer Network ( NCCN), 2012 
guidelines and  further defined in Section 6.2.5 . 
Access to next -line ibrutinib for patients treated with ofatumumab may be 
provided with Medical Monitor approval as outlined in Section 7.3.4 . 
Patient s will be followed for survival and use of anticancer agents until 
study closure.    
The study will end approximately 5 years after the last patien t is enrolled, 
at which time a  long-term  extension study will be made available for 
patient s who choose to continue ibrutinib on a clinical protocol  when 
access to commercial ibrutinib is not feasible.
 
An independent data monitoring committee (DMC) will monitor the 
safety of the study.  
Population:  Patients with CLL or SLL who have failed at least 1 prior line of therapy 
and are not considered appropriate for treatment or retreatment  with 
purine analog based therapy .

Treatment Arm B: Ibrutinib  
Ibrutinib  420 mg (3 x 140- mg capsules) will be administered orally once 
daily  until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or criteria specified 
in Section 10.1 . 
Concomitant Therapy : Refer to Section 6.6 for information on concomitant therapy.  
Safety Plan:  
Refer to Section 9.1 and 
DMC charter for details.  The safety of this study will be monitored by an independent DMC  in 
accordance with the Sponsor ’s Pharmacovigilance Committee procedures.  
Statistical Methods and Data Analysis:  All efficacy analyse s will be performed using the intent -to-treat (ITT) 
population.   All the stratified analyses will be based on the 
two randomization stratification factors: 1) refractory disease 
(presence versus absence) to purine analog  and anti -CD20 containing 
chemoimmunotherapy regimen, and 2) status of 17p del (presence versus 
absence).  
Primary Efficacy Analysis:  
PFS as determined by the IRC will be s ummarized for each treatment arm 
using Kaplan -Meier estimates and compared using stratified log rank test. 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis:  
Overall response rate (ORR) as determined by the IRC will be compared using the Cochran-Mantel-Haen szel chi -square test, stratified by the two 
stratification factors (refractory disease and 17p del).  Overall survival will be compared using stratified log rank test.  Survival rate at landmark 
points will be summarized based on Kaplan -Meier point estimates and 
compared using the standard normal Z  test.

assessment will be summarized for the PROs assessed by the FACiT-Fatigue.  Time to hematological improvement will be compared using unstratified log rank test.  Percentage of patients achieving hematological improvement will be compared using the chi -square test.  
Exploratory Efficacy Analysis:  
PFS and ORR as determined by the Investigator will be summarized and analyzed similarly to PFS and ORR as determined by the IRC.   
Percentage of patients achieving improvement /or resolution  in 
disease-related symptoms will be compared using chi-square test.  
Descriptive statistics for change in scores from baseline to each assessment will be summarized for the PROs assessed by 
EORTC  QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L. 
Descriptive statistics will be provided for parameters collected for medical resource utilization associated with the therapy.  
Safety Analysis:  
Detailed tabulations of safety data (adverse events [AEs ] and clinical 
laboratory tests) will be provided for all patient s receiving the study drug.  
The number and percent of patient s with treatment -emergent AEs will be 
summarized.  Summary of other safety parameters by treatment group will be provided where appropriate.  
Interim Analysis One interim analysis using the Lan-DeMets alpha spending function 
based on O'Brien -Fleming  boundary  for both superiority and futility 
(non-binding) will be conducted after observing approximately 117 PFS 
events.  Futility will be evaluated by a one -sided test. The DMC will 
review and evaluate efficacy and safety results.  
Sample  Size Determination  With the agreement from the European (Rapporteur and Co-Rapporteurs) 
and US Health Authorities, the overall two -sided significance level for 
this study is revised from 0.01  to 0.05. Given this revision in overall 
significance level, 176  PFS events provides approximately 90% power to 
detect the target hazard ratio of 0.6 based on a log -rank test and a two -
sided overall significance level of 0.05 adjusted for one planned interim analysis.

Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)/ Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (SLL) are a malignancy 
of B-cells that predominantly affects the older population.  Chemoimmunotherapy, in particular 
the combination of purine analogs (eg, fludarabine) with cyclophosphamide and rituximab, has 
become a standard for the treatment of young and/or fit individuals with CLL who require 
treatment.  However, elderly patients and those with comorbidities are often unable t o tolerate 
combination chemoimmunotherapy regimens, or experience inferior clinical outcomes when treated with these regimens.  In addition, those patients who have a deletion in the short arm of 
chromosome 17p13.1 (17p del) and/ or those who fail to achieve a response or experience short 
remissions to purine analog based therapies have inferior outcomes and may prove to be 
refractory to therapy and/or experience short remission durations and rapid progression of 
disease when treated with standard and curren tly available treatment regimens.  
The generation and maintenance of normal and malignant B- cells is controlled by biochemical 
signals transmitted by the B- cell receptor (BCR).  Bruton’s Tyrosine Kinase (BTK) is an enzyme 
required for BCR signaling.  Selective BTK inhibition is a novel approach to target diseases driven by BCR activation, such as B-cell lymphoma and leukemia. 
Ibrutinib (I
MBRUVICA®) is a first- in-class, potent, orally administered, covalently binding 
inhibitor of BTK co -developed by Pharmacyclics LLC and Janssen Research & Development 
LLC for the treatment of B -cell malignancies.   
Ibrutinib has been approved in many regions, including the US and EU, for indications covering 
up to the following: treatment of patients with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) who have received 
at least 1  prior therapy, patients with CLL/SLL, including CLL /SLL with a deletion of the short 
arm of chromosome 17 (del17p), and patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia.  Ibrutinib 
is currently under investigation in various indications as a single agent and in combinations. 
For the most comprehensive nonclinical and clinical information regarding ibrutinib background, 
safety, efficacy, and in vitro and in vivo preclinical activity and toxicology of ibrutinib, refer to 
the latest version of the ibrutinib  Investigator's Brochure  (IB). 
1.1. Ibrutinib  
“Ibrutinib” and "PCI- 32765” refer to the same molecule; hereafter, “ibrutinib” will be used.  
Ibrutinib is 1-[(3R) -3-[4-amino -3-(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazolo [3, 4 d] pyrimidin -1-yl]-1-
piperidinyl]-2-propen-1-one and has a molecular weight of 440.50 g/mole (anhydrous basis).  Ibrutinib  is a white to off -white crystalline solid.  It has a single chiral center and is the 
R-enantiomer.  The investigational drug product, ibrutinib , is an oral formulation containing 
micronized ibrutinib . 
Product: IBRUTINIB (PCI -32765)  Protocol PCYC -1112- CA 28 September 2016  
IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 21 of 114 1.1.1. Mechanism of Action of Ibrutinib  
Ibrutinib binds covalently to a cysteine residue (Cys-481) near the BTK active site and inhibi ts 
the enzymatic activity of purified BTK with a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) of 
0.5 nM ( Honigberg 2010; Pan 2007).  Covalent binding to Cys- 481 results in irreversible 
inhibition of BTK.  Other kinases that are potentially inhibited by ibrutinib have been identified 
using an Ambit kinome screen.  The inhibitory effect of ibrutinib  against the activity of these 
kinases has been characterized in biochemical assays.  Only a small subset of kinases is predicted to contain a modifiable cysteine residue homologous to Cys-481 in BTK, and thus have the 
potential to be irreversibly modified  by ibrutinib .  The other Cys-481 containing kinases include 
EGFR (IC
50 = 12 nM), HER2 (IC 50 = 22 nM), HER4 (IC 50 = 0.6 nM), ITK (IC 50 = 12 nM), 
BMX (IC 50 = 1 nM), JAK3 (IC 50 = 22 nM), and BLK (IC 50 = 1 nM). 
A fluorescently -tagged derivative of ibrutinib  was shown to bind predominantly to BTK in 
B-cell lysates suggesting a high degree of specificity within B- cells ( Honigberg 2010).  
Ibrutinib also has reversible inhibitory activity against other kinases that do not contain Cys -481 
(Honigberg 2010).  However, assuming a rapid off- rate, any reversible kinase inhibition in vivo  
is likely to be short -lived, since, in humans, the effective half -life of ibrutinib following oral 
dosing is only 1.5 to 3.3 hours (as measured from time of  maximum drug concentration [T max] 
to 6 hours postdose). 
Thus, by combining fast irreversible binding to BTK  with rapid in vivo  elimination, ibrutinib  
provides a unique approach to improve selectivity for BTK in vivo  relative to reversibly inhibited 
off-target kinases.  
1.1.2. Cellular Selectivity of Ibrutinib  
BTK expression is limited to cells of hematopoietic origin.  The cellular selectivity of ibrutinib  
was demonstrated by the observation that ibrutinib inhibits antigen -receptor signaling in B- cells, 
but not in T- cells.  In ex vivo  stimulation assays, ibrutinib  inhibits human BCR activation 
(IC 50 <10 nM) in B- cells, but does not affect T- cell receptor activation ( Honigberg 2010).  
It has also been confirmed that ibrutinib  inhibits key phosphorylation events downstream of the 
BCR at similar concentrations.  Ibrutinib  has been studied in other cell types where the function 
of BTK is understood, including mast cells, basophils, monocytes, macrophages, and platelets.  
Consiste nt with the functional role of BTK in mast cells and basophils, Pharmacyclics 
determined that ibrutinib  fully inhibits degranulation following stimulation at the high -affinity 
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor ( MacGlashan 201 1; Chang 2011a ).  In monocytes and 
macrophages, ibrutinib  inhibits the secretion of pro- inflammatory cytokines following 
stimulation at the Fc-gamma receptors ( FcγR) by immune complex ( Chang 2011a ).  Consistent 
with the proposed function of BTK in platelets, unpublished data from Pharmacyclics also shows 
that ibrutinib inhibits shear -force and collagen -induced platelet aggregation in vitro  
(IC50 = 10-100nM).

For more detailed and comprehensive information of ibrutinib , please refer to the Investigator's 
Brochure ( IB). 
1.2.1. Nonclinical Pharmacology Studies  
Ibrutinib  was designed as a selective and covalent  inhibitor of the BTK protein ( Pan 2007).  
In vitro , ibrutinib  is a potent inhibitor of BTK activity (IC 50 = 0.39 nM).  The irreversible 
binding of ibrutinib  to Cys-481 in the active site of BTK results in sustained inhibition of BTK 
catalytic activity and enhanced selectivity over other kinases that do not contain a c ysteine at this 
position.  When added directly to human whole blood, ibrutinib  inhibits signal transduction from 
the BCR and blocks activation of B- cells (IC 50 = 80 nM) as assayed by anti -IgM s timulation 
followed by CD69 expression ( Herman  2011). 
Ibrutinib  arrested cell growth and induced apoptosis in human B- cell lymphoma cell lines 
in vitro  and inhibited tumor growth in vivo  in xenograft models ( Herman  2011).   Ibrutinib also 
inhibited adhesion and migration of MCL cells in co-culture and reduced tumor burden in lymph 
node and bone marrow in a murine model of MCL dissemination and progression ( Chang 2013a ; 
Chang 2013b). 
1.2.2. Safety Pharmacology and Toxicology 
No treatment -related effects were observed in the central nervous system or respiratory system in 
rats at any dose tested. Further, no treatment- related corrected QT interval (QTc) prolongation 
effect was observed at a ny tested dose in a cardiovascular study using telemetry-monitored dogs. 
Based on data from rat and dog including general toxicity studies up to 13 weeks duration, the 
greatest potential for human toxicity with ibrutinib is predicted to be in lymphoid tiss ues 
(lymphoid depletion) and the gastrointestinal tract (soft feces/diarrhea with or without 
inflammation). Additional toxicity findings seen in only one species with no observed human 
correlate in clinical studies to date include pancreatic acinar cell atrophy (rat), minimally 
decreased trabecular and cortical bone (rat) and corneal dystrophy (dog). In studies in pregnant 
rats and rabbits, ibrutinib administration was associated with malformations (teratogenicity) at 
ibrutinib doses that result in approximately 14 and 2 times the exposure (area under the 
concentration -time curve [AUC]) in patients administered the dose of 560 mg daily, respectively. 
Fetal loss and reduced fetal body weights were also seen in treated pregnant animals. Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with ibrutinib. In vitro and in vivo genetic 
toxicity studies showed that ibrutinib is not genotoxic. No effects on fertility or reproductive 
capacities were observed in a study in male and female rats.

1.3.1. Pharmacokinetics and Product Metabolism  
Following oral administration of ibrutinib at doses ranging from 420 to 840 mg/day, exposure to 
ibrutinib increased proportionally with substantial intersubject variability.   The mean terminal 
plasma elimination half li fe (t 1/2) of ibrutinib ranged from 4 to 13 hours, with a median time to 
maximum plasma concentration (T max) of 2 hours.  Despite the doubling in mean systemic 
exposure when dosed with food, the favorable safety profile of  ibrutinib allows dosing with or 
without food.  Ibrutinib is extensively metabolized primarily by cytochrome P450 (CYP)  3A4.  
The on- target effects of the main metabolite PCI -45227 are not considered clinically relevant.  
Steady -state exposure of ibrutinib and PCI-45227 was less than 2 -fold of first dose exposure 
implying non- clinically relevant accumulation.  Less than 1% of ibrutinib is excreted  in the 
urine. Ibrutinib exposure is not altered in patients with creatinine clearance (CrCl) >30  mL/min.  
Patients with severe renal im pairment or patients on dialysis have not been studied.  Following 
single dose administration, the AUC of ibrutinib increased 2.7-, 8.2- and 9.8-fold in subjects with 
mild (Child -Pugh class A), moderate (Child- Pugh class B), and severe (Child -Pugh class  C) 
hepatic impairment compared to subjects with normal liver function.   A higher proportion of 
Grade 3 or higher adverse reactions were reported in patients with B -cell malignancies (CLL, 
MCL and WM) with mild hepatic impairment based on NCI organ dysfunction working group (NCI -ODWG) criteria for hepatic dysfunction compared to patients with normal hepatic 
function.

metabolism, please refer to the current version of the IB. 
1.3.2. Clinical Studies  
As of 4 October 2011, over 300 patient s with various B- cell malignancies have received ibrutinib  
in six clinical studies sponsored by Pharmacyclics.  A total of 133 patient s with CLL or SLL 
have received single-agent ibr utinib  across two clinical studies:  PCYC -04753 in patient s with 
recurrent B-cell lymphoma (including 16 CLL/SLL patients) and a Phase 1b/2 study 
(PCYC-1102- CA) in patients with CLL/SLL (n=117).  Two Phase 1b/2 studies are ongoing to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib  in combination with chemoimmunotherapy or CD20 
monoclonal antibody therapy in relapsed or refractory CLL/SLL patient s, specifically with 
bendamustine/rituximab (BR) and fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) in Study PCYC-1108-CA, and with ofatumumab in Study PCYC-1109- CA. 
Additional clinical studies of ibrutinib in other B- cell malignancies, specifically mantle cell 
lymphoma ( MCL ), diffused large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL and multiple myeloma) have been 
opened and are enrolling patients.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 24 of 114 1.3.2.1. Summary of Efficacy of Ibrutinib in CLL/SLL  
In the Study PCYC-04753, 14/16 (87.5%) patient s with CLL or SLL treated  with ibrutinib met 
the protocol definition of evaluable for assessment of response.  Twelve (12) of the 14 (86%) 
evaluable patients with CLL or SLL achieved a response by the International Workshop Chronic 
Lymphocytic Leukemia (I WCLL , Hallek 2008 ) criteria  (hereafter referred to as IWCLL 2008 
criteria)  or National Cancer Institute (NCI ) Working Group Criteria ( for SLL).  In patient s with 
CLL (n = 11), the time to response was dependent on the time to resolution (< 50% of baseline 
circulating l ymphocyte counts) of a treatment- related lymphocytosis that frequently occurs with  
the initiation of ibrutinib  therapy.  All responding patient s with SLL (n = 5) met the standard 
Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)  response criteria by the Cycle 2 response assessment.  
As of 25 October 2011, the PCYC-1102-CA study had enrolled 61 relapsed or refractory 
CLL/SLL patients who  had previously received purine analog  based therapy.  These patients 
were given single-agent ibrutinib , which showed high activity as mani fested by a high overall 
response rate (ORR) and an estimated 12 -month progression- free survival ( PFS) rate of 86%.  
Responses per IWCLL  2008 criteria improved with continued treatment ; the ORR was 67% in 
patient s treated with ibrutinib  420 mg/day at 12.6 months median follow- up.  Responses were 
independent of high risk factors including disease resistant to purine analog based therapy, 
17p del, age > 70 years, and/or pretreatment cytopenias.  The activity of ibrutinib was durable 
with an  estimated 12 -month PFS rate  of 88% ( Figure 1) in the 420 mg cohort.  There were no  
differences in clinical activity (ORR or PFS) noted between the two dose levels (420 mg  and 
840 mg) ( O’Brien 2011).

Pharmacodynamic effect leading to characteristic pattern of response:   Preclinical studies 
have revealed a vital and multifaceted role for BTK and the BCR signaling pathway in B- cell 
leukemogenesis and lymphomagenesis.  These data suggest that the blockade of the BCR 
signaling pathway by ibrutinib  in CLL results in three majo r effects: 1) direct induction of 
apoptosis and 2) inhibition of cell homing and migration to chemokines and with subsequent adhesion to cellular substrates, and 3) inhibition of proliferation ( Herman 2011; Ponander 2012).  
Owing to the described mechanism of action of BTK inhibition, administration of ibrutinib  to 
patients with lymphoproliferative diseases has been associated with mobilization of tumor cells 
from tissue to peripheral blood ( Chang 2011b; Burger 2010; Pollyea 2009 ). 
This effect begins in some cases within hours of the first administration and typically reaches peak magnitude within the first 3 months of treatment.  Coincident with the ibrutinib  
treatment- related lymphocytosis is a rapid and substantial decrease in lymph node and/or spleen 
size often observed with or without an improvement in hematologic parameters and/or 
symptomatic improvement of disease- related symptoms.  This effect was  noted in CLL/SLL 
patients treated on both PCYC-04753 and PCYC-1102- CA ( Figure 2).

Lymphadenopathy in Patients with CLL/SLL, Study PCYC -1102- CA 
 
ALC:  Absolute lymphocyte count; SPD: Sum of products of lymph node dimension  
 
This phenomenon is a pharmacodynamic effect of ibrutinib , in which the inhibition of 
BTK- mediated cellular homing and adhesion results in a mobilization of CLL cells from the 
lymph node to the peripheral blood compartment.  This pattern of response had previously been 
noted with other agents known to inhibit BCR signaling ( Friedberg  2008; Furman 2010).  This 
treatment- related lymphocytosis resolves over a variab le period of time (median 6 months) with 
the majority of patients meeting IWCLL 2008 criteria for response with continued ibrutinib  
treatment (O’Brien 2011 ).  As such, an increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes in the 
peripheral blood in the absence of symptoms or other indicators of progressive disease has not been considered an indicator of progressive disease by the Investigators in clinical studies with 
ibrutinib .  This is consistent with the recommendation of current National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network (NCCN)  NHL 2012 guideline ( Cheson 2012, Hallek 2012).

1.3.3. Risks  
1.3.3.1. Bleeding -related Events 
There have been reports of hemorrhagic events in patients treated with ibrutinib, both with and 
without thrombocytopenia. These include minor hemorrhagic events such as contusion, epistaxis and petechiae; and major hemorrhagic events, some fatal, including gastrointestinal bleeding, 
intracranial hemorrhage, and hematuria.  Use of ibrutinib in subjects requiring other 
anticoagulants or medications that inhibit platelet function may increase the risk of bleeding.   
Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied.  See Section  6.6.1.4 for 
guidance on concomitant use of anticoagulants, antiplatelet therapy and/or supplements.  See 
Section 6.6.3 for guidance on ibrutinib management with surgeries or procedures. 
1.3.3.2. Leukostasis 
There were isolated cases of leukostasis reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  A high 
number of circulating lymphocytes (> 400,000/µL) may confer increased risk.  For subject and 
ibrutinib management guidance, refer to Section 6.2.5.

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 28 of 114 1.3.3.3. Atrial Fibrillation  
Atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter have been reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib, 
particularly in subjects with cardiac risk factors, hypertension, acute infections, and a previous 
history of atrial fibrillation.  Subjects who develop arrhythmic symptoms (eg, palpitations, 
lightheadedness) or new onset of dyspnea should be evaluated clinically, and if indicated, have 
an ECG performed.  For atrial fibrillation which persists, consider the risks and benefits of ibrutinib treatment and follow the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section  6.2.4).    
1.3.3.4. Cytopenias 
Treatment -emergent Grade 3 or 4 cytopenias (neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia) were 
reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  Subjects should be monitored for fever, weakness, or 
easy bruising and/or bleeding. 
1.3.3.5. Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)  
Cases of interstitial lung disease (ILD) have been reported in patients treated with ibrutinib.  
Monitor patients for pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD.  Should symptoms develop follow 
the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section  6.2.4 ). 
1.3.3.6. Tumor Lysis Syndrome  
There have been reports of tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) events in subjec ts treated with 
single-agent ibrutinib or in combination with chemotherapy.  Subjects at risk of TLS are those 
with comorbidities and /or risk factors such as high tumor burden prior to treatment, increased 
uric acid (hyperuricemia), elevated lactate dehydrogenase ( LDH ), bulky disease at baseline, and 
pre‐existing kidney abnormalities . 
1.3.3.7. Lymphocytosis 
Upon initiation of treatment, a reversible increase in lymphocyte counts (ie, ≥ 50% increase from 
baseline and an absolute count > 5000/µL), often associated with reduction of lymphadenopathy, 
has been observed in most subjects with CLL/SLL treated with ibrutinib.  This effect has also 
been observed in some subjects with MCL treated with ibrutinib.  This observed lymphocytosis 
(increase in the number of circula ting lymphocytes eg, > 400,000/µL) is a pharmacodynamic 
effect and should not be considered progressive disease in the absence of other clinical findings.  In both disease types, lymphocytosis typically occurs during the first few weeks of ibrutinib 
therap y and typically resolves within a median of 8 weeks in subjects with MCL and 14 weeks in 
subjects with CLL/SLL.  Lymphocytosis was not observed in subjects with Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia treated with ibrutinib.  For subject and ibrutinib management guidance, refer 
to Section  6.2.5.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 29 of 114 1.3.3.8. Diarrhea  
Diarrhea is the most frequently reported non-hematologic AE with ibrutinib monotherapy and 
combination therapy.  Other fr equently reported gastrointestinal events include nausea, vomiting, 
and constipation.  These events are rarely severe.  Should symptoms be severe or prolonged, follow the protocol dose modification guidelines (see Section  6.2.4).   
1.3.3.9. Infections  
Infections (including sepsis, bacterial, viral, or fungal infections) were observed in subjects treated with ibrutinib therapy.  Some of these reported infections have been asso ciated with 
hospitalization and death.  Although causality has not been established, cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) have occurred in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  
Subjects should be monitored for symptoms (fever, chills, weakness, confusion) and appropriate 
therapy should be instituted as indicated.  
1.3.3.10. Rash  
Rashes have been commonly reported in subjects treated with either single agent ibrutinib or in combination with other chemotherapy.  In a randomized Phase 3 study (PCYC-1112- CA), rash 
occurred at a higher rate in the ibrutinib arm than in the control arm.  Most rashes were mild to moderate in severity.  Isolated cases of severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) including 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) have been reported in s ubjects treated with ibrutinib.  Subject s 
should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms suggestive of SCAR including SJS.  Subjects receiving ibrutinib should be observed closely for rashes and treated symptomatically, 
including interruption of the suspected agent as appropriate.  In addition, hypersensitivity- related 
events including erythema, urticaria, and angioedema have been reported. 
1.3.3.11. Non-melanoma Skin Cancer 
Non-melanoma skin cancers have occurred in patients treated with ibrutinib.  Monitor pati ents 
for the appearance of non- melanoma skin cancer.  
1.3.3.12. Hypertension  
Hypertension has been commonly reported in subjects treated with ibrutinib.  Monitor subjects 
for new onset of hypertension or hypertension that is not adequately controlled after starting 
ibrutinib.  Adjust existing anti- hypertensive medications and/or initiate anti -hypertensive 
treatment as appropriate.  
2. STUDY RATIONALE  
This randomized, multicenter, open- label , Phase 3 study is designed to evaluate whether 
treatment with ibrutinib  as a monotherapy results in a clinically significant improvement in PFS

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 30 of 114 as compared to treatment with ofatumumab in patient s with relapsed or refractory CLL or SLL 
who have failed at least one prior line of therapy and are not considered appropriate for treatment 
with purine analog based therapy. 
The study design aims to confirm the efficacy findings of the ongoing Phase 1b/2 Study 
PCYC-1102- CA for treatment with ibrutinib  administered orally once dai ly in the cohorts of 
patient s with CLL/SLL who had failed previous treatment(s) .  This study will assess the efficacy 
outcomes between the two arms in relapsed/refractory  patients, including those with a 17p del or 
who are refractory to purine analog based therapy.  In addition, this  study aims to confirm the 
safety and tolerability of ibrutinib  in these patient s as compared to an acceptable comparator, 
ofatumumab , in terms of hematologic and infectious toxicities. 
2.1. Dose Selection Rationale for Ibrutinib 
A once daily 420 mg dose of ibrutinib  has been selected for this Phase 3 study.  This dose and 
regimen were selected in consideration of PK, pharmacodynamics , efficacy, and safety data 
obtained from Studies PCYC-04753 and PCYC-1102- CA as detailed in Section  1.3.  Ibrutinib  
has been administered safely at higher doses in CLL;  however 420 mg once daily is considered 
an acceptable dose to achieve the desired biological effect, with no evidence of improved 
responses or improvement in PFS at doses above 420 mg/day (s ee Figure 1 ). 
2.2. Selection of Ofatumumab as Comparator 
Ofatumumab is a fully humanized type I anti -CD20 monoclonal antibody.  In vitro , it mediates 
complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) against rituximab- resistant Raji cells a nd CLL cells 
with low expression of CD20.  It appears to have greater potency in CDC than rituximab, as well 
as a slower off -rate and more stable CD20 binding ( Teeling 2004).  Additionally, it appears to 
bind a different epitope of CD20 than rituximab ( Teeling 2006) and has demonstrated clinical 
activity that is independent of prior treatment with rituximab (Wierda 2011).  A Phase 1/2 study of ofatumumab in re lapsed/refractory CLL patients demonstrated that it is generally 
well-tolerated, even at high doses, and is active, with an ORR of approximately 50%.  
Infusion- related AEs are similar to those reported with rituximab and decrease following the first 
infusion ( Coiffier 2008) of ofatumumab .  Ofatumumab was evaluated in patients with 
fludarabine- and alemtuzumab -refractory (double refractory [D R]) and bulky fludarabine- 
refractory (BFR) CLL in a seminal study of 138 patients who have received treatment for 
CLL/SLL.  Patients received 8 weekly infusions of ofatumumab followed by 4 monthly infusions 
over a 24-week period, receiving 300 mg as the first dose and 2000 mg for all doses thereafter 
(Wierda 2010).  The ORR was 58% in the DR CLL group and 47% in the BFR CLL group with 
median PFS of 5.7 months and 5.9 months, and overall survival (OS) of 13.7 months and 15.4 months, for the two groups respectively.  This data led to FDA  (Food and Drug Administration) 
and EMA (European Medicines Agency) approval of ofatu mumab in CLL in patient s refractory 
to fludarabine and alemtuzumab.  Currently NCCN NHL 2012 guidelines and European Society

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 31 of 114 for Medical Oncology (ESMO) guidelines support the use of ofatumumab in patients  who have 
received treatment for CLL/SLL ( NCCN 2012 ; Eichhorst 2011).  The most common A Es for 
ofatumumab  are infusion reactions, neutropenia, pneumonia, fevers, cough, and diarrhea.  For 
more information on ofatumumab, ple ase refer to the package insert . 
3. STUDY OBJECTIVES

4. STUDY DESIGN  
This is a randomized, multicenter, open -label, Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of ibrutinib as compared to ofatumumab in patients with relapsed or refractory 
CLL /SLL who have failed at least one prior line of therapy and are not considered appropriate 
candidates for treatment or retreatment with purine analog based therapy. 
Eligible patients will have been diagnosed with CLL/SLL and have relapsed or refractory disease 
following at least 1 line of prior systemic therapy  for CLL/SLL. 
A minimum of 350 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ofatumumab 
(Treatment Arm A) or ibrutinib (Treatment Arm B).  
The site will enter  eligibility  data into an Interactive Web Response System (IWRS)  prior to 
randomization. 
Randomization will be used to minimize bias in the assignment of patients to treatment groups, 
to increase the likelihood that known and unknown patient attributes (eg, demographic and 
baseline characteristics) are evenly balanced, and to enhance the validity of statistical 
comparisons across treatment groups.   Two randomization schemes will be generated: one for 
each geographic region (North America versus Rest of World).  Under each scheme, patients will 
be randomized based on the following two  stratification factors : 
• Presence versus absence of disease refractory to purine analog  and anti-CD20 containing 
chemoimmunotherapy regimen  
• Presence versus absence of 17p del, as defined by the assay  specification on pretreatment 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or cytogenetics evaluation 
Patient  participation will include a Screening Phase, a Treatment Phase, and a Follow -up Phase. 
The Screening Phase will be up to 28 days prior to first dose of study drug, during which the 
patient’s eligibility and baseline char acteristics will be determined.  
The Treatment Phase will extend from randomization until study drug discontinuation.  Patients 
randomized to ofatumumab will receive treatment for up to 6 months per the package insert .  
Patients randomized to ibrutinib will  receive study drug daily until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity.  Further information on dosing is provided in Section  6.  Regularly 
scheduled disease assessments are required throughout the Treatment Phase.  
The Follow-up P hase will be comprised of 2 phases; the Post -treatment Phase and a Post -disease 
Progressi on Phase.  The Post -treatment Phase will extend from the discontinuation of treatment 
up until the patient  has progressive disease or other criteria listed in Section 10.1.  R esponse

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 33 of 114 evaluations will be continued every 12 weeks from the initial dose with study drug until 
18 months and then every 24 weeks until disease progression . 
The Post -disease Progression Phase will begin once a patient has progressive disease.  In this 
phase, subsequent anti cancer therapy  with start date  of therapy , IWCLL indication for treatment 
initiation , additional malignancy occurrence, and patient survival status will be recorded .  The 
Post-disease Progression Phase w ill continue until death, lost to  follow up, consent withdrawal, 
or study closure , whichever occurs first .  It is important that survival status be assessed and that 
the date of death is documented for each patient randomized to treatment , regardless of whether 
or not the patient received treatment. 
Assessment of response and progression will be conducted in accordance with the IWCLL 2008 
criteria with the modification that treatment-related lymphocytosis in the absence of other signs 
or symptoms of disease progression will not be considered progressive disease ( Section 8.1.5).  
The Investigator will evaluate sites of disease by radiological imaging (primary), physical 
exam ination  or other procedures as necessary , review of hematology and serum chemistry 
results, and disease -related symptoms .  The same method s of assessment used to assess disease 
at baseline should be used throughout the study.  A central laboratory will perform all 
hematology and serum chemistry  testing  for the primary endpoint analysis.  The primary efficacy 
analysis will be based on assessment from an IRC.  As part of the IRC review, radiographic 
evaluations assessed by independent central radiologists and hematology results from a central 
laboratory will be provided .  Detailed procedures will be described in a separate charter.  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will be formed and constituted according to 
regulatory agency guidelines.  Detailed information regarding the composition of the DMC and 
detailed DMC procedures will be provided in a separate charter.  The DMC will review the 
safety data periodically and the interim analysis results and provide recommendations according 
to the ch arter.  
One interim analysis using Lan -DeMets alpha spending function based on O'Brien-Fleming 
boundary for both superiority  and futility (non-binding) is planned for the study.  The interim 
analysis will be conducted after approximately 117 PFS events (progressive disease confirmed 
by the IRC or death, whichever occurs first) have occurred.  The DMC will make 
recommendations based on efficacy boundary guidelines.  If pre-specified boundaries are not 
met at the interim analysis, the final analysis of the stu dy will occur after 176 PFS events have 
been observed .   
Access to next- line ibrutinib for patients treated with ofatumumab may be provided following 
Medical Monitor approval as outlined in Section 7.3.4.  
Pharmacyclics will continue to follow up the patients for at least  5 years after the last patient is  
enrolled, at which time a long- term extension study will be made available for active pa tients  
who choose to continue ibrutinib on a clinical protocol when access to commercial ibrutinib is 
not feasible.

Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either T reatment Arm A or B.  
Treatment Arm A: Ofatumumab IV  
Treatment is 12 IV doses over 24 weeks or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or 
the patient meets any criteria specified in Section  10, whicheve r occurs first.  Administration of 
ofatumumab will be in accordance with the manufacturer's package insert . 
Treatment Arm B: Ibrutinib PO  
Treatment is 420 mg (3 x 140- mg capsules) administered orally daily to continue until disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity, or the patient meets any criteria specified in Section  10, 
whichever occurs first . 
6.1. Ofatumumab  
6.1.1. Dosage and Administration 
6.1.1.1. Premedication  
Patients should be premedicated 30 minutes to 2 hours prior to each dose of ofatumumab  with 
975-1000 mg acetaminophen/paracetamol ; 10 mg Cetirizine orally or equivalent antihistamine, 
either IV or oral; and 100 mg IV prednisolone or equivalent corticosteroid . 
Corticosteroid dose reduction:  
• Do not reduce corticosteroid dose for ofatumumab infusions 1, 2, or 9. 
• Corticosteroid doses may be reduced as follows:  
 For Doses 3 through 8: 
• If infusion- related reaction ≥ Grade 3 experienced, do not reduce corticosteroid dose for 
subsequent doses.  
• If infusion-related reaction < Grade 3 experienced, may consider gradually reducing 
corticosteroid dose with subsequent doses.  
 For Doses 10 through 12: 
• If infusion- related reaction ≥ Grade 3 experienced with Dose 9, do not reduce 
corticosteroid dose for subsequent doses. 
• If infusion- related reaction < Grade 3 experienced with Dose 9, may consider 
administer ing prednisolone 50 – 100 mg (or its equivalent) for subsequent doses. 
Ofatumumab infusion premedication should be administered as outlined above and consistent 
with the package insert.  It is recognize d that some institutional variation to these procedure s 
may exist , however for the purposes of this study; the package insert instructions must be 
followed.  Routine infusion premedication with corticosteroid doses of > 100 mg IV

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 41 of 114 6.2. Ibrutinib  
6.2.1. Dosage and Administration 
Ibrutinib 420 mg (3 x 140- mg capsules) is to be admini stered orally once daily with 8 ounces 
(approximately 240 mL) of water.  The capsules should be swallowed intact and patients should 
not attempt to open capsules or dissolve them in water.  
Each dose of ibrutinib should be taken at approximately the same time each day.  Patients should avoid consuming food and beverages containing grapefruit juice or Seville oranges for the 
duration of the study due to CYP 3A4/5 inhibition.   If a dose is missed, it can be taken as soon as 
possible on the same day  with  a return to  the normal schedule the following day.   
Ibrutinib will be dispensed to patients in bottles.  Unused ibrutinib dispensed during previous 
visits mus t be returned to the site and drug accountability records ( Section 13.8) updated at each 
visit.  Returned capsules must not be redispensed to anyone.   Ibrutinib should not be dispensed to 
anyone other than a patient enrolled in the study and can only be dispensed in its original bottle. 
6.2.2. Dose Delay  
Treatment with ibrutinib should be held for any unmanageable, potentially study drug- related 
toxicity th at is Grade 3 or higher in severity.  Please see Section 6.6.1.4 for guidelines for 
management of ibrutinib in patients who requi re anticoagulant treatment . 
Any other clinically important events where dose delays may be considered appropriate by the 
investigator must be discussed with the M edical Monitor. 
Study drug may be held for a maximum of 28 consecutive days for toxicity .  Study treatment 
should be discontinued in the event of a toxicity lasting >28 days, unless reviewed and approved by the M edical Monitor. 
6.2.3. Overdose  
Any dose of study drug administered  in excess of that specified in this protocol is considered to 
be an overdose.  Signs and symptoms of an overdose that meet any SAE  criterion must be 
reported as a SAE  in the appropriate time frame and doc umented as clinical sequelae to an 
overdose.  
There is no specific experience in the management of ibrutinib overdose in patients.  No 
maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ) was reached in the Phase 1 study in which subjects received up 
to 12.5 mg/kg/day (1400 mg/day).  Healthy subjects were exposed up to single dose of 1680 mg. 
One healthy subject experienced reversible Grade 4 hepatic enzyme increases (AST and ALT) 
after a dose of 1680 mg.  Subjects who ingested more than the recommended dosage should be 
closely  monitored and given appropriate supportive treatment. 
Refer to Section 9.3 for further information regarding AE reporting.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 42 of 114 6.2.4. Dose Reduction and Discontinuation 
The actions in  Table 2  should be taken for the following toxicities: 
• Grade 4 ANC (< 500/µL) for > 7 days (Neutrophil growth factors are permitted per 
ASCO guidelines  [Smith 2006] and use must be recorded in C
RF). 
• Grade 3 or
 4 platelets (< 50,000/µL); or, in patients with baseline thrombocytopenia, a 
platelet decrease of 50 -74% from baseline in presence of significant bleeding 
• Grade 4 Platelets (< 25,000/µL); or, in patients with baseline thrombocytopenia, decrease of ≥ 75% from baseline or < 20,000/µL, whichever is higher 
• Grade 3 or 4 nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea, if persistent despite optimal antiemetic and/or anti-diarrheal therapy 
• Any other Grade 4 toxicity or unmanageable Grade 3 toxicity. 
For Grade 3 or 4 atrial fibrillation or persistent atrial fibrillation of any grade, consider the risks 
and benefits of ibrutinib treatment. If clinically indicated, the use of anticoagul ants or antiplatelet 
agents may be considered for the thromboprophylaxis of atrial fibrillation ( Section 6.6.1.4).  
Table 2: Drug Discontinuation Actions for Ibrutinib  
Occurrence  Action  
1st Hold ibrutinib until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline; may restart at original dose level  
2nd Hold ibrutinib until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline; restart at one dose level lower ( 280 mg 
daily)  
3rd Hold ibrutinib until recovery to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline; restart at one dose level lower ( 140 mg 
daily)  
4th Discontinue ibrutinib  
Dose changes must be recorded in the Dose Administration CRF. 
6.2.5. Treatment -related Lymphocytosis 
Treatment -related lymphocytosis, for the purposes of this protocol, is defined as an elevation in 
blood lymphocyte count of ≥50% compared to baseline that occurs in the setting of improvement 
in at least one other disease- related parameter and is associated wi th agents known to inhibit 
BCR (see Section 8.1.5 for additional details)  (Hallek 2012, NCCN 2012 , Cheson 2012) .  Given 
the known mechanism of action of BCR-inhibiting agents including ibrutinib, treatment- related 
lymphocytosis is an expected and frequent pharmacodynamic phenomenon observed with initiation (or re -initiation) of ibrutinib.  Ibrutinib associated treatment-related lymphocytosis 
generally occurs within the first weeks of therapy, peaks within the first few months, and resolves slowly.  Asymptomatic treatment- related l ymphocytosis should not be considered an AE 
and patients should remain on study treatment. 
Product: IBRUTINIB (PCI -32765)  Protocol PCYC -1112- CA 28 September 2016  
IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 43 of 114 Specifically, u pon initiation of treatment, a transient phase of increase in lymphocyte counts 
(ie, ≥50% increase from baseline and above absolute count of 5,000/µL) , often associated with 
reduction of lymphadenopathy, has been observed in most patien ts (75%) with relapsed/ 
refractory CLL/SLL and some patients (33%) with relapsed/refractory MCL treated with 
ibrutinib monotherapy.  This observed transient lymphocytosis is usually not associated with an 
adverse event and should not be considered progressive disease in the absence of other clinical 
findings. In both disease types, lymphocytosis typically occurs during the first few weeks of 
ibrutinib therapy (median time 1.1 weeks) and resolves within a median of 7.1 weeks in the MCL 
and 18.7 weeks in the CLL patients.  
A substantial increase in the number of circulating lymphocytes has been observed in a subset of 
patients.  There have been isolated cases of leukostasis reported in patients treated with ibrutinib.  
A high number of circulating malignant cells (≥400,000/ µL) may c onfer increased risk; these 
patients should be closely monitored.  Administer supportive care such as hydration and/or 
leukophoresis as indicated.  Ibrutinib may be temporarily held, and M edical Monitor should be 
contacted. 
6.2.6. Dose Modification for Hepatic Impaired Subjects  
Ibrutinib is metabolized in the liver and therefore subjects with clinically significant hepatic 
impairment at the time of screening (Child - Pugh class B or C) are excluded from study 
participation.  For subjects who develop mild liver impairment while on study (Child- Pugh class 
A), the recommended dose reduction for ibrutinib/placebo is to a level of 280 mg daily (two 
capsules).  For subjects who develop moderate liver impairment while on study (Child-Pugh 
class B), the recommended dose reduction is to a level of 140 mg daily (one capsule).  Subjects 
who develop severe hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh class C) must hold study drug until 
resolved to moderate impairment (Child -Pugh class B) or better.  Monitor subjects for signs of 
toxicity and follow dose modification guidance as needed ( Refer to  Appendix L ). 
6.2.7. Precautions  and Adverse Events  
The most common treatment -emergent adverse events were diarrhea, fatigue, nausea, cough and 
anemia. Additional common AEs such as peripheral edema, pyrexia, vomiting, constipation, 
upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, dyspnea, thrombocytopenia, decreased appetite, 
headache, muscle spasm, neutropenia, contusion, abdominal pain, dizziness, pneumonia, 
myalgia, and dyspepsia have been reported.  In  addition, Events of Special Interest are outlined 
in Section 9.3.4.  For complete information on precautions refer to the IB.

This is an open -label study; neither patient s nor Investigators will be blinded to treatment. 
The primary efficacy evaluation will be performed by an IRC, wh ich will be blinded to study 
treatment information  and lymphocyte count. 
6.6. Concomitant Therapy  
6.6.1. Concomitant Medications to be Used With Caution  
Antiemetics are permitted if clinically indicated.  Standard supportive care medications are 
permitted; this includes pre -medication for ofatumumab infusion as per the ofatumumab package 
insert.  Use of neutr ophil growth factors (filgrastim and pegfilgrastim) is permitted per the 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines ( Smith 2006).  
For patients considered at risk for tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) : 
Patient s with more than one of the following factors are considered to be at increased risk of TLS 
and should be considered for hydration and treatment with a n uric acid lowering agent (xanthine 
oxidase inhibitor allopurinol or Uloric [febuxostat] +/ - rasburicase per th e drug products package 
insert)  prior to treatment with study drug , as well as for frequent monitoring of tumor lysis 
associated signs and symptoms. 
• Serum creatinine ≥ 1.5x ULN  
• WBC ≥ 50,000/mm3 
• Uric acid > ULN  
6.6.1.1. Guideline for Use of CYP Inhibiting/Inducing  Drugs  
Ibrutinib is metabolized primarily by CYP3A 4. Avoid co- administration with strong or moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors and consider alternative agents with less CYP3A inhibition. Co- administration 
of ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, in 18 healthy subjects increased dose normalized exposure, C
max and AUC 0-last, of ibrutinib by 29- and 24-fold, respectively.  The maximal 
observed ibrutinib exposure ( AUC) was ≤2 -fold in 37 patients treated with mild and/or moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors when compared with the ibrutinib exposure in 76 patients not treated 
concomitantly with CYP3A inhibitors.  Clinical safety data in 66 patients treated with moderate 
(n=47) or strong CYP3A inhibitors (n=19) did not reveal meaningful increases in toxicities. 
Strong inhibitors of CYP3A (eg, ketoconazole, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir, 
clarithromycin, telithromycin, itraconazole, and nefazadone) should be avoided. If a strong CYP3A inhibitor must be used, consider reducing the ibrutinib to 140 mg or withhold treatment 
temporarily.  Subjects should be monitored for signs of ibrutinib toxicity. If the benefit 
outweighs the risk and a moderate CYP3A inhibitor must be used, reduce ibrutinib to 140 mg for

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 46 of 114 the duration of the inhibitor use.  Monitor subject for toxicity and follow dose modification 
guidance as needed.  For subjects who are already on a moderate CYP3A inhibitor 
concomitantly with ibrutinib without significant toxicity the investigator may consider the 
overall risk -benefit to determine if a dose reduction of ibrutinib is appropriate.   Avoid grapefruit 
and Seville oranges during ibrutinib treatment, as these contain moderate inhibitors of CYP3A (see Section 6.2.1).   No dose adjustment is required in combination with weak CYP3A 
inhibitors. 
Co-administration of ibrutinib with strong CYP3A inducer, rifampin, in healthy subjects 
decrease ibrutinib plasma concentration by approximately  10-fold.  Avoid concomitant use of 
strong CYP3A inducers (eg, carbamazepine, rifampin, phenytoin, and St. John’s Wort).  
Consider alternative agents with less CYP3A induction. 
A list of common CYP3A inhibitors and inducers is provided in Appendix C ; a comprehensive 
list of inhibitors, inducers, and substrates may be found at 
http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/main -table/ .  This website is continually revised and 
should be checked frequently for updates. 
6.6.1.2. Drugs That May Have Their Plasma Concentrations Altered by Ibrutinib  
In vitro studies indicated that ibrutinib is not a substrate of P -glycoprotein (P -gp), but is a mild 
inhibitor (with an IC
50 of 2.15 μg/mL).  Ibrutinib is not expected to have systemic drug-drug 
interactions with P -gp substrates.   However, it cannot be excluded that ibrutinib could inhibit 
intestinal P -gp after a therapeutic d ose.  Currently, no clinical data is available; therefore, co -
administration of narrow therapeutic index P-gp substrates (eg, digoxin) with ibrutinib may 
increase the substrate’s blood concentration and should be used with caution and subjects should 
be mo nitored closely for toxicity.  
6.6.1.3. Concomitant Use of QT Prolonging Agents 
Any m edications known to cause QT prolongation should be used with caution; periodic 
monitoring with electrocardiograms and electrolytes should be considered. 
6.6.1.4. Concomitant Use of Antiplatelet Agents and Anticoagulants  
Warfarin or vitamin K antagonists should not be administered concomitantly with ibrutinib.  
Ibrutinib should be used with caution in patients requiring other anticoagulants or medications 
that inhibit platelet function.  Supplements such as fish oil and vitamin E preparations should be 
avoided.  Subjects with congenital bleeding diathesis have not been studied.  For guidance on ibrutinib and the use of anticoagulants during procedures/surgeries see Section 6.6.3.  
Patients requiring the initiation of therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (eg, atrial fibrillation), consider the risks and benefits of continuing ibrutinib treatment.  If therapeutic anticoagulation is 
clinically indicated, treatment with ibrutinib should be held and not be restarted until the patient

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 47 of 114 is clinically stable and has no signs of bleeding.  Patients should be observed closely for signs 
and symptoms of bleeding.  No dose reduction is required when study drug is restarted. 
6.6.2. Prohibited Concomitant Medications  
Any chemotherapy, anticancer immunotherapy, corticosteroids (at dosages equivalent to 
prednisone >20 mg/day), experimental therapy, or radiotherapy are prohibited.  Localized , 
hormonal, or bone sparing treatment for non- B cell malignancies may be considered with 
approval of the medical monitor.  Steroids used to premedicate or manage ofatumumab infusion-
related reactions or contrast allergies  are permitted .  In addition, short courses (<14 days) of 
treatment for non -cancer related medical reasons (treatment for autoimmune cytopenias are 
permitted) at doses not to exceed 100 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent are permitted .  Routine 
infusion premedication with corticosteroid dose s of > 100 mg IV prednisolone (or equivalent) is  
not permitted.   Red blood cell growth factors (eg, erythropoietin) , platelet grow th factors (eg, 
thrombopoietin) and sargramostim are also prohibited  for the first six months of study treatment.  
However, ini tiation of red blood cell growth factors (eg, erythropoietin), platelet growth factors 
(eg, thrombopoietin) and/or sargram ostim can be considered after 6  months on study based on 
the indication outlined in the respective package inserts. 
6.6.3. Guidelines for Ibrutinib Management with Surgeries or Procedures  
Ibrutinib may increase risk of bleeding with invasive procedures or surgery.  The following 
guidance should be applied during the perioperative period for subjects who require surgical 
intervention or an invasive procedure while receiving ibrutinib:   
• For any surgery or invasive procedure requiring sutures or staples for closure, ibrutinib 
should be held at least 7 days prior to the intervention and should be held at least 7 days 
after the procedure and restarted at the discretion of the investigator when the surgical site is reasonably healed without serosanguineous drainage o r the need for drainage 
tubes. 
• For minor procedures (such as a central line placement, n eedle biopsy, thoracente sis, or 
paracentes is) ibrutinib should be held for at least 3 days prior to the procedure and should 
not be restarted for at least 3 days after the procedure.  For bone marrow biopsies that are performed while the subject is on ibrutinib, it is not necessary to hold ibrutinib for these 
procedures.   
• For emergency procedures, ibrutinib should be held after the procedure until the surgical 
site is reasonably healed, for at least 7 days after the urgent surgical procedure.  
7. EFFICACY AND SAFETY PROCEDURES  
The Schedule of Assessments is provided in Appendix A .  Descriptions of the scheduled 
evaluations are outlined below.

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 48 of 114 Before study entry, throughout the study, and at the follow-up evaluations , various clinical and 
diagnostic laboratory evaluations are outlined.  The purpose of obtaining these detailed 
measurements is to ensure adequate safety and efficacy assessments.  Clinical evaluations and 
laboratory assessments may be repeated more frequently if clinically indicated.  
7.1. Description of Procedures  
7.1.1. Informed Consent  
The patient  must read, understand, and sign the Institutional Review Board/Research Ethics 
Board/Independent Ethics Committee (IRB/REB/IEC)-approved informed consent form (ICF) 
confirming his or her willingness to participate in this study before any study- specific screening 
procedures are performed.  Patients must also grant permission to use protected health information  per Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).  In addition, 
patient s must sign all approved ICF amendments per the site IRB/REC/IEC’s guidelines during 
the course of the study. 
7.1.2. Confirmation of Eligibility  
Perform all necessary procedures and evaluations to document that the patient meets each 
eligibility criterion (Section 5).  Please refer to the study manual for a more detailed description 
of the enrollment procedures.  Blood samples for hematology, coagulation, and serum chemistry 
collected at Screening  will be evaluated by a central laboratory to confirm  eligibility .  If central 
labs submitted during the screening period are unable to be resulted (eg, specimen clotted or hemolysis) to support eligibility, the M edical Monitor may review local labs and approve the 
patient for randomization based on these la b values on a case by case basis provided another 
sample is redrawn and submitted prior to treatment.  
7.1.3. Medical History  
Collect and record the patient ’s complete history including concurrent medical signs and 
symptoms.  Disease history, including the date of initial diagnosis, Rai and Binet staging  
(Appendix I ) within 28 days of first dose with study drug, documentation of refractory disease, 
prior antican cer treatments with best responses and progression free interval to these treatments, 
and history of autoimmune CLL complications and their treatment will also be recorded  based 
upon available documents and patient history. 
7.1.4. Adverse Events  
The accepted regulatory definition for an AE is provided in Section 9.2.  All  medical occurrences 
that meet the AE  definition must be recorded from the time the ICF  is signed  until 30 days after 
the last dose of study drug.  Laboratory abnormalities designated clinically significant by the

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 49 of 114 Investigator will also be recorded as AEs.  Additional important requirements for AE and SAE 
reporting are explained in Section  9.3. 
7.1.5. Physical Examination, Height and Weight 
Physical examinations should include height ( Screening only) and weight , examination of the 
skin, eyes, ears, nose, throat, lungs, heart, abdomen, extremities, and lymphatic system.  The 
lymphatic system examination will include bidimensional measurements of palpable lymph 
nodes and measurement of spleen  and liver size s by centimeters below the costal margin on the 
respective side.  Only physicians , physician assistant,  or oncology nurse p ractitioners  should 
perform the lymphatic system examination.  As much as possible,  the same person should 
perform all the lymphatic exams for a given patient. 
7.1.6. Eye-related Symptoms Assessment  
The patients will be asked about the following eye- related symptoms at Screening and 
throughout the study:  dry eye, watering eye/abnormal discharge, eye pain, blurred vision/double 
vision, decreased visual acuity, photophobia/sensitivity to light, floaters, flashing lights, and eye 
irritation.  
If there are any symptom s of severity ≥ Grade 2 at Screening, an ophthalmologic exam must be 
completed prior to dosing with study drug.  If, during the study, any symptom worsens to 
severity ≥ Grade 2 or a symptom that was Grade 2 or higher at baseline worsens, an 
ophthalmologic exam must be performed. 
7.1.7. Disease- related Symptoms  
Disease-related symptoms including fatigue, night sweats, fever, weight loss, anorexia, and 
symptoms of splenomegaly (abdominal pain/discomfort) will be assessed and recorded in the 
patient records.  
7.1.8. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature.  
7.1.9. Electrocardiogram  (ECG)  
Patient s should have a 12 -lead ECG done at Screening.  Abnormalities should be included in the 
medical history, as appropriate. 
ECGs sh ould be performed at the investigator’s discretion, particularly in patients with 
arrhythmic symptoms (eg, palpitations, lightheadedness) or new onset dyspnea.

The ECOG performance index is provided in Appendix B . 
7.1.11. Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS) 
CIRS is an indicator of illness severity and comorbidity in older patients ( Extermann 1998).  
CIRS scoring is to be performed by a licensed provider (eg, physician, physician assistant, or 
nurse) for all patients 65 years and older in the setting of a pretreatment history and physical 
(refer to Appendix H  for details) . 
7.1.12. Prior and Concomitant Medicat ions 
Document all medications from 14 days before the start of study drug administration through 
30 days after the last dose of study drug. 
After  a patient discontinues study treatment, receipt of all subsequent anticancer  therapies will be 
collected until patient  death. 
7.1.13. Patient -reported Outcomes (PRO) 
Three PRO instruments, including the EORTC QLQ -C30 ( Appendix E ), EQ-5D-5L 
(Appendix F ), and FACiT -fatigue ( Appendix G ), will be administered in this study.   These 
questionnaires are to be completed by the patient prior to any other study procedures at required visits. 
7.1.13.1. EORTC QLQ -C30 
The EORTC  QLQ-C30 includes 30 separate questions (items) resulting in 5 functional scales 
(Physical Functioning, Role Functioning, Emotional Functioning, Cognitive Functioning, and 
Social Functioning), 1 Global Health Status scale, 3 symptom scales (Fatigue, N ausea and 
Vomiting, and Pain), and 6 single items (Dyspnea, Insomnia, Appetite Loss, Constipation, Diarrhea, and Financial Difficulties) (Fayers 2001).  The recall period is 1  week (the past week). 
The EORTC  QLQ-C30 has bee n widely used among cancer patients in general , and specifically 
in NHL  patients.  It is a reliable and valid measure of PRO in cancer patients and takes about 
11 minutes to administer. 
7.1.13.2. EQ-5D-5L 
The EQ -5D-5L is a standardized instrument for use as a measur e of health outcome 
(The Euro  Qol Group 1990).  The EQ -5D-5L is a 5 -item questionnaire and a “thermometer” 
visual analogue scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health state) to 100 (best imaginable 
health state).  The scores for the 5 separate questionnaires are categorical and should not be 
analyzed as cardinal numbers.  However, the scores for the 5 dimensions are used to compute a

individual.  The United Kingdom weights will be used to genera te patient utilities from the 
5 dimensions of the EQ-5D-5L in this study. 
7.1.13.3. FACiT- Fatigue  
The FACi T-Fatigue questionnaire is an instrument for use as a measure of fatigue-related quality 
of life in patients with cancer and other chronic diseases ( http://www.facit.org ).  The 13- item 
FACiT -Fatigue Scale measures each item on a 5‐point Likert scale.  The FACiT -Fatigue Scale 
has been validated in the general population ( Cella 2002) as well as in patients with cancer or 
rheumatoid arthritis.  
7.1.14. Pregnancy Test  
Pregnancy tests (urine or serum) are required at Screening only for women of childbearing 
potential.  If positive, pregnancy must be ruled out by ultrasound to be eligible.  This test may be 
performed more frequently if required by local regulatory authorities. 
7.1.15. Hepatitis Serologies  
Hepatitis serologies include  Hepatitis C antibody, Hepatitis B surface antigen, Hepatitis  B 
surface antibody, and Hepatitis  B core antibody and will be evaluated by central laboratory.  
Hepatitis  B surface antigen  must be confirmed negative prior to enrollment.  If  Hep atitis  B core 
antibody is positive , then Hepatitis B PCR to quantitate Hepatitis B DNA must be performed .  
DNA PCR needs to be confirmed negative (<29 U)  prior to randomization in patients who are 
Hepatitis  B core antibody positive.  Patients who are hepatitis C PCR positive will be excluded.  
7.1.16. Hematology  
Hematology will be eva luated by a central laboratory and will include a complete blood count 
(CBC) with white blood cell differential.  Any missing central lab blood samples should be 
redrawn as soon as possible.  In the event that the missing central lab sample is unrecoverabl e, 
local lab results will be collected , if available,  and entered in the clinical database for response or 
progression confirmation. 
7.1.17. Coagulation Studies  
Measurement of prothrombin time (PT)/INR, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 
will be perf ormed at Screening  using a central laboratory .  Any missing central lab blood 
samples should be redrawn as soon as possible.

Serum chemistry will be evaluated by a central laboratory and will include albumin, alkaline 
phosphatase, ALT, AST, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium, creatinine, glucose, lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH), phosphate, potassium, sodium, total bilirubin, and uric acid.  Any missing 
central lab blood samples should be redrawn as soon as possible.  
7.1.19. Serum Immunoglobulin and β 2-microglobulin  
Sample(s) will be sent to a central laboratory for quantitative immunoglobulin (IgG, IgM, IgA) 
levels, and serum β2-microglobulin. 
7.1.20. Sparse Pharmacokinetics (PK) Sample Collection  
Sparse PK samples will be collected  in patients randomized to ibrutinib .  Samples will be 
collected from at least 100 patients.  Five (5) blood samples will be collected per patient  on the 
Week 1 Visit . 
1.  Pre-dose  
2.  1 hour (window: 45–75 minutes )  
3. 2 hours (window: 1.5–2.5 hours )  
4.  4 hours (window: 3.5–4.5 hours )  
5.  6 hours (window: 5–8 hours) 
Patient s will also undergo sampling at the Week 4* visit.  These patient s will be sampled at:  
1.  Pre-dose  
2.  1 hour (window: 45–75 minutes )  
3. 2 hours (window: 1.5–2.5 hours )  
4.  4 hours (window: 3.5–4.5 hours) 
On the day of the sampling visit , the patient  will not take a dose before arrival at the clinic.  
Study drug intake will be observed by clinic staff.  The time of the PK sample and the time of the 
study drug dose will be recorded in the CRF.  
*Note:  If patient is unable to complete PK assessments at the Week 4 visit, it is acceptable to 
complete these assessments at the Week 8 visit.  
7.1.21. Pharmacokinetics Sample Collection for Patients Treated with Concomitant 
CYP3A4 /5 Inhibitors  on Ibrutinib Treatment  
For patients who must take strong or moderate CYP3A4/5  inhibitors while on treatment with 
ibrutinib, additional PK collections for evaluation of ibrutinib exposure may be requested at the 
following scheduled visit aft er concomitant CYP3A4 /5 inhibitor ha s started and still in use.  
PK samples will be collected at:

2.  1 hour (window: 45–75 minutes)  
3. 2 hours (window: 1.5–2.5 hours)  
On the day of the sampling visit, the patient will not take the dose of ibrutinib before arrival at 
the clinic.  Study drug intake will be observed by clinic staff.  The time of the PK sample and the 
time of the study drug dose will be recorded. 
7.1.22. Bone Marrow Aspirate and Biopsy  
For E ligibility  
A unilateral bone marrow aspirate or biopsy must be obtained at S creening or up to 90 days prior 
to randomization.  Patient s who have a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy result since completion 
of their last therapy for CLL may use those bone marrow results provided the biopsy or  aspirate 
was done <90 days prior to randomization. 
For Response Evaluation  
If the patient’s physical examination findings, laboratory evaluations, and radiographic 
evaluations suggest that CR has been achieved in all response parameters, a bone marrow 
aspirate and biopsy must be obtained to confirm the CR and to evaluate minimal residual disease 
(MRD) by flow cytometry.  In the event a marrow aspirate was not successfully submitted for MRD, a peripheral blood sample should be submitted.  In cases where cytopenic progression is 
suspected, a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy should be performed to distinguish autoimmune and 
drug- related cytopenias.  
7.1.23. Cytogenetic CLL FISH Panel  
Cytoge netic profiles will use the stan dard CLL FISH probes to detect abnormalities in 
chromosomes 13q, 12, 11q, and 17p.  Within 90 days prior to randomization, a peripheral blood 
sample or bone marrow sample (aspirate or biopsy) must be tested for FISH analysis for 
stratification purpose .  For pat ients without lymphocytos is FISH should be performed on the 
bone marrow sample.  A previous FISH and/or cytogenetic result demonstrating the presence of 17p del as per the assay specification  will be considered adequate for stratification provided 
appropriate documentation is avai lable .  Results must be documented in the patient chart prior to 
randomization for the purposes of stratification.  At Screening, peripheral blood will be collected 
for confirmation of FISH result.  Screening peripheral blood (required) and marrow samples 
(where available) will be sent to a central vendor to be tested for 17p del, 13q-, +12, 11q-, to assist with the validation of the Abbott probe kit for use as prognostic marker . 
7.1.24. Determination of T/B/NK Counts  
In order to monitor the effects of ibrutinib on the immune cells in patients, specifically on the 
normal B cells, T  cells and NK cells, whole blood samples will be analyzed for absolute T/B/NK

be performed at the central lab on the same blood sample collected for standard hematology. 
7.1.25. Flow Cytometry -based Immunophenotype Assays 
To determine the temporal effect of study drugs on the phenotype of malignant cells in patients, 
blood samples will be collected  and analyzed centrally .  Samples taken in the first 6 months will 
be more frequent in order to capture the treatment -effect of lymphocytosis.  Samples will also be 
collected at a suspected CR and at disease progression or discontinuation of treatment.  From 
these samples , peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) will be separated, collected and 
frozen as viable cells.  The cell pellets will be  analyzed at a future date by flow cytometry, for 
expression of cell surface markers including  CD3, CD19, CD45, CD5, Igλ/κ+, CXCR4 and 
CD38 .  These samples will also be stained intracellularly for Ki67, pBtk, pSyk, pPLC γ, pErk and 
pAkt to monitor changes taking place within the tumor cells . 
7.1.26. Genetic and Molecular Prognostic Markers  
A blood sample will be collected and analyzed centrally to study the pretreatment prognostic 
factors.  These prognostic factors have previously been associa ted with disease outcome in CLL 
patients.  
IgVH and p53 Mutational Status 
One sample will be collected to study leukemia cell immunogl obulin heavy- chain variable 
(IgVH) and p53 mutational status. 
CD38 and ZAP-70 Leukemia Cell Expression 
One sample will be collected to study the leukemia cell expression of CD38 and ZAP -70. 
7.1.27. Exploratory Investigations of Predict ive Biomarkers and Mechanism of 
Treatment Resistance  
Additional blood samples will be collected and assessed or maintained centrally to evaluate 
potential biomarkers related to response to therapy and/or to investigate potential mechanisms of 
treatment resistance.  These samples may be later characterized by technologies such as gene 
expression profiling, mutational analysis by sequencing, secreted protein analysis, and 
intracellular signaling pathway analysis.   Inhibition of BTK and other related kinases may also 
be explored in these cells.  It is expected that these efforts may identify genes and pathways associated with primary or later development of resistance to ibrutinib by comparison of patients 
with variable outcomes which could potentially generat e biomarkers that could assist  with future 
development of this compound.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 55 of 114 7.1.28. Computed Tomography (CT) Scans  
Radiological imaging by CT with contrast is required and must include the pelvis, abdomen, 
chest, and neck.  Patients who are intolerant to IV CT contrast agents will have CT scans 
performed with oral contrast.  When possible, all patients should have radiographic tumor 
measurements performed at the participating study center or an acceptable alternate imaging 
facility using an identical imaging protocol and similar equipment.  The sa me imaging 
equipment should be utilized for all scans whenever possible.  The same radiologist should be assigned to read all the scans for a given patient throughout the study as much as possible. 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be used to evaluate n ontarget lesions that cannot be 
adequately imaged using CT (in cases where MRI is desirable, the MRI must be obtained at 
baseline and at all subsequent response evaluations).  If MRI is required for any other reason, 
this must be discussed with the study M edical Monitor first.  
CT scans will be performed until disease progression regardless of whether or not the patient remains on treatment.  In the event disease progression is suspected due to physical examination 
or laboratory test, a CT scan must be performed to confirm disease progression.  
There must be radiographically measurable disease at Screening (at least one lymph node > 1.5 cm in the longest diameter) as outlined in Section 8.1.4.  If the sole lesion lies within the 
field of prior radiotherapy, there must be evidence of disease progression in that lesion. 
Up to 6 measurable lymph nodes (target lesions > 1.5 cm in the longest diameter ), clearly 
measurable in 2 perpendicular dimensions, will be followed as target lesions for each patient.  
Measurable sites of disease should be chosen such that they are representative of the patient’s 
disease.  In addition, selection of target lesions should be from as disparate regions of the body 
as possible when these areas are significantly involved.  If additional lesions are present but are 
not included in the target lesion assessment, they can be added as non- target lesions followed  
throughout the study.  
The cranial -caudal measurement of the spleen and longest diameter of the liver will be assessed 
at Screening and all subsequent response evaluations.  
A central imaging service will be utilized to provide independent radiological asse ssments for 
the purposes of the primary endpoint.  These measurements will not be reported back to the site. 
7.1.29. Medical Resources U tilization  (MRU)  
Hospitalizations, emergency department visits, blood product transfusions, and hematopoietic 
growth factor use will be collected for each treatment arm . 
7.1.30. Routine Clinical Assessment s 
Routine clinical  assessments include physical exams, recording of symptoms, and hematological 
evaluations to evaluate for both AEs and for disease progression at times when the CT scan is

progression is confirmed.  The Investigator should report any suspected disease progression to 
the Sponsor or designee via the electronic data capturing (ED C) system within 24 hours of 
discovery.  Patients should continue to be followed and adhere to study- related  procedures until 
progression has been confirmed regardless of the administration of subsequent anticancer therapy.  New anticancer therapy may be withheld if clinically appropriate in the absence of 
confirmed progressive disease.  In addition, lab assessments for disease progression will need to 
be confirmed by the central lab.  
7.1.31. Overall Response Evaluations 
Overall response assessments will includ e evaluation of physical exams, recording of symptoms, 
hematological evaluations, and radiographic evaluations per the schedule of assessments (see 
Appendix A  and Appendix M ).  Patients who have signs and symptoms of progression outside of 
the scheduled assessment, should be evaluated by the investigator with a physical exam and a 
CBC with differential to determine if disease progression is present.  Patients may continue study 
treatment until progression is confirmed by a serial exam at least 2 weeks later.  In addition, 
when clinically appropriate, based on investigator perceived risk benefit assessment, a patient 
may continue treatment until progression is confirmed, unless considered medically 
contraindicated.  New anticancer therapy may be withheld if clinically appropriate in the absence 
of confirmed progressive disease.  The blood samples for response or dis ease progression 
determination will need to be confirmed by a central laboratory. 
For response assessments occurring without a CT scan, the investigator should evaluate response 
on available clinical data, including physical examinations and laboratory results. For patients 
who appear to be CR by all other parameters, a CT scan  and evaluation of MRD status are 
required to confirm CR. 
Following the DMC review of interim efficacy analysis data, procedures surrounding expedited 
reporting of progressive disease are not required and IRC review may  no longer occur. 
7.1.32. Survival 
After progression, patients will be contacted to assess survival status approximately every 
12 weeks until death, withdrawal by patient, lost to follow- up, or study terminated by Sponsor, 
whichever comes first .  At the time of the interim analysis  and at study closure , a survival sweep 
will be conducted.  All patients who are on study and not known to have died prior to the 
survival sweep will be contacted at that time.  
7.1.33. Subsequent Anticance r Therapies 
After study drug treatment is complete, the following information on subsequent anticancer 
therapies will be collected approximately every 12 weeks until death, withdrawal by patient, lost 
to follow-up, or study terminated by Sponsor, whichever comes first :

• IWCLL indication for initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy 
• Response to all subsequent anticancer therapies 
7.2. Drug Concentration Measurements 
7.2.1. Sample Collection and Analysis  
Sparse PK samples will be collected from  at least 100  patients  on the ibrutinib arm .  Refer to the 
laboratory binder for instructions on collecting and processing these samples. 
Plasma samples will be analyzed by a validated and specific LC -MS/MS method for the 
determinatio n of ibrutinib  and PCI-45227, a metabolite of ibrutinib,  in human plasma. 
Exploratory analyses may be performed for other potential metabolites of ibrutinib in plasma. 
7.2.2. Pharmacokinetic Assessment  
Plasma concentrations, dosing history, demographic data, and other covariates will be assembled 
into a dataset suitable for a population PK analysis.  The analysi s will be performed using 
mixed -effects methods.  
Based on previous PK studies for ibrutinib, it is likely that the structural model will include two 
systemic compartments and first -order absorption and will be linear with respect to dose and 
stationary with respect to time.  Parameters of the PK model will be apparent clearance, apparent 
distribution clearance, apparent distribution volumes (central and peri pheral), absorption rate, 
and absorption lag.  Absorption, distribution, and elimination half- lives and steady -state AUC 
will be calculated from these parameters.  
If the assumptions of linearity and stationarity are flawed, other m odels will be evaluated.  After 
determination of the structural model, covariates will be evaluated for inclusion into the model 
using forward addition.  The final model will be evaluated using one or more of the following 
methods: visual predictive check, likelihood profiles, or bootstrap analysis. 
Similar analyses will be performed for PCI-45227. 
For patients who received CYP3A4/5 inhibitors, as data permitted, a descriptive comparison of 
ibrutinib and PCI-45227 plasma concentrations after ibrutinib administration alone and in 
combination with CYP3A4/5 inhibitors will be explored. 
Pharmacokinetic relationships to pharmacodynamic measures of ef ficacy or toxicity will also 
be explored.

7.3.4. Treatment with  Ibrutinib for Patients on Control Arm  
On 0 3 January 2014, the DMC determined that the primary endpoint of the study had been met 
and the analysis be considered final. Pa tients randomized to  ofatumumab  who  meet the criteria 
outlined in Section  7.3.4.1, per the investigator's discretion, can receive next -line therapy with 
ibrutinib  and wil l follow the schedule in Appendix M .  Treatment with ibruntib can be continued 
until disease progression as determined by the i nvestigator, or until they meet the criteria for 
withdrawal in Section 10 .  Patients must meet all of the criteria for next- line therapy with 
ibrutinib  listed in Section 7.3.4.1.  With Medical Monitor approval, local labs can be used to 
determine appropriateness for next- line ibrutinib . 
7.3.4.1. Criteria for Next -line Ibrut inib Therapy  
1. Medical Monitor approval  
2. ECOG Performance Status of ≤3 ( Appendix B )

7.3.4.2. Next -line Ibrutinib Therapy  Treatment  Phase  
Refer to the next- line ibrutinib therapy Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix M ) for a complete 
list of procedures to be performed at each scheduled study visit.  
8. MAIN EFFICACY EVALUATIONS  
Disease evaluations will include:  
• Physical examination (which will focus on the presence or absence or increase or 
decrease in lymph nodes, liver, and spleen). 
• CBC with measurement of parameters by a central laboratory.  
• Computed tomography ( CT) scan of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis (further timing 
is discussed in Section 7.3.2.7 and in the Schedule of Assessments [ Appendix A ]). 
Efficacy assessments, for the purpose of the study result analyses, will be performed by an IRC 
blinded to study treatment information and independent of Investigators and personnel who are 
involved in the conduct of the study.  The process and convention of the IRC will be detailed in a 
separate charter.  
8.1. Definitions  
8.1.1. Refractory  
Refractory is defined as treatment failure or progression within 12 months post- treatment . 
8.1.2. Relapsed  
Relapsed is defined as a patient who met criteria for CR or PR, but progressed beyond 12 months post- treatment.  
8.1.3. Treatment Failure  
Treatment failure is defin ed as best response of progressive disease or SD while on study 
treatment.  
8.1.4. Measurable Disease  
Patients must have at least 1 measurable site of disease to participate in this study.  Measurable 
sites of disease are defined as lymph nodes, or lymph node mass es.  Each measurable site of

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 65 of 114 disease must be greater than 1.5 cm in the longest diameter.  Measurement must be determined 
by imaging evaluation. 
Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiated area might or might not be considered 
measurable.  If there are tumor lesions in previously irradiated areas and progression has 
occurred, these lesions will be considered measurable.  If tumor lesions in previously irradiated 
areas are present and have been stable, then these lesions are not considered me asurable.  
If tumor lesions in previously irradiated areas progress during the study, then disease progression 
will be considered as having occurred provided progression is confirmed by IRC. 
All other sites of disease will be considered assessable.  Assessable disease includes objective 
evidence of disease that is identified by radiological imaging, physical examination, or other 
procedures, as necessary , including peripheral blood counts. 
8.1.5. Treatment -related Lymphocytosis 
Treatment -related lymphocytosis, for the purposes of this protocol, is defined as an elevation in 
blood lymphocyte count of ≥50% compared to baseline and ≥5000/µL that occurs in the setting 
of unequivocal improvement in at least one other disease-related parameter including lymph 
node size, spleen size, hematologic parameters (Hgb or platelet count), or disease- related 
symptoms.  Given the known mechanism of action of BCR-inhibiting agents including ibrutinib, treatment- related lymphocytosis is an expected and frequent pharmacodynamic phenome non 
observed with initiation (or re -initiation) of ibrutinib.  
Response assessment in CLL patients treated with novel agents has b een clarified by the authors 
of the IWCLL 2008 guidelines and is outlined in the NCCN NHL 2012 guidelines, supporting that patients with isolated lymphocytosis in the setting of improvement in other disease parameters 
should not be considered to have progressive disease or treatment failure ( Cheson 2012).  
8.1.6. Richter’s  Transformation 
Richter's syndrome (RS) is lymphomatous transformation to a more aggressive histology in a 
patient with CLL or SLL.  RS is most often characterized by the development of high-grade 
NHL or Hodgkin’s disease.  Symptoms of Richter ’s transformation  can include new or 
progressive lymphadenopathy or organomegaly, fever, loss of weight and muscle mass, and other health problems.  Richter 's transformation can be suggested by a CT/PET scan, but should 
be confirmed with a biopsy (eg, lymph node) demonstrating the histologic transformation  
whenever possible. 
8.1.7. Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)  
Patients who have achieved a CR should be evaluated for eradic ation of disease cells as 
determined by flow cytometry on the bone marrow aspiration when available.

Radiological e fficacy assessments, for the purpose of the study result analyses, will be performed 
by the IRC , which will be blinded to study treatment information.  The process and convention 
of the review will be detailed in a separate charter.  
The baseline disease assessment will include all areas of known and suspected disease with use 
of the most appropriate and reproducible radiological technique. 
8.3. Guidelines for Evaluation  
Table 3 outlines what is required for each parameter  at baseline to be evaluable throughout the 
study. 
Table 3: E valuable Parameter Requirements 
Parameter  Requirements to be Evaluable for Response  
Measurable Disease (required for all patients)  Lymph Node > 1.5cm  
Splenomegaly Enlarged spleen  
Hepatomegaly  Enlarged liver  
Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC)  ≥ 4,000 /µL  
Platelets  ≤100,000 /µL  
Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC)  ≤ 1500 /µL  
Hgb ≤ 11.0 g/dL  
8.4. Response Categories 
Assessment of response should include physical examination, radiographic imaging, and 
evaluation of blood and marrow per the schedule of assessments (see Appendix A  and  
Appendix M ) and to confirm CR.  Definition of response for CR, CRi, nPR, PR, PR with 
lymphocytosis, and disease progression will b e evaluated by the criteria listed in  Table 4 .  
Category A criteria define the tumor load and Category B criteria define the function of the hematopoie tic system . Response must be confirmed by CT and central labs, and must last at least 
2 months  without transfusional support or growth factor product to be considered a confirmed 
response.  
8.4.1. Complete Response (CR)  
All of the following are required for a CR: 
• No significant lymphadenopathy (>1.5cm) palpable on examination or by CT 
• No hepatosplenomegaly on examination or by CT

body weight loss within last 6 months, no night sweats for >1 month without other 
evidence of infection, no fatigue interfering with work or usual activities) 
• Neutrophils >1.5 x109/L, platelets >100,000/μL, and Hgb >11g/dL without recent growth 
factor or transfusions  
• ALC <4,000 /µL 
Marrow aspirate and biopsy must be performed after all other criteria meet the definition of CR.  
To define a CR, the marrow sample must be at least normocellular for age, with less than 30% of 
nucleated cells being lymphocytes.  B- lymphoid nodules should be absent. In addition, in 
patients with a CR, MRD by flow cytometry should be performed to evaluate MRD status.

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 69 of 114 8.4.2. Complete Response with an Incomplete Marrow Recovery (CRi)  
CRi is defined as a CR with an incomplete recovery of the patient’s bone marrow.  Patients who 
have a CRi fulfill all criteria for a CR, but continue to have persistent anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
or neutropenia.  These cytopenias are due to drug toxicity in the bone marrow and are not due to 
any evidence of CLL.  If the marrow is hypocel lular, a repeat determination should be performed 
after 4 weeks, or when peripheral blood counts have recovered.  However, this time interval should not exceed 6 months. 
8.4.3. Nodular Partial Response (nPR)  
nPR is a response where patients meet criteria for a CR, but the bone marrow biopsy shows that 
there are still B -lymphoid nodules, which may represent a clonal infiltrate.  These nodules are 
residual disease and therefore the patient is termed an nPR.  
8.4.4. Partial Response (PR)  
A ≥50% drop in lymphocyte count from baseline or ≤4.0 x 10
9/L is required for a PR and all of 
the following are observed: 
• ≥50% decrease in the sum products of up to 6 lymph nodes, a ≥50% decrease in the 
longest diameter of the single lymph node, or normalization of lymphadenopathy when 
compared to baseline. 
• No new enlarged lymph nodes by physical examination or CT AND no increase in any 
lymph node by CT.  Note:  In a small lymph node <2  cm, an increase of less than 25% is 
not considered to be significant.  
• When abnormal, a ≥50% decrease in the enlargement of the spleen and/or liver from 
baseline or normalization by CT 
Plus a response in at least one of the following evaluable criteria independent of growth factor

• Neutrophils >1.5 x109/L, or ≥50% improvement over baseline 
• Platelets >100,000/ μL or ≥50% improvement over baseline 
• Hgb >11 g/dL or ≥50% improvement over baseline 
* Note: If all criteria are normal, defined as neutrophils >1.5 x109/L, platelets

Not meeting criteria for CR, CRi, nPR, PR, PR with lymphocytosis, or progressive disease.  
8.4.7. Progressive Disease  
A CT scan is required to evaluate all cases of suspected progressive disease for this protocol 
regardless of the modality of disease progression (eg . lymph node, lymphocytosis, 
or transformation).  Progressive disease requires at  least ONE of following: 
• New enlarged nodes >1.5 cm, new hepatomegaly or splenomegaly; or other organ 
infiltrates  
• ≥50% increase from nadir in existing lymph node (must reach >1.5 cm in the longest diameter) or ≥50% increase from nadir in sum of product of diameters of multiple nodes 
• ≥50% increase from nadir in enlargement of liver or spleen 
• ≥50% increase from baseline in lymphocyte count (and to ≥5 x10
9/L) unless considered 
treatment- related lymphocytosis ( Section 8.1.5 ) 
• New cytopenia (Hgb or platelets) attributable to CLL.  The progression of any cytopenia (unrelated to autoimmune cytopenia , drugs, or bleeding), as documented by a decrease of 
Hgb levels from baseline by more than 20 g/L (2g/dL) or to less than 100 g/L (10g/dL) and lower than baseline, or by a decrease of platelet counts from baseline by ≥50% or to 
less than 100 × 10
9/L (100,000/μL) and lower than baseline in the presence of active 
CLL, defines disease progression  ; a marrow biopsy must demonstrate an infiltrate of 
clonal CLL cells if no other evidence of disease progression is present on CT scan . 
• Transformation to a more aggressive histology (eg, Richter’s Transformation ).  
Whenever possible, this diagnosis should be established by biopsy. 
Suspected progressive disease must be confirmed by a serial exam at least 2 weeks later.   Please 
see Section 7.1.31 on details regarding suspected PD and IRC confirmation. 
8.5. Sustained Hematological Improvement  
In the subset of patients with cytopenia(s) at baseline (Hgb ≤11g/dL, platelets ≤100,000/μL, or 
ANC ≤1500/μL), time to improvement in blood counts and percentage of patients with sustained 
improvement in blood counts, (sustained improvement, defined as improvement in cytopenia by 
≥50%, or Hgb >11g/dL, ANC >1500 cells/μL, platelets >100,000/μL with the duration of 
improvement lasting for at least 2 months without blood transfusion or growth factors), will be 
recorded . 
8.6. Resolution of Pretreatment Disease- related Symptoms  
Resolution of pretreatment symptoms includ ing fatigue, weight loss, anorexia, fevers, night 
sweats, or symptoms of splenomegaly will be evaluated .

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 71 of 114 9. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
9.1. Safety Monitoring Plan 
The safety of this study will be assessed by an independent DMC.  All enrolled patients will be 
evaluated clinically and using standard labor atory test ing during their participation in this study. 
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording AEs and SAEs; measurements of 
protocol- specified hematology, clinical chemistry, and other laboratory variables; measurement 
of protocol-spe cified vital signs; and other protocol- specified tests that are deemed critical to the 
safety evaluation of the study drug(s). 
9.2. Definitions  
9.2.1. Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  administered a pharmaceutical product 
and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically significant abnormal 
laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational study drug, whether or not considered related to the study drug ( ICH-E2A, 1995). 
For the purposes of this clinical study, AE s include events which are either new or represent 
detectable exacerb ations of pre-existing conditions. 
Disease progression is not an adverse event; rather it may be the cause of an adverse event.  The 
clinical diagnosis that is associated with disease progression must be reported as all other adverse 
events.  “Disease progression” should never be used as an adverse event term.  
Adverse events may include, but are not limited to: 
• Subjective or objective symptoms spontaneously offered by the patient and/or observed 
by the Investigator or study staff including laboratory abnorm alities of clinical 
significance.  
• Any AE s experienced by the patient through the completion of final study procedures. 
• AEs not previously observed in the patient  that emerge during the protocol- specified AE 
reporting period, including signs or symptoms associated with CLL/SLL that were not 
present before the AE reporting period (see Section 9.3.1) 
• Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions (eg, invasive 
procedures such as biopsies). 
The following are NOT considered AEs: 
• Pre-existing condition:  A pre -existing condition (documented on the medical history 
CRF) is not considered an AE unless the severity, frequency, or character of the event 
worsens during the study period. 
Product: IBRUTINIB (PCI -32765)  Protocol PCYC -1112- CA 28 September 2016  
IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 72 of 114 • Pre-planned or elective hospitalization:  A hospitalization planned before signing the 
informed consent form is not considered an SAE, but rather a therapeutic intervention.  
However, if during the pre -planned hospitalization an event occurs, which prolongs the 
hospitalization or meets any other SAE criteria, the event will be considered an SAE.  
Surgeries or interventions that were under consideration, but not performed before enrollment in the study, will not be considered serious if they are performed after 
enrollment in the study for a condition that has not changed from its baseline level.  Elective h ospitalizations for social reasons, solely for the administration of 
chemotherapy, or due to long travel distances are also not SAEs.  
• Diagnostic Testing and Procedures:   Testing and procedures should not to be reported 
as AEs or SAEs , but rather the cause for the test or procedure should be reported. 
• Asymptomatic Treatment Related Lymphocytosis:  This event should also not be 
considered an AE.  Patients with treatment-related lymphocytosis should remain on study 
treatment and continue with all study -related procedures.  
9.2.2. Serious Adverse Event  
Note: The terms “ severe ” and “serious” are not synonymous .  Severity (or intensity) refers to the 
grade of an AE (see below).  “Serious” is a regulatory definition.  
A SAE  (experience) or reaction is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death ( ie, the AE actually causes or leads to death) . 
• Is life -threatening.  L ife-threatening is defined as an AE in which the patient  was at risk 
of death at the time of the event.  It does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it were more severe.   If either the Investigator or the Sponsor 
believes that an AE meets the definition of life- threaten ing, it will be considered 
life-threatening.  
• Requires in -patient  hospitalization >24 hours or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity ( ie, the AE results in substantial 
disruption of the patient ’s ability to conduct normal life functions). 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• Is an important medical event that may not resul t in death, be immediately 
life-threatening or requir e hospitalization, but may be considered a n SAE  when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the patient or patient may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in this definition.  Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency department or at home 
for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, or convulsion that does  not result in 
hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Given that the I nvestigator’s perspective may be informed by having actually observed the event, 
and the Sponsor is likely to have broader knowledge of the drug and its effects to inform its 
evaluation of the significance of the event, if either the Sponsor or the Investigator believes that 
the event is serious, the event will be considered serious.

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 73 of 114 9.2.3. Severity  
Definitions found in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 
(CTCAE  v4.0) will be used for grading the severity (intensity) of nonhematologic AEs.  Refer to 
Appendix D  for the grading of hematologic AEs.  The CTCAE v4.0 displays Grades 1 through 5 
with unique clinical descriptions of severity for each refere nced AE.  Should a patient experience 
any AE not listed in the CTCAE v4.0, the following grading system should be used to assess severity:  
• Grade 1 (Mild AE) – experiences which are usually transient, requiring no special 
treatment, and not interfering with  the patient ’s daily activities  
• Grade 2 (Moderate AE) – experiences which introduce some level of inconvenience or 
concern to the patient, and which may interfere with daily activities, but are usually 
ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures  
• Grade 3 (Se vere AE) – experiences which are unacceptable or intolerable, significantly 
interrupt the patient ’s usual daily activity, and require systemic drug therapy or other 
treatment 
• Grade 4 (Life -threatening or disabling AE) – experiences which cause the patient  to be in 
imminent danger of death 
• Grade 5 (Death related to AE) – experiences which result in patient  death  
9.2.4. Causality  
The Investigator is to assess the causal relation ( ie, whether there is a reasonable possibility that 
the study drug caused the event) using the following definitions: 
Not Related:  Another cause of the AE is more plausible; a temporal sequence 
cannot be established with the onset of the AE and administration of the investigational product; or, a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible.  
Unlikely:  The current knowledge or information about the AE indicates that a relationship to the investigational product is unlikely.  
Possibly Related:  There is a clinically plausible time sequence between onset of the AE and administration  of the investigational product, but the AE 
could also be attributed to concurrent or underlying disease, or the use of other drugs or procedures.  Possibly related should be used 
when the investigational product is one of several biologically 
plausible AE  causes.  
Related:  The AE is clearly related to use of the investigational product.

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 74 of 114 9.2.5. Unexpected  Adverse Events  
An “unexpected” AE is an AE that is not listed in the Investigator's Brochure/package insert or is 
not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed.  For example, hepatic necrosis 
would be “unexpected” (by virtue of greater severity) if the Investigator's Brochure referred only 
to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral 
vasculitis wou ld be “unexpected” (by virtue of greater specificity) if the Investigator's Brochure/ 
package insert listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  "Unexpected" also refers to AEs that are 
mentioned in the Investigator's Brochure as occurring with a class of dr ugs or as anticipated from 
the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with 
the study drug under investigation. 
9.3. Documenting and Reporting of Adverse and Serious Adverse Events by 
Investigators 
The Investigato r is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or reported 
during the study, as outlined in the prior sections, are recorded on the CRF.  All SAEs also must 
be reported on the SAE Worksheet (see Section  9.3.3).  
9.3.1. Adverse Event Reporting Period  
All adverse events will be reported from the time the patient signs the Informed Consent Form 
until 30 days fo llowing the last dose of study drug. 
If an SAE is present at the End-of-Treatment  Visit, the SAE should  be followed to resolution or 
until the Investigator assesses the patient as stable, or the patient  is lost to follow -up or 
withdraws consent.  Resolution/stable means the patient  has returned to baseline state of health 
or the Investigator does not expect any further improvement or worsening of the event. 
If a death occurs within 30 days after the last dose of study drug, the death must be reported to 
the Sponsor as an SAE. 
Any SAE that occur s more than 30 days after the last dose of the study drug and is deemed 
related to ibrutinib, must be reported to the sponsor.   
9.3.2. Assessment of Adverse Events 
Investigators will assess the occurrence of AEs and SAEs at all patient evaluation timepoints 
during the study.  All AEs and SAEs whether volunteered by the patient, discovered by study 
personnel during questioning, detected through physical examination, clinically significant 
laboratory test, or other means will be recorded in the patient ’s medical record and on the AE 
CRF and, when applicable, on the SAE Worksheet.

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 75 of 114 Each recorded AE or SAE will be described by its duration (ie, start and end dates), severity, 
regulatory seriousness criteria (if applicable ), suspected relationship to the investigational 
product, and any actions taken. 
9.3.3. Expedited Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events 
All SAEs (initial and follow -up information) will be reported on the SAE Worksheet and faxed 
to Pharmacyclics Drug Safety, or designee, within 24 hours of the discovery of the event or 
information.  Pharmacyclics may request foll ow-up and other additional information from the 
Investigator ( eg, hospital admission/discharge notes and laboratory results).  The contact 
information (phone, fax and email) for the drug safety can be found on the SAE Worksheet form  
and instructions. 
All d eaths should be reported with the primary cause of death as the AE term, as death is 
typically the outcome of the event, not the event itself.  The primary cause of death on the 
autopsy report or the adverse event/SAE most proximal to death should be the term reported.  
Autopsy and postmortem reports must be forwarded to Pharmacyclics Drug Safety, or designee, as outlined above. 
If study drug is discontinued because of an SAE, this information must be included in the SAE 
report.  
9.3.4. Events of Special Interest  
Specific adverse events, or groups of adverse events, will be followed as part of standard safety 
monitoring activities by the Sponsor.  These events will be reported to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of awareness following the procedure described above for SA Es (Section  9.3.3) 
and will require enhanced data collection.  All Events of Special Interest will be submitted 
without a serious criterion selected if no other serious criterion is met.  
9.3.4.1. Major Hemorrhage 
Defined as any hemorrhagic event that is Grade 3 or greater in severity, or that results in one of 
the following: intraocular bleeding causing loss of vision, the need for a transfusion of two or 
more units of red cells or an equivalent amount of whole blood, hospitalization or prolongation 
of hospitalization. 
Events meeting the definition of major hemorrhage will be captured as an event of special 
interest according to  Section 9.3.4 above. 
9.3.4.2. Intracranial Hemorrhage 
Any intracranial hemorrhage adverse event, including subdural hematoma/hemorrhage, epidural hematoma/hemorrhage and intracerebral hemorrhage, of any grade severity, will be captured as 
an event of special interest according to Section 9.3.4 above.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 76 of 114 9.3.5. Other Ma lignancies  
In addition to all routine AE reporting, all new malignant tumors including solid tumors, skin 
malignancies and hematologic malignancies are to be reported for the duration of study treatment 
and during any protocol-specified follow-up periods including post-progression follow-up for 
overall survival.   
9.3.6. Pregnancy  
Before study enrollment, patient s must agree to take appropriate measures to avoid pregnancy.  
However, should a pregnancy occur in a female study patient , consent to provide follow-up 
information regarding the outcome of the pregnancy and the health of the infant until 30 days old 
will be requested.  
A female patient  must immediately inform the investigator if the patient  becomes pregnant from 
the time of consent to 30 days after the last dose of ibrutinib or to 12 months following the last 
dose of ofatumumab.  A male patient  must immediately inform the investigator if the patient’s 
partner becomes pregnant from the time of consent to 3 months after the last dose of study drug.  Any female patient s receiving ibrutinib  capsules who become pregnant must immediately 
discontinue study drug.  The I nvestigator should counsel the patient , discussing any risks of 
continuing the pregnancy and any possible effects on the fetus. 
Although pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE, the outcome will need to be documented.  
Report any pregnancy that occurs in a patient or patient’s partner from the time of consent to 
30 days after the last dose of study drug.  Record any occurrence of pregnancy on the Pregnancy 
Report Form Part I and fax to Pharmacyclics Drug Safety, or designee, within  24 hours of 
learning of the event.  With consent the pregnant female will be followed for outcome, which is 
defined as elective termination of the pregnancy, miscarriage, or  delivery of the fetus.  For 
pregnancies with an outcome of live birth, the newborn infant will be followed until 30 days old 
by completing the Pregnancy Report Form Part II.  Any congenital anomaly/birth defect noted in 
the infant must be reported as an S AE. 
9.3.7. Eye-Related Adverse Events 
New or worsening eye-related symptoms that are Grade ≥2 should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist whose findings should be reported on the ophthalmic CRF. 
9.4. Reporting of Serious Adverse Events by Sponsor 
Regulatory Authorities, IRBs/REBs/ IECs, and Investigators will be notified of SAEs in 
accordance with applicable requirements (eg , Good Clinical Practices  [GCPs ], ICH guidelines, 
national regulations, and local requirements).

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 77 of 114 The Pharmacyclics Pharmacovigilance Committee will review and evaluate accumulating safety 
data from the entire clinical trial database for ibrutinib  at appropriate intervals (eg , quarterly) to  
identify new safety signals or increased frequency of events.  This will include an aggregate 
review and comparison to the control group  of SAEs that were deemed as “not suspected” of 
being associated with use of ibrutinib  because they were likely to have been manifestations of 
underlying disease or that commonly occur in the patient population . 
10. WITHDRAWAL OF PATIEN T FROM TREATMENT OR STUDY  
Investigators are encouraged to keep a patient experiencing clinical benefit on study  treatment  
unless significant toxicity puts the patient at risk or routine noncompliance puts the study 
outcomes at risk.  
10.1. Discontinuation of Treatment  
If the patient meets any of the following criteria then discontinuation from treatment is mandatory: 
• Progressive disease as determined by protocol defined criteria  
• Toxicity as defined in dose discontinuation portions of the protocol 
• Death  
• Withdrawal from treatment by patient  including withdrawal of informed consent  
• Investigator decision  
• Completion of treatment regimen  (applies to ofatumumab only) 
• Requires prohibited treatment 
• Lost to f ollow -up 
• Study terminated by Sponsor 
10.2. Withdrawal from the Study  
A patient may be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons including : 
• Death  
• Lost to f ollow -up 
• Study terminated by Sponsor 
• Withdrawal of consent  
o Withdrawal of consent is the primary reason for study termination only if a 
patient refu ses any further contact or follow up.  Please contact Medical Monitor 
within 24 hours of any consent withdrawal. 
In case a patient is lost to follow -up, every possible effort must be made by the study site 
personnel to contact the patient and determine the re ason for discontinuation.  The measures 
taken to follow-up must be documented in the patient’s records. 
When a patient withdraws before completing the study, the reason for withdrawal must be 
documented in the source documents.

• Medical resource utilization  (MRU)  associated with the therapy including the number of 
hospitalizations, emergency department visits, blood product transfusions, and use of 
hematopoietic growth factors. 
• PK characteristics of ibrutinib  in patients with CLL/SLL and to determine which, if any, 
covariates (eg, age, gender, body size, race) influence exposure to ibrutinib . 
• Exploratory evaluation of predictive biomarkers and/or mechanisms of resistance.  
12. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
This section outlines statistical analysis approaches and methods f or the study.  Specific details 
for efficacy and safety analyses will be described in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
12.1. General Considerations 
12.1.1. Independent Review Committee  (IRC) 
The IRC will be chaired by a physician with expertise in CLL and SLL and wi ll conduct 
response evaluations in accordance with the IRC charter . 
12.1.2. Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) 
The safety of this study will be monitored by an independent DMC. 
An early safety analysis will be performed after approximately 50 patients have been treated for 
approximately 8 weeks.  This analysis will focus on deaths, treatment discontinuations, SAEs, 
and grade 3/4 AEs as well as special events of interest.  This information will be reviewed by the 
Medical Monitor  on an ongoing basis until this early safety analysis is conducted.  The chair of 
the DMC, with involvement of the DMC statistician , as needed, will issue a recommendation as 
to whether the study should be interrupted during this period.  If the DMC recommends the tria l 
be continued, the DMC will review safety data every 6 months.  Otherwise, the DMC may 
request further safety analyses.   Results from a pre- specified interim analysis will also be 
reviewed by the DMC . 
The independent DMC will be chaired by a physician with expertise in CLL and SLL.  The 
DMC will review data and provide recommendations regarding stopping or continuing the trial 
in accordance with the DMC charter.  The Sponsor may attend only the blinded portion of the 
DMC meetings to answer questions as necessary.  The DMC charter will provide provisions for restricted communications between the DMC and the Sponsor in the event the DMC 
recommends stopping the study for safety or superiority.  Follo wing the DMC review of the 
prespecified interim analysis and the unanimous recommendation that the study be stopped early 
and patients on ofatumumab be provided access to ibrutinib – the DMC reviews have concluded.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 80 of 114 12.2. Randomization 
Two randomization schemes will be generated : one for each geographic region (North America 
versus Rest of World).  Under each scheme, randomization will be stratified using the following 
two stratification factors  and patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 
ofatumumab or ibrutinib within each randomization stratum : 
a) The presence or absence of disease that is refractory to purine analog and anti- CD20 
containing chemoimmunotherapy regimen (at least 2 cycles).  Refractory is defined 
as treatment failure (best overall response of SD or progressive disease on treatment) 
or disease progression within 12 months of the last dose of purine analog. 
b) The presence or absence of 17p del as determined by the assay specification on 
pretreatment FISH or cytogenetics evaluation . 
12.3. Sample Size  considerations  
This study is designed to evalua te PFS and is powered based on this endpoint.  Therefore, the 
desired operating characteristics for the PFS endpoint are used to determine the study’s total 
sample size and overall duration.  
With the agreement from the  European (Rapporteur and Co-Rapporte urs) and US Health 
Authorities , the overall two-sided significance level for this study is revised from 0.01 to 0.05. 
Given this revision in overall significance level , 176 PFS events provides approximately 90% 
power to detect the target hazard ratio of 0.6 based on a log-rank test and a two -sided overall 
significance level of  0.05 adjust ed for one planned interim analysis. 
The sample size and power calculations are based on a two-sided log-rank test for PFS and a 
two-sided log- rank test for OS and were calculated using the s oftware package East 5.4 (Cytel 
Software Corp., Cambridge, MA). 
12.4. Interim Analysis  
A pre -specified interim analysis for both superiority  and futility (non-binding) will be performed 
after approximately 117 IRC confirmed PFS events are r eported.  Futility will be evaluated by a 
one-sided test. One -hundred and seventeen (117) PFS events correspond to 66.5% of the revised 
planned number of PFS events (176 ) for the final analysis.  Lan-DeMets spending function with 
O’Brien -Fleming boundary w ill be  used as an early stopping guidance ( O'Brien 1979) .  At the 
interim analysis , the alpha spending for PFS will be determined based on the actual information 
fraction using O’Brien -Fleming boundary.  Significance level for all secondary endpoints except 
OS will be adjusted with the same significance level as for PFS at the interim analysis.  The two 
sided significance level for OS will be 0.03 at the interim analysis.  The independent DMC will 
review the interim PFS analysis results and make a recommendation accordingly.  Details 
regarding interim efficacy analysis will be described in the DMC charter and the SAP.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 81 of 114 12.5. Final Analysis  
The final analysis for the PFS  will be conducted after approximately 176 PF S events are 
confirmed by the IRC. T he two -sided significance level for the final analysis for primary and all 
secondary endpoints will be adjusted to  account for interim alpha spending so the overall two -
sided significance level for the study will be preserved at 0.05.   
12.6. Analysis Populations  
12.6.1. Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population  
The ITT population is  defined as all patients who were randomized.  All efficacy analysis will be 
performed using the ITT population and patients in the ITT population will be analyzed as 
randomized. In addition, ITT population will be used to summarize demographics, and baseline 
and disease characteristics.  
12.6.2. Safety Population 
The safety population includes all patients who received at least one dose of  study drug.  The 
safety analysis wi ll be performed using the safety population and patients in the safety 
population will be analyzed as treated. 
12.6.3. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Evaluable Population 
Pharmacokinetic (PK)  evaluable population includes patient s who received at least 1 dose of 
study drug and had at least one post- treatment sample obtained.  
12.6.4. Biomarker Population  
Biomarker population includes patient s whose biomaterial is available and who have consented 
to participate in the study’s biomarker evaluation. 12.7. Control for Bias  
The following study design components will facilitate the control for bias:  
• Large (approximately 350 patients)  
• Multicenter  
• Randomized  
The randomization code will be controlled through a centralized procedure and will not be

IND # 102,688   Version: Amendment 7 
Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 82 of 114 12.8. Efficacy Analyses 
All the stratified analyses will be based on the two randomization stratification factors: 
1) refractory disease (presence versus absence) to purine analog and anti-CD20 containing 
chemoimmunotherapy regimen, and 2) status of 17p del (presence versus absen ce). 
12.8.1. Primary Endpoint  and Methods  
The primary efficacy endpoint is PFS , which is defined as the  time from  the date of 
randomization until disease progression ( assessed by the IRC per IWCLL 2008 criteria) or death 
from any cause, whichever occurs first .  Patients who withdraw from the study or are considered 
lost to follow -up without prior documentation of disease progression will be censored on the date 
of the last adequate disease assessment.  For patients without an adequate post- baseline disease 
assessment, PFS will be censored on the date of randomization. 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed in the ITT population to compare PFS as 
assessed by the IRC  for the two treatment arms using a stratified log rank test.  Distribution of 
PFS will be summarized for each treatment arm using median and its corresponding 95% 
confidence interval based on Kaplan- Meier estimates.  The estimate of the hazard ratio and its 
corresponding 95 percent confidence interval will be computed using a Cox Propor tional 
Hazards model stratified by the two randomization stratification factors.  
12.8.2. Secondary Endpoints and Methods  
12.8.2.1. Overall Survival (OS) and Survival Rate at Landmark Points  
Patients will be followed for survival status until end of study. 
OS is defined as t he time from date of randomization until date of death due to any cause.  
Patients who are known to be alive or whose survival status is unknown will be censored at the date last known to be alive.  Patients who are completely lost to follow-up for surviva l will be 
censored at randomization date.  
The analysis methods for overall survival will be similar to those described for PFS.  
In addition, survival rate at landmark points will be summarized for each treatment arm using 
Kaplan -Meier point estimates and compared using the standard normal Z test. 
12.8.2.2. Overall Response Rate 
Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients who achieve a CR, CRi, nPR, or PR over the course of the study as evaluated by the IRC using IWCLL 2008 criteria.  
Patients  who do not have any post- baseline response assessment will be considered as 
non-responders.  A Cochran- Mantel -Haen szel chi -square test, stratified by the two 
randomization stratification factors, will be used to compare the two treatment arms.

PRO as measured by FACiT -Fatigue will be summarized as the change in scores from baseline 
to each assessment.  
12.8.2.4. Hematological Improvements  
In the subset of patient s with cytopenia(s)  at baseline (Hgb ≤11 g/dL, platelets ≤100,000/μL, or 
ANC ≤1500 /μL), time to sustained improvement and percentage of patients with sustained 
hematological improvement will be measured .  Sustained hematological improvement is defined 
as improvement in cytopenia by ≥50%, or Hgb >11 g/dL, ANC >1500/μL, platelets >100,000/μL 
with the duration of improvement lasting for at least 2 months without blood transfusion or 
growth factors.  
• Time to sustained improvement in blood count will be compared using unstratified log 
rank test.  The distribution of the time to sustained improvement will be summarized 
using Kaplan -Meier estimates. 
• Percentage of patients with sustained improvement will be compared using χ2 test. 
12.8.3. Exploratory Endpoints and Methods  
12.8.3.1. Investigator- Assessed PFS  
Investigator- assessed PFS is defined as time from randomization until disease progression 
(assessed by the Investigator  per IWCLL 2008 criteria) or death from any cause, whichever 
occurs first.  
Analysis methods for Investigator- assessed PFS will be similar to those described for PFS as 
assessed by the IRC. 
12.8.3.2. Investigator- Assessed ORR  
Investigator- assessed ORR will be summarized and analyzed similarly to IRC -assessed ORR.  
12.8.3.3. Improvement of Disease- related Symptoms

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 84 of 114 For EQ -5D-5L, change in weighted utility score from baseline to each assessment will be 
summarized.  The scores for the five categorical dimensions will be used to compute a single 
utility score ranging from zero (0.0) to one (1.0) representing the general health status of the 
patient.  The United Kingdom weights will be used to generate patient util ities from the 
5 dimensions. 
12.8.3.5. Biomarker Analysis  
Analyses are to identify biomarkers that are predictive of response (or resistance) to ibrutinib . 
Analyses will be performed within each treatment group in total and stratified by clinical 
covariates or molecular subgroups.  The associations of biomarkers with clinical response or 
time-to-event endpoints will be assessed using the appropriate statistical methods (analysis of 
variance [ANOVA], categorical, or survival model), depending on the endpoint.  Correlation of 
baseline expression levels or changes in expression levels with response or time- to-event 
endpoints will identify responsive (or resistant) subgroups. 
12.8.3.6. Medical Resource Utilization (MRU) Associated with the Therapy  
Parameters collected for MRU associated with the therapy include number of hospitalizations, 
number of emergency department visits, number of blood product transfusions, and number of 
use of hematopoietic growth factors.  Those parameters will be summarized with descriptive 
statistics by treatment arm.  
12.8.3.7. Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis 
The plasma concentration data for ibrutinib  will be summarized using descriptive statistics at 
each timepoint.  Population PK analysis of plasma concentration -time data of ibrutinib  will be 
performed using nonlinear mixed- effects modeling.  Data may be combined with data from other 
studies to support a relevant population PK model.  Available patient  characteristics 
(eg, demographics, laboratory variables, genotypes, etc.) will be tested as potential covaria tes 
affecting PK parameters. Details will be given in a population PK analysis plan and the results of 
the population PK analysis will be presented in a separate report.  
12.9. Safety Analyses  
Safety summaries will inclu de tabul ations in the form of tables and listings.  The safety analysis 
will be conducted using the safety population.  Patients will be analyzed according to the actual 
treatment received.  
Study drug exposure including duration and dosage as well as dose modificatio ns of study drug 
including dose reduction, dose delay, missed doses, and dose interruption will be summarized.

Adverse events (AEs) will be graded by the Investigator according the NCI CTCAE v4.0 for 
non-hematological AEs.  Hematologic toxicity will be assessed by the IWCLL 2008 criteria for 
grading hematologic toxicity in CLL studies.  Verbatim description s of AEs will be coded using 
the current version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).   Adverse 
events that started from the date of the first dose of study drug up to 30 days after the date of the 
last dose of study drug are considered treatment-emergent.  All -treatment emergent AEs will be 
summarized by treatment arm.  The incidence rates of treatment- emergent  AEs will be 
summarized by System Organ Class (SOC), preferred term, toxicity grade, and relationship to 
study drug.  In addition, SAEs, Grade 3 or above AEs, AE s leading to study treatment 
discontinuation, delay, reduction, or interruption , AEs leading to  death, and events of special 
interest will be summarized.  Multiple occurrence of the same event in a given patient  will be 
counted once at the maximum severity  and strongest relationship to study drug. 
AEs leading to death and non- fatal SAEs will be listed by patient  and tabulated by preferred term. 
12.9.2. Laboratory Evaluations 
All laboratory values will be converted to standard international ( SI) units and classified as 
normal, low, or high based on normal ranges supplied by the central laboratory.  Hematologic 
parameters including platelet count, hemoglobin, and neutrophils will be assessed by the IWCLL 
2008 criteria for grading hematologic toxicity in CLL studies.  All other gradable laboratory 
parameters will be graded using the NCI CTCAE v4.0.

a.      Based on PBPK simulations, up to 9.7-fold increase in AUC and 6.2 -fold increase in C max could be observed.  If ibrutinib needs to be 
administered with posaconazole, 140 mg ibrutinib will be dosed.  
b.      Based on internal data, 140 mg ibrutinib dosed with voriconazole produces ibrutinib exposures similar to 560 mg ibrutinib dosed alone. 
Therefore, for this study, if ibrutinib needs to be administered with voriconazole, 140 mg ibrutinib will be dosed.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 100 of 114 Appendix D: Hematologic Adverse Event Grading Scheme ( Hallek 2008) 
An evaluation of the hematologic toxicity in patient s with advanced CLL/SLL must consider the 
high frequency of marrow involvement and previous exposure to chemotherapy with consequent 
medullary compromise at the initiation of therapy.  The standard hematologic grading system for 
solid tumors cannot, therefore, be directly applied.  A substantial proportion of patient s would be 
considered to have Grade 2 to 4 hematologic toxicity before any therapy is given.  There fore, the 
following modified schema will be used to quantitate  hematologic deterioration in patient s with 
CLL/SLL.  
Hematologic Grading Scheme  
Decrease in Platelets or Hgb 
(Nadir) from Pre- treatment Value, 
% ANC/μL (nadir)c Toxicity Grade  
0 - 10%a ≥ 2000 0 
11 - 24%a,b ≥ 1500 and < 2000 1 
25 - 49%a,b ≥ 1000 and < 1500 2 
50 - 74%a,b ≥ 500 and < 1000 3 
> 75%a,b < 500 4 
a. If at any level of decrease, the platelet count falls below 20 × 109/L, toxicity will be considered Grade 4. 
If the baseline platelet count is <20 × 109/L, platelet toxicity cannot be evaluated.  
b. Baseline and subsequent Hgb values must be determined the day of any given transfusion.  
c. If the ANC was < 1000/µL  before therapy, the patient is not evaluable for toxicity referable to the ANC.

Pharmacyclics  LLC Proprietary and Confidential Page 107 of 114 Appendix H: Cumulative Illness Rating Scale  (CIRS)  
CIRS is an indicator of illness severity and comorbidity in older patients ( Extermann, 1998)1. 
CIRS scoring is to be performed in the setting of a pretreatment comprehensive history an d 
physical by a licensed provider (nurse, PA, MD, or DO) for all patients 65 years and older. 
Instructions:  
The following pages include the CIRS scoring worksheet displaying 14 organ- system categories. 
Write brief descriptions of the medical problem(s) that justified the endorsed score on the line 
following each item. Circle the appropriate score from 0 – 4 based on the rating strategy.  Space 
is provided in each system organ class to provide written descriptions. 
1. Complete each category score as identified by the rating strategy on the worksheet 
2. Each category has room for written comments. If ad ditional room is needed, please 
document on the back of the form 
3. Add the number of Total Categories Endorsed  (measured)  
4. Provide the Total Score  
5. Provide the Severity Index  (total score divided by total number of categories endorsed) 
6. Provide the number of categories at level 3 severity  
7. Provide the number of categories at level 4 severity  
CLL Rating:  
Please take into account that CLL/SLL diagnosis itself or induced illness or organ damage 
(including cytopenias) are not included in this rating scale.  The goal of this rating scale is to 
assess comorbidity other than CLL/SLL in the patient.

Class  Functional Capacity: How a patient with  cardiac disease feels during physical 
activity  
I Patients with  cardiac disease but  resulting in no limitation of physical activity. 
Ordinary physical activity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea or 
anginal pain. 
II Patients with cardiac disease resulting in slight limitation of physical activity.  They are comfortable at rest. Ordinary physical activity results in fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea or anginal pain. 
III Patients with cardiac disease resulting in marked limitation of physical activity. They are comfortable at rest. Less than ordinary activity causes fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea or anginal pain. 
IV Patients with cardiac disease resulting in inability to carry on any physical activity without discomfort. Symptoms of heart failure or the anginal syndrome may be present even at rest.   If any physical activity is undertaken, discomfort increases.  
Class  Objective Assessment  
A No objective evidence of cardiovascular disease. No symptoms and no limitation in ordinary physical activity. 
B Objective evidence of minimal cardiovascular disease. Mild symptoms and slight limitation during ordinary activity. Comfortable at rest.  
C Objective evidence of moderately severe cardiovascular disease. Marked limitation in activity due to symptoms, even during less- than-ordinary activity. Comfortable 
only at rest.  
D Objective evidence of severe cardiovascular disease. Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms eve n while at rest.

Chemoimmuno-
therapy For the purpose of this protocol, a combination treatment regimen that contains both a cytotoxic, specifically a purine analog or alkylating agent, chemotherapy agent and an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (eg, rituximab) administered together.  
Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA)  Defined by at least one marker of hemolysis (indirect bilirubin above the upper limit of normal (ULN) not due to liver disease, increased lactate dehydrogenase (above ULN) without alternative etiology, or increased absolute reticulocytosis (above ULN) or bone marrow erythropoiesis in 
the absence of bleeding) AND at least one marker of direct or indirect 
autoimmune mechanism (positive direct antiglobulin for IgG or C3d, cold agglutinins) ( Ding 2007).  
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP)  Immune thrombocytopenia is defined by platelets ≤100,000/µL and increased megakaryocytes o n the bone marrow exam. 
Autoimmune cytopenia poorly responsive to therapy Autoimmune anemia or thrombocytopenia poorly responsive to treatment includes those patients with recurrent autoimmune cytopenias, those receiving low dose steroids ( ≤ 20 mg of prednisone or equivalent) and 
those on intravenous immune globulin ( IVIG ).  Patients receiving higher 
doses of steroids or experiencing declining platelets or hemoglobin due to autoimmune destruction during the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug are considered for the purposes of this protocol to have uncontrolled autoimmune cytopenias (as defined below) and are not eligible for enrollment. 
Autoimmune cytopenia, uncontrolled Uncontrolled autoimmune anemia or thrombocytopenia is defined as those patients receiving > 20 mg prednisone (or equivalent) daily or have 
declining platelets or hemoglobin due to autoimmune destruction during the 4 weeks prior to the first dose of study drug.

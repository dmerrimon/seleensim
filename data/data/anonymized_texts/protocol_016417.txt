12-456 Phase II Ziv -aflibercept/Carcinoid  
Jennifer Ang Chan, MD, MPH  
 
   
6 1. OBJECTIVES : 
 
The overall objective of t his Phase II study is to assess  the potential antitumor activity of Ziv -aflibercept  
in patients with advanced, progressive carcinoid tumors.  
 1.1 Study Desig n 
 This is a single arm, Phase II trial with estimated sample size of 43 patients.  P atients with  progressive,  
metastatic carcinoid tumors  will receive Ziv -aflibercept  (VEGF Trap) administered  intravenously every 
two weeks .  All pati ents will concurrently receive octreotide. Patients will be followed for evidence of 
toxicity and response, with imaging studies performed every 12 weeks.  
 
1.2 Primary Objective  
 
• To evaluate the progression- free survival (PFS) duration of patients with metastatic, unresectable, 
progressive carcinoid tumors treated with Ziv -aflibercept . 
 
 
1.3 Secondary Objectives 
 
• To determine the safety and tolerability of Ziv -aflibercept  in patients with advanced carcinoid 
tumors 
 
• To evaluate disease response (Partial Response [PR], Complete Response [CR], Stable disease 
[SD] ), using RECIST criteria , version 1.1 of patients with advanced carcinoid tumors treated with 
Ziv-aflibercept  
 
• To evaluate  biochemical response, using  levels of chromogranin -A and urinary 5- HIAA 
measured at baseline and following treatment with Ziv -aflibercept  
 
 
2. BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Study Agent:  Ziv-aflibercept  
 
Ziv-aflibercept  is also referred to as “ VEGF T rap”.  Ziv -aflibercept  is a recombinant fusion protein 
consisting of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor extracellular domains fused to 
the Fc portion of human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1).   Ziv -aflibercept  contains portions of the 
extracellular domains of 2 different vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFRs): VEGFR1 (also known as Flt-1) and VEGFR2 (also known as KDR or Flk-1). Ziv-aflibercept  drug product is 
formulated as a ster ile liquid for intravenous administration. 
   Ziv-aflibercept  binds VEGF in the picomolar (pmol/L) range, and also binds placental growth factor 
(PlGF), although with lower affinity. The affinity constants (Kd) for binding to 2 human isoforms of VEGF, VEGF165 and VEGF121, are 0.50 pmol/L and 0.36 pmol/L, respectivel y. The Kd for  human 
PlGF2 is 39 pmol/L. The binding of Ziv -aflibercept  to its ligands in vivo is expected to block tumor 
angiogenesis and vascular permeability.  
12-456 Phase II Ziv -aflibercept/Carcinoid  
Jennifer Ang Chan, MD, MPH  
 
   
7  
Ziv-aflibercept  has been found to be active with a broad pharmacological index against early and 
advanced stage disease in a variety of preclinical solid tumor models including sarcomas, and ovarian, 
prostate, mammary, colon, and gastric carcinomas when used as a single agent or in  
combination with cytotoxic agents. In mouse models of ascites formation with ovarian and renal cell carcinoma, Ziv -aflibercept  inhibited ascites formation and reduced tumor burden.   
 
Two analytes were assayed in animal models specifically by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay 
(ELISA) methods: free Ziv-aflibercept  (compound not complexed to VEGF), and bound Ziv-aflibercept  
(complexed Ziv -aflibercept : VEGF [ratio 1/1]).    
 
Following IV administration in all animal species evaluated, free Ziv -aflibercept  was characterized by 
a low clearance (0.5 to 3 mL/hr/kg), a low volume of distribution (69 to 226 mL/kg), and a long apparent elimination half life (t1/2 ) of 48 to 98 hours. 
   Based on the correlation between exposure and activity in non- clinical models, the target  
 pharmacological exposure in humans is proposed to be a safely administered dose of Ziv -aflibercept  at 
which an excess of free Ziv-aflibercept  is sustained. 
 
The toxicity profile of Ziv -aflibercept  was evaluated in monkeys. The main compound- related  
microscopic findings were in the bone, nasal cavity, kidney, ovary, and adrenal gland. In the bone, Ziv -
aflibercept -induced effects consisted mainly of thickening of the growth plate and osteocartilaginous 
exostoses observed on the axial and appendicular skeleton that correlated with  hunched posture at clinical 
examination. In the nasal cavities, degeneration/regeneration of the respiratory and olfactory epithelium, 
and atrophy/loss of nasal septum and/or turbinates was often associated with hemorrhage and suppura tive 
exudate. Histopathologic findings in the kidneys (increased glomerular mesangial matrix) were associated in a few animals with decreased serum  total protein and albumin levels and increased serum blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN) and urine protein and/or micr oalbumin levels. In the ovaries, the decreased number of 
maturing follicles, granulose cells, and/or theca cells was associated with an overall inhibition of the female reproductive function. In the adrenals, a decreased vacuolation of adrenal zona fasciculata cells 
with cytoplasmic eosinophilia was observed. In addition, focal vascular proliferation/degeneration was 
noted in a range of organs, including in particular the digestive system, urinary bladder, heart, and brain of a few monkeys. In addition, inc reased liver enzyme levels were noted in a few monkeys with portal 
inflammation and necrosis. Ziv-aflibercept  administration also resulted in a decrease in  sperm motility 
and increased incidence of abnormal spermatozoa morphology. Most Ziv -aflibercept -related findings 
were noted from the lowest doses tested (1.5 to 3 mg/kg/administration). With the exception of 
osteocartilaginous exostoses and nasal cavity  findings, Ziv-aflibercept -related findings were reversible 
within 5 months after treatment cessation. In  sexually immature monkeys treated for 3 months, the main 
compound- related findings were comparable to those in sexually mature monkeys. 
 
Ziv-aflibercept  was shown to induce a moderately delay in wound repair and healing from 
0.3 mg/kg/administration after IV administration in rabbits.     When administered IV to pregnant rabbits 
(as a 30 minute infusion once daily, on gestation Days 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 - a total of 5 administrations) 
Ziv-aflibercept  induced minimal to moderate  maternal toxicity, abor tion, and embryolethality at 60 
mg/kg/administration. External, visceral,and/or skeletal malformations were observed in fetuses from 
pregnant rabbits treated from 3 mg/kg/administration (approximately 1.3 times the exposure in patients 
treated at the  recom mended human dose).   
 
12-456 Phase II Ziv -aflibercept/Carcinoid  
Jennifer Ang Chan, MD, MPH  
 
   
8 To date, Ziv -aflibercept  has been administered to approximately 2000 patients with advanced solid 
malignancies in clinical oncology trials, to 76 healthy subjects, and to 41 ophthalmology patients.  Doses 
have been administered up to 800 μg/kg subcutaneously (SC) twice weekly, 7 mg/kg IV  every 2 weeks, 
and 9 mg/kg IV every 3 weeks.   
Target pharmacological exposure has been reached at doses ≥2 mg/kg IV given every 2 weeks.  Free 
Ziv-aflibercept  levels have remained in excess of bound Ziv-aflibercept  levels throughout the dosing 
intervals at this, or higher, doses. Objective tumor responses and prolonged (>1year) disease  stabilization 
have been reported at dose levels ≥800 μg/kg SC and ≥1 mg/kg IV with Ziv -aflibercept  monotherapy and 
with Ziv -aflibercept  administered in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
  
Phase 1 studies, as both single agent and combination chemotherapy, are ongoing. Phase 2 
studies of Ziv-aflibercept , either alone or in combination with standard cytotoxic agents, are ongoingin a 
variety of oncologic indications. Phase 3 combination studies are ongoing in the following 
indications: lung cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer.  On August 3, 2012, the 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA ) approved Ziv-aflibercept in combination with FOLFIRI for 
the treatment of patients with refractory colorectal cancer (foll owing progression or resistance to an 
oxaliplatin based regimen). [20] 
 
 
2.2 Neuroendocrine Tumors  
 
      NET’s have been reported with increasing fre quency from years 1973 and 2004; recent estimates are 
that the incidence of NETs is 5.25 per 100,000 population.
1 Moreover, because these tumors may be more 
indolent than  other malignancies, the prevalence of patients diagnosed with NETs is estimated to be 
greater than 100,000 in the US.1  The majority of NETs are carcinoid tumors, which most commonly arise 
in the bronchi, small intestine, appendix, or rectum.2 Localized carcinoid tumors are treated with curative 
intent by surgical resection whenever possible.  However, curative surgery is o ften not possible due to the 
presence of metastatic disease at diagnosis.  The treatment of patients with advanced carcinoid tumors has 
been an area of intense investigation in recent years.2  
       The medical treatment of carcinoid tumors includes cytotoxic chemotherapy , biologic agents, and 
somatostatin analogs.  In the past decade , investigators have explored  a number of different cytotoxic 
chemotherapy regimens for this disease, with generally disappointing results.  Agents such as docetaxel, irinotecan, cisplatin, and gemcitabine have all failed to demonstrate significant tumor response.
3-5 In an 
Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Phase III study of chemotherapy in carc inoid tumors 
(E1281), patients were randomly assigned to treatment with 5-FU plus doxorubicin or 5-FU plus 
streptozocin.6 The median PFS was 4.5 months for the 5-FU plus doxorubicin arm and 5.3 months for the 
5-FU plus streptozocin arm.  Overall survival durations recorded in this trial were also suboptimal, at 15 
and 24 months respectively.    
     In the past year  however, the treatment of advanced neuroendocrine tumors has undergone a rapid 
evolution.  Initial phase II studies of sunitinib and everolimus suggested that these biologically targeted agents have antitumo r activity in patients with advanced neuroendocrine tumors.
7-9 In patients with 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, indepe ndent placebo -controlled randomized studies of the biologically 
targeted everolimus and sunitinib both revealed clear improvements in progression -free survival .10,11  
Based on the results of these studies, both everolimus and sunitinib were approved  by the FDA for the 
treatment of  advanced, progressive pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors in May, 2011.  A randomized phase 
III study of Octreotide with or without everolimus in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors 
12-456 Phase II Ziv -aflibercept/Carcinoid  
Jennifer Ang Chan, MD, MPH  
 
   
9 (RADIANT 2)  demonstrated an improvement in progression- free survival based on local investigat or 
review, however did not meet  its statistical endpoint which was based on central  radiology review (Pavel, 
Hainsworth, Baudin, et al ESMO congress, 2010). 
 
 
 2.3 VEGF Inhibition in Carcinoid Tumors  
 While no large randomized studies have been completed, several early phase studies suggest that VEGF 
pathway inhibition is a promising approach in treating patients with advanced carcinoid tumors. Sunitinib, Sorafenib, and pazopanib have been evaluated in 
advanced carcinoid tumors in the phase II setting.
7,12,13 
These drugs have been associated with low radiographic r esponse rates, 
but a relatively high rate of disease stabilization and 
potentially encouraging 
progression- free survival 
durations. These observations suggest that they may have a cytostatic 
effect that is under -appreciated when radiographic response is used as the primary efficacy endpoint.  
 
Bevacizumab has also been evaluated in a randomized phase II study of 44 patients with advanced or 
metastatic carcinoid tumors on a stable dose of octreotide. Patients were randomly assigned to 18 weeks of 
Bevacizumab or pegylated IFNa -2b, followed by treatment with both drugs.
14 During the first 18 weeks of 
therapy, four (18 percent) of the B evacizumab -treated patients experienced radiographic partial responses; 
furthermore, 95 percent of patients treated with octreotide plus Bevacizumab remained progression- free, 
compared with only 68 percent of those receiving octreotide plus IFNa -2b. Based on these results, SWOG 
is leading a large, randomized study of Bevacizumab versus interferon in patients with advanced carcinoid tumors (S0518).  
 
2.4 Role of  Octreotide in Carcinoid Tumors  
Octreotide is commonly used for the control of symptoms of hormonal hypersecretion in patients with 
advanced carcinoid tumors. Recent evidence also suggests that octreotide may slow tumor growth. In a 
recent study, 85 patients with metastatic midgut neuroendocrine tumors were randomized to receive either 
octreotide or pl acebo; the median TTP for patients receiving octreotide was 14.3 months as compared to 6 
months for patients receiving placebo.
15 Recent studies evaluating novel agents in ad vanced carcinoid 
tumors have required concurrent octreotide to avoid the potential for confounding.2  
 
2.5 Rationale 
           
     VEGF Trap ( Ziv-aflibercept ) is a recombinant protein consisting of the extracellular domains of VEGFR 
1 and 2 fused to the Fc portion of immunoglobulin G1. Ziv -aflibercept  compares favorably to other VEGF Phase II Studies of VEGF Pathway Inhibitors in Advanced  Carcinoid

10 inhibitors in preclinical studies, showing a high binding affinity for VEGF -A and other VEGF isoforms, as 
well as binding affinity for PlGF, which also contributes to angiogenesis.16 Phase II studies of Ziv-
aflibercept  have shown preliminary evidence of activity in patients with advanced glioma, urothelial cancer, 
and treatment resistant lung cancer, utilizing a standard dose of 4 mg/kg administered intravenously every 
2 weeks.17-19  
 
In light of preliminary evidence of activity associated with VEGF inhibitors in carcinoid, as well as the 
significant unmet clinic al need in this area, we propose a single-arm phase II study of Ziv -aflibercept in 
patients with advanced carcinoid tumors.  
 
Because prior studies of targeted agents have demonstrated low RECIST -defined tumor response rates 
in advanced carcinoid, we propose using PFS as a primary endpoint. The RADIANT 2 study will be used 
as the primary benchmark to assess median PFS durations that would be expected with an active targeted 
agent or with octreotide alone in this patient population (Pavel, Hainsworth, Baudin, et al ESMO congress, 
2010). E ntry criteria for our  study will closely parallel those used for the previously reported RADIANT 2 
study: patients  will be required to have low or intermediate grade tumors and evidence of disease 
progression within 12 months prior to study enrollment. C oncurrent treatment with octreotide will also be 
required.  
 
2.6 Study design  
Among the first 10 patients with advanced carcinoid tumors treated with Ziv -aflibercept at a 
dose of 4 mg/kg intravenously every 2 weeks, nine developed grade 3 or higher hypertension.  
The protocol has been modified to decrease the starting dose of aflibercept to 2 mg/kg intravenously every 2 wee ks for any patients enrolling after July 15, 2014.  Any patients enrolled 
prior to July 15, 2014 may continue dosing at their current tolerated dose level.

6.4 Management of hypertension: 
 
Hypertension is a common side effect experienced by patients receiving Ziv -aflibercept.   
 
12-456 Phase II Ziv -aflibercept/Carcinoid  
Jennifer Ang Chan, MD, MPH  
 
   
24 Due to the incidence of hypertension that has been observed in patients with carcinoid tumors 
treated with aflibercept, prophylactic antihypertensive therapy  with lisinopril 10 mg daily  
should be considered for patients with no contraindication to use of an ACE inhibitor.  If 
lisinopril is not started prophylactically,  initiation of another antihypertensive agent prior to 
treatment with aflibercept can be considered as clinically appropriate.    
 For patients already on antihypertensive medication, current therapy will be continued.    For all patients, blood pressure will be monitored closely at home and at a clinic visit on C1D3 (+/- 2 days) so that medications can be titrated as needed  to keep systolic BP < 140 and diastolic 
BP < 90 . 
 Blood pressure and dosing of aflibercept will be managed as follows:

Dose modification or delay will be based on clinically significant, study drug related toxicity as 
determined by treating investigator.  Toxicity will be graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. 
 For hematological toxicity , any dose modification or delay will be based on results obtained on day of 
treatment ( e.g., day 1 or 15 of each cycle).  
 For non- hematological toxicity , any dose modification or delay or will be based on the worst grade of the 
toxicity that occurred at any time, and is thought to be related to Ziv -aflibercept  and clinically significant. 
 
Once a dose has been attenuated  to dose level -1 (1 mg/kg) , there will be no re- escalation allowed.  If 
dose level -1 is not tolerated, the patient will be discontinued from study treatment .  For patients enrolled 
prior to July 15, 2014, reduction to dose level -2 (1 mg/kg) will be allowed.  Treatment with Ziv -
aflibercept  may be delayed for a maximum of 4 weeks.

7.2.1  DESCRIPTION  
            Octreotide is the acetate salt of a cyclic octapeptide.   It is a long -acting  octapeptide with 
pharmacologic propert ies mimicking those of the natural  hormone somatostatin. Octreotide is 
known chemically as L -Cysteinamide, Dphenylalanyl-L- cysteinyl -L-phenylalanyl-D-tryptophyl-
L-lysyl -L-threonyl-N- [2-hydroxy-1-(hydroxy- methyl) propyl] -, cyclic (2→7) -disulfide; [R -
(R*,R*) ]. 
 
Sandostatin LAR® depot (octreotide acetate for injectable suspension) is  
available in a vial containing the sterile drug product, which when mixed with 
diluent, becomes a suspension that is given as a monthly intragluteal injection.  
The octreotide is uniformly distributed within the microspheres which are made of a 
biodegradable glucose star polymer, D,L- lactic and glycolic acids copolymer.  
Sterile mannitol is added to the microspheres to improve suspendability.  
Octreotide LAR depot is available as sterile 5 mL vials in 3 strengths delivering  
10 mg, 20 mg or 30 mg octreotide free peptide. 
7.2.2 Formulation:  
Sandostatin LAR® depot (octreotide acetate for injectable suspension) is available in single use kits 
containing a 5 mL vial of 10 mg, 20 mg or 30 mg strength, a 2 mL vial of diluent, a 5 mL sterile plastic syringe, two sterile 1½” 19 gauge needles, and three alcohol  wipes. An instruction booklet 
for the preparation of drug suspension for injection is also included with each kit. Please see current Prescribing Information packaged with the Sandostatin LAR kit for additional information.  
 
Octreotide exerts pharmacologic actions similar to the natural hormone, somatostatin. It is an even more potent inhibitor of growth hormone, glucagon, and insulin than somatostatin. Like 
somatostatin, it also suppresses LH  response to GnRH, decreases splanchnic blood flow, and 
inhibits release of  serotonin, gastrin, vasoactive intestinal peptide, secretin, motilin, and 
pancreatic polypeptide. 
 
7.2.3 PHARMACOLOGY  
After a single IM injection of the long -acting depot dosage form  octreotide LAR depot in healthy 
volunteer subjects, the serum octreotide concentration reached a transient initial peak of about 
0.03 ng/mL/mg within 1 hour after administration progressively declining over the following 3 to 
5 days to a nadir of < 0.01 ng/mL/mg, then slowly increasing and reaching a plateau about two to 
three weeks post injection. Plateau concentrations were maintained over  a period of nearly 2-3 
weeks, showing dose proportional peak concentrations of about 0.07 ng/mL/mg. After about 6 weeks post injection, octreotide  concentration slowly decreased, to < 0.01 ng/mL/mg by weeks 
12 to 13, concomitant with the terminal degradation phase of the polymer matrix of the dosage 
form. The relative bioavailability of the long- acting release octreotide LAR depot compared to 
immediate -release Sandostatin® Injection sol ution given  subcutaneously was 60 - 63%. 
 
In patients with acromegaly, the octreotide concentrations after single doses of  10 mg, 20 mg, and 
30 mg octreotide LAR depot were dose proportional. The transient day 1 peak, amounting to 0.3 ng/mL, 0.8 ng/mL, and 1.3 ng/mL, respectively, was followed by plateau concentrations of 0.5 
12-456 Phase II Ziv -aflibercept/Carcinoid  
Jennifer Ang Chan, MD, MPH  
 
   
33 ng/mL, 1.3 ng/mL, and 2.0 ng/mL, respectively, achieved about 3 weeks post injection. These 
plateau concentrations were maintained for nearly two weeks.  Following multiple doses of 
octreotide LAR depot given every 4 weeks, steadystate octreotide serum concentrations were achieved after the third injection.  Concentrations were dose proportional and higher by a factor of 
approximately 1.6 to 2.0 compared to the concentrations after a single dose. The steady -state octreotide 
concentrations were 1.2 ng/mL and 2.1 ng/mL, respectively, at trough and 1.6 ng/mL and 2.6 
ng/mL, respectively, at peak with 20 mg and 30 mg octreotide LAR depot given every 4 weeks. 
No ac cumulation of octreotide beyond that expected from the overlapping release profiles 
occurred over a  
duration of up to 28 monthly injections of octreotide LAR depot. With the longacting depot 
formulation octreotide LAR depot administered IM every 4 weeks the peak -to-trough variation in 
octreotide concentrations ranged from 44 to 68%, compared to the 163 to 209% variation encountered with the daily subcutaneous t.i.d. regimen of Sandostatin® Injection solution. 
 In patients with carcinoid tumors, the mean octreotide concentrations after 6 doses of 10 mg, 20 mg, and 30 mg octreotide LAR depot administered by IM injection every four weeks were 1.2 
ng/mL, 2.5 ng/mL, and 4.2 ng/mL, respectively. Concentrations were dose proportional and 
steady -state 
concentrations were reached after two injections of 20 and 30 mg and after three injections of 10 mg. 
 Octreotide LAR depot has not been studied in patients with renal impairment.  
Octreotide LAR depot has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. 
7.2.4 Storage:  
For prolonged storage, octreotide LAR depot should be stored at refrigerated temperatures 2°C - 
8°C (36°F - 46°F) and protected from light until the time of use. Octreotide LAR depot drug 
product kit should remain at room temperature for 30 -60 minutes prior to preparation of the drug 
suspension.  
However, after preparation, the drug suspension must be administered immediately.

9. MEASUREMENT OF EFFECT   
 
Although response is not the primary endpoint of this trial, participants with measurable disease 
will be assessed by RECIST 1.1 criteria.  For the purposes of this study, participants should  be 
reevaluated prior to every 4th cycle .  
9.1 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors  
For the purposes of this study, participants should be re- evaluated  for response every after 3 
cycles of Ziv -aflibercept  (approximately 12 weeks).  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST  1.1). 
Definitions  
Evaluable for toxicity. All participants who receive at least one dose of study 
treatment  will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment.  
Evaluable for objective response . Response rates will be calculated based on an 
intent -to-treat analysis that includes all patients who have received at least one dose 
of study treatment.  P articipants  will have their response classified according to the 
definitions stated below.  
9.1.1 Disease Parameters  
Measurable disease . Measurable disease is the presence of at least one (1) lesion  
that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with longest diameter  > 20 
millimeters (mm) using conventional techniques (CT, MRI , x-ray) or  > 10 mm with 
spiral CT scan. Measurable lesions must be at least 2 times the slice thickness in mm. 
                                                 
10 Refer to Appendix B for specific collection/storage information 
11 Octreotide schedule may vary according to patient needs or treating investigator discretion.  Patients do not need to receive  Octreotide and Ziv -
aflibercept on the same day.  
12 Required through the first three cycles only.  Home blood pressure monitory after the 3rd cycle of aflibercept will be performed at 
investigator discretion.  
12-456 Phase II Ziv -aflibercept/Carcinoid  
Jennifer Ang Chan, MD, MPH  
 
   
36 All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters  (or decimal fractions of 
centimeters).  
 
 A lesion in a previously irradiated or embolized area is not eligible for 
measurable disease unless there is objective evidence of progression of the lesion 
prior to study enrollment. Lesions in previously irradiated areas must be clearly identified as such. 
  
Malignant lymph nodes . To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a 
lymph node must be > 15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice 
thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, 
only the short axis will be measured and followed. 
 
Non-measurable disease .  
 
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm 
or pathological lymph nodes with > 10 to < 15mm short axis , are considered non-
measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial 
effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses 
identified by physical exam that are not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques, and cystic lesions are all considered non -measurable.  
Target lesions .  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs, should be identified as target lesions and 
recorded and measured at baseline. Lesions must be accurately measured in 1 dimension wi th a minimum size of 10 mm by CT or MRI (slice thickness no greater 
than 5 mm), 20 mm by chest  x-ray. Nodes must have a short axis > 15 mm. The short 
axis should be included in the sum of the lesions in the calculation of response. 
Nodes that shrink to < 10 mm are considered normal. Target lesions should be 
selected on the basis of their size, be representative of all the involved organs, and 
should be lesions that can be followed with reproducible repeated measurements.  
Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable soft tissue 
components , that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or 
MRI can be considered target lesions if the soft tissue component  meets the definition of 
measurability as defined above. Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as target lesions. However, if non -cystic lesions are present, these are 
preferred for selection as target lesions. Lesions in previously irradiated areas or areas 
subject to other loco- regional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there 
has been demonstrated progression of that lesion.  
Non-target lesions.  
All other lesions, including small lesions < 10 mm or pathological lymph nodes measuring > 10 mm to < 15 mm in short axis, as well as truly non -measurable 
12-456 Phase II Ziv -aflibercept/Carcinoid  
Jennifer Ang Chan, MD, MPH  
 
   
37 lesions, which include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, 
inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal 
masses identified by physical exam that are not measurable by reproducible imaging 
techniques.  
9.1.2 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler, calipers, or digital measurement tool. All baseline evaluatio ns should be performed as closely as 
possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment.  
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging -based 
evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have 
been used to assess the anti -tumor effect of a treatment.  
Clinical lesions . Clinical lesions will only be considered  measurable when they are 
superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin 
lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended. 
Chest x -ray. Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they 
are clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung; however, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI. These techniques should be performed with cuts of 10 mm 
or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm 
contiguous reconstruction algorithm. This applies to tumors of the chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis. Head and neck tumors and those of extremities usually require specific 
protocols. 
Ultrasound (US).  When the primary endpoint of the study is objective response 
evaluation, US should not be used to measure tumor lesions. It is, however, a 
possible alternative to clinical measurements of superficial palpable lymph nodes, 
subcutaneous lesions, and thyroid nodul es. US might also be useful to confirm the 
complete disappearance of superficial lesions usually assessed by clinical 
examination. 
Tumor markers . Tumor bio markers such as chromogranin A or urinary 5HIAA, 
cannot be the only method used to assess response. If markers are initially above 
the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a subject to be considered in 
complete clinical response.  
Cytology, Histology . These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial 
responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in 
tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can 
remain).  
12-456 Phase II Ziv -aflibercept/Carcinoid  
Jennifer Ang Chan, MD, MPH  
 
   
38 The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or 
worsens during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or 
stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response or stable disease (an 
effusion may be a side effect of the treatment) and progressive disease.  
9.1.3  Response Criteria  
9.1.3.1  Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR) : Disappearance of all target lesions. Any 
pathological lymph node must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.  
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of 
target lesions, taking as reference  the baseline sum diameters.  
 Progressive Disease (PD):   At least a 20% in crease in the sum of the 
diameter s of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study with at least a 5 mm absolute increase in th e sum of all lesions. 
The appearance of one or more new lesions* denotes disease 
progression.   
 Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor 
sufficient increase to qualify for PD , taking as reference the smallest 
sum diameters while on study . 
Unknown (UN):  Assessment of target lesions cannot be made due to 
insufficient or unevaluable data. In this case, a concise explanation must be 
given. 
Note : If tumor response data is missing  for target lesions, the overall 
assessment must be UN unless there is new disease that would result in an overall assessment of PD. However, if there is missing or unevaluable data for 
non-target lesions, but data is available for all target lesions, the overall 
response for that time point will be assigned based on the sum LD of all target lesions. Additionally, the assessment of CR cannot be made if there is missing 
or unevaluable data for non- target lesions. In this case, the overall assessment 
would be PR. 
*Definition of New Lesion : The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not 
due to difference in scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to 
represent something other than tumor (ex: new bone lesions may be healing or flare of 
pre-existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow -up scan  in an anatomical 
location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because of small size, etc.), follow -up evaluation will clarify if 
it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared 
using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered.

39 9.1.3.2  Evaluation of Non- Target Lesions  
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all non -target lesions and  
normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph nodes must be non -
pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).  
Note:  If tumor markers are initially above the upper normal limit, they 
must normalize for a subject to be considered in complete clinical 
response.  
Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more 
non-target lesions and/or maintenance of tumor marker level above the 
normal limits.  
Progressive Disease (PD):  Appearance of one or more new lesions * 
(new lesions must be > slice thickness) and/or unequivocal progression 
of existing non- target lesions.  
Overall level of substantial worsening that merits discontinuation of 
therapy. A useful test that can be applied when assessing non -targets 
for unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall 
disease burden b ased on the change in non -measurable disease is 
comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be required to declare PD for measurable disease.  
Unknown (UN):  Assessment of non- target lesions cannot be made due to 
insufficient or unevaluable data. In t his case, a concise explanation must be 
given. 
*Definition of New Lesion : The finding of a new lesion should be unequivocal (i.e. not 
due to difference in scanning technique, imaging modality, or findings thought to 
represent something other than tumor (ex: new bone lesions may be healing or flare of pre-existing lesions). However, a lesion identified on a follow -up scan in an anatomical 
location that was not scanned at baseline is considered new and will indicate PD. If a new lesion is equivocal (because o f small size, etc.), follow- up evaluation will clarify if 
it truly represents new disease and if PD is confirmed, progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan on which the lesion was discovered.  
9.1.3.3  Evaluation of Best Overall Response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for 
progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment 
started). The participant's bes t response assignment will depend on the 
achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Note :   Participants with a global deterioration of health status requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease 
progression at that time should be reported as "symptomatic deterioration". 
Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 
9.1.4 Duration of Response  
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is measured from the time 
measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first 
date that recurrence or PD is objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
Duration of ov erall complete response: The duration of overall CR is measured from 
the time measurement criteria are first met for CR until the first date that recurrent 
disease is objectively documented. 
Duration of stable disease: Stable disease is measured from the s tart of the treatment 
until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
9.1.5 Progression -Free Survival  
Progression -Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration from date of registration to time of 
objective disease progression  per RECIST 1.1 criteria or death.  Patients who come off 
study without documented progression of disease (or clinical progression) will be 
12-456 Phase II Ziv -aflibercept/Carcinoid

41 followed and included in PFS analysis until documented progression, death from any 
cause, or initiation of a new anti cancer therapy.   
9.1.6 Response Review  
Tumor response will be evaluated at the study required time points by the DFHCC Tumormetrics 
Imaging Core (TIMC).  
 
10. ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
10.1 Definitions  
10.1.1  Adverse Event (AE)  
 
An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a 
pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship 
with the treatment.   
 
Abnormal laboratory values or diagnostic test results constitute adverse events only if 
they are determined to be of clinical significance or require treatment or further 
diagnostic tests.  
10.1.2  Serious adverse event (SAE) : 
 
A serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as any adverse event regardless of causality 
that:  
 
• Results in death  
 
• Is life -threatening. Life -threatening refers to an event in which the study 
participant was at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred, i.e., it 
does not include a reaction which had it occurred in a more severe form may 
have  caused death .  
 
• Requires or prolongs i npatient hospitalization (e.g., requires greater than 24-hour 
hospitalization or prolonged a hospitalization beyond the expected length of 
stay). Hospitalization admissions and/or surgical operations scheduled to occur 
during the study period, but planned prior to study entry are not considered SAEs 
if the illness or disease existed before the person was enrolled in the trial, 
provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected manner during the trial (e.g., 
surgery performed earlier than planned). 
 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability is defined as a 
substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. 
 
• Is a congen ital anomaly or birth defect 
 
12-456 Phase II Ziv -aflibercept/Carcinoid  
Jennifer Ang Chan, MD, MPH  
 
   
42 • Other  important medical event, as determined by the primary investigator . These 
events may not result in death or be life-threatening, or require hospitalization 
but may be considered to be SAE as they may  require medical  or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. Some examples of this type of event are:  allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an 
emergency room or at home; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the de velopment of drug dependency, drug abuse, or 
overdose with an associated serious event, or required intervention to prevent 
impairment/damage. 
 
Events not considered to be SAEs  are hospitalizations for:  
 
• routine treatment or monitoring of the studied indication, not associated with any 
deterioration in condition, or for elective procedures 
 
• elective or pre- planned treatment for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen 
 
• emergency outpatient treatment for an event not fulfilling the serious criteria 
outlined above and not resulting in inpatient admission 
 
• respite or palliative care 
 
10.1.3  Expectedness: 
 
AEs may be 'Expected' or 'Unexpected.'  
10.1.3.1  Expected AE:  
 
Expected adverse events are those that have been previously identified as 
resulting from administration of the agent. For the purposes of this study, an 
adverse event is considered expected when it appears in the known adverse 
event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package insert or is included in the 
informed consent document as a potential risk.    
 
Refer to Section 6.1 for a listing of expected adverse events associated with the study agents.  
10.1.3.2  Unexpected adverse event  
  
For the purposes of this study, an adverse event is considered unexpected when 
it varies in nature, intensity or frequency from information provided in the 
known adverse event list, the Investigator’s Brochure, the package inset , or the 
informed consent do cument as a potential risk.   
 
10.1.4  Attribution /Causality:  
 
12-456 Phase II Ziv -aflibercept/Carcinoid  
Jennifer Ang Chan, MD, MPH  
 
   
43 Causality is a determination of reasonable possibility that the drug may have caused or 
contributed to an AE.  It includes assessing temporal relationships 
dechallenge/rechallenge in formation, association (or lack of association) with u nderlying 
diseases and the presence (or absence) or a lack of one or more likely causes.  
 Attribution is the relationship between an AE  or SAE and the study treatment. The 
primary investigator w ill make final dete rmination of attribution/causality.  
 The primary investigator, sub- investigator or clinical research team will assign  as 
follows:  
• Definite – The AE is clearly related  to the study treatment. 
• Probable – The AE is likely related  to the study treatment.  
• Possible – The AE may be related  to the study treatment.  
• Unlikely - The AE is doubtfully related to the study treatment.  
• Unknown- Based on the evidence available, causality cannot be ascribed . 
10.2 Procedures for AE and SAE Recording and Reporting  
 
Participating investigators and clinical research team will assess the occurrence and attribution 
of AEs and SAEs at all of the required evaluation time points during the study.   All AEs and SAEs whether reported by the participant, discovered during questioning, directly 
observed, or detected by physical examination, laboratory test or other means, will be recorded 
in the participant’s medical record (source document) and on the appropriate study- specific 
case report forms.  
 The descriptions and grading scales found in the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 will be utilized for AE reporting. All appropriate treatment areas 
should have access to a copy of the CTCAE version 4.0. 
A copy of the CTCAE version 4.0 can be downloaded from the CTEP website at:  
  http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm
.  
10.3 Reporting R equirements  
 The study must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations, Institutional safety reporting 
requirements, and DF/HCC reporting requirements of the principal investigator.  
 
It is the responsibility of each participating investigator to report any serious adverse events to 
the primary study team and to the primary investigator,  Jennifer Chan, MD, MPH.

13. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
13.1 Study Design/Endpoints   
The primary endpoint of this phase II study is to assess the progression free survival (PFS)  of patients 
with advanced carcinoid tumors treated with Ziv -aflibercept . PFS is defined from the date of documented 
progression or death from any cause.  Patients who come off treatment without documented progressive 
disease will be followed and included in PFS analysis until documented progression, death from any cause, or the initiation of a new anti ca ncer therapy.   
 Recent studies of targeted agents in neuroendocrine tumors suggest that while many of these agent s are 
associated with low RECIST -defined response rates, they may be associated with significant pro gression 
free survival  (PFS) .  In the regi stration studies of sunitinib and everolimus in pancreatic neuroendocrine 
patients, PFS durations more than doubled, while overall response rates were only 9% and 4% 
respectively.
10,11 
 In this study of Ziv -aflibercept , we propose using PFS a s the primary outcome measure.   The RADIANT 
2 study provides a reasonab le estimate of PFS duration in a large cohort of carcinoid tumor patients 
treated with octreotide or o ctreotide plus an investigational agent  (Pavel, Hainsworth, Baudin, et al 
ESMO congress, 2010) .  RADIANT  2 randomized 429 patients with a history of symptoms attributed to 
carcinoid syndrome and evidence of radiographic progression within 12 months of enrollment to receive everolimus plus octreotide LAR depot, or a placebo plus octreotide LAR depot.  A significant PFS be nefit 
in favor of everolimus was demonstrated based on investigator radiology review ( 12 vs. 8.6 months, p < 
0.01).  However, the primary endpoint of the study was based on adjudicated central review, and while this analysis also favored the everolimus arm  over placebo, the predefined threshold for statistical 
significance was not met.    
 
Investigator review will be used  as the primary endpoint in the current study of Ziv -aflibercept  in 
advanced carcinoid  patients. Entry criteria will parallel those of the RADIANT 2 study, and will include a requirement for low or intermediate grade histology and for evidence of disease progression within 12 months of study entry. Concurrent treatment with octreotide will also be required.  We assume that an 
12-456 Phase II Ziv -aflibercept/Carcinoid  
Jennifer Ang Chan, MD, MPH  
 
   
50 inactive agent will be associated with PFS of 8 months, and that an agent worthy of further investigation 
will be associated with PFS of 12 months or greater.    
 
13.2 Sample Size/Accrual Rate  
 
A sample size of 43 participants achieves 80% power to detect the difference between null hypothesis median PFS of 8 months and the alternative hypothesis median PFS of 12 months at a 0.05 significance 
level (alpha) using a one- sided test. This sample size also allows 90% power to detect the same effect size 
with 10% type one error using a one-sided test. The length of follow up is 2 years. 
 
We expect an accrual rate of 1.5 patients per month.  
 
13.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints   
All patients treated with at least one dose of Ziv-aflibercept  will be included in this data.  
 
• Toxicity data , including laboratory values will be graded using CTCAE version 4.0.   
• Response criteria will be assessed using RECIST 1.1 criteria. 
• Values of chromogranin A and urinary 5HIAA will be analyzed for actual and/or r elative (%) 
change from baseline.  Correlat ion between changes from baseline may be explored graphically.  
The association of these markers and clinical outcomes of interest (e.g., time to progression) may 
be investigated.  
 
13.4 Reporting and Exclusions  
 
13.4.1  Evaluation of PFS.  Patients who come off treatment without documented progressive disease will be followed and included in PFS analysis until documented progression, death from any 
cause, or the initiation of a new anti cancer therapy.   
13.4.2  Evaluation of toxicity. All participants will be evaluable for to xicity after the administration of 
the first dose of Ziv -aflibercept . 
13.4.3  Evaluation of response.  All participants included in the study will be assessed for response to 
treatment .   Each participant will be assigned one of the following categories: 1) comple te 
response, 2) partial response, 3) stable disease, 4) progressive disease, 5) early death from 
malignant disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) early death because of other cause, or 9) 
unknown (not assessable, insufficient data). By arbitrary convention, category 9 usually 
designates the "unknown" status of any type of data in a clinical database.

CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
Consent for a dditional study blood samples will  be requested  in the informed consent 
document, but participation will be optional and eligible patients who do not consent to this 
portion of the study will still be able to proceed with s tudy treatment.  The purpose of 
obtaining these samples is to explore potential biomarkers that correlate with Ziv -aflibercept  
treatment outcomes. Samples will be analyzed after the completion of the clinical portion of this study in order to better unders tand biologic correlates of the clinical activity of Ziv -
aflibercept  in this population. The analysis will be performed at a laboratory designated by 
the principal investigator. All samples will be stored and labeled a ccording to directions 
below. All samples will be destroyed after a maximum of 10 years.  
The analysis of results will not be made available to the individual study participant or the treating physician; however, group results from this trial may be published when the final data is available.  
Study samples will be drawn by an experienced phlebotomist or a research nurse during the course of normally scheduled blood draws obtained as part of the treatment study.   Blood samples may be drawn either peripherally or via a central line. Each site wil l be responsible for 
ordering their own laboratory supplies and shipping materials for the specimens.  Shipping costs and supplies will be covered by the protocol budget.  Specimens will be stored at each DF/HCC site. 
Specific instructions for st udy blood samples are described below:  
Whole Blood Samples : 
A single tube of whole venous blood will be collected at baseline and will be stored for future studies of biomarkers that may prove useful at that time. Venous blood will be collected into one 6 ml purple- top EDTA tube. After collection of the sample, the tube 
should be gently inverted to ensure mixing with the anticoagulant.  Whole blood should be transferred from EDTA tube into labeled cryotubes and frozen at –20C.  
All cryovials will be labeled as follow s:  
1. Protocol Number: 12-456 
2. Unique subject identifier (initials of the patient and subject study #)  
3. Collection date  
4. Tube # (there should be approximately 2 cryovials; please note contents, i.e Whole Blood)

Jennifer Ang Chan, MD, MPH  
 
   
57  
Plasma Samples : 
Plasma samples will be drawn at  the following time points: 
• Prior to initiation of therapy  (may be done on C1D1 prior to administration of study 
drug)  
• Day 1 of each subsequent treatment cycle  
• End of study 
 
Approximately 5-7 ml of blood for plasma- based studies will be collec ted in EDTA  (purple top) 
tubes. Plasma samples should be processed by inverting the tube several times to assure 
complete mixing of anticoagulant (EDTA) and immediately centrifuged in a clinical centrifuge at 3,000 r.p.m. for 10 minutes at room temperature. Plasma should be aspirated without disturbing cells, aliquoted in 3 cryogenic vials, and frozen at –80C.   
 All cryovials will be labeled as follows:  
1. Protocol Number: 12-456 
2. Unique subject identifier (initials of patient and study subject #)  
3. Collection date  
4. Tube # (there should be 3 cryovials)/ please note contents (plasma)

12-456 : Home Blood Pressure Monitoring Diary and Instructions 
Name_____________________________   MRN#____________________________  
Cycle__________       Doctors office phone  number:___________________________  
Instructions:  
1. Blood Pressure  readings have two numbers.  The first number is the pressure in your blood vessels during a heart beat 
(systolic), and the second number is the pressure in the vessels when the heart rests in between beats (diastolic).  These 
numbers are written with a sl ash in between them ( for example, 110/85).  
 
2. Record the date, then r ecord your blood pressure ONCE daily  using a home blood pressure monitor.  Record your blood 
pressure at approximately the same time of day  (while you are relaxed and sitting and after you have rested for at least 5 
minutes).  If you take your blood pressure at other times of the day, please record under “Other readings”. 
 
3. A normal blood pressure is usually considered to be 120/80 mmHg.  If your systolic pressure is greater than 150 or your 
diastolic blood pressure is greater than 90  (150/90 or greater  →, try to relax, wait one hour, and recheck.  If  the second 
reading is greater than or equal to 150/90  please contact your doctor’s office for instructions .

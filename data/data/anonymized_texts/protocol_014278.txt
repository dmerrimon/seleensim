 viii PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:   A Clinic -Randomized Trial of a Clinical Decision Support 
System to Improve Dental Provider Delivery of Brief 
Tobacco Interventions and Quitline Referrals  
 
Précis: Use of clinical decision support (CDS) within electronic health 
record systems ( EHR) holds much potential to improve the 
translation of current scientific evidence into clinical practice and 
improve the delivery of optimal, evidence- based, personalized 
treatment. Health care providers have access to evidence-based guidelines that help patients quit smoking. Translation of that knowledge and awareness into daily practic e, however, 
remains low.   
This clinic -randomized trial will examine the rate at which dental 
providers deliver a smoking intervention and refer to a quitline when their EH R system includes health information technology 
(HIT)- driven CDS compared with providers in control clinics 
without assistance from the CDS. Providers include experienced dentists , dental therapists,  and dental hygienists in private 
practices and predoctoral and dental hygiene students in dental schools. The primary outcome is a binary var iable indicating 
whether the provider delivered a brief intervention or referral for treatment, as reported by the patient. Additional outcomes 
include patient self -reported actions toward quitting, smoking 
reduction, and smoking cessation. Provider -level barriers, 
facilitators, and potential mechanisms accounting for the effect of tobacco CDS  will be examined. Using EHRs to translate 
current evidence into dental practice holds much potential yet is 
unrealized in both clinical training and practice. By leveraging 
the dental encounter as an opportunity to deliver smoking 
cessation, we can further decrease smoking rates, leading to improved population health.  
 
Objectives:  Objective 1 (primary): Assess if the CDS increases the 
frequency of  BI (Brief Intervent ion) delivery  and/or RT (Referral 
to Treatment) at an index dental visit as compared to treatment 
as usual  as reported by patients within 7 days  of the index visit . 
  
Objective 2 (secondary) : Test the efficacy of the CDS on 
smokers’ initial actions related  to cessation (contacting a quitline 
and/or setting a quit date and/or developing a plan to quit and/or

Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 ix starting nicotine replacement or other medication to help quit 
within 7 days) as compared to treatment as usual.  
  
Objective 3 (secondary) : Test the efficacy of the CDS on 
smokers’ long term actions related to cessation (quitting 
smoking and/or reducing their smoking within  6 months) as 
compared to treatment as usual.  
 
Objective 4 (exploratory ): Identify provider -level barriers  and 
facilitators of the ef fect of the CDS, and test potential mediators  
and moderators of the CDS.  
 
Population:  • Practitioners.  Up to 88 dental hygienists and 88 dentists 
working in up to 22  private practice settings and 360  
predoctoral and 65 dental hygiene students in two dental 
schools will be recruited to the trial.  
• Patients . 720 adult  smokers  with routine dental visits in 
dental school settings  and 720 adult smokers with routine 
dental visits in private practice settings seen by 
practitioners enrolled in the trial are eligible for enrollment  
in order to achieve 430 completed surveys in each setting .  
 
Phase:  Phase 3 clinical trial  
Number of Sites:  This study will be conducted in up to 1 4 clinic modules within  
two dental school programs and 22 private practice clinics.   
The Sch ool of Dental Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh 
(Pitt) and the Indiana University School of Dentistry (Indiana) have been selected as study sites for this project based on their emphasis on teaching smoking interventions as part of their predoctoral  and dental hygiene (predoc/DH) curriculum.  
Up to 22 private- practice clinics having 1- 5 dentists and 1- 10 
hygienists will be engaged by recruiting volunteers convenience 
sampled from dentists and dental hygienists participating in the 
National Dental PBR N or otherwise recruited through existing 
relationships with HealthPartners, the University of Pittsburgh, and Indiana University .

 x Intervention:  CDS tool. The CDS tool generates  evidence -based, guideline -
driven provider script sets to assist in the delivery of cessation 
supp ort to smoking patients. A rule- based algorithm 
personalizes the scripts to account for patients ’ current smoking 
status and interest in quitting. A user -centered design approach 
underpins the CDS tool design that  is expected to be delivered 
in 2 - 5 minutes to remain feasible among the management of 
multiple priorities in the patient encounter. Provider training will be composed of two components: 1) Clinical practice guideline 
knowledge (intervention and control clinics) and 2) CDS functionality (intervention clinics only).  
Study Duration:  60 months  
Subject Participation Duration:  Patients  in dental schools and private practices:  7 months. 
Patient smokers wi ll be surveyed within one week of the index 
dental visit and 6  months +/-1 week after the dental visit to 
assess the delivery of tobacco cessation interventions during the dental visit and patient actions related to tobacco use.  
Dental students, dental hyg iene students, dentists, and 
hygienists:  21 months. Practitioners will be recruited for up to  15 
months . Upon randomization of respective clinics  or clinic 
modu les, providers  will render usual care in either the CDS -
supported intervention study arm or the control arm for 21 
months .  
Estimated Time to 
Complete 
Enrollment:  36 months. Initial communication, recruitment, and training of 
providers will occur on a rolling basis over 15 months . Practices 
will have 21 months to see up to 45 eligible and willing pa tients 
per clinic/clinic module , to complete the provider follow -up 
study , and to have the intervention in place in the clinic/clinic 
module setting long enough to plausibly see an effect .

Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 14 2 INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
Cigarette smoking is a major modifiable risk factor for adverse health outcomes and a 
major cause of morbidity and mortality ( 2). Cigarette smoking prevalence among all 
adults ≥18 years has decreased 42.4% since 1965, but declines in current smoking prevalence have slowed dramatically, from 20.9% in 2005 to 19.3% in 2010 ( 3). The 
Healthy People 2010  objective of reducing smoking among adults to ≤12% has not 
been achieved, necessitating new strategies to achieve that goal ( 4). One of the 3 key 
tobacco use objectives cited is focused on health system changes to increase access, affordability, and the use of smoking cessation services and treatments ( 5). The 
National Commission on Prevention Priorities ranking of clinical preventive services identified tobacco- use scree ning and brief intervention as one of the top 3 most cost -
effective preventive services delivered by health care providers, yet rates of delivery remain low ( 6). 
Evidence- based clinical practice guidelines on smoking cessation for health care 
providers are readily available to clinicians and recommend that different types of 
providers (i.e., physicians, nurses, dentists , psychologists, social workers, cessation 
counselors, and pharmacists) become involved in smoking cessation because, 
collectively, they can enhance abstinence rates (7). Despite this, providers are missing 
opportunities to treat smoking with their patients as recommended ( 8-10). Limited time 
during the office visit, lack of expertise, and concern about failure (provider self -efficacy) 
are often cited as barriers to providing consistent treatment ( 11). Similar barriers have 
been identified in the dental setting ( 12). Previous dissemination and implementation 
research suggests that simply delivering information to providers rarely changes clinical 
practice (13-16) and that “available knowledge is too rarely applied to improve the care 
experience” (17). Passive dissemination of materials, development of clinical guidelines, 
and knowledge generation through professional continuing education (CE) courses 
generally have not been effective in demonstrating an impact on provider behavior and 
clinical outcomes  (18-20). Thus, our approach directly activates the provider at the point 
of care by using HIT -driven CDS to generate scripts for provider use that are 
personalized on specific smoking attributes.  
State quitline services could serve a large percentage of US smokers, yet they are underutilized. Delivery of services is required in order for quitlines to fulfill their potential of improving the health of the US population ( 21). Increased referral by health care 
providers, including dental providers, may be part of the solution to full y harness this 
potential. Ebbert et al determined that dental providers with limited time and resources 
were able to assist patients who smoke by referring them to a tobacco quitline ( 22). 
Various strategies to increase smoking cessation activities in the dental office setting have been investigated ( 23-25) and have focus ed on the delivery of brief interventions 
and quitline referral .

Dental Provider Delivery of Brief Tobacco Interv entions and Quitline Referrals  Version 9.0 
Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 15 2.1 Rationale  
By leveraging the dental encounter as an opportunity to deliver a smoking cessation 
intervention, we will employ an important strategy to decrease smoking rates and improve populat ion health. This clinical trial will determine the degree to which the 
deployment of health information technology (HIT) -driven clinical decision support 
(CDS) for smoking interventions in two different dental settings, private practices and dental school,  will increase cessation assistance by dental providers. Incorporating 
smoking -cessation CDS into the clinical curriculum for dental providers (dentists and 
dental hygienists) can be expected to make smoking cessation counseling part of the accepted routin e of dental practice because dental providers initially model care the way 
they learned it in school ( 12, 45, 46). Health care providers have access to evidence-
based guidelines that help patients quit smoking ( 47, 48). Translation of that knowledge 
and awareness into daily practice, however, remains low ( 26, 49, 50). CDS that reminds 
and helps providers deliver smoking cessation interventions by providing evidence-based information during care delivery in a clinically relevant format holds the potential to facilitate an evidence- based practice approach ( 51). 
2.2 Potential Risks and Benefits  
2.2.1  Potential Risks  
Risks to both patients and providers  are considered minimal and involve consideration 
of the risk of violation of confidentiality of study data.  
Practitioners.  No identifying information on individual provider or student performance 
with respect to the clinical domains addressed in this study or any other  aspect of care 
gathered as part of this research project will be made available to leaders or managers who make academic, employment, compensation, or disciplinary decisions.  
Patients.  Potential risks to patients include the possibility that the intervention may 
provide clinical decision support (CDS) advice to providers on the basis of the national evidence- based guidelines, which may be inappropriate for a given individual patient 
and, if applied without further checking the clinical status of a given patient, could lead to erroneous therapy, adverse events, disability, or death. However, the clinical recommendations are evidence- based and operationalize current national and regional 
standards of care and, therefore, the risk of untoward consequences of such clinical actions is considered minimal. Moreover, this potential risk is routinely present in every clinical encounter in the health care system. A s with any study, additional risks to 
patients include principally the risk of violation of confidential ity. Measures to minimize 
these risks are also discussed below  including the use of unique study codes for 
participants, encryption of data for transmission to the Survey Research Center  (SRC), 
and compliance with Institutional Review Board (IRB) regulations concerning data collection, data analysis, and data storage and destruction . 
2.2.2  Potential Benefits  
No claim is made in communications with participating providers or patients  that they 
will derive any personal benefit from participating in this project , however study -

Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 16 associated provider actions that support patients efforts to quit or reduce tobacco is 
desired and anticipated. Providers will have no defined benefits from participating in this project. However, the CDS designed to encourage smoking cessation conversations in 
the dental setting may familiarize some providers with new information that can improve the clinical care they deliver in the present or the future. P atients will have no additional 
direct benefits from participating in this project.  
The proposed intervention will modify two existing EHRs to create recommendations for 
smoking cessation that dentists and dental hygienists can provide for their patients who smoke. Smoking has a major impact on health in general, but it also causes periodont al 
disease and oral cancer. We will examine if dental providers with this modified EHR will 
provide more smoking interventions than providers without such an EHR and assess 
the impact of these interventions on smoking cessation, smoking reduction, and quit  
attempts. Any reductions in smoking are likely to improve population health in the United States.

 17 3 OBJECTIVES  
3.1 Study Objectives 
Objective 1 (primary): Assess if the CDS increases the frequency of delivery of  BI (Brief 
Interventions) and/or RT (Referral to T reatment) at an index dental visit as compared to 
treatment as usual as reported by patients within 7 days of the index visit.  
  
Objective 2 (secondary) : Test the efficacy of the CDS on smokers’ initial actions related 
to cessation (contacting a quitline and/or setting a quit date and/or developing a plan to 
quit and/or starting nicotine replacement or other medication to help quit within 7 days) 
as compared to treatment as usual.  
  
Objective 3 (secondary) : Test the efficacy of the CDS on smokers’ long term  actions 
related to cessation (quitting smoking and/or reducing their smoking with 6 months) as compared to treatment as usual.  
  
Objective 4 (exploratory ): Identify provider -level barriers and facilitators of the effect of 
the CDS, and test potential mediators of the CDS.  
 
3.2 Study Outcome Measures  
The measurement of outcomes for the primary and secondary objectives  will be based 
on self -reported da ta from telephone surveys of dental patients  1-7 days following an 
index dental visit, and 6 months +/ - 1 week following the index dental visit . Endpoints 
from patients are based on patient reports about their first observed index visit (not 
subsequent visits), where an index visit is a new or established patient visit where an 
oral evaluation is conducted to deter mine changes in the patient’s medical and dental 
health status.  A detailed description of dependent variables for the primary and 
secondary objectives  is shown in Table 1.  
3.2.1  Primary  Objective  
 
Aim 1 -  Receipt of a brief smoking intervention or referral to a quitline (H1)  
(Objective 1) : The dependent variable for H1 (Objective 1) is a binary indicator of 
whether the patient reported that their provider 1) delivered a brief smoking intervention: 
the provider discussed a) developing a quit plan, or b) setting a quit date, or c) using medications to help patients quit or d) discussed strategies for quitting, or 2) referral to a 
quitline : a) provided information about how to contact a tobacco quitline, or b) arranged 
for the patient to be contacted by the tobacco q uit line,  for smoking cessation at the 
index dental visit. This composite variable is satisfied if the patient reports that any of

Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 18 the intervention activities or referral was delivered. This information is obtained from the 
phone survey of patients within 1 -7 days of their index dental visit.  
3.2.2  Secondary  Objectives  
 
Aim 2 –  Smoker’s cessation actions, within one week of visit (H2.1)  (Objective 2) : 
The dependent variable for H2.1 (Objective 2) is a binary indicator of whether the 
patient reported that they contacted a smoking cessation quitline, set a quit date,  
developed a plan to quit , or starting nicotine replacement or other medication to help 
quit. The CDS is designed to provide a more tailored and targeted message that may 
lead to more tobacco cessation actions by the smoker . This composite variable is 
satisfied if the patient reports that they have done any of these actions within the 1-7 
day period between the index dental visit and date of the first patient survey. This information is obtained from the  phone survey of patients within 1 -7 days of their index 
dental visit.  
Aim 2 -  Smoker’s cessation actions, six months after the visit (H2.2)  (Objective 3) : 
The dependent variable for H2.2 (Objective 3) is a binary indicator of whether the patient reported  that they quit smoking (stopped smoking for more than one day 
because they were trying to stop smoking), or reduced their smoking use (50% 
reduction in amount smoked at 6 months compared to baseline). This composite 
variable is satisfied if the patient reports that they have done any of these actions within the 6 month +/- 1 week period between the index dental visit and date of the second 
patient survey. This information is obtained from the phone survey of patients 6 months  
+/- 1 week  after the index dental visit.  
Aim 3 –  Barriers , facilitators  and mediators  of receipt of a brief smoking 
interventi on or referral to a quitline (H3.1, H3.2 ) (Objective 4):

 22 4 STUDY  DESIGN  
The pl anned study design (see Figure 1) is a group- randomized, controlled, 2- arm trial 
conducted in two settings: predoctoral dental schools and private- practice clinics 
participating in the National Dental PBRN. Fourteen modules (12  predoctoral dental 
school clinic modules , 2 dental hygiene clinic modules)  and 22 private practice clinics 
will be separately randomized using covariate -based constrained randomization. 
Balancing covariates to be used in each setting are specified in the Final Statistical 
Analysis Plan .  
Each set of dental school modules and s et of clinics will be randomly assigned to one of 
two study arms (CDS or control) using a statistician- prepared randomization table.  All 
consented providers and their patients will be allocated to the study arm to which their clinic is assigned. The participants  are dentists, dental therapists, dental hygienists, 
dental students, dental hygiene students, and patients.  
Intervention clinics will receive the CDS that  will provide clinical practice guideline-
supported, evidence- based,  and personalized scripts  that are tailored based on 
patients ’ self-reported smoking attributes to deliver interventions consistent with the 
standard of care. Control clinics will continue to provide usual care without CDS support. Both arms  receive a training video on how to incorporate the current tobacco 
cessation guideline. Intervention clinics will receive limited start -up training, 
demonstrating the technical functionality of the CDS.  Clinic modules do not overlap and 
there is no integration of dental hygiene student and dent al student care delivery.

Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 23 5 STUDY ENROLLMENT AND WITHDRAWAL  
5.1 Subject Inclusion Criteria  
Dental students and dental hygienists.  3rd and 4th year predoctoral students or 
dental hygiene students enrolled at selected dental schools . 
Private practice dentists and hygienists.  General practice dentists or dental 
hygienists practicing at selected private practice clinics  
Adult patients.  All consecutive adult s (≥ 18 years of age) not yet exposed to the CDS 
and seen in study -enrolled dental school  index visits  or study -enrolled private- practice 
index visits  during the clinic -specific implementation period who are current cigarette 
smokers will be eligible for the study.  
Survey -eligible:  A subset of patients are contacted by the central Survey Research 
Center w ho provide consent to complete the baseline  survey . 
5.2 Subject Exclusion Criteria  
Providers not able or willing to record  current tobacco use  status in their EHR are not 
eligible.  Private practice providers must not be affiliated with the engaged dental 
schools (Indiana University or University of Pittsburg h) in a teaching or clinical position.  
Patient exclusion criteria applied to the usual care post -index encounter telephone 
screening include: (a) patients requesting to opt out of research.  
5.3 Strategies for Recruitment  and Retention  
Recruitment and retention of providers:  Associated dental hygienists and dentists 
working in private practice settings , and predoctoral and dental hygiene students will be 
recruited to the trial using informational handouts and personal comm unication with 
study staff.  Private practice practitioners will be recruited through existing relationships 
of the National Dental PBRN  or the institutions involved in the project . Dental school 
students will be recruited through on- site information sessio ns conducted by non-
faculty . 
Dental schools:  The School of Dental Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh and the 
Indiana University School of Dentistry will recruit student participants through the dental 
school predoctoral and DH clinics. Information session s hosted by the appropriate 
project staff  will be held at each dental school. Information about the study will be 
presented at that time and any potential questions by students will be answered by 
study project management staff with no relationship to the students. Study staff with no 
academic relationship to student providers  will administer consent in accordance with 
IRB-approved site- specific procedures .  
Private practices:  The study team will recruit private practice clinics through 
relationships established in the National Dental PBRN and prior studies by the 
investigators at the academic institutions represented. Midwest Regional Coordinators

Dental Provider Delivery of Brief Tobacco Interv entions and Quitline Referrals  Version 9.0 
Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 24 who are jointly study staff have relationships with practitioners and can answer 
questions about the study  and about participation in research in general, and further 
support the involvement of interested practitioners. No additional National Dental PBRN resources will be used. Study staff can use administrative databases and Network enrollment questionnaire data to identify eligible private practice settings.   
Provider incentives:  Incentives will be provided to students  per policy  of the school . 
Private practice providers will receive incentives at  the completion of the study.   All 
providers will receive a fre e CE session with a web-based video course on the current  
US Department of Health and Human Services : Treating Tobacco Use and 
Dependence: 2008 Update—  Clinical Practice Guideline . 
Recruitment and retention of patients : We anticipate based on administrativ e data to 
achieve cumulative consecutive patient enrol lment across sites to total 1,440 in 8 or 
fewer months (site specific). P atients who have authorized  secondary disclosure of their 
information will be securely transferred to HealthPartners . Only study -eligible patients 
will be contacted by the SRC.  P atient contact data and  encounter details  will be 
reported daily using an EHR system routine (to be programmed by vendor ). 
To facilitate surveys, verbal consent will be obtained for patients contacted by phone  
within 7 days of their index visit . Consent and s urveys will be conducted centrally by 
SRC professional telephone interviewers  trained in human subjects’ protection, HIPAA 
for research and the Responsible Conduct of Research.  Patients will be called up to 
eight times at various times of day, including evenings, and days of the week, including Saturdays , to maximize recruitment  and opportunities for follow -up.  
Patient  participants will be provided an incentive after completion of the baseline and 6 -
mont h survey.  
5.4 Treatment Assignment Procedures  
Dental school predoctoral/dental hygiene clinics in Indiana and Pennsylvania, and 
private practice clinics will be randomized. All consented providers and their patients will be allocated to the study arm to which their clinic is assigned.  
5.4.1  Randomization Procedures   
Within  the predoctoral and dental hygiene clinics , clinic modules will be randomized to 
study arm using covariate- based constrained randomization. Balancing covariates will 
be specified in the final Stati stical Analysis Plan.  Private practice clinics  will be 
randomized to study arm using covariate- based constrained randomization. Balancing 
covariates will include factors that are measurable across all clinics in the recruitment 
pool. Clinic -level factors t o be considered include number of patient visits, number of 
smokers, percentage of patients who are smokers, percentage of patients with public -
pay insurance, percentage in specific age groups.  The final randomization plan and 
balancing covariates will be described in the final Statistical Analysis Plan.

Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 25 5.4.2  Masking Procedures  
Neither the CDS - nor the control -study arms in dental school and private practice clinics 
will be masked. Study staff will know which clinic assignment, and providers will know 
clinic as signment  due to the obvious presence or absence of  clinical decision support 
available within the EHR  at each clinic. Some protection from bias occurs due to 
patients not being aware that a study is occurring until they are contacted by research staff foll owing their index visit. Patients are not made aware of the study arm to which 
their clinic is assigned. However, provider knowledge of study arm could be relayed by providers during the dental visit.  The Survey Research Center interviewers conducting 
the evaluation interviews will be blind to the patient's clinic assignment.  
5.5 Subject Withdrawal  
Participants may withdraw voluntarily from the study or the investigator may terminate participation.  
5.5.1  Reasons for Withdrawal  
Subjects are free to withdraw from parti cipation in the study at any time upon request. 
Patients or providers may wish not to participate due to the perceived impact on their 
time or privacy. Incomplete surveys will be counted as withdrawals .  
5.5.2  Handling of Subject Withdrawals  or Subject Discontinuation of Study 
Intervention 
 Patient withdrawal . Within the parameters prescribed by the study protocol, study staff 
will provide support and encouragement to participants in order to minimize withdrawal and attrition during the intervention. Every effort  will be made to undertake protocol -
specified safety follow -up procedures and capture adverse events (AEs), serious 
adverse events (SAEs), and unanticipated problems (UPs).  
 Patients may elect to withdraw at any time with no impact on their relationship w ith their 
provider or the institutions involved on conducting the research. With respect for both 
patients and providers, refusal conversion will not be attempted. Respondents may actively or passively refuse to participate in the evaluation surveys . Activ e refusals will 
not be contacted again by the Survey Research Center. Passive refusals (i.e., a subset of non -responders) will only be contacted up to a maximum number of email (providers) 
or telephone (patient) attempts  (up to 8) to be respectful of parti cipants and within 
bounds of IRB approv al. Withdrawal of providers will be tracked in the provider 
database by the project manager. Withdrawal  of patients will be tracked by the SRC 
staff in the centralized study database.  
Withdrawn patients will not be re placed. In the case of patient withdrawal from the 
study, staff will only attempt continued follow -up data collection for patients who are 
withdrawn due to an unanticipated problem (UP). In those cases, only data related to the completion of reporting requirements for the UP will be recorded. Patients withdrawn from the study for any other reason will have the date and reason for withdrawal

patients withdrawn from the study may continue to receive normal clinical care as patients of the participating dentists, additional study data will not be collected from this continuing clinical care (except as noted above).  
Practitioner  withdrawal . 
Withdrawn private practices will be replaced with a suitable 
alternate clinic until the time of randomization ensuring covariate balance  remains intact.  
 
5.6 Premature Termination or Suspension of Study  
This study may be suspended or prematurely terminated if there is sufficient reasonable cause. W ritten notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination, 
will be provided by the suspending or terminating party. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the principal investigator will promptly inform the IRB and will provide the reason(s) for suspension or termination.  
Circumstances that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to:  
• Determination of unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to subjects.  
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements.  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable.  
• Determination of futility.

 27 6 STUDY INTERVENTION 
6.1 Study Behavioral or Social Intervention(s) Description  
A user -centered design of the CDS  tool is supported by prior multi -method approaches 
of the study  team which have explored tobacco cessation activities and EHR workflows 
among dentists and dental hygienists. Each patient -specific index visit for the study is 
defined as the first encounter during the clinic -specific implementation period when the 
enrol led provider updates that patient’s smoking status in the CDS application, cueing 
contact by the Survey Research Center (SRC). Additional subsequent dental visits may 
include additional CDS updates  by the provider , but these encounters do not result in 
additional SRC contacts until the 6 month patient survey .  
Prior research supports CDS that should not interrupt the providers’ usual approach to 
history taking. Thus a user -centered approach to activation of the CDS will allow for a  
seamless integration in to a variety of practitioner workflows (e.g., dental hygienists’ 
versus dentists’ workflow) and visit types . This integration will enable providers to 
engage the CDS whenever a tobacco cessation is relevant to the patient encounter. Our 
prior work has shown the merit of this  approach ( 64).  
Provider scripts and patient educational materials are based on the current clinical practice guideline endorsed by a consortium of eight Federal Government and nonprofit 
organizations, AHRQ’s evidence- based guidance mater ials for healthcare providers, 
and materials available to patients from http://smokefree.gov/. Script flow is based on the 5As model (As k, Advise, Assess, Assist, Arran ge). Supportive motivational 
intervention messaging is provided for patients not ready t o make a quit attempt now.  
6.2 Administration of Intervention  
The EHR vendors will modify their respective EHR products to integrate the CDS. After 
pilot testing , this modified EHR product will be installed in all study a nd control clinic 
environments and exposed to consented dental providers (dentists, dental students, 
dental hygiene students).  
In the context of the familiar EHR environment , provider s in the intervention arm will be 
exposed to the CDS. Assessment of the patients’ reported daily use, previous quit 
attempts, and interest in quitting drives a CDS rule -based algorithm that displays  
personalized scripts for that patient . Using the scripts as a jumping off point, the 
provider is free to adapt the messaging using best clinical judgment and according to 
patients’ individual needs and preferences as well as risk factors for oral disease (see 
Section 6.3 on observational monitoring of fidelity for details about evaluating 
standardization of the delivery of the scripts as intended per the clinical guideli ne). The 
provider selects scripts and patient resources that were “delivered.” Using this 
information, the tool creates an automated “smart note” to efficiently document the 
activities  for reference in guiding future encounters , as well as for compliance w ith 
record keeping requirements.

Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 28 6.3 Procedures for Training Interventionists and Monitoring the Quality of the 
Provider Behavior Measures  
 
Procedures for Training Interventionists Providers in private practices in both the 
intervention and control clinics wil l participate in a video- cast professional CE course 
(approximately 30 minutes) on how to implement the current tobacco cessation guideline, specifically in dental practice.  The two dental schools participating in this 
study place a high priority on compre hensive guideline -driven tobacco education. A ll 
students are exposed to tobacco cessation training in their curriculum,  however it 
occurs early in the didactic curriculum, so students will also view the video- cast thus 
standardizing , as much as is practical,  their most recent knowledge with practicing 
providers . All intervention clinics will receive basic training on the functionality of the 
CDS tool in the form of a video- cast and an interactive session with a project manager 
who has clinical training experience.  
 
Monitoring Provider Behavior Measures Utilizing Clinic Observations  
The outcome measure for O bjective 1 relies on patient reporting of the provider actions 
during the clinical encounter.  This measure has the potential for inaccurate recall by the 
patient.  To address this concern we will conduct observations  on a subset  of the clinical 
encounter s, recording the actions of the provider. These results will be compared to the 
patient reported results in order to determine the degree of recall bias.  The number of 
observations will be determined after assessing agreement of the two measurements.  
 
6.4 Assessment of Subject Compliance with Study Intervention  
The HPI data center will generate report ing tools  summarizing patient response rates. 
These reports w ill be provided to the study team and reviewed monthly to determine the 
need for additional training. This report will be reviewed monthly by the study team and 
by the Medical Monitor as needed.  
6.5 Study Procedural Intervention(s) Description 
A user -centered  design of the  CDS tool is supported by prior multi -method approaches 
of the study team ( 52) which have explored tobacco cessation activities and EHR 
workflows among dentists and dental hygienists. Based on this preliminary work and responses to a survey of National Dental PBRN members from across the US, the CDS will be designed to target specific index visits ( D0140. Limited oral evaluation; D0150. 
Comprehensive O ral Evaluation) when it is expected the dentist and/or  dental hygienist 
will routinely update the patient’s medical history and smoking status. In the intervention clinics the CDS will be activated when the tobacco status is updated. A flexible approach to accessing the tool will allow for adaptability to a variety of practitioner 
workflows and visit types and will enable providers to engage the CDS when relevant to the patient encounter.

Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 29 Provider scripts and patient educational materials are based on the current Clinical 
Practice Guideline  sponsored by a consortium of eight Federal Government and 
nonprofit organizations ( 55), AHRQ’s evidence -based guidance materials for healthcare 
providers (56), and materials available to patients from http://smokefree.gov/. Script flow 
is based on the 5As model (Ask, Advise, Assess , Assist, and Arrange). Supportive 
motivational intervention messaging ( 57) is provided for patients not ready to make a 
quit attempt now.  
Figure 1 of the  Visualization A ppendix (Appendix E) illustrates the three parts of the 
CDS as it appears within the providers’ EHRs. The provider asks a few tobacco questions about smoking status as part of a health history update that triggers the CDS. The interventions delivered by the provider are customized based on the smokers’ responses to baseline questions. The provider elects which personalized script s and 
patient resources to deliver in the patient encounter by checking the boxes provided. Using this information, the tool creates an automated “smart note” to efficiently document the activities and for use in follow -up during future encounters with the 
patient. This figure also illustrates the CDS functionality which generates unique script 
sets based on the patient’s smoking status  (i.e., reported daily use) , previous quit 
attempts, and interest in quitting.

 30 7 STUDY SCHEDULE  
7.1 Screening 
Providers:  To ensure students meet inclusion criteria, they will attend a lunch and learn 
session at whi ch time informed screening, recruitment, and consent procedures will be 
completed with study staff who do not have a relationship with the student s (e.g., no 
academic oversight) .  
Patients:  Providers will routinely assess patients for tobacco status . Patie nts who have 
authorized secondary disclosure of their information will be securely transferred to 
HealthPartners.  Only study -eligible patients will be contacted by the SRC.   
7.2 Enrollment/Baselin e 
Provider baseline enrollment: Providers in private practices  may be enrolled in 
dentist/ dental therapist/ dental hygienist , as appropriate,  since care is delivered as a 
team. Dental and dental hygiene students will be enrolled as individuals nested within clinic modules that are anticipated to be static for the duration of the study period. Upon enrollment, providers and student providers will be invited to complete the baseline survey.  
Patient baseline enrollment:  Study enrollment and all follow -up data are driven by the 
index visit. A system -generated, study specif ic-encounter ID will  ensure patients are 
only contacted at baseline one time, even if intermediate dental encounters occur and their tobacco status is updated again.  
7.3 Intermediate Visits  
Patient intermediate visits:  Not applicable. Patients may return for non-study related 
dental visits. These visits will not alter the timeline of the baseline or 6- month follow -up 
surveys  
Provider intermediate visits:  Not applicable. Providers are surveyed at baseline and 
after 6 months of study participation.  
7.4 Final Study V isit 
Patient final visits:  The final patient contact consists of the SRC -administered 6- month 
survey conducted by phone and tracked in the central REDCap  database.  
Provider final visits:  The final provider visit consists of the 6- month survey 
administered electronically and tracked in the central REDCap  database.  
7.5 Withdrawal  Visit  
Patient  withdrawal : Patients may  withdraw at any dental visit  within the study period.  
This will be relayed by the dental provider and tracked by the project manager or SRC 
staff such that follow -up is discontinued.  This option will be addressed with providers in

 31 training. Patients may  also withdraw while in contact with SRC staff . This will not affect 
nor be communicated to providers, practices , or schools.  
Practice withdrawal:  Up to 4 back -up private practices will be recruited to 
accommodate clinic -level withdrawal. Withdrawn private practices will be replaced with 
a suitable alternate clinic  to ensure clinic randomization remains intact.   
7.6 Unscheduled Visit  
No unscheduled intervention -related visits are anticipated. Unscheduled c ontact  may 
occur  with the study manager whose contact information will be provided (e.g., patients 
seeking clarification about incentive payment). This is common and typical in practice-
based research which takes a customer -service based approach to ensuring 
participants have comfort with and ease of accessibility to the researcher s.

 32 8 STUDY PROCEDURES /E VALUATIONS  
8.1 Study Procedures /Evaluations  
Patient Survey procedures: Patient contact data will be sent to the  HPI Survey 
Research Center  in keeping with  HIPPA authorization procedures and Data Use 
Agreements approved by the respective sites . In the period between 1 -7 days after the 
index dental visit, a baseline survey will be attempted with each patient.  Call at tempts 
continue until either a survey is completed or a patient indicates that they do not want to 
participate. The outcome disposition of each call attempt is recorded by the interviewer in the centralized study database to ensure accurate calculation of contact, response, 
cooperation and refusal rates. Upon successful contact with a patient, interviews will be conducted  with willing participants  in a standardized manner utilizing the IRB approved 
script and survey questions and responses. Refusal conversi on is not attempted. Any  
study -related patient questions are fielded using a study Frequently Asked Questions 
document. Survey responses are recorded by the interviewer in real -time in the 
centralized study database. Interviewers are monitored for script adherence, accuracy 
of data entry and study knowledge by SRC staff.  
Patients that complete a baseline survey become due for a follow -up survey six months 
after the index visit. In order to maximize response rates, the SRC will begin calling these patients one -week before the six -month mark. Up to eight call attempts will be 
made in the two- week window spanning the six -month mark. Call attempts, survey 
administration and documentation follow the same procedure as the baseline survey.  
Survey questions vary sli ghtly between the baseline and six -month surveys as indicated 
in the Survey Item Grid (Appendix K ). 
Interviews will be conducted in English and Spanish. The IRB approved script and questionnaire will be translated, back -translated and reconciled by a professional 
translation firm. Spanish- speaking trained telephone interviewers, employed by the 
SRC, will attempt survey completion with Spanish- speaking patients. All interviewers 
work onsite in a central location. In addition to completion of training in prac tices of 
standardized telephone interviewing for research, all interviewers are trained in HIPAA and the responsible conduct of research through CITI.  
Provider survey procedures:  Upon enrollment in the study, provider s will receive their 
baseline survey. P rivate practice providers will be asked to complete and return theirs 
by the completion of the training session.  Student providers will be invited to complete 
theirs in the lunch and learn session where the study is introduced. Survey responses will be col lected separately from any identifiers (e.g., provider ID) needed to connect 
provider data to clinic level data for the purposes of analysis. Six -month surveys  (90 
days -30/+90 days)  will be provided and collected confidentially by the project staff  at 
the respective sites.  HealthPartners project managers will deliver and obtain surveys 
from the private practice settings. Baseline and 6- month surveys will be marked with a 
common study ID.

 34 9 ASSESSMENT  OF SAFETY  
9.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
Safety monitoring for this study will focus on unanticipated problems involving risks to 
participants, including unanticipated problems that meet the definition of a serious adverse event (SAE).  Unanticipated Problems  
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following cri teria:  
(1) Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the IRB -
approved research protocol and informed consent document; and (b) the characteristics of the subject population being studied;  
(2) Related or possibly related to participation in the research (possibly related means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and  
(3) Suggests that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or recognized.  
9.1.1  Adverse Events  
An adverse event is any untoward or unfavorable medical occurrence in a human subject, including any abnormal sign (for example, abnormal physical exam or laboratory finding), symptom, or disease, temporally associated with the subject’s participation in the research, whether or not consider ed related to the subject’s 
participation in the research.  
9.1.2  Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is one that meets one or more of the following criteria:  
(1) Results in death 
(2) Is life -threatening (places the subject at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred)  
(3) Results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization (4) Results in a persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
(5) Results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
A Clinic -Rand omized Trial of a Clinic al Decision Support  System  to Improve  
Dental Provider Delivery of Brief Tobacco Interv entions and Quitline Referrals  Version 9.0 
Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 35 (6) An important medical event that may not result in death, be life threatening, or 
require hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, the event may jeopardize the patient and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
9.2 Time P eriod and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow -Up 
Unanticipated problems will be recorded in the data collection system throughout the study. The PI will record all reportable events with start dates occurring any time after informed consent is obtained until 7 (for non- serious AEs) or 30 days (for SAEs) after 
the last day of study participation. Since there are no routine research contacts with 
patients aside from the surveys after the index visit and 6 month surve y, we will train 
providers to solicit and record information about potential AEs. The study coordinator will solicit information from clinicians monthly through electronic communications.  
Events will be followed by the Study Coordinator for outcome information until the event has resolution or stabilization. Patients will also be referred to their dental or medical 
provider as appropriate for management and resolution.  
9.3 Characteristics of an Adverse Even t 
9.3.1  Relationship to S tudy Intervention 
All adverse events  will have their relationship to study intervention or study participation 
assessed  and documented in the patient  research record and will be included in 
summary reporting to the IRB and the Medical Monitor . Evaluation of relatedness will 
consider etiologi es such as natural history of the underlying disease, concurrent illness, 
concomitant therapy, study -related procedures, accidents, and other external factors. 
To assess relationship of an event to study intervention, the following guidelines are used for this study:  
1. Related (Possible, Probable, Definite)  
a. The event is known to occur with the study intervention.  
b. There is a temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset.  
c. The event abates when the intervention is discontinued.  
d. The event reappears upon a re- challenge with the intervention.  
2. Not Related (Unlikely, Not Related)  
a. There is no temporal relationship between the intervention and event onset.  
b. An alternate etiology has been established.

Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 36 9.3.2  Expectedness of SAEs  
The NIDCR Medical Monitor and the  Study PI s will be responsible for determining 
whether an SAE is expected or unexpected.  An adverse event will be considered 
unexpected if the nature, severity, or frequency of the event is not consistent with the risk information previously described for  the intervention.   
9.3.3  Severity of Event  
The following scale will be used to grade adverse events:  
1. Mild: no intervention required; no impact on activities of daily living (ADL)  
2. Moderate: minimal, local, or non- invasive intervention indicated; moderate impact on  
ADL 
3. Severe: significant symptoms requiring invasive intervention; subject seeks medical  
attention, needs major assistance with ADL.  
This will be recorded in the subject’s  research record and in summary reports of the 
study.  
9.4 Reporting Procedure s 
Incidents or events that meet the OHRP criteria for unanticipated problems require the creation and completion of an unanticipated problem report form. OHRP recommends that investigators include the following information when reporting an AE, or any other incident, experience, or outcome as an unanticipated problem to the IRB:  
(1) Appropriate identifying information for the research protocol, such as the title, investigator’s name, and the IRB project number.  
(2) A detailed description of the AE, incident, experience, or outcome.  
(3) An explanation of the basis for determining that the AE, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an unanticipated problem.  
(4) A description of any changes to the protocol or other corrective actions that have been tak en or are proposed in response  to the unanticipated problem.  
To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, unanticipated problems will be reported using the following timeline:  
(1) Unanticipated problems that are SAEs will be reported to the IRB and t o NIDCR 
within one week of the investigator becoming aware of the event.  
(2) Any other unanticipated problem will be reported to the IRB and to NIDCR within two weeks of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
(3) All unanticipated problems will be reported to appropriate institutional officials (as 
required by an institution’s written reporting procedures), the supporting agency head

 39 11 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
11.1 Primary Objective  
Aim 1: Assess the impact of tobacco CDS on the frequency of provider -delivered brief 
smoking interventions or referral to a quitline for smoking cessation treatment.  
Hypothesis 1.1  (Objective 1) : Smokers seen in dental clinics using CDS will be 
more likely to  report that their provider delivered a brief smoking intervention or 
referral to a quitline for smoking cessation at their index encounter than smokers 
seen in clinics without CDS.  
11.2 Secondary Objectives 
 
Aim 2: Assess the impact of tobacco CDS on smokers’ cessation and reduction actions.  
Hypothesis 2.1  (Objective 2) : Smokers seen in dental clinics using CDS will be 
more likely to report contacting a quitline, setting a quit date, developing a plan to 
quit or starting nicotine replacement or other medication to help quit within 7 days 
of their index encounter than smokers seen in clinics without CDS.  
Hypothesis 2.2  (Objective 3) : Smokers seen in dental clinics using CDS will be 
more likely to report quitting smoking, or reducing their smoking within 6 months 
of their index encounter than smokers seen in clinics without CDS.  
 
11.3 Sample Size Considerations  
Sample size justification for aim 1 Primary o bjective) : 
Dental schools : Based on data extracted from an administrative review of dental visits 
in 2013 in the two dental school settings, there are 2,800 visits by smokers (by an 
estimated 2,660 smokers) in a 12- month period in the 14  study dental clinics. A total of 
720 smokers will be approached to participate in the study over an  8-month recruitment 
period. Based on an expected 60% response rate to the 7 -day survey of smokers, it is 
anticipated that 430 patient surveys (215/study arm) will be completed. In our prior study (see section 1.1.2) found that 15- 20% of patients in control clinics reported 
receiving a brief smoking intervention in the dental clinic . The expectation for the 
endpoint for H1.1 (Objective 1) of receiving a smoking cessation intervention or quitline 
referral in this study is set at the lower end of that expectation at 15%.  The actual 
sample size of n=430 is reduced to an effective sample size of 230- 320 for the power 
analysis to reflect clinic -level ICCs for receiving a smoking intervention, which ranged 
from an ICC of 0.01 -0.025 for specific intervention endpoints in the prior CATI study. 
With a  sample of 430 patient surveys and a clinic -level ICC for the endpoint of 0.01-
0.025, this study will have 80% power (alpha=0.05, two- sided, R2 with other 
covariates=0.1) to detect a difference in the H1.1 (Objective 1) endpoint of 15% for patients in cont rol clinics compared to 29% -31% (reflecting ICC of 0.01 -0.025) for 
patients in CDS clinics (delta=14% -16%).

Dental Provider Delivery of Brief Tobacco Interv entions and Quitline Referrals  Version 9.0 
Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 40 Private practices : There are an estimated 1,475 visits by smokers (by an estimated 
1,328 smokers) in a 12 -month period in 16  randomly selected study private practice 
clinics, based on surveys of N ational Dental PBRN private practices. We will initially 
recruit 22 practices with the expectation that 20 will remain involved in the study . Patient 
and sample size calculations are based on 20 private prac tice clinics . A total of 720 
smokers will be approached to participate in the study over an  8-month recruitment 
period for each clinic . It is assumed that the 60% response rate to the 7 -day survey of 
smokers and ICCs for the endpoint will be the same in this setting as described above 
for dental schools at 0.01- 0.025. It is expected that a lower percentage of smokers in 
control clinics in this setting will report receiving a brief smoking intervention than in the control dental school setting described abov e, with an expected rate half that of the 
dental schools to arrive at 7% in control clinics. The actual sample size of n=430 is reduced to an effective sample size of 288-364 for the power analysis to reflect clinic -
level ICCs for receiving a smoking inter vention. With these assumptions,  this study will 
have 80% power (alpha=0.05, two- sided, R
2 with other covariates=0.1) to detect a 
difference in the H1.1 (Objective 1) endpoint of 7% for patients in control clinics compared to 17 %-19% for patients in CDS cl inics (delta=1 0%-12%).  
 
All power analysis was conducted with Pass v11( 58) with the goal of adequately 
powering the primary objective . An interim analysis is planned for review by the Medical 
Monitor if requested. This analysis will be descriptive and will not alter the course of the 
study. No adjustment is made to alpha for this interim analysis.  
 
11.4 Planned Interim Analyses (if ap plicable)  
11.4.1  Safety Review  
We do not expect any safety events because this is a minimal risk intervention. However, t he safety review plan will include quarterly reports of patient  accrual, 
enrollment, follow -up, and provider use of CDS.  
11.4.2  Efficacy Review  
One interim efficacy analysis on short -term outcomes in aims 1 (Objective 1) and 2 
(Objective 2) will be conducted when half of the baseline surveys  have been conducted. 
This analysis will be conducted for review by the Medical Monitor and will be descriptive 
(no statistical testing). There is no initial plan to stop the study early due to futility or exceptional efficacy. Because this is a minimal risk study, it is unlikely that there would be a rationale for stopping the study due to adverse events. However, the Medical 
Monitor  will ultimately make decisions regarding the need for stopping rules.  
11.5 Analysis Plan  
Overview. This group- randomized trial will randomize up to 1 4 dental school modules 
and up to 22 private dentistry practices to receive or not receive tobacco clinical 
decision support. All 1 4 dental school modules are selected for study from the two

Dental Provider Delivery of Brief Tobacco Interv entions and Quitline Referrals  Version 9.0 
Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 41 participating dental schools. A larger number (22) of private practice clinics are included 
to increase power and balance study arms on key characteristics,  both large concerns 
in a group- randomized design. Also, it is expected that only 20 of 22 clinics will remain 
in the study. Primary outcomes are obtained from patient surveys and consist of composites reflecting patient reports of actions taken by the dental provider and patient reports of their own actions regarding smoking cessation. Because of the numerous differences in the dental school and private practice settings and the interest in testing generalizability of the intervention in both settings, all  analyses are conducted 
separately within each setting. Sample size justifications and power calculations are estimated separately within setting to ensure adequate data within each setting to address the primary aims.  Sample size determinations are based on needs for the 
primary objective. Secondary objectives , secondary analyses, and subgroup analyses 
are exploratory and do not determine sample size calculations. A final Statistical 
Analysis Plan will provide detail on the specific fixed and random effect s to be included 
in each model, as well as relevant covariates.  
Analysis plan for aims 1 (Objective 1, primary ) and 2  (Objectives 2,3 , secondary ). 
Hypothesis 1.1 (Objective 1) posits that patients seen at clinics randomly assigned to the tobacco CDS interv ention will be more likely to report that their provider offered a 
brief smoking intervention or referral to a tobacco cessation quitline than patients seen at clinics with CDS. Hypothesis 2.1 (Objective 2) posits that patients seen at clinics randomly ass igned to the tobacco CDS intervention rather than control clinics will be 
more likely to report that they have engaged in short -term activities towards cessation of 
contacting a quitline , setting a quit date, starting nicotine replacement or other 
medicati ons to quit, or developing a quit plan. Hypothesis 2.2 (Objective 3) posits that 
patients seen at clinics randomly assigned to the tobacco CDS intervention will be more 
likely to report that they have engaged in cessation activities of quitting smoking  for one 
day or longer  or reducing smoking use. Because clinics are the unit of randomization 
and the outcome varies at the level of the patient, generalized linear mixed model regression with a logit link and binomial error distribution will be used to test t he effect of 
the intervention on the binary endpoints of Objectives, 1, 2, 3.  Adjustment for 
imbalances across intervention arms for relevant patient -level characteristics will be 
consideredThe analytic approach described above will be conducted separatel y in the 
dental school setting and the private practice setting.  
If the count of dental school modules or private practice clinics having completed patient surveys is fewer than 10, or if the mean number of completed patient surveys per randomized unit (dental school module or private practice clinic) is less than 15, an alternative primary analytic strategy will be conducted. This strategy will emphasize descriptive statistics and comparisons across clusters of within- cluster summaries 
rather than inferential tests of differences by study arm. Specifically, the count and proportion will be reported within each dental school module or private practice clinic for the Objective 1 endpoint: patient report that within 7 days their provider offered a brief smoki ng intervention or referral to a tobacco cessation quitline, Objective 2 endpoint: 
patient report within 7 days that they engaged in short -term activites towards cessation 
or contacted a quitline, and Objective 3 endpoint: patient report at 6 months that t hey 
have engaged in cessation activities of quitting smoking for one day or longer or

Dental Provider Delivery of Brief Tobacco Interv entions and Quitline Referrals  Version 9.0 
Protocol  16-069-E  12Jan2021  
 42 reducing smoking use. Proportions and exact (Clopper -Pearson) confidence intervals 
will be computed and plotted by clinic, grouped by study arm. Beyond the grouping or 
stratification of results by study arm, no other stratification or adjustment will be 
conducted.  
The inferential portion of the alternative analytic strategy will be made secondary due to concerns about biased standard errors (and resulting confidence inter vals and p- values) 
in cluster -randomized studies with a small count of clusters, or few members within 
each cluster (McNeish & Harring, 2017). However, the planned generalized linear mixed 
model regression described above will still be used to provide the estimate of the fixed 
intervention effect (Maas & Hox, 2005) for Objectives 1, 2, and 3. The standard error and p- value for the fixed intervention effect are likely more biased and will be reported 
but viewed with caution. Due to the small sample size and smaller number of events for Objectives 1, 2 and 3, no further covariate adjustment  will be considered in these 
models. The resulting generalized linear mixed models (logit link, binomial error distribution) will thus consist of a binary endpoint for the s pecific objective predicted by a 
fixed effect for study arm, and a random effect for dental school module or private practice clinic. The sample size in this alternative analytic strategy won’t allow for adjustment or imputation to address missing surveys or survey items.  
The analytic sample for Objectives 1 and 2 consists of patients who have completed 
constituent items for endpoint composites for Objectives 1 or 2 in the survey completed within 7 days of the index date. Study arm for each patient is base d on randomization of 
the linked dental school module or clinic at which the patient was seen. The analytic sample for Objective 3 consists of patients who have completed constituent items for endpoint composite used in Objective 3 in the survey completed at 6 months following 
the index date. Study arm for each patient is based on randomization of the linked 
dental school module or clinic at which the patient was seen.  
Handling of missing data in primary aims 1 (Objective 1) and 2  (Objectives 2, 3)  
Endpoints for aims 1 -3 (Objectives 1- 4) are binary indicators from patient surveys. Since 
the only patients consented for the study are those who complete a baseline  survey, it is 
expected that missing data for the endpoints for H1.1 (Objective 1) , H2. 1 (Objectiv e 2), 
H3.1  (Objective 4) , H3.2  (Objective 4)  will be rare. The endpoint for H2.2 (Objective 3) is 
binary and will be missing for the estimated 30% not completing the 6 month survey or 
those who leave the endpoint survey items blank. The approach for handli ng missing 
data will de pend on the expected mechanism of missingness. Approaches to be 
considered include conditioning the analysis on characteristic predictive of missing data, 
and multiple imputation (MI) procedures to accurately estimate parameters across 
multiply imputed data sets.

 44 13 QUALITY CONTROL AND Q UALITY  ASSURANCE  
Quality Management Plan:  The following is a summary of the quality management  
activities that are planned for each key study activity:  
Patient Sc reening and Enrollment:  
Proper screening relies on usual care clinical and administrative EHR  data. Follow -up 
training as need will be conducted for cause or at the request of the providers involved.  
See Protocol Section 6.10 for detail  on how this will b e assessed .  
Site project managers will be a resource for the EHR managers, vendors, providers and 
site staff to ask questions during the phases of patient screening and enrollment. The 
HPI project manager will keep a log of questions and issues encountered and solutions across sites. This will ensure consistency of solutions to problems encountered by providers. The Study Team will also use the log to create a regularly updated ‘Frequently Asked Questions’ document that will be available to all sites. Q uality 
assurance queries implemented  by the vendors and EHR managers to ensure quality 
data reaches the HPI data store will be developed in the pilot testing phases of the 
project.  Quality management  processes and periodic reporting will be continued until al l 
patient  and provider follow -up is complete.  
Data Collection:  
Metrics . All data will be reviewed for completeness  and entered electronically within the 
centralized study database, Accuracy and completeness of the data is maximized  
through alerts and pop -ups if the data is inconsistent or not entered.  
Protocol Deviations . All deviations from protocol will be captured, documented, 
reviewed and addressed on an ongoing basis to insure integrity of the data.  
Monitoring Quality Assurance. Co -Investigator leaders will regularly  meet with their 
site’s study staff to discuss study progress and problem  solve. The purpose of these 
meetings is to focus on the day -to-day operations of the project and to assure that all 
necessary tasks are completed in a timely fashion and strictly according to study 
protocol. Monthly meetings will include all co- investigators and will address scientific 
issues, including refinement of conceptual models, strategies to streamline and deploy the interventions efficiently and effectively, and strategies to maximize both recruitment and retention of study subjects, as well as methods to assure uniformity and fidelity to intervention protocols and data collection.  
In collaboration with the Survey Research Center and HPI programmer, the HPI project 
manager and study statistician will develop and provide to the study team and NIDCR regular reports related to subject accrual and data quality to assess the progress of the clinical study, any relevant safety data, and critical efficacy endpoints and provide recommendations to NIDCR.  
Data Analysis and Interpretation . All data analyses for presentations and publications 
will be verified by a “secondary” programmer/statistician for 1) validity of statistical

will be reviewed by the IRB  s at the respective involved sites. Approval of both the 
protocol and the consent form s must be obtained before any provider or patient is 
enrolled.  Any amendment to the protocol will require review and approval by the IRB 
before the changes are implemented in the study.   
14.3 Informed Consent Process  
Informed consent is  a process that is initiated prior to the individual agreeing to 
participate in the study and continues throughout study participation.  Extensive 
discussion of risks and possible benefits of study participation will be provided to providers and patients   
Providers : Consent forms will be mailed and/or emailed or presented in person to 
potentially eligible providers with contact information provided to allow the p rospective 
subjects  to ask questions. Signed provider consents will be obtained and stored by the  
site-specific project managers per local IRB requirements  as well as requirements by 
the funder . 
Patients: Verbal consent will be obtained for patients surveyed by phone by trained 
HealthPartners Survey Research Center staff . 
14.4 Exclusion of Women, Minoritie s, and Children (Special Populations)  
Racial and ethnic minorities will be included in the  study at least proportional  to the 
composition  in the sites’  patient populations . Individuals of any sex  or racial/ethnic 
group may participate.   Patients 18 years o f age  and older will be  included in this study.  
See the Planned Enrollment Table for estimates of the inclusion of racial and ethnic minorities across all sites.  
If needed, HealthPartners’ Survey Research Center can conduct surveys with monolingual Spanis h speakers. Other languages can be accommodated if the need 
justifies the expansion of Survey Research Center staff.  
Other minority groups and special populations are included in this study  unless a 
cognitive or communication disorder prevents completion o f the patient telephone 
consent and survey.

 47 14.5 Subject Confidentiality  
Figures 3 of the Visualization Appendix E shows the data flow of the CDS outlining the 
protective measures to secure patient and provider confidentiality based on a need- to-
know principle. Confidentiality will be ensured by assigning an arbitrary and unique 
subject identification number to each participant. All electronic study data will be 
maintained in a computerized database residing on a username and pass word 
protected- access fileserve r to which only the researchers involved in the study will have 
access. Access privileges will be role- dependent . A crosswalk table linking this code 
number to a provider and a patient medical record number will be destroyed within 12 months after completi on of analyses needed to test study hypotheses. The documented 
informed consent procedure for providers and student providers will be reviewed in advance, approved, and monitored on an ongoing basis by the 3 participating IRBs. All 
study related paper documents containing individually identifiable information will be maintained in locked file cabinets within the respective sites secure physically secured research offices.  
All recruitment will be conducted in compliance with applicable federal and state laws . 
Recruitment processes and materials will be approved by each institution’s Institutional Review Board (IRB). Each site will oversee the participant protections at each site, which will include compliance with HIPAA regulat ions.  
14.6 Future Use of Identifiabl e Data  
No protected health information (PHI) data will be included in the analytical dataset. 
Data will be stored within a secure folder on the research server with limited access to project team members for the required timeframe. This study does not involve 
specimens or genetic testing.

 48 15 DATA HANDLING  AND RECORD KEEPING  
15.1 Data Management Responsibilities  
The investigators in the study will be responsible for ensuring the accuracy, 
completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
15.2 Data Capture Methods  
Data Collection. There are four main data instruments for the study: 1. The patient 
baseline telephone survey conducted 1-7 days after the index dental encounter, 2. The 
patient 6- month post -baseline telephone survey, 3. The provider survey conduc ted both 
pre- and post -implementation, and 4. The instrument used to monitor general 
adherence to the use of the CDS tool as intended.  
Screening.  Demographic and tobacco status information verified at the time of the 
encounter will be used  for determining  patient eligibility  
CDS Data. Tobacco assessment details and documentation of use of SBIRT scripts and 
patient resources used  by providers  will be collected electronically at the point of care 
through a secure web application.  
Data collection and accurate documentation will be the responsibility of all study staff under the supervision of Dr. Brad Rindal and Dr. Heiko Spallek , the co -PIs. 
Unanticipated problems and adverse events will be reviewed by the investigator or designee.  
15.3 Types of Data 
All provide r- and patient -reported outcome measure data will be stored in the secure 
centralized study database.  
15.4 Schedule and Content of Reports  
Reports to monitor enrollment rate, adverse events, outcomes, and study conduct will be generated regularly using  the cen tralized study database and discussed at the site 
meetings, all -investigator meetings and r eported to the Medical Monitor and program 
official as requested .  
15.5 Study Records Retention  
Study records will be maintained for at least three years from the date that the grant federal financial report (FFR) is submitted to the NIH. No records will be destroyed without the written consent of the sponsor, if applicable. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
15.6 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical study protocol, Good Clinical Practice, or Manual of Procedures requirements. The noncompliance may be on the

 49 part of the subject, the investigator, or study staff. As a result of deviations, corrective 
actions that address the non- compliance issue have been developed by the study staff 
and will be implemented promptly. These practices are consistent with investigator and sponsor obligations in ICH E6:  
• Compliance with Protocol, Sections 4.5.1, 4.5.2, 4.5.3, and 4.5.4.  
• Quality Assurance and Quality Control, Section 5.1.1  
• Noncompliance, Sections 5.20.1 and 5.20.2.  
All deviations from the protocol will addressed in study subject source documents and promptly reported to NIDCR and the local IRB, according to their requirements.

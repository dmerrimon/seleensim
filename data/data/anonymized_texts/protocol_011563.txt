 2. SYNOPSIS  
Title of study:  A Phase 3, Randomized, Double -Blind, Pla cebo -Controlled Study to Assess the Efficacy, 
Safety, and Tolerability of Valbenazine for the Treatment of Chorea Associated with Huntington Disease  
Study number:  NBI-98854-HD3005 
Study site(s):  Approximately 55 study sites in the United States  and Canada . 
Primary Study Objectives:  
• Evaluate the efficacy of valbenazine to reduce chorea associated with Huntington disease (HD)  using 
the Unified Huntington ’s Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS) Total Maximal Chorea (TMC) score. 
Secondary Study Objectives:  
• Evaluate the efficacy of valbenazine to reduce chorea associated with HD using the Clinical Global 
Impression of Change (CGI -C), the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI -C), and the Quality of 
Life in Neurological Disorders ( Neuro -QoL) Upper Extremity Function Short Form and the Neuro -
QoL Lower Extremity Function Short Form . 
• Evaluate the safety and tolerability of valbenazine in subjects with HD.  
 
  
Study design:  This is a Phase 3, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, 
safety, and tolerability of valbenazine in subjects with HD.  The study includes a 4- week screening period, an 
8-week dose -adjustm ent period, a 4- week maintenance period, and a final study visit 2  weeks following the 
final dose of study drug.  Approximately 120 adult male and female subjects with motor manifest HD and a 
genetic diagnosis of HD will be enrolled . 
If individual in -person study visits at the study site  are not possible due to Corona Virus Disease 2019 
(COVID-19) related reasons (eg, subject is not able to travel to the site for safety reasons or as part of public 
health measures ), remote visits may b e conducted on a case-by- case basis at the judgment of the investigator 
and in consultation with the study medical monitor; once able, the subject is to return to in- person visits at the 
study site. Screening, baseline, and study visits at Weeks 10 and 12 must be performed at the study site ; subjects 
who plan on entering Study NBI -98854- HD3006 the sa me day as Study NBI-98854- HD3005 Week 14 must 
have Week 14 follow -up performed at the study site . 
Before subjects can provide informed consent, the investigator  (or designee) must determine whether the subject 
has the capacity to provide consent for study participation using the University of California, San Diego Brief 
Assessment of Capacity to Consent (UBACC).  Only subjects who are deemed to have the capacity to provide 
consent may sign the informed consent form (ICF).  All subjects must sign an ICF prior to the conduct of any 
study- related procedures.  Subjects will be screened for eligibility during a screening period, which will be up  to 
4 weeks  (28 days) prior to Day -1.  Screening visit must be performed at the study site .  Screening assessments 
may be repeated during the screening period if  approved by the Study Medical Monitor.  A subject who has 
been deemed a screen fail ure may be rescreened  if approved by the Study Medical Monitor; during rescreening, 
all procedures must be conducted with the exception of Cytosine Adenine Guanine repeat (provided the results are available from a prior screening period).  
Eligible subjects  will b e randomized 1:1 to either valbenazine or placebo treatment on Day - 1 (baseline).  Study 
drug will be administered in a blinded fashion throughout the 12- week treatment period beginning on Day 1.  
The baseline visit must be performed at the study site .  The maximum dose s during each week of the treatment 
period are shown in the table below.

a Doses reflect maximum daily doses during each week.  
During the
 dose -adjustment period, the investigator will increase a subject’s dose to the next dose level if, in the 
investigator’s opinion, the subject has tolerated the study drug at the current dose.  Doses will be adjusted in a 
blinded manner; subjects receiving placebo will undergo the dose -adjustment process but will continue to 
receive placebo.  Dose increases are allowed at visits at the end  of Weeks 2, 4, and 6.  If the subject has not 
tolerated the current dose, the investigator may decrease the subject’s dose at any time during the dose 
adjustment period (the 40 mg dose can be decreased to 20 mg) .  Doses are to be decreased 1 dose level at  a time 
and subjects may have multiple dose decreases during the dose -adjustment period; subjects who are unable to 
tolerate the 20 mg dose should remain in the study but study drug dosing will be discontinued.  Subjects who 
have had a dose decrease may re- escalate during the dose adjustment period if the investigator considers  that the 
dose increase would  be reasonably tolerated .  
During the maintenance period (beginning after the Week 8 visit through the end of Week 12), the subject’s 
dose will be maintained.  If the subject cannot tolerate the maintenance dose, the investigator may reduce the 
subject’s dose a single time by 1 dose level  (unless the subject is receiving 20 mg) ; if the subject cannot tolerate 
the lower dose, he/she should remain in the study but study drug dosing will be discontinued.   Study visits  at 
Weeks  10 and 12 during the maintenance period must performed at the study site . 
During the dose -adjustment and maintenance periods, the investigator may assess that a dose level is not 
tolerated if a subject experiences an adverse event (AE) that is (1) deemed associated with the study drug, and 
(2) of either moderate or severe intensity, or a serious AE.
Follow- up assessments will be conducted at the end of Wee k 14 (2 weeks after the last dose of the study drug).   
Subjects who withdraw from the study should have an early termination visit, which has the same assessments 
as the Week 12 visit.  
If individual in -person study visits at the study site are not possible  due to COVID -19 related reasons, study 
visits during the dose adjustment period, the early termination visit, and Week 14 follow -up visit may be 
performed remotely  at the judgment of the investigator and in consultation with the study medical monitor.  
Study drug will be self -administered (in the presence of the subject’s caregiver, if applicable) once daily (qd)  
beginning on Day 1.  Study drug should be administered at approximately the same time each day during the 
study.  As much as possible, all study vi sits (including baseline and follow -up) should occur at approximately 
the same time to standardize the time of day for the assessment of efficacy, safety, and drug exposure.  Visits 
during the treatment period and the follow -up visit will have a window of ±3 days.  
An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will periodically review ongoing, unblinded 
clinical safety data to ensure the safety and well -being of the study subjects.  
Study population:  A total of approximately 120 male and female subjects, 18 to 75 years of age, inclusive, 
with genetically confirmed motor manifest HD  will be enrolled.  Of  the approximately 120 subjects enrolled in 
the main study, approximately 50 subjects will be enrolled in the exploratory substudy with wearable movement sensors.  
Duration of treatment and study participation:  The expected duration of study participation  for each subject 
is approximately 18 weeks, including up to 4 weeks  (28 days) of screening, a 12- week treatment period, and a 
follow- up visit 2 weeks after the final dose of study drug.  
Investigational product, dosage, and mode of administration:  Valbenazine will be supplied as orally 
administered capsules containing 20 or 40 mg of valbenazine (free base equivalents as the ditosylate salt).  
Subjects must swallow the capsules with approximately 4 ounces of water or other liquid, with or without food.  
The table below shows the doses and capsules that will be used in the study.

12 April 2021  Confidential  8 
 Other Assessment:  
• Anosognosia Scale (AS) . 
Statistical methods:  The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from screening /baseline  period baseline (the 
average of the screening and Day - 1 assessments) to maintenance (the average of the Week 10 and Week 12 
assessments) in the TMC  based on on- site assessments.  The primary analysis method for the TMC change from 
screening period baseline will be a mixed -effect model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis.  The valbenazine 
arm will be compared with the placebo arm using a 2- sided test with a 5% level of significance.  
Response based on the CGI -C and PGI -C scales defined as "much improved" or "very much improved" at 
Week  12 will be secondary efficacy endpoints.  The change from baseline (Day - 1) to Week 12 in the Neuro -
QoL Lower Extremity Function and the Neuro- QoL Upper Extremity Function scores  will also be secondary 
efficacy endpoint s.  All other efficacy endpoints will be exploratory.  
Pharmacokinetic and safety data will be summarized using descriptive statistics.

5. INTRODUCTION  
5.1. Background 
Huntington disease (HD) is a genetic progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized 
clinically by chorea, cognitive dysfunction, and psychiatric symptoms.  Pathologically, HD is associated with brain atrophy characterized by loss of striatal medium spiny neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons.  Neurochemically, alterations in dopamine function and neurotransmission is observed in HD patients, with increased dopamine neurotransmission observed with early stage HD symptoms manifesting as hyperkinetic abnormal involuntary movements.  Later stage motor symptoms are primarily hypokinetic in nature (Frank, 2014; Cepeda et al., 2014). 
Patients with HD typically have onset  of symptoms at approximately 30 to 50 years of age.  Five 
to 10% of cases are classified as juvenile onset, with patients becoming symptomatic before the 
age of 20.  The average lifespan after symptom onset is 15 to 20 years (Frank, 2014; Roos, 2010). 
One of the defining motor symptoms of HD is chorea, characterized as abnormal, abrupt, 
irregular, nonstereotyped movements (Thorley et al., 2018).  As HD progresses, chorea can 
increase in frequency and amplitude ( Carlozzi et al., 2016).  Chorea is also assoc iated with 
decreased quality of life (Carlozzi et al., 2016).  While there is no established treatment to delay onset or progression of HD, treatment of HD-associated chorea could benefit some patients through improved quality of life (Thorley et al., 2018). 
Valbenazine’s pharmacological activity is primarily derived from its highly selective and potent 
major metabolite, [+]-α -dihydrotetrabenazine ([+]-α -HTBZ ) (Grigoriadis et al., 2017 ).  
Valbenazine and [+] -α-HTBZ have relatively long half -lives of 15 to 22 hours, allowing for once 
daily dosing with consistent exposure to [+]-α -HTBZ, and more stable management of 
hyperkinetic movements.

 with the exception of Cytosine Adenine Guanine repeat (CAG; provided the results are available 
from a prior screening period).   
Eligible subjects  will b e randomized 1:1 to either valbenazine or placebo on Day -1 (baseline).  
Study drug will be administered in a blinded fashion throughout the 12-week  treatment period 
beginning on Day 1.  The maximum doses during each week of the treatment period are shown 
in Table 1.

a Doses reflect maximum daily doses during each week.  
During the dose-adjustment period, the investigator will increase a subject’s dose to the next dose level if, in the investigator’s opinion, the subject has tolerated the study drug at the current dose.  Doses will be adjusted in a blinded manner; subjects  receiving placebo will undergo the 
dose-adjustment process but will continue to receive placebo.  Dose increases are allowed at visits at the end of Weeks 2, 4, and 6.  If the subject has not tolerated the current dose, the investigator may decrease the subject’s dose at any time during the dose adjustment period  (the 
40 mg dose can be decreased to 20 mg).  Doses are to be decreased 1  dose level at a time and 
subjects may have multiple dose decreases during the dose-adjustment period; subjects who are unable to tolerate the 20 mg dose should remain in the study but study drug dosing will be 
discontinued.  Subjects who have had a dose decrease may re-escalate during the dose adjustment period if the investigator considers that the dose increase would be reasonably 
tolerated .   
During the maintenance period (beginning after the Week 8 visit through the end of Week 12), the subject’s dose will be maintained.  If the subject cannot tolerate the maintenance dose, the investigator may reduce the subject’s dose a single time by 1 dose level (unless the subject is receiving 20 mg); if the subject cannot tolerate the lower dose, he/she should remain in the stud y 
but study drug dosing will be discontinued.   
During the dose-adjustment and maintenance periods, the investigator may assess that a dose 
level is not tolerated if a subject experiences an adverse event (AE) that is (1) deemed associated 
with the study drug, and (2) of either moderate or severe intensity, or a serious AE. 
Follow-up assessments will be conducted at the end of Week 14 (2 weeks after the last dose of 
the study drug).  Subjects who withdraw from the study should have an early termination visit, which has the same assessments as the Week 12 visit.   
Study drug will be self- administered (in the presence of the subject’s caregiver, if applicable) 
once daily (qd) beginning on Day 1.  Study drug should be administered at approximately the same time each day during the study.  As much as possible, all study visits (including baseline and follow-up) should occur at approximately the same time to standardize the time of day for the assessment of efficacy, safety, and drug exposure.  Visits during the treatment period and the follow-up visit will have a window of ±3 days.

12 April 2021  Confidential  29 9.2. Screening and Baseline Assessments  
Screening and b aseline visits  must be performed at the study site . 
9.2.1. Cytosine Adenine Guanine R epeat  
A blood sample will be collected from subjects during screening to assess for CAG trinucleotide 
repeat expansion number in the HTT gene .  Blood will be collected in tubes containin g 
dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA  K2).  Instructions for processing samples 
will be provided by the central laboratory.  CAG repeat blood samples collected from subjects will be shipped to a central laboratory for analysis.  
Prior document ation of CAG repeat ≥37 from a validated laboratory is sufficient to confirm 
eligibility; however, a sample will still be collected at screening for all subjects to be assessed by the central laboratory.  
9.2.2. Genotyping  
A blood sample will be collected from randomized subjects for the analysis of  
.  Blood will be collected in tubes 
containing EDTA K
2.  Instructions for processing samples will be provided by the central 
laboratory.  Genotyping blood samples collected from subjects will be shipped to a central laboratory for analysis. 
9.2.3. Swallowing Disturbance Ques tionnaire 
The SDQ is a 15-item instrument that assesses subjects’ difficulty in swallowing  food on a scale 
from 0 (never) to 3 (very frequently).  The SDQ is a valid and reliable instrument to determine 
subjects’ ability to swallow ( Cohen and Manor, 2011).  The SDQ will be administered at 
screening to determine eligibility for the study.  
9.2.4. Clinical Rating Scale for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy  
Subjects who score ≥11 on the SDQ during screening and, in the investigator’s judgement, may still be eligible for participation , will be asked to complete item 13 on the CRS -PSP.  Dysphagia 
is rated from 0 (none) to 4 (requires artificial measures) after the subject drinks 30 to 50 mL of water (Golbe and Ohman -Strickland, 2007).  Subjects who score ≤2 will be eligible for the study.  
9.2.5. Montreal Cognitive Assessment  
The Montreal Cognitive Assessment ( MoC A) is a n instrument to determine cognitive abilities 
including:  orientation, short-term memory, executive function, language abilities, abstraction, animal naming, attention, and a clock -drawing test (Nasreddine et al., 2005).  The maximum 
score on the instrument is 30 points.  The MoCA will be administered on Day -1 (baseline). 
9.3. Efficacy Assessments  
If individual in-person study visits at the study site are not possible due to COVID-19 related reasons (eg, subject is not able to travel to the site for safety  reasons or as part of public health 
measures), remote visits may be conducted on a case-by- case basis at the judgment of the

return to in-person visits at the study site  (see Appendix A ).   
9.3.1. Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale  
The UHDRS is a tool developed by the Huntington Study Group (HSG) to assess the clini cal 
features and course of HD.  The UHDRS has undergone extensive reliability and validity testing and has been used as a major outcome measure in controlled clinical trials ( HSG, 1996).  The 
full UHDRS includes the following assessments:  motor, cognitive, behavioral, independence, function, and TFC.  The motor portion of the UHDRS consists of 15 items that measure the severity of the motor symptoms.  
The TMC is item 12 of the motor assessment and m easures the chorea in 7 different body parts 
including the face, oral-buccal-lingual region, trunk and each limb independently.  The maximum score is 28.  
The full UHDRS will be administered Day -1 (baseline) and Weeks 12 (or early termination) and 14.  The motor and behavior portions of the UHDRS will be administered at screening (including TFC), Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.  The motor only portion of the UHDRS will be video recorded at screening, Day -1 (baseline), and Weeks 10  and 12 (or early termination). 
The motor and cognition portions of the UHDRS will not be administered at COVID-19 related remote visits.  
9.3.1.1. Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale Administrator 
The UHDRS will be administered and scored by the investigator (or qualified designee).  If 
possible, the same person should administer the UHDRS for an individual subject at all timepoints.  
9.3.1.2. Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale Video Recording  
Subjects will be video recorded for the duration of the UHDRS motor section  according to 
standardized guidelines provided by NBI (or designee).  Video recordings will be uploaded to a secure, central server, and managed by a core laboratory.  Access to the dedicated central server 
will be limited and will require the user to provide a user identificatio n and password to access 
the secure server and the subject’s video recording.  
9.3.1.3. Blinded, Central Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale Motor Video Raters 
The UHDRS video recording files will be reviewed and scored by blinded, central UHDRS 
motor video r aters.  A triple-blind consensus scoring will be conducted by these raters according 
to scoring guidelines developed by NBI.  NBI (or designee) will provide the blinded central 
UHDRS motor video raters digital -secure access
 to the subjects’ randomized UHDR S video 
recording files for review and scor ing.  The central raters will score maximal chorea (0 to 4) on 
7 body regions (face, buccal-oral-lingual, trunk, right upper extremities, left upper extremities, right lower extremities, and left lower extremities ).  The central raters will be blinded to the 
subjects’ study visits and treatment assignments.  Two blinded, central raters will review each UHDRS video file from beginning to end and must agree on the T MC score.  The central 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -98854-HD3005 
Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  5 Final Version  
12 April 2021  Confidential  31 UHDRS video raters will review and score the UHDRS video recordings conducted at screening, 
Day -1 (baseline), and Weeks 10 and 12 (or early termination).  
9.3.2. Patient Global Impression of Change  
Subjects will evaluate the change in their chorea symptoms since initiation of study drug dosing 
by choosing one of 7 responses (very much improved, much improved, minimally improved, not changed, minimally worse, much worse, and very much worse) on the PGI-C.   
The PGI -C will be completed by subjects  at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), and 
14. 
9.3.3. Clinical Global Impression of Change  
The CGI -C, which is based on a 7-point scale (range:  1=very much improved to 7=very much 
worse), will be used to rate the overall global improvement of chorea since the initiation of study 
drug dosing.  This scale is a modification of a scale developed by the Psychopharmacology Research Branch of the National Institute of Mental Health to rate the subject’s overall improvement in clinical disorder and provides a global evaluation of improvement over time from the clinician’s perspective ( Guy, 1976). 
An investigator or qualified clinician designee (eg, psychologist or social worker) will rate the scale at the scheduled timepoints.  If possible, the same person s hould rate the CGI- C at all 
timepoints.  The CGI -C will be administered  at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), 
and 14. 
This assessment will not be conducted at  COVID-19 related remote visit s. 
9.3.4. Patient Global Impression of Severity  
The Patient G lobal Impression of Severity (PGI-S) scale will be used to assess overall severity of 
chorea on a 5-point scale (range:  1= none to 5=very severe).  The PGI -S will be assessed by the 
subject on Day -1 (baseline) and at Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), and 14. 
9.3.5. Clinical Global Impression of Severity  
The Clinical Global Impression of Severity (CGI -S) scale will be used to assess overall severity 
of chorea on a 7-point scale (range:  1=normal, not at all ill  to 7=among the most extremely ill  
patient).  The CGI -S will be assessed by the investigator on Day -1 (baseline) and at Weeks 2, 4, 
6, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), and 14. 
This assessment will not be conducted at  COVID-19 related remote visit s. 
9.3.6. Short Form 36 Health Survey  
The SF -36 is a 36-item, self -administered questionnaire.  It measures health on 8 dimensions:  
vitality, physical functioning, pain, general health perception, physical role limitations , 
emotional role functioning, social functioning, and mental health ( Brazier et al. , 1992).  The 
SF-36 has been shown to be a reliable and validated  instrument (Brazier et al., 1992).  Version 2 
of the SF-36 will be used in this study. 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -98854-HD3005 
Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  5 Final Version  
12 April 2021  Confidential  32 The SF -36 will be administered on Day -1 (baseline) and Week 12 (or early termination). 
This assessment  will not be conducted at  a COVID-19 related remote early termination visit.  
9.3.7. Quality of Life in Neurological Disorders  
The Neuro-QoL  is a collection of psychometrically sound, clinically relevant, health -related 
quality of life measurement tools for individuals with neurological conditions.  The Neuro-QoL  
has been demonstrated to be a reliable tool for assessing patient -reported physical functioning 
measures in subjects with HD ( Carlozzi et al., 2017 ).  The Lower Extremity Function Short Form 
and the Upper Extremity Function Short Form each comprise 8 ques tions about physical 
abilities, rated from 1 (unable to do) to 5 (without any difficulty). 
Both the Upper Extremity Function Short Form and the Lower Extremity Function Short Form 
will be administered on Day -1 (baseline), and Weeks 4, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), and 14.  
9.3.8. Huntington Disease Health Index  
The Huntington Disease Health Index (HD-HI) (Glidden et al., 2017) is a disease-specific patient 
reported outcome measure designed to evaluate patient disease burden in therapeutic trials.  The HD-HI comprises 13 subscales that measure 13 individual areas of HD patient health. Together, 
each of the subscales can be utilized to generate an estimate of a HD patient’s overall disease burden.  Each question in the instrument was selected based on its high relevance to the HD population, its ability to be consistently understood by patients and clinicians, its content validity, its face validity, and its potential responsiveness to measure therapeutic benefit of disease progression during clinical trials. 
This instrument is a questionnaire that is completed by the subject (with assistance, as 
necessary).  In standard use, the instrument is handed to a subject who is asked to read the 
directions and complete the instrument, using a pen, by checking the most app ropriate box next 
to each question.  
Upon completion of the HD-HI, 14 scores are generated: a subject receives a score for each of the 13 subscales and a total instrument score.  The total instrument score is a composite of the 
13 subscales.  The score for each subscale and the total instrument ranges from 0 to 100 with 100 representing the highest disease burden and a score of 0 representing no disease burden. 
The HD -HI will be administered on Day -1 (baseline) and Weeks 10 and 12 (or early 
termination).  
This assessment will not be conducted at  COVID-19 related remote visit s. 
9.3.9. EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels 
The EuroQol 5 Dimensions 5 Levels (EQ -5D-5L) is a general, single index measure for 
describing and valuing health (Herdman et al., 2011).  It defines health in terms of 5 dimensions:  
Mobility, Self-Care, Usual Activities, Pain/Discomfort, and Anxiety/Depression.  Each dimension has 5 levels:  no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems.  The subject indicates his/her health state by checking the box next to the most appropriate statement.  The scores for the 5 dimensions can be combined into a 5 -digit

9.5.4. Physical Examination Including Height and Weight 
The complete physical examination will consist of an assessment of general appearance, skin and mucosae, head, eyes, ears, nose, throat, neck (including thyroid), lymph nodes, chest/lungs, cardiovascular, abdomen, extremities, musculoskeletal, and neurological system.   
A complete physical examination including weight will be performed at screening, Day -1 (baseline) , and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 (or early termination), and 14.  Height will be measured at 
screening only.  Height and weight will be measured with subjects not wearing shoes. Physical examination including weight will not be performed at COVID-19 related  remote visits . 
9.5.5. Electrocardiogram  
A standard 12-lead  ECG will be recorded in triplicate (at least 1 minute apart and within 
approximately 15 minutes) after the subject has rested supine for at least 5 minutes.  The ECG 
parameters that will be assessed include heart rate, PR interval, QRS duration, QT interval, and QTcF (machine readings or calculated).  Additionally, the occurrence of de- and re-polarization and rhythm disorders or other abnormalities will be assessed.  If needed, the investigator may consult with a local or central cardiologist to assist in the interpretation of an  ECG.  Based on the 
review of these parameters, the investigator or designee will note if the ECG is Normal, Abnormal not Clinically Significant, or Abnormal Clinically Significant.  If the ECG is Abnormal Clinically Significant, the investigator or designee will provide a description of the abnormality recorded on the AE eCRF.   
The 12-lead ECG will be conducted at screening, Day -1 (baseline), and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), and 14. 
9.5.6. Clinical Laboratory Assessments 
All clinical laboratory assessments will be performed by a central laboratory  or at a local 
laboratory as needed .  In addition, a urine pregnancy test will be performed by the study site on 
Day -1 (baseline) to confirm subject eligibility.  The central laboratory will provide instructions 
and supplies before study initiation and instructions will be included in a laboratory manual.  The laboratory test battery will include routine and screening laboratory tests.  Fasting is not required for the clinical laboratory assessments.   Select  clinical laboratory assessments may be performed 
by a local lab  (for re-testing or if the subject is not able to come to  the study site); prior approval 
by the medical monitor is required . 
The following clinical safety laboratory assays will be performed:  
Hematology:   complete blood count including WBC count with differential, red blood cell 
(RBC) count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, and platelet count, mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), red cell distribution width (RDW), and mean platelet volume (MPV).

nitrogen, bicarbonate, creatinine, uric acid, albumin, alkaline phosphatase, lactate 
dehydrogenase, AST, ALT, GGT, creatine kinase, total bilirubin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, total protein, and glucose.  
Prolactin:   Serum prolactin samples will be shipped to a central laboratory for analysis.  Prolactin 
results will remain blinded to investigators, subjects, and sponsor until database lock.  The DSMB may review unblinded prolactin data during the course of the study. 
Urinalysis:   specific gravity, nitrite, ketones, protein, urobilinogen, glucose, bilirubin, leukocyte 
esterase, occult blood, and pH; microscopic examination of sediment will be performed only if the results of the urinalysis dipstick evaluation are positive for nitrite, protein, leukocyte esterase, or blood. 
The following additional laboratory tests will be performed:  
Serology:  Blood will be collected for HIV-Ab, HBsAg, and HCV-Ab and reflex PCR testing at 
screening. 
Urine Drug Screen:  The urine drug s creen will test for amphetamines, barbiturates, 
benzodiazepines, cocaine, phencyclidine, and opiates.  The urine drug screen will be collected at screening  by the study site and analyzed by a central laboratory . 
Pregnancy Test:  Pregnancy tests will be per formed throughout the study for female subjects of 
childbearing potential.  A serum (β -hCG) pregnancy test will be performed at screening  and 
urine pregnancy tests will be performed at subsequent visits . 
9.5.7. Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C-SSRS is a validated instrument to prospectively assess suicidal ideation and behavior (Posner et al., 2011).  There are versions of the questionnaire designed for use at screening (baseline/screening version) and at baseline and visits throughout the study (Since Last Visit version).  All versions of the C-SSRS include a series of screening questions related to suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior.  Subject responses of “yes” to one or more screening questions will prompt additional questions that evaluate frequency and intensity of suicidal ideation and/or behavior.  Subjects with any lifetime suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation of type 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) in the 3 months  before screening based on the C-SSRS should be 
excluded (see exclusion criterion  #10). 
The C -SSRS will be administered and scored by the investigator or qualified study site personnel 
at screening, Day -1 (baseline), and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), and 14. 
9.5.8. Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale 
The Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale ( BARS ) is a validated four -item scale to assess the presence 
and severity of drug- induced akathisia ( Barnes, 1989).  This scale includes both objective items 
(eg, observed restlessness) and subjective items (eg, subjects ’ awareness of restlessness and 
related distress), together with a global assessment of akathisia.  Global assessment is made on a 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -98854-HD3005 
Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  5 Final Version  
12 April 2021  Confidential  37 scale of 0 to 5 (0=absent; 1=questionable; 2=mild akathisia; 3=moderate akathisia; 4=marked 
akathisia; 5=severe akathisia).   
The BARS will be administered on Day -1 (baseline) and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 (or early termination) . 
This assessment will not be conducted at COVID -19 related remote visits.  
9.5.9. Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale 
The HADS  is a commonly used instrument to determine the levels of anxiety and depression that 
a person is experiencing.  The HADS is a 14-item scale; 7 of the items relate to anxiety and 7 relate to depression ( Zigmond and Snaith, 1983).  Each item is answered on a 4-point  (0 to 3) 
response category so the possible scores range from 0 to 21 for anxiety and 0 to 21 for depression.  The HADS has been validated as a measure of depression and anxiety (Barczak  et al., 1988).  
The HADS will be administered at screening, Day -1 (baseline), and Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 (or early termination), and 14. 
9.5.10. Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale  
A subset of the UHDRS Motor Assessment (items rating retropulsion pull test, finger taps, 
pronate/supinate hands, rigidity-arms, and bradykinesia-body) will be used to assess for parkinsonism at each visit.  
This assessment will not be conducted at COVID -19 related remote visits.  
9.6. Other Assessment  
9.6.1. Anosognosia Scale 
The Anosognosia Scale (AS) is an instrument to screen f or anosognosia in daily practice and is 
specific for HD (Deckel and Morrison, 1996).  This scale requires subjects and investigators to rate the subject’s ability to perform tasks relative to individuals of the subject’s age and education on a five-point s cale, rating 8 items.  
The AS  will be completed  at the study site  by both the subject and the investigator (or designee) 
at Day -1 (baseline) and Weeks 12 (or early termination) and 14.  This assessment will not be performed at COVID-19 related remote visits. 
9.7. Specific Study Period Information 
After signing the ICF, subjects will undergo screening procedures within 4 weeks (28 days) of Day -1. 
If individual in-person study visits at the study site are not possible due to COVID-19 related 
reasons (eg, subject is not able to travel to the site for safety reasons or as part of public health measures), remote visits may be conducted on a case-by- case basis at the judgment of the 
investigator and in consultation with the study medical monitor; once able, the subject is to return to in-person visits at the study site  (see Appendix A ).  Screening, baseline, and study visits

including up to 4 weeks  (28 Days)  of screening, a 12-week treatment period, and a follow -up 
visit 2 weeks after the final dose of study drug. 
9.9. Prohibitions and Restrictions  
9.9.1. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
All prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications, including d ietary and herbal 
supplements, taken by subjects during the 30 days before screening and during the study will be entered on the Prior and Concomitant Medications eCRF. 
Medications that may prolong the QT interval:  valbenazine may prolong the QT interval.  
Caution should be used when valbenazine is coadministered with medications known to prolong 
the QT interval.  
Medications to treat medical conditions:  All coexistent diseases or conditions will be treated in accordance with prevailing medical practice.  Benzodiazepines and opiates must be at a stable dose (ie, no as -needed use) for 2 weeks before Day -1 (baseline).  Antidepressant therapy must 
be at a stable dose (ie, no prn use) for 8 weeks before Day -1 (baseline).  Investigators should document doses of current medication using medical or pharmacy records, confirmation with the 
subject’s caregivers (if applicable), or through reliable subject -reported information (eg, provide 
a list of medications and doses).  
Prohibited medications:  The following medications are prohibited from 30 days prior to Day -1 (baseline ) until the final study visit (or early termination) as described below  (unless 
otherwise stated) : 
• Antipsychotics or other dopamine receptor blockers:   antipsychotics (eg, risperidone, 
olanzapine, quetiapine, aripiprazole, ziprasidone,  chlorpromazine, haloperidol, fluphenazine, clozapine) and dopamine receptor blockers (eg, metoclopramide, domperidone) are 
prohibited.

12 April 2021  Confidential  47 9.10. Discontinuation of Study Drug and Subject Withdrawal  
Subjects can discontinue study drug or withdraw their consent to participat e in the study at any 
time.  The investigator must discontinue study drug dosing or withdraw any subject from the 
study if a subject requests study drug dosing to be discontinued or to be withdrawn from the study, respectively.  All subjects prematurely discontinuing study drug dosing should continue study participation to be follow ed for safety and efficacy outcome s. 
9.10.1. Discontinuation of Study Drug Dosing  
If a subject prematurely discontinues study drug dosing, the investigator will record the reason for discontinuation on the relevant eCRF.  Such subjects will not be automatically withdrawn from the study and should continue participation in the study.  The investigator and subject 
should discuss a plan for continued participation.  Data for any outcome measures, particularly the primary and secondary endpoints, as well as safety follow -up, are important to collect.  For 
any subsequent study visits after study drug is prematurely discontinued, subjects will not be required to undergo PK sampling,  
.  If medically indicated, treatment with medication listed under  Section  9.9.1 is no 
longer prohibited after study drug discontinuation.  Subjects must wait a minimum of 2 weeks after discontinuation of study drug dosing before starting any symptomatic drug treatment for chorea. 
The investigator must discontinue study drug dosing if the subject experiences any of the 
following: 
• If the type, frequency, or severity of any AE becomes unacceptable/intolera ble, despite 
attempts to decrease the dose.  
• If the subject is unable to tolerate the lowest allowable study dose (20 mg).   
• QTcF value >500 msec (cardiologist verified) on any ECG tracing.  
• If the subject exhibits suicidal behavior, or suicidal ideation of  type 4 (active suicidal 
ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) based on the C -SSRS.  
• Subject is confirmed to be pregnant.  
The investigator or NBI may discontinue study drug dosing for other reasons as described below.   
• Subject develops a clinically significant laboratory (eg, ALT or AST ≥2.5 times ULN) or ECG abnormality. 
• Subject requires a medication that is prohibited by the protocol.  
It is crucial to obtain follow -up data for any subject who discontinues study drug dosing because 
of an AE, abnormal laboratory test, vital sign measurement, physical examination, or ECG finding.  In any case, every effort must be made to undertake safety follow-up procedures.

If a subject prematurely withdraws from the study, the investigator will record the reason for 
withdrawal on the relevant eCRF.  All subjects who withdraw from the study prematurely will be asked to have all early termination assessments performed.  If a subject withdraws prematurely and an in-person visit cannot be conducted for any reason, including COVID-19, the subject will be asked to participate in the visit via telephone (see Appendix A ).  A safety follow -up call 
approximately 14 days after discontinuation of study drug should be performed. 
Reasons for a subject’s withdrawal from study are: 
• The subject is lost to follow -up. 
• Sponsor decision. 
• Investigator decision.  
• Subject death.  
• Withdrawal of consent for the study. 
9.10.3. Sponsor’s Termination or Suspension of Study  
The Sponsor or designee reserves the right to close a study site, terminate or suspend the entire 
study, or terminate or suspend the study at individual sites, at any time for any reason. If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Sponsor shall promptly inform the investigators, the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics Committees (IECs), the regulatory authorities, and any contract research organizations (CROs) used in the study of the reason for termination or suspension, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator shall promptly inform the subject and should assure appropriate therapy and/or follow-up.

10.1.2. Placebo  
Matching placebo capsules are identical in appearance to valbenazine and will be orally 
administered in a double-blind manner (2 placebo capsules) on an identical schedule as valbenazine.  Subjects must swallow the capsules with approximately 4 ounces of water or other liquid, with or without food. 
10.2. Study Drug Storage  
All capsules must  be stored at controlled room temperature ( ). 
Study drug must  be stored and inventoried according to applicable state and federal regulations 
and study procedures. 
10.3. Study Drug Packaging and Labeling 
All packaging and labeling operations will be performed according to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and GCP.  The study drugs will be sent to designated staff at the study site who must complete and return a drug supply confirmation to NBI or its design ee verifying the receipt 
of the drug.  Study drug will be labeled in accordance with federal and local regulations, as applicable.  
Study drug will be supplied as capsules in child-resistant blistercard dispensers; each blistercard contains enough study drug for 14 days of dosing plus 3 extra dose days.  The blistercards will contain capsules of valbenazine or placebo.  
10.4. Blinding  
This study includes a 12-week double-blind placebo -controlled treatment period during which 
the subject, investigator, all study sit e personnel, and the sponsor (or designee) will be blinded to 
the subject’s treatment.  During this treatment period, all subjects will receive valbenazine or placebo as two capsules (identical in appearance) to be self -administered once daily. Clinical 
trial material supply chain  personnel who are not involved in decisions regarding subject’s study 
treatment will not be blinded.  
The randomization code will be broken for an individual subject only if the subject is pregnant, experiences an SAE that the investigator feels cannot be adequately treated without knowing the 

Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -98854-HD3005 
Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  5 Final Version  
12 April 2021  Confidential  50 identity of the subject’s treatment assignment, or for regulatory reporting requirements.  After  
the randomization code is broken because of a pregnancy, the subject will be informed of her 
treatment assignment.   In the case of a medical emergency in which knowledge of the identity of 
the study treatment is important for subject management, the investigator has the responsibility to decide whether to break the blind; treatment assignments would be unblinded using IWRS. It is recommended that the investigator contact the Study Medical Monitor (or designee; refer to Section  11.4.3 for contact information) before unblinding if it would not result in unnecessary 
delay to the immediate medical management of the subject. Documentation of the unblinding must be maintained.   
Members of the DSMB and individuals who generate the DSMB reports will be unblinded throughout the study. 
10.5. Study Drug Preparation and  Administration  
Study drug will be self- administered (in the presence of the subject’s caregiver, if applicable) 
once daily (qd) starting on Day 1.  Study drug should be administered at approximately the same time each day during the study.
  If a subject forgets or is unable to take the study drug during this 
time period, the subject should take his or her daily dose of study drug as soon as possible but no later than 2400 hours.  The subject will need to skip the dose for that day if he or she is unable to 
take the study drug before 2400 hours.  Subjects or their caregivers will record the date and time of study drug dosing each day on the form provided as part of the study drug packaging. 
10.6. Study Drug Compliance and Accountability  
Subjects will bring all unused study drug and empty drug packaging material to the site at 
specified study visits for drug accountability and reconciliation by study site  personnel.  A 
compliance check will be performed by counting the capsules returned at each study visit.   In the 
case where a subject is unable to return used and unused study drug to the study site, the subject may ship them directly to the study site  at the instruction of the investigator . 
The quantity of study drug dispensed, used, and returned will be recorded on a dispensing log or otherwise documented.  The quantity of study drug lost or destroyed must also be accounted for and documented.  The designated pharmacist or qualified personnel will be responsible for maintaining accurate records of the quantity and dates of all study drug supplies received, dispensed, and returned.   
10.7. Study Drug Retur n 
Written documentation to account for study drug and study drug materials is mandatory; all unused study drug and study drug materials must be kept in a secure location for final accountability and reconciliation.  Returned study drug and study drug material must be accounted for on a study drug return form provided by NBI or designee.  The investigator must provide a written explanation for any destroyed or missing study drug or study drug materials on the study drug return form.

All returned study drug and study drug materials should be stored, inventoried, reconciled, and 
returned according to applicable state and federal regulations and study procedures. 
11. ADVERSE EVENTS  
All AEs, whether observed by the investigator, reported by the subject, noted from laboratory findings, or identified by other means, will be recorded from the time the subject has signed the ICF until the subject’s final study visit  (or upon early termination).  
11.1. Definition  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.  
AEs include, but are not limited to:  (1) a worsening or change in nature, severity, or frequency 
of conditions present at the start of the study; ( 2) intercurrent illness; and ( 3) drug interaction. 
Subject deterioration due to HD beyond what would otherwise be expected due to the natural history of the disease should be reported as an AE. 
If at any time after baseline the subject’s response to the suicidal ideation section of the C -SSRS 
is worse than the baseline assessment, it will be documented as an AE.  All suicidal behaviors 
will be documented as an AE.  
Subjects should be questioned in a general way, without asking about the occurrence of any specific symptom.  The investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, symptoms, and/or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and not the individual signs/symptoms.  Following questioning and evaluation, all AEs, whether believed by the investigator to be related or unrelated to the study drug, must be documented in the subject’s medi cal records, in accordance with the investigator’s 
normal clinical practice and on the AE eCRF.  Each AE is to be evaluated for duration, intensity, frequency, seriousness, outcome, other actions taken, and relationship to the study drug.  
The following are not considered AEs:  
• Continuous persistent disease/symptom present before drug administration, unless it 
unexpectedly progresses, or increases in severity following drug administration.  
• Treatment failure or lack of efficacy.  
• Pregnancy.

AEs must be graded for intensity.  An intensity category of mild, moderate, or severe, as defined 
in Table 4, must be entered on the AE eCRF.  It should be noted that the term “severe” used to 
grade intensity is not synonymous with the term “serious.”

Mild  An adverse event that is usually transient and may require only minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention.  The event does not generally interfere with usual activities 
of daily living.  
Moderate  An adverse event that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic 
intervention.  The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, causing 
discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the research 
participant.  
Severe  An adverse event that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clinical status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
11.1.2. Relationship to Study Drug  
The investigator will document his/her opinion of the relationship of the AE to treatment with 
study drug using the criteria outlined in Table 5.   An AE  is deemed associated with the use of the 
study drug “if there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE” (otherwise referred to as a suspected adverse reaction).  Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationshi p between the drug and the AE (Title 21 CFR 312.32 [a]). 
Table 5: Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug 
Relationship  Description  
Definite  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug or in 
which the drug level has been established in body fluids or tissue; that follows a known or 
expected response pattern to the suspected drug; and that is confirmed by improvement on 
stopping or reducing the dosage of the drug, and reappearance of the reaction on repeated 
exposure.  
Possible  An adverse event in which there is reasonable possibility that the drug caused the event.  
Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the 
drug and the adverse event.  
Unlikely  A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from administration of the drug; that 
follows a known or suspected response pattern to the suspected drug; but that could 
reasonably be explained by known characte ristics of the subject’s clinical state.  
Not Related  Any event that does not meet the above criteria.  
11.2. Recording Adverse Events  
Each AE will be documented on the AE eCRF.  The investigator  (or designee) will provide 
information on dates of onset and resolution, intensity, seriousness, frequency, action(s) taken, 
changes in study drug usage, relationship to study drug, and outcome.   
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -98854-HD3005 
Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  5 Final Version  
12 April 2021  Confidential  53 The following categories of medical events that could occur during parti cipation in a clinical 
study must be reported within 24 hours to the study medical monitor and NBI Drug Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance (DSPV) : 
• SAE, including death. 
• Pregnancy.  
• Treatment unblinding for any reason. 
• Events of suicidal behavior or suicidal ideation type 4 (active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan) or type 5 (active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent) based on the C -SSRS.  
11.3. Poststudy Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
All AEs, including clinically significant ch anges in ECGs, physical examination findings, or 
isolated clinically significant laboratory findings must be followed until the event resolves, the condition stabilizes, the event is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
AEs ongoing at the final visit or at early termination will be followed for as long as necessary to 
adequately evaluate the subject’s safety or until the event stabilizes or resolves or until the subject is lost to follow -up.  The investigator is responsible for ensuring that follow -up includes 
any supplemental investigations as may be indicated to elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE.  This may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals, as is practical.  
11.4. Serious Adverse Events  
All SAEs will be recorded from the time the subject has signed the ICF until the final study visit.  Investigators are not obligated to actively seek SAEs after a subject has withdrawn from or  
completed the study.  However, if the investigator becomes aware of any SAE, including a death, at any time after a subject has been withdrawn from or has completed the study, and the investigator considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor as described in Section  11.4.3. 
11.4.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any AE that results in any of the following outcome: 
• Death.  
• A life-threatening AE.  Life-threatening means that the subject was, in the view of the 
investigator or Sponsor, at immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  It does 
not mean that hypothetically the event might have caused death if it occurred in a more serious form. 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  Hospitalization for elective treatment or a pre-existing condition that did not worsen during the clinical investigation is not considered an AE.  Hospitalization or nursing home admission for the purpose of caregiver respite is not considered an AE.  Complications that occur during 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -98854-HD3005 
Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  5 Final Version  
12 April 2021  Confidential  54 hospitalization are AEs, and if a complication prolongs hospitalization, the event is 
considered serious.  Treatment in a hospital emergency room is not a hospitalization.  
• A persistent or significant inc apacity or substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life-threatening, or require hospitalization.  These events may be consid ered serious when, based on appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the health of the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed.  Any other event thought by the investigator to be serious should also be reported, following the reporting requirements detailed in this section.  Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias, convulsions that do not resul t in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse. 
11.4.2. Managing Serious Adverse Events 
Subjects experiencing an SAE or an emergency situation will be examined by a physician as soon as possible.  The physician in attendance wi ll do whatever is medically needed for the 
safety and well-being of the subject.  The subject will remain under observation as long as medically indicated.  Appropriate laboratory studies will be conducted until all parameters return to normal or are otherwise explained or stable.  The subject will be followed until the SAE resolves or until the subject is medically stabilized.  The investigator (or designee) will notify  the 
Study Medical Monitor and NBI DSPV Department (and the IRB/IEC, if necessary) immediately (within 24 hours) of the SAE and the outcome of the SAE as described in Section  11.4.3. 
11.4.3. Reporting Serious Adverse Events and Other Immediately  Reportable Events  
SAEs and other immediately reportable events (defined in Section  11.2) must be reported within 
24 hours of first knowledge of the event by study personnel to the Study Medical Monitor and NBI DSPV  Department.  Reports of SAEs and pregnancies must be followed by a fax or email of 
the SAE or Pregnancy Form.  It is important that the investigator provides his or her ass essment 
of relationship to study drug at the time of the initial SAE report. 
For SAEs and other immediately reportable events, contact DSPV and Study Medical Monitor:

necessary additions/corrections to the eCRF.  All change information, including the date, person 
performing the corrections, and reason for the change will be available via the electronic audit trail, which is part of the EDC system.  The eCRFs will be reviewed periodically for 
completeness and acceptability by NBI (or designee).  NBI (or designee) will also be allowed access to all source documents and medical records pertinent to the study in order to verify eCRF entries.  The site investigator will review the eCRFs for completeness and accuracy and enter his or her electronic signature on the eCRF page(s) as applicable as evidence thereof  after each study 
visit. 
The CRO will provide NBI (or designee) and the study site s with access to the study EDC 
system  for the duration of the study through a password-protected 
method of internet access.  Such access will be removed from study site s at the end of the site’s 
participation in the study.  Data from the EDC system will be archived on appropriate data media 
and provided to the site investigator at that time as a durable record of the site’s eCRF data.  Although not required, the site investigator may make paper printouts from that media.   All 
subject eCRF  data will also be provided to NBI via an agreed transfer method and in an agreed 
format. 
All clinical work conducted under this protocol is subject to GCP regulations.  This includes an 
inspection by NBI (or designee) and/or health authority representatives at any time.  The site 
investigator will agree to the inspection of study -related records by health authority 
representatives and/or NBI (or designee). 
12.2. Data Capture, Review, and Validation  
Data entered in the EDC system will be verified against the sour ce data by NBI (or designee).  
After completion of the entry process, automated (computer-generated) logic checks will run in order to identify items such as inconsistent study dates.  In addition, manual review/checks may be performed.  NBI (or designee) may also request specific reports and/or listings in order to 
perform manual review of the data.  Any inconsistencies/errors/omissions identified will be sent to the study site  (via an electronic query) for the necessary corrections to be made to the eCRF.   
Any discrepancies will be corrected or explained online by authorized study site  personnel.  
Once entered and saved in an eCRF, data immediately become part of the study database and are available to NBI (or designee). 
12.3. Coding Dictionaries  
AEs and medical history will be coded using the chosen version of the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA), per NBI.  Prior and concomitant medications will be coded using the chosen version of the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary, per NBI.

12 April 2021  Confidential  57 13. STAT ISTICAL AND ANALYTICAL PLAN  
13.1. Overview  
Descriptive and inferential statistical methods will be used to evaluate and summarize the data 
from this study. The term “descriptive statistics” refers to the number of subjects (n), mean, 
median, SD, SEM, minimum, an d maximum for continuous and ordinal categorical variables; 
and refers to the number and percentage of subjects for categorical variables.  Additional descriptive statistics may be presented for selected variables.  The term “inferential statistics” refers to hypothesis tests which will be performed to assess differences between the valbenazine treatment group and the placebo treatment group for selected efficacy variables.  
The analysis plan provided in this protocol represents a brief description of the pl anned analyses.  
The comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be generated prior to final study database lock. 
13.2. Analysis Sets  
Two primary analysis sets will be defined for this study.  The safety analysis set will include all subjects who are randomized to a treatment group, take at least one dose of study drug, and have any postbaseline safety data.  The full analysis set (FAS) will include all subjects who are randomized to a treatment group and who have at least one evaluable TMC change from  baseline 
score during the 12-week double-blind treatment period.  Additional analysis set s may be 
specified in the SAP.  
13.3. Sample Size Determination  
A total sample size of 120 subjects (60 per group) will provide >95% power to detect a difference between the valbenazine and placebo treatment groups in the change from the screening period baseline (the average of the screening and Day -1 assessments) to maintenance (the average of the Week 10 and Week 12 assessments) in the TMC  based on on-site 
assessments , using a two -sample t-test with a two -sided Type I error of 0.05.  This assumes a 
difference in means of 2.4 with a common SD of 3.3.  The specified treatment effect is attenuated to account for up to 4 (6.7%) subjects per treatment group who prematurely  
discontinue study drug dosing. 
The above sample size and power estimates were obtained from  . 
13.4. Handling of Missing Data  
Methods for handling missing data for the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints are discussed in Section  13.10.  Any additional methods or details for the handling of missing data 
will be described in the SAP.  
13.5. Disposition of Subjects  
The summary of subject enrollment and disposition will display the number of subjects who were randomized to each treatment group, who completed the dose-adjustment period (ie, up to Week 8), who competed the dose maintenance period (ie, up to Week 12), and who completed

12 April 2021  Confidential  58 the stu dy.  The number of subjects who discontinued study drug dosing early or did not complete 
the study will also be summarized, both overall and by reason.  Additional summaries may also 
be included.  
A separate summary of randomization by study site will be presented.  This summary will display the number of subjects randomized to each treatment group by site. 
13.6. Important Protocol Deviations  
A summary of the number and percentage of subjects with important protocol deviations ( IPDs) 
by deviation category and by treatment group will be provided for all randomized subjects. 
13.7. Demographics and Baseline Subject Characteristics  
Demographic data (age, sex , race, and ethnicity) and baseline characteristics (including , but not 
limited to:  height, weight, BMI,  genotype status, and baseline values for the TMC score) will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  Medical history will be summarized according to MedDRA System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). 
13.8. Study Drug Dosing and Compliance  
The number and percentage of subjects who are dose compliant (at least 80% of expected number of doses taken) will be summarized with descriptive statistics by visit (Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12). 
The number and percentage of subjects with dose adjustments will be summarized.  
13.9. Pharmacokinetics  
The plasma concentrations of valbenazine and the metabolite NBI -98782 will be summarized 
with descriptive statistics by visit (Day -1 and Weeks  2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14) and dose (last 
dose received prior to blood sample being drawn).  Concentrations below the lower limit of 
quantification will be set equal to zero for all plasma concentration summaries.  
13.10.  Efficacy Data  
The efficacy measures in this study include the UHDRS, PGI -C, CGI-C, PGI-S, CGI -S, SF-36, 
Neuro-QoL , EQ-5D-5L, HD-HI, .  Several 
derived variables based on these measures (eg, the SF -36 Physical Component Summary) will be 
summarized with descriptive statistics. Selected variables will include inferential statistics .  
Unless otherwise specified, the FAS will be used as the primary analysis set for all efficacy measures.  Regardless of adherence to study drug at the time of the assessment, all collected data will generally be included in the analyses.  The SAP will provide a full description of the derived variables and analyses that will be summarized for these efficacy measures.  
13.10.1. Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary efficacy endpoint for this study is the change from the screening period baseline (the average of the screening and Day -1 assessments) to maintenance (the average of the 

Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -98854-HD3005 
Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  5 Final Version  
12 April 2021  Confidential  59 Week  10 and Week 12 assessments) in the TMC  based on on-site assessments .  Changes from 
the screening period baseline to each postbaseline study visit (Weeks 2 through 12) are 
exploratory efficacy endpoints.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented by treatment group for the TMC observed values , and 
changes from the screening period baseline at each visit and at maintenance.  The changes from baseline to each postbaseline visit during the treatment period will be analyzed using a mixed -
effect model repeated measures (MMRM) analysis.  The model will include the screening period baseline TMC as a covariate, and treatment group, visit, treatment group -by-visit interaction, and 
baseline-by-vis it interaction as fixed effects.  Subject will be included as a random effect.  
Treatment group comparisons of the valbenazine treatment group vs. placebo at maintenance and each visit will be performed by constructing linear contrasts (or equivalent programming code) 
for differences between treatment group least -squares (LS ) means.  The LS means and 
differences in LS means will be presented in summary tables, along with the associated 95% confidence intervals.  The treatment difference for the primary endpoint (maintenance) will be considered statistically significant if the two -sided  p value is <0.05.  Nominal (raw) two -sided 
p values for testing the significance of the treatment differences at the individual postbaseline visits will also be reported in the summary tables.  
Any additional supportive or sensitivity analyses of the TMC change from screening period baseline to maintenance will be described in the SAP.  
13.10.2. Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
CGI -C Responder Endpoint  
CGI-C response status at Week 12 will be a secondary efficacy endpoint.  Subjects whose CGI-C 
score is either a 1 ("very  much improved") or a 2 ("much improved") will be classified as 
responders. Response statuses  at Weeks 2 through 10 are exploratory efficacy endpoints. 
Descriptive statistics will be presented by treatment group for the number and percentage of subjects classified as responders at each postbaseline visit.  Analyses comparing the valbenazine treatment group to placebo will be performed using the Fisher exact test .  Missing data at 
Week  12 will be imputed using non-responder imputation.  Nominal two -sided p values for 
testing the significance of treatment group will be reported in summary tables; however, interpretation of the p value for the treatment group comparison at Week 12 will be based on a procedure which controls for multiple comparisons (Section 13.10.3). 
PGI-C Responder Endpoint  
PGI-C response status at Week 12 will be a secondary efficacy endpoint.  The definition of 
response and analyses will be identical to those described for the CGI -C responder endpoint.  
Neuro -QoL Upper Extremity Function  
The change from baseline (Day -1) to Week 12 in the Neuro-QoL Upper Extremity Function 
T-score will also be a secondary endpoint.  Change from baselin e to Week s 4, 8, and 10 are 
exploratory efficacy endpoint s.  
Descriptive statistics will be presented by treatment group for the observed values and changes from baseline at each visit.  The changes from baseline to each postbaseline visit during the 
Neurocrine Biosciences, Inc., Study No. NBI -98854-HD3005 
Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  5 Final Version  
12 April 2021  Confidential  60 treatment period will be analyzed using MMRM.  The MMRM model will be similar to the 
model described above for the TMC analysis, with the exception that the covariate in the model will be the baseline value (Day -1) of the Neuro-QoL Upper Extremity Function T-score, and 
only visits where Neuro-QoL  is scheduled to be collected will be included.  Nominal two -sided p 
values for testing the significance of treatment group differences and associated 95% confidence intervals will be reported in summary tables; however , interpretation of the p value for the 
treatment group comparison at Week 12 will be based on a procedure which controls for multiple comparisons (Section 13.10.3). 
Neuro -QoL Lower Extremity Function 
The change from baseline (Day -1) to Week 12 in the Neuro-QoL Lower Extremity Function 
T-score will also be a secondary endpoint.  The analyses will be identical to those described for the Neuro-QoL Upper Extremity Function. 
13.10.3. Procedure to Control for Multiple Comparisons  
A fixed-sequence testing procedure will be used to control the family -wise error rate for the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints.  Testing of hypotheses at each step of the procedure 
commences only if all null hypotheses of the prior steps were rejected.  The fixed -sequence 
testing procedure will consist of performing the hypothesis tests in the following prespecified order: 
1. Primary endpoint:  TMC change from screening period bas eline to maintenance 
(valbenazine versus placebo treatment group). 
2. Secondary endpoint:  CGI -C response at Week 12 (valbenazine versus placebo treatment 
group).  
3. Secondary endpoint:  PGI-C response at Week 12 (valbenazine versus placebo treatment group). 
4. Secondary endpoint:  Neuro-QoL Upper Extremity Function change from baseline to 
Week 12 (valbenazine versus placebo treatment group). 
5. Secondary endpoint:  Neuro-QoL Lower Extremity Function change from baseline to Week 12 (valbenazine versus placebo treatmen t group). 
Each step in the sequential testing procedure uses a local two -sided 0.05 level of significance for 
the null hypothesis being tested.  The null hypothesis at each step of the procedure can only be rejected if all null hypotheses in prior steps were rejected.  
13.10.4. Exploratory Endpoints 
Endpoints not described in the preceding paragraphs are considered exploratory endpoints.  Details regarding the definitions and analyses of these endpoints will be provided in the SAP.  
13.11.  Safety Data  
Treatment -emergent adve rse events (TEAEs), categorized by MedDRA SOC and/or PT will be 
summarized in frequency tables.  The TEAE summary tables will include the number and

12 April 2021  Confidential  61 percentage of unique subjects experiencing each event.  Summary tables will be presented for all 
TEAEs, severe TEAEs, TEAEs leading to study drug dose reduction, TEAEs leading to early discontinuation of study drug dosing, and SAEs.  
An AE overview summary table will be provided which summarizes the number and percentage of subjects with any TEAE, any TEAE leadi ng to study drug dose reduction, any TEAE leading 
to discontinuation of study drug dosing, any SAE, and any TEAE resulting in death.  The summary table will also include the maximum TEAE intensity (mild, moderate, severe) reported for each subject. 
Clinical laboratory, vital signs, ECG, C-SSRS, UHDRS motor score (items for parkinsonism), 
BARS, and HADS data will be summarized with descriptive statistics.  Potentially clinically significant (PCS) values for selected clinical laboratory and vital signs variables will be summarized.  Prior and concomitant medications will be summarized according to WHO Drug Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification (ATC) categories.

Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  5 Final Version  
12 April 2021  Confidential  67 APPENDIX  A. GUIDANCE  TO ADDRESS GLOBAL HEALTH 
EMERGENCIES AND POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE 
CLINICAL STUDY  
Due to the global COVID-19 pandemic and in alignment with guidance put forth by the US Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA ; Conduct of Clinical Trials of Medical Products During the 
COVID-19 Public Health Emergency  [March 2020, updated December 2020]) and Health 
Canada (Management of Clinical Trials During the COVID -19 Pandemic: Notice to Clinical 
Trial Sponsors [September 2020]), the following revisions have been made in  the event that a 
subject is unable to attend an in -person visit (eg, subject is unable to travel to the site for safety 
reasons or as part of public health measures ).  Remote visits are to  be conducted on a 
case-by-case basis at the judgement of the investigator and in consultation with the study medical monitor; once able, the subject is to return to in -person visits at the study site . 
Informed Consent  
In the situation where reconsent is necessary (eg, updated ICF, protocol amendments, etc.) and the subject is unable to print the informed consent document provided electronically by the investigator  and an electronic signature process is not available, the investigator may consider 
using the following alternative process for obtaining and documenting informed consent.  This process is not applicable for initial ICF signing at  the screening visit which must be performed at 
the study site. 
1. The investigator provides the subject with an electronic version of the informed consent document. 
2. The investigator arranges a telephone call with the subject, the investigator, a witness who is not otherwise connected with the study and, if desired and feasible, additional participants requested by the subject.  Alternatively, in lieu of having a witness present, the co nversation may be recorded. 
3. To ensure that all subjects are treated consistently , a standard process should be used that 
will accomplish the following:  
• Identification of who is on the call. 
• Review of the informed consent document with the investigator and responses to any 
questions the subject may have.  
• Verbal confirmation by the subject that their questions have been answered and that they agree to participate in the study. 
4. Verbal confirmation by the subject that they signed and dated a blank piece of paper with a written statement that they voluntarily agree to participate in the study, noting both the protocol number and brief protocol title. 
5. After signing and dating the newly created document, the subject sends a photograph of the signed  and dated statement by facsimile, text message, or email to the investigator.  
The subject may also return the document to the investigator by mail at a later date, or at a future study visit that may occur at the study site.

Clinical Proto col Amendment No.  5 Final Version  
12 April 2021  Confidential  68 6. When using a witness, documen tation in the study records includes a signed and dated 
attestation by the witness who participated on the call that the subject confirmed their 
agreement to participate in the study and signed the document referenced above. 
7. When using a recording in lieu of using a witness, documentation in the study records includes the recording of the conference call.  
8. After the signed and dated document is received by study staff, it should be appended to a copy of the consent document that was reviewed with the subject and retained in the study records as would normally be done for a signed informed consent document.  Additionally, a note should be made in the study records explaining the reason why informed consent was obtained through an alternative method.  The case history for each subject must document that informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study. 
Data Collection, Transfer, and Storage 
When an assessment is conducted remotely, the investigator will document the date of the 
assessment, the p erson who conducted the assessment, and the type of technology used.  Remote 
data acquisition, transmission, and storage will be secured, and the privacy of study subjects will be protected.  Any electronic platforms used to transmit data into study records will include automated audit trails.  
Communication during remote visits between the investigator, subject, and home health professional will be conducted by audio telephone call. 
Remote Study Visits and Assessments  
Study Visits 3 to 6 (Weeks 2 to 8) and Study Visit 9  (Week 14) have a window of ±3 days.  The 
following sequence of events must be completed within this  visit  window (see Table  6 for full 
list of assessments) : 
1. Remote visit  and dosing decision (approximately 1 day). 
a. Vitals, ECG, and urine and blood samples are collected.  
b. Patient -reported outcome ( PRO) assessments  (HADS, PGI -C, PGI-S, and 
Neuro-QoL)  are completed.  
c. Investigator and/or qualified designee conducts telephone call with subject and home 
health professional to conduct the investigator assessments per  Table  6. 
d. Home health professional reports vitals and ECG values to investigator via telephone 
call. 
e. Investigator reviews initial data obtained over telephone call  and makes dosing 
decision  based on tolerability . 
2. Shipment of study drug kit directly to subject (at least 1 full day). 
3. Subject receives study drug kit.  Investigator confirms dosing decision after full 
assessment of data obtained at remote visit.  
4. Subject begins dosing from the new study drug kit, as instructed by the investigator.

obtained during the remot e visit.  
The investigator should make all attempts to prevent  any gaps in dosing. 
Table 6 presents the visits and assessments  that may be conducted remotely.  Assessments will

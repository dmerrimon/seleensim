2. SYNOPSIS  
Name of Sponsor/Company: Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
Name of Investigational Product: Eculizumab  
Name of Active Ingredient: h5G1.1 -mAb  
Title of Study:  
A Phase III, open -label extension trial of ECU- MG-301 to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in 
subjects with refractory generalized Myasthenia Gravis (gMG)  
Study Rationale:  
Trial ECU -MG- 301, a Phase 3 clinical trial, has been initiated to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in 
the treatment of refractory gMG. This extension trial is designed to provide the subjects who have participated in 
the ECU -MG- 301 trial an opportunity to receive eculizumab and to collect clinical data that will provide 
long-term saf ety and efficacy information on eculizumab in patients with refractory gMG.  
Study Center(s): Approximately 100 centers in North America , South America, Europe, Asia -Pacific, and 
Middle East  
Principal Investigator:  
Investigators: A list containing all Investigators will be provided with the final study report.  
Study period (years): 4 years  
Estimated date first subject enrolled: 2014  
Estimated date last subject completed: 2018  
The end of trial is defined as last subject’s last visit.  Phase of development: 3 
Objectives:  
Primary: 
• To evaluate the long -term safety of eculizumab in subjects with refractory gMG  
Secondary:  
• To evaluate the long -term efficacy of eculizumab in subjects  with refractory gMG as measured by the 
improvement or maintenance of the MG- specific Activities of Daily Living profile (MG -ADL)  
• To evaluate the long -term efficacy of eculizumab by additional efficacy measures including: 
- Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QM G) score;  
- Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) score, and  
- Improvement or maintenance in primary symptoms that are most clinically meaningful to the 
subjects  
• To characterize the effect of eculizumab on quality of life measures  
• To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of eculizumab in subjects with 
gMG . 
Methodology:  
This is an open -label trial. All subjects who have completed the ECU -MG-301 trial may be eligible to participate 
in this extension trial. Prior to initiating any extension trial procedures, informed consent form must be signed 
and inclusion/exclusion criteria must be evaluated and met.  
Subjects will enter this extension trial within 2 weeks after completing Visit 17 (Week 26) in the ECU -MG-301 
trial. 
Blind Induction Phase (Visits 1 -4, Day 1 and Weeks 1- 3): 
To preserve the blinded nature of the ECU -MG-301 trial, all subjects must undergo a blind induction phase prior 
Page 7 of 114 
Alexion CONFIDENTIAL 
PPD
ECU -MG-302, Amendment 2  Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
19 December 2016     
to entering the open -label maintenance phase of this trial (ie, all subjects will receive blinded Investigation al 
Product [IP] weekly for 4 doses). Patients who were randomized to the placebo arm in the ECU -MG-301 trial 
will receive 4 vials IP (3 vials/900 mg eculizumab plus 1 vial placebo) at Visits 1 to 4. Patients who were 
randomized to the eculizumab arm in the  ECU -MG-301 trial will continue to receive 4 vials IP (1200 mg 
eculizumab) every two weeks at Visits 1 and 3 and placebo at Visits 2 and 4. All patients will receive 
4 vials/1200 mg eculizumab open -label at Visit 5 and onward throughout the trial.  
Open -Label Maintenance Phase (Visit 5 and onward):  
All subjects will receive open -label eculizumab (4 vials/1200 mg) every 2 weeks during the maintenance phase. 
All subjects must be present at the trial site for Visits 1 to 16, 23, 29, 42, 55, 68, 81, 94, and 107 for visit- specific 
procedures and assessments (including IP administration). For other visits, subjects may have the opportunity to 
receive IP administration remotely at a medical facility that is located near the subject’s home or at the subject’s 
home with the permission of the Principal Investigator (PI) in accordance with all national, state, and local laws 
or regulations of the pertinent regulatory authorities. These visits will be conducted by a qualified staff member 
from the medical facility near the subject’s home or by home care health professionals. The trial medication will 
be prepared at the Investigator’s pharmacy , at the designated homecare pharmacy , or at the subject’s home, and 
transported under controlled conditions to the subject’s home or to the medical facility for administration. During 
a remote dosing visit, information on adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, and signs or symptoms of 
Clinical Deterioration in MG will be collected and sent by the qualified staff that performs the remote infusion to 
the Investigator’s site for evaluation on the day of the visit. Subjects must go to the trial site for evaluation if the 
subject reports any signs or symptoms that suggest a serious AE (SAE) or Clinical Deterioration.  
Supportive imm unosuppressive therapy (IST) is allowed during the extension trial at the Investigator’s discretion. 
Change in IST or its dose/schedule will be allowed if due to intolerance or if medically indicated, at the discretion of the Investigator. However, use of rituximab is prohibited during the trial. Subjects may continue participation 
in this study and receive the IP until the product is registered and available to treat subjects diagnosed with 
refractory gMG (in accordance with country specific regulations) o r for maximum of 4 years, whichever occurs 
first. In Denmark, patient participation may continue for a maximum of 48 months . 
Subjects must be informed of the potential signs and symptoms of MG crisis and instructed to contact the Investigator site as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. Every effort should be made to evaluate the 
subject reporting Clinical Deterioration as soon as possible and within 48 hours of notification of the Investigator site of symptom onset. At the evaluation visit, the In
vestigator or his/her designee will perform the assessments as 
specified by this protocol. The Investigator will determine whether or not the subject meets the Clinical 
Deterioration as defined by this protocol and treat the subject accordingly (reference below “On -Trial Rescue 
Therapies”).  
On-Trial Rescue Therapies:  
On-Trial Rescue Therapy (for example, high dose corticosteroid, plasma exchange [PE] or intravenous 
immunoglobulin [IVIg]) will be allowed when a subject’s health is in jeopardy if rescue therapy is not administered (eg, emergency , and/or emergent but not life -threatening situations), or if a subject experiences 
Clinical Deterioration as defined in this protocol. The rescue therapy used for a particular subject will be at the 
discretion of the Investigator. Every effort should be made to notify the Sponsor within 24 hours should a subject 
require a rescue therapy.  
For this protocol, Clinical Deterioration warranting use of On -Trial Rescue Therapy is as follows:  
• Subjects who experience an MG Cri sis, which is defined as weakness due to MG that is severe enough 
to necessitate intubation or to delay extubation following surgery. The respiratory failure is due to weakness of respiratory muscles. Severe bulbar (oropharyngeal) muscle weakness often accompanies the respiratory muscle weakness, or may be the predominant feature in some subjects); or,  
• Significant symptomatic worsening to a score of 3 or a 2- point worsening on any one of the individual 
MG-ADL items other than double vision or eyelid droop o r,   
• Subjects for whom the Investigator believes that the subjects’ health is in jeopardy if rescue therapy is not given (eg, emergency , and/or emergent but not life -threatening situations).  
Follow- up Period:  
Safety Follow -up (8 weeks):  If a subject withdraws from the extension trial or discontinues eculizumab treatment 
at any time and for any reason after receiving any amount of IP, the subject will be required to complete an Early 
Page 8 of 114 
Alexion CONFIDENTIAL 
ECU -MG-302, Amendment 2  Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
19 December 2016     
Termination (ET) Visit at the time of the withdrawal and a Follow -up Visit 8 weeks following the last dose of IP 
administration. If a subject is discontinued due to an AE, the event will be followed until it is resolved or, in the 
opinion of the PI, is determined medically stable. Subjects who withdraw from the extension trial and transition 
to treatment with the commercially available eculizumab will not be required to complete a Follow -up Visit.  
Post- Treatment  Follow -up (up to 1 year):  The Sponsor may seek to collect follow -up information concerning MG 
status in patients post- treatment  for up to 1 year from the end of study (EOS)/early termination (ET) visit (refer to 
Section  7.1.3.2 , Section 7.3.6 , and Appendix 11 ). 
Number of Patients (Planned): Approximately 92.  
This is an extension trial to the ECU -MG- 301 trial. Approximately 92 patients with gMG will be enrolled in the 
ECU -MG-301 trial. Patients who complete  the 26- week treatment period (Visit 17) in the ECU -MG-301 trial may 
potentially enter this extension trial.

5. Any medical condition or circumstances that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might interfere with the 
subject’s participation in the trial, pose any added risk for the subject, or confound the assessment of the 
subjects.  
Investigational product, dosage, and mode of administration: Investigational Product (eculizumab and/or 
placebo [placebo used only during the blind -induction phase]), will be administered intravenously according to 
the following regimen:  
Blind Induction Phase:  
To maintain the blind of the ECU -MG-301 trial, all subjects will undergo a blind induction phase (Visits 1  to 4, 
Day1, and Weeks 1 to 3). Investigational product (eculizumab, placebo or eculizumab plus placebo) will be  
administered weekly during the induction phase according to the following schedule:

Open -Label Maintenance Phase:  
All subjects will receive 4 vials of eculizumab (1200 mg) every 2 weeks starting with Visit 5 and throughout the remainder of the trial.  
Supplemental Dose:  
If a subject undergoes plasmapheresis or PE for Clinical Deterioration during the Study Period, a s upplemental 
dose of 2 vials of IP (600 mg of eculizumab) must be administered within 1 to 2 hours after each PE session 
unless the PE session is on the day of a scheduled IP infusion. If the PE is on the day of a scheduled IP infusion, 
the scheduled dose of IP (instead of the supplemental dose) should be administered within 1 to 2 hours after the 
completion of PE session. In addition, subjects are to continue eculizumab infusion according to the protocol specified dosing regimen.  
Duration of treatment: Approximately 4 years  
The duration for an individual subject may vary depending on when the subject enters the trial, the maximum 
time being 4 years.  
Reference therapy, dosage and mode of administration: Not Applicable  
Criteria for evaluation:  
Efficacy:  
Duration of treatment commences with the first IP (eculizumab) infusion during the Induction Phase.  
• The MG -ADL focuses on relevant symptoms and performance of ADL in subjects with MG. The 
MG-ADL consists of 8 items, derived from symptom -based components o f the original 13 -item QMG, 
to assess disability secondary to ocular (2 items), bulbar (3 items), respiratory (1 item), and gross motor 
or limb (2  items) impairment related to the effects of MG. In this functional status instrument, each 
response is graded 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe). The range of total MG -ADL score is 0  to 24. In this 
trial, the recall period for MG -ADL is the last 7 days. If the number of days since the last visit is less 
than 7, the recall period is since the last visit. MG -ADL will be  performed by a trained evaluator at the 
protocol specified time points and preferably by the same evaluator each time throughout the study.  
• The QMG scoring system is considered to be an objective evaluation of MG therapy and is based on a quantitative te sting of muscle strength and endurance/fatigability of sentinel muscle groups. The QMG 
consists of 13 items: ocular (2 items), facial (1 item), bulbar (2 items), gross motor (6 items), axial 
(1 item) and respiratory (1  item); each graded 0 to 3, with 3 being the most severe. The range of total 
QMG score is 0 – 39. The QMG will be administered at approximately the same time of day throughout 
the study by a trained evaluator at the protocol specified time points and preferably by the same 
evaluator each time.  
• The MGC assesses 10 important functional areas most frequently affected by MG: ocular (2 items), 
Page 10 of 114 
Alexion CONFIDENTIAL 
ECU -MG-302, Amendment 2  Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
19 December 2016     
facial (1  item), bulbar (3 items), respiratory (1 item), axial (1 item) and gross motor (2 items). The scales 
are weighted for clinical significance that incorporates subject -reported outcomes. Higher scores indicate 
more functional impairment. The range of total MGC score is 0 – 50. MGC will be administered at the 
approximately same time of day throughout the study by a well -trained evaluator at the protocol 
specified time points, and preferably by the same evaluator each time.  
Safety:  
The safety of eculizumab will be assessed based on:  
• The AEs, SAEs, and changes from baseline through trial completion in vital signs, electrocardiogram  
(ECG), routine clinical la boratory tests (chemistry, hematology), Columbia -Suicide Severity Rating 
Scale (C -SSRS), and pregnancy tests for female subjects of childbearing potential.  
• Immunogenicity: blood samples will be collected for evaluation for anti -drug antibody (ADA) at 
specified time points to describe the presence or absence of an immune response to eculizumab and to 
evaluate, if antibodies are detected, whether the antibodies neutralize the activity of eculizumab (ability 
of eculizumab to inhibit C5 cleavage by C5 converta se). 
Pharmacokinetics:  
Blood samples will be collected at specified time points to study the concentration of eculizumab versus time. PK parameters such as maximum concentration, trough and peak eculizumab concentration during the blinded 
induction and ope n-label maintenance phases will be reported. Clearance and terminal half -life will be estimated.  
Pharmacodynamics:  
Blood samples for PD analyses will be collected at specified time points to assess pre - and post- treatment serum 
hemolytic activity and there fore C5 complement activity inhibition. Free C5 concentration also may be 
monitored.  
Biomarkers:  
Blood samples for acetylcholine receptor  antibody (AChR Ab) will be collected at protocol specified time points.  
Quality of Life:  
The MG -QOL15, Neuro -QOL Fatigue, and EQ -5D will be used.  
Statistical methods:  
Analyses will be produced using data from this trial alone (Extension Trial) as well as combined analyses that 
will include data from the ECU -MG-301 trial (Combined Trial Analyses). The analyses will include safety, 
efficacy and PK/PD analyses. The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will cover both the standalone trial analyses 
and the combined ECU -MG- 301 and ECU- MG-302 trial analyses.  
Treatment groups will be indicated by eculizumab/eculizumab for the subjects originally randomized to the eculizumab arm in the ECU -MG-301 trial and placebo/eculizumab for the subjects originally randomized to the 
placebo arm in the ECU -MG-301 trial. The Extension Trial analyses will be presented by treatment group. The 
Comb ined Trial Analyses, where the data are aligned based on the subject’s first dose date of eculizumab, will 
only be presented as 1 combined eculizumab treatment group since all subjects will have received eculizumab.  
Interim statistical analyses for safety  and the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints may be performed at the 
discretion of the Sponsor. All analyses will be prospectively defined in the statistical analysis plan. The final statistical analyses will be performed after the study ends and the database has been locked.

5. INTRODUCTION  
Myasthenia Gravis (MG) is a rare, debilitating, acquired autoimmune disease of the 
neuromuscular junction (NMJ), caused by the failure of neuromuscular transmission, which 
results from the binding of auto-antibodies (Abs) to proteins involved in signaling at the NMJ (Conti- Fine 2006). Myasthenia Gravis is clinically characterized by weakness and fatigability of 
skeletal muscles; however, in the MG patient population there is a wide range of disease severity. Although many patients with MG can be managed with anticholinesterase inhibi tor 
therapy and immunosuppressant therapy (IST), there is a cohort of patients who continue to have 
marked generalized weakness and bulbar signs and symptoms of the disease despite adequate 
dosing of IST (Conti-Fine 2006). For these patients, there is a me dical need for alternative 
treatment strategies targeting different pathophysiological aspects of the disease. Since 
complement activation plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of MG (Conti- Fine 2006, 
Vincent 2002), eculizumab, a terminal complement inhibitor, may benefit patients who continue 
to have generalized weakness and bulbar signs and symptoms despite current standard of care. 
Following the completion of a Phase 2 pilot trial in subjects with refractory generalized 
Myasthenia Gravis (gMG), Alexion has initiated a Phase 3 trial, Study ECU- MG-301, to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of eculizumab in the same subject population. This extension 
trial is designed to provide the subjects that completed the ECU -MG-301 trial with the 
opportunity to rec eive eculizumab, and to collect clinical data that will provide long term safety 
and efficacy information on eculizumab in subjects with refractory gMG. Since this is an extension trial of the ECU- MG-301 trial, the same maintenance dose of eculizumab will be used. 
Refer to the current Investigator’s Brochure (IB) for detailed information on the safety and 
efficacy data of eculizumab.

6. TRIAL OBJECTIVES AND  PURPOSE  
6.1. Primary Objective 
The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the long- term safety of eculizumab in subjects 
with refractory gMG.  
6.2. Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of this trial are: 
• To evaluate the long- term efficacy of eculizumab in subjects with refractory gMG as 
measured by the improvement or maintenance of the MG- specific A ctivities of Daily 
Living profile (MG- ADL)  
• To evaluate the long- term efficacy of eculizumab by additional efficacy measures 
including: 
− Quantitative Myasthenia Gravis (QMG) score;  
− Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) score, and  
− Improvement or maintenance in pr imary symptoms that are most clinically 
meaningful to the subject. 
• To characterize the effect of eculizumab on quality of life measures  
• To describe the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of eculizumab 
in subjects with refractory gMG

7. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
7.1. Overall Trial Design  
This is an open -label, multi -center trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of eculizumab for the 
treatment of subjects with refractory gMG. All subjects who have completed the ECU -MG-301 
trial may be eligible to participate in this extension trial. Prior to initiating any extension trial 
procedures, informed consent form (ICF) must be signed and inclusion/exclusion criteria must be 
evaluated and met.  
Subjects will enter this extension trial within 2 weeks after they have completed Visit 17 
(Week  26) in the ECU- MG-301 trial. There will be 2 phases in this trial: Blind Induction Phase 
and Open- Label Maintenance Phase. The schedule of assessments for Visits 1  to 16 (beginning 
of Year  1) are provided in Table  4. The schedule of assessments for Visits 17  to 29 (end of 
Year  1) are provided in Table  5. The schedules of assessments for Years 2 through 4 are 
provided in Table  6 and Table  7. The schedule of assessments for the safety  follow- up visit is 
provided in Table  9.  
Subjects may continue participation in this trial and receive the investigational product (IP) until 
the product is registered and available to treat subjects diagnosed with refractory gMG (in accordance with country specific regulations) or for a maximum  of 4 years, whichever occurs 
first. In Denmark, patient participation may continue for a maximum of 48 months. The end of 
trial is defined as last subject’s last visit.  
7.1.1. Blind Induction Phase  
To preserve the blinded nature of the ECU- MG-301 trial, all subjects must undergo a Blind 
Induction Phase prior to entering the Open- Label Maintenance Phase of this trial, ie, all subjects 
will receive blinded IP weekly for 4 weeks. Table  10 provides details on treatment assignment 
during the Blind Induction Phase. 
7.1.2. Open- Label Maintenance Phase 
All subjects will receive open -label eculizumab (4 vials/1200 mg) every 2 weeks during the 
Open -Label Maintenance Phase start ing at Visit 5 and onward. The duration of the trial for an 
individual subject will vary depending on when the subject enters the trial, the maximum time 
being up to 4 years.  
All subjects must be present at the trial site for Visits 1  to 16, 23, 29, 42, 55, 68, 81, 94, and 107, 
as applicable, for visit -specific procedures/assessments including IP administration. For other 
visits, subjects may have an opportunity to receive IP administration remotely at a medical 
facility that is located near the subject’s home or at the subject’s home with the permission of the 
Principal Investigator (PI) in accordance with all national, state, and local laws or regulations of 
the pertinent regulatory authorities. These visits will be conducted by a qualified staff member 
from the medical facility near the subject’s home or by home care health professionals. The trial 
medication will be prepared at the Investigator’s pharmacy , at a designated homecare pharmacy , 
or at the subject’s home,  and transported under controlled conditions to the subject’s home or to 
the medical facility for administration. During a remote dosing visit, information on adverse

events (AEs), concomitant medications, and signs or symptoms of Clinical Deterioration in MG 
will be collected by the qualified staff that performs the remote visit, and sent to the 
Investigator’s site for evaluation on the day of the visit. Subjects must go to the trial site for 
evaluation if the subject reports any signs or symptoms that suggest a serious AE (SAE) or Clinical Det erioration.  
Supportive IST is permitted during the extension trial at the Investigator’s discretion. Change in IST or its dose/schedule will be allowed if due to intolerance or medically indicated at the discretion of the Investigator. However, use of rituximab is prohibited during the trial.  
Subjects must be informed of the potential signs and symptoms of MG crisis and instructed to 
contact the Investigator as soon as possible after onset of symptoms. Every effort should be made for the subject reporting  Clinical Deterioration to be evaluated as soon as possible and within 48 
hours of notification of the Investigator of symptom onset. At the evaluation visit, the Investigator or his/her designee will perform the assessments as specified by this protocol (refer  to Table  8). The Investigator will determine whether or not the subject meets the Clinical 
Deterioration as defined by this protocol and treat the  subject accordingly (refer to 
Section  7.1.4).  
Subjects may continue participation in this trial and receive IP for a maximum of 4 years or  until 
the product is registered and commercially available to treat patients diagnosed with gMG (in accordance with country specific regulations), whichever occurs first.  
7.1.3. Follow- up Period  
7.1.3.1. Safety Follow- up (8 Weeks)  
If a subject withdraws from the extension trial or discontinues eculizumab treatment at any time 
and for any reason after receiving any amount of IP, the subject will be required to complete an 
Early Termination (ET) Visit at the time of the withdrawal (refer to Table  7 end of study 
[EOS]/ET) and a Follow -up Visit (refer to Table  9) 8 weeks following the last dose of IP 
administration. If a subject is discontinued due to an AE, the event will be followed until it is resolved or, in the opinion of the Investigator, is determined medically stable. Subject s who 
withdraw from the extension trial and transition to treatment with the commercially available 
eculizumab will not be required to complete a Follow-up Visit. 
7.1.3.2. Post-Treatment  Follow -up (Up to 1 Year)  
The Sponsor may seek to collect follow -up information  concerning MG status in patients post-
treatment for up to 1 year from the EOS/ET visit (refer to Appendix 11).  
7.1.4. Clinical Deterioration Definition and  Rescue Therapies 
On-Trial Rescue Therapy, eg, high dose corticosteroid, plasma exchange (PE), or intravenous 
immunoglobulin (IVIg), will be allowed when a subject’s health is in jeopardy if rescue therapy 
is not administered (eg, emergency , and/or emergen t but not life -threatening situations), or if a 
subject experiences Clinical Deterioration as defined in this protocol. The rescue therapy used for a particular subject will be at the discretion of the Investigator. Every effort should be made to notify the Sponsor within 24 hours should a subject require a rescue therapy.  
Page 24 of 114 
Alexion CONFIDENTIAL 
ECU -MG-302, Amendment 2  Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
19 December 2016     
For this protocol, Clinical Deterioration warranting the use of On -Trial Rescue Therapy is as 
follows: 
• Subjects who experience an MG Crisis, which is defined as weakness due to MG that 
is severe enough to necessitate intubation or to delay extubation following surgery. The respiratory failure is due to weakness of respiratory muscles. Severe bulbar 
(oropharyngeal) muscle weakness often accompanies the respiratory muscle 
weakness, or may be the predominant feature in some subjects; or,  
• Significant symptomatic worsening to a score of 3 or a 2-point worsening from 
Baseline (ie, Study ECU -MG-302 Day 1) on any one of the individual MG- ADL 
items other than double vision or eyelid droop; or,  
• Subjects for whom the Investigator believes that the subjects’ health is in jeopardy if rescue therapy is not given (eg, emergency , and/or emergent but not life-threatening 
situations).  
7.1.5. Clinical Evaluator  
The Clinical Evaluators are study staff that have b een trained and certified in administering the 
MG-ADL, QMG, and MGC. The Clinical Evaluator may be a neurologist, physical therapist, or 
other study team member delegated by the Investigator. Clinical Evaluator training and 
certification for this protocol will take place either at the Investigator's meeting or via the 
sponsor's designated on- line training portal.  
7.1.6. Responsibilities for MG Assessments 
Responsibilities for MG assessments are listed in Table  3. Throughout the trial, MG assessments 
should be performed at approximately the same time of day by a properly trained evaluator, preferably the same evaluator.

2 Throughout the study, it is preferred that the same properly trained evaluator perform the clinical assessments of MG -ADL, QMG, and MGC. Additionally, the cl inical 
assessments of QMG, NIF and MGC shall be performed at approximately the same time of day. If a subject is taking a cholinesterase inhibitor, the dose must be withheld for at 
least 10  hours prior to the tests.  
3 MGFA- PIS must be performed by the PI or the same neurologist throughout the trial.  
4 Clinical Lab Tests will be performed at the central laboratory. Refer to Appendix 5 for a summary of clinical lab test panels and tests.  
5 Pregnancy tests must be performed on all women of child bearing potential at the specified time points. Additional pregnancy test (urine or serum) may also be performed at any 
visit at the PI’s discretion.  
6 Baseline and trough blood samples for PK, PD and free C5 and all samples for ADA are to be taken 5 – 90 minutes before the IP infusion. Peak blood samples for PK, PD and 
free C5 testing are to be taken 60 minutes after the completion of the  IP infusion.  
If a subject undergoes plasma exchange (PE) for a Clinical Deterioration, 3 blood samples for PK, PD and free C5 will be collected [1] 5 – 90 minutes prior to PE; [2] after PE 
and before IP infusion; and [3] at 60 minutes after the completion  of IP infusion.  
7 Subjects may be revaccinated for N. meningitidis  to provide active coverage as specified by the vaccine manufacturer or according to current medical/country guidelines. 
Subject s will be given a Patient Safety Information Card prior to the first dose of trial medication. At each visit throughout the trial, site staff will ensure that the subject has the 
Patient Safety Information Card, and document in the source documents.  
8 IP will be administered after completion of all other tests and procedures, excluding the peak blood sampling for PK/PD and free C5 assay (Refer to Section 10.5). 
9 If a subject undergoes PE for a Clinical Deterioration (as defined by this protocol) a supplemental dose (2 vials IP) must be  administered within 1 to 2 hours after the end of each 
PE session unless the PE session is on the day of a scheduled IP infusion. Per protocol, scheduled IP administration will be continued according to the specified dose -
administration schedule for the subject. If the subject is scheduled to receive the protocol -scheduled dose on the day of a PE session, then the scheduled dose (instead of the 
supplemental dose)  should be administered within 1 to 2 hours after the end of the PE.

7.3. Trial Visit Procedures  
Visit 1/Day 1 should occur within 2 weeks (14 days + 2) of Visit 17 in Trial ECU -MG-301 in 
order to prevent a lapse in dosing. Visit intervals during Blind Induction Phase (Visits 1 to  4) are 
weekly (every 7 ±2 days after the last visit, based on PK profile). Visit intervals during the 
Open -Label Maintenance Phase (Visits 5 to 107) are every 2 weeks (every 14  ±2 days since the 
last visit). IP will be administered after completion of  all other tests and procedures (excluding 
the peak blood sampling for PK/PD and free C5 assay) as described in Section  10.5. 
Subjects who fail to r eturn for a scheduled visit must be contacted by the site study staff to 
determine the reason for missing the appointment. Subjects should be strongly encouraged to return to the investigational site for evaluation if Clinical Deterioration or an AE is sus pected to 
have occurred. In the exceptional circumstance, if a subject cannot or does not come to the study 
site for examination, then the subject will be instructed to see his or her local neurologist or 
physician. In this event, the investigational site will obtain relevant medical records as documentation from the local physician’s examination, and enter relevant data in the eCRF as 
appropriate.  
As it is vital to obtain information on any subject’s missing visit to assure the missing 
appointment was not due to a Clinical Deterioration or an AE, every effort must be made to 
undertake protocol-specified follow-up procedures ( Table  9). Follow -up due diligence 
documentation will consist of 3 phone calls followed by 1 registered letter to the subject’s last 
known address, and documented in both the source documents and the eCRF. 
Patients should be registered in the Interactive Voice or Web Response System (IXRS) as soon 
as the ECU -MG-302 ICF is signed. The initial shipment of study drug for ECU- MG-302 will be 
triggered by the IXRS when the first patient in the ECU -MG-301 trial is registered as completing 
the study (Visit 17), and moves to the ECU- MG-302 trial.  
7.3.1. Blind Induction Phase  
7.3.1.1. Baseline (Visit 1/Day 1)  
Once all the eligibility criteria have been confirmed by the Investigator and the subject has signed the ICF, the subject will be assigned to a Blind Induction Phase treatment group based on 
their tre atment assignment in the ECU -MG-301 trial. The following tests and evaluations will be 
performed at the Baseline Visit (Visit 1/Day 1):  
• Review inclusion and exclusion criteria 
• Measure body weight 
• Perform a 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG)  
• Measure vital sign s, including assessments of systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
(BP), temperature, respiration rate (RR), and heart rate (HR)  
• Evaluate and record any new AEs or changes in AEs:  
− Since this an extension to the ECU -MG-301 trial, AEs with an onset date befor e 
the Day 1 of this extension trial will be recorded on the ECU- MG-301 eCRF 
regardless of when the subject signed the ECU -MG-302 ICF. 
Page 38 of 114 
Alexion CONFIDENTIAL 
ECU -MG-302, Amendment 2   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
19 December  2016    
− Any ongoing AEs at the time of Day 1 of this extension trial will be recorded on 
both the ECU- MG-301 and ECU- MG-302 CRFs. Since this will be done 
automatically by the system, sites will not be required to record these data twice.  
− AEs with an end date before Day 1 of ECU- MG-302 will be recorded only on the 
ECU- MG-301 eCRF. 
• Record any new concomitant medications or changes to concomitant medications (including non-drug therapies): 
− Since this is an extension to the ECU -MG-301 trial, concomitant medication with 
an onset date before Day 1 of this extension trial will be recorded on the ECU-
MG-301 eCRF regardless of when the subject signed the ECU- MG-302 ICF. 
Since this will be done automatically by the system, sites will not be required to 
record these data twice.  
− Any ongoing concomitant medication (including non- drug therapies) at the time 
of Day 1 of this extension trial will have to be recorded on both ECU- MG-301 
and ECU- MG-302 eCRFs.  
− Concomitant medication (including non-drug therapies) with an end date before 
Day 1 of ECU- MG-302 trial will be recorded only on the ECU- MG-301 eCRF. 
• Record MG Therapy Status (refer to Appendix 6) 
• Administer MG -ADL by a properly trained evaluator and preferably by the same 
evaluator throughout the trial. The recall period is the preceding 7 days.  
• Administer clinical assessments QMG, negative inspiratory force (NIF), and MGC; these shall be performed at approximately the same time of day, preferably by a properly trained evaluator, preferably the same evaluator, throughout the trial. If the 
subject is taking a cholinesterase inhibitor, the dose must be withheld for at least 
10 hours prior to the QMG and MGC assessments.  
• Administer questionnaires to evaluate quality of life (MG -QOL15, Neuro- QOL 
Fatigue, and EuroQOL [EQ- 5D])  
• Perform Columbia -Suicide S everity Rating Scale (C -SSRS; Appendix 9) 
• Obtain blood samples for clinical laboratory tests (chemistry and hematology; refer to 
Appendix 5) 
• Obtain pregnancy test (serum) for all women of childbearing potential. Note: if the 
subject is taking/using contraceptive medication/device, please be sure to record the 
medication or device on the appropriate eCRF pages (concomitant medication or procedure). Pregnancy testing (urine or serum) may also be performed at any time during the trial at the Investigator’s discretion.  
• Determine if the subject needs Neisseria meningitidis (N. meningitidis ) re-
vaccination. Re -vaccinate as needed to provide active coverage as specified by the 
vaccine manufacturer or according to current medical/country guidelines.

8. SELECTION AND WITHDR AWAL OF SUBJECTS  
8.1. Subject Inclusion Criteria 
1. Subject completed the ECU- MG-301 trial. 
2. Subject has given written informed consent. 
3. Subject is willing and able to comply with the protocol requirements for the duration of 
the trial.  
4. Female subjects of child -bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum 
human chorionic gonadotropin [HCG]). All subjects (female and male) must practice an effective, reliable and medical ly approved contraceptive regimen during the trial and for 
up to 5 months following discontinuation of treatment. 
8.2. Subject Exclusion Criteria 
1. Subjects who withdrew from the ECU- MG-301 trial as a result of an AE related to trial 
drug. 
2. Female subjects who are  pregnant, breastfeeding, or intend to conceive during the course 
of the trial.  
3. Unresolved meningococcal infection. 
4. Hypersensitivity to murine proteins or to one of the excipients of eculizumab. 
5. Any medical condition or circumstances that, in the opinion of the Investigator, might 
interfere with the subject’s participation in the trial, pose any added risk for the subject, or confound the assessment of the subjects.  
8.3. Subject Withdrawal Criteria 
8.3.1. Withdrawal of Subjects from the Trial  
Subjects may withdraw cons ent for study participation or assessment of post- treatment  MG 
status at any time. Every effort should be made to ensure subjects are willing to comply with trial 
participation prior to conducting the screening procedures. The subjects should be fully informed 
of the restrictions related to the change of concomitant medications during the trial. Investigators may choose to discontinue a subject’s treatment because of AEs, as well as conditions or 
illnesses that preclude compliance with the protocol from the  standpoint of the subject’s safety or 
well-being. The study staff should notify the Sponsor and their site monitor of all trial 
withdrawals as soon as possible.  
Reproduction and development studies with eculizumab have not been performed; therefore, 
eculi zumab should not be administered to pregnant women. At the time of the last follow-up 
visit, all subjects of childbearing potential must continue to use adequate contraception for up to 
5 months following discontinuation of eculizumab treatment. If a subject becomes pregnant, the 
IP must be immediately discontinued and the Sponsor must be notified. Each pregnancy will be followed to term and the Sponsor notified regarding the outcome.

19 December  2016    
8.3.2. Handling of Withdrawals 
When a subject withdraws or is withdrawn from the trial, the Investigator shall record the 
withdrawal reason(s) in the source documents and in the eCRF. Whenever possible, all subjects 
who prematurely withdraw from the trial will undergo all assessments at the ET visit per the 
Schedule of Assessments ( Table  7).  
A follow- up visit for safety assessment is required at 8 weeks (±2 days) after the last dose of IP 
administration ( Table  9).  
If a subject is discontinued due to an AE, the event will be followed until it is resolved or, in the opinion of the Investigator, the subject is determined to be medic ally stable. Every effort will be 
made to undertake protocol-specified safety follow-up procedures.  
Subjects who fail to return for final assessments will be contacted by the site study staff and 
reminded of the requirement for follow -up. As it is vital to obtain follow-up data on any subject 
withdrawn because of an AE or SAE, follow-up due diligence documentation will consist of 3 phone calls followed by 1 registered letter to the subject’s last known address. In any case, every effort must be made to undertake protocol- specified safety follow -up procedures. 
8.3.3. Sponsor’s Termination of Trial  
The Sponsor or a regulatory authority may discontinue the trial at any time for any reason including, for example, clinical or administrative reasons.

9.2.1.1.1. Cholinesterase Inh ibitors  
Cholinesterase inhibitor treatment must be withheld for at least 10 hours prior to any efficacy 
measurements (ie, QMG and MGC). Cholinesterase inhibitor therapy dose/schedule changes will 
be permitted due to intolerance or if medically indicated, a t the discretion of the Investigator. 
Any changes in cholinesterase inhibitor will be recorded on the concomitant medication eCRF. 
9.2.1.1.2. Immunosuppressive Agents  
• Immunosuppressive agents, eg, corticosteroid, azathioprine  (AZA), mycophenolate 
mofetil  (MMF), metho trexate (MTX), tacrolimus, cyclosporine, or cyclophosphamide 
at the appropriate dose level to be used for an individual subject will be permitted at 
the discretion of the Investigator.  
Immunosuppressant therapy dose/schedule changes will be permitted due to intolerance or if medically indicated, at the discretion of the Investigator. Reductions in IST dosing should be performed slowly, and preferably only after the subject has 
been in the extension study for at least 12 weeks. Any changes in IST will be recorded on the concomitant medication eCRF. 
• High dose steroid as an On- Trial Rescue Therapy should be reserved for subjects that 
experience Clinical Deterioration as defined by this proto col. The rescue therapy used 
for a particular subject will be at the discretion of the Investigator. Every effort should be made to notify the Sponsor within 24 hours should a subject require a 
rescue therapy.  
9.2.1.1.3. Plasma Exchange / Plasmapheresis / IVIg  
• Plasma Exchange or IVIg will be allowed as On- Trial Rescue Therapy for subjects 
that experience a Clinical Deterioration as defined by this protocol. The rescue therapy used for a particular subject will be at the discretion of the Investigator.  
• Every effort should be made to notify the Sponsor within 24 hours should a subject 
require a rescue therapy. Routine use of Plasma Exchange or IVIg as maintenance 
therapy to control MG symptoms outside of rescue is not permitted. 
• If PE is administered, supplemental  IP (2 vials) will be administered within 1 to 2 
hours after the end of each PE session unless the PE session is on the day of a scheduled IP infusion. Routine (per protocol schedule) IP administration will be 
continued per the specified dose- administratio n schedule for the subject (refer to 
appropriate Schedule of Assessments in Section  7.1). If the subject is scheduled to 
receive the protocol -scheduled dose on the day of a PE session, then the scheduled 
dose (instead of the supplemental dose) should be administered within 1 to 2 hours after the end of the PE session.  
9.2.2. Disallowed Medications 
The use of rituximab is prohibited during the trial.

9.3. Treatmen t Compliance 
The infusion of IP into subjects will be under the supervision of the Investigator or their designee 
to ensure that the subject received the appropriate dose at the appropriate time -points during the 
trial.  
Subjects who fail to return for a s cheduled visit within the acceptable intervals must be contacted 
by the site study staff to determine the reason for missing the appointment. Instructions for 
handling of missing visits are provided in Section  7.3.  
9.4. Randomization  
To preserve the blinded nature of the ECU- MG-301 trial, all subjects must undergo a 4- week 
Blind Induction Phase prior to entering the open- label phase of this trial. Subject s who had been 
randomized to the placebo arm in the ECU- MG-301 trial will receive 4 vials of IP 
(3 vials/900 mg eculizumab plus 1 vial placebo) every week at Visits 1 through 4. Subjects who 
were randomized to the eculizumab arm in the ECU -MG-301 trial wil l receive 4 vials IP 
(1200 mg eculizumab) every 2 weeks at Visits 1 and 3 and placebo at Visits 2 and 4.  
During the Open- Label Maintenance Phase, all subjects will receive open -label eculizumab 
(4 vials/1200 mg) every other week starting with Visit 5 and continuing throughout the trial. 
The patient identification number and study drug kits assignation will be provided by the IXRS.  
9.5. Blinding and Unblinding  
All patients will receive eculizumab in this study, including during the 4 -week Blind Induction 
Phase ( Visits 1  to 4), and during the Open- Label Maintenance Phase (Visits 5  to 107).  
During the Blind Induction Phase, all patients, investigational site personnel, Sponsor staff, 
Sponsor designees, and all staff directly associated with the conduct of the tria l will be blinded to 
the subject treatment assignments. The double- blind will be maintained by using identical IP kits 
and labels for eculizumab and placebo. The placebo will have an identical appearance to that of eculizumab.  
There is no antidote to reverse the effects of eculizumab; therefore unblinding would not be 
helpful in the planning of patient treatment for a given event. Unblinding should only be 
considered for the safety of the subject. If unblinding is deemed necessary by the Investigator, the Investigator can unblind the patient’s treatment allocation using IXRS. The Investigator must 
note the date, time and reason for unblinding. 
The Investigator should inform the Sponsor that the patient was unblinded, however they are not 
required to reveal to the Sponsor the patients’ treatment allocation.  
When an AE is an unexpected related SAE, the blind will be broken by the Sponsor only for that specific subject. The blind will be maintained for persons responsible for the ongoing conduct of the study (s uch as the management, monitors, investigators, etc.) and those responsible for data 
analysis and interpretation of results at the conclusion of the study, such as biometrics personnel. Unblinded information will only be accessible to those who need to be involved in the safety reporting to Health Authorities, Ethics Committees, and/or IRBs.

19 December  2016    
Investigators will receive only blinded information unless unblinded information is judged 
necessary for safety reasons.  
After the Blind Induction Phase, the remainder of the study is open- label; therefore, unblinding is 
not applicable.

10. INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT MATERIALS AND 
MANAGEMENT  
10.1. Investigational Product 
Each vial of IP contains eculizumab 300 mg or matching placebo (used only during Blind 
Induction Phase) for IV administration.  
10.2. Investigational Product Packaging and Labeling 
The active IP, eculizumab, is manufactured and supplied by Alexion in single 30 mL vials as a solution concentration of 10 mg/mL. The placebo is manufactured by Alexion Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc. as a matching sterile, clear, colorless solution in an identical 30 -mL vial and without active 
ingredient but with the same buffer components as eculizumab. 
All IP will be prepared in vials, pac kaged in kits, and labeled at Almac Clinical Services in an 
identical manner. Almac Clinical Services or its affiliate will ship the IP and release to each 
participating trial center upon receipt of all required essential documents based upon federal, state, and local regulations. 
Table  11 provides detailed information for both eculizumab and the placebo. For additional 
information on eculizumab, refer to the current IB.

10.3. Investigational Product Storage  
IP will be released to the site upon receipt of all required essential documents based upon 
federal, state, and local regulations. Each kit will have a 1-panel label describing the contents and 
a place for the pharmacist to record the subject number and in itials.  
Upon arrival at the center, the IP should be promptly removed from the shipping cooler and 
stored in refrigerated conditions at 2 to 8°C in the original package in order to protect from light. 
The pharmacist should immediately record the reception of the IP in IXRS and notify the 
distributor and Sponsor if vials are damaged and/or if temperature excursions have occurred during transportation (please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for detailed instructions). IP must be 
stored in a secure, limited -access storage area with controlled temperature. Temperature must be 
recorded on a daily basis.  
Diluted solutions of IP are stable for 24 hours at 2 to 8°C (36 to 46°F) and at room temperature. The 24 hours start from the time of IP preparation until the end of infusion.

10.4. Investigational Product Preparation  
Infusions of IP should be prepared using aseptic technique. Each vial of IP contains 300 mg of 
active ingredient in 30 mL of product solution or matching placebo.  
Withdraw the required volume of IP from the vials. Transfer the recommended dose to an 
infusion bag. Dilute the IP by addition to the infusion bag of the appropriate amount (equal 
volume) of 1 of the following: 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP; 0.45% Sodium Chloride 
Injection, USP; 5% Dextrose in  Water Injection, USP; or Ringer’s Injection, USP. The final 
volume of diluted IP solution is 240 mL for 900 mg doses (3 vials eculizumab plus 1 vial 
placebo) and 1200 mg doses (4 vials eculizumab), and 120 mL for 600 mg doses (2 vials 
eculizumab) ( Table  12).

2 Supplemental dose that is not administered on a scheduled visit. 
 
Gently agitate the infusion bag containing the diluted IP solution to ensure thorough mixing of 
the product and diluents. Discard any unused portion left in a vial, as the product contains no 
preservatives. The diluted solution should be allowed to warm to room temperature by exposure to ambient air prior to administration.  
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional information.  
10.5. Administration  
DO NOT ADMINISTER AS AN IV PUSH OR BOLUS INJECTION  
IP should only be administered via IV infusion; the infusion will be administered after completion of all other tests and procedures (excluding the peak blood sampling for PK/PD and free C5 assay). Prior to administration, the diluted solution should be allowed to warm to room 
temperature by exposure to ambient air. The diluted solution must not be heated in a microwave 
or with any heat source other than ambient air temperature. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration.  
The diluted IP should be intravenously administered over approximately 35 minutes (range of 25 to  45 minutes). It is not necessary to protect the infusion bags from light while IP is being 
administered to the subject. At the site’s discretion, the diluted IP may be administered via 
gravity feed, a syringe-type pump, or an infusion pump. The subjects will be monitored for at 
least 1 hour following infusion.  
Page 72 of 114 
Alexion CONFIDENTIAL 
ECU -MG-302, Amendment 2   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
19 December  2016    
If an AE occurs during the administration of the IP, the infusion may be slowed or stopped at the 
discretion of the Investigator, depending upon the nature and severity of the event; however, the 
overall duration should not exceed 2 hours from the start of the infusion. The AE must be 
captured in the subject’s source document and eCRF. 
10.6. Investigational Product Accountability  
When an IP shipment is re ceived at the site, the pharmacist should verify the contents, sign the 
packing invoice provided with the shipment, and maintain the original copy for review by the trial monitor. A signed copy should be faxed to the contact provided on the packing list and the 
duplicate copy kept in the pharmacy binder. Additionally, reception of IP (as well as reception 
conditions) must be reported to the IXRS system to allow drug randomization, resupply, estimations, and drug expiration control.  
Accountability logs and Inventory logs will be provided to assist the pharmacist in maintaining 
current and accurate inventory records covering receipt, dispensing, and disposition of the IP. 
During the trial, the following information must be noted in the accountability log: the subject 
number(s), initials of subject(s) to whom drug is dispensed, kit number, the date(s) and time that 
the IP is prepared and dispensed, and the initials of the pharmacist or designee who prepared the IP. Sites should keep a running total of their drug supply. Empty vials and vials with residual 
materials should be kept for inspection and accountability by the trial monitor prior to their 
destruction and handled per local site pharmacy standard operating procedures for clinical IPs. Destruction of used and unused vials, either locally or centrally, must be properly documented.  
Each kit will have a label and a place for the pharmacist to record the subject number and 
initials.  
The trial monitor will examine the inventory during the study. Additionally, the inventory 
records must be readily available and may be subject to regulatory authorities, the local 
regulatory agency, or an independent auditor’s inspection at any time. 
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for additional information.  
10.7. Investigational Product Handling and Disposal  
At the completion of the trial, in order to satisfy regulatory requirements regarding IP 
accountability, all remaining IP inventory will be reconciled and retained, returned, or destroyed 
according to applicable provincial and feder al regulations.

11. ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY 
This extension trial is designed to provide the subjects who have participated in the 
ECU- MG-301 trial with an opportunity to receive eculizumab and to collect clinical data that 
will provide long term safety and tole rability information on eculizumab. Efficacy is a secondary 
objective of this trial. The long- term efficacy of eculizumab in subjects with refractory gMG will 
be measured by the improvement in the MG- ADL total score. Duration of treatment commences 
with th e first infusion of IP (eculizumab). The Schedule of Assessments (refer to Section  7.2) 
defines the 4 -year trial time period and assessments for the study efficacy endpoints. Efficacy 
will be assessed comparing eculizumab outcomes to placebo outcomes in the protocol ECU- MG-
301. Statistical analyses of the efficacy endpoints are summarized in Section  15 and described in 
more detail in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). For all scales noted below except the EuroQOL Visual Analog Scale ( EQ-VAS) and MGFA PIS, the higher the score the greater the 
impairment. 
11.1. Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the MG- ADL total score. The 
secondary efficacy endpoints include:  
1. Change from baseline in QMG total score  
2. Proportion of subjects with at least a 3 -point reduction in the MG -ADL total score from 
baseline and with no rescue therapy 
3. Proportion of subjects with at least a 5 -point reduction in the QMG total score from 
baseline and with no rescue therapy 
4. Change from baseline in the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) scale total score  
5. Change from baseline in MG- QOL -15 
The tertiary efficacy endpoints for this trial include:  
1. Time to response as measured by the reduction in the MG -ADL total score (3 -point 
reduction from baseline) 
2. Change from baseline in Neuro- QOL Fatigue  
3. Change from baseline in EQ-5D 
4. Change from baseline in the MG-ADL individual items and sub- categories for the bulbar 
(items 1, 2, and 3), respiratory (item 4), limb (items 5 and 6) and ocular (items 7 and 8) in 
subjects with abnormal baseline scores for the particu lar item or sub -categories  
11.2. MG Activities of Daily Living Profile (MG -ADL)  
The MG -ADL is an 8 -point questionnaire that focuses on relevant symptoms and functional 
performance of ADL in MG subjects (refer to Appendix 2). The 8 items of the MG -ADL were 
derived from symptom-based components of the original 13- item QMG to assess disability 
secondary to ocular (2 items), bulbar (3 items), respiratory (1 ite m), and gross motor or limb 
(2 items) impairment related to effects from MG. In this functional status instrument, each 
Page 74 of 114 
Alexion CONFIDENTIAL 
ECU -MG-302, Amendment 2   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
19 December  2016    
response is graded 0 (normal) to 3 (most severe). The range of total MG-ADL score is 0 to 24. 
The recall period for MG -ADL is the preced ing 7 days. MG-ADL will be performed by a 
properly trained evaluator at the protocol specified time points and preferably by the same evaluator each time throughout the study.  
11.3. QMG Scoring System  
The current QMG scoring system consists of 13 items: ocular  (2 items), facial (1 item), bulbar 
(2 items), gross motor (6 items), axial (1 item), and respiratory (1 item); each graded 0 to 3, with 
3 being the most severe (refer to Appendix 1). The range of total QMG score is 0 to 39. The 
QMG scoring system is considered to be an objective evaluation of therapy for MG and is based on quantitative testing of sentinel muscle groups. The MGFA task force has recommended that the QMG score be used in prospective studies of therapy for MG (Benatar 2012). The QMG 
shall be administered at approximately the same time of day throughout the study by a properly 
trained evaluator at the protocol specified time points and pref erably by the same evaluator each 
time throughout the study. 
11.4. MGC Score  
The MGC is a validated assessment tool for measuring clinical status of subjects with MG (Burns 2011). The MGC assesses 10 important functional areas most frequently affected by MG: 
ocular (2 items), facial (1 item), bulbar (3 items), respiratory (1 item), axial (1 item), and gross 
motor (2 items) (refer to Appendix 7). The scales are weighted for clinical significance that 
incorporates subject-reported outcomes. Higher scores indicate more functional impairment. The range of total MGC score is 0 to 50. The MGC shall be administered at approximately the same 
time of day throughout the study by a properly trained evaluator at the protocol specified time points and preferably by the same evaluator each time throughout the study. 
11.5. Quality of Life Assessments  
11.5.1. MG-QOL 15  
The 15- item Myasthenia Gravis Qualify of Life scale (MG -QOL 15; refer to Appendix 3) is a 
health -related quality of life evaluative instrument specif ic to subjects with MG. MG -QOL 15 
was designed to provide information about subjects’ perception of impairment and disability and the degree to which disease manifestations are tolerated and to be easy to administer and interpret (Burns 2011). The MG- QOL 1 5 will be completed by the subject. Higher scores 
indicate greater extent of and dissatisfaction with MG -related dysfunction.  
11.5.2. Neuro -QOL Fatigue  
The Neuro- QOL Fatigue is a reliable and validated brief 19 -item survey of fatigue, completed by 
the subject (C ella 2010). Higher scores indicate greater fatigue and greater impact of MG on 
activities (refer to Appendix 4).  
11.5.3. EUROQOL  
The EQ -5D is a reliable and validated survey of health status in 5 areas: mobility, self- care, usual 
activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, completed by the subject (Szende 2004) . 
Page 75 of 114 
Alexion CONFIDENTIAL 
ECU -MG-302, Amendment 2   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
19 December  2016    
Each area has 3 levels: Level 1 (no problems), Level 2 (some problems), and Level 3 (e xtreme 
problems; refer to Appendix 10). The EQ VAS records the subject’s self -rated health on a 
vertical, 20 cm visual analogue scale where the endpoints are labeled “best imaginable health 
state,” marked as 100 and “worst imaginable health state,” marked as 0.  
11.6. Other Efficacy Assessments  
11.6.1. Negative Inspiratory Force (NIF) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)  
Subjects with increasingly severe MG can suffer from potentially fatal respiratory complications including profound respiratory muscle weakness. Respiratory function is monitored closely for evidence of respiratory failure in MG subjects and ventilator support is recommended in the 
event of consistent declines in serial measurements of FVC or NIF, loss of upper airway integrity 
(difficulty handling oral secretions, swallowing, or speaking) or in the setting of emerging 
respiratory failure. FVC as one of the test items in QMG will be performed when QMG is 
performed. NIF is to be performed using the NIF Meter.  
11.6.2. MGFA Post -Intervention Status  
The MG clinical state will be assessed using the MGFA Post -Intervention Status. Change in 
status categories of Improved, Unchanged, Worse, as well as Minimal Manifestation (MM) and 
Pharmacological Remission (PR) will be assessed and recorded by the PI or the same neurologist 
skilled in the evaluation of MG subjects throughout the trial. The sub- scores of MM (ie, MM-0, 
MM- 1, and MM -3) will not be used in this protocol. For the purposes of assessing MGFA- PIS 
status in this study, Baseline is defined as the pre -treatment baseline of ECU -MG-301.

12. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
12.1. Safety Parameters  
12.1.1. Vital Signs  
Vital signs will be measured at every visit and will include assessments of systolic and diastolic 
BP, temperature, RR, and HR. Vital signs will be obtained after the subject has been supine or seated for at least 5 minutes. Ideally, each subject’s BP should be measured using the same arm. 
Systolic and diastolic BPs will be documented in mmHg. Temperature will be obtained in 
degrees Celsius or Fahrenheit. HR will b e documented in beats per minute. 
12.1.2. Weight  
Body weight will be measured in pounds or kilograms. Body weight will be measured at Visits 1, 
16, 29, 55, 81, and 107 or ET Visit.  
12.1.3. Physical Examination  
A complete physical examination will be performed at Visit 1 6. The complete physical 
examination will include assessments of the following organ/body systems: skin, head, ears, 
eyes, nose, throat, neck, lymph nodes, chest, heart, abdomen, extremities, and general neurologic 
examination. For consistency, all efforts should be made to have the physical examination performed by the same qualified study staff. 
12.1.4. Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be conducted at Visits 1, 16, 29, 55, 81, and 107 or ET Visit. The 
Investigator or designee will be responsible for reviewing  the ECG to assess whether the ECG is 
within normal limits and to determine the clinical significance of the results. These assessments 
will be indicated on the CRF. For any clinically significant abnormal ECG results, the 
Investigator must contact the Sponsor to discuss the subject’s continued eligibility to participate in this protocol.  
12.1.5. Laboratory Assessments  
Subjects will have biologic samples collected for analysis of various parameters according to the Schedule of Assessments (refer to Section  7.2). The central laboratory will supply established or 
generally acknowledged methods, normal reference ranges, and shipping instructions.  
Chemistry panel,  complete blood count and hemolytic markers, renal function measures, and 
serum pregnancy test (refer to Appendix 5 for details) will be prepared and  shipped according to 
the instructions in the laboratory manual to the central laboratory. Samples will be analyzed at 
the central laboratory. Routine hematology laboratory assessment, including complete blood 
count (CBC), will be performed at various time points as specified by the protocol and should be reviewed as soon as the laboratory result is available.  
Page 77 of 114 
Alexion CONFIDENTIAL 
ECU -MG-302, Amendment 2   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
19 December  2016    
Blood samples for PK, PD, free C5, and blood samples for ADA analysis will be prepared and 
shipped according to the instructions in the laboratory m anual to the central laboratory. Sample 
analysis will be conducted by the Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee.  
Samples for AChR Abs test will be prepared and shipped according to the instructions in the 
laboratory manual. Sample analysis will be conducted at the central laboratory.  
Any clinically significant, abnormal laboratory result is to be reported as an AE. 
12.1.6. Columbia -Suicidal Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS (Posner 2011)since Last Visit (refer to Appendix 9) will be performed by the 
Investigator or a trained designee according to the Schedule of Assessments (refer to 
Section  7.2). The “since last visit” period refers to the last visit the C -SSRS was administered. 
This is to ensure that subjects who are experiencing suicidal ideation or behavior are properly 
recognized and adequately managed or referred for further evaluation. 
12.2. Adverse Events 
12.2.1. Detection of Adverse Events  
The Investigator is responsible for detecting, assessing, documenting, and reporting of all AEs. 
Adverse Events reported by the subject and/or parent or legal guardian and/or identified in 
response to an open-ended question from study personnel or revealed by observation, physical 
examination, or other study procedures must be collected and recorded a s described in 
Section  12.2.3. 
12.2.2. Definition of an Adverse Event  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence in a subject or clinical trial subj ect 
administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment.  
An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. 
Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an increase in 
frequency and/or intensity of the condition, and abnormal laboratory findings that are considered 
to be of clinical significance are all to be considered AEs.  
The definition of AE also covers medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse and abuse of the product.  
Situations where an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or convenience 
admission to a hospital), and anticipated day- to-day fluctuations of pre- existing disease(s) or 
condition(s) present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen are not AEs. 
12.2.2.1. Procedure  
Elective procedures that were pre- planned prior to the time that written ICF was obtained are not 
AEs. Any complication or worsening of a pre-existing condition leading to the procedure must 
Page 78 of 114 
Alexion CONFIDENTIAL 
ECU -MG-302, Amendment 2   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
19 December  2016    
be considered an AE. In addition, any AE that could occur as an outcome of the planned 
procedure should be considered as an AE. 
Diagnostic and therapeutic procedures (invasive and non-invasive) such as surgery or 
angiography should not be reported as an AE or Serious Adverse Event (SAE). However, the medical condition or the diagnosis that was responsible for the procedure should be recorded. 
The procedure should be recorded in the narrative as treatment for the AE or SAE 
(eg, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the procedure or treatment fo r an SAE of necrotic gall 
bladder). 
12.2.2.2. Abnormal Test Findings  
Abnormal test findings may be considered AEs or SAEs; however, Investigators are strongly 
encouraged to report the diagnosis, sign, or symptom instead of just the abnormal result. The criteria for an abnormal test finding being classified as an AE or SAE are as follows:  
• Test result is associated with a sign or symptom  
• Test result requires additional diagnostic testing  
• Test result requires a medical or surgical intervention  
• Test result leads to a change in study dosing outside of the protocol defined dosing or discontinuation from the trial 
• Test result requires significant additional treatment (ie, addition of new medication, 
significant increase in dose of current medication)  
12.2.2.3. Lack of Efficacy 
Since eculizumab treatment in subjects with refractory gMG is not an approved indication, lack 
of efficacy need not be reported as an AE.  
12.2.2.4. Events of Interest (EOI)  
Events of Interest (EOI) will be identified by the Sponsor during the evaluation of safety data for 
the Clinical Study Report. Significant AEs of particular clinical importance, other than SAEs and those AEs leading to discontinuation of the subject from the trial, will be classified as EOIs. For 
each EOI, a narrative may be written and included in the Clinical Study Report.  
12.2.3. Recording Adverse Events  
All observed or volunteered AEs regardless of causal relationship must be recorded and reported 
as described in the Section  12.2.7.  
As this is an extension to the ECU -MG-301 trial, subjects may sign the ICF for the extension 
trial while still enrolled in the ECU -MG-301 trial. AEs with an onset date before Study Day 1 of 
ECU- MG-302 will be recorded in the eCRF of the ECU- MG-301 trial regardless of when the 
subject signed the ICF for the ECU- MG-302 trial. Any ongoing AEs at the time of Study Day 1 
of the ECU- MG-302 trial will be recorded in the ECU -MG-302 eCRF (since this will be done 
automatically by the system, sites will not be required to record these data twice). AEs with an 
end date before Study Day 1 of ECU- MG-302 will be recorded only on the ECU- MG-301 CRF.

19 December  2016    
For all AEs the investigator must obtain adequate information for the following: 1) determine the 
outcome of the AE; 2) determine if the event meets criteria for a SAE; 3) assess the severity of 
the AE; and 4) determine the causality of the AE. For all AEs regardless of casual relationships 
the instigator must follow-up on the outcome of the event until the event or sequelae either resolve or stabilize.  
AEs spontaneously reported by the subject, and/or parent or legal guardian and/or identified in response to an open-ended question from study personnel, or revealed by observation will be recorded during the study period by the Investigator. AE information will be collected from the 
signing of informed consent until 8 weeks after the last dose of IP (safety follow-up visit). No 
time limit exists on reporting SAEs tha t are thought to be causally related to the IP. 
AEs must be documented in clear, unambiguous medical terms. Study personnel are advised not 
to use abbreviations or acronyms.  
For each AE record only the diagnosis on the AE page of eCRF, do not report the c haracteristic 
signs and symptoms of the diagnosis as additional AEs.  
If a diagnosis is not available record each sign and symptom as an AE, when a diagnosis 
becomes available, study personnel are to update the AE page of the eCRF with relevant diagnosis only.  
All AEs that later increase in the frequency and or severity (medical and scientific judgment should be exercised by the Investigator) will be considered new AEs and will be recorded on a new line on the AE page or the eCRF. 
Initial AE should be close d-out with an end date consistent with the date that the AE increased in 
frequency and/or severity and the new AE recorded on a new line of the AE page with onset date 
consistent with the date of increase in frequency and or severity.  
If an AE is a chronic or long-term medical condition diagnosed during the study (eg, hypertension, diabetes), once the patient is medically stable and/or a treatment plan is in place for the condition, the AE should be closed out with the end date consistent with the patient’s 
stability and/or the implementation of the treatment plan.  
12.2.4. Serious Adverse Event and SAE Criteria  
Any AE that fulfills any 1 of the criteria listed below must be recorded as an SAE. An SAE 
(experience) or reaction is described as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
1. Results in death  
2. Is life -threatening 
NOTE: The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypot hetically might have caused death if it were more severe.  
3. Hospitalization (Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing 
hospitalization, [AEs that are associated with hospitalization or prolongation of 
hospitalization are considered SAEs] . All admissions to a health care facility meet this 
criteria, even if less than 24 hours. Criteria for seriousness are also met if transfer within 
Page 80 of 114

ECU -MG-302, Amendment 2   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
19 December  2016    
the hospital is done to receive more intense medical / surgical care [eg, medical floor to 
the intensive car e unit (ICU)])  
• Hospitalization does not include the following: 
− Rehabilitation facility  
− Hospice facility  
− Nursing facility  
− Emergency Room 
− Same day surgery 
• Hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization not associated with an AE and is 
not an SAE, examples include: 
− Admission for a pre-existing condition not associated with either a new AE or 
with worsening of a pre-existing AE 
− Protocol-specified admission, pre-planned admission 
4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
5. Is a congenital anom aly/birth defect  
6. Is an important medical event  
NOTE: Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the subject 
or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. 
These should also usually be considered SAEs. Examples of such events are intensive tr eatment 
in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
12.2.4.1. Severity Assessment  
Adverse Event severity will be rated by the Investigator as mild, moderate, or severe using the 
following criteria:  
• Mild: events require minimal or no treatment and do not interfere with the subject’s 
daily activities.  
• Moderate: events result in a low level of inconvenience or concerns with the 
therapeutic measures. Moderate events may cause some interference with 
functioning. 
• Severe: events interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and may require systemic drug therapy or other treatment. Severe events are usually incapacitating.  
Change in severity of an AE should be documented based on specific instructions in the eCRF Completion Guidelines.  
Page 81 of 114 
Alexion CONFIDENTIAL 
ECU -MG-302, Amendment 2   Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc.  
19 December  2016    
Severity and seriousness must be differentiated. Severity describes the intensity of an AE, while 
the term seriousness refers to an AE that has met the criteri a for an SAE.  
12.2.4.2. Causality Assessment  
An Investigator causality assessment (Unrelated, Unlikely, Possible, Probable, or Definite) must be provided for all AEs, both serious and non- serious. This assessment must be recorded in the 
CRF and any additional SAE forms as appropriate. The definitions for the causality assessments 
appear below. 
• Not related (unrelated): This relationship suggests that there is no association between 
the IP and the reported event. 
• Unlikely related: This relationship suggests that the clinical picture is highly consistent with a cause other than the IP but attribution cannot be made with absolute certainty and a relationship between the IP and AE cannot be excluded with complete 
confidence. 
• Possibly related: This relationship suggests that treatment with the IP may have 
caused or contributed to the AE, ie, the event follows a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the time of drug administration and/or follows a known response pattern to the 
IP, but could also have been produced by other factors. 
• Probably related: This relationship suggests that a reasonable temporal sequence of 
the event with the IP administration exists and the likely association of the event with 
the IP. This will be based upon the known pharmacological action of the IP, known or previously reported adverse reactions to the IP or class of drugs, or judgment based 
on the Investigator’s clinical experience. 
• Definitely related: Temporal relationship to the IP, other conditions (concurrent 
illness, concurrent medication reaction , or progression/expression of disease state) do 
not appear to explain the event, corresponds with the known pharmaceutical profile, improvement on discontinuation or re- appearance on re -challenge.  
12.2.5. Expectedness Assessment of Serious Adverse Event  
The expectedness of a SAE is determined by the sponsor in the reference safety information 
(RSI). The RSI for interventional studies is the Investigator’s Brochure.  
12.2.6. Outcome  
If a subject experiences a SAE with an outcome of death:  
• The SAE resulting in death should have an outcome documented as death/fatal with an end date being the date of death. 
• If the subject had additional AE/SAEs that were ongoing at the time of death, these 
events would be documented as ongoing with no end date. 
• Only one event should have an outcome of death/fatal unless an autopsy report or investigator states otherwise.

19 December  2016    
12.2.6.1. Exposure during Pregnancy and Lactation  
Pregnancy data will be collected during this trial for all subjects.  
For all Alexion products, both in development or post approval, exposure during pregnancy must 
be recorded and followed. Exposure during pregnancy also called exposure in -utero  (EIU) can be 
the result of either maternal exposure or transmission of drug product via semen following 
paternal exposure.  
If a subject within this trial or a subject’s partner becomes or is found pregnant while treated or exposed to IP, the investigator must submit a pregnancy form to Alexion via the same method as SAE reporting. Pharmacovigilance will supply the Investigator with a copy of a “Pregnancy 
Reporting and Outcome Form / Breast Feeding.”  Pharmacovigilance must be notified via the 
same method as SAE reporting.  
Exposure of an infant to an Alexion product during breastfeeding would need to be reported in 
the “Pregnancy Reporting and Outcome Form / Breast Feeding,” and any AEs an infant may 
experience following breastfeeding needs to be reported to the Sponsor. 
The subject or female partner should be followed until the outcome of the pregnancy is known 
(spontaneous miscarriage, elective termi nation, normal birth, or congenital abnormality), even if 
the subject discontinued IP or discontinues from the trial. When the outcome of the pregnancy 
becomes known the form should be completed and returned to the Sponsor. If additional follow-
up is required, the Investigator will be requested to provide the information. 
Pregnancy in itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that IP may have 
interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. However, complications of 
pregnancy and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy are AEs and many may meet criteria for a SAE. 
Complications of pregnancy and abnormal outcomes of pregnancy such as ectopic pregnancy, spontaneous abortion, intrauterine fetal demise, neonatal death, or congenital anomaly would 
meet criteria of an SAE and thus, should be reported as an SAE. Elective abortions without 
complications should not be handled as AEs. 
12.2.7. Reporting of Adverse Event(s) & Serious Adverse Event(s) to Sponsor 
All non-serious AEs must be recorded in the eCRF upon awareness.  
All SAEs must be reported to the Sponsor immediately or within 24 hours of the investigator or 
the site staff becoming aware of the event, regardless of the presumed relationship to the IP. The 
Investigator must complete, sign, and date the SAE pages, verify the accuracy of the information 
recorded on the SAE pages with the corresponding source documents, and send a copy via Email 
or fax to contact information provided below: 
Email:   
  
Fax:     
When further information becomes available, the SAE Form should be updated with the new 
information and reported immediately via the same contact information.  
Additional follow-up information, if required or available, should be faxed to the Sponsor within 
24 hours of the investigator site or their staff becoming aware of this additional information via same contact information as above. Follow-up information should be recorded on a follow-up

SAE eCRF and placed with the original SAE information and kept with the appropriate section 
of the eCRF and/or trial file.  
These reporting timelines need to be followed for all initial SAE cases and follow -up versions of 
the initial cases.  
All SAEs (related and unrelated) will be recorded from the signing of ICF until 8 weeks 
following the end of treatment exposure (follow-up time required depending on half- life of IP 
following the last dose of IP).  
If the event meets fatal or life threatening SAE criteria, the investigator should notify the Sponsor  
immediately.  
For all SAEs the investigator must provide the following: 
• Appropriate and requested follow-up information in the time frame detailed above 
• Causality of the serious event(s) 
• Outcome of the serious event(s) 
• Medical records and  laboratory / diagnostic information 
12.2.8. Sponsor Reporting Requirements  
The sponsor or legal representative is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory authorities of SAE’s meeting the reporting criteria as per regional and local regulations. 
12.2.9. Investigator Reporting Requirements  
The Investigator must fulfill all local regulatory obligations required for study investigators. It is 
the PI’s responsibility to notify the Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) of all SAEs that occur at his or her site. Investigators will also be notified of all unexpected, serious, drug- related events (7/15 Day Safety Reports) that occur during the clinical 
trial. Each site is responsible for notifying its IRB or IEC of these additional SAE s.

14. ASSESSMENT OF PHARMA COKINETICS AND 
PHARMACODYNAMICS  
The population PK analysis of eculizumab in subjects with gMG will be performed to assess the 
concentration of eculizumab versus time. PK parameters such as maximum concentration as well as trough and peak eculizumab concentration during the induction and maintenance treatment 
phases will be reported. Clearance and terminal half -life will be estimated. PD analysis will be 
performed to assess pre- and post- treatment serum hemolytic activity and therefore C5 
complement activity inhibition. Free C5 concentration may also be measured.

15. STATISTICS  
15.1. General Considerations  
Analyses will be produced using the data from this trial alone (Extension Trial) as well as 
combined analyses that will include data from the ECU -MG-301 trial (Combined Trial 
Analyses). The analyses will include safety, efficacy, and PK/PD analyses. The SAP will co ver 
both the standalone trial analyses and the combined ECU- MG-301 and ECU- MG-302 trial 
analyses.  
Treatment groups will be indicated by eculizumab/eculizumab for the subjects originally 
randomized to the eculizumab arm in the ECU- MG-301 trial and placebo/eculizumab for the 
subjects originally randomized to the placebo arm in the ECU- MG-301 trial. The Extension Trial 
analyses will be presented by treatment group. The Combined Trial Analyses, where the data is aligned based on the subject’s first dose date of  eculizumab, will only be presented as 
1 combined eculizumab treatment group since all subjects will have received eculizumab.  
Baseline for the Extension Trial analyses is defined as the last available assessment prior to starting treatment with eculizumab  in ECU- MG-302. Baseline for the Combined Trial Analyses 
is defined as the last available assessment prior to starting treatment with eculizumab (that is, 
either in the ECU -MG-301 for subjects who received eculizumab in the ECU- MG-301 trial or in 
the ECU-MG-302 trial for subjects who received placebo in the ECU- MG-301 trial). For the 
Combined Trial Analyses, the analysis visits will be determined counting the subject’s first dose date (Day 1) with eculizumab regardless of the trial in which that first dose of eculizumab 
occurred and defining the visits based on this Day 1 going forward according to the schedule of assessments in both studies.  
15.2. Determination of Sample Size 
This is an extension trial to the ECU -MG-301 trial. Approximately 92 subjects will be enrolled 
in the ECU- MG-301 trial and may participate in this trial.  
15.3. Analyses Sets 
15.3.1. Full Analysis Set (FAS)  
15.3.1.1. Extension FAS Population  
The population on which primary, secondary, and tertiary efficacy analyses will be performed consists of all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of eculizumab in this extension trial and have a post- trial drug infusion efficacy assessment.  
15.3.1.2. Combined FAS Population  
The population on which primary, secondary, and tertiary efficacy analyses will be performed consists of all subjects who have received at least 1 dose of eculizumab in either ECU- MG-301 
or ECU- MG-302 and have a post- trial drug infusion efficacy assessment.

15.3.2. Per Protocol Set  
15.3.2.1. Extension Per -Protocol (PP) Population  
The PP population is a subset of the Extension Trial FAS population, excluding subjects with 
major extension trial protocol deviations. The Extension Trial PP population will include all 
subjects who: 
• Have no major protocol deviations or inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations that 
might potentially affect efficacy, and  
• Subjects who took at least 80% of the required eculizumab doses during participation in the extension trial.  
15.3.2.2. Combined PP Population  
The Combined PP population is a subset of the Combined FAS population, excluding subjects 
with major protocol deviations from either the ECU -MG-301 or ECU- MG-302 trial. The 
Combined PP population will include all subjects who: 
• Have no major protocol deviations or inclusion/exclusion criteria deviations that might potentially affect efficacy, and  
• Subjects who took at least 80% of the required eculizumab doses during participation 
in ECU- MG-301 and ECU- MG-302 trials. 
The Extension PP population as well as the Combined PP population will be determined prior to database lock. 
15.3.3. Safety Set  
Safety analyses will be perfo rmed on the Extension Safety Population from the ECU- MG-302 
trial and the Combined Safety Population from both the ECU- MG-301 and ECU- MG-302 trials. 
The Extension Safety Population includes all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of eculizumab 
in the ECU- MG-302 trial. The Combined Safety Population includes all subjects who receive at 
least 1 dose of eculizumab in either the ECU -MG-301 or ECU- MG-302 trial.  
15.3.4. Other Set  
PK/PD analyses will be performed on the PK/PD Analysis Set. The PK/PD Analyses Set will include subjects who have PK/PD data assessments during this trial.  
15.4. Subject Disposition and Treatment Compliance  
The number of subjects treated, completing the trial, and included in the safety and efficacy analysis sets will be tabulated by counts and percentage of subjects combined. Reasons for any 
subject withdrawals will be provided.  
Treatment compliance with IP will be summarized using descriptive statistics. The extra usage of 
IP for subjects who are treated with PE during the trial will be summarized  and listings will be 
produced.

15.5. Prior and Concomitant Medications  
Medications will be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHO drug), 
the most current version available at the time of the analyses.  
15.5.1. Extension Trial Analyses  
Concomitant medications taken during the extension trial will be summarized by treatment group 
and overall. Changes in IST usage (ie, increases, decreases, switching ISTs, etc.) will be 
summarized by treatment group and overall. Prior and concomitant medications will be listed in 
subject listings.  
15.5.2. Combined Trial Analyses  
Concomitant medications taken during eculizumab treatment will be summarized.  
15.6. Efficacy Analyses 
Efficacy analyses will be performed on the Extension Trial FAS (Extension FAS) population as 
well as th e Extension Trial Per-Protocol (Extension PP) population. In addition, efficacy 
analyses will be performed on the Combined FAS population as well as the Combined Per Protocol (Combined PP) population from the combined ECU- MG-301 trial and this Extension 
trial. 
15.6.1. Primary Efficacy Analyses 
15.6.1.1. Extension Trial Analyses  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline in the MG- ADL total score. The 
primary analysis for the change from baseline in MG -ADL total score at a particular visit will be 
based on the repeated measures models with effects for baseline MG -ADL and visit. Since the 
subjects randomized to eculizumab in the ECU -MG-301 study would have already received 26 
weeks of eculizumab treatment, a separate repeated measures model will be fit for the tw o 
treatment arms: placebo/eculizumab and eculizumab/eculizumab. Confidence intervals and p -
values will be presented by treatment group and visit. Graphical displays over time by treatment group will be produced. Missing primary endpoint assessments will not be imputed. 
15.6.1.2. Combined Trial Analyses  
The primary efficacy endpoint is change from baseline in the MG -ADL total score. The primary 
analysis for the change from baseline in MG -ADL total score at a particular visit will be based 
on the repeated measures model with effects for baseline MG -ADL and visit. Confidence 
intervals and p -values will be presented by visit. Graphical displays over time will be produced. 
Missing primary endpoint assessments will not be imputed. 15.6.2. Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
1. Change from baseline in QMG total score.

2. Proportion of subjects with at least a 3 -point reduction in the MG -ADL total score from 
baseline and with no rescue therapy. 
3. Proportion of subjects with at least a 5 -point reduction in the QMG total score from 
baseline and with no rescue therapy. 
4. Change from baseline in the Myasthenia Gravis Composite (MGC) score.  
5. Change from baseline in MG-QOL15.  
15.6.2.1. Extension Trial Analyses  
The secondary endpoints that involve changes from basel ine will be analyzed at a particular visit 
based on the repeated measures models with effects for the particular baseline covariate and 
visit. Since the subjects randomized to eculizumab in the ECU- MG-301 study would have 
already received 26 weeks of eculi zumab treatment, a separate repeated measures model will be 
fit for the two treatment arms: placebo/eculizumab and eculizumab/eculizumab. Confidence intervals and p -values will be presented by treatment group and visit. Graphical displays over 
time will be  produced by treatment group and visit. Missing secondary endpoint assessments will 
not be imputed. 
The proportion of subjects with at least a 3- point reduction in the MG -ADL total score from 
baseline with no rescue therapy will be summarized at each visit  for the placebo/eculizumab 
treatment group. Confidence intervals and p- values will be presented. Summaries of the number 
and percentage of subjects that improve, remain the same, or worsen in regard to MG- ADL 
assessments over time will be produced by treatment group as specified in the SAP. Graphical 
displays over time maybe produced by treatment group. 
The proportion of subjects with at least a 5-point reduction in the QMG total score from baseline 
with no rescue therapy will be summarized at each visit f or the placebo/eculizumab treatment 
group. Confidence intervals and p- values will be presented. Summaries of the number and 
percentage of subjects that improve, remain the same, or worsen in regard to QMG assessments over time will be produced by treatment group as specified in the SAP. Graphical displays over time may be produced by treatment group. 
15.6.2.2. Combined Trial Analyses  
The secondary endpoints that involve changes from baseline will be analyzed at a particular visit 
based on the repeated measures model with effects for the particular baseline covariate and visit. Confidence intervals and p- values will be presented by visit. Graphical displays over time will be 
produced. Missing secondary endpoint assessments will not be imputed. 
The proportion of subject s with at least a 3 -point reduction in the MG -ADL total score from 
baseline with no rescue therapy will be summarized at each visit. Confidence intervals and p -
values will be presented. Summaries of the number and percentage of subjects that improve, 
remai n the same, or worsen in regard to MG- ADL assessments over time will be produced as 
specified in the SAP. Graphical displays over time may be produced. 
The proportion of subjects with at least a 5-point reduction in the QMG total score from baseline 
with n o rescue therapy will be summarized at each visit. Confidence intervals and p -values will 
be presented. Summaries of the number and percentage of subjects that improve, remain the

same, or worsen in regard to QMG assessments over time will be produced as specified in the 
SAP. Graphical displays over time maybe produced. 
15.6.3. Tertiary Efficacy Analyses  
The tertiary efficacy endpoints are:  
1. Time to response as measured by the reduction in the MG -ADL total score (3 -point 
reduction from baseline ). 
2. Change from baseline in Neuro-QOL Fatigue.  
3. Change from baseline in EQ-5D.  
4. Change from baseline in the MG-ADL individual items and change from baseline in the 
MG-ADL sub -categories for the bulbar (items 1, 2 and 3), respiratory (item 4), limb 
(items 5 and  6) and ocular (items 7 and 8) in subjects with abnormal baseline score for 
the particular item or sub -category. 
15.6.3.1. Extension Trial Analyses  
The time to response on the MG- ADL total score (3 -point reduction in MG- ADL from baseline) 
will be summarized for the placebo/eculizumab treatment group. A Kaplan Meier curve will be 
produced. 
The tertiary endpoints that involve changes from baseline will be analyzed at a particular visit 
based on the repeated measures models with effects for the particular baseline covar iate and 
visit. Since the subjects randomized to eculizumab in the ECU- MG-301 study would have 
already received 26 weeks of eculizumab treatment, a separate repeated measures model will be fit for the two treatment arms: placebo/eculizumab and eculizumab/eculizumab. Confidence intervals and p -values will be presented by treatment group and visit. Missing tertiary endpoint 
assessments will not be imputed.  
A summary of subjects shifting from abnormal to normal or from normal to abnormal for NIF and FVC will b e presented by treatment group and visit. A summary of subjects shifting from 
abnormal to normal or from normal to abnormal for particular MG -ADL individual items and 
sub-categories will be produced by treatment group and visit. 
15.6.3.2. Combined Trial Analyses  
The time to response on the MG- ADL total score (3 -point reduction in MG- ADL from baseline) 
will be summarized. A Kaplan Meier curve will be produced.  
The tertiary endpoints that involve changes from baseline will be analyzed at a particular visit 
based on the repeated measures model with effects for the particular baseline covariate and visit. 
Confidence intervals and p-values will be presented by visit. Missing tertiary endpoint 
assessments will not be imputed.  
A summary of subjects shifting from abnormal to normal or from normal to abnormal for NIF 
and FVC will be presented. A summary of subjects shifting from abnormal to normal or from 
normal to abnormal for particular MG -ADL individual items and sub- categories will be 
produced.

15.7. Safety Analyses  
Safety analyses will be performed on the Extension Safety Population and the Combined Safety 
Population from both studies. The Extension Safety Population includes all subjects who receive 
at least 1 dose of eculizumab in ECU -MG-302 trial. The Combined Safety Population includes 
all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of eculizumab in the ECU -MG-301 trial or ECU- MG-302 
trial. 
15.7.1. Physical Examinations and Vital Signs  
Physical examinations will be summarized by visit. Vital signs (systolic and diastolic BP, temperature, and  sitting or lying HR), weight and changes from baseline in vital signs (including

16. DIRECT ACCESS TO SOU RCE DATA/DOCUMENTS  
16.1. Trial Monitoring  
Before an investigational site can enter a subject into the trial, a representative of Alexion 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. or its designee will visit the investigational trial site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of the facilities  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) and other personnel their responsibilities with regard to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of the Sponsor or its designee or its representatives. This will be documented in a Clinical Trial Agreement between the 
Sponsor or its designee and the Investigator. 
During the trial, the Sponsor, its designee or representative will have regular contacts with the 
investigational site, for the following:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s).  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable.  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being 
accurately recorded in the CRFs, and that IP accountability checks are being 
performed. 
• Perform source data verification. This includes a comparison of the data in the CRFs 
with the subject’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records 
relevant to the trial. This will require direct access to all original records for each subject (for example, clinic charts).  
• Record and report any protocol deviations not previously sent to the Sponsor or its designee.  
• Confirm AEs and SAEs have been properly documented on CRFs and confirm any 
SAEs have been forwarded to the Sponsor or its designee and those SAEs that met 
criteria for reporting have been forwarded to the IRB/IEC. 
The monitor will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff needs 
information or advice. 
16.2. Audits and Inspections  
Authorized representatives of the Sponsor or designee, a regulatory authority, an IEC or an IRB may visit the site to perform audits or inspections, including source data verification. The 
purpose of an audit or inspection is to systematically and independently examine all trial -related 
activities and documents to determine whether these activities were conducted, and data were 
recorded, analyzed, and accurately reported according to the protocol, GCP guidelines of the 
ICH, and any applicable regulatory requirements. The investigator should contact the sponsor or designee immediately if contacted by a regulatory agency about an  inspection.

To help people say how good or bad a health state is,  
we have drawn a scale (rather like a thermometer) on  
which the best state you can imagine is marked 100 and  
the worst state you can imagine is marked 0. 
We would like you to indicate on this scale how good  
or bad your own health is today, in your opinion. Please do this by drawing a line from the box below to 
whichever point on the scale indicates how good or  
bad your health state is today.

APPENDIX 11.  COLLECTION OF FOLLOW -UP INFORMATION FROM 
PATIENTS WHO WITHDRAW FROM THE STUDY 
To gain understanding of the patient’s post- treatment disease status, the Sponsor may request 
additional follow-up information. An updated ICF (and/or an ICF Addendum) will be provided 
to all patients describing the reason for collecting follow-up information, the information that 
will be collected, and how the information will be used . The updated ICF (and/or ICF 
Addendum) will also be provided to discontinued patients , subject to IRB/IEC approval.  The 
updated ICF (and/or ICF Addendum) will clearly state that the patient has the option to accept or reject, and that either decision will have no impact on their medical benefits. Prior to collecting 
any follow-up information, the updated ICF (and/or ICF Addendum) must be signed by the patient.  
The Sponsor may obtain patient post- treatment data by querying the patient’ s medical records, 
through the study physician or the patient’s current treating physician. The follow-up da ta to be 
collected from the physician include the following:  
• How has the patient’s MG status changed since they left Study ECU- MG-302 
(better/worse/unchanged); if better or worse, what are the changes 
• What are the patient’s current MG medications and the doses, and MG medication history 
since leaving Study ECU- MG-302 
• Has the patient experienced any exacerbations (Clinical Deteriorations) of MG, or any myasthenic crises since leaving Study ECU -MG-302; if so how many times 
• Has the patient experienced any MG -related hospitalizations  since leaving Study ECU-
MG-302; if so how many times 
• Has the patient required rescue treatment with IV acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, 
corticosteroids, plasma exchange or IVIg since leaving Study ECU- MG-302; if so how 
many times  
• Has the patient had any assessments using the MG -ADL, QMG, MGC or the 
MG-QOL15 sca le; if so, what are the results , and was it administered by the same person 
who did the assessment during the clinical trial 
• Have there been any changes in non-drug therapy.

PI/Site :   
Objective:  
 This pilot study will evaluate the efficiency impact of conducting active temperature management during cardiac ablation procedures.  
Patient Population:  This study is intended for patients undergoing left atrial ablation including pulmonary vein isolation for the treatment of atrial fibrillation.  
Study Design : Prospective,  single center pilot  study  
Study Conduct:  This prospective interventional pilot  study will use the FDA cleared Attune 
Medical esophageal heat transfer device ( ensoETM ) to actively cool the 
esophagus  when RF ablation s are performed on the posterior atrial wall 
and to actively warm the patient at al l other times to minimize 
perioperative hypothermia.  
In consented participants , following induction of anesthesia and 
intubation, the ensoETM  will be placed into the esophagus according to 
the device Instructions  and maintained at 40-42°C. Active cooling will be 
initiated approximately 15  minutes prior to any ablation s placed on the 
posterior left atrium. The ensoETM  will continuously circulate 4 -6°C water 
inside the device  during all ablations directed at the posterior wall of the 
atrium. Once all ablations to the posterior wall of the  atrium are complete, 
the water set-point will be returned to nominal until the conclusion of the 
procedure.   Total procedure time from trans -septal puncture to pulmonary 
vein isolation (PVI) will be recorded.   
All patients will be followed up in total for 6 weeks (Long Term FU visit) after the procedure to document any clinical complication related to 
thermal esophageal injuries if applicable . 
Study Duration : The study duration is projected to be approximately 145 days (estimated 3-month enrollment and a 6 -week long term follow -up window).  
Inclusion Criteria : 1. Adult patients (age over 18 years)

  6 3  INTRODUCTION  
3.1 Background  
 
Left atrial catheter ablation including pulmonary vein isolation  is a standard therapy in the management 
of symptomatic  atrial fibrillation; however thermal esophageal injury is a known potential consequence 
of this procedure.1-4 Delivery of radiofrequency (RF) energy necessary to perform left atrial ablation has 
the potential to cause injury to the nearby esophagus including ulceration, hematoma, spasm, esophageal motility  disorders , and , in the most extreme case,  atrial- esophage al fistula.
1,2  Esophageal 
mucosal lesions are the likely precursor to AEF, and esophageal mucosal lesions have been  detected on 
post -ablation  endoscopy after pulmonary vein isolation  with an incidence ranging from 3% to 60%.5-8 
Active esophageal cooling during RF ablation as a means of esophageal injury  prevention  has been 
investigated through  mathematical mode ls, pre -clinical studies , and in clinical trials. Existing data 
support the efficacy of this approach, but  the practice has  not been widely adopt ed due to lack of a 
commercially available device . 9-16   
A new esophageal heat transfer device ( ensoETM , Attune Medical, Chicago, IL, USA) was recently 
commercialized for a variety of patient temperature management needs.17-22  This device provides a 
closed -circuit water flow through a multi- channel cylindrical silicone tube placed in the esophagus 
analogously to a standard orogastric tube. Warming or cooling a patient is accomplished through 
conductive heat transfer across the esophagus and convective heat transfer through the device.20,23  
Esophageal heat exchange is  designed to take advantage of the favorable heat exchange environment 
created by proximity to the heart and great vessels. The device includes an independent lumen to decompress the stomach and avoid distention of the esophagus away from the device , which  ensures 
good contact with the esophageal mucosa, thus maximizing heat transfer between the device and the patient. The esophageal heat transfer device is made of standard medical- grade silicone and is generally 
similar in shape and size to gastric tubes c urrently used and other devices routinely placed in the 
esophagus (esophagogastroduodenoscopy scopes, transesophageal echocardiography scopes, Ewald tubes, etc.).   
Clinical studies in a variety of scenarios have shown strong support for the efficacy and s afety of the 
esophageal heat transfer device  in critical care and OR settings .
20,24- 34 Specifically, the device has 
demonstrated effectiveness in the intentional reduction of patient body temperature below normal for conditions such as cardiac arrest,
19,24,27 the reduction of patient temperature from hyperthermic levels 
to normal range, 35 the prevention of inadvertent perioperative hypothermia, 22,36 and the reduction of 
elevated intracranial pressure.25 
A number of studies of the device have been completed , or are in progress, evaluat ing feasibility, safety, 
and effect size  of esophageal protection during both RF ablation and cryoablation, including pre -clinical 
models  and formal randomized  clinical trials .37-42  Because the impact on procedural time has not yet 
been evaluated, the purpose of this study is to determine the impact on procedural efficiency of ablation procedures performed  using esophageal heat transfe r with the ensoETM .

  7 3.2 Study Objective, Hypothesis a nd Rationale   
The objective of this study is to evaluate the impact on procedural efficiency of ablation procedures 
performed using esophageal heat transfer to cool the esophagus dur ing left atrial RF ablation.  This 
study is designed to measure procedural time of RF ablation to obtain pulmonary vein isolation (PVI)  and 
serve as a pilot to compare to historical controls  and enable adequate determination of sample size 
requirements for  a subsequent larger study .  The hypothesis is that  active esophageal cooling will show 
a reduced procedural time when compared to standard of care using esophageal temperature 
monitoring.   
3.3 Primary Endpoint  
Procedural time, from trans -septal puncture to attainment of successful PVI .  Ablation will be performed 
as standard procedure with pre -specified ablation technology on the posterior left atrial wall using 
standard ablation settings.  
 
4 STUDY PROTOCOL  
4.1 Study Design  
This study is  a prospective,  pilot study using the Attune Medical e nsoETM esophageal heat transfer 
device to actively cool the esophagus during RF ablation procedures. This design is  appropriate to gather 
the data needed regarding overall procedural time, compare this to historical c ontrols , and estimate a 
sample size for a larger study powered for statistical significance.   
Once patient consent is obtained, the subject will undergo p reparation and anesthesia  procedures 
follow ing standard practice. Once  the patient is intubated , the esophageal heat transfer device will be 
placed into the esophagus according to the IFU.  The device will remain in place until the ablation 
procedure is completed and will be removed before extubation . Posterior left atrial wall ablation using 
standard para meters  will only be performed when the ensoETM  has reached a temperature of 4 -6°C for at 
least 2 minutes. The device will be set to neutral or warming  temperature (37 -42°C) during other 
aspects of the procedure  (such as mapping and anterior wall ablations) . 
 
4.2 Study Device Description and Intended Use  
The ensoETM is a non -sterile multi -lumen silicone tube placed in the esophagus for the purpose of 
cooling or warming a patient while simultaneously allowing gastric decompression and drainage. Modulation and con trol of the patient’s temperature is achieved by connecting the ensoETM  to an 
external heat exchanger. Two lumens connect to the external heat exchanger, while a third central 
lumen provides stomach access for connection to a fluid collection device with l ow intermittent suction

  8 for gastric decompression  (Figure 1) . The ensoETM  is made of standard medical- grade silicone. It is a 
single -use, disposable, non -implantable device with an intended duration of use of 72  hours or less. 
Distilled water circulates inside  the ensoETM , water does not come into contact with the patient.

The ensoETM  has received FDA clearance  and its intended use  is as a thermal re gulating device intended 
to connect to an external heat exchanger in order to modulate and control patient temperature in the 
operating room, recovery room, emergency room, or intensive care unit.  
 
4.3 Installation Use and Storage of the Device  
Detailed operation of the system is included in the IFU. The ensoETM device should be stored in a dry 
and clean place  and handled according to the IFU. The research team will ensure that the heat exchange 
unit will be operated in accordance with the approp riate IFU.  
The Company  will provide on -site support for training and operation of the ensoETM according to the 
IFU. As the insertion procedure is similar to placing a standard orogastric tube, it is expected that 
insertion of the probe and operation of the  ensoETM  will require limited training and ongoing support, 
however, the Company  will support cases as requested.

 ________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
  10 This study will require subject s to have the ensoETM  inserted intra -orally prior to the  ablation  
procedure. As the ensoETM  is not routinely used at this Center , detailed  information regarding risks are 
included in the Informed Consent Form presented to subjects enrolling in the study.  
This study will require that the operating physician carry out the standard of care  for AF ablation. 
Ultimately, the number and location of ablation lesions and determination of whether to end the 
procedure will be at the discretion of the operating physician  and will be based on the Center´s 
standards as used in recent years . Subjects will be required to sign an Informed Consent Form detailing 
the potential risks and benefits of their study participation. A stu dy subject can withdraw consent at any 
time, and for any reason.  All patients included will also sign a separate  informed consent for AF ablation 
procedure as standard in the Center.  
5.3 Data De -Identification  
Except where required by law, information shared with persons and organizations outside of the investigational site will not identify the subject by name, government identification number, address, 
telephone number, or any other direct personal identifier. To ensure that subject identification is kept 
confidential, a subject’s unique identification number will be employed. At the investigational site, a 
confidential file of informed consent forms and anonymization code numbers will be retained, 
accessible to the Principal Investigator and/or designee and o ther authorized personnel. The subject’s 
unique identification number will be employed on all source documentation that is used for data review 
and analysis .  
5.4 Data Management  
Data entry and development of the primary database of the study will be performed  by PI or his 
designee (s). Data inserted into the database will be reviewed after 10 cases , based on original patient 
documentation. In case of data queries, PI will resolve based on original patient documentation.  
The database is password secured and has  an audit trail. Changes to the database can only be made by 
the delegated study group. Verification of data will be done after 10 cases based on original patient 
documentation. PI or designee will also be responsible for auditing the database and confirming the overall integrity of the database.  
5.4.1  Case Report Forms  
The Center will perform primary data collection based on source -documented hospital chart reviews 
and data transcribed or exported from the mapping and navigation system . Temperature set point and 
timing will be transcribed  and annotated into the mapping software .

  11 final analysis although deviations will be documented and summarized in final reports. Any deviations 
that concern patient safety and/or the rights of a study subject will be reported to  IRB within 24 hours.  
5.4.2  Monitoring Plan  
The investig ator and research team will allocate adequate time for monitoring activities  and monitoring 
of all data will be performed on a regular basis throughout the study .  For monitoring access to all the 
above noted study -related documents and study related facil ities (e.g. clinical EP laboratories) will be 
granted. Monitoring will be performed by a committee not involved in the study conduct.  
5.4.3  Protocol Deviations and Modifications  
Any changes to the approved clinical study must originate from Sponsor in the form o f a protocol 
amendment that must be submitted to the relevant IRB contact . Protocol deviations should be avoided 
by the PI and site supporting staff. Any deviation from the protocol should be reported to the Sponsor. Any deviation to the clinical study wil l be reported to the ethical committee in accordance with local 
requirements. In the situation where deviating from the protocol is in order to protect the life or 
physical wellbeing of the subjects, which are considered emergency deviations, these should be 
reported to the Sponsor and Ethical Committee per their local guidelines.  
A deviation is any variance from the Investigational Plan requirements (e.g., failure to obtain informed consent, failure to meet inclusion/ exclusion, etc.).  
5.4.4  Data Analysis and Ac ceptance  
All analyses will be performed using validated  statistical software. In general, the study endpoints will be 
assessed relative to the study objectives. Patient data listings and tabular and graphical presentations of baseline and operative charact eristics and outcome results will be created.   
5.4.4.1  Sample Size Determination   
As a pilot study, the data obtained will provide information necessary for a formal sample size estimate for a subsequent larger study .  A sample size of 20 patients is estimated to be sufficient to provide a 95% 
confidence interval of +/ - 15 minutes around mean procedure duration, assuming a procedure duration 
of 95 minutes with a standard deviation of 20 minutes.  
5.4.4.2  Analysis Populations  
Safety Population 
All enrolled subjects who underwent a catheter ablation of persistent and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 
procedure will be included in the safety population.

 ________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
  12 Evaluable Population 
All enrolled subjects who have received  catheter ablation of persistent and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation 
with complete ablation data and procedural timing will be included in the evaluable population.  
Primary Endpoint Analysis  
The primary endpoint of this study will be the total time of acti ve ablation procedure, measured from 
trans -septal puncture to achievement of PVI.  All ablations at posterior left atrial wall during AF ablation 
are performed under standardized conditions including predefined sets of ablation parameters as per 
standard of care . 
Secondary Endpoint Analysis  
Secondary endpoints include:  
1. Total procedure time (from patient entry to EP  lab until discharge to PACU)  
2. Number of procedural pauses during left atrial instrumentation  
 
5.4.4.3  Safety Analysis  
All safety -related issues related t o the usage of the device will be recorded and documented as device -
related AEs  (ADE ). All safety analyses will be performed on the safety population. No imputation of 
missing observations will be  performed . The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities  (MedDRA) 
version 13.0 or later will be used to code all AEs to a system organ class (SOC) and a preferred term (PT) within the SOC.  
The incidence and frequency of AEs will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term for all 
AEs, device -related  AEs (with  relationship to study devices and/o r study -device -related  procedure), 
serious device -related AEs  and device -related AEs leading to study withdrawal and death. The incidence 
of ADEs  will also be tabulated by seriousness, severity, and relationship to study devices and/or 
procedure.  
No AEs will be recorded for study purpose s that are not specifically device -related (e.g. arrhythmia 
recurrences) as this is not within the scope of the study.

the informed consent form has been executed.  
6.2 Index Procedure  
Cardiac Ablation 
Only participant s who  are scheduled for  a pulmonary vein isolation  are eligible for participation in the 
trial. Cardiac ablation will be performed using irrigated contact -force radiofrequency ablation catheters 
with a maximum power of 50W when ablating at the posterior wall. Ablation will be performed to 
electrically isolate the pulmonary veins from the left atrial myocardium. The location of the catheter in 
relation to the posterior left atrial wall is continuously determined in real- time electroanatomic maps of 
the left atrium.  
Active Esophageal Cooling  
In consented pa tients, the ensoETM  esophageal heat transfer device will be inserted according to 
standard protocol during preparation for the ablation procedure, following intubation . The ensoETM  is a 
Clinical Protocol:  University of Iowa

 ________________________________________________________________________________________________________  
 
  14 non-sterile multi- lumen silicone tube placed in the esophagus much like a standard orogastric tube . The 
ensoETM  holds FDA clearance  and is intended for use as a thermal regulating device intended to 
connect to an external heat exchanger in order to modulat e and control patient temperature. The 
device will remain in place until the ablation procedure is completed. P atients will undergo posterior 
wall ablation when the ensoETM  device has reached a temperature of 4 -6°C for at least 2 minutes. The 
device will b e set to neutral body  temperature (no cooling) during other aspects of the procedure.  
 
 
Figure 2: The esophageal heat transfer device is constructed from medical grade silicone with an outer 
diameter of ~12mm (36 Fr), length of 758mm, and circulating wat er volume of 55mL.  The device is 
placed similarly to an orogastric tube. Distilled  water circulates inside the tube (never entering the 
patient), directly cooling the esophageal tissue.

7 RISK MANAGEMENT  
7.1 RISK ANALYSIS  
Risk analysis associated with the ensoETM  device has been performed in accordance with ISO 14971: 
Application of Risk Management to Medical Devices.  
Risk Management activities include  
• Identification of intended use  
• Identification of Hazards – Biological, En vironmental, Radiation  
• Estimation of Risk

  17 • Risk Evaluation  
• Risk Control  
• Evaluation of overall residual risk  
• Risk Management Report  
The Attune Medical ensoETM  has received CE Marking  and FDA 510(k) clearance,  and its intended use is 
as a thermal regulating device intended to connect to an external heat exchanger in order to modulate 
and control patient temperature. The ensoETM  is constructed from medical grade silicone with an outer 
diameter of 12mm (36 Fr), length of 758mm, and circulating water volume of 55 mL. Distilled  water 
circulates inside the tube (never entering the patient), directly cooling the esophageal tissue.  The device 
is placed similarly to an orogastric tube.  Risks associated with ensoETM  use are similar to those of 
standard orogastric tubes.  
The overall risks associated with this study are the same risks associated with standard catheter 
ablation, including standard esophageal temperature monitoring.  
7.1.1  Risk Analysis of esophageal damage related to AF ablation  
Esophageal injury is a well- established risk associated with AF ablation procedures. Current strategies to 
minimize injury risk include reducing energy and force while ablating the left posterior atrial wall and 
luminal esophageal temperature (LET) monitoring. Neither strategy actively prevents esophageal injury, as esophageal thermal damage related to AF ablation procedures can be detected in up to 60% of 
asymptomatic patients undergoing post -ablation endoscopy . 
However, early studies of active esophageal cooling have demonstrated various levels of protection . 
These studies encompass many devices  (primarily with various balloon configurations) and have  been 
investigated with mathematical modeling, preclinical models, and in clinical trials. The preponderanc e of 
data sho ws the effectiveness of the approach,  especially among high flow rate devices,  but the 
applications were  limitations by the  implementations  investigated (early prototypes were complicated 
to use or  deformed the atria from ballooning of the dev ice).  
The ensoETM  accommodates high flow rate without causing esophageal deformity. The device has been 
used safely in thousands of critical care patients. We expect there to be no incremental risk associated with the use of the ensoETM  during compared to the existing approach. Unlike temperature monitoring 
strategies that prompt reactive strategies (such as pausing ablation)  this approach may actively reduce  
tissue damage  while improving procedural efficiency and reducing the time under anesthesia .  
7.1.2  Risk Benefit Summary  
During this pilot study, the ensoETM  will be inserted into the esophagus intra -orally while patients are 
under general anesthesia. The risks to the patient are expected to be similar or the same as those 
associated with the introduction of a ny standard orogastric tube.

  18 Only personnel with knowledge of and experience in placing gastric tubes  will be involved in the study. 
Patients will be continuously monitored throughout the procedure.  
All patients will be treated with standard of care techn ology and ablation settings. All procedures 
performed during the study are part of the standard approach to AF ablation patients at the Center.  
Subjects might not directly benefit from participation in the trial, but the findings of the current study 
will improve the knowledge of esophageal thermal lesion prevention strategies. Information gained in 
the current study will be applied to larger patient cohorts in the future, in an effort to reduce 
esophageal thermal injury and mak e AF ablation safer  and more  efficient . 
AF ablations will be monitored in this study with the safest technology currently available and patients 
will receive optimized treatments using standard of care technology. All patients will be closely 
monitored and receive optimum diagnostic and therapeutic management.

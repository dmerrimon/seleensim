General Study Design:
This is a Phase 3, 21- week, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel 
group stud y to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of TE V-50717 administered as oral tablets at a 
starting dose of 6 mg once daily  in patients (age 6 through 18 y ears) with DCP with predominant 
choreiform movement disorder, who have had CP sy mptoms, of a non- progressive nature, since 
infancy  (≤2 years of age). “Predominant” in this instance indicates that the choreiform movement 
disorder is the main cause of impairment or distress. 
The study  will consist of a screening period (up to 31 days) and a double -blind treatment period 
including a titration period (7 we eks) and a maintenance period (8 weeks), followed by  a 
washout period of 1 week, and a follow -up telephone contact 1 week after the washout period. 
Throughout the stud y, patients will interact regularly with investigational center personnel, in -
clinic and by telephone (with non -recording live video), for the evaluation of safet y/tolerability , 
dyskinesia severit y, and behavioral status (in -clinic only ). 
For the purposes of this protocol, a caregiver is defined as an adult who is familiar with the 
patient and is responsible for dail y care, enabling that person to effectivel y complete the protocol 
requirements. The caregiver accompanies the patient to the v isits and provides input to the 
relevant scales as required by  the protocol. 

Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
10For patients who are minors, the caregiver is t ypically a parent or a legall y accepted 
representative. In some countries, an adult (such as grandparent or nurse) can be appointed by 
the parent or legall y accepted representative (as per local regulations and laws) and would take 
over this responsibility  as a caregiver. The parent or legally  accepted representative only  has to 
sign the parent/legall y accepted representative informed consent form (ICF) and not the 
caregiver ICF.
For adult patients, a caregiver must be appointed by  the patient; this can be the parent, a legall y 
accepted representative, or other adult, as appropriate and according to local laws and 
regulations.
For pati ents who are minors, certain responsibilities in the protocol can only  be completed by  the 
parent/legall y accepted representative, ie, informed consent, withdrawal of consent, requests for 
discontinuation of the I MP, or withdrawal from the study  for any  reason. To further clarify , the 
caregiver is not allowed to make decisions on the child’s health or where “parent/legall y 
accepted representative” is specificall y indicated in the protocol.
At the baseline visit (day 1), patients will be randomly  assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups with 
TEV -50717 IMP or placebo IMP in a 2:1 ratio stratified by  age at baseline (6 to <12 y ears; 
12through 18 years, inclusive) and region (US; non- US). IMP will be titrated during the 
double -blind treatment period starting with 6 mg of TEV -50717 or matching placebo IMP in the 
morning of day  2. Patients in the highest bod y weight group ( ≥40 kg/88 lbs) will start an evening 
administration from day  3 and for the remainder of the first week. TEV -50717 daily  doses of 
12mg and higher wi ll be administered as 2 divided equal doses, approximately  8 to 10 hours 
apart during the day . The number of matching placebo IMP tablets will be increased accordingl y. 
Dose increases may  not occur more frequentl y than every 5 days, except for patients 
≥40kg/88 lbs. For patients ≥40kg/88 lbs, the first dose increase should be performed in an 
interval less than 5 day s, only  once, on day  3. During the titration period, the dose of IMP will be 
adjusted according to the titrations scheme to identify  a dose level that optimally  reduces 
dyskinesia (as determined by  the investigator, as indicated b y a reduction in the Clinical Global 
Impression of Improvement [CGI -I]) and is well tolerated. If a patient experiences a “clinicall y 
significant” adverse event attributable to the I MP, the investigator will first determine if a dose 
reduction (to the previous dose level) or suspension is necessary and possible. After titration, 
patients will remain at their optimal dose for the length of the maintenance period.
Screen ing period (up to 31 days): After written informed consent/assent, as appropriate, is 
obtained, patients who are stable from a medical and psy chiatric standpoint will undergo a 
screening evaluation, including medical history ; phy sical and neurological examination; 
laboratory  testing; 12 -lead electrocardiogram (ECG); along with Movement Disorder -Childhood 
Rating Scale (MD -CRS) part II (ph ysician rated, with video recording, centrally  read with video 
review, centrall y read b y Enrollment Adjudication Board [EAB]) to assess severit y of 
dyskinesia; Clinical Global I mpression of Severity (CGI -S) to assess clinical impression of DCP
severit y, comorbid CP symptoms, and behavioral status; children’s Columbia -Suicide Severit y 
Rating Scale (C -SSRS); assessment of drug- induced parkinsonism according to the 
Extrapy ramidal S ymptom Rating Scale (subscales I  and II; ESRS); assessment of change in 
behavior according to the Child Behavior Checklist (for ages 6 -18) ( CBCL) questionnaire; and 
assessment of sedation according to t
he Epworth Sleepiness Scale (for children and adolescents)
(ESS) questionnaire . Screening may  be conducted over 2 separate visits at the discretion of the 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
11investigator. The diagnosis of CP and DCP will be established based on clinical features as 
described in the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The EAB will also confirm, based on video 
recordings, that choreiform is clinically  the predominant movement disorder of the patient’s 
DCP. EAB assessment results will be available to the investigator prior to baseline and 
randomization. The MD- CRS part II will be administered b y the investigational center ph ysician 
and video review, for central -blinded reading. In this study, the MD -CRS part II will be scored 
only based on chorea.
Titration period (7 weeks) : Patients w ho remain eligible for participation in the study  will be 
randomized at the baseline visit (day  1) and instructed to take the first dose of blinded IMP the 
following morning with food (eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empty  stomach. The 
titration scheme and maximum dose will be determined by  body  weight and cy tochrome P450 
2D6 (CYP2D6) impairment status at baseline. Patients will be classified as CYP2D6 impaired if 
they are receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor or are a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer. At the baseline 
visit, a telephone for non -recording live video will be provided to the patient and caregiver. 
Patients and their caregiver will interact weekl y with the investigator/staff, either by telephone 
contact (with non -recording live video) or clinic visit from week 1 through week 7 of the titration 
period, in order to evaluate safet y/tolerabilit y and establish a dose of IMP that optimally  reduces 
the severit y of d yskinetic involuntary  movements (clinically  meaningful reduction in dy skinesia, 
as indica ted b y a reduction in the CGI- I) and is well tolerated. Safet y/tolerability  in-clinic 
evaluations during titration include assessment of vital signs, monitoring for adverse events and 
concomitant medications, 12 -lead ECGs, identify ingsubjects at risk for suicide according to the 
C-SSRS questionnaire, assessment of drug -induced parkinsonism according to the ESRS 
(subscales I and II), assessment of change in behavior according to the CBCL questionnaire, and 
assessment of sedation according to the ESS questio nnaire . If a patient experiences a “clinically  
significant” adverse event attributable to the I MP, the investigator will first determine if a dose 
reduction (to the previous dose level) or suspension is necessary and possible. At the end of the 
titration p eriod, the patient’s dose will be established for the maintenance period. All IMP 
adjustments are made only after a remote or in -clinic visit; if the dose is escalated, the dose 
escalation will occur with the next morning’s dose.
In-person (in- clinic) stud y visits will be scheduled at weeks 3 and 7, and telephone contacts (with 
non-
recording live video) will be scheduled for weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 in order to assess 
dyskinesia and adverse events. The telephone contacts to the patient will be supported by  live 
video stream, without recording, to provide visual confirmation to the investigator of the verbal 
information provided b y the patient or caregiver. The dose of the IMP should be increased on a 
weekl y basis to reach a clinically  meaningful reduction in dy skinesia, as indicated by  a reduction 
in the CGI -I. The IMP dose should not be increased further if either of the following occurs:
the patient experiences a protocol- defined “clinically  significant” adverse event 
(defined as an adverse event that is rel ated to IMP and is either moderate or severe in 
intensity  or meets the criteria for a serious adverse event), OR
the maximum allowable dose is reached based on the patient’s weight and CYP2D6 
impairment status at baseline.
Dose adjustments can be made up t o and including the week 7 in
-clinic visit. If an optimal dose 
is reached before the week 7 in- clinic visit, the dose of IMP should not be increased further, but 
the patient should continue on that dose for the remainder of the titration period and through out 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
12the maintenance period. If a patient experiences a “clinically significant” adverse event 
attributable to the IMP, the investigator will first determine if a dose reduction (to the previous 
dose level) or suspension is necessary  and possible. If the de termination that a patient requires a 
dose reduction or suspension is made during a telephone contact, an unscheduled clinic visit 
should be conducted as soon as practicable thereafter. 
Maintenance period (8 weeks) : Patients will continue to receive their maintenance dose over the 
next 8 weeks, although a 1 -time dose reduction (to the previous dose level for the remainder of 
the study ) for adverse events is allowed. Patients will return to the clinic at weeks 9, 12, and 
15for assessments of efficacy  and safety . 
Washout period and follow -up:All patients will discontinue IMP at the week 15 visit and will 
return 1 week later for the end -of-study  visit. Patients who complete the study  may  be eligible to 
begin participation in the open- label safet y extension Study  TV50717- CNS -30081 at that time . 
At the week 16 visit, patients may  choose to enter Study  TV50717- CNS -30081 (on that day ) or 
up to 1 week later (2 weeks from the week 15 visit). Patients who complete treatment but choose 
not to participate in the open- label safet y extension Study  TV50717- CNS -30081 any  time before 
week 17 of Stud y TV50717 -CNS -30080 will be contacted for a safet y evaluation call occurring 
2weeks after their last dose of IMP. Additional details for patients to enter Study  TV50717-
CNS -30081 are provided in the TV50717 -CNS -30081 protocol.
When approximately  50 patients have completed the study  (including follow -up), an independent 
Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will perform an unblinded non -binding interim analy sis 
(IA)for futility  based on centrall y read MD-
CRS part II total score. 
An iDMC charter will be developed for the IA, and the procedures to ensure the integrity  of the 
study  will be provided in the charter.
At the time of informed consent, the parent/legally accepted representative will be counseled 
that, once randomized to treatment, patients are to remain in the study  and complete all study  
procedures unless the choice is made to withdraw consent. Patients who withdraw from the stud y 
before completing the 15 -week tre atment period should have an earl y termination (ET) visit as 
soon as possible after the last dose of IMP. All patients who discontinue early  will have a 
follow -up telephone contact for safet y evaluation 2 weeks after ET; evaluations will be as 
described fo r week 17. 
Patients who screen fail or terminate earl y from the study due to emergency circumstances (such 
as coronavirus disease 2019 [ COVI D-19]) may  be allowed to re-screen/re -enter (respectivel y) 
the study  at a later date, depending on the circumstance s. Each case should be referred to the 
medical monitor and approved in advance.
There is a separate protocol for the open- label safety  extension Study  TV50717- CNS -30081.
Brief Summary of Study Design for the Trial Registry(s):
CP refers to a group of neuro logical disorders that appear in infancy  or early  childhood and 
permanentl y affect body movement and muscle coordination. CP is caused by damage to or 
abnormalities inside the developing brain that disrupt the brain’s abilit y to control movement and 
mainta in posture and balance. The signs of CP usually  appear in the earl y months of life, 
although specific diagnosis may  be delay ed until the age of 2 years or older. TEV -50717 
(deutetrabenazine, also known as SD-809) has already  provided evidence for safe and effective

13use in 2 other hyperkinetic movement disorders, namely chorea in Huntington’s disease (HD) 
and tardive d yskinesia (TD). Currentl y, there is no approved treatment available for DCP. The 
available treatment options address some of the manifestation s of DCP. The study  population 
will include pediatric and adolescent patients (6 through 18 years of age) with DCP with 
predominant choreiform movement disorder, who have had non -progressive CP sy mptoms since 
infancy  (≤2 years of age). Diagnosis of DCP is based on the Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in 
Europe criteria. 
This is a Phase 3 study  that will evaluate the efficacy and safet y of TEV -50717 administered as 
oral tablets at a starting dose of 6 mg once daily  in patients (age 6 through 18 y ears, inclusi ve) 
with DCP with predominant choreiform movement disorder. The stud y will be conducted in 
multiple centers and will use 2 parallel treatment groups (ie, TEV -50717 and placebo) in which 
patients will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio.
Method of Randomization an d Blinding: 
Patients will be randomly  assigned to receive treatment with TEV -50717 or matching placebo in 
a 2:1 ratio using Randomization and Trial Supply Management (RTSM). Patients will be 
stratified by  age at baseline (6 to <12 years; 12 through 18 years, inclusive) and region (US; 
non-US). Patients and investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the 
study . In addition, the sponsor’s clinical personnel and all vendors (with the exception of the 
sponsor’s clinical supply  chain staff and RTSM vendor) will be blinded to the IMP identity  until 
the database has been locked for anal ysis and the treatment assignments are revealed. 
The iDMC will perform an unblinded non- binding IA for futility  and will monitor safety  
throughout the stud y based on unblinded data . An iDMC charter will be developed for the IA, 
and the procedures to ensure the integrit y of the study will be provided in the charter.
Investigational Medicinal Products: Dose, Pharmaceutical Form, Route of Administration, 
and Admini stration Rate:
The IMPs are defined as the test IMP and placebo IMP. There is no reference IMP in this study .
Test I MP will be administered as oral tablets at a starting dose of 6 mg once daily with food 
(eg, 
a snack) and should not be taken on an empty  stomach. Titration schemes based on body  weight 
at baseline are shown in Table 1. The maximum daily  dose is determined by  body  weight at 
baseline and CYP2D6 impairment status ( Table 2). Patients will be classified as CYP2D6 
impaired if they  are receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor or are a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer. 
Although dose adjustments can be made up to and including the week 7 in-clinic visit, if the 
optimal dose is reached before then, the dose of IMP should not be increased an y further, but the 
patient should continue taking that dose for the re
mainder of the titration period and throughout 
the maintenance period. If a patient experiences a “clinically significant” adverse event that is 
attributed to the I MP, the investigator will first determine if a dose reduction (to the previous 
dose level) or suspension is necessary  and possible. At the end of the titration period, the 
patient’s dose will be established for the maintenance period. If a patient experiences an adverse 
event during the maintenance period and the investigator believes a dose redu ction is warranted, 
the dose may  be reduced once for the remainder of the maintenance period.
TEV -
50717 tablets (test IMP) are available in the following dose strengths: 6, 9, 12, 15, and 
18 mg, all of which are identical in size, shape, and color (white). Test IMP will be supplied in 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
1420-count tablets per dose strength per bottle assembling 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 mg dose 
kit combinations. 
The placebo IMP tablets and packaging will match those for TEV -50717.  
All IMP adjustments are made only  after a remote or in -
clinic visit; if the dose is escalated, the 
dose escalation will occur with the next morning’s dose.
IMP will be administered as follows:
IMP should be swallowed whole. If the IMP is crushed or split, it should not be 
ingested; it should be replaced with a new tablet. The tablets will be taken with food 
(eg, a snack) and should n ot be taken on an empty stomach. Patients may  be offered 
the optional use of a Medi+Straw®, which is a commerciall y available straw that can 
assist patients to overcome their swallowing difficulties.
Dosing will be based on body  weight at the baseline visit and CYP2D6 impairment 
status, as shown in Table 1and Table 2, respectively .
If there is onl y a single dose of IMP per day, the dose should be taken in the morning. 
However, patients experiencing somnolence while taking the 6 -mg dose in the 
morning may  switch to taking it as an evening dose for the r est of the day s up to 
day14.
The starting dose of 6 mg will be administered in the morning on day  2 and for the 
remainder of the first week. Patients in the highest body  weight group ( ≥40 kg/88 lbs) 
will start an evening administration from day 3 and for the remainder of the first 
week. TEV -50717 dail y doses of 12 mg and higher will be administered as 2 divided 
equal doses, approximately  8 to 10 hours apart during the day . A minimum of 6 hours 
should elapse between doses. If a patient misses a dose, and it is within 6 hours of the 
next dose, the missed dose should be skipped. 
Dose increases may  not occur more frequentl y than every 5 days, except for patients 
≥40 kg/88 lbs. For patients ≥40 kg/88 lbs, the first dose increase should be performed 
in an interval less than 5 day s, onl y once, on day 3.
During the week 3 visit, the investigator or designee will make sure the patient 
receives the last treatment kit back so the patient can take the evening dose to 
complete the week 3 dosing for that day . Refer to the pharmacy  manual for further 
details.
For an y dose adjustment, the investigator or designee should confirm that patients 
have the bottle that contains the appropriate tablet strength and quantity to complete 
the recommended dail y regimen.
At an in- clinic visit, a dose reduction, if required, should be made to the previously  
tolerated dose level. If more than 1 dose reduction is required for an adverse 
event, the medical monitor should be notified .
During the titration period, the dose of IMP should be adjusted according to Table 1
to identify  a dose level that optimally  reduces d yskinesia (as determined by  the 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy

Statistical Considerations
Primary and Secondary Estimands:
The primary  estimand is the difference in means between TEV -50717 and placebo in the target 
p
atient population for the change from baseline to week 15 in centrall y read MD -CRS part II 
total score, regardless of whether or not dose reduction, suspension, or discontinuation occurred, 
and regardless of treatment-
related adverse events. 
The secondary estimands are the differences in means between TEV- 50717 and placebo in the 
target patient population for (1) change from baseline to week 15 in centrally  read MD -CRS 
partI total score ,(2) Caregiver Global Impression of I mprovement (CaGI -I) at week 15, (3) 
CGI-I at week 15, (4) change from baseline to week 15 in centrall yread UHDRS -TMC, and (5) 
change from baseline to week 15 in centrall yread UHDRS -TMD, regardless of whether or not 
dose reduction, suspension, or discontinuation occurred, and regardless of treatment -related 
adverse events.
The primary  estimand assesses the effectiveness in the reduction of choreiform movements in 
patients with DCP with predominant choreiform movement disorder, evaluated b y the central 
reviewers, 
focusing on the causal ef fects attributable to the I MP. The secondary  estimands assess 
the effectiveness on patients’ ability  to perform daily  functions, the improvement in dy skinesia 
evaluated b y the caregiver and the investigator , and the reduction in chorea and dy stonia 
evaluat ed by the central reviewers, all with a focus on the causal effects attributable to the I MP.
The patient population for this study  is patients with DCP with predominant choreiform 
movement disorder and severit y of DCP represented by MD -CRS part II total sc ore of ≥10 and 
CGI-S ≥4 at baseline. This population is expected to have the sensitivity  to demonstrate 
clinically  meaningful improvement following treatment with TEV -50717. Due to practical 
reasons, it is not possible to obtain a central reading of MD -CRS part II items at the time of the 
baseline visit prior to randomization ; therefore, i nclusion of a subject into the study  is based on 
investigator scoring of MD -CRS part II items at baseline. 
Analysis of Primary Endpoint:
The primary  endpoint is the chang e from baseline to week 15 in centrally  read MD -CRS part II 
total score (TEV -50717 versus placebo). The MD- CRS part II total score is obtained by  
summing the total raw scores of MD -CRS part II items (0 to 28). 
The modified intent -to treat (mITT) anal ysis set (all randomized patients with at least 
1post-baseline centrall y read MD -CRS part II assessment) will be used for the primary  analy sis.
The primary  anal ysis will be a mixed -model, repeated -measures with the change in MD- CRS 
part II total score as the dependent variable. The model will include fixed effects for treatment 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
20group, week (3 levels: weeks 9, 12, and 15), and treatment group by  week interaction. The 
baseline MD -CRS part II total score, age group at baseline (2 levels: 6 to <12 years; 12 through 
18 years, inclusive ), and region (US; non- US)will be included as covariates. The unstructured 
covariance model will be used.
Missing data 
will be classified as missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random 
(MNAR). Earl y terminations related to tolerabilit y, treatment -related adverse even ts, or lack of 
efficacy  will be classified as MNAR. Intermittent missing data, earl y terminations for patients 
who are lost to follow -up, and earl y terminations due to COVID -19 will be classified as MAR. 
For all other cases and for cases classified as above, classification as MAR/MNAR will be 
done/revisited in a blinded manner on a case -by-case basis prior to the IA and prior to database 
lock for final anal ysis. The MAR/MNAR multiple imputation method will be applied in the 
primary  anal ysis, where MNAR data will be imputed using the jump- to-reference method, and 
MAR data will be imputed based on the randomized treatment group. The resulting complete, 
imputed datasets will each be anal yzed using the analy sis model described above, and the 
resulting statistics combined using methodology  presented b y Rubin (1987) and Little and Rubin 
(2002) .
The difference in least squares (LS) mean of the change in MD-CRS part II total score from 
baseline to week 15 (TEV -50717 versus placebo) will be compared using a 1- sided test for 
superiority  at a nominal significan ce level of α=0.025. 
The L S mean and standard error for the treatment groups, the L S mean difference, 2- sided 95% 
confidence interval, and p- value for the comparison (TEV -50717 versus placebo) at week 15 will 
be presented.
Sample Size Rationale:
The initi al sample size estimation of approximately 185 patients randomized to TEV -50717 
versus placebo in a 2:1 ratio (approximately  124 in the TEV -50717 group; approximately  61 in 
the placebo group) is the sample size required to obtain a statistically  significant result in the 
primary  anal ysis based on a 1 -sided test for mean difference at a significance level of α=0.025 
with a power of approximately  90%, assuming a mean difference of 1.8 and a standard deviation 
(SD) of 3.5 in each treatment group. 
At the time of writing Amendment 05, the initially planned sample size has been reduced to 
approximately  65patients randomized to TEV -50717 versus placebo in a 2:1 ratio 
(approximately  43in the TEV -50717 group; approximately  22in the placebo group).
The initial assumptions regarding the mean difference and SD are based on the change from 
baseline to month 6 in patients treated with trihexyphenid yl reported b y Battini et al (2014) , 
assuming an effect size of 55% for TEV -50717 versus plac ebo. The effect size of 55% was 
assumed based on the observed effect sizes of TEV -50717 in the pivotal studies in HD and TD. 
In the current study , these assumptions correspond to a mean difference of 2.0 in MD -CRS 
partII total score and an SD of 3.5 in each treatment group.
The rate of MNAR data for the primary  anal ysis is expected to be 10%. MNAR data will be 
imputed in a conservative manner as if they  were obtained from patients in the placebo treatment 
group, regardless of the treatment group. As a resu lt, the mean difference is expected to be 
reduced from 2.0 to 1.8 in the primary  analy sis. The impact of the missing data imputation on the 
SD is negligible.

5.Change from baseline to week 15 in centrally read UHDRS -TMD ( TEV -50717 
versus placebo)
Each key  secondary  endpoint will be analy zed in the same fashion as the primary  endpoint, with 
the exception that the baseline value of the given endpoint will be included as the covariate.

PGI-I response, defined as patients who are described as “Much Improved” or 
“Somewhat Improved” in the PGI -I score
Analy sis methods will be provided in the statistical analy sis plan.
Multiple Comparisons and Multiplicity:
The primary  efficacy  endpoint will be tested at the 1- sided significance level of α=0.025. 
If the primary  endpoint is statistically  significant (p- value ≤0.025), the 5 key secondary  
hypotheses will be tested using a hierarchical approach at the 1 -sided significance level of 
α=0.025, in the following order: (1) MD- CRS part I total score, (2) CaGI -I, (3) CGI -I, (4) 
UHDRS -TMC centrall yread, and (5) UHDRS -TMD centrall yread. 
 
 
 
 
No multiplicity  control will be applied to the sensitivity anal ysisor other endpoints.
Planned Interim Analysis:
When approximately  50 patients have completed the study  (including follow -up), an iDMC will 
perform an unblinded non -binding IA for futility  based on centrall y read MD -CRS part II total 
score.

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
23Safety Analyses: 
Safety  anal yses will be performed on the safety  analy sis set.
All adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities. Each 
patient will be counted only  once in each preferred term or s ystem organ class cat egory  for the 
analyses of safet y. Summaries will be presented for all adverse events (overall and by severit y), 
adverse events determined by  the investigator to be related to test IMP (ie, reasonable 
possibility ) (defined as related or with missing relatio nship) (overall and b y severit y), serious 
adverse events, and adverse events causing withdrawal from the stud y. Summaries will be 
presented b y treatment group and for all patients. Patient listings of serious adverse events and 
adverse events leading to withdrawal will be presented.
Changes in laboratory , ECG, and vital signs measurements data will be summarized 
descriptivel y. ECG and vital signs values will be compared with predefined criteria to identify 
potentially  clinicall y significant values or change s, and such values will be listed.
The use of concomitant medications will be summarized by  therapeutic class using descriptive 
statistics.
The frequency  and severity  of suicidal ideation or behavior according to the children’s 
Columbia -Suicide Severity  Rating Scale (C -SSRS) questionnaire will be presented by  visit and 
by treatment group. A shift table for children’s C- SSRS categories at baseline, compared to the 
worst (highest) category  during the treatment period, will be presented. 
Assessment of drug -induced parkinsonism according to the ESRS (subscales I  and II), 
assessment of change in behavior according to the CBCL  questionnaire, and assessment of 
sedation according to the ESS questionnaire will be summarized descriptively .
For continuous variables, descriptive statistics will be provided for actual values and changes 
from baseline to each time point. For categorical variables, patient counts and percentages will 
be provided. Descriptive summaries of serious adverse events, patient withdrawals due to 
adverse events, and potentially  clinicall y significant abnormal values (clinical laboratory or vital 
signs) based on predefined criteria will be provided as well.
If any patient dies during the study, a listing of deaths will be provided, and all relevant 
information will be discussed in the patient narrative included in the clinical study  report.
Tolerability Analysis:
If more than 15% of the patients withdraw from the study  before the end of the treatment period, 
the number of day s until study  discontinua tion will be anal yzed using Kaplan- Meier 
methodology  using the ITT anal ysis set.

361. INTRODUCTION AND BAC KGROUND INFORMATION
1.1. Introduction
Cerebral palsy  (CP) denotes a non -progressive disturbance of brain function that usually  occurs 
in the developing fetal or infant brain (age ≤2 years) ( Rosenbaum et al 2007 ). It is the most 
common and costly  form of chronic motor disability  in children, with a prevalence of 2 to 4 per 
1,000 live births in the United States (US), and the condition is more common in boy s than in 
girls ( Maenner et al 2016 , Monbaliu et al 2017 , CDC , Prevalence of Cerebral Palsy ). Although 
there have been no general studies of life expectancy  in people with CP, most children affected 
by CP live between 30 and 70 y ears, depending on the severit y of the condition. I n general, a 
child with a mild case of CP usually  lives longer than a child with mobility  and intellectual 
limitations ( Cerebral Palsy Life Expectancy  2018). In the US, there are about 764,000 children 
and adults with CP, including about 500,000 children under the age of 18 years (Prevalence of 
Cerebral Pals y).
Prematurity  is the most common cause of CP, but other causes include stroke, hy poxic ischemic 
injury , infection, brain malformation, and genetic abnor malities ( CDC Causes and Risk Factors 
of Cerebral Palsy  2018; NINDS Cerebral Pals y: Hope Through Research 2019 ). Complications 
of CP may  include ey e movement abnormalities, communica tion problems, swallowing 
difficulty , poor weight gain, social isolation, hip dy splasia and dislocation, scoliosis, osteopenia 
and fractures, and pain. A variet y of movement disorders are associated with CP, including 
spasticity , dyskinesia (d ystonia, chor ea, athetosis, and even ballismus), and ataxia. Many  patients 
with CP present with mixed ty pes of movement disorders ( Monbaliu et al 2017 , CDC ). 
Dyskinesia is considered to result from an insult of non- progressive nature in the basal ganglia of 
the brain. Dy skinesia in cerebral pals y (DCP) is a form of CP characterized by abnormal 
involuntary  movements of the dy stonic and choreiform ty pes in approximately  6% to 15% of 
patients with CP. 
DCP is a ra re disease, and based on the above prevalence numbers of CP in the 
US,one could assume that approximately  30,000 to 75,000 children <18 years of age and 16,000 
to 40,000 adults have DCP ( Monbaliu et al 2017 ).
There are curren tly no approved treatments for DCP, which is a serious disease with an unmet 
medical need. Current treatment options (off -label use) to treat d ystonia and chorea include 
tetrabenazine, dopaminergic, or gamma- aminobuty ric acidergic interventions, but these show 
high variability  in response ( Monbaliu et al 2017 ). Botulinum neurotoxin A is also in clinical use 
for the treatment of spasticity  and d ystonia and is considered modestl y effective in selected 
patients, but it does not me et the full treatment need. Currentl y, there are very  few agents with 
novel mechanisms of action in development for movement disorders in CP. 
The purpose of the study  is to determine whether TEV -50717 is effective in the treatment of 
dyskinetic involuntar y movements associated with CP.
1.1.1. Background for TEV -
50717
TEV -50717 (deutetrabenazine, also known as SD- 809) was initially  developed to provide 
patients and prescribers with an effective treatment for chorea in Huntington’s disease (HD) with 
an improved pha rmacokinetic and tolerabilit y profile compared with tetrabenazine. TEV -50717

37is a vesicular monoamine transporter t ype 2 (VMAT2) inhibitor structurally related to 
tetrabenazine, with 2 trideuteromethox y groups instead of the 2 methox y groups attached to th e 
positions 9 and 10 of tetrabenazine. This deuterium placement does not change the target 
pharmacology , but it attenuates metabolism through cy tochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6). Thus, 
this deuterium placement in TEV-50717 increases the half- life of the active me tabolites relative 
to those of tetrabenazine, enabling reduced dosing frequency  and plasma fluctuation and thus 
potentially  improving safety  and tolerability .
TEV -50717 is a VMAT2 inhibitor with the chemical name (RR,SS) -1,3,4,6,7,11b -hexahy dro-
9,10- di(met hoxy -d3)- 3-(2-methy lprop yl)-2H- benzo[a]quinolizin -2-one. IMP tablets are available 
in the following dose strengths: 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 mg, all of which are identical in size, shape, 
and color (white). The investigational medicinal product (IMP) will be s upplied in 20 -count 
tablets per dose strength per bottle.
TEV -50717 was approved for the treatment of chorea associated with HD and for the treatment 
of tardive d yskinesia (TD) in adults on 03 April 2017 and 30 August 2017, respectivel y. For 
details, see also the US Prescribing Information ( AUSTEDO USPI  2017 ).
1.1.2. Experience with Tetrabenazine in the Treatment of Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy 
and Other Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders in Children and Adolescents
Tetrabenazine is ano ther VMAT2 inhibitor that presy napticall y depletes monoamines, such as 
dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and histamine, from nerve terminals ( Kaur et al 2016 ). 
Although widel y known among ph ysicians treating DCP, there is l imited and rather anecdotal 
literature on the potential efficacy  of tetrabenazine on the treatment of h yperkinetic movement 
disorders in patients with CP of pediatric age. 
Tetrabenazine has been studied in a pediatric population with a variet y of hyperkinetic 
movement disorders. Jain et al (2006) reviewed the outcomes of 31 children at Columbia 
University  Medical Center who were treated with tetrabenazine. Eighteen of these children had 
chorea, of which half had additional mov ement disorders, 10 had tics, and 3 had dy stonia. The 
average duration of sy mptoms before treatment was 4 y ears, and the age of children in the study  
ranged from 22 months to 18 y ears, with a mean age of 11±4.9 y ears. The primary  causes of the 
abnormal mov ements in these pediatric patients were CP in 2 patients; primary  generalized 
dystonia in 2 patients; various brain injuries (intraventricular hemorrhage with developmental 
delay or post -hypoxic injury ), genetic abnormalities with brain lesions (arterioven ous 
malformations with developmental delay  and neurofibromatosis ty pe I), metabolic disorders 
(propionic acidemia, Lesch -Nyhan s yndrome, and L eigh’s sy ndrome), immune mediated 
(Sydenham’s chorea), medication effects (tardive dy stonia or withdrawal -emergent syndrome), 
and unknown etiology in 5 patients. Doses of tetrabenazine ranged from 25 mg dail y 
(0.9mg/kg/day ) to 350 mg dail y (10 mg/kg/day), and the average dose was 107 mg dail y 
(3.7mg/kg/day ). Twenty- four of these pediatric patients with hy perkinetic movement disorders 
had improved s ymptoms (14 out of 18 with chorea, 8 out of 10 with tics, and 2 out of 3 with 
dystonia). Adverse events and tolerability  findings were present in 19 (61%) patients who had at 
least 1 side effect (sedation, 35%; behavioral c hanges, 19%; depression, 10%; nausea, 3%; and 
parkinsonism, 3%), and the treatment was stopped in 17 (55%) patients. 
Although not related to CP, in another study , Vuong et al (2004) evaluated the safet y and 
efficacy  of tetrabenazine as a potential treatment for hy perkinetic movement disorders in 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
3810patients with chorea, 12 patients with dy stonia, and 53 patients with tics. I n this study , the 
doses ranged from 6.25 to 150 mg/day . The patients with chorea had approximately  90% 
improvement at the second visit, and those with dystonia had approximately 50% improvement 
at the second visit. Adverse events included dose -dependent nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, and 
depression.
1.2. Findings from Nonclinical and Clinical Studies
Brief summari es of nonclinical pharmacology , pharmacokinetics, and toxicology  studies and 
clinical studies are provided in the following sections. More detailed information is provided in 
the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).
1.2.1. Nonclinical Studies
The key  nonclinical study  findings are provided below, with details available in the IB.
1.2.1.1. Nonclinical Pharmacology
TEV -50717 is a selectively  deuterium -substituted VMAT2 inhibitor structurally  related to 
tetrabenazine. The biologically active metabolites formed from TEV -50717 
(alpha -dihydrotetrabenazine [α -HTBZ] and beta- dihydrotetrabenazine [β- HTBZ]) are potent 
inhibitors of VMAT2 binding, with inhibition constant values of 3.8 and 22 nM, respectivel y, 
that are similar to previously  reported values of their corresponding non- deuterat ed forms 
(Scherman et al 1988 ). Off -target binding occurs at a similar extent with deuterated and 
non-deuterated α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ. TEV -50717 and tetrabenazine in male rats at doses 
resulting in similar sy stemic exposure to th e test articles (α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ) produced 
similar, expected, exaggerated central nervous sy stem pharmacological effects. I n particular, the 
adverse event of catalepsy, a known response in rats to drugs that reduce central nervous s ystem 
dopamine concent rations ( Fuenmay or and Vogt 1979), was similar in magnitude after 
TEV -50717 and tetrabenazine administration.
1.2.1.2. Nonclinical Pharmacokinetics and Drug Metabolism
In human liver S9, the metabolite profile of TEV -50717 overlapped w ith that of tetrabenazine. In 
a clinical comparative human [14C]-absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion and 
mass -balance study , the approximately  22 metabolites of TEV -50717 were also metabolites of 
tetrabenazine. Thus, previous clinical exper ience with tetrabenazine provides predictive 
information about the safety  of TEV -50717 and its metabolites. 
Tetrabenazine, α -HTBZ, and β
-HTBZ and, b y extension, their deuterated forms, do not inhibit or 
induce cy tochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzy mes at clinicall y relevant concentrations ( Xenazine 
Prescribing Information 2015 ). M1, a minor metabolite that may  circulate in greater 
concentrations as a metabolite of TEV -50717 as compared to tetrabenazine, is neither an 
inhibitor of major CYP isozy mes or transporters nor an inducer of CYP isozy mes. M4, a major 
metabolite of tetrabenazine and TEV -50717, is neither an inhibitor of major CYP isozy mes or 
transporters nor an inducer of CYP isozy mes.

391.2.1.3. Toxicology
General and Reproductive Adult Tox icology : Oral administration of TEV -50717 in rats reduced 
body  weight gain, increased mammary  hyperplasia, and produced estrous cy cle changes, all of 
which occurred with tetrabenazine at doses that produced similar s ystemic exposures to test 
articles and m etabolites. Mammary  and estrus effects are likely  consequences of reduced central 
dopamine and subsequent increased prolactin, consistent with information in the Xenazine®
(tetrabenazine) label. Oral administration of TEV-50717 in pregnant rats did not produce test 
article -related embry ofetal toxicities, even at doses that led to reduced body weight gain in dams. 
Oral administration of metabolite M1 to pregnant rats from gestational days 6 to 17 produced no 
test article -related maternal or fetal toxicities.
Genetic Toxicology : TEV -50717 and its α -HTBZ and β -HTBZ metabolites were negative in in 
vitro studies for mutagenicity  (bacterial reverse mutation or the Ames test) and for chromosomal 
structural aberrations in human peripheral blood ly mphocy tes. Oral dos es of TEV -50717 were 
negative for inducing micronuclei in the bone marrow of treated mice.
Juvenile Toxicology : The effects of TEV -50717 on juvenile development was assessed in male 
and female rats with oral dosing from weaning (postnatal day  [PND] 21) to PND 71, similar to 
human dosing from y ear 2 through earl y adolescence and overlapping with TEV -50717 oral 
dosing in a general adult toxicology  study . The effects of M1 was assessed in male and female 
juvenile rats from PND 25 to PND 70 with a recovery  phas e and postdosing reproductive 
assessment.
TEV -50717 produced no test article -related effects on learning and memory  functions, on 
histopathology  assessments, on reproductive capacity  (male and female fertility  and estrus 
cyclicity ), or on intrauterine surv ival of embry os from matings during recovery  from test article 
administration. Adversely  reduced body  weight gain and adverse clinical observation of tremors 
and in- cage h yperactivity were all noted in previous studies with adult rats; these effects have n ot 
predicted adult clinical intolerance to TEV -50717. The highest dose level of M1 (50 mg/kg/day ) 
produced no test article -related toxicities (clinical observations, changes in body  weight gain, 
clinical pathology , histopathology , ophthalmology, and perfor mance in learning and memory  
tests).
1.2.2. Clinical Studies
The clinical development plan for TEV -50717 to date includes the following:
Fourteen completed Phase 1 studies in healthy  adult volunteers

40Further details may  be found in the IB.
1.2.2.1. Clinical Pharmacology Studies
Fourteen Phase 1 clinical pharmacol ogy studies were conducted in healthy  adult volunteers. In 
addition, sparse pharmacokinetic sampling was included in the Phase 3 studies in patients with 
HD and TD where the population pharmacokinetic anal yses including these data have been 
performed to ex tensively evaluate both the pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic -
pharmacod ynamic relationship of TEV- 50717. A summary  of the clinical pharmacology  findings 
is provided in the IB.
Pharmacometric anal yses of the active metabolites of TEV- 50717 based on the P hase 1 clinical 
pharmacology  studies in healthy  adult volunteers were performed to support dose selection and 
pharmacokinetic characterization in a pediatric population. Subsequently , a further 
pharmacometric anal ysis of active metabolites following admini stration of TEV -50717 to 
adolescent patients with TS with tics (Study  SD-809-C-17) was completed. The results of these 
analyses are described in Section 1.2.2.3.
1.2.2.2. Clinical Safety and Efficacy Studies
The safet y profile of TEV -50717 has been characterized to date in healthy  volunteers, as well as 
in adult patients with chorea associated with HD and TD (as detailed in the IB ) and in children 
and adolesce nts with TS .Study  SD-809-C- 17 also evaluated the safet y of TEV -50717 in 
adolescent patients with TS. Results of the safety  anal yses indicate that treatment with 
TEV -50717 at doses up to 36 mg dail y given in 2 divided doses is generally safe and well 
tolerated for up to 8 weeks in patients with TS. No serious treatment -emergent adverse events or 
severe treatment -emergent adverse events occurred in this study . The most frequentl y observed 
treatment -emergent adverse events during the entire treatment period were fatigue and headache, 
each reported in 4/23 (17.4%) patients, followed by irritabilit y, which was reported in 3/23 
(13.0%) patients. 
Studies TV50717 -CNS -30046 and TV50717- CNS -30060 evaluated children and adolescent 
patients with tics associated with T S. Neither study met the primary  efficacy  endpoint. In both 
studies, TEV- 50717 was generall y safe and well tolerated. No deaths occurred in either stud y. 
One patient had 2 serious adverse events. There were no trends in changes from baseline in 
serum labor atory , vital signs, ECG, and phy sical and neurological parameters. There was no 
evidence of a new safety  signal in pediatric patients with TS treated with TEV -50717 in 
comparison to the known safet y profile of this drug in adult patients with HD or TD.
Theopen -label, long -term Study  TV50717- CNS -30047 evaluated children and adolescent 
patients with tics associated with TS. Treatment with TEV- 50717 through 54 weeks resulted in 
improvement of tics. The safety profile observed in pediatric patients with TS rec eiving 
long-term treatment with TEV -50717 was generally  comparable to the known safet y profile of 
this drug in adult patients with HD or TD, with the exception of the adverse event of weight gain.
There were no clinicall y meaningful trends in mean changes from baseline for any  clinical 
laboratory  variable or any  other observations related to safet y.
This is the first study  to assess the safet y and efficacy  of TEV -50717 in patients with DCP.

411.2.2.3. Pharmacometric Analysis of TEV -50717 Active Metabolites to Support Dose 
Selection and Pharmacokinetic Characterization in a Pediatric Population
Population pharmacokinetic modeling of the TEV -50717 active metabolites -HTBZ and 
β-HTBZ has been performed throughout the clinical development program. Based on sequential 
pharmacokinetic sampling data obtained in healthy  volunteers in the Phase 1 program, a 
structural population pharmacokinetic model was developed to guide dose selection for HD 
patients with chorea (Study SD-809- CLN-076) and subsequently  optimized to better describe the 
absorption/bioconversion profile of -HTBZ and β -HTBZ (Study SD-
809-CLN-077). 
Employ ing the structural model defined in Study SD-809- CLN-077, sequential and sparse 
pharmacokinetic sampling data obtained from Study  SD-809-C- 17 were combined with the 
Phase 1 data emplo yed in Study SD-809- CLN-077 to estimate the total ( α+β)-HTBZ exposure in 
adolescent patients (age 12 through 18 years) with TS and to simulate exposure in adolescent and 
pediatric patients (age 6 through 11 years) with and without con comitant CYP2D6 impairment 
(genetic or because of concomitant use of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor) across a range of doses 
(Appendix H). Population model parameters were re -estimated for the combined Phase 1 and 
adolescent data obtained from patients in Study  SD-809-C-17. The model was used to simulate 
total ( α+β)-HTBZ exposures across a range of body  weights corresponding to a pediatric and 
adolescent population according to the Centers for Disease Control growth charts. 
This analy sis indicated that exposure to total ( +β)-HTBZ is influenced b y body  weight, and a 
reduction in dose for pediatric and adolescent patients weighing <40 kg is necessary  in or der to 
provide comparable exposure to doses up to 48 mg/day  in adults, a level previously  
demonstrated to be safe and well tolerated in treated patients with chorea associated with HD. 
This analy sis provides the basis for the dosing recommendations in Sec tion5.1.

42TEV -50717 is contraindicated in patients taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors 
(MAOIs). TEV -50717 should not be used in combination with a MAOI or within a 
minimum of 14 day s of discontinuing therap y with a MAOI.
TEV -50717 is contraindicated in patients taking reserpine. At least 21 days should 
elapse after stopping reserpine before starting TEV -50717.
TEV -50717 is contraindicated in patients taking tetrabenazine or valbenazine. At 
least 30 day s should elapse after stopping tetrabenazine or valbenazine before starting 
TEV -50717.
Additional information regarding each potential issue may  be found in the current IB.
1.3.2. Overall Benefit and Risk Assessment for This Study
There are currently  no approved treatm ents for DCP, which is a serious disease with an unmet 
medical need. Also, there is a significant need to identify  effective treatments for DCP. The 
results from studies in other study populations, such as patients with TS or HD, demonstrated no 
signal on safet y scales, vital signs, laboratory parameters, or 12 -lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). 
The rates for TEV -50717 and placebo were similar for overall adverse events, neurologic and 
psychiatric adverse events, as well as dose reduction or dose suspension for adverse events (see

2.1.1. Justification of Primary Endpoint
The rationale to use a movement disorder scale as the primary  endpoint to evaluate patients with 
DCP is based on a few key drivers. In prior studies, the motor scales measured and demonstrated 
a treatment benefit of TEV- 50717 in patients with abnormal movem ents (eg, chorea and 
dyskinesia) associated with HD (Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale [UHDRS] -Total 
Maximal Chorea [TMC]) and TD (Abnormal Involuntary  Movements Scale [AI MS]) ( Austedo 
Prescriber Information ). Moreover , the use of motor scales as a primary  outcome measure has 
been sufficient for TEV -50717 to gain regulatory  approval to treat patients with abnormal 
movements. Conversel y, the functional and global scales did not consistently show a treatment 
benefit of TE V-50717 in patients with abnormal movements. 
The Movement Disorder -Childhood Rating Scale (MD -CRS) part II is similar to UHDRS- TMC 
and AIMS in assessing the severit y of abnormal h yperkinetic movement disorders in the 7 bod y 
regions using a 0 to 4 scale. N either MD -CRS part II nor AIMS differentiates whether the 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
45dyskinesia is dy stonic or choreiform . Experts in the field support the choice of MD -CRS part II 
to assess the severit y of movement disorders in children with DCP.
The MD -CRS has 2 parts: part I for general assessment of the functioning and impact of CP on 
the activities of the patient, and part II for a specific motor assessment of the severit y of the 
movement disorder. 
MD-CRS part II evaluates the severit y of the movement disorder in 7 body regions, all areas in 
which dy skinesia can be seen in patients with CP. The MD -CRS part II does not differentiate 
whether the d yskinesia is of the dy stonic or choreiform phenot ype, and the worst dyskinesia in 
any of the regions observed during the assessment session will be taken as the score for each 
affected bod y region. The MD -CRS part II was developed and validated in the CP population for 
children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years ( Battini et a l 2008 ). In addition, the scale was shown 
to be suitable for detecting a treatment effect after an intervention with trihexy phenid yl, a drug 
used to treat d yskinesia in children with CP ( Battini et al 2014 ).
The MD -CRS was developed based on centralized readings of the video recordings of the patient 
assessments. The use of blinded centralized readings and ratings of videos of patients with 
movement disorders in clinical trials may  decrease the inter -site and intra -site variabi lity of data. 
This clinical trial will use centralized ratings of the videos to reduce data variability .
2.1.2. Primary and Secondary Estimands
The primary  estimand is the difference in means between TEV -50717 and placebo in the target 
patient population for the change from baseline to week 15 in centrall y read MD -CRS part II 
total score, regardless of whether or not dose reduction, suspension, or discontinuation occurred, 
and regardless of treatment-related adverse events. 
The secondary  estimands are the differences in means between TEV- 50717 and placebo in the 
target patient population for (1) change from baseline to week 15 in centrally  read MD -CRS 
partI total score ,(2) Caregiver Global Impression of I mprovement (CaGI -I) at week 15,
(3)Clinical Global Impression of I mprovement (CGI -I) at week 15, (4) change from baseline to 
week 15 in centrall yread UHDRS -TMC, and (5) change from baseline to week 15 in centrally
read UHDRS -TMD, regardless of whether or not dose reduction, suspension, or discontinuation 
occurred, and regardless of treatment- related adverse events.
The primary  estimand assesses the effectiveness in the reduction of choreiform mo vements in 
patients with DCP with predominant choreiform movement disorder, as evaluated by  the central 
reviewers, focusing on the causal effects attributable to the I MP. The secondary  estimands assess 
the effectiveness on patients’ ability  to perform dail y functions, the improvement in dyskinesia 
evaluated b y the caregiver and the investigator, and the reduction in chorea and dy stonia 
evaluated b y central reviewers, all with a focus on the causal effects attributable to the IMP.

473. STUDY  DESIGN
3.1. General Study Design and Study Schematic Diagram
This is a Phase 3, 21- week, multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, parallel 
group stud y to evaluate the efficacy and safet y of TEV- 50717 administered as oral tablets at a 
starting dose of 6 mg once daily  in patients (age 6 through 18 years, inclusive) with DCP with 
predominant choreiform movement disorder, who have had CP sy mptoms, of a non -progressive 
nature, since infancy  (≤2 years of age). “Predominant” in this instance indicates that the 
choreiform moveme nt disorder is the main cause of impairment or distress.
The study  will consist of a screening period (up to 31 days) and a double -blind treatment period 
including a titration period (7 weeks) and a maintenance period (8 weeks), followed by  a 
washout peri od of 1 week, and a follow-up telephone contact 1 week after the washout period. 
Throughout the stud y, patients will interact regularly with investigational center personnel, 
in-clinic and b y telephone (with non -recording live video), for the evaluation of
safet y/tolerability , dyskinesia severit y, and behavioral status (in -clinic onl y). Every effort should 
be made to utilize the same investigator to perform assessments on a patient throughout the 
duration of the study during these interactions. Under circum stances that require or encourage 
involvement of the patient’s caregiver when administering assessments, every  effort should be 
made to involve the same caregiver of a patient throughout the duration of the study . Standard of 
care for treatment of CP shoul d continue throughout the study, with some possible restrictions.
Standard of care could include any possible rehabilitation service(s), such as phy siotherapy , 
occupational therap y, or sensory  integration of the patient, should remain constant throughout t he 
course of the stud y.
For the purposes of this protocol, a caregiver is defined as an adult who is familiar with the 
patient and is responsible for dail y care, enabling that person to effectivel y complete the protocol 
requirements. The caregiver accompan ies the patient to the visits and provides input to the 
relevant scales as required by  the protocol. 
For patients who are minors, the caregiver is t ypically a parent or a legall y accepted 
representative. In some countries, an adult (such as grandparent or nurse) can be appointed b y 
the parent or legall y accepted representative (as per local regulations and laws) and would take 
over this responsibility  as a caregiver. The parent or legally  accepted representative only  has to 
sign the parent/legall y accepted representative informed consent form (ICF) and not the 
caregiver ICF.
For adult patients, a caregiver must be appointed by  the patient; this can be the parent, a legall y 
accepted representative, or other adult, as appropriate and according to local laws a nd 
regulations.
For patients who are minors, certain responsibilities in the protocol can only  be completed by  the 
parent/legall y accepted representative, ie, informed consent, withdrawal of consent, requests for 
discontinuation of the I MP, or withdrawal f rom the study  for any  reason. To further clarify , the 
caregiver is not allowed to make decisions on the child’s health or where “parent/legall y 
accepted representative” is specificall y indicated in the protocol.
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
48At the baseline visit (day 1), patients will be randomly  assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups with 
TEV -50717 IMP or placebo IMP in a 2:1 ratio stratified by  age at baseline (6 to <12 y ears; 
12through 18 years, inclusive) and region (US; non- US). IMP will be titrated during the 
double -blind treatment period starting with 6 mg of TEV -50717 or matching placebo IMP in the 
morning of day  2. Patients in the highest bod y weight group ( ≥40 kg/88 lbs) will start an evening 
administration from day  3 and for the remainder of the first week. TEV -50717 daily  dose s of 
12mg and higher will be administered as 2 divided equal doses, approximately  8 to 10 hours 
apart during the day . The number of matching placebo IMP tablets will be increased accordingl y. 
Dose increases may  not occur more frequentl y than every 5 days, except for patients 
≥40kg/88 lbs. For patients ≥40 kg/88 lbs, the first dose increase should be performed in an 
interval less than 5 day s, only  once, on day  3. During the titration period, the dose of IMP will be 
adjusted according to the titrations sche me (details are given in Section 5) to identify  a dose level 
that optimally  reduces dyskinesia (as determined by  the investigator, as indicated by  areduction 
in the clinician -reported outcome [ClinRO] of the assessment of the CGI -I) and is well tolerated. 
If a patient experiences a “clinically significant” adverse event attributable to the I MP, the 
investigator will first determine if a dose reductio n (to the previous dose level) or suspension is 
necessary  and possible (Section 5.8). After titration, patients will remain at their optimal dose f or 
the length of the maintenance period. 
Screening period (up to 31 days): After written informed consent/assent, as appropriate, is 
obtained, patients who are stable from a medical and psy chiatric standpoint will undergo a 
screening evaluation, including medical history ; phy sical and neurological examination; 
laboratory  testing; 12 -lead ECG; along with MD -CRS part II (ph ysician rated, with video 
recording, centrall y read with video review, centrally read b y the Enrollment Adjudication Board 
[EAB]) to asse ss severit y of dyskinesia; Clinical Global I mpression of Severity  (CGI -S) to assess 
global clinical impression of DCP severity , comorbid CP sy mptoms, and behavioral status; 
children’s Columbia- Suicide Severit y Rating Scale (C -SSRS); assessment of drug- induced 
parkinsonism according to the Extrapy ramidal S ymptom Rating Scale (subscales I and II; 
ESRS); assessment of change in behavior according to the Child Behavior Checklist (for ages 
6-18) (CBCL) questionnaire; and assessment of sedation according to the E pworth Sleepiness 
Scale (for children and adolescents) (ESS) questionnaire. Screening may  be conducted over 
2 separate visits at the discretion of the investigator. The diagnosis of CP and DCP will be 
established based on clinical features as described in the inclusion/exclusion criteria. The EAB 
will also confirm, based on video recordings, that choreiform is clinically  the predominant 
movement disorder of the patient’s DCP. EAB assessment results will be available to the 
investigator prior to baseline and randomization. The MD- CRS part II will be administered by  
the investigational center phy sician and video review for central -blinded reading. In this stud y, 
the MD -CRS part II will be scored onl
y based on chorea.
Titration period (7 weeks) : Patients who re main eligible for participation in the study  will be 
randomized at the baseline visit (day  1) and instructed to take the first dose of blinded IMP the 
following morning with food ( eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empty  stomach. The 
titration sche me and maximum dose will be determined by  body  weight and CYP2D6 
impairment status at baseline, as shown in Table 4and Table 5. Patients will be classified as 
CYP2D6 impaired if they are receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor or are a CYP2D6 poor 
metabolizer. At the baseline visit, a telephone for non- recording live video will be provided to 
the patient and caregiver. Patients and their caregiver will interact weekl y with the 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
49investigator/staff, either by  telephone contact (with non -recording live video) or clinic visit from 
week 1 through week 7 of the t itration period, in order to evaluate safet y/tolerability  and 
establish a dose of IMP that optimally  reduces the severit y of d yskinetic involuntary  movements 
(clinically  meaningful reduction in dy skinesia, as indicated by  a reduction in the CGI -I) and is 
well tolerated. Safet y/tolerability  in-clinic evaluations during titration include assessment of vital 
signs, monitoring for adverse events and concomitant medications, 12 -lead ECGs, identify ing 
subjects at risk for suicide according to the C -SSRS questionnaire, assessment of drug- induced 
parkinsonism according to the ESRS (subscales I and II), assessment of change in behavior 
according to the CBCL  questionnaire, and assessment of sedation according to the ESS 
questionnaire. If a patient experiences a “clini cally significant” adverse event attributable to the 
IMP, the investigator will first determine if a dose reduction (to the previous dose level) or 
suspension is necessary  and possible. At the end of the titration period, the patient’s dose will be 
establi shed for the maintenance period. All IMP adjustments are made only  after a remote or in -
clinic visit; if the dose is escalated, the dose escalation will occur with the next morning’s dose.
In-person (in- clinic) study  visits will be scheduled for weeks 3 and 7, and telephone contacts 
(with non-recording live video) will be scheduled for weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 in order to assess 
dyskinesia and adverse events. The telephone contacts to the patient will be supported by  live 
video stream, without recording, to provide visual confirmation to the investigator of the verbal 
information provided b y the patient or caregiver. The dose of the IMP should be increased on a 
weekl y basis to reach a clinically  meaningful reduction in dy skinesia, as indicated by  a reduction 
in the CGI -I. The IMP dose should not be increased further if either of the following events 
occurs:
the patient experiences a protocol- defined “clinically  significant” adverse event 
(defined as an adverse event that is related to IMP and is either moderat e or severe in 
intensity  or meets the criteria for a serious adverse event), OR
the maximum allowable dose is reached based on the patient’s weight and CYP2D6 
impairment status at baseline.
Dose adjustments can be made up to and including the week 7 in -clinic visit. If an optimal dose 
is reached before the week 7 in -clinic visit, the dose of IMP should not be increased further, but 
the patient should continue on that dose for the remainder of the titration period and throughout 
the maintenance period. If a patient experiences a “clinically  significant” adverse event 
attributable to the IMP, the investigator will first determine if a dose reduction (to the previous 
dose level) or suspension is necessary  and possible. If the determination that a patient requir es a 
dose reduction or suspension is made during a telephone contact, an unscheduled clinic visit 
should be conducted as soon as practicable thereafter.
Maintenance period (8 weeks) : Patients will continue to receive their maintenance dose over the 
next 8 weeks, although a 1-time dose reduction (to the previous dose level for the remainder of 
the study ) for adverse events is allowed. Patients will return to the clinic at weeks 9, 12, and 
15for assessments of efficacy  and safety . 
Washout period and follow -up:All patients will discontinue IMP at the week 15 visit and will 
return 1 week later for the end -of-study  (EOS) visit. Patients who complete the study  may  be 
eligible to begin participation in the open -label safety  extension Study  TV50717- CNS -30081 at 
that time. At the week 16 visit, patients may  choose to enter Study  TV50717 -CNS -30081 (on 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
50that day ) or up to 1 week later (2 weeks from the week 15 visit). Patients who complete 
treatment but choose not to participate in the open -label safety  extension Stud y 
TV50717- CNS -30081 any  time before week 17 of Study  TV50717- CNS -30080 will be 
contacted for a safet y evaluation call occurring 2 weeks after their last dose of IMP. Additional 
details for patients to enter Study  TV50717 -CNS -30081 are provided in the TV507 17-CNS -
30081 protocol.
When approximately  50 patients have completed the study  (including follow -up), an independent 
Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will perform an unblinded non -binding interim analy sis 
(IA) for futility  based on centrall y read MD- CRS pa rt II total score. 
An iDMC charter will be developed for the IA, and the procedures to ensure the integrity  of the 
study  will be provided in the charter.
At the time of informed consent, the parent/legally accepted representative will be counseled 
that, once randomized to treatment, patients are to remain in the study  and complete all study  
procedures unless the choice is made to withdraw consent. Patients who withdraw from the stud y 
before completing the 15 -week treatment period should have an earl y termi nation (ET) visit as 
soon as possible after the last dose of IMP. All patients who discontinue early  will have a 
follow -up telephone contact for safet y evaluation 2 weeks after ET; evaluations will be as 
described for week 17.
Patients who screen fail or t erminate earl y from the study due to emergency circumstances (such 
as coronavirus disease 2019 [COVI D
-19]) may  be allowed to re- screen/re -enter (respectivel y) 
the study  at a later date, depending on the circumstances. Each case should be referred to the 
medical monitor and approved in advance.
There is a separate protocol for the open
-label safety  extension Study  TV50717- CNS -30081.
The end of stud y is defined as last visit of the last patient.

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
523.2. Planned Number of Patients and Regions
Approximately  65patients are planned to be randomized to TEV -50717 versus placebo in a 
2:1ratio (approximately  43in the TEV -50717 group; approximately  22in the placebo group) 
stratified by  age at baseline (6 to <12 years; 12 through 18 years) and region (US; non- US). 
Details on sample size are given in Section 9.1
.
This study  is planned to be conducted in approximately  60 investigational centers in North 
America, Asia, and Europe. 
3.3. Justification for Study Design and Selection of Population
Currently , there is no approved treatment available for DCP. The available treatment options 
address some of the manif estations of DCP, which is hy perkinetic motor impairment due to a 
non-progressive disturbance of brain function that occurred in the developing fetal or infant 
brain, generall y before the age of 2 years, and will therefore have a major debilitating impact 
on 
the ability  of the child with CP to further develop motor skills. Therefore, the study  population 
will include pediatric and adolescent patients (6 through 18 years of age) with DCP with 
predominant choreiform movement disorder, who have had non -progres sive CP sy mptoms since 
infancy  (≤2years of age). Diagnosis of DCP is based on the Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy  in 
Europe criteria ( Cans 2000 ).
Consequently , the placebo -controlled, double -blind study  design (TEV -50717 versu
s placebo in 
a 2:1 ratio) was chosen for this Phase 3 study  to determine whether treatment with study  
medication results in a statistically  significant effect on dy skinetic involuntary  movements of 
patients with DCP.
3.4. Stopping Rules for the Study
When approximately  50 patients have completed the study  (including follow -up), an iDMC will 
perform an unblinded non -binding IA for futility  based on the primary  endpoint, the centrall y 
read MD -CRS part II total score. Based on the results of the IA, the study  may  be stopped for 
futility .
During the conduct of the study , serious adverse events will be reviewed ( Section 7.1.5), as they  
are reported from the investigational centers to identify  safet y concerns.
The study  may  be terminated by  the sponsor for any  reason at any  time. For example, the 
sponsor should ter minate the study  in the event of the following:
new toxicological or pharmacological findings or safet y issues invalidate the earlier 
positive benefit -risk assessment
discontinuation of the development of the IMP
If the stud y will be stopped, the patients who are terminated earl y will be followed according to 
Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures for the Patient (Section 4.3
).

hAssessment to be completed at investigator’s discretion.
iDose increases may not occur more frequently than every 5 days, except for patients ≥40 kg/88 lbs. For patients ≥40 kg/88 lbs, the first dose increase should
be performed in an interval less than 5 days, only once, on day 3.  
jDose adjustment will be made by the investigator after telephone contact with the patient and caregiver or in -clinic visit to evaluate dyskinesia reduction and 
adverse events. If the dose is escalated, the dose escalation will occur with the next morning’s dose.
k
lWeigh t must be measured with shoes and outerwear off. Before pulse and BP are measured, the patient must be in a supine or semi -erect/seated position and 
resting for at least 3 minutes (the same position and arm or leg should be used each time vital signs are m easured for a given patient).
mOrthostatic BP and pulse will be measured after the patient is in a standing position for at least 3 minutes (for patients wh o are able to stand); for patients who 
find standing difficult or do not allow  for a reliable BP and pulse measurement, alternative methods to collect orthostatic BP and pulse should be discussed 
with the medical monitor .
nAll ECGs will be performed after at least 5 minutes rest in a supine or semi -supine position.
oPerform ECG if there was a signif icant abnormality at the ET visit.

rPatients with clinically significant laboratory abnormalities at w eek 15 w ill have those laboratory evaluations repeated at t he week 16 visit.
sThe patient’s CYP2D6 genotype results will be provided to the RTSM, w hich drives each patient’s dose regimen, and the patient’s CYP2D6 genotype will 
remain blinded during the conduct of the study.
tFor females who are postmenarchal or aged ≥12 years of childbearing potential. Serum test will be administered at screening a nd week 15, whereas a urine 
test will be administered at baseline and all other in -clinic visits where this test is administered.
uMD-CRS parts I and II assessments are done locally at the investigational center, by the investigator, and video recorded. An EAB will confirm, at the 
screening visit, that choreiform movement disorder is the predominant dyskinetic movement disorder and that DCP severity repr esented by an MD -CRS part 
II score is ≥10. The EAB w ill inform the local rater if their assessment is different than the local rater’s assessment; however, it is the investigator who 
determines the subject’s eligibility. All the subsequent MD -CRS ratings will be performed by the investigator and video recorded and then centrally read, in a 
blinded manner.
vCaGI-I and PGI -I are to be completed before all other investigator -rated scales during visits where CaGI -I and PGI -I are collected.
wDuring telephone contact, the CGI -I scale can only be done if non -recording video is available, allow ing the investigator t o complete the required assessment.
xThe children’s C -SSRS questionnaire will be presented to patients who have reached ≥12 years of age at screening or 11 years of age at screening but will 
turn 12 years of age during the study. Children 13 years of age and under must be interviewed in conjunction with the caregiver. For children over 13 years of 
age, parent/legally accepted representative involvement is strongly encouraged. Questions should be direc ted to the child, but the parent/legally accepted 
representative should be encouraged to add relevant information. 
yA full CBCL assessment (Competence Scale [Parts I to VII] and a Syndrome Scale [behavioral items]) w ill be performed at scree ning and week 15/ET. The 
Syndrome Scale part of the CBCL assessment only will be performed at baseline and weeks 3, 7, 9, 12, and 16/EOS.

58zIMP w ill be dispensed in the clinic. At the baseline visit, patients will receive IMP kits of increasing doses sufficient for 3 weeks. At the week 3 visit, 
4additional kits of increasing doses w ill be dispensed to cover the following 4 weeks until the end of the titration period at week 7. These supplies will allow  
the patient to maintain their titration scheme between clinic visit s by way of remote caregiver/patient telephone contacts. Dose adjustments can be made up to 
and including the week 7 in -clinic visit. If an optimal dose is reached before then, the dose of IMP should not be increased any further, but the patient should 
continue on that same dose for the remainder of the titration period and throughout maintenance dosing. The investigational cent er will determine titration (ie, 
starting the next dose) for the patient by telephone. See Table 4for baseline w eight -based dosing titration. For any dose adjustment, the investigator or 
designee should confirm that patients have the bottle that contains the appropriate tablet str ength and quantity to complete the recommended daily regimen.
aaPatients will receive doses for 3 w eeks (±3 days) of maintenance treatment.
bbStudy drug accountability will be assessed during in -clinic visits only. A check for compliance with TEV -50717 intake will be performed during each 
in-clinic visit and telephone contact after TEV -50717 has been dispensed.
ccThe study staff needs to discuss the drug status during the telephone contacts to ensure that the patients have adequate tabl ets, inform the p atients if they 
should titrate, and remind them to bring used and unused IMP bottles to the next in -clinic visit.

624.3. Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures for the Patient
Patients are expected to p articipate in this study  for its entire duration and perform the scheduled 
visits and procedures. 
During the titration period, an optimal dose should be sought for each patient. Throughout the 
maintenance period, patients will continue to receive the opti mal dose determined during 
titration. I f a patient experiences a “clinically significant” adverse event attributable to the I MP, 
the investigator will first determine if a dose reduction (to the previous dose level) or suspension 
is necessary  and possible (Section 5.8). Each patient is free to withdraw from the study  or 
discontinue from IMP at any  time, without prejudice to their continued care, but e very effort 
should be made to determine the reason for discontinuation. 
Every  effort should be made to ensure that patients comply  with study  visits and procedures, as 
detailed in the protocol. Patients must be withdrawn from the study  if an y of the follo wing events 
occur:
1.Patient or parent(s)/legally acceptable representative withdraws consent or requests 
discontinuation from the IMP or withdrawal from the study  for any  reason.
2.Patient develops an illness that would interfere with his/her continued partic ipation.
3.Patient is noncompliant with the study  procedures and assessments or administration of 
IMPs in the opinion of the investigator.
4. Patient takes prohibited concomitant medications as defined in this protocol 
(see Appendix H).
5.Patient engages in 
alcohol or other substance abuse.
6.A female patient has a confirmation of pregnancy  during the study  from a positive 
pregnancy  test.
7. The sponsor requests withdrawal of the patient.
8. Patient experiences an adverse event or other medical condition that indicates to the 
investigator that continued participation is not in the best interest of the patient.
9.The patient experiences a serious adverse event or pregnancy , or in cases when the 
investigator deems it necessary  to unblind the patient’s IMP assignment to make 
treatment decisions.
10. Patient has evidence of diminished hepatic function based on the following liver function 
laboratory  test results:
a.AST or ALT >2.5 × ULN
b.ALP or total bilirubin >2 × ULN
11.Patient develops Neuroleptic Malignant S yndrome (NMS)
12.If a post -baseline QTcF value >500 msec or change from screening >60 msec is found, 
the investigator should repeat the ECG assessment twice more and compare the average 
of these 3 post-screening QTcF values to the pre -treatment QTcF values at screening. The 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
63IMP must be stopped for any  confirmed post -baseline QTcF average value >500 msec or 
average increase from screening >60 msec. 
13. In patients who experience signs of suicidal idea tion or behavior (Section 7.9), t he 
investigator should consult with the medical monitor to determine whether the patient 
should continue in the study .
In addition, a patient may  be withdrawn from the study  as described in Sections 3.4,3.5, 
and 5.10 and Appendix C.
Because the statistical analy sis of the primary  endpoint of this study  includes the assessment of 
randomness of missing data (Section 9.5.2.1), the most accurate as possible determination of the 
reason for ET is very  important. Investigators should make every  effort to obtain accurate 
information on patients in the case of withdrawal from the study  or disco ntinuation from I MP. 
Results of any  evaluations and observations, together with a narrative describing the reason(s) 
for withdrawal from the study  or discontinuation from I MP, must be recorded in the source 
documents. The case report form (CRF) must docume nt the primary  reason for withdrawal from 
the study  or discontinuation from IMP.
See Appendix Gfor information regarding how the study  will define and address lost to 
follow -up patients to help limit the amount and impact of missing data.
If the reason for withdrawal from the stud y or discontinuation from IMP is an adverse event 
and/or clinicall y significant abnormal laboratory test result, monitori ng will be continued as 
applicable (eg, until the event has resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of 
a health care professional, or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study 
procedure is made). If a patient is withdrawn wholly  or in part because of an adverse event, the 
specific event or test result (including repeated test results, as applicable) must be recorded both 
on the source documentation and in the adverse events page and termination page of the CRF.
The patient will be monitored at the discretion of the investigator (eg, until the event has 
resolved or stabilized, until the patient is referred to the care of a health care professional, or 
until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study procedure is made). The 
investigator must inform the clinical project ph ysician/clinical leader as soon as possible of any  
patients who are being considered for withdrawal due to adverse event(s). Additional reports 
must be provided when requested.
If a p atient is withdrawn from the study  for multiple reasons that also include adverse events, the 
relevant page of the CRF should indicate that the withdrawal was related to an adverse event. An 
exception to this requirement will be the occurrence of an advers e event that, in the opinion of 
the investigator, is not severe enough to warrant discontinuation but that requires the use of a 
prohibited medication, thereb y requiring discontinuation of the patient. In such a case, the reason 
for discontinuation would b e “need to take a prohibited medication” and not the adverse event.
All assessments should be performed according to the protocol on the last day  the patient takes 
IMP, or as soon as possible thereafter.

644.4. Replacement of Patients
A patient who is enrolled but does not complete the treatment period will not be replaced.
4.5. Rescreening
A patient who is screened but no t enrolled (eg, because inclusion and exclusion criteria were not 
met or enrollment did not occur within the specified time) may  be considered for rescreening 
1 time if there is a change in the patient’s medical background or other relevant change. (Note: 
the medical monitor should approve rescreening after review of the enabling reasons.)
Patients may  have individual parameters retested at the discretion of both the investigator and the 
sponsor .
If the patient is rescreened, an informed consent form ( ICF) will need to be re -signed.
For COVID -19 updates, refer to Appendix M.
4.6. Screening Failure
Screening failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study  but 
are not subsequently  randomized in the study . Minimal information includes, but is not limited 
to, demograph y, screening failure details, eligibility criteria, and an y serious adverse events.

655. TREA TMENTS
5.1. Investigational Medicinal Products Used in the Study
IMP is defined as the test I MPs and matching placebo IMPs to the respective test I MPs. There is 
no reference IMP in this study .
5.1.1. Test Investigational Medicinal Product
Test IMP (TEV -50717 [deutetrabenazin e, previously  SD-809]) will be administered as oral 
tablets with food (eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empty  stomach. The IMP is coated 
with a white poly mer coating to aid in swallowing. TEV -50717 tablets have been manufactured 
according to curr ent Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) regulations. TEV -50717 tablets will 
be supplied as 6 -, 9-, 12- , 15-, and 18- mg tablets by  bottle and labeled according to applicable 
regulatory  guidelines. Each bottle pack (20 -count tablets per dose strength per bottl e) will 
contain a sufficient supply of drug until the next specified visit/telephone contact, plus overage 
to account for potential delay s in study  visits.
Additional details may be found in 
Table 6,the IB for TEV -50717, and the Prescribing 
Information for TEV- 50717.
5.1.1.1. Starting Dose and Dose Levels
Test I MP will be administered as oral tablets at a starting dose of 6 mg once daily with food 
(eg, 
a snack) a nd should not be taken on an empty  stomach. Titration schemes based on body  weight 
at baseline are shown in Table 4. The maximum daily  dose is determin ed by  body  weight at 
baseline and CYP2D6 impairment status (see Table 5). Patients will be classified as CYP2D6 
impaired if they  are receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor or are a CYP2D6 poor metabolizer. 
Dose adjustments can be made up to and including the week 7 in-clinic visit. If an optimal dose 
is reached before the week 7 in-
clinic visit, the dose of IMP should not be increased further, but 
the patie nt should continue on that dose for the remainder of the titration period and throughout 
the maintenance period. If a patient experiences a “clinically significant” adverse event that is 
attributed to the I MP, the investigator will first determine if a dos e reduction (to the previous 
dose level) or suspension is necessary and possible. At the end of the titration period, the 
patient’s dose will be established for the maintenance period. If a patient experiences an adverse 
event during the maintenance period and the investigator believes a dose reduction is warranted, 
the dose may  be reduced once for the remainder of the maintenance period.
TEV -50717 tablets (test IMP) are available in the following dose strengths: 6, 9, 12, 15, and 
18mg, all of which are identical in size, shape, and color (white). Test IMP will be supplied in 
20-count tablets per dose strength per bottle assembling 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, and 48 mg dose 
kit combinations. The placebo IMP tablets and packaging will match those for TEV -50717.
5.1.1.2. Dose Modification and Dose Stratification
All IMP adjustments are made only  after a remote or in -
clinic visit; if the dose is escalated, the 
dose escalation will occur with the next morning’s dose.
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
66IMP will be administered as follows:
IMP should be swallowed whole. If the I MP is crushed or split, it should not be 
ingested; it should be replaced with a new tablet. The tablets will be taken with food 
(eg, a snack) and should not be taken on an empty stomach. Patients may  be offered 
the optional use of a Medi+Straw®, which is a commerciall y available straw that can 
assist patients to overcome their swallowing difficulties.
Dosing will be based on body  weight at the baseline visit and CYP2D6 impairment 
status, as shown in Table 4and Table 5, respectively .
If there is onl y a single dose of IMP per day, the dose should be taken in the morning. 
However, patients experiencing somnolence while taking the 6 -mg dose in the 
morning may  switch to taking it as an evening dose for the rest of the day s up to 
day14.
The starting dose of 6 mg will be administered i n the morning on day  2 and for the 
remainder of the first week. Patients in the highest body  weight group ( ≥40 kg/88 lbs) 
will start an evening administration from day 3 and for the remainder of the first 
week. TEV -50717 dail y doses of 12 mg and higher will be administered as 2 divided 
equal doses, approximately  8 to 10 hours apart during the day . A minimum of 6 hours 
should elapse between doses. If a patient misses a dose, and it is within 6 hours of the 
next dose, the missed dose should be skipped. 
Dose increases may  not occur more frequentl y than every 5 days, except for patients 
≥40 kg/88 lbs. For patients ≥40 kg/88 lbs, the first dose increase should be performed 
in an interval less than 5 day s, onl y once, on day 3.
During the week 3 visit, the investigator or designee will make sure the patient 
receives the last treatment kit back so the patient can take the evening dose to 
complete the week 3 dosing for that day . Refer to the pharmacy  manual for further 
details.
For an y dose adjustment, the investigat or or designee should confirm that patients 
have the bottle that contains the appropriate tablet strength and quantity to complete 
the recommended dail y regimen.
At an in-clinic visit, a dose reduction, if required, should be made to the previously  
tolerat ed dose level. If more than 1 dose reduction is required for an adverse 
event, the medical monitor should be notified .
During the titration period, the dose of IMP should be adjusted according to Table 4
to identify  a dose level that optimally  reduces d yskinesia (as determined by  the 
investigator, as indicated by  a reduction in the CGI -I) and is well tolerated. Dose 
adjustments should ONLY take place after telephone or in- clinic visit.

705.2. Preparation, Handling, Labeling, Storage, and Accountability for 
Investigational Medicinal Products
5.2.1. Storage and Security
The investigator or designee must confirm that appropriate temperature conditions have been 
maintained for all IMPs received and an y discrepancies are reported and resolved before use of 
the IMPs.
The IMPs (TEV -50717 and placebo IMP) must be stored at a controlled room temperature, 20ºC 
to 25ºC (68ºF to 77ºF), in a securel y locked, substantially constructed cab inet or enclosure with 
access limited to authorized staff. For additional information related to the IMP storage 
condition, refer to Section 11 of the Pharmacy  Manual.
5.2.2. Labeling
Supplies of I MPs will be labeled according to the current International Council for 
Harmonisation guidelines on Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and GMP and will include any  
locally  required statements. I f necessary , labels will be translated into the local language.
5.2.3. Accountability
Each IMP shipment will include a packing slip listing th e contents of the shipment and any  
applicable forms.
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of IMPs and other study  materials 
from the sponsor are correctly received, recorded, handled, and stored safely  and properl y in 
accordance wit h the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) or national and local regulations, and 
used in accordance with this protocol.
Only  patients enrolled in the study  may  receive IMPs, and only  authorized staff at the 
investigational center may suppl y or administer IMP s. All I MPs must be stored in a secure, 
environmentally  controlled, and monitored (manual or automated) area in accordance with the 
labeled storage conditions or appropriate instructions with access limited to the investigator and 
authorized staff at the investigational center.
The investigator (or designee) will instruct the patient to store the IMP according to the 
instructions on the label, if applicable, or will give instructions in an appropriate form.
The investigator, institution, or the head of the medical institution (where applicable) is 
responsible for IMP accountability , reconciliation, and record maintenance (ie, receipt, 
reconciliation, and final disposition records).
A record of IMP accountability  (ie, IMP and other study  materials received, used, retained, 
returned, or destro yed) must be prepared and signed by  the principal investigator or designee, 
with an account given for any  discrepancies. Any  used (partiall y used or empty ) bottles and 
unused kits/bottles that are not destro yed at the sit e are returned to the sponsor or designee, as 
agreed with the sponsor (including expired and damaged kits).

715.3. Justification for Investigational Medicinal Products
5.3.1. Justification for Dose of Test Investigational Medicinal Product
Based on the feedback from th e external experts, the optimal dose of tetrabenazine in the 
treatment of DCP in a pediatric population is individualized and not related to any  specific dose 
per bod y weight. Also, the 2 published studies ( Jain et al 2006 , Vuong et al 2004) on the use of 
tetrabenazine in the treatment of hy perkinetic movement disorders (including DCP) (see 
Section 1.1.2) introduce a wide range of doses of tetrabenazine that were found to be effective. 
As variability  in optimal dose of tetrabenazine might be due to its highly  variable metabolism of 
the active ( +β)-HTBZ, it is also conceivable that the patient s with hy perkinetic movement 
disorders would require an individually  optimized dose. Therefore, this uses a flexible dose 
design, where maximal dose is limited based on body  weight and CYP2D6 impairment status. 
Based on modeling and simulations of the expo sure (area under the plasma concentration -time 
curve) and maximum observed concentration in adults and adolescents, it is possible to design 
dosing regimens in alternative body  weight categories depending on their CYP2D6 impairment 
status, which would give comparable exposure and maximum observed concentration across the 
range of strata. This approach is analogous to what has also been adopted in the ongoing 
TV50717- CNS -30046 Phase 2/3 and TV50717 -CNS -30060 Phase 3 studies of TEV -50717 in 
TS.
5.3.2. Justification for Use of Placebo Investigational Medicinal Product
A standard placebo -controlled, double -blind study design (TEV- 50717 versus placebo in a 
2:1ratio) was chosen to determine whether TEV -50717 treatment results in a statistically  
significant effect on the motor sy stem of patients with CP. As CP is not a progressive 
neurological disorder, and available treatments are for s ymptomatic control, the use of placebo is 
justified in a short- term study  where safet y is carefully monitored. Moreover, a placebo contro l is 
ideal for characterizing the efficacy  and safet y of an experimental agent in a new stud y 
population.
5.4. Treatment after the End of the Study
All patients will discontinue IMP at the week 15 visit and will return 1 week later for the EOS 
visit.  
Patients 
will not receive the evening 
IMP dose on this day . 
Patients who complete the study  may  be eligible to begin participation in the open- label safet y 
extension Study  TV50717- CNS -30081. At the week 16 visit, patients may  choose to enter Study  
TV50717- CNS -
30081 (on that day ) or up to 1 week later (2 weeks from the week 15 visit). 
Patients who complete treatment but choose not to participate in the open -label safet y extension 
Study TV50717- CNS -30081 before week 17 of Study  TV50717 -CNS -30080 will be contacted 
fora safet y evaluation call occurring 2 weeks after their last dose of IMP. Additional details for 
patients to enter Study  TV50717- CNS -30081 are provided in the TV50717 -CNS -30081 protocol. 
Note: Patients can also roll over to the extension study  within 2 to 4 weeks after the week 15 visit 
but will be required to complete additional scales and tests as part of Stud yTV50717
-CNS -30081.

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
725.5. Restrictions
Medications prohibited before and/or during the study  are described in Section 5.6. 
While patients receiving a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor (such as paroxetine, fluoxetine, or 
bupropion) at baseline may  be enrolled into this study , the removal of strong CYP2D6 inhibitors 
during treatment is discouraged, as this would have an effect on exposure to active circulating 
drug. If the removal of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor is required from a clinical perspective, the 
medical monitor should be contacted so that an appropriat e change in IMP dosing can be made. 
The addition of a strong CYP2D6 inhibitor is prohibited during the stud y.
Restrictions in regard to sexual activity  and required laboratory  values are provided in the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. 
As with other VMAT2 inhibitors (tetrabenazine and reserpine), patients should be advised that 
the concomitant use of alcohol or other sedating drugs with TEV -50717 may  have additive 
effects and cause or worsen somnolence. 
Patients should be advised not to drive a car or op erate dangerous machinery  until they  
understand how TEV -50717 affects them.
Use of non
-approved drugs (per protocol) is prohibited from the time of signing of the ICF and 
throughout stud y participation.
Patients may  not donate blood from the time of signing of the informed consent, while taking the 
IMP, and for 14 day s after the last dose.
5.6. Prior and Concomitant Medication
Any prior or concomitant medication a patient has had within 3 months prior to baseline and up 
to the end of study , including follow-up, will be recorded on the CRF. Generic or trade name, 
indication, dose, and start and end dates of the administered medication will be recorded. The 
sponsor will encode all medication according to the World Health Organization drug dictionary .
At each clinic visit after the screening visit, the investigator will ask patients and/or caregiver 
whether the patient has taken an y medications (other than IMP), including over -the-counter 
medications, vitamins, or herbal or nutritional supplements, since the pr evious visit. Caregivers 
and patients will be instructed during the course of the study  to notify  the investigator if any  new 
medication is prescribed /administered (other than TEV -50717) or if there is any  change in 
current medications, including over -the-counter medications. An y prescribed new and/or an y 
change in current medication should be reviewed with the investigator. Indication, dosage, and 
start and end dates should be entered on the CRF. 
The medical monitor must be contacted if a patient is receiving (or has to begin or stop receiving 
during the stud y) a medication that is associated with QT prolongation or that is a known strong 
CYP inhibitor. Allowed strong CYP inhibitors at baseline are shown in Appendix H, Table 10. 
The addition of a strong CYP inhibitor is prohibited during the study .
Prohibited medications that are associated with QT prolongation are listed in Appendix H, 
Table 11. 
Concomitant medication will be monitored throughout the study .

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
735.7. Procedures for Monitoring Patient Compliance
The investigator will be responsible for monitoring patient compliance until completion of the 
IMP administration according to the protocol or discontinuation from I MP. A check of 
compliance with IMP intake will be performed during each in -clinic visit after the used IMP has 
been returned, and IMP accountability  records will be completed. At week 3, I MP administration 
compliance can be calculated only  for weeks 1 and 2, as the last kit at week 3 is returned to the 
patient so that the patient can complete the week 3 dosing for that evening.
If the investigato r or the sponsor determines that the patient is not in compliance with the study  
protocol, the investigator and the sponsor should determine whether the patient should be 
withdrawn from the study. Based on pill counts at in- clinic visits, poor compliance w ith study  
drug intake (ie, <80%) or overdose (ie, >105%) is to be recorded as an important deviation and 
expeditiously  reported to the medical monitor.
Patients are expected to participate in this study  for its entire duration. Exposure to IMP will be 
assessed as required (Section 5.1).
5.8. Temporary Discontinuation of Investigational Medicinal Product
Refer to Table 3for data to be collected at the time of IMP discontinuation and follow -up and for 
any further evaluations that need to be completed.
If a patient experiences a “clinically significant” ad verse event that is attributed to I MP, the 
investigator will first determine if a dose reduction (to the previous dose level) or suspension is 
necessary  and possible. Dose adjustments should be made based on all available information, 
including the patient
’s and parent’s/caregiver’s reports of adverse events and motor function 
improvement, the clinical assessment of safety  and efficacy  by the investigator, and information 
from rating scales. If more than 1 dose reduction is required for an adverse event, th e 
medical monitor should be notified. Suspension of IMP treatment for up to 1 week, if 
warranted, is allowed. If the patient restarts IMP within 7 day s of suspension, the full dose of 
IMP may  be resumed without titration at the same dose level or 1 dose lo wer (last tolerated 
dose). Suspension of IMP treatment for adverse events must be reviewed with the medical 
monitor before IMP treatment is restarted. Suspensions for more than 7 days must be reviewed 
by the medical monitor before therap y is restarted, and also to determine if there is adequate time 
for patients to be reinstated and complete stud y evaluations. The reason for a dose reduction or 
suspension must be clearly  documented in the related adverse event form.
Dose reduction or suspension is allowed once during the titration period and once during the 
maintenance period. Patients who restart IMP treatment will remain at the current dose 
throughout that period with no further dose changes and will, otherwise, follow the visit schedule 
as outlined in the protocol. I f a dose reduction occurs before a scheduled clinic visit, the clinic 
visit will be postponed so that efficacy  evaluations can be performed at least 7 days after the 
change. 
If a dose suspension occurs before a scheduled clinic visit, an unscheduled visit should be 
scheduled as soon as possible so that efficacy  evaluations can be performed at least 7 days after 
the change. 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
74If the determination that a patient requires a dose reduction or suspension is made during a 
telephone contact, an unscheduled clinic visit should be conducted as soon as practicable 
thereafter.
If a patient’s serum potassium or magnesium level falls below the lower limit of normal, I MP 
should be suspended. Since TEV -50717 does not have any  known effect on potassium and 
magnesium levels, the reference to potassium and magnesium is in the context of other factors 
related to an y current underly ing condition, such as severe diarrhea or intake of drugs that lower
serum potassium and magnesium. The investigator will be responsible to manage the patient’s 
condition per the site’s standard of care and assess continuation of treatment. The medical 
monitor should be contacted to discuss the suspension and possible resu mption of the IMP . IMP 
treatment may  only be restarted once serum potassium and/or magnesium levels have 
normalized.
Patients who restart IMP treatment will follow the visit schedule as outlined in Table 3. Patients 
who withdraw from the study  will proceed as described in Section 4.3.
5.9. Randomizatio n and Blinding
This is a double -blind study . Patients will be randomized to either TEV -50717 or matching 
placebo in a 2:1 ratio using Randomization and Trial Supply  Management (RTSM). Patients will 
be stratified b y age at baseline (6 to <12 years; 12 through 18 years, inclusive) and region (US; 
non-US). Patients and investigators will remain blinded to treatment assignment during the 
study . In addition, the sponsor’s clinical personnel and all vendors (with the exception of the 
sponsor’s clinical supply  chain staff and RTSM vendor) will be blinded to the IMP identity  until 
the database has been locked for anal ysis and the treatment assignments are revealed.
The iDMC will perform an unblinded non- binding IA for futility  and will monitor safety  
throughout the study  based on unblinded data. An iDMC charter will be developed for the 
interim analy ses, and the procedures to ensure the integrit y of the stud y will be provided in the 
charter (see Section 5.10.3 for more details).
In the event of an emergency
, it will be possible to determine to which treatment group and dose 
the patient has been allocated b y accessing the RTSM sy stem. All investigat ional centers will be 
provided with details of how to access the s ystem for code breaking at the start of the study . The 
medical monitor or equivalent should be notified following unblinding. Any  unblinding of the 
IMP performed b y the investigator must be recorded in the source documents.
Patients re- entering the study  will be manually  assigned to their initial treatment group b y the 
RTSM unblinded vendor. Blinding will be maintained for the patient, investigator, and sponsor 
as described above; the only  information that will be available is that the patient was assigned to 
the same treatment group previously . 
The randomization list will be assigned to the relevant treatment groups through a qualified 
service provider (eg, via an RTSM sy stem). The generatio n of the randomization list and 
management of the RTSM sy stem will be done by  a qualified service provider under the 
oversight of the responsible function at Teva.

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
755.10. Maintenance of Randomization and Blinding
5.10.1. Maintenance of Randomization
Patient randomization codes will be maintained in a secure location at the service provider 
contracted to generate the codes. At the time of analy sis (after the end of study  or at the IA), after 
receiving unblinding request from a Teva statistician, the service provider will p rovide the 
unblinded I MP assignment according to the processes defined in the relevant standard operating 
procedure. For the IA and iDMC closed sessions, the codes will be provided to an independent 
statistician who will perform the IA.
5.10.2. Blinding and Unblin ding
For information about personnel who may  be aware of IMP assignments, see Section 5.9. These 
individuals will not be involved in conduct of an y study  procedures or assessment of any  adverse 
events .
In case of a serious adverse event, pregnancy , or in cases when knowledge of th e IMP 
assignment is needed to make treatment decisions, the investigator may  unblind the patient’s 
IMP assignment as deemed necessary , mainl y in emergency situations, through specialized 
access in the RTSM sy stem. Breaking of the treatment code may  alway s be performed by  the 
investigator without prior approval b y the sponsor; however, the sponsor should be notified that 
the code was broken, but the patient treatment assignment should not be revealed to the sponsor.
When a blind is broken, the patient will b e withdrawn from the stud y, and the event will be 
recorded on the CRF. The circumstances leading to the breaking of the code should be fully  
documented in the investigator’s study files and in the patient’s source documentation. 
Assignment of IMP should no t be recorded in an y study  documents or source document.
In blinded studies, for an adverse event defined as a suspected unexpected serious adverse 
reaction (SUSAR) (ie, reasonable possibility ; see Section 7.1.4), Global Patient Safety  and 
Pharmacovigilance (GPSP) may  independentl y request that the blind code be broken (on a 
case-by-case basis) to comply  with regulatory  requirements. The report will 
be provided in an 
unblinded manner for regulatory  submission. If this occurs, blinding will be maintained for the 
investigator and for other personnel involved in the conduct of the stud y and anal ysis and 
reporting of the data.
5.10.3. Independent Data Monitoring Committee
There will be an iDMC in this study . 
When approximately  50 patients have completed the study  (including follow -up), the iDMC will 
perform an unblinded non -binding IA for futility  based on centrall y read MD -CRS part II total 
score.
Details on how the iDMC chairperson will communicate with the sponsor in regard to issues 
resulting from the conduct and clinical aspects of the study  are described in the iDMC charter. 
The iDMC charter will be developed for the IA, and the procedures to ensure the inte grity of the 
study  will be provided in the charter. The sponsor will work closely  with the iDMC to provide 
the necessary  safet y and efficacy data for review. In addition, results of the IA will be 
communicated to the sponsor as outlined in the iDMC charter .

776. ASSESSMENT OF  EFFICA CY
Efficacy  in this study  will be evaluated using MD -CRS part I  total score, MD -CRS pa rt II total 
score, CaGI -I, CGI -I, CGI -S, PEDI -CAT, UHDRS -TMS, UHDRS-TMC, UHDRS- TMD, and 
PGI-I. It is recommended that the same order of administration/completion of the scales be kept 
per patient throughout the study , as best as possible (refer to the Stud y TV50717 -CNS -30080 
RECL AIM-DCP: Order of scales administration/completion document). At all relevant visits 
where collected, PGI-I and CaGI- I are to be completed before all other investigator- rated scales.
The investigator should review all scales and que stionnaires in a timely  manner for any  potential 
reporting of adverse events and document this review accordingl y. At each study  visit, as 
applicable, the investigator should compare the current scores to the baseline scores.
For COVID -19 updates, refer to Appendix M.
6.1. Primary Efficacy Measure
The primary  efficacy  measure is centrall y read MD -CRS part II total score, which is part of the 
MD-CRS for the a ge group 4 to 18 y ears. MD -CRS part II was shown to be suitable for detecting 
a treatment effect after an intervention with trihexyphenid yl, a drug used to treat dy skinesia in 
children with CP ( Battini et al 2014 ).
The MD -CRS was developed as a child -oriented instrument aimed to describe various ty pes of 
movement disorders (d ystonia, chorea, athetosis, ballismus, and hy pokinetic -rigid) and to 
compare changes during natural history  and/or pharmacological treatments or to monitor
interventions ( Battini et al 2008 andBattini et al 2014 ). MD -CRS reliability  (eg, inter -and 
intra-rater reliability) has been evaluated when used by clinicians and professionals of 
rehabilitation after a 1 -day training on its scoring ( Sgandurra et al 2018 ). The version “MD -CRS 
4-
18” has been designed to evaluate various movement disorders in children and adolescents, 
aged 4 to 18 years, and their influen ce on dail y living activities or motor function in different 
body  regions at rest and during specific tasks ( Battini et al 2008 ). 
The MD -CRS has 2 parts: part I for general assessment of the functioning and impact of CP on 
the activities of the patient and part II for a specific motor assessment of severity  of the 
movement disorder. MD -CRS part II evaluates the severit y of the movement disorder in a scale 
of 0 to 4 in 7 body  regions, all areas in which d yskinesia can be seen in patients with CP. I n 
rating the movement disorder of the bod y part, 0 refers to absence of a movement disorder and 
4refers to a situation where movement disorder is present during all of the tasks for the region 
examined and/or involves 3 or more of the other regions, making completion impossible. The 
7body  regions are (i) eye and periorbital region, (ii) face, (iii) tongue and perioral region, (iv) 
neck, (v) trunk, (vi) upper limb, and (vii) lower limb. The MD -CRS part II does not differentiate 
whether the d yskinesia is of the dy stonic or choreiform phenot ype, and the worst dyskinesia in 
any of the regions observed during the assessment session will be taken as the score for each 
affected bod y region. The minimum score is 0 (absent) and the maximum scor e is 28 
(marked/prolonged).

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
78The MD -CRS part II will be administered by  the investigational center ph ysician, or other 
appropriatel y trained study  team member, and video -recorded at screening, baseline, week 9, 
week 12, week 15/ET, and week 16/EOS visits.
The MD -CRS has been updated to version 2 with changes to the scoring language. This version 
should be used when available. However, a patient will complete all study  visits using the same 
version.
Assessment of MD -CRS part II items will be based solely  on c horea in this study  and performed 
as follows: 
Local assessment (all time points): the investigational center ph ysician will 
administer the MD -CRS part II and complete the assessment of item scores. Note: the 
physicians will receive training on MD -CRS scor ing prior to the study .
EAB review (screening): EAB will review the MD -CRS part II at the screening visit 
to confirm that dy skinesia severit y is aligned with the protocol criteria for inclusion 
into the study . The review will include determination of the p redominant dy skinesia 
type and scoring of MD -CRS part II items. The EAB will inform the site prior to the 
baseline visit if there are any  discrepancies between the local and central assessments, 
and offer to discuss with the investigator. Ultimately , it is the investigator who 
determines the patient’s eligibility . EAB assessment of screening MD- CRS part II 
total score will not be included in the statistical analy sis.
Central reading (baseline, week 9, week 12, week 15/ET, and week 16/EOS): Video 
review of M D-CRS part II will be assessed periodically  in a blinded manner (ie, visit, 
investigator site rating, and other study -related information) by  a central review 
board. Central reading results performed b y the central raters, who are also the EAB 
members, wil l not be disclosed to the investigational site. Central reading details will 
be provided in a separate charter.
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is the change from baseline to week 15 in the MD-CRS part II 
total score (TEV -50717 versus placebo) , assessed by  central reading.
6.2. Key Secondary Efficacy Measures
6.2.1. Movement Disorder -Childhood Rating Scale Part I Total Score
The MD -CRS part I evaluates impact of DCP on the activities of the patient and provides a 
general assessment of the movement disorder of motor function (7 items), oral/verbal function 
(3items), self-care (3 items), and attention/alertness (2 items) on a scale of 0 (present) to 
4(absent) ( Battini et al 2008 , Battini et al 2014 ). The min imum score is 0 and the maximum 
score is 60.
The MD -CRS part I will be administered at baseline, week 9, week 12, week 15/ET, and 
week 16/EOS visits. The MD -CRS partI will be administered by  the investigational center 
physician and video recorded for cent ral blinded review. The protocol refers to MD -CRS as a 
physician -rated scale, but in certain instances, based on the experience of the rater, certain 
non-physicians may  be approved to rate the MD
-CRS.

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
796.2.2. Caregiver Global Impression of Improvement Scale
The Ca GI-I is single item questionnaire to assess the caregiver’s impression of improvement in 
dyskinesia s ymptoms after initiating therapy . The scale is a caregiver- reported outcome that aims 
to evaluate all aspects of patients’ health and determine if there ha s been an overall improvement 
or not in dy skinesia s ymptoms. The CaGI -I is to be completed before all other investigator- rated 
scales during visits where CaGI -I is collected ( Table 3). The caregiver has to select the 
1response from the response options that gives the most accurate description of change in 
dyskinesia s ymptoms of the patient they  care for from the beginning of the study : 
1=very  much improved (since the initiation of treatment);
2=much improved;
3=minimally  improved;
4=no change from baseline (s ymptoms remain essentially  unchanged);
5=minimally  worse;
6=much worse;
7=very  much worse (since the initiation of treatment). 
The CaGI -I is a dministered at week 3, week 7, week 9, week 12, week 15/ET, and week 16/EOS 
visits. 
6.2.3. Clinical Global Impression of Improvement Scale
Each time the patient is seen during the treatment period (ie, at each in -clinic visit or during 
telephone contacts with non-
recording live video), the investigator compares the patient’s 
improvement in overall dy skinesia sy mptoms to the 1- week period just prior to the baseline visit 
(Busner and Targum 2007). The CGI -
S score obtained at the baseli ne visit (see Section 6.3.9) 
serves as a good basis for making this assessment. The CGI -I is a ClinRO that uses a 7 -point 
Likert scale that allows the clinician to compare the patient’s condition at the visit to the baseline 
condition as follows (with anchor points for choosing the most appropriate improvement level):
1=very  much improved since the initiation of treatment (nearl y all better; good level of 
functioning; minimal symptoms; represents a very  substantial change);
2=much improved (notably  better with significant reduction of s ymptoms; increase in the 
level of functioning but some sy mptoms remain);
3=minimally  improved (slightly  better with l ittle or no clinically  meaningful reduction of 
symptoms; represents very  little change in basic clinical status, level of care, or functional 
capacity ); 
4=no change from baseline (s ymptoms remain essentially  unchanged);
5=minimally  worse (slightly  worse b ut may  not be clinically  meaningful; may  represent very  
little change in basic clinical status or functional capacit y); 
6=much worse (clinicall y significant increase in symptoms and diminished functioning); 
7=very  much worse since the initiation of treat ment (severe exacerbation of sy mptoms and 
loss of functioning).

80The CGI -I administered at the in -clinic visits (week 3, week 7, week 9, week 12, week 15/ET, 
and week 16/EOS) will be included in the analy sis of the key  secondary  endpoint. Patients will 
alsobe assessed for CGI -I during telephone contacts (with non- recording live video) at week 1, 
week 2, week 4, week 5, and week 6.
6.2.4. Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale- Total Maximal Chorea
The UHDRS -TMC is part of the UHDRS -
TMS assessment and assesses th e severit y of chorea in 
the face, mouth, trunk, and the 4 extremities. The minimum score is 0 (absent) and the maximum 
score is 28 (marked/prolonged) ( Huntington Study  Group 1996 ).
A central reading of the UHDRS- TMC will be performed at baseline and at weeks 9, 12, 15/ET, 
and 16/EOS visits. The central rating will be done for all patients, based on the videos collected 
for the central rating of MD -CRS. Video review will be assessed periodically  in a blinded 
manner (eg, visit and investigator site rating) by a central review board. Central reading results 
performed b y the central raters will not be disclosed to the investigational site. Central reading 
details will be provided in a separate charter .
6.2.5. Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale -Total Maximal Dystonia
The UHDRS -Total Maximal Dy stonia (TMD) is part of the UHDRS -TMS assessment and 
assesses the severit y of dystonia in the trunk and the 4 extremities. The minimum score 
is0 (absent) and the maximum score is 20 (marked/pr olonged) ( Huntington Study  Group 1996). 
When rating d ystonia (question #11), buccal- oral-lingual and facial dy stonia (blepharospasm, 
jaw opening and closing) should be included in the assessment of the truncal region. 
Acentral reading of the UHDRS -TMD will be performed at baseline and at weeks 9, 12, 15/ET, 
and 16/EOS visits. The central rating will be done for all patients, based on the videos collected 
for the central rating of MD -CRS. Video review will be assessed pe riodically  in a blinded 
manner (eg, visit and investigator site rating) b y a central review board. Central reading results 
performed b y the central raters will not be disclosed to the investigational site. Central reading 
details will be provided in a sepa rate charter.
6.3. Other Efficacy Measures
6.3.1. Movement Disorder -Childhood Rating Scale Part I and Part II Total Scores
The MD -CRS part I and part II total score s will be evaluated b y the investigator at baseline, 
week 9, week 12, week 15/ET, and week 16/EOS visits .See Section 6.1and Section 6.2.1 for 
description of these rating scales.  
6.3.2. Movement Disorder -Childhood Rating Scale Global Index
The MD -CRS Global I ndex is a global measure of the MD -CRS that consolidates the 
information from parts I and II using the method of weighted means of the 2 normalized indexes 
obtained from each part ( Battini et al 2008 ). The minimum score is 0 and the maximum score 
is1.

816.3.3. Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale- Total Mo tor Score
The UHDRS comprises a broad assessment of features associated with HD. I t is a research tool 
that has been developed to provide a uniform assessment of the clinical features and course of 
HD. The Total Motor Score assessment of the UHDRS (UHDRS-T MS) comprises 15 items and 
assesses ey e movements, speech, alternating hand movements, dy stonia, chorea, and gait. The 
UHDRS -TMS is calculated as the sum of the 31 motor assessments; each of which range 
between 0 to 4. The minimum score is 0 (absent) and t he maximum score is 124 (worst) 
(Huntington Study  Group 1996 ).
The protocol refers to UHDRS -TMS as a phy sician -rated scale, but in certain instances, based on 
the experience of the rater, certain non- physicians may  be approved to rate the UHDRS -TMS.
The UHDRS -TMS is administered at baseline, week 9, week 12, and week 15/ET visits, and will 
be rated b y the investigator.
6.3.4. Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale- Total Maximal Chorea
The UHDRS -TMC is administered at baseline, week 9, week 12, and week 15/ET visits, and will 
be rated b y the investigator.
6.3.5. Unified Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale- Total Maximal Dystonia
The UHDRS -TMD is administered at baseline, week 9, week 12, and week 15/ET visits, and will 
be rated b y the investig ator.
6.3.6. Pediatric Evaluation Disability Inventory- Computer Adapted Test (Activities of 
Daily Living, Caregiver Completed, Content -Balanced Version)
The Pediatric Evaluation of Disability  Inventory  Computer Adaptive Test (PEDI -CAT) is a 
clinical assessment fo r children and y outh. The PEDI -CAT comprises a comprehensive item 
bank of 276 functional activities acquired throughout infancy , childhood, and y oung adulthood. 
This study  will use only  the caregiver report. The PEDI -CAT is recommended for use with 
childre n approaching 1 year of age and adults up to 21 years of age.
The PEDI -CAT (activities of daily  living [ADL ], caregiver completed, content -balanced version) 
measures function in 4 domains: (1) Daily  Activities; (2) Mobility ; (3) Social/Cognitive, and (4) 
Responsibility . Each domain is self -contained and can be used separatel y or with other domains. 
This study  will use only  the content -balanced version of the Dail y Activities domain ( Dumas and 
Fragala -Pinkham 2012). The content -balanced version presents a balance of items from each of 
the Daily  Activities domain’s content areas (Getting Dressed, Keeping Clean, Home Tasks, and 
Eating & Mealtime). A total of approximately  30 items are administered (total number of items 
administered is dependent upon the responses and decision tree path).
The PEDI -CAT (ADL, caregiver completed, content -balanced version) is administered at 
baseline and at week 15/ET visits. 
6.3.7. Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory, Cerebral Palsy Module
The Pediatric Qua lity of Life Inventory  (PedsQL™) is a health- related quality -of-life instrument 
that consists of a well -validated generic core measure and some condition and disease-specific 
modules ( Varni et al 2006 ). The 35- item PedsQL 3.0 CP module encompasses 7 scales: (1) Dail y 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
82Activities (9 items); (2) School Activities (4 items); (3) Movement and Balance (5 items); 
(4)Pain and Hurt (4 items); (5) Fatigue (4 items); (6) Eating Activities (5 items); and (7) Speech 
and Communication (4 it ems).
The scales comprise parallel child self -report and parent prox y-report formats. For children ages 
6 and 7 y ears and 8 to 12 y ears, a child self -report and a parent proxy  report are completed. The 
parent prox y report assesses parents’ perceptions of t heir child’s health- related quality  of life 
(QoL). For children ages 13 to 18 y ears, no parent proxy  report is required. The instructions ask 
how much of a problem each item has been during the past 1 month. A 5- point response scale is 
utilized across chil d self -report and parent prox y report as follows:
0=never a problem; 
1=almost never a problem;
2=sometimes a problem; 
3=often a problem; 
4=almost alway s a problem.
The PedsQL is administered at baseline and at week 15/ET visits. I nput from the caregiver is 
permitted.
6.3.8. Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale
The Patient Global Impression of I mprovement (PGI -I) is single item questionnaire to assess the 
patient’s impression of improvement in dy skinesia sy mptoms after initiating therapy . The scale 
is a patient -reported outcome that aims to evaluate all aspects of patients’ health and determine if 
there has been an overall improvement or not in dyskinesia sy mptoms. The PGI -I is to be 
completed before all other investigator -rated scales during visits whe re PGI -I is collected 
(Table 3). The patient has to select the 1 response from the visual response options (“emojis”) 
that gives the most accurate description of his/her state of health and overall status: 
1=much improved (since the initiation of treatment);
2=somewhat improved;
3=no change;
4=somewhat worse;
5=much worse (since the initiation of treatment). 
The PGI -I is administered at week 3, week 7, week 9, week 12, week 15/ET, and week 16/EOS 
visits. I nput from the caregiver is permitted.
6.3.9. Clinical Global Impression of Severity
Theinvestigator uses all available information and total clinical experience with this particular 
population to assess dy skinesia severit y over the past 1- week period prior to the CGI -S 
assessment on the patient ( Busner and Targ um 2007 ). The CGI -S uses a 7- point L ikert scale to 
assess dy skinesia severity  as follows (with anchor points for choosing the most appropriate 
severit y level caused b y DCP):
1=normal (not at all ill, symptoms of disorder not present past 7 day s);
2=borderl ine (subtle or suspected pathology );
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
833=mild (clearl y established sy mptoms with minimal, if any , distress or difficulty  in social 
and/or occupational function);
4=moderate (overt s ymptoms causing noticeable, but modest, functional impairment or 
distress; sy mptom level may  warrant medication);
5=marked (intrusive sy mptoms that distinctly  impair social/occupational function or cause 
intrusive levels of distress);
6=severe (disruptive s ymptoms, behavior and function are frequentl y influenced b y 
symptoms, may  require assistance from others);
7=extreme (s ymptoms drastically  interferes in many  life functions; may  be hospitalized).
The CGI -S is administered at screening, baseline, week 3, week 7, week 9, week 12, week 
15/ET, and week 16/EOS visits. I nput from the ca regiver is permitted.

847. ASSESSMENT OF  SAFETY
In this stud y, safety will be assessed b y qualified study  personnel and will include the evaluation 
of adverse events (and the number of patients who withdraw from the stud y due to adverse 
events), vital signs, l aboratory  tests (hematology, chemistry , and urinal ysis), ECG measurements, 
CBCL , ESRS, ESS, and the children’s C -SSRS . The investigator should review all scales and 
questionnaires in a timely manner for any potential reporting of adverse events and documen t 
this review accordingl y.
For COVID -19 updates, refer to 
Appendix M.
7.1. Adverse Events
7.1.1. Definition of an Adverse Event
Any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily  have to have a causal relationship with this 
treatment.
An adverse event can, therefore, be an y unfavorable and unintended ph ysical sign, s ymptom, or 
laboratory  parameter that develops or worsens in severit y during the course of thisstudy , or 
significant worsening of the disease under study  or of any  concurrent disease, whether or not 
considered related to TEV -50717. A new condition or the wor sening of a pre -existing condition 
will be considered an adverse event. Stable chronic conditions (such as arthritis) that are present 
before stud y entry  and do not worsen during thisstudy  will not be considered adverse events.
Accordingl y, an adverse eve nt can include an y of the following:
intercurrent illnesses
physical injuries
events possibly  related to concomitant medication
significant worsening (change in nature, severit y, or frequency) of the disease under 
study  or other pre- existing conditions
(Note: A condition recorded as pre -existing that is intermittently  symptomatic [eg, 
headache] and that occurs during this study  should be recorded as an adverse event.)
drug interactions
events occurring during diagnostic procedures or during an y washout phas e of this
study
laboratory  or diagnostic test abnormalities that result in the withdrawal of the patient 
from the study , are associated with clinical signs and sy mptoms or a serious adverse 
event, require medical treatment or further diagnostic work-up, or are considered b y 
the investigator to be clinically  significant
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
85(Note: Abnormal laboratory  or diagnostic test results at the screening visit that 
preclude a patient from entering the stud y or receiving stud y treatment are not 
considered adverse events.)
7.1.2. Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events
For recording of adverse events, the study  period is defined for each patient as the time period 
from signature of the ICF to the end of the follow -up period. The follow -up period of recording 
of adverse events is d efined as 2 weeks after the last dose of IMP or up to baseline/day  1 in the 
open -label extension Study TV50717 -CNS -30081 (whichever comes first) or 2 weeks after the 
ET visit for patients who terminate early  from the study .
All adverse events that occur du ring the defined study  period must be recorded both on the 
source documentation and the CRF, regardless of the severit y of the event or judged relationship 
to the I MP. For serious adverse events, the serious adverse event form must be completed, and 
the se rious adverse event must be reported immediately  (Section 7.1.5.3.1). The investigator 
does not need to activel y monitor patients for adverse events after the defined periods.
At each contact with the patient, the investiga tor or designee must question the patient and/or 
parent(s)/ caregiver (as applicable) about adverse events by  asking an open- ended question such 
as “Have you had an y unusual symptoms or medical problems since the last visit? I f yes, please 
describe.” All re ported or observed signs and s ymptoms will be recorded individually , except 
when considered manifestations of a medical condition or disease state. A precise diagnosis will 
be recorded whenever possible. When such a diagnosis is made, all related signs, s ymptoms, and 
any test findings will be recorded collectivel y as a single diagnosis on the CRF and, if it is a 
serious adverse event, on the serious adverse event form.
The clinical course of each adverse event will be monitored at suitable intervals until r esolved, 
stabilized, or returned to baseline; until the patient is referred for continued care to a health care 
professional; or until a determination of a cause unrelated to the IMP or study  procedure is made. 
Adverse events of patients rolling over to th e open -label extension Study
 TV50717- CNS -30081 
will continue to be monitored as part of the open -label extension study . 
To enable the assessment of the potential relationship of an adverse event and plasma 
concentration of IMP and metabolites, blood sampl es will be collected based on the scenarios 
described in Table 9. 
The onset and end dates, duration (in case of adverse event duration of less than 24hours), action 
taken regarding IMP, treatment administered, and outcome for each adverse event must be 
recorded both on the source documentation and the CRF.
The relationship of each adverse event to IMP and study  procedures and the severit y and 
serious ness of each adverse event, as judged by the investigator, must be recorded as described 
below.
Further details are given in the Safety  Monitoring Plan.

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
867.1.3. Severity of an Adverse Event
The severit y of each adverse event must be recorded as one of the followin g:
Mild: No limitation of usual activities
Moderate: Some limitation of usual activities
Severe: Inability  to carry  out usual activities
7.1.4. Relationship of an Adverse Event to the Investigational Medicinal Product
The relationship of an adverse event to the IMP is characterized in Table 7as follows :
Table 7: The Relationshi p of an Adverse Event to the IMP
Term Definition Clarification
No reasonable 
possibility
(not related)This category applies to adverse 
events that, after careful 
consideration, are clearly due to 
extraneous causes (disease, 
environment, etc) or to advers e 
events that, after careful medical 
consideration at the time they are 
evaluated, are judged to be unrelated 
to the IMP.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered 
“no reasonable possibility” if it is clearly due to 
extraneous causes or if at least 2 of the following apply:
1.It does not follow  a reasonable temporal sequence 
from the administration of the IMP.
2.It could readily have been produced by the patient’s 
clinical state, environmental or toxic factors, or other 
modes of therapy administere d to the patient.
3.It does not follow  a known pattern of response to the 
IMP.
4.It does not reappear or w orsen when the IMP is 
re-administered.
Reasonable 
possibility
(related)This category applies to adverse 
events for which, after careful 
medical consideration at the time 
they are evaluated, a connection with 
the administration of IMP cannot be 
ruled out with certainty.The relationship of an adverse event may be considered 
“reasonable possibility” if at least 2 of the following 
apply:
1.It follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the IMP.
2.It cannot be reasonably explained by the known 
characteristics of the patient’s clinical state, 
environmental or toxic factors, or other modes of 
therapy administered to the patient.
3.It disap pears or decreases on cessation or reduction in 
dose. There are important exceptions when an 
adverse event does not disappear after 
discontinuation of the IMP, yet an IMP relationship 
clearly exists.
4.It follows a known pattern of response to the IMP.
IMP=investigational medicinal product.
7.1.5. Serious Adverse Events
For recording of serious adverse events, the stud y period is defined for each patient as that time 
period from signature of the I CF to the end of the follow -up period as defined in Section 7.1.2 . 
Serious adverse events occurring in a patient after the end of the follow -up period should be 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
87reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them, following the procedures 
described in Section 7.1.5.3.1 .
7.1.5.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event
A serious adverse event is an adverse event occurring at an y dose that results in any  of the 
following outcomes or actions:
results in death
is life -threatening adverse event (ie, the patient was at risk of death at the time of the 
event); it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it 
were more severe
requires inpatient hospitalizati on or prolongation of existing hospitalization, which 
means that hospital inpatient admission or prolongation of hospital stay  were required 
for treatment of an adverse event, or that they occurred as a consequence of the event
Hospitalizations scheduled b efore the patient signed the ICF will not be considered 
serious adverse events, unless there was worsening of the preexisting condition 
during the patient’s participation in this study .
results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity  (refers to a substantial 
disruption of one’s ability to conduct normal life functions)
is a congenital anomal y/birth defect
an important medical event that may  not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization, but may  jeopardize the patient and ma y require medical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition
Examples of such events are intensive treatment in an emergency  room or at home for 
allergic bronchospasm, blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
hospita lization, or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse. Note: Any  
suspected transmission of an infectious agent via a medicinal product is considered an 
important medical event.
All occurrences of possible drug -induced liver injury  that meet Hy ’s law criteria, defined as all 
of the below, must be reported by the investigator to the sponsor as a serious adverse event:
ALT or AST increase of >3× ULN
total bilirubin increase of >2× ULN
absence of initial findings of cholestasis (ie, no substantial increase of ALP)
An adverse event that does not meet an y of the criteria for seriousness listed above will be 
regarded as a nonserious adverse event.
7.1.5.2. Expectedness
A serious adverse event that is not included in the Adverse Reaction section of the relevant 
reference safet y information (RSI ) by its specificity, severit y, outcome, or frequency is 
considered an unexpected adverse event. The RSI for this study  is the IB.
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
88A serious adverse event that is not included in the listing of adverse reactions in the RSI  by its 
specificit y, severity, outcome, or frequency is considered an unexpected adverse event.
The sponsor’s GPSP will determine the expectedness for all serious adverse events.
For the purpose of SUSAR reporting, the version of the IB at the time of occur rence of the 
SUSAR applies.
7.1.5.3. Reporting a Serious Adverse Event
7.1.5.3.1. Investigator Responsibility
To satisfy  regulatory  requirements, a ll serious adverse events that occur during the study , 
regardless of judged relationship to administration of the IMP, must be re ported to the sponsor 
by the investigator. The event must be reported within 24 hours of when the investigator learns 
about it. Completing the serious adverse event form and reporting the event must not be delay ed, 
even if not all the information is available. The investigator does not need to activel y monitor 
patients for adverse events once this study  has ended.
Serious adverse events occurring to a patient after the last administration of I MP of that patient 
has ended should be reported to the sponsor if the investigator becomes aware of them .
The serious adverse event form should be sent to the local safet y officer (LSO) or designee (a 
contract research organization [CRO] in a country without a sponsor L SO) (contact information 
is in the Clinical Study  Personnel Contact Information section); the L SO will forward the report 
to the sponsor’s GPSP.
The following information should be provided to record the event accurately  and completel y:
study  number
investigator and investigational center identification
pa
tient number
onset date and detailed description of adverse event
investigator’s assessment of the relationship of the adverse event to the IMP (no 
reasonable possibility , reasonable possibility )
Additional information includes:
age and sex of patient
date of first dose of IMP
date and amount of last administered dose of IMP
action taken
outcome, if known
severit y
explanation of assessment of relatedness
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
89concomitant medication (including doses, routes of administration, and regimens) and 
treatment of the event
pertinent laboratory  or other diagnostic test data
medical and ps ychiatric history
results of dechallenge/rechallenge, if known
for an adverse event resulting in death
cause of death (whether or not the death was related to I MP)
autopsy  findings (if available)
Each report of a serious adverse event will be reviewed and evaluated b y the investigator and the 
sponsor to assess the nature of the event and the relationship of the event to the I MP, study  
procedures, and to underlying diseases.
Additional information (follow -up) about an y serious adverse event unavailable at the initial 
reporting should be forwarded b y the investigator within 24 hours of when it becomes known to 
the same address as the initial report.
For all countries, the sponsor’s GPSP wil l distribute the Council for International Organizations 
of Medical Sciences form/Extensible Markup Language file to the LSO/CRO for submission to 
the competent authorities, I ndependent Ethics Committees (I ECs)/Institutional Review Boards 
(IRBs), and investigators, according to regulations. The investigator must ensure that the 
IEC/IRB is also informed of the event, in accordance with national and local regulations.
Blinding will be maintained for all stud y personnel. Therefore, in case of an SUSAR, only the 
LSO/CRO will receive the unblinded report for regulatory submission; the others will receive a 
blinded report.
7.1.5.3.2. Sponsor Responsibility
If a serious unexpected adverse event is believed to be related to the IMP or study  procedures, 
the sponsor will take appropriate steps to notify  all investigators participating in sponsored 
clinical studies of TEV -50717 and the appropriate competent authorities (and I EC/IRB, as 
appropriate).
In addition to notify ing the investigators and competent authorities (and IEC/IRB, as 
appropriate), other action may  be required, including the following:
altering existing research by  modify ing the protocol
discontinuing or suspending the stud y
modify ing the existing consent form and informing all study  participants of new 
findings
modify ing listings of expected toxicities to include adverse events newl y identified as 
related to TEV -50717

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
907.1.6. Protocol -Defined Adverse Events of Special Interest
No protocol -defined adverse events of special interest for expedited reporting were identified f or 
this study . Events of drug -induced parkinsonism, changes in behavior, and sleepiness will be 
monitored using standardized scores and presented as part of safet y analysis (see Section 7.2).
7.1.7. Protocol Deviations Because of an Adverse Event
If a patient experiences an adverse event or medical emergency , deviations from the protocol 
may be allowed on a case -by-case basis. To ensure patient safety , afte r the event has stabilized or 
treatment has been administered (or both), the investigator or other physician in attendance must 
contact the ph ysician identified in the Clinical Study  Personnel Contact Information section of 
this protocol as soon as possibl e to discuss the situation. The investigator, in consultation with 
the sponsor, will decide whether the patient should continue to participate in the study  
(Section 4.3).
7.2. Safety Rating Scales
Site-administered safet y scales include the children’s C- SSRS (Posner et al 2011) , CBCL, ESRS
(Chouinard and Margolese 2005 ), and ESS ( Janssen et al 2017 ). The investigator should review 
all scales and questionnaires in a timely  manner for any  potential reporting of adverse events and 
document this review accordingl y. At each stud y visit, as applicable, the inv estigator should 
compare the current scores to the baseline scores.
7.2.1. Children’s Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale
The children’s C -SSRS Baseline/Screening scale assesses past and current suicidal ideation and 
behaviors to determine suicide risk and is administered at screening. The children’s C -SSRS 
Since Last Visit scale is administered at baseline, weeks 3, 7, 9, 12, 15/ET, and 16. The 
children’s C -SSRS questionnaire will be presented to patients ≥12 y ears of age at screening or 
11
years of age at screening but will turn 12 y ears of age during the study . Children 13 years of age 
and under must be interviewed in conju nction with the caregiver as appropriate or defined by  the 
scale. For children over 13 years of age, parent/legally  accepted representative involvement is 
strongl y encouraged. Questions should be directed to the child, but the caregiver parent/legall y 
accepted representative should be encouraged to add relevant information.
The children’s C-SSRS is an interview by  trained study  personnel. 
The frequency  and severity  of suicidal ideation or behavior according to the children’s C- SSRS 
questionnaire will be pr esented by  visit and by  treatment group. A shift table for children’s 
C-SSRS categories at baseline, compared to the worst (highest) category  during the treatment 
period, will be presented. 
7.2.2. Child Behavior Checklist (for Ages 6 -18)
The CBCL assesses behavi oral and emotional status in children ages 6 through 18 years of age as 
reported b y the caregiver ( Achenbach and Ruffle 2000 ; Achenbach 2005). The full CBCL has 
two parts, a Competence Scale (Part s I to VII) and a Sy ndrome Scale (behavioral items).
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
91The Competence Scale ( Parts I  to VII) assesses various activities (eg, sports, hobbies, games, 
organizations, clubs, teams, groups, jobs, and chores), interpersonal relationships, and academic 
performanc e. 
The Sy ndrome Scale comprises 113 questions related to problem behaviors. This study  will use a 
recall period of “now or within the last week,” representing a modification from the original 
scale, which was “now or within the last 6 months”. For each it em, the caregiver will circle 0 if 
the item is not true of their child, 1 if the item is somewhat or sometimes true, and 2 if the item is 
very true or often true. 
The CBCL is part of the Achenbach Sy stem of Empirically  Based Assessment that identifies 
syndromes that are behavioral clusters that indicate certain ty pes of behavioral, social, or 
emotional problems ( Achenbach and Rescorla 2004 ). The problem behaviors are scored on the 
following 8 empirically  based s yndromes: anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed, somatic 
complaints, social problems, thought problems, attention problems, rule -breaking behavior, and 
aggressive behavior. 
The Competence and Syndrome Scales are displayed on profiles in relation to gender and age -
specific percentiles and T scores based on national normative samples. 
The full CBCL assessment (Competence and S yndrome Scales) will be completed at screening 
and at week 15/ET. Onl y the CBCL  Syndrome scale will be completed at baseline, weeks 3, 7, 9, 
12, and 16/EOS.
7.2.3.
Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale
The ESRS was designed to assess 4 ty pes of drug -induced movement disorders: parkinsonism, 
akathisia, dy stonia, and TD (Chouinard and Margolese 2005 ). In this study , parkinsonism and 
akathisia will be evaluated with subscales I (subjective questionnaire) and II (evaluation for 
parkinsonism/akathisia). The ESRS is administered at screening; baseline; and weeks 3, 7, 9, 12, 
15/ET, and 16/EOS.
The subscale I of the ESRS questionnaire rates subjective parkinsonism/akathisia at periods other 
than the day  of examinations during the last 7 day s. It is scored on a 4 -point scale (0=Absent, 
1=Mild, 2=Moderate, or 3=Severe). The evaluation takes into account the verbal report of the 
patient on: 1)the frequency  and duration of the symptom during the day , 2) the number of day s 
the sy mptom was present during the last week, and 3) the subjective evaluatio n of the intensity  
of the sy mptom by  the patient. 
The subscale II of the ESRS questionnaire for evaluation of parkinsonism and akathisia includes 
17 items with scores ranging from 0 -102 to assess the following: tremor (0– 48), gait and posture 
(0–6), postural stability  (0-6), rigidity  (0–24), expressive automatic movements (0 –6), 
bradykinesia (0 -6), and akathisia (0–6).
7.2.4. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (for Children and Adolescents)
The ESS is a self-administered questionnaire composed of 8 questions that provide a measure of 
a patient’s general level of day time sleepiness ( Johns 1991 ). Johns (2015) proposed the ESS as 
the official modified version of the ESS for children and adolescents. In 2017, Janssen et al
published results of their validation anal ysis and concluded that the ESS developed for children 
and adolescents is a reliable and internall y valid measure of day time sleepiness in adolescents 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
9212to 18 y ears of age, but f urther studies are needed to establish the internal validity  of the 
questionnaire for children under 12 years and the external validity  and accuracy  of cut -off points 
for children and adolescents. 
For patients 6 to 12 years of age, the ESS will be complet ed by  the caregiver. For patients 
≥13years of age, the ESS will be completed by  the patient .Input from the caregiver is permitted .
The ESS is administered at screening; baseline; and weeks 3, 7, 9, 12, 15/ET, and 16/EOS. The 
ESS asks respondents to rate, on a 4 -point L ikert scale (0 –3), their usual chances of dozing off or 
falling asleep in different situations or activities that most people engage in as part of their daily 
lives. The total ESS score is the sum of 8 item scores and can range between 0 and 24 with the
higher the score indicating a higher level of daytime sleepiness. Most people can complete the 
ESS without assistance in 2 or 3 minutes.
Categories
0=would never fall asleep
1=slight chance of falling asleep
2=moderate chance of falling asleep
3=high chance of falling asleep
7.3. Pregnancy
Any female patient becoming pregnant during the study  will discontinue IMP.
All pregnancies of female patients participating in the study  that occur during the study  or within 
14days after the end of study  are to be reported immediately  to the individual identified in the 
Clinical Study  Personnel Contact I nformation section of this protocol, and the investigator must 
provide the sponsor with the completed pregnancy form. The process for reporting a pregnancy  
is the same as that for reporting a serious adverse event but using the pregnancy form 
(Section 7.1.5.3). 
The investigator is not required to report patients who are found to be pregnant between 
screening and baseline, provided no IMP was given. All female patients who become pregnant 
will be monitored for the outcome of the pregnancy (including spontaneous, elective, or 
voluntary  abortion). If the pre gnancy  continues to term, the outcome (health of the infant up to 
8weeks of age), including details of birth and presence or absence of an y birth defect, congenital 
abnormalities, or maternal and newborn complications, will be reported to the sponsor. An y
complication of pregnancy  during the study  and any  complication of pregnancy  that the 
investigator becomes aware of after withdrawal from the study  will be reported as an adverse 
event or serious adverse event, as appropriate.
Note: Female partners’ pregnancies of male participants are not required to be proactivel y 
monitored.

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
93If the pregnancy  in the female patient participating in the study  does not continue to term, oneof 
the following actions will be taken:
For a spontaneous abortion, report as a serious adverse event and also complete the 
pregnancy  form .
For an elective abortion due to developmental anomalies, report as a serious adverse 
event and also complete the pregnancy  form .
For an elective abortion notdue to developmental anomalies, comple te the pregnancy  
form; do not report as an adverse event.
7.4. Medication Error and Special Situations Related to the 
Investigational Medicinal Products
Any administration of IMP that is not in accordance with the study  protocol should be reported 
in the CRF an d in the patient’s source documents as a deviation if the event meets the deviation 
criteria specified in the protocol ( Appendix D), regardless of w hether or not an adverse event 
occurs as a result.
The following are t ypes of medication errors and special situations:
1.Medication error: An y unintentional error in the prescribing, dispensing, or 
administration of a medicinal product while in the control of the healthcare professional, 
patient, or consumer.
2.Overdose: Administration of a quantity  of a medicinal product given per administration 
or cumulatively , which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the 
authorized product information. Clini cal judgment should always be applied. Any dose of 
IMP (whether the test IMP, or placebo IMP), whether taken intentionall y or 
unintentionally , in excess of that prescribed must be immediately  reported to the sponsor.
3.Misuse: Situations where the I MP is intentionally  and inappropriately  used not in 
accordance with the authorized product information.
4.Abuse: Persistent or sporadic, intentional excessive use of IMP, which is accompanied by  
harmful ph ysical or ps ychological effects.
5.Off-label use: Situations whe re an IMP is intentionally  used for a medical purpose not in 
accordance with the authorized product information.
6.Occupational exposure: Exposure to an I MP, as a result of one’s professional or non -
professional occupation.
7. Breastfeeding: Suspected adverse r eactions that occur in infants following exposure to a 
medicinal product from breast milk.
7.5. Clinical Laboratory Tests
All clinical laboratory  test results outside of the reference range will be judged by  the 
investigator as belonging to one of the following categories:
abnormal and not clinically  significant
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
94abnormal and clinically  significant
A laboratory  test result that is judged by  the investigator as clinicall y significant will be recorded 
both on the source documentation and the CRF as an adverse event and monitored as described 
in Section 7.1.2. An event may  include a laboratory  or diagnostic test abnormality  (once 
confirmed b y repeated testing) that results in the withdrawal of the patient from the study , the 
temporary  or permanent withdrawal of IMP or medical treatment, or further diagnostic work-up. 
(Note: Abnormal laboratory  or diagnostic test results at the screening visit that preclude a patient 
from entering the stud y or receiving IMP are not considered adverse events.)

7.5.1. Serum Chemistry, Hematology, and Urinalysis
Clinical laboratory  tests (serum chemistry , hematology  and coagulation, and urinaly sis) will be 
performed at screening, week 15, and week 16, as detailed in Table 3. Clinical laboratory  tests 
will be performed using the central laboratory .Specific laboratory  tests to be performed are 
provided in Table 8. Laboratory  tests performed at screening may  be repeated to determine 
patient eligibility .

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
957.5.2. Other Clinical Laboratory Tests
7.5.2.1. Beta -Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Tests
β-HCG tests in urine will be performed for all female patients aged 12 years or older of 
childbearing potential at baseline and other in- clinic visits as detailed in Table 3. The β -HCG 
tests in serum will be performed for all female patients aged 12 y ears or older of childbearing 
potential at screening and week 15 and if clinically  indicated.
For COVID -19 updates, refer to Appendix M.
7.5.2.2. Urine Drug Screen
A urine drug screen will be performed at the time points specified in 
Table 3. A urine drug 
screen performed at screening may  be repeated to determine patient eligibility .
The urine drug screen detects the presence of drugs of abuse. Additionally , the urine drug screen 
will detect the presence of drugs prohibited according to the laboratory  manual. If a given 
parameter cannot be tested using urine, or if the investigator considers that additional testing is 
needed, an alternative matrix (eg, serum) may  be considered acceptable. Such tests may  be 
perform ed locall y. The sponsor’s medical expert must be made aware in advance of, and provide 
approval for, drug screen parameters to which this will apply .
A positive result for an y drugs of abuse or their metabolites or drugs prohibited according to the 
laborat ory manual, without medical explanation, will preclude the patient from 
randomization/enrollment or continued participation in the study . Some of the drugs listed in this 
urine drug screen may  be permitted in certain cases when the particular medication is being used 
under a ph ysician’s or clinician’s guidance and in compliance with the physician’s or clinician’s 
recommendation for a specific condition (for example, phenobarbital [barbiturates] for seizures, 
stimulant medications [including amphetamine, met hylphenidate, and lisdexamfetamine] for 
attention deficit hy peractivity  disorder, and opiates or oxy codone for pain) and if the dosing has 
been stable for at least 4 weeks before screening and no changes to dose or frequency  are 
anticipated during the cour se of the study. Such cases should be discussed with the medical 
monitor. Patients who either are using these medications or have a positive drug screen for these 
substances or derivatives should be submitted to the medical monitor for consideration of 
participation in this study . Patients with a substance use disorder are excluded from this clinical 
trial. However, if per the investigator’s judgment, a patient does not meet the criteria for 
substance use disorder, a positive drug screen result for these me dications or derivatives, without 
medical explanation, should be discussed on a case -by-case basis with the medical monitor to 
determine the patient’s eligibility , based on the information available.
For COVID -19 updates, refer to 
Appendix M.
7.6. Physical Examination
Physical examinations, including height and weight, general appearance, skin, head, ey es, ears, 
nose, throat, neck, l ymph nodes, cardiovascula r, respiratory , musculoskeletal, abdominal, and 
extremities will be performed at the time points detailed in Table 3. 
Weight must be measured with shoes and outerwear off.
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
96Any new physical examination finding (ie, since the screening visit) that is judged b y the 
investigator as clinicall y significant will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the CRF, 
and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2. 
Investigators should pay  special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious diseases.
7.7. Vital Signs
Vital signs (bl ood pressure [sy stolic/diastolic] , respiratory  rate, bod y temperature, and pulse) will 
be measured at the time points detailed in Table 3. All abnormal vital signs will be judged b y the 
investigator as belonging to one of the following categories:
abnormal and not clinically  significant
abnormal and clinically  significant
Before blood pressure and pulse are measured, the patient must rest in a supine or 
semi -erect/seated position for at least 3 minutes. (The same position and arm or leg should be 
used each time vital signs are measured for a given patient.) Orthostatic blood pressure and pulse 
will be measured after the patient is in a standing position f or at least 3 minutes (for patients who 
are able to stand). For patients who find standing difficult or do not allow for a reliable blood 
pressure and pulse measurement, alternative methods to collect orthostatic blood pressure and 
pulse should be discusse d with the medical monitor. For an y abnormal vital sign value, the 
measurement should be repeated as soon as possible. Any  vital sign value that is judged by  the 
investigator as clinicall y significant will be recorded both on the source documentation and t he 
CRF as an adverse event and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2.
7.8. Electrocardiography
A 12 -lead ECG will be recorded at the time points detailed in Table 3. All ECGs will be 
performed after at least 5 minutes rest in a supine or semi -supine position. 
The ECG ty pes are defined as follow s:
A “standard ECG” is a “standard” 10 -second 12 -lead ECG.
A “summary  ECG” is a continuously  recorded ECG of longer than 
30 seconds. For a 
“summary  ECG,” the minimal recommended duration is 2 minutes or longer, and the 
preferred duration is 5 minutes (as i t provides the most robust result). If a “summary  
ECG” is less than 2 minutes, data will still be captured and anal yzed to the extent 
possible.
The investigator should review the ECG at screening to determine patient eligibility  
for the stud y and subseque nt ECGs for the patient’s continuation in the study . All 
ECGs should be reviewed by  the investigator for any  clinically  significant findings 
during the visit and before the patient leaves the clinic. A qualified ph ysician at a 
central diagnostic center wil l be interpreting the ECG.
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
97All ECG results outside of the reference ranges will be judged by  the investigator as belonging to 
one of the following categories:
abnormal and not clinically  significant 
abnormal and clinically  significant
Any ECG finding that is judged by  the investigator as clinicall y significant (except at the 
screening visit) will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the source documentation and 
in the CRF, and monitored as described in Section 7.1.2.
The criteria for an abnormal post-baseline QTcF are a value >500 msec or change from 
screening >60 msec . If one of 
these criteria is met, the investigator must further evaluate the 
QTcF as follows: 
If a standard ECG is abnormal and meets the above protocol criteria, 
oA 5-minute summary  ECG recording should be performed at the research site ,
and a repeat standard ECG is not required. The site should follow the process to 
have these ECGs read b y Spaulding. 
oIf a5-minute summary  ECG cannot be performed (for instance, if patient is 
evaluated at a facility other than the research site, and the summary  ECG is not 
available), the investigator should obtain 2 repeat standard ECGs and determine 
the average of these 3 post-screening QTcF values. The site should foll
ow the 
process to have these ECGs read b y Spaulding.  
The investigator should then compare the post -screening QTcF values to the 
pre-treatment QTcF values at screening. As noted above, the post
-screening QTcF 
values will use either the average QTcF from t he 3 post -screening standard ECGs or 
the QTcF from the summary  ECG. The IMP must be stopped for any  confirmed 
post-baseline QTcF average value >500 msec or average increase from screening 
>60msec.
Note: Abnormal ECG results at week 3 and week 7 or at an unscheduled visit may  result in 
patient withdrawal from the study  as detailed in Section 4.3.
7.9. Assessment of Suicidality
TEV -50717 is considered to be central nervous system -active. In addition, there have been some 
reports of suicidal ideation or behavior as reported in the product label when it has been given to 
some patients with certain conditions. The sponsor considers it important to monitor for such 
events before and during this clinical study .
Some central nervous sy stem -active IMPs may  be associated with an increased risk of suicidal 
ideation or behavior when given to some patients with certain conditions. Although this IMP or 
other similar me
dicinal products in this class have not been shown to be associated with an 
increased risk of suicidal thinking or behavior when given to this study  population, the sponsor 
considers it important to monitor for such events before or during this clinical st udy.
The study  population being administered with TEV -50717 should be monitored appropriatel y 
and observed closel y for suicidal ideation and behavior or an y other unusual changes in 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
98behavior. Consideration should be given to discontinuing TEV -50717 in pati ents who experience 
signs of suicidal ideation or behavior.
Families and caregivers of patients being treated with TEV -50717 should be instructed to 
monitor patients for the emergence of unusual changes in behavior, as well as the emergence of 
suicidal ide ation and behavior, and to report such sy mptoms immediately  to the study  
investigator.
Baseline assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior and treatment -emergent suicidal ideation 
and behavior will be assessed during the study  using the children’s C -SSRS described in 
Section 7.2.
Patients with a positive children’s C-SSRS suicidal ideation score on either items 1 or 2 must be 
1)discussed with the study  medical monitor, 2) re -evaluated within 2 to 3 day s in a clinic visit, 
and 3) treated according to the investigator's medical judgment. Consultation with a 
child/adolescent ps ychiatrist or licensed child/adolescent mental health provider is advised, 
followed b y close ongoing monitoring.
If patients endorse or report a children’s C
-SSRS suicidal ideation score of 3, 4, or 5, the patients 
will be evaluated immediately  by the investigator and referred for ps ychiatric evaluation. The 
medical monitor will be immediately  consulted. If it is determined by  the investigator, the 
medical monitor, and consulting psy chiatrist that exposure to the I MP may  have contributed to a 
change in children’s C- SSRS and/or increased depressive s ymptoms, study  medication will b e 
immediately  discontinued and the patient will be terminated from the stud y. In cases where it is 
determined that IMP did not contribute to changes in depression or suicidality , the investigator 
will consult with the medical monitor, consulting psy chiatri st, and/or sponsor to determine 
whether the patient should continue in the study .
If patients report an y suicidal behavior that is an actual attempt as assessed in the children’s
C-SSRS, they  will be evaluated immediately  by the investigator, referred for psychiatric 
evaluation, and terminated from the study .
If patients report an y suicidal behavior that is interrupted, aborted, or preparatory as assessed in 
the children’s C-SSRS, they  will be evaluated immediately  by the investigator and referred for 
psychiatric evaluation. In cases where it is determined in the psy chiatric evaluation that IMP did 
not contribute to changes in suicidal behavior, the investigator will consult with the medical 
monitor, consulting psy chiatrist, and/or sponsor to determine whether the patient should continue 
in the study .
7.10. Assessment of Depression
Families and caregivers of patients are instructed to monitor the patients for any  changes in or 
new onset of depressive symptoms and unusual changes in mood, cognition, or behavior, and to 
report such s ymptoms immediately  to the investigator. Telephone contacts (with non- recording 
live video) and clinic visits also allow opportunities for the investigator to assess adverse events.
If a relevant change in status is identified, patients will be seen immediately  for an unscheduled 
visit by  the investigator and discussed with the medical monitor. The patient will be referred for 
further ps ychiatric evaluation if there is an y suspicion of experiencing depression. The 
investigator will record t hese s ymptoms as an adverse event of depression. If it is determined by  
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
99the investigator, after consultation with the medical monitor and consulting psy chiatrist, that 
exposure to the I MP may have contributed to the adverse event of depression, study  medication 
will be immediately  discontinued and the patient will be terminated from the study . Follow -up 
with a pediatric ps ychiatrist or licensed child/adolescent mental health provider will be arranged.
In cases where it is determined that I MP did not contrib ute to the adverse event of depression, 
the investigator will consult with the medical monitor and/or sponsor to determine whether the 
patient should continue in the study .
7.11. Neurological Examinations
Neurological examination, including mental status, crania l nerves, motor sy stem (strength, tone, 
and posture), coordination, gait and balance, tendon reflexes, and sensation, will be performed at 
the time points detailed in Table 3. An y neurological examination finding that is judged b y the 
investigator as a potentially  clinically significant change (worsening) compared with the baseline 
value will be considered an adverse event, recorded on the CRF, and monitored as described in 
Section 7.1.2 .
7.12. Concomitant Medication or Treatment
Concomitant therapy or medication usage will be monitored throughout the study according to 
time points detailed in Table 3. Parents/patients will be instructed during the course of the stud y 
to notify  the investigator if any  new medication is prescribed/administered (other than 
TEV -50717) or if there is any change in current medications, including over -the-counter 
medications. Any  new prescribed/administered medication and/or an y change in current 
prescribed/administered medication should be reviewed with the investigator. 
Patients may  be included in this study  if they  are using cannabis or formulations or derivatives of 
cannabis in relatively  stable amounts, for medical purposes (where applicable according to local 
regulation), under the guidance, supervision, or prescription of a clinician and antici pated to 
remain stable (dose and frequency ) within the study  duration . Patients who are either using 
cannabis or its derivatives or formulations or patients who have a positive drug screen for 
cannabis or its derivatives or formulations can be submitted to the medical monitor for 
consideration of participation in this study . Patients with a substance use disorder are excluded 
from this clinical trial. If per the investigator’s judgment, however, a patient does not meet the 
criteria for substance use disorde r, a positive drug screen for cannabis or its metabolites, without 
medical explanation, will be discussed on a case- by-case basis between the research site, the 
Medical Monitor, and the sponsor to determine the patient’s eligibility , based on the informati on 
available. Patients should be advised that the recreational use of cannabis or its derivatives or 
formulations should be avoided during this study . 
Medications that are allowed, provided that conditions outlined in the table are met, are shown in 
Appen dix H, Table 10. Certain considerations mentioned in the table require the review of the 
medical monitor. Changes to the allowed medications may  be permit ted in the context of this 
study  and should be discussed with the medical monitor. If the wellbeing of the patient and the 
urgency  of the clinical decision do not allow discussion with the medical monitor prior to the 
medication change, the investigator sh ould notify the medical monitor in a timely  manner 
following this decision.
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
100The medical monitor must be contacted if a patient is receiving (or has to begin or stop receiving 
during the stud y) a medication that is associated with QT prolongation or that is a known strong 
CYP2D6 inhibitor. Prohibited medications that are associated with QT prolongation are listed in 
Appendix H, Table 11.
7.13. Methods and Time P oints of Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing 
Safety Data
All adverse events will be reviewed on a periodic basis by  the clinical project phy sician/medical 
monitor according to the safet y monitoring plan (eg, scheduled safet y reviews for TEV -50717) 
as preli minary  safety databases become available. I n addition, t he iDMC will perform the 
unblinded IA and take part in safet y monitoring throughout the stud y.
Methods and time points of assessing safety  data are discussed in Section 3.4
. Procedures for 
recording safet y data are discussed in Appendix K, and methods of anal yses are discussed in
Section 9.8.

1039. STATISTICS
This section describes the statistical anal ysis as foreseen at the time of planning the study . 
Changes, additions, and further details about the analy ses will be described in the statistical 
analysis plan (SAP). After finalization of the SAP, any  additiona l anal yses or changes to 
analyses that may  be required will be fully  disclosed in the CSR.
For COVID -19 updates, refer to Appendix M.
9.1. Sample Size and Power Considerations
The initial sample size estimation of approximately 185 patients randomized to TEV -50717 
versus placebo in a 2:1 ratio (approximately  124 in the TEV -50717 group; approximately  61 in 
the placebo group) is the sample size required to ob tain a statistically  significant result in the 
primary  anal ysis based on a 1 -sided test for mean difference at a significance level of α=0.025 
with a power of approximately  90%, assuming a mean difference of 1.8 and a standard deviation 
(SD) of 3.5 in each treatment group. 
At the time of writing Amendment 05, the initially planned sample size has been reduced to 
approximately  65patients randomized to TEV -50717 versus placebo in a 2:1 ratio 
(approximately  43in the TEV -50717 group; approximately  22 in the placebo group).
The initial assumptions regarding the mean difference and SD are based on the change from 
baseline to month 6 in patients treated with trihexyphenid yl reported b y Battini et al (2014) , 
assuming an effect size o f 55% for TEV -50717 versus placebo. The effect size of 55% was 
assumed based on the observed effect sizes of TEV -50717 in the pivotal studies in HD and TD. 
In the current study , these assumptions correspond to a mean difference of 2.0 in MD -CRS 
partII tot al score and an SD of 3.5 in each treatment group.
The rate of missing not at random (MNAR) data for the primary  anal ysis is expected to be 10%. 
MNAR data will be imputed in a conservative manner as if they  were obtained from patients in 
the placebo treatment group, regardless of the actual treatment group. As a result, the mean 
difference is expected to be reduced from 2.0 to 1.8 in the primary  anal ysis. The impact of the 
missing data imputation on the SD is negligible.
9.2. Analysis Sets
9.2.1. Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set
The intent -to-treat (ITT) anal ysis set will include all randomized patients.
In the ITT anal ysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment to which patients were 
randomized, regardless of which treatment they  actually  received.
For patients who discontinue the study  and re -enter it (repeating the stud y from baseline), onl y 
the data from the repeated participation will be included in the ITT anal ysis set.
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
1049.2.2. Modified Intent -to-Treat Analysis Set
The modified intent -to-treat (mITT) anal ysis set is a subset of the ITT anal ysis set including all 
randomized patients with at least 1 post -baseline centrally  read MD -CRS part II assessment .
In the m ITT analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment to which patients 
were random ized, regardless of which treatment they actuall y received.
9.2.3. Safety Analysis Set
The safet y analysis set will include all randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of IMP.
In the safet y analysis set, treatment will be assigned based on the treatment patients actuall y 
received, regardless of the treatment to which they were randomized, unless otherwise specified.
Rules for assignment of treatment in case of mixed actual treatments will be provided in the 
SAP.
Rules for handling safet y data for patients who discontinue the study  and re -enter it will be 
provided in the SAP.
9.2.4. Per-Protocol Analysis Set
The per -protocol (PP) analy sis set is a subset of the mITT anal ysis set including onl y patients 
who meet the following criteria:
compliant with study  medicati on (80% to 105%)
complete the study  without any  major protocol deviations that may  impact efficacy  
centrall y read baseline MD -CRS part II total score of ≥10
Rules for excluding patients from the PP analy sis set will be provided in the SAP. Evaluation of 
exclusion from the PP analy sis set will be discussed on a case -by-case basis and documented 
prior to database lock and unblinding of the stud y for final analysis .
9.3. Data Handling Conventions
9.3.1. Handling Withdrawals and Missing Data
For this study  design and population, it is unlikely  that patients who withdraw from IMP will be 
willing to attend the remaining scheduled stud y visits and, in particular, the week 15 visit. 
Therefore, patients will not be required to return to the clinic at week 15 for efficacy  evalua tions, 
and the primary  anal ysis will be based on a multiple imputation method for missing data.
For efficacy  analy sis, missing data will be classified as missing at random (MAR) and MNAR. 
The following cases will be considered as MNAR: 
early terminations related to tolerability
treatment -related adverse events
early terminations related to lack of efficacy  
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
105The following cases will be considered as MAR:
intermittent missing data
early termination for patients who are lost to follow -up 
early terminations due to COVID -19
For all other cases, and for cases classified as above, classification as MAR/MNAR will be 
done/revisited in a blinded manner on a case -by-case basis prior to the IA for futility and prior to 
database lock for final analy sis.
Multiple imputation methods will be used in the primary  and secondary  efficacy  anal yses. See 
Section 9.5for details.
9.4. Study Population
The ITT anal ysis set (Section 9.2) will be used for all study  population summaries, unless 
otherwise specified. Summaries will be presented by  treatment group and for al l patients.
9.4.1. Patient Disposition
Data from patients screened; patients screened but not randomized (and reason not randomized); 
patients who are randomized; patients randomized but not treated; patients re -randomized; 
patients in the I TT, mITT, safet y, and PP anal ysis sets; patients who complete the treatment 
period; patients who complete the EOS visit; and patients who withdraw from the study  will be 
summarized using descriptive statistics. Data from patients who withdraw from the study  will 
also be summari zed by  reason for withdrawal using descriptive statistics.
9.4.2. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics
Patient demographic and baseline characteristics, including medical and psychiatric history , prior 
medications and therapies, and ECG findings, will be examined to assess the comparability  of 
the treatment groups and will be summarized using descriptive statistics. For continuous 
variables, descriptive statistics will be provided. For categorical variables, patient counts and

9.5. Efficacy Analysis
9.5.1. Primary Estimand
The primary  estimand is the difference in means between TEV -50717 and placebo in the target 
patient population for the change from baseline to week 15 in centrall y read MD -
CRS part II 
total score, regardless of whether or not dose reduction, suspension, or discontinuation occurred, 
and regardless of treatment-related adverse events. 
The primary  estimand assesses the effectiveness in the reduction of choreiform movem ents in 
patients with DCP with predominant choreiform movement disorder, evaluated b y the central 
reviewers, focusing on the causal effects attributable to the I MP.
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
106The target patient population for this study  is patients with DCP with predominant choreiform 
movement disorder and severit y of DCP represented by the following:
a.total score of ≥10 in centrally  read MD-CRS part II items at baseline, and 
b.CGI-S ≥4 at baseline.
This population is expected to have the sensitivity  to demonstrate clinicall y meaningful 
improvement following treatment with TEV -50717.
Due to practical reasons, it is not possible to obtain a central reading of MD -CRS part II items at 
the time of the baseline visit prior to randomization; therefore, inclusion of the subject to the 
study  isbased on investigator scoring of MD -CRS part II items at baseline (Section 9.2.2).
9.5.2. Primary Endpoint
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is the change from baseline to week 15 in the MD -CRS part II 
total score (movement disorder severit y, centrally read) (TEV -50717 versus placebo).
9.5.2.1. Primary Efficacy Analysis
The primary  anal ysis will be a mixed -model, repeated -
measures with the change in MD- CRS 
part II total score as the dependent variable. The model will include fixed effects for treatment 
group, week (3 levels: weeks 9, 12, and 15), and treatment group by  week interaction. The 
baseline MD -CRS part II total score, age group at baseline (2 levels: 6 to < 12 years; 12 through 
18 years, inclusive), and region (US; non- US) will be included as covariates. The unstructured 
covariance model will be used.
Missing data will be classified as MAR and MNAR, as described in Section 9.3.1. The 
MAR/MNAR multiple imputation method will be applied in the primary  anal ysis, where MNAR 
data will be imputed using the jump -to-reference method, and MAR data will be impute d based 
on the randomized treatment group. The resulting complete, imputed datasets will each be 
analyzed using the anal ysis model described above, and the resulting statistics combined using 
methodology  presented by  Rubin (1987) and Little and Rubin (2002) .
The difference in least squares (LS) mean of the change in MD-
CRS part II total score from 
baseline to week 15 (TEV -50717 versus placebo) will be compared using a 1- sided test for 
superiority  at a nominal significance level of α=0.025. 
The L S mean and standard error for the treatment groups, the L S mean difference, 2- sided 95% 
confidence interval, and p- value for the comparison (TEV -50717 versus placebo) at week 15 will 
be presented.
9.5.2.2. Sensitivit y Analysis
To assess the robustness of the primary  efficacy  analy sis, sensitivity  anal yses will include the 
following:
Sensitivity  analy ses for assumptions of missing data mechanism:
tipping point (MNAR)
MAR multiple imputation 
Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
107Sensitivity  analy sis for th e statistical model:
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
primary  model, including only  the following covariates: treatment group, week, and 
treatment group b y week interaction
Other:
primary  model repeated for the ITT anal ysis set
primary  model repeated for the set of patients in the mITT anal ysis set that received 
at least 1 dose of IMP 
primary  model repeated for the PP analy sis set
ANCOVA models for MD -CRS part II total score change from baseline to week 9 
and to week 12
9.5.2.3. Minimal Clinically Important Difference and Minimal Clinically Important 
Change
To support the evaluation of the clinical impact of the change in dy skinesia as assessed by  the 
primary  endpoint, the minimal clinically  important difference (MCID) and the minimal clinically  
important cha nge (MCIC) will be calculated. The MCI D and MCI C anal yses will be performed 
based on 3 global impression of improvement anchors: caregiver (CaGI-I), investigator (CGI- I), 
and patient (PGI -I). 
The MCID and MCIC analy sis will be performed separately  for eac h anchor (CaGI -I, CGI -I, and 
PGI-I) yielding a set of thresholds, each reflecting the perspective of the caregiver, the clinician, 
or the patient, depending on the anchor used.
The MCID and MCIC analy ses will be based on the methods described by  Hauser et al 2014 and 
Hauser et al 2022. Details will be provided in the statistical analy sis plan.
9.5.3. Secondary Estimands
The secondary  estimands are the differences in means between TEV-50717 and placebo in the 
target patient population for (1) change from baseline to week 15 in centrally  read MD -CRS 
partI total score ,(2) CaGI -I at week 15, (3) CGI -I at week 15, (4) change from baseline to 
week 15 in centrall yread UHDRS -TMC, (5) change from baseline to wee k 15 in centrall yread 
UHDRS -TMD, regardless of whether or not dose reduction, suspension, or discontinuation 
occurred, and regardless of treatment- related adverse events.
The secondary  estimands assess the effectiveness on patients’ ability  to perform dai ly functions, 
the improvement in dy skinesia evaluated b y the caregiver and the investigator, and the reduction 
in chorea and d ystonia evaluated b y the central reviewers, all with a focus on the causal effects 
attributable to the IMP.

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 05 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
1109.7. Planned Interim Analysis
This is the first study  to evaluate the efficacy  of TEV -50717 to reduce the severit y of d yskinetic 
involuntary  movements associated with CP in pediatric patients with DCP. Moreover, limited 
data are available on the effect of active treatment on MD-
CRS part II total score in DCP that 
can support sample si ze calculations. Therefore, anIA for futility is planned.
When approximately  50 patients have completed the study  (including follow -up), an iDMC will 
perform an unblinded non -binding IA for futility  based on centrall y read MD -CRS part II total 
score. 
Therules for futility  recommendation (eg, definition of the promising zone) will be included in 
the iDMC charter and the SAP. The iDMC charter will also provide the wording that will be 
used to communicate the iDMC recommendation. The SAP will be finalized b efore the IA will 
be performed.
9.8. Safety Endpoints and Analysis

1. INTRODUCTION
There are currently no approved treatments for DCP, which 
is a serious disease with an unmet medical need. Current 
treatment options (off -label use) to treat dystonia and chorea 
include tetrabenazine, dopaminergic, or gamma -
aminobutyric acidergic intervent ions, but these show high 
variability in response (Monbaliu et al 2017). Botulinum 
neurotoxin A is also in clinical use for the treatment of 
spasticity and dystonia and is considered modestly effective 
in selected patients, but it does not meet the full treatment 
need. Naxibimols, a non smoked cannabis derivative, was 
approved to treat spasticity associated w ith multiple 
sclerosis in the United Kingdom in 2010 and is being 
investigated to treat spasticity in CP (ClinicalTrials.gov 
Identifier: [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Currently, there are very fe w 
agents with novel mechanisms of action in development for 
movement disorders in CP. Dalfampridine, a small molecule 
potassium channel blocker thought to restore conduction in 
central demyelinated axons, is approved for use in multiple 
sclerosis but has failed to demonstrate functional 
improvement in patients with CP (Bethoux et al 2017).There are currently no approved treatments for DCP, which 
is a serious disease with an unmet medical need. Current 
treatment options (off -label use) to treat dystonia and chorea 
include tetrabenazine, dopaminergic, or gamma -
aminobutyric acidergic interventions, but these show high 
variability in response (Monbaliu et al 2017). Botulinum 
neurotoxin A is also in clinical use for the treatment of 
spasticity and dystonia and is considered modestly effective 
in selected patients, but it does not meet the full treatment 
need. Currently, there are very few agents with novel 
mechanisms of action in development for movement 
disorders in CP. New  inform ation indicates 
Naxibimols and Dalfampridine 
will not be used for DCP and 
therefore not relevant to this 
protocol.

See new wording column The ECG types are defined as follows:

longer than 10 seconds. For a “summary ECG,” the 
minimal recommended duration is 2 minutes or longer, 
and th e preferred duration is 5 minutes (as it provides the 
most robust result). If a “summary ECG” is less than 2 
minutes, data will still be captured and analyzed to the 
extent possible.
The investigator should review the ECG at screening to 
determine patient eligibility for the study and subsequent 
ECGs for the patient’s continuation in the study. All 
ECGs should be review ed by  the investigator for any 
clinically significant findings during the visit and before 
the patient leaves the clinic. A qualified physi cian at a 
central diagnostic center will be interpreting the ECG.Clarification

See new wording column The criteria for an abnormal post -baseline QTcF are a value 
>500 msec or change from screening >60 m sec. If one of 
these criteria is met, the investigator must further evaluate 
the QTcF as follows: 
•If a standard ECG is abnormal and meets the above 
protocol criteria, 
oA 5-minute summary ECG recording should be 
performed at the research site, and a repeat standard 
ECG is not required. The site should follow the 
process to have these ECGs read by Spaulding. 
oIf a 5 -minute summary ECG cannot be performed 
(for instance, if patient is evaluated at a facility other 
than the research site, and the summ ary ECG is not 
available), the investigator should obtain 2 repeat 
standard ECGs and determine the average of these 3 
post-screening QTcF values. The site should follow  
the process to have these ECGs read by Spaulding.  
•The investigator should then comp are the post -screening 
QTcF values to the pre -treatment QTcF values at 
screening. As noted above, the post -screening QTcF 
values will use either the average QTcF from the 3 post-
screening standard ECGs or the QTcF from the summary 
ECG. The IMP must be stop ped for any confirmed post -
baseline QTcF average value >500 msec or average 
increase from screening >60 msec.Clarification

See new wording column Efficacy in this study will be evaluated using MD -CRS part 
I total score, MD- CRS part II total score, CaGI -I, CGI -I, 
CGI-S, PEDI- CAT, UHDRS -TMS, UHDRS -TMC, 
UHDRS -TMD, and PGI -I. It is recommended that the same 
order of administration/completion of the scales be kept per 
patient throughout the study, as best as possible (refer to the 
Study TV50717 -CNS- 30080 RECLAIM -DCP: Order of
scales administration/completion document). At all relevant 
visits where collected, PGI -I and CaGI -I are to be 
completed before all other investigator -rated scales.
The investigator should review all scales and questionnaires 
in a timely manner for any po tential reporting of adverse 
events and document this review accordingly. At each study 
visit, as applicable, the investigator should compare the 
current scores to the baseline scores.Stated the efficacy assessments

2.1.1. Justification of Prim ary Endpoint 
The MD -CRS has 2 parts: part I for general assessment 
of the functioning and impact of CP on the activities of 
the patient, and part II for a specific motor assessment 
of the severity of the movement disorder. The raw  score 
of part II (0 to 28) is normalized in a scale of 0 to 1 as 
Index II (MD CRS II). Similar normalization is done for 
the part I raw  score as Index I (0 to 1) and for the sum 
of the raw scores of parts I and II as the Global Index (0 
to 1).The MD -CRS h as 2 parts: part I for general assessment 
of the functioning and impact of CP on the activities of 
the patient, and part II for a specific motor assessment

7.2.2. Child Behavior Checklist (for Ages 6 -18) (Other sections affected by this change: Section 3.5, Table 3)
Not applicable. The CBCL assesses behavioral and emotional sta tus in 
children ages 6 through 18 years of age as reported by 
the parent/caregiver (Achenbach and Ruffle 2000; 
Achenbach 2005). The full CBCL has two parts, a 
Com petence Scale (Parts I to VII) and a Syndrome 
Scale (behavioral items).
The Competence Scale ( Parts I to VII) assesses various 
activities (eg, sports, hobbies, games, organizations, 
clubs, teams, groups, jobs, and chores), interpersonal 
relationships, and academic performance. 
The Syndrome Scale comprises 118 questions related to 
problem behaviors . This study w ill use a recall period of 
“now  or within the last week,” representing a 
modification from the original scale, which was “now  or Added section to include a description of

within the last 6 months”. For each item, the 
parent/caregiver will circle 0 if the item is not true of 
their chi ld, 1 if the item is somewhat or sometimes true, 
and 2 if the item is very true or often true. 
The CBCL is part of the Achenbach System of 
Empirically Based Assessment that identifies 
syndromes that are behavioral clusters that indicate 
certain types of b ehavioral, social, or emotional 
problems. The problem behaviors are scored on the 
following 8 empirically based syndromes: 
anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed, somatic 
complaints, social problems, thought problems, 
attention problems, rule -breaking behavior, and 
aggressive behavior. 
The Competence and Syndrome Scales are displayed on 
profiles in relation to gender and age -specific 
percentiles and T scores based on national normative 
samples.  
The full CBCL assessment (Competence and Syndrome 
Scales) will be completed at screening and at week 
15/ET. Only the CBCL Syndrome scale will be 
completed at baseline, weeks 3, 7, 9, 12, and 16/EOS.
7.2.3 .Extrapyramidal Sympto m Rating Scale
Not applicable. The ESRS was designed to assess 4 types of drug -
induced movement disorders: parkinsonism, akathisia, 
dystonia, and TD (Chouinard and Margolese 2005). In 
this study, parkinsonism and akathisia will be e valuated 
with subscales I (subjective questionnaire) and II 
(evaluation for parkinsonism/akathisia). The ESRS is 
administered at screening; baseline; and w eeks 3, 7, 9, 
12, 15/ET, and 16/EOS.
The subscale I of the ESRS questionnaire rates 
subjective parkin sonism/akathisia at periods other than 
the day of examinations during the last 7 days. It is 
scored on a 4 -point scale (0=Absent, 1=Mild, 
2=Moderate, or 3=Severe). The evaluation takes into Added section to include a description of

frequency and duration of the symptom during the day, 
2) the number of days the symptom was present during 
the last week, and 3) the subjective evaluation of the 
intensity of the symptom by the patient. 
The subscale II of the ESRS questionnaire for 
evaluation of parkin sonism and akathisia includes 17 
items with scores ranging from 0 -102 to assess the 
following: tremor (0 –48), gait and posture (0 –6), 
postural stability (0 6), rigidity (0 –24), expressive 
automatic movements (0 –6), bradykinesia (0 -6), and 
akathisia (0 –6).
7.2.4. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (for Children and Adolescents)
Not applicable. The ESS is a self -administered questionnaire composed 
of 8 questio ns that provide a measure of a patient’s 
general level of daytime sleepiness (Johns 1991). Johns 
(2015) proposed the ESS as the official modified 
version of the ESS for children and adolescents. In 
2017, Janssen et al published results of their validation 
analysis and concluded that the ESS developed for 
children and adolescents is a reliable and internally 
valid measure of daytime sleepiness in adolescents 12 to 
18 years of age, but further studies are needed to 
establish the internal validity of the quest ionnaire for 
children under 12 years and the external validity and 
accuracy of cut -off points for children and adolescents. 
The ESS is administered at screening; baseline; and 
weeks 3, 7, 9, 12, 15/ET, and 16/EOS. The ESS asks 
respondents to rate, on a 4 p oint Likert scale (0 –3), their 
usual chances of dozing off or falling asleep in different 
situations or activities that most people engage in as part 
of their daily lives. The total ESS score is the sum of 8 
item scores and can range between 0 and 24 w ith the 
higher the score indicating a higher level of daytime 
sleepiness. Most people can complete the ESS without 
assistance in 2 or 3 minutes.

229APPENDIX B. INDEPENDENT DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE
When approximately  50 patients have completed the study  (including follow -up), an independent 
Data Monitoring Committee (iDMC) will perform an unblinded non-binding interim analy sis 
(IA) for futility  based on centrall y read Movement Disorder -Childhood Rating Scale part II 
(MD -CRS part II) total score. Based on the results of the IA, the study  may  be stopped.
The iDMC sessions can be open or closed. During open sessions, representatives of the sponsor 
and the Steering Committee may  be present, and information is provided and discussed in a 
blinded fashion. During closed sessions, the only  participants are members of the iDMC and the 
designated unblinded stat istician (if approved to be present).
Details on how the iDMC chairperson will communicate with the sponsor in regard to issues 
resulting from the conduct and clinical aspects of the study  can be seen in the iDMC charter. The 
sponsor will work closely  with the committee to provide the necessary data for review.
The conduct and specific details regarding the iDMC sessions and requests to unblind any  
investigational medicinal product assignments are outlined in the iDMC charter.
Further details are given in t he Data Monitoring Plan and iDMC Statistical Analy sis Plan.

237APPENDIX D.QUALITY CONTROL AND QUALITY ASSURANCE
Protocol Amendments and Protocol Deviations
Protocol Amendments
No changes from the final approved (sign ed) protocol will be initiated without the prior written 
approval or favorable opinion of a written amendment by  the Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC)/institutional review board (I RB) and national and local competent authorities, as 
applicable , except whe n necessary  to address immediate safety  concerns to the patients or when 
the change involves onl y nonsubstantial logistics or administration. The principal investigator at 
each investigational center, the coordinating investigator (if applicable), and the sponsor will 
sign the protocol amendment.
Important Protocol Deviations
Any deviation from the protocol that affects, to a significant degree, (a) the safet y, ph ysical, or 
mental integrit y of the patients in the study  and/or (b) the scientific value of the study  will be 
considered an important protocol deviation . Important protocol deviations may include non -
adherence on the part of the patient, the investigator, or the sponsor to protocol -specific inclusion 
and exclusion criteria, primary  objective variabl e criteria, or Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
guidelines; noncompliance to IMP administration; and use of prohibited medications. All 
important protocol deviations will be reported to the responsible IEC/IRB, as required.
When an important protocol deviation is reported, the sponsor will determine whether to 
withdraw the patient from the study  or permit the patient to continue in the study, with 
documented approval from the medical expert. The decision will be based on ensuring the safety 
of the patient and p reserving the integrit y of the study.
Changes in the inclusion and exclusion criteria of the protocol are notprospectivel y granted b y 
the sponsor. If investigational center personnel learn that a patient who did not meet protocol 
inclusion and exclusion c riteria was entered in a study , they  must immediately  inform the 
sponsor of the important protocol deviation . If such patient has alread y completed the study  or 
has withdrawn earl y, no action will be taken, but the deviation will be recorded.
For coronavi rus disease 2019 (COVID -19) updates, refer to Appendix M.
Information to Study Personnel
The investigator is responsible for giving information about the study  to all personnel members 
involved in the study  or in any  element of patient management, both before starting the study  and 
during the course of the study  (eg, when new personnel become involved). The investigator must 
ensure that all stud y perso nnel are qualified b y education, experience, and training to perform 
their specific task. These study  personnel members must be listed on the investigational center 
authorization form, which includes a clear description of each personnel member’s 
responsibilities. This list must be updated throughout the study , as necessary .
The study  monitor is responsible for explaining the protocol to all study  personnel, including the 
investigator, and for ensuring they  comply  with the protocol.

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 0 5 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
238Study Monitoring
To ensure compliance with GCP guidelines, the study  monitor or representative is responsible 
for ensuring that patients have signed the informed consent form and that the study  is conducted 
according to applicable standard operating procedures, the protocol, and other written 
instructions and regulatory guidelines.
The study  monitor is the primary  association between the sponsor and the investigator. The main 
responsibilities of the study  monitor(s) are to visit the investigator before, during, and after the 
study to ensure adherence to the protocol, that all data are correctl y and completely  recorded and 
reported, and that informed consent is obtained and recorded for all patients before they  
participate in the stud y and when changes to the consent form are warran ted, in accordance with 
IEC/IRB approvals.
The study  monitor(s) will contact the investigator and visit the investigational center according 
to the monitoring plan. The study  monitor will be permitted to review and verify  the various 
records (CRFs and othe r pertinent source data records, including specific electronic source 
document relating to the study ) to verify  adherence to the protocol and to ensure the 
completeness, consistency, and accuracy  of the data being recorded.
As part of the supervision of study  progress, other sponsor personnel may , on request, 
accompan y the study  monitor on visits to the investigational center. The investigator and 
assisting personnel must agree to cooperate with the study  monitor to resolve any  problems, 
errors, or possible misunderstandings concerning the findings detected during the course of these 
monitoring visits or provided in follow- up written communication.
For COVID -19 updates, refer to Appendix M.
Audit and Inspection
The sponsor may  audit the investigational center to evaluate study  conduct and compliance with 
protocols, standard operating procedures, GCP guidelines, and applicable regulatory  
requirements. T he sponsor’s Global Clinical Quality  Assurance, independent of Global Specialty  
Development, is responsible for determining the need for (and timing of) an investigational 
center audit.
The investigator must accept that competent authorities and sponsor re presentatives may  conduct 
inspections and audits to verify  compliance with GCP guidelines.
For COVID -19 updates, refer to Appendix M.

239APPENDIX E.ETHICS
Informed Consent
The investigator, or a qualified person designated by  the investigator, should fully  inform the 
patient and parent(s)/legally  acceptable representative (as applicable) of all pertinent aspects of 
the study , including the written information approved by  the Independent Ethics Committee 
(IEC)/institutional review board (I RB). All written and oral information about the study  will be 
provided in a language as nontechnical a s practical to be understood by  the patient and 
parent(s)/legally  acceptable representative. The patient and parent(s)/legally  acceptable 
representative should be given ample time and opportunity  to inquire about details of the study  
and to decide whether or not to participate in the study . The above should be detailed in the 
source documents.
A personall y signed and dated Informed Consent Form (ICF) will be obtained from each 
parent(s)/legally  acceptable representative, and a signed and dated assent form w ill be obtained 
from each patient (if the patient is able/as applicable) before an y stud y-specific procedures or 
assessments are done and after the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential hazards are 
explained, according to IEC/I RB requirements. The forms will also be signed and dated b y the 
person who conducted the informed consent discussion. The investigator will keep the original 
informed consent and assent forms, and copies will be given to the patients (and each 
parent(s)/legally  acceptable representative). It will also be explained to the patients (and each 
parent(s)/legally  acceptable representative) that they are free to refuse participation in the study  
and free to withdraw from the study  at an y time without prejudice to future treatment . Patients 
who started the study as minors and reached the age of majorit y during the study should sign the 
adult I CF. 
For coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID -19) updates, refer to Appendix M.
Competent Authorities and IECs/IRBs
Before this study  starts, the protocol will be submitted to the national competent authority  and to 
the respective IEC/I RB for review. As required, the study  will not start at a g iven investigational 
center before the IEC/IRB and competent authority  (as applicable) for the investigational center 
give written approval or a favorable opinion.
Confidentiality Regarding Study Patients
The investigator must ensure that the privacy  of th e patients, including their identity  and all 
personal medical information, will be maintained at all times. I n case report files and other 
documents or image material submitted to the sponsor, patients will be identified not by  their 
names but by an identi fication number.
Personal medical information may  be reviewed for the purpose of patient safet y or for verify ing 
data in the source and the case report file. This review may  be conducted b y the study  monitor, 
properl y authorized persons on behalf of the sp onsor, Global Quality  Assurance, or competent 
authorities. Personal medical information will alway s be treated as confidential.

241APPENDIX F.BIRTH CONTROL METHODS AND PREGNANCY 
TESTING
Females of childbearing potential are defined as the following:
not surgically  (documented hy sterectomy , bilateral oophorectomy , or bilateral 
salpingectomy ) or congenitally  sterile
postmenarchal or ≥12 y ears of age
Females who are not of childbearing potential are defined as the following:
premenarchal or being in the period of a female’s life before the first menstrual period 
occurs 
Highly effective birth control methods:
Highl y effective birth control methods are methods that can achieve a failure rate of less than 1% 
per year when used consistently  and correctly  are considered. Such methods include the 
following:
Combined estrogen a nd progestogen hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, and 
transdermal) associated with inhibition of ovulation; these should be initiated at least 
1month (for IMPs potentially  teratogenic/genotoxic) before the first dose of IMP
Progestogen -only hormo nal contraception (oral, injectable, and implantable) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation; these should be 1 month (for IMPs potentially  
teratogenic/genotoxic) before the first dose of IMP
Intrauterine device and intrauterine hormone-releasing s ystem need to be in place at 
least 2 months before screening
Bilateral tubal occlusion
Vasectomized partner, provided that he is the sole sexual partner and has received 
medical assessment of the surgical process
Sexual abstinence is only considered a highl y effective method if defined as 
refraining from heterosexual intercourse in the defined period. The reliability of 
sexual abstinence needs to be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical study  
and the preferred and usual lifesty le of the patient.
Periodic abstinence (eg, calendar, ovulation, sy mptothermal, and post -ovulation 
methods), declaration of abstinence for the duration of a study , and withdrawal are 
not acceptable methods of contraception (according to Medicines and Healthcare 
Products Regulatory  Agency ).
Unacceptable birth control methods:
Periodic abstinence (calendar, s ymptothermal, and post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus 
interruptus), spermicides only , and lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable methods of 
contraception. Female condom and male condom should not be used together.

242APPENDIX G.LOST TO FOLLOW-UP
A patient will be considered lost to follow -up if he/she repeatedl y fails to return for scheduled 
visits and is unable to be contacted b y the investigational center.
The followin g actions must be taken if a patient fails to return to the investigational center for a 
required stud y visit:
The investigational center must attempt to contact the patient and reschedule the 
missed visit as soon as possible and counsel the patient and parent(s)/caregiver, as 
applicable, on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule and ascertain 
whether or not the patient wishes to and/or should continue in the study .
In cases in which the patient is deemed lost to follow- up, the investigat or or designee 
must make every  effort to regain contact with the patient (where possible, 3 telephone 
calls and, if necessary , a certified letter to the patient’s last known mailing address or 
local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be doc umented in the 
patient’s medical record.
Should the patient continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to have 
withdrawn from the study with a primary  reason of “lost to follow -up.”

246APPENDIX J.PRODUCT COMPLAINTS
Clinical Product Complaints
A clinical product complaint is defined as a problem or potential problem with the phy sical 
quality  or characteristics of clinical investigational medicinal product (IMP) supplies or clinical 
device supplies used in a clinical research stud y sponsored b y Teva. Examples of a product 
complaint include, but are not limited to, the follo wing:
suspected contamination
questionable stability  (eg, color change, flaking, crumbling, etc)
defective components
missing or extra units (eg, primary  container is received at the investigational center 
with more or less than the designated number of un its inside)
incorrect packaging or incorrect or missing labeling/labels
unexpected or unanticipated taste or odor or both
device not working correctly  or appears defective in some manner
Each investigational center will be responsible for reporting a possible clinical product complaint 
by completing the product complaint form provided by  Teva and emailing it to 
 within 48 hours of becoming aware of the issue.
For complaints involving a device or other retrievable item, it is required that the device (or 
item) be sent back to the sponsor for investigative testing whenever possible. For complaints 
involving an IMP, all relevant samples (eg, the remainder of the patient’s IMP supply ) should be 
sent back to the sponso r for investigative testing whenever possible.
1.Product Complaint Information Needed from the Investigational Center
In the event that the product complaint form cannot be completed, the investigator will provide 
the following information, as available:
investigational center number and principal investigator name
name, phone number, and address of the source of the complaint
clinical protocol number
patient identifier (patient study  number) and corresponding visit numbers, if 
applicable
product name and str ength for open -label studies
patient number, bottle, and kit numbers (if applicable) for double -blind or open -label 
studies
product available for return Yes/No
product was taken or used according to the protocol Yes/No

Placebo- Controlled Study –Dyskinesia in Cerebral Palsy
Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 0 5 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
247description or nature of complaint
associated serious adverse event Yes/No
clinical supplies unblinded (for blinded studies) Yes/No
date and name of person receiving the complaint
Note: Reporting a product complaint must not be delay ed even if not all the required information 
can be obtained immediately . Known information must be reported immediately . The sponsor 
will collaborate with the investigator to obtain an y outstanding information.
2.Handling of Investigational Medicinal Product(s) at the Investigational Center(s)
The investigator is responsible for retaining the product in question in a location separate from 
the investigator’s clinical study  supplies. The sponsor may  request that the investigator return the 
product for further evaluation and/or anal ysis. If this is necessary , the clinic al study  monitor or 
designee will provide the information needed for returning the IMP.
If it is determined that the investigational center must return all I MP, the sponsor will provide the 
information needed to handle the return.
The integrity  of the rand omization code and corresponding blinded clinical supplies will be 
maintained whenever possible. A serious adverse event or the potential for a product quality  
problem existing bey ond the scope of the complaint may  be a reason to unblind the clinical 
suppl ies for an affected patient.
3.Adverse Events or Serious Adverse Events Associated with a Product Complaint
If there is an adverse event or a serious adverse event due to product complaint, the protocol 
should be followed for recording and reporting (Section 7.1.2).
4.Documenting a Product Complaint
The investigator will record in the source documentation a description of the product complaint 
and an y act ions taken to resolve the complaint and to preserve the safety  of the patient. Once the 
complaint has been investigated b y the sponsor and the investigator, if necessary , an event 
closure letter may  be sent to the investigational center where the complaint originated or to all 
investigational centers using the product.
Medical device incidents, including those resulting from malfunctions of the device, must be 
detected, documented, and reported b y the investigator throughout the study.

248APPENDIX K.DATA MANAGEMENT AND RECORD KEEPING
Direct Access to Source Data and Documents
All patient data must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or 
equivalent, before they  are transcribed to the case report form (CRF). Data may  not be recorded 
directl y on the CRF and considered as source data, unless the sponsor provides written 
instructions specify ing which data are permitted to be recorded directl y to the CRF.
If data are processed from other institutions or by  other means (eg, clinical laboratory , central 
image center, or electronic diary  data), the results (with the exception of the cy tochrome 
P450 2D6 [CYP2D6] test results) will be sent to the investigational center, where they will be 
retained but not transcribed to the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the protocol (eg, results of 
centrall y read MD- CRS part II items will not be shared with the investigators). These data may  
also be sent electronically to the sponsor (or organization performing data management).
The medical experts, study  monitors, auditors, Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/institutional 
review board (IRB), and inspectors from competent authority  (or their agents) will be given 
direct access to source data and documents (eg, medical charts/records, laboratory  test results, 
printouts, and videos) for source data verification, provided that patient confidentiality  is 
maintained in accordance with national and local requirements.
The investigator must maintain the original records (ie, source documents) of each patient’s dat a 
at all time s.The investigator must maintain a confidential patient identification list that allows 
the unambiguous identification of each patient.
Data Collection
Data will be collected using CRFs that are specifically  designed for this study . The data collected 
on the CRFs will be captured in a clinical data management s ystem (CDMS) that meets the 
technical requirements described in 21CFR Part11 (United States) and documents of other 
concerned competent authorities. Before using the CDMS, it will be fully  validated , and all users 
will receive training on the sy stem and study -specific training. After they  are trained, users will 
be provided with individual sy stem access rights.
Data will be collected at the investigational center by  appropriatel y designated and train ed 
personnel, and CRFs must be completed for each patient who provided informed consent. Patient 
identity  should not be discernible from the data provided on the CRF.
If data are processed from other sources (eg, central laboratory, bioanal ytical laborator y, central 
image center, electronic diary  data, and electronic patient -reported outcome tablet or phone ), 
these data will be sent to the investigational center, where they  will be retained but not 
transcribed to the CRF, unless otherwise noted in the proto col. These data may  also be sent 
electronically  to the sponsor (or organization performing data management). All patient data 
must have supportive original source documentation in the medical records, or equivalent, before 
they are transcribed to the CRF. Data may  not be recorded directly  on the CRF and considered as 
source data unless the sponsor provides written instructions specify ing which data are permitted 
to be recorded directly  to the CRF.

249For patients who enter a study  but do not meet the eligibili ty criteria, at a minimum, data for 
screening failure reason, demograph y, and an y serious adverse events from the time of informed 
consent will be entered in the CRF.
Data Quality C ontrol
Data Management is responsible for the accuracy , quality , completeness, and internal 
consistency  of the data from this study . Oversight will be carried out as described in the 
sponsor’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) for clinical studies. Day -to-day data 
management tasks for this study  are delegated to a co ntract organization, and these functions 
may be carried out as described in the SOPs for clinical studies at that organization. These SOPs 
will be reviewed b y the sponsor before the start of data management activities.
Data will be verified b y the study  monitor using the data source and reviewed by  Data 
Management using both automated logical checks and manual review. Data identified as 
erroneous, or data that are missing, will be referred to the investigational center for resolution 
through data queries. A ny necessary  changes will be made in the clinical database, and data 
review and validation procedures will be repeated as needed. Data from external sources will be 
compared with the information available in the CDMS, and an y discrepancies will be queried.
Applicable terms will be coded according to the coding conventions for this study .
At the conclusion of the study , the CDMS and all other study  data will be locked to further 
additions or corrections. Locking the stud y data represents the acknowledgment t hat all data have 
been captured and confirmed as accurate. All data collected will be approved by  the investigator 
at the investigational center. This approval acknowledges the investigator’s review and 
acceptance of the data as being complete and accurate .
Archiving of Case Report Forms and Source Documents
Sponsor Responsibilities
The original CRFs will be archived by the sponsor. I nvestigational center -specific CRFs will be 
provided to the respective investigational centers for archiving.
Investigator Re sponsibilities
The investigator must maintain all written and electronic records, accounts, not es, reports, and 
data related to the study  and any  additional records required to be maintained under country , 
state/province, or national and local laws, includ ing, but not limited to, the following :

The investigator will retain all records related to the study  and any  additional records required, as 
indicated b y the protocol and according to applicable laws and regulations, until the contract 
research organization or sponsor notifies the institution in writing that records may be destro yed. 
If, after 25 years from study  completion, or earlier in the case of the investigational center 
closing or going out of business, the investigator reasonabl y determines that study  record 
retention has become unduly  burdensome and sponsor has not provided written notification of 
destruction, then the investigator may  submit a written request to the sponsor at least 60 days 
before an y planned disposition of study  records. After receipt of such request, the sponsor may  
make arrangements for appropri ate archival or disposition, including requiring that the 
investigator deliver such records to the sponsor. The investigator shall notify the sponsor of an y 
accidental loss or destruction of study  records.

252APPENDIX M.MANAGEM ENT OF STUDY ACTIVITIES DURING 
COVID -19
This appendix is to address the modification in study  conduct during the coronavirus disease 
2019 (COVID -19) pandemic. 
The changes specified in this appendix will be effective for the duration of the COVID-19 
pandemic . Once the situation at specific sites/countries will allow returning to regular study  
activities, this appendix will be come void for those country /sites, except in the case of 
COVID -19 resurgence or emergence of another crisis aff ecting normal per- protocol conduct of 
the study .
The following sections are affected:  
Section 3.1. General Study Design and Study Schematic Diagram
A COVID- 19 addendum informed consent will be created to inform patients of the planned 
changes. The site w ill be allowed to conduct remote assent and consent b y phone. Site will 
obtain and document a verbal confirmation from patient and parent/ legally acceptable 
representative that they  received this information and understood it. The informed consent 
addendum will be signed by  the patient and family  as applicable at the first next in -clinic visit. 
Any updates prior to the updated consent form should be consented verbally  and documented in 
the medical sources.  
Section 3.5. Schedule of Study Procedures and Ass essments
In the event of an emergency  situation (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), in case a patient cannot 
return to the clinic for the scheduled visits (eg, due to quarantine, isolation, patient’s concern, or 
closure of the site clinic), home or remote visits are permitted for patients who are not able to go 
to the investigational site for their visit(s) or if the investigational site staff are not able to see 
patients at the investigational site.
Remote visits will allow collecting the following clinician -rated scales: 
Columbia -Suicide Severity  Rating Scale (C -SSRS)
Clinical Global I mpression of I mprovement (CGI -I)
Clinical Global I mpression of Severit y (CGI -S)
Part I  of the Extrapy ramidal Sy mptom Rating Scale (subscales I and II) [ESRS]. 
It will further allow a visual confirmation of a patient’s condition using non -recording live video 
and assessment of an y new adverse events, as possible, depending on patient cooperation and the 
communication platform being in good working order. The remo te visit will not allow for fully  
completing performance outcome assessments that require ph ysical examinations, including 
those required for the Movement Disorder -Childhood Rating Scale (MD -CRS), Unified 
Huntington’s Disease Rating Scale (UHDRS), or ESRS scales. The MD -CRS Part I  & II are 
optional at the investigator’s discretion and may  be incomplete considering patient’s imbalance 
when standing and walking and prioritizing patient safet y. UHDRS -Total Motor Score (TMS) 
and ESRS should be completed as much as possible; some fields (ie, rigidity , stability ) may  be

Clinical Study  Protocol Amendment 0 5 Study  TV50717- CNS -30080
253left blank as they  cannot be assessed remotel y. The pull test should not be done due to safety 
considerations. The remote visit will not allow for measuring vital signs or obtaining an 
electrocardi ogram (ECG) or urine beta chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) test, unless a home 
nursing vendor is at the patient’s home to provide that service where available.
The week 3 and week 7 visits can be completed as remote visits if safet y assessments 
(specifically vital signs, ECG, C -SSRS, and β -HCG test, if relevant) can be performed within a 
reasonable time from visit (approximately  2 weeks). 
The week 9 and week 12 visits can be completed as remote visits if the previous vital signs and 
ECGs were acceptable as p er protocol requirements. Any  other required safety  assessments (eg, 
C-SSRS and β-HCG test, if relevant) that are not completed during a remote visit should be 
completed within 2 weeks of the remote visit. 
If patient misses the week 15 visit and is approv ed by  the medical monitor to have a remote visit 
and continue on drug, and if patient cannot arrive at site within 3 weeks, a telephone call will be 
added to assess patient’s condition (ie, adverse event, tolerability , sufficient investigational 
medicinal product [I MP]).
The week 16 visit can be completed as a remote visit.
The test and placebo IMP (as applicable) will continue to be administered at home. Following 
the consent of the patient or parent(s)/legall y acceptable representative, IMP will be shippe d to 
patients if they  or their parent/legall y acceptable representative cannot visit the site to collect 
IMP. All shipping arrangements will be the site’s responsibility  and will occur between site and 
patient or as a direct- to-patient shipment from the site to patient coordinated by  the sponsor’s 
third party  shipping vendor, where available, and according to local practices and regulations.
Modifications to other procedures and assessments (ECG, laboratory  sample collection, etc) will 
be performed per implemented contingency measures according to sponsor instructions and the 
corresponding manual. For example, if central lab samples cannot be collected for safet y 
assessments, sites may  have patients visit a local reference laboratory , or a home service may  
visit home, to perform the assessments.
These measures will be implemented on a case- by-case basis, and onl y when and where they are 
warranted due to the emergency  situation. Preferably , the original protocol instructions will be 
followed whenever the new i nstructions are not required.
Section 4.3. Withdrawal Criteria and Procedures for the Patient
Patients who cannot complete the required safet y assessments within a reasonable time from visit 
(approximately  2 weeks for the week 3 and week 7 visits) will be early  terminated from study ; 
specificall y, these are the vital signs, ECG, C-SSRS, and β-HCG tests at weeks 3 and7.
Patients who cannot reach the site for a week 15 visit will be allowed to remain on drug for an 
additional 4 weeks. After 3 weeks, if the p atient has not y et completed the in -clinic week 
15visit, the investigator will perform another remote visit to check on the patient’s condition. 
The contract research organization (CRO) will assess with the site if their patient can come to 
complete the w eek 15 visit in the next week. I f not, the sponsor will either allow another 
extension or the patient will be earl y terminated from the study.

254Section 4.5. Rescreening
Patients who screen fail or terminate earl y from the study due to emergency circumstance s (such 
as coronavirus disease 2019 [COVI D-19] restrictions) may  be allowed to re -screen/re -enter 
(respectively ) the study  at a later date, depending on the circumstances. Each case should be 
referred to the medical monitor and approved in advance. Patient s re-entering the study  will be 
manually  assigned to their initial treatment group. Patients will have to redo the entire study  from 
the start, aside from the blinded CYP2D6 genot yping; these results will carried over from the 
first participation. 
Section 5.9. Randomization and Blinding
Patients re- entering the study  will be manually  assigned to their initial treatment group b y the 
RTSM unblinded vendor. Blinding will be maintained for the patient, investigator, and sponsor 
as described above; the only  information that will be available is that the patient was assigned to 
the same treatment group as previousl y. 
Section 6. Assessments of Efficacy
In the event of an emergency  situation (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), in case a patient cannot 
return to the clinic for the scheduled visits (eg, due to quarantine, isolation, patient’s concern, or 
closure of the site clinic), patients will be able to complete the efficacy  scales at home using the 
iPhone. The results of the questionnaires completed via patient’s iPhon e will be transferred to the 
case report form (CRF) per the usual process. Scales collected as paper forms will be stored in 
patient source file and entered to CRF manuall y once the CRF has been adapted appropriatel y.
Section 7. Assessment of Safety
In the event of an emergency situation (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), in case a patient cannot 
return to the clinic for the scheduled visits (eg, due to quarantine, isolation, patient’s concern, or 
closure of the site clinic), patients will be allowed to obtain vi tal signs and ECGs using local 
clinics (primary  health care provider) or home nursing service, where available. 
Safety  measurements such as vital signs/ECG/β -HCG/C -SSRS are mandatory  for weeks 3 and 7 
(during titration) and part of the week 15/16 assessme nts.
To increase safety  assessments, and in anticipation that patients may  need to significantl y dela y 
their week 15 visit, investigators may  collect several safet y assessments at week 12 that are 
currentl y not part of the schedule of activities, but are p ossible using ‘unscheduled’ visits: 
physical examination, neurological examination, 12 -lead ECG, and 
chemistry /hematology /urinaly sis laboratory  tests. These safet y measurements are at the 
investigator’s discretion.
Section 7.5.2.1. Beta -Human Chorionic Gonadotropin Tests
If an in -clinic visit is replaced by  a remote visit, all efforts will be done to collect the β -HCG (eg, 
at local laboratory  or by  sending urine β -HCG sticks to the patient and parent/legally  acceptable 
representative, so these can be assessed at home). 
Section 7.5.2.2. Urine Drug Screen
If an in -clinic visit is replaced by  a remote visit, urine drug screen samples will not be collected, 
until a next in -clinic visit is possible.

Depending on the impact of COVID -19 on the study  assessments, additional anal yses or 
modifications of planned anal yses will be considered and detailed in a possible amendment to the 
statistical analy sis plan.
Section 10. Quality Control and Quality Assurance
Deviations from the study  conduct due to emergency  situations (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), 
including implemented contingency  measures and their impact (eg, patient discontinuation from 
treatment with investigational product and/or study, alternative procedures used to collect critical 
safety and/or efficacy  data, etc), will be described in the appropriate sections of the clinical study  
report (CSR) as applicable.

Protocol Deviations
Deviations from the study  conduct due to emergency  situatio ns (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), 
including implemented contingency  measures and their impact (eg, patient discontinuation from 
treatment with investigational product and/or study, alternative procedures used to collect critical 
safet y and/or efficacy data, etc), will be described in the appropriate sections of the CSR as 
applicable.
Study Monitoring
In case of an emergency  situation (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), where study  monitors may  not 
be able to access the investigational centers for on -site visits, sit es will be monitored remotel y 
where allowed and in accordance with the local regulations. Additional details are provided in 
the monitoring plan.
Audit and Inspection
In case of an emergency  situation (eg, the COVID -19 pandemic), where auditors may  not be able 
to access the investigational centers for on -site visits, investigational centers will be audited 
remotely  where allowed and in accordance with local regulations.
Appendix E. Ethics
A COVID- 19 addendum informed consent will be created to inform patients of the planned 
changes. The site will be allowed to conduct remote assent and consent b y phone. Site will 
obtain and document a verbal confirmation from patient and parent/ legally acceptable 
representative that they  received this information and underst ood it. The informed consent 
addendum will be signed by the patient and family  as applicable at the first next in -clinic visit. 
Any updates prior to the updated consent form should be consented verbally  and documented in 
the medical sources. 
Appendix H. L ist of Allowed and Prohibited Medications
Hydroxy chloroquine is contraindicated in this trial due to the risk of QT prolongation and should 
be considered as not allowed. If there is a medical decision to initiate chloroquine, 
hydroxychloroquine, mefloquine , or other drugs related to chloroquine, the IMP should be 
suspended or discontinued and an ECG should be obtained. The medical monitor should be 
consulted for further advice.

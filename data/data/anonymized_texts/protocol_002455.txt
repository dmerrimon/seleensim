CONFIDENTIAL  4 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
 Methodology:  
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, active controlled , 3-arm study in approximately 
120 subjects undergoing lower extremity surgeries. The study will have 2  cohorts. Both cohorts will enroll in 
parallel.  
 
Cohort 1 will enroll about 60 subjects undergoing bunionectomy to obtain information on PK profile, 
pharmacody namics (PD), efficacy, and safety. Subjects in this cohort will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive 
combined sciatic (in the popliteal fossa) and saphenous (in the adductor canal) nerve blocks with EXPAREL, 
EXPAREL admixed with 0.25% bupivacaine HCl, or 0.25%  bupivacaine HCl. Only select sites will enroll 
subjects for Cohort 1.  
 
Cohort 2 will enroll about 60 subjects to obtain information on efficacy and safety. Subjects in this cohort 
will receive combined sciatic (in the popliteal fossa) and saphenous (in th e adductor canal) nerve blocks. 
Subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive EXPAREL, EXPAREL admixed with 0.25% bupivacaine HCl, 
or 0.25% bupivacaine HCl, and will be stratified  by each surgery grouping.  
  
Subjects in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will be disch arged after the completion of the 168 h and 96 h assessments, 
respectively.  
 An adaptive study design will be used in this study. For efficacy, an interim analysis will occur when a total 
of approximately 60  subjects combined from either Cohort 1 or C ohort 2 have enrolled and provided complete 
assessment data for their primary efficacy outcome.  
 
Obtaining Informed Consent 
Potential subjects undergoing one of the eligible surgeries will be approached by the investigator and/or the 
study staff for informed c onsent up to 30 days before the surgery. Subject may be consented on the day of the 
surgery, if the consent process is started early with ample time for the subject to review the informed consent form (ICF)  
and have all the questions answered by the investigator/study staff prior to providing informed 
consent .  
 
Screening  
Subjects may be screened up to 30 days prior to day of surgery but eligibility should be re -confirmed on day 
of surgery . Screening procedures that are standard of care at the institution may be completed prior to written 
informed consent and documented within the 30 -day time window. Any screening procedures that are not 
standard of care, must be completed after written informed consent is pr ovided and prior to surgery.  
 
The following screening procedures should be performed after the ICF is signed: explain study purpose and 
procedures, assess eligibility, record medical/surgical history, record prior and concomitant medications, 
record demographics and baseline characteristics including Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), record subject height and weight for body mass index ( BMI ) calculation, assess chronic opioid use in the past 30 days, 
conduct urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential, record adverse events  (AEs)/serious 
adverse events ( SAEs ) starting when the ICF is signed and record concomitant medications for treatment of 
AEs.   
 
Day of S urgery  
On the day of surgery, before administration of the block, the subject must record responses to the following 
pain assessments:  
• Pain intensity scores on the numeric rating scale (NRS) as “What was your worst pain in the last 
30 days?”  
• Pain intensity scores ( using the NRS) “What was your average pain in the last 30 days?”  
In addition, the following procedures will be conducted: conduct urine pregnancy test for women of 
childbearing potential , record changes to concomitant medications since screening , confirm eligibility and

randomize subject , record AEs/ SAEs and any treatment(s) for the events , and provide e -diary and instruct 
the subjects on duties and responsibilities for assessment completion . For Cohort 1 only , the following 
procedures are conducted: p erform sensory function assessment,  perform  motor function assessment  and 
obtain PK samples . 
Cohort 1: PK, PD, Efficacy, and Safety  
The participants enrolled in Cohort 1 will provide blood samples  for PK and measures for efficacy and safety . 
About 60 subjects undergoing bunionectomy will be enrolled in this cohort. On the day of surgery, eligible 
subjects will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive EXPAREL (n=20), EXPAREL admixed with  
0.25%  bupivacaine HCl (n=20), or bupivacaine HCl (n=20) as a combined sciatic (in the popliteal fossa) and 
saphenous (in the adductor canal) nerve blocks.  
Cohort 2: Effica cy and Safety  
The participants enrolled in Cohort 2 will provide measures for efficacy and safety . About  60 subjects will 
be enrolled in this cohort. On day of surgery, eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 to receive EXPAREL 
(n=20), EXPAREL admixed with 0.25% bupivacaine HCl (n=20), or bupivacaine HCl (n=20). All subjects 
will receive combined sciatic ( in the popliteal fossa) and saphenous (in the adductor canal) nerve blocks, by 
stratifying by each surgery grouping.  
Treatments for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2  
On the day of surgery, Cohort 1 and 2 subjects will receive ultrasound- guided combined sciatic (in pop liteal 
fossa) and adductor canal nerve block with one of the following treatments:  
• EXPAREL arm:  subjects randomized to this treatment arm will receive 20 mL (266 mg) 
EXPAREL mixed with 20 mL saline  
• EXPAREL admix arm:  subjects randomized to this treatment arm will receive 20 mL (266  mg) 
EXPAREL admixed with 20 mL (50 mg) 0.25% bupivacaine HCl  
• Bupivacaine HCl arm :  subjects randomized to this treatment arm will receive 40 mL (100 mg) 
0.25% bupivacaine HC l 
Block procedure:   
Subjects may be lightly sedated with 1  to 2 mg of midazolam intravenously ( IV) before the block procedure. 
The study drug (EXPAREL, EXPAREL admixed with 0.25%  bupivacaine HCl , or bupivacaine HCl) will be 
administered under ultrasound guidance 90 min (±30 min) prior to  surgery.  
For all arms, the total volume (40 mL) will be split such that 20  mL will be administered as the sciatic nerve 
block (in popliteal fossa) and 20 mL will be administered as the saphenous nerve block (in the adductor canal) .

Study Schema:   
 
Note: Cohort 1 will enroll bunionectomy subjects only.  
Breakthrough Pain Medication : 
All opioid and other analgesics (pain medications) administered post- surgery through Post-operative Day 
(POD ) 14 should be recorded.  
Medications will be provided on a n as needed ( PRN)  basis in relation to the breakthrough pain intensity. The 
intent is to use the guide below  in a step -wise approach; acetaminophen or nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory 
drugs ( NSAIDs ) should be used for the initial treatment of post- surgical pain and escalation to opioids (and 
subsequent increased dose of opioids) should be implemented if the initial pain treatment (and initial opioid 
dose) is insufficient for pain relief . Opioids shou ld not be the first choice for pain relief  unless clinically 
indicated in the opinion of the investigator and should not be given on a schedule . 
• For the initial treatment of post- surgical pain, subjects may receive either acetaminophen or 
NSAIDs without exceeding the maximum daily dose.

• If the initial pain treatment (acetaminophen or NSAIDs) is insufficient for pain relief , immediate 
release oral ( PO) oxycodone may be administered in a st epwise approach:  
− Initial dos e of 5 mg oxycodone may be offered ;  
− If the initial opioid dose is insufficient for pain relief , 10 mg oxycodone may  be offered . 
• If a subject is unable to tolerate PO medication or the PO oxycodone pain relief is insufficient, 
IV morphine (initiated at 2 mg) or hydromorphone (initiated at 0.2 mg) may be administered.  
 
Post discharge, the subject may be provided with a prescription for oxycodone 5 mg. The subject may take 
acetaminophen, NSAIDs, or the prescribed oxycodone and will be given instructions on which medication to 
take PRN based on their pain intensity.  
Post-surgical  Assessments : 
The post-surgical assessments are as follows: r ecord pain intensity scores (NRS) (see Appendix 1, 
Section  18.1) measured as “How much pain are you experiencing right now?” from the end of surgery t o 96 
hours post -surgery a t the designated timepoin ts. Additional  assessments include: r ecord pain intensity scores 
(NRS) measured as “What was your worst pain in the last 24 hours?” and “What was your average pain in 
the last 24 hours?” and subject to reco rd satisfaction with pain management questionnaire. For C ohort 1 only , 
assessments  include: collect scheduled PK blood samples, p erform sensory and motor function assessments , 
record AEs/ SAEs  and r ecord concomitant medications .  
To mitigate the risk from falls, subjects will be required to be non -weight bearing for  at least 2 weeks post -
surgery , unless the investigator determines a limited touch down or partial weight bearing for balance with a 
walker assist device is more appropriate to reduce the risk of fall.  
 
Health Care  Facility Discharge:  
Subjects in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 will be discharged after the completion of the 168 h and 96 h assessments, 
respectively.  Record date and time of health care facility discharge. Re- instruct on duties and respon sibilities 
with the e -diary and for breakthrough medications.  
Number of Subjects (Planned) : Approximately 120 adult subjects undergoing lower extremity surgeries 
will be enrolled for the study. The surgeries that can be included in the study are: b unionectomy, 
1st metatarsophalangeal fusion , specific forefoot surgeries (Weil osteotomy, Clayton -Hoffman procedures 
only) , midfoot fusion , hindfoot fusion , and t otal ankle arthroplasty .  
Eligibility Criteria:  
At screening, the subject should satisfy the following inclusion and exclusion criteria:  
 
Inclusion Criteria:   
1. Healthy adult male or female volunteers ages 18 or older  
2. American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status 1, 2, or 3  (see Appendix 6,

Duration of Subject Participation in Study : 
Participation will begin upon signing of the ICF. No more than 30 days should pass between signing the ICF 
and study drug administration. Study drug administration will be on the same day of surgery. A follow -up 
phone call will occur on POD  14 (±3 days). Therefore, each subject may participate in the study for up to a 
maximum of 47 days.  
Efficacy Assessments:  
• Pain intensity measured using the NRS as “How much pain are you experiencing right now?” will 
be assessed:  
o Upon arrival in the Post -anesthesia Care Unit (PACU)  (±5 min)  
o Every 15 minutes in the PACU  (±5 min)  
o At PACU discharge  (±5 min)  
o Every 6 hours from the end of surgery until 96 hours post -surgery: 6 h (±2 h), 12 h (±2 h), 
18 h (±2 h), 24 h (±2 h), 30 h (±2 h), 36 h (±2 h), 42 h (±2 h), 48 h (±2 h), 54 h (±2 h), 60 h 
(±2 h), 66 h (±2 h), 72 h (±2 h), 78 h (±3 h), 84 h (±3 h), 90 h (±3 h), and 96 h (±3 h)  
o An unscheduled NRS assessment will be obtained immediately prior to administration of 
any breakthrough pain medication until 96 hours post -surgery  
• Pain intensity using the NRS once daily at 21:00 (±3 h) from POD  1 to POD  14 measured as “What 
was your worst pain in the last 24 hours?”  
• Pain intensity using the NRS once daily at 21:00 (±3 h) from POD  1 to POD  14 measured as “What 
was your average pain in the last 24 hours?”  
Subjects will be instructed to focus all NRS pain intensity ratings on the operative ankle/foot, and not other 
locations where they may be experiencing pain.  
In addition, subject satisfaction with pain management using 1 question from the International Pai n Outcome 
(IPO) questionnaire will be recorded at 96 hours (±3 h) post -surgery.  
Efficacy endpoints: 
Primary Endpoint:  
• The area under the curve (AUC) of the NRS pain intensity scores from 0 to 96  hours post -surgery 
comparing EXPAREL to 0.25% bupivacaine HCl  
Secondary Endpoint s:  
• Total postsurgical opioid consumption in oral morphine equivalents (OMED) from 0 to 96 hours 
post-surgery comparing EXPAREL to 0.25% bupivacaine HCl  
• Time to first opioid co nsumption comparing EXPAREL to 0.25% bupivacaine HCl  
• The AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from 0 to 96 hours post -surgery comparing EXPAREL to 
EXPAREL admixed with 0.25% bupivacaine HC l 
• The duration of the motor block EXPAREL to EXPAREL admixed with 0.25% bupivacaine HC l 
Safety Assessments:

Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Assessments  (Cohort 1 bunionectomy subjects only) :  
Blood samples for PK assessment and the sensory/motor function assessments will be assessed at scheduled 
timepoints in C ohort 1 subjects only ( See Table 2). 
Pharmacokinetic Endpoint:  
The following model -predicted PK endpoints will be determined:  
• Area under the plasma concentration- versus -time curve (AUC)  
• Maximum plasma concentration (C max) and time of C max (Tmax) 
• The apparent terminal elimination half -life (t 1/2el) 
• Apparent clearance (CL/F)  
• Apparent volume of distribution (Vd)  
Pharmacodynamic Endpoint:  
The following pharmacodynamics endpoints will be determined:  
• Median time to onset of sensory block and motor block  
• Median duration of sensory block and motor block   
Statistical Methods:   
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized for this study prior to database lock. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized descriptively by treatment group for all subjects 
who receive study drug. Efficacy and safety endpoint analyses will be described in the SAP.  
 
Efficacy data will be analyzed by randomized treatment group . Superiority of treatment with EXPAREL 
compared wit h bupivacaine HCl will be determined using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with treatment as 
main effect for the primary efficacy endpoint of AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from 0 to 96 hours 
post-surgery. Additional factors such as site or surgery type  may be included to adjust the model if deemed 
necessary . Other efficacy endpoints will be analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression model, chi- square 
tests, and Kaplan -Meier and log -rank tests, as appropriate.  
 
Safety and pharmacokinetic endpoints will b e summarized descriptively by actual treatment received  
 
Determination of Sample Size:   
The sample size was calculated based on the primary efficacy endpoint of the AUC of the NRS pain intensity 
scores from 0 through 96 hours post -surgery  comparing EXPAREL to bupivacaine HCl .  
 
The sample size for Cohort 1 was based on the number of subjects necessary to characterize the PK following 
administration.  
 
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 subjects will be combined within treatment groups for the efficacy an d safety analyses; 
therefore, the overall sample size was based on the primary efficacy endpoint of the AUC of the NRS pain 
intensity scores from 0 through 96 hours post -surgery . Assuming a 2 -sided 0.05 alpha, common standard 
deviation (SD) of 170 a sample  size of 40 subjects for EXPAREL and 40 subjects for bupivacaine HCl should

Name of Active Ingredients:  
Bupivacaine, 1.3%, 13.3 mg/mL    
have at least 90% power to detect a true difference of 150 -units in the AUCs . Therefore, since Cohort 1 will 
have 60 subjects (20 EXAPREL, 20 EXPAREL admixed with bupivacaine HCl a nd 20 bupivacaine HCl), 
Cohort 2 will need to enroll 60 subjects (20 EXAPREL, 20 EXPAREL admixed with bupivacaine HCl and 
20 bupivacaine HCl) to meet the total requirements.  
 An efficacy interim analysis will occur when approximately 60 subjects have enro lled and provided complete 
data for the primary efficacy outcome.

1. Subjects may be screened on the same day as h ealth care facility  admission/surgery or up to 30 days prior to surgery but eligibility should be re -confirmed on day of surgery and 
ample time must be allowed for the informed consent process. Screening procedures that are standard of care at the institution may be completed prior to written informed 
consent. Any screening procedures that are not SOC must be completed after written informed consent is obtained.  
2. Subjects in Cohort 1 and Cohort  2 will be discharged after 168 h and 96 h assessments,  respectively. At discharge, subject should be re -instructed on duties with the e -diary.  
3. Provision of e -diary to subject, urine pregnancy test, and score of worst and average pain score over the previous 30 days to be assessed prior to study drug administration . The 
diary may be activated during the screening period in order to perform set -up and training,  but no data entry may occur in the e -diary  before the day of surgery.  
4.  Pregnancy test should be re -confirmed on the day of surgery prior to study drug administration . 
5. Block to be administered 90 min  (±30 min) prior to surgery.   
6.  To assess pain intensity at rest, the subject should rest quietly in a supine or seated position that does not exacerbate his or her postsurgical  pain for 5-10 minutes before entering 
the pain score using the NRS . This assessment should not be completed immediately following physical activity.

 7. Pain scores (24 h recall) once daily (i.e., worst/average pain) will be collected at 2 1:00 (±3 hours) from POD  1 to POD  14. Pain scores (current pain) will be collected beginning 
at PACU admission  (±5 min); q15 min in PACU   (±5 min); at PACU discharge  (±5 min) ; then q6h (±2 h) from end of surgery to 72 hours post -surgery and q6h (±3 h) from 78-
96 hours post -surgery.   
8. Breakthrough pain medication will be provided on a PRN basis in relation to the breakthrough pain intensity . Opioids should not be the first choice for pain relief, unless clinically 
indicated in the opinion of the Investigator, and should not be given on a schedule.  
9. For the initial treatment of post -surgical  pain, subjects may  receive acetaminophen or NSAIDs without exceeding the maximum daily dose.  If the initial pain treatment 
(acetaminophen or N SAIDs) is insufficient for pain relief , immediate release PO oxycodone may be offered in a stepwise approach:  initial dose of 5 mg oxycodone will be 
offered;  if the initial opioid dose is insufficient for pain relief, 10 mg oxycodone may be offered . If a s ubject is unable to tolerate PO medication or the PO oxycodone pain relief 
is insufficient, IV morphine (initiated at 2 mg) or hydromorphone (initiated at 0.2 mg) may be administered.

 7. INTRODUCTION  
7.1. Indication 
EXPAREL® was developed to extend pain relief with a single -dose administration without the use 
of indwelli ng catheters and to decrease the requirement for supplemental opioid medications.  
EXPAREL is indicated for single -dose infiltration in adults to produce postsurgical local analgesia 
and as an interscalene brachial plexus nerve block to produce postsurgica l regional analgesia.  
Effective postsurgical pain control is a critical element in subject recovery following surgery, as 
the majority of subjects may experience significant pain, particularly in the first few days . 
Improved postsurgical pain management co ntributes to better healing, faster subject mobilization, 
shortened hospital stays, and reduced healthcare costs ( American Society of Anesthesiologists 
Task Force on Pain Management 1995 ). 
7.2. Current Therapies/Treatments  
Current modalities of postsurgical  analgesia include wound infiltration with local anesthetics 
combined with the systemic administration of analgesics (multimodal therapy). Multimodal 
therapy usually includes opioid medications, which have considerable drawbacks, including time 
and resources required for monitoring opioid -related side effects. A reduction in the use of 
postsurgical  opioids is desirable to decrease the incidence and severity of opioid induced adverse 
events (AEs), such a s respiratory depression, nausea, vomiting, constipation, somnolence, pruritus, 
and urinary retention.  
With over 70 million surgeries performed annually in the US, postsurgical  pain is a ubiquitous 
condition among the US population. While it is a predictab le component of the postsurgical  
process, such pain is often poorly managed, resulting in clinical and physiological changes that increase morbidity and mortality (inability to ambulate early, etc.), diminish quality of life, and 
extend length of stay, the reby increasing hospital expenditures ( Oderda 2007) and reducing subject 
satisfaction . Effective relief of acute pain with minimal opioid complications, on the other hand, 
may improve clinical outcomes, avoid complications (like del ay in regaining bowel function or an 
inability to tolerate liquid and solid oral [PO] intake, etc.), and conserve healthcare resources . As 
such, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations requires that all 
healthcare facilities pract ice adequate pain management and monitor opioid- related AEs 
(Apfelbaum 2003).  
Opioid analgesics have long been established to be the most effective agents used for the management of moderate to severe postsurgical  pain and are curre ntly considered the mainstay of 
treatment. Opioid- only regimens are common and intravenous (IV) subject- controlled analgesia is 
a widely used delivery system for morphine sulfate . However, AEs related to opioid administration 
(e.g., nausea, vomiting, ileus , confusion) represent one important reason that there is a need to 
develop opioid- sparing strategies . Indeed, fear of gastrointestinal AEs, such as nausea and 
vomiting, as well as respiratory depression, present major limitations for the widespread use of  
opioid analgesics ( Chernin 2001, Viscusi 2009 ). Furthermore, management of opioid- related AEs 
often requires medical attention (e.g., opioid antagonists, antiemetic agents) and increased 
pharmacy/nursing time, which may raise healt hcare expenses ( Carroll 1994).

 7.3. EXPAREL (Bupivacaine Liposome Injectable Suspension)  
Bupivacaine is one of the longer -acting local anesthetics, but even so it has a limited duration of 
action after local administration, usually less than 8 hours . EXPAREL (Pacira Pharmaceuticals, 
Inc., [“Pacira”]) is a bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension . It consists of microscopic 
spherical, multivesicular liposomes (DepoFoam® drug delivery system) organized in a 
honeycomb- like structure compri sing numerous non- concentric internal aqueous chambers 
containing a bupivacaine base at a concentration of 13.3 mg/mL . Each chamber is separated from 
adjacent chambers by lipid membranes. The lipids (phospholipids, cholesterol, and triglycerides) 
are natur ally occurring or close analogs of endogenous lipids . Bupivacaine is slowly released from 
the DepoFoam particles by a complex mechanism involving reorganization of the barrier lipid 
membranes and subsequent diffusion of the drug over an extended period of time.  
EXPAREL was approved by the US FDA in 2011 for administration into the surgical site to 
produce postsurgical analgesia. The active ingredient (bupivacaine) and inactive ingredient 
(DepoFoam) of EXPAREL are each contained, though separately, in FDA -approved products.  
• Bupivacaine hydrochloride (HCl) solution, a well -characterized anesthetic/analgesic, 
with more than 35 years of use in the US.  
• DepoFoam, a liposomal extended -release formulation contained in the marketed 
product DepoCyt® (1999). The form of DepoFoam used in EXPAREL has a slightly 
different mixture of liquid components than that used in DepoCyt. 
7.4. Summary of Human Experience with EXPAREL  
Pacira has conducted more than 36 clinical studies and one observational follow -up study to 
investigate EX PAREL. Across these studies, over 1800 human subjects received EXPAREL at 
doses ranging from 2 mg to 665 mg (equivalent to 2 mg to 750 mg bupivacaine HCl) administered 
by various routes: local infiltration into the surgical site, subcutaneous, perineural ( or nerve block), 
and epidural. EXPAREL has been generally well tolerated and, in active comparator studies, AEs 
occurred at a similar rate as the corresponding bupivacaine HCl controls. 
EXPAREL was initially approved by the US FDA in 2011 for single -dose administration into the 
surgical site to produce postsurgical analgesia. The indication was amended and approved by the 
US FDA in 2018 to read: “EXPAREL is indicated for single -dose infiltration in adults to produce 
postsurgical local analgesia and as an interscalene brachial plexus block to produce postsurgical 
regional analgesia.” Since its approval, EXPAREL has been administered to approximately 5 million subjects in the US (Jan uary 2019). 
Following the initial approval of EXPAREL, numerous c linical studies were conducted in which 
EXPAREL was administered via various routes of administration, including interscalene nerve block ( Sternlicht 2014, Feierman 2014) .

 7.5. Rationale for the Study  
Pacira is investigating the pharmacokinetics (PK) , efficacy, and safety of EXPAREL administered 
as combined sciatic (in the popliteal fossa) and saphenous (in the adductor canal) nerve block in 
healthy adult subjects undergoing lower extremity surgeries .  
A dose of 20 mL (266 mg) EXPAREL  with 20 mL of saline or EXPAREL admixed with 20 mL  
(50 mg) 0.2 5% bupivacaine HCl is expected to provide prolonged pain relief after these painful 
procedures  compared with 40 mL (100mg) 0.25% bupivacaine  HCl when injected in 20 mL 
volumes in sciatic nerve (in th e popliteal fossa) and the saphenous nerve (in the adductor canal) . 
8. OBJECTIVES  
The study objectives following  the administration of study drug as a combined sciatic (in the 
popliteal fossa) and saphenous (in the adductor canal) nerve blocks in subjects undergoing lower extremity surgeries are listed below.  
8.1. Primary Objective 
To compare the magnitude of the analges ic effect following a single dose injection of EXPAREL 
vs. 0.25% bupivacaine HCl. 
8.2. Secondary Objective s 
• To compare the total opioid consumption (in oral morphine equivalents) from 0 to 96 hours following a single dose injection of EXPAREL vs . 0.25% bupivaca ine HCl  
• To compare the time to first opioid consumption following a single dose injection of 
EXPAREL vs . 0.25% bupivacaine HCl  
• To characterize and compare the magnitude of the analgesic effect following a single dose injection of EXPAREL vs. EXPAREL admixe d with 0.25% bupivacaine HCl  
• To characterize and compare the magnitude of the duration of motor block following a single dose injection of EXPAREL vs. EXPAREL admixed with 0.25%  bupivacaine HCl  
• To assess the efficacy, safety , and pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of EXPAREL ; 
EXPAREL admixed with 0.25% bupivacaine HCl  and/or  0.25% bupivacaine HC l 
9. OVERALL STUDY DESIGN  AND PLAN  
9.1. Study Design  
This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double- blind, active controlled, 3-arm study in 
approximately 120 subjects undergoing lower extremity surgeries. The study will have 2 cohorts. 
Both cohorts will enroll in parallel.

EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  27 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 Cohort 1 will enroll about 60 subjects undergoing bunionectomy to obtain information on PK 
profile, pharmacodynamics (PD), efficacy, and safety. Subjects in this cohort will be randomized 
(1:1:1) to receive combined sciatic (in the popliteal fossa)  and saphenous (in the adductor canal) 
nerve blocks  with EXPAREL,  EXPAREL  admixed with  0.25% bupivacaine HC l, or 
0.25%  bupivacaine HCl. Only select sites will enroll subjects for Cohort 1.  
Cohort 2 will enroll about 60 subjects to obtain information on efficacy and safety. Subjects in this 
cohort will receive combined sciatic (in the popliteal fossa)  and saphenous (in the adductor canal) 
nerve blocks . Subjects will be randomized ( 1:1:1) to receive EXPAREL, EXPAREL admixed with 
0.25% bupivacaine HC l, or 0.25% bupivacaine HCl, and will be stratified  by each surgery 
grouping.  
Subjects in Cohort 1 and C ohort 2 will be discharged after the completion of the 168 h and 96 h 
assessments, respectively.  
An adaptive study design will be used  in this study. For efficacy, an interim analysis will occur 
when a total of approximately 60 subjects combined f rom eith er Cohort  1 or Cohort 2 have enrolled 
and provided complete assessment data for the ir primary efficacy outcome.

 9.2.1. Study Stopping Rules  
If Pacira, the investigator, or officials from regulatory authorities discover conditions during the 
study that indicate that the study or study site should be terminated, this action may be taken after 
Pacira has consulted with appropriate regulatory authorities and notified the investigator(s).  
The Pacira Medical Monitor and Pharmacovigilance team review all serious adverse events 
(SAEs) reported from Pacira clinical studies on an ongoing basis and in real time (i.e., as the events 
are reported) . The Medical Monitor is responsible for temporarily pausing the study if the type, 
frequency, or seriousnes s/severity of such events suggests a potential threat to the safety of the 
study subjects. If such action is taken, a thorough review of all available data will be performed. Based on the results of this review and discussions with investigators and/or reg ulatory authorities, 
the study may be restarted or permanently terminated  as warranted . 
This trial design also includes efficacy stopping rules using group sequential design stopping rules 
as described in Section  15.8. 
In addition, any death will be thoroughly reviewed, and appropriate action taken.  
9.3. Discussion of Study Design 
This phase 3, multicenter, double -blinded, randomized, active controlled study will enroll 
approximately 120 subjects  to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EXPAREL , EXPAREL  admixed 
with 0.25% bupivacaine HC l and 0.25% bupivacaine HCl when administered as a combined sciatic 
(in the popliteal fossa)  and saphenous (in the adductor canal) nerve blocks , in subjects undergoing 
lower extremity surgeries.  
Only Cohort 1 subjects , 60 subjects all undergoing bunionectomy surgery, will provide blood 
samples for PK assessments. Subjects in this cohort will provide information on efficacy and safety 
of EXPAREL , EXPAREL  admixed with  0.25% bupivacaine HC l, and 0.25% bupivacaine HCl .  
Cohort 2 will assess the efficacy and safety of EXPAREL , EXPAREL  admixed with  
0.25%  bupivacaine HC l, and 0.25% bupivacaine HCl in 60 subjects undergoing lower extremity 
surgery.  
The three treatment arms of the study for Cohort 1 and 2 are as follows:  
• EXPAREL arm:  subjects randomized to th is treatment arm will receive 20 mL  
(266 mg) EXPAR EL mixed with 20  mL saline.  
• EXPAREL admix arm : subjects randomized to this treatment  arm will receive 
20 mL  (266 mg) EXPAREL  admixed with  20 m L (50 mg)  0.25% bupivacaine HCl . 
• Bupivacaine HCl arm : subjects randomized to this treatment arm  will receive 40 mL 
(100 mg) 0. 25% bupivacaine HC l.

participation in the study  
9. Currently on a neuromodulating agent  (e.g., gabapentin, pregabalin [Lyrica], duloxetine 
[Cymbalta] , etc.) 
10. Inadequate sensory function on the foot (monofilament test)  
11. Chronic opioid use with in 30 days prior to randomizati on (average  ≥30 oral morphine  
equivalents/day)  
Given the COVID- 19 pandemic, i f there is a concern about a subject's recent or potential exposure 
to COVID- 19, or if the subject is not medically fit/cleared for surgery due to suspected COVID -
19 illness/symptoms, the subject must be  exclude d per Exclusion criterion #8. 
10.3. Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment  
Every reasonable effort will be made to maintain subject compliance and participation in the study. 
Reasons for discontinuation of any subject from the study will be recorded. 
If any clinically significant event or condition  is uncovered during the study period (e.g., excessive 
bleeding, acute sepsis) that might render the subject medically unstable or compromise the 
subject’s postsurgical  course, the subject should be withdrawn from the study and the event or 
condition shoul d be reported as an AE or SAE.  
If a subject withdraws from the study and has an ongoing AE, every effort must be made to follow up on such events until satisfactory resolution is obtained or further follow -up is otherwise no 
longer warranted.  
10.3.1. Withdrawal Se condary to Adverse Events 
If a subject experiences an AE that renders the subject incapable of continuing with the remaining assessments, the subject will be discontinued from further participation in the study. A final 
evaluation, including the End of Study assessments (see Section  10.3.3) , should be performed so 
that the subject’s study participation can be terminated in a safe and orderly manner.  
Any subject who discontinues because of an AE should be instructed to notify the study personnel 
of any abnormal symptoms and to come to the study site if medical evaluation is needed and the 
Pacira Pharmaceuticals , Inc.       402-C-333 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  32 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 urgency of the situation permits . Any subject exhibiting AEs will r eceive appropriate treatment at 
the discretion of the investigator until resolution of the AE .  
For emergencies and other unscheduled visits to a medical facility other than the study site, medical 
records must be obtained by the investigator and appropria te information captured in the subject’s 
case report form (CRF).  
In addition, the subject may be withdrawn from the study if the subject meets the following criterion during or after the surgery:  
Any clinically significant event or condition uncovered during the surgery (e.g., excessive bleeding, acute sepsis) that, in the opinion of the investigator, renders the subject medically unstable or complicates the subject’s postsurgical  course.  
10.3.2. Voluntary  or Study Investigator Withdrawal  
Subjects are free to discontinue from the study at any time, without prejudice to future treatment. A subject may be discontinued from the study if the subject refuses study treatment (i.e ., combined 
sciatic [in the popliteal fossa ] and saphenous [in the adductor canal ] nerve blocks ) or refuses to 
comply with study procedures. Subjects should be encouraged to complete the study safety assessments. Reasons for discontinuation from the study will be recorded.  
If a subje ct is discontinued by the investigator or voluntarily withdraws from the study after 
receiving the study drug, the subject will be asked to complete a final evaluation, including the early termination  assessments (see Section  10.3.3), so that the subject can be withdrawn in a safe 
and orderly manner . 
After termination from the study, the subject may be followed for safety including monitoring of AEs thro ugh POD  14. 
10.3.3. Early Termination Assessments  
In case of early termination , the following assessments shall be performed :  
• Record date and time of withdrawal  
• Record responses to pain assessment :  
− Pain intensity scores on the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) measured  as “How 
much pain are you experiencing right now?”  
− Pain intensity scores ( using the NRS) measured as “What was your worst pain in 
the last 24  hours?”  
− Pain intensity scores ( using the NRS) measured as “What was your average pain 
in the last 24 hours?”  
• Remi nd to return the e -diary (if applicable)  
• Final phone call for safety

 11. TREATMENTS  
11.1. Treatments to be Administered 
Cohort 1: PK, PD, E fficacy, and S afety  
The participants enrolled in Cohort 1 will provide blood samples  for PK  and measures for efficacy 
and safety. About 60 subjects undergoing bunionectomy will be enrolled in this cohort. On the  day 
of surgery, eligible subjects will be randomized ( 1:1:1) to receive EXPAREL (n=20), EXPAREL  
admixed with 0.25% bupivacaine  HCl (n=20), or 0.25% bupivacaine HCl (n= 20) as a combined 
sciatic (in the popliteal fossa)  and saphenous (in the adductor canal) nerve blocks .  
Cohort 2: Efficacy and S afety  
The participants enrolled in Cohort 2 will provide measures for efficacy and safety. About 
60 subjects will be enrolled in this cohort. On day of surgery, eligible subjects will be randomized 
1:1:1 to receive EXPAREL (n= 20), EXPAREL admixed with 0.25% bupivacaine HCl (n= 20), or 
bupivacaine HCl (n=20). All subjects will receive combined sciatic (in the popliteal fossa)  and 
saphenous (in the adductor canal) nerve blocks , by stratifying by each surgery grouping. 
Treatments for Cohort 1 and Cohort 2  
On the day of surgery, Cohort 1 and 2 subjects  will receive ultrasound -guided combined sciatic 
(in popliteal fossa) and adductor canal nerve block with one of the following treatments:  
• EXPAREL  arm: subjects randomized to this treatment arm will receive 20 mL 
(266 mg) EXPAREL mixed with 20 mL saline  
• EXPAREL admix arm : subjects randomized to th is treatment arm will receive 20 mL 
(266 mg) EXPAREL admixed with 20 mL (50 mg) 0.25% bupivacaine HCl  
• Bupivacaine HCl arm :  subjects randomized to this treatment arm will receive 40 mL 
(100 mg) 0.25% bupivacaine HCl  
Block P rocedure:   
Subjects may be lightly sedated with 1  to 2 mg of midazolam IV before the block procedure. The 
study drug ( EXPAREL, EXPAREL admixed with 0.25% bupivacaine  HCl, or 0.25%  bupivacaine  
HCl) will be administered under  ultrasound guidance 90 mi n (±30 min) prior to surgery.  
For all arms, the total volume (40 mL) will be split such that 20 mL will be administered as the 
sciatic nerve block (in popliteal fossa) and 20 mL will be administered as the saphenous nerve 
block (in the adductor canal ).  
11.1.1. Study Drug Administration Considerations  
As described in the EXPAREL Ful l Prescribing Information  (November 2018), no agents are to 
be admixed with EXPAREL (e.g., epinephrine, dexamethasone, clonidine) other than bupivacaine  
HCl. Lidocaine and other local anesthetics are not permitted to be locally administered during the 
surgery because they are known to interact with EXPAREL, resulting in the displacement of 
bupivacaine and elevated plasma levels. When a topical antiseptic is applied to the surgical site, 
the solutions should not be allowed to come in contact with each other (e.g., the area must be dry 
Pacira Pharmaceuticals , Inc.       402-C-333 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  34 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 before EXPAREL is administered) . Upon discovering use of any prohibited therapy and/or 
medication during or after surgery, the investigator should document all events that led to the 
deviation, write a note to file, and notify t he Pacira Medical Monitor accordingly.  
EXPAREL may not be administered to a subject if the vial has been open for more than 4 hours . 
In order to prevent EXPAREL from settling, gently inverting and re inverting the syringe prior to administration is recomme nded.  
The maximum dosage of EXPAREL should not exceed 266 mg.  
11.1.2. Bupivacaine  HCl Administration Considerations  
Given the potential risk of severe adverse effects associated with bupivacaine HCl, the study sites 
must be equipped to manage subjects with any e vidence of cardiac, neurological, or respiratory 
toxicity .   
Bupivacaine  HCl is contraindicated in subjects with known hypersensitivity to amide -like local 
anesthetics. Caution must be exercised to prevent incidental intravenous administration of bupivacai ne during block placement.  
11.2. Identity of the Investigational Products 
11.2.1. Description of EXPAREL  
EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) is formulated as a sterile, non -pyrogenic , 
white to off -white, preservative -free homogenous suspension of bupiva caine encapsulated into 
multivesicular liposomes (DepoFoam drug delivery system). Bupivacaine is present at a nominal 
concentration of 13.3 mg/mL. For this study, EXPAREL will be provided in 20- mL, 1.3% 
(13.3 mg/mL) single -use, clear glass vials. EXPAREL v ials should be stored refrigerated at 2°C 
to 8°C (36°F to 46°F). 
11.2.2. Description of Reference Product  
The reference product is 0.25% bupivacaine HCl administered via combined sciatic (in popliteal 
fossa) and adductor canal nerve block. 
11.3. Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment 
11.3.1. Randomization Scheme  
This is a randomized study. Cohort 1 will enroll approximately 60 total subjects  undergoing 
bunionectomy surgery  randomized 1:1:1 in the EXPAREL arm, EXPAREL admixed with 
0.25%  bupivacaine HCl  arm (“admix” arm) , and bupivacaine HCl arm .   
Cohort 2 will enroll approximately 60 total subjects undergoing distal lower extremity surgery , 
20 subjects  in each treatment arm ; EXPAREL  arm, EXPAREL admix  arm, and bupivacaine HCl  
arm. Subjects will be randomized 1 :1:1 to treatment groups, by stratifying  by surgery grouping. 
The randomization code will be generated by a centralized randomization system, whic h will also 
be used to communicate subject randomizations to study sites . All randomized subjects will have

EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  35 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 both a unique subject identifier and a unique randomization code . No subject or randomization 
code identifiers will be reused once assigned.  
11.3.2. Randomization Procedures 
Once a subject is identified as being qualified for the study in accordance with the eligibility 
criteria (see Section  10.1  and Section  10.2 ), the investigator or designee will obtain a 
randomization assignment  on the day of surgery . In rare cases, i f a subject has an early morning 
surgery and there would not be enough time to obtain study drug from the pharmacy, sites will be 
permitted to randomize the subject the day before  the surgery (after contacting the subject the day  
before surgery to confirm eligibility details) . The e-diary may be activated during the screening 
period in order to perform set -up and training,  but no data entry may occur in the e -diary before 
the day of surgery. The subject will be considered randomized into the study once the study 
treatment assignment is assigned.  
11.3.3. Replacement of Subjects  
Subjects who withdraw from the study before receiving study drug may be replaced. Once a subject 
number is assigned, subject numbers will not be reused; subjects enrolled to replace those who 
withdr aw will be assigned a unique subject number  and randomized to treatment according to the 
procedures outlined above . Subjects who are randomized but are withdrawn from the study before 
receiving study drug or do not undergo the surgical procedure may be replaced. Additionally, subjects may be replaced if insufficient and/or incomplete data are noted on PK  profiles  or efficacy 
endpoints . 
11.4. Selection of Doses in the Study  
During the clinical development of EXPAREL, single doses ranging from 2 mg to 665 mg have 
been safely administered via various routes . Pharmacokinetic studies have shown that because 
EXPAREL releases bupivacaine gradually as the lipid structure breaks down, administration of 
EXPAREL 266 mg results in a maximum plasma concentration equivalent to that seen with 
standard bupivacaine HC l 100 mg. Clinical studies have shown that, for wound infiltration, a total 
dose of 266 mg (20 mL) of EXPAREL is safe and efficacious . Based on this experience, the FDA -
approved marketed dose of 266 mg was deemed appropriate for this study .  
As a part of the clinical developmental program, a pilot dose -escalation study (402- C-122) 
evaluating the PK , PD, and safety of EXPAREL as a sciatic nerve block in the popliteal fossa in 
subjects undergoing bunionectomy was conducte d. The preliminary results for this study showed 
that compared to the EXPAREL 266 mg or 133 mg admixed groups , EXPAREL 266 mg had 
similar NRS pain scores, opioid consumption, and onset and duration of block, but produced lower 
PK concentrations of bupivaca ine HCl. Thus, a total dose of 266 mg was deemed appropriate for 
the current study population administered in two halves as 133 mg EXPAREL in each of the sciatic and saphenous nerve  blocks .

 11.5. Blinding  
11.5.1. Unblinding Procedures  
Blinded study personnel should not be unblinded to the subject treatment assignments during the 
study. The investigator will have the ability to unblind a subject through the randomization system 
if it is felt that subject safety warrants such unblinding. However, if possible, th e investigator 
should discuss the safety issues with the Pacira Medical Monitor before attempting such 
unblinding. Any unblinding will be documented through immediate notification of the Pacira study team and the investigator within the interactive respons e technology system used for 
randomization. The reason for unblinding will be documented. Any accidental unblinding events (i.e., through mishaps in the operating room or miscommunication among study staff) must be 
reported to Pacira immediately. Any unbli nding performed through the randomization system will 
be recorded as a transaction , and the appropriate study personnel will be notified that such a 
transaction occurred. Any incidence(s) of unblinding will be noted in the clinical study report with a full  discussion of the events leading to the decision to unblind. 
11.5.2. Blinding Procedure  
EXPAREL, EXPAREL admixed with 0.25% bupivacaine HCl , and 0.25% bupivacaine HCl are 
visually distinguishable; therefore, to maintain the double -blind study design, the individu als 
preparing and administering study drug, or transporting unblinded drug will not be allowed to 
perform any of the study assessments after randomization  (with the possible logistical exception 
of drawing blood in the  operating room ( OR) to be processed b y blinded staff for the PK 
assessments) or reveal the assigned study treatment to any other members of the study team at any 
time. Additionally, efforts will be made to prevent the subject from observing the study drug 
syringe . Syringes containing study dr ug will need to be gently inverted several times to re -suspend 
any settling of the study drug that may have occurred prior to administration. The administration 
of study drug will be recorded using the minimal amount of information necessary to avoid unbli nding staff who will be participating in blinded procedures.  
Staff members conducting study- specific, postsurgical assessments and the subjects will remain 
blinded to the assigned treatment throughout the study in part by not being present during the 
admin istration of the nerve blocks .  
If a subject  experiences an SAE, Pacira will not automatically unblind the subject’s treatment, 
unless it is necessary to manage treatment of the SAE. Expedited SAEs will be unblinded by Pacira for regulatory reporting purposes.  
At each site, only the designated unblinded pharmacist will receive unblinded randomization 
assignments ; the designated unblinded pharmacist or administrator will  be responsible for 
preparing study drug. 
No crossover will be permitted between the blin ded and unblinded study site personnel throughout 
the study. The assignment of site monitors will also be segregated. Blinded monitors will review 
CRFs, clinic charts, and all other study -related documents that do not disclose the allocation of 
study treat ment. Care should be taken in recording and review of OR records to not record 
information in an unblinded fashion. Pharmacy or any other clinic records providing unblinded

 information (e.g., randomization, study drug preparation, study drug accountability, study drug 
administration) will be reviewed by specialized unblinded monitors who will notify Pacira of 
treatment noncompliance.  
The independent review committee conduct ing the interim analyses will not be blinded to the study 
drug. 
Additional details are outlined in the study- specific Blinding Plan.  
11.6. Prior and Concomitant Therapy and Medications  
Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization  Drug Dictionary. 
The number and percent of subjects taking concomitant medications will be tabulated for each 
treatment group by Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical  class and preferred terms.  
11.6.1. Prior to  Study Drug Administration  
Permitted Prior Medications and The rapy:  
• Low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection 
• 1 to 2 mg of midazolam (Versed)  
Restricted Prior Medications and Th erapy:  
• Systemic glucocorticosteroids and neuro modulating agents (e.g., gabapentin, 
pregabalin [Lyrica], duloxetine [Cymbalta], etc.)  
• Long- acting or sustained release opioid medications and NSAIDs (except for low -dose 
aspirin used for cardioprotection) are not permitted within 3 days of study drug administration .  
• Dexmedetomidine HCl (Precedex) use is not permitted within 3 days of study drug administration . 
• No opioid medications are permitted within 24 hours of study drug administration.  
• Use of an investigational product within 30 days or 5 elimination half -lives of such 
investigational drug, whichever is longer, prior to study drug administration, or planned 
administration of another investigational product or procedure during the subject’s 
participation in this study is not permitted . 
• No drugs (other than the described bupivacaine  HCl admixture) are to be admixed with 
study drug (e.g., epinephrine , dexamethasone, clonidine) .  
• Lidocaine and other local anesthetics will not be permitted to be locally administered 
in the area of the nerve block administration  other than use in a superficial cutaneous 
wheal for needle insertion . 
11.6.2. Perioperative  
Permitted  Medications :

CONFIDENTIAL  38 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 • Acceptable anesthetic techniques include general anesthesia or non -opioid sedation 
(except fentanyl , not to exceed 1 ug/kg unless deemed medically necessary ). 
Neuroaxial  or regional anesthesia technique (except the investigational related block s) 
are not permitted .  
• Single -dose administration of ondansetron or metoclopramide may be used intra -
operatively for nausea/vomiting prevention.  
Restricted  Medications : 
• Intraoperative use of opioids ( except fentanyl , not to ex ceed 1  ug/kg unless deemed 
medically necessary ) and ketamine will not be permitted.  
• The use of dexamethasone, acetaminophen/paracetamol, ketorolac, or other NSAIDs 
will not be permitted preemptively or  intraoperatively except for emergency use to treat 
an AE.  
• Lidocaine and other local anesthetics will not be permitted to be locally administered 
in the area of the nerve block administration . 
11.6.3. Post-surgery  
Permitted  Medications : 
• Ondansetron or metoclopramide may be used for postoperative nausea and vomiting.  
• Postsurgical pain medications  for breakthrough pain  as outlined in  Section  11.7.  
Restricted  Medications : 
• No other analgesics, including fentanyl, are permitted within 96 hours after surgery.  
• Patient Controlled Analgesia is not permitted.  
• Dexmedetomidine HCl (Precedex) use is prohibited.  
• Lidocaine and other local anesthetics will not be permitted to be locally administered 
in the area of the nerve block administration through POD  7. 
11.7. Postsurgical Pain  Medication for Breakthrough Pain 
An unscheduled pain intensity assessment using the NRS (me asured as “How much pain are you 
experiencing right now?”) must be completed immediately prior to administration of any 
breakthrough pain medication up to 96 hours post -surgery . All opioid and other analgesics (pain 
medications) administered post- surgery  through POD  14 must  be recorded.  
Medications will be provided on a n as needed  (PRN)  basis in relation to the breakthrough pain 
intensity . The intent is to use the guide below  in a step -wise approach; acetaminophen or NSAIDs 
should be used for the initial t reatment of post- surgical pain and escalation to opioids (and 
subsequent increased dose of opioids) should be implemented if the initial pain treatment (and initial opioid dose) is insufficient for pain relief.  Opioids should not be the first choice for pa in 
relief unless clinically indicated in the opinion of the investigator and should not be given on a 
schedule .

EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  39 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 • For the  initial treatment of post-surgical  pain, subjects may receive either 
acetaminophen or NSAIDs without exceeding the maximum daily dose.  
• If the initial pain treatment (acetaminophen or NSAIDs ) is insuffici ent for pain relief, 
immediate release PO oxycodone may  be administered in a stepwise approach:  
− Initial dose of 5 mg oxycodone may  be offered ; 
− If the initial opioid  dose is insufficient for pain relief, 10 mg oxycodone may be 
offered . 
• If a subject is unable to tolerate PO medication or the PO oxycodone pain relief is 
insufficient, IV morphine (initiated at 2 mg) or hydromorphone (initiated at 0.2 mg) may be administered.  
Post discharge, the subject may be provided with a prescription for oxycodone 5 mg. The subject 
may take acetaminophen, NSAIDs , or the prescribed oxycodone  and will be given instructions on 
which medication to take PRN based on the ir pain  intensity.  
11.8. Treatment Compliance 
Not applicable, since study drug (EXPAREL , EXPAREL admix,  or bupivacaine HCl) will be 
administered preoperatively by the study staff.  
11.9. Accountability of Study Drug 
Any shipment of EXPAREL for the study will contain an invest igational drug transmittal and 
receipt form to assist the Investigator or designee (e.g., pharmacist) in maintaining current and 
accurate inventory records. At a minimum, the Investigator or designee will maintain accurate 
records demonstrating dates and units of drug received, lot numbers, subjects to whom drug was administered, and accounts of any drug destroyed accidentally or deliberately. The Investigator 
must retain vials containing used, unused, or expired study drug for return or destruction, as 
instructed by Pacira, following confirmation of drug accountability data by an unblinded study 
monitor. A record of drug return or destruction will be maintained and provided to Pacira. Inventory records must be readily available for inspection by the unblinded study monitor and 
appropriate regulatory authorities at any time. A copy of the inventory records, drug accountability information, and notice of return or destruction will be returned to Pacira at the end of the study. 
Only authorized personnel identif ied by the Investigator will have the ability to access and 
administer the study drug. 
12. STUDY ENDPOINTS AND MEASUREMENTS

through POD 14 
12.5. Pharmacokinetic Assessments (Cohort 1 only)  
Blood samples for PK assessment will be obtained from the Cohort 1 subjects. A total of 17 PK samples will be collected for each subject. These samples will be obtained at predose (up to 15  min 
before bloc k), 30 min (±5 min), 45 min (±5 min), and 1 h (±15 min), 2 h (±30 min), 8 h (±30 min), 
12 h (±30 min), 24 h (±1 h), 30 h (±1 h), 48 h (±1 h), 60 h (±2 h), 72 h (±2 h), 84 h (±2 h), 96 h (±3 h), 120 h (±3 h), 144 h (±3 h), and 168 h (±3 h) hours from end of  block procedure. (See  
Table  2). 
12.6. Pharmacokinetic Endpoints (Cohort 1 only)  
The following model -predicted PK endpoints will be determined:  
• Area under the plasma  concentration -versus -time curve (AUC) 
• Maximum plasma concentration (C max) and time of C max (Tmax) 
• The apparent terminal elimination half- life (t 1/2el) 
• Apparent clearance (CL/F)  
• Apparent volume of distribution (Vd)  
12.7. Pharmacodynamic Assessments (Cohort 1 only)  
Pharmaco dynamic assessments must be performed by trained licensed medical staff (e.g., 
Physician, Registered Nurse, Physician Assistant) and documented on the investigator’s study 
delegation log. A limited number of study staff should perform the sensory/motor assessments.  
Assessment of sensory functions  (Light Touch Assessment and Cold Sensation Assessment) : 
• Sensory function s will be assessed using a wooden tongue depressor  and ice. These 
assessment s will evaluate light touch  and cold sensation. The light touch assessment 
will be done first, followed by the cold sensation assessment. T he tongue depressor  
application  and ice application will be performed at predose (up to 15 min before 
block), 15 min (±5  min), 30 min (±5  min), 45 min  (±5 min), 1  h (±15 min), 
2 h (±30 min), 8  h (±30  min), 12 h (±30 min),  24 h (±1  h), 30 h (±1 h), 48 h (±1 h),

 assessment will be rated independently. Each cold sensation assessment will be rated 
independently. Additional unscheduled assessment s may be performed, particularly 
around the surgery, if no onset of block is noted on the last scheduled assessment prior 
to surgery. For each sensory assessment performed, all 4 locations (as described in 
Appendix 4, Section  18.4) will be assessed for both light touch and cold (e.g., total of 
8 independent ratings will be performed for each sensory assessment).  
Onset of sensory block  (sciatic and saphenous nerve tracked independently ) will be 
defined as the earliest timepoint with loss of light touch sensation  and/or cold sensation  
along the d istribution of the target nerve distal to the site of the block . 
Offset of sensory block  (sciatic and saphenous nerve tracked independently) will be 
defined as recovery of light touch sensation and/or cold sensation along the distribution of 
the target nerve  distal to the site of the block  on 2 consecutive  assessments.  After offset of 
all sensory assessments  are noted (on 2 consecutive assessments  for all 4  areas for both 
touch and cold sensation ), no subsequent assessments will be conducted.  
Duration of sensory block  will be defined as the time between onset and offset of light 
touch sensory and/or cold sensation block for each nerve in dividually (see Appendix 4, 
Section  18.4 ). 
Assessment of motor function (onset and offset of motor block):  
• Motor function (onset and offset of motor block) will be assessed by voluntary active 
movement of the foot. This will be used to determine the onset and duration of motor 
blockade. The motor function test will be performed at predose (up to 15 min before 
block), 15 min (±5 min), 30 min (±5 min), 45 min (±5 min), 1 h (±15 min), 2 h 
(±30 min), 8 h (±30 min), 12 h (±30 min), 24 h (±1 h), 30 h (±1 h), 48 h (±1 h), 60 h 
(±2 h), 72 h (±2 h), 84 h (±2 h), 96 h (±3 h), 120 h (±3 h), 144 h (±3 h), and 168 h 
(±3 h) from end of block procedure, or until full motor function has returned to predose 
levels in two consecutive evaluations.  Additiona l unscheduled assessments may be 
performed, particularly around the  surgery, if no onset of block is noted on the last 
scheduled assessment prior to surgery.  
Onset of motor block  (sciatic)  will be defined as the earliest timepoint with partial or no 
foot m ovement.  
Offset of motor block  (sciatic) will be defined as resolution of the motor block with 
complete foot movement on two consecutive assessments. After offset of motor block is noted (on 2 consecutive assessments), no subsequent assessments will be co nducted.  
Duration of motor block  will be defined as time between onset and offset of motor block 
(see Appendix  3, Section  18.3).  
12.8. Pharmacodynamic Endpoints (Cohort 1 only)  
The following pharmacodynamics endpoints  will be determined : 
• Median  time to onset of sensory block and motor block

EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  43 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 • Median  duration of sensory block and motor block  
12.9. Appropriateness of Measures  
Endpoints selected for this study were based on validated methodologies and other well -
established clinical measurements used in the peer reviewed literature. Measurements were further 
refined in this study based  on previous nerve block experience with EXPAREL and other 
Phase 3 or  4 studies.  
13. STUDY PROCEDURES  
A time and events schedule for all study procedures is provided in  Table  1 and Table  2. 
13.1. Instructions for Conducting Procedures and Measures 
All PK, sensory/motor function assessments, and safety assessments conducted after baseline (predose ) will be timed from the end of the blo ck. End of block procedure is defined as the time 
of completion of study drug administration after combined sciatic (in popliteal fossa) and 
saphenous (in the adductor canal ) nerve blocks . 
At timepoints when multiple assessments coincide,  assessment s will be performed in the following 
sequence:  pain intensity assessment , sensory assessments, motor assessment, blood draw for PK 
assessment  as applicable.  
The start  of surgery  is defined as the time of the first incision. The end of surgery  is defined as 
the time recorded in the surgical record. Postsurgical  is defined as after the end of surgery.  
Postsurgical analgesia and collection of study data through the primary endpoint  will take place 
under the supervision of study staff at the site.  
Subjects will be provided an e -diary  on the day of surgery and instructed on duties and 
responsibilities with the e -diary.  
13.1.1. Pain Intensity Assessment  
Pain intensity will be assessed using an  11-point NRS (0 -10) as follows : 
• Pain intensity scores ( using the NRS) measured as “How much pain are you 
experiencing right now?” will be assessed:  
− Upon arrival in the PACU (±5 min)  
− Every 15 mins in the PACU  (±5 min) 
− Prior to PACU discharge  (±5 min)  
− Every  6 hours from the end of surgery until 96 hours: 6 h (±2 h), 12 h (±2 h), 
18 h (±2  h), 24 h (±2 h), 30 h (±2 h), 36 h (±2 h), 42 h (±2  h), 48 h (±2 h), 54 h

CONFIDENTIAL  44 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 − If a subject is asleep, the subject will not be awakened to assess pain. If the subject 
awakens within the assessment window, a pain score will be collected then  
− Subjects will be instructed not to complete the NRS pain intensity score after any 
physica l activity, including the motor block assessment. If that is not possible, to 
assess pain intensity at rest, the subject should rest quietly in a supine or seated 
position that does not exacerbate his or her postsurgical  pain for 5- 10 minutes 
before enteri ng the pain score using the NRS . Subjects will also be required to 
provide unscheduled pain assessments prior to consumption of any breakthrough pain medication.  
− An unscheduled NRS assessment will be obtained immediately prior to 
administration of any brea kthrough pain medication until 96 hours post -surgery.  
• Pain intensity scores (NRS) once daily at 2 1:00 (±3 h) from POD 1 to POD  14 
measured as “What was your worst  pain in the last 24 hours?”  
• Pain intensity scores (NRS) once daily at 2 1:00 (±3 h) from POD 1 to POD  14 
measured as “What was your average  pain in the last 24 hours?”  
Subjects will be instructed to focus all NRS pain intensity ratings on the operative ankle/foot , and 
not other locations where they may be experiencing pain.  
13.1.2. Subject Satisfaction w ith Postsurgical Pain Control  
Subject satisfaction with pain management using 1 question from the International Pain Outcome 
(IPO) questionnaire will be recorded at 96 hours  (±3 h) post-surgery . (see Appendix 2, 
Section  18.2 ). 
13.1.3. Pharmacokinetic Assessments (Cohort  1 only)  
Blood samples for PK assessment will be obtained from the Cohort 1 subjects. A total of 17 PK samples will be collected for each subject. These samples will be obtained at predose (up to 15  min 
before block), 30 min (±5 min), 45 min (±5 min), and 1 h (±15 min), 2 h (±30 min), 8 h (±30 min), 12 h (±30 min), 24 h (±1 h), 30 h (±1 h), 48 h (±1 h), 60 h (±2 h), 72 h (±2 h), 84 h (±2  h), 96 h 
(±3 h), 120 h (±3 h), 144 h (±3 h), and 168 h (±3 h) from end of block procedure. (See Table  2). 
13.1.4. Pharmacodynamic assessment (Cohort 1 only)  
Onset and duration of sensory block  will be assessed using the light touch assessment  and/or  cold 
sensation  to characteri ze the sensory block (see Appendix 4, Section  18.4 ).  
Onset and duration of motor block  will be assessed using the movement of the foot to characterize 
the motor block (see Appendix 3, Section  18.3 ). 
Pharmacodynamic assessments must be performed by trained licensed medical staff (e.g., Physician, Registered Nurse, Physician Assistant) and documented on the investigator’s study 
delegation log. A limited number of study staff should perform the sensory/motor assessments.

 13.2. Study Procedures  
13.2.1. Obtaining Informed Consent  
Potential subjects undergoing one of the eligible surgeries will be approached by the investigator 
and/or the study staff for informed consent up to 30 days before the surgery. Subject may be consented on the day of the surgery, if the consent process is started early with ample time for the 
subject to review the ICF and have all the questions answered by the investigator/study s taff prior 
to providing informed consent.  
13.2.2. Screening  
Subjects may be screened up to 30 days prior to day of surgery but eligibility should be re -
confirmed on day of surgery. Screening procedures that are standard of care at the institution may 
be completed prior to written informed consent and documented within the 30- day time window. 
Any screening procedures that are not standard of care  must be completed after written informed 
consent is provided and prior to surgery.  
The following screening procedures should be performed after the ICF is signed :  
• Explain study purpose and procedures, including responsibilities regarding the e -diary  
• Assess eligibility  
• Record medical/surgical history  
o As a general guidance, relevant medical/surgical history within the last  5 years 
(including all ongoing history, regardless of start date) should be recorded in the 
electronic CRF ( eCRF ), with the exception of history that is relevant to the lower 
extremity surgery, in which case all years should be recorded.  
o If a site’s stand ard process includes detailed collection of all history (regardless of 
relevance/age), only the relevant items should be recorded in the eCRF as outlined above; an asterisk or similar indicator can be used in the source 
documentation to indicate the releva nt items that should be included in the eCRF 
for source data verification purposes.  
• Record prior and concomitant medications  
• Record demographics and baseline characteristics including Pain Catastrophizing Scale 
(PCS)  (see Appendix 5, Section  18.5).  
• Record subject height and weight for BMI calculation

 13.2.3. Baseline Procedures (Prior to Study Drug Administration)  
• On the day of surgery, before administration of the block, the subject must record 
responses to the following pain assessments :  
− Pain intensity scores on the NRS as “What was your worst  pain in the last 30 days?”  
− Pain intensity scores ( using the NRS) “What was your average pain in the last 
30 days?  
• Conduct urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential  
• Record changes to concomitant medications sin ce screening   
• Confirm eligibility and randomize subject  
• Record AEs / SAEs  and a ny treatment(s) for the events  
• Provide e -diary and instruct the subjects on duties and responsibilities for assessment 
completion  
• For Cohort 1 only:   
− Perform sensory function assessment  
− Perform motor function assessment  
− Obtain blood sample for PK assessment within  15 minutes before bloc k 
13.3. Nerve Block Procedure  
• Subjects may be lightly sedated with 1 to 2 mg of IV midazolam before the block 
procedure . 
• Administer study drug as combined sciatic (in popliteal fossa) and saphenous (in the 
adductor canal ) nerve blocks  using ultrasound 90 min (± 30 min) prior to surgery 
(unblinded staff only  with shielding of the subject’s vision of the study drug syringe ) 
• Record start and end times of study drug administration  
• Record concomitant medications  
• Record AEs/ SAEs and any treatment(s) for the events  
13.3.1. Procedures for Sciatic Nerve Block  
A: Placement of ultrasound probe:  
• Position the patient supine (with the leg placed on an elevated footrest) or lateral 
(operative side up). Place ultrasound probe in the popliteal fossa, 3 to 5 cm above the 
popliteal crease in the transverse orientation . 
• Identify the sciatic nerve where it splits into the peroneal and tibial nerves but still 
enclosed in the connective tissue sheath (paraneural sheath) . 
B: Insertion of needle into paraneural sheath:

EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  47 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 • Use a 100 mm, 21- gauge insulated needle  
• Needle approach is from the lateral side  
• The needle should be advanced in pla ne until the needle tip has pierced the sciatic 
nerve sheath (paraneural sheath), (i.e. , advance needle underneath the peroneal nerve, 
and pop through the sheath that surrounds the tibial and peroneal nerves) . 
C: Hydrodissection of sciatic nerve block:  
• Never advance the needle tip directly at either nerve, but rather use small aliquots of 
saline (1 -2 ml) to hydrodissect and outline the nerves . 
D: Study drug administration:  
• Switch syringes and i nject 20 mL of the study drug admixture in the sheath, between 
the two nerves . 
13.3.2. Procedures for Adductor Canal Nerve Block  
A: Placement of ultrasound probe:  
• With the patient in the supine position, place ultr asound transducer at the midpoint 
between the inguinal crease and the superior pole of the patella. The femoral artery 
should be visible directly beneath the sartorius muscle.  
• The saphenous nerve is frequently visible as a hyperechoic structure immediately  
lateral to the femoral artery . 
B: Insertion of needle into adductor canal:  
• From a lateral approach in plane using a 100 mm 21- gauge insulated needle, insert 
the needle until the tip is just lateral to the femoral artery and under the saphenous nerve . 
• The injection will occur immediately lateral to the femoral artery , below the sartorius 
muscle.  
C: Saline injection of adductor canal nerve block:  
• Slowly start the saline injection to visualize the saphenous nerve so as not to injure it. 
The goal is to confirm  needle tip position, and no more than 1- 2 mL of saline should 
be required.  
D: Study drug administration:  
• Switch syringes and s lowly start injecting the remaining 20 mL of study drug around 
the saphenous nerve as visualized during saline injection.  
13.4. Post-Block Assessments 
The following assessments will be conducted in Cohort 1 subjects only:  
• Assess sensory and motor function (onset and offset of block)

13.7.  Postsurgical  Assessments from End of Surgery through Discharge 
•  
• Record pain intensity scores (NRS) (see Appendix 1, Section  18.1)  measured as “How 
much pain are you experiencing right now?” from the end of surgery to 96 hours post -
surgery as follows:  
− Every 6 hours from the end of surgery to 96 hour post -surgery, i.e.,  
6 h (±2 h), 12 h  (±2 h), 18 h (±2 h), 24 h  (±2 h), 30 h (±2 h), 36 h (±2 h), 42 h (±2 h), 48 h (±2 h), 54 h (±2 h), 60 h (±2 h), 66 h (±2 h), 72 h (±2 h), 78 h (±3 h), 
84 h (±3 h), 90 h (±3 h), and 96 h (±3 h). 
− If a subject is asleep, the subject will not be awakened to assess pain. If the subject 
awakens within the assessment window, a pain score will be collected then.  
− Subjects will be instructed not to complete the NRS pain intensity score after any 
physical activity, including the motor block assessment. If that is no t possible, t o 
assess pain intensity at rest, the subject should rest quietly in a supine or seated 
position that does not exacerbate his or her postsurgical  pain for 5- 10 minutes 
before entering the pain score using the NRS . 
− An unscheduled NRS assessment will be obtained immediately prior to administration of any breakthrough pain medication until 96 hours post -surgery.  
• Record pain intensity scores (NRS) measured as “What was your worst pain in the last 
24 hours?” and “What was your average pain in the las t 24 hours?”  
− Once daily at 21:00 ( ±3 h) starting on  POD 1.  
• Subject  to record satisfaction with pain management using 1 question from the 
International Pain Outcome (IPO) questionnaire at 96 hours (± 3 h) post -surgery.

− Collect scheduled PK blood sample(s) .  
− Perform sensory and motor function assessment s. 
• Record AEs/ SAEs .  
• Record concomitant medications for treatment of AEs/ SAEs . 
To mitigate the risk from falls , subjects will be required  to be non- weight bearing for at least  
2 weeks post -surgery , unless the investigator determines a limited touch down or partial weight 
bearing for balance with a walker assist device is more appropriate to reduce the risk of fall.

and 96 h assessm ents, respectively.  
• Record date and time of health care facility discharge.  
• Re-instruct on duties and responsibilities with the e -diary  and for breakthrough 
medications.  
13.9. Postsurgical  Assessments from Discharge through POD 14   
• Record pain intensity score s (NRS) measured as “What was your worst pain in the last 
24 hours?” and “What was your average pain in the last 24 hours?” once daily at 21:00 (± 3 h) from the day after discharge (daily continuation from POD  1 to POD  14). 
13.10.  Unscheduled Visi ts 
• If a sensory or motor function deficit persists on POD  7 (168 h post -surgery ), the 
subject is to return for unscheduled visit(s) at the Investigator's discretion through 
POD 14 or until the sensory or motor function has returned to baseline, whichever 
occurs fi rst.  
• Record concomitant medications including all analgesic medication.  
• Record AEs/SAEs and  any treatment(s) for the events.

• Remind subject to complete and return the e -diary, if applicable , after POD  14 
assessment . 
• Ask the  subject about any new AE(s) and the resolution of any ongoing adverse 
event (s) since discharge. Record any adverse event information. 
• Ask the subject about any medication(s) taken , that were not reported in the e -diary , 
since discharge  from the health care facility . 
14. ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING  
Consistent with the current regulatory guidance provided by the US FDA CFR Part 312 and the ICH GCP, AEs and SAEs are defined in Section  14.1.1 and Section  14.1.2, respectively.  
The concepts of AEs and SAEs represent regulatory instruments used  to evaluate and monitor the 
safety of clinical study subjects. Therefore, these terms only apply in light of their regulatory definition. The term serious, in a regulatory sense, does not necessarily mean severe. The SAE concept is used primarily to ident ify, during the conduct of the study, those SAEs that may require 
expedited reporting to regulatory authorities.

CONFIDENTIAL  51 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 14.1. Adverse Events 
14.1.1. Definitions  
Definition of Adverse Event : Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug 
in humans, whether or  not considered drug related. An AE (also referred to as an adverse 
experience) can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a drug, without any judgment about 
causality. An AE can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off -label use in combination with another 
drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or dose, including an overdose.  
An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended change in a body structure or body function. Adverse events include any clinically significant deterioration of a subject’s medical status. The AE may involve any organ or system and can be represented by the new onset or deterioration of 
a disease, a syndrome, a symptom, a physi cal sign, as well as by findings and results of 
instrumental examinations and laboratory tests. Any medically relevant and untoward change after 
the subject signs the ICF, including frequency or pattern changes for a fluctuating condition (e.g., 
migraine) is considered an AE.  
An AE that occurs after the ICF is signed and before the start of the study drug administration is 
identified as a pretreatment AE (PTAE). An AE that occurs after the administration of the study 
treatment is considered a treatment- emergent adverse event ( TEAE) .  
Definition of Adverse Reaction : Any AE caused by a drug. Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event.  
Definition of Suspected Adverse R eaction : Any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the AE. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug. Suspected adverse 
reactio ns are a subset of all AEs for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the 
event.  
14.1.2. Recording Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to document all AEs (i.e., PTAEs and TEAEs) with an onset after the subject signs the ICF.  For the purpose of this study, all AEs that occur through 
POD 14 must be recorded regardless of whether or not they are considered related to study drug. 
Any AEs occurring  after POD 14 only need to be reported if considered related to study drug by 
investigator. Whenever feasible, AE terms must be documented as medical diagnoses (highest possible level of integration); otherwise, the AEs must be reported separately as individual signs or symptoms. Only one AE per line should be recorded in the AE CRF; for example, an AE of 
nausea and vomiting would be listed as two separate events: the event of nausea and the event of vomiting. If a diagnosis is established after symptoms are recorded on the AE CRF, the diagnosis must be recorded, and the symptoms collapsed (removed; i.e., lined through and initialed). 
Whenever possible, abnormal laboratory results must be reported as their clinical corollary (e.g., 
low potassium should be recorded as hypokalemia).

EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  52 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 A continuous AE with varying grades of severity must be recorded as one AE. The highest grade 
of severity experienced by that subject during the course of the continuous AE must be recorded.  
Any condition noted before the subject signs the ICF will be listed as Medical History and is 
considered a pre -existing condition. If a pre -existing condition changes (i.e., becomes more severe 
or more frequent) at any time after the ICF is signed, or after study drug administration, it is considered an AE. Note: A change in treatment for a pre -existing condition (e.g., new high blood 
pressure medication), does not necessarily indicate an AE.  
Information recorded on the AE CRF will include the AE term, the date and time of onset, severity, 
seriousness, relat ionship to study drug, action taken with subject due to AE, and the outcome of 
the AE, including the date and time of resolution, if applicable. 
14.1.3. Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of an AE must be categorized using the following guidelines:  
Mild :  An AE that is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with everyday activities.  
Moderate:  An AE that is discomforting and interferes with normal everyday activities.  
Severe:  An AE that prevents normal everyday ac tivities.  
The term "severe" is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific event (as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction); however, the event itself, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance (such as severe headache ). This is not the same as "serious," which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to a 
subject's life or functioning. Seriousness (not severity) serves as a guide for defining regulatory 
reporting obligations.  
14.1.4. Relationship of Adverse Events to Study Drug  
The Investigator must assess the relationship of the AE to study drug after careful medical 
consideration on a case -by-case basis. General guidelines are provided below.  
Unrelated : A causal r elationship between the study drug and the AE can be easily ruled out 
(e.g., based on the temporal sequence, absence of a reasonable pathophysiological mechanism, or direct evidence of actual cause).  
Unlikely : A clinical event with a temporal relationship to study drug administration which 
makes a causal relationship improbable and in which other drugs, chemicals, or underlying disease provide a plausible explanation;  
Possible : A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study 
drug but which could also be explained by a concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals;  
Probable : A clinical event with a reasonable time sequence to administration of the study 
drug unlikely to be attributed to a concurrent disease or other drugs or c hemicals 
and which follows a clinically reasonable response on withdrawal (dechallenge);

EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  53 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 Definite : The pharmacological properties of the study drug(s) or of the substance class, and 
the course of the AE after dechallenge and, if applicable, after rechallenge, and/or 
specific test indicate involvement of the study drug(s) in the occurrence/worsening of the AE, and no indication of other causes exists.  
14.1.5. Outcome of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will assess the outcome of the AE after careful medical consider ation, on a case -
by-case basis. General guidelines are provided below:  
Recovered/Resolved:  The event resolved and the subject recovered from the AE  
Recovered/Resolved 
with Sequelae:  The initial event resolved but has a continuing abnormal condition as a result of the AE  
Not Recovered/ Not Resolved:  At the time of last assessment, the event was ongoing, with an undetermined outcome. Note: ongoing AEs are not to be 
considered resolve d as a result of death  
Recovering/Resolving:  At the time of last assessment, the event was decreasing in frequency, severity, etc., and a resolution was expected  
Fatal:  The AE directly caused death  
Unknown:  There was an inability to access the sub ject or the subject’s 
records to determine the outcome (e.g., subject withdrew consent or was lost to follow -up)  
 
14.1.6. Action Taken with Subject Due to an Adverse Event  
The Investigator will provide any actions taken regarding the subject (e.g., treatment, di agnostic 
tests, laboratory tests, or therapy) for each reported AE.  
• None  
• Medication  
• Non-pharmaceutical therapy (The specific therapy used must be recorded in the CRF )  
• Discontinued from study  
• Other (The specific action taken must be recorded)  
14.1.7. Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Based on review of all peripheral nerve blocks, the following conditions will be considered to be 
adverse events of special interest upon review of the AEs:

CONFIDENTIAL  54 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 • Persistent tingling  
• Persistent numbness  
• Persistent weakness  
• Hypersensitivity  
• Seizures  
• Tremors  
• Dizziness  
• Hematoma formation  
• Cardiovascular depression  
• Dyspnea  
• Cardiovascular arrest  
• Altered sensorium  
• Visual disturbances  
• Local anesthetic systemic toxicity  
Investigators, study coordinators , and patient study as sessors will be trained on adverse event 
ascertainment in general, with a special focus directed to signs and symptoms that may represent 
evidence of systemic toxicity. All AEs of special interest will be managed per standard of care and 
should be reported to the medical monitor and recorded in the database.  
14.2. Serious Adverse Events  
14.2.1. Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
Definition of a SAE: An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Pacira, it results in any of the following o utcomes:  
• Death
1 
• A life -threatening AE2 
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization3 
• A persistent or significant incapacity4 
• Congenital anomaly/birth defect5 
• Medically significant6 
1Death : Any event resulting in a subject’s death must be reported as an SAE. However, death, in 
and of itself, is not an AE; it is an outcome. The cause of death is the AE. Therefore, the Investigator must make every effort to obtain and document the cause of de ath for all subjects who 
Pacira Pharmaceuticals , Inc.       402-C-333 
EXPAREL®  Clinical Study Protocol  
 
 
CONFIDENTIAL  55 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 die during the study. If, despite all efforts, the cause of death remains unknown, the AE must be 
documented as an “unspecified fatal event.”  
2Life-threatening:  An AE is considered life -threatening if, in the view of either the In vestigator 
or Pacira, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more severe form might have caused death.  
3Hospitalization: It should be noted that hospitalization, in and of itself, does not represent an 
SAE. It is the AE leading to the subject’s hospitalization that becomes “serious” when it requires inpatient care. Consequently, an SAE must not be reported in case of preplanned hospitalizations 
for a pre -existing condition that did not worsen during the study. However, any medical condition 
that delays a subject’s discharge from the hospital (i.e., prolonged hospitalization) or requires the 
subject to be readmitted must be reported as an SAE.  
4Persistent or significant incapacity:  A substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
5Congenital anomaly/birth defect : Report if you suspect that exposure to a medical product prior 
to conception or during pregnancy may have resulted in an adverse outcome in t he child.  
6Medically significant:  Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, 
or require hospitalization, may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the subject and may requi re medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition. Examples of such medically significant events 
include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or con vulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
14.2.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE or death that occurs at any time after the subject signs the ICF through P OD 14, whether 
or not related to EXPAREL, must be reported by the Investigator or designee to Pacira Drug Safety within 24 hours of discovery by either email (drugsafety@pacira.com) or fax (858- 408-3588). In 
addition, the Investigator or designee is encouraged to contact the Medical Monitor to discuss the case, as needed.  
Investigators should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event before 
notifying Pacira Drug Safety or designee of the SAE. The fax or email report must be followed by 
a full written summary using the SAE Form detailing relevant aspects of the SAE in question. Where applicable, information from relevant hospital records and autopsy reports must be obtained 
and all subject -identifying information redacted prior to forwarding to Pacira. In the  event of a 
fatal or life -threatening SAE, any required follow -up must be provided to Pacira Drug Safety or 
designee immediately. The Investigator will follow all SAEs until resolved or the condition stabilizes, and further follow -up is not warranted.  
If the Investigator is made aware of any SAEs after Postsurgical  Day 14, these must also be 
reported to Pacira Drug Safety or designee provided the SAE is considered related to EXPAREL. The site would then provide a completed SAE form within 1 business day and the event would be 
followed until resolution, or until adequate stabilization is met.

 15. STATISTICAL METHODS  
A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized  for this study  prior to database 
lock. Demographic and baseline characteristics wi ll be summarized descriptively by treatment 
group for all subjects who receive study drug. Efficacy and safety endpoint analyses will be 
described in the SAP.  
Efficacy data will be analyzed by randomized treatment group . Superiority of treatment with 
EXPAREL compared with bupivacaine HCl will be determined using analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) with treatment as main effect for the primary efficacy endpoint of AUC of the NRS 
pain intensity scores from 0 to 96 hours post -surgery . Additional factors such as site or surgery 
type may be included to adjust the model if deemed necessary. Other efficacy endpoints will be 
analyzed using ANOVA, logistic regression model, chi -square tests, and Kaplan -Meier and log-
rank tests, as appropriate.  
Safety and pharmacokinet ic endpoints will be summarized descriptively by actual treatment 
received . 
15.1. Study Hypothesis  
The primary null hypothesis is:  
H0: The AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from 0 to 96 hours post -surgery are not different 
between the EXPAREL and bupivacaine  HCl treatment group.  
The alternative hypothesis is:   
HA: The AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from 0 to 96 hours post -surgery  for the EXPAREL 
treatment group is less than that of the bupivacaine  HCl  treatment group.  
15.2. Study Endpoints  
The endpoints to be assessed in this study are listed in Section  12.2  (Efficacy Endpoints), 
Section  12.6  (PK Endpoints) and Section  12.4  (Safety Endpoints).  
15.3. Determination of Sample Size 
The sample size was calculated based on the primary efficacy endpoint of the AUC of the NRS 
pain intensity scores from 0 through 96 hours post -surgery  comparing EXPAREL to bupivacaine 
HCl.  
The sample size for Cohort 1 was based on the number of subjects neces sary to characterize the 
PK following administration.  
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 subjects will be combined within treatment groups  for the efficacy and 
safety analyses; therefore, the overall sample size was based on the primary efficacy endpoint of 
the AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from 0 through 96 hours post -surgery . Assuming a 
2-sided 0.05 alpha, common standard deviation (SD) of 170 a sample size of 40 subjects for 
EXPAREL and 40 subjects for bupivacaine HCl should have at least 90% power to detect a  true 
difference  of 150- units in the AUCs . Therefore, since Cohort 1 will have 60 subjects

CONFIDENTIAL  57 of 69  Amendment 1 06 Nov2020 
    
 (20 EXAPREL, 20 EXPAREL admixed with bupivacaine HCl and 20 bupivacaine HCl), Cohort 
2 will need to enroll 60 subjects (20 EXAPREL, 20 EXPAREL admixed with bupivacai ne HCl 
and 20 bupivacaine HCl) to meet the total requirements.  
An efficacy interim analysis will occur when approximately 60 subjects have enrolled and provided complete data for the primary efficacy outcome.  
15.4. Analysis Populations 
The following analysis se ts are planned:  
Safety : The safety analysis set will include all subjects who receive study drug. All analyses will 
be based on actual treatment received.  
Efficacy : The efficacy analysis set will include all randomized subjects who undergo the planned 
surgery. All analyses will be based on randomized treatment regardless of actual treatment 
received.  
Pharmacokinetic : The pharmacokinetic analysis set will include all subjects who receive study 
drug and who provide sufficient samples to allow for calculation of PK parameters required for analysis.  
Pharmacodynamic:  The pharmacodynamics analysis set will include all subjects who receive study 
drug and who provide sufficient data to allow for calculation of PD parameters required for analysis.  
15.5. Handling Subject Dr opouts and Discontinuations  
Methods for dealing with missing data for other endpoints will be described in the SAP.  
15.6. Statistical Analyses  
15.6.1. Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized by treatment group.  
15.6.2. Study Procedur e Compliance  
In each analysis set, the percentage and number of subjects who were screened and the percentage 
and number of subjects who failed to complete the study, including reasons for discontinuation, 
will be displayed by treatment group.  
15.6.3. Efficacy Ana lyses  
All efficacy analyses will be based on the efficacy analysis set and will be analyzed according to 
the randomized treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint will be additionally analyzed by 
stratifying by surgery on the efficacy analysis set as a sensi tivity analysis.  
For continuous measures of efficacy, summary statistics (n, mean, median, standard deviation, 
minimum, and maximum) will be shown by treatment group. For categorical measures of efficacy, 
number and percentage of subjects in each category will be shown by treatment group. For time to

 event measures of efficacy, medians and Kaplan -Meier estimates will be shown by treatment 
group. 
Baseline is defined as the last non -missing assessment of a given assessment prior to first dose of 
trial drug un less otherwise specified.  
All assessments will be presented in by -subject data listings.  
15.6.3.1. Primary Efficacy Measure 
The primary efficacy measure is the AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from 0 to 96 hours 
post-surgery .  
For the AUC of the NRS pain intensi ty scores from 0 to 96 hours post -surgery , EXPAREL  will be 
compared to bupivacaine HCl using ANOVA with treatment as a main effect. Additional 
covariates may be included. Based on the model, the difference between treatment groups will be 
estimated along with the 2- sided 95% confidence intervals. The stratified sensitivity analysis will 
report similar statistics.  
15.6.3.2. Secondary Efficacy Measures  
The secondary efficacy measures  are: 
• Total postsurgical opioid consumption in oral morphine equivalents (OMED) from 0  to 
96 hours post -surgery comparing EXPAREL to bupivacaine HCl  
• Time to first opioid consumption comparing EXPAREL to bupivacaine HCl  
• The AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from 0 to 96 hours post -surgery comparing 
EXPAREL to EXPA REL admixed with bupivacaine  HCl  
• The duration of the motor block EXPAREL to EXPAREL admixed with bupivacaine  
HCl 
For the total postsurgical opioid consumption endpoint, opioid medications will be converted to 
the oral morphine equivalents in mg amount. All  opioids administered from 0 hours to 96 hours 
post-surgery  will be included in the analysis. Prior to analysis, the natural logarithm transformation 
may be applied to the total amount. A minimal set value will be used for subjects that do not report 
opioi d use. To test for a significant difference between EXPAREL and bupivacaine HCl, an 
ANOVA with treatment as a main effect will be used. Additional covariates may be included. Based on the model, the difference between treatment groups will be estimated alo ng with the 2 -
sided 95% confidence intervals.  
The time to event endpoints will be summarized with medians and Kaplan- Meier estimates. A log -
rank test will be used to compare EXPAREL to bupivacaine HCl. Subjects that do not report any event will be censored  at their last valid assessment respective to the endpoint.  
For the endpoint AUC of the NRS pain intensity scores from 0 to 96 hours post -surgery , 
EXPAREL will be compared to EXPAREL admixed with bupivacaine  HCl.  
For the endpoint duration of the motor block , EXPAREL will be compared to EXPAREL admixed 
with bupivacaine  HCl .

 15.6.3.3. Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Pharmacokinetic parameters will be estimated from the PK analysis set, using plasma drug 
concentration -time profiles, where appropriate, by non- compartmental analysis.  
Actual sampling time will be used for all calculations of the PK parameters. If there is any doubt 
in the actual time a sample was taken, then the scheduled time will be used.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the PK parameters.  
15.6.4. Safety Analyses  
All safety analyses will be based on actual treatment received.  
15.6.4.1. Adverse Events  
Adverse event verbatim terms will be mapped to preferred terms and related system organ class 
using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Events that start prior to the 
start of study drug administration will be identified in a by -subject listings. Incidence rates of 
TEAEs and the proportion of subject prematurely withdrawn from the study due to a TEAE will 
be shown for each tr eatment group. Incidence rates will also be displayed for each treatment group 
for TEAEs by severity and separately by relationship. If severity of an AE is not reported, then for 
tables of AEs by severity, the event will be classified as ‘Severe’ and will  be footnoted for the 
table to indicate this imputation. If relationship to study drug is not reported for an AE, then for tables of study- drug related AEs, the event will be assigned the relationship of ‘definite’ . Incidence 
rates of SAEs will also be sho wn for each treatment group. All incidence rates will be categorized 
and displayed by system organ class and preferred term . 
15.7. Significance Testing 
All tests will be two -sided and based on a significance level of 0.05 unless otherwise specified . 
15.8. Interim Anal yses 
An unblinded efficacy interim analysis conducted by an independent committee will occur when approximately 60 subjects (20 in each arm) have been randomized, treated and provided their primary efficacy outcome. An interim analysis will be conducted to evaluate and compare the 
clinical efficacy between EXAPREL only and bupivacaine HCl only. Primary purpose of this 
interim analysis is to evaluate the sample size assumptions and evaluate futility. Full details on the planned or additional inte rim analysis will be covered in a prospective interim analysis plan.

 18. APPENDICES  
18.1. Appendix 1: Pain Intensity Scores using the Numeric Rating Scale 
(NRS)  
Pain intensity will be measured using the 11- point NRS. The subject will be asked to rate their 
worst or average pain on a scale of 0 (no pain) - 10 (worst possible pain) . Subjects will be instructed 
to focus all NRS pain intensity ratings on the operative ankle/foot , and not other locations where 
they may be experiencing pain.  
• Pain intensity using the NRS measured as “What was your worst p ain in the last 30 days?” 
and “What was your average pain in the last 30 days?” will be assessed at Baseline/Day of 
surgery  
• Pain intensity using the NRS measured as “How much pain are you experiencing right 
now?” ** will be assessed : 
− Upon arrival in the PA CU (±5 min)  
− Every 15 minutes in the PACU  (±5 min)  
− At PACU discharge  (±5 min)  
− Every 6 hours from the end of surgery until 96 hours post -surgery: 6 h (±2 h), 12 h (±2 
h), 18 h (±2 h), 24 h (±2 h), 30 h (±2 h), 36 h (±2 h), 42 h (±2 h), 48 h (±2 h), 54 h (±2 h), 60 h (±2 h), 66 h (±2 h), 72 h (±2 h), 78 h (±3 h), 84 h (±3 h), 90 h (±3 h), and 96 h (±3 h)  
− If a subject is asleep, the subject will not be awakened to assess pain. If the subject awakens within the assessment window, a pain score will be collect ed then 
− Subjects will be instructed not to complete the NRS pain intensity score after any 
physical activity, including the motor block assessment. If that is not possible, to assess pain intensity at rest, the subject should rest quietly in a supine or se ated position that 
does not exacerbate his or her postsurgical  pain for 5- 10 minutes before entering the 
pain score using the NRS . Subjects will also be required to provide unscheduled pain 
assessments prior to consumption of any breakthrough pain medicati on 
− An unscheduled NRS assessment will be obtained immediately prior to 
administration of any breakthrough pain medication until 96 hours post -surgery  
• Pain intensity using the NRS measured as “What was your worst pain in the last  
24 hours?” and “What was y our average pain in the last 24 hours?”  will be assessed:  
− Once daily at 21:00 (± 3 h) from POD  1 to POD 14

 18.3. Appendix 3: Motor  Function Test (Cohort 1 only) 
Motor function (onset and offset of motor block) will be assessed by active movement of the foot . 
This will be used to determine the duration of the motor blockade. 
• The motor function test will be performed at predose (up to 15 min before block), 
15 min (± 5 min), 30 min (±5 min), 45 min (±5 min), 1 h (±15 min), 2 h (±30 min), 8 h 
(±30 min), 12 h (±30 min), 24 h (±1 h), 30 h (±1 h), 48 h (±1 h), 60 h (±2 h), 72 h 
(±2 h), 84 h (±2 h), 96 h (±3 h), 120 h (±3 h), 144 h (±3 h), and 168 h (±3 h) from the 
end of t he block procedure s, or until full motor function has returned to the baseline 
(pre-block)  level in two consecutive evaluations.  Additional unscheduled assessments 
may be performed, particularly around the  surgery, if no onset of block is noted on the 
last scheduled assessment prior to surgery.  
Motor Function Test  
The motor function test procedures are as follows:  
• The subject will be supine and asked to flex and extend the  foot of the  study leg .   
• The level of foot movement will be noted as  either : 
• partial or no foot movement  
• complete foot movement

 18.4. Appendix 4: Light Touch Assessment and Cold Sensation 
Assessment  (Cohort 1 only)  
Sensory function  for light touch  will be assessed using a  wooden tongue depressor . Sensory 
function for cold sensation wi ll be assessed  using ice. The light touch assessment will be done 
first, followed by the cold sensation assessment .  
• The wooden tongue depressor light touch assessment and the cold sensation assessment  
will be performed at predose (up to 15 min before block), 15 min  (±5 min), 
30 min  (±5 min), 45 min  (±5 min), 1  h (±15  min), 2  h (±30 min), 8  h (±30  min), 
12 h (±30 min),  24 h (±1  h), 30 h (±1 h), 48 h (±1 h), 60 h (±2  h), 72 h (±2  h), 84 h (±2  h), 
96 h (±3 h), 120  h (±3 h), 144  h (±3 h), and 168  h (±3 h) from the end of the nerve block 
procedure s, or until full sensory function has returned to baseline (pre -block)  levels in two 
consecutive evaluations. Each light touch area of assessment  will be rated independently.  
Each cold sensation assessment wi ll be rated independently. Additional unscheduled 
assessments may be performed, particularly around the surgery , if no onset of block is 
noted on the last scheduled assessment prior to surgery. For each sensory assessment 
performed, all 4 locations below will be assessed for both light touch and cold (e.g., total 
of 8 independent ratings will be performed for each sensory assessment).  
Sensory function assessment will  include the following four locations:  
1. Saphenous proximal -  Medial aspect  of the lower  leg (3-4 cm below the  knee)   
2. Saphenous distal -  Medial aspect  of the lower leg  (3-4 cm above  ankle)  
3. Sciatic proximal - Lateral aspect of the lower leg  (3-4 cm above ankle)  
4. Sciatic distal -  Sole of the foot  
The intent of applying the tongue depressor or ice to the contralateral leg is to establish a reference 
sensation to compare to the test area. The subject is to determine if the sensation on the 
contralateral leg is the sa me as the test area (“Yes” = the same) or if there is a decreased sensation 
or not the same sensation (“NO” = not the same).  
Tongue D epressor Assessment  
The tongue depressor assessment procedures are as follows:  
• The subject should be instructed to close their eyes before the application of the wooden 
tongue depressor . 
• Instruct the subject you will be touching the subject on both legs and they will be 
asked if the touch sensation is the same (YES) or not the same (NO) when comparing 
each side.  
• For the subject’s reference, the end of the tongue depressor is dragged over the 
contralateral assessment area with consistent light touch.  
• The end of the tongue depressor is then dragged over the corresponding test assessment area with consistent light touch.

 • The subject will be asked if the touch sensation of the tongue depressor is  the same 
(YES) or not the same (NO) when compar ing each side .  
• Record the subject’s response (YES or NO) to the touch sensation in the assessment 
area.  
• Proceed to test the other three areas as above.  
Ice Assessment  
The ice assessment procedures are as follows:  
• The subject should be instructed to close their eyes before the application of the ice 
(place ice in a small plastic  bag to avoid any wet sensation) . 
• Instruct the subject you will be touching the subject on both legs and they will be asked 
if the cold sensatio n is the same (YES) or not the same (NO) when comparing each 
side. 
• For the subject’s reference, the ice is placed on the contralateral assessment area.  
• The ice is then placed  on the corresponding test assessment area.  
• The subject will be asked if the cold sensation  is the same (YES) or not the same (NO) 
when comparing each side .  
• Record the subject’s response (YES or NO) to the cold sensation in the assessment 
area.  
• Proceed to test the other three areas as above.

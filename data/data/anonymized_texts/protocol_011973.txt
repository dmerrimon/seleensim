    Trial Objectives (Continued): 
Exploratory Objectives: 
 To explore the effects of CUDC-907 on disease-associated biomarkers. 
 To explore the relationship be tween disease-associated biom arkers in plasma and tumor 
tissue.  Among biomarkers of interest , BCL2 and BCL6 protein expression and 
translocation status in part icular will be tested in tumor tissue, where possible. 
 To explore biomarkers of response for patient selection. 
 To explore the relationship be tween additional biomarkers and biomarker profiles that 
may influence biologic and c linical responses to CUDC-907. 
 To explore the ORR according to Lugano classification ( Cheson et al, 2014 ; Barrington 
et al, 2014 ). 
Study Design and Methods: 
This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter trial de signed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
CUDC-907 in subjects 18 years and older with RR MYC-altered DLBCL. 
Figure 1  depicts the study design.  Patients with RR DLBCL will be eligible  for treatment with 
CUDC-907 as long as they have tumor tissue available that can be tested for MYC-altered 
disease.  This is defined as MYC  translocation by FISH, or MYC expression in ≥ 40% of tumor 
cells by IHC staining, and/or MYC  gene copy number gain by FISH  based on central testing of 
one of the following: 
 Fresh tumor tissue obtained from biopsy accessible lesions with low estimated risk for 
serious complications (less than 2%), or  
 Archived tumor tissue (most recent available) 
Subjects will be required to s ubmit archival tumor samples (most recent available) or fresh 
tumor samples for central FISH and IHC testing.  Subjects whose tumors have been previously 
characterized as MYC-altered are strongly encouraged to enter the study.  For subjects who enter 
the study with unconfirmed MYC-altered diseas e, fresh tumor samples are preferred.  
All eligible subjects will receive the following treatment: 
 CUDC-907 60 mg (2 × 30 mg capsules) orally  (PO) for 5 days on/2 days off (5/2) 
(21-day cycles). 
Based on central testing and revi ew, subjects will be classified into one of the following 
categories:   
(1) Group A:  MYC  translocation+ by FISH,  
(2) Group B:  MYC expression in ≥ 40% of tumor cells by IHC and/or MYC  gene copy number 
gain by FISH, or  
(3) Group C:  MYC  translocation¯ by FISH, and MYC expr ession in < 40% of tumor cells, and 
no MYC  gene copy number gain by FISH.   
Subjects will be assigned to Gr oups A, B, or C according to their MYC status as described 
above.  Subjects who are both MYC  translocation+ by FISH and have MYC expression in ≥ 40% 
of tumor cells by IHC and/or MYC  gene copy number gain by FISH will be classified as MYC  
translocation+ and assigned to Group A.   
Enrollment may continue until the minimum number of subjects are enrolle d in Groups A and B.

    Study Design and Methods (Continued): 
Subjects in all groups will conti nue to receive treatment until they meet criteria for treatment 
discontinuation.  Efficacy evaluations will includ e restaging assessments, physical examination, 
review of lymphoma symptoms, survival status, and other pro cedures, as necessary.  Disease 
response by radiologic imaging will be assessed according to the Revised Response Criteria for 
Malignant Lymphoma ( Cheson et al, 2007 ).  The exploratory efficacy endpoint of ORR will be 
assessed according to Lu gano classification ( Cheson et al, 2014 ; Barrington et al, 2014 ). 
Efficacy assessments will be performed usi ng computed tomography/magnetic resonance 
imaging (CT/MRI) scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  
Skull base-to-mid thigh positron emission tom ography (PET) scan is recommended but not 
mandated. 
Contrast-enhanced MRI may be used to evaluate  sites of disease that cannot be adequately 
imaged using CT or if contrast-enhanced CT  scanning cannot be performed due to medical 
condition(s).  For each patient, the modality/modal ities utilized at scre ening will be followed 
throughout the patient’s time on study. While add itional modalities may be used depending on 
assessment needs and disease specifics, technolo gies used at screeni ng will continue to be 
followed at each restaging assessment to enable di rect comparison with the baseline assessment. 
Disease response will be assessed both by the lo cal Investigator and the independent review 
committee. 
Safety will be assessed by the incidence and severity of AEs as determined by National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adve rse Events (NCI CTCAE v4.03).  Additional 
safety parameters will include physical examinat ion and vital signs, as well as hematology and 
serum chemistry laboratory tests. 
Planned Number of Subjects:  Approximately 200 subjects w ill be enrolled in the study.  
Schedule of Visits and Assessments: 
During Treatment:  
Subjects will have 4 clinic vis its during Cycle 1 (Days 1, 5, 12, a nd 15) and clinic visits every 
3 weeks on Day 1 of every cycle thereafter.  For the first 50 subjects enrolled on amendment 4, 
there will also be a Cycle 1 Day 8 visit. Subjec ts who continue past Cycle 13 will have clinic 
visits every 6 weeks on Day 1 of every other cy cle (Cycles 14, 16, 18, etc.).  Safety assessments 
will be conducted at each clinic visit. Subjects will have efficacy assessments (CT/MR I) performed at the end of Cycles 2, 4, and 6 
(each ± 3 days).  If 
18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT is acquired at baseline, follow-up 
FDG-PET/CT imaging at Cycle 4 and at Cycle 10 is  required.  Scans will be sent for a central 
radiographic review. 
Subjects who continue to receive CUDC-907 after Cycle 6 will have disease response 
assessments (CT/MRI) performed every 12 w eeks ± 1 week (i.e., Cycles 10, 14, 18) until 
Cycle 18 in the first 12 months w ith scans collected through the fi rst year, then every 24 weeks ± 
2 weeks (i.e., Cycles 26, 34) until progressive disease (PD) or deat h, or up to 2 years, whichever 
occurs first.  After that, disease assessments may be performed as clinically  indicated (i.e., at the 
discretion of the Investigator  or per standard of care).

    Criteria for Evaluation: 
Efficacy: 
The Revised Response Criteria  for Malignant Lymphoma ( Cheson et al, 2007), will be used to 
evaluate all subjects  on active treatment. 
Primary efficacy endpoint:  ORR (central determination) 
Secondary efficacy endpoints:  
 ORR (local determination) 
 PFS, median PFS, and PFS6 (central and local determination) 
 OS 
 DCR and DOR (central and local determination) 
Exploratory efficacy endpoint: 
 ORR according to Lugano classification ( Cheson et al, 2014 ; Barrington et al, 2014 ) 
Safety: 
The incidence and severity of AE s, including treatment-related ev ents, events leading to death, 
SAEs, and events resulting in study treatment discontinuation.  Pharmacokinetics: 
Population PK of CUDC-907 will be evaluated in plasma samples based on prior established 
parameters.  
Biomarkers: 
Tumor, blood, and plasma samples will be evalua ted in all subjects to identify other markers 
potentially predictive of response to CUDC- 907.  Genomic material from tumor, blood and 
plasma samples will be assessed for aberrations  in genes associated with disease and/or 
treatment targeted pathways.  Gene expression profiling will be applie d to genomic material 
isolated from tumor tissue in part to determine cell of origin classificat ion.  In addition, protein 
analysis will be conducted on tumor and plasma sa mples to evaluate baseline levels and/or 
changes in biomarkers related to the disease and/or targeted pathways, if feasible.  BCL2 and 
BCL6 protein expression and tran slocation status are among the di sease-related biomarkers that 
will be tested in tumor tissue, if feasible.  
Statistical Considerations: 
Efficacy Endpoints: 
The primary efficacy endpoint is ORR as determ ined by the central determination of disease 
response.  Secondary endpoints in clude ORR as determined by the investigative site, and PFS, 
median PFS, PFS6, OS, DCR, and DOR as determ ined by both the central determination of 
disease response and investigator site.  An e xploratory efficacy endpoint  will assess ORR (CR, 
PR) according to Lugano classification ( Cheson et al, 2014 ; Barrington et al, 2014 ).

    Statistical Considera tions (Continued):  
Analysis Populations Evaluable for Safety and Efficacy: 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population will consist of all subjects assigned to Groups A and B.  
The primary analyses of efficacy will be conducted based on the ITT Population. 
The Evaluable Population will consist of all subjec ts in Groups A and B who receive at least one 
full cycle of treatment and have at least one pos t-baseline disease assess ment and have not had 
major protocol deviations that are thought to have materially im pacted efficacy outcomes. Major 
protocol deviations will be iden tified prior to database lock.  Secondary analyses of efficacy will 
also be conducted based on the Evaluable Population. In addition, the primary efficacy endpoint 
(ORR) will also be assessed using the Eval uable Population as a secondary analysis.  
The Safety Population will consist of all subjects who receive any study treatment.  All safety 
analyses will be conducted based on this population.  
Sample Size Determination:  
The sample size for Groups A and B was determined based on the following: With a sample size of 50 subjects in Groups A and B with an ORR of 30.0%, a two-sided 95% 
confidence interval employing the exact binomia l method will extend from 17.9% to 44.6%.  
This confidence bound (CB) about the observed ORR is thought to adequately characterize the 
disease response of these populat ions after receiving CUDC-907. 
Interim Analyses: 
 Interim analyses of efficacy using the Eval uable Population will be  performed after ORR 
has been determined in 25 evaluable subjects  for both Groups A and B, separately.  In 
both Groups A and B, the ORR using the local determination of disease response will be 
obtained.  If the lower bound of a single-side d 95% confidence inte rval using the exact 
binomial method is less than 10% (i.e., 5 responses or less out of 25 patients) in either group, enrollment in that group will not continue. 
Efficacy Analyses: 
The primary analyses of efficacy will be conduc ted based on the ITT Population and the interim 
analyses will be performed on the Evaluable Population.  However, secondary analyses will be performed on the ITT and Evaluable Populations.  The primary efficacy endpoint, ORR, will be based on the proportion of subjects with CR or PR using the central determination of disease 
response in both Groups A and B, separately.  The estimate will be accompanied by a two-sided 
exact binomial 95% CB.   
Progression-free survival, OS, and DOR will be summarized descriptively using the 
Kaplan-Meier method.  
Progression-free survival, median PFS, and PFS6 based on the Kaplan-Meier analyses will be 
reported.  For OS, the estimated rates at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months based on the Kaplan-Meier 
analyses will be reported.  For duration of obj ective response, the estimate of the median based 
on the Kaplan-Meier analyses will be reported.  Waterfall plots will be used to depict graphically 
the maximum decrease from baseline in the sum of the product diameters in measurable nodes 
and nodal masses.  Secondary analyses of efficacy will be conducted based on the Evaluable 
Population.  The estimate will be accompanied by a two-sided exact binomial 95% lower CB.

    Statistical Considera tions (Continued): 
Safety Analyses: 
The analyses of safety will be conducted base d on the Safety Population.  Safety will be 
assessed based on AEs, SAEs, laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG results.  Summary tables 
will be produced for all reported treatment-emerge nt adverse events (TEAEs) (AEs that start or 
worsen on or after the first administration of stud y treatment) tabulated by  the current version of 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activitie s (MedDRA) system organ class and preferred 
term.  Tabular summaries will be provided for: all TEAEs, TEAEs by relationship to study 
treatment, TEAEs by severity, TEAEs occasioni ng treatment modification, and serious TEAEs. 
Hematology and serum chemistries will be summarized using conventional summary statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, and range) fo r the following: baseline value, minimum and 
maximum post-baseline values, average post-baseline value, and last post-baseline value.  Standard shift tables will also  be prepared presenting worst po st-baseline toxicity grade vs. 
baseline.  Vital signs and ECG results will be summarized in a descriptive manner by calculating 
the mean, standard deviation, median, and range by time point in the same manner described for 
laboratory values.  
Pharmacokinetic Analyses: 
Population PK analysis will be conducted to fu rther understand the PK profile of CUDC-907 in 
patients with RR MYC-altered DLBCL.  Preliminary PK information has been collected during Phase 1, and the basic PK models of the drug have been established.  In this study, blood samples will be obtained at 2 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1, and on Day 1 of 
every other cycle thereafter (i.e., Day 1 of Cycl es 6, 8, 10 etc.).  In addition, for the first 50 
subjects enrolled on amendment 4, blood sample s will also be obtained 2 hours post-dose on 
Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1.

DLBCL = diffuse large B-cell lymphoma; RR = relapsed and/or refractory  
1Subjects with RR DLBCL who have had at least 2 but no more than 4 prior lines of therapy for DLBCL will receive CUDC-907.  Tumor samples from all 
subjects will be tested centrally to obtain  full tumor MYC profile.  Upon central re view of MYC status, subjects will be a ssigned to Groups A, B or C.  Subjects 
who qualify for both Groups A and B will be classified as MYC  translocation+ and assigned to Group A.  
2Subjects who do not meet criteria for Groups  A or B based on central laboratory testin g and review will be assigned to Group C.

Footnotes: 
1. The window for all treatment assessments/procedures is ± 2 days.  If ex tenuating circumstances prevent a 
subject from starting or completing treatment, or a scheduled procedure or assessment within the protocol-specified time, the subject may continue to be treated on the study only with permission of the Curis Medical Monitor or designee clinician. 
2. Physical exam, performance status, weight, CBC w/ differentials and serum chemistry labs may be 
performed up to 3 days prior to Day 1 of each cycle.   Subjects who continue past Cycle 13 will only be 
required to have a Day 1 visit at the beginning of ever y other cycle (14, 16, 18, etc.).  The Cycle 1, Day 1 
physical examination is not required if the screening physical examination was conducted within 3 days 
prior to administration of the first dose of study drug (Cycle 1, Day 1). 
3. Subjects will be required to submit archival tissue samp les (most recent available) or fresh tumor samples 
for central FISH and IHC testing.  For subjects with unconfirmed MYC-altered disease, fresh tumor 
samples (obtained from biopsy-accessible lesions with less than 2% estimated risk for serious 
complications) are preferred. 
4. Performed until time of disease progression, withdrawal of consent, or any other criteria that would make 
the subject unable to be fo llowed for disease response. 
5. Vital signs include blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, and weight. 
6. A serum or urine pregnancy test will be performed for women of childbearing potential at least once per cycle prior to dosing, or more frequently as clinically  indicated, as well as during Screening and at the EOT 
visit. 
7. Lymphoma assessment consists of physical examination, a review of the subject’s current signs and 
symptoms, B symptoms, and concomitant medications. 
8. Lymphoma and radiologic assessments to be done only if not performed within 4 weeks of the EOT visit. 
9. Up to Cycle 6, radiologic assessments using CT/MRI scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis are 
required during the last week (Day 15 -21 ) of Cycle 2, Cycle 4, and Cycle 6 (each ± 3 days).  After Cycle 
6, radiologic assessments (CT/MRI) are required every 12 weeks (± 1 week) (i.e., Cycles 10, 14, 18) until 
Cycle 18, and then every 24 weeks ± 2 weeks (i.e., Cy cles 26, 34) until PD or death, or up to 2 years, 
whichever occurs first.  After that, disease assessments may be performed as clinica lly indicated (i.e., at the 
discretion of the Investigator or per standard of care).  Contrast-enhanced MRI may be used to evaluate sites of disease that cannot be adequately imaged using CT or if contrast-enhanced CT scanning cannot be performed due to medical condition(s).  For each subject, the moda lity/modalities utilized at screening will 
be followed throughout the subject’s time on study. Tissue for biomarker

    10. Skull base-to-mid thigh PET scan is recommended bu t not mandated.  If FDG-PET/CT is acquired at 
baseline, follow-up FDG-PET imaging at Cycle 4 and at Cycle 10 is requi red.  5-PS score of 1 and 2 are 
considered PET-negative; 5-PS score of 3,  4, or 5 are considered PET-positive. 
11. All subjects will have PFS and survival assessments every 12 weeks during the first 6 months, then every 24 weeks until PD or death, or up to 2 years, whiche ver occurs first.  After that, disease assessments may 
be performed as clinically indicated (i.e., at the disc retion of the Investigator or per standard of care).  
Overall survival may be checked by phone every 3 months and data entered in the eCRF. 
12. Sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphate, total protein, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, BUN, creatinine, uric acid, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, AST, ALT, LDH, albumin, and glucose. 
13. Plasma for PK sampling will be drawn at 2 hours post-do se on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1, and on Day 1 
of every other cycle thereafter (i.e., Day 1 of  Cycles 6, 8, 10, et c.) for all subjects. 
14. Optional tumor biopsies ( from subjects with accessible tumor lesi on) for biomarker sampling should be 
obtained any time during screening up to pre-dose Cycle 1, Day 1 and within 8 hours post-dose on any dosing day from Cycle 1, Day 15 through Cycle 2, Day 1.

    6. INTRODUCTION:  BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND SCIENTIFIC RATIONALE 
CUDC-907 is a first-in-class, rationally-designed small molecule that dually inhibits histone 
deacetylase (HDAC) (class I and II) and phosphati dylinositol 3-kinase  (PI3K) (class I α, β, and 
δ) enzymes (Qian et al, 2012 ).  This unique combination suppre sses multiple signaling pathways 
critical for cell proliferation, survival, and migration by targeting oncogenic gene expression and 
protein activities critical for cancer growth and potentially mitigating the emergence of acquired 
drug resistance.  CUDC-907 has been shown to inhibit activation of PI 3K/protein kinase B 
(AKT), Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT), and 
mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathways in both solid tumor and hematologic cancer cell lines.  The anti-tumor growth and pro-apoptotic activity of CUDC-907 
has also been shown to be more potent than  single-target HDAC or PI3K inhibitors, as 
demonstrated in a variety of cultured and impl anted cancer cell lines re presenting B- and T-cell 
lymphomas, as well as other hematologic malignancies. 
6.1.1. Relapsed/Refractory MYC-Altered Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma 
6.1.1.1. Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma 
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), a bi ologically aggressive type of non-Hodgkin 
lymphoma (NHL) that arises from B cells, is the most common form of NHL in the United States 
(U.S.) and Europe.  DLBCL meets requirements for orphan disease status in the U.S. and 
Europe, with a prevalence of less than 200,000 persons  in the U.S. and fewer than 5 persons per 
10,000, respectively ( Howlader et al, 2014 ; Bray et al, 2013 ).  The U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) granted CUDC-907 orphan drug status for this disease on April 2, 2015. 
DLBCL is a heterogeneous disease.  While subtypes differ in prognosis and response to treatment, the disease is rapidly fatal if untr eated.  Clinically, patients with DLBCL usually 
present with advanced and often extranodal disease.  DLBCL can be primary (arising de novo) or 
secondary (representing progressi on or transformation of a less a ggressive lymphoma, such as 
follicular lymphoma).  Since approval of rituxi mab for the treatment of DLBCL, this agent has 
become an integral part of various cytotoxic standards of care, including R-CHOP (rituximab, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone).  While R-CHOP is commonly 
used in 1
st line treatment, a considerable proportion of  patients with advanced stage disease and 
certain adverse clinical risk f actors are not cured with this or other standard therapies ( Friedberg 
and Fisher, 2008 ).  Approximately 40% of patients have  refractory disease or disease that 
relapses after initial response a nd most patients with relapsed DLBCL ultimately succumb to the 
disease (Sehn, 2012).  Based on systematic review of the literature focused on interventions for 
relapsed and/or refractory (RR) DLBCL, medi an progression-free survival (PFS) ranges from 
1 - 10 months and median overall survival (OS) ranges from 4 to 13 months ( Colosia et al, 
2014). 
The prognosis for subjects with DLBCL has long been considered to be dependent on risk 
factors such as those measured by the International Prognostic Index (IPI).  The IPI assigns 
patients to 1 of 4 risk category groups on the basis of 4 factors (i.e., age > 60, stage III or IV 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 29  
    disease, elevated lactate dehydroge nase (LDH), and more than 1 extranodal site of disease) that 
correlate with 5 year OS ranging from 23% to 75% (Gandhi, 2014 ).  Since the IPI does not 
provide information to guide the choice of ther apy, additional risk biomarkers – particularly 
those that might serve as targets for effective interventions – might bette r characterize subjects’ 
lymphoma subtypes and the interventions most likely to benefit them. 
Gene expression profiling (GEP) studies enable consideration of the molecular subtype of 
DLBCL and provide opportunities to  identify subjects with partic ularly aggressive lymphomas 
that might benefit from a novel th erapeutic agent.  Such studies have shown that DLBCL could 
be segregated into 2 distinct subgroups based on cell of origin (COO) referred to as germinal 
center B-cell (GCB) and the activated B-cell-li ke (ABC) subtypes.  The ABC DLBCL subtype 
has been associated with a more aggressive course a nd poorer prognosis ( Carbone et al, 2014) as 
well as lower likelihood of response to  R-CHOP used in the setting of de novo disease ( Scott et 
al, 2015). Subjects with RR DLBCL of  ABC subtype were also less likely to respond to a 
commonly used salvage regimen, R-DHAP (rituxima b, dexamethasone, cytarabine, and cisplatin 
(Thieblemont et al, 2011 ). 
It has become apparent that the COO paradigm only accounts for a portion of  the clinical picture 
in regards to prognosis for DLBCL subjects.  Th e adverse prognostic impact of rearrangement of 
the MYC  oncogene has been well documented for over a decade, both pre- a nd post- the advent 
of rituximab ( Savage et al, 2009 ).  More recently, overexpression of the MYC protein has also 
been associated with inferior survival ( Horn et al, 2013 ). 
As will be discussed, subjects with MYC-altere d DLBCL have much shorter survival (median 
OS of < 2 years) than subjects without MYC alterations, and th e survival for subjects with RR 
MYC-altered DLBCL is usually measured in months.  For these subjects, there is no 
evidence-based standard of care.  Novel therapeu tic approaches are needed, rather than simply 
intensifying cytotoxic therapy. 
6.1.1.2. MYC Rearrangement in DLBCL 
The significance of MYC in DLBCL has been well studied and the prepondera nce of studies (all 
retrospective) has shown that MY C-altered disease, defined as MYC  translocation by 
fluorescence in-situ  hybridization (FISH) and/or  MYC protein overexpression by 
immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and/or ge ne copy number gain by FISH, independently 
confers a negative prognosis as reflected by PFS and OS.  In a meta-analysis of 24 studies, 
18 studies showed that the presence of MYC aberra tions was associated with shorter survival in 
DLBCL ( Zhou et al, 2014 ). 
The detection rate for MYC rearrangement varies from 5% to 17% of de novo DLBCL cases 
evaluated (note: some studies have  distinguished rearrangement of MYC  alone from double hit 
[
DH]/triple hit [TH] status) (Zhou et al, 2014 ).  A higher proportion of MYC rearrangements (up 
to 69%) are of the GCB (as opposed to ABC) subtype ( Tzankov et al, 2014 ; Gupta et al, 2012 ; 
Zhou et al, 2014 ).  Cases with MYC  translocation usually, but not invariably, show MYC protein 
overexpression ( Kluk et al, 2012 ; Tzankov et al, 2014 ; Horn et al, 2013 ; Valera et al, 2013). 
There is evidence that MYC -only rearrangement is independently predictive of poor prognosis 
(Barrans et al, 2010 ; Klapper et al, 2008 ; Savage et al, 2009 ; Akyurek et al, 2012 ; Valera et al, 
2013), particularly when the tumor al so overexpresses the MYC protein ( Tzankov et al, 2014 ; 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 30  
    Kluk et al, 2012) and when the tumor is of the GCB subtype ( Akyurek et al, 2012 ; Visco et al, 
2013).  These data suggest that FISH testing for MYC  rearrangement should be performed for all 
patients with DLBCL ( Savage et al, 2009 ).  Patients with MYC rearrangements in de novo 
DLBCL have been shown to have shorter OS as compared to those with MYC -negative de novo 
DLBCL (median OS: 7 vs 16 months).  Despite standard therapies, outcomes are similarly poor 
in patients with MYC  alone as well as those DH disease defi ned by concurrent rearrangements of 
MYC/BCL2  or MYC/BCL6  (Macpherson et al, 1999 ; Li et al, 2016 ). 
This discussion has thus far centered on the implica tions of MYC-altered status for patients with 
de novo DLBCL.  In the setting of RR DLBCL in ge neral, there are diminishing prospects for 
disease control (median OS of  4 to 13 months).  The prognosis for patients with RR 
MYC-altered DLBCL is even more discouraging.  The outcome of patients with DH disease who don’t respond to induction or progress after initial res ponse is very poor, with reported 12-month 
post-progression survival of 20% ( Oki et al, 2014 ), and median post-progression OS of 
17 months following salvage therapy ( Petrich et al, 2014 ).  Retrospective an alysis of the CORAL 
trial ( Gisselbrecht et al, 2011 ) was performed to identify th e prognostic significance of MYC 
aberrations in patients with RR DLBCL treated with chemotherapy followed by autologous stem 
cell transplantation (SCT).   Four-year OS was 29% in 27 patients who were MYC + versus 62% 
for those with no MYC aberration (21 of thes e cases were also identified as DH) (Cuccuini et al, 
2012). 
Analysis of outcomes makes it clear that trad itional approaches to relapsed DLBCL are not 
effective in MYC-altered DLBCL.  It is r ecommended that patients with MYC-altered B-cell 
lymphomas in need of further therapy be enrolled into prospective investigational protocols 
evaluating novel agents with either sound preclin ical rationale or demonstrated activity in 
MYC-driven lymphomas ( Cheah et al, 2015 ). 
6.1.1.3. MYC Protein Expression in DLBCL 
Recent advances in IHC, notably the commercia l development of an anti-MYC antibody, allow 
quick and accurate detection of MYC protein le vels.  MYC and BCL2 expression levels are now 
recognized to represent a more direct measure of the activity of the genes involved, and overexpression of these proteins has been show n to independently confer a very negative 
prognosis. 
Overexpression of MYC protein occurs in appr oximately one-third of DLBCL cases, of which 
one-third can be explained by a MYC  translocation ( Johnson et al, 2012 ).  It is expressed in both 
GCB and ABC subtypes, suggesti ng a biologic pathway independe nt of COO.  Results of a 
meta-analysis suggest that both event-free surviv al (EFS) and OS are inferior in DLBCL with 
MYC overexpression ( Zhou et al, 2014; Gupta et al, 2012 ; Kluk et al, 2012 ; Perry et al, 2014; 
Johnson et al, 2012
). 
It is even clearer that conc urrent overexpression of MYC and BLCL2 is an indicator of poor 
prognosis.  Co-expression of MYC and BCL2 proteins is more common in DLBCL cases of the 
ABC subtype (> 40%) than with the GCB subtype (< 20%), has an  adverse impact on survival 
and may be a driver of the generally inferior  prognosis for patients with the ABC subtype ( Hu et 
al, 2013).  Concurrent MYC/BCL2 expression is a ssociated with a lower complete response 
(CR) rate, shorter OS, and shorter PFS (Green et al, 2012).  Median PFS for patients with 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 31  
    MYC/BCL2 expression was reported as 8 months, and median OS ranged from 12 to 18 months 
(Green et al, 2012 ; Oki et al, 2014 ). 
Dual positivity for MYC/BCL2 protein in IH C among RR aggressive B-cell lymphomas was 
more common than in the frontline ( Miura et al, 2015 ).  In a study of patients with RR DLBCL, 
high grade follicular lymphoma (FL), or t-FL /DLBCL, 17/38 patients (45%) overexpressed both 
MYC and BCL2 proteins.  These patients had a lo wer response rate and shorter median PFS and 
OS, and fewer opportunities to receive consolid ative therapies (HDT or SCT) following 
achievement of remission (Miura et al, 2015 ). 
6.1.2. Rationale for Development of CUDC-907 for the Treatment of MYC-Altered 
DLBCL 
MYC family genes are among the most frequently deregulated oncogenic drivers in human 
cancers.  MYC genes encode non-catalytic transcri ptional regulators that have thus far proven 
undruggable; therefore, targeting upstream MYC regulators may be an effective strategy to 
suppress MYC and treat MYC-addicted tumors. 
Pharmacologic inhibition of HDAC activity and blockade of the PI3K pathway have both been 
shown to suppress MYC-induced on cogenic transcriptional programs.   HDAC activity is critical 
for MYC gene regulation, as MYC represses the transcription of a subset of its target genes 
through the recruitm ent of HDACs ( Kurland et al, 2008 ; Zhang et al, 2012 ).  HDAC inhibitors 
restore the expression of genes coordinately  suppressed by MYC family members and HDACs 
and induce rapid and sustained downregulation of expression of MYC itself ( Kurland et al, 2008 ; 
Zhang et al, 2012; Polack et al, 1987 ; Chambers et al, 2003 ; Gui et al, 2004 ; Liu et al, 2007 ).  
HDAC inhibitors also downregulat e expression of other oncogenes that cooperate with MYC to 
induce tumorigenesis, such as BCL2 ( Duan et al, 2005 ).  The PI3K pathway plays a central role 
in regulating MYC  homologs at the post-transcriptional level.  Activation of PI3K signaling 
either through mutational activ ation of PI3K or through loss of the phosphatase and tensin 
(PTEN) tumor suppressor leads to  activation of the effector kinase AKT, which in turns 
phosphorylates and inhibits GSK3  (Cross et al, 1995).  As GSK3  normally phosphorylates 
MYC and its homologs, which facilitates their recognition by E3 ubiquitin ligases and 
subsequent ubiquitination and pr oteasomal degradation, activati on of PI3K signaling leads to 
increased MYC family protein st ability, whereas PI3K inhibitors  decrease MYC family protein 
stability ( Kenney et al, 2004 ; Asano et al, 2004 ; Kumar et al, 2006 ; Bechard and Dalton, 2009 ).  
A recent study showing that PTEN-deficient DL BCL cell lines are addicted to MYC signaling 
and hypersensitiv
e to PI3K inhibition ( Pfeifer et al, 2013 ) provides evidence that MYC-driven 
cancers may be particularly se nsitive to PI3K  inhibition. 
As HDACs and PI3K regulate MYC expr ession through non-overlapping mechanisms, 
simultaneous HDAC and PI3K inhibition ma y lead to enhanced MYC suppression. 
CUDC-907 is an orally bioavailable small- molecule dual HDAC and PI3K inhibitor that 
primarily inhibits class I and IIB HDACs and the PI3K , , and   isoforms ( Qian et al, 2012 ).  
CUDC-907 shows greater in vitro and in vivo  antitumor activity than single-target HDAC or 
PI3K inhibitors ( Qian et al, 2012 ), especially in MYC-altered DLBCL models.  In preliminary 
preclinical testing of CUDC-907 in MYC-de pendent DLBCL and NUT midline carcinoma cell 
lines, CUDC-907 treatment leads to a dose-depende nt decrease in MYC protein expression, as 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 32  
    well as the inhibition of other critical oncoge nic pathways such as the MAPK and STAT 
pathways.  CUDC-907 is also a mo re potent inhibitor of MYC expre ssion in these cell lines than 
the HDAC inhibitor, panobinostat (LBH-589), and the pan-PI3K inhibitor, pictilisib 
(GDC-0941), either alone or in combination.  These findings raise the pos sibility that cancers 
driven by aberrant overexpression of MYC fa mily genes would be more responsive to 
simultaneous HDAC and PI3K inhibition with CUDC-907 than single -target therapies. 
6.1.3. Clinical Rationale for CUDC-907 Use in RR MYC-Altered DLBCL 
The utility of HDAC and PI3K inhibitors for the treatment of hematological malignancies has 
been recognized by the U.S. FDA, which has a pproved 4 HDAC inhibitors and 1 PI3K inhibitor 
for various hematological cancer indications. 
The therapeutic potential of CUDC-907 is shown by safety and efficacy data from the completed 
dose escalation and ongoing expansion stag es of ongoing study CUDC-907-101, the 
first-in-human (FIH) trial.  CUDC-907-101 is a Phase 1, open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CUDC-907 as a singl e agent administered orally to 
subjects with RR lymphoma or multiple myel oma (MM).  In the completed dose-escalation 
phase of CUDC-907-101, subjects received CUDC -907 capsules orally, within 30 minutes of 
meals, in 21-day cycles according to one of three dosing schedules: once daily (QD), intermittent twice (BIW) or thrice weekly (TIW), and five da ys on/two days off (5/2).  Objective responses, 
in some cases of extended duration, were achieved with CUDC-907 monotherapy on all 
schedules tested.  On the basis of improved to lerability and comparab le efficacy, CUDC-907 
administered at 60 mg on the 5/2 schedule was determined to be the recommended Phase 2 dose 
(RP2D). 
CUDC-907 monotherapy has demonstrated a manageable side effect profile and achieved 
objective responses (ORs) as well as sustained dis ease control, particularly  in the setting of RR 
DLBCL.  The most common treatment-related AEs of any grade have been diarrhea, fatigue, 
thrombocytopenia, and nausea.  No dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed on the 60 mg 5/2 schedule. 
As of the 15 March 2016 data cut-off, among 21 response-evaluable s ubjects with RR DLBCL 
receiving CUDC-907 monotherapy at the 60 mg 5/2 schedule (n = 18), or in combination with 
rituximab (n = 3), 9 (43%) achieved objective responses (3 CRs and 6 partial responses [PRs]); 
lasting a median of 2.6 months (range: < 1-14+) .  Among the 5 response-evaluable subjects with 
MYC-altered DLBCL, 4 (80%) achieved objective re sponses (3 CRs and 1 PR).  Three of these 
response-evaluable subjects were found to overexpress MYC ( ≥ 40%) and BCL2 ( ≥ 70%) by 
IHC, meeting criteria applied to “double-expr essor” (DE) DLBCL.  Two of the DE subjects 
attained objective responses: 1 CR (followed by autologous stem cell transplant) and 1 PR 
(lasting 4 months).  The third subject ha s experienced lengthy disease stabilization 
(5.7+ months).  All 3 CRs observed on this study occurred in subjects with MYC  gene copy 
number gain, including the subject who also had DE DLBCL.  Durable clinical benefit in 
subjects with RR MYC-altered DLBCL in FIH testing further supports this Phase 2 study of 
CUDC-907.

    6.2. Justification of Study Design Considerations  
The following is a brief summary of  key study design considerations: 
 Study subjects will be ≥  18 years of age with histopat hologically confirmed diagnosis 
of RR DLBCL (including t-FL/DLBCL) who ha ve received at least 2 but no more 
than 4 prior lines of treatment for DLBCL , and ineligible for (or failed) autologous or 
allogeneic SCT. 
 Subjects will receive CUDC-907 60 mg admi nistered orally on a 5/2 schedule until 
progression of disease or other criteria for discontinuation of treatment.  Each cycle will consist of 21 days. 
6.3. Potential Risk and Benefits 
Based on available preclinical and clinical sa fety and response data emerging from the ongoing 
CUDC-907-101 and CUDC-907-102 trials, ongoing clin ical testing of CUDC-907 is considered 
justified using the dose and dosage regimen prel iminarily shown to be reasonably safe and 
tolerable (Sections 6.1.2, Error! Reference source not found.  and 6.1.3). 
6.3.1. Potential Risks 
In CUDC-907-101, low grade (Grade 1 and 2) di arrhea, fatigue, and nausea were the most 
common drug-related adverse events  (AEs) reported in the study.  A total of 4 DLTs consisting 
of diarrhea and hyperglycemia o ccurred in 3 subjects treated at the highest doses on the QD 
(60 mg) and intermittent schedules (150 mg BIW and 150 mg TIW).  Other drug-related Grade 3 
or 4 AEs reported in 2 or more subjects included thrombocytopenia and neutropenia 
(hematologic AEs) as well as di arrhea, hyperglycemia, and fatigue (non-hematologic AEs).  As a 
result, stringent monitoring of blood counts will be performed. 
The planned CUDC-907 dose level, 60 mg 5/2, wa s reasonably tolerated in the dose-escalation 
phase of CUDC-907-101 and is currently undergoing further examination in the expansion phase 
of the trial in subjects with RR DLBCL. 
6.3.2. Potential Benefits 
Preliminary antitumor efficacy data fr om CUDC-907-101 evaluating CUDC-907 as 
monotherapy in subjects with RR DLBCL, including subjects with DE disease, have been 
promising.   
6.4. Good Clinical Practice Statement 
The study will be conducted in accordance with ethica l principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and are consistent with Interna tional Conference on Harmonisation, 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guide lines, applicable regulatory re quirements, and Curis policies.

    8. STUDY DESIGN 
8.1. Overall Study Design 
This is a Phase 2, open-label, multicenter trial de signed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
CUDC-907 in subjects 18 years and older with RR MYC-altered DLBCL. 
Figure 1  depicts the study design.  Patients with RR DLBCL will be eligible  for treatment with 
CUDC-907 as long as they have tumor tissue available that can be tested for MYC-altered 
disease.  This is defined as MYC  translocation by FISH, or MYC expression in ≥ 40% of tumor 
cells by IHC staining, and/or MYC  gene copy number gain by FISH based on central testing of 
one of the following: 
 Fresh tumor tissue obtained from biopsy accessible lesions with low estimated risk for serious complications (less than 2%), or  
 Archived tumor tissue (most recent available) 
Subjects will be required to subm it archival tumor samples (most recent available) or fresh tumor 
samples for central FISH and IHC testing.  Su bjects whose tumors have been previously 
characterized as MYC-altered are strongly encouraged to enter the study.  For subjects who enter 
the study with unconfirmed MYC-altered diseas e, fresh tumor samples are preferred.  
All eligible subjects will receive the following treatment: 
 CUDC-907 60 mg (2 × 30 mg capsules) orally  (PO) for 5 days on/2 days off (5/2) 
(21-day cycles). 
Based on central testing and revi ew, subjects will be classified into one of the following 
categories:   
(1) Group A:  MYC  translocation
+ by FISH,  
(2) Group B:  MYC expression in ≥ 40% of tumor cells by IHC and/or MYC  gene copy number 
gain by FISH, or  
(3) Group C:  MYC  translocation¯ by FISH, and MYC expr ession in < 40% of tumor cells, and 
no MYC  gene copy number gain by FISH.   
Subjects will be assigned to Gr oups A, B, or C according to their MYC status as described 
above.  Subjects who are both MYC  translocation+ by FISH and have MYC expression in ≥ 40% 
of tumor cells by IHC and/or MYC  gene copy number gain by FISH will be classified as MYC  
translocation+ and assigned to Group A. Enrollment ma y continue until the minimum number of 
subjects are enrolled in Groups A and B. 
Subjects in all groups will conti nue to receive treatment until they meet criteria for treatment 
discontinuation. 
Efficacy evaluations will include restaging assessments, physical examination, review of 
lymphoma symptoms, survival status, and other procedures, as necessar y.  Disease response by 
radiologic imaging will be assessed according to  the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant 
Lymphoma ( Cheson et al, 2007 ).  The exploratory efficacy endpoint of ORR will be assessed 
according to Lugano classification ( Cheson et al, 2014; Barrington et al, 2014 ).

imaging (CT/MRI) scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. 
Skull base-to-mid thigh PET scan is recommen ded but not mandated.  Contrast-enhanced MRI 
may be used to evaluate sites of disease that cannot be adequately imaged using CT or if 
contrast-enhanced CT scanning cannot be performed due to medical condition(s).  For each 
subject, the modality/modalities ut ilized at screening will be followed throughout the subject’s 
time on study.  While additional modalities may be used depending on assessment needs and 
disease specifics, technologies used at screeni ng will continue to be followed at each restaging 
assessment to enable direct comparison with the baseline assessment. 
Subjects will have efficacy assessments (CT/MR I) performed at the end of Cycles 2, 4, and 6 
(each ± 3 days).  If FDG-PET/CT is acquired at baseline, follow-up FDG-PET/CT imaging at 
Cycle 4 and at Cycle 10 is required.  Scans will be sent for a central radiographic review.  
Subjects who continue to receive CUDC-907 af ter Cycle 6 will have a disease assessment 
(CT/MRI) performed every 12 weeks ± 1 week (i.e ., Cycles 10, 14, 18) until Cycle 18 in the first 
12 months with scans collected through the firs t year, then every 24 weeks ± 2 weeks (i.e., 
Cycles 26, 34) until PD or death, or up to 2 years,  whichever occurs first.  After that, disease 
assessments may be performed as clinically indicated (i.e., at the discretion of the Investigator or 
per standard of care). 
Safety will be assessed by the incidence and severity of AEs as determined by National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adve rse Events (NCI CTCAE v4.03).  Additional 
safety parameters will include physical examinat ion and vital signs, as well as hematology and 
serum chemistry laboratory tests ( Section 11.2 ). 
8.2. Number of Subjects 
Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in the study. 
8.3. Dose and Schedule 
8.3.1. Dose and Mode of Administration 
Subjects will receive: 
 CUDC-907 60 mg (2 × 30 mg capsules) orally  (PO) for 5 days on/2 days off (5/2) 
(21-day cycles) 
CUDC-907 will be administered PO with meals (± 30 minutes).  CUDC-907 will be 
administered in the clinic on days of PK bl ood sampling, biopsy sampling, and on Day 1 of each 
cycle up to Cycle 13.  Beginning on Cycle 14, in-clinic dosing will only be required on Day 1 of even numbered cycles (i.e., Cycles 14, 16, 18, etc.). 
If a dose is missed or vomited, the subject will be inst ructed to skip that dose and report it to the 
Principal Investigator (PI) as soon as possible.  Missed or vomite d doses should not be made up. 
Subjects must meet retreatment criteria in or der to continue receiving study treatment (see 
Section 10.5.2).

12 months with scans collected through the firs t year, then every 24 weeks ± 2 weeks (i.e., 
Cycles 26, 34) until PD or death, or up to 2 years,  whichever occurs first.  After that, disease 
assessments may be performed as clinically indicated (i.e., at the discretion of the Investigator or 
per standard of care). 
During Post-Treatment Follow-Up:  All subjects will have PFS and survival assessments every 
12 weeks during the first 6 months, then every 24  weeks until PD or death, or up to 2 years, 
whichever occurs first.  After that, disease asse ssments may be performed as clinically indicated 
(i.e., at the discretion of the Investigator or pe r standard of care).  Ov erall survival may be 
checked by phone every 3 months and data entere d in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
8.4. Planned Duration of Treatment  
CUDC-907 will be taken until disease progr ession, withdrawal from study, unacceptable 
toxicity, pregnancy, initiation of another antican cer or experimental th erapy, noncompliance with 
study procedures, or st udy discontinuation. 
Dose and/or schedule intensity of CUDC -907 may be reduced due to toxicity.

    10. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
10.1. Description of Study Drug 
CUDC-907 mesylate is a synthetic small molecule  inhibitor of HDAC and PI3K.  The chemical 
structure of CUDC-907 integrat es the hydroxamic acid moiety of  HDAC inhibitors into a 
morpholinopyrimidine pharmacophore of PI3K inhibitors. 
CUDC-907 is manufactured, labeled and packag ed in accordance with Good Manufacturing 
Practices (GMP). 
CUDC-907 mesylate oral capsules are formul ated with three exci pients: silicified 
microcrystalline cellulose (Prosolv® HD90), sodium starch  glycolate (Explotab®), and 
magnesium stearate.  The resulting dry blended mixture is filled into gelatin capsule shells. 
10.2. Supply, Packaging and Labeling 
CUDC-907 will be supplied as gelatin capsules containing 30 mg CUDC-907 and excipients. 
The capsules are packaged in high-density poly ethylene bottles containing 35 capsules each, and 
appropriately labelled for clinical trial us e as per national regu latory requirements. 
10.3. Storage and Dispensing 
The study drug should be stored at room temperat ure in a secure area w ith access limited to the 
Investigator and aut horized site staff. 
Only subjects enrolled in the trial may receiv e investigational product.  The investigational 
materials are to be prescribed only by the PI or the sub-Investigators named in FDA Form 1572.  
In addition, the study drug may only be dispensed by authorized personnel at the institution(s) 
specified on Form 1572.  For self-administration, subjects may be provided with a sufficient 
number of capsules as are needed fo r 1 cycle of study drug administration. 
Under no circumstances is the investigational drug to  be used other than as directed within this 
study protocol. 
10.4. Investigational Product Accountability 
Study drug accountability records will be maintain ed throughout the course of the study. The 
Investigator or designee will document the amount  of study drug received, the amount dispensed 
to study subjects and the amount destroyed locally.  
Unused study drug remaining at the completion of the study will be destr oyed at the site per 
institutional standard operat ing procedures provided that destruction is documented. 
10.5. Study Drug Administration 
10.5.1. CUDC-907  
Subjects will receive CUDC-907 60 mg in 21-day cycles. 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 44  
    CUDC-907 will be administered orally at the assigned dose level and schedule, 60 mg on a 5/2 
schedule. 
All doses of study drug (in clinic  and self-administered) will be administered with meals 
(± 30 minutes) at approximately the same time each dosing day, if possible. 
Dose and/or schedule intensity of CUDC-907 may be reduced per protocol due to toxicity.  
In the absence of significant toxicity, each subjec t is expected to complete at least 1 cycle 
(21 days) of study treatment.  However, subjects  may continue to receive additional 21-day 
cycles of CUDC-907 treatment until diseas e progression has been documented or other 
discontinuation criteria have been met (Section 9.3.1). 
10.5.2. Retreatment Criteria 
Subjects may continue to receive 21-day cycles  of study treatment until disease progression has 
been documented or other discontinuati on criteria have been met (Section 9.3.1). 
To continue dosing of CUDC-907 subject s must meet the following criteria: 
 ANC > 1,000/µL. 
 Platelets ≥ 50,000/µL. 
 AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 × ULN. 
 Bilirubin concentration ≤ 1.5 × ULN (or ≤  3 ULN for patients with documented 
Gilbert’s syndrome). 
 Creatinine ≤ 1.5 × ULN. 
 ≤ Grade 2 diarrhea controlled by antidiarrheal treatment. 
10.5.3. Safety Criteria for Adjustment or Stopping CUDC-907 
10.5.3.1. Dose Delays and Disc ontinuation of CUDC-907 
In the event that any of the above criteria ar e not met, study drug dosing must be held until the 
retreatment criteria are met.  Treatment may th en resume at the full dose of CUDC-907, as long 
as none of the criteria in Table 2  are met.  Beyond Cycle 1, subject s held for > 7 days may restart 
treatment after the subject has met the above criteria and following di scussion and agreement 
between the Investigator and the Medical Monitor.  Beyond Cycle 2, subjects may have study 
drug held for up to 7 days between the end of a cycle and initiation of another (e.g., Cycle 2 Day 
21 to Cycle 3 Day 1).  This hold will be at the discretion of the Investig ator and after discussion 
and agreement between the Investigator and Medical Monitor. Study treatment should be discontinued in the even t of an unacceptable toxi city or treatment hold 
lasting more than 4 weeks, except in cases of clinical benefit dete rmined by the Investigator with 
approval by the Sponsor  Medical Monitor. 
Subjects who experience a DLT-like event will be either di scontinued from further study 
treatment or their dose will be reduced fo llowing discussion and agreement between the 
Investigator and the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor.  A DLT-like event will be defined as any of the 
following AEs occurring at any time: 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 45  
     Non-hematological ≥ Grade 3 AE, other than Grade 3 nausea or Grade 3 vomiting in 
subjects treated with less than optimal antiemetic therapy. 
 An AE resulting in a dose delay of ≥ 7 consecutive days (e .g., 6 consecutive missed 
doses). 
 Grade 4 neutropenia ≥ 7 days, or ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia with  fever > 101.3ºF (38.5ºC) 
or ≥ Grade 3 neutropenia with infection. 
 Grade 4 thrombocytopenia ≥ 7 days, or ≥ Grade 3 thrombocytopenia and significant 
bleeding. 
NOTE:  A DLT-like event excludes AEs that are clearly and incontrovertibly related to 
the underlying disease or extraneous factors.

10.5.3.3. Dose Adjustments for CUDC-907 Hematol ogic and Non-hematologic Toxicity  
The administration of HDAC and PI3K inhibitors  has been associated with predictable bone 
marrow suppression that is typical ly transient and reversible. 
The administration of HDAC and PI3K inhibitors has also been associated with hyperglycemia.  
This hyperglycemia does not generally result in severe metabolic complic ations and typically 
resolves with therapeutic intervention.  The trea tment goal for glycemic control is fasting plasma 
glucose < 160 mg/dL; while making every attemp t to avoid hypoglycemia.  Dose modifications 
of CUDC-907 are based on the severity of toxicities. 
CUDC-907 dose adjustments for hematologic a nd non-hematologic toxicities are shown in 
Table 2 .

applicable per Table 1 ) upon return to ≤ Grade 1 or 
baseline.  
 
Recurrence of Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia will be cause for a second dose modification.  
If the starting dose do es not permit dose modification, then  study drug will be discontinued. 
Recurrence of Grade 3 or 4 hyperglycemia that does not recover to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline within 3 weeks after second modification (as applicable) will 
be grounds for discontinuation of study drug.2 
AEs = adverse events; ANC = absolute neutrophil count 
1 Transient Grade 1 or 2 hyperglycemia should be monitored per Investigator discretion and medical guidelines. 
2 An exception for ongoing treatment may be made in the case of Investigator-determined clinical benefit with approval from the Medical Monitor.

    10.6. Concomitant Medications 
Information on concomitant medications will be collected from 30 days prior to study drug 
dosing through the EOT visit.  Information on subs equent anticancer treatments will be collected 
through the Follow-up visits. 
10.6.1. Permitted Medications 
Antidiarrheal treatment (e.g., loperamide) should be administered immediately upon the first 
onset of symptoms.  Each subject should be instru cted to have loperamide or a comparable anti-
diarrheal medication (per institutional standard ) readily available and to begin treatment for 
diarrhea at the first episode of poorly formed or  loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel 
movements more frequent than normally expected for the subject until diarrhea free.  Subjects 
will be instructed to notify the Investigator if diarrhea occurs a nd will be evaluated in the clinic 
for significant dehydration, possibl e electrolyte imbalance, and/or ongoing losses.  If clinically 
significant dehydration is present,  rehydration and electrolyte repl etion per institu tional standard 
will be required.  Additionally, subjects will be monitored following rehydration for the risk of 
recurrence and electrolyte imbalances and also advised regarding approp riate fluid management 
to reduce the likeli hood of subsequent dehydration events. 
Antiemetics may be given prophylactically after the first episode of nausea or vomiting per 
standard of care at each study center. 
Unless otherwise prohibited (See Section 10.6.2), supportive therapy for optimal medical care 
may be administered per institutional standard of  care at the study centers. 
Growth factor support is permitted for neutropenia or neutropenic fever. 
10.6.2. Drug Interactions/Precautions 
In vitro , CUDC-907 competitively inhibits cytochro me P450 isoenzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 with half ma ximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) values of > 10, > 10, > 
10, and 0.28 to 13.58 μ M, respectively.  Currently, it is not known whether achievable plasma 
exposures of CUDC-907 in humans will approach these in vitro  determined values.  These data 
suggest that CUDC-907 may inhibit cytoch rome P450 isoenzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, 
CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, although the clinical significan ce of this potential interaction has not 
been investigated.  Subjects receiving concom itant medications metabolized by these enzymes 
should be monitored at the disc retion of the Investigator. 
Please refer to the CUDC-907 Investigator’s Brochure for additional drug interaction 
information. 
10.6.3. Contraception 
Subjects of childbearing potential and their partners must agree to use adequate birth control 
throughout their participation in the study and for 30 days followi ng the last study treatment for 
subjects receiving CUDC-907.  Adequate contra ception is defined as hor monal birth control, 
intrauterine device, double barr ier method or total abstinence. 
NOTE:  vomiting and diarrhea may cause oral c ontraceptives to be ineffective.

10.7. Treatment Compliance 
To facilitate and ascertain treatment compliance, subjects may be provided with and trained to 
complete a Dosing Diary, which must be returned to  the clinic for review at each clinic visit. 
10.8. Group Allocation 
Based on central testing and review, subjects rece iving treatment will be classified into one of 
the following categories for purposes  of analysis:  (1) Group A:  MYC  translocation+ by FISH, 
(2) Group B:  MYC expression in ≥ 40% of tumor cells by IHC and/or MYC  gene copy number 
gain by FISH, or (3) Group C:  MYC  translocation¯ by FISH, and MYC expression in < 40% of 
tumor cells by IHC, and no MYC  gene copy number gain by FISH ( Figure 1).   
To facilitate early testing of MYC status, a se parate ICF specific for MYC testing will be 
available to be signed prior to sample te sting and the signing of the main ICF.  
All subjects who enter into the Screening period of the study (defined as the point at which the 
patient signs the main ICF) will receive a unique screening number. Once all eligibility criteria are confirmed and the subject is enrolled in the study, a subject identification number will be 
assigned.  This number will be used to identify the subject throughout the study and must be used 
on all study documentation rela ted to that subject. 
The study is open-label and therefore no provisions will be made for blinding.

    11. STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
11.1. Screening 
The PIs at each site are responsible for maintain ing a record of all screened subjects, including 
both those who enter the study and those who are excluded.  Screening procedures performed as 
part of standard-of-care, in advance of signing the ICF, need not be repeated for study purposes 
if performed within the 28-d ay screening visit window. 
11.1.1. Patient Registration and Group Assignment 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria will be reviewed for each potentia l subject.  By central testing, 
the threshold for MYC-altered status is defined as MYC translocation+ by FISH and/or MYC 
expression in ≥  40% of tumor cells by IHC, and/or MYC  gene copy number gain by FISH.  
Subjects will be required to submit archival (m ost recent available) or fresh tumor samples for 
central FISH and IHC testing.  For subjects who enter the study with un confirmed MYC-altered 
disease, fresh tumor samples are preferred.  
Collection details and shipping address w ill be provided in the laboratory manual. 
Centralized registration and group assignment for eligible subjects will be completed according 
to a process defined by the Sponsor (Section 10.8). 
11.2. Safety Evaluations 
11.2.1. Demographics and Medical History 
Each patient’s complete medical history w ill be documented during Screening, including 
demographic information, relevant medical hist ory, current primary cancer diagnosis, and prior 
cancer treatments (chemo- and immunothe rapies, radiation therapy, surgeries). 
11.2.2. Physical Exam  
A complete physical exam will be performed at Sc reening, Day 1 of each cycle, and at the EOT 
visit.  Symptom-directed physical exams are re quired on Days 5 and 12 of Cycle 1 and at the 
Post-Treatment Follow-up visits (until time of dis ease progression, withdrawal of consent, or any 
other criteria that would ma ke the patient unable to be followed for disease response). 
11.2.3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Gro up (ECOG) Performance Status 
ECOG performance status (scale provided in Appendix A ) will be assessed at Screening, Day 1 
of each Cycle, and at the EOT visit. 
11.2.4. International Prognostic Index (IPI) 
The IPI will be performed for each subject at Sc reening and at Post-Treatment Follow-up visits. 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 51  
    11.2.5. Lymphoma Assessment 
Lymphoma assessment, consisting of a physical examination, a revi ew of the subject’s current 
signs and symptoms, B symptoms (drenching ni ght sweats, fevers > 101°F [38.3°C], chills, 
unexplained weight loss of over 10% of body mass over 6 months), and concomitant 
medications, will be conducted on Day 1 of every cycle, and at the EOT and Post-Treatment Follow-up visits (until time of di sease progression, withdrawal of consent, or any other criteria 
that would make the subject unable to be followed for disease response). 
11.2.6. Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include resting s upine blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, 
and weight (kg).  Height will be measured only at Screening.  Blood pressure, heart rate, 
respiratory rate, temperature, and weight will be measured at sche duled visits per protocol (see 
Schedule of Events in Section 5.1). 
11.2.7. Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Local laboratories will perform all clinical labora tory tests and results will be provided to the 
Investigator.  Samples will be collected at sche duled study visits before the administration of 
study drug unless otherwise noted, and more frequently  if clinically indicate d.  In the event of a 
clinically significant ≥ Grade 2 laboratory toxicity, more frequent laboratory tests should be 
performed until resolution or stabilization to ≤  Grade 1.  After Cycle 1, clinical laboratory tests 
may be performed within 2 business days prior to scheduled visits. 
Hematology tests include complete blood c ount (hemoglobin, hematocrit, white blood cell 
[WBC], platelets) with WBC di fferential (total neutrophils, eo sinophils, basophils, lymphocytes 
and monocytes). Blood chemistry tests include so dium, potassium, magnesium, phosphate, total protein, chloride, 
bicarbonate, calcium, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), crea tinine, uric acid, tota l bilirubin, alkaline 
phosphatase, AST, ALT, LDH,  albumin, and glucose. 
In addition, serum LDH will be measured during Screening. 
Laboratory tests will be performed at the time points specif ied in the Schedule of Events  
(Section 5.1). 
11.2.8. Pregnancy Testing 
A serum or urine pregnancy test will be performed for female subjects of childbearing potential 
at Screening, at least once per cy cle prior to dosing, and at the EO T visit.  The result must be 
negative for the subject to be enrolled in the study.  A positive result observed following 
enrollment should be confirmed with a repeat serum pregnancy test.  Pregnancy tests may be 
performed more frequently as clinically indicated. 
11.2.9. Electrocardiogram  
Standard, single 12-lead ECGs at Screening and the EOT visit will include heart rate, respiratory 
rate, and pulse rate, QRS, and QTcF (Fridericia’s formula) intervals.  The Investigator will be 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 52  
    responsible for a thorough review  of the tracings for any untoward changes from the baseline 
ECG for each indivi dual subject. 
During the screening ECG, if a patient has a QTcF ≥ 480 sec on the screening ECG, the ECG 
may be repeated twice (at least 24 hours apart) and the mean QTcF from the three screening 
ECGs must be < 480 msec in order to meet e ligibility criteria for trial participation. 
During treatment, based on triplicate EC Gs, if a patient has a mean QTcF ≥ 480 msec or the 
mean is an increase from the mean baseline (pretreatment on Day 1 of Cycle 1) QTcF of 
> 60 msec, the ECG may be repeated 2 more ti mes within 5 minutes.  The following will be 
applied based on the mean of the results  for all (up to 5) of the ECGs:  
 Continue ECG testing hourly until the increas e resolves.  If not resolved in 6 hours, 
discontinue further treatment a nd refer to in-hospital care.  
 If resolved in < 6 hours, resume dosing but  repeat the ECG schedule specified above 
on the next day of dosing.  
 If prolongation of QTcF meeting these crit eria occurs again, discontinue further 
treatment and, if not resolved in 6 hours, refer to in-hospital care.  
 If QTc prolongation does not reoccur, con tinue treatment as specified in the 
protocol. 
On any ECG if sustained (>3 beat s) ventricular tachycardia is detected, the patient should be 
referred immediately to  in-hospital care.  
If on any ECG, AFib is detected, the patient shou ld be referred for appropriate cardiology care, 
and within no more than 6 hours after discha rge from the clinic, have Holter monitoring 
instituted and continued for at least 48 hours.   Withhold treatment until review of the Holter 
results: 
 If AFib did not resolve with in 3 hours or by the time of the start of the Holter 
monitoring if longer than 3 hour s after discharge from the clinic, discontinue further 
treatment.  
 If during the Holter monitoring AFib was pres ent for > 3 hours, either sustained or as 
accumulated AFib duration, disc ontinue further treatment. 
 If AFib had resolved within 3 hours or by the time of the start of the Holter 
monitoring if longer than 3 hour s after discharge from the clinic, and did not reoccur 
in the 48 hours of monitoring, treatment can be resumed. 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 53  
     On the next day of dosing perform: 
 ECGs per the schedule outlined above.  
 Conduct Holter monitoring for 24 hours starting at least 1 hour prior to the dose. 
 Withhold the subsequent dose until review of the Holter results. 
 If AFib is again detected on ECG or of duration > 30 minutes on Holter 
monitoring, discontinue treatment. 
 If AFib does not reoccur, continue tr eatment as specified in the protocol. 
11.2.10. Adverse Events 
Monitoring and recording of AEs will be c onducted throughout the st udy.  Adverse events, 
including SAEs, will be captured on the case repo rt forms (CRFs) from the first day of study 
drug dosing until the EOT visit (30 ± 7 days post the last dose of study treatment).  After the 
EOT visit, only treatment-related SAEs will be captured.  Treatment-related SAEs that are 
ongoing at the time of Follow-up visits  should continue to be follo wed until resolution, return to 
baseline or are deemed the subjec t’s new baseline, or until they are ≤ Grade 1 (and following 
consultation and agreement by the Medical Mon itor).  Definitions, documentation, and reporting 
of AEs are described in detail in Section  12.  Following the Follow-up visits, any SAE 
determined by the Investigator to be potentially re lated to study treatment must also be reported. 
11.2.11. Concomitant Medications and Other Treatments 
Information on concomitant medications and other treatments, including blood products, will be collected from 30 days prior to study drug dos ing through the Follow-up visits (see Section 10.6) 
and will be updated at every study visit.  Beginn ing with the Follow-up visits, only anti-cancer 
therapies will be documented. 
11.3. Efficacy Evaluations 
11.3.1. Baseline Disease Assessment 
Cancer staging procedures should be perfor med during screening according to Ann Arbor 
classification ( Appendix B ), utilizing appropriate modalities for disease assessment such as 
PET-CT scanning, MRI scans, bone marrow assessmen t, and/or other laboratory assessments.  
The subject’s most recent tumor samples, either archived or fresh, must be sent to the central 
laboratory for verification of diagnosis. 
For confirmation of relapsed disease (defined as  PD after a CR or Cru), biopsy is preferred but 
FNA is acceptable.  For relapse during prior treatment, biopsy/FNA reconfirmation of the 
lymphoma is recommen ded but not mandatory. 
In subjects with refractory disease (defined as [a] PD during prior treatment, [b] SD after 
≥ 3 cycles of prior treatment, or [c] PR after ≥ 6 cycles of prior treatment, or for stage II disease, 
SD after ≥ 3 cycles of treatment and definitive involved-field radiotherapy) with sustained PR, a 
confirmation biopsy for DLBCL is preferred but an FNA may be acceptable.  If an FNA is 
inappropriate (e.g., due to biopsy inaccessibil ity), the Sponsor may determine eligibility 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 54  
    following review of imaging results  and disease history.  For subjec ts with SD or PD after prior 
treatment, reconfirmation of DLBCL by biopsy (preferred) or FNA is recommended but not 
mandatory. 
11.3.2. Disease Response Assessments 
The Investigator and independent review commi ttee will evaluate each s ubject for response to 
therapy according to the Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma ( Cheson et al, 
2007).  The independent review committee will be blinded to the investigator’s assessment of 
response. 
Efficacy assessments will be performed using CT/MRI scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis. 
Skull base-to-mid thigh PET scan is recommended but not mandated. 
Contrast-enhanced MRI may be used to evaluate  sites of disease that cannot be adequately 
imaged using CT or if contrast-enhanced CT  scanning cannot be performed due to medical 
condition(s). For each subject, the modality/moda lities utilized at screening will be followed throughout the 
subject’s time on study.  While additional modalities may be used depending on assessment 
needs and disease specifics, technologies used at  screening will continue to be followed at each 
restaging assessment to enable direct comparison with the baseline assessment. 
 The exploratory efficacy endpoint  of ORR will be a ssessed according to Lugano classification 
(Cheson et al, 2014 ; Barrington et al, 2014 ).  All subjects on active tr eatment will have disease 
response assessments (CT/MRI) performed during th e last week (Day 15 – 21) of Cycles 2, 4, 
and 6 (each ± 3 days).  If FDG-PET/CT is acqui red at baseline, follow-up FDG-PET is required 
at Cycle 4 and at Cycle 10.  PET findings with  score 1 and 2 by 5-PS score are considered as 
PET-negative and PET findings with score 3, 4, and 5 by 5-PS score are considered as 
PET-positive.  Subjects who continue to recei ve CUDC-907 after Cycl e 6 will have disease 
response assessments (CT/MRI) performed approximately every 12 weeks ± 1 week (i.e., Cycles 
10, 14, 18) until Cycle 18 in the first 12 months w ith scans collected through the first year, then 
every 24 weeks ± 2 weeks (i.e., Cycles 26, 34) un til PD or death, or up to 2 years, whichever 
occurs first.  After that, disease assessments may be performed as clinically  indicated (i.e., at the 
discretion of the Investigator or per standard of care). 
11.3.3. Survival Status 
Information on survival status will be collected for all subjects at the Post-Treatment Follow-up 
Visit time points. 
11.4. CUDC-907 Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
Subjects will have blood samples collected for the measurement of plasma concentrations of CUDC-907 and its major metabolite(s).  For all subjects, samples will be drawn 2 hours post-
dose on Day 1 of Cycles 1 and 4, and on Day 1 of every other cycle thereafter (i.e., Day 1 of 
Cycles 6, 8, 10, etc.).  In addition, for the first 50 subjects enrolled on amendment 4, blood 
samples will also be obtained 2 hours post-dose on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 1. Blood samples (4 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 55  
    mL) will be collected using lithium heparin pl asma tubes (e.g., Becton Dickinson Vacutainers 
Cat # 367884 or similar).  One additional blood sample  may be obtained at a later time point to 
assess for possible study drug accumulation. 
A full description of sample handling procedures is included in the laboratory manual. 
11.5. Biomarker Assessments 
11.5.1. Pharmacogenomic Assessments 
PAXgene® blood samples for pharmacogenomic assessment will be collected during the 
Screening period.  Collection deta ils and shipping address will be  provided in the laboratory 
manual. 
11.5.2. Plasma Biomarker Assessments 
Blood samples (20 mL) for plasma biomarker analysis will be drawn durin g the Screening period 
and on Day 1 of scheduled clinic visits per protocol (see Schedule of Events in Section 5.1).  The 
plasma samples will be analyzed for cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and potential markers of 
CUDC-907 activity, such as ch anges in cytokine levels.  
These time points may be administratively adjust ed or discontinued at the discretion of the 
Sponsor; however, the total number of blood samples will not be increased. 
Collection details and shipping address w ill be provided in the laboratory manual. 
11.5.3. Tumor Biomarker Assessments 
Optional tumor samples (i.e., CNB or FNA biopsy samples for subjects with accessible lesions) 
may be obtained prior to the first dose and w ithin 8 hours post-dose on Cycle 1, Day 15 through 
Cycle 2, Day 1.  If available, archival tumor tissue samples and corresponding pathology report will also be collected.  Samples will be analyzed to evaluate baseline levels and/or changes in 
biomarkers related to the disease and/or ta rgeted pathways, if feasible.  BCL2 and BCL6 
expression and gene translocati on status are among disease-related biomarkers to be tested.  
Collection details and shipping address w ill be provided in the laboratory manual.

    12. ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERI OUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
12.1. Definition of an Adverse Event 
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associat ed with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered drug related.  An AE can th erefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, 
symptom, or disease temporally associated w ith the use of a drug, without any judgment about 
causality.  An AE can arise from any use of  the drug from any rout e of administration, 
formulation, or dose, including an overdose. 
An AE includes: 
 An exacerbation of a pre-existing illness 
 An increase in frequency or intensity of a pre-existing episodic event or condition 
 A condition detected or diagnosed after study drug administration even though it may 
have been present prior to  the start of the study 
An AE does not include: 
 Medical or surgical procedures (e.g.,  surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion); the condition that l eads to the procedure is an AE 
 Pre-existing diseases or conditions present or detected at th e start of the study that do 
not worsen in severity or frequency 
 Situations where an untoward medi cal occurrence has not occurred (e.g., 
hospitalization for elective surgery, so cial and/or convenience admissions) 
 Overdose of either study drug or concom itant medication without any signs or 
symptoms 
A clinical laboratory AE is any laboratory value th at is considered clini cally significant by the 
Investigator and has caused a medical interv ention, dose hold, dose re duction or schedule 
change.  Laboratory abnormalities that have no t required medical intervention should not be 
recorded as AEs and will be captured and reported in the Laboratory secti on of the clinical study 
report. 
Disease progression is a worsening of a subject’s condition attribut able to the disease for which 
the study medication is being given.  This may be an increase in severity of the disease or an 
increase in the symptoms of the disease.  New or increasing signs and symptoms related to 
disease progression should be re ported as an AE; however, disease progression and death from 
disease progression should not be recorded as an AE unless death occurs within 30 days of the 
subject’s last dose of CUDC-907. 
12.2. Recording Adverse Events 
All AEs will be reported from the first dose of  study drug through the EOT visit (30 ±7 days 
following the last day of study treatment).  Only  treatment-related AEs will be captured from 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 57  
    EOT through Follow-up visits.  All treatment-emerg ent SAEs will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization. 
Whenever possible, a diagnosis should be give n when signs and symptoms are due to common 
etiology (e.g., cough, runny nose, sneezing, sore th roat, and head congestion should be reported 
as “upper respiratory infection”).  AE reporting and severity grading will be assessed using the 
NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (C TC), Version 4.03 (June 2010).  For those events without 
assigned CTCAE grades, the recommendation on page 1 of the CTCAE that converts mild, 
moderate and severe into CTCAE grades should be used.  A copy of the NCI CTC is available 
online at: http://evs.nci. nih.gov/ftp1/CTCA E/About.html. 
The causal relationship to study treatment will be determined by the Investigator according to 
best medical judgment, as follows: 
 Definitely related: This category applies when, after careful medical consideration, 
there is almost no consideration of other causation. 
 Probably related: There is a clinically pl ausible time sequence between onset of the 
AE and study treatment administration.  The AE is unlikely to be caused by a 
concurrent and/or underlying il lness, other drugs, or pro cedures.  If applicable, the 
AE follows a clinically consistent reso lution pattern upon withdrawal of study drug. 
 Possibly related: There is a clinically pl ausible time sequence between onset of the 
AE and study treatment administration, but the AE could also have been caused by 
the concurrent/underlying illness, other drugs, or procedures.  Information regarding 
study drug withdrawal may be lacking or unclear.  “Possi ble” should be used when 
study treatment administration is one of se veral biologically plausible causes of the 
AE. 
 Unlikely related: The AE is most likely due to a non-study-treatment-related cause.  
However, association with the study trea tment cannot be completely ruled out. 
 Unrelated: Another cause of the AE is mo st plausible and a clinically plausible 
temporal sequence is inconsistent with the onset of the AE and study treatment 
administration and/or a causal relationship is considered biologically implausible. 
For the purpose of regulatory reporting requirement s, causal relationships of definite, probable, 
and possible will be considered treatment-re lated, while unlikely and unrelated will be 
considered not treatment-related. 
12.3. Serious Adverse Events 
An SAE is any AE or suspected adverse reaction th at is considered “serio us” if, in the view of 
either the Investigator or  Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Is fatal; 
 Is life-threatening (defined as an immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred); 
 Requires in-patient hospitalization or prolongation of exis ting hospitalization 
(Exception:  Hospitalization for elective trea tment of a pre-existing condition that did 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 58  
    not worsen during the study and is not consid ered an AE.  Note: Complications that 
occur during hospitalization are AEs and if a complication prolongs hospitalization, 
then the event is serious); 
 Results in persistent or significant disabil ity/incapacity, or subs tantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life functions; 
 Is a congenital anomal y/birth defect, or; 
 Though not included in the above definitions, may be considered serious when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgment, they ma y jeopardize the subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prev ent one of the outcomes listed in this 
definition. 
Examples of important medical events which may meet the definition of a SAE include:  
intensive treatment in the emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, certain 
abnormalities (e.g., blood dyscrasias), convulsions th at do not result in hospitalization, or the 
development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
Grade 4 laboratory abnormalities will not be repo rted as SAEs except in those cases when the 
abnormality is associated with a clinical  diagnosis, which is a recorded SAE. 
12.4. Reporting of Adverse Experiences , Serious Adverse Experiences, 
Serious and Unexpected  Adverse Experiences 
12.4.1. Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor 
All SAEs, regardless of relationship to the st udy treatment, must be reported to the Sponsor 
within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event.  Written SAE notification must 
follow within the 24-hour reporting timeframe, via an SAE Report submitted to Novella Clinical 
Safety Management via email at pvgsafety@novellaclinical.com  or by fax at 1-866-761-1275.  
Where appropriate, follow-up SAE reports must be submitted by the Investigator as new information becomes available.  All treatm ent-emergent SAEs should be followed until 
resolution, return to baseline or stabilization. 
If the Investigator becomes aware of safety in formation involving a subject who participated in 
the study that appears to be drug related, even after an individual s ubject has completed the 
study, this should also be reported to the Sponsor.   
12.4.2. Reporting to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) 
SAEs will be reported to the IRB by the Investigator according to local or national requirements 
and the IRB’s policy and procedures. 
12.4.3. Reporting to the Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor will be responsible for reporting al l AEs and SAEs to the appropriate regulatory 
authority (e.g., U.S. FDA), Investigators, and central IRB in accordance with all applicable

    12.4.4. Pregnancy Reporting  
Pregnancy testing must be performed in all female subjects of childbearing potential at 
Screening, at least once per cycle prior to dosing, at  the EOT visit, and as c linically indicated.  In 
the event of a positive test result, subjects w ill be discontinued from study drug and will be 
followed for the outcome of their pregnancy. 
If a female subject suspects she might be preg nant (e.g., missed or late menstrual period) or a 
male subject suspects he may have fathered a ch ild at any time during th e study through the final 
Follow-up visit, they must notify the Investigator  immediately.  The Investigator will follow the 
subject or subject’s part ner to determine the outco me of the pregnancy. 
Information regarding pregnancy must be report ed immediately to the Sponsor and the outcome 
information provided once the outcome is known. The Investigator should complete the Initial Pre gnancy Notification report form and forward it to 
the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours of knowledge of the pregnancy.  If there is an 
associated serious outcome, then both the Initi al Pregnancy Notificati on report form and SAE 
report form should be completed. 
The Investigator should follow-up with the subject or subject’s female partner until delivery or 
termination of pregnancy even if the subject wa s withdrawn from the clinical study or if the 
clinical study has finished.  At that time, the Pregnancy Outcome report form should be 
completed and submitted to the Sponsor within 24 hours after the Investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy outcome. 
In the event the pregnancy outcome occurs followi ng the end of the study and database lock, the 
Investigator will report the pregnancy outcome to the Sponsor (or designee) within 24 hours after 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known to the In vestigator in accordance with the procedure for 
reporting SAEs (see Section 12.3).

    13. STUDY ACTIVITIES 
During the treatment period, all treatment assessm ents/procedures should occur within ± 2 days 
of the scheduled time points.  If extenuating ci rcumstances prevent a subject from starting or 
completing treatment, or a scheduled procedure or assessment within  the protocol-specified time, 
the subject may continue to be treated on the study only with permissi on of the Curis Medical 
Monitor or designee clinician. 
All times should be recorded using the 24-hour clock (e.g., 23:20, rather than 11:20 PM).

    14. STATISTICAL ANALYSES 
14.1. Overview of Study Design 
The safety and preliminary efficacy of CUDC-907 will be evaluated when administered in 
subjects with RR MYC-altered DLBCL.  Patients with RR DLBCL will be tested for MYC-altered disease, defined as MYC  translocation by FISH, or MYC expression in ≥ 40% of 
tumor cells by IHC staining and/or MYC  gene copy number gain by FISH based on fresh or 
archived tumor tissue sample (most recent available). 
Based on central testing and revi ew, subjects will be classified into one of the following 
categories:  (1) Group A:  MYC  translocation
+ by FISH, (2) Group B:  MYC expression in ≥ 40% 
of tumor cells by IHC and/or MYC  gene copy number gain by FISH, or (3) Group C:  MYC  
translocation¯ by FISH and MYC expre ssion in < 40% of tumor cells and no MYC  gene copy 
number gain by FISH.   Subjects in all groups will conti nue to receive treatment until they meet criteria for treatment 
discontinuation. 
14.2. Study Endpoints 
14.2.1. Primary Endpoint 
 ORR (central determination) 
14.2.2. Secondary Endpoints 
 ORR (local determination) 
 PFS, median PFS, and PFS6 (central and local determination) 
 OS 
 DCR and DOR (central and local determination) 
 To evaluate the incidence and severity of AEs, SAEs, and other safety parameters in 
subjects receiving CUDC-907. 
 To characterize the PK of CUDC-907. 
14.2.3. Exploratory Endpoints 
 To explore the effects of CUDC-907 on disease-associated biomarkers. 
 To explore the relationship between diseas e-associated biomarkers in plasma and 
tumor tissue.  Among biomarkers of intere st, BCL2 and BCL6 pr otein expression and 
translocation status in part icular will be tested in tumor tissue, where possible. 
 To explore biomarkers of response for patient selection. 
 To explore the relationship be tween additional biomarkers and biomarker profiles that 
may influence biologic and c linical responses to CUDC-907. 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 68  
     To explore the ORR according to Lugano classification ( Cheson et al, 2014 ; 
Barrington et al, 2014 ). 
14.3. Sample Size Considerations 
The sample size for Groups A and B was determined based on the following: 
With a sample size of 50 subjects in Groups A and B with an ORR of 30.0%, a two-sided 95% 
confidence interval employing the exact binomial method will extend from 17.9% to 44.6%. This 
confidence bound (CB) about the observed ORR is  thought to adequately  characterize the 
disease response of these populat ions after receiving CUDC-907. 
Below are the 95% confidence intervals for vari ous response rates using a sample size of 
50 subjects and employing th e exact binomial methodology. 
Sample Size ORR Lower 95% 
Confidence Bound Upper 95% 
Confidence Bound 
50 15 (30%) 17.9% 44.6% 
50 14 (28%) 16.2% 42.5% 
50 13 (26%) 14.6% 40.4% 
50 12 (24%) 13.1% 38.2%) 
Enrollment within a group or overall may also te rminate early due to other considerations such 
as those that may preclude timely completion of  the study (e.g., low prev alence of MYC-altered 
DLBCL). 
14.4. Statistical Analysis 
The statistical analyses will be performed using SAS® version 9.4 or later (SAS Institute Inc., 
Cary, NC).  A comprehensive statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be finalized prior to database 
lock. 
14.4.1. Analysis Populations  
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Populatio n will consist of all subjects in Groups A and B.  The primary 
analyses of efficacy will be conducted based on the ITT Population. 
The Evaluable Population will consist of all subjec ts in Groups A and B who receive at least one 
full cycle of treatment and have at least one pos t-baseline disease assess ment and have not had 
major protocol deviations that are thought to have materially im pacted efficacy outcomes. Major 
protocol deviations will be iden tified prior to database lock.  Secondary analysis of efficacy will 
also be conducted based on the Evaluable Populat ion.  In addition, the primary efficacy endpoint 
(ORR) will also be assessed using the Eval uable Population as a secondary analysis. 
The Safety Population will consist of all subjects who receive any treatment.  All safety analyses 
will be conducted based on this population.

Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 69  
    14.4.2. Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics will be summarized.  Data to be tabulated will 
include demographic features such as sex, age, race, and weight, as well as disease-specific 
characteristics, such as tumor stage and histology. 
14.4.3. Efficacy Analyses 
The primary analyses of efficacy will be based on the ITT Population.  The interim analyses will 
be performed on the Evaluable Population. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, ORR, will be base d on the proportion of subjects with CR or PR 
using the central dete rmination of disease response in Groups A and B, separately.  The estimate 
will be accompanied by a two-sided exact binomial 95% CB.   
Progression-free survival, OS, and DOR will be summarized descriptively for Groups A and B 
using the Kaplan-Meier method.  For such subjects, the progression or censoring date will be determined based on described conventions ( Food and Drug Administration, 2007 ). 
Progression-free survival, median PFS, and the es timated rate at 6 months (PFS6) based on the 
Kaplan-Meier analyses will be reported separate ly for Groups A and B.  For OS, the estimated 
rates at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months based on the Kaplan-Meier analyses  will be reported for Groups A 
and B.  For DOR, the estimate of the median ba sed on the Kaplan-Meier analyses for Groups A 
and B will be reported. 
Waterfall plots will be used to depict graphically the maximum decrease from baseline in the 
sum of the product diameters in m easurable nodes and nodal masses. 
Secondary analyses of efficacy will be conducte d based on the ITT and Evaluable Populations 
using response as determined by both the cen tral determination of  disease response and 
investigator site.  In these analyses, the prim ary efficacy endpoint, ORR, will be estimated using 
the proportion of subjects with CR or PR.  Th e estimate will be accompanied by a two-sided 
exact binomial 95% lower CB. 
14.4.3.1. Interim Analyses 
Interim analyses of efficacy using the Evalua ble Population will be pe rformed after ORR has 
been determined in 25 evaluable subjects for bot h Groups A and B, separately. In both Groups A 
and B, the ORR using the local determination of  disease response will be obtained. If the lower 
bound of a single-sided 95% confidence interval using the exact binomial method is less than 
10% (i.e., 5 responses or less out of 25 patients) in  either group, enrollment in that group will not 
continue. Below are the 95% singl e-sided lower confidence interv als for various response rates 
using a sample size of 25 patients and employing the exact binomial methodology.

14.4.4. Safety Analysis 
The analyses of safety will be conducted base d on the Safety Population.  Analyses will be 
stratified by treatment.  Safety will be assessed based on AEs, SAEs, laboratory values, vital 
signs, and ECG results. 
Summary tables will be produced for all reported treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), defined as 
AEs that start or worsen on or after the first administration of study treatment.  The reported AE 
term will be assigned a standardized preferred term using the current version of the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). 
TEAEs will be summarized based on the number and percentage of subjects experiencing the 
event by MedDRA system organ class and prefer red term.  The causal relationship between the 
occurrence of an AE and study tr eatment will be judged by the Investigator.  In the event a 
subject experiences repeat episode s of the same AE, then the ev ent with the highest severity 
grade and the event with the strongest causal relationship to study drug will be used for purposes 
of incidence tabulations. Tabular summaries will be provided for: 
 All TEAEs 
 TEAEs by relationship to study treatment 
 TEAEs by severity 
 TEAEs occasioning treatment modification  
 Serious TEAEs 
All deaths that occur on study (defined as duri ng treatment or within 30 days of treatment 
discontinuation) will be  reported in a subject listing, which will include the primary cause of 
death and the number of days betw een the date of the last dose of  study treatment and death.  For 
subjects on combination treatment,  the listing will show the date of last dose of each component. 
Hematology and serum chemistries will be summarized using conventional summary statistics 
(mean, standard deviation, median, and range) fo r the following: baseline value, minimum and 
maximum post-baseline values, average post-baseline value, and last post-baseline value.  
Standard shift tables will also  be prepared presenting worst po st-baseline toxicity grade vs 
baseline.  Vital signs and ECG results will be summarized in a descriptive manner by calculating

    the mean, standard deviation, median, and range by time point in the same manner described for 
laboratory values. 
Prior and concomitant medications will be coded to the generic term using the current version of 
the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary  and will be tabulated by group and listed by 
subject. 
14.4.5. Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Population PK analysis will be conducted to fu rther understand the PK profile of CUDC-907 in 
patients with RR MYC-altered DLBCL.  Linear mixed-effect modeling and/or a nonlinear 
mixed-effect modeling approach will be used in  the study to better unders tand the PK profile of 
CUDC-907 in general Preliminary PK informati on has been collected during Phase 1, and the 
basic PK models of the drug have been established.  In this study, blood samples will be obtained 
at 2 hours post-dose on Cycle 1 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1, and on Day 1 of every other cycle 
thereafter (i.e., Day 1 of Cycles  6, 8, 10, etc.). In addition, for the first 50 subjects enrolled on 
amendment 4, blood samples will also be obtaine d 2 hours post-dose on Days 8 and 15 of Cycle 
1. 
14.4.6. Multicenter Study 
Data will be pooled across centers for all analyses. 
14.4.7. Adjustments for Covariates 
No adjustments for covariates will be made. 14.4.8. Missing Data 
Unless otherwise stated, there will be no imput ation of missing data, but dates for AEs and 
concomitant medications may be im puted conservatively if partial.

law, to copy) research records for the purposes  of quality assurance reviews, audits, and 
evaluation of the study safet y, progress and data validity. 
The Investigator will provide the Sponsor with  a fully executed FDA Form 1572 including the 
Investigator’s curriculum vitae.  The Investigator will indicate on Form 1572 the name and 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 73  
    location of the clinical laborator y which will be used for subject evaluation.  The laboratory’s 
certification, certification number, and date of cer tification and the laboratory normal values will 
be provided.  Any changes in the clinical laboratory or laboratory values will be provided 
promptly to the Sponsor who will report the changes to the FDA as required. 
15.3. Record Retention 
The Investigator will retain a copy of all study reco rds in a secure location for a period of 2 years 
after the last approval of a marketing applicati on and until there are no pending or contemplated 
marketing applications OR until at least 3 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of 
clinical development of th e investigational product. 
15.4. Protocol Deviations and Amendment 
The Investigator is not permitted to alter or devi ate from the protocol without written agreement 
from the Sponsor.  Any such agreement should be re ported by the Investigator to their IRB/IEC.  
An immediate and unapproved deviation is permitte d if immediate health care concerns mandate 
it. 
All protocol revisions (amendments) must originate with and be documented by the Sponsor.  
The Investigator must submit the amendment to hi s/her IRB/IEC for review  and approval prior to 
implementation.  Documentation of approval signed  by the chairperson or designee must be sent 
to the Sponsor. 
15.5. Institutional Review Board/ Independent Ethics Committee 
The protocol, ICF(s), recruitment materials, a nd all patient materials will be submitted to the 
IRB/IEC for review and approval.  Approval of bot h the protocol and the consent form must be 
obtained before any patient is enrolled at any given investigative cente r, and a copy of the 
approval letter supplied to the Sponsor or Sponso r’s designee.  Any amendment to the protocol 
will require review and approval by the IRB/IEC before the changes are implemented in the 
study. 
During the course of the study, th e Investigator shall make timely and accurate reports to the 
IRB/IEC on study progress at interv als not exceeding one year, as  well as satisfying any other 
local IRB/IEC reporting regulations .  Copies of all reports t o, and correspondence with, the 
IRB/IEC must be provided to th e Sponsor or Sponsor’s designee.  Further, within three months 
of the completion or early termination of the study, a final report should be made to the IRB/IEC 
and Sponsor by the Investigator. 
It is the Investigator’s obliga tion to maintain an IRB/IEC corr espondence file and to make this 
available for review to Sponsor representatives as  part of the routine st udy monitoring process. 
15.6. Study Committees 
A Safety Review Committee (SRC) comprised of the Medical Monitor, PI, and Sponsor 
representatives will be convened to review safe ty information for ongoing safety surveillance. 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 74  
      The SRC is tasked with making a recommendati on to continue or stop the trial based on their 
assessment of available efficacy and safety information (see Section 9.3.2 for SRC stopping 
criteria). 
15.7. Sponsor Monitoring 
Monitoring and auditing procedures approved by  the Sponsor will be followed in order to 
comply with GCP guidelines.  After satisfactory receipt of all necessary  regulatory paperwork, 
the Sponsor’s monitor will arrange that all study material be delivered to the study site at a 
mutually convenient time.  An initiation visit by the Sponsor and its monitoring personnel will be 
made.  At this meeting, all pers onnel expected to be involved in  the conduct of the study will 
undergo an orientation to include  review of study protocol, inst ruction for eCRF completion and 
overall responsibilities, includ ing those for drug accountability and study file maintenance. 
Throughout the course of the study, the Sponsor’s monitor will make frequent contact with the 
Investigator.  This will include telephone and/or on-site visits.  On-site checking of the eCRFs 
for completeness and clarity, cr oss-checking with source docum ents, and clarification of 
administrative matters will be performed.  As part of the data audit, it is expected that source 
documents (e.g., hospital records, office records)  will be made available for review by the 
monitor.  The monitor also will perform dr ug accountability checks, and may periodically 
request review of the Investigat or’s study file to assure comp leteness of documentation in all 
respects of study conduct. 
Upon study completion, the monitor will arrange for a final review of the st udy files, after which 
the file should be secured by storage for the appropriate period as specified in Section 15.3.  The 
Investigator or appointed delega te will receive the Sponsor’s re presentative during these on-site 
visits and will cooperate in pr oviding the documents for inspec tion and responding to inquiries 
that may arise as part of this review.  The I nvestigator will also permit inspection of the study 
files by authorized representativ es of the FDA and regulatory au thorities of other countries. 
15.8. Publication/Data Sharing Policy 
Publication by the sites of any data from this study must be in accordance with the clinical trial 
agreement.

    16. ETHICS/PROTECTION OF HUMAN PATIENTS 
16.1. Ethical Conduct of the Study 
The study will be conducted in accordance with ethica l principles that have their origin in the 
Declaration of Helsinki and ar e consistent with ICH, GCP gu idelines, applicable regulatory 
requirements, and Curis policies.  The Investigator will ensure that this study is conducted in full 
conformity with the principles set forth in  The Belmont Report: Ethical Principles and 
Guidelines for the Protection of Human Patients of Research, as drafted by the U.S. National 
Commission for the Protection of Human Patient s of Biomedical and Behavioral Research 
(18 April 1979) and codified in 45 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 46 and/or the ICH 
E6. 
16.2. Informed Consent 
Informed consent is a process that is initiated pr ior to the individual agreeing to participate in the 
study and continues throughout study participation.  Extensive discussion of risks and possible benefits of study participation wi ll be provided to patients and thei r families, if applicable.  A 
consent form describing in deta il the study procedures and risks wi ll be given to the patient.  
Before each patient is enrolled in the clinical study, written informed consent will be obtained 
from the patient according to th e regulatory and legal requirement s of the participating country.  
The patient will receive all information that is required by regulatory authorities and ICH 
guidelines.  The Investigator (o r designee) will provide the Sponsor with a copy of the IRB-/ 
IEC-approved ICF prior to  the start of the study. 
The ICF must be signed and dated; one copy will be  given to the patient a nd the Investigator will 
retain a copy as part of the clinical study r ecords.  The Investigator will not undertake any 
investigation specifically required for the clinical study until written consent has been obtained.  
The terms of the consent and when it was obtaine d must also be documented.  Patients will be 
given the opportunity to discuss the study with their su rrogates or think about  it prior to agreeing 
to participate.  They may withdraw consent at  any time throughout the course of the study.  The 
rights and welfare of the patient s will be protected by emphasizing to them that the quality of 
their clinical care will not be a dversely affected if they decline to participate in this study. 
If a protocol amendment is requir ed, then the ICF may need to be  revised to reflect the changes 
to the protocol.  If the ICF is revised, it must be reviewed and appr oved by the responsible 
IRB/IEC and signed by all subjects subsequently enrolled in the clinical study as well as those 
currently enrolled in the clinical study. 
Written informed consent and Health Insuranc e Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
authorization will be obtained and documented fr om each patient prior to  entry into the study.  
The consent process will be documented in the eCRF. 
16.3. Confidentiality and Data Protection 
All clinical study findings and documents will be  regarded as confiden tial.  Study documents 
(protocols, Investigator’s Brochures, and other mate rial) will be stored ap propriately to ensure 
CUDC-907  Version 5.0 
Protocol CUDC-907-201 Amendment 4  30 August 2016 
 
 76  
    their confidentiality.  Patient data will be made  available upon request to monitors from the 
Sponsor, the FDA, the Institutional Review Board, and to other government agencies that have 
responsibility for clinical research activities. 
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained.  Data that are released by the 
Investigator to the Sponsor, the FDA, or IRB/IEC will not be directly traceable to the patient.  
Documents that identify the patient (e.g., the si gned informed consent document) must be 
maintained in confidence by the Investigator.  In  the event that a publicat ion of this research 
incorporates a patient's medical data, that data will not identify the patient.

extranodal site and one or lymph node regions, all on the same side of the diaphragm 
III Involvement of lymph node regions* or st ructures on both sides of the diaphragm 
IV Diffuse or disseminated involvement of one or  more extralymphatic organs, OR isolated 
extralymphatic organ involvement without adjacent regional ly mph node involvement, 
but with disease in distant site(s), OR any involvement of the liver, bone marrow, pleura 
or CSF 
* Lymph node regions include: right cervical (including cervical, supraclavicular, occipital, and preauricular lymph 
nodes), left cervical, right axillary, left axillary, right infraclavicular, left infraclavicular, mediastinal, hilar, periaortic, mesentery, right pelvic, left pelvic, right inguinal femoral, and left inguinal femoral 
2. Relevant Suffixes 
Suffix Meaning 
A Absence of constitutional symptoms 
B Constitutional symptoms:  fever (> 38°C),  drenching sweats, weight loss (10% body 
weight over 6 months) 
E Involvement of a single, extranodal site contiguous or proximal to a known nodal site 
(stages I to III only; additional ex tranodal involvement is stage IV) 
S Splenic involvement 
X Bulky disease, defined as one or more si te of disease of > 10 cm diameter, or 
mediastinal widening to > 1/3 of  the chest width on chest X-ray 
Other designations may include involved extranodal site(s): M = marrow, L = lung, H = liver, P = pleura, O = bone, 
D = skin and subcutaneous tissue; and the number of disease sites (e.g. II 2, II 4)

ASSESSMENT OF LYMPHOMA:  CONSENSUS OF THE 
INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON MALIGNANT LYMPHOMAS IMAGING WORKING GROUP; 5-PS SCORE 
The 5-PS scores the most intense uptake in a site of initial disease, if present, as follows: 
 1. No uptake above background 
 2. Uptake <	 mediastinum 
 3. Uptake >	 mediastinum but <	liver 
 4. Uptake moderately higher than liver 
 5. Uptake markedly higher th an liver and/or new lesions 
 X. New areas of uptake unlikely to be related to lymphoma

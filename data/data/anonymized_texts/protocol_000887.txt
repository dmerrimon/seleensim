   4. SYNOPSIS 
Name of Sponsor/Company : Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc . 
Name of Investigational Product : EN3835  
Name of Active Ingredient : Collagenase clostridium histolyticum  
Title of Study : A Phase 2 Open -label Study of EN3835 in the Treatment of Edematous Fibrosclerotic 
Panniculopathy  
Lead Principal Investigator : TBD  
Study Period :  
Estimat ed date first subject  enrolled:  Nov-2017  
Estimat ed date last subject completed:  Jul-2018  Phase of Development : 2 
Objectives : 
Primary Objective : 
 To assess the safety of EN3835 in the treatment of edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy 
(EFP), commonly known as cellulite, in adult women  
Secondary Objective : 
 To assess effectiveness of EN3835 in the treatment of EFP  
Study Design : This study is a Phase 2, open -label study of safety and effectiveness of EN3835 in the 
treatment of EFP in adult women. Subjects will be screened for study eligibility within 14 days prior to 
enrolling in this study. Subjects with at least 2 bilateral treatment areas (bilateral buttocks or bilateral 
posterolateral thighs) (a lso referred to as a region) (eg , their left and right buttocks or left and righ t 
posterolateral thighs) with mild, moderate or severe levels of cellulite as assessed by the Investigator 
using the Clinician Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR -PCSS) and a Hexsel Cellulite 
Severity Scale no greater than 13 will be eligibl e. If both their left and right buttocks AND left and right 
posterolateral thighs are eligible, one pair will be randomly selected a s the assigned treatment areas.  
Subjects will receive an open -label treatment course which consists of up to 3 treatment vis its  
(ie, Day1, Day 22, and Day 43). Each treatment visit will consist of 12 injections (0.3 mL per injection 
of EN3835 0.07 mg/injection) in each of the treatment areas of the region for a total volume of 7.2 mL 
(1.68 mg). Selection of dimples to be treat ed in the assigned treatment areas will be at the discretion of 
the Investigator. End -of-study will occur at study Day 180.  
At each treatment visit, the Investigator  will first conduct a live assessment of each treatment area of the 
assigned region using the CR -PCSS. The Investigator  will then select and mark the dimples to be treated 
within each treatment area. All the assessments must be done before marking the dimp les for injection.  
At Day 180 (End of Study/Early Termination), The Investigator  will conduct live assessments of each of 
the treatment area using the CR -PCSS. The subject will complete the Subject Satisfaction with Cellulite 
Treatment assessment.  
In a pho tographic sub -study at two sites, subjects will return to the site to have their treated areas 
photographed at 1, 3, 6, and 13 days after each treatment visit to assess local site reactions 
post-injection.  
Number of Subjects (planned) : Up to 150  
Study Center(s) : Approximately 10 sites in United States

   8. INTRODUCTION 
8.1. Back

8.1.1.  Edematous Fibrosclerotic Panniculopathy 
Edematous fibrosclerotic panniculopathy (EFP), commonly known as cellulite, has been defined 
as a local metabolic disorder of subcutaneous tissues that results in a contour abnormality of the 
skin.( 1) The condition manifests as dimpled skin, particularly in the gluteal-femoral region.( 2,3) 
EFP is caused by herniation of subcutaneous fat lobules through the dermohypodermal junction. 
This creates an uneven surface with dimpling.( 1) EFP is a medical condition resulting in a 
potentia
lly cosmetically unacceptable alteration of the skin, and affects an estimated 85% to 98% 
of postpubertal women.( 1,3) 
The pathophysiol
ogy of EFP is not completely understood, but there are 3 main theories: edema 
resulting from excessive hydrophilia of the intercellular matrix, alteration of the regional 
microcirculation, and different anatomical conformation of collagenous subcutaneous tissues in 
women versus men.( 4) 
It is known t
hat EFP is different from generalized obesity. In generalized obesity, adipocytes 
undergo hypertrophy and hyperplasia that are not limited to the pelvis, thighs, and abdomen.( 1) 
In areas of EFP, 
adipocytes have physiologic and biochemical properties that differ from adipose 
tissue located elsewhere. Large, metabolically-stable adipocytes characterize EFP-prone areas; 
thus, the responsiveness to catecholamine-induced lipolysis is less in EFP tissues compared to 
visceral fat, which has the greatest responsiveness.( 1) 
Subcutaneous fat lobes are separated from one another by thin, usually rigid strands of 
collagenous connective tissues, which cross the fatty layers and connect the dermis to the 
underlying fascia. These septa stabilize the subcutis and divide the fat. In EFP, shortening of the 
collagen septa due to fibrosis provokes retraction at the insertion points of the trabeculae, 
causing the depressions that characterize EFP. (2) There are a higher percentage of thinner, 
perpendicular
 hypodermal septa in women with EFP than in men.( 1) Weight gain makes EFP 
more noticeable, but 
it may be present even in thin subjects. Genetics may also play a role sinc e 
EFP tends to run in families. 
8.1.2. Current EFP Treatments  
There are therapies that have been utilized in an attempt to treat cellulite; however, there are no 
approved pharmacologic treatments. Despite multiple therapeutic modalities, there is little 
scientific evidence that any of these treatments are beneficial. In fact, much of the evidence is 
anecdotal, subjective, or based only on patient self-assessment.( 5) Some of the historical 
treatments for EFP have included weight loss, (6) topical agents, (5) m assage, (7) liposuction (5,6) 
mesother
apy,( 6) radiofrequency,( 6) subcision and powered subcision, (8) and laser 
therap
ies;(9,10) some of these treatments may pose an increased risk for adverse effects (5).

   There remains an unm
et medical need for safe and effective therapies to improve the aesthetic 
outcome in women with cellulite. To effectively treat cellulite, a therapeutic approach may 
require disrupti
on of the dermal septa, which are composed of collagen and cause the skin 
dimpling that is bothersome to many women. 
8.1.3. EN3835 (Collagenase Clostridium Histolyticum) 
Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Endo) i
s developing EN3835 for the treatment of EFP. Because 
EN3835 is a pr
oteinase that can hydrolyze the triple-helical region of collagen under 
physiological conditions, EN3835 has the potential to be effective in lysing subdermal collagen, 
such as those observed in the dermal septa, which are the underlying cause of the skin dimpling 
in women with EFP. EN3835 targets the collagenase structural matrix (eg, dermal septa) at the 
site of injection and does not require systemic exposure to be effectiv e. 
EN3835 is a parenteral lyophilized product comprised of 2 collagenases in an approximate 1:1 
mass ratio, Collagenase I (AUX-I, Clostridial class I collagenase) and Collagenase II (AUX-II; 
Clostridial class II collagenase). These collagenases are isolated and purified from the 
fermentation of Clostridium histolyticum . 
Collagenase
 AUX-I is a single polypeptide chain containing approximately 1,000 amino acids of 
known sequence and with a molecular weight of 114 kiloDaltons (kDa). Collagenase AUX-II is 
also approximately 1,000 amino acids long and has a molecular weight of 113 kDa. These 
2 collagenases are not immunologically cross-reactive and have different specificities, such that 
together they become sy
nergistic, providing a very broad hydrolyzing reactivity toward collagen. 
Clostridial collagenases are proteinases that can hydrolyze the triple-helical region of collagen 
under physiological conditions. 
EN3835 is currently approved (brand name is XIAFLEX®) for: 1) the treatment of adults with 
Dupuytren’s contracture with a palpable cord and, 2) for the treatment of adult men with 
Peyronie’s disease with a palpable plaque and curvature deformity of at least 30 degrees at the 
start of therapy. 
A recent Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study (EN3835-201) of 
375 women randomized to treatment of one treatment area (quadrant) (quadrant was defined in 
study EN3835
-201 as a left buttock, a right buttock, a left posterolateal thigh or a right 
posterolateral thigh) of cellulite with EN3835 0.84mg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio assessed the 
effectiveness and safety of EN3835. Efficacy in this study was evaluated based on cellulite 
assessments using the Clinician Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR-PCSS), 
Patient Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (PR-PCSS), Investigator Global 
Aesthetic Improvement Scale (I-GAIS), Subject Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (S-GAIS), 
and Subject Satisfaction with Cellulite Treatment. 
Results from the Phase 2b study demonstrated that treatment (3 visits approximately 21 days 
apart) improved the cellulite severity of the treated quadrant as assessed by the primary endpoint 
of 2-level composite responder analyses, the proportion of responders based on an improvement 
of ≥2 level
 in the appearance of cellulite in both the patient PR-PCSS and the clinician CR-PCSS 
of buttocks and thighs was statistically significantly greater in subjects who received EN3835 
0.84 mg (10.6%; p<0.001) compared to subjects who received placebo (1.6%); 1-level (or 
greater) 
responders in the PR-PCSS of EN3835-treated subjects (72.3%) was significantly 

EN3835-205 Protocol  
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 20 
   greater than 1
-level responders in the placebo group (51.6%) (p<0.001); statistically significant 
(p≤0.001) improvement in the appearance of cellulite based on the subject S-GAIS were 
observed in EN3835 0.84-mg group (73.1%) compared to the placebo group (44.0%); and 
sixty-two percent (62.9%) of subjects in the EN3835 0.84mg group were satisfied or very 
satisfied with the results of their cellulite treatment compared with only 35.9% of subjects in the 
placebo group (p<0.001). In subjects treated in buttocks (n=187), the proportion of 2-level 
composite responders was statistically significantly greater in subjects who received EN3835 
0.84 mg (14.9%; p<0.001) compared to subjects who received placebo (1.1%); 1-level (or 
greater) responders in the PR-PCSS of EN3835-treated subjects (72.7%%) was significantly 
greater than 1-level responders in the placebo group (47.8%) (p<0.001). 
The study also demonstrated EN3835 to be well tolerated with no serious adverse events (SAEs) 
related to EN3835. Safety results from a total of four studies (1 pilot, 2 Phase 1, and 2 Phase 2 
studies) in whic
h 435 adult females received subcutaneous injections of EN3835 indicate that the 
majority of TEAEs are transient, non-serious, mild or moderate in intensity, and related to the 
local administration of EN3835. The immunogenicity profile after 3 treatment visits of EN3835 
indicate 100% of EN3835-treated subjects were seropositive for AUX-I and/or AUX- II 
antibodi
es; this profile of EN3835 is similar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture and 
Peyronie’s disease programs. 
A Phase 1, open-label, safety and pharmacokinetic study of a single dose of EN3835 0.84mg in 
11 femal
e subjects with EFP showed that there was no quantifiable levels of AUX-I or AUX- II 
at any timepoint after subcutaneous injection of EN3835 0.84mg into one quadrant. A second 
Phase 1, open-label, safety and pharmacokinetic study of a single dose of EN3835 0.84mg per 
treatment area in two treatment
 areas (buttock-buttock, thigh-thigh, or buttock-thigh) 
concurrently (total dose of 1.68mg) showed that there was no quantifiable levels of AUX-I or 
AUX-II at any timepoint post-dose attributable to the injection of EN3835 1.68mg. 
The results from these studies suggest that subcutaneous injections of EN3835 in the area of 
cellulite may be a well-tolerated and effective medical treatment for adults with EFP. 
8.2. Su
mmary of Nonclinical Studies 
Non-clinical studies necessary to support clinical studies have been performed and are 
summarized in the Investigator Brochure (IB). (11) Non-clinical studies in the following areas 
were perform
ed: toxicology, reprotoxicity, genotoxicity, and hypersensitivity. 
8.3. Summary of Known Risks and Benefits 
A summary of safety risks is provided in the IB.( 11) The following events have been commonly 
observed: lo
cal injection site reactions (injection site bruising, injection site swelling, and 
injection site pain) for the various approved indications as well as those being investigated. In the 
phase 2b study of EN3835 in women with EFP, the following treatment-related adverse events 
≥2% of 189 EN3835-treated women were reported: injection site bruising (75.1%), injection site 
pain (59.3%), injection site nodule (14.3%), injection site pruritus (11.1%), injection site 
swelling (7.4%), injection site induration (5.8%), injection site mass (5.3%), injection site 
discolouration (3.2%), and injection site erythema (2.1%). These events are similar to events 
reported in the clinical trials of EN3835 for the approved indications. Post-marketing safety data 
have been consistent with data reported in clinical trials. 

EN3835-205 Protocol  
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 21 
   Although a thorough benefit of EN3835 has not
 been fully evaluated in the treatment of EFP, th e 
efficacy results from the Phase 2b study and previous EFP studies warranted further 
development. 
8.4. Rationale 
The alterations found in EFP are due largely to fibrosis of the connective tissues in the dermis 
and/or subcutaneous tissues.( 2) Subcutaneous fat lobes are separated from one another by thin, 
usually ri
gid strands of connective tissues, which cross the fatty layers and connect the dermis to 
the underlying fascia. These collagen septae stabilize the subcutis and divide the fat. Shortening 
and thick
ening of the septae due to fibrosis provokes retraction at the insertion points of the 
trabeculae, causing the depressions that characterize EFP.( 2) 
The pharma
cologic activity of EN3835 involves selective lysis of the triple-helical region of 
collagen under physiological conditions at the site of injection. EN3835 targets the collagenase 
structural matrix (eg, septae), which is the underlying cause of the skin dimpling, and does not 
require systemic exposure to be effective. The pharmacologic activity of EN3835 is local, rapid, 
and is ess
entially complete within 24 hours. 
The data from the Phase 2a EFP dose-ranging study (AUX- CC-831) suggest that EN3835 
0.84 mg was effective in the treatment of EFP based on improvement in the severity of cellulite 
as determine
d by both the Investigator and the subject, although the EN3835 0.48 mg group did 
show improvement in some of the efficacy parameters. 
 There were no safety concerns following administration of up to 3 treatment sessions 
of EN3835 0.84 mg in the treatment of EFP (section 5.3.1.3). The safety profile of 
EN3835 0.84 
mg in the treatment of EFP was similar to that observed in the EN3835 
0.06 mg group and the EN3835 0.48 mg group. No notable differences were observed 
across the
 3 treatment groups. 
 Safety findings from the  Phase 2a EFP dose-ranging study are similar to that 
observed in previous clinical studies with XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren’s 
contracture and Peyronie’s disease, in that that the majority of AEs occurred at the 
site of injection and resolved before the next scheduled treatment. 
 The immunogenicity profile of EN3835 in the Phase 2a EFP dose-ranging study is 
simil
ar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease 
programs. 
 Based on the eff icacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a EFP dose-ranging study, 
the EN3835 0.84-mg dose was carried forward to this study. 
The results from the Phase 2b EFP study (EN3835-201) further suggested that EN3835 0.84 mg 
per treatment area (quadrant) is an effective treatment of EFP based on improvement in the 
severity of cellulite as determined by the Investigator and the subject. There were no safety 
concerns following 0.84 mg in the treatment of EFP (section 8.1.3 ). Safety findings from the 
Phase 2b EFP study are s
imilar to that observed in previous clinical studies with EN3835 in the 
treatment of EFP and XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s 
disease, in that that the majority of AEs occurred at the site of injection and resolved before the 

EN3835-205 Protocol  
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 22 
   next scheduled treatment
. The immunogenicity profile of EN3835 in the Phase 2b EFP study is 
similar in previous studies and programs. 
Based on the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a and 2b EFP studies, the EN3835 
0.84-mg dose per treatment area in a region (buttocks or posterolateral thighs) warranted further 
investigation in this study. 
Treating two bilateral treatment areas of a region at each treatment visit will potentially provide a 
symmetrical-like improvement in appearance. Support for evaluation of the treatment of two 
treatment
 areas concurrently is based on: 1) the safety findings from the previous EFP studies are 
local to the injection site, 2) the pharmacological activity of EN3835 is local and does not require 
systemic exposure, and 3) no significant quantifiable systemic concentration has been 
attributable to injection of two buttocks concurrently. 
The integration of dose and use justification supports this study of evaluation of EN3835 
0.84-mg per treatment area in two treatment areas (a region) concurrently.

10.1. Study Design 
This study will be performed at approximately 10 study centers located in the United States. This 
clinical study will be conducted as a multicenter, open-label study of EN3835 in adult women 
with EFP. The study will consi
st of 3 treatment visits, 21 days apart. Subjects meeting the entry 
criteria for this study will receive EN3835 treatment within an investigational site and assigned 
region (ie, bilateral buttocks or bilateral thighs) on Day 1, Day 22, and Day 43, and will be 
followed for up to 180 days from the f
irst day of treatment. Subjects will receive follow-up visits 
at 1, 3, 6, and 13 days after each treatment course (either by phone or, for subjects participating 
in the photographic sub-study, in the clinic), and 2 follow-up visits at Day 90 and Day 180 to 
assess treatment effectiveness. The study also includes a photographic sub-study (conducted at 
two sites) in which subjects will return to the clinic for photographs at 1, 3, 6, and 13 days after 
each tre
atment course to coincide with the follow up visits. Sites participating in the 
photographic sub-study will also follow subjects for the same 180-day period.

10.2. Selection of Doses 
The dose of EN3835 chosen for this study was based on the experience from earlier studies. 

EN3835-205 Protocol  
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 25 
   The data from the Phase 2a EFP dose-
ranging study (AUX- CC-831) sugg est that EN3835 
0.84 mg is most effective in the treatment of EFP based on improvement in the severity of 
cellulite a
s determined by both the Investigator and the subject, although the EN3835 0.48-mg 
group did show improvement in some of the efficacy parameters. 
 There were no safety concerns following administration of up to 3 treatment visits of 
EN3835 0.8
4 mg in the treatment of EFP (AUX- CC-831 CSR). The safety profile of 
EN3835 0.84 
mg in the treatment of EFP was similar to that observed in the EN3835 
0.06-mg group and the EN3835 0.48-mg group. No notable differences were 
observed acro
ss the 3 treatment groups. 
 Safety findings from the  Phase 2a EFP dose-ranging study are similar to that 
observed in previous clinical studies with XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren’s 
contracture and Peyr
onie’s disease, in that the majority of AEs occurred at the site of 
injection and resolved before the next scheduled treatment. 
 The immunogenicity profile of EN3835 in the Phase 2a EFP dose-ranging study is 
simil
ar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture and Peyronie’s disease 
programs. 
 Based on the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a EFP dose-ranging study, 
the EN3835 0.84-mg dose was carried forward to a Phase 2b study (EN3835-201). 
The results from the
 Phase 2b EFP study (EN3835-201) further suggested that EN3835 0.84 mg 
is an effective treatment of EFP based on improvement in the severity of cellulite as determined 
by the Investigator and the subject. There were no safety concerns following EN3835 0.84 mg 
in the treatment of EFP (section 8.4). Safety findings from the Phase 2b EFP study are similar to 
that observed in pr
evious clinical studies with XIAFLEX in the treatment of Dupuytren’s 
contracture and Peyronie’s disease, in that that the majority of AEs occurred at the site of 
injection and resolved before the next scheduled treatment. The immunogenicity profile of 
EN3835 in the Phase 2b EFP study is similar to that observed in the Dupuytren’s contracture 
and Peyronie’s disease programs. 
Based on the efficacy and safety findings from the Phase 2a and 2b EFP studies, the EN3835 
0.84-mg dose per treatment area was carried forward to this study. The findings from previous 
studies that the m
ajority of adverse events after EN3835 treatment are local to the injection site 
and that there is no quantifiable systemic exposure observed after concurrent treatment of two 
treatment areas (total dose of 1.68 mg) supports the proposed study to evaluate EN3835 
treatment of two treatment areas. 
10.3. Study Drug Administration 
Study drug will be injected subcutaneously while the subject is in a prone position using a 
syringe with a 30-gauge ½ -inch needle. Each injection site will receive a single skin injection of 
study drug administered as three 0.1-mL aliquots to Positions A, B, and C (for a total injection 
volume of 0.3 mL) as shown in Figure 2. The depth of injection corresponds to the length of the 
treatment
 needle (0.5 inches) from the tip of the needle to the hub or base of the needle without 
downward pressure. 

EN3835-205 Protocol  
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 27 
   NOTE: EN3835 is a fore
ign protein and Investigators should be prepared to address and manage 
an allergic reaction should it occur. At the time of each injection, a 1:1,000 solution of 
epinephrine for injection, 50-mg diphenhydramine injection or a suitable equivalent, and oxygen 
must be available with the Investigator and site staff must be familiar with their use. 
10.4. Care Procedures After Injection 
To evaluate the subject for possible immediate immunological AEs, the subject will remain in 
direct observation of medical personnel who are skilled in the management of an allergic 
reaction for 30 minutes after receiving the injection of study drug and until the subject exhibits 
no sign of an immunological or other clinically significant systemic or local AE. The subject’s 
vital signs should be stable before the subject can leave direct observation (see section 14.9).  
The Investigat
or or qualified designee will then apply a sterile dressing to the injection areas 
with hypoallergenic tape. The subject will be instructed to remove the dressing in the evening. 
10.5. Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control Groups 
The design of this study was based on the primary objective to assess the safety of EN3835 
0.84 mg per treatment area in the concurrent treatment (total dose of 1.68 mg) of EFP in a 
treatment
 region (bilateral buttocks or bilateral posterolateral thigh) in adult women. It is an 
open-label study.

   11.3. Subject D
iscontinuation Criteria 
A premature discontinuation will occur when a subject who signed informed consent ceases 
participation in the study, regardless of circumstances, prior to the completion of the protocol. 
Subjects can be prematurely discontinued from the study for one of the following reasons: 
 An adverse event  
 A protocol viol ation (reason must be specified, for example: lack of compliance, use 
of a prohibited concomitant medication, failure to meet inclusion/exclusion criteria 
after study entry, etc.) 
 Withdrawal by subject (reason must be specified) 
 The subject 
was “lost to follow-up” 
 Other reasons (reason must be specified, for example: the subject moved, pregnancy, 
Investigat
or decision, Sponsor decision to terminate trial, etc.) 
If a subject discontinues from the study, all end- of-study procedures should be conducted as 
detailed in section  5, Schedule of Events. The date a subject discontinues and the reason for 
discontinua
tion will be recorded in the source documentation and Electronic Case Report Form 
(eCRF). If, however, a subject withdraws consent, no end-of-study procedures are required (but 
are encouraged to reduce missing information) except the collection of adverse event (AE) 
information. This information should be recorded in the source documentation and the eCRF. 
11.3.1. Replacement Procedures  
Subjects who discontinue from the study will not be replaced. 

EN3835-205 Protocol  
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 31 
   12. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS 
12.1. Study Visits 
The Schedule of Events to be performed at eac
h visit is shown in section 5. Provided below are 
further deta
ils where additional instruction about the assessments that will be performed is 
deemed to be needed. 
12.1.1.  Informed Consent 
Signed and dated informed consent will be obtained from each subject before any study 
procedures are undertaken. Details about how the informed consent will be obtained and 
documented are provided in section 21.3, Subject Information and Consent. 
12.1.2. Subject Screening 
Investigat
ors will be expected to maintain a Screening log of all potential study subjects. This log 
will include limited information about the potential subject and the date and outcome of the 
screening process (eg, enrolled into the study, reason for ineligibility, or refused to participate). 
Investigators will provide information about the study to subjects who appear to meet the criteria 
for participation in the study. The screening log will be captured directly by the EDC system. 
12.1.2.1.  Medical History 
During the screening period, the Investigator or qualified designee will obtain a medical history 
from each subject that includes relevant diagnoses and/or procedures/therapies with 
onset/resolutions dates. Medical histories should also include history of EFP (start date and 
family history), and history of tobacco and alcohol use (never, current, former). 
12.1.2.2.  Screening Period (Day -14 to Day -1) 
Subjects m
eeting the relevant eligibility criteria listed in section 11 may be enrolled in the study 
after the
 nature and purpose of the protocol have been explained and written informed consent to 
participate has been voluntarily provided by the subject or their legally authorized representative. 
The subject identification number will consist of 8 digits. The first 4 digits represent the study 
site number followed by a 4-digit subject number. 
The following proce
dures will be performed and documented during the screening period: 
1. Obtain written informed consent (section  12.1.1 ) 
2. Evaluat
e eligibility based on inclusion/exclusion criteria (sections  11.1 and 11.2) 
3. The Investigator will conduct live assessments of subject’s cellulite severity of the 
4 treatment areas using the CR -PCSS (section  13.1.1); the subject is blinded to these 
ratings 

EN3835-205 Protocol  
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 32 
   4. After the Investigator has completed the CR-PCSS rating, the Investigator will conduct 
live c
ellulite evaluation of the 4 treatment areas using the Hexsel CSS. The ratings from 
the CR-
PCSS and Hexsel CSS (section 13.1.3  ) will be used to assess initial eligibility of 
trea
tment areas for study entry. 
5. If eligible based on CR-PCSS, and Hexsel CSS ratings, random assignment of a 
treatment
 region (two bilateral treatment areas) for treatment (section  12.1.2.3)  
6. Medical history including EFP history (section  12.1.2.1 ) 
7. Record prior and concomitant medications/procedures (section  12.9) 
8. Physical examination including measurement of body weight, height, Fitzpatrick skin 
type (
section 14.11)  
9. Vital sign measurements (section  14. 9) 
10. 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) (section  14.10 ) 
11. Collec
tion of samples for: 
a. Clinica
l laboratory testing (section  14.7)  
b. Serum pregnancy testing (section  14.7) 
12. Adverse events (section 14) 
12.1.2.3.  Assignm
ent of Treat
ment Areas 
Subjects must have at least 1 eligible treatment region (eg, 2 bilateral treatment areas) that meet 
the following criteria for inclusion into the study: 
 CR-PCSS score of 2 or greater in each treatment area, and 
 Hexsel CSS score no greater than 13 in either treatment area. 
Assignment
 of the treatment region will be chosen randomly by the interactive web response 
system 
(IWRS) from the regions meeting the above inclusion criteria. If no two bilateral 
treatment
 areas meet the criteria, the IWRS will inform the site that the subject does not have 
treatment
 regions that qualify for the study. 
12.2. Selecting and Marking Dimples during Treatment 
Selection of dimples to be treated in the two assigned treatment areas is at the discretion of the 
Investigator. Dimples must be well-defined and evident when the subject is standing in a 
consistent relaxed pose (without the use of any manipulation such as skin pinching or muscle 
contraction). Each subject will receive 3 treatment visits of study drug unless the treatment area 
is dimple-free (score of 0 on CR-PCSS as reported by the Investigator). 
Treatment
 consists of 12 injections per treatment area (total 24 injections) per visit. Because the 
goal of treatment is to improve the aesthetic appearance of each entire treatment area, the 
Investigator will be instructed to select dimples that in his/her opinion would most improve the 
aesthetic appearance of each entire treatment area. The same dimples within a treatment area or 
different dimples within a treatment area may be treated at each visit but injections must all be 
within the assigned treat
ment area for all 3 visits. Each treatment area will receive all 3 treatment 

EN3835-205 Protocol  
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 33 
   visits unless the assigned treatment area has no tre
atable EFP dimples and the Investigator rates 
the treatment area a score of 0 on the CR-PCSS. If no injections in a particular treatment area are 
given at Treatment Visit 2, subjects will still be assessed for treatment in the contralateral 
treatment area at Treatment Visit 2, and will return for the Day 43 visit and the assigned 
treatment
 areas will again be evaluated by the Investigator (CR-PCSS). If the Investigator rates 
either or both of the assigned treatment areas greater than 0 on the CR-PCSS, injections at 
Treatment Visit 3 should be given. 
At each treatment visit, prior to selecting and marking dimples, sites participating in the 
photography sub-study should photograph the selected treatment areas. For each dimple selected 
for treatment, the Investigator or qualified designee will choose injection sites (injection sites 
within a dimple should be spaced approximately 2 cm apart, if a dimple requires more than 
1 injection; locating at least one injection site at the nadir, if present, of the dimple). Each 
injection site wil
l be marked with a “dot” using a surgical marker. For round dimples, the “dot” 
will be placed in the center of the dimple; for elongated dimples, “dots” will be spaced out 
approximately 2 cm along the longer axis of the dimple. The Investigator or qualified designee 
will then use a surgical marker to circle each of the dimples selected for treatment. Circles in the 
assigned treatment area should not overlap (Figure 3 ). Sites participating in the photographic 
sub
-study (section 12.12 ) will be instructed to obtain photographs of the subject’s marked 
treatment areas prior to injection on the visit days that require treatment (section 5).

anticoagulants (warfarin, heparin, direct thrombin inhibitors, Factor X inhibitors) and antiplatelet 
agents (aspirin >150 mg/day and P2Y12 inhibitors, such as clopidogrel), which can cause 
additional bruising. However the use of aspirin at a dose level of ≤150 mg per day will be 
permitted during study. 

EN3835-205 Protocol  
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 37 
   Procedures listed 
in exclusion criterion #4 (section 11.2, Exclusion Criterion# 4) are prohibited 
for subjects during th
e study. 
Table 4: Concomitant Medication Restrictions for Subjects During the Treatment 
Phase of Study 
Drug Class  Restrictions  
Anticoagulants  Subjects cannot take antiplatelet agents or anticoagulants (except for ≤150  mg aspirin daily) 
within 7  days before and 7 days after the dosing administration.  
12.10.  Treatment Compliance 
Subjects will receive study drug administered by an Investigator at the Investigator’s site.  
Accidental or i
ntentional overdoses should be reported to the Sponsor/designee promptly (see 
section 14.6.2.1, Overdose). 
12.11.  Blind
ing and Randomization 
This is an open-label study. Each subject will have one or two regions (bilateral buttocks and/or 
thighs) eligible for treatment. If two regions are eligible, the IWRS will randomly assign each 
subject a treatment region. 
12.12.  Photographic Sub- study  
Two (2) or more sites will participate in a photographic sub-study designed to capture 
photographic reco
rds of subjects’ progression through the study treatment. In the sub-study, the 
treatment areas will be photographed before and after dimple marking while the subject is 
standing in a consistent relaxed pose as described in the Photography Manual. Subjects will be 
instructed to return to the clinic for follow-up photographs at 1, 3, 6, and 13 days after each 
treatment
 visit. 
12.13.  Medical Status Follow-up 
Subjects will be contacted (either by telephone, or in person for subjects participating in the 
Photographic Sub-study) at 1, 4, 8, and 14 days after each treatment visit to provide updates on 
their medical status following treatment. Specific updates to medical status will include: 
1. Any changes in concomit ant medications or procedures 
2. Injection site reactions and local tolerability 
3. Adverse events (section 14)

   13. ASSESSMENT OF EFFEC
TIVENESS 
13.1. Effectiveness Measurements 
13.1.1.  Clinician-Reported Photonumeric Cellulite Severity Scale (CR-PCSS) 
The CR-PCSS will be conducted for the purpose of assessing the severity of cellulite in the 
buttock or thigh; there are separate scales for buttocks or thighs. The scales are 5-level 
photonumeric scales developed specifically for clinicians and used by the Investigator to assess 
the severity of the subject’s cellulite in each treatment area by live assessments; the ratings range 
from 0 (None) to 4 (Severe) with labels and descriptors to aid the Investigator in the assessments. 
Investigators will be trained and qualified on the use of the CR-PCSS p rior to assessing any 
subjects. 
At the Screening visit, the Investigator will determine severity of cellulite of each of the 
4 treatment areas by assessing subjects using the CR-PCSS for buttock ( Appendix B) or thigh 
(Appendix C ). Before injections on treatment visits Day  1, Day 22, and Day 43, and on vis it 
Day 90 and Day
 180, Investigators will evaluate each of the two assigned treatment areas via live 
assessm
ent. If the buttocks are the treated region, the Investigator will use the CR-PCSS for the 
buttock to make his/her evaluation; if the thighs are the treated region, the Investigator will use 
the CR-
PCSS for the thigh to make his/her evaluation. 
13.1.2.  Subject Satisfaction with Cellulite Treatment Assessment 
At the Day 180 visit, subjects will be instructed to answer a question related to their treated 
region. Subjects will be given one list of region-specific responses based on which region was 
treated and th
ey will provide a rating from those below that best represents their answer. 
For subjects that had buttocks treated: 
Today, how satisfied are you with the results of the cellulite treatment you received on the 
specific area or areas on your buttocks that were treated?

-2 I am very dissatisfied with the cellulite treatment on my thighs.  
13.1.3.  Hexsel Cellulite Severity Scale 
The Hexsel Cellulite Severity Scale (referred to as the Hexsel CSS) is a photonumeric scale that 
looks at 5 key morphologic features of cellulite: (A) number of evident depressions, (B) depth of 
depressions, (C) morphological appearance of skin surface alterations, (D) laxity, flaccidity or 
sagging of skin, and (E) current classification scale based on medical literature including 
Nürnberger and Müller.( 12,13) Each of these features is evaluated on a 4-level scale from a low 
of 0 to a hig
h of 3 as described in Table  7  (Appendix D  a nd Appendix E). The total score is the 
summation of all 5 features. 
The Investigator or qualified designee will independently use the Hexsel CSS to assess the 
severity of EFP in each of the 4 treatment areas at the Screening visit and each of the two 
assigned treatment areas on Day 1. All cellulite assessments should be made while the subject is 
in the standing position with relaxed gluteus muscles. However, when evaluating the subject for 
Category E (classification scale by Nürnberger and Müller) ( 13) if the subject has no evident 
depressions, the subject should be asked to contract her gluteus muscles or the pinch test should 
be applied (by pinching the skin between the thumb and index finger) so the Investigator or 
qualified designee can differentiate between scores/grades of zero (0) or I.

the skin surface can be seen by pinching the skin or with muscle 
contraction.  
2= second grade = Grade or Stage II = The orange skin or mattress 
appearance is evident when standing, without the use of any 
manipulation (skin pinching or muscle contraction).  
3= third grade = Grade or Stage III = The alterations described in 
Grade or Stage II, are present together with raised areas and 
nodules.

a Subjects should be evaluated in the standing position with relaxed gluteus muscles. However, if the subject has no 
evident depressions, they should be asked to contract their gluteus muscles or the pinch test should be applied (by 
pinching the skin between the thumb and index finger) in order to differentiate between grade/stage of zero (0) 
or I.

   14. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY
 
14.1. Definitions 
14.1.1.  Adverse Events 
An adverse event (AE) is any unfavorable or unintended change in body structure (signs), body 
function (symptoms), laboratory result (eg, chemistry, ECG, X-ray, etc.), or worsening of a pre-
existing condit
ion associated temporally with the use of the study medication whether or not 
considered related to the study medication. Adverse events will be captured once a subject has 
signed the informed consent. AEs include: 
 Changes in the gener al condition of the subject 
 Subjective symptoms offered by or elicited from the subject 
 Object
ive signs observed by the Investigator or other study personnel 
 All c
oncurrent diseases t hat occur after the start of the study, including any change in 
severity or frequency of pre-existing disease 
 All clinically relevant laboratory abnormalities or physical findings that occur during 
the study
 
A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is any condition that was not present prior to treatment with 
study medication but appeared following treatment, was present at treatment initiation but 
worsened during treatment, or was present at treatment initiation but resolved and then 
reappeared while the individual was on treatment (regardless of the intensity of the AE when the 
treatment was initiated). 
All AEs, including both observed or volunteered problems, complaints, signs or symptoms must 
be recorded on the AE page of the eCRF, regardless of whether associated with the use of study 
medicat
ion. This would include AEs resulting from concurrent illness, reactions to concurrent 
medication use, or progression of disease states (excluding the disease under study). A condition 
present at baseline that worsens after initiation of study treatment will be captured as an AE; the 
onset date will be the date the event worsened. The AE should be recorded in standard medical 
terminology when possible. 
14.1.2. Serious Adverse Events 
A serious ad
verse event (SAE) is defined as an AE that: 
 Results in death 
 Is immediately life-threatening (there is an immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred; this does not include an AE that had it occurred in a more serious form may 
have caused death) 
 Results in or prolongs an inpatient hospitalization (Note: a hospitalization for elective 
or pre-planned surgery, procedure, or drug therapy does not constitute an SAE)  

EN3835-205 Protocol  
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 42 
    Results in permanent or substantial disability (permanent or substantial disruption of 
one’s ability
 to conduct normal life functions)  
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect (in offspring of a subject using the study 
medi
cation regardless of time to diagnosis) 
 Is considered an important medical event 
Import
ant medical events are defined as events that, based upon appropriate medical judgment, 
may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the 
other serious outcomes. Examples of important medical events include malignancy, allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias 
or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.  
14.2. Monitoring Adverse Events 
At each visit, subjects will be queried regarding any AEs that have occurred since the last visit. 
Subjects will be asked to volunteer information concerning AEs with a non-leading question 
such as, “How do you feel?” Study site personnel will then record all pertinent information in the 
source documents and the eCRF. The study drug compliance record should also be reviewed to 
detect potential overdoses (intentional/unintentional). 
14.3. Relationship to Study Drug 
The degree of “relatedness” of the AE to the study medication must be described using the 
following scale:  
 Not related  indicates that the AE is definitely not related to the study medication. 
 Unlikely related  indicates that there are other, more likely causes and study 
medication is not suspected as a cause. 
 Possibly related indicates that a direct  cause and effect relationship between study 
medication and the AE has not been demonstrated, but there is evidence to suggest 
there is a reasonable possibility that the event was caused by the study medication. 
 Probably related  indicates that there is evidence suggesting a direct cause and effect 
relationship between the AE and the study medication. 
It is the Sponsor’s policy to consider “Probably related” and “Possibly related” causality 
assessments as positive causality. “Not related” and “Unlikely related” causality assessments are 
considered as negative causality. 
Assessments will be recorded on the eCRF and must indicate clearly the relationship being 
assessed. For example, an AE that appears during a placebo run-in phase would be assessed with 
respect to the placebo treatment received and/or study procedures conducted during this phase. If 
the AE continued into an active treatment phase, the relationship would be assessed for the active 
treatment phase only if the AE worsened. 

EN3835-205 Protocol  
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 43 
   14.4. Intensity 
Assessment 
The intensity (or severity) of AEs is characterized as mild, moderate, or severe: 
 Mild  AEs are usually transient, requiring no special treatment, and do not interfere 
with the subject’s daily activities. 
 Moderate  AEs introduce a low level of inconvenience or concern to the subject and 
may i
nterfere with daily activities, but are usually ameliorated by simple therapeutic 
measures. 
 Severe  AEs interrupt a subject’s usual daily activity and typically require systemic 
drug therapy or ot
her treatment. 
When the intensity category of an AE changes, the greatest intensity during that continuous 
episode should be recorded.  
14.5. Reporting Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events 
14.5.1. Reporting Advers e Events 
Throughout the study, AEs will be documented on the source document and on the appropriate 
page of the eCRF whether or not considered treatment-related. This includes any new signs, 
symptoms, injury or illness, including increased severity of previously existing signs, symptoms, 
injury, or illness. Conditions existing prior to screening will be recorded as part of the subject’s 
medical history. The Investigator is responsible for assessing the relationship of AEs to the study 
medication; relationship will be classified as not related, unlikely related, possibly related, or 
probably related.  
All AEs will be collected by the Investigator from the time of signing the informed consent 
through 28 days after the last dose of study medication; this includes any AEs that are ongoing at 
the time of completion/termination of the study. All ongoing AEs must be followed until 
resolution or for 30 days after the subject’s last study visit, whichever comes first. 
14.5.2. Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
Any SAE, incl
uding death resulting from any cause, which occurs to any subject participating in 
this study must be reported via email or fax by the Investigator using the Endo Clinical Trial 
Report Form for SAEs within 24 hours of first becoming aware of the SAE. SAEs will be 
collected by the Investigator from the time of signing the informed consent through 28 days after 
the last dose of study medication. SAEs that occur within 28 days, following cessation of the 
study treatment, or within 30 days, following premature discontinuation from the study for any 
reason, must also be reported within the same timeframe. Any SAE that is felt by the Investigator 
to be related to the study medication must be reported regardless of the amount of time since the 
last dose received. Follow-up information collected for any initial report of an SAE must also be 
reported to the Sponsor within 24 hours of receipt by the Investigator.  
All SAEs will be
 followed until resolution, stabilization of condition, or until follow-up is no 
longer possible. 

EN3835-205 Protocol  
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 45 
   14.6.3. Pregnancy 
Subjects sho
uld be instructed to immediately notify the Investigator of any pregnancies. 
Any pregnancy that o
ccurs in a subject during this clinical study will be reported for t racking 
purposes only . All subject pregnancies that are identified during or after this study, where the 
estimated date of conception is determined to have occurred during study drug therapy or within 
28 days of the last dose of study medication need to be reported, followed to conclusion, and the 
outcome reported, even if the subject is discontinued from the study.  The Investigator should 
report all pregnancies within 24 hours using the Initial Pregnancy Report Form, and any 
pregnancy-associated SAE using the SAE report form, according to the usual timelines and 
directions for SAE reporting provided in section 14.5.2 . Monitoring of the pregnancy should 
continue un
til conclusion of the pregnancy; 1 or more Follow-up Pregnancy Report Form(s) 
detailing progress, and a Two-Month Follow-up Pregnancy Report Form detailing the outcome, 
should be sub
mitted. 
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is suspicion that the investigational 
product under study may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication. 
Likewise, elective abortions without complications are not considered AEs. Any SAEs 
associated with pregnancy (eg, congenital abnormalities/birth defects/spontaneous miscarriages 
or any other ser
ious events) must additionally be reported as such using the SAE report form. 
Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs. 
A subject who becomes pregnant must be withdrawn from the study . Attempts to obtain the 
pregnancy follow-up and pregnancy outcome information detailed above are necessary even if a 
subject discontinues treatment because of pregnancy. 
14.6.4. AEs/SAEs Experienced by Non-subjects Exposed to Study Medication 
Non-
subjects are persons who are not enrolled in the study but have been exposed to study 
medication, including instances of diversion of study medication. All such AEs/SAEs occurring 
in non-subjects from such exposure will be reported to the Endo PVRM Department (when the 
non-subject agrees) on the departmental form for serious adverse experiences regardless of 
whether the 
event is serious or not. Instructions for completing the form for events experienced 
by non-subjects will be provided. SAEs occurring in non-subjects exposed to study medication 
will be processed wit
hin the same SAE reporting timelines as described in section  14.5.2, 
Reporting Ser
ious Adverse Events. Additionally, the drug accountability source documentation 
at the site should reflect this occurrence. 
14.7. Clinical Laboratory Determinations 
Clinical laboratory tests will be conducted according to the Schedule of Events (section 5). 
Clinical laboratory 
tests will be performed by a designated central laboratory . Each site will be 
provided with
 instructions on specimen collection, preparation, packaging and transport. Refer to 
the central laboratory manual for further information regarding sample collection, handling, and 
labeling. The results of the tests will be returned to the investigational sites.  

EN3835-205 Protocol 
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 46 
 Clinical laboratory tes
t data will be reviewed by the Investigator, or designee, and additional 
clinical laboratory tests may be ordered at his/her discretion (eg, if the results of any clinical 
laboratory test falls outside the reference range or clinical symptoms necessitate additional 
testing to ensure safety). Any additional testing will be performed by the designated central 
laboratory. The Investigator or qualified designee must acknowledge the review of laboratory 
results. 
The Investigator will review all abnormal lab results for potentially clinically important. Any 
abnormal
 clinical laboratory test result meeting the Investigator’s criteria for potentially 
clinically important (refer to central laboratory manual) will be recorded as an AE or SAE as 
appropriate (see section 14.1.1 , Adverse Events, and section 14.1.2 , Serious Adverse Events). 
Laboratory results will be sent electronically to Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. for data management. 
Clinical laboratory parameters that will be measured in this study are listed in Table 8.

tion 
A complete physical examination will be performed at the Screening Visit. All examinations will 
be performed by a physician or health professional listed on the Form FDA 1572 and licensed to 
perform physical examinations. Height and body weight will be measured and recorded at 
screening. 
The Investigator will review all physical exam findings for clinical significance. Any physical 
exam finding 
meeting the Investigator’s or Sponsor’s criteria for clinical significance will be 
recorded as an AE or SAE as appropriate (see section  14.1.1, Adverse Events and section  14.1.2, 
Serious Adver
se Events). 
At screening, the Investigator will also assess the subject’s skin type using the Fitzpatrick scale 
(Table 10). Only the Fitzpatrick Scale shown below may be used during the study.

medical and surgical history, and other baseline characteristics relevant to the indication studied 
in the study will be presented. 

EN3835-205 Protocol  
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 52 
   Demographic char
acteristics, including sex, age, age group, race, height, and weight, will be 
summarized by assigned region and overall, for Safety and Effectiveness Populations, using 
appropriate descriptive statistics. The descriptive summaries will include frequency tables for all 
categorical response variables and n, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum and 
maximum for all continuous variables. 
17.5. Effectiveness Analyses  
17.5.1.  Effectiveness Variables 
 Proportion at each level of improvement in the CR- PCSS of e ach assigned treatment 
area (Day 22, Day 43, Day 90, and Day 180): 
 Proportion o
f responders defined as subjects with an improvement in severity 
from baseline of at least 2 levels of severity in the CR-PCSS 
 Proportion of responders defined as subjects with an improvement in severity 
from baseline of at least 1 level of severity in the CR-PCSS 
 Proportion of responses at each level of the subject satisfaction with cellulite 
treatm
ent (Day 180) 
All effect
iveness variables will be summarized as the number and percentages. 
Mean and standard dev
iation for changes in CR-PCSS from baseline will be summarized. 
17.6. Safety Analyses 
Safety variables include adverse events, laboratory parameters, vital signs, ECG (screening 
only), and physical examination. For each safety parameter, the last assessment made prior to the 
first dose of study drug will be used as the baseline for all analyses of that safety parameter. 
17.6.1.  Prior, Concomitant, and Follow-up Medication 
The World Health Organization (WHO) Drug Dictionary will be used to classify prior and 
concomitant medications by therapeutic class. Prior medication will be defined as any 
medication taken prior to the first dose of study drug. Concomitant medication is defined as any 
medication taken on or after the date of first dose of study drug. 
Prior and concom
itant medication use will be summarized descriptively by the number and 
percentage of subjects for each preferred term (generic name from WHO dictionary) by 
treatment. Multiple use of the same medication by a subject will be counted only once. 
17.6.2.  Study Drug Exposure 
The following information regarding treatment will be summarized per each treated area: 
 Total number of treatment visits 
 Number of subjects who had treatment visit done or treatment visit not done at each 
treatm
ent day 

EN3835-205 Protocol  
31-Aug-2017 Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Page 53 
    For subjects who had the treatment visit done, the number of subjects who got all 
12 injection
s per treatment area 
 Number of injections given at each treatment visit 
 Nu
mber of dimples treated at each treatment visit 
 Average num
ber of injectio ns per dimple at each treatment visit 
Subjects who did not
 receive all three treatment visits and who did not receive a total of 
24 injections at a treatment visit will be listed. 
17.6.3. Measurement of Treatment Compliance 
Not applic
able (The study drug is administered at the site by the study Investigator). 
17.6.4. Adverse Events 
The Medical
 Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) will be used to code AEs. 
An AE (classified by preferred term) that started on or after the date of the first dose of the study 
drug will be considered a TEAE if it was not present prior to the first dose of study drug, or was 
present prior to the first dose of study drug but increased in intensity during the treatment period. 
If more than 1 AE is reported prior to the first dose of study drug and coded to the same 
preferred term, then the AE with the greatest intensity will be used as the benchmark for 
comparison to the AEs occurring during the treatment period which were also coded to that 
preferred term. Any AE present prior to the first dose of study drug that increases in intensity 
during the treat
ment period will be re-entered with a new start date of the date of increased 
intensity. 
Descriptive statistics (the number and percentage) for subjects reporting TEAEs will be tabulated 
by system organ class and preferred term; by system organ class, preferred term, and severity; 
and by system organ class, preferred term, and relationship to study drug. If more than 1 AE is 
coded to the same preferred term for the same subject, the subject will be counted only once for 
that preferred term using the most severe and most related occurrence for the summarization by 
severity and by relationship to the study drug. 
Listings will be presented for all subjects. Additionally, listings will be presented for subjects 
with SAEs, subjects with AEs leading to discontinuation of study or study drug, and subjects 
who die (if any). 
17.6.5. Vital Signs 
Descriptive statistics for 
vital signs (eg, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate, and 
body weight) and their changes from baseline at each visit and at the end of study will be 
presented. Vital signs listings for all subjects will be provided. 
Vital sign values are potentially clinically important (PCI) if they meet both the observed value 
criteria and the change from baseline criteria. The criteria for PCI vital sign values will be 
detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The PCI percentages will be calculated relative to 
the number of subjects with baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. A supportive

clinical laboratory values in International System of Units (SI units) and 
changes from baseline at Day 180 will be presented for each clinical laboratory parameter. 
Listings for clinical laboratory values for all subjects will be provided. 
The number 
and percentage of subjects with potentially clinically important (PCI) post-baseline 
clinical laboratory values will be tabulated. The criteria for PCI laboratory values will be detailed 
in the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP). The PCI percentages will be calculated relative to the 
number of subjects with at least one post-baseline assessment. A supportive listing of subjects 
with post-baseline PCI values will be provided, including the subject ID, study center, baseline 
and post-baseline values. 
17.6.7. Electrocardiogram

   20. QUALITY CONTROL AND 
QUALITY ASSURANCE 
Steps to assure the accuracy and reliability of data include the selection of qualified principal 
investigators and appropriate study centers, review of protocol procedures with the principal 
investigators and associated personnel prior to start of the study, and periodic monitoring visits 
conducted by the Sponsor or Sponsor representative. Significant and/or repeated non-compliance 
will be investigated and remedial action instituted when appropriate. Failure to comply with 
remedial actions may result in investigator site termination and regulatory authority notification. 
The Sponsor or its designee will utilize qualified monitors to review and evaluate activities 
conducted at Investigator sites. 
The data will be entered into the clinical study database and verified for accuracy, following 
procedures defined by the Sponsor (or designee). Data will be processed and analyzed following 
procedures defined by the Sponsor (or designee). 
The study will be monitored and/or audited at intervals to ensure that the clinical study is 
conducted and data are generated, documented (recorded), and reported in compliance with the 
Study Protocol; International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH), E6 consolidated guidelines; 
and other applicable regulations. The extent, nature, and frequency of monitoring and/or audits 
will be based on such considerations as the study objectives and/or endpoints, the purpose of the 
study, study design complexity, and enrollment rate. At the conclusion of a program, a 
compliance statement will be generated by the Sponsor (or designee) listing all audit activities 
performed during the clinical study.

   21. ETHICS 
21.1. Ethics Revie
w 
Approval by the IRB/IEC prior to the start of the study will be the responsibility of the 
Investigator. A copy of approval documentation will be supplied to Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
along with a roster of IRB members that demonstrates appropriate composition (a Department of 
Health and Human Services [DHHS] Assurance Number will satisfy this requirement). 
The study protocol, the informed consent form, advertisements, materials being provided to 
subjects and amendments (if any) will be approved to IRB/IECs at each study center in 
conformance with ICH E6, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 21, Part 56 and any 
other applicable local laws. The Investigator is responsible for supplying the IRB/IEC with a 
copy of the current IB, Package Insert, or SPC as well as any updates issued during the study. 
During the course of the study, the Investigator will provide timely and accurate reports to the 
IRB/IEC on the progress of the study, at intervals not exceeding 1 year (or as appropriate), and 
will notify the IRB/IEC of SAEs or other significant safety findings, per the policy of the 
IRB/IEC. At the conclusion of
 the study, the Investigator will submit a final report or close out 
report to the IRB/IEC and provide a copy to Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
Any amendment to this protocol will be provided to the Investigator in writing by Endo 
Pharmaceuticals Inc. No protocol amendment may be implemented (with the exceptions noted 
below) before it has been approved by the IRB and the signature page, signed by the 
Investigator, has been received by Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. Where the protocol is amended to 
eliminate or reduce the risk to the subject, the amendment may be implemented before IRB 
review and approval. However, the IRB must be informed in writing of such an amendment and 
approval obtained within reasonable time limits. Deviating from the protocol is permitted only if 
absolutely necessary for the safety or clinical management of the subject, and must be 
immediately reported to Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
The Investigator will be responsible for supplying updated safety and/or study information to 
study subjects as it becomes available.

   22. DATA HANDLING AND REC
ORDKEEPING 
22.1. Data Collection 
Endo will provide an electronic data capture (EDC) system for this study. Data collection will 
involve the use of an EDC system to which only authorized personnel will have access. The 
system will be secured to prevent unauthorized access to the data or the system. This will include 
the requirement for a user ID and password to enter or change data. The level of access to the 
EDC system will be dependent on the person’s role in the study. 
Study data will be collected from source documents and entered into an eCRF within the EDC 
system. The Investigator will be responsible for ensuring the eCRFs are completed in a timely 
manner relative to the subject’s visit. In addition to periodic monitoring occurring within the 
system by a Sponsor monitor, programmatic edit checks will be used to review EDC data for 
completeness, logic, and adherence to the study protocol. As a result of this monitoring and these 
checks, queries may be issued electronically to the clinical study sites and closed electronically 
by the monitor, data management staff or authorized staff at the study site. Additionally, the 
Investigator will review eCRFs, ensure all missing or corrected data is provided and will sign the 
eCRF pages with an electronic signature. 
An electronic audit trail will be maintained in the EDC system to track all changes made to data 
entered in the eCRF. Data will be retrievable in such a fashion that all information regarding 
each individual subject is attributable to that subject. Unless otherwise indicated, all data 
captured in the eCRF must first be captured in source documents. Data that can be directly 
recorded in the eCRF will be clearly identified in the section(s) of the protocol that describes the 
assessment(s). 
Data entries will be corrected by changing the entry in the EDC system. Any changes or 
corrections to eCRF data will be electronically tracked and will include the reason for correction, 
who made the correction and the date/time stamp when the correction was made within the audit 
trail of the EDC system.  
In addition, any contact with the subject via telephone or other means that provide significant 
clinical information must be documented in source documents as described above. 
22.2. Study Documentation 
Upon study completion, the Investigator will be provided with complete electronic copies of the 
CRF data for his/her files.

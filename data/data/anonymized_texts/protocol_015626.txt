4. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
During aging, the skin undergoes significant changes that are often characterized by dermal 
thinning, redistribution of fat,  and loss of skin elasticity and collagen.1, 2 Various factors can 
considerably  accelerate this  aging process, including environmental exposure, leading to rhytids, 
wrinkles, and skin laxity. There has been an increase in popularity of soft -tissue injectables as 
they are non- invasive and are effective for restoring lost volume and for correcting contour 
deficiencies to the aging face.3 Among them  are two well- known injectable  agents : Sculptra® 
(Galderma, New Jersey , USA) and Radiesse® (+) (Merz  Pharmaceutical , Wisconsin , USA ). 
Sculptra® is a poly-L-lactic acid (PLLA)  biostimulator  and Radiesse® (+) is a calcium 
hydroxylapatite (CaHA)  filler. Both treatments are currently FDA -approved in the United States 
for correction of facial wrinkles and folds. Both provide a delayed but progressive volumizing effect 
by stimulating the regeneration of endogenous collagen overtime .4, 5   
As such, a similar mechanism of action of these injectables  represents an interesting line of 
examination, particularly in the context of  cellular  activities occurring  at the genomic level  that 
contributes to neocollagenesis and potentially other structural integrity of the extracellular matrix. This study is  conducted to examine the effect of  PLLA and CaHA  injectables  in the treatment of 
nasolabial folds (NLFs) .  
5. STUDY OBJECTIVE S AND CLINICAL HYPOTHESIS  
5.1 Study Objectives   
The primary o bjective of this study is to compare gene expression stimulated by a semi -
permanent filler and a biostimulator via punch biopsy . 
The secondary objective of this study is to assess and compare volume c hange in the NLF 
via clinical photography.  
5.2 Clinical Hypothesis  
When each treatment is injected to the skin, it tri ggers a series of biochemical reactions  
and inflammatory responses that contribute  to the production of collagen and other protein 
structures in the extracellular matrix . The result is an aesthetic  increase in skin volume at 
the treated facial area.  
6. SELECTION AND DISPOSITION OF STUDY POPULATION

This document contains confidential, proprietary information.  
7.5 M ethod of Treatment Assignment  
Before the start of the study, a randomization list will be p repared by the Sponsor ut ilizing a 
computer -generated software. This will randomly assign the study product to each enrolled 
subject and the NLF side for punch biopsy.  
7.6 T reatment  Dosage and Mode of Administration 
The injection technique (skin disinfection material, type of syringe, type and gauge of the 
intradermal needle, penetration angle, depth) will be the technique customarily used by the 
Investigator . The type of gauge of the injection needle will be recorded  in the CRFs.  
PLLA : two  treatment sessions at 4-week interval  with the first treatment at Visit 1  and the second 
treatment at Visit 3. Each treatment session will be consisted of multiple deep dermal injections, 
up to 9 mL/session ( or up to  4.5 mL/ NLF/session), into the left and right NLFs  of each subject  
according to the IFU.  The treatment amount for each PLLA subject will be determined at  the 
Investigator discretion to achieve an optimal correction. Within each PLLA subject, t he amount of 
each treatment needs to be equal at the left and right NLFs because of the identical WAS scores. 
The treatment volume injected during each treatment session for each subject will be recorded in the CRFs .  
CaHA :
 up to two treatment sessions at 4 -week interval  with the required first treatment at Visit 1 
and an optional  second  treatment at Visit 3  to achieve an optimal cosmetic correction. Each 
treatment session will be consisted of multiple subdermal injections , up to 1.5 mL/session (or up 
to 0.75 mL/NLF/session) , into the left and right NLFs  of each subject according to the IFU. The 
second treatment is optional and will be determined based on the I nvestigator  assessment. If the 
subject needs a second treatment,  an appropriate amount will be determined at the Investigator  
discretion to achieve an  optimal outcome . The amount of each treatment needs to be equal at the 
left and right NLFs because of the identical WAS score s. The treatment  volume injected during 
each treatment session for each subject  will be recorded in the CRFs.  
8. TREATMENT OF SUBJECTS  
8.1 Informed Consent Form  
An IRB -approved informed consent form (ICF)  will be given to each prospective subject before 
participation in any study procedures. Prospective subjects will be given as much time as needed to read the ICF and will have the opportunity to have any study -related questions answered to 
their satisfaction prior to signing the ICF. If further questions exist, prospective subjects will be 
given sufficient time during the visit to have questions regarding the study  and/or the ICF 
answered by the Investigator  or study coordinator prior to signing.  
8.2 Subject Identification  
Enrolled subjects will be assigned a number that will uniquely identity every subject on the study. 
The numbers will remain with the subject throughout the study and should be used in all references to the individual in this study.  
8.3 Subject Instructions for the Study  
Subjects must show up to the study site with clean face  without any makeup. Male subjects with 
facial hair must shave prior to any study visit.

10. STUDY ASSESSMENTS 
All images taken from the study will be saved and  shared to the Sponsor via a data -protected 
platform . 
10.1 Wrinkle Assessment Scale  
Clinical grading of NLF will be performed at baseline for screening purpose. The grading will be 
based on a 6- point  Wrinkle Assessment Scale6 according to the numerical definitions (describe 
in Figure 1 below).  
 0 = no visible, minimal wrinkles  
 1 = just perceptible wrinkles  
 2 = shallow, visible wrinkles with a slight indentation 
 3 = moderately deep wrinkles  
 4 = deep wrinkles, well -defined f olds 
 5 = very deep wrinkles, redundant folds  
 
Figure 1. Wrinkle Assessment Scale of nasolabial folds  
10.2 Clinical Photography  (Cherry Imaging)  
Three (3) dimensional images of the subject’s face will be taken at baseline/day 0 (pre-biopsy and 
pre-treatment ), day 28  (pre-treatment), and day 84 (pre-biopsy) . 

  Page 18 of 27 
Protocol GLI.04. US.SL .020 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Version : 04 
This document contains confidential, proprietary information.  
Clinic staff needs to ensure subjects to have a clean face with no makeup, no facial hair,  and to 
remove any jewelry from the area to be photographed. Subjects will be provided with a headband 
to keep hair away from the face. Subjects will be instructed to adopt neutral, nonsmiling 
expression with their eyes gently closed, and in a relaxed posi tioned for each scan.  
A total of three  3D images will be taken of each subject’s face using the Cherry Imaging device 
(Cherry Imaging, Israel). The Cherry Imaging relies on multi -directional illumination and computer -
aided reconstruction of the skin surface in 3D.  
Change in volume on each NLF  will be analyzed by the Cherry Imaging software . 
10.3 Punch Biopsy Collection and Analysis  
At baseline/day 0 and day 84, subjects will participate in a 3-mm punch biopsy procedure (post -
photography and pre- treatment) . Each subject will have 1 biopsy at one side of the NLF (based 
on the pre -determined randomization) at baseline and 1 biopsy at the other side of the NLF at day 
84; total of 2 biopsies per subject  at both timepoints.  
Biops ies will be obtained using standar d sterile technique after an intradermal local anesthesia 
and treated with topical antibiotic and sterile dressing in routine fashion  (see Appendix I: Biopsy 
Procedure and Post -Care) .  
The biops y specimens  will be immediately transferred into RNAlater  solution and stored at room 
temperature  for 4 hours  and then moved to 4°C. Collected biopsy samples will be sent to the 
following address for  gene expression analysis  on icepack  (4°C). 
The biopsy sample will contain the subject number/identification (baseline and day 84) , product 
information, and any other relevant information needed to identify the samples post -analysis.

Gene expression analysis will be performed via qPCR processing using a panel  of biomarkers 
related to scar tissue formation, collagen, elastin, extracellular matrix integrity, epidermal barrier, 
anti-aging, antioxidant, cell renewal/regeneration, inflammation, growth factor,  and hydration  
among others . 
11. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
Data of completing subjects will be included for all statistical analyses.  Descriptive statistical 
summary will be performed including N , mean, median, standard deviations, minimum, and 
maximum of values at all applicable time points and for both treatments.  
Comparison between the study treatments will be made in terms of changes from baseline. The 
null hypothesis , that the mean change from baseline is equal between the 2 study treatments at 
post-baseline time point, will be tested using methods described in the Statistical Analysis Plan 
table.

12. ADVERSE EVENTS  
Throughout the course of the study, all adverse events will be monitored and reported on an 
adverse event CRF/ eCRF without omitting any requested and known information. When AEs 
occur, the main concern is the safety of the study subjects . At time of the informed consent 
signature, each subject must be given the name and phone number of investigational site 
personnel for reporting AEs and medical emergencies.  
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity to spontaneously mention any problems, 
the Investigator  should inquire about AEs by asking the standard questions:  
• “Have you had any health problems since your last study visit?”  
• “Have there been any changes in the medicines you take since your last study visit?”  
AEs should be reported for any clinically relevant change, as determined by the Investigator , in 
concomitant medication(s) that is the result of an untoward (unfavorable and unintended) change 
from baseline in a subject's medical health following exposure to the study treatment.  
Changes from baseline in any protocol -specific parameter evaluated during the study are to be 
reviewed by the Investigator . In addition, the subject’s responses to any questionnaire utilized 
during the study are to be reviewed by the Investigator . Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change from baseline in a protocol -specific parameter or question response that is 
clinically relevant, in the opinion of the Investigator , is to be reported as an AE. These clinically 
relevant changes will be re ported regardless of causality.  
12.1 Definitions  
12.1.1.  Adverse Events (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject taking part in the clinical study, and which does not necessarily require a causal relationship w ith the 
investigational product and/or a clinical trial procedure.  
An AE can be any unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory value), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of the investigational product, whether 
or not related to this product.  
When an AE has a likely or very likely causal relationship with the investigational product and/or 
a clinical trial procedure, it is named undesirable effect or related AE (see Section 3).

Protocol GLI.04. US.SL .020 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Version : 04 
This document contains confidential, proprietary information.  
12.1.2.  Local tolerability signs and symptoms (only applicable for cosmetic safety studies)  
In cosmetic studies, local skin tolerability includes some expected functional and/or physical signs 
on the application area, observed by the Investigator  or reported by the subjects. Those signs are 
collected in the final report based on scales or a diary. If the severity of a local skin tolerability 
sign or symptom, is such that the product application is permanently discontinued and/or a 
corrective concomitant treatment (except moisturizer or emollient) is prescribed, it is recorded as 
an undesirable effect (related AE). 
12.1.3.  Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  and serious undesirable effect/related SAE  
A serious adverse event (SAE) involves a serious injury that is life threatening, results in 
permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body structure or 
necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body function 
or permanent damage to a body structure, requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of an 
existing hospitalization.  
Notes:  
The term “immediate vital risk” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it 
was more severe.  
Inpatient hospitalization is considered to have occurred if the subject has had to stay for a night at the hospital.  Hospitalization solely for the purpose of a diagnostic test (even if related to an AE), elec tive hospitalization for an intervention that was already planned before subject enrolment 
in the clinical trial, admission to a day -care facility, social admission (e.g., if the subject has no 
place to sleep), or administrative admission (e.g., for a yearly examination) should not be 
considered as a SAE.  
A serious undesirable effect/related SAE is defined as any SAE which the Investigator  classifies 
as having a reasonable possibility for a causal relationship with the investigational product and/or 
the clinical trial procedure.  
12.2 Severity Assessment  
For all AEs occurring during the clinical trial, the Investigator  is to classify and report t he intensity 
of AEs using the following definitions as a guideline:  
- Mild: awareness of signs and symptoms, but easily tolerated  
- Moderate: discomfort, enough to cause interference with usual activity  
- Severe: incapacitating, with inability to work or perform usual activity. 
12.3 Causality Assessment  
The Investigator  is to assess the causal relationship (causality) between an adverse event and 
the investigational product and/or the clinical trial procedure according to the following definitions (Decision of 25 November 2013 on Guideline on Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 
(2013/674/EU) - Causality assessment of undesirable effect caused by cosmetic products):  
• Very likely  
• Likely  
• Not clearly attributable  
  Page 21 of 27 
Protocol GLI.04. US.SL .020 CONFIDENTIAL  
Protocol Version : 04 
This document contains confidential, proprietary information.  
• Unlikely  
• Excluded 
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship, considering all relevant factors 
including the pattern of reaction, temporal relationships, positive de -challenge or re -challenge, 
relevant medical history, and confounding factors such as co -medication or concurrent dis eases.  
12.4 Collection, M anagement and Reporting Procedures 
The period of collection of adverse events starts from the time of signature of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) by the subject (and/or, for subjects who are minor, by the parents/legal 
representatives)  until the end of the subject’s participation in the clinical study.  
If a Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is on -going at the final clinical trial visit, it should be followed by 
the Investigator  until it has resolved or has reached a stable condition.  
After the subject completes the clinical study, the Investigator  should also inform the Sponsor 
(see Sponsor’s contact details below) if he/she becomes aware of an SAE involving a subject who has participated in the clinical study.  
At each post -enrollment  visit, the Investigator  will question the subject about AEs using an open 
non-persuasive question to elicit reporting of AEs, for example “ Have you noticed any change in 
your health since the last visit? ” Direct questioning and examination will be performed when 
appropriate.  
The Investigator  will obtain and maintain in the subject’s files all pertinent medical records, and (if 
applicable) information and medical judgment from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow- up of the subject.  If necessary, the Investigator  will contact the subject’s personal physician 
or hospital staff to obtain further details.  
As a minimum, Investigator s are requested to report in the Case Report Form (CRF) and in 
the report all related adverse events (i.e. undesirable effects) and all Serious Adverse 
Events, whether related or not.  
12.4.1.  Management and reporting procedures for undesirable effects (i.e. related adverse events  
Undesirable effects should be recorded in the CRF and summarized in the report in a summary table with at minimum the subject number, AE number, AE diagnosis or signs and symptoms, 
location, date of onset, seriousness, severity, action taken, relationship, date of resolution and 
concomitant treatment associated as well as a detailed narrative of the event.  
In addition, based on his/her medical judgment, the Investigator  will assess whether an 
undesirable effect requires immediate (i.e. within 24 hours) reporting to the Sponsor. In such cases, the summary table will be sent to the Sponsor, along with the AE narrative and any other 
relevant information (concomitant treatments, product weighing, …).  
All undesirable effects should be appropriately documented, i.e. any relevant information such as 
demographics, medical history and concomitant therapies  should be recorded in the CRF.  
The Investigator  is to monitor and record the progress of the adverse effect until the last subject’s 
study visit.  
The Investigator  is to update the AE narrative as appropriate, each time follow -up information is 
collected and when the final outcome of the adverse effect is known.

Protocol Version : 04 
This document contains confidential, proprietary information.  
12.4.2.  Management and reporting procedures for Serious Adverse Event s  
The Investigator  is to take the following steps:  
1. Take prompt and appropriate medical action, if necessary. The safety of clinical trial 
subjects is the first priority  
2. Ensure the AE is classified as an SAE. Immediately inform the Sponsor’s representative 
of the event by email or fax (see  both contact details below) and discuss further actions to 
be taken:  
Global PV email: safety.q -med@galderma.com  
US PV email :  pharmacovigilance.USDFW@galderma.com  
3. Complete the Serious Adverse Event (SAE) form provided by the Sponsor’s 
representative Within 24 hours, fax or send by e- mail to the Sponsor’s representative  
the completed SAE form, accompanied any other relevant information (e.g. test results or medical records).  
4. Monitor, record and send to Sponsor’s representative the progress of the event until it 
resolves or reaches a stable outcome, with or without sequelae (send the updated SAE 
form with follow- up information and any other relevant information to Sponsor’s 
representative).  
5. Obtain and maintain in the subject’s file all pertinent medical records, information, and 
medical judgments from colleagues who assisted in the treatment and follow -up of the 
subject. If necessary, contact the subject’s personal physician or hospital staff to obtain 
further details.  
6. If applicable, comply with the regulatory requirement(s) related to the reporting of SAEs to the Institutional Review Board (IRB) / Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) . 
12.5 Pregnancy 
Pregnancy itself is not to be considered as an adverse event. If a pregnancy occurs during the 
clinical trial, the product application should be stopped immediately, the subject should be withdrawn from the clinical study and Sponsor’s representative (see Sponsor’s contact details 
above) should be informed within 24 hours.  
Pregnancy must be recorded as a reason for discontinuation in the exit form of the CRF.  
No specific follow- up of pregnancy is required, except if it is a regulatory requirement in the 
country(ies) where the clinical trial is conducted.  
13. ETHICAL AND REGULATORY PROCEDURES  
13.1 Research Standards/Good Clinical Practice  
This study will be conducted in accordance with all applicable guidelines for the protection of 
human subjects for research as outlined in 21 CFR 50 the accepted standards for Good Clinical

documents; and the study is conducted in accord ance with the currently approved protocol and 
any other study agreements, GCP, and all applicable regulatory requirements . The Investigator  
will allow the Galderma Laboratories, L.P. representatives to have access to all study records, CRF/ eCRFs, corresponding subject medical records, and any other documents considered 
source documentation. The Investigator  also agrees to assist the representatives, if required , 
which can include AE reporting. All study monitoring details will be detaile d in the Cl inical 
Monitoring Plan.  
14.2 Data Collection  
Investigator s must keep accurate records of all subjects' visits and all procedures done, being 
sure to include all pertinent study related information from which CRF/ eCRF data will be recorded . 
Data for this study m ay be recorded in the subject's chart (e.g. source documents  / electronic 
records ) or if approved by the Galderma Laboratories, L.P. directly into CRF/ eCRFs . If electronic 
records are maintained, the method of verification must be determined in advance of starting the 
study . The process of administering the informed consent must also be documented . Any and all 
side effects and AEs with the concomitant therapies associated must be thoroughly documented . 
Results of any diagnostic tests conducted during the st udy should be included in the source 
documentation. Pertinent telephone conversations with the subjects and/or Galderma 
Laboratories, L.P. concerning the study will be documented and kept on file.  
It is required that the author of an entry in the source documents be identifiable. Direct access to 
all source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of verifying that the 
data recorded in the CRF/ eCRF are consistent with the original source.

Protocol Version : 04 
This document contains confidential, proprietary information.  
Only designated individuals may complete the CRF/ eCRFs . The principal Investigator  will review 
the reported data and certify that the CRF/ eCRFs are accurate and complete.  
After monitoring has occurred at the clinical site(s) and the CRF/ eCRFs have been reviewed, 
additional data clarifications and/or additions may be needed  including AE reporting. Data 
clarifications and/or additions are documented and are part of each subject’s CRF/eCRFs. 
14.3 Record Retention  
The Investigator  is required to maintain up- to-date, complete regulatory documentation as 
indicated by Galderma Laboratories, L.P. and the Investigator ’s files will be reviewed as part of 
the ongoing study monitoring. The records must be easily accessible when needed (e.g ., for a 
Galderma Laboratories L.P.’s audit  or regulatory inspection) and must be available for review in 
conjunction with assessment of the facility, supporting systems, and relevant site personnel. 
Financial information is not subject to regulatory inspection and should be kept separately.  
Galderma Laboratories, L.P. will inform the Investigator  of the time period for retaining the site 
records in order to comply with all applicable regulatory requirements . The minimum retention 
time will meet the strict est standard applicable to a particular site, as dictated by local 
laws/regulations, Galderma Laboratories, L. P. SOPs , and/or institutional requirements.  
The Investigator  should take measures to prevent accidental or premature destruction of these 
document s. If the Investigator  retires, relocates, or for other reasons withdraws from the 
responsibility of keeping the study records, custody must be transferred to a person who will accept the responsibility . Galderma Laboratories, L.P. must be notified in writing of the name and 
address of the new custodian.

APPENDIX I: BIOPSY PROCEDURE AND POST -CARE  
1. Biopsy Visits  
a. Prepare the Area to be Biopsied  
i. After the patient, guardian, and/or power of attorney have been consented, 
initials are completed the area of skin where biopsy will be performed 
needs to be identified and circled with surgical marker. Once area is 
identified – a photo of area being biopsy is mandatory. Next, the area of 
skin where the biopsy is taking place will be prepared with an alcohol swab 
to ensure sterile conditions prior to procedure.  
b. Anesthetize the Skin 
i. Once the skin has been identified, photo is taken, and prepared wi th 
alcohol  swab - the next step is to anesthetize the area to be biopsied by 
injecting a solution of Lidocaine 1% and Epinephrine or Lidocaine 1% with no Epinephrine ( if patient is allergic to Epinephrine or breast feeding) just 
under the epidermis (sub -epidermally) using a Syringe. The slight burning 
will quickly subside and the site will become numb. Once area has been anesthetized, it is critical for area to be tested to make sure the area of skin 
being biopsy is indeed numbed.   
c. Biopsy the Skin  
i. After the  area to be biopsied is anesthetized, the biopsy continues. Using 
a sterile 3 mm skin punch, the study investigator applies pressure and twisting in a “drilling” motion until the blade of the skin punch has pierced 
the epidermis of the skin.  
ii. After the blade has sufficiently “cored” or carved out a 3mm cylinder of skin the punch is removed.  
iii. Nurse assists with hemostasis - gauze, gloves, etc. for bleeding purposes. 
Once specimen is removed by provider, 1 -3 sutures will follow.  
 
2. Post -Biopsy Procedure  
a. Keep the initial dressing/bandage in place and dry for up to 24 hours.  
b. Change the dressings 2 times a day using the following method.  
i. Wash your hands before and after changing the dressings . 
ii. Clean the affected area gently with mild soap. If you have stitches , you may 
use cotton tipped applicators (Q -tips) around the stitches. It is okay if the 
stitches get wet in the shower after the first 24 hours.  
iii. Gently pat dry the area . 
iv. Apply antibiotic ointment (Polysporin, Bactroban, Mupirocin, Gentamicin, Neosporin, Aquaphor, Vaseline) to the affected area.  
v. Cover with Band -Aid or telfa pad (non- stick) dressing and tape.  
c. Repeat this process daily until the wound is healed (usually 5 -7 days) or the 
stitches are removed.  
d. If your wound becomes red, warm, painful, begins to drain or you develop a fever 
of 100 or greater please contact your provider immediately.  
e. Bleeding may occasionally occur as the local anesthetic wears off. Apply firm direct pressure to the bandage continuously for fifteen minutes. If the bleedi ng persists 
after fifteen minutes call your provider.  
f. Return to your provider in 5- 14 days for suture removal (Depending on area being 
biopsied) and/or follow up.

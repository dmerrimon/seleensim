1 3/25/2020  We have made changes to clarify  two points. 
First, we ensured that the compensation 
listed for  all documents is $80. Second, we 
have clarified  how the Physical Activity 
Read iness Questionnaire will be scored  as it 
pertains to inclusion and exclusion  (Sections 
8.1 and 13.1) . Notably, we have also better 
clarified scoring in the phone -based 
screening questionnaire to be used by the 
research team to screen participants for 
inclusion in the trial.  No.

(1) the precautions our research team will be 
taking to reduce the potential for SARS -CoV-2 
transmission; (2) the methodology we will 
use to deliver this trial in a remote manner 
if/when in -person exercise sessions are not 
possible due to the COVID -19 pandemic  
and/or participant preference (Sections 4.1 
and 5.2). Additionally, the protocol was 
edited for clarity and to avoid redundancies.  No. 
3 05/25/2021  We have updated this protocol to reflect:

 Page 8 of 44 Template  Revis ed On: 09/01/2019  1.0 Objectives  
1.1 Purpose:  We propose a 100 -participant randomized controlled 2 -arm 
parallel trial which employs a metagenomic approach to examine how 8 
weeks of supervised moderate -intensity treadmill walking exercise 
(MWE)1,2 for 30 -45 min 3 times/week alters the gut microbiome, serum 
SCFAs, and the cardiometabolic profile, body weight, and body composition 
of individuals 30 -64 years old who are overweight or obese and have PreD.  
Aim 1:  Compare the effect of 8 weeks of MWE vs. control on shifts in the 
gut microbiome of overweight or obese individuals with PreD. H1: Gut 
microbial diversity and functional capacity (specifically, genes relevant to 
SCFA production) will increase improve after 8 weeks in the experimental 
group vs. control.  
Aim 2:  Compare the effect of 8 weeks of MWE vs. control on changes in 
serum SCFAs. H2: Serum Levels of SCFAs butyrate, acetate, and propionate 
will increase after 8 weeks in the experimental group vs. control.  
Aim 3:  Use formal mediation methods to estimate the proportion of 
MWE -induced changes in participants’ cardiometabolic profiles, body 
weight, and body composition that are mediated by changes in the gut 
microbiome and/or serum SCFAs. H3: MWE -induced changes in the gut 
microbiome and serum SCFAs will partly explain changes in participants’ 
cardiometabolic profile (e.g., blood lipids, fasting insulin/glucose, blood 
pressure, waist circumference), body weight, and body composition.  
 
2.0 Background  
2.1 Significance  of Research Question/Purpose:  In the U.S, 91.8 million adults 
have prediabetes (PreD).3 The prediabetic state is a prominent public 
health problem as up to 70% of individuals with PreD convert to type 2 
diabetes (T2D).4 The risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is high among 
those with PreD and T2D, and nearly $330 billion/year is spent treating 
T2D.3,5-7 The American Heart Association (AHA)  and American Diabetes 
Association (ADA)  have thus called for continued investigation into 
mechanisms connecting health behaviors to pre -clinical cardiometabolic 
disease (CMD; e.g., PreD) to reduce future disease risk.8,9 Physical activity 
(PA) is a key modifiable determinant of good health.10 Literature suggests 
PA recommendation10 adherence is related to a 25 -35% dose -dependent 
reduction in all -cause mortality1,11,12, with as little as 75 min/week of 
regular moderate -intensity PA beneficial.1 Data from the Diabetes 
Prevention Program (DPP) suggested that, among those with PreD, a 
behavioral intervention emphasizing PA and diet to be at least as successful 
as metformin in preventing T2D, partially due to weight loss during this

 Page 9 of 44 Template  Revis ed On: 09/01/2019  trial.13 Yet, many individuals do not fully realize the cardiometabolic 
benefits of PA, and mechanistic pathways linking PA and cardiometabolic 
improvements are not fully understood.8,9,14,15 The gut microbiome16 has 
been posited as a mechanistic intermediate linking heath behaviors such as 
PA to CMD development.14,17 -19  
The gut microbiome may be important for immunological,20,21 
metabolic,16,22 inflammatory,18,23,24 and neurobehavioral processes22,24,25, 
some of which might partially explain how health behaviors influence CMD 
risk. Yet, limited evidence exists characterizing the effect of PA on the 
human gut microbiome. To date, most studies of the impact of PA 
interventions on the gut microbiome have used animal models,26-41 with 
these studies supporting regular chronic PA (i.e., exercise) as a modulator 
of the gut microbiota. Animal studies have most often reported exercise -
related changes to the Firmicutes27-31,38 or Bacteroidetes26,34,35,40 phyla 
while also noting beneficial alterations to microbial community 
diversity26,29,30,32 -35,38 -40 and short chain fatty acid (SCFA) -producing taxa33-
36,38,41. SCFAs are reported to promote gastrointestinal health, increase 
energy expenditure42, and to be related to a lean phenotype.14,27,41 The five 
existing human gut microbiome trials43-47 most often implemented non -
controlled studies of 5 - to 8-weeks of moderate -intensity exercise on 3 
days/week for 30 -60 min/session. Among overweight or obese adults, prior 
studies43-45 note increased 
 -diversity and altered ꞵ-diversity as a result of 
exercise; similar findings emerged in another study of healthy older 
adults.46 Additionally, one study noted exercise to result in increases in 
SCFAs (in stool), and corresponding changes to SCFA -related bacterial 
genes and taxa,45 while two other studies observed improvements in the 
metabolic potential of the gut microbiome43,44. These findings corroborate 
observational studies in humans wherein more physically active individuals 
have greater microbiota diversity and/or improved capacity to produce 
SCFAs than less active individuals.48-53 To our knowledge, no randomized 
controlled parallel design study has been conducted using metagenomic 
profiling (i.e., assessments of microbial functional capacity) to examine 
the influence of exercise on the human gut microbiome and serum SCFA 
levels in a  population with a pre -clinical CMD. Moreover, no study has 
tested if changes in these outcomes mediate changes in cardiometabolic 
profiles or body weight and composition .  
The proposed study is innovative for the following reasons. First, we know 
of no other study in individuals who are overweight or obese with PreD 
that has examined how an exercise program may modify the gut 
microbiome and serum SCFAs. Second, we will study , for the first time, the 
interrelationship between exercise and the gut metagenome using a 
recently validated method for ‘shallow shotgun’ sequencing.54 The shallow 
shotgun approach enables interrogation of the gut metagenome at a cost

PROTOCOL TITLE: Exercise and the Gut Microbiome R21  
VERSION DATE: 05/11/2022 
 Page 10 of 44 Template  Revis ed On: 09/01/2019  that scales to longitudinal repeated measures study designs. As such, we 
will generate novel data on longitudinal changes in the gut metagenome 
resulting from MWE in individuals with PreD via thorough examination of 
the function of various microbial taxa a nd their effect on health over 
time.55 Finally, the use of formal mediation analyses to examine the degree 
to which MWE -related changes in the preceding outcomes mediate 
changes in cardiometabolic risk profiles is novel and will inform the relative 
importance of the gut microbiome in exercise -related cardiometabolic 
improvements. These mediation analyses will also allow for a deeper 
interpretation of the physiological mechanisms by which exercise promotes 
improved health —addressing calls by the AHA  and ADA .8,9. 
2.2 Preliminary Data:  To date, only five human trials have investigated the 
effect of exercise on the gut microbiome.43-47, with  none of these studies 
having been conducted in a population with a subclinical CMD (e.g., PreD). 
Further, there are notable limitations to these human studies. First, aside 
from Kern et al.43, no study employed a true control group. Second, most 
studies were conducted in small samples of apparently healthy adults, with 
only two studies44,47 incorporating a true metagenomic sequencing 
approach. Incorporating a metagenomic approach (i.e., assessing microbial 
genes and functional capacity ) allows for a deeper understanding of 
microbial diversity and ecology as well as better elucidation of the function 
of various microbial taxa and their effect(s) on health.55 Finally, Allen et 
al.45 only assessed SCFAs changes in stool and not in serum . 
2.3 Existing Literature:  The gut microbiome16 has been posited as a 
mechanistic intermediate linking heath behaviors such as PA to CMD 
development.14,17 -19 The gut microbiome may be important for 
immunological,20,21 metabolic,16,22 inflammatory,18,23,24 and 
neurobehavioral processes22,24,25, some of which might partially explain 
how health behaviors influence CMD risk. Yet, limited evidence exists 
characterizing the effect of PA on the human gut microbiome. To date, 
most studies of the impact of PA interventions on the gut microbiome have 
used animal models,26-41 with these studies supporting regular chronic PA 
(i.e., exercise) as a modulator of the gut microbiota. Animal studies have 
most often reported exercise -related changes to the Firmicutes27-31,38 or

gastrointestinal health, increase energy expenditure42, and to be related to 
a lean phenotype.14,27,41 The five existing human gut microbiome trials43-47 
most often implemented non -controlled studies of 5 - to 8-weeks of 
moderate -intensity exercise on 3 days/week for 30 -60 min/session. Among

exercise to result in increases in SCFAs (in stool), and corresponding 
changes to SCFA -related bacterial genes and taxa,45 while two other studies 
observed improvements in the metabolic potential of the gut

3.0 Study Endpoints/Events/Outcomes  
3.1 Primary Endpoint/Event/Outcome:  Expanded data collection procedures 
for our primary and secondary outcomes are available in Section 5.2 . We 
have two Primary Outcomes . The first primary outcome is changes to the 
gut microbiome , assessed via metagenomic sequencing, from pre - to post -
intervention ( Specific Aim 1 ). The Shannon Index —a measure of microbial 
community diversity with good reproducibility (ICCs>0.50)56—will be our 
primary indicator for changes in gut microbiota composition , and will be 
assessed at baseline, and following the 4th and 8th weeks . The second 
primary outcome is serum SCFA levels . Participants will undergo fasted 
blood draws to assess serum SCFA levels  (Specific Aim 2 ). This work will be 
performed using the Metabolon pipeline.57  
3.2 Secondary Endpoint(s)/Event(s)/Outcome(s):  We have several Secondary 
Outcomes . For Specific Aim 3  cardiometabolic profiles will be assessed via 
assays for high -density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL -C), triglycerides , fasting 
insulin/glucose , and c-reactive protein (CRP) . All blood assays will be 
conducted by the UMN Advanced Research and Diagnostic Laboratory  (see 
‘Facilities’ document ). Blood samples collected will be stored at -80C prior 
to batch -processing. Resting blood pressure (BP)  will be taken using an 
Omron Automatic BP Cuff (Omron; Lake Forest, IL), with the average of the 
last two BP measurements reported. These cardiometabolic indices form 
the foundation of the ‘metabolic syndrome’,59-63 and we will form a 
composite continuous score for cardiometabolic disease risk from HDL -C, 
fasting glucose, triglycerides, the average of systolic and diastolic BP, and 
waist circumference. Specifically, z -scores for each biomarker will be 
calculated and the within -participant average across z -scores computed 
and referred to  as cardiometabolic disease risk (CMDrisk ; the primary 
dependent variable for Specific Aim 3) . This score has been used in 
epidemiologic, experimental, and clinical studies.62,64 -67 Individual 
components will be described in secondary analyses as needed. We will 
also measure HbA1c  using whole blood analyzed  at the UMN Advanced 
Research Diagnostic Laboratory;  the A1cNOW+® device  may also be used 
in a limited capacity to assess validity .68 The oral microbiome  will be

will ask that participants chew a paraffin tablet (Orion Diagnostica) for 5 
minutes after which the participant will be asked to spit into a 50mL tube 
until 5mL of saliva is collected . We have experience with this non -invasive 
assessment69, with the assessment taking no longer than 5 -10 minutes 
overall and presenting no greater than minimal risk. Other secondary 
outcomes are necessary to measure to ensure we can properly control for 
confounding. Dietary composition  will be assessed via 3 phone -based 
dietary recalls  during the run -in phase, and again during the final two 
weeks of the study . We will use these dietary recalls collected during the 
run-in period to develop personalized 3 -day meal plan to standardize 
individual dietary behavior pr ior to stool sample collection. Employing 
dietary recalls at these time points will also allow us to adequately 
statistically control for participants’ dietary changes —changes which, if not 
controlled, might confound study results.70,71 Physical activity  will be 
measured for the duration of the study using the Fitbit Inspire 2  
smartwatch that uses accelerometry  to measure physical activity metrics 
such intensity, steps,  etc. Finally, anthropometric outcomes will include 
height , weight , and body composition . These measures, along with the 
other secondary outcomes aside from PA and Dietary composition, will be 
measured at the end of the 3 -week  run-in phase, and at the end of  the 4th 
and 8th study weeks .  
4.0 Study Intervention (s)/Investigational Agent(s)  
4.1 Description:  Following baseline data collection, participants will be 
randomized into  one of  two study groups using PROC PLAN (SAS 9.4) and a 
1:1 allocation ratio.  
GROUP 1 (aka , Experimental group ): participants will complete  3 walking 
sessions/week  for a total of 8 weeks  (24 total sessions ). Walking sessions 
will either take place on new commercial treadmills in the Epidemiology 
Clinical Research Center  or remotely at or around  a participant’s home (see 
below). Regardless of the walking location , walking sessions will be  30 min 
in duration during intervention weeks 1 through 4 and  a minimum of  45 
min each during intervention weeks 5 through 8.   
GROUP 2  (aka , Control group ): participants will be asked to maintain their 
usual PA during the initial 8 -week intervention period but will undergo all 
data collection procedures as outlined for the experimental group  (See 
Section 5.2) .  
 
Experimental group participants who want to forego  in-person exercise 
sessions on the University of Minnesota campus due to logistical 
constraints or the COVID -19 pandemic will modify the exercise 
intervention  in the following manner :

 Page 13 of 44 Template  Revis ed On: 09/01/2019  Experimental group participants will engage in  the same frequency and 
duration of walks as described above, but with a change in location to 
either: (a) in neighborhood or backyard walk (weather permit ting, 
maintaining physical distancing ); (b) on a treadmill within their home; and 
(c) in the hallway of their home if options a. and b. are not possible . 
 
To monitor physical activity levels and ensure remote compliance:  we will 
monitor to ensure that participants are completing their home -based walks 
at the p roper duration and intensity using the Fitabase® platform.  (See 
more information on the data security of Fitabase® in Section 16.7)

5.0 Procedures Involved  
5.1 Study Design:  We will employ a 100 -participant, 8 -wk, randomized 2 -arm 
parallel trial design with a 1:1 allocation ratio.  
5.2 Study Procedures:  All eligible and consented participants will complete a 3-
week run -in phase during which baseline outcome assessments will be 
performed. During run -in weeks 1 and 2, participants will wear a Fitbit 
Inspire 2 smart watch  and complete three unannounced dietary recalls. 
During the run -in week 3  (see table below) , participants will consume their 
3-day standardized meal plan  on days three through five , obtain a fecal 
sample, and complete a study assessment visit. To quantify compliance 
with the 3 -day meal plan, participants will be provided with a paper 
checklist of all  foods to be consumed, and will be asked to indic ate which 
foods were consumed and to document any deviation. The study 
assessment visit will include a fasting blood draw, blood pressure in 
triplicate, weight measure and body fat assessment in duplicate, and a 
saliva sample. Following successful completion of all measures, p articipants 
will then be randomized into one of the two study  groups using PROC PLAN 
(SAS 9.4) and a 1:1 allocation ratio.  
 
Group 1 ( Experimental group ): Participants will complete  3 treadmill 
walking sessions/week (24 total sessions)  over 8 weeks at or around their 
home or in -person within the Epidemiology Clinical Research Center.  Each 
walking sessions will be 30 min in duration during intervention weeks 1

exercise dose (i.e., intensity x session duration x weekly frequency x 
intervention length) is equivalent to, or greater than, that employed in 
most existing human studies of exercis e and the gut microbiome in 
addition to the exercise dosage observed necessary to yield meaningful 
cardiometabolic changes.72 Therefore, while the dose is ‘modest’, it reflects 
what is relevant in real -world interventions and appropriate for overweight 
or obese sedentary individuals.  
 
During week 4,  participants will again consume their 3 -day standardized 
meal plan, obtain a fecal sample, and complete a study assessment visit 
(same measures as described above for the 3 -week run-in, except no 
fasting blood draw will be taken ).  
 
During weeks 7 and 8 , participants will complete 3 unannounced phone -
based dietary recalls . During week 8, participants will again consume their 
3-day standardized meal plan, obtain a fecal sample, and complete a study 
assessment visit (same measures as described above in run -in week 3).

Group 2 ( Control group ): Participants will be asked to maintain their usual 
PA during the initial 8 -week intervention period but will undergo all data 
collection procedures as outlined above for the experimental group.  
 
Expanded Data Collection Procedures:  We have two Primary Outcomes . 
The first primary outcome is changes to the gut microbiome , assessed via 
metagenomic sequencing, from pre - to post -intervention ( Specific Aim 1 ). 
The Shannon Index  will be our primary indicator for changes in gut 
microbiota composition. Participants will use the OMNIgene -Gut stool 
collection kit  to obtain their fecal samples collected at baseline, week 4 and

 Page 15 of 44 Template  Revis ed On: 09/01/2019  week 8. The home -collected samples will be returned to our lab within 30 
days. DNA will be extracted  from  the stool samples using the 96 well plate 
Mo Bio Power soil kit on an Epmotion robot and eluted into 50ul aliquots. 
Each extraction will contain negative and positive controls representing 
defined bacterial communities (Zymo; Irvine, CA). DNA will be quantifi ed 
using Quant -it and stored at -80°C. Metagenomic libraries will be prepared  
at the UMN Genome Center  (see ‘Facilities’ document) using the Nexter a 
XT kit (Illumina; San Diego, CA) and barcoded. DNA libraries will be 
denatured with NaOH and diluted to 8 -12 pM in Illumina’s HT1 buffer, 
spiked with 1% PhiX and a HiSeq 1x100 cycle v3 ki Illumina HiSeq, with an 
expected output of at least 0.5 million to tal sequences per sample. This 
approach has been shown to be valid54 and represents an approach that 
can address both gut microbial taxonomy and community functional 
content at a cost similar to 16S studies.   
The second primary outcome is serum SCFA levels . Participants will 
undergo fasted blood draws to assess serum SCFA levels ( Specific Aim 2 ). 
This work will be performed using the Metabolon pipeline.57 Briefly, serum 
samples are spiked with a solution of eight stable labelled internal 
standards  and subjected to protein precipitation. After centrifugation, an 
aliquot of the supernatant is derivatized. The reaction mixture is analyzed 
by LC MS/MS on an Agilent 1290/ AB Sciex 5500 system. Peak areas of the 
respective analyte product ions are measure d against the peak area of the 
corresponding internal standard product ions. Quantitation is performed 
using a weighted least squares regression analysis generat ed from fortified 
calibration standards prepared immediately prior to each run.   
We have several Secondary Outcomes . For Specific Aim 3  cardiometabolic 
profiles will be assessed via assays for high -density lipoprotein cholesterol 
(HDL -C), triglycerides , fasting insulin/glucose , and c-reactive protein (CRP) . 
All blood assays will be conducted by the UMN Advanced Research and 
Diagnostic Laboratory  (see ‘Facilities’ document ). Blood samples collected 
will be stored at -80C prior to batch -processing. Resting blood pressure 
(BP) will be taken using an Omron Automatic BP Cuff (Omron; Lake Forest, 
IL), with the average of the last two BP measurements reported. These 
cardiometabolic indices form the foundation of the ‘metabolic 
syndrome’,59-63 and we will form a composite continuous score for 
cardiometabolic disease risk from HDL -C, fasting glucose, triglycerides, the 
average of systolic and diastolic BP. Specifically, z -scores for each 
biomarker will be calculated and the within -participant av erage across z -
scores computed and referred to  as cardiometabolic disease risk (CMDrisk ; 
the primary dependent variable for Specific Aim 3) . This score has been 
used in epidemiologic, experimental, and clinical studies.62,64 -67 Individual 
components will be described in secondary analyses as needed. We will 
also measure HbA1c  using standardized procedures and the blood

salivary testing technique.  Participant s will be asked to drool  into a 50mL 
tube until 5mL of saliva is collected.  For participants that are having 
difficulty generating saliva, we will ask th ose participants chew a small 
piece of orthodontic wax for 5 minutes and then drool into the 50mL tube.  
We have experience with this non -invasive assessment69, with the 
assessment taking no longer than 5 -10 minutes overall and presenting no 
greater than minimal risk. Other secondary outcomes are necessary to 
measure to ensure we can properly control for confounding. Dietary 
composition  will be assessed via 3 phone -based dietary recalls. These 
recalls will be performed on 2 weekdays and 1 weekend day by trained 
interviewers. Assessment of diet on multiple days allows us to capture the 
individual variation in participants’ diets.71 We will use these dietary recalls 
to develop personalized 3 -day meal plan to standardize individual dietary 
behavior prior to stool sample collection. Although randomization should 
lead to approximately balanced groups with respect to diet, employing 
dietary recalls at these time points will allow us to adequately statistically 
control for participants’ dietary changes —changes which, if not controlled, 
might confound study results.70,71 Physical activity  will be measured during 
the duration of the study  using the Fitbit Inspire 2  smartwatch . Finally, 
anthropometric outcomes will include height  measured using a Seca 
stadiometer (Seca; Hamburg, Germany), with weight  and body composition  
measured using the Tanita TBF -300a Body Composition Analyzer (Tokyo, 
Japan).  
To collect blood samples  and saliva samples  as well as body weight, body 
fat percentage, and blood pressure, we are proposing to employ the 
following procedures in the designated settings  while following all 
necessary COVID -19 precautions : 
Setting:  Baseline , week 4 , and week 8 visits will occur in the Epidemiology 
Clinical Research Center (ECRC). We will follow all UMN, OVPR and ECRC 
approved guidelines for conducting research during the COVID -19 
pandemic .  
COVID -19 Screening:  Participants will complete the OVPR -approved ECRC 
COVID -19 phone screene r the day prior to their visit . Prior to entering the 
ECRC, participants will call the study coordinator and complete the 
screening questionnaire again. Upon entry into the building, study staff will 
assess the participant’s temperature.   
• Personal Protective Equipment (PPE):  Participants will be asked to 
wear a mask. All ECRC staff coming within 6 feet of study 
participants (e.g. for blood or blood pressure collection) will be 
adhering to UMN guidelines for PPE (e.g. masks, gloves).

VERSION DATE: 05/11/2022 
 Page 17 of 44 Template  Revis ed On: 09/01/2019  ECRC Data Collection:  
• Each p articipant will be directed to a well -ventilated exam room, 
outfitted with a HEPA air purifier  for additional protection where all 
non-lab measurements will take place.  
• Participant will step upon the study scale and state to us their 
weight and body fat percentage while we stand at least 6 feet away. 
No other participants will be in the exam room, so confidentiality 
will be assured.  
• Study staff  will obtain blood pressure and a trained phlebotomist 
will collect the blood samples. As always, juice and snacks will be on 
hand in case needed after the blood draws. We will then have 
participants collect their saliva samples.  
• Participant will be directed out of the building. Blood samples will 
be processed immediately and placed into a -80 freezer.  
• We will thoroughly disinfect all touchpoints and research materials 
while properly disposing of biohazards.  
If ECRC visits cannot occur due to continued COVID -19 outbreaks, we will 
conduct Home -Based Visits in the following manner:  
• Participants will complete the OVPR -approved ECRC COVID -19 
phone screener the day prior to their visit.  
• Upon staff arrival, study staff will call the participant to again 
complete the OVPR -approved ECRC COVID -19 phone screener, and 
a temperature reading of the participant will be taken when they 
come outside . 
• The scale platform will be placed  outside the participant’s home on 
a flat surface.  The scale reader is connected to the platform by a 6 
foot cord, enabling the staff to read the output while maintaining 
physical distance.   
• Blood pressure will be obtained by the study staff member 
completing the research session.  
• The study phlebotomist will collect the blood samples with 
participant seated in the chair. Juice and snacks will be made 
available in case the need arises. Blood will be placed in a cooler 
with dry ice for transport back to the ECRC for processing and 
placement into a -80 freezer.  
o We will also thoroughly disinfect all touchpoints and 
research materials while properly disposing of biohazards.  
 
We have outlined the procedures we will take to ensure participant safety 
during the intervention within section 13.1. This study presents no greater 
than minimal risk to participants. All data collection forms are available on 
ETHOS.

5.3 Study Duration:  The total duration of  study participation will be 
approximately 11 weeks from initial contact with the researchers to the 
conclusion of all study procedures.  
 
As for the data analyses associated with this study, we anticipate these 
data analyses to take approximately 4 months —allowing time for the UMN 
Genomics Center  and the UMN Advanced Research and Diagnostic 
Laboratory  to batch process participants’ stool samples and blood work, 
respectively.  
 
5.4 Individually Identifiable Health Information:  Each participant will be 
assigned a unique study ID that will consist of a series of numbers and 
letters that will have no meaning to any of the individual's personal 
identifying characteristics. The investigators will use this ID to track each 
individual participant in the research database. There will be not identifiers 
in this database. The identifiers will be maintained in separate, secure, 
encrypted, password -protected database in a different physical locat ion. 
This separate database for the identifying information will also include the 
study ID so that the investigators can link research data to individuals when 
necessary.

6.0 Data and Specimen Banking  
6.1 Storage and Access:  We will initially collect d ata on paper after which we 
will transfer these data to computer spreadsheets for export to statistical 
packages, with this data entry conducted separately by two individuals to 
ensure data integrity. All PHI will be stored in a folder on the University of 
Minnesota’s Box drive which is HIPAA compliant. All paper -based data  will 
be stored  in a locked file cabinet within the West Bank Office Building near 
the PI’s office for a minimum of three years after the last participant has 
completed data collection. W e will also store the de-identified electronic 
data for a minimum of three years on a server within the Division of 
Epidemiology and Community Health.   
Buffy coat and serum from blood draws and saliva from salivary collection 
will be stored for up to 20 years in the PI’s freezer s located at the

the project, if appropriate, or at the end of the project, consistent with 
normal scientific practices. Research data which documents, supports and 
validates research findings will be made available after the main findings 
from the final research data set have been accepted for publication. Such 
research data will be redacted to prevent the disclosure of personal 
identifiers.  
 
7.0 Sharing of Results with Participants  
7.1 Sharing Results:  Following the conclusion of the study, we will share with 
each participant their anthropometric (weight, waist circumference) and 
cardiometabolic data (fasting insulin/glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol 
levels, and blood pressure) collected during the 2 -week run -in 
visit/baseline fasting visit and following the 4th and 8th weeks. We will share 
these data in a personalized letter to each participant. Further, we will 
provide participants with an overall aggregated summary of the study’s 
observations and/or any published manuscripts.

10.0 Local Number of Participants  
10.1 Local Number of Participants to be Consented:  We will recruit participants 
on a rolling basis with the help of our clinical partners within community -
based health clinics and community outreach around Minneapolis -St. Paul. 
We will assume a 20% attrition rate based on documented attrition rates of 
PA interventions ,82-84 along with a 30% rate of individuals who fail to fall 
within the HbA1c eligibility range during screening.  With these  rates in 
mind, we will recruit 150 individuals total to meet our desired overall N of 
100 participants ( n = 50 per group) . Given the need for participants to be

VERSION DATE: 05/11/2022 
 Page 24 of 44 Template  Revis ed On: 09/01/2019  able to participant in the exercise intervention at the  Epidemiology Clinical 
Research Center, all participants will be recruited locally.  
 
11.0 Local Recruitment Methods  
11.1 Recruitment Process:  Participants will be recruited on a rolling basis 
through  a combination of the following methods: clinical  referrals via  
partners within community -based health clinics , mass emails via University 
of Minnesota -Twin Cities campus  listservs (all permissions will be obtained 
prior to this method),  emails to past study participants who gave 
permission for future contact,  and fliers posted on physical (e.g. campus 
buildings, community billboards) and virtual (e.g. Facebook, NextDoor) 
walls. Our study will also be searchable through c linicaltrials.gov and 
studyfinder.umn.edu.  
 
Should additional recruitment methods be needed, we may also use 
established recruitment databases and EMR obtained through partial 
HIPAA waiver (which we have had approved). For instance, we may use the 
patient access database overseen by the Clinical and  Translational Science 
Institute.  
This study will  also be listed at ResearchMatch.org. ResearchMatch is an 
electronic volunteer  recruitment registry that allows people from 
anywhere in the country to self -register and express  an interest in being 
prospectively considered for participation in research studies. This registry  
provides information about those volunteers to researchers who are 
looking for people to  participate in studies, while protecting the privacy of 
the volunteers.  
 
We intend to begin this recruitment process in early 2021, and we believe 
we can recruit the requisite number of participants over one year.  
11.2 Identification of Potential Participants:  Participants will be referred by one 
of our partnering care providers or will self -identify in response to fliers, 
emails, or internet postings.  
• Potential participants will make the initial contact with study staff  by 
telephone, mail, text, or via completion of our online screening 
survey . Only after this initial contact will study staff reach back out to 
potential participants.  
 
11.3 Recruitment Materials:  All study materials (fliers, postcards, emails) will 
contain a brief description of the study, primary inclusion criteria, a link to 
our study screening survey, and our contact information. Clinical

that we intend to post within community -based spaces such as local 
community centers. Emails sent will include the community flier as an 
attachment , while also containing similar text within the body of the email , 
along with a direct link to our study screening survey .  
 
11.4 Payment:  Participants will have the choice of one of two incentives for 
study completion with greater than 80% adherence: (1) they may request  
$100 following their completion of the entire study, with this payment 
provided using the Greenphire ClinCard ; OR (2) they may request to keep 
the Fitbit Inspire 2  along with a $25 ClinCard . This amount is reasonable 
given the study’s protocol and procedures.  
 
12.0 Withdrawal of Participants  
12.1 Withdrawal Circumstances:  We do not foresee any circumstances under 
which participants will be withdrawn from the research without their 
consent. Participants who discontinue from the active intervention due to 
illness or injury will still be invited to complete all study measures at all 
data collection time points.   
12.2 Withdrawal Procedures:  For participants who ask to withdraw from the 
study voluntarily, no additional data will be collected and participants 
would be compensated at the prorated rate as described in Section 11.4. 
would still be compensated according to the table above. However, data 
from the participant’s time in the study will still be used in data analysis 
when employing an intent -to-treat analysis approach.  
12.3 Termination Procedures:  We do not foresee any circumstances that would 
result in the termination of the study for any individual.  
 
 
13.0 Risks to Participants  
13.1 Foreseeable Risks:  The current study present no greater than minimal risk 
to participants. However, we will be taking precautions to ensure any 
potential risk from study participation is minimized. Per standard 
procedures during exercise in tervention studies, we will ensure 
participants have no contraindications to exercise participation . However, 
we must note that any type of physical activity participation, even a 
walking exercise intervention like that of the cur rent study, does carry risk  
in any population . Risks associated with exercise participation include

 Page 26 of 44 Template  Revis ed On: 09/01/2019  dizziness, nausea, muscle soreness, fatigue, fainting, joint pain, shortness 
of breath, muscular strains/sprains, and cramping. We will minimize these 
risks by allowing participants to complete a 5-10-minute  warm -up of slow 
walking prior to each exercise session.  
 
Some potential psychological stress or embarrassment may also be 
associated with filling out the study questionnaire  and/or undergoing 
measurements of weight, waist circumference, and blood pressure in 
addition to the collection of stool samples and saliva. Risks will be 
minimized by collecting this data in a private setting, either at their home 
or at the ECRC, depending upon the measure in question.   
 
As with all blood draws , there may be a modest amount of pain (equivalent 
to that of a pin prick) and lightheadedness associated with the collection of 
approximately 3 tablespoons of blood for each of three blood draws. We 
will minimize this risk by employing an experienced and trained 
phlebotomist for blood draws.  Overall, the anticipated benefits to science 
outweigh the risks.  
 
Finally, to prevent any threat of a COVID -19 infection, we will follow all 
UMN/OVPR/ECRC protocols while the participant is at the ECRC and 
encourage masking and physical distancing if any walks are done outside 
of the ECRC environment.

13.3 Risks to Others:  N/A 
 
14.0 Potential Benefits to Participants  
14.1 Potential Benefits:  Throughout the course of the 8 -week intervention, 
participants may improve cardiometabolic indices (e.g., blood lipids, fasting 
insulin/glucose, blood pressure, c -reactive protein) while possibly 
experiencing weight loss too.  
 
15.0 Statistical Considerations  
15.1 Data Analysis Plan:  Chi-square and independent t-tests will evaluate 
baseline group differences as appropriate . Mediation analyses will also be 
conducted. We outline our analysis plans in Section 15.3. 86-92

VERSION DATE: 05/11/2022 
 Page 27 of 44 Template  Revis ed On: 09/01/2019  15.2 Power Analysis:  Power for Aim 1  is based on analyses using alpha -diversity 
(Shannon Index) as the primary outcome. Taniguchi et al.46, reported a 
meanSD baseline Shannon Index of 5.7 0.6 which is consistent with 
preliminary data from gut samples collected by Dr. Demmer in other recent 
projects. Given this variance, and with a balanced design of n=50 in the 
experimental and control arms ( N=100 total), we will have >99% power to 
detect a 1 unit increase in Shannon Index. Power for Aim 2  is based on 
changes in serum SCFAs. Our SCFA assays will be performed at Metabolon 
and our colleagues at Metabolon provided information on mean SD for 
these outcomes in their lab. They are as follows: acetate=1806 2500 
ng/mL, butyrate=35 43 ng/mL, and propionate=50 52 ng/mL. With these 
distributions, we will have >80% power to detect a difference in SCFA levels 
between treatment and control groups with a magnitude of at least 50% of 
1 SD.   
The primary outcome for Aim 3  will be a composite score based on the 
average of the z -scores for the following 5 biomarkers: HDL -C, fasting 
glucose, triglycerides, average of systolic and diastolic BP, and waist 
circumference. The standardized mean SD of this CMDrisk  z-score in Dr. 
Pereira’s sedentary behavior intervention among 575 participants (Grant #: 
R01CA198971) is 0 0.7. This provides 80% power to detect a difference in 
the CMDrisk  z-score of 0.4, between intervention and control at the 
conclusion of the study.  
 
15.3 Statistical Analysis:  Aim 1 analysis : Gut microbiome data, derived via 
metagenomic sequencing, will be operationalized as described above. In a 
primary analysis, generalized linear regression models will regress Shannon 
Index on intervention assignment. The model is formalized as: E[Y]= 
inter cept + β1*A + β2*C. E[Y]=expected Shannon value; β1=coefficient for 
intervention arm; β2=coefficient for a vector of confounders should this be 
necessary in our randomized design. Secondary analyses  will consider 
metage nomic features (genes and functional profiles). Any metagenomic 
features not present at >0.1% relative abundance in at least 10% of 
samples will be removed. Zero -inflated log -linear generalized linear models 
with a Gaussian error term will be fitted, with treatment status as 
predictor, as implemented by the metagenomeSeq Bioconductor package 
for shotgun metagenomic data analyses.93  The generalized model, per 
metagenomic outcome, is formalized as: log E[Y]= intercept + β1*A + β2*C. 
E[Y]=expected normalized sequence count value; β1=coefficient for 
intervention arm; β2=coefficient corresponding to the vector of baseline 
confounders. T otal read count is incorporated as an offset term. This 
analysis will generate a “top list” of genes, gene families, and pathways 
with altered abundance by intervention assignment. Separate models will

PROTOCOL TITLE: Exercise and the Gut Microbiome R21  
VERSION DATE: 05/11/2022 
 Page 28 of 44 Template  Revis ed On: 09/01/2019  be developed for intervention status predicting week 4 and week 8 
outcomes. We will also consider time*treatment status models to 
incorporate stool sampling at all three timepoints. P -values will be 
corrected for multiple hypothesis testing using the false -discovery rate as 
we have done previously with high dimensional data.86-92,94 -98  
Aim 2 analysis : As with Aim 1, generalized linear regression models will be 
used. Each of three SCFAs (acetate, butyrate and propionate) will be 
regressed on intervention assignment. The model is formalized as: E[Y]= 
intercept + β1*A + β2*C. E[Y]=expected SCFA value; β1= coefficient for 
intervention arm; β2=coefficient for a vector of confounders.   
Aim 3 analysis : We will use PROC CAUSALMED (SAS 9.4) to explore 
mediation  effects on CMDrisk . This regression -based model was developed 
by Valeri and VanderWeele99 and VanderWeele.100 The predictor variable 
will be treatment (experimental vs. control) and the outcome will be 
CMDrisk . We will include age, sex as a biological variable , race/ethnicity, 
and PA duration as covariates. Mediation  will be tested by adding 
parameters, in separate models , for gut microbiota diversity  (8-week 
change in 
 -diversity) and serum SCFAs  (8-week change in levels of serum 
SCFAs) . 
  
15.4 Data Integrity:  All data will be double entered separately by two 
individuals. Blood and stool sample data will be examined for 
computational value errors associated with out -of-range variables. All data 
will be examined for outliers and improbable values. More details pr ovided

17.1 Data Security:  As reviewed previously, we have numerous safeguards in 
place to protect data integrity —all of which will be under the oversight of 
the PI. Our research team is qualified to conduct this oversight given past 
experience conducting randomized trials. First, all data will be double 
entered separately by two individuals which will allow us to check for data 
entry errors. Blood, stool, and salivary sample data will be examined for 
computational value errors associated with out -of-range variables. All data 
will be examined for outliers and improbable values. These procedures will 
ensure protection of the study’s  internal validity. Second, to protect the 
participants’ health -related information, we will deidentify each 
participant’s data. In detail, and as discussed in section 16.1, each 
participant will be assigned a unique study ID that will consist of a series of 
numbers and letters that will have no meaning to any of the individual's 
personal identifying characteristics. The investigators will use this ID to 
track each individual participant in the research database. There will be not 
identifiers in this databa se. The identifiers will be maintained in separate,

21.0 Consent Process  
21.1 Consent Process (when consent will be obtained):  During the recruitment 
process, potential participants will be provided with a copy of the study 
consent form to review. An additional copy will also be attached to their 
consent visit confirmation email/letter for their records. The day prior to 
the first  study visit, the study coordinator will call to confirm the visit and 
complete the COVID -19 screening  questionnaire. The study coordinator will 
confirm that the participant understands the study goals, design, purpose, 
and risks/benefits and is sure they would like to participate in the study , 
and answer any study questions at that time (to minimize in -person time at 
the ECRC). At the consent visit, the study coordinator will answer any 
additional questions and have the participant sign the official consent form. 
A signed copy of the consent f orm will be offered to the participant.  The 
consent process will  take place within a conference room within the 
Epidemiology Clinical Research Center immediately prior to baseline 
testing. We will employ no formal process to ensure ongoing consent, but 
we will continually ensure that the participant is aware of the vol untary 
nature of the study  by ensuring the OVPR Participant Information sheet is 
sent 24 -hours prior to any in -person visit  and knows that they may 
withdraw from study participation at any time for any reason.

25.1 Resources Available:  
• We have clinical partners in Minneapolis -St. Paul health clinics 
which should allow us to complete the recruitment of 100 
participants within two years in addition to our ability to leverage 
University listservs for flier distribution and the posting of fliers 
within local community c enters and on social media. We will 
devote 2 years to conducting this research . 
• The West Bank Office Building has ample room for the current 
study. The Division of Epidemiology and Community Health has 48 
faculty, 350 staff, and a combined office space totaling more than 
75,000 square feet. Meeting rooms are equipped with state -of-
the-art video communication technology for communication with 
external consultants and staff working off -site. It is anticipated 
that the current space will be adequate to accommodate the 
needs of this proposal. Office equipment, such as conference 
telephones , printers, photocopiers, and postage services are 
available to the proposed study. Additionally, we already possess 
the two treadmills that will be used to implement the current 
study, with more to be purchased. The Epidemiology Clinical 
Research Center ( ECRC) is located one block away from the offices 
of the Division of Epidemiology and Community Health, about 0.5 
miles from the University of Minnesota Hospital on the 
Minneapolis campus, and is readily accessible from all parts of the 
Twin Cities metropol itan area (within three blocks from two major 
interstate highways). Participants in this trial will visit the ECRC 
for the blood draws, saliva sample collection, and other clinic 
measures during the baseline fasting visit and during the 4th and 
8th week time points. Assays from blood draws will be analyzed 
at the University of Minnesota’s Advanced Research and 
Diagnostic Laboratory , with all necessary precautions taken to 
limit any chance of COVID -19 infections (as outlined earlier in 
the protocol) . Parking is free. The ECRC occupies one floor 
(17,758 square feet) of a two -story building and includes 
reception area, offices for staff, examination rooms, interview 
rooms, ultrasound, phlebotomy and blood processing rooms, 
freezer room, lounge, conferenc e rooms, and storage space. The 
building meets current regulations for handicapped accessibility

established in February 2000 and is currently providing space and 
infrastructure for 20+ research projects including multicenter 
epidemiologic studies and clinical trials  
• We do not anticipate any medical or psychological risk associated 
with participation, but the West Bank Office Building and 
Epidemiology Clinical Research Center has general first aid 
equipment and a defibrillator onsite if any medical needs arise. 
Further , we will ensure that individuals involved in the monitoring 
of study participation are CPR certified.  
• The PI and Co -Is will train any individual assisting with data 
collection procedures/measurements and will supervise these 
individuals performing these procedures/measurements for 1 
week following training.

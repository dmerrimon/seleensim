NAME OF TRIAL  TREATMENT: Tisotumab vedotin  (HuMax®-TF-ADC ) 
TITLE OF TRIAL : Dose-escalating and cohort expansion safety trial of tissue factor specific ant ibody drug 
conjugate tisotumab vedotin (HuMax® -TF-ADC) in patients with locally advanced and/ or metastatic solid 
tumors known to express tissue factor   
TRIAL  CENTERS : The Dose Escalation part  of the trial is planned to be perfor med in a maximum of three 
sites in Denmark,  the United Kingdom  (UK)  and the United States  of America (USA). The Cohort Expansion 
part of the trial is planned to be performed in  the ongoing countries and in Hungary and potentially Belgium . 
TRIAL  PERIOD : A Dose Escalation  part will be followed by a Cohort  
Expansion part. The trial will be stopped when the last patient included in the 
Cohort  Expansion part completes the trial or wh en the last ongoing patient 
has discontinued treatment  and attended the Safety follow -up Visit, 
whichever occurs first .  PHASE OF 
DEVELOPMENT:  
Dose Escalation part: 
Phase I  
Cohort Expansion part : 
Phase II  
PLANNED TRIAL  DATES:  Enrol lment period is planned  to last approximately  21 months.  
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Trial Objective:  To establish the tolerability  of HuMax ® tissue factor antibody drug conjugate 
tisotumab vedotin [ HuMax- TF-ADC ]) dosed three times every four weeks  (3q4wk ) in a mixed population 
of pa tients with specified solid tumors.  
Secondary Trial Objective(s): 
•To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended dose for phase II trials  (RP2D)
with tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  dosed 3q4wk .
•To establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) pro file of tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  dosed 3q4wk .
•To evaluate the anti -tumor activity of tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  dosed 3q4wk in a mixed
population of patients with specified solid tumors.
TRIAL  DESIG N AND METHODOLOGY: 
The trial is a safety trial of HuMax -TF-ADC dosed 3 q4wk (Days 1, 8 and 15 of each 28- day cycle) in a mixed 
population of patients with solid tumors known to express tissue factor (TF) and where the use of systemically 
administered tubulin inhibitors is part of standard of care ( SoC). The trial consists of  two parts,  an open- label, 
multicenter , phase I , Dose Escalation part,  followed by an open -label phase II Cohort Expansion part .  
The Dose Escalation part is a standard 3 (+3) design. In each dose cohort, the initial three  patien ts must 
include at least two different cancer types. A maximum of three  dose levels is anticipated. Patients may 
receive up to 12 cycles of treatment.  
The Cohort Expansion part will have a parallel group design, with a minimum of 20 and a maximum of 30 patients in two or three  indication  arms. Patients in the Cohort Expansion part will be treated with the 
RP2D from the Dose Escalation part. Patients may receive up to nine  cycles of treatment.  
A Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will evaluate safety data during the Dose Escalation part of the trial 
and will convene in the event of safety signals in the Cohort Expansion part of the trial.  
Severe ocular toxicity has been observed at 1.2 mg/kg 3q4wk (the RP2D for the  Cohort Expansion  part), and 
an urgent safety Protocol Amendment 4.0 has been implemented.  Pat ients will not further receive the dosing 
schedule 3q4wk; instead tisotumab vedotin 2.0 mg/kg will be administ ered once every three weeks (q3wk).  
TRIAL  POPULATION AND MAIN CRITERIA FOR INCLUSION/EXCLUSION:  
The patient population in the Dose Escalation part  will encompass patients with advanced (locally advanced 
and/or metastatic) cancer of the ovary, cervix, endometrium , bladder, prostate ( castration -resistant prostate 
cancer [ CRPC ]), esophagus or lung ( non-small cell lung cancer [ NSCLC ]) who have failed available standard

NUMBER OF PATIENTS : Approximately  46 to 63 patient s will be screened to ensure that 32 to 44 patients 
(anticipated screen failure rate of 30%) comp lete the trial.  
In the Dose Escalation part: 12 to 24 patients are planned to be enrolled: three  to six patients per dose level 
for three  dose levels (plus a potential intermediate dose cohort).  
In the Cohort Expansion part: 20 to 30 patients are planned to be enrolled in two or three  indication  arms.  
TRIAL  TREATMENT(S):  Tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  will be administered as an intravenous 
infusion over a minimum of 30 minutes  on Days 1 , 8 and 15 of each cycle ( one treatment cycle is 28 days). 
Each patient’s dose will be calculated based on the patient’s weight rounded to the nearest kilogram.  
Preventive eye therapy should be administered in relation to infusions.    
The Dose Escalation part  will evaluate tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  at doses of 0.9 m g/kg and up 
(1.2 and 1. 5 mg/kg ). The maximum tested dose will be 1.5  mg/kg. Decisions to escalate the dose of tisotumab 
vedotin (HuMax- TF-ADC)  for the next cohort will be based on the safety data obtained from the 3 (+3) 
patients during their first treatment cycle ( 28 days). A DMC  will evaluate all safety data (including serious 
adverse events [ SAEs ], adverse events [ AEs] and laboratory data) after each cohort completes Cycle  1.  
Patients in the Cohort Expansion part will be treated with the RP2D from the D ose Escalation part. Reduced 
dose can be administered in accordance with the mitigation strategies or at the discretion of the treating 
physician based on individual patient observed toxicity profile and quality of life evaluation, and after consultation a nd agreement by the sponsor Medical Officer.  
Severe ocular toxicity has been observed  at 1.2  mg/kg 3q4wk. Patients will no longer receive the 3 q4wk  
schedule; instead tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  2.0 mg/kg will be  administ ered once q3wk , on Day  1 
of each 21 -day cycle.

DURATION OF TREATMENT:  In the Dose Escalation part t he patients will be treated for four  cycles or 
until unacceptable toxicity. After four cycles, if there is evidence of the patient benefiting from treatment, at 
the discretion of the treating physician on the patient status, there is an option to continue in the trial for up 
to a maximum of eight  additional cycles ( 32 weeks) or until the patient withdraw s from the  treatment/tria l 
due to the withdraw al criteria . The treatment period will ha ve a maximum duration of 48 weeks . 
In the Cohort Expansion part  patients will be treated similarly but up to a maximum of nine  cycles (36  weeks , 
or less after changing to the once q3wk dosing scheme) ) or until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression, 
at the discretion of the treating physician . 
At the end of the planned number of cycles,  Genmab will ensure provision of continued treatment to patients 
with clinical benefit defined as stable disease  (SD) or better, until unacceptable toxicity or P rogress ive 
Disease (P D) is observed.

1 Additional treatment only if patient shows response of SD or better.  
2 If the patient shows PD, is to start new anti -cancer treatment or withdraws from trial due to another  reason during treatment or Follow -up period, the EOT Visit should be performed 
as soon as possible after decision of withdrawal. If patient completes all Follow -up visits, the EOT Visit should be performed 4 weeks after end of Follow -up Visit 4  period . 
3 For patients who withdraw from the trial before Follow -Up Visit 1. Only SAEs will be assessed.  
4 The patient shall stay at hospital for at least 2 hours after the infusion and may be requested to stay longer at the discret ion of the investigator. 
5 The specified visit windows are in accordance with the previous visit. Visit 1 of Cycle 2 and onwards should be performed 7 days ± 3 days after Day 22 of the previous cycle. 
6 Informed consent must be obtained before or at the Screening Visit window i.e., may  be reasonably prior to the screening date.  
7 Signs and symptoms occurring between Visit 0 and first infusion should be recorded as medical history (see Section 10.2 for details). SAEs should be reported as of the signing of 
the informed consent.  
8 Height is only assessed at the Screening Visit. During the trial, only body weight is measured on the first dosing day  in a cycle , as part of the dose calculation. If body weight is 
assessed ≤  7 days before the first day of the planned dosing  in a cycle , this value can be used to calculate dose.   
9 Temperature, blood pressure and heart rate. Within each visit, preferably the same e quipment shall be used for vital signs measurements. Vital signs should be assessed just before 
and no longer than 30 minutes before infusion start, during and after the infusions until 2  hours after end of infusions, as indicated in Section  10.5. 
10 Optional.  
11 One ECG will be performed at screening. Three ECGs should be performed at least 2 minutes apart before infusion of the trial drug on Visit 1 for all cycles, in accordance with 
the ECG Specifications Ma nual.

12 Within 4 weeks prior to Visit C1 -V1. All patients will have a CT -scan with contrast of thorax, abdomen and pelvis performed as part of the screening procedure. If a CT -scan has 
been performed within 4  weeks prior to Visit C1 -V1 as part of standar d procedure, it is acceptable as screening CT -scan for the trial. If there is suggestion of brain metastases/tumors, 
a CT -scan of the head will be performed before inclusion. 
13 At the end of every second cycle, i.e., on Day 1 of Cycles 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11,  CT-scans can be performed up to 7 days before Day 1 of the relevant cycle to ensure result to be 
available before subsequent dosing. Additional scans on 21 days (± 7 days) after Day 15 of Cycle 12, and at the EOT Visit. To be completed as indicated to con firm response, new 
symptoms, end of trial or physician discretion. 
14 Radionuclide bone scan and PSA will be performed for CRPC patients. Radionuclide bone scan will be performed at screening, ev ery 16  weeks (i.e., Day 1 of Cycles 5 and 9), 
and upon clini cal indication. If there is suspicion of progression, another bone scan will be performed 12 weeks later. The screening radionuclide bone scan can be performed up to 
4 weeks prior to Visit C1 -V1. 
15 Hematology, biochemistry, serology and pregnancy test wi ll be analyzed locally at the sites. All other laboratory parameters will be analyzed centrally.  
16 For patients with ovarian  and endometrial  cancer.  In patients with ovarian cancer, the screening sample should be taken within two weeks before starting th e treatment. 
17 Flow cytometry only on Cycle 1 and Cycle 5. 
18 HBsAg, anti -HBs and anti -HBc, Hepatitis C and antibodies to CMV antigen will be assessed at screening for all patients; for CMV, anti -IgG and IgM will be assessed and, in 
case of positive IgM, it will be confirmed with CMV PCR; for HCV, anti -IgG will be assessed and, if positive, it will be confirmed with HCV PCR. HPV only for patients with 
cervical cancer. At EOT, only antibodies to CMV antigen will be assessed. 
19 See Table 2 and Section 10.17 or details of PK samplings. 
20 Archived biopsy material can be forwarded if a sample is available. If no sample is available, a new tumor biopsy must be obt ained at least 2 weeks before dosing to e nsure healing 
of wound. 
21 Only on Cycle 5. 
22 Patients experiencing ocular symptoms must be referred to an ophthalmologist for prompt review (preferably within 72 hours an d no later than within one week).

8.1.1.1 Screening P hase (Visit 0)  
Patients will provide written informed consent. Medical history, physical examination, 
laboratory studies , ophthalmological evaluation and CT imaging will be performed to 
determine baseline disease status and t rial eligibility. The medical history, physical 
examination , potential biopsies, ECG  and laboratory  studies (including biomarkers) must be 
performed within 21 days before  trial entry (Visit C1 -V1). CT im aging must be performed 
within four  weeks before  trial entry (Visit C1 -V1).  
A patient may be rescreened one time only. A rescreening must be approved by the sponsor to 
ensure that the safety of the patient is not compromised.   
8.1.1.2 Treatmen t Phase ( C1 to C X)  
Dose Escalation Part  
The investigator must have eval uated the patient’s eligibility and confirm receipt of sponsor 
decision and patient number  before the patient’s first infusion. 
Tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  will be a dministered on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 -day 
cycle . Dose  escalation to MTD is anticipat ed to involve up to three dose levels with an 
anticipated maxim um dose level of 1.5 mg/kg.  
Patients will receive four cycles ( each with three doses) of tisotumab vedotin 
(HuMax -TF-ADC)  at 28-day intervals. Thus, the treatment period will last for 16 weeks  or 
until the patient withdraw s from the  treatment/trial due to the withdraw al criteria .  
After four cycles, if there is evidence of the patient benefitting from treatment, at the discretion 
of the treating physician, there is an option to continue in the t rial for up to a maximum of  eight  
additional cycles ( 32 weeks) or until  the patient withdraw s from the treatment/trial due to the 
withdraw al criteria .  
The treatment period will have a maximum duration of 48 weeks.  
Cohort Expansion Part  
The investigator must have evaluated the patient’s eligibility before the patient’s first infusion.  
Tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC) will be administered on D ay 1, 8 and 15 of a 28- day 
cycle.  Twenty  to 30 patients will receive up to nine  cycles of three  doses of HuMax -TF-ADC  
at the dose determined by the sponsor in agreement with the DMC based on the Dose 
Escalation part of the trial.  
Severe ocular toxicity has been observed at 1.2 mg/kg 3q4wk. Patients will no further receive 
the 3q4wk schedule; instead tisotumab vedotin (H uMax -TF-ADC) 2.0 mg/kg will be 
administered once q3wk, on Day 1 of each 21- day cycle , regardless of the prior dose(s) 
administered. The next dose of tisotumab vedotin cannot be administered until at least 21 days 
have elapsed since the last administration.

Page 57 of 126 
The treatment period will last for up to 36 weeks (or less after changing to the once q3wk 
dosing scheme) or until unacceptable  toxicity or disease progression  at the discretion of the 
treating physician .  
8.1.1.3 Unscheduled Visit  (U1 to UX)  
If deemed necessary  by the investigator , the patient may be called in for an unscheduled 
visit(s). During an unscheduled visit the investigator can perform any trial relevant  clinical or 
laboratory assessment s deemed necessary. The visit date and reason for visit must be rec orded  
in the patient’s medical records and electronic case report form (eCRF ). 
8.1.1.4 Follow -up Phase  
Dose Escalation P art 
Patients w ill attend four  follow up visits  (FU1 to FU4) at six  weekly intervals (± 7 days).  
If the patient withdraws from treatment and has not started new anti -cancer treatment, or if the 
patient completes all treatment cycles, the patient will be followed by the site every six  weeks 
for a maximum of four  visits or until other treatment is initiated, for a maximum of 24 weeks. 
Then, the patie nt will return for an End of Trial (EOT) Visit.  
Cohort Expansion Part  
No follow -up visits will be included in the Cohort Expansion part . 
8.1.1.5 End of Trial Visit (EOT)  
Dose Escalation Part  
If a patient completes all follow -up visits , the EOT Visit should be per formed four weeks after 
the end of the Follow -up Visit 4  period.  
In case of withdrawal from the trial, the EOT Visit will be performed as soon as possible. The 
EOT Visit will include most assessments performed at the Screening Visit, and response 
assessme nts. 
Cohort Expansion Part  
If the patient shows PD, is to start new anti- cancer treatment or withdraws from trial due to 
another re ason during treatment, the EOT Visit should be performed as soon as possible after 
decision of withdrawal. 
The EOT Visit will include most assessments performed at the Screening Visit, and response 
assessments.  
8.1.1.6 Safety Follow -up Visit  
Dose Escalation Part  
Patients who withdraw from the trial before F ollow -up Visit 1 will return for a Safety Follow -
up Visit 30 days after the last  dose of IMP . In the Safety Follow -up Visit, only SAEs will be

assessed . If the patient has died within the 30 days this should be entered as an AE in the e CRF 
and reported as an SAE.  
Cohort Expansion Part  
Patients who withdraw from the trial will return f or a Safety Follow -up Visit 30 days after the 
last dose of IMP. In the Safety Follow -up Visit, only SAEs will be assessed. If the patient has 
died within the 30 days this should be entered as an AE in the eCRF and reported as an SAE.  
8.2 Trial  Duration  and End  of Trial  
The enro llment period is planned to last approximately 21 months.  
The trial will be stopped when the last patient  enrolled in the Cohort Expansion part  completes 
the trial or when the last ongoing patient  has discontinued treatment  and attended the Safety 
Follow -up Visit, whichever occurs first.  
The end of trial (“trial completion”) is defined as the date of the last protocol -specified 
visit/assessment for the last patient  in the trial or the date the trial is closed by the sponsor, 
whichever occurs first.  
All materials or supplies provided by the sponsor will be returned to the sponsor or designee 
upon trial completion, as directed by the site monitor. The IEC/IRB will be notified when the 
trial has been completed.  
Genmab A/S reserves the right to temporarily suspend or prematurely discontinue this trial  
either at a single site, multiple sites or at all sites at any time for reasons including, but not limited to, safety or ethical issues, inaccurate or incomplete data recording, noncompliance, or  
unsatisfactory enrol lment with respect to quality or quantity.  
If the trial is prematurely terminated or suspended, Genmab A/S (or its representative) will 
inform the investigators/institutions and the regulatory authority(ies) of the termination or suspe nsion and the reason(s) for the termination or suspension, in accordance with applicable 
regulatory requirement(s). The IEC/IRB should also be informed and provided with reason(s) 
for the termination or suspension by the sponsor or by the investigator/inst itution, as specified 
by the applicable regulatory requirement(s). In addition, arrangements will be made for the return of all unuse d trial  drug and other materials or supplies provided by the sponsor . 
8.2.1 Trial  Stopping Criteria  
If any of the following occur , administration of the trial drug will be stopped and no additional 
patients will be enrolled into the trial:  
1) Grade ≥ 3 a naphylactic reaction to tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  in any patient . 
2) Other events not including DLT that , in the judgment of the s ponsor Medical Officer, are 
deemed serious enough to warrant immediate review  and potential stop of other dosing  by 
the DMC . 
3) Any other safety finding assessed as related to tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  that, 
in the opinion of the sponsor, contraindicat es further dosing of trial patients .

Page 59 of 126 
If any of the above -listed events occur, a prompt cumulative review of safety data and the 
circumstances of the event in question will be conducted by the DMC  to recommend whether 
dosing and trial entry should be resume d, whether the protocol will be modified, or whether 
the trial will be discontinued permanently. Review and approval by the sponsor’s Safety 
Committee is required for resumption of the trial in the event that the trial is interrupted because 
of one of the above -listed events. Where applicable, regulatory authorities IECs/IRBs will be 
notified of any actions taken with the trial. 
Any patients who have already received the trial drug and are currently in the trial at the time 
trial stopping criteria are met w ill continue to be monitored by the investigator for safety.  
Withdrawal criteria for individual patients are provided in Section  8.3.4.

8.3.3 Patient Allocation Procedure 
Allocation of patients will be controlled by the CRO.  
When a potential patient is identified at a site, the site personnel must contact the CRO for 
allocation in accordance to S ection  8.4.9.5. If there is an opening in the currently enrolling 
cohort, the site will be given approval to start the screening process. 
If there is no openi ng in the currently enrolling cohort, the CRO will place the patient on a list 
of potential patient s. If another patient fails the screening process, the CRO will alert the site 
that has the next patient on the waiting list. If the patient is still eligible, the site will be given 
approval to start the screening process.

• Dose delay of more than two  weeks due to toxicity possibly related to tisotumab vedotin 
(HuMax -TF-ADC)  (except for dose delays due to neuropathy , skin rash, keratitis  and 
conjunctivitis )*. 
• Pregnancy.  
• Patient  choice.  
• Investigator or sponsor deci sion. 
* Th e exception  is due to the fact that decrease to CTCAE grade 1 intensity for neuropathy , 
skin rash, keratitis  and conjunctivitis may last for more than two  weeks . 
8.3.4.2 Criteria for Patient  Withdrawal from the Trial  
Patient s will be withdrawn from the trial at any time for any of the following reasons:  
• Patient  choice.  
• Investigator or s ponsor decision.  
• Initiation of new anti -cancer treatment .  
• Lost to follow -up.

treatment.   
• Disease progression.  
8.3.4.3 Evaluations at Withdrawal  from T reatment  
When a patient withdraws from treatment, he/she should return for follow -up visits  and the 
End of Treatment page must be filled in.  
8.3.4.4 Evaluations at Withdrawal from the T rial 
When a patient withdraws from the trial, investigators should attempt to obtain information  
and perform an EOT  Visit and a 30 day Safety Follow -up Visit. The EOT Visit should be 
performed  as soon as possible and prior to initiation of new treatment  and will inclu de most 
assessments performed at the Screening Visit, and response assessments ( Section 12.5.3).  
In the Dose Escalation part of the trial, the Safety Follow -up Visit should only be performed if 
the patient with draws before attending Follow -up Visit 1.  Only SAEs will be assessed  at the 
Safety Follow -up Visit. For patients  considered as lost to follow -up, the investigator should 
make an effort (at least one  phone call or one  written message to the patient), and document 
his/her effort (date and summary of the phone call or copy of the written message in the source 
documents), to complete the final evaluation. All results of these evaluations and observations, together with a narrative description of the reason(s) f or removing the patient, must be recorded 
in the source documents. The primary reason for withdrawal will be recorded in the eCRF  on 
End of Trial page .

8.4.4 Treatment of Infusion -Related Reactions  
In the initial patients , few infusion- related reaction s, all being CTCAE grade 1, have been 
reported during the Dose Escalation part of the GEN701 trial.  However infusion- related 
reactions  have been observed in one  animal during the pre -clinical studies and with other 
cleavable MMAE based ADCs. Patients should therefore be monitored during infusion.  
• If an infusion- related reaction occurs, the infusion should be interrupted and appropriate 
medical management instituted. The infusions may be restarted at the investigator ’s 
discretion. 
• Patients who have experienced prior infusion- related CTCAE grade ≥ 3 reactions  in the 
trial should be pre -medicated before all subsequent infusions with an antihistamine and/or 
acetaminophen and/or corticosteroid at the investigator’s discretion.  
• If anaphylaxis occurs, administration of trial drug should be discontinue d immediately and 
permanently and appropriate medical therapy should be administered.  
8.4.5 Dose Modification and Mitigation Plan s  
Dose modifications should be preapproved by the s ponsor Medical Officer. Below the dose 
modification and mitigation plans are spec ified according to the once q3wk treatment scheme : 
8.4.5.1 Dose Modification and Mitigation Plan for Skin Toxicity  
• Ongoing , acute or chronic inflammatory skin disease is  an exclusion criterion in this trial 
(see Section 8.3.2) . 
• Frequent assessments of skin should be performed during Cycle 1:  
o At Day s 1 and 15.  
• Assessment of skin during the remaining cycles will be performed on Day 1 in each cycle 
before dosing . 
• Patients ’ information to include information about potential skin toxicity and patients will 
be instructed to contact the investigator  and/or the site dermatologist in case of skin rash, 
pruritus  or bullae . 
• Investigators will be trained in skin monitoring and action to findings . 
• Dose adjustment  for skin toxicity should be managed as follows : 
o For CTCAE grade 1 macular -papular skin rash: C ontinue dosing of tisotumab 
vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  as planned, treat with a potent topical steroid 
(betamethasone valerate or eq uivalen t) once daily  for up to one  week,  facial areas 
with a moderate topical steroid ( hydrocortisone butyrate 0.1% or equivalent) twice 
daily  for up to one  week;  thereafter every other day for a maximum of three  weeks .  
o For CTCAE  grade 2 macular -papular skin rash: Postpone dosing of tisotumab 
vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  until skin rash has decreased to grade 1, then continue 
dosing of tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  as planned. Treat the skin rash with 
  Protocol No.GEN702

a potent topical steroid (betamethasone valerate or equivalen t) once daily  for up to 
one week ; facial areas with a moderate topical steroid ( hydrocortisone butyrate 
0.1% or equivalent) twice daily , followed by dosing once every other day for a 
maximum of three weeks.  
o For CTCAE grade ≥ 3 macular -papular skin rash: Stop dosing (patient withdrawal) 
and treat the skin rash with a potent topical steroid (betamethasone valerate or 
equivalen t) once daily for up to one  week, followed by dosing once every other day 
for a maximum of three weeks.  
o Vesicular skin reaction: postpone dosing until recovery and continue on half dose  
until the end of treatment  period. 
• Withdrawal criteria  for skin toxicity : 
o Patients with CTCAE grade ≥ 3 macular -papular skin rash (covering ≥  30% of body 
surface area [ BSA ]). 
o Patient s with TEN, Steven Johnson and CTCAE grade  ≥ 3 cutaneous vasculitis.  
o Patients with CTCAE  grade 1  treatment -related  bullous dermatitis or skin bullae 
(blister) ≥ 0.5 cm . 
8.4.5.2 Dose Modification for Peripheral Neuropathy and Neutropenia  
Peripheral neuropathy should be managed using a combination of dose delay and reduct ion to 
2/3 of the initial dose:  
• For new or wo rsening CTCAE grade 2 or 3 neuropathy: hold dose until neuropathy 
improves to CTCAE   grade ≤ 1, and then restart  at 2/3 of the initial dos e until end of trial  
treatment .  
• For CTCAE grade 4 peripheral neuropathy: stop dosing  and the patient should be 
withdrawn  from treatment. 
Neutropenia should be managed by dose delays and dose reductions:  
• Dosing  should be held for CTCAE grade 3 or 4 neutrop enia until resolution to 
CTCAE  grade ≤  2.  
• Growth factor support should be considered for subsequent cycles in patients who 
experience CTCAE  grade 3 or 4 neutropenia.  
• In patients with recurrent CTCAE grade 4 neutropenia despite the use of growth factors, 
discontinuation or dose reduction of trial drug to 2/3 of the initial dose until end of trial 
treatment may be considered  after discussion with the sponsor Medical Officer . 
8.4.5.3 Dose Modifications and Mitigation Plan for Ocular Adverse Events  
Events of conjunctivitis and keratitis have been report ed in patients treated with tisotumab 
vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC). To prevent occurrence and ensure appropriate handling, events

Preventive measures  for all patients : 
• Use of preservative- free lubricating eye d rops from the start of trial treatment until the end 
of treatment .  
• Avoid use of contact lenses while treated with tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC).  
• Use of  refrigerator- based eye cooling pads during infusion, e.g. THERA  PEARL Eye Mask 
or similar. To be applied immediately before infusion in accordance with the instructions 
provided with the eye cooling pads . 
• Administration of local ocular vasoconstrictor before infusion (brimonidine tartrate 0.2% 
eye drops or similar, 3 drops in each eye immediately prior t o start of infusion; otherwise 
to be used in accordance with the product prescribing information).  If the patient does not 
tolerate ocular vasoconstrictors due to adverse reactions, continued treatment with these may be stopped at the discretion of the investigator and following discussion with the Genmab Medical Officer.  
• Application of steroid eye drops for 3 days from the day of infusion (dexamethasone 0.1% 
eye drops or equivalent, 1 drop in each eye 3 times daily for 3 days [first drop to be given 
before start of infusion], otherwise to be used in accordance to product prescribing 
information) . 
In case of any ocular symptoms : 
Conjunctivitis:  
Grading:  All events of conjunctivitis should be graded according to both:  
• Ophthalmological grading based on the objective eye -examination findings performed by 
the ophthalmologist. 
• CTCAE grading system based on National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (NCI -CTCAE) version 4.03 ( NCI-CTCAE v4.03, 2010 ) assessed  by 
the investigator . 
Dose delay and dose modification:  
• CTCAE grade 1 conjunctivitis: Hold dosing until the event is managed effectively by 
topical treatment initiated by the ophthalmologist (according to treatment guidelines below). When the event is mana ged effectively the patient can be re -treated with the same 
dose of trial drug as being administered prior to the event onset.  
• CTCAE grade 2 conjunctivitis: Hold dosing. Topical treatment should be initiated by the 
ophthalmologist (according to treatment guidelines below). When the event has improved 
to ≤ CTCAE grade 1, dosing of trial drug can be resumed at a reduced dose (please refer 
to dose modification scheme below).  
o In case of recurrence of conjunctivitis CTCAE grade 2 the patient should hold dosing  and topical treatment should be initiated by the ophthalmologist (according 
to treatment guidelines below). When the event is CTCAE grade ≤ 1, dosing of trial

• Ophthalmological grading based on the objective eye -examination findings performed by 
the ophthalmologist. 
• CTCAE grading system based on NCI -CTCAE criteria assessed by the investigator 
(CTCAE version 4.03).  
Dose delay  and dose modification:  
• CTCAE grade ≤ 2 keratitis: Hold dosing until the event is managed effectively by topical 
treatment  (according to treatment guidelines below) initiated by the ophthalmologist. When 
the event is ≤ CTCAE grade 1, dosing of trial drug can be resumed at a reduc ed dose (please 
refer to dose modification scheme below).  
o In case of re currence of CTCAE grade ≤  2 keratitis, the patient should hold dosing 
and topical treatment (according to treatment guidelines below) should be initiated 
by the ophthalmologist. When t he event is CTCAE grade ≤  1, dosing of trial drug

8.4.5.4 Dose M odification for QTcF Changes in the Electrocardiogram  
Prolongation of QTcF interval during the trial should be managed as follows:  
• For CTCAE grade  1 QTcF interval prolon gation (450 to 480 msec): check electrolytes 
(calcium, magnesium and potassium) prior to next dosing, but no dose adjustment or dosing hold is required.  
• For CTCAE grade  2 QTcF interval prolongation (481 to 500 msec): hold dosing until 
improvement to g rade 1 or lower and check elect rolytes (calcium, magnesium and 
potassium) and substitute until normal levels ; then dose can be restarted and ECGs should 
be performed at least every other day .  
If the QTcF interval prolongation is not related to electrolyte abnormality, hold dosing until improvement to g rade 1 or lower ; then  next infusions may be restarted at half of the initial 
infusion rate; ECGs should be performed at least every other day . 
• For CTCAE grade  3 QTcF interval prolongation (≥ 501 ms ec on at least two  separate 
ECGs): stop dosing.  Then, check electrolytes (calcium, magnesium and potassium) and

substitute until normal levels; ECGs should be performed at least daily; consider obtaining 
cardiology consult. Please see Section  8.3.4.1. 
8.4.5.5 Dose Modification for I ncreased Liver E nzymes  
In case of grade ≥ 3 AE associated to liver enzymes elevation, regardless of its relationship 
with the IMP, the site must contact the sponsor Medical Officer  before next dosing of the 
patient, in order to decide whether there should be any dose adjustment, delay or withdrawal of the patient. 
8.4.5.6 Dose Modification for Mucositis 
• Dose modification for mucositis: 
o Patients with CTCAE grade 3 mucositis: hold dos ing until mucositis improves to 
CTCAE grade  2. Mucositis should be treated  according to local practice. 
• Withdrawal criteria for mucositis:  
o Patients with CTCAE grade ≥  4 mucositis: the patient should be withdrawn from 
treatment.  
8.4.6 Precautions  
Patients receiving th e following therapy during and three we eks after  the last  treatment with 
tisotumab vedotin (HuMax- TF-ADC)  should be monitored closely for adverse reactions:

8.4.7 Dose Escalation 
8.4.7.1 Dose Escalation  Overvie w 
The Dose Escalation part  is a standard 3 (+3) design which will evaluate tisotumab vedotin 
(HuMax -TF-ADC)  at doses of 0.9 mg/kg and up to a maximum of 1.5 mg/kg. Dose reduction 
can be considered if the MTD is exceeded at 0.9 mg/kg.  
Decisions to escalate the dose of tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  for the next cohort will 
be based on the safety data obtained from the 3 (+3) patient s during their first treatment cycle 
(28 days ). A DMC  will evaluate all safety data (including SAEs , AEs and laboratory data) after 
each cohort completes Cycle  1. All patients in a cohort must be observed for at least four weeks 
after the first infusion before data are sent to the DMC  to review.  
  Protocol No.GEN702  
Tisotumab vedotin (HuMax®-TF-ADC) Final 5.0 (incorporating Protocol Amendment 4)  
in mixed solid tumors    06 Jul 2017  
 
Page 76 of 126 
Based on the results presented in these safety profiles, the DMC  will make a recommend ation 
regarding  dose escalation . The recommendation will be discussed and confirmed by  the 
sponsor’s internal Safety Committee, who will ultimately decide whether dose escalation shall 
occur. In addition, the DMC  will be provided all available safety data.  
Patients who discontinue the trial during the first cycle for reasons other than a DLT should be 
replaced.  As the drug exposure of such patients is considered insufficient to form  a basis for a 
dose escalation decision, they are not included in the evaluation of DLTs in 3 ( +3) patients.  
For this trial, the MTD will be defined as the highest  dose level below the dose at which 
≥ two patients experience DLTs within the  three to six patients of one  cohort are observed. The 
DMC  and the sponsor’s Safety C ommittee may  decide to implement intermediate doses below 
that at which ≥  2 DLTs were identified to ensure patient s safety and better define the MTD.    
At the expected MTD up  to six  patients will be treated.  
8.4.7.2 Dose  Escalation R ules 
Each cohort will enroll  three patients . If a DLT  is observed during the first treatment cycle, the 
cohort for the current dose level will be  expanded to enroll an additional three patients.  
The classic 3  (+3) design  will be  implemented as follows:  
• Three patients are allocated per new dose level until a DLT  is observed.  
• In each cohort, a minimum of one  day between the dosing of the  patients will be 
implemented.  
• All patients in a cohort must be observed for at least four  weeks after the first infusion 
before data are sent to the DMC  to review and decide on dose escalation.  
• If a DLT is observed within the first cycle, the cohort on the corresponding dose level will 
be expanded with three additional  patients.  Depending on the nature of the DLT , the DMC 
may require that at least one  patient of the  additional three patients to be included at the 
same dose level should have the same cancer type as the patient who had the DLT.  
• If no other patient with  DLT is observed in the expanded cohort, the trial will continue 
escalation to next dose level.    
• If at least one additional patient with a  DLT (i .e., ≥ 2 patients with DLTs within the  
six patients) is observed on the same dose level, additional patients will not be enrolled at 
that dose level . The dose will  be de -escalated  until a dose level where three  patients with 
no observed DLTs or, six  patients have been treated with ≤  1 instance of DLT observed. 
This will be the MTD.  
In order to adequately assess the safety of the mixed population in this trial, dose cohorts will 
be partially stratified to have  ≥ 2 different cancer types represented in the cohort .

the trial number and subsequently a 3-  or 4- digit number that uniquely identifies a patient at a 
Screening V isit. For example, a screening number in this trial could be “S702034”. 
Patients  who have c omplied with all selection criteria will receive a patient number upon 
enrol lment in the trial. A patient number consists of the trial number combined with a 3-  or 
4-digit number that uniquely identifies a patient during the trial. For example, patient 12 in this 
trial would be uniquely identified by the combined code “ 702012 ”. 
A master log of all consented patients will be maintained at the sites and will document all screening failures (i.e., patients who are consented but do not meet the trial eligibilit y criteria) 
including the reason for screening failure.

9 TRIAL  EVALUATIONS  
Trial  evaluations by visit are detailed in the Schedules of trial procedures in Table 1  and 
Table 3 according to the initially designed tre atment scheme. Trial evaluations by visit for the 
Cohort Expansion part after implementation of the urgent safety measure (Protocol 
Amendment 4.0) are detailed in Table 5. A description of the methods of assessments is 
provided in Section 10. 
All patient s who are assigned a patient  number and receive any trial drug will be followed 
according to the protocol regardless of the number of doses received, unless consent is 
withdrawn. The investigator must notify the sponsor or designee of deviations from protocol 
visits or evaluations, and these evaluations, if applicable, must be rescheduled or performed at the nearest possible time to the original schedule. Protocol deviations will be recorded on the source document with an explanation for the deviations and any trial -specific eCRF or logs 
designated for capturing protocol deviations, if applicable for the trial . The investigator must 
comply with the applicable requirements r elated to the reporting of protocol deviations to the 
IEC/IRB.  
Patient s will be instructed to call the trial personnel to report any abnormalities during the 
intervals between trial visits and to come to the trial site if medical evaluation is needed and 
the ur gency of the situation permits.  For emergency and other unscheduled visits to a medical 
facility other than the trial site, medical records will be obtained by the investigator and made available to the sponsor or designee during monitoring visits. 
9.1 Dose Escalation Part  
9.1.1 Dose Escalation Part : Screening  (Visit 0) 
All screening procedures must be performed within 21 days before the first dose of tisotumab 
vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  on Day  1 of Cycle  1 (C1- V1), except for the CT -scan that may be 
performed withi n four weeks before C1 -V1. The screening evaluations may be carried out over 
more than one  visit.  Written informed consent and any locally required privacy act document 
authorization must be obtained prior to performing any protocol -specific procedures, in cluding 
screening evaluations.  
A patient may be rescreened one time only. A rescreening must be approved by the sponsor to 
ensure that the safety of the patient is not compromised.   
9.1.2 Dose Escalation Part : Treatment  
The Dose Escalation part of the trial must be run in phase  I units with cardiopulmonary

10 METHODS OF ASSESSMENT 
Trial  procedures will be performed on the trial dates noted in Table 1 and Table 3 according to 
the initially designed treatment scheme , and in Table 5 after implementation of the urgent 
safety measure (Protocol Amendment 4.0) . A descrip tion of the different assessments is 
provided below.  
10.1 Demographics  
Date of birth  (day and month will be  anonymized if required by local regulations) ; ethnic origin 
and gender will be recorded in the e CRF.  
10.2 Medical H istory  
Any relevant past and all  current d iseases will be recorded in the e CRF  including staging (T NM 
staging system) . In addition, all prior cancer treatment regimens will be recorded  including 
clinical response for the last regimen (and earlier lines of therapy if available) . Non- serious 
AEs (si gns, symptoms and diagnosis) occurring between Visit 0 (Screening)  and first treatment 
(C1-V1) should be recorded as Medical History.  
Serious adverse events  should be reported from the time of signing informed consent both on 
the AE form of the eCRF and on SAE reporting form (as described in Section 11.4.3) . 
10.3 Height and W eight  
Height (without shoes) must be measured at Visit 0  (Screening)  and recorded in the e CRF 
rounded to nearest centimeter. Body weight (without overcoat and s hoes) will be measured at 
Visit 0  (Screening) , at Day 1  of each cycle, as part of the dose calculation, and at EOT , and 
will be recorded in the e CRF rounded to nearest kilogram.  
If body weight is assessed  seven  days or less before the day of the planned  dosing  at Day 1 , 
this value can be used.  
10.4 Physical E xamination  
A general physical examination should include general appearance and the following body 
systems  need to be examined : lymph nodes, mouth and throat (non- tumor bearing parts), lungs, 
cardiovascular  system, abdomen, extremities, musculoskeletal system, neurological system 
and skin (for assessment of skin reactions refer to Section 10.12) . The outcome of the physical 
examination must be recorded in the e CRF . 
10.5 Vital S igns 
Vital signs should be recorded in the e CRF including temperature, blood pressure and heart 
rate. Within each visit, preferably the same equipment  shall be used for vital signs 
measurements . Vital signs should be assessed just before  and no longer than 30 minutes  before 
infusion start , during and after the infusions until two  hours  after  the infusions, as follows :

10.6 Electrocardiogram  
Electrocardiograms will be recorded d igitally at the sites by using the standard 12 -leads. One 
ECG will be performed at screening . Three ECGs should be performed at least two  minutes 
apart before the first  infusion of the trial drug in each cycle, in accordance with the ECG 
Specifications Man ual. The digital ECGs will be transmitted from the sites electronically to a 
central laboratory for measurement of the cardiac intervals and morphologic assessment by a 
central cardiologist.  
An overall interpretation of the ECGs will be performed by the investigator, or the investigator may delegate this task to a cardiologist, if applicable.  
For the ECG recordings, the patients must be resting in a supine position for at least 10 minutes. 
Any irregularity observed or occurring during the ECGs (e.g., vomit ing, cough) should either 
result in a repeat of the ECG or be annotated on the e CRF with the description and time of the 
occurrence.  
10.7 Computerized T omography  
All patients will have a CT-scan with cont rast of thorax, abdomen and pelvis  performed during 
screening . If there is suggestion of brain metastases/tumors, a CT -scan of the head will be 
performed before inclusion.  
Up to five  target lesions (maximum two  per organ) will be defined at screening and these must 
be followed throughout the trial. Non- target lesions will also be assessed throughout the trial.

Page 86 of 126 
Scans will be repeated every six  weeks (at the end of every second cycle) during the trial 
period. If the result is PR or better , CT-scan should be repeated after four weeks  to confirm 
response . CT-scans can be performed up to seven  days before Day 1 of the relevant cycle to 
ensure result s are available before subsequent dosing.  
Additional CT -scans may  be performed at the investigators ’ discretion to confirm response or 
new symptoms. In this case , the inve stigator must choose the imaging technology based on the 
clinical indication.  
Magnetic resonance imaging can be performed instead of a CT-scan if the patient is allergic to 
iodine contrast or at the discretion of the investigator, after approval of the s ponsor.  
The reading of the surveys will be done by a radiologist. Sites should attempt to maintain the 
same radiologist throughout the trial. The overall interpretation of the evaluation shall be 
recorded in the e CRF and a copy of the evaluation reports should be kept in the patient’s file.  
10.8 ECOG Performance S tatus  
The ECOG performance status scale ( Appendix 1 ) will be used and will be assessed by the 
investigator at screening , on Day 1 of each cycle, and at the EOT  Visit.

Adverse events will be assessed and reported at each visit.  All AEs will be graded according 
to the NCI -CTCAE version 4.03 ( NCI-CTCAE v4.03, 2010 ). 
SAEs and non- serious grade 3 AEs will be reported from the investigation al site to the sponsor 
within 24 hours . In addition, all  non-serious grade 2  ocular  AEs must be reported from the 
investigational site to the sponsor within 24 hours. Weekly Safety/Medical meetings will be held in the Dose Escalation part of the trial to e valuate 
all AEs and laboratory data and follow -up information obtained during the previous week. In 
the Cohort Expansion part of the trial , bi-weekly evaluations will be made.  
Further details on AEs monitoring and reporting  are provided in Section 11 .

10.15 Radionucl ide Bone Scan  
For patients with CRPC, a radionuclide bone scan will be performed at screening , every  
12 weeks during treatment  (i.e., Day 1 of Cycles 5 and 9) , and upon clinical i ndication. If there 
is suspicion of progression, another bone scan will be performed 12 weeks later.  The screening 
radionuclide bone scan can be performed up to four weeks prior to Visit C1 -V1. 
10.16 Laboratory A ssessments 
Blood sampling will be collected for as sessment of laboratory  parameters. Some lab oratory  
samples will be tested at the site while others will be drawn and shipped for central ized testing.

hepatitis C as well as antibodies to cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) antigen and serology.  
• For CMV, anti -IgG and IgM will be assessed and, in case of positive IgM, it will be 
confirmed with CMV polymerase chain reaction (PCR).  
• For hepatitis C virus (HCV), anti -IgG will be assessed and, if positive, it will be confirmed 
with HCV PCR.  
In patients with c ervical cancer , the HPV status must also be available at screening.  
Blood samples will be drawn for assessment of antibodies to CMV  antigen after the end of 
trial drug  administration  (at the EOT  Visit).

11 ASSESSMENT AND REPORTING OF AD VERSE EVENTS  
11.1 Adverse Events Characterization  
11.1.1 Definition of Adverse Events  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient administered a pharmaceutical product 
and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. 
Adverse events include the following:  
• All suspected adverse drug reactions.  
• All reactions from medication overdose, abuse, withdrawal, sensitivity or toxicity.  
• Apparently unrelated illnesses, including the worsening of a pre -existing illness.  
• Injury or accidents. Not e that if a medical condition is known to have caused the injury or 
accident, the medical condition and the accident should be reported as two  separate AEs.  
• Abnormalities in physiological testing or physical examination findings that require 
clinical inter vention or further investigation. 
• Any clinically significant laboratory abnormality suggesting a disease and/or organ toxicity 
and is of a severity that requires active management ( i.e., changes of dose , discontinuation 
of drug, more frequent follow -up or a diagnostic investigation) , unless they are associated 
with an already reported clinical event.  
11.1.2 Definition of Infusion -Related Reaction  
Infusion- related AEs are defined as any AEs occurring during infusion where the onset date 
and time of the event occurs  within infusion time, i.e. , within the following interval: infusion 
start date and time ≤ AE onset date and time ≤ infusion end time plus one day (24 hours) and 
coded by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) preferred term as 
“Arthralgia ”, “Asthenia ”, “Bronchospasm ”, “Chills ”, “Cough ”, “Hyperhidrosis ”, “Dizziness ”, 
“Pyrexia ”, “Fatigue ”, “Flushing” , “Headache ”, “Hypertension” , “Hypotension” , “Infusion 
related reaction ”, “Lethargy ”, “Malaise” , “Myalgia ”, “Nausea ”, “Pruritus ”, “Tachycardia” , 
“Tumor pain” , or by MedDRA High Level term as “ Exfoliative conditions ” or “Dyspneas ”, 
“Dyspnoeas ”, “Breathing abnormalities ” or by MedDRA High Level Group Term as “ Allergic 
conditions ”. In addition the event should be judged related to trial drug by the investigator  
(Section 11.3.4) .  
11.1.3 Trial  Disease  
Signs and symptoms, which according to the investigator are expected and well known 
consequences of the  cancer type, both in intensity  and frequency , including disease progression 
should not be reported as AEs or SAEs. Any unexpected change in intensity or frequency should be reported as AE (or SAE if applicable). However, if a patient dies due  to disease 
progression within 30 days after the last dose of IMP, it should be reported as an AE/SAE as described in Section 8.1.1.6. 
  Protocol No.GEN702  
Tisotumab vedotin (HuMax®-TF-ADC) Final 5.0 (incorporating Protocol Amendment 4)  
in mixed solid tumors    06 Jul 2017  
 
Page 93 of 126 
11.1.3.1 Pre-existing Conditions  
In this trial, a pre -existing condition (i.e., a disorder present before the AE reporting period 
started and noted on the medical history/physical examination form) should not be reported as 
an AE. If a pre -existing condition worsens during the treatment period the event should be 
reported as an AE.  
11.1.4 Procedures  
Diagnostic and therapeutic non- invasive and invasive procedures, such as s urgery, should not 
be reported as AEs. A medical condition for which an unscheduled procedure was performed, should however be reported if it meets the definition of an AE. For example, an acute appendicitis should be reported as the AE and not the appende ctomy.  
11.2 Adverse Event Reporting  
The investigator  must report all directly observed AEs and all AEs spontaneously reported by 
the patient. A general type of question should be used similar to “Do you have any health problems?" or “Have you had any health pr oblems since your last visit?"  
The reporting period for non- serious AEs begins from the day of first treatment administration 
until the end of the Follow -up period. S erious adverse events  should be reported from the time  
the patient signs informed consent and until the end of the Follow -up period or until Safety 
Follow -up Visit. Any non- serious AEs (signs, symptoms and diagnosis) occurring between 
screening  and the day of first treatment administration should be recorded as medical history . 
All AEs that occ ur in patients during the AE reporting period must be reported, whether or not 
the event is treatment -related.  
11.3 Recording Instructions  
11.3.1 Diagnosis  
The diagnosis of an AE should be recorded if available. If no diagnosis is available each sign and symptom should be recorded as individual AEs. 
11.3.2 Intensity  
The investigator  will use the NCI -CTCAE version 4.03 to describe the severity of the AE 
(NCI-CTCAE v4.03, 2010 ). 
The grade assigned by the investigator should be the most severe  that occurred during the AE 
period. 
11.3.3 Time of onset  
Time of onset for SAEs is the date of appearance of the first symptom of the disease, e.g., if 
chest pain occurs on 01 April 2015 and the patient is hospitalized with myocardial infarction 
on 04 Apr il 2015, the onset date is 01 Apr il 2015.

in mixed solid tumors    06 Jul 2017  
 
Page 94 of 126 
11.3.4 Relationship to Trial Drug  
The investigator must assess whether or not the event is related t o tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -
TF-ADC) . If the relationship changes over time , the last judgment by the investigator should 
be reported. Rel atedness has to be assessed and reported from the first time the AE is being 
reported.  
11.3.5 Outcome  
Outcome of the AE must be judged by investigator by the following terms:  
• Recovered . 
• Recovered with sequelae . 
• Not recovered . 
• Death . 
• Unknown. 
Instructions for reporting changes in an ongoing AE during a patient's participation in the trial 
are provided in the instructions that accompany the AE e CRFs . 
11.4 Serious Adverse Event s 
11.4.1 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
Each AE will be classified by the investigator  as serious  or non- serious . This classification of 
the seriousness  of the event determines the reporting procedures to be followed.  
An AE that meets one  or more of the following criteria/outcomes is classified as serious : 
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolong ation of existing hospitalization . 
• Results in persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions . 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect . 
• Medically important . 
• Results in death . 
• Is life -threatening .  
The term "life -threatening" in the definition of "serious" refers to an event in which the patient 
was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe.  
Elective s urgery or other scheduled hospitalization periods that were planned before the patient 
was enrolled in this trial, as well as scheduled hospitalizations for trial assessments during 
administration procedures  or hospitalizations (or prolongation of  existing  hospitalization) due 
to technical or logistical issues , are not to be considered serious. However, the event must be 
reported on the AE page in the e CRF and commented upon. 
  Protocol No.GEN702  
Tisotumab vedotin (HuMax®-TF-ADC) Final 5.0 (incorporating Protocol Amendment 4)  
in mixed solid tumors    06 Jul 2017  
 
Page 95 of 126 
Medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether an AE is believed to 
be “medically important”. Medical ly important events may not be immediately life -threatening 
or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the defini tion above.  
11.4.2 Events Requiring Immediate Reporting  
11.4.2.1 Seriou s Adverse Events , Non-serious Grade  3 Adverse Events , and Non- serious 
Grade 2 Ocular Adverse Events  
Serious adverse events and non- serious grade 3 AEs will be reported from the investigational 
site to the sponsor within 24 hours  (see Section s 10.9 and 11.4.3) . In addition, all non-serious 
grade 2  ocular AEs must be reported from the investigational site to the sponsor within 24 
hours  (see Section 11.4.3) . 
11.4.2.2 Overdose and Medication Errors  
An overdose is defined as a patient  receiving a dose of the trial drug in excess of that specified 
in this protocol. All cases of overdose  must be reported to the sponsor as protocol deviations 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event. If the overdose results in an AE, the AE must also 
be recorded on the AE e CRF . If the overdose results in an SAE/non- serious 
grade  3/non- serious grade 2 ocul ar AE it must be reported within 24 hours  (see Section  11.4.3).  
Medication errors and uses outside what is foreseen in the protocol, including misuse and abuse of the product, should be reported as protocol devi ations to the sponsor within 24 hours of 
knowledge of the event. If a medication error results in an AE, the AE must also be recorded 
on the AE eCRF. Furthermore , AEs fulfilling the criteria in S ection 11.4.2.1 must be reported 
accordingly.  
Overdose , medication errors, misuse and abuse  do not automatically make an AE serious, but 
if the consequences are serious, for example death or hospitalizations, the event is serious and must be reported as an SAE. 
11.4.2.3 Pregnancy  
Any pregnancy that occurs during trial participation must be reported  and the patient will be 
withdrawn from treatment immediately . To ensure patient safety, each pregnancy must be 
reported to the sponsor or designee within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence.  The 
pregnancy must be followed to determine outcome (including premature termination) and 
status of mother and child. Pregnancy complications and elective terminations for medical 
reasons must be reported as an AE or SAE. Spontaneous abortions must  be reported as an SAE. 
The child must be followed to at least age one  month. 
Any SAE occurring in association with a pregnancy brought to the investigator’s attention after the patient has completed the trial and considered by the investigator as possibly  related to the 
trial drug , must be promptly reported to the sponsor or designee.

11.4.4 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify, as appropriate and according to local 
regulations, both the local regulatory a uthority and other regulatory agencies about the safety 
of the product under clinical investigation. Prompt notification of SAEs by the i nvestigator to 
the sponsor is essential so that legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of pa tients are met.  
The s ponsor will ensure that all relevant information about Suspected Unexpected Serious 
Adverse Reactions  (SUSAR) is recorded and reported as soon as possible , but within a 
maximum of 15  days (fatal or life -threaten ing SUSARs within a maximum of seven  days) of 
first knowledge by the sponsor or designee, to the competent regulatory authorities and/or to 
the Ethics Committee according to the applicable local regulatory requirements.  Relevant 
follow -up information of fatal or life -threatening SUSARs will be communicated sub sequently 
within an additional eight  days.   
In the EU (European Medicines Agency [ EMA ] or local competent authorities) , all unexpected 
SAEs assessed as related to trial drug by either the investigator or the sponsor will also  qualify 
for expedited reporting. In the US A (FDA) the causality assessed by the sponsor will determine 
whether the case requires expedited reporting.  
The investigator should be aware of local reporting regulations to the IEC/IRB. The Safety CRO will eithe r supply the investigator with the reports which should be passed on to the 
IEC/IRB or report directly to the IEC/IRB depending on local regulations.  
11.5 Follow -up on Adverse Events  
All AEs should be followed until they are resolved or the patient's participat ion in the trial 
ends, whichever comes first. Related non- serious grade 
≥ 3 AEs and AEs meeting one of the 
serious criteria, and still ongoing after ended trial participation should be followed on a regular basis, according to the investigator’s clinical judgment, until the event has been resolved or until the investigator assesses it as chronic or stable and all queries have been resolved.  
11.6 Safety Communication Plan for I nformation to S ite 
In order to secure full transparency regarding patient safety -related questions to sites 
participating in the trial, frequent communication of observations at the different sites will be required. The communication set -up will include the following components:  
• SAEs , non-serious grade 3 AEs and non- serious grade 2 ocular AE s will be reported by  the 
investigational site to the sponsor within 24 hours and medically evaluated immediately 
following receipt. Bi -weekly safety/medical meetings to discuss AE s and laboratory data 
will be held with the participation of at least the Corporate Drug Safety, Genmab Medical 
Officer and CRO Medical Monitor .  
• Recruitment updates will be prepared by the CRO for sites and investigators including 
information on all SAEs, non- serious grade 3 AEs , non- serious grade 2 ocular AEs  and 
DLTs .

Page 98 of 126 
•Monthly t elephone conferences between all participating i nvestigators, CRO Medical
Moni tor and Genmab will be arranged. Pending severity of observed safety signals, ad hoc
meetings will be held.
•A contact list with all participating investigators will be available at all sites .
•24 hours/7 days a week availability of CRO M edical Monitor.
•Direct telephone link from investigator to Genmab Medical Officer and responsible
Genmab Drug Safety Physician .
•DMC meetings following each cohort and ad hoc as needed. The outcome of the DMC
meeting will be communicated to the investigators following each meeting.
•Investigators or their r epresentative(s) will participate in the open part of the DMC
meetings  as applicable.
11.7 Review or Safety Boards 
A DMC  will be established and  will ha ve its first meeting before trial start (first patient 
screened). The DMC  will include medical experts within the disease to be treated, and at least 
one with DMC  experience. At the first meeting, the DMC  will decide the future format and the 
degree of the information it needs in order to evaluate the patients at each dose levels.  
The functions and responsibilities of the DMC  will be described in the DMC  Charter, which 
will be approved by the DMC . The DMC  will receive a package of safety data, including al l 
reported AEs and laboratory data, after each cohort has completed the first cycle of treatment. 
The DMC  will receive a report of any SAEs and DLT immediately after review of the event 
by the sponsor.  
Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of three  patient s per dose level. For each cohort, the DMC  
will evaluate aggregate safety data for the three patients in order to recommend whether it is 
safe to escalate to the next dose level. Before the DMC  review of safety data, at least three  
patients in a cohort mus t receive three infusions (one cycle) and be observed for 28 days before 
the DMC  review.  
The DMC  meetings will be divided into an open and a closed session . During the open sessions, 
representatives from the sponsor as well as one or more investigators involved in the trial will 
participate together with the DMC  members. During the closed session, only DMC  members 
will participate.  
The DMC  will evaluate the data obtained at each dose level and will recommend whether the 
dose should be escalated as per prot ocol, revised to a lower level or interim level, halted 
altogether or more patients are required at the same dose level to evaluate safety. In addition 
cumulative safety data for all cohorts will be evaluated at each DMC  meeting. Available PK 
and/or pharmacodynamic data from the previous dose levels will be compared with known non-clinical PK, pharmacodynamic and safety information. Furthermore, any observed 
responses will be compared with anticipated responses. Any unanticipated responses may require a rev ised dose escalation.

The DMC will look at the total data set and will have all available information from the clinical 
trial GEN70 2 part I to have a complete overview. If late toxicities occur, the DMC can advise 
and the sponsor ’s Safety Committee may approve reduction of the maximal safe dose in the 
3q4wk dose schedule.  
The conclusion of the DMC  meeting will be documented in minutes and forwarded to 
management and relevant project members. The outcome of the DMC  meeting will be 
communicated to the invest igators. Minutes of the DMC  meetings will be shared with the 
regulatory authorities , if requested . 
Further details of the constitution and procedures  of the DMC  meetings will be included in the 
DMC  Charter.  
For the Cohort Expansion part of the trial, the D MC will not hold preplanned meetings but will 
convene in the event of any new safety signals.

12 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
The statistical analysis of this trial will be performed by . 
12.1 Statistical Analysis Plan  
A Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written  and finalized prior to any lock of the trial  
database. The SAP will provide a detailed description of the statistical methods and expand on 
the details provided in the protocol. Additional analyses may be added. Tables, listing s and 
figures shells will also be provided. The SAP will be updated to describe how analysis will be 
performed for patients treated after Protocol Amendment 4.0. 
12.2 Analysis Populations 
The full analysis population will comprise all patients who have been exposed to the trial drug. 
This population will be used for evaluation of all endpoints. 
12.3 Statistical Methods  
The presentations will be done separately for the Dose Escalation part  and the Cohort 
Expansion part. 
In the reporting of the Dose Escalation part  tables will report by cohort , while in the Cohort 
Expansion part tables will report by indication.  
The shift from the 3q4wk dosing to the once q3wk dosing in the Cohort Expansion part may 
lead to a need for reporting some tables by dosing schedule. This will be described as appropriate in the SAP. 
No formal statistical tests will be performed.  
For efficacy analyses , the quartile estimates of PFS and DoR from the Kaplan- Meier product 
limit algorithm will be presented ( Kaplan and Meier, 1958
). The 2- sided  95% confidence 
interval will be presented as well. The number of events may be small, and thereby limit use 
of the Kaplan -Meier method to provide reliable information. In this case, descriptive statistics 
(e.g., n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum) for PFS or DoR will be 
presented. Objective response (CR or PR) rate will be determined along with the corresponding 2-sided 95% exact binomial  confidence interval. 
All data will be listed.  Baseline is defined as the latest available measurement made before the 
first treatment with tisotumab vedotin (HuMax- TF-ADC) . 
A patient will be considered as having completed the trial when all planned trial visits have 
been performed. 
12.3.1 Summary Statistics  
All summary statistics of continuous variables will include: n, mean, median, standard 
deviation, minimum and maximum. All summaries presenting frequencies and incidences will 
include n, % and N, where N is the total number of patients with recorded values in the corresponding group. All confide nce interva ls will be 2-sided 95% confidence intervals.

Individual patient profiles including information on actual dose will also be presented. For the 
Dose Escalation part  summary statistics will be presented as follows:  
• For treatment Cy cle 1: by dose cohort and total  
• For all treatment c ycles: by dose cohort and total  
• By indication (all dose cohorts accumulated)  
For the Cohort Expansion part , summary statistics will be presented as follows: 
• For treatment Cycle 1: by indication and total  
• For all treatment cycles: by indication and total  
12.4 Statistical Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
Incidences of AEs, SAEs, infusion- related AEs, grade ≥ 3 AEs, and AEs related to trial drug 
will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term and listed.  
Also, the number of patient days (total number of days in trial) will be shown for each dose 
group.  
12.5 Statistical Analysis of Secondary Endpoints  
12.5.1 Clinical S afety D ata 
Bleeding (major and minor), skin disorders and neuropathy will be summarized and listed 
separately. Abnormal findings in physical examination, body weight, ECG measurements and 
vital signs will be listed. Ophthalmological evaluation  will be listed.  
12.5.2 Laboratory Safety Data  
Laboratory assessments (Section 10.16) will be plotted and/ or listed for individual patients as 
appropriate. Laboratory values outside normal range will be listed. Percentage change in laboratory safety parameters from baseline to subsequent visits will be derived and provided  
in listings. Before and during infusi on some laboratory assessments are analyzed locally for 
monitoring of patient safety.  
12.5.3 Response  
Response will be assessed in accordance with the RECIST criteria version 1.1 (
Eisenhauer et 
al, 2009 ), where appropriate. However,  specific guidelines may be used  (i.e., Rustin et al., 
2004  for ovarian cancer and Scher et al., 2008  for prostate cancer ).

12.5.3.1 Definition of Response  
Table 10: Definition of Response (RECIST Criteria v1.1)  
 Category  Criteria  
Based on 
target 
lesions  Complete 
Response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes   
must have reduction in short axis to <  10 mm.  
Partial 
Response (PR)  ≥ 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum of LDs. 
Stable Disease 
(SD)  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient 
increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of 
LDs while in trial. 
Progressive 
Disease ( PD) ≥ 20% ( a n d  ≥  5  m m )  increase in the sum of the LD s of target 
lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of the target LDs 
recorded while in trial  or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions . 
Based on 
non-target  
lesions  CR Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level. All lymph nodes must be non- pathological in size 
(< 10 mm  short axis) . 
SD Persistence of 1 or more non -target lesion(s) or/and maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits . 
PD Appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non -target lesions . 
LD=Longest Diameter  
 
Response will be evaluated after  four  cycles ( 16 weeks) and as best overall  response . The best 
overall r esponse is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease 
progression ( Table 11 ). 
Table 11: Evaluation of Response

CR=Complete Response; PD=Progressive Disease; PR=Partial Response; SD=Stable Disease  
 For patients with CRPC, w hen the bone s can is the sole indicator of progression, PD is defined  
in bone when at least  ≥ 2 new lesions are seen on the bone scan compared with a prior scan for 
trial entry. There are no validated criteria for response on  radionuclide bone scan. For 
  Protocol No.GEN702

Page 103 of 126 
control/ relief /eliminate endpoints, it is recommended  that post -treatment changes are recorded 
as either “no  new lesions” or “new lesions.” However, PD  at the first scheduled assessment 
should be confirmed on a second scan performed  six or more weeks later,  in the absence  of 
clearly worsening soft -tissue (nodal  and visceral) disease or disease- related symptoms. In case 
where visible lesions disappear, this should be confirmed at the next scheduled assessment  too. 
For patients with ovarian and endometrial cancer, a response according to CA 125 has occurred 
if there is at least a 50% reduction in CA 125 levels from a pretreatment sample. The response 
must be confirmed and maintained for at least 28 days. Patients can be evaluated according to CA 125 only if they have a pretre atment sample that is at least two  × ULN  and within two  
weeks prior to starting treatment.  
Evaluation of best overall response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (tak ing as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started).  
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of PD at that time should be classified as havi ng “symptomatic 
deterioration”. Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
Confirmation  
SD: follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once and for a minimum 
time period of six  weeks  (± 7 days ) after first treatment.   
PR and CR: no formal confirmation response is required. However, a repeat CT -scan will be 
performed no less than four  weeks (± 7 days) after the criteria for response is met to 
substantiate/confirm CT response ( Section  10.7).  
12.5.3.2 Response Evaluation and Reporting of Results  
Response evaluation will be performed by external medical experts in relevant cancer types in collaboration with the sponsor Medical Officer  and a S tatistician.  
Each patient will be assigned one  of the following categories:  
1) CR  
2) PR  
3) SD  
4) PD  or 
5) Not Evaluable  
Patients in response categories 1 and 2 are considered responders and patients in response categories 4  and 5 are considered as failing to respond to tr eatment (disease progression). 
Patients in response categories 1, 2 and 3 are considered to be in disease control.

Individual patient data listings and summaries of objective response, best overall tumor 
response  and disease control will be  presented  by dose cohort and total . For respective patients , 
PSA (CRPC) and CA125 (ovarian and endometrial) will be listed. 
The maximal response (maximal change in the sum of the LD in the target lesions) in target 
lesions at any time on trial  will be rep orted using waterfall plots.  
12.5.3.3 Progression- free Survival  
Progression- free survival is defined as the number of days from Day 1 in Cycle 1 to first PD 
or death.  Progression -free survival  will be derived for all patients and presented graphically as 
well as su mmarized using survival analysis methods.  
12.5.3.4 Duration of Response  
Duration of response  is defined as the number of days from the first documentation of objective 
tumor response (CR or PR) to the date of first PD or death.  
12.5.3.5 Patients without Disease Progressio n after Four  Cycles  
Percent of patients without PD  after four cycles will be summarized.  
12.5.4 Changes in Biomarkers, I ncluding PSA and CA 125  
Biomarkers, PSA, CA 125, soluble TF, etc. will be presented graphically: individual patient 
plots over time.  
12.5.5 Host Immu ne Response  
Titers of tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  will be listed and positive/negative host 
immune response to tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC)  will be summarized 
(positive/negative). The association between positive/non- positive ADA and PK (pre -dose 
values and  Cmax), major safety signals (CTCAE grade ≥  3) and efficacy information (change 
in tumor size by CT -scan) will be explored.   
12.5.6 Statistical Analysis of Pharmacokinetics Data  
Individual curves of plasma/serum concentration of tisotumab vedotin (HuMax -TF-ADC) , 
HuMax-TF and free toxin (MMAE), including information on actual dose, will be presented 
for all patients. All available data will be shown in these figures.  
The following PK parameters will be calculated based on non- compartmental methods: 
clearance, volume of distribution and AUC (AUC 0-7days  and AUC 0-∞), C max, T max, pre -dose 
values, and half -life. The PK parameters will be calculated separately for Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 .  
The relation between derived PK parameters and covariates such as actual dose, weight and dose, and  selected laboratory parameters w ill be evaluated graphically.  
If deemed applicable compartmental modeling approaches to parameter estimation will be 
applied.  
Further exploratory analyses of PK data may be performed.

12.6 Handling of Missing Data or Outliers  
No imputation of missing data is p lanned for safety endpoints and PK endpoints. If outliers are 
detected, a robustness analysis where the outlier effect is reduced or eliminated may be 
considered.  
12.7 Subgroups and Center Effects  
Subgroup analyses for the following factors are planned:  
• Indicat ion type  
• TF expression  
• ADA positivity (only for g rade ≥ 3 AEs and tumor shrinkage endpoints)  
Other sub- group analyses may be performed post -hoc. Due to the low number of patients per 
center no investigation of center effects are planned.  
12.8 Interim Analyses  
An analysis of the Dose Escalation part  will be performed when this part of the trial is 
completed. An additional interim analysis may be performed when 20 patients have completed 
four cycles (or have been withdrawn earlier). A final analysis will be perf ormed when the entire 
trial is completed.  
12.9 Sample Size Estimation  
A maximum of  24 patients are planned to be enrolled in the  Dose Escalation part of the  trial. 
As the primary objective of the trial is to establish the tolerability of tisotumab vedotin 
(HuMa x-TF-ADC) , the s ample size is based only on the 3 (+3) dose escalation MTD design 
and the expected max imum of three  dose levels  (plus a potential intermediate dose cohort) . 
The classical 3  (+3) dose escalation MTD design aims to determine MTD with the fewest 
possible patients exposed. Taking into account an anticipated screen failure rate of 30%, 18 to 
35 patients will be  screened.   
In the Cohort Expansion part, up to 20- 30 patients in two or three indication arms are expected 
to provide more  information on the safety of the compound at the RP2D level as well as 
preliminary efficacy data for the more frequent dosing regimen.  
12.10 Clinical Trial Reporting  
A final report will be produced when the trial is completed.

13 MONITORING PROCEDURE S/QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The s pons or has ethical, legal and scientific obligations to conduct this trial in accordance with 
established research principles and ICH GCP guidelines. As such, in order to fulfill these 
obligations and to monitor trial progress, the sponsor's monitors or repres entatives will visit 
the investigative sites during the trial  conduct, in addition to maintaining telephone and written 
communication. On- site visits, telephone calls and regular review of the e CRFs will be 
conducted in order to assess patient  enrol lment, compliance with protocol procedures, 
completeness and accuracy of data entered on the e CRFs, verification of e CRF data against 
original source documents and occurrence of AEs. The investigator must provide the monitor , 
sponsor representative and auditors/ inspectors with full access to all source and trial  
documents. 
13.1 Data Collection 
As part of the responsibilities assumed by participating in the trial, the investigator agrees to 
maintain adequate and accurate case histories for the patient s treated under this protocol. Case 
histor ies include e CRFs and supporting data including, but not limited to, signed and dated 
ICFs, progress notes, hospital charts, nurse’s notes, diary cards or other worksheets provided 
to patient s, laboratory reports, ECG readings, etc. 
Patient  demographics and key/essential disease baseline characteristics thought to affect 
outcome, i.e., stratification variables and other prognostic factors, may be collected, as available, for all patient s who provide written informed consent. For patie nts who provided 
informed consent and were not entered into the trial, the reason the patient  was not entered, 
i.e., did not meet one or more inclusion criteria, met one or more exclusion criteria, or other
(e.g., lost to follow-up, consent withdrawn), may also be collected.
13.2 Data Management 
Data management in this trial will be performed by 
The trial will be performed using electronic data capture. The investigator is responsible for 
prompt reporting of accurate, complete and legible data in the eCRFs and in all required 
reports. Any change or correction to the e CRF after saving must be accompanied by a reason 
for the change. The investigator must review and approve  all data entered in the eCRFs , by 
means of an electronic signature. Any corrections made after this approval will be reapproved by the investigator. The investigator should maintain a list of personnel authorized to enter data into the eCRF. Detailed instructions will be provided in the eCRF Completion Guidelines. 
Previous and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization 
Drug Reference Dictionary (WHO Drug ). Medical history and AEs will be coded using 
MedDRA . 
When the database has been declared to be complete and accurate, the database will be locked. Any chang es to the database after that time can only be made by written agreement between 
Genmab and the  project team.  
A Clinical Informatics Plan and a Data Quality Plan will be prepared by .  The process of 
data collection, validation  and transmission is illustrated in  Figure 5 .

13.4 Inspections and Auditing Procedures  
Before,  during and after the trial, the sponsor or its representative may conduct audits at the 
investigative sites including, but not limited to, drug supply, presence of required documents, 
the informed consent process, and comparison of eCRFs with source docum ents. All medical 
records (progress notes) must be available for audit. The investigator  agrees to participate in  
audits conducted at a convenient time in a reasonable manner.  
Government regulatory authorities may also inspect the investigator . The i nvestigator or 
designee should contact the s ponsor/  immediately if this occurs. He/she must cooperate 
fully with regulatory authorities or other audits conducted at a convenient time in a reasonable manner.  The investigator will forward to the sponsor a copy of any inspection records received.

14 TRIAL  MANAGEMENT AND MATERIALS  
14.1 Data Collection  
All data entered in the eCRF should be documented at the site. During each trial visit, a 
physician participating  in the trial will maintain progress notes in the patient ’s medical records 
to document all significant observations. At a minimum, these notes will contain: 
• That the patient has consented and is  found eligible for the trial (as applicable) . 
• The date of the visit and the corresponding day or visit in the trial schedule (e.g., screening, 
Day 1, Day 22, etc.) . 
• General condition and status remarks by the patient , including any significant medical 
findings. The severity, frequency, duration and resolution of any reported AE, and the 
investigator 's assessment as to whet her or not the reported AE is trial drug -related.  
• Changes in concomitant medications or dosages.  
• A general reference to the procedures completed.  
• The signature or initials of all physicians making an entry in the medical record (progress 
notes). 
In addition, any contact with the patient  via telephone or other means that provides significant 
clinical information will also be documented in the medical record (progress notes), as 
described above.  
Information from the medical records (progress notes) and other  source documents will be 
promptly transcribed to the appropriate section of the e CRF . 
Changes to information in the medical record (progress notes), and other source documents 
will be initialed  and dated on the day the change  is made by the i nvestigator o r designee. If the 
reason for the change is not apparent, a brief explanation for the change will be written adjacent to the change.  
Details on data validation, data transfers, origin and destination on the data, access to the 
transferred data, timing of t he transfer and any actions that may be triggered by real -time 
review of those data will be documented in the Clinical Informatics Plan . 
14.2 Source Documents Maintenance 
Source documents contain the results of original observations and activities of a clinical  
investigation. Source documents include, but are not limited to, medical records (progress 
notes), clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data 
from automated instruments, photographic negatives, microfilm or ma gnetic media, x -rays, 
computer printouts, patient files and records kept at the pharmacy, laboratories and medico-
technical departments involved in the clinical trial. There should only be one  source defined at 
any time for any data element.  
All source doc uments from this trial will be maintained by the investigator  and made available 
for inspection by authorized persons. The original signed informed consent  for each patient  
shall be filed with records kept by the investigator  and a copy shall be given to t he patient . 
  Protocol No.GEN702  
Tisotumab vedotin (HuMax®-TF-ADC) Final 5.0 (incorporating Protocol Amendment 4)  
in mixed solid tumors    06 Jul 2017  
 
Page 110 of 126 
14.3 Record Maintenance  
All data derived from the trial will remain the property of Genmab  A/S.  
Records must be retained in accordance with the current ICH Guidelines on GCP. All essential 
trial documents including records of patient s, source docume nts, e CRF s and trial drug 
inventory must be kept on file. 
USA FDA regulations (21 CFR 312.62[c]) require that records and documents pertaining to 
the conduct of this trial and the distribution of investigational drug, including e CRF s, consent 
forms, laboratory test results and medical inventory records, must be retained by the Principal 
Investigator for two  years after marketing application approval. If no application is filed, these 
records must be kept two  years after the investigation is discontinued and the US A FDA and 
the applicable national and local health authorities are notified. The s ponsor or their 
representative will notify the Principal Investigator of these events.  
The i nvestigator will not dispose of any records relevant to this trial witho ut written permission 
from the sponsor, and will provide the sponsor the opportunity to collect such records. The investigator shall take responsibility for maintaining adequate and accurate hard copy source 
documents of all observations and data generated during this trial. Such documentation is subject  to inspection by the sponsor, its representatives and regulatory authorities. 
If an i nvestigator moves, withdraws from an investigation or retires  the responsibility for 
maintaining the records may be transfer red to another person who will accept responsibility. 
Notice of transfer must be made to and agreed by the sponsor. 
14.4 Confidentiality  
All information obtained during the conduct of the trial with respect to the patient ’s state of 
health will be regarded as confidential. For disclosure of any such information, an agreement 
will be obtained in writing.  
The investigator  must ensure that each patient ’s anonymity is maintained. On e CRF s and ot her 
documents submitted to the sponsor or the CRO, patient s must not be  identified. Instead, 
patient s will only be known by initials and by the  unique patient  number allocated to them in 
order to ensure confidentia lity on all trial  documentation. Patient s will retain this unique 
number throughout the trial. The investigator w ill keep a separate log of these codes.  
In order to comply with government regulatory guidelines and to ensure patient  safet y, it may 
be necessary for the s ponsor and its representative,  personnel, the local research review 
board, or the US A FDA to rev iew patient s’ medical records as they relate to this trial. Only the 
patient ’s unique number on the e CRF s will identify him/her, but their full names may be made 
known to a drug regulatory authority or other authorized  government or health care officials, 
if necessary, and to personnel designated by the sponsor. 
Documents that are not for submission to the sponsor (e.g., consent forms) will be maintained 
by the investigator in strict confidence, except to the extent necess ary to allow monitoring by 
the s ponsor and designee , and auditing by regulatory authorities. No documents identifying 
patient s will leave the investigative site and patient  identity will remain confidential in all 
publications related to the trial.

15 ADMINISTRATION PROCE DURES  
15.1 Regulatory Approval  
Genmab  A/S or their appointed agents will be responsible for ensuring that appropriate 
regulatory authority approvals are obtained, according to local country requirements. 
No patient  may enter the trial until this approval has been obtained. A copy of  the approval 
(where one is provided, according to local country requirements) will be provided to the 
investigator  and to the IEC(s)/IRB (s). 
15.2 Protocol Amendments  
In accordance with ICH Topic E 6 (R1) Guideline for GCP , the investigator  should not 
implement any deviation from, or changes of the protocol without agreement by the sponsor  
and documented approval from the IEC/IRB  of a protocol amendment, except where necessary 
to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial patients , or when the change(s) involves only 
logistical or administrative aspects of the trial (e.g., change in monitor(s), change of telephone 
number(s)).  
Any change to the protocol must be handled as a protocol amendment. Any potential 
amendment must be approved by the sponsor . A written amen dment must be submitted to the 
appropriate regulatory authorities and to the IEC/IRB assuming this responsibility. The 
investigator  must await IEC/IRB approval of protocol amendments before implementing the 
changes, except where necessary to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to patient s. In these 
cases, the IEC/IRB must be notified within five  days of the change.  
All amendments to the protocol must be approved in writing by both the appropriate regulatory authorities and the IEC/IRB , except for administra tive amendments, which require notification 
but not written approval. Once approved, the protocol amendment will be distributed to all recipients of the original protocol, with instructions to append the amendment to the protocol. 
If, in the judgment of the local IEC/IRB , the investigator  and/or sponsor , the protocol 
amendment alters the trial design, procedures and/or increases the potential risk to the patient , 
the currently approved written ICF will require modification. The modified ICF must also be 
reviewed and approved by the sponsor , appropriate regulatory authorities, and the IEC/IRB . In 
such cases, repeat informed consent must be obtained from patient s enrolled in the trial before 
participation continues.  
15.3 Protocol Adherence and Deviations  
The protoc ol must be read thoroughly and the instructions must be followed. However, 
exceptions will be made in emergency situations when the protection, safety and well -being of 
the patient  requires immediate intervention based on the judgment of the investigator  or a 
responsible, appropriately trained and credentialed professional(s) designated by the 
investigator  as a sub -investigator.  
In the event of a significant protocol deviation due to an emergency, accident or error, the 
investigator  or designee must contac t the Medical Monitor at the earliest possible time by 
telephone. This allows for an early joint decision to be made as to whether or not the patient  
P rotocol No.GEN702  
Tisotumab vedotin (HuMax®-TF-ADC) Final 5.0 (incorporating Protocol Amendment 4)  
in mixed solid tumors    06 Jul 2017  
Page 112 of 126 
should continue in the trial . The investigator , the sponsor and the Medical Monitor will 
document this decision. 
15.4 Publication Policy  
The sponsor acknowledges the investigator’s right to publish the entire results of the trial, 
regardless of the outcome, in accordance with the Uniform Requirements for Manuscripts Submitted to Biomedical Journals of the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors  
(http://www.icmje.org/icmje -recommendations.pdf , updated December 2014). 
The international Coordinating I nvestigator will, together with the sponsor, decide on the 
publication strategy and has the right to publish and present the results and methods as first author of multicenter publications. Co- authorship will be decided by the sponsor and the 
international Coordinating I nvestigator and will be limited  to a number of persons who have 
contributed substantially in the  design, analysis and conduct of the trial  or the writing and 
presentation of results. The sponsor will have representation in the list of authors. 
Publications are subject to the following conditions: 
•No publication before the completion of the trial at all participating sites without written
agreement with the sponsor.
•All proposed publications and presentations, including any modifications or amendments,
shall be submitted to the sponsor for its review at least 30 days before such  presentation or
publication is submitted to any third party.
•Publications shall not disclose any sponsor confidential information and property (not
including the trial results, which can be published as described e lsewhere in this section).
15.5 Contractual and Financial Details 
The investigator (and/or, as appropriate, the hospital administrative representative) and the 
sponsor will sign a clinical trial agreement prior to the start of the trial, outlining overall 
sponsor and investigator  responsibilities in relation to the trial. The contract should describe 
whether costs for pharmacy, laboratory and other protocol -required services are being paid 
directly or indirectly. Financial Disclosure Statements will need to be c ompleted, as requested 
by FDA CFR 21 part 54. 
15.6 Insurance, Indemnity and Compensation 
Genmab A/S undertakes to maintain an appropriate clinical trial insurance policy . 
Deviations from the trial protocol - especially the prescription of a dose other than that  
scheduled in the trial  protocol, other modes of administration, other indications and longer 
treatment periods - are not permitted and shall not be covered by the statutory patient  insurance 
scheme.  
15.7 Termination of the Trial  
This trial may be terminated by  the sponsor . The trial may also be terminated prematurely at 
any time when agreed to by both the investigator s and the sponsor as being in the best interests

17.2 Appendix 2 : Highly Eff ective Methods of Contraception  
For countries where 2 highly effective methods  of contraception are required, the following 
definitions are provided (ICH M3).  
Highly effective method of contraception / birth control as defined in ICH (M3)  
Methods of birth control which result in a low failure rate (i.e. , less than 1% per year) when 
used consistently and correctly such as implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, 
some intrauterine devices (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomized  partner.  
Barrier Contraceptive  
A contraceptive device that physically prevents sperm from entering the endometrial cavity and fallopian tubes (e.g., male condom, female condom or diaphragm).  
Acceptable forms of effective contraception include:  
(1) Established use of oral, inje cted or implanted hormonal methods of contraception. (Safe  
hormonal contraceptives include contraceptive pills, implants, transdermal patches, hormonal vaginal devices or injections with prolonged release.) [The decision to allow use of hormonal contracept ives should be based on the Investigational Medicinal 
Product’s metabolism and potential for interactions, pharmacology and the adverse event profile (e.g. vomiting)].  
(2) Placement of an intrauterine device or intrauterine system. [Consideration should be given to the type of device or system being used, as there are higher failure rates quoted 
for certain types, e.g. steel or copper wire]  
(3) Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or 
cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. [The use of 
barrier contraceptives should always be supplemented with the use of a spermicide. The following should be noted:  
• Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom are not highly 
effective forms of cont raception. Therefore the use of additional spermicides does 
confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection. 
• However, spermicides alone are inefficient at preventing pregnancy when the whole ejaculate is spilled. Therefore, spermicides are not a bar rier method of contraception 
and should not be used alone .] 
(4) Male sterilization  (with the appropriate post -vasectomy documentation of the absence of 
sperm in the ejaculate). [For female subjects on the study, the vasectomized  male partner 
should be the sole  partner for that subject].  
(5) True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
[Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post -ovulation methods) 
and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception].  
Two forms of highly effective contraception

For certain studies, e.g. in the event of teratogenicity or lack of adequate reproductive toxicity 
data, there is a requirement for 2 forms of highly effective contraception. In this situation, 
subjects should be instructed to use 2 different forms of effective contraception (e.g. from the 
list above).

17.3 Appendix 3 : Declaration of Helsinki  
 
WORLD MEDICAL ASSOCIATION DECLARATION OF HELSINKI  
Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects  
Adopted by the 18th WMA General Assembly, Helsinki, Finland, June 1964, and amended by the:  
29th WMA General Assembly, Tokyo, Japan, October 1975  
35th WMA General Assembly, Venice, Italy, October 1983  
41st WMA General Assembly, Hong Kong, September 1989  
48th WMA General Assembly, Somerset West, Republic of South Africa, October 1996  
52nd WMA General Assembly, Edinburgh, Scotland, October 2000  
53th WMA General Assembly, Washington  DC, USA, October  2002 (Note of Clarification added)  
55th WMA General Assemb ly, Tokyo , Japan, October  2004 (Note of Clarification added)  
59th WMA General Assembly, Seoul, Republic of Korea,  October 2008  
64th WMA General Assembly, Fortaleza, Brazil, October 2013  
 
Preamble  
1. The World Medical Association (WMA) has developed the Dec laration of Helsinki as a 
statement of ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects, including 
research on identifiable human material and data.  
The Declaration is intended to be read as a whole and each of its constituent paragraphs should be applied with consideration of all other relevant paragraphs.  
2. Consistent with the mandate of the WMA, the Declaration is addressed primarily to physicians. The WMA encourages others who are involved in medical research involving human subjects to adopt these principles.  
General Principles  
3. The Declaration of Geneva of the WMA binds the physician with the words, “The health of my patient will be my first consideration,” and the International Code of Medical Ethics declares that, “A physician shall act in the patient's best interest when providing medical care.”  
4. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health, well -being and rights of 
patients, including those who are involved in medical research. The physician's knowledge a nd 
conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.  
5. Medical progress is based on research that ultimately must include studies involving human subjects.  
6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to understand the causes, development and effects of diseases and improve preventive, diagnostic and 
therapeutic interventions (methods, procedures and treatments). Even the best proven interventions must be evaluated continually through research for their safety, effectivenes s, 
efficiency, accessibility and quality.  
  Protocol No.GEN702

in mixed solid tumors    06 Jul 2017  
 
Page 122 of 126 
7. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote and ensure respect for all human 
subjects and protect their health and rights.  
8. While the primary purpose of medical research is to generate new knowledge, this goal can never take precedence over the rights and interests of individual research subjects.  
9. It is the duty of physicians who are involved in medical research to protect the life, health, dignity, integrity, right to self -determination, privacy, and confidentiality of personal 
information of research subjects. The responsibility for the protection of research subjects must always rest with the physician or other health care professionals and never with the research subjects, even though they have given consent. 
10. Physicians must consider the ethical, legal and regulatory norms and standards for research 
involving human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international norms and standards. No national or international ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should reduce or eliminate any of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
11. Medical research should be conducted in a manner that minimises possible harm to the environment. 
12. Medical r esearch involving human subjects must be conducted only by individuals with 
the appropriate ethics and scientific education, training and qualifications. Research on patients 
or healthy volunteers requires the supervision of a competent and appropriately qualified physician or other health care professional.  
13. Groups that are underrepresented in medical research should be provided appropriate access to participation in research.  
14. Physicians who combine medical research with medical care should involve their patients 
in research only to the extent that this is justified by its potential preventive, diagnostic or therapeutic value and if the physician has good reason to believe that participation in the research study will not adversely affect the health of the patients who serve as research subjects.  
15. Appropriate compensation and treatment for subjects who are harmed as a result of participating in research must be ensured.  
Risks, Burdens and Benefits  
16. In medical practice and in medical research, m ost interventions involve risks and burdens. 
Medical research involving human subjects may only be conducted if the importance of the 
objective outweighs the risks and burdens to the research subjects.  
17. All medical research involving human subjects must  be preceded by careful assessment of 
predictable risks and burdens to the individuals and groups involved in the research in comparison with foreseeable benefits to them and to other individuals or groups affected by the condition under investigation.  
Measures to minimise the risks must be implemented. The risks must be continuously monitored, assessed and documented by the researcher.  
  Protocol No.GEN702

in mixed solid tumors    06 Jul 2017  
 
Page 123 of 126 
18. Physicians may not be involved in a research study involving human subjects unless they 
are confident that the risks have been adequately assessed and can be satisfactorily managed.  
When the risks are found to outweigh the potential benefits or when there is conclusive proof of definitive outcomes, physicians must assess whether to continue, modify or immediately stop the study.           
Vulnerable Groups and Individuals  
19. Some groups and individuals are particularly vulnerable and may have an increased likelihood of being wronged or of incurring additional harm.  
All vulnerable groups and individuals should receive spec ifically considered protection. 
20. Medical research with a vulnerable group is only justified if the research is responsive to the health needs or priorities of this group and the research cannot be carried out in a non-vulnerable group. In addition, this  group should stand to benefit from the knowledge, practices 
or interventions that result from the research.  
Scientific Requirements and Research Protocols  
21. Medical research involving human subjects must conform to generally accepted scientific 
principles, be based on a thorough knowledge of the scientific literature, other relevant sources of information, and adequate laboratory and, as appropriate, animal experimentation. The welfare of animals used for research must be respected.  
22. The design and performance of each research study involving human subjects must be clearly described and justified in a research protocol. 
The protocol should contain a statement of the ethical considerations involved and should 
indicate how the principles in this Declara tion have been addressed. The protocol should 
include information regarding funding, sponsors, institutional affiliations, potential conflicts 
of interest, incentives for subjects and information regarding provisions for treating and/or compensating subjec ts who are harmed as a consequence of participation in the research study.  
In clinical trials, the protocol must also describe appropriate arrangements for post -trial 
provisions. 
Research Ethics Committees  
23. The research protocol must be submitted for consideration, comment, guidance and 
approval to the concerned research ethics committee before the study begins. This committee must be transparent in its functioning, must be independent of the researcher, the sponsor and any other undue influence and must  be duly qualified. It must take into consideration the laws 
and regulations of the country or countries in which the research is to be performed as well as applicable international norms and standards but these must not be allowed to reduce or eliminate a ny of the protections for research subjects set forth in this Declaration.  
The committee must have the right to monitor ongoing studies. The researcher must provide monitoring information to the committee, especially information about any serious adverse events. No amendment to the protocol may be made without consideration and approval by the 
P rotocol No.GEN702

committee. After the end of the study, the researchers must submit a final report to the 
committee containing a summary of the study’s findings and conclusions.  
Privacy and Confidentiality 
24. Every precaution must be taken to protect the privacy of research subjects and the
confidentiality of their personal information.
Informed Consent 
25. Participation by individuals capable of giving informed consent as subject s in medical
research must be voluntary. Although it may be appropriate to consult family members or
community leaders, no individual capable of giving informed consent may be enrolled in aresearch study unless he or she freely agrees.
26. In medical research involving human subjects capable of giving informed consent, each
potential subject must be adequately informed of the aims, methods, sources of funding, anypossible conflicts of interest, institutional affiliations of the researcher, the anticipated  benefits
and potential risks of the study and the discomfort it may entail, post -study provisions and any
other relevant aspects of the study. The potential subject must be informed of the right to refuseto participate in the study or to withdraw consent  to participate at any time without reprisal.
Special attention should be given to the specific information needs of individual potentialsubjects as well as to the methods used to deliver the information.
After ensuring that the potential subject has understood the information, the physician or 
another appropriately qualified individual must then seek the potential subject’s freely -given 
informed consent, preferably in writing. If the consent cannot be expressed in writing, the non-written consent must be formally documented and witnessed.     
All medical research subjects should be given the option of being informed about the general 
outcome and results of the study. 
27. When seeking informed consent for participation in a research study the physician must  be
particularly cautious if the potential subject is in a dependent relationship with the physician
or may consent under duress. In such situations the informed consent must be sought by anappropriately qualified individual who is completely independent of this relationship.
28. For a potential research subject who is incapable of giving informed consent, the physician
must seek informed consent from the legally authorised representative. These individuals mustnot be included in a research study that has  no likelihood of benefit for them unless it is
intended to promote the health of the group represented by the potential subject, the researchcannot instead be performed with persons capable of providing informed consent, and theresearch entails only min imal risk and minimal burden.
29. When a potential research subject who is deemed incapable of giving informed consent isable to give assent to decisions about participation in research, the physician must seek thatassent in addition to the consent of the legally authorised representative. The potential subject’sdissent should be respected.
30. Research involving subjects who are physically or mentally incapable of giving consent,
for example, unconscious patients, may be done only if the physical or mental condition that
  Protocol No.GEN702  
Tisotumab vedotin (HuMax®-TF-ADC) Final 5.0 (incorporating Protocol Amendment 4)  
in mixed solid tumors    06 Jul 2017  
 
Page 125 of 126 
prevents giving informed consent is a necessary characteristic of the research  group. In such 
circumstances the physician must seek informed consent from the legally authorised 
representative. If no such representative is available and i f the research cannot be delayed, the 
study may proceed without informed consent provided that the specific reasons for involving subjects with a condition that renders them unable to give informed consent have been stated in the research protocol and the study has been approved by a research ethics committee. Consent to remain in the research must be obtained as soon as possible from the subject or a legally authorised representative.  
31. The physician must fully inform the patient which aspects of their c are are related to the 
research. The refusal of a patient to participate in a study or the patient’s decision to withdraw from the study must never adversely affect the patient -physician relationship. 
32. For medical research using identifiable human mater ial or data, such as research on material 
or data contained in biobanks or similar repositories, physicians must seek informed consent for its collection, storage and/or reuse. There may be exceptional situations where consent would be impossible or imprac ticable to obtain for such research. In such situations the 
research may be done only after consideration and approval of a research ethics committee.  
Use of Placebo  
33. The benefits, risks, burdens and effectiveness of a new intervention must be tested against those of the best proven intervention(s), except in the following circumstances:  
        Where no proven intervention exists, the use of placebo, or no intervention, is acceptable; or 
        Where for compelling and scientifically sound methodologic al reasons the use of any 
intervention less effective than the best proven one, the use of placebo, or no intervention is 
necessary to determine the efficacy or safety of an intervention  
        and the patients who receive any intervention less effective than the best proven one, 
placebo, or no intervention will not be subject to additional risks of serious or irreversible harm 
as a result of not receiving the best proven intervention.  
Extreme care must be taken to avoid abuse of this option. 
Post-Trial Provisions  
34. In advance of a clinical trial, sponsors, researchers and host country governments should 
make provisions for post -trial access for all participants who still need an intervention 
identified as beneficial in the trial. This information must also be disclosed to participants during the informed consent process.  
Research Registration and Publication and Dissemination of Results  
35. Every research study involving human subjects must be registered in a publicly accessible database before recruitm ent of the first subject.  
36. Researchers, authors, sponsors, editors and publishers all have ethical obligations with regard to the publication and dissemination of the results of research. Researchers have a duty to make publicly available the results of  their research on human subjects and are accountable

for the completeness and accuracy of their reports. All parties should adhere to accepted 
guidelines for ethical reporting. Negative and inconclusive as well as positive results must be published or otherwise made publicly available. Sources of funding, institutional affiliations and conflicts of interest must be declared in the publication. Reports of research not in accordance with the principles of this Declaration should not be accepted for publicati on. 
Unproven Interventions in Clinical Practice  
37. In the treatment of an individual patient, where proven interventions do not exist or other known interventions have been ineffective, the physician, after seeking expert advice, with informed consent from the patient or a legally authorised representative, may use an unproven intervention if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re -establishing health 
or alleviating suffering. This intervention should subsequently be made the object of research, designed to evaluate its safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information must be recorded and, where appropriate, made publicly available.

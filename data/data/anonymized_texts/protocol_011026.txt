1.2 Synopsis
AbbVie Inc. Protocol Number:   M12-816
Name of Study Drug:   Elagolix (ABT-620) Phase of Development:   3
Name of Active Ingredient:   Elagolix sodium Date of Protocol Synopsis:   18 December 2017
Protocol Title:   Extension Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Elagolix in Premenopausal 
Women with Heavy Menstrual Bleeding Associated with Uterine Fibroids
Objective:
The objectives of this study are to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of elagolix administered 
alone and in combination with add-back therapy (estradiol/norethindrone acetate or E2/NETA) to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with uterine fibroids for up to 12 months (initial 6 months if on active treatment in the Pivotal Study M12-815 or Study M12-817 and an additional 6 months in this Extension Study).
The study will also evaluate the effects of the treatment regimens on hypoestrogenic side effects, 
changes in bone mineral density (BMD) as assessed by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA), and vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flush.
Investigators:   Multicenter trial.  Investigator information is on file at AbbVie.
Study Sites:   Approximately 250 sites
Study Population:   Subjects who completed the 6-month Treatment Period of their respective Pivotal 
Study, have signed informed consent and meet eligibility criteria will be eligible for participation into this Extension Study.
Number of Subjects to be Enrolled:   Approximately 400
Methodology:
This Extension Study is designed to:
!Obtain 6 months of treatment data in subjects who were randomized to placebo in one of the 
two Pivotal Studies and subsequently randomized to receive 6 months of treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) QD.
!Obtain 12 months of continuous treatment data in subjects who received elagolix 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) QD for6 months in one of the two Pivotal Studies and will continue to receive an additional 6 months of the same treatment in this study.
!Obtain data on endometrial health (TAU, TVU and endometrial biopsy).
!Assess bone mineral density, bone health and general safety with long-term treatment and recovery during Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period (up to 12-Months of 
Treatment and 12-Months of Post-Treatment Follow-Up).

Methodology (Continued):
Following completion of the 6-Month Treatment Period, all subjects will then enter into a 12-Month 
(48 weeks) Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  A pproximately 400 subjects will be enrolled in this 
Extension Study.  Among them, those subjects who received elagolix 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA QD in the Pivotal Studies will continue to receive the same treatment while subjects who received placebo in the Pivotal Studies will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following two treatment groups:
!elagolix 300 mg BID 
!elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) QD
Study Duration:
The total duration for this Extension Study is approximately 18 months.
The study consists of 2 periods:
1.) 6-Month Treatment Period; and2.) 12-Month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.
Treatment Period:
!After providing informed consent and meeting eligibility criteria, subjects will enter a 6-Month 
(24 weeks) Treatment Period.
!Subjects who received placebo during the Pivotal Studies will be randomized in an equal ratio to receive either elagolix 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA QD during the Treatment Period.
!Subjects who received elagolix 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA QD during their respective Pivotal Studies will remain on the same treatment during the Treatment Period of this Extension Study.
During the Treatment Period, subjects will be required to return to the study site monthly.  Study visits will occur at Day 1, and then monthly (28-day intervals) at Month 1 through Month 6.  Additional study visits may occur either for subjects returning their sanitary products at a Product Collection Visit or for a Premature Discontinuation Visit.
At each monthly visit during the Treatment Period, except Treatment Month 6, a 1-Month supply of 
study drug will be dispensed, urine and/or serum pregnancy testing will be performed, and contraception counseling will occur.  All subjects will self-administer study drug, elagolix 300 mg twice daily (once in the morning and once in the evening approximately 12 hours apart) and E2/NETA or matching Placebo 
once daily (in the morning) orally throughout the 6-Month Treatment Period.

Treatment Period (Continued):
Treatment Period Assessments:
Sanitary product collection kits will continue to be dispensed at all Treatment Period Visits in this 
Extension Study.  Subjects will be required to collect all sanitary products on days with menstrual bleeding or spotting and return them to the Clinical Study Site, either during a scheduled Monthly Visit or at a Product Collection Visit. Subjects must be instructed to collect and return all used or worn 
products even if there is no visible blood on the products.   If a subject does not return a sanitary 
product collection keg at any site visit (scheduled Monthly Visit, Product Collection Visit, Unscheduled Visit, or Premature Discontinuation Visit), the Site Staff will administer the Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire (UBQ) to record if subject had any bleeding or spotting since the last Study Visit.  If the subject had bleeding or spotting since the last Study Visit, the Site Staff will record the subjects response indicating why she did not collect products or return a sanitary product collection keg.
A pelvic ultrasound will be performed in all subjects at Month 3, Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation 
Visit, if applicable, to assess volume of the largest fibroid, uterine volume, endometrial thickness and potential presence of ovarian and uterine pathology.  During the Treatment Period, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRIs) in a subset of subjects will be conducted at Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation Visit, if applicable, to assess fibroid and uterine volume.  An endometrial biopsy will be performed in all subjects at the Month 6 or at the Premature Discontinuation Visit (if the subject prematurely discontinues after the Month 3 Visit).
Subjects who enter the Extension Study with BMD decrease < 5% in both spine and total hip will require 
a DXA scan at Month 6.  Subjects who enter the Extension Study with BMD decrease ≥ 5% in spine or 
total hip require a DXA scan at Month 3 of this Extension Study.  If the Month 3 DXA scan shows BMD decrease < 8% in spine, total hip, and femoral neck, the subject can continue in the Extension Study with a DXA scan to be performed at Month 6.  If, however, the Month 3 DXA scan shows BMD decrease ≥8% in spine, total hip, or femoral neck, the subject must discontinue treatment and enter the Post-
Treatment Follow-Up Period.
Sites will continue to collect concomitant medications and assess for adverse events at every visit.
Subjects will be asked to complete several patient-re ported outcome questionnaires, such as the EQ-5D-
5L, Uterine Fibroid Symptom Questionnaire (UFS-QoL), Work Productivity and Activity Impairment 
(WPAI) questionnaire, Health Care Resource Utilization questionnaire (HCRU), C-SSRS – Since Last Visit questionnaire and Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC), based on bleeding and non-bleeding uterine fibroid symptoms.  Site Staff will administer the Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire (UBQ), as applicable and the HCRU. 
Pregnancy (urine and/or serum) tests will be performed at each visit throughout the study.  Subjects will 
continue to be required to participate in contraceptive counseling, and at each visit will be reminded of the importance of using appropriate and effective forms of dual non-hormonal contraceptives to promote pregnancy prevention.
During the Treatment Period, blood samples will be collected to assay for serum estradiol and 
progesterone, and to measure plasma concentrations of elagolix and NETA, as well as blood samples for clinical safety labs, (including lipid panel) will be collected during the study.

Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period:
For subjects entering the 12-Month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, visits will be conducted either by 
phone or on-site from Month 1 through Month 12.
During the Phone Visits, Site Personnel will discuss adverse events, concomitant medications, if 
applicable, obtain the results of the subject's self-administered urine pregnancy test and will remind subjects of the importance of consistent use of appropriate and effective dual non-hormonal contraception through the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  Subjects may begin taking hormonal contraception or Tranexamic Acid (Lysteda, Cyklokapron, Cyclo-f) after completing the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and return to first full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.
Subjects will be required to collect sanitary products through their first menses with full menstrual flow 
in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  Subjects will return the sanitary products at a Product Collection Visit within approximately 5 days after cessation of bleeding or spotting.
During the On-Site Visits, procedures such as TAU, TVU, MRI (if applicable), DXA, clinical safety labs 
and pregnancy testing will be performed.  At the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period Month 12 Visit, procedures including vital signs, lipid panel, Apolipoprotein A and B and DXA will be performed.
Adverse event and concomitant medication review will be conducted at all visits during the Post-
Treatment Follow-Up Period, including the Phone Visits.
Central Laboratory and Central Imaging Vendors:
DXA, Ultrasound, MRI (if applicable), safety clinical lab samples including Apo A, and Apo B, 
endocrine panels, and alkaline hematin will be analyzed/evaluated using central laboratories or vendors.  Assays for PK and PD will be analyzed at AbbVie.
Analysis of Menstrual Blood Loss:
This study will utilize the alkaline hematin (AH) method for measuring MBL volume. Alkaline hematin 
is an objective and reliable measurement of total MBL based on the quantitation of menstrual blood collected on sanitary products.
Key Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion:
Key Inclusion Criteria:
1. Subject has voluntarily signed and dated the informed consent form (ICF), approved by an 
Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC), prior to initiation of any study-specific 
procedures.
2. Subject has completed the 6-Month Treatment Period of their respective Pivotal Study (either 
Study M12-815 or Study M12-817).
3. Subject has BMD decrease < 8% in the spine, total hip and femoral neck at Month 6 of the

Key Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion (Continued):
Key Inclusion Criteria (Continued):
5. Subject must agree to use two forms of non-hormonal contraception (dual contraception) 
consistently during the Treatment Period and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods.  (Subject may 
start hormonal contraception after completion of the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and return to first full menses).  Acceptable methods of dual contraception include the following combinations:
! Condom with spermicide (foam, gel or polymer film)
! Diaphragm with spermicide (condom may or may not be used)
! Cervical cap with spermicide (condom may or may not be used)
Subject is not required to use dual contraception methods if:
! Sexual partner(s) is vasectomized, at least 6 months prior to Screening.
! Subject practices total abstinence from sexual intercourse, as the preferred lifestyle of the 
subject; periodic abstinence is not acceptable.
! Subject had a bilateral tubal occlusion (including ligation and blockage methods such as Essure
®), at least 4 months prior to Screening.  
! Subject is not sexually active with men; periodic sexual relationship(s) with men requires the use of dual non hormonal contraception as noted above.
6. Subject's endometrial biopsy from the Month 6 Visit of their respective Pivotal Study shows no 
clinically significant endometrial pathology.
Rationale For Inclusion Criteria:
1 This is standard criterion in accordance with harmonized Good Clinical Practice (GCP)
2, 3 These criteria were selected to ensure an appropriate subject population of premenopausal 
women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids (prognostic and predictive)
4, 5 The impact of elagolix on pregnancies or breastfed infants is unknown and there is a possible 
risk of miscarriage due to changes in hormone levels; therefore, these criteria ensure pregnant 
women are not enrolled into the study and adequate precautions are taken to avoid pregnancy during study participation (prognostic and risk)
6 This is standard criteria to ensure general good health and the safety of the subjects (risk)
Key Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion:
Key Exclusion Criteria:
1. Subject met criteria for removal from therapy in her respective Pivotal Study.2. Subject is planning a pregnancy within the next 18 months.
3. Subject has current suicidal ideation as evidenced by answering 'yes' to questions 4 or 5 on the 
suicidal ideation portion of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) completed at 
Treatment Period Month 6 Visit of her respective Pivotal Study.

Key Criteria for Inclusion/Exclusion (Continued):
Key Exclusion Criteria (Continued):
4. Subject has a newly diagnosed clinically significant medical condition that requires intervention 
ORan unstable medical condition that makes the subject an unsuitable candidate for the study in 
the opinion of the Investigator (including, but not limited to:  uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, 
uncontrolled hypertension, epilepsy requiring anti-epileptic medication, unstable angina, confirmed inflammatory bowel disease, hyperprolactinemia, clinically significant infection or injury or symptomatic endometriosis [confirmed by laparoscopy/laparotomy]).
5. Subject is using any systemic corticosteroids for over 14 days or is likely to require treatment with 
systemic corticosteroids during the course of the study.  Over-the-counter and prescription topical, inhaled, intranasal or injectable (for occasional use) corticosteroids are allowed.
6. Subject, who in the judgment of the Investigator, will be unable or unwilling to comply with study-
related assessments and procedures, including collection of sanitary products.
Rationale for Exclusion Criteria:
1, 3, 4, 5 This is standard criteria to ensure general good health and the safety of the subjects (risk)
2 The impact of elagolix on pregnancies or breastfed infants is unknown and there is a 
possible risk of miscarriage due to changes in hormone levels; therefore, these criteria 
ensure adequate precautions are taken to avoid pregnancy or breastfeeding while receiving elagolix (risk)
6 This criterion was added to ensure the population of subjects enrolled will comply with
study-related procedures and subject collection requirements throughout the entire study (predictive)

Statistical Methods (Continued):
Safety (Continued):
The within-group percent change from baseline to Month 6 in the Extension Study in BMD will be 
summarized by treatment group.
For subjects who have at least 12 months of total exposure to elagolix, the percent change from Baseline 
to Month 6 in the Extension Study in BMD will be compared between elagolix dose groups (elagolix 300 mg BID versus elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA QD) using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment as the main effect and baseline BMD as a covariate.  A two-sided 95% confidence interval will be constructed for the between-group difference in percent change from baseline to Month 6 in the Extension Study in BMD.
Sample Size:
All subjects who complete either the Pivotal Study M12-815 or Study M12-817, sign an inform consent 
form, and meet the inclusion/exclusion criterion will be eligible to enroll in this Extension Study.  The two Pivotal Studies M12-815 and M12-817 have a planned enrollment of a total of 800 subjects.  Based on assumptions related to discontinuation in the Pivotal Study and the estimated roll over rate into this Extension Study, approximately 400 subjects are expected to be enrolled in this Extension Study.
Pharmacokinetics/Pharmacodynamics:
Plasma concentrations of elagolix and norethindrone will be listed for each subject by visit day and dose 
regimen.  Pharmacokinetic data may be combined with data from other studies in women. 
Serum concentrations of estradiol, progesterone, FSH, and LH will be listed for each subject by visit day 
and dose regimen.
Exposure-response analyses may be conducted as appropriate.

3.0 Introduction
3.1 Uterine Fibroids
Uterine fibroids (leiomyomata) are the most common benign tumors in women and occur 
in up to 80% of women of reproductive age.1  The incidence increases with age, and 
uterine fibroids are the most common reason for hysterectomy.1,2  Uterine fibroids may 
develop in African-American women on average 10 years earlier than in white women.3  
The overall cost of symptomatic uterine fibroids exceeds $2 billion per year in the United States.
4
The growth of uterine fibroids is highly dependent on both estrogen and progesterone.5
Although often asymptomatic, fibroids may cause symptoms severe enough to warrant therapy in 20% to 50% of women
3and the most common symptom is heavy or prolonged 
menstrual bleeding.  Other symptoms may include anemia, pelvic pressure and pelvic organ compression, back pain, and adverse reproductive outcomes.  Heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) (menorrhagia, defined as > 80 mL per menstrual cycle)
1is extremely 
inconvenient, can significantly impact quality of life and may lead to iron-deficiency anemia.
The choice of treatment is based on individual symptoms, patient preference, and the 
desire to preserve either fertility or the uterus or both.  Histor ically, hysterectomy or 
myomectomy were the preferred treatment opti ons for women with symptomatic uterine 
fibroids.
2  However, surgery is also associated with risks such as infections, bleeding 
complications, thromboembolic effects, scarring/adhesions, and even increased mortality.6  
As more women delay pregnancy into their 30s and 40s, there is a growing need for alternatives to surgical treatments, especially hysterectomy.  To meet this demand, during the past 2 decades many new uterus-sparing therapies have been proposed and studied including semi-invasive procedures, such as uterine artery embo lization and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI)-guided high-intensi ty focused ultrasound ablation therapy as 
well as nonsurgical, medical treatments.  There is no long-term medical treatment for 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1

symptomatic uterine fibroids.  Treatment with GnRH agonists such as Lupron®is 
effective but induces full gonadal suppression and menopause-like symptoms that limit 
their use to 3 months of presurgical treatment.  High-dose progestins, oral contraceptives and tranexamic acid (Lysteda
®-an antifibrinolytic drug) are used for short-term 
management of heavy uterine bleeding only.  Recently, the selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM), ulipristal acetate, has been approved in the EU as a short-term preoperative treatment, as well as an extended intermittent treatment of women with of symptomatic uterine fibroids.
The ideal medical treatment for symptomatic uterine fibroids, as an alternative to surgical 
interventions, should control HMB, improve non-bleeding symptoms and quality of life, 
and prove safe and tolerable as a chronic therapy.  Unfortunately, currently available medical options provide only short-term improvement of symptoms, and as such, are only indicated prior to surgery, and/or their side-effects limit their long-term use.  A safe and effective chronic medical therapy for the management of HMB associated with uterine fibroids, as an alternative to hysterectomy or other surgical intervention, has not yet been approved.
3.2 Elagolix
Elagolix is an orally active, non-peptide (GnRH ) antagonist that is being developed by 
AbbVie for the management of endometriosis-related pain and the chronic management of 
HMB associated with symptomatic uterine fi broids.  The initial preclinical and clinical 
evaluation of elagolix was conducted by Ne urocrine Biosciences Inc. (NBI).  Safety 
results from these studies show that elagolix  is generally well tolerated.  Elagolix, unlike 
injectable GnRH analogs, produces a dose dependent suppression of pituitary and ovarian hormones in women, i.e., from partial ovarian suppression at lower doses to full suppression at higher doses.  A detailed discussion of the preclinical t oxico logy, 
metabolism, pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of elagolix in humans and a summary of clinical studies can be found in the Investigator's Brochure and is also discussed in lesser detail in Section 3.2.1 and Section 3.2.2 .

The initial 3-month, Phase 2a , dose-finding, POC study (Study M12-663) evaluated total 
daily doses (TDDs) of elagolix of 200, 400, and 600 mg in premenopausal women with 
HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Data from this study indicated that an elagolix TDD of 600 mg best met the agreed-upon dos e selection criteria for Phase 2b and Phase 3 
(predicated on a dose in Phase 2a that provided the most robust response [responder rates of approximately > 80% for the composite bleed ing assessment] and an acceptable safety 
and bleeding profile for the majority of women).  It was known that to support long-term dosing with elagolix at these higher doses, low dose hormonal add-back therapy would be required to mitigate bone loss and minimize other hypoestrogenic adverse events, e.g., hot flush.
Subsequently, a 6-month safety and efficacy Phase 2b study (Study M12-813) evaluating 
elagolix TDD of 600 mg (administered as 300 mg BID in Cohort 1 or 600 mg QD in Cohort 2) with and without add-back thera py was conducted.  As add- back therapy, the 
study evaluated two doses of E2/NETA (low dose, 0.5 mg/0.1 mg and standard dose, 1 mg/0.5 mg).  Preliminary results from Cohort 1 demonstrated that treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID alone and in combin ation with E2/NETA provided robust efficacy 
in controlling HMB associated with uterine fibroids and provided an acceptable safety/tolerability profile that could potentially support the proposed chronic use indication.  While similar efficacy results were noted in Cohort 2 (elagolix 600 mg QD),review of the totality of data (preclinical, Phase 1 and Phase 2) comparing two dosing regimens support selection of the 300 mg BID + standard dose E2/NETA as the regimen for Phase 3.
Additional details on rationale for dose selection are included in Section 5.6.4 .
3.2.1 Preclinical Experience
3.2.1.1 Toxicology
Elagolix has been well characterized in repeated-dose animal toxicity studies of up to 
15 weeks in mouse, 28 weeks in rat, 39 weeks (9 months) in dog and 13 weeks in monkey. 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
27
The safety margin for the 200 mg BID human dose for the endometriosis indication is 
approximately 8.6 (28 week rate study) and 7.5 (9 month dog study).
There were no significant findings from in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies.  Also, 
there was no significant increase in tumors in the 2-year mouse carcinogenicity study with 
elagolix sodium.  In the 2-year rat carcinogenicity study increase in thyroid or liver tumors was rat specific with no risk anticipated for human.
Elagolix is not teratogenic (no fetal abnormalities in preclinical studies) based on data 
from the rat and rabbit Segment II studies).  However, there were non-teratogenic findings, e.g., observations of abortions in rabbit and post-implantation loss in rat at higher doses.  These could either be due to maternal toxicity or related to indirect pharmacological activity.  
Please refer to the most recent edition of the elagolix Investigator Brochure for complete 
information on toxicology studies for elagolix.
3.2.2 Clinical Experience
Refer to Edition 15 of the elagolix Investigator's Brochure (April 2016 or the most recent 
version) for the complete information on clinical studies, exposure to study drug, and safety.
Clinical Program Overview
As of 31 January 2016, a total of 3,417 subjects have received at least 1 dose of elagolix 
in clinical studies conducted by NBI and AbbVie (30 Phase 1 studies, 6 Phase 2 endometriosis studies, 2 Phase 2 uterine fibroid studies [Studi es M12-663 and M12-813], 
and 1 ongoing Phase 3 endometriosis extension study [Study M12-665] and 2 ongoing Phase 3 endometriosis extension studies [Studies M12-667 and M12-821]).  More than 
1,000 of these subjects were dosed for ≥ 6 weeks.  Of the 3,417 subjects, 95 were healthy 
men, 795 were healthy women, 1,296 were women with endometriosis, 221 were women with uterine fibroids, 16 were women with hepatic impairment, and 9 were women with

renal impairment.  In ongoing studies (including 2 extension studies mentioned above and 
excluding Study M12-671), more than 1,625 subjects have received at least 1 dose of elagolix.
Twelve Phase 1 clinical studies (7 in healthy men and 5 in healthy women) and 6 Phase 2 
studies (in women with endometriosis) were  completed by NBI.  To date, 18 Phase 1 
studies have been completed by AbbVie.  The Phase 3 endometriosis registration program consists of 2 replicate 6-month Pivotal Studies, Study M12-665 and Study M12-671 and 2 extension studies, Study M12-667 and St udy M12-821, respectively.  In women with 
HMB associated with uterine fibroids, 2 Phase 2 studies have been completed by AbbVie, Study M12-663 and Study M12-813.  The Phase 3 uterine fibroid registration program consists of 2 Pivotal Studies, Study M12-815 and Study M12-817, and a single planned associated 6-month safety/eff icacy extension study, Study M12-816.
Clinical Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Summary
Clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies indicate that elagolix is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract (GI) with time to maximum plasma concentration (T
max) of 
approximately 1 hour for immediate rel ease (IR) tablet formulations.  The following 
points are key findings of elagolix PK:
●Elagolix exposure (area under the plasma concentration versus time curve 
[AUC] and maximum concentration in plasma [C max]) appears to be 
approximately dose-proportional across the daily dose range studied (25 to 
400 mg).  At single daily doses of 600 mg and a bove, more than dose 
proportional increases in elago lix exposures were observed.
●Elagolix displays biphasic disposition with a terminal elimination half-life of approximately 4 – 6 hours.  Little or no accumulation resulted from BID 
(400 mg BID), or once daily (QD) (400 mg QD) dosing at steady state which is not deemed clinically relevant.
●Food decreases the AUC of the immediate-release tablet formulation by approximately 25%.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1

●Elagolix is a substrate of CYP3A and P-gp and may be a weak inducer of 
CYP3A enzymes.
●Elagolix is primarily excreted in feces as metabolites (64%) and parent compound (26%).  Less than 3% is excreted unchanged in the urine.  Plasma 
exposure of elagolix metabolites was low (< 3% of each metabolite) relative to the parent.
Pharmacodynamic data from the AbbVie multiple-ascending dose (MAD) study, 
Study M12-790, in premenopausal healthy female subjects showed a dose-dependent suppression of E2, reaching maximum suppression at approximately 200 mg BID.  Anovulatory progesterone levels were observed through Day 21 in all subjects at doses as low as 100 mg BID.  In addition, luteinizing hormone (LH) and fo llicle-stimulating 
hormone (FSH) decline in a dose dependent manner, with maximal suppression and near 
maximal suppression, respectively, at 300 mg BID.  The elagolix 400 mg BID dose does not appear to result in substantial additi onal E2 suppression compared with the 300 mg 
BID dose.
Effects on Ovulation
Elagolix is not a contraceptive and data on ovulation rates from the 3-month 
folliculogenesis study, Study M12-673, showed that the 100 mg BID, 150 mg QD, and 200 mg QD doses do not appear to differentiate.  The percentage of subjects with at least 1 ovulation during the 3 months of elagolix treatment was 47.4% to 57.1%, and the percentage of subjects with ovulation was 28.1% to 33.3% within each month (28-day period).  In contrast, when ovulation rates are counted by subject or by month, the 200 mg BID dose appears to decrease ovulation rates to almost half of that observed with the 150 mg QD dose.  The 300 mg BID dose appeared to have a slightly lower ovulation rate than 200 mg BID (27% versus 32%), and when the standard-dose estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg (standard-dose E2/NETA) was co-administered with elagolix 300 mg BID, the ovulation rate decreased further to approximately 10%.

Summary of Safety Findings
Adverse Events Across Elagolix Studies
As of 31 January 2016, the most common adverse events overall in the 3,417 subjects 
who received elagolix across all clinical studies were hot flush (598/3,417; 17.5%), headache (546/3,417; 16.0%), and nausea (411/3,417; 12%).  These are also the adverse events that most commonly resulted in discontinuation from study:  hot flush in 33 subjects (1.0%), headache in 15 subjects (0.4%), and nausea in 16 subjects (0.5%).
Adverse Events in Phase 2 Studies in Uterine Fibroids
Study M12-663
Preliminary data from the completed Phase 2a POC study, Study M12-663, show that the 
most commonly reported adverse event in all the elagolix treatment cohorts was hot flush; this was reported for approximately 45% to 63% of the subjects in the cohorts in which elagolix was administered alone.  The use of both add-back therapies [elagolix 200 mg BID + LD (low-dose) E2/NETA QD and elagolix 300 mg BID + cyclical EP] was associated with an approx imate 30% lower overall incidence of hot flush that was 
approximately 30% lower relative to the corresponding elagolix treatment regimen alone.
Other than hot flushes, the only other adverse events in the elagolix 300 mg BID group 
reported for more than 2 subjects were h eadache (6 subjects, 20%), and abdominal pain 
and dizziness (3 subjects each, 10%).  At the 600 mg QD dose of elagolix, the presence of nausea (9 subjects), headache (9 subjects), dizziness (6 subjects), and back pain (5 subjects) was more prevalent than in  the remaining elagolix treatment cohorts.
Study M12-813
Preliminary data from the completed Phase 2b study, Study M12-813, show that, overall, 
the percentage of subjects who reported treatment-emergent adverse events was generally similar across all treatment groups in both cohorts, ranging from 67.9% to 87.0%, with the highest values in the elagolix alone groups (300 mg BID, 80.0%; 600 mg QD, 87.0%).  
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1

The most common adverse events in both cohorts were hot flush, insomnia, and headache.  
The rates for hot flush in Cohort 1 were 3.1% for placebo and 44.6% for elagolix 300 mg BID alone, and the addition of low-dose or standard-dose E2/NETA significantly decreased the rates by approximately 20% and 34%, respectively (25.0% for elagolix 300 mg BID + low-dose E2/NETA and 10.8% for elagolix 300 mg BID + standard-dose E2/NETA).  In Cohort 2, the rates of hot flush were 5.1% for placebo and 49.4% for elagolix 600 mg QD alone.  Addition of low-dose or standard-dose E2/NETA significantly decreased the rates by approximately 31% and 35%, respectively (18.4% for elagolix 600 mg QD + low-dose E2/NETA and 14.3% for elagolix 600 mg QD + standard-dose E2/NETA). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest
Adverse events of special interest in elagolix clinical studies include mood changing 
disorders (suicidality and depression), cutane ous adverse events, hot flush, ovarian-related 
events, BMD decrease and fractures, uterine bleeding and changes in serum lipids.  In the completed Phase 2 studies in uterine fibroids, there was a higher percentage of women experiencing cutaneous/hypersensitivity ev ents and hot flush with elagolix treatment 
compared with placebo.  Adverse events of special interest are monitored continuously in all clinical studies.
Serious Adverse Events
As of 31 January 2016, 129 serious adverse events have been reported by 92/3,417 (2.7%) subjects who received elagolix.  Serious adverse events in all completed studies and in ongoing Studies M12-667 and M12-821 through the data cutoff date of 31 January 2016 are captured in the analysis for this update.  The most common serious adverse event was pelvic pain occurring in 8 subjects (0.2%) followed by induced abortion occurring in 4 subjects (0.2%) and spontaneous abortion and endometriosis, each occurring in 5 subjects (0.1%), and abdominal pain and uterine leiomyoma, each occurring in 4 subjects (0.1%).  Among women participating in elagolix clinical trials, one subject delivered an infant with congenital pneumonia.  During the Phase 2 clinical development

program in endometriosis, there were 2 pre gnancy-related serious adverse events 
(congenital malformations, i.e., 1 cleft palate and 1 tracheoesophageal fistula), which 
occurred during treatment and were assessed as unrelated to elagolix.
In the completed Phase 2a study in women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids, 
there were 2 serious adverse events of prolapsed uterine fibroid.
Based on the preliminary results of Cohort 1 of the Phase 2b study in women with HMB 
associated with uterine fi broids, as of 31 January 2016, there were 7 serious adverse 
events that either occurred during the Treatment Period or within 30 days of last dose in 8 subjects randomized to receive active treatment.  Four events occurred in the elagolix 300 mg BID alone arm [pulmonary embolis m, deep vein thrombosis (both events 
experienced by the same subject), menorrhagia and endometrial adenocarcinoma]; 2 events occurred in the 300 mg BID plus low-dose activella arm (uterine leiomyoma and hypertension), and 1 event occurred in the 300 mg BID plus standard-dose activella arm (anemia).
Effects of Elagolix on Bone Mineral Density (BMD)
The effects of elagolix 300 mg BID alone and in combination with low-dose and standard 
dose E2/NETA were evaluated in the 6-month Phase 2b study (Study M12-813).  BMD was assessed at the lumbar spine (L1-L4), femoral neck, and total hip via DXA at Screening and at Month 6 of the Treatment Period, or Premature Discontinuation.
Preliminary results from the 6-month Phase 2b uterine fibroid study, Study M12-813, 
demonstrate that treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID and 600 mg QD, significantly decrease BMD, which is partially mitigated by  addition of E2/NETA in a dose-dependent 
manner.  In Cohort 1, the mean percentage change from Baseline to Month 6 in BMD in the lumbar spine for the elagolix 300 mg BI D alone group was –3.8% at Month 6; 19% of 
subjects had a 3 to ≤ 5% BMD decrease, 25% had > 5% to < 8% BMD decrease, and 8% 
had a ≥ 8% BMD decrease.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
33
While the addition of low-dose E2/NETA partially prevented BMD loss at the lumbar 
spine at Month 6 of treatment compared to th e elagolix alone group (mean change from 
baseline –1.5% versus –3.6%), the E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) more substantially mitigated BMD loss at the lumbar spine at Month 6 compared with the elagolix alone group (mean change from baseline –0.1% versus –3.6%).  In the E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) group 8.2% of subjects had a 3 to ≤ 5% BMD decrease, 1 subject (2%) had a 5% – 8% BMD decrease and no subjects 
(0%) had ≥ 8% BMD decrease at the lumbar spine.
Effects of Elagolix on Clinical Laboratory Parameters
Data from the Phase 2 studies with elagolix in women with uterine fibroids showed dose-dependent increases in serum lipid parameters, corresponding to the degree of estrogen suppression and similar to those seen with other GnRH analogs.  Changes in serum lipids, in particular total cholesterol and low-de nsity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), were 
observed in this study, similar to those observed in postmenopausal women
8and these 
changes, as expected, were somewhat attenuated by E2/NETA in a dose-dependent manner.  Mean percentage increases from Baseline in total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), LDL-C, and triglycerides were observed across each of 
the elagolix treatment groups over the 6-month treatment duration.  Ongoing clinical trials with elagolix suggest similar findings, again which are consistent with those noted with other GnRH analogs.  While the significance of these lipid changes in premenopausal women with low-risk baseline lipid values is unknown, further monitoring and evaluation is needed.  In all these studies, the increased lipid values usually occur during the first 1 to 2 months of elagolix use, stabilize or plateau, and return to pretreatment baseline levels within 1 to 3 months after elagolix is discontinued.
Uterine Bleeding in Phase 2 Studies in Uterine Fibroids
Studies with elagolix have shown that overall, patients on elagolix experienced fewer days 
of bleeding per month, reduced bleeding intensity, and extended intervals between bleeding episodes compared with patients on placebo.  Some subjects experienced periods 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
34
of oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea with evidence of irregular bleeding as well, in particular 
at lower doses.  The effect of elagolix on bleeding appeared to be dose-dependent.
Study M12-813
Preliminary data from Phase 2b uterine fibroid study demonstrates that subjects reported 
no bleeding during the last 90 days on treatment most frequently in the elagolix 300 mg BID alone group and the elagolix 600 mg QD alone group, and reports of no bleeding declined in a dose-dependent fashio n with the addition of E2/NETA.
Of subjects who received elagolix and we re amenorrheic upon entering the Post-treatment 
Follow-Up Period, the majority of subjects (52% in Cohort 1 and 59% in Cohort 2) returned to menses at Month, and an additional 42% in Cohort 1 and 38% in Cohort 2 returned to menses at Month 2.
Endometrial Safety in Phase 2 Studies in Uterine Fibroids
Study M12-813 
Endometrial biopsies were conducted at Baseline and at Month 6 in Study M12-813.  
Preliminary results from Cohort 1 show that, among subjects in elagolix treatment groups, 39% to 43% had normal quiescent/minimally stimulated endometrium and 14% to 28% had normal proliferative endometrium at Month 6.  No clinically significant findings were observed.
Preliminary results from Cohort 2 are similar.  Among subjects in elagolix treatment 
groups, 21% to 36% had normal quiescent/minimally stimulated endometrium and 20% to 32% had normal proliferative endometrium at Month 6.  No clinically significant findings were observed.

3.2.2.1 Pregnancy in Elagolix Studies
Pregnancies Outcomes (Across the Entire Elagolix Clinical Development Program)
The mechanism of action of elagolix, bleeding pattern, and the indirect evidence for 
follicular escapes (high E2 and progesterone values) indicate that elagolix does not consistently inhibit ovulation and as discussed in Section 3.2.2 , Clinical Pharmacokinetic 
and Pharmacodynamic Summary, elagolix is not contraceptive.
As of 05 February 2016, 172 pregnancies have been reported among women participating 
in elagolix clinical trials, including 104 that occurred off-treatment (58 during Screening and 46 during Post-Treatment [had a conception date more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug]) and 68 On-Treatment (i.e., had conception date during the Treatment Period with study drug or were deemed to have a conception date within 30 days after the last dose of study drug).  Among the 68 on-treatment pregnancies, 21 subjects had no exposure to elagolix (20 subjects treated with placebo only and 1 subject treated with oral contraceptives only).  The remaining 47 on-treatment pregnancies were  in elagolix-treated 
subjects, and 21were carried to term, with 18 subjects delivering live infants without complications (1 pair of twins).  One subject delivered an infant with meconium aspiration pneumonia (MedDRA preferred term = congenital pneumonia).  Two subjects who received 150 mg elagolix QD in Phase 2 e ndometriosis studies delivered infants with 
congenital anomalies:  1 infant with tracheoesophageal fistula with findings of patent ductus arteriosus, tricuspid valve incompeten ce, and pneumothorax and 1 infant with cleft 
soft palate.  Internal and external causali ty assessment of these malformations supported 
that both congenital malformation cases were unlikely to be related to elagolix.  In Phase 3 studies in endometriosis, 14 pregnancies have been reported in Study M12-665 and 6 have been reported in Study M12-671.  In the aforementioned Phase 2b UF study, 1 on-treatment pregnancy has been reported.

trials.  Women are also counseled on the unknown, thus potential, risk to children born to 
mothers exposed to elagolix during pregnancy, including the possibility of malformations.
Pregnancies must be reported immediately and study drug discontinued.  Information on 
the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected.  For live infant births, information on the health of the infant w ill be collected 6 to 12 months after delivery.
Pregnancy outcomes must also be monitored vigilantly across the entire development program, including adverse events related to pregnancy outcomes.  Women should also be counseled on the unknown, thus potential, risk to children born to mothers exposed to elagolix during pregnancy, including the possibility of malformations.
Efficacy in Phase 2 Uterine Fibroid Studies
The main objectives of the uterine fibroids Phase 2 program in premenopausal women 
were as follows:  1) to select the most appropriate dose(s) of el agolix to evaluate in 
Phase 2b and Phase 3 from both an efficacy and safety perspective, and 2) to assess the need for, adequacy, and type of add-back therapy to be used in conjunction with elagolix.  The first objective was accomplished in the 3-month Phase 2a, dose-ranging POC study, Study M12-663, and the second objective was acco mplished in both Phase 2 studies (need 
for and type of add-back in Phase 2a a nd adequacy of add-back therapy in Phase 2b 
[6-month safety and efficacy study]).
The Phase 2a dose-finding, POC study evaluated TDDs of elagolix of 200, 400, and 
600 mg in premenopausal women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  While it was anticipated that some women would likely benefit (reduction in menstrual bleeding), even with low doses (TDD of 200 mg) of elagolix, the agreed-upon dose selection criteria for Phase 2b was predicated on a dose in Phase 2a that provided the most robust response (responder rates of approximately > 80% for the composite bleeding assessment) and an acceptable safety and bleeding profile for the majority of women.  It was known that to support long-term dosing with elagolix at th ese higher doses, hormone add-back therapy 
would be required for all of these.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
37
All elagolix doses resulted in statistically superior reductions in the mean percentage of 
menstrual blood loss (MBL) from baseline measured by the alkaline hematin method compared to placebo, with the largest effect noted with the 300 mg BID dosing regimen.  With regard to the primary endpoint, the add-back therapy with low-dose E2/NETA or cyclical EP ha d marginal effects on the efficacy of elagolix.  Furthermore, co-
administration of low-dose E2/NETA or cyclical EP (progesterone administered from Day 17 through Day 28 per treatment cycle) had comparable efficacy on the percentage change in MBL or the percentage of subjects who met the composite bleeding endpoint (MBL volume of < 80 mL at the Final Month [last 28 days of treatment], and≥ 50% 
reduction in MBL volume from Baseline to the Final Month [last 28 days of treatment]) relative to elagolix administration alone.  When co-administered with elagolix (200 or 300 mg BID), both add-back therapy regimens were efficacious in reducing the percentage of moderate-to-severe bleeding da ys, with increases in bleeding days being 
primarily due to spotting.
Based on data from the Phase 2a study, a TDD of 600 mg and 2 doses of E2/NETA add-
back therapy (low-dose E2/NETA and standard-dose E2/NETA) were selected for Phase 2b.
The Phase 2b study evaluated the safety and efficacy of elagolix TDD of 600 mg 
administered either (QD or BID regimens), alone and in combination with 2 different strengths of E2/NETA in premenopausal women age 18 to 51 years with HMB associated 
with uterine fibroids.  The study consisted of a 2.5- to 3.5-month Screening Period, a 6-month Treatment Period, and a 6-month Po st-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  Cohort 1 
utilized elagolix 300 mg BID dosing (with and without add-back therapy) while Cohort 2 utilized elagolix 600 mg QD dosing (with and without add-back therapy).
The primary efficacy endpoint was the per centage of subjects meeting a composite 
endpoint consisting of 2 bleeding assessments:  MBL volume of < 80 mL at the Final 
Month (last 28 days of treatment), and≥ 50% reduction in MBL volume from Baseline to 
the Final Month (last 28 days of treatmen t).  The key secondary efficacy endpoints 
include change in fibroid and uterine volume by ultrasound (and MRI in a subset), other

38
key bleeding assessments, specific non-bleeding assessments based on a Non-Bleeding 
Symptoms Uterine Fibroid Questionnaire (NBUFSQ), and other QOL variables including UFS-QOL.  The safety and tolerability objectives include the assessment of standard safety parameters, in addition to hypoestrogenic adverse events of interest, including BMD loss as assessed by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and vasomotor 
symptoms, such as hot flush.  Endometrial health via transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) and endometrial biopsy are also evaluated.
Preliminary results from Cohort 1 demonstrated that treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID 
plus E2/NETA showed the following:
●Robust efficacy in controlling HMB (composite bleeding endpoint of 91.9%, 
85.5%, and 79% in the elagolix 300 mg BID alone, elagolix 300 mg BID plus 
low-dose E2/NETA, and elagolix 300 mg BID plus standard-dose E2/NETA treatment groups, respectively) assoc iated with uterine fibroids
●Clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life measures and symptom severity scores as assessed by UFS-QOL
●Mitigation of BMD loss at the lumbar spine, with standard-dose E2/NETA
●Substantial dose-dependent reducti on in the incidence of vasomotor 
symptoms, e.g., hot flushes
●No evidence of endometrial safety concerns
●Overall safety profile remains unchanged, with no new or unexpected findings to date.
Overall, preliminary findings from the Phas e 2b study suggest that standard-dose 
E2/NETA as add-back therapy may be effective in preventing BMD loss during treatment 
with elagolix 300 mg BID, with minimal impact on primary efficacy bleeding endpoints in premenopausal women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  This dosing regimen could potentially meet the objective of a long-term therapy for the management 
of symptomatic uterine fibroids in premenopausal women.

Preliminary results from Study M12-813 show that all treatment arms (both doses of 
elagolix [300 mg BID and 600 mg QD] alone or in combination with either strength of E2/NETA) met the primary endpoint, which is the proportion of subjects who achieved an MBL volume of < 80 mL at the Final Month and 50% or greater reduction in MBL 
volume from Baseline to the Final Month compared to that of placebo (all P < 0.001), as measured by the alkaline hematin method.
AbbVie Ongoing Phase 3 Clinical Studies
Endometriosis
The Phase 3 endometriosis clinical development program is comprised of two 6-month 
replicate, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Pivotal Studies (Studies M12-665 and M12-667), each with complimentary 6-mont h safety/efficacy extension studies 
(Studies M12-667 and M12-821).  The extension studies are ongoing.  The primary objective of the Pivotal Studies are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy, of elagolix, administered QD or BID compared to placebo, in the management of moderate to severe endometriosis-associated pain while taking into account the use of rescue analgesics.  Secondary efficacy objectives include assessments of other endometriosis-related symptoms, analgesic use, as well as quality of life (QoL) endpoints.  The 6-month 
extension studies assess the long-term safety and efficacy of elagolix for a total treatment duration of up to 12 months.
Phase 3 Clinical Development Program for Uterine Fibroids 
The overall objective of the registration clinical development program is to generate 
requisite safety, tolerability, and efficacy data in 2 replicate 6-month Phase 3 Pivotal
Studies, Studies M12-815 and M12-817, and 1 safety and efficacy Extension Study, 
Study M12-816 (to receive up to a total of 12 months of treatment) to support use of elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) for the intended indication of the chronic management of HMB associated with uterine fibroids. 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
40
Subjects in this Extension Study will have  completed the 6-month Treatment Period in 
one of the Pivotal Studies (Studies M12-815 or M12-817).  In this study, they will receive 
6 months of therapy, for a total of up to 12 months of active treatment for those 
randomized in the Pivotal Studies to active treatment and a total of 6 months of treatment for those randomized to placebo in the Pivotal Studies.
The primary objective of the Pivotal Studies is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
elagolix 300 mg BID in combination with add-back therapy (E2/NETA) as compared to placebo to reduce HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  The goal of the Extension Study is to generate data that supports long-term use of elagolix 300 mg BID in combination with E2/NETA.
Given the difficulties with extending placebo for periods beyond 6 months, the elagolix 
300 mg BID alone arm serves as a reference arm in this Extension Study, which will be useful in fully understanding the protective effects of standard dose E2/NETA on BMD over a 12-month treatment period, therefore the primary objectives of this Extension 
Study are to:
●Evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of elagolix administered alone and 
in combination with E2/NETA
●Reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with uterine fibroids for up to 12 months (initial 6 months if on active treatment in the Pivotal 
Study M12-815 or Study M12-817 and an additional 6 months in this Extension Study), and
●Further characterize the impact of E2/NETA on the safety and tolerability 
(including bone mineral density and other hypoestrogenic effects and efficacy 
of elagolix. 
3.3 Estradiol/Norethindrone Acetate
E2/NETA (1 mg E2 and 0.5 mg NETA) is a continuous combined oral estrogen/progestin 
regimen.  E2/NETA is approved in the United States as postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy for the treatment of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms

41
associated with menopause and the pre vention of postmenopausal osteoporosis.  
E2/NETA is also approved in the United States for the treatment of moderate to severe 
symptoms of vulvar and vaginal atrophy associated with menopause.
3.4 Differences Statement
Phase 2 studies in women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids demonstrated that 
elagolix 300 mg BID provides the most robust efficacy in reducing HMB, and E2/NETA is the optimal regimen for managing and limiti ng BMD loss, such that longer-term dosing 
is feasible.
Continued assessments of this treatment regimen in the pivotal Phase 3 trials will provide 
the requisite data to support registration of elagolix 300 mg BID + E2/NETA as safe and 
efficacious treatment for the chronic management of HMB associated with uterine fibroids.
3.5 Benefits and Risks
The most common symptom in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids is heavy 
menstrual bleeding (HMB).  A safe and effective chronic pharmacologic therapy for 
symptomatic uterine fibroids, as an alternative to hysterectomy or other surgical intervention, has not yet been approved, which is the objective of the Elagolix Phase 3 Clinical Development Program.  Results from Phase 2 studies in women with HMB associated with uterine fibro ids demonstrated that treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID 
alone and in combination with E2/NETA provided robust efficacy in reducing HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Importantly, when co-administered with elagolix 300 mg 
BID, E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) QD mitigated BMD loss observed with elagolix 300 mg BID alone a nd substantially other hypoestrogenic adverse 
events such as hot flushes.  Also co-administration of elagolix and E2/NETA attenuated increases in serum lipid parameters observed with elagolix 300 mg BID alone.  Furthermore, there was no evidence of endometrial safety concerns and the overall safety profile remained unchanged, with no new or unexpected findings to date.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
42
This therapeutic approach, if successful, could provide an alternative to surgical 
interventions, and/or semi-invasive procedures as a chronic pharmacologic treatment for HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  Based on the totality of data to date from the Phase 2 clinical development program, the overall benefit/risk profile of elagolix 300 mg BID with E2/NETA appears to be favorable for the chronic management of HMB associated with uterine fibro ids, and will be further defined in this Phase 3 trial.
4.0 Study Objective
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of elagolix administered alone and in combination with add-back therapy (estradiol/norethindrone acetate or E2/NETA) to reduce heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB) associated with uterine fibroids for up to 12 months (initial 6 months if on active treatment in the Pivotal Study M12-815 or Study M12-817 and an additional 6 months in this Extension Study).
The study will also evaluate the effects of the treatment regimens on hypoestrogenic side 
effects, changes in bone mineral density (BMD) as assessed by Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA), and vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flush.
5.0 Investigational Plan
5.1 Overall Study Design and Plan:  Description
This is a Phase 3, double-blind, mult icenter, Extension Study designed to:
●Obtain 6 month treatment data in subjects who were randomized to placebo in 
one of the two Pivotal Studies and subsequently randomized to receive 6 months of treatment with elagolix 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus 
E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) QD in this study.
●Obtain 12 months of continuous treatment data in subjects who received elagolix 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 
1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) QD for 6 months in one of the two Pivotal

Studies and will continue to receive an additional 6 months of the same 
treatment in this study.
●Obtain data on endometrial health (TAU, TVU and endometrial biopsy).
●Assess bone mineral density, bone health and general safety with long-term 
treatment and recovery during Treatm ent and  Post-Treatment Follow-Up 
Period (up to 12 months of Treatment and 12 months Post-Treatment Follow-
Up).
All subjects who completed the 6-Month Treatment Period in their respective Pivotal 
Study, who meet eligibility criteria and provide informed consent, will be eligible to 
enroll in this Extension Study.  This  study is designed to enroll approximately 
400 subjects across approximately 250 clinical study sites to meet scientific and regulatory objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations.
The study consists of 2 periods as follows:
1. 6-Month Treatment Period
2. 12-Month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period
Following the 6-Month Treatment Period, subjects will enter into a 12-Month Post-
Treatment Follow-Up Period.  The St udy Periods are illustrated in Figure 1 .

Subjects will perform Day 1 Visit procedures after completing the 6-Month Treatment 
Period of their respective Pivotal Study.  Subjects who do not meet criteria for inclusion into or are not willing to participate in the Extension Study will enter the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period in their respective Pivotal Study, Study M12-815 or Study M12-817.
Subjects will continue to be assigned study drug kits via the IRT system for the Extension Study, after eligibility is confirmed and consent is obtained.  Subjects who received active treatment in the Pivotal Study will conti nue to receive the same treatment; subjects 
randomized to placebo will be re-randomized in IRT to receive either elagolix 300 mg BID) or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA QD for 6 months.  Subjects will remain blinded to their original treatment received in the Pivotal Studies as well as their treatment in this Extension Study.  The first dose of study drug will be administered at the study site 
on Day 1.  Subjects will continue to self-a dminister study drug twice daily (once in the 
morning and once in the evening approximately 12 hours apart) orally without regard to 
food throughout the 6-Month Treatment Period.  Subjects randomized into the study will visit the site during the 6-Month Treatment Period on Day 1, and then monthly (28-day

intervals) from Month 1 through Month 6.  Additional study visits may occur, either for 
subjects returning their sanitary products at a Product Collection Visit or for a Premature Discontinuation Visit (if applicable).
Pregnancy tests (urine and/or serum) will be performed at each visit throughout the study 
and subjects will be counseled at each visit on appropriate and effective forms of dual non-hormonal contraception to promote pregnancy prevention. 
Sanitary product collection kits will continue to  be dispensed at all Treatment Period 
Visits.  Subjects will be required to collect all sanitary products on days with menstrual 
bleeding or spotting throughout the Treatment Period.  Subjects will return sanitary 
products to the Clinical Study Site, either during a scheduled monthly visit or at a Product Collection Visit.  There may be an option f or subjects to have a Product Collection Visit 
conducted at home by a Home Health Care Agent.
As in the Pivotal Studies, when a Subject does not return a sanitary product collection keg 
at any site visit (scheduled monthly vis it or at time of Premature Discontinuation, Product 
Collection Visit or Unscheduled Visit) during the Treatment Period, the Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire (UBQ) will be administered by the Site Staff to indicate if the subject had any bleeding or spotting since the last study visit.  If the subject had bleeding or spotting, she will be asked why she did not return a sanitary product collection keg.  The subject's responses will be recorded on the UBQ by the Site Staff.
A pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) will be performed during the Treatment Period as 
outlined in Appendix C .
Subjects will continue the use of dual non-hormonal contraception and receive counseling on the importance of consistent, appropriate and effective use of birth control.  Subjects who prematurely discontinue from the Treatmen t Period will be asked to complete 
Premature Discontinuation procedures and en ter the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  
Premature Discontinuation Procedures will be performed as specified in Appendix C , 
Study Activities.

Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period
During the 12-Month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, visits will occur either by phone 
or on-site from Months 1 through 12.
During the Phone Visits (Post-Treatment Fo llow-up Visits Month 2, Month 4, Month 5, 
Month 7, Month 8, Month 10 and Month 11), Site Personnel will discuss adverse events, 
concomitant medications, if applicable, obtain the results of the subject's self-administered urine pregnancy test and will remind subjects of the importance of consistent use of appropriate and effective dual non-hormonal contraception throughout the Post-Treatment 
Follow-Up Period.  Subjects may begin tak ing hormonal contraceptive preparations only 
after completing the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and following the return to 
a full menses (menses with full menstrual flow ) in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  
If the subject's full menses has not returned by the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit, an adverse event of amenorrhea should be documented.
Subjects will be required to collect sanitary products for their first menses with full 
menstrual flow in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  If the subject does not return 
sanitary products for her first full menses, she will be required to collect and return sanitary products for her next full menses.  Subjects will return the sanitary products at a Product Collection Visit within approximately 5 days after cessation of bleeding or spotting.  The Post-Treatment UBQ will be administered by Site Staff at each Phone or Site Visit until the subject has returned sanitary products from her first full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  Once a subject returns sanitary products from a full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, the Post-Treatment UBQ no longer needs to be completed.
All subjects will be required to have DXA scans at Post-Treatment Follow-Up Months 6 
and 12.
Procedures and assessments in the Post-T reatment Follow-Up Peri od should be performed 
as specified in Appendix C , Study Activities.

Unscheduled Visit
In the event an Unscheduled Visit is necessary during the Treatment or Post-Treatment 
Follow-Up Period, the site will perform at minimum, the UBQ and an assessment of
adverse events and concomitant medications.  For Unscheduled Visits when study drug is dispensed (e.g., to replenish lost or damaged study drug), the subject will also be required to have a negative urine pregnancy test result prior to dispensing.  Clinical judgment should dictate when other safety assessments (such as vital signs and/or symptom-directed physical examination) should be conducted and should also support the reason for the Unscheduled Visit.
Visit Windows
Visit windows will be allowed for the monthly visits during the Treatment and Post-
Treatment Follow-Up Periods.  During the Treatment Period, each subsequent monthly visit should be scheduled based on the date of the Day 1 Visit.  At the Month 6 Treatment Period Visit, a –4 or +6 day visit window will be allowed in order to collect sanitary products from the last episode of menstrual bleeding or spotting prior to the Month 6 Visit if menstrual bleeding starts immediately prior to or coincides with the scheduled visit.  The subject will be instructed to continue taking study drug from the extra blister card until she returns for the Month 6 Visit.
Specific assessment-related visit windows are all owed.  Please refer to Table 1, Visit and 
Assessment Windows, for assessment-specific visit windows.

5.2 Selection of Study Population
Subjects who completed the 6-Month Treatment Period of their respective Pivotal Study, 
have signed informed consent and meet eligibility criteria will be eligible for participation into this Extension Study.
Each Investigator will employ their clinical judgment in conjunction with protocol 
specified inclusion/exclusion criteria to d etermine if subject meets eligibility.  Questions 
should be directed to the AbbVie Therapeutic Area Medical Director (TA MD) listed in Section 6.1.5 if further clar ification is required.
5.2.1 Inclusion Criteria
1. Subject has voluntarily signed and dated the informed consent form (ICF), 
approved by an Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee (IRB/EC), prior to initiation of any study-specific procedures.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
49
2. Subject has completed the 6-Month Treatment Period of their respective Pivotal 
Study (either Study M12-815 or Study M12-817).
3. Subject has BMD decrease < 8% in the spine, total hip and femoral neck at 
Month 6 of the Treatment Period of their respective Pivotal Study. 
4. Subject's urine and/or serum pregnancy test(s) results were consistently negative 
during the Treatment Period of their respective Pivotal Study and at Day 1 of this 
Extension Study. 
5. Subject must agree to use two forms of non-hormonal contraception (dual 
contraception) consistently during the Treatment Period and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period (S ubject may start hormonal contraception after completion of 
the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Vi sit and return to first full menses).
Acceptable methods of dual contraception include the following combinations:
●Condom with spermicide (foam, gel, or polymer film)
●Diaphragm with spermicide (condom may or may not be used)
●Cervical cap with spermicide (condom may or may not be used)
Subject is not required to use dual contraception methods if:
●Sexual partner(s) is vasectomized, at least 6 months prior to Screening.
●Subject practices total abstinence from sexual intercourse, as the preferred 
lifestyle of the subject; periodic abstinence is not acceptable.
●Subject had a bilateral tubal occlusion (including ligation and blockage 
methods such as Essure
®), at least 4 months prior to Screening.
●Subject is not sexually active with men; periodic sexual relationship(s) with men requires the use of dual non-hormonal contracep tion as noted above.
6. Subject's endometrial biopsy from the Month 6 Visit of their respective Pivotal 
Study shows no clinically significant endometrial pathology.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
50
Rationale for Inclusion Criteria:
1 This is standard criterion in accordance with harmonized Good Clinical 
Practice (GCP)
2, 3 These criteria were selected to ensure an appropriate subject population of 
premenopausal women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids 
(prognostic and predictive)
4, 5 The impact of elagolix on pregnancies or breastfed infants is unknown and 
there is a possible risk of miscarriage due to changes in hormone levels; 
therefore, these criteria ensure pregnant women are not enrolled into the study and adequate precautions are taken to avoid pregnancy during study participation (prognostic and risk)
6 This is standard criteria to ensure general good health and the safety of the 
subjects (risk)
5.2.2 Exclusion Criteria
A subject will not be eligible for study participation if she meets any of the following 
criteria:
1. Subject met criteria for removal from therapy in her respective Pivotal Study.
2. Subject is planning a pregnancy within the next 18 months.3. Subject has current suicidal ideation as evidenced by answering "yes" to 
questions 4 or 5 on the suicidal ideation porti on of the Columbia-Suicide Severity 
Rating Scale (C-SSRS) completed at Treatment Period Month 6 Visit of her 
respective Pivotal Study.
4. Subject has a newly diagnosed clinically significant medical condition that requires 
intervention ORan unstable medical condition that makes the subject an unsuitable 
candidate for the study in the opinion of the Investigator (including, but not limited to, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled hypertension, epilepsy requiring anti-epileptic medication, unstable angina, confirmed inflammatory bowel disease, 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
51
hyperprolactinemia, clinically significant infection or injury or symptomatic 
endometriosis [confirmed by laparoscopy/laparotomy]).
5. Subject is using any systemic corticosteroids for over 14 days or is likely to require 
treatment with systemic corticosteroids during the course of the study.  Over-the-counter and prescription topical, inhaled, intranasal or injectable (for occasional use) corticosteroids are allowed.
6. Subject, who in the judgment of the Investigator, will be unable or unwilling to 
comply with study-related assessments and procedures, including co llection of 
sanitary products. 
Rationale for Exclusion Criteria:
1, 3, 4, 5 This is standard criteria to ensure general good health and the safety of 
the subjects (risk)
2 The impact of elagolix on pregnancies or breastfed infants is unknown 
and there is a possible risk of miscarriage due to changes in hormone levels; therefore, these criteria ensure adequate precautions are taken to 
avoid pregnancy or breastfeeding while receiving elagolix (risk)
6 This criterion was added to ensure the population of subjects enrolled 
will comply with study-related procedures and subject collection 
requirements throughout the entire study (predictive)
5.2.2.1 Concomitant Therapy
Any medications and therapies that were administered in the Pivotal Study and are 
continuing to be administered at the time of entry into this study should be reviewed, assessed and if applicable, added to the source documents and eCRFs of this Extension Study.
Any new medications or vaccines (including over-the-counter or prescription medicines, 
vitamins and/or herbal supplements) that the subject receives during the Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods must be recorded in source documents and on the 
Elagolix (ABT-620)

Concomitant Medication eCRFs.  The reason for use, date(s) of administration (including 
start and end dates) and dosage information (including dose and frequency) must be recorded.
5.2.2.2 Iron Supplementation
Excessive blood loss from heavy menses may result in iron deficiency anemia.  Iron 
deficiency anemia is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an Hgb concentration below 12 g/dL (120 g/L) for non-pregnant women.  Subjects entering the study with anemia or who develop anemia during the study,  if not already taking iron supplements, should be prescribed iron supplementation by the Investigator, as per standard of care.  If the Investigator does not prescribe iron supplements for subjects with a Hgb < 12g/dL, the reason should be documented in source documents.
The recommended oral dose of ferrous sulfate is 300 to 325 mg following the diagnosis of 
anemia.  If a subject is unable to tolerate ferrous sulfate then ferrous gluconate, liquid iron or intravenous (IV) iron may be prescribed.  If subjects experience constipation from iron supplement use, stool softeners may be prescribed.  All iron supplements taken during the study must be recorded on the concomitant medications eCRF.
Further instructions on the provision of iron supplementation and stool softeners will be 
provided sepa rately from this protocol.
5.2.2.3 Concomitant Use of Corticosteroids
Chronic use (> 14 days) of systemic corticosteroids is prohibited during the Treatment 
and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods; however, inhaled corticosteroids for the treatment of asthma are permitted.  Over-the-counter and prescription topical, inhaled, intranasal or injectable (for occasional use) corticosteroids are allowed.
5.2.2.4 Prohibited Therapy
All hormonal forms of birth control (e xcept the emergency contraceptive pill, 
levonorgestrel 1.5 mg [such as Plan B

Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and return to first full menses.  If subject does not return to 
menses she must continue use of dual non-hormonal contraception.
For subjects who are prescribed/administered the emergency contraceptive pill during the 
study, the AbbVie TA MD must be informed.
Tranexamic acid should not be taken during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up 
Period; however, tranexamic acid, if necessary, can be prescribed following completion of the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit a nd the subject has returned to first full 
menses.
Due to the extensive list of herbal remedies and supplements, please contact the AbbVie 
TA MD for any that may be prohibited.  Generally-speaking, any supplements or herbal remedies used to treat premenstrual or gynecological problems, such as black cohosh, are excluded.

% Subjects may begin the use of hormonal contraceptives or tranexamic following completion of the Post-Treatment 
Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and she has returned to first full menses.  Tranexamic acid, if necessary can be 
prescribed following completion of the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and return to first full menses.
If a prohibited medication is necessary to treat an adverse event or a pre-existing 
condition other than uterine fibroids, the AbbVie TA MD noted in Section 6.1.5 should be 
consulted; however, if clinically required and to prevent an immediate hazard to the subject being treated, the AbbVie TA MD should be notified as soon as possible after the start of use.  Additionally, if a subject takes a prohibited medication during the study, except as permitted per protocol (hormonal medication taken after completion of the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and return to first full menses), her continued participation in the study will be evaluated by the Investigator and the AbbVie TA MD.  If there are any questions regarding prior or c oncomitant therapy, please contact your Study 
Monitor.
5.2.3 Contraception Recommendations and Pregnancy Testing
Contraception Counseling/Dispense Contraceptives
Subjects (excluding those subjects who have had a bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral tubal 
occlusion) will continue to be counseled at every visit throughout their participation in the study on the importance of pregnancy prevention and the use of appropriate and effective 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
56
methods of birth control during the Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods of 
the Extension Study.
Subjects must agree to use two forms of non-hormonal contraception (dual contraception) 
consistently throughout the Treatment Period and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods 
(Subjects may begin the use of hormonal contraception (e.g., oral or IUD) after completing the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and have returned sanitary products for a full menses).
Acceptable methods of dual non-hormonal contraception include the following 
combinations:
●Condom with spermicide (foam, gel, or polymer film)
●Diaphragm with spermicide (condom may or may not be used)
●Cervical cap with spermicide (condom may or may not be used)
Subjects are not required to use dual contraception methods if:
●Sexual partner(s) is vasectomized at least 6 months prior to Screening
●Subject practices total abstinence from sexual intercourse, as the preferred 
lifestyle of the subject; periodic abstinence is not acceptable
●Subject had a bilateral tubal occlusion (including ligation and blockage 
methods such as Essure
®) at least 4 months prior to Screening.
●Subject is not sexually active with men; periodic sexual relationship(s) with men requires the use of dual non-hormonal contracep tion as indicated above.
Subjects may begin the use of hormonal contraception in place of dual non- hormonal 
contraception during the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period if they meet both of the 
following: 
●Completed the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and
●Returned sanitary products for a full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up 
Period
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
57
If subject does not return to full menses, she must continue use of dual non -hormonal 
contraception.
The following measures will be taken to help ensure pregnancy prevention during the 
Extension Study.
1. The informed consent form will include an attestation requiring the subject to 
confirm in writing her full awarene ss that the potential risks of study drug 
(elagolix) on the unborn child are unknown and therefore she must not get pregnant during the entire time of study participation, and that she agrees to consistently use dual non-hormonal contracep tion throughout her study participation (during the 
Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.
2. The Investigator or designated study staff will counsel the subject that the study 
drug is not contraceptive, that ovulation may occur even though the study drug may 
have altered menstrual cyclicity, and that fetal abnormalities have been observed in women who have received elagolix in clinical studies that were not deemed to be related to elagolix based on the totalit y of data; however, it is unknown whether 
these abnormalities were the result of taking elagolix.
3. The Sponsor will provide training materials to the sites for instructing subjects on 
the types of protocol-allowed contracepti on methods, their effectiveness and proper 
use.
●The Sponsor will provide sites with a supply of materials to promote 
pregnancy prevention, including contraceptives (condoms and spermicides), 
and lubricants to provide to subjects at no charge.  Subjects should only use the pregnancy prevention materials provided by the Sponsor as these products 
have undergone analytical testing by the analytical lab to confirm there is no or 
limited interference with the alkaline hematin method.
●Subjects will be allowed to choose a contraception method of their choice from 
the contraceptives provided by the Sponsor and practice the allowable methods of dual contraception.  The site will a ssess the subject's basic understanding of 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
58
the proper use through discussion and demonstration of proper techniques, 
including proper diaphragm use.
●The site will dispense contraceptives to subjects throughout Treatment and through the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Peri od, as needed.  Subjects may begin 
the use of hormonal medication after completion of the Post-Treatment 
Follow-Up Month 2 Visit and return to first full menses.
●The source documents will capture date contraception counseling was 
performed, whether the subject is se xually active with men, the type of 
contraceptive used, a change in contraceptive method, use of a non-study 
supply brand, contraceptives provided to the subject, and the date supplies 
were provided.
●As appropriate, the subject will be asked to attest by signature at the time of consent, and in a stand-alone attestation form at Day 1 and at the Month 6 or 
Premature Discontinuation study visit that allowable methods of contraception, 
as described during the pregnancy prevention counseling, are being practiced.
●For subjects who have had a bilateral tubal occlusion, attestation is only 
required to be collected once at the time of consent.
4. Subjects will be reminded to use dual non-hormonal contraception.
5. The study drug will be dispensed as a monthly supply at the beginning of each 
month during the Treatment Period to promote frequent interaction with site staff 
and opportunities for continued education.
6. At each visit, subjects will be asked to name the type of contraception used since 
their last visit and will be reminded of the proper use of that type of method to prevent ineffective contraception and the risk of unexpected pregnancy due to unprotected sexual activity.
Pregnancy Tests and Reporting a Pregnancy
Urine and/or serum pregnancy tests will be performed as specified in Appendix C , Study 
Activities, in all subjects regardless of sexual activity status or method of contraception.  
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
59
The subject must have a confirmed negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to 
performing endometrial biopsy or SIS (if applicable).
The urine and serum pregnancy tests performed at the Final Treatment Visit (Month 6 or 
Unscheduled Visit just prior to roll-over into the Extension Study) of the Pivotal Study will serve to assess subject eligibility for entry into this Extension Study and the urine 
pregnancy test result must be reviewed and determined to be negative prior to registering the subject in IRT.  If the Final Treatment Visit in the Pivotal Study (just prior to roll-over into this Extension Study) does not occur on the same day as Day 1 of this Extension Study, a urine pregnancy test must be perform ed at Day 1 and a negative urine pregnancy 
test result must be obtained prior to administration of the first dose of study drug in this Extension Study.
Urine pregnancy test results must be negative prior to providing subjects with their Day 1 
and subsequent supply of study drug, (including an Unscheduled Visit at which study drug is dispensed).
Home pregnancy test kits will be provided to the subject at the Day 1 Visit and Month 6 
or Premature Discontinuation Visit during the Treatment Period when logistically, a urine pregnancy test cannot be performed at the study site or other medical facility within 24 hours prior to an endometrial biopsy or SIS (if applicable).  The subject must self-administer and report a negative urine pregnancy test result to the site within 24 hours prior to undergoing these procedures.
A positive urine pregnancy test result must be confirmed with a quantitative serum 
pregnancy test.  The subject should temporarily discontinue study drug administration while waiting for the results of the serum pregna ncy test.  If a serum pregnancy test result 
is positive at any time during the Treatment Period, the site will immediately inform the subject to discontinue study drug (Section 6.1.6 ).  If a subject is confirmed as pregnant, 
the subject will be prematurely discontinued from the study.

An ultrasound examination will be performed dur ing the first trimester of pregnancy to 
assess the gestational age and estimated date of delivery if the subject becomes pregnant 
during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods of the study.  Refer to Section 6.1.6 for instructions on reporting of a pregnancy to the Sponsor and the required 
follow-up on the subject/fetus and live infant births.
5.3 Efficacy, Pharmacokinetic, Pharmacodynamic, 
Pharmacogenetic and Safety Assessments/Variables
5.3.1 Efficacy and Safety Measurements Assessed and Flow 
Chart
Study procedures during the Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods described 
in this protocol are summarized in Appendix C , Study Activities.
5.3.1.1 Study Procedures
Subjects entering into this Extension St udy will have completed all Month 6 study 
procedures in their respective pivotal study, Studies M12-815 or M12-817, and following 
availability of all assessment results, the subject will have been determined to be eligible 
for this Extension Study.
Study procedures in this Extension Study be gin on Day 1 and should be conducted as per 
Appendix C , Study Activities.  When the Day 1 Visit occurs on the same day as the Final 
Treatment Visit of the respective Pivotal Study, assessments and procedures performed at 
the Final Treatment Visit should not be repeated at the Day 1 Visit of this Extension Study, unless deemed necessary by the Principal Investigator. 
The study procedures outlined in Appendix C , Study Activities, are discussed in detail in 
this section, with the exception of the monitoring of study drug accountability 
(Section 5.5.7 ) and the collection of concomitant medication and adverse event
information (Section 5.2.2.1 and Section 6.1, respectively).  Study data will be recorded 
on eCRFs with the exception of several PRO questionnaires that will be recorded on source documents and on eCRFs.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
61
Study procedures during the Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods may be 
performed within the visit windows specified in Table 1 .  Scheduled monthly visits during 
the Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period are based on a 28-day month.
This protocol provides recommendations regarding the sequence of procedures to be 
performed during the study.  In no case should these recommendations outweigh clinical judgment or standard of care.  If the protocol indicates that the AbbVie TA MD is to be contacted prior to performing a procedure, yet the timing of the request would either interrupt a procedure or would interfere with standard of care and clinical judgment, then clinical judgment should prevail and the AbbVie TA MD should be notified afterwards.
When findings of past medical, surgical, gyn ecological or uterine fibroid history are 
identified, the relevant eCRF(s) and Source Note(s) of the Pivotal Study 
(Studies M12-815 or M12-817) should be updated, unless otherwise instructed by the Monitor.
Informed Consent
The IRB/IEC approved informed consent will be signed by the subject before beginning 
any study-specific procedures.  Details about how informed consent will be obtained and documented are provided in Section 9.3.
Gynecological (Pelvic and Breast) Examination
A complete breast, and pelvic examination, including external genitalia will be performed during the Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation Visit in the Treatment Period.
Pap Test
A Pap test will be performed at Treatment Period Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation 
Visit.
A Pap test will be collected using the Thin Prep®Pap Test™ provided and analyzed by 
the central laboratory.  If the subject is experiencing menstrual bleeding that precludes the 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
62
performance of the Pap test, this procedure should be performed as soon as possible after 
the menstrual bleeding has ended.  In the cas e of an unsatisfactory sample, the Pap test 
should be repeated.  The repeat Pap test should be performed when the subject is not experiencing menstrual bleeding.
Subjects who have Pap test results that require additional evaluation should follow local 
guidelines or standard of care.  In addition, the AbbVie TA MD should be notified to discuss subject's management plan for any clinically significant pathologic findings during the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.
All subjects will continue in the Post-T reatment Follow-Up Peri od.  Subjects who may 
require colposcopy will enter the Post-Tr eatment Follow-Up Period and should be treated 
per local guidelines or standard of care.
Endometrial Biopsy
Instructions on endometrial biopsy collection and processing procedures for shipping will 
be provided by the central laboratory.  Sites can use the endometrial biopsy instruments provided by the Central Lab or any other endometrial  biopsy instruments available at the 
study site.  Subjects must have a confirmed negative urine pregnancy test within 24 hours prior to undergoing the endometrial biopsy.
Pre-medication for the endometrial biopsy proce dure is allowable and should be recorded 
in source documents and on the appropriate eCRF.  Misoprostol for cervical dilatation is 
allowable.  An office hysteroscopy may be performed to obtain the endometrial biopsy sample if the endometrial biopsy cannot be performed because of anatomical reasons.
An endometrial biopsy will be performed at the Treatment Period Month 6 Visit or at the 
Premature Discontinuation Visit (if the subject prematurely discontinues after the Month 3 Visit).
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
63
If the endometrial biopsy is performed on the same day as the Pap smear or pelvic 
ultrasound, the endometrial biopsy should be performed after the Pap smear and pelvic 
ultrasound.
In the event that the Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation Visit endometrial biopsy 
cannot be performed (e.g., due to a stenotic cervix or location of fibroids), or an insufficient biopsy sample is obtained and the concurrent TVU indicates a thickness of > 4 mm, a repeat biopsy must be performed.  If upon repeat, a sample cannot be obtained or remains insufficient, the AbbVie TA MD should be consulted.
Subjects with abnormal endometrial pathology results at Treatment Month 6 will enter the 
Post-Treatment Follow-Up Peri od and should be managed according to standard of care.  
The subject's management plan for any of thes e significant pathologic findings should be 
reviewed with the AbbVie TA MD, and the subject outcome documented in the eCRF.
Physical Examination
During the Treatment Period and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods, a complete physical 
examination will be performed at Treatment Period Month 6 and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation Visits.  The complete physical examination 
will include weight measurements.  Sympto m-directed physical examinations will be 
performed as specified in Appendix C , Study Activities.
Any clinically significant physical examination findings will be recorded in the source documents and in the eCRFs as adverse events.
Vital Signs
Vital sign determination of heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate and body 
temperature will be obtained at all visits during the study as indicated in Appendix C , 
Study Activities.  The blood pressure and heart rate measurements should be taken prior to scheduled blood collections.  Body temperat ure measurements should be assessed using 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
64
the same modality consistently throughout the study, e.g., oral, aural, axillary, etc., and 
the modality will be reported in the source documents and eCRF.
12-Lead Electrocardiogram (ECG)
During the Treatment Period, a resting 12-lead ECG will be conducted at the Month 6 
Visit or Premature Discontinuation Vi sit (if applicable) as indicated in Appendix C , Study 
Activities.
The Investigator or qualified designee at the study site will determine if any findings 
outside the normal physiological variation are clinically significant (in consultation with a 
cardiologist if necessary), and document this on the ECG tracing/report with signature and 
date.  The original ECG tracing or a certified copy of the original tracing with the physician's assessment will be retained in the subject's records at the study site.  For ECG with QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) > 450 msec, the correction formula used (i.e., Bazett's or Fridericia's) and the corrected result should be recorded in source documents and eCRF.  The study site should use the same correction formula used in the respective pivotal study and continue to consistently use throughout this study.
Mammogram
All subjects who had a mammogram performed to determine eligibility into their 
respective Pivotal Study, will have a mammogram performed at Treatment Period Month 6 or at the Premature Discontinuation Visit if it has been approximately 12 months since the screening mammogram was performed.
Central Imaging Procedures
Fibroid and uterine assessments will be obtained using pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) 
throughout the study.  In addition to the TAU a nd TVU, an MRI will continue to be 
performed in the subset of subjects who consented and participated in the MRI Subset during their respective pivotal study.  The MRI subset will continue to evaluate uterine fibroid size and volume and uterine volume using another technique in addition to 
ultrasound.

All ultrasound and MRI images will be sent to the Central Imaging Core Lab (ICL) for 
review to monitor safety during the Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods.
The pelvic ultrasound (TAU, TVU) and/or SIS and MRI (if applicable) will be performed 
by the Investigative Sites' or affiliated Radi ology Department.  The Ultrasonographer at 
each Investigative Site will be required to acquire the ultrasound and MRI (if applicable) images according to the Imaging Acquisition Guidelines provided by the ICL.  Images should be sent/transmitted to the ICL for subject evaluation during the course of the study.  Refer to the Image Acquisition Guidelines for instructions on submitting images to the ICL.
The pelvic ultrasound (TAU, TVU), and/or SIS and MRI (if applicable) will be assessed 
both locally and by the ICL.  If images are unevaluable, the ICL will inform the Investigative Site and additional images will  need to be resubmitted.  If there is a 
discrepancy between the local assessment and the central reader's assessment, this should be brought to AbbVie's attention and AbbVie will discuss the findings with the local site and central reader on a case-by-case basis.  The Investigator or designee should consult the local ultrasound and SIS reports and/or images in order to make any safety-related judgments concerning the subject.  The interpretation of the local report and/or images will be filed or recorded in the subject's source documents.  Data and/or local interpretation from the local ultrasound and SIS images will not be recorded in the eCRF unless associated with a significant finding or adverse event.
During the Treatment and Post-Treatment Periods, the ICL may issue a report if any 
significant changes are observed that may affect subject safety during the study.  In these cases, the Investigator should review the local ultrasound and/or MRI images and treat as per standard of care.
The pelvic ultrasound, and MRI (if applicable) will be performed as specified in 
Appendix C , Study Activities.

●Fibroid location
●Uterine volume in cubic centimeters
●Presence of adenomyosis (diffuse adenomyosis as the dominant condition 
versus focal) 
●Presence of any concerning findings
Depending on the size of the uterus, MRI images of the abdominal cavity may need to be 
submitted to measure uterine volume and to assess for safety.  It is recommended to follow standard of care when determining which anatomical sections are to be included in order to prevent incomplete views, thus leading to repeat procedures.  Please refer to the Image Acquisition Guidelines for further details. 
Intracavitary Uterine Findings
An SIS may be performed during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods 
when the pelvic ultrasound (TAU and TVU) or MRI (if applicable) results suggest an intracavitary lesion such as a polyp.  The finding of a polyp during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods should be docum ented as an adverse event if the 
Investigator considers it to be clinically significant.
The AbbVie TA MD should be notified of the subject's management plan for any 
clinically significant pathologic findings during the Treatment and Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods.
Ovarian Findings:
During Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods, if the pelvic ultrasound shows a 
simple ovarian cyst > 5 cm or a complex ovarian cyst (including endometriomas) > 3.5 cm in longest diameter the findings should be documented as an adverse event if the Investigator considers them to be clinically significant.

lipid panel results for LDL cholesterol, Triglycerides, Total cholesterol are more than 3 × the upper limit of normal range and the sample was not obtained under fasting conditions (minimum 8 hour fast), the subject will return to the office as soon as possible to have the panel repeated under fasting conditions. 
Apolipoprotein A and B, (Apo A and Apo B)
Blood samples for Apo A and Apo B will be collected as part of the Chemistry Panel.  
The Apo A and Apo B data are exploratory and results will not be provided to the 
Investigative Site.Urine Test for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia (Optional) 
Gonorrhea and chlamydia testing can be ordered at the Investigator's discretion to test for 
active gonorrhea or chlamydia.  Any treatment provided will occur outside of the protocol.
Endocrine Panel
The endocrine panel consists of the following analytes:  FSH, LH, reflexive TSH and 
thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG).
Sanitary Product Collection for Alkaline Hematin Assay
Quantitative measurement of the volume of MBL will be performed using the alkaline 
hematin method.  Menstrual blood loss will be assessed in all subjects using validated 
sanitary products, also referred to as "validated" products.  Validated products have 
undergone analytical testing by the analytical lab to confirm adequate precision and 
Elagolix (ABT-620)

During the Treatment Period, Subjects will collect sanitary products on all days with 
menstrual bleeding or spotting.
Sanitary products collected during the Treatment Period will be returned by the Subject 
within approximately 5 days after cessation of menstrual bleeding or spotting and a 
venous sample will be obtained at either a scheduled monthly visit or at a Product Collection Visit, as appropriate.
Treatment Period Product Collection Visits
Product Collection Visits are only necessary if a monthly visit is not scheduled to occur 
within approximately 5 days after cessation of menstrual bleeding or spotting.  During the 
Product Collection Visits, subjects will have a venous blood sample, urine pregnancy test, vital signs, contraception counseling, as w ell as adverse event and concomitant 
medication assessment.  Product Collection Visits Period should be numbered in

Subjects who do not return a sanitary produ ct collection keg at a site visit (scheduled 
monthly visit, PCV or Unscheduled Visit) w ill be administered the UBQ by the Site Staff.  
The Site Staff will ask the subject if she had any bleeding or spotting since the previous 
visit.  If the subject did have bleeding or spotting since the previous visit, the site staff will ask why the subject did not return sanitary products.  Responses to these questions will be documented on the UBQ by the Site Staff.
Sanitary Product Collection During the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period
Subjects will be required to collect sanitary products on days with menstrual bleeding or 
spotting up through and including their first menses with full menstrual flow in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  Once a subject has submitted sanitary products from her 
first full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period she will no longer be required to collect sanitary products during her subsequent menses.
Subjects who have not returned to their first full menses and have not returned a sanitary 
product collection keg in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period will be administered the UBQ by the Site Staff.  The Site Staff will ask the subject if she had any bleeding or spotting since the previous visit.  If the subject did have bleeding or spotting since the previous visit, the site staff will ask why the subject has not returned for a Post-Treatment Product Collection Visit to return her sanitary products.  Responses to these questions will be documented on the UBQ by the Site Staff.  Once a subject returns sanitary products from a full menses in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, the Post-Treatment UBQ no longer needs to be completed.
Return of Sanitary Products to Alkaline Hematin Vendor
The site will submit sanitary products and venous blood sample collected at the scheduled 
monthly visits or Product Collection Visits to the Alkaline Hematin Lab for analysis as outlined in the Alkaline Hematin Laboratory Manual.

by a Home Health Care Agent who will go to the Subject's home to draw a venous blood 
sample and retrieve the collectio n keg to return to the site.
Use of Non-Validated Products
All subjects are to only use validated products, however, in cases when a subject used non-validated (a product not provided for use in the study), the subject should be instructed to collect and submit the non-validated products to the Study Site.
Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) Rating Scales
As in the Pivotal Studies, Site Personnel will be trained on all rating scales used in this 
study.  The objective of this training is to establish uniformity across sites in administration of these rating instruments.  The following questionnaires will continue to be completed by the Subjects and/or the Investigator or Site Staff, as appropriate at the time points indicated in Appendix C , Study Activities.  Subjects and Site Staff will be 
asked to record their responses directly onto paper questionnaires and enter into the eCRF.
Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire (Treatment-UBQ)
Subjects who did not return a Sanitary Product Collection Keg (for alkaline hematin 
analysis) at a site visit (scheduled monthly visit, PCV or Unscheduled Visit) during the Treatment Period, will be asked to indicate whether they had any uterine bleeding or spotting since their last study visit.  If the subject did not have uterine bleeding or spotting the site staff will indicate "No" on the UBQ.  If the subject did have bleeding or spotting, the subject will be asked the reason they did not return sanitary product collection keg.  This response will be recorded on the UBQ ( Appendix D ) by the Site Staff.
Post-Treatment Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire (Post-Treatment-UBQ)
Subjects who have not collected and returned sa nitary products for their first menses with 
full menstrual flow in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, will be asked at each visit 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1

before sanitary products are returned if they had any bleeding or spotting since their last 
visit.  If the subject did not have uterine bleeding or spotting the site staff will indicate 
"No" on the UBQ.  If the subject did have bleeding or spotting, the subject will be asked the reason she did not return the sanitary product collection keg.  This response will be recorded on the UBQ ( Appendix E ) by the Site Staff.
Uterine Fibroid Symptoms Quality of Life (UFS-QoL) (4-Week Recall)
The UFS-QoL ( Appendix F ) is a disease-specific self-admin istered questionnaire used to 
measure health-related quality of life in women with symptomatic uterine fibroids.  Each 
subject will be asked to complete a modified (4-week recall) UFS-QoL Questionnaire10to 
report fibroid-related symptoms experienced during the previous 4 weeks.
Patient Global Impression of Change – Menstrual Bleeding (PGIC-MB)
Subjects will use the PGIC-MB ( Appendix G ) to assess the change in their severity of 
menstrual bleeding (from very much improved to very much worse) since initiation of 
study drug in their respective pivotal st udy by choosing one of seven responses.
Patient Global Impression of Change – Non-Bleeding Uterine Fibroids Symptoms 
(PGIC-NBUFS)
Subjects will complete the PGIC-NBUFS ( Appendix H ) to document the presence of and 
to assess the change in the overall severity of non-bleeding uterine fibroid symptoms and the severity of specific non-bleeding uterine fibroid symptoms (from very much improved to very much worse) since initiation of study drug in their respective Pivotal Study.

measuring 5 dimensions of health status (mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression).  Subjects will be asked to select a response to each category that best describes their current health.  The EQ-5D-5L also contains a visual analogues scale that collects the quantitative measure of health as judged by the individual respondents.  Subjects will also be asked to rate their current health on a scale of 0 – 100.
Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS)
The C-SSRS is a systematically administered instrument developed to track suicidal 
adverse events across a treatment study.  Th e instrument is designed to assess suicidal 
behavior and ideation, track and assess all suicidal events, as well as the lethality of attempts.  Additional features assessed in clude frequency, duration, controllability, reason 
for ideation, and deterrents.  During the Tr eatment Period, the C-SSRS, Since Last Visit 
(Appendix K ) questionnaire will be administered as specified in Appendix C , Study 
Activities. 
If the subject expresses suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS or via clinical interview at any 
time during the study, the Investigator should take appropriate action and notify the AbbVie TA MD.  Appropriate steps will be taken to protect the subject (including possible discontinuation from the study and referral for appropriate psychiatric care).  The C-SSRS will be administered at the times outlined in Appendix C , Study Activities.
Health Care Resource Utilization (HCRU)
The Health Care Resource Utilization questionnaire ( Appendix L ) will be used to capture 
routine/g eneral health care visits (that are not associated with an adverse event) to non-
study Health Care Providers during the Tr eatment Period.  Subjects will be asked to 
provide information on any visits to non-study Health Care Practitioners in the past 4 weeks for routine/general health visits including any diagnostic or therapeutic 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1

procedures that were performed.  The responses will be recorded on the HCRU by the Site 
Staff.  Health care resource use related to an Adverse Event or Serious Adverse Event will be captured as part of the Adverse Event, independent of the HCRU, and recorded in the eCRF.
Phone Contact During Follow-Up Period
During the Follow-Up Period at Follow-Up Months 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 11, Site Staff will 
telephone subjects to assess ongoing adverse events, concomitant medications, provide contraception counseling and obtain the result of the subject-administered urine pregnancy test.  Site staff will also assess return to full menses and administration of the Post-Treatment UBQ as applicable.  The phone call and pregnancy test result will be documented in source documents and eCRF.
Randomization and Assignment of Subject Numbers
The site will contact IRT to assign the subject to the Extension Study once the subject has 
signed the informed consent and meets all eligibility criteria for the Extension Study.  Only subjects randomized to placebo in the Pivotal Study will be randomized at Day 1 by IRT to receive either elagolix 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA QD.
The same subject number assigned in the Pivotal Study will be used to identify the subject 
throughout the Extension Study.  The site will regi ster the Day 1 Visit in IRT to dispense 
the first study drug kit for the Extension Study.
During the Treatment Period, sites will register each monthly visit in IRT in order to 
obtain a scheduled re-supply of study drug to dispense to each subject.  In the event study drug becomes lost or damaged, the site can contact IRT to obtain an unscheduled re-supply of study drug kit numbers to dispense.  Sites will register subjects as "Completed" 
or "Discontinued" (if the subject prematurely discontinues) at the end of the Treatment Period and will also register Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 6 and Month 12 Visits or Premature Discontinuation from Post-Treatment, if applicable.

5.3.8 Independent Data Monitoring Committee
An Independent Data Monitoring Co mmit tee (IDMC) will be employed for this Phase 3 
study and will have the usual responsibilitie s for safeguarding the interests of study 
participants and monitoring the overall study conduct.  The IDMC will provide 
recommendations about continuing, modifying, or stopping the trial for safety reasons.  The IDMC membership and responsibilities will be documented in its charter.  After each IDMC meeting, the IDMC will communicate its recommendations to the sponsor, as 
described in the IDMC charter.
5.4 Removal of Subjects from Therapy or Assessment
Each subject has the right to withdraw from th e study at any time.  In addition, the 
Investigator may discontinue a subject from the study at any time if the Investigator 
considers it necessary for any reason, including the occurrence of an adverse event or noncompliance with the protoc ol.  Subjects who withdraw from the study will not be 
replaced.  Each subject will be withdrawn from the study if any of the following occur:
●The subject decides to withdraw consent for any reason.
●The investigator believes it is in the best interest of the subject.
●Clinically significant deterioration of the subject's medical status as 
determined by the investigator.
●The subject requires surgical intervention for treatment of uterine fibroids and menstrual bleeding or other procedures including hysterectomy, myomectomy, 
uterine artery embolization, high inten sity focused ultrasound (HIFU), 
endometrial ablation, dilation and curettage (D&C), etc. during the Treatment 
Period.  In the post treatment period these procedures do not warrant 
withdrawal if performed during the Post-Treatment Period unless a 
hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo -oophorectomy  (BSO) is performed and 
the Subject does not plan to use Hormone Replacement Therapy within 
1 month of the surgery date.
●The subject becomes pregnant.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
87
●The subject has ALT or AST elevation > 5 times the upper limit of normal 
confirmed upon repeat during the Treatment Period.
●The subject's legally acceptable representative decides to withdraw consent for any reason (when applicable).
●Heavy menstrual bleeding during the Treatment Period that requires a blood 
transfusion at any time after having taken 28 days of study drug.  If a subject 
has a blood transfusion during the Post-Treatment Period, the AbbVie TA MD 
should be contacted to determine if th e subject can remain in the study.
●Any other medical reason that AbbVie or the study investigator deems appropriate.
5.4.1 Discontinuation of Individual Subjects
In the event that a subject withdraws or is prematurely discontinued from study drug 
treatment, the subject should complete the Treatment Period Premature Discontinuation Visit as soon as possible (preferably within 2 days of last dose of study drug, if possible) and undergo study procedures as outlined in Appendix C , Study Activities.  Subjects who 
prematurely discontinue during the Treatment Period are expected to enter the 12-Month Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, unless discontinui ng due to pregnancy.  Each 
subsequent monthly Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period Visit s hould be scheduled based 
on the date of the last dose of study drug.
In the event that a subject withdraws or is prematurely discontinued during the Post-
Treatment Follow-Up Period, the subject should complete the Post-Treatment Premature Discontinuation Visit as soon as possible and undergo study procedures as outlined in Appendix C , Study Activities.  These procedures should not interfere with the initiation of 
any new treatments or therapeutic modalities the Investigator determines are necessary to treat the subject's condition.  The reason(s) for the discontinuation from the study will be recorded in the eCRFs.
All used and unused study drug containers will be returned to the study site.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
88
If a subject becomes pregnant during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up 
Periods, no additional study procedures, except an ultrasound will be conducted.  Refer to Section 6.1.6 for instructions on reporting of a pregnancy to the Sponsor and the required 
follow-up on the subject/fetus and live births.
If a subject is discontinued from the study with an ongoing adverse event or an unresolved 
laboratory result that is clinically significant (as determined by the Investigator), the Investigator will attempt to provide follow-up until a satisfactory clinical resolution of the laboratory result or adverse event is achieved.
5.4.2 Discontinuation of Entire Study
AbbVie may terminate this study prematurely, either  in its entirety or at any study site, for 
reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination.  The Investigator may also terminate the study at his/her site for reasonable cause, after providing written notice to AbbVie in advance of the intended termination.  Advance notice is not required by either party if the study is stopped due to safety concerns.  If AbbVie terminates the study for safety reasons, AbbVie will immediately notify the investigator by telephone and subsequently provide written instructions for study termination.
The following procedures for study discontinuation will be followed:
●If the Sponsor has decided to prematurely discontinue the study, the Sponsor 
will promptly notify in writing the Investigator as well as regulatory authorities of the decision and give detailed reasons for the discontinuation.
●The Investigator must promptly notify the IRB/IEC and give detailed reasons 
for the discontinuation.
●The Investigator must promptly notify the enrolled subjects of the premature discontinuation and administer appropriate treatments such as replacement of 
the treatment regimen, if applicable, by other appropriate regimens.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
89
5.4.3 Treatment Interruption
AbbVie or the Investigator may request that a subject temporarily discontinue study drug 
administration, which will be referred to as "treatment interruption."  The following are examples for reasons when the AbbVie TA MD must be notified in order to assess whether a subject should undergo temporary treatment interruption:
●Adverse event, that based on clinical judgment, requires temporary suspension 
of treatment or prevents a subject from taking study drug
●Due to malfunction of barrier contraception or unprotected intercourse
Additionally, there may be times when a subject has had treatment interruption due to 
having forgotten to take study drug, lost study drug, etc.  If the subject has missed 7 or more consecutive days of dosing (with either ABT-620 or elagolix plus E2/NETA), the AbbVie TA MD must be consulted to determine whether the subject may resume study drug administration or continue in the Treatment Period.  
These examples are not all-inclusive; if the Investigator has any questions, these should be 
directed to the AbbVie TA MD.
5.5 Treatments
5.5.1 Treatments Administered
Subjects on active treatment in the Pivotal Studies will be assigned by IRT to receive the 
same treatment, either elagolix 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) QD, for an additional 6 months in the Extension Study.  Subjects on placebo in the Pivotal Studies will be randomly assigned by 
IRT to receive elagolix 300 mg BID or elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA (estradiol 1 mg/norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) QD in a 1:1 ratio for a total of 6 months of treatment.  The treatment administration is presented in Table 4 below.

A 1-month supply of each study drug (plus 1 w eek extra) will be dispensed at Day 1 and 
at the Month 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Visits.Study drug will be taken orally twice daily for the entire 6-Month Treatment Period.  A 
morning dose of 1 tablet of elagolix and 1 capsule of (E2/NETA) or matching placebo and 
an evening dose of 1 tablet of (elagolix) should be taken each day approximately 12 hours apart.  Study drug should be taken with approximately 8 oz. (240 mL) of water without regard to food.  Study drug should be taken at approximately the same time each morning 
and evening in order to promote compliance.
If the subject forgets to take the morning dose, she should be instructed to take the 
morning dose as soon as possible and take the evening dose as scheduled.  If the subject forgets to take the evening dose, she should be instructed to take the evening dose as soon as possible; if the subject misses the evening dose completely (until the next morning), the subject should only take the morning dose.

On days when the subject visits the study site for the scheduled visits, she will take her 
morning dose at home, prior to the visit.  The evening dose will be taken from the newly dispensed supply of study drug.  Subjects must return all study drug containers at each 
monthly visit.
When during the Treatment Period, a monthly visit occurs > 28 days since the last visit, 
the subject will be instructed to continue taking study drug from the extra blister card (1 week supply) until she returns for the next month's visit.

AbbVie will supply study drug in monthly kits (i .e., cartons).  Two kits of study drug will 
be provided at each dispensing visit.  One kit consists of elagolix and the other kit consists 
of E2/NETA capsules or matching placebo capsules.  Each kit contains 5 blister cards, with each blister card containing 7 days of study drug.  There are 4 weekly blister cards and 1 extra medication blister card in each kit to supply enough medication for 4 weeks (28 days) plus an extra week of dosing.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
92
Each individual elagolix blister card contains 14 tablets for a 7-day (weekly) supply of 
study drug.  Also, each E2/NETA or matching placebo blister card contains 7 capsules for 
a 7-day (weekly) supply of study drug.  Each  kit will contain a unique kit number.
The kits will be assigned to a subject via IRT and will encode the appropriate study drug to be dispensed at the subject's corresponding study visit.
The kits and blister cards are labeled as per country requirements.  All blank spaces on the 
label will be completed by the site staff prior to dispensing to the subject.  Labels must remain affixed to the study drug containers.  Adequate supplies of study drug will be provided to each study site  automatically via IRT.
5.5.2.2 Storage and Disposition of Study Drugs
Elagolix and E2/NETA or matching placebo study drug must be stored at controlled room 
temperature 15° to 25°C (59° to 77°F).  Additionally, E2/NETA or matching placebo study drug must be protected from light.
The investigational products are for investigational use only and are to be used only within the context of this study.  The study drug supplied for this study must be maintained under adequate security and stored under the conditions specified on the label until dispensed for subject's use or returned to AbbVie.  Returned study drug should notbe re-dispensed to the subject.
5.5.3 Method of Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups
Before the study is initiated, contact information and user guidelines for IRT will be 
provided to each site.  Study drug will be di spensed at the study visits outlined in 
Appendix C , Study Activities.
Subjects will retain the unique subject number assigned to each subject by the IRT during the Pivotal Study M12-815 or Study M12-817.  This unique subject number will be used for each subject throughout this study.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
93
Subjects who received placebo in the Pivotal Study M12-815 or Study M12-817 will be 
randomly assigned to receive elagolix alone or elagolix plus E2/NETA via assignment of a unique randomization number in IRT.  The S ite Personnel, Investigator, and the Sponsor 
do not see this information while the study is ongoing.  Hence, there is no unblinding concern related to the assignment of the unique randomization number in this Extension Study.  Subjects who received elagolix alone or elagolix plus E2/NETA in the Pivotal Study M12-815 or Study M12-817 will continue  to receive the same dose of active drug 
in this study.
The random ization schedule will be computer-generated by the Statistics Department at 
AbbVie, North Chicago, IL prior to the start of the study.  A copy of all of the 
randomization schedules w ill be kept by the Statistics Department at AbbVie and a copy 
will be forwarded to the IRT provider.
Study drug must not be dispensed without contacting IRT and may only be dispensed to 
subjects enrolled in the study according to kit numbers provided by IRT.
5.5.4 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Subject
Selection of the doses used for this study is discussed in Section 5.6.4 .  Subjects who 
received placebo in their respective Pivotal Study will be randomized into one of the 
two treatment groups as described in Section 5.5.1 .  Subjects who received active 
treatment in their respective Pivotal Study will continue to be assigned to receive the same treatment they received during the pivotal study.
Study drug will be initiated at the study site on Day 1.  Subjects will be instructed to self-
administer study drug twice a day (once in the morning and once in the evening approximately 12 hours apart) with approximately 8 oz (240 mL) of water.  Subjects must return all study drug containers (used or unused) at the subsequent visit.

5.5.5 Blinding of Investigational Product
The elagolix dose will be provided open label and each active E2/NETA dose will be 
identical in appearance to its m atched placebo.  The study site personnel and subject will 
remain blinded to each subject's treatment throughout the course of the study.  The IRT will provide access to blinded subject treatment information during the study.
AbbVie must be notified before the blind is broken, unless identification of the study drug 
is required for medical emergency; i.e., situation in which the knowledge of the specific 
blinded treatment will affect the immediate management of the subject/patient's conditions (e.g., antidote is available).  AbbVie must then be notified within 24 hours of 
the blind being broken.  The date and reason that the blind was broken must be recorded in the source documents and eCRF, as applicable.  AbbVie will remain blinded until the database of the 6-month Treatment Period is locked.
5.5.6 Treatment Compliance
Subjects will be instructed to return all study drug kits (used or unused) to the study site 
personnel at the Month 1, Month 2, Month 3, Month 4, Month 5 and Month 6 or Premature Discontinuation Visits during the Treatment Period.  The study site personnel will document compliance in the IRT system.
The Investigator or his/her designated and qualified representatives will dispense study 
drug only to subjects enrolled in the study in  accordance with  the protocol.  The study 
drug must not be used for reasons other than those described in the protocol.
Subjects should be advised of the importance of treatment compliance.  Study drug should 
be taken consistently at approximately the same time in the morning and evening each day.  Daily recordings of study drug dosing will be obtained using a compliance 
packaging blister card for all subjects (for both elagolix and E2/NETA/matching placebo).  AbbVie will provide training and study drug compliance materials  to sites for instructing 
subjects on study drug compliance.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
95
Sites will be provided scanning technology for direct access to the dosing compliance 
data; sites are expected to scan all returned blister cards (used/unused/unopened) to obtain the dosing information at each of the Treatment Pe riod Visits when st udy drug is returned 
to the site by the subject.  Any unused/unopened blister cards should be documented as such in the scanning technology source documen tation.  Sites are expected to use the 
compliance data to guide them in discussi ons with the subject regarding compliance.  
Upon reviewing the dosing data, if the date(s) and time(s) for any of the last 4 doses of study drug (elagolix or E2/NETA or matching placebo) prior to the monthly Treatment 
Period Visit or Premature Discontinuation Vis it are missing, the subject will be asked to 
confirm whether doses were taken and to provide the dates and approximate times of the last 4 scheduled doses prior to the study visit.  The subject reported data will be recorded in source and in the eCRF.  Sites will document when the blister cards are not returned or when blister cards cannot be scanned.
Sites should instruct subjects not to remove extra or multiple medications from the blister 
cards all at once and should only remove the study drug from the blister when it is the time to take the dose.  If the compliance data shows incidence of removing a number of extra medications, sites should re-train the subjects on the importance of only removing study drug when it is time to take the dose and record re-training in the source documents.
During review of the study drug compliance with the study subject, if the number of tablets/capsules to be taken and the number of tablets/capsules returned do not add up to the number of tablets/capsules dispensed, an  explanation should be provided by the 
subject and recorded in the source documents.
If a subject missed more than 7 consecutive days of taking study drug, the AbbVie TA 
MD should be notified to determine whether the subject may continue.
Compliance packaging data will be used for exposure response analysis.

5.5.7 Drug Accountability
The study Investigator or designee will verify by signature and date that study drug 
supplies are received intact and in the correct amounts indicated on the shipping document Proof of Receipt or similar shipping document or via direct recording in IRT.  The shipment receipt must be acknowledged in IRT in order to become available for dispensation to subjects.  The IRT must also be contacted when any subject discontinues study drug.
The IRT will maintain a current and accurate inventory of all clinical drug supplies, 
accountability, reconciliation, returns and destruction for each site.  The IRT will also include the lot number, kit number, Proof of Receipt number, the number of blister cards/cartons dispensed, initials of person who dispensed the drug, and the date study drug was dispensed for each subject.  In addition to using IRT inventory, an accurate inventory of study drug can also be kept by the site.
An overall accountability of the study drug will be performed and verified by the site 
monitor via IRT throughout the study and at the Study Site Closeout Visit.  Throughout the study and upon completion or termination of the study, all used and unused containers 
will be returned to AbbVie according to instructions from AbbVie.
The study Investigator or his/her designated representative agrees not to supply study drug 
to any persons not enrolled in the study or not named as a Sub-Investigator.
Study drug will be dispensed at the study visits summarized in Appendix C , Study 
Activities.  Returned study drug should not be re-dispensed to the subject.
5.6 Discussion and Justification of Study Design
5.6.1 Discussion of Study Design and Choice of Control Groups
This Phase 3 extension study will be conduc ted as a double-blind, multi-center, study in 
premenopausal women with HMB associated with uterine fibroids.  This study will 
continue to evaluate the safety and efficacy of elagolix 300 mg BID alone and elagolix 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
97
300 mg BID in combination with E2/NETA QD (1 mg/0.5 mg).  The elagolix alone arm 
in this extension study is b eing used as a reference arm in order to better understand the 
effects of add-back therapy on safety and efficacy parameters.  This allows a benchmark for efficacy, as well as safety in regards to BMD and hypoestrogenic effects.  In addition, 
for a long term treatment, this  will allow a better understanding of elagolix alone, as well 
as activella.
5.6.2 Appropriateness of Measurements
The safety assessments used in this study are standard, widely used and generally 
recognized as reliable, accurate and relevant within the context of this study design.
Heavy menstrual bleeding is the most common symptom of women with uterine fibroids.  
The quantitation of menstrual blood loss using the alkaline hematin method on sanitary 
products has been validated by the analytical  testing laboratory.  Pelvic ultrasound is a 
standard method for assessing uterine fibroid size, and fibroid and uterine volume.  Endometrial biopsy is a standard method for assessing endometrial safety.  DXA is the 
established gold standard method to assess changes in BMD.
5.6.3 Suitability of Subject Population
Premenopausal women with HMB (> 80 mL per menstrual cycle) and uterine fibroids 
were selected for this study because th at is the population who suffer from HMB 
associated with uterine fibro ids.  No studies in males or in females outside of the 
reproductive years are necessary for this proposed indication.
5.6.4 Selection of Doses in the Study
This is an extension study to the pivotal studies, Studies M12-815 and M12-817, therefore 
the doses used in this extension study are the same as those used in the pivotal Studies 
with the exception that subjects randomized to placebo in their respective pivotal study 
will be re-randomized to active treatment, either elagolix 300 mg BID alone or elagolix 300 mg BID in combination with E2/NETA QD in  a 1:1 ratio, therefore all subjects in this 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
98
extension study will receive active treatment.  The maximum elagolix dose administered 
in this study will not exceed  a total daily dose of 600 mg.
6.0 Complaints
A Complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges deficiencies related to the physical characteristics, identity, quality, purity, potency, durability, 
reliability, safety, effectiveness, or performan ce of a product/device after it is released for 
distribution.
Complaints associ ated with any component  of this investigational product must be 
reported to the Sponsor (Section 6.2.2 ).  For adverse events, please refer to Section 6.1
through Section 6.1.5 .  For product complaints, please refer to Section 6.2.
All adverse events will be followed to a satisfactory conclusion.
6.1 Medical Complaints
The Investigator will monitor each subject for clinical and laboratory evidence of adverse 
events on a routine basis throughout the study.  The Investigator will assess and record any adverse event in detail including the date of onset, event diagnosis (if known) or sign/symptom, severity, time course (end date, ongoing, intermittent), relationship of the adverse event to study drug, and any action(s) taken.  For serious adverse events considered as having "no reasonable possibility" of being associated with study drug, the Investigator will provide an Other cause of the event.  For adverse events to be considered intermittent, the events must be of similar nat ure and severity.  Adverse events, whether in 
response to a query, observed by site personnel, or reported spontaneously by the subject will be recorded.

6.1.1 Definitions
6.1.1.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (AE) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or 
clinical investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this  treatment.  An adverse event can therefore 
be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not the event is considered causally related to the use of the product.
Such an event can result from use of the drug as stipulated in the protocol or labeling, as 
well as from accidental or intentional ove rdose, drug abuse, or drug withdrawal.  Any 
worsening of a pre-existing condition or illn ess is considered an adverse event.  
Worsening in severity of a reported adverse event should be reported as a new adverse event.  Laboratory abnormalities, and vital signs are considered to be adverse events only if they result in discontinuation from the study, necessitate therapeutic medical intervention and/or if the investigator considers them to be adverse events.
An adverse event of amenorrhea will be reported for subjects who do not return to menses 
by the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Month 2 Phone Visit and the adverse event will be followed until resolution.  The onset date of the adverse event will be the date of the Follow-Up Month 2 Visit.
A BMD decrease at any anatomic lo cation (spine, to tal hip or femoral neck) during the 
Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period that leads to discontinuation from study 
or a BMD decrease at any anatomic lo cation with a T-score < – 1.5 should be reported as 
an adverse event.
An elective surgery/procedure scheduled to occur during a study will not be considered an 
adverse event if the surgery/procedure is b eing performed for a pre-existing condition and 
the surgery/procedure has been pre planned prior to study entry.  However, if the pre-existing condition deteriorates unexpectedly  during the study (e.g., surgery performed 
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
100
earlier than planned), then the deterioration of the condition for which the elective 
surgery/procedure is being done will be considered an adverse event.
6.1.1.2 Serious Adverse Events
If an adverse event meets any of the following criteria, it is to be reported to AbbVie as a 
serious adverse event (SAE) within 24 hours of the site being made aware of the serious adverse event.
Death of Subject An event that results in the death of a subject.
Life-Threatening An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have 
resulted in immediate fatality if medical intervention had not 
been taken.  This does not include an event that would have 
been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.
Hospitalization or 
Prolongation of 
HospitalizationAn event that results in an admission to the hospital for any 
length of time or prolongs the subject's hospital stay.  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an 
outpatient facility.
Congenital Anomaly An anomaly detected at or after birth, or any anomaly that 
results in fetal loss.
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/IncapacityAn event that results in a condition that substantially 
interferes with the activities of daily living of a study subject.  
Disability is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, 
vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma 
(e.g., sprained ankle).
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
101
Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
OutcomeAn important medical event that may not be immediately 
life-threatening or result in death or hospitalization, but 
based on medical judgment may jeopardize the subject and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent any 
of the outcomes listed above (i.e., death of subject, life-
threatening, hospitalization, prolonga tion of hospitalization, 
congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant 
disability/incapacity).  Additionally, any elective or 
spontaneous abortion or stillbirth is considered an important medical event.  Examples of such events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency 
room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse.
For serious adverse events with the outcome of death, the date and cause of death will be 
recorded on the appropriate case report form.
6.1.1.3 Adverse Events of Special Interest
Some adverse events, such as adverse events of special interest (AESI), such as 
rash/hypersensitivity, fracture, neuro-p sychiatric (de pression, mood swings, etc.), 
vasomotor symptoms (hot flush, night sweats) or serious adverse events.  AbbVie may require additional information, including family  history, to be collected and recorded in 
the eCRF.
6.1.2 Adverse Event Severity
The Investigator will use the following definitions to rate the severity of each adverse 
event:
Mild The adverse event is transient and easily tolerated by the subject.
Moderate The adverse event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the 
subject's usual activities.
Severe The adverse event causes considerable interference with the subject's usual activities and may be incapacitating or life-threatening.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
102
6.1.3 Relationship to Study Drug
The investigator will use the following definitions to assess the relationship of the adverse 
event to the use of study drug:
Reasonable 
PossibilityAn adverse event where there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
No Reasonable PossibilityAn adverse event where there is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the adverse event.
For causality assessments, events assessed as having a reasonable possibility of being 
related to the study drug will be considered "associated."  Events assessed as having no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug will be considered "not associated."  In addition, when the investigator has not re ported a causalit y or deemed it not assessable, 
AbbVie will consider the event associated.
If an investigator's opinion of no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug is 
given, an "Other" cause of event must be provided by the investigator for the serious 
adverse event.
6.1.4 Adverse Event Collection Period
All adverse events reported from the time of study drug administration through Month 12 
in the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period, (if applicable) will be collected, whether solicited or spontaneously reported by the subject.  In addition, serious adverse events and protocol-related nonserious adverse events will be collected from the time the subject signed the study-specific informed consent.
If a subject prematurely discontinues from the study, i.e., either prematurely discontinues 
from Treatment Period and does not enter the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period or prematurely discontinues from the Post-Tr eatment Follow-Up Period, adverse events and 
serious adverse events will be collected up to 30 days after the last dose of study drug.
Adverse event information will be collected as shown in Figure 5 .

6.1.6 Pregnancy
Pregnancy in a study subject must be reported to AbbVie within 1 working day of the site 
becoming aware of the pregnancy.  Subjects who become pregnant during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods of the study must be discontinued (Section 5.4and 
Section 5.4.1 ).  A positive urine pregnancy test result must be confirmed with a serum 
pregnancy test.  If a serum pregnancy test result is positive at any time during the Treatment Period of the study, the site will immediately inform the subject to discontinue 
study drug.  Information regarding a pregnancy occurrence in a study subject and the outcome of the pregnancy will be collected for any study subject with a positive serum pregnancy test from the signing of the informed consent through the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period.  The site will report a positive pregnancy test to the Sponsor, will 
follow the course of the subject's pregnancy, and report to the Sponsor on the health of the subject and fetus at each trimester and at the first post-delivery pediatrician visit.
If the subject becomes pregnant during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up 
Periods of the study, an ultrasound examinatio n will be performed as early as possible 
during the first trimester of pregnancy to assess the conception date and document an intrauterine pregnancy.  The following information on the outcome of the pregnancy that occurred after signing of the informed consent, regardless of when the subject became pregnant (i.e., either during the Treatment or Post-Treatment Follow-Up Periods) should 
be collected: fetal outcome (e.g., spontaneous or elective abortion, live infant or still birth), date of delivery, birth weight, birth length, gender, birth defects, congenital anomaly and medically significant complications during pregnancy or labor or delivery.  For live infant births, information on the health of the infant will be collected 6 to 12 months after delivery.
Pregnancy in a study subject is not considered an adverse event.  However, the medical 
outcome of an elective or spontaneous abortion, stillbirth or congenital anomaly is considered a serious adverse event and must be reported to AbbVie within 24 hours of the site becoming aware of the event.

8.1.7 Efficacy
Data will be summarized separately for each of the treatment groups of subjects described 
in Section 8.1.1 .
8.1.7.1 Primary Efficacy Variable
8.1.7.1.1 Primary Analysis
The primary endpoint will be the percentage of subjects meeting a composite endpoint 
consisting of two bleeding assessments:
●Menstrual blood loss (MBL) volume < 80 mL during the Final Month (the last 
28 days of treatment in the Extension Study), and
●50% or greater reduction in MBL volume from baseline to the Final Month 
(the last 28 days of treatment in the Extension Study).
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
111
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed using the full analysis set 
which is comprised of all subjects who took at least one dose of the study drug in this Extension Study.
A subject who prematurely discontinues the study drug due to adverse events, "lack of 
efficacy," or "requires surgery or invasive in tervention for treatment of uterine fibroids" 
will be considered as a non-responder regardless whether she meets the two aforementioned responder criteria or not.
The baseline MBL volume is described in Section 8.1.5 .  The Final Month is defined as 
the last 28 days of treatment prior to and including the last dose date in this Extension 
Study.
The MBL volume used for the primary and sens itivity analyses is defined as the total 
combined volume of blood ascertained via the AH method from all used (validated and 
non-validated) sanitary products that a subject returns.  In case a subject does not return any used sanitary products and indicates on the UBQ that she experienced bleeding during the Final Month, the MBL volume will be imputed per the procedure described in Section 8.1.7.1.2 .
The percentage of subjects with MBL volume < 80 mL at the Final Month and 50% or greater reduction in MBL volume from baseline to the Final Month in the Extension 
Study will be summarized by treatment group.
8.1.7.1.2 Derivation of Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The Final Month MBL volume will be derived as follows:
●If a subject has any evaluable AH data reported during the Final Month 
(i.e., she has at least 1 day of AH data during the last 28 days of treatment), then her primary endpoint w ill be based on AH d ata during the Final Month.  
The subject's Final Month MBL volume will be the total MBL volume which is the sum of the observed MBL volu me over the last 28 days of treatment.
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
112
●If a subject is missing the Final Month AH data and the Uterine Bleeding 
Questionnaire is completed, then:
○A value of 0 will be assigned to the Final Month MBL volume if no 
bleeding or spotting, "Subject only had spotting that did not require the use 
of sanitary products" or "There was no visible blood on the sanitary products" is indicated on the Uterine Bleeding Questionnaire 
(Appendix D ).
●Otherwise, the primary endpoint will be imputed using multiple imputation as 
described in Section 8.1.7.1.3 .
A flow-chart showing how the primary endpoint will be derived is presented in Figure 6 .

MBL volume, treatment group, and 28-day MBL volume at each post-baseline treatment cycle.  The final imputation model will be specified in the SAP.
First, M"semi-complete" datasets will be imputed to produce monotone missing data via 
MCMC using SAS PROC MI.  Then, M"complete" datasets for the Final Month MBL 
volume will be generated based on each "semi-complete" dataset via linear regression 
using SAS PROC MI.  Mrepresents the number of imputed datasets and its value will be 
specified in the SAP.
Each subject's responder status will be derived based on the imputed Final Month MBL 
volume from the Mimputed datasets.  The percentage of responders will be summarized 
by treatment group.
8.1.7.1.4 Sensitivity Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Variable
The sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint will use different approaches for 
handling prematurely discontinued subjects and different approaches for dealing with missing Final Month MBL volume.  The details of the sensitivity analyses will be specified in the SAP.
Unless otherwise specified, the analysis dataset used for sensitivity analysis is the full 
analysis set.

8.1.8 Safety
All subjects who took at least one dose of the study drug in the Extension Study will be 
included in the safety analyses.
8.1.8.1 General Considerations
Unless otherwise specified, missing safety data will not be imputed.
Data will be summarized separately for each of the treatment groups of subjects described 
in Section 8.1.1 .
8.1.8.2 Adverse Events
Adverse events (AEs) will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) dictionary.  Treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) w ill be 
summarized for each treatment group.  TEAEs are defined as AEs with a start date on or after the first dose of the study drug and within 30 days of the last dose of the study drug in the Extension Study.  AEs starting more th an 30 days following discontinuation of the 
study drug will not be included in the summaries of TEAEs.  AEs starting more than 30 days following discontinuation of the study drug will be summarized separately as Post-Treatment AEs.
When summarizing TEAEs by relationship or severity, if a subject has an event with 
unknown severity or relationship, then the subject will be counted in the severity/relationship category of "unknown," even if the subject has a second occurrence of the same event with a severity/relationship present.  The only exception is if the subject 
has a second occurrence of the same event with the most extreme severity (i.e., "severe") 
or a relationship category of "reasonable possib ility."  In this case, the subject will be 
counted under these most extreme severity/relationship categories.
The frequencies and percentages of subjects with TEAEs will be calculated for each 
treatment group as follows:
Elagolix (ABT-620)
M12-816 Protocol Amendment 1
118
●Any event
●By system organ class, and preferred term
●By system organ class, preferred term and maximum relationship

E2/NETA QD in the Pivotal Studies M12-815 and M12-817, the BMD data from the 
Pivotal Studies will be included in the analysis, and baseline for these subjects will refer to the baseline from the Pivotal Studies M12-815 or M12-817.
For subjects who have at least 12 months of total exposure to elagolix, the percent change 
from baseline to Month 6 in the Extension Study in BMD will be compared between elagolix dose groups (elagolix 300 mg BID ve rsus elagolix 300 mg BID plus E2/NETA 
QD) using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with treatment as the main effect and baseline BMD as a covariate.  A two-sided 95% confidence interval will be constructed for the between-group difference in percent change from baseline to Month 6 in the Extension Study in BMD.  Additionally, the mixed model repeated measures (MMRM) method for analyzing percent change in BMD will be conducted as appropriate.

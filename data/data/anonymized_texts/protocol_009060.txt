POPULATION: 
The population for this study includes men and women 18 to 70 y ears of age, inclusive, with a 
body mass index <40 kg/m2 and mild dyslipidemia defined a s fasting LDL-C levels >2.5 mmo l/L 
(>100 mg/dL) and <4.5 mmol/L (<1 75 mg/dL) and TG levels <4.5 mm ol/L (<400 mg/dL).  
STUDY DESIGN AND DURATION: This study will be a placebo-controlled, double-
blind, randomized Phase 2 study in participants 
with mild dyslipidemia to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and to lerability of obicetrapib and 
ezetimibe combination therapy. The study will take place at app roximately 10 to 15 sites in North 
America and Europe as appropriate. Screening Period 
At the Screening Visit (Visit 1), participants will be required  to sign an informed consent form 
(ICF) before any study-related procedures are performed. After signing the ICF, participants will 
be assessed for study eligibility. Participants will also recei ve counselling regarding the 
Therapeutic Lifestyle Changes di et and will receive instruction s on how to follow this diet. 
Participants will be required to be gin the diet starting at the  Screening Visit.  
Treatment Period 
Up to 2 weeks after the Screening Visit, participants will retu rn to the site on Day 1 (Visit 2) to be 
randomized and begin treatment. Ap proximately 100 eligible participants (25 participants per 
treatment group) will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the following treatment groups: 
 Combination therapy: 5 mg obicetrapib + 10 mg ezetimibe; 
 Obicetrapib monotherapy: 5 mg obi cetrapib + placebo ezetimibe;  
 Ezetimibe monotherapy: placebo obicetrapib + 10 mg ezetimibe; o r 
 Placebo: placebo obicetrapib + placebo ezetimibe. 
During the 8-week Treatment Period, the assigned study drugs wi ll be administered by the 
participant orally and once daily on Days 1 through 57. Participants will return to the site every 
4 weeks for efficacy, safety, PK , and CETP mass assessments. Pa rticipants, Investigators, the 
Clinical Research Organization, and the Sponsor will be blinded to all lipid results from Day 1 
(Visit 2) for the first participant through the PK Visit (Visit  6) for the last participant in order to 
protect blinding to tre atment assignment.

 Pairwise comparisons among the various treatment groups for the proportion of participants 
at Day 57 that achieve LDL-C <2.6 mmol/L (<100 mg/dL), LDL-C <1.8 mmol/L
(<70 mg/dL), and LDL-C < 1.3 mmol/L (<50 mg/dL); 
 Pairwise comparisons among the various treatment groups for the  change from Day 1 to 
Day 57, Day 1 to Week 12, and Day 1 to Week 16 in the mean trou gh plasma levels o f 
obicetrapib; and 
 Pairwise comparisons among the various treatment groups for the  change from Day 1 to 
Day 57, Day 1 to Week 12, and Day 1 to Week 16 in CETP mass. 
SAFETY VARIABLES: 
The safety and tolerability profiles of obicetrapib alone, ezet imibe alone, and obicetrapib in 
combination with ezetimibe will be assessed by clinical laborat ory values and the incidence o f 
AEs. 
STATISTICAL ANALYSES: All study-collected data will be summarized  by treatment group using descriptive statistics, 
graphs, and/or raw data listings . Descriptive statistics for co ntinuous variables will include number 
of participants (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, min imum, and maximum values. 
Analysis of categorical variabl es will include  frequency and pe rcentage. 
Analysis Populations 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Popula tion will include all participa nts randomized into the study. 
Treatment classification will be  based on the randomized treatment.  
The Modified ITT (mITT) Population will include all participant s in the ITT Population who 
receive at least 1 dose of any study drug and have a baseline v alue for the LDL-C assessment. Any 
efficacy measurement obtained af ter a participant receives a re stricted lipid-altering therapy, 
outside of the current study design, will be removed from the m ITT analysis. Treatment 
classification will be based on the randomized treatment. The m ITT Population will be used for 
the primary analysis of  all efficacy endpoints. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all participants in the mITT Population who have 
a baseline value for the LDL-C assessment, have a Day 57 value for the LDL-C assessment, and 
who did not experience a major pr otocol deviation that potentia lly impacted the primary efficacy 
endpoint. The PP Population, along with the reason for exclusio n, will be finalized prior to study 
unblinding. The PK Population will include all participants in the mITT Pop ulation who have sufficient blood 
samples collected for valid e stimation of PK  parameters.

Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-303 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 8 of 55 
Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 The Safety Population will includ e all participants who receive  at least 1 dose of any study drug. 
Treatment classification will be based on the actual treatment received. The Safety  Population will 
be the primary population used f or the safety analyses. 
Analysis of Efficacy 
The mITT Population will be the primary population for the effi cacy analyses. Efficacy will also 
be analyzed using the ITT Popul ation and the PP Population as supportive analyses.  
The primary efficacy analysis of the percent change from Day 1 to Day 57 in LDL-C will be 
performed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) appr oach. The analysis will 
include fixed effects for treatment, visit, and treatment-by-vi sit interaction, al ong with a covariate 
of the baseline value. The Res tricted Maximum Likelihood estima tion approach will be used with 
an unstructured covariance matrix . The least squares means, sta ndard errors, and 2-sided 
95% confidence intervals for each  treatment group, for the pair wise comparisons of the 
combination therapy, obicetrapib monotherapy, and ezetimibe mon otherapy to placebo, and for 
the pairwise comparisons of combination therapy and obicetrapib  monotherapy versus ezetimibe 
monotherapy will be provided. The treatment comparison will be performed using a 2-sided test 
at the  = 0.05 level of significance. 
Missing data will be imputed usi ng multiple imputation methodol ogy. Results will be combined 
using Rubin’s method. Full details of the m odel and im putation will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). 
A similar MMRM model will be used for the analysis of the secon dary and exploratory efficacy 
endpoints corresponding to the percent change from baseline. Fo r the binary efficacy endpoints, a 
logistic regression analysis will be performed with model covariates of treatment group and 
baseline LDL-C.  
In order to maintain the overall  Type I error rate, the seconda ry efficacy endpoints will be tested 
sequentially at the 0.05 significance level according to the pre-specified order of hierarchy. No 
adjustment will be made for multiplicity in testing the explora tory efficacy endpoints. Nominal 
p-values will be provided when a pplicable. Descriptive and grap hical summaries by treatment 
group will also be presented. A ny additional sensitivity and/or  supplemental analyses will be 
defined in the SAP. 
Analysis of Safety 
The Safety Population will be the primary population for the sa fety analyses. All safety endpoints 
will be summarized descriptively. No statistical inference will  be applied to the safety endpoints.
Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Plasma obicetrapib concentrations will be summarized with descriptive statistics based on the PK 
Population. Exploration of any re lationships with obicetrapib exposure will be performed, as 
appropriate. 
SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION: 
A sample size of at least 100 eval uable participants (ie, 25 pa rticipants per treatment group) will 
provide >90% power to detect a 30% difference in LDL-C reduction at Day 57 (SD 15%) for the 
combination therapy group compar ed to the placebo group at a 2- sided significance level of 0.05.

Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 The sample size for this study was determined in order to provide sufficient power (>80%) for the analyses of the primary effic acy endpoint and secondary efficac y endpoints described above. The 
sample size calculations used va lues reported from a previous c linical trial involving obicetrapib 
(TA-8995) as a starting point for  the assumptions of the treatm ent difference and standard 
deviation.
1 This sample size will also contribute sufficient participant e xposure and safety data. 
Participants will be stratified according to their Screening Vi sit (Visit 1) LDL-C value 
(<3.5 mmol/L [<135 mg/dL] or 3.5 mmol/L [ 135 mg/dL]).

Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 1 INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND INFORMATION  
Despite advances in treatment, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death 
globally, resulting in over 17 million deaths per year.1 Elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) 
cholesterol (LDL-C) is a major modifiable risk factor for the d evelopment of CVD.2,3 Lowering 
LDL-C has been shown to reduce the risk of death or myocardial infarction, and the clinical risk 
reduction is linearly proportional to the absolute LDL-C reduct ion.4 Approximately 100 million 
people worldwide are treated with  lipid lowering therapies, pre dominantly statins, to reduce 
LDL-C and the associated ris k of cardiovascular events. 
Statins are generally well tolerated, but their u se is limited in a substantial number of patients due 
to various adverse effects, inc luding statin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) and new-onset 
diabetes mellitus (NODM). SAMS c omprise myopathy, myalgia, and the most severe 
manifestation, rhabdomyolysis, which can result in serious comp lications including renal failure. 
However, in most cases, patients experience mild to moderate mu scle pain and weakness. The risk 
of NODM increases with intensive statin therapy, particularly i n patients with prediabetes.5 These 
manifestations, and other adverse events (AEs), may lead to discontinuation of statin therapy. This is commonly referred to  as statin intolerance
5 and may occur in 10% to 15% of patients,6 depriving 
patients of the cardioprotective benefits of statins. In additi on, discontinuation of statin therapy 
can increase the risk of acute cardiovascular events.7 Indeed, it is estimated that 9% of all 
cardiovascular events across th e European Union (EU) are the co nsequence of statin intolerance. 
An alternative to statins is the use of proprotein convertase s ubtilisin/kexin 9 inhibitors. However, 
there are several limitations with this line of therapy, includ ing very high costs. Based on currently 
completed, long-term studies, outc omes are not as successful co mpared to statins, and 
muscle-related events are still reported.5 
Accordingly, there remains an unmet need for therapies to reduc e elevated LDL-C levels and 
cardiovascular risk, at an acceptable cost, and with a more fav orable safety profile to encourage 
long-term use and patient compliance. 
1.1 Cholesteryl Ester Transfer Protein Inhibition 
Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is a plasma glycoprot ein produced in the liver and 
adipose tissue. It circulates in the blood bound primarily to h igh-density lipoprotein (HDL) 
cholesterol (HDL-C) and is invol ved in the transfer of choleste ryl esters and triglycerides (TG) 
between lipoproteins. In particula r, it mediates the transfer o f cholesteryl esters from HDL to the 
apolipoprotein B (ApoB)-containi ng particles, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL-C, 
in exchange for TG. As a result, cholesteryl ester from HDL can  be taken up by the liver through 
scavenger receptor class B type 1; this action also leads to de creased HDL-C levels and ultimately 
to increased LDL-C levels. 
Inhibition of CETP activity reduces LDL-C levels and increases HDL-C levels. These effects are 
not only caused by inhibition of CETP-mediated cholesterol tran sfer from HDL to LDL, but also 
by a decrease in the number of ApoB-containing lipoproteins and  an increase in apolipoprotein A1 
(ApoA1)-containing lipoproteins. The LDL-C lowering effect, which arises from CETP inhibition 
and occurs through upregulation of the LDL-receptor, will benef it patients with elevated LDL-C 
and increased cardiovascular risk. Ference and colleagues have recen tly investigated the associati on between changes in LDL-C 
levels (and other lipoproteins) a nd the risk of cardiovascular events related to variants in the CETP

Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 gene alone and in combination wi th variants in the 3-hydroxy-3- methylglutaryl-Coenzyme A 
reductase (HMGCR) gene.8 The results of these Mendelian randomization analyses demonstr ate 
that treatment with a CETP inhibitor as monotherapy has the pot ential to effectively reduce the 
risk of cardiovascular events. Both genetic and therapeutic inh ibition of CETP leads to 
quantitatively concordant changes in LDL-C and ApoB levels when  considered in the absence of 
HMGCR inhibition. A further Mendelian randomization analysis co ncluded that the clinical 
benefit of lower TG levels was similar to the clinical benefit of lower LDL-C levels per unit 
difference in ApoB and may be rel ated to the absolute reduction  in ApoB-containing lipoprotein 
particles.9 Therefore, treatment with a potent CETP inhibitor without a st atin could lead to large 
absolute reductions in both LDL-C and ApoB, which could in turn  lead to large relative reductions 
in cardiovascular events. Future cardiovascular outcome studies  evaluating CETP inhibitor 
therapy in statin intolerant p atients could test this hypothesis directly.8 This has indeed been 
confirmed in a recent review where it was concluded that CETP i nhibitors could represent a useful 
addition to drugs currently bei ng used to treat high-risk patie nts intolerant to or not adequately 
treated with statins.10 Recently, the Clinical Trial Service Unit, University of Oxfor d, also 
presented that the absolute re duction in major adverse cardiova scular events 2 years after the 
REVEAL study was completed was nearly double (approximately 18% ) compared to that seen at 
the end of the 4-year treatment period with the CETP inhibitor anacetrapib (approximately 9%). 
In addition, between-group differenc es in the risk of coronary death emerged in the later years of 
follow-up; and, importantly, no safety concerns were described for non-vascular mortality or 
morbidity.11 In conclusion, CETP inhibition as monotherapy robustly lowers LDL-C and reduces 
CVD risk in those patients who are intolerant to statins, and the REVEAL study has shown no long-term on-targ et safety issues. 
1.2 Obicetrapib (TA-8995) 
Obicetrapib (TA-8995) has been shown to be a selective CETP inh ibitor. In addition to shuttling 
cholesterol esters from LDL-C to HDL-C particles, obicetrapib h as several additional 
compound-specific activities tha t are hypothesized to be beneficial in patients. Obicetrapib 
treatment has recently been shown to reduce the number of ApoB- containing particles that 
constitute LDL-C. Obicetrapib increases apolipoprotein E, which  leads to removal of cholesterol 
via the liver and also reduces lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)). Finally , obicetrapib not only potently 
increases HDL-C and the number of ApoA1-containing lipoproteins , but has been demonstrated 
to be a potent inducer of choles terol efflux, which is the main  driver of reverse cholesterol 
transport.
12 This effect is considered important because it is expected to reduce established 
atheroma burden. 
1.3 Clinical Development of Obicetrapib 
Both single ascending dose (TA-8995-01) and multiple ascending dose (TA-8995-02) studies have 
been conducted in healthy voluntee rs. A formal thorough QT/QTc study (TA-8995-04) has been 
completed and obicetra pib was shown to hav e no effect on correc ted QT interval by Fridericia. A 
drug-drug interaction study (TA-8995-05) has also been conducte d; this study showed no 
significant effect of obicetrapib  on P-glycoprot ein activity, b ut this study showed  that obicetrapib 
is a mild inducer of cytochrome P450 3A4. A mass balance study in healthy males concluded that 
obicetrapib is steadily absorbed,  and the principal route of ex cretion was in the feces 
(TA-8995-07). Finally, bioequiva lence between obicetrapib capsu le and tablet fo rmulations was 
investigated (TA-8995-08) and established. 
NewAmsterdam Pharma BV 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-303 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 18 of 55 
Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 The first patient study conducted was a Phase 2 clinical study (TA-8995-03) in Denmark and the Netherlands where the aim was to evaluate the optimal dose of o bicetrapib alone and in 
combination with statins in participants with mild dyslipidemia . This study concluded that a daily 
dose of 5 mg obicetrapib resulted i n an LDL-C reduction of 45.3 %, an ApoB reduction of 33.6%, 
an HDL-C increase of 157.1%, an  ApoA1 increase of 57.5%, and a significant increase in HDL-C 
efflux capacity.
13 A second patient study (TA-8995-06) was conducted where the ef fect of 
obicetrapib on Lp(a) was investig ated following 12 weeks of tre atment. There was a statistically 
significant reduction in Lp(a) levels following 12 weeks of tre atment; however, the magnitude of 
the changes (approximately a 10% reduction) was not likely to b e clinically relevant. 
1.4 Rationale for Obicetrapib and Ezetimibe Combination Therapy 
An important therapeutic goal is to maximize LDL-C reduction fo r patients who cannot tolerate 
statin therapy. Ezetimibe selectively inhibits intestinal chole sterol absorption. Ezetimibe used as 
monotherapy for patients with hypercholesterolemia significantl y reduces serum LDL-C levels, 
as evidenced by a meta-analysi s of 8 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies, with 
a statistically significant mean reduction in LDL-C of 18.58% compared with placebo.14 
Ezetimibe in combination with statin therapy further reduces LDL-C levels. A meta-analysis of 
27 studies, including more than 21,000 patients, demonstrated a 15.1% greater reduction in LDL-C 
in patients treated with statin and ezetimibe in combination co mpared with statin alone.15 Although 
there is a lack of evidence that ezetimibe monotherapy reduces cardiovascular events, the 
IMPROVE-IT study,16 in which simvastatin 40 mg daily was compared with a combinati on of 
simvastatin 40 mg plus ezetimibe 10 mg in 18,144 patients with acute coronary syndrome, 
demonstrated a modest but statis tically significant further red uction in future cardiovascular events 
(a 2% absolute risk reduction ove r 7 years) in the combination group compared with statins alone. 
These large long-term studies have also demonstrated an excelle nt safety profile for ezetimibe. 
Importantly, additional Mendelian randomization studies have re vealed that the CETP inhibitor 
HMGCR inhibitor inte raction does not occur when a CETP inhibito r is combined with ezetimibe. 
Accordingly, to evaluate the pot ential for ezetimibe to further  augment LDL-C as well as ApoB 
reduction achieved by a CETP inhibitor, this study will test th e effect of obicetrapib and ezetimibe 
combination therapy compared to obicetrapib monotherapy and eze timibe monotherapy in 
participants with m ild dyslipidemia. 
1.5 Risk/Benefit 
Obicetrapib has undergone extens ive nonclinical testing in the standard battery of tests according 
to International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, in cluding repeat-d ose toxicity 
studies of up to 39 weeks duration. In addition, obicetrapib ha s been investigated in 8 completed 
clinical studies, of which 6 studies were in Phase 1 of clinica l development and 2 studies were in 
Phase 2. A total of approximately 500 subjects have been expose d to obicetrapib in these studies. 
In Phase 1, a total of 159 subjects received single oral doses between 5 and 150 mg of obicetrapib, 
and 76 subjects received consecutive doses between 1 and 25 mg of obicetrapib for periods up to 
28 days. In Phase 2, a total  of 268 patients received 1 to 10 m g of obicetrapib for up to 12 weeks. 
Obicetrapib has been shown to be a selective CETP inhibitor. In  addition to shuttling cholesterol 
esters from LDL-C to HDL-C particles, obicetrapib has several a dditional compound-specific 
activities that are hypothesized t o be beneficial in patients. A dose of 5 mg obicetrapib resulted in 
an LDL-C reduction of 45.3%, an ApoB reduction of 33.6%, an HDL -C increase of 157.1%, an

Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 ApoA1 increase of 57.5%, and a si gnificant increase in HDL-C ef flux capacity.13 This effect is 
considered important because it is expected to reduce establish ed atheroma burden. 
Single doses of obicetrapib up to 150 mg and multiple doses up to 25 mg administered over 28 days were generally well tolerated and safe in these studies. No cli nically significant effects on vital 
sign measurements (systolic and d iastolic blood pressure, heart  rate, and body temperature), 
12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) f indings, or results of safety laboratory tests or physical 
examinations were observed with obicetrapib treatment. In particular, no clinically significant changes in aldosterone, sodium , potassium, or bicarbonate concentrations were observed.  
In addition, no dose-related effe cts have been observed on the type, frequency, or intensity of 
treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs) in clinical studies of obicetrap ib to date. In patient studies, most 
TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Of the patients with s evere TEAEs, 2 were suspected 
to be related to both obicetrapi b and statin treatment. The num ber of patients experiencing TEAEs 
and their severity were similar  across all treatment groups. Incidence rates of d rug-related TEAEs 
were also comparable for all tr eatment groups; the number of TE AEs in the obicetrapib treatment 
groups did not display a dose-dependent effect. There were 7 ra ndomized patients with a 
treatment-emergent serious AE (SAE), none of which were suspect ed to be study drug related. 
One patient had treatment-emerge nt SAEs that resulted in study discontinuation. No deaths 
occurred during these studies.

Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 5 STUDY TREATMENTS 
5.1 Treatment Groups 
Participants will be randomized  in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to 1 of the following treatment groups: 
 Combination therapy: 5 mg obicetrapib + 10 mg ezetimibe; 
 Obicetrapib monotherapy: 5 mg obi cetrapib + placebo ezetimibe;  
 Ezetimibe monotherapy: placebo obicetrapib + 10 mg ezetimibe; o r 
 Placebo: placebo obicetrapib + placebo ezetimibe. 
5.2 Rationale for Dosing 
In previous multiple-dose clinical studies of obicetrapib in he althy subjects and patients, near 
maximal effects were observed with the 5 mg obicetrapib dose. A t this dose level, CETP activity 
and concentrations were effectively reduced, and HDL-C levels w ere increased while LDL-C 
levels decreased. According to the Summary of Product Character istics, the recommended daily 
dose of ezetimibe is 10 mg. Therefore, the present study will u tilize a dose of 5 mg obicetrapib, 
administered with or without 10 mg ezetimibe, in participants w ith mild dyslipidemia following 
the TLC diet. 
5.3 Randomization and Blinding 
Participants who meet all eligibility criteria will be randomiz ed into the study. Participants will be 
randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to the combination therapy, obice trapib monotherapy, ezetimibe 
monotherapy, or placebo treatment groups. At randomization, par ticipants will be stratified 
according to their Screening Visit (Visit 1) LDL-C value (<3.5 mmol/L [<135 mg/dL] or 
3.5 mmol/L [ 135 mg/dL]). An automated inter active response technology (IRT) system will be 
used to assign the participant to 1 of the 4 treatment groups. 
Participants, Investigators, the Clinical Research Organization , and the Sponsor will be blinded to 
all lipid results from Day 1 (Visit 2) for the first participan t through the PK Visit (Visit 6) for the 
last participant in order to pr otect blinding to treatment assi gnment. 
5.4 Breaking the Blind 
Unblinding by request of an Inves tigator should occur only in t he event of an emergency or AE 
for which it is necessary to know  the study drugs to determine an appropriate course of therapy for 
the participant. If the Investig ator or qualified designee must  identify the treatme nt assignment of 
an individual participant, the Investigator or qualified design ee should request the treatment 
assignment from the IRT system. The Investigator is advised not  to reveal the treatment assignment 
to other sites or Sponsor personnel. 
Prior to unblinding, and if the s ituation allows, the Investiga tor should consult with the Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor. If this is impractical, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor 
as soon as possible, without revealing the treatment assignment  of the unblinded participant. The 
Investigator must document the participant identification and t he date and time for breaking the 
blind and must clearl y explain the reasons f or breaking the bli nd.

Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 Participants will be randomized to receive 2 of the study drugs  listed above for the duration of the 
study. 
At each appropriate visit (Visits 2 and 3), participants will r eceive a kit containing blister cards 
with the 2 study drugs appropriate  for the participant’s treatm ent group. Partic ipants will be 
instructed to take 2 units from the blister cards in the kit ea ch day. The blister cards will be clearly 
labelled to indicate which blisters to use on each day. Each ki t will provide a sufficient supply for 
1 month of dosing. Participants will be instructed to return all unused study drugs at the next visit. 
5.5.3 Study Drug Administration 
Study drugs will be administered by the participant orally and once daily on Days 1 through 57. 
Study drugs should be administered at approximately the same ti me each morning, with food. On 
days with visits scheduled, study  drugs should be administered with food following all fasted blood 
samples. If a participant forgets to take study drug on a given day, they should take the next dose 
as normal and should not take a doub le dose to make up for the forgotten dose. 
5.5.4 Treatment Compliance 
Compliance to the study drug regimen will be ev aluated by counting unused tablet s and capsules. 
During the Treatment Period, if c ompliance is not between 80% a nd 120%, inclusive, the 
participant will be counselled a bout the importance of complian ce to the regimen. If the limits are 
exceeded at 2 consecutive visits, a decision will be made by th e Investigator and Sponsor as to 
whether the partic ipant should be withdrawn from the study. 
5.5.5 Storage and Accountability 
All study drugs must be stored below 25°C in a secure area with  access limited to the Investigator 
and authorized site personnel. 
In accordance with regulatory requirements, the Investigator or  designated site personnel must 
document the amount of study drug dispensed and/or administered  to participants, the amount 
returned by participants, and the amount received from and retu rned to the Sponsor (or 
representative) when applicable. Study drug accountability reco rds must be main tained throughout 
the course of the study. The accountability unit for this study  is a tablet or capsule. Discrepancies 
are to be reconciled or resolved. Procedures for final disposit ion of unused study drug will be 
provided in the appropr iate study manual. 
5.6 Prior and Concomitant Medications and/or Procedures 
5.6.1 Excluded Medications and/or Procedures

Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 8 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS 
8.1 Adverse Events 
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a clinic al investigation participant 
administered a pharmaceutical pro duct, which does not necessari ly have a causal relationship with 
this treatment. An AE can therefo re be any unfavorable and/or u nintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally as s o c i a t e d  w i t h  t h e  u s e  o f  a n  
investigational medici nal product, whether  or not related to th e investigational medicinal product. 
All AEs, including observed or volunteered problems, complaints , or symptoms, are to be recorded 
on the appropriate eCRF. 
AEs, which include clinical labor atory test variables, will be monitored and docum ented from the 
time of first dose of study drug until Visit 6. Participants sh ould be instructed to report any AE 
that they experience to the Investigator, whether or not they t hink the event is due to study drug. 
Beginning at the date of the first dose of study drug, Investig ators should make an assessment for 
AEs at each visit and record the event on the appropriate AE eC RF. 
Wherever possible, a specific disease or syndrome rather than i ndividual associ ated signs and 
symptoms should be identified by  the Investigator and recorded on the eCRF. However, if an 
observed or reported sign or symptom is not considered a compon ent of a specific disease or 
syndrome by the Investigator, it should be recorded as a separate AE on the eCRF. Additionally, 
the condition that led to a medical or surgical procedure (eg, surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
or transfusion) should be record ed as an AE, not the procedure itself.  
Any medical condition already pres ent at the date of the first dose of study drug should be recorded 
as medical history and not be reported as an AE unless the medi cal condition or signs or symptoms 
present at baseline change in severity, frequency, or seriousne ss at any time during the study. In 
this case, it should be  reported as an AE. 
Clinically significant abnormal laboratory or other examination  findings that are detected during 
the study or are present at the date of the first dose of study  drug and significantly worsen during 
the study should be reported as A Es, as described below. The Investigator will exe rcise his or her 
medical and scientific judgment in deciding whether an abnormal  laboratory finding or other 
abnormal assessment is  clinically significan t. Clinically signi ficant abnormal laboratory values 
occurring during the clinical study will be followed until repe at tests return to normal, stabilize, or 
are no longer clinically signifi cant. Abnormal test results tha t are determined to be an error should 
not be reported as an AE. Laborat ory abnormalities or other abn ormal clinical findings should be 
reported as an AE if any of the  following are applicable: 
 If an intervention is required as a result of the abnormality; 
 If action taken with the study dr ug is required as a result of the abnormality; or 
 Based on the clinical judgmen t of the Investigator. 
8.1.1 Adverse (Drug) Reaction 
All 
noxious and unintended responses to a medicinal product rel ated to any dose should be 
considered an adverse drug react ion. “Responses” to a medicinal  product means that a causal 
relationship between a medicinal  product and an AE is at least a reasonable possibility, ie, the 
relationship ca nnot be ruled out. 
NewAmsterdam Pharma BV 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-303 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 35 of 55 
Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 8.1.2 Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction 
An Unexpected Adverse Drug Reaction is defined as an adverse re action, the nature or severity of 
which is not consistent with the applicable product information . For obicetrapib, the reference 
safety information is included in  the Investigator’s Brochure currently in force. The reference 
safety information will be revi ewed yearly and the periodicity of the review will be harmonized 
with the reporting period of the D evelopment Safety Update Repo rt. 
8.1.3 Assessment of Adverse Ev ents by the Investigator 
The Investigator will assess the severity (intensity) of each A E as mild, moderate, or severe, and 
will also categorize each AE as to its potential relationship t o study drug using the categories of 
yes or no. 
Assessment of Severity 
Mild – An event that is easily t olerated and generally not interfering with normal  daily activities. 
Moderate – An event that is su fficiently discomforting to inter fere with normal daily activities. 
Severe – An event that is incap acitating with inability to work  or perform normal daily activities. 
Causality Assessment 
The relationship of an AE to the administration of the study dr ug is to be assessed according to the 
following definitions: No (unrelated, not related, or un likely to be related) – The ti me course between the administration 
of study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE rules o ut a causal relationship and another 
cause (concomitant drugs, thera pies, complications, etc) is suspected. 
Yes (possibly, probably, or defin itely related) – The time cour se between the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the AE is consist ent with a causal relationship and 
no other cause (concomitant drugs, therapies, complications, etc) can be identified. The definition implies a reasonable possibility of a causal rel ationship between the event and the 
study drug. This means that there  are facts (evidence) or argum ents to suggest a causal relationship. 
The following factors should also be considered: 
 The temporal sequence from  study drug administration- 
The event should occur after the study drug is given. The lengt h of time from study drug 
exposure to event should be evaluated in the clin ical context o f the event. 
 Underlying, concomitant, intercurrent diseases- 
Each report should be evaluated i n the context of the natural h istory and course of the disease 
being treated and any other diseas e the participant may have. 
 Concomitant drug- The other drugs the participant is taking or the treatment the participant receives should be 
examined to determine whether any of them might be recognized t o cause the event in question. 
NewAmsterdam Pharma BV 
Clinical Study Protocol TA-8995-303 
Confidential & Proprietary Page 36 of 55 
Version 4.0, 14 January 2021  Known response pattern for this class of study drug- 
Clinical and/or preclinical data may indicate whether a particu lar response is likely to be a 
class effect. 
 Exposure to physical and/or mental stresses- 
The exposure to stress might induc e adverse changes in the reci pient and provide a logical and 
better explanation for the event. 
 The pharmacology and PK of the study drug- 
The known pharmacologic propertie s (absorption, distribution, m etabolism, and excretion) of 
the study drug should be considered. 
8.2 Serious Adverse Events 
An AE or adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view  of either the Investigator or Sponsor, 
it results in any of the following outcomes: 
 Death; 
 A life-threatening AE; 
Note: An AE or adverse reaction is considered “life-threatening ” if, in view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the participant at immediate risk of death. It does 
not include an event that, had it  occurred in a mo re severe for m, might have caused death. 
 Requires hospitalization or pr olongation of existing hospitalizations; 
Note: Any hospital admission with at least 1 overnight stay wil l be considered an inpatient 
hospitalization. An emergency roo m or urgent care visit without  hospital admission will not 
be recorded as an SAE under this criterion, nor will hospitaliz ation for a procedure scheduled 
or planned before signing of informed consent, or elective trea tment of a pre-existing condition 
that did not worsen from baselin e. However, unexpected complica tions and/or prolongation of 
hospitalization that occur duri ng elective surgery should be re corded as AEs and assessed for 
seriousness. Admission to the hospital for social or situationa l reasons (ie, no place to stay, live 
too far away to come for hospital visits, or respite care) will  not be considered inpatient 
hospitalizations.  
 A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantia l disruption of the ability to 
conduct normal life functions; 
 A congenital anomaly/birth defect; or 
 An important m edical event. 
Note: Important medical events that do not meet any of the abov e criteria may be considered 
an SAE when, based upon appropria te medical judgment, they may jeopardize the participant 
and may require medica l or surgical interv ention to prevent one  of the outcomes listed above. 
Examples of such medical event s include allergic bronchospasm r equiring intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalizations, or the development of drug dependen cy.

Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 8.3 Serious Adverse Event Reporting − Procedures for Investigators 
Initial Reports 
All SAEs occurring from the time of the first dose of study dru g until 30 days following the last 
administration of study drug must  be reported to  within 24 hours of the 
knowledge of the occurrence. After the 30-day reporting window,  any SAE that the Investigator 
considers related to study drug must be reported to  or the 
Sponsor/designee. 
To report the SAE, complete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture (EDC) 
system for the study. When the form is completed,  personnel will be notified 
electronically by the EDC system and will retrieve the form. If  the event meets serious criteria and 
it is not possible to access the EDC system, send an email to  
 or call the  reporting line (telephone 
number listed below), and fax/ema il the completed paper SAE for m to  (contact 
information listed in Section 8.6 ) within 24 hours of awareness . When the EDC system becomes 
available, the SAE information must be entered within 24 hours of the system becoming available. 
Follow-up Reports 
The Investigator must continue t o follow the participant until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature, stabilizes (in the case of  persistent impairment), or the 
participant dies. Within 24 hours of receipt of follow-up information, the Invest igator must update the SAE form 
electronically in the EDC system  for the study and submit any s upporting documentation 
(eg, participant discha rge summary or autopsy reports) to  via fax or 
email. If it is not possible to access the EDC system, refer to  the procedures outlined above for 
initial reporting of SAEs. 
8.4 Pregnancy Reporting 
If a participant becomes pregnant  during the study or within th e safety follow-up period defined 
in the protocol, the Investigator is to stop dosing with study drug(s) immediately and the participant 
should be withdrawn from the study. Early termination procedure s should be implemented at that 
time.  
A pregnancy is not considered to be an AE or SAE; however, it m ust be reported to  
 within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  will then 
provide the Investigator/site th e Exposure In Utero (EIU) form for completion. The 
Investigator/site must complete t he EIU form and fax/email it b ack to .  
If the female partner of a male participant becomes pregnant wh ile the participant is receiving 
study drug or within the safety fo llow-up period defined in the protocol, the Investigator should 
notify  as described above.  
The pregnancy should be followed until the outcome of the pregn ancy, whenever possible. Once 
the outcome of the pregnancy is known, the EIU form should be completed and faxed/emailed to 
. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate 
classification as an SAE (ie, postpartum complication, spontane ous abortion, stillbirth, neonatal 
death, or congenital anomaly), th e Investigator should follow t he procedures for reporting an SAE.

Adverse Reactions (SUSARs) that are fatal or life-threatening a s soon as possible to the applicable 
competent authorities in all the EU Member States concerned, to  the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA), and to the Central Ethics Committee/Insti tutional Review Board (IRB), 
and in any case no later than 7 days after knowledge by the Spo nsor/designee of such a case. 
Relevant follow-up information will subsequently be communicate d within an additional 8 days.  
All other SUSARs will be reported to the FDA, applicable compet ent authorities concerned, and 
to the Central Ethics Committee concerned as soon as possible b ut within a maximum of 15 days 
of first knowledge by the  Sponsor/designee.  
The Sponsor/designee will also report any additional expedited safety reports required in 
accordance with the timelines out lined in country-specific legi slation.  
The Sponsor/designee will also inf orm all Investigators as requ ired per local regulation. 
The requirements above refer to the requirements relating to in vestigational medicinal product. 
8.6 Special Situation Reports 
Special situation reports include  reports of overdose, misuse, abuse, medication error, and reports 
of adverse reactions associa ted with product complaints. 
 Overdose:  Refers to the administration of a quantity of a medicinal prod uct given per 
administration or cumulatively (a ccidentally or intentionally),  which is above the maximum 
recommended dose according to the  protocol. Clinical judgment s hould always be applied. In 
cases of a discrepancy in the d rug accountability, overdose wil l be established only when it is 
clear that the participant has taken additional dose(s) or the Investigator has reason to suspect 
that the participant has taken additional dose(s).  
 Misuse:  Refers to situations where the medicinal product is intentionally and inappropriately 
used in a way that is not in accordance with the protocol instr uctions or local prescribing 
information and may be accompanied by harmful physical and/or p sychological effects.  
 Abuse:  Is defined as persistent or spor adic, intentional excessive us e of a medicinal product, 
which is accompanied by harmful physical or psychological effec ts. 
 Medication error:  Is any unintentional error in the prescri bing, dispensing, or administration 
of a medicinal product by a hea lthcare profession al, participan t, or consumer, respectively. The 
administration or consumption of the unassigned treatment and a dministration of an expired 
product are always reportable as medication errors; cases of pa rticipants missing doses of 
investigational product are not c onsidered reportable as medica tion errors. 
 Product complaint:  Is defined as any written, elect ronic, or oral communication t hat alleges 
deficiencies related 
to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness, or 
performance of a drug or device after it is released for distri bution. A special situations report 
form will only be completed if a complaint is associated with an adverse drug reaction.  
All special situation events as described above must be reporte d on the special situations report 
form and faxed/emailed to  (contact info rmation listed below) within 
24 hours of knowledge of the event.  All AEs associated with the se special situation reports should

9.1 Analysis Populations 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Populat ion will include all participants randomized into the study. 
Treatment classification will be  based on the randomized treatment.  
The Modified ITT (mITT) Populati on will include all participant s in the ITT Population who 
receive at least 1 dose of any study drug and have a baseline v alue for the LDL-C assessment. Any 
efficacy measurement obtained after a participant receives a restricted lipid-altering therapy, outside of the current study design, will be removed from the m ITT analysis. Treatment 
classification will be based on the randomized treatment. The m ITT Population will be used for 
the primary analysis of  all efficacy endpoints. 
The Per-Protocol (PP) Population will include all participants in the mITT Population who have a 
baseline value for the LDL-C assessment, have a Day 57 value fo r the LDL-C assessment, and 
who did not experience a major protocol deviation that potentia lly impacted the primary efficacy 
endpoint. The PP Population, along with the reason for exclusion, will be finalized prior to study unblinding. 
The PK Population will include all  participants in the mITT Population who have sufficient blood 
samples collected for valid e stimation of PK  parameters. 
The Safety Population will includ e all participants who receive  at least 1 dose of any study drug. 
Treatment classification will be based on the actual treatment received. The Safety Population will 
be the primary population used f or the safety analyses. 
9.2 Statistical Methods 
All study-collected data will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics, graphs, 
and/or raw data listings. Descri ptive statistics for continuous  variables will include number of 
participants (n), mean, standard  deviation (SD), median, minimu m, and maximum values. Analysis 
of categorical variables will include frequency and percentage.  
9.2.1 Analysis of Efficacy 
The mITT Population will be the primary population for the effi cacy analyses. Efficacy will also 
be analyzed using the ITT Popul ation and the PP Population as supportive analyses. 
9.2.1.1 Primary efficacy analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis of  the percent change from Day 1 to Day 57 in LDL-C will be 
performed using a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The analysis will 
include fixed effects for treatme nt, visit, and treatment-by-vi sit interaction, al ong with a covariate 
of the baseline value. The Restricted Maximum Likelihood estima tion approach will be used with 
an unstructured covariance matrix. The least squares means, sta ndard errors, and 2-sided 
95% confidence intervals for each treatment group, for the pair wise comparisons of the 
combination therapy, obicetrapib monotherapy, and ezetimibe mon otherapy to placebo, and for

Version 4.0, 14 January 2021 Missing data will be imputed using multiple imputation methodology. Results will be combined using Rubin’s method. Full deta ils of the model and imputation will be provided in the Statistical 
Analysis Plan (SAP). 
9.2.1.2 Secondary and exploratory efficacy analysis 
A similar MMRM model will be used for the analysis of the secon dary and exploratory efficacy 
endpoints corresponding to the perc ent change from baseline. Fo r the binary effic acy endpoints, a 
logistic regression analysis will be performed with model covar iates of treatment group and 
baseline LDL-C.  In order to maintain the overall  Type I error rate, the seconda ry efficacy endpoints will be tested 
sequentially at the 0.05 significance level according to the pre-specified order of hierarchy. No 
adjustment will be made for mul tiplicity in testing the explora tory efficacy endpoints. Nominal 
p-values will be provided when a pplicable. Descriptive and grap hical summaries by treatment 
group will also be presented. Any additional sensitivity and/or  supplemental analyses will be 
defined in the SAP. 
9.2.2 Analysis of Safety 
The Safety Population will be the primary population for the sa fety analyses. All safety endpoints 
will be summarized descriptively. No statistical inference will  be applied to the s afety endpoints. 
AEs will be categorized by primary system organ class and prefe rred term as coded using the 
Medical Dictionary for Regulator y Activities (MedDRA) category designations. Summaries of 
AEs, including the number and percentage of participants who ex perience an AE, will be provided. 
Laboratory values will be summarized descriptively, including t he change from baseline, by 
treatment group, and overall. In addition, shift tables will be  presented to describe the change in 
laboratory parameter values at pos t-baseline visits using norma l range categories (low, normal, 
and high). 9.2.3 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
Plasma obicetrapib concentrations will be summarized with descr iptive statistics based on the PK 
Population. Exploration of any re lationships with obicetrapib e xposure will be performed, as 
appropriate. 9.2.4 Interim Analysis 
No interim analysis is planned for this study. 
9.2.5 Sample Size Determination 
A sample size of at least 100 evaluable participants (ie, 25 participants per treatment group) will 
provide >90% power to detect a 30% difference in LDL-C reductio n at Day 57 (SD 15%) for the 
combination therapy group com pared to the placebo group at a 2- sided significanc e level of 0.05.  
The sample size for this study was determined in order to provide sufficient power (>80%) for the analyses of the primary effic acy endpoint and secondary efficac y endpoints described in Section 7. 
The sample size calculations used values reported from a previo us clinical trial involving 
obicetrapib (TA-8995) as a starting point for the assumptions o f the treatment difference and

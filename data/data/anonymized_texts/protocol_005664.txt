RSRB#45904                                                   Page 2                                         March 7, 2013                       
 Purpose: This double blind randomized, controlled prospective clinical trial will compare 
the clinical success of two tooth colored resin composite dental filling materials- TPH3 
(Dentsply Caulk ) and an experimental urethane dimethacrylate resin based composite 
resin (Dentsply Caulk) for wear resistance, staining and marginal seal using modified Ryge 
criteria to evaluate the posterior restorations for 24 months in duration.  
Study Objectives 
The purposes of this clinical trial is to ev aluate two composite resins used to restore Class 
I and Class II cavities in teeth of adults.  The clinical study will evaluate the resin composite 
restorations placed in Class I and Class II cavity preparations for anatomic form , color 
match , marginal int egrity , marginal discoloration, proximal contact , polishability, caries, 
sensitiv ity, gingival index, staining ,wear, and thermal response  for 24 months. . 
 
. 
 
Study Design 
The study will be double blind  randomized, controlled clinical evaluation of similar sized 
class I and class II with both dental restorative materials placed in a single patient. Both 
esthetic restorative materials will be bonded with a single bonding agent Prime and Bond 
Elect  (Dentsply Caulk ).  
 
Randomization: teeth that require restorations and satisfy the inclusion criteria parameters 
will be randomly selected. Code R will be assigned to the most anterior tooth or located 
on the right. Code T will be assigned to the most posterior tooth or located on left. See 
randomization scheduled (appendix 3 ). Sponsor will blind both esthetic bonding materials 
and label them code R and code T.  
 
 
 
The study will be conducted in the Division of General Dentistry at Eastman Institute for 
Oral Health University of Rochester . The study will evaluate the pair of composite resin 
restorations over a two year period .  
 
50 adult patients aged 1 8 - 85 yearsold  will be recruited into the study.  Based on previous 
clinical trials, the average attrition rate for a two year clini cal trial is approximately 10%  
per year.  To assure that 30 restorations per material are available at the three year recall, 
100 restorations (5 0 of each material) will be placed assuming a 20% attrition rate.  
 
Investigators 
Dr Hans Malmstrom is the Principal Investigator. Drs Malmstrom will conduct the 
screening examinations and Dr. Malmstrom and members of the study team  will obtain 
consent. . Experienced sub-investigators will place the tooth colored restorations.. Two of 
the study team investigators  who have not placed the restorations will complete the 
baseline, 6 month, 12 months and 24 months recall examinations of the restorations. 
Investigators will not evaluate the restorations they placed.  Baseline evaluations will be 
conducted one week  after the restorations are placed.  
 
 
 
 
Background and Significance. 
RSRB#45904                                                   Page 3                                         March 7, 2013                       
 Posterior resin composites are used by 80% of the dentists practicing in the United States 
[1].  The results of the first clinical trial of posterior composites were published in 1971 [2] . 
Subsequent recalls of the same restorations revealed that the resin composite restorations 
had poor wear resistance [3, 4] . Early reviews recommended that these materials be 
limited to conservative bicuspid and first molar restorations where esthetics was critical 
[5].  In spite of improvements in resin composites, material limitations exist which restrict 
the use of resin composite as a posterior restorative material. Clinically, resin restorations 
are difficult and require more placement time than a similar sized amalgam restoration [6] .  
Interproximal contacts are difficult to obtain since composite is a paste material that 
shrinks during polymerization; two clinical investigations reported weak or defective 
contacts in 20% of the posterior composite restorations [7, 8].   
 
R
esin-based composite consists mainly of a resin matrix surrounding inorganic filler 
particles.  The primary constituents of the resin matrix are resin monomers and an 
initiator/catalyst system for polymerization.  The first dental RBC monomer developed in 
the 1960's is still used today. Based on the reaction product of bisphenol-A and glycidyl 
methacrylate  (bis-GMA) it is a bulky monomer with methacrylate groups at each end of 
the molecule (dimethacrylate).  Polymerization occurs through a free radical addition 
reaction.  The double bonded carbons of the methacrylate groups at each end of the active 
site on the monomer cross-links during the polymerization process initially producing a 
linear polymer, then, by reacting with the second site a highly cross linked polymer is 
produced [35].  Since bis-GMA is quite viscous, it must be thinned by using shorter, more 
flexible diacrylate monomers, e.g., ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) and 
triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (TEGDMA).  In the 1970's another diacrylate monomer, 
urethane dimethacrylate (UDMA) was adopted for dental use, the molecular weight is 
similar to bis-GMA, but more flexible.  UDMA may be used alone or in combination with 
other diacrylate monomers [36].  Other base monomers are utilized besides bis-GMA and 
urethane dimethacrylate, however, none has been proven to be clinically superior; these 
two monomers still predominate.   
 
Adhesives bond the composite resin into the cavity preparation.  The entire 
bonding technique requires isolation from salivary contamination, although the newest 
dentin bonding agents are more moisture resistant than older generation agents, and 
blood contaminants are detrimental to bond strength [9, 10] .  
Although accurate measurement of posterior composite wear is difficult and many 
different methods have been used to measure wear, most studies have concluded that 
composite resins exhibit greater loss of anatomic form in occlusal contact areas than in 
contact free areas [17].  The wear of early composites ranged from 12-105 microns per 
year, while in the same studies, amalgam wear ranged from 6-58 microns per year and 
enam el wear ranged from 3-54 microns per year [17-21].  As composite resin materials 
have improved, so has wear resistance.  The current generation of composite resin has 
wear rates from 4.9 microns for Clearfil Photoposterior [22] and 7-8 microns for Heliomolar 
[23] which compares favorably to enamel.  Additional wear has been shown with 
composite resin restorations with increased size, in more posterior teeth and in patients 
with fewer remaining teeth. 
Other developments of composite resin with more wear resistance and adhesive 
systems with stronger bonds to tooth structure are needed.  This study will evaluate the 
clinical success of two composite resins with different chemistries.

Screening 
Each subject will be screened for compliance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria specified 
above. 
 
Risks to the patient:  
Patients will wear lead aprons as a protective measure during the radiographic procedure 
to minimize risk.  Patient data will be monitored and if, during the course of the study, it 
becomes apparent that any restorative material is significantly poorer, the patient will be 
informed and, if needed, the restorations replaced at no cost to the subject. 
Other potential risks associated with restorations’ study and standard procedures are as 
follows:Impressions – subjects may experience gag reflex as the soft paste hardens in 
their mouth. 
Photographs – stretching of lips and buccal tissues to allow tooth visibility. 
Gingival index – subjects may experience some discomfort around the gingival margins 
of the two restored teeth as a dental instrument (probe) stimulate the gingival tissues.  
RSRB#45904                                                   Page 6                                         March 7, 2013                       
 Sensitivity test – a cotton swab embedded with a cold solution is placed on the tooth 
surface to assess sensitivity. Subject may experience a cold sensation that may last 2- 3 
seconds (same as eating ice cream). 
Vitality test – Subject may experience a tingling sensation as the device measures nerve 
vitality.  
Consent:  
Consent for this study will be obtained prior to the initial examination and the initiation of 
any portion of the study.  The PI or sub-investigators and study coordinator will explain the 
consent to the patient and answer questions they may have.  The consent forms and all 
records associated with this study will be maintained in the clinical research office under 
lock to ensure the records are confidential.  Each subject will provide written consent to 
participate in this study in accordance with Federal regulations (21 CFR Parts 50 and 56). 
 
Materials and Methods:  
Two light-cured resin composites: (TPH 3, Dentsply Caulk and an Experimental urethane 
dimethacrylate resin based composite resin , Dentsply Caulk) will be used to restore teeth 
with moderate-large size class I or class II cavity preparations.  Each composite resin will 
be used with Prime and Bond Elect bonding agent.  All restored teeth will be in occlusion 
with at least one proximal contact for each class II restorations with an adjacent tooth.  
Cavity preparations will be prepared for all restorations following rubber dam isolation 
unless it is not possible due to abnormal anatomic considerations.  
 
Cavity preparation design .  To be included in this study restorations must have a buccal 
to lingual isthmus width equal to or greater than 1/3 the distance from buccal to 
lingual/palatal cusp tips, 75% of the restorations must be Class II.   
 
All prepared margins will be placed ninety degrees to the external tooth surface.  Any tooth 
with a carious or mechanical pulpal exposure will be excluded from the study. Any cavity 
preparation judged to be within 1mm of pulpal tissue either clinically or radiographically 
will be lined with Dycal (Dentsply Caulk, Milford, DE) a calcium hydroxide containing liner.  
Palodent Plus (Dentsply Caulk) or other sectional matrix will be used with class 2 
restorations; however a Toffelmire matrix may be used with large preparations.  The 
composite will be photoinitiated with a curing light (Smart Lite, Dentsply Caulk) with an 
output of at least 750 mW/cm2. Output will be recorded for each restoration placed.  The 
resin composite will be placed using an incremental filling technique, beginning with an 
initial increment in the gingival floor.  Subsequent increments will be placed to fill the box. 
No increment will exceed 2mm. 
 
 Investigators  will insert 100 restorations.   Carbide finishing burs (Midwest 7402, OS 
1,OS 2) will be used to remove gross excess, followed by finishing strips and disks (S of-
Lex, 3M, St Paul, MN), and the Enhance system (Dentsply Caulk, Milford, DE).  All 
polishing will be done at slow speed with water spray.   After removing the rubber dam the 
occlusion will be adjusted. Each restoration will be evaluated directly and indirectly at .  
The direct clinical evaluations will be made using the checklist in table one, a modification 
of the United States Public Health Services (USPHS )  guidelines.   
Each restoration will be evaluated for anatomic form , color match , marginal integr ity, 
marginal discoloration, proximal contact , polishability, caries, sensitivity, gingival index. 
Indirect wear measurements will be made on casts from impressions made at each recall 
and baseline.   
Two of the trained evaluators (Drs Malmstrom, Ren, Yunker and Romero) who have not 
placed  restorations,  will perform post-restorative evaluation at baseline, 6 months, 12 
RSRB#45904                                                   Page 7                                         March 7, 2013                       
 months and 24 months. A consensus will be reached if both evaluators disagree on the 
restorations’ direct assessment. Dr Malmstrom will provide retraining  any time throughout 
the study upon evaluator’s request. 
 
 
Study Visits 
Subjects will be evaluated at the Eastman Institute for Oral Health General Dentistry 
Department. Study visits at 6, 12 and 24  months may be combined with routine dental 
care visits.    
 
Screening:  
Subjects will be screen ed for study eligibility. Two bitewing radiographs will be taken of 
teeth in need of restorations .  
If a subject is eligible, the  informed consent process will initiate. Subject will be given a 
consent form by a member of the study team and discuss study procedures. Subjects will 
be informed about the option of taking the consent form home and schedule an 
appointment at their convenience as well as that their participation is strictly voluntary and 
participation will not affect their care.    
 
If the subject wishes to participate in the study a copy of the consent form will be given 
and pre-operative assessments indicated on schedule of events (appendix 1) will be 
administered . If the subject satisfies inclusion criteria for the study and wishes to receive 
the restoration at this visit, the study coordinator will assign products code according to 
subject number listed on the randomization list (appendix 3) and restorations will be placed 
by one of the sub-investigators. Subject can choose to schedule a separate appointment 
for restorations placement and no additional study procedure will be required at the 
restorative visit.  
 
Baseline (one week after the restorations)  
Study procedure: 
Subject’s restorations will be evaluated by two investigators other than the investigator 
who placed the restorations for the following: 
 anatomic form,  
 color match,  
 marginal integrity,  
 marginal discoloration,  
 proximal contact,  
 polishability  
 caries.  
 sensitivity 
 Gingival index – (a dental probe will gently stimulate gingival tissues around the two 
restored teeth). 
 Impressions for wearing and contact assessments will be taken. – A soft material is 
placed on the subject’s upper or lower dentition or both (depending on the location 
of restored teeth). As the material hardens will leave a negative print of the 
subject’s dentition. A stone material is then poured into the impression resulting in 
a cast which will allow restorations’ wearing and contact measurements. 
 Two radiographs will be taken.. These radiographs are taken in addition to the 
screening radiographs as they will provide a post-restorative baseline.

Subjects will receive a total of $180.00 
 
Evaluators will be calibrated .   
Dr Malmstrom will conduct preclinical sessions to  train clinicians by preparing and 
restoring at least two extracted teeth mounted in stone.  Each tooth will be prepared and 
restored according to the guidelines above   and will also standardize restoration 
placement among the clinicians (Drs Malmstrom, Yunker, Ren and Romero). Dr 
Malmstrom will also conduct a clinical training session to train clinician evaluators (Drs 
Malmstrom, Yunker, Ren and Romero)to conduct baseline and recall measurements using 
the standards, appendix 1. Scores for each evaluator will be compared to other evaluators 
and inter-evaluator comparisons made. The trained evaluators will independently evaluate 
each restoration in our clinical study and a forced consensus obtained if necessary.    A 
kappa value  of 0.8 of all criteria is expected after calibration of the examiners 
 
Data Analysis:   
Restorations placed using each composite will be analyzed.  The categorized clinical 
assessment data (color, marginal discoloration, secondary caries, anatomic form, 
marginal adaptation) will be summarized by computing percentages for each category and 
used to describe any trends noted in the performance of the groups. In the analysis of 
categorical data of anatomic form , color match , marginal integrity , marginal discoloration, 
proximal contact , polishability, caries, sensitivity, and gingival index,  the frequency 
distribution over various categories will be calculated and reported.  A sample size of 100 
restorations in 50 subjects is not based on a statistic al plan, but rather on guidelines put 
forth by the American Dental Association for obtaining approval as an amalgam 
replacement for posterior restorations.  The guidelines specifically call for an evaluation of 
a minimum of 30 restorations in a minimum of 20 subjects at 18 months. Taking subject 
attrition into account that forms the 2 and 3 year requirements.   
The primary efficacy variables are based on ADA guidelines for acceptance and 
include the direct assessments of anatomic form, color match,  marginal  integrity , marginal 
discoloration, proximal contact , polishability, caries, sensitivity, and gingival index , and 
periapical pathology. Scores for primary efficacy variables will be summarized and 
displayed using descriptive statistics. The success criteri a for the primary efficacy 
variables for passing the ADA requirements for acceptance at 18 months, namely;  
Color Match – no more than 10% scores of C 
Marginal Discoloration – no more than 10% scores of C 
Marginal Integrity – no more than 10% scores of C – no scores of D 
Caries – an incidence of no greater than 5% 
Proximal Contour – not less than 95% showing no observable evidence of 
broadening   of contact  
Wear– no more than 50 microns 
RSRB#45904                                                   Page 11                                         March 7, 2013                       
  
The ADA guidelines do not specify requirements for Proximal Contacts, Vitality, 
Sensitivity or Periapical Pathology. Success criteria for these parameters will be based on 
comparisons to incidences reported in the literature.  Secondary efficacy variables include 
direct assessments of Anatomic Form and the Gingival Index, and the indirect assessment 
of occlusal contact. Scores will be summarized and displayed using descriptive statistics.  
Success criteria will be based on comparisons to reports in the literature.  Safety variables 
include adverse events, unanticipated adverse device effects, and complaints.  
Descriptions of occurrences, incidence, severity and required treatments will be 
summarized and tabulated where appropriate.   
 
Criteria for evaluation:  
Modified USPHS criteria will be used to assess individual restorations.   
 
Times of evaluation: Baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects 
Unanticipated adverse device effect means any serious adverse effect on health or safety 
or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that 
effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

Problem cases 
Where a study restoration has failed this will be recorded on the Failed Restoration An 
alternative treatment (of a different composite resin restorative and bonding system, or 
other direct restorative system, at the discretion of the clinician) will be offered to the 
patient and a record made in the patient’s notes. Neither the patient, nor the clinician will 
pay for this further treatment . Dr. Nick Conte, Director of Clinical Research at Dentsply 
Caulk  must be notified that an altern ative treatment has been necessary and requires 
payment by the sponsor.  Factors determining restoration failure or success will be the 
result of evaluators’ assessment criteria listed on Appendix 2.

RSRB#45904                                                   Page 6                                         March 7, 2013                       
 Purpose: This addendum protocol is a controlled prospective clinical trial to evaluate and 
compare the clinical success of an additional investigational tooth colored resin composite 
dental filling material, EsthetX HD (Dentsply/Caulk), to TPH3 (Dentsply Caulk ) and to an 
experimental urethane dimethacrylate resin based composite resin (Dentsply Caulk) . 
Comparison of EsthetX HD (Dentsply/Caulk ) to the resin composite  materials used in the  
original protocol is necessary i n order to evaluate its clinical performance. Using the 
modified Ryge criteria, EsthetX HD (Dentsply/Caulk) restorations will be evaluated for 
wear resistance, staining and marginal seal during a 24 month  period.  
 
 
 
 
Study Objectives 
The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate and compare an additional  composite resin  
material  used to restore Class I and Class II cavities in teeth of adults.  The clinical study 
will evaluate the resin composite restorations placed in Class I and Class II cavity 
preparations for anatomic form , color match , marginal integrity,  marginal discoloration, 
proximal contact , polishability, caries, sensitiv ity, gingival index, staining ,wear, and 
thermal response  for a 24 months period.  
 
. 
 
Study Design 
The study will be a controlled clinical evaluation of similar sized class I and class II with 
dental restorative materials placed in a single patient.  The esthetic restorative materials 
will be bonded with a single bonding agent Prime and Bond Elec t (Dentsply Caulk ).  
 
The study will be conducted in the Division of General Dentistry at Eastman Institute for 
Oral Health University of Rochester . The study will evaluate the composite resin 
restorations over a two year period .  
 
Fifty adult patients age d 18 - 85 years  old will be recruited into the study.  Based on 
previous clinical trials, the average attrition rate for a two year clini cal trial is approximately 
10%  per year.  To assure that 30 restorations per material are available at the two year 
recall, 50 restorations will be placed assuming a 20% attrition rate.  
 
Investigators 
Dr Hans Malmstrom is the Principal Investigator. Drs Malmstrom will conduct the 
screening examinations and Dr. Malmstrom and members of the study team will obtain 
consent. . Experienced sub-investigators will place the tooth colored restorations.. Two o f 
the study team investigators who have not placed the restorations will complete the 
baseline, 6 month, 12 months and 24 months recall examinations of the restorations. 
Investigators will not evaluate the restorations they placed.  Baseline evaluations will be 
conducted one week after the restorations are placed.

Material:   
 
Experimental Material: EsthetX HD improvement composite made by Calk using three 
lots of the glass filler, which were silanated in a production Resodyn unit at Calk. The 
raw material, unsilanated glass (also called TPM filler) was provided by TPM company in 
a production scale. The TPM filler was designed to reduce the stickiness of current 
EsthetX HD composite. 
 
 
Duration of the investigation: 24 months  
 
 
Number of restorations: 
50 restorations will placed to ensure a minimum 3 0 restorations  
 
Class of restorations: 
Restorations will be placed in separate preparations in Class I and Class II in upper and 
lower jaw in bicuspids and molars.   All teeth will have natural teeth or crowns of 
bridgework as antagonists. For the clinical evaluation of the resin, specific criteria (table 1 
and 2) will be used to evaluate the restorations directly and indirectly.   
 
Distribution of restorations: 
EsthetX HD material will be placed on patients who need at least one tooth restored, with 
a maximum of two restorations per each patient.  A maximum of 25% of the restorations 
will be class I the remainder will be class II restorations.  
 
Size of cavities: 
Moderate-large cavities with an isthmus width greater than or equal to 1/3 the intercuspal 
distance (1/3 the distance between the cusp tips) will be selected for this study. 
 
Subject Population: 
Enrollment for subjects who received  composite restoration TPH3 Spectra HV (Dentsply 
Caulk) and an experimental urethane dimethacrylate resin based composite resin 
(Dentsply Caulk) is complete and currently on the follow-up phase. An additional 50 
subjects for this investigation will be selected from patients of the University of Rochester 
at
 Eastman Institute for Oral Health. Fifty subjects who are generally seeking routine 
dental care and need one or two restorations on asymptomatic posterior teeth and aged 
18-85 will be recruited.

Screening 
Each subject will be screened for compliance with the inclusion/exclusion criteria specified 
above. 
 
Risks to the patient:  
Patients will wear lead aprons as a protective measure during the radiographic procedure 
to minimize risk.  Patient data will be monitored and if, during the course of the study, it 
becomes apparent that any restorative material is significantly poorer, the patient will be 
informed and, if needed, the restorations replaced at no cost to the subject. 
Other potential risks associated with restorations’ study and standard procedures are as 
follows: 
Impressions – subjects may experience gag reflex as the soft paste hardens in their 
mouth. 
Photographs – stretching of lips and buccal tissues to allow tooth visibility. 
Gingival index – subjects may experience some discomfort around the gingival margins 
of the two restored teeth as a dental instrument (probe) stimulate the gingival tissues.  
RSRB#45904                                                   Page 9                                         March 7, 2013                       
 Sensitivity test – a cotton swab embedded with a cold solution is placed on the tooth 
surface to assess sensitivity. Subject may experience a cold sensation that may last 2- 3 
seconds (same as eating ice cream). 
Vitality test – Subject may experience a tingling sensation as the device measures nerve 
vitality.  
 
Consent:  
Consent for this study will be obtained prior to the initial examination and the initiation of 
any portion of the study.  The PI or sub-investigators and study coordinator will explain the 
consent to the patient and answer questions they may have.  The consent forms and all 
records associated with this study will be maintained in the clinical research office under 
lock to ensure the records are confidential.  Each subject will provide written consent to 
participate in this study in accordance with Federal regulations (21 CFR Parts 50 and 56). 
 
Materials and Methods:  
A light-cured resin composites: EsthetX HD will be used to restore teeth with moderate-
large size class I or class II cavity preparations.  Each composite resin will be used with 
Prime and Bond Elect bonding agent.  All restored teeth will be in occlusion with at least 
one proximal contact for each class II restorations with an adjacent tooth.  Cavity 
preparations will be prepared for all restorations following rubber dam isolation unless it is 
not possible due to abnormal anatomic considerations.  
 
Cavity preparation design .  To be included in this study restorations must have a buccal 
to lingual isthmus width equal to or greater than 1/3 the distance from buccal to 
lingual/palatal cusp tips, 75% of the restorations must be Class II.   
 
All prepared margins will be placed ninety degrees to the external tooth surface.  Any tooth 
with a carious or mechanical pulpal exposure will be excluded from the study. Any cavity 
preparation judged to be within 1mm of pulpal tissue either clinically or radiographically 
will be lined with clinically successful Surefil SDR flow plus in up to 4mm increments 
leaving atleast 2mm for Esthet-X HD improvement material on exposed occlusal surface .  
Palodent Plus (Dentsply Caulk) or other sectional matrix will be used with class 2 
restorations; however a Toffelmire matrix may be used with large preparations.  The 
composite will be photoinitiated with a curing light (Smart Lite Focus , Dentsply Caulk) with 
an output of at least 750 mW/cm2. Output will be recorded for each restoration placed.  
The resin composite will be placed using an incremental filling technique, beginning with 
an initial increment in the gingival floor.  Subsequent increments will be placed to fill the 
box. No increment will exceed 2mm for Estet-X HD improvement , TPH 3 Spectra HV and 
4mm when Surefil SDR flow is used as liner 
 
Investigators will insert 150 restorations.   Carbide finishing burs (Midwest 7402, OS 1,OS 
2) will be used to remove gross excess, followed by finishing strips and disks (Sof-Lex, 
3M, St Paul, MN), and the Enhance system (Dentsply Caulk, Milford, DE).  All polishing 
will be done at slow speed with water spray.   After removing the rubber dam the occlusion 
will be adjusted. Each restoration will be evaluated directly and indirectly at The direct 
clinical evaluations will be made using the checklist in table one, a modification of the 
United States Public Health Services ( USPHS ) guidelines.   
Each restoration will be evaluated for anatomic form , color match , marginal integrity,  
marginal discoloration, proximal contact , polishability,  caries, sensitivity, gingival index. 
Indirect wear measurements will be made on casts from impressions made at baseline , 
12 and 24 month recall  visit

 Two of the trained and calibrated evaluators (Drs Malmstrom, Ren, Yunker, DeRosa and 
Alejandro Murguia-Sanchez) who have not placed restorations, will perform post-
restorative evaluation at baseline, 6 months, 12 months and 24 months. A consensus will 
be reached if both evaluators disagree on the restorations’ direct assessment. D r 
Malmstrom will provide r etraining any time throughout the study upon evaluator’s request. 
 
 
Study Visits 
Subjects will be evaluated at the Eastman Institute for Oral Health General Dentistry 
Department. Study visits at one week, 6, 12 and 24 months may be combined with routine 
dental care visits.    
 
Screening:  
Subjects will be screen ed for study eligibility. Two bitewing radiographs will be taken of 
teeth in need of restorations .  
If a subject is eligible, the informed consent process will initiate. Subject will be given a 
con
sent form by a member of the study team and discuss study procedures. Subjects will 
be informed about the option of taking the consent form home and schedule an 
appointment at their convenience as well as that their participation is strictly voluntary and 
participation will not affect their care.    
 
If the subject wishes to participate in the study a copy of the consent form will be given 
and pre-operative assessments indicated on schedule of events (appendix 1) will be 
administered . If the subject satisfies inclusion criteria for the study and wishes to receive 
the restoration at this visit a restoration or two restorations will be placed by one of the 
sub-investigators. Subjects can choose to schedule a separate appointment for 
restorations placement and no additional study procedure will be required at the 
restorative visit.  
 
Baseline (one week after the restorations)  
Study procedure: 
Subject’s restorations will be evaluated by two investigators other than the investigator 
who placed the restorations for the following: 
 anatomic form,  
 color match,  
 marginal integrity,  
 marginal discoloration,  
 proximal contact,  
 polishability  
 caries.  
 sensitivity 
 Gingival index – (a dental probe will gently stimulate gingival tissues around the two 
restored teeth). 
 Impressions for wearing and contact assessments will be taken. – A soft material is 
placed on the subject’s upper or lower dentition or both (depending on the location 
of restored teeth). As the material hardens will leave a negative print of the 
subject’s dentition . A stone material is then poured into the impression resulting in 
a cast which will allow restorations’ wearing and contact measurements. 
 Two radiographs will be taken. These radiographs are taken in addition to the 
screening radiographs as they will provide a post-restorative baseline.

9. Payment for Participation.  
Subject will receive the following payments. 
baseline - $20 
6 months – $40 
12 months – $50 
24 months – $70 
Subjects will receive a total of $180.00 
 
Evaluators will be calibrated .   
Dr Malmstrom will conduct preclinical sessions to train clinicians by preparing and 
restoring at least two extracted teeth mounted in stone.  Each tooth will be prepared and 
restored according to the guidelines above and will also standardize restoration placement 
among the clinicians (Drs Malmstrom, Yunker, Ren and Alejandro Murguia-Sanchez ). Dr 
Malmstrom will also conduct a clinical training session to train clinician evaluators (Drs 
Malmstrom, Yunker, Ren and Alejandro Murguia-Sanchez) to conduct baseline and recall 
measurements using the standards, appendix 1. Scores for each evaluator will be 
compared to other evaluators and inter-evaluator comparisons made. The trained 
evaluators will independently evaluate each restoration in our clinical study and a forced 
consensus obtained if necessary.    A kappa value of 0.8 of all criteria is expected after 
calibration of the examiners 
 
Data Analysis:   
Restorations placed using each composite will be analyzed.  The categorized clinical 
assessment data (color, marginal discoloration, secondary caries, anatomic form, 
marginal adaptation) will be summarized by computing percentages for each category and 
used to describe any trends noted in the performance of the groups. In the analysis of 
categorical data of anatomic form , color match , marginal integrity , marginal discoloration, 
proximal contact , polishability, caries, sensitivi ty, and gingival index,  the frequency 
distribution over various categories will be calculated and reported.  A sample size of 100 
restorations in 50 subjects is not based on a statistical plan, but rather on guidelines put 
forth by the American Dental Asso ciation for obtaining approval as an amalgam 
replacement for posterior restorations.  The guidelines specifically call for an evaluation of 
a minimum of 30 restorations in a minimum of 20 subjects at 18 months. Taking subject 
attrition into account that fo rms the 2 and 3 year requirements.   
The primary efficacy variables are based on ADA guidelines for acceptance and 
include the direct assessments of anatomic form, color match,  marginal integrity , marginal 
discoloration, proximal contact , polishability, ca ries, sensitivity, and gingival index , and 
periapical pathology. Scores for primary efficacy variables will be summarized and 
displayed using descriptive statistics. The success criteria for the primary efficacy 
variables for passing the ADA requirements f or acceptance at 18 months, namely;  
Color Match – no more than 10% scores of C 
Marginal Discoloration – no more than 10% scores of C 
Marginal Integrity – no more than 10% scores of C – no scores of D 
Caries – an incidence of no greater than 5% 
Proximal Contour – not less than 95% showing no observable evidence of 
broadening   of contact  
RSRB#45904                                                   Page 14                                         March 7, 2013                       
 Wear– no more than 50 microns 
 
The ADA guidelines do not specify requirements for Proximal Contacts, Vitality, 
Sensitivity or Periapical Pathology. Success criteria for these parameters will be based on 
comparisons to incidences reported in the literature.  Secondary efficacy variables include 
direct assessments of Anatomic Form and the Gingival Index, and the indirect assessment 
of occlusal contact. Scores will be summarized and displayed using descriptive statistics.  
Success criteria will be based on comparisons to reports in the literature.  Safety variables 
include adverse events, unanticipated adverse device effects, and complaints.  
Descriptions of occurrences, incidence, severity and required treatments will be 
summarized and tabulated where appropriate.   
 
Criteria for evaluation:  
Modified USPHS criteria will be used to assess individual restorations.   
 
Times of evaluation: Baseline, 6 months, 12 months, 24 months  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects 
Unanticipated adverse device effect means any serious adverse effect on health or safety 
or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that 
effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of 
incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or 
application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that 
relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.      
 
 
MONITORING The sponsor may monitor this trial at timely intervals for compliance with 
this protocol, applicable FDA regulations and any conditions of approval imposed by 
reviewing the IRB. This trial will also be monitored for safety related issues to determine 
whether any unreasonable risk to subjects develops. 
 
ACCESS TO RECORDS 
Investigators will permit monitoring, audits and regulatory inspections and will provide 
direct access to study related documentation. 
 
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
 Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects will be reported to the sponsor and the 
reviewing IRB as soon as possible, but no later than within 10 working days. 
 Withdrawal of IRB approval will be reported to the sponsor within 5 working days.  Any 
use of the device in humans without informed consent will be reported to the sponsor 
within 5 working days. Upon request, reports of complaints and adverse events will be 
provided to the sponsor. 
 
 
Problem cases 
Where a study restoration has failed this will be recorded on the Failed Restoration An 
alternative treatment (of a different composite resin restorative and bonding system, or 
other direct restorative system, at the discretion of the clinician) will be offered to the 
patient and a record made in the patient’s notes. Neither the patient, nor the clinician will 
pay for this further treatment . Dr. Nick Conte, Director of Clinical Research at Dentsply 
Caulk  must be notified that an alternative treatment has been necessary and requires

 payment by the sponsor.  Factors determining restoration failure or success will be the 
result of evaluators’ assessment criteria listed on Appendix 2.  
Restorative materials will have the same tooth color, consistency and odor. 
 
 
Adverse Events 
Any adverse reaction to the treatment provided as part of the study will be fully investigated 
and recorded on the Adverse Event Record Form including details of the appropriate 
clinical action taken, and promptly reported to the Investigational Review Board . Dr. Nick 
Conte, Director of Clinical Research, Dentsply Caulk will be the contact ed at (302- 430-
7303). In the event of an adverse reaction to the restorative material, any indemnity will 
be borne by Dentsply Caulk, in accordance with the research contract.  Any decision as 
to whether to prematurely stop the study will be taken jointly by the PI, IRB and Dentsply 
Caulk. The IRB will be updated by the PI regarding adverse events according to the IRB 
reporting guidelines.  
 
Reports to sponsor 
The PI will prepare and submit a report to the sponsors following completion of the 6 
month, 12 month and 24 month recalls  
 
Publication of findings 
The investigators will be entitled to publish the findings of the evaluation; the data may 
also be presented as an abstract or oral presentation at an appropriate Dental Research 
meeting. Any manuscript, abstract or other communication prepared for submission or 
public presentation should be submitted to the sponsors for comment as stated in the 
contract. The data will also be communicated internally at Caulk to appropriate members 
of the Business Team and Professional Services, Marketing, Regulatory and R & D 
personnel.

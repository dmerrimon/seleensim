 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
TITLE: COVFIS -HOME: A PHASE 2 PLACEBO -CONTROLLED PILOT STUDY IN 
COVID -19 OF FISETIN TO ALLEVIATE DYSFUNCTION AND DECREASE 
COMPLICATIONS IN AT -RISK OUTPATIENTS  
 
INDICATION : Reduction of complications in patients with COVID -19 infection.  
 
OBJECTIVES : The primary objective of this study is to determine whether short -term treatment 
with Fisetin reduces the rate of death and long-term complications related to COVID -19. The 
secondary objective is to determine the safety of treatment with Fisetin in this patient population. 
The exploratory objective is to evaluate links between aging biomarkers and treatment  effects.  
 
PATIENT POPULATION : Males and females, at least 18 years of age, who have been diagnosed 
with a COVID -19 infection and have at least one hig h-risk criterion.  
 
Inclusion Criteria : 
 
• Males and females, at least 18 years of age, capable and willing to provide informed consent;  
• Patient must have received a diagnosis of COVID -19 infection within the last 10 days;

 o Immediately before the 1st IP administration (Day 0) until at least 10 hours after 
the 2nd IP administration (Day 1)  
o Immediately before the 3rd IP administration (Day 8) until at least 10 hours after 
the 4th IP administration (Day 9)  
• Patient with a history of an allergic reaction or significant sensitivity to Fisetin;  
• Patient undergoing chemotherapy for  cancer;  
• Patient is considered by the invest igator, for any reason, to be an unsuitable study candidate.  
• History of diverticulitis or diverticulosis with GI bleeding, as per clinical judgement.  
 
STUDY DESIGN:  This will be a randomized, do uble-blind, placebo -controlled study . Following 
signature of the informed consent form, approximately 300 subjects meeting all inclusion and no 
exclusion criteria will be consented with a goal of randomizing 150 subjects to receive either Fisetin 
or placebo (1:1 allocation ratio) on Days 0 a nd 1 and 8 and 9 (4 doses over 10 days). Follow -up 
phone contacts will occur at 15 and 30 days following randomization for evaluation of the occurrence 
of any trial endpoints or other adverse  events, with unblended follow -up contacts at Days 60.  
 
OUTCOMES:  The primary endpoint will be the rate of complications related to COVID -19 (CoV) 
disease using a 7 point score adapted from the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement of CoV 
(Appendix A) in the 30 days following randomization. The secondary endpoint i s to determine safety 
and tolerability of treatment with Fisetin in this patient population. Exploratory objectives are to 
evaluate links between soluble and genetic markers of senescent cell abundance, SASP factors, 
inflammation, viral load, and treatment  effects and if Fisetin treatment during acute CoV infection 
decreases Long -hauler syndrome at Days 60.  
 
STATISTICAL RATIONALE AND ANALYSIS:  All main analyses in COVFIS -HOME will be 
conducted on an intention -to-treat basis. Assuming 75 subjects/ group with a significance level of 
0.05, the study will have 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 2.24 comparing the placebo - to Fisetin -
treated group , using the 7 -point severity score at Day 30 as the endpoint in an ordinal logistic 
regression model.  
 
A fully independent 5 -member Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established and 
will review unblinded safety data as detailed in the DSMB ch arter. An interim analysis is planned 
after approximately 50% of randomized patients have completed 30 days of follow -up. 
 
The DSMB charter will pre -specify the methods of interim efficacy analyses and the rules for early 
study termination, approved by all  board members. The stopping rules for efficacy will be based on 
the O’Brien -Fleming α -spending function or on a similar conservative approach so that the impact 
on the final alpha level will be negligible. Futility will be assessed by computing conditiona l power. 
The DSMB will have the option of recommending early study termination because of overwhelming 
efficacy, early termination for futility, or continuation of the trial as planned.  
 
The primary analysis of efficacy will be based on the intent -to-treat principle. The primary endpoint 
will be compared between the two treatment groups using a chi -square test. Secondary endpoints will 
be analyzed similarly.  
 
ANTICIPATED TOTAL NUMBER OF RANDOMIZED PATIENTS : Approximately  150 
patients in total will be random ized in this study.

 1 INTRODUCTION  
 
1.1 Background  
 
Coronavirus -19 (CoV):  Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae , in the family 
Coronaviridae , order Nidovirales , and realm Riboviria . They are enveloped viruses with a positive -
sense single -stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry. They are the largest 
among known RNA viruses. As of May 5, 2020, there have been at least 25,486 confirmed deaths 
and more than 3,646,206 confirmed cases in the β -coronavirus -19 (CoV) pandemic. CoV can cause 
physical dysfunction (frailty) and death from hyper -inflammation, cytokine storm, and associated 
acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and myocarditis with troponin leak, particularly in older 
or chronically -ill indiv iduals8. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a β -coronavirus that is related to 
CoV, which causes an epidemic murine illness with high mortality, especially among colonies of 
laboratory mice9. We previously found that cellular senescence leads to physical dysfunction 
(frailty) and hyper -inflammation (cytokine storm), factors that contribute to morbidity and mortality 
from CoV. We are currently conducting a clinical trial of Fisetin in elderly subjects for these 
indications, AFFIRM (Alleviation by Fisetin of Frailty, Inflammation, and Related Measures in 
Older Adults; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]; IND 134052).  
 
Longhauler Syndrome:  Initial reports from WHO -China in February describe d clinical recovery 
from time of onset of COVID symptoms to be between 2 -6 weeks, the latter being patients with 
more severe cases ( https://www.who.int/docs/default -source/coronaviruse/situation -
reports/20200306 -sitrep -46-covid -19.pdf?sfvrsn=96b04adf_4 ). As more information becomes 
available, patients are coming forward with experiences of  longer recovery times and lingering 
symptoms, Long Covid, Long -haul Covid, or Long -haulers10-12. Though largely undefined, “Long -
haulers” denotes patients who experience persistent symptoms after having acute COVID -19. While 
the full impact of long COVID is widely unknown, some sources are reporting upwards of 10% of 
patients experiencing symptoms lasting greater than 3 weeks12. An earlier study done in Italy 
showed that 87% of hospitalized patients reported at least one ongoing symptom 60 days after onset 
of first COVID -19 symptoms, with 55% of patients reporting 3 or more ongo ing symptoms13. These 
long lasting symptoms can occur in adults across all age groups, regardless of pre -existing 
conditions14. The long term sequelae of the virus are largely unknown, but early reports of 
significant lung damage15,16 and persistent myocardial inflammation17 are concerning, making the 
discovery of long term impact at the mechanistic level all the more urgent.  
 
Cellular Senescence:  Cellular senescence contributes to age -related dysfunction and multiple 
diseases throug hout the lifespan. Senescent cell burden is very low in young individuals but 
increases with aging in several tissues. These include adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, 
brain, bone, and skin5,18-24. Senescent cells accumulate at sites of pathology in multiple chronic 
diseases, including, among others,  the lungs in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, 
idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), and smoking, adipose and other tissues in diabetes/ obesity, the 
brain in Alzheimer’s and other dementias, and blood vessels and the heart in cardiovascular d isease.  
 
Senescent cells were discovered in 196125 when ser ially-subcultured human embryonic fibroblasts 
were shown to lose replicative capacity, yet remain viable. This prompted work to test if aging leads 
to accumulation in vivo  of pre -senescent cells, which have limited remaining replicative potential, 
and sene scent cells, which cannot replicate but are metabolically active. In 1979, this was reported 
to be true for fibroblasts in skin biopsied from older than younger subjects6 and by us in 1990, for 
primary adipocyte progenitors (preadipocytes) cloned from adipose tissue of rats across the age

 spectrum that had been raised under controlled conditions7. Senescent cells appear at pathogenic 
sites of many major diseases, including chronic lung disease, diabetes/ obesity, cardiovascular 
diseases, Alz heimer’s disease, cancers, osteoporosis, renal disease, and cirrhosis in preclinical 
species and humans5,21,23, conditions associated with physical dysfunction (frailty), inflammation, 
and CoV morbidity and mortality.  
 
Senescence is essentially a cell fate, like differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, or necrosis. 
External and internal signals can contribute to driving a cell into senescence. These are generally 
cell or tissue damage -related, including DNA alterations  (dysfunctional telomeres, strand breaks, 
etc.), metabolic dysfunction (reactive oxygen species [ROS], high glucose, bioactive lipids, 
mitochondrial dysfunction), protein alterations (aggregates, misfolding, failed autophagy), 
inflammatory signals, mechani cal/shear stress, pathogen -associated molecular pattern factors 
(PAMPs), including viruses, bacterial/fungal proteins, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), etc., damage -
associated molecular pattern factors (DAMPs; tissue damage signals [extracellular nucleotides, 
etc.]), cellular damage signals (DNA damage, telomeric dysfunction, protein aggregates, 
mitochondrial dysfunction), oncogenes, and mitogens (insulin -like growth factor -1, etc.). Once 
initiated, senescence takes 10 days to 6 weeks to become established through  transcription factor 
cascades (that may, but do not always, include p16INK4a/ retinoblastoma protein and/or p53/p21CIP1), 
causing extensive changes in gene expression, histone modifications, altered organelle function 
(e.g., mitochondria, endoplasmic reti culum, nucleolus, nuclear envelope), elevated protein 
production due to increased mTOR and decreased autophagy, and profound morphological and 
metabolic shifts21,26. After drug -induced removal, senescent cells take from 10 days to 6 weeks to re -
occur if cellular senescence inducers remain present, at least in vitro . 
 
There are no fully sensitive or specific markers for identifying senescent cells. These cells are 
generally large, may have high p16INK4a and/or p21CIP1 (but not always), and exhibit DNA damage 
foci, particularly in telomeres (telomere -associated DNA damage foci [TAFs]), senescence -
associated distention of pericentromeric satellite DNA, and increased sene scence -associated β -
galactosidase (SA -βGal)21. Like cancer cells, senescent cells frequently are metabolically -shifted 
from fatty acid utilization toward glycolysis, resulting in ROS generation, lipid accumulatio n, 
lipotoxicity, and dysdifferentiation into adipocyte -like but insulin -resistant “MAD” (mesenchymal 
adipocyte -like default) cells27. Senescent cells are resistant to apoptosis28. 
 
Senescent Cell Characteristics:  Cellular senescence leads to inflammation, fibrosis, DNA damage, 
mitochondrial dysfunction, ROS generation, NAD+ depletion, protein aggregation, failed autophagy, 
lipotoxicity, and stem and progenitor cell dysfunction. In turn, cellular senescence can be caused by 
other fundamental aging processes, including DNA damage, low NAD+, mitochondrial dysfunction, 
ROS, protein aggregates, and lipotoxicity. Thus, from our and others’ data, fundamental aging 
processes appear to be interlinked, findings that led us t o formulate a “Unitary Theory of 
Fundamental Aging Processes”, which posits that interventions, such as senolytics, targeting any one 
of these processes, such as cellular senescence, will affect many of the rest of the aging processes 
that predispose to ag ing phenotypes, frailty, hyper -inflammation, chronic diseases, and morbidity 
and mortality from acute insults, including viral infection. Effects of the study agent in our clinical 
trial will be ascertained not only on senescent cell abundance and effects,  but also on these other 
fundamental aging processes.  
 
Senescence -Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP):  Accumulation of senescent cells can cause 
local and systemic inflammation, tissue destruction, immune system inhibition, and stem and 
progenitor cell d ysfunction due to their SASP3,4,21,29,30. Gen erally 30 -70% of senescent cells develop

Version 4.0, 18NOV2021  
Page 11 of 57  
 a SASP that entails release of pro -inflammatory, pro -apoptotic cytokines (TNFα, IL -1α, IL -6, IL -7, 
IL-8, IFN, and many more), chemokines ( e.g., MCP -1, MIP1 -α, RANTES, RARRES2) that attract, 
activate, and anchor immune cells (including macrophages, dendritic cells, T -lymphocyte subsets, 
and neutrophils), tissue -destroying proteases (MMP -3, -9, -12, etc.), pro -coagulant factors (PAI -1, 
etc.), fac tors that impede stem cell/ progenitor function (Activin A, TGF -β-related proteins), ferritin, 
growth factors ( e.g., GCSF), bioactive lipids (bradykines, saturated ceramides, prostanoids), micro -
RNA’s (miRNA’s), tissue -damaging non -coding nucleotides (incl uding release of mitochondrial 
DNA, which attracts, activates, and anchors dendritic cells31), microvesicles including exosomes, 
and other factors that cause tissue necrosis, systemic inflammation, stem cell/ progenitor 
dysfunction, and spread of sene scence to non -senescent cells. These SASP factors include those that 
result in frailty, hyper -inflammation/ cytokine storm/ ARDS/ myocarditis with troponin leak in CoV 
patients8. 
 
Likely due to their SASP, only a small number of senescent cells can cause considerable 
dysfunction. In pre -clinical exp eriments, transplanting senescent cells around the knee joints of 
young mice was sufficient to induce an osteoarthritis -like phenotype, while transplanting non -
senescent cells did not32. Transplanting 106 radiation - or chemotherapy -induced senescent 
autologous ear fibroblasts or syngeneic adipocyte progenitors intraperitoneally into lean, adult mice, 
so that fewer than 1/10,000 of all cells in the transplanted mice were senescent, induced i mpaired 
physical function (frailty) and premature death due to early onset of the same age -related diseases 
that cause death in naturally -aged mice32. This also occurred after human senescent ( vs. non -
senescent) cells were  transplanted into immune -deficient (SCID) mice. When labelled senescent 
cells are transplanted intraperitoneally, they remained within the peritoneum, yet the transplant 
recipients developed non -labeled senescent cells in their limbs, demonstrating that s enescence can 
spread from cell to cell, even at a distance32. 
 
We established that adipose tissue from obese individuals have an increased burden of senescent 
adipocyte progenitors33. Furthermore, these  senescent cells have a potent pro -inflammatory SASP. 
This leads to the hypothesis that an older or obese individual or any other individual with an 
increased burden of senescent cells could be predisposed to frailty, hyper -inflammation/ cytokine 
storm/ AR DS/ myocarditis with troponin leak after CoV infection . 
 
Clearance of Senescent cells by the Immune System:  Senescent cells are usually cleared by the 
immune system34. They can attract, activate, and anchor immune cells, including macrophages, 
dendritic cells, T -lymphocytes, and neutrophils through such SASP chemokines as MCP -1, MIP1 -α, 
RANTES, and RARRES2, cytokines such as IL -6, and TNFα, extracellular mitochondrial DNA, 
possibly miRNAs, and other factors31,32,34,35. However, above a threshold burden, senescent cells 
interfere with the immune system and its ability to remove them. For example, IL -6, a SASP 
component, interferes wi th macrophage migration, MMPs can cleave FAS ligand and other immune 
cell surface proteins, senescent cells cause fibrosis (impeding immune cell infiltration and trapping 
immune cells within inflammatory foci), and senescent cells can express “don’t eat me ” signals34. 
Consistent with this, senescent cells can drive cancer initiation and progression, which senolytics 
are highly effective at preventing, with substantial delays in death from multiple forms of c ancer in 
mice5,32,36. Fisetin, which selectively clears senescent cells, delays death of older mice, 50% of which 
die from cancer, by over 17%36. 
 
Threshold Th eory of Senescent Cell Burden:  Based on the above, we formulated a “Threshold 
Theory of Senescent Cell Burden”, which holds that once senescent cell abundance is sufficient to 
cause spread of senescence that exceeds capacity of the immune system to keep up  with clearing

Page 12 of 57  
 these cells, an accelerated aging -like state ensues32,34. Consistent with this: 1) the number of 
senescent cells that needs to be transplanted to cause frailty, limit healthspan, and cause premature 
death, inclu ding from cancer , is higher in young than old mice and in young lean than young obese 
mice. Old mice or young, obese mice have more pre -existing senescent cells than young, lean 
mice32. 2) Senescent cell abundance remains  low in skin until early old age in humans, followed by 
an upward inflection in senescent cell burden in subjects who are in their late 60’s through the mid -
70’s37. This precedes the age -related increase in multi -morbidity38. 3) The lag between induction of 
senescence by chemotherapy and development of age -related morbidities is longer in childhood 
cancer survivors than adults who received higher chemotherapy doses in preparation for bone 
marrow transplantation39,40. These findings support the hypothesis that there is a threshold above 
which senescent cell burden due to spread of cellular senescence becomes self -amplifying. This 
causes increased risk for senescence - and age -related phenotypes, physical dysfunction/  frailty, 
hyper -inflammation, and diseases, perhaps contributing to age -related multi -morbidity38. Potentially, 
attraction, activation, and anchoring of immune cells is accelerated after senescent cells exceed this 
threshold, predisposing to excessive inflammation in frailty and during viral infection, plus 
continuing and  exacerbating production of the SASP factors that underlie frailty, hyper -
inflammation/ cytokine storm, ARDS, and cardiomyopathy, as occurs in fatal CoV cases , as well as 
subsequent fibrosis, e.g., of the lungs.  
 
Pathogen -Associated Molecular Profile Factors (PAMPs):  Of note, the SASP is modifiable: 
drugs, hormones, and especially the PAMPs associated with infections such as coronaviruses, can 
modify the SASP. We found that PAMPs can exacerbate the SASP in previously relatively quiescent 
human senescent cells by multiple fold (much greater than the effect of cytokines on the SASP), 
with greatly increased secretion of factors underlying cytokine storm (IL -6, IL -8, MCP -1) and 
increased attraction and activation of innate immune cells, potentially driving the frailty, hyper -
inflammation, cytokine storm, and ARDS caused by coronavirus (Fig. 1).  
 
 
 
Fig. 1. Senescent cells challenged with PAMPs highly express SASP factor mRNAs. Human 
subcutaneous adipocyte progenitors from different subjects were irra diated or not to generate senescent or

 proliferating cells, respectively (n=3). Then cells were treated with different concentrations of the prototype 
PAMP, LPS, for 3 hours before mRNA isolation. One -way ANOVA and Dunnett multiple comparison post -
tests we re performed against the control (0 ng) for each condition (proliferating or senescent). * = p<0.05, ** 
= p<0.01. Human non -senescent and radiation -induced senescent preadipocytes were treated with human 
recombinant IL -6, TNF -α, and IFN -γ for 3h.  
 
Similar results were obtained in vivo  when progeroid mice, which have senescent cells to the same 
extent and in the same tissues as aged mice, were challenged with the PAMP, LPS (Fig. 2). In two 
tissues examined (kidney and liver), levels of senescence markers ( p16Ink4, p21Cip1) and the SASP 
(Il1
 , Il6, TNF
  and Mcp1 ) were greater in the progeroid mice compared to age -matched 
controls, illustrating an amplification of the response to PAMPs in organisms with increased 
senescent cell burden. In another study focus ed on neuroprotection in the face of LPS challenge, rats 
were administered Fisetin 20 i.p. mg/kg/day x 14 days, while being challenged with LPS41. In 
Fisetin -treated animals, infla mmation and neurodegeneration were suppressed, while memory 
improved.  
 
Fig. 2. Pre -existing senescence causes an exaggerated response to pathogens in vivo . Eleven -week -old 
wild-type (blue) and progeroid Ercc1-/
 (red) mice were injected with 500 ng/kg of LPS or vehicle (PBS) i.p. 
(N=4/ group). Twenty -four hours post -injection, mice were euthanized and tissues were collected. Total RNA 
was isolated from tissues and senescence and SASP marker expression were quanti fied in the ( A) kidney and 
(B) liver by real -time qPCR using the ∆∆Ct method. Gapdh  was used as a control for gene expression 
analysis. ( C) Circulating levels of IL -6 and MCP -1 were quantified in serum by ELISA. All values represent

 the mean ± SD. Statisti cal significance was determined by two -way ANOVA. * p<0.05, ** p<0.01, *** 
p<0.001, ****p<0.0001. (unpublished data, M. Yousefzadeh, B. Hughes, P. Robbins, L. Niedernhofer).  
 
Amplifier/ Rheostat Hypothesis of Cellular Senescence:  The SASP depends on the ty pe of cell 
that became senescent, how senescence was induced, and its milieu . The SASP changes over time in 
response to internal ( e.g., transposons) and external cues ( e.g., PAMPs, DAMPs, glucocorticoids, 
SASP inhibitors such as rapamycin). PAMPs are parti cularly effective at exacerbating the SASP 
(Figs. 1&2), perhaps accounting for severe morbidity in previously highly -functioning elderly 
individuals with an increased (but quiescent) senescent cell burden that is activated by infections 
such as CoV or sept icemia. Based on these considerations, we advanced an “ Amplifier/ Rheostat 
Hypothesis” of cellular senescence: that the increased senescent cell burden in elderly and 
chronically ill patients contributes to their excessive, frailty/morbidity/mortality -inducing hyper -
inflammatory (cytokine storm) response to infections that have much less cytokine -inducing effects 
in younger, previously healthy people  (Fig. 3).  
 
 
 
Figure 3: Amplifier/Rheostat hyp othesis  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 3. SASP Amplifier/Rheostat Hypothesis.  Among the 
10 leading causes of mortality are influenza, pneumonia, 
genitourinary infections, and septicemia. The elderly and 
patients with cellular senescence -associated diseases 
(e.g., diabetes, dementias, smoking, asthma) are more 
susceptible to adverse  outcomes in response to infections 
(e.g., ARDS, cytokine storm, myocardial damage with 
troponin leak, delirium, hypotension, thrombosis, delayed 
recovery) and develop a more exaggerated inflammatory 
state than young patients without pre -existing chronic 
diseases. These adverse outcomes of infections in the 
elderly or patients with senescence -associated chronic 
diseases have generally been attributed to immune 
system dysfunction or to chronic inflammation. Our 
“Amplifier/ Rheostat” Hypothesis is that PAMPs (e.g., LPS, 
viral antigens) cause a shift in the SASP of pre -existing 
senescent cells (SC) into a highly inflammatory, pro -
apoptotic, pro -fibrotic SASP. This may not only exacerbate 
acute systemic inflammatory responses and cytokine 
release by innate immun e system cells (macrophages, 
dendritic cells, T lymphocyte subsets, neutrophils), but 
could also amplify spread of senescence to other cells. 
The resulting additional senescent cells may act to 
exacerbate and prolong inflammation, attenuate or delay 
recove ry, lead to persistent frailty, cause long term tissue 
fibrosis if the afflicted individual survives long enough, 
and contribute to multi -organ failure (L. Langhi, T. 
Tchkonia, J.L. Kirkland, October, 2018; unpublished).

 ß-Coronavirus Causes Infected Non -Senescent Cells to become Senescent:  We found that mice 
infected with a mouse ß -coronavirus closely related to human COVID -19 develop increased 
senescent cell burden (Fig. 4). Similarly, human cells exposed to COVID -19 Spike -1 antigen or 
infected with an attenuated SARS -COVID -19 virus become  senescent, as manifest by increased 
cellular SA -βGal (Fig. 5). 
 
 
Fig. 4:  Specific pathogen -free (SPF) mice exposed to a normal microbial experience (NME) that includes 
acute mouse ß -coronavirus infection develop an increased abundance of senescent cell. Young (3 -month -old) 
and old (20 -24-month -old) male and female WT mice were exposed to NME bedding produced from pet 
store mice for 7 days. Abundance of p16Ink4a and p21Cip1 senescent cells was assayed in the liver, lung, and 
kidney of SPF or NME young and old mice. The ß -coronavirus -infected old mice had a particularly marked 
increase in senescent cell burden, with trends evident even in younger mice. Two -way ANOVA. *p<0.05, 
**p<0.01, ***p<0.001.

Senolytics:  In 2004 Sharpless et al.42 showed that senescent cell accumulation is delayed in Ames 
dwarf mice (with pituitary hormone deficiencies) and calorically -restricted mice, models with 
increased healthspan and lifespan. This was critical in prompting us to test the hypothesis that 
targe ting senescent cells may alleviate multiple age -related disorders. Our efforts to discover 
senolytics, drugs that selectively eliminate senescent cells, began in 2004/5, with initial attempts to 

COVFIS-HOME : COVID -19 PILOT STUDY  OF FISETIN  TO ALLEVIATE DYSFUNCTION  AND DECREASE COMPLICATIONS  
Version 4.0, 18NOV2021  
Page 16 of 57  
 create fusion proteins comprising a senescent cell surface -binding domain coupled to a toxin, high 
throughput compound library screens for candidates that eliminate senescent but not non -senescent 
cells, and other approaches. These traditional approaches were not initially successful, so we turned 
to a hypothesis -driven discovery paradigm to discover the first senolytic drugs21,43 ,44. We 
hypothesized that since senescent cells kill cells around them and damage tissues due to the ir 
inflammatory, apoptotic SASP, yet these senescent cells do not die, they must have pro -survival 
networks that defend them against their own SASP: senescent cell anti -apoptotic pathways 
(SCAPs)5,43-45. 
 
From proteomic/transcriptomic databases and using bio -informatics methods, we discovered the 
SCAP network43. Through RNA interference analyses, we demonstrated that transiently disabling 
this SCAP network leads to apoptosis of senesce nt cells, while normal cells without a SASP are not 
affected, the “Achilles’ heel” of senescent cells. We next used bioinformatics approaches to identify 
drugs and natural products that act on critical SCAP nodes. Among these are Fisetin, Quercetin (Q), 
Dasatinib (D), and now over 20 others. We found these agents selectively eliminate senescent cells 
in mice and humans. They alleviate multiple conditions in mice, including diabetes and its 
complications, cardiovascular disorders (including heart failure and  vascular dysfunction), 
dementias, pulmonary dysfunction (including bleomycin -induced lung disease), diabetes and its 
complications, frailty, kidney and liver damage or dysfunction, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, and 
delay cancer and extend healthspan and l ifespan5,21-24. 
 
We intentionally selected drugs for further development from among those identified as being 
senolytic. We focused on drugs that: 1) were already FDA -approved or were natural products with a 
history of safe huma n use, 2) could be administered orally, and 3) have a short elimination half -life 
(T½). Fisetin met these criteria. It is a natural product with a favorable safety profile, is effective 
orally, and has an elimination T½ ~3 hours, meaning it is cleared with in a half day.  
 
The target of senolytics  is senescent cells, not a single receptor, enzyme, or biochemical pathway. 
By targeting pro -survival networks instead of single molecules, specificity for senescent cells can be 
increased, side -effect profiles flattened, and off -target effects on non -senescent cells reduced. Drugs 
that have single or limited targets, such as Navitoclax (ABT -263), which we discovered is senolytic 
at the same time as another group46,47, or Nutlin3a, have off -target apoptotic effects on multiple non -
senesce nt cell types, making them “panolytic”. Navitoclax, a BCL -2/ BCL -w/ BCL -xL inhibitor, 
eliminates only a restricted range of senescent cells, e.g., BCL -2 inhibitors are not senolytic against 
human adipocyte progenitors, one of the most abundant senescent ce ll types in aged humans or 
people with diabetes and obesity. Our strategies for developing senolytics have more in common 
with approaches for developing antibiotics than the conventional one -target/one -drug/one -disease 
drug development approach.  
 
Descripti on of the population to be studied . Adult women and men with PCR positive SARS -
CoV -2 infection , will be screened for inclusion in this study. Subjects who meet screening criteria 
will be randomized to receive Fisetin 20 mg/kg/day orally (capsules or powder  dissolved in water or 
added to apple sauce, pudding, or yogurt) or by nasogastric (NG -tube) or transabdominal duodenal 
tube (D -tube; powder dissolved in water within 30 minutes , to achieve transient, high tissue Fisetin 
levels in a “hit -and-run” approach or placebo for 2 days (Days 0 -1 and 8-9) and will be followed 
until study Day 30 or death. Subjects will continue to be followed  for 2  months. The primary 
outcome is need for hospitalization and death with COVID -19. Secondary outcomes will be 
assessment for long hauler syndrome . Buccal swabs, urine and stool  tests will be conducted before 
and after initiating treatment with Fisetin or placebo  serially.

 1.1 Investigational Product (IP)  
An IP is defined as a pharmaceutica l form of an active substance or placebo being tested or used as a 
reference in a clinical study, including products already with a marketing authorization but used or 
assembled (formulated or packaged) differently than the authorized form, or used for an 
unauthorized indication, or when used to gain further information about the authorized form. The IP 
will be stored in a secure area according to local regulations. Investigators will have responsibility 
for ensuring that IP is only dispensed to study subje cts. The IP (Fisetin and placebo) will be 
dispensed only by authorized personnel according to regulations that apply at Mayo Clinic 
Rochester. In this protocol, the IP are Fisetin and placebo.  
 
Fisetin:  Fisetin  is a member o f the flavonoid family, a family of 
naturally -occurring polyphenolic compounds. As a natural product, it is widely sold, including by 
Amazon, from which it is available in containers of 30 capsules of 100 mg Fisetin/ capsule at <$20 
per container. The stru cture of Fisetin is similar to that of Q, which is one of the first two senolytic 
drugs discovered43 (Fig. 6). Fisetin, a high Trolox -equivalent antioxidant, is present in many fruits 
and vegetables such as apples, persimmon, g rapes, onions, and cucumbers, with the highest 
concentration found in strawberries (160 µg/g)48,49 (Fig. 7).  The average dietary intake of naturally -
occurring Fisetin was approximately 0.8 mg/day in an earlier Japanese study50,51. However, the 
average total intake of polyphenols, comprised mainly of flavonoids, is around 1 gram per day, 
although it may be quite variable52-54. Fisetin has little or no odor or taste.  
 
Due to its being a hydrophobic compound, Fisetin easily penetrates c ell membranes, entering into 
cells to exert antioxidative and other effects55,56. Other promising biological activities include anti -
hyperlipidemic56-58, anti -inflammatory57, neurotrophic, apoptotic59, and antiproliferative effects36. 
 
There are reports of genotoxicity due to some flavonols, but Fisetin may exert little or no genotoxic 
effects in vivo60. Indeed, Fisetin has been noted to be anticarcinogenic48,61,62. We found that chronic 
Fisetin administration delays cancer in mice and increases remaining lifespan in old mice by over 
17%63. Since up to 50% of most mouse strains die from cancers, this suggests that the beneficial 
effects of Fisetin on such pro -carcinogenic factors as senescent cell burden and tissue chronic 
inflammation appear to more than counteract any theoretical effects of flavonol -associated 
genotoxicity. In the same mouse study, Fisetin was administered to a murine model of a human 
progeroid syndrome63. These mice are profoundly sensitive to genotoxic agents64, yet their health 
and lifespan were improved by long -term, high dose Fisetin63. 
 
Fig. 6. Structure of the senolytic flavonol, Q.  
Quercetin, one of the first tw o senolytic drugs 
identified (along with Dasatinib [D]), and 
which is present in apple peels, has a bitter taste 
and is less bioavailable and has a longer 
elimination T½ than Fisetin.  
Fig. 7. Structure of Fisetin.  Fisetin differs from Q 
by an hydroxyl group. It has little or no odor or 
taste. Its terminal T½ in mice is ~3.1 hrs1. This short 
half-life makes Fisetin ideal as a senolytic drug to 
ablate pro -inflammatory, pro -apoptotic, non -
dividing senescent cells in a “hit -and-run” fashion5.

 Fisetin is available as a dietary supplement. Other flavonols such as Q have been safely used in 
clinical trials in amounts up to 500 mg twice dail y for up to 8 weeks. To date, no reports of 
significant toxicity for Fisetin in vivo  have been made. Since Fisetin along with other flavones and 
flavonoids, has been shown to inhibit cytochrome P450 2C9, CYP3A4, and others (Section 3.9.4), 
precaution will be taken to avoid significant drug -drug interactions, e.g., with warfarin65. 
 
We demonstrated that Fisetin is a senolytic agent and alleviates multiple senescence -associated 
disorders in mice, decreases physical dysfunction if administered to old mice, attenuates age -related 
tissue damage and pathology, and extends remaining lifespan b y 17%44,63. We have not found any 
adverse effects in mice (at up to 25 times the dose used in the mouse effectiveness studies [below] or 
the dose for humans proposed here), old Rhesus  monkeys (at up to 5 times the dose for humans 
proposed here), or humans so far. We obtained a full IND for Fisetin from the FDA and have a GMP 
drug supply handled by Mayo Research Pharmacy.  
 
Fisetin 100 mg capsules or Fisetin (with cellulose) powder (in water, other chilled or room -
temperature drinks, apple sauce, pudding, yogurt, or enteral hydration/ nutrition solutions ) will be 
administered or ally for 2 consecutive days on study Days 0 and 1. To reduce senescent cell 
abundance by a “hit -and-run” approach, the full daily doses of Fisetin will be administered within 30 
minutes. The investigational supplies will be obtained from Vital Nutrients, a  contracted GMP 
manufacturer. Fisetin capsules supplied by Vital Nutrients are opaque blue in color. Fisetin powder 
is a green yellow color. We established stability parameters for Fisetin in collaboration with Mayo 
Clinic’s Department of Laboratory Medici ne and Pathology. We acquired an IND for Fisetin after 
establishing botanical sourcing, GMP isolation by Vital Nutrients, assurance of lack of 
contaminating pesticides, heavy metals, and solvents, and stability, degradation, and accelerated 
toxicity testin g. 
1.2 Preclinical Data  
In our article about the first senolytics  discovered, we demonstrated D+Q reduces senescent cell 
burden in multiple tissues and improves function in naturally -aged animals43. Since then, D+Q, 
Fisetin (which is closely related to Q), Navitoclax, and other  senolytics have been shown to alleviate 
multiple diseases and disorders in animal models (Table 1). Among effects are: restoration of 
mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) function; improved cardiac ejection fraction, fractional shortening, 
and regeneration in old mice; enhanced vascular reactivity in old mice, decreased vascular 
calcification and restored vascular reactivity in hypercholesterolemic, high fat -fed ApoE-/- mice; 
decreased loss of intervertebral disc glycosaminoglycans and spondylosis in progeroid Ercc 1-/Δ 
mice; decreased gait disturbance in mice following radiation damage to a leg and hematological 
dysfunction caused by whole body radiation; decreased age -related changes of skin; improved 
pulmonary function and reduced pulmonary fibrosis in mice with b leomycin -induced lung damage, a 
model of IPF, plus decreases in: liver fibrosis in Mdr-/- cirrhotic mice; insulin resistance, hepatic 
steatosis, and renal dysfunction in high fat -fed mice; neuropsychiatric dysfunction and impaired 
neurogenesis in high fat -fed mice; neuro -inflammation, impaired neurogenesis, microvascular 
impairment, and cognitive dysfunction in mouse models of dementia; age -related osteoporosis; 
uterine fibrosis; physical frailty; and muscle weakness in naturally -aged, progeroid, radiated, and 
senescent cell -transplanted young mice as well as delayed cancer and increased healthspan and 
lifespan in old mice5,20-23,32,35,43,47,66 -73.

Most studies of senolytics  for various disease 
states, including in humans, have been with D+Q 
since D and Q were the first senolytics. However, 
while D+Q is relatively safe, it is likely not as 
safe as Fisetin for very ill patients. Unlike Fisetin, 
D cannot be administered safely to patients with a 
prolonged QTc (>450 msec). Many elderly and 
chronically -ill patients have a prolonged QTc, 
meaning they would be excluded from studies 
involving treatment with D. Additionally, there 
are multiple other drug interactions with D that 
would  result in fewer patients being able to be 
treated than with Fisetin. Navitoclax has a poorer safety profile than Fisetin or D+Q: unlike D, 
which was approved by the FDA in 2006, Navitoclax has failed to gain FDA approval so far as a 
generally -available pr escription drug, largely because of extensive and unpredictable induction of 
apoptosis in non -senescent cell types. For example, Navitoclax can cause life -threatening 
neutropenia or hemorrhage due to platelet depletion. Fisetin so far has had an exceptiona l safety 
profile in our clinical trials for elderly patients with multi -morbidity. Therefore, we decided to 
analyze Fisetin here rather than D+Q or Navitoclax.  
 
“Hit and run”:  D+Q or Fisetin are effective if administered once every few days or weeks since 
they do not need to be continuously present to occupy a receptor or interfere with an enzyme, 
reducing off -target effects.  Brief disruption of pro -survival pathways is sufficient to kill senescent 
cells in mouse and human cell cultures, in vivo  in mice and monkeys, and in human adipose explants 
freshly -isolated from obese subjects21,43,63,68. In mice, monthly D+Q is as effective as daily 
administration to alleviate age -related osteoporosis95, reducing potential side -effects. These points, 
together with satisfying a modified set of Koch’s postulates (Table 2), show that senolytics alleviate Condition  Reference

Senescence can contribute to loc al and systemic 
inflammation, dysfunction, and spread of senescence 
through release of cytokines, chemokines, proteases, 
ferritin, stem cell/progenitor toxins, reactive metabolites, 
miRNA’s, mitochondrial DNA, other nucleotides, and 
extracellular vesicles,  the SASP2-4. Pre-senescent cells, 
which have limited remaining replicative potential, and 
senescent cells, which cannot replicate, accumulate to a 
greater extent in vivo  in skin biopsies from older than 
younger subjects6. Senescent and pre -senescent adipocyte 
progenitors cloned from adipose tissue increase with aging 
in rats raised under cont rolled conditions7. Senolytics have 
been shown to alleviate many of these conditions by us 
(bold ) and others.

 dysfunction by removing senescent cells,  not other off -target mechanisms. Unlike microbes or 
cancer cells, since senescent cells do not divide, they are unlikely to acquire replication -dependent 
drug resistance. Fisetin is well -suited for a “hit -and-run” administration protocol since it has an 
elimination T½ of ~3 hours, we demonstrated that it takes only 30 minutes of exposure of human 
tissues for senolytics to initiate the apoptosis process32, and senescent cells take over 1 week to re -
accumulate. Of note, no steady state levels for Fisetin need to be achieved and the goal is to 
eliminate senescent cells in a “hit -and-run” fashion, not to achieve a steady state blood level. The 
critical outcome here is target engagement, i.e., do we kill senescent cells?, not do we achieve a 
particular drug or tissue level? Therefore, as in our other trials, traditional blood pharmacokinetic 
parameters will not be assayed. Rather, the critical pharmacodynamic measure, senescent cell 
abundance, will be assayed.  This approach has been tacitly agreed to by the FDA regarding our 
other clinical trials of senolytics, including with Fisetin.  
 
Table 2. A Modified Set of Koch’s Postulates  
To establish causation:  
• Are senescent cells present in animals or humans with the diso rder?  
• Do individuals without senescent cells have the disorder?  
• Is the disorder reproduced by inducing local accumulation of senescent cells ( e.g., by transplanting 
senescent cells, focal irradiation, or tissue -specific genetic approaches)?  
• Does remo ving these transplanted or induced senescent cells prevent or alleviate the disorder?  
• Does targeting naturally -occurring senescent cells alleviate the disorder?  
• Does administering the potentially senolytic candidate have few or no effects related to th e disorder 
being tested in individuals with few or no senescent cells ( e.g., young mice)?  
• Does the potentially senolytic candidate alleviate the condition if given intermittently, at intervals 
longer than the drug’s half -life, since senescent cells can t ake 10 days to 6 weeks to re -accumulate (at 
least in culture)? In the case of D+Q, senolytic drugs are as effective if administered monthly as 
continuously, at least in the case of age -related osteoporosis95. 
• Does the candidate alleviate multiple age -related conditions? (If a candidate is truly senolytic and the 
Geroscience Hypothesis is true, then it should alleviate multiple age - and chronic disease -related 
disorders).  
 
The above criteria have been met for senolytic drugs for frailty, diabetes, and age -related 
osteoporosis and many have been met for osteoarthritis and neurodegenerative diseases in mic e. 
 
Fisetin selectively causes apoptosis of human cultured senescent cells:  Fisetin reduces viability 
of 30 -70% of senescent human umbilical endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro44 (Fig. 8). Note that 
30-70% elimination of senescent cells was achieved in our INK-ATTAC  mice by activating the 
suicide gene expressed only in p16Ink4a+ cells (many or most of which are senescent) in these 
mice114. This extent of elimination was sufficient to alleviate multiple age -related conditions in 
chronologically -aged and progeroid mice20,67,68,114.

 Fisetin selectively eliminates senescent cells from monkeys:  Fig. 11.  
 
Fisetin alleviates cellular senescence -related phenotypes and extends healthspan and lifespan 
in mice:  Ercc1−/∆ mice, which model human XFE progeria, have features resembling accelerated 
aging, with a lifespan of 6 months115. They develop progressive age -related chronic degenerative 
diseases116 and accumul ate senescent cells in the same tissues as aged wild -type mice, albeit more 
rapidly117. To track senescent cell abundance in vivo , Ercc1−/∆ mice were crossed with p-16-luc 
transgenic mice. p-16-luc mice express luciferase under the control of the p16Ink4a promotor (p16Ink4a 
is increased in many or most senescent cells). After administering luciferin i.v., p16Ink4+ cells 
expressing the transgene emit light and can be seen and quantified in vivo  using a light -detection 
box. The light signal (radiance) indicates the intensity a nd location of p16Ink4+ cells. Note that oral 
exposure to Fisetin at this dose, which is higher than that proposed for our human studies, does not 
cause toxicity even in these frail mice. There were no adverse effects on mobility, feeding, 
appearance, or w eight.  
 
Fisetin decreased senescent cell burden in Ercc1-/∆; p16 -luc mice as determined by decreased 
radiance (Fig. 12). Ercc1-/∆; p16 -luc mice on C57Bl/6 Albino:FVB  background at 3-4 weeks of age 
were fed ad libitum  with a standard Teklad 2020 chow diet (“Lifespan” diet; N=15) or the standard 
Teklad 2020 chow diet  containing Fisetin 500 ppm (N=2).  Fisetin 60 mg/kg/day was consumed by 
each mouse based on Fisetin 500 ppm (500 mg/kg) being in the diet and 3 -5 g chow eaten/ day. 
Senescent cell burde n was measured at baseline and biweekly in control (lifespan) and Fisetin -
treated mice. Imaging of luciferase activity indicates a significant decrease in senescence signal.

Idea generation:  The generation of this study began with our Amplifier/ Rheostat Hypothesis (Fig. 
3), which we validated in September, 2018 by testing if PAMPs exac erbate the SASP (Fig. 1). 
Together with the finding that coronavirus causes deaths from cytokine storm/ ARDS, we 
formulated the hypothesis that the senolytic drug, Fisetin (Fig. 7), could alleviate complications of 
coronavirus due to an excessive inflammat ory reaction in February, 2020. This led us to search for a 
mouse model of coronavirus. Our collaborators at the U of M had an infected colony and had done 
an experiment in December, 2019 showing that young mice survive, but old mice die beginning 7 
days a fter exposure to the mouse β -coronavirus, Mouse Hepatits Virus (MHV; Fig. 4) and develop 
high circulating IL -6, unlike infected young mice (Fig. 5). We administered Fisetin vs. vehicle to old 
mice and sent them to the MHV -infected colony at U of M (Fig. 17). We and our collaborators 
discovered that Fisetin substantially increased survival of β -coronavirus -infected old mice  (Figs. 18, 
20, &22).  
 
Aged, infected prevention results : We conducted an experiment in which 10 male and 10 female 
mice >24 months old, equivalent to humans aged >80 years, were administered Fisetin 20 mg/kg as 
daily pulse doses by oral gavage for 2 days and 10 control >24 month old male and 10 female mice 
were administered vehicle at Mayo Clinic. After 2 more days, the mice were moved from Mayo

 Clinic to the mouse β -coronavirus -contaminated facility at U of M. Since they fight, the males were 
placed in bedding in which infected male mice had been housed. The f emales were placed directly in 
contact with contaminated female mice, and so had a much higher exposure than the males. 
Similarly to the male experiment, in a second experiment, 10 female mice pretreated with Fisetin 
and 10 female mice with vehicle at Mayo  Clinic were placed in bedding in which infected female 
mice had been housed. Those mice pretreated with Fisetin or vehicle by gavage before being 
transferred from Mayo Clinic to the infected colony at U of M were administered Fisetin 500 ppm or 
vehicle, r espectively, in food while they were in the contaminated facility (Fig. 17).  
 
Fig. 17. Mouse coronavirus Fisetin experiment design.  
 
All of  the 20 vehicle -treated mice in the first experiment died within 12 days of pathogen exposure. 
However, 5 of the 20 Fisetin -treated bedding -exposed male (p<0.0001) and infected mouse -exposed 
female mice (p=0.2) were still alive after 15 days of continuous infection exposure plus a further 12 
days after being switched to clean bedding at Day 16 (Fig. 18). In the second experiment (Fig. 20), 
all of the 10 vehicle -treated bedding -exposed female mice died within 10 days of infection exposure. 
However, 7 of the 10 Fisetin -treated female mice were still alive (p<0.0002) after 13 days of 
continuous infection exposure. Thus, Fisetin prevents mortality in old mice caused by viral exposure 
that includes the mouse β -coronavirus. All mice tested had blood test -proven mo use β -coronavirus 
infection. Tests for multiple other pathogens were negative.  
 
 
Fig. 18. Survival of male mice exposed to bedding contaminated with mouse β -coronavirus is increased 
substantially by Fisetin. (A)  Old male mice (age>24 months; N=10) were ad ministered Fisetin 20 
mg/kg/day as daily pulse doses, and 10 control old male mice vehicle, by oral gavage beginning 4 days before 
being transported from Mayo Clinic to a contaminated facility at U of M, where they were exposed to 
bedding from β -coronaviru s-infected mice. Males cannot be exposed directly to infected mice because they 
fight. At the U of M facility, the Fisetin -treated mice were maintained on a Fisetin 500 ppm diet and the 
vehicle -treated mice were fed regular chow. Male mice treated with Fis etin had a significant improvement in

 survival vs. vehicle -treated old male mice in this prevention study (p < 0.0001; log -rank Mantel Cox test). (B) 
Old female mice (age >24 months; N=10) were also administered Fisetin at Mayo Clinic beginning 4 days 
before being transported to U of M and exposed directly to infected female mice (likely resulting in a much 
higher viral load than in the males described  above that were exposed only to infected bedding). The females 
exposed directly to infected female mice tended to have better survival vs. vehicle -treated old female mice 
(N=10; p=0.2). Of note, by day 11, when the vehicle -treated mice had died, the only pathogen that the female 
co-housed mice had antibodies against was the mouse β -coronavirus, MHV (Fig. 19).  
 
 
 
 
Fig. 20. Fisetin increases survival of female mice exposed to bedding contaminated with mouse β -
coronavirus.  As for males in the above experiment (Fig. 20), old female mice (age >24 months; N=10) were 
administered Fisetin 20 mg/kg/day as daily pulse doses or vehicle (N=10) by oral gavage beginning 4 days 
before being transported from Mayo to the contaminated facility at U of M, where they were continuously 
exposed to bedding from β -coronavirus -infected mic e. At the U of M facility, Fisetin -treated mice were fed 
Fisetin 500 ppm chow and vehicle -treated mice were fed regular chow. Like males, female mice treated with 
Fisetin had significant improvement in survival vs. vehicle -treated mice in this prevention s tudy (p < 0.0002; 
log-rank Mantel Cox test).  
 
Aged, infected treatment results:  In this experiment, we tested if Fisetin intervention in old mice 
after they have been infected and as they become symptomatic slows death is underway. Old mice 
(24 months) were transferred from Mayo Clinic to the contaminated facility at U of M and, 3 da ys 
after introduction to that facility from Mayo Clinic (study Day 0), were treated for 3 consecutive 
days with Fisetin 20 mg/kg/day as daily pulse doses vs. vehicle by gavage on study Days 3 to 5, 10 
to 12, and 17 (Figs . 21&22). After each series of high daily Fisetin doses by gavage, they were 
maintained on Fisetin 500 ppm in food or regular chow, respectively, on study Days 6 to 9 and 13 to 
16. 
Fig. 1 9. Fisetin increases the antibody response of 
old female mice co -housed with mouse β -
coronavirus -infected mice . Old female mice (24 
months)  had less antibody response against 
coronavirus than young mice by 11 days after both 
groups were co -housed with mice infected with 
mouse β -coronavirus. However, at Day 16, the 24 -
month old female mice treated with Fisetin (as in Fig. 
17) had an antibody r esponse similar in magnitude to 
the young mice. All old female mice treated with 
vehicle had died by Day 16. Thus, Fisetin treatment 
does not prevent antibody response of old mice to 
coronavirus infection and allows time for the older 
mice to develop an an tibody response similar to that 
of young mice.

mortality in old mice.  
 
Fig. 22. Fisetin treatment slows death of old mice infected with β -coronavirus. (A)  Male 24 month old 
mice were transported from Mayo Clinic to the mouse β -coronavirus contaminated colony at U of M, 
depicted here as Day 0. All mice were expo sed to bedding used by infected male mice. Beginning 3 days after 
transfer from Mayo Clinic, they were treated for 3 days with Fisetin 20 mg/kg/day as daily pulse doses vs. 
vehicle by oral gavage (N=10 mice/ group) on Days 4 to 6. On Days 7 to 9, the Fiset in-treated mice were fed 
with chow containing Fisetin 500 ppm and the vehicle -treated mice were fed chow only. On Days 10 to 12 
and 13 to 16, animals were treated with Fisetin 20 mg/kg as daily pulse doses vs. vehicle by oral gavage on 
Days 10 to 12 and 13  (all vehicle -treated mice were dead at Day 14). On Day 17 animals were treated with 
Fisetin 20 mg/kg as daily pulse doses. (B) Female 24 month old mice were treated in the same way. Fisetin 
significantly increased survival of β -coronavirus -infected mice ( males: p < 0.0001; females: p < 0.001; log -
rank Mantel Cox test).  
 
Fisetin treatment of old, β -coronavirus -infected mice slowed death in an experiment close to the 
clinical study design planned here (Fig. 22). Of note, in separate, parallel studies in whic h animals 
were euthanized after cohousing or exposure to dirty bedding, transmission of MHV was 100% and 
antibodies against the virus were detected by day 11 (Fig. 19). No antibodies to other common 
mouse pathogens were detectible.  
1.3 Clinical Data to Date  
Senescent cell clearance from humans:  In the first clinical study published about senolytics, a 

COVFIS-HOME : COVID -19 PILOT STUDY  OF FISETIN  TO ALLEVIATE DYSFUNCTION  AND DECREASE COMPLICATIONS  
Version 4.0, 18NOV2021  
Page 29 of 57  
 pilot, open -label study in 14 patients with IPF, we found that 9 pulse -doses of oral D+Q over 3 
weeks led to improved 6 -minute walk distance, walking speed , ability to rise from a chair, and short 
physical performance battery by 5 days after the final dose119. These results led to initiation of a 
Phase IIb randomized, placebo -controlled, double -blind trial that is currently underway.  
 
Interim results of a Phase 1, open -label, clinical trial of D+Q for subjects with diabetic kidney 
disease (DKD) underway at Mayo (Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) showed a 3 day 
oral course of D+Q administered as pulse doses in 9 subjects with DKD reduced adipose tissue 
senescent cell burden assayed by p16INK4a+ and SA -βGal+ cells by 11 days after the last dose, 
compared to biopsies before D+Q administration76. A composite score of 10 circulating SASP 
factors was significantly decreased 11 days af ter completing the 3 day D+Q intervention. 
Furthermore, activated CD68+ macrophage tissue infiltration was significantly decreased. This trial 
is continuing (goal=30) to test effects of senolytics on adipose tissue and skin senescent cell 
abundance  and uri ne SASP factors, metabolic and renal function, inflammation, quality of life, 
safety (drug toxicity), and tolerability. No serious drug side effects have emerged so far. Evidence 
continues to show clearance of senescent cells. Each subject will be followed  for 4 months after the 
single course of D+Q to provide data for a larger Phase IIb randomized, placebo -controlled, double -
blind trial of senolytics for DKD.  
 
The senolytic drug to be used in our study here is Fisetin. We found that frailty in elderly wome n is 
associated with senescent cell burden and the associated inflammation in adipose tissue biopsies98. 
Furthermore, senolytics alleviated frailty in the subjects in our IPF trial120. Therefore, a Phase IIb 
double -blind, placebo -controlled clinical trial of Fisetin to reduce senescent cell burden and alleviate 
frailty and inflammation, AFFIRM, has commenced. Oral Fisetin 20 mg/kg/day for 2 days vs. 
placebo is being administered as dai ly pulsed doses for frailty (gait speed <0.8 m/sec) and 
inflammation in elderly women with multi -morbidity. This trial at Mayo Clinic is FDA -approved 
(Study Registry ID: [REMOVED]) and has enrolled over 20 subjects who have received 
Fisetin o r placebo. The trial is not yet unblinded. No participants have had severe or serious adverse 
events so far at the same doses of Fisetin as proposed here for the same indications, clearing 
senescent cells and alleviating physical dysfunction and inflammati on (in CoV patients).  
 
1.4 Dose Rationale  
Others have treated mice with Fisetin 50 mg/kg/day for weeks without evidence of toxicity121. We 
treated 4 male and 4 female 8 mo nth old C57/Bl6 mice with Fisetin 500 mg/kg/day (25 -fold higher 
than the dose to be used in this clinical trial) by oral gavage for 2 consecutive days compared to 4 
male and 4 female mice treated with vehicle. We found no evidence of substantial toxicity, as 
assessed by monitoring activity, food intake, and respiratory quotient in metabolic cages 
(Comprehensive Laboratory Animal Monitoring System, Columbus Instruments) for 48 hours after 
the last Fisetin dose. We administered 100 mg/kg/day for 2 consecutive  days by mouth  as daily 
pulse doses, 5 times the dose proposed in in this clinical trial, to 2 older Rhesus  monkeys (ages 19 
and 28 years, which is old for this species) at the National Primate Center. In over 1 month of close 
monitoring, neither monkey ha d adverse effects such as reduced appetite, altered activity, vomiting, 
or diarrhea. Acknowledging the higher rates of drug metabolism in mice compared to humans and 
differences in physiology between non -human primates and humans, in an effort to avoid sid e 
effects, a daily dose of ~20 mg/kg was selected here. We verified that this dose is sufficient to 
reduce senescent cell burden in mice. Our studies in very old coronavirus -infected mice 
demonstrated that this dose of Fisetin dramatically enhances surviva l (Figs. 18, 20, and 22).

Page 30 of 57  
 1.5 Risks and Benefits  
There are appear few if any risks of Fisetin at the doses to be used that we have evidence for, 
provided the subjects meet the exclusion criteria in the protocol regarding medications that Fisetin 
could interfere with. We have not seen serious or severe ad verse events so far in elderly frail women 
enrolled in our AFFIRM studies from Fisetin 20 mg/ kg/ day for 2 consecutive days in the over 20 
subjects randomized to Fisetin or placebo. We did not see adverse effects such as altered food 
intake, weight, or be havior in old Rhesus  macaques given 5 times the dose proposed here or in mice 
given 25 times the dose.  
 
Based on our studies in mice, there may be decreased morbidity and mortality due to β -coronavirus 
infection after Fisetin administration. All subjects i n this study will be elderly (and/or chronically -
ill) and hospitalized with mild or moderate CoV infection that could progress to severe or critical 
disease. The potential benefit to individual subjects in this trial and other people might be large.  
 
In this study, we will examine the effect of oral/ enteral Fisetin as a senolytic agent in humans, 
which may have immense potential for and reducing frailty/ physical dysfunction and inflammation 
and alleviating morbidity and mortality from CoV or other infecti ons in older subjects and those 
with other conditions and diseases associated with accumulation of senescent cells. As an additional, 
advantageous, off -target effect, removal of senescent cells may allow for functional improvement of 
neighboring or distant  tissues and cells, including MSC’s, accelerating recovery. We found that 
senolytics restore function of MSC’s20,73. Our collaborator, G. Ellis on, working with investigators in 
China, noted that transplanting normal MSC’s can alleviate symptoms and signs in severely ill CoV -
infected patients122. Thus, an additional benefit of senolytics for CoV could be alleviation of stem 
cell and progenitor dysfunction.  
 
Based upon review of the publishe d literature and our pre -clinical data, we do not anticipate the 
occurrence of serious adverse events with the prescribed regimen in this study. We have identified a 
variety of drug -drug interactions ( e.g., current use of warfarin) for which we established  exclusion 
criteria or modification plans to minimize associated risks. We could find no reports of Fisetin 
toxicity in the literature. Some flavonols have been associated with DNA damage in vitro , but 
Fisetin exerts little or no genotoxic effects60. To the contrary, Fisetin has been noted to be 
anticarcinogenic48,61,62. Indeed , we found that chronic Fisetin administration delays cancer in mice 
and increases remaining lifespan in old  mice as well as DNA damage/ genotoxicity highly -prone 
Ercc1-/Δ mice by over 17%63. Since up to 50% of most mouse strains die from cancers, this shows 
that the beneficial effects of Fisetin on such pro -carcinogenic factors  as senescent cell burden and 
tissue chronic inflammation appear to more than counteract any theoretical effects of flavonol -
associated genotoxicity. Fisetin actually reduces cancer risk , as opposed to increasing it, as would 
be expected if Fisetin -induced  DNA damage were a risk for the subjects in the clinical study 
proposed here.  
 
Overall, we do not anticipate substantial risk from the natural product, Fisetin, which is present in 
many foods, including cucumbers, strawberries, and other fruits and vegetab les, albeit at levels 
lower than those that will be used here. Thus, the risks of using this drug are likely minimal 
compared to the anticipated benefits for patients with CoV infection severe enough to require 
hospitalization and the knowledge that may be  gained from these clinical investigations.

 the rate of complications related to COVID -19 (CoV) disease using a 7 point score adapted from the 
WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement of CoV (Appe ndix A). The secondary objective is to 
determine safety and tolerability of treatment with Fisetin in this patient population. Exploratory 
objectives are to evaluate links between soluble and genetic markers of senescent cell abundance, 
SASP factors, infla mmation, viral load, and treatment effects.  
 
3 STUDY  DESIGN  
 
This will be an enterprise wide, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled  study. Following 
signature of the informed consent form, approximately 150 subjects meeting all inclusion and no 
exclus ion criteria will be randomized to receive either Fisetin or placebo (1:1  allocation  ratio)  for 
days 0 and 1 AND days 8 and 9.  Follow -up phone  assessments  will occur  at 15, 30, and 60 days  
following randomization for evaluation of the occurrence of any trial endpoints or other adverse 
events. Exploratory objectives are to evaluate links between soluble and genetic markers of senescent 
cell abundance, SASP factors, inflammation, viral load, and treatment effects and if Fisetin treatment 
during acute CoV infection decreases Long -hauler syndrome at Days 60 .  
 
3.1 Study  Schedule  
 
The schedule of visits for this study is outlined in Table 1. However, a patient may be evaluated at 
any time for safety concerns.  
 
3.2 Enrollment  
 
Informed consent will be obtained from patients who volunteer to participate in the study prior to 
the conduct of any study -specific procedures. The patient will be considered “enrolled” into the 
study at the time an informed consent is provided.  
 
Biomarker samples collection including senescent biomarker analysis will be optional for 
participants. The informed consent form will reflect this option and patients will specifically be 
asked to consent to this biomarker evaluation.  
 
 
3.3 Screening Evaluations and  Randomization  
 
Screening evaluations will include a review of the patient’s medical history and assessment of 
concomitant medications to determine if the patient qualifies for the study. Patients who meet all 
inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria will be randomize d to receive the study drug or placebo. 
All patients must be randomized within 10 days of the diagnosis of COVID -19 infection.  
 
Women of childbearing potential must have a negative urine pregnancy test result after the time of 
randomization, but before IP administration in order to qualify. Qualifying patients will be 
randomized to receive placebo or fisetin administered in a blind ed manner. Blinded randomization 
will be performed through an automated Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). 75 patients 
will be randomized to active treatment and 75 patients will be randomized to placebo for a total of 
150 randomized patients.

Version 4.0, 18NOV2021  
Page 32 of 57  
 3.4 Activ e Treatment  Period  
 
All patients will receive study medication  dosing  (either Fisetin 100 mg or matching placebo) (PO) 
ON day 0 and 1 And Day 8 and 9. If a dose is missed, it should not be replaced. Throughout the 
study, patients will undergo phone visits  (at 15, 30,  and 60 days) to assess for potential study 
endpoints and other adverse events (AEs). Patients will be dispensed the entire supply of study 
medication  on Day 0 to use for the duration of the study.   
 
At each phone contact, patients will be : 
1) questioned in a non -specific manner for the occurrence of AEs and any change in 
concomitant medications  
2) 7 point score adapted from the WHO Ordinal Scale for Clinical Improvement of CoV.  
 
Fecal, urine and buccal swab samples for biomarker are optional for the participants. The informed 
consent form will reflect this option an d patients will specifically be asked to consent to this 
biomarker evaluation.

4.3 Prohibited, Allowable, and Concurrent  Medications  
 
The use of concomitant medications at the time of randomization will be recorded in the eCRF 
(with the exceptions of concomitant medication taken “when necessary” (PRN)).  
 
5 STUDY  METHODOLOGY  
 
5.1 Efficacy  Outcomes  
 
The primary endpoint will be the composite of death or the need for hospitalization due to COVID -
19 infection in the first 30 days after randomization. The secondary endpoints will consist of the 
components of the composite primary endpoint; and the need for mechanical ventilation in the first 
30 days after randomization. Exploratory endpoints will include associations between senescent 
biomarkers and long hauler syndrome effects.  
 
Biomarkers endpoints:  
Samples received from participants will be kept frozen until evaluation of biomarkers.  
Samples will be stored and processe d at Mayo Clinic Rochester.  
 
5.2 Safety  Monitoring  
 
Drug safety will be assessed by an evaluation of types, frequencies, severities  and duration of 
any reported AEs. Patients will be monitored for signs and symptoms of drug  toxicity.  
 
 
For all toxicities that require the study therapy to be temporarily or permanently discontinued, 
relevant clinical and laboratory tests will be repeate d as clinically needed until there is final 
resolution, stabilization of the toxicity, or another cause for the abnormality is determined.  
 
5.2.1 Adverse Event  Reporting  
 
Information regarding AEs will be collected from the first dose of study medication (at Visit 2) 
through and including the last visit. Any AEs prior to randomization will be recorded in the medical 
history and kept in the patients’ chart.  
Page 37 of 57 COVFIS-HOME : COVID -19 PILOT STUDY  OF FISETIN  TO ALLEVIATE DYSFUNCTION  AND DECREASE COMPLICATIONS  
Version 4.0, 18Nov2021  
  
  
In addition to standard reporting of Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) as defined and outlined in 
Section 5.2.1.1 below, information regarding SAEs that occur within 30 days following the last 
study visit, and reported to the investigational site, will be collected. Each patient will be observed 
and queried in a non -specific fashion at each  visit during the study for any new or continuing 
symptoms since the previous visit.  
 
All SAEs will be recorded on the appropriate eCRF section. The only other AEs to be recorded 
on the eCRF are those that are either related to the gastrointestinal system,  that are judged related  
to the study medication by the investigator or laboratory abnormalities judged clinically significant 
by the investigator. Information collected will include the onset, duration, severity, relationship to 
study drug, and the manage ment as outlined in Appendix C.  
 
5.2.1.1  Serious Adverse  Events  
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE) are those that meet any of the following International Council for 
Harmonisation (ICH) criteria:  
 
• Is fatal or immediately  life-threatening;  
• Results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity;  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization;  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of the  patient;  
• Is a cancer;  
• Is an overdose (intentional or accidental);  
• Is judged to be medically  import ant. 
 
Medically important events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in death or 
hospitalization but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the 
outcomes listed in the definition above. Serious Adverse Events are to be reported if they are 
known to occur within 30 days following the last study visit.  
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other AEs meet these 
criteria and are immediately reportable to the sponsor or designee.  
 
In the event of a serious or life -threatening adverse event, or in the event of death, immediately 
report the event on the appropriate SAE form in the eCRF.  
 
 
If any SAE occurs, the study treatment may be interrupted or discontinued at the Inves tigator’s 
discretion. If an acute medical emergency occurs, the investigator should make every effort to 
reach the contact person listed above, before breaking the randomization code, via the automated 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). However, the i nvestigator may break the 
randomization code (via IWRS) at any time if this is required for proper treatment of the patient 
and even if the contact person could not be reached.  
 
Reports to the Health Authorities must be made within 7 calendar days, (for de ath and life -
threatening events) and within 15 calendar days (for other serious events) after being informed of 
Page 38 of 57 COVFIS-HOME : COVID -19 PILOT STUDY  OF FISETIN  TO ALLEVIATE DYSFUNCTION  AND DECREASE COMPLICATIONS  
Version 4.0, 18Nov2021  
  
 an SAE by the investigator.  
 
5.2.1.2  Lack of Efficacy of study  medication  
 
Any signs or symptoms defined in the protocol as lack of efficacy or collected as efficacy 
parameters (endpoints) will be captured as AE in the database.  
 
5.2.1.3  Adverse Event  Follow -Up 
 
Record all reportable serious and non -serious AEs on the appropriate eCRF including the onset, 
duration, severity, relationship to the study drug , and ultimate management. All AEs reported 
during the treatment phase should be recorded and followed until the AE has subsided, or stabilized 
or until the end of the study, whichever occurs first. The study will be stopped at any time if new 
knowledge is  gained and the risk -benefit ratio is no longer favorable for the participating patients  
 
5.2.2 Other Safety  Monitoring  
 
5.2.2.1  Laboratory  Evaluations  
 
Optional biomarker with buccal, urine and stool samples will be collected for the biomarker 
analysis. At day 0/1, day 1 5, day 30 and day 60.  The samples will be kept in a laboratory at 
Rochester campus. These samples may be used to assess (but not limited to) markers of 
inflammation and senescence.  
 
5.3 Withdrawal of Patients from the  Study  
 
Patients have the right to withdraw from the study at any time during the course of the study. 
However, every effort should be made, within the bounds of safety, patient choice and the 
provisions of informed consent, to have each patient complete the study  up to and including the 
last protocol -specified study visit. If the study medication jeopardizes the patient’s health or if the 
patient wishes to discontinue for any reason, study medication can be discontinued but the patient 
should be encouraged to rema in in the study for the follow -up visit up to the End of Study visit. If 
the patient does not wish to pursue the protocol follow -up visit, the option for a last contact at the 
end of the study to obtain their vital status should be proposed. Patients who a re not compliant 
during the active treatment period should be counseled on the importance of complying with study 
requirements and be allowed to remain in the study. No patient who has withdrawn their consent 
from the study during the active treatment peri od should be  replaced.  
 
In the case of an adverse event or safety concern, the study medication may be withheld 
temporarily, or the dose reduced, as per investigator judgment.  
 
Patients withdrawn at any time from the study during the active treatment period should complete 
all last protocol -specified visit requirements (End of Study Visit, the reason for withdrawal from 
the study, the date of the last visit and the date of the last dose of double -blind medication will be 
clearly documented in  the eCRF).

Version 4.0, 18Nov2021  
  
  
 
 
5.4 Study  Completion  
 
The study will end when the last randomized patient will have completed his (or her) 60 day  
follow -up phone contact. Completion of the study by a patient should be clearly indicated in the 
eCRF, along with the date of the last visit and the date of the last dose of double - blind medication.  
 
Patients will be remunerated fo r participation in the study; they will receive $25 after completing 
Day 1 5, Day 30 and Day 60 . 
 
6 STUDY  MEDICATION  
 
Mayo Research pharmacy  will prepare and dispense study medication (fisetin  and placebo) 
with appropriate labeling to include a statement that these products are for investigational use 
only. 
 
6.1 Medication Dispensing  
 
Study medication may be dispensed by the designated pharmacist or a qualified investigative site 
representative, ac cording to a detailed set of dispensing instructions. Study medication may also  
be shipped directly to the patient’s home depending on evolving circumstances related to COVID -
19. 
 
6.2 Dosage  Regimen  
 
At randomization, patients will be dispensed Fisetin capsules  or placebo to match Fisetin capsules . 
Patients will be instructed to take 20mg/kg on days 0 and 1 and another 20mg/kg on days 8 and 9 
according to the detailed set of dispensing instructions out lined on the label.  
 
7 DATA  COLLECTION  
 
Electronic Case Report Forms (eCRF) for all patients will be supplied. These are to be completed 
as instructed. Original source documents and other study documentation will be maintained at the 
study site. Risk -based m onitoring will be performed by the study team.  
 
8 DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
8.1 Statistical Power and Sample Size  Considerations  
 
All main analyses in COVFIS -HOME will be conducted on an intention -to-treat basis. Assuming 75 
subjects/ group with a significance level of 0.05, the study will have 80% power to detect an odds ratio 
of 2.24 comparing the placebo - to Fisetin -treated group, using the 7 -point severity score at Day 30 as the 
endpoint in an ordinal logistic regression m odel.  
Analysis  population  
 
 
Page 40 of 57 COVFIS-HOME : COVID -19 PILOT STUDY  OF FISETIN  TO ALLEVIATE DYSFUNCTION  AND DECREASE COMPLICATIONS  
Version 4.0, 18Nov2021  
  
 8.1.2  Intent to Treat (ITT) population  
 
All patients randomized will be included in the ITT population. Patients will be assigned to 
treatment groups as randomized for analysis purposes.  
 
8.1.3 Safety  population  
 
All patients who received at least one dose of study medication will be included in the safety 
analysis population. Patients will be assigned according to the true treatment received for 
analysis purposes.  
8.2 Data  analysis  
 
8.2.1 Analysis of efficacy outcomes  
 
The primary analysis of efficacy will be based on the intent -to-treat principle. The primary 
endpoint will be compared between the two treatment groups using a chi -square test. Logistic 
regression models might also be used to compare the primary endpoint b etween the two treatment 
groups while accounting for important baseline characteristics. Secondary endpoints will be 
analyzed similarly. Exploratory analysis (biomarkers) will include logistic regression models with 
the primary/secondary endpoints as depen dent variables and with treatment group, biomarker and 
treatment group x biomarker interaction as independent  variables.  
All statistical tests will be two -sided and conducted at the 0.05 significance level, with the 
exception of the primary analysis that will be conducted at a slightly lower level to account for the 
interim analysis. Statistical analyses will be done using S AS version 9.4 or higher.  
 
8.2.2 Analysis of safety  outcomes  
 
Safety of Fisetin will be evaluated by presenting descriptive statistics for various safety endpoints 
broken down by group. This will be done for the population of patients who received at least one 
dose of study medication (safety  population).  
 
8.2.3 Interim  analysis  
 
A fully independent 5 -member Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will be established 
and will review unblinded safety data as detailed in the DSMB charter. An interim analysis is 
planned after approximately 50% of randomized patients have completed 30 days of follow -up. 
The DSMB charter will pre -specify the methods of interim efficacy analyses and the rules for early 
study termination, approved by all board members. The stopping ru les for efficacy will be based 
on the O’Brien -Fleming alpha -spending function or on a similar conservative approach so that the 
impact on the final alpha level will be negligible. Futility will be assessed by computing 
conditional power. The DSMB will have  the option of recommending early study termination 
because of overwhelming efficacy, early termination for futility, or continuation of the trial as 
planned.  
The final analysis of the primary endpoint will be conducted at a significance level slightly below 
Page 41 of 57 COVFIS-HOME : COVID -19 PILOT STUDY  OF FISETIN  TO ALLEVIATE DYSFUNCTION  AND DECREASE COMPLICATIONS  
Version 4.0, 18Nov2021  
  
 the 0.05 level to account for the interim analysis. However, since this will have a negligible impact 
on power, the sample size calculation was calculated u sing a significance level of 0.05.  
 
9 STUDY  COORDINATION  
 
Mayo Clinic Rochester will be responsible for processing and quality control of the data. The 
handling of data, including data quality control, will comply with all applicable regulatory 
guidelines, a nd the study Data Management Plan.

Appendix B  Administrative Procedures for the Reporting of Adverse  Events  
 
The following administrative procedures for reporting AEs are to be followed during the 
conduct of this clinical trial.  
 
1 ADVERSE EVENTS DURING THE  TRIAL  
 
Each patient will be observed and queried in a non -specific manner by the investigator or 
study coordinator at each visit for any new or continuing AE since the pre vious visit. Any 
AEs prior to the first dose of study medication will be recorded in the medical history and 
kept in the patients’ chart. All SAEs will be recorded in the appropriate eCRF section. In 
addition to SAEs, the only AEs to be recorded in the eCR F are those that are either related to 
the gastrointestinal system, that are judged related to the study medication by the investigator 
or that are laboratory abnormalities judged clinically significant by the investigator. 
Information collected will inclu de the onset, duration, severity, relationship to study drug, 
and the management. SAEs are to be reported if they are known to occur within 30 days 
following the last study  visit.  
 
The investigator will review the clinical laboratory test results in a time ly fashion when 
received from the laboratory. Those results qualifying as AEs as defined in this appendix will 
be recorded on the AE eCRF section and will be handled according to these AE reporting 
procedures.  
 
The investigator will review concomitant medications being taken by the patient.

1.1 Pre-existing  condition  
 
A pre -existing condition is one that is present prior to randomization. A worsening of a pre - 
existing condition after taking the first dose of investigational product should be reported as 
an AE.  
 
1.2 Adverse Event  (AE)  
 
An AE is defined as any unfavorable and unintended sign (including a clinically meaningful 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational product, whether or not related to the investigational pro duct.  
 
A medical procedure is not considered and should not be reported as an AE. However, the 
medical condition which led to the procedure should be considered as an AE and be reported 
as such.  
 
1.3 Related Adverse  Event  
 
A related AE is one where, according to the Investigator, there is a reasonable possibility that 
the event may have been caused by the study drug.  
 
1.4 Serious Adverse Event  (SAE)  
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE) are those that meet any of the following International Council 
for Harmonisation (ICH) criteria:  
 
• Is fatal or immediately life -threatening (NOTE: the term "Life -Threatening" 
refers to an event in which the patient was at immediate risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which could hypothetic ally have 
caused death had it been more  severe);  
• Results in persistent or significant  disability/incapacity;  
• Requires or prolongs patient  hospitalization;  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of the  patient;  
• Is a cancer;  
• Is an overdose (intentional or accidental);  
• Is judged to be medically  important.  
 
Medically important events may not be immediately life -threatening, result in death or 
hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of 
the outcomes listed in the definition above. Serious adverse events are to be reported if they 
are known to occur within 30 days following the last study visit.  
 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether other AEs meet 
these criteria and are immediately reportable to the sponsor or its designee.

 Version 4.0, 18NOV2021  
Page 52 of 57 
 Hospitalization is defined as a patient admission to a hospital for medical treatment or 
observation; a visit to the emergency room for an outpatient consultation is not considered a 
hospitalization. Moreover, the following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs:  
 
• Hospitalizations for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for a pre -
exist ing condition.  
• Hospitalization for therapy of the target disease(s) of the study if the 
protocol explicitly anticipated and defined the symptoms or  episodes.  
• Hospitalization for study efficacy measurement, as defined in the  protocol.  
 
1.5 Life-Threatening Adverse  Event  
 
A life -threatening AE is an AE that, in the opinion of the investigator, places the patient at 
immediate risk of death from the reaction as it occurred.  
 
1.6 Unexpected Adverse  Event  
 
An unexpected AE is any AE that is not consistent with findings previously observed.  
 
1.7 Clinical Laboratory Adverse  Event  
 
A clinical laboratory abnormality is regarded as an AE if it has been confirmed by at least 1 
repeat test and suggests a disease and/or organ toxicity severe enough to require active 
management.  
 
1.8 Treatment -Emergent Signs and Symptoms  (TESS)  
 
A TESS event is any AE that was not present prior to randomization or that worsens in 
character, intensity or frequency while the patient is in an active treatment period.  
 
1.9 Post-treatment Adverse Event  
 
A post -treatment AE is any AE that occurs after treatment is discontinued.  
 
2 HANDLING OF ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 
2.1 Treatment -Emergent Signs and  Symptoms  
 
Any condition/diagnosis that meets the definition of a TESS event is captured in the 
appropriate eCRF AE form and kept in the patient’s chart.  
 
2.2 Serious Adverse  Events  
 
All SAEs are to be immediately reported.  Serious Adverse Events, within 24 hours of the 
Investigator’s first knowledge of the event.

Page 53 of 57 
 2.3 Intensity  
 
The following criteria are used to assess the intensity of each AE:  
 
• Mild: The patient is aware of the sign or symptom, but finds it easily  tolerated.  
• Moderate: The patient has enough discomfort to cause interference with or 
change in usual  activities.  
• Severe: The patient is incapacitated and unable to work or participate in 
many or all usual  activities.  
 
2.4 Relationship to Study Drug – Physician’s Assessment  
 
There are 3 categories for the physician’s assessment of the causal relationship between study 
drug and an AE as follows: not related, possibly and probably.  
 
2.5 Clinical  Outcome  
 
The following categories are used to assess the clinical outcome of each AE:  
 
• Death related to the adverse  event  
• Recovered – The patient has fully recovered from the AE without  
observable residual  effects.  
• Recovered with sequelae – The patient has recovered from the 
AE with observable residual  effects.  
• Not Recovered – The patient is still being treated for the residual effects of 
the original AE. This does not include treatment f or pre -existing conditions 
including the indication for the study  drug.  
• Recovering  
• Unknown  
 
3 CAPTURING AVDERSE  EVENTS  
 
3.1 Pre-Existing  Condition  
 
A pre -existing condition should be captured in the medical history and kept in the patient’s 
chart. If the frequency, intensity, or character of the condition worsens during study 
treatment, and is either related to the gastrointestinal system, is judged related to the study 
medication by the investigator or is a laboratory abnormality judged clinically signifi cant by 
the investigator, it must be documented in the appropriate eCRF AE  form.  
 
3.2 Lack of Efficacy of Study  Medication  
 
Signs or symptoms defined in the protocol as lack of efficacy or collected as efficacy 
parameters (endpoints) will be captured as AEs.  
 
3.3 Clinical Laboratory Adverse  Event

COMPLICATIONS  
 Version 4.0, 18NOV2021  
Page 54 of 57 
  
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be reported as an AE only if it is considered to be  
clinically significant by the investigator and confirmed by repeat testing.  
 
3.4 Hospitalization or  Surgery/Procedure  
 
Any AE reported as study endpoint should not be reported as an SAE. Any 
condition/diagnosis responsible for surgery/procedure should be repo rted as an AE if it meets 
the criteria for an AE. A medical procedure is not considered and should not be reported as 
an AE. The surgery/procedure itself will be reported as a Clinical Outcome of the underlying 
event. Events that prolong any hospitalizatio n are reported as SAEs.  
 
3.5 Death  
 
The cause of death should be reported as an AE.  
 
 
3.6 Other Adverse  Events  
 
Study endpoints are to be reported in the eCRF within 24 hours of awareness of the event.  
 
In addition to SAEs and study endpoints, the only AEs to be recorded on the eCRF are those 
that are either related to the gastrointestinal system, that are judged related to the study 
medication by the investigator or that are laboratory abnormalities judged clinically 
significant by the investigator. Information c ollected will include the onset, duration, 
severity, relationship to study drug, and the management.  
 
3.7 Follow -Up Period  
 
For SAEs, the patient must remain under observation until the SAE has subsided or stabilized 
and all serious findings have returned to n ormal or stabilized. Any follow -up information to 
an initial SAE report must be updated in the eCRF. Serious Adverse Events are to be reported 
if they are known to occur within 30 days following the last study  visit.

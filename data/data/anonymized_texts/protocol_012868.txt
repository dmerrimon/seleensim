Study Title:  A Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Study of t he Efficac y, 
Safety, and Tolerability of Serlopita nt for the Treatment of Refractory Chronic 
Cough 
Protocol Number:  MTI-110 
Sponsor:  Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  
Study Centers:  Approximately 45 sites in  the USA and UK  
Development Phase:  Phase 2 
Study Objectives:  The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of serlopit ant 
for the treatment of refractory chronic cough after 12 weeks of treatment in 
reducing 24- hour objective cough frequency.  
The secondary objectives are as follows:  
• To evaluate the effectiveness of serlopitant as compared to placebo after 4 and 8 weeks of  treatment in reducing 24 -hour objective cough frequency  
• To evaluate the effectiveness of serlopitant as compared to placebo after 4, 
8 and 12 weeks of treatment in reducing awake objective cough frequency  
• To evaluate the effectiveness of serlopitant as compared to placebo after 4, 
8 and 12 weeks of treatment in reducing sleep objective cough frequency  
• To evaluate the effectiveness of serlopitant in:  
◦ Reducing the cough severity measured by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS)  
◦ Improving cough- specific quality of life  (LCQ)  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopitant in subjects with treatment refractory chronic cough  
Study Design:  This is a 12 -week randomized, parallel -group , double -blind, placebo- controlled 
study of serlopitant in sub jects with treatment refractory chronic cough.  
Approximately 170 subjects who meet entry criteria will be randomly assigned 
to serlopitant 5 mg or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio for up to 84 days.  The 
randomization will be stratified by country and gender . 
The study will consist of three periods, for a total study period of approximately 18 weeks:  
• Screening period: 14 days  
• Treatment period: 84 days  
• Follow -up period: 28 days  
 
During the screening period, subjects will undergo eligibility evaluations. 
Subjec ts must be willing to comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant 
therapies for the duration of the study.  
At the Baseline visit, eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two  
treatment  groups and will have baseline cough monitoring condu cted. One day 
after the Baseline visit, subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally) 
in the morning on the first day of the treatment period (Study Day 1). Starting 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 5 on Study Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day taken orally in the 
morning. Subjects will be instructed to take all doses at approximately the same 
time each day and no sooner than 2 hours before or after a meal.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Day 84 of treatment.  
After completion of the 84 -day treatment period, all subjects will enter a 28 -day 
follow -up period. Subjects who discontinue treatment early at any time during 
the treatment period will have an Early Treatment Discontinuation (ETD) visit 
within 7  days after their last dose of study drug in addition to a follow -up visit .

Version 2.0  Page 9 Decision Rule and 
Sample Size  A total of 170 subjects (85/arm) in  1:1 ratio of  serlopitant 5 mg or placebo will 
provide 90% power to detect a 25% relative reduction (placebo -adjusted ratio of 
0.75) in 24- hour objective  cough frequency or awake  objective  cough frequency 
using a two -sample t -test at a one -sided significance level of 0.05.  This assumes 
that 24-hour cough frequency or awake  cough frequency follows a log- normal 
distribution with a CV of 0. 64. This sample size also considers an expected 
dropout rate of 15%.  
The comparisons related to the primary and key secondary objectives will be 
done in a hierarchical manner to control the familywise error rate. The testing 
proced ure will start by testing the primary endpoint and then proceed to the key 
secondary endpoints by following the order as specified in Section 8.9.4.  
Analysis Sets : Efficacy Analysis Sets  
Full Analysis Set (FAS) – All randomized subjects who have taken at least one 
dose of study medication and provided at least one baseline and at least one 
post-baseli ne primary endpoint observation  during the treatment period. 
Participants will be analyzed according to the treatm ent group to which they are 
randomized. 
Safety Analysis Sets  
The safety analysis set will consist of all subjects randomized who receive at least one dose of study medication. Subjects will be classified based upon the treatment received . 
PK Analysis Set  
The PK analysis set will consist of all subjects who receive ≥ 1 dose of 
serlopitant and who have at least 1 post- dose PK blood sample available for 
analysis.  
Statistical Methods:  Efficacy Analyses:  
The FAS population will serve as the primary population f or the analysis of 
efficacy data in this study.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is change from Baseline in 24 -hour 
objective cough frequency after 12 weeks (84 days) of treatment.   
As the change in 24 -hour cough frequency may have a skewed and  wide 
distribution, the primary analysis for the primary endpoint will be analyzed on 
the natural log scale.  The difference between serlopitant  (5 mg) and placebo 
will be estimated using a mixed effect repeated measures (MMRM) model. The 
model will include  factors for treatment, visit, country, sex, the interaction of 
treatment by visit; and the log -transformed baseline value as a covariate. The 
MMRM model will use all available 24 -hour cough frequency data on Day 28, 
56, and 84. The geometric mean of the 24- hour coughs per hour will be 
presented by treatment and by visit. The percent difference change between 
serlopitant and placebo will be estimated by 100*(ediff - 1), where diff is the 
difference provided by the analysis of the log transformed variable .  
In order to evaluate the robustness of efficacy results and assess the effect of missing data, additional sensitivity analyse s for the primary efficacy variables 
will be employed.  
Safety Analyses:  
The incidence of all AEs and treatment -related AEs will be tabulated by 
treatment received. These AEs will be classified by system organ class and preferred term using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). For incidence reporting, if a subject reported more than one AE 
that was coded to the sa me system organ class or preferred term, the subject will 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 10 be counted only once for that specific system organ class or preferred term. An 
overview of AEs, which includes subject incidence of AEs, treatment -related 
AEs, AEs by severity, SAEs, deaths, and AE s leading to discontinuation, will 
be presented.  
Clinical safety laboratory values will be measured by a central laboratory. 
Summary statistics for actual values and for changes from Baseline will be tabulated for laboratory results by scheduled visit.  
Subjects with clinical laboratory values outside of the normal reference range at 
any post -baseline assessment will be summarized. Shifts from Baseline 
laboratory values will be tabulated. 
The observed vital signs and ECG data and change from Baseline for each 
measurement day will be summarized with descriptive statistics . 
Expected Duration of Subject’s Participation  Approximately 126 days: 14 days of screening, 84 days of treatment, and a follow -up period of 28 days . 
This study will be conducted in accordance with the Guidelines of Good Clinical Practices (GCPs).

Version 2.0  Page 16 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Refractory Chronic Cough  
Cough is a common symptom frequently associated with other conditions such as an upper 
respiratory infection, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) , or asthma. In cough 
guidelines, such as those published by the American College of Chest Physicians, cough is characterized by the length of time a patient is coughing: Acute - up to 3 weeks, Sub Acute - from 3 to 8 weeks, and Chronic - greater than 8 weeks ( Irwin 2006) . Patien ts who present to 
a physician for a persistent cough are evaluated and treated for obvious and common causes of cough. If a patient continues to cough, he/she is evaluated for conditions that are commonly associated with chronic cough. These are asthma, ga stroesophageal reflux disease 
(GERD), and upper airway cough syndrome (UACS) ( Dicpinigaitis 2011 ). According to the 
cough guidelines, a patient may be evaluated for less common diseases based on the patient’s history, other symptoms, or physical findings. Patients in whom no treatable cause of their cough can be found are characterized as having “refractory chronic cough” ( Gibson 2016).  
Patients with refractory chronic cough may represent up to 12% of the general population. Patients are most commonly women (approximately 2/3 -3/4 of patients are women) of 
approximately 45 to 75 years of age. Patients most commonly cough while awake for approximately 20 times per hour to as much as several hundred times per hour (Abdulqawi 2014). The cough may last for many years with some patients reporting having 
coughed for a median of 12 years in a recent study ( Abdulqawi 2014). Patients with 
refractory chro nic cough report that their condition is frequently disabling and has a marked 
effect on their quality of life as measured by instruments such as the Leicester Cough Questionnaire (LCQ) ( Birring 2003, Kelsall 2008).  
Treatment options for refractory chronic cough are very limited. There are no approved drug treatments for this disease. Patients and clinicians frequently try over -the-counter agents such 
as dextromethorphan, guaifenesin, and antihistamines with little benefit. Prescription options in the U.S. include codeine and related opiate products and benzonatate, and in the U.K. low-dose oral morphine. Studies have evaluated amitriptyline ( Dicpinigaitis 2014) and 
gabapentin with some patients having some benefit but with some important adverse events (Ryan  2012 ). Importantly, there have been no FDA approvals for a novel pharmaceutical 
agent to treat  cough in over 50 years.  
1.2 Substance P and the Neurokinin- 1 Receptor in Cough   
As the study of cough and the search for agents that can control the coughing in patients with refractory chronic cough advance, there has been a greater appreciation for the role of the abnormalities in the neuronal pathways that control cough. These pathways include peripheral sensory C and Aδ fibers that are contained in vagal afferent nerves  
(LaVinka 2013, Mazzone 2007). These nerves have their ganglia in the ju gular and nodose 
ganglion and project their terminals into the nucleus tractus solitarius of the brainstem. It has been proposed by Canning et al that while there are multiple stimuli in the periphery that are involved with the cough reflex, in the central nervous system there are few mediators of the cough ( Canning 2009). One of these is through substance P/neurokinin pathway. Neurokinin 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 17 A1 antagonists have been found to inhibit cough in several animal models of cough  
(Canning 2009, Grobman 2016, Mazzone 2005). Therefore, it is proposed that NK 1-R 
antagonism may play a key role in controlling cough. There have been two  recently reported 
studies with an NK 1-R antagonist in controlling cough. Aprepitant, which is commercially 
available as an antiemetic, was successful in reducing cough in patients with lung cancer 
(Harle 2015 ). Similarly, a study of o rvepitant  in subjects with refractory chronic cough also 
showed benefit after one month of treatment ( Smith 2017). 
1.3 Serlopitant  
1.3.1 Serlopitant Background 
Serlopitant is a small molecule, highly selective NK1 -R antagonist that is administered orally 
and metabolized by CYP3A4, with a pla sma half -life of 45 –86 hours. It binds with high 
affinity to the human NK1-R with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 46 pM; displacing SP binding with a half- maximal inhibition concentration (IC
50) of 61 pM. Serlopitant is a potent 
functional antagonist of SP-induced inositol phosphate generation. 
Serlopitant has been extensively studied in animal toxicology studies, including chronic 
toxicology and carcinogenicity studies. In non-clinical chronic toxicology studies in rats, mice and dogs, treatment related findings of potential clinical significance included increased salivation, decreased body weight gain and food consumption, slight changes in hematology and serum biochemistry parameters, mild increases in liver weight and mild histomorphologic changes. The histomorphologic changes were seen only in rats (not in dogs or mice) and included: very slight ovarian interstitial cell hypertrophy, mammary gland and uterine atrophy; decreased corpora lutea; increased histiocytes in lung and mesenteric lymph nodes; sli ght skeletal and cardiac muscle degeneration; slight increased hematopoiesis in 
bone marrow; and slight to moderate vacuolation in kidney tubules. These nonclinical findings occurred at systemic exposures exceeding those anticipated to provide efficacy of serlopitant for pruritus indications in humans (1 to 5 mg tablet daily). No cardiac lesions have been observed in dog toxicity studies up to 9 months in duration nor in a 3-month mouse range -finding study and 2- year mouse carcinogenicity study at exposure higher than the 
lowest level which caused cardiotoxicity in rats. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in rats for histomorphological changes in the reproductive tract, mammary gland and bone marrow provides a 2.5-fold margin for the maximum- target ed exposure 
(5 mg tablet daily). The rat NOAEL for histomorphological changes in muscle and kidney 
provides a 5- fold margin for the maximum-targeted exposure (5 mg tablet daily).  
In summary, the nonclinical toxicity noted with serlopitant provides no contraindications to the continuation of clinical trials via the oral route. Findings in the developmental toxicity studies support inclusion of women of childbearing potential in clinical trials in accordance with the study protocol and local regulatory guida nces. 
1.3.2 Serlopitant Clinical Data in Phase 1 and Non- Pruritus Studies  
In humans, serlopitant has been administered to over 1000 individuals. Single doses up to 400 mg have been well tolerated in healthy young males. Multiple doses of up to 50 mg a 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 18 day for 4  weeks have been well tolerated in healthy young males , and a single (loading) dose 
of 15 mg followed by daily doses of 5 mg for 2  weeks have been well tolerated in elderly 
males and females.  Forty -one (41) subjects received 4 mg liquid filled capsule (LFC) daily 
(exposure comparable to 5 mg tablets) for 1  year.  Plasma concentrations  of serlopitant 
appear to increas e in a dose-proportional fashion in both young males  and elderly  subjects 
(males and females ). Peak plasma concentrations after  a single  oral dose occurred  at ~2 to 
4 hours in both young and elder ly subjects . 
In a Phase 2 study examining treatment of overactive bladder (Study P003), the most 
common AEs during the initial 8 -week base period across all treatment groups were 
headache (5.7%), diarrhea (5.2%), urinary tract infection (4.7%), dry mouth (4.5%), nasopharyngitis (4.5%), upper respiratory tract infection (4.3%), fatigue (4.1%), dizziness (3.8%), back pain (2.9%), nausea (2.3%), and peripheral edema (2.2%). 
1.3.3 Serlopitant in Pruritus -Related Stud ies 
Serlopitant has been evaluated in two completed Phase 2 studies of subjects  with chronic 
pruritus (TCP -101 and TCP- 102). I n TCP -101, a P hase 2 study of 256 adult subj ects 18  to 
65 years of  age with chronic pruritus), treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) were  reported for 
25.4% of subjects in the placebo group and 32.8%, 36.9%, and 37.5% of subjects in the 
serlopitant 0.25, 1, and 5 mg groups, respectively. Overall, headache was the most commonly reported TEAE, reported for 6.3% of subjects in the placebo group and 1.6%, 4.6%, and 
1.6% of subjects in the serlopitant 0.25, 1, and 5 mg groups, respectively. Somnolence and diarrhea were the TEAEs with the highest overall incidence in the serlopitant groups. Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity . Six subject s discontinued study drug due to a 
TEAE; the events considered treatment -related in the serlopitant groups were diarrhea and 
gastrointestinal (GI) pain . There was no evidence of meaningful trends in laboratory 
abnormalities or changes in vital signs.  
In TCP-102, a Phase 2 study of 127 adult subjects 18 to 80 years of age with PN, TEAEs 
were reported for 61.9% of subjects in the placebo group and 71.9% of subjects in the 
serlopitant 5  mg group. The most common TEAEs in the serlopitant group were 
nasopharyngitis (17.2% serlopitant, 3.2% placebo), diarrhea (10.9% serlopitant, 4.8% placebo), and fatigue (9.4% serlopitant, 6.3% placebo). Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. Five subjects (3 serlopitant, 2 placebo) had serious adverse events ( SAEs ); thos e 
considered possibly related to study drug in the serlopitant group were depression, dizziness, and vertigo . Nine  subjects discontinued study drug due to a TEAE; those considered 
treatment -related in the serlopitant groups were pruritus, neurodermatitis, headache, 
dizziness, and vertigo. No clinically relevant changes were observed in chemistry, hematology, vital signs, or electrocardiogram (ECG) results.  
Additional studies are currently ongoing in pruritus  associated with atopic dermatitis  and 
epidermolysis bullosa.

Version 2.0  Page 19 1.3.4 Serlopitant in Chronic Cough 
Other NK 1-R antagonists (aprepitant and orvepitant) have reported success in pilot studies in 
treating chronic cough. A study in subjects with lung cancer and cough showed a favorable 
benefit of treatment with aprepitant ( Harle 2015 ). Similarly,  a study of orvepitant in subjec ts 
with refractory cough also showed benefit after 1 month of treatment ( Smith 2017). 
Therefore, it is reasonable to study serlopitant in this indication. Serlopitant has several 
advantages over the other NK 1-R antagonists especially considering its long half -life and 
favorable safety profile. This study will explore the e ffectiveness of serlopitant in subjec ts 
with refractory chronic cough. 
2 STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of serlopitant for the 
treatment of refractory chronic cough after 12 weeks of treatment in reducing 24-hour objective cough frequency. 
The secondary objectives  are as follows : 
• To evaluate the effectiveness of serlopitant as compared to placebo after 4 and 8 weeks of 
treatment in reducing 24 -hour objective cough frequency  
• To evaluate the effectiveness of serlopitant as compar ed to placebo after 4, 8 and 
12 weeks of treatment in reducing awake objective cough frequency 
• To evaluate the effectiveness of serlopitant as compar ed to placebo after 4, 8 and 
12 weeks of treatment in reducing sleep objective cough frequency  
• To evaluate the effectiveness of serlopitant in:  
◦ Reducing the coug h severity measured by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS)  
◦ Improving cough- specific quality of life (LCQ)  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated oral doses of serlopitant in subjec ts with 
treatment refractory chronic cough  
 
3 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 Overall Study Design 
This is a 12- week randomized, parallel -group, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 
serlopitant in subjects with treatment refractory chronic c ough. 
Approximately 170 subjects who meet entry criteri a will be randomly assigned to serlopitant 
5 mg or matching placebo in a 1:1 ratio for up to 84 days. The randomization will be 
stratified by country and gender. 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 20 The study will consist of three periods, for a total study period of approximately 18 weeks:  
• Screening period: 14 days 
• Treatment period: 84 days 
• Follow-up period: 28 days 
 
Informed consent will occur prior to any protocol-mandated procedures, including the 
stopping of any  excluded therapies. This may occur prior to the initial Screening visit. During 
the screening period, subjects will undergo el igibility evaluation and will have baseline 
cough monitoring conducted. Subjects must be willing to comply with restrictions on allowable concomitant therapies for the duration of the study. 
At the baseline visit, eligible subjects will be randomly assign ed to receive serlopitant 5 mg 
or placebo. Subjects will take a loading dose (3 tablets taken orally) in the morning on the 
first day of the treatment period (Study Day 1). Starting on Study Day 2, subjects will take one tablet per day taken orally in the m orning. Subjects will be instructed to take all doses at 
approximately the same time each day and no sooner than 2 hours before or after a meal.  
The primary efficacy endpoint will be assessed at Day 84 of treatment.  
After completion of the 84- day treatment period, all subjects will enter a 28 -day follow-up 
period. Subjects who discontinue treatment early at any time during the treatment period will 
have an Early Treatment Discontinuation (ETD) visit within 7 days after their last dose of study drug in addition to a follow-up visit. 
3.2 Rationale for Study Design and Dose Selection 
Serlopitant has not been studied in patients with refractory chronic cough. However, 
serlopitant has been studied extensively in other indications. It is currently being advanced into Phase 3 studies in pruritus.  
In the TCP-101 study, serlopitant 5 mg and 1 mg taken daily for 6 weeks were superior to placebo for the reduction of pruritus . Similarly, in the TCP -102 study in patients with prurigo 
nodularis, serlopitant 5 mg taken daily for 8  weeks was superior to placebo for the reduction 
of pruritus. In both the TCP-102 and TCP-101 studies, serlopitant was generally well-tolerated and demonstrated an overall favorable safety profile at the doses evaluated.  
Serlopitant demonstrated superior efficacy compared to placebo for the treatment of chronic pruritus in a broad population of subjects (N = 257), including subjects with atopic diathesis (i.e. history of atopic dermatitis, asthma, and/or allergic rhinitis). The superior efficacy was observed at multiple timepoints with both the serlopitant 1 mg and 5 mg doses, but not with the serlopitant 0.25 mg dose. Safety profiles between the three serlopitant doses were comparable, and serlopitant was generally well -tolerated at the doses evaluated . 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 21 The serlopitant 5 mg dose was selected for this study based on the following factors: 
• The favorable efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile of serlopitant at the 5 mg do se 
level , as demonstrated in the TCP-101 and TCP-102 studies. These data are supported by 
safety experience across the serlopitant clinical development program. Over 250 subjects 
have been exposed to serlopitant at doses equivalent to the 5 mg tablet daily for at least 6 weeks, and ~40 subjects have been exposed for up to one year. 
• Huma n CNS PET receptor occupancy (RO) data for serlopitant in healthy young males 
(Study P002) demonstrated a plasma concentration - RO relationship fitted with a maximum effect (E
max) model resulting in an E max of 97%, EC 50 of 22.9 nM, and EC 90 of 
294 nM. Based on this modeling the steady state trough concentration in adults taking serlopitant 5 mg tablets once-daily is predicted to achieve ~93% RO. In previous dose- ranging experience with the NK
1-R antagonist aprepitant, optimal clinical efficacy 
for the reli ef of chemotherapy -induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) was achieved at 
dose levels resulting in > 90% CNS NK 1 RO.

5.7.3 Use of Excluded Therapies During the Treatment Period   
Use of any excluded therapies will be recorded for subjects who receive them. 
5.8 Assignment to Treatment  
5.8.1 Randomization 
Eligible subjects  will be randomized to receive serlopitant 5 mg or placebo in a 1:1 ratio . 
Stratified permuted block randomization will be used. Randomization will be stratified by  
country and gender . 
An IWRS will be used to perform the randomization.  5.8.2 Blinding  
This study will be conducted as a double- blind study with the treatment assignment 
concealed from the subjects, the investigators and their staff, the Sponsor, and any designees 
of the Sponsor who interact directly with investigative sites. The placebo will be formulated to be indistinguishable from the active study product(s). Study materials will be packaged and issued in a manner designed to maintain the blind for subjects and all study personnel involved in the direction and execution of study procedures, study assessments, and collection of data. The randomization code for e ach subject will be available  to the sites  for 
use only in an emergency situation. For details of the procedure for unblinding of individual subjects in cases of emergency see Section 7.6.  
5.9 Treatment Compliance  
Records of study drug  used, dosages administered, and intervals between visits will be kept 
during the study. Dosing dates and times  will be recorded. Subjects will be asked to return all 
partially used and empty bottle s to the study site at each visit . The site staff will count and 
record the number of remaining tablets in each returned bottle . The site staff will assess the 
subject’s compliance with dosing by reviewing the subject’s dosing diary (available o n the 
IWRS  website) and the number of remaining study drug tablets relative to the number of 
days since the bottle  was dispensed. A subject who has deviated significantly from the 
once-daily dosing regimen will be counseled.

7 ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
7.1 Definitions  
7.1.1 Adverse Event  
An AE is any untowar d medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, 
whether or not considered drug related. An AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g. an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the 
use of a drug, without any judgment about causality. 
AEs include exacerbation s of pre -existing illness es and AE s that occur as a result of 
protocol-mandated interventions. 7.1.2 Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is considered “serious” if it results in any of the following out comes:  
• Death  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 40 • Life-threatening AE  (i.e. the subject was at immediate risk of death from the event as it 
occurred. An event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity is 
not “life -threatening”)  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolonga tion of existing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions 
• Congenital anomaly/ birth defect  
• Important medical event (i.e. an event that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalization, but which may be considered serious by the investigator or Sponsor, as it may jeopardize the subject and may require medical/surgical intervention 
to prevent one of the outcomes listed above). Examples of such medica l events include 
allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse. 
 
The following are not considered SAEs: a visit to the emergency room or other hospital 
department < 24 hours that does not result in admission (unless considered an important medical or life -threatening event), an elective surgery planned prior to signing consent, 
admission as per protocol for planned medical/surgical procedure, and/or routine health assessments requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status (e.g.  routine 
colonoscopy). 
The terms “severe” and “serious” are not synonymous. Severity refers to the int ensity of an 
AE (e.g. m ild, moderate, or severe pain); the event itself may be of minor medical 
significance (e.g. s evere back pain). “Serious” is a regulatory definition, as defined above. 
Seriousness (not severity) serves as the basis for defining regulatory reporting obligations.  
Severity and seriousness should be independently assessed when recording AEs and SAEs on 
the eCRF.  
7.1.3 Abnormal Physical Exam, Laboratory, Vital Sign, and Electrocardiogram Findings  
Abnormal physical exam findings that are clinically significant and are identified prior to the 
first dose of study drug should be recorded as medical history. New or worsening clinically 
significant abnormal physical exam findings identified after the first dose of study drug 
should be recorded as AEs.  
Only a bnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that are considered clinically 
significant by the investigator (e.g. require active management or are associated with 
accompanying symptoms/signs ) will be recorded as medical history or AEs on the eC RF. 
Abnormal laboratory, vital sign, and ECG findings that occur prior to the first dose of study 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 41 drug should be recorded as medical history, and abnormal findings that occur after the first 
dose of study drug should be recorded as AEs. 
If the clinically s ignificant laboratory, vital sign, or ECG abnormality is a sign associated 
with a confirmed disease  or condition (e.g. el evated creatinine in a subject diagnosed with 
chronic kidney disease ), only the diagnosis (chronic kidney disease ) needs to be recorded  on 
the AE eCRF.  
Separate instances of the same clinically significant laboratory , vital sign, or ECG 
abnormality across visits should not be recorded as separate AEs or SAEs . 
7.1.4 Deaths  
Any deaths that occur from the time of informed consent to the follow-up visit, regardless of 
attribution, must be reported within 24 hours of investigator’s awareness of the death. See SAE and Pregnancy Form Completion Guidelines for complete instructions . 
The Sponsor should be provided a copy of any post-mortem findings and/or relevant medical reports, including histopathology. 
7.1.5 Pregnancies  and Contraception Requir ements  
For the purposes of this study, a female of childbearing potential is  defined as any female 
who has experienced menarche and is pre- menopausal; a postmenopausal state is defined as 
no menses for 12 months without an alternative medical cause in a previously menstruating 
female.  
For the purposes of this  study, acceptable contraception is defined below based on 
Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals: ICH M3(R2)  dated January 2010, and other available 
guidelines  (“U.S. Medical Eligibility Criteria for Contraceptive Use, 2010” 2010; 
“Recommendations related to contr aception and pregnancy testing in clinical trials” 2014; 
“M3(R2) Nonclinical Safety Studies for the Conduct of Human Clinical Trials and Marketing Authorization for Pharmaceuticals” 2010):  
a) All female subjects of childbearing potential must use highly effe ctive contraception, 
which includes the use of one or more of the following acceptable methods:  
i. Surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal occlusion or ligation , hysterectomy, 
bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy)  
ii. Total (as opposed to periodic or cyclic) abstinence 
iii. Hormonal contraception associated with consistent inhibition of ovulation; these may include (but are not necessarily limited to) oral, intravaginal, implantable, injectable, or transdermal delivery methods.  
i. Progesterone only oral contraceptives are excluded as a highly effective method, as they do not consistently inhibit ovulation. 
iv. Intrauterine device/system   
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 42 v. Exclusive monogamous heterosexual intercourse with a sterilized (i.e., 
vasectomized) or otherwise non- fertile (e.g., castr ated) male partner  
 
Any pregnancy occurring in a female subject or the female partner of a male subject , from 
the first study drug administration through the 4- week follow-up visit must be reported 
within 24 hours of the investigator’s awareness of the pr egnancy. See SAE and Pregnancy 
Form Report Completion Guidelines  for complete instructions.  
The investigator will follow the pregnancy to delivery or other pregnancy outcome.  
Pregnancy in a female clinical trial subject or female partner of a male clinical trial subject is 
not an SAE per se. Complications of such pregnancies (for example, spontaneous abortion) may qualify as SAE s and should be reported as such  even if they occur after the Follow -up 
visit. Any congenital anomalies/birth defects must be rec orded and reported as SAEs. See 
SAE and Pregnancy Form Report Completion Guidelines for complete instructions.  
7.2 Methods and Timing for Recording and Reporting Adverse Events  
7.2.1 Adverse Event Reporting Period  
Any AE occurrence during the study must be recorded  on source documentation and eCRF at 
the site, in accordance with protocol instructions.  AEs and SAEs will be recorded from the first study drug administration  through the 
follow-up visit. After the 4- week follow-up visit, only SAEs that are believed to be drug -
related should be reported. After informed consent but prior to initiation of study drug, only SAEs considered by the 
investigator to be caused by a protocol -mandated intervention will be collected (e.g. SAEs 
related to invasive procedures such as blood collection). These procedure- related SAEs 
should only be reported on the SAE form, not on the AE form of the eCRF. Subjects  who 
undergo screening procedures but are not randomized into the study will not have SAEs recorded in the clinical database.  
7.2.2 Eliciting Adverse Events  
Investigators will seek information on AEs and SAEs at each subject  contact through the 
follow-up visit. All AEs and SAEs, whether reported by the subject or noted by authorized study personnel, will be recorded in the subject ’s medi cal record and on the AE eCRF page, 
and, if serious, on the SAE form. For each AE and SAE recorded, the investigator will make an assessment of seriousness, severity, and causality. 
7.2.3 Assessment of Severity 
All AE s entered into the eCRF will be graded for severity using the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria  for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) v4.03
 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential

Version 2.0  Page 43 (“Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE )” 2010) to describe the 
maximum intensit y of the AE .  
If the AE cannot be found in the event- specific NCI CTCAE grading criteria, the i nvestigator 
should use the definitions for Grade 1, 2, 3, and 4 in T able 1.

Note that severity, a measure of intensity, is not equivalent to seriousness, a regulatory 
definition of outcome. Regardless of severity, some AEs may meet the criteria for seriousness. See Section 7.1.2 for the definition of an SAE. 
If an adverse event changes in severity during the same study period (e.g., treatment period), 
only the highest severity grade will be recorded on the eCRF . 
7.2.4 Assessment of Causality 
The investigator’s assessment of causality must be provided for all AE s (serious and 
non-serious). An investigator’s causality asse ssment is the determination of whether there 
exists a reasonable possibility that the investigational product caused or contributed to an AE. Causality of an AE will be assessed by the investigator using the following terms: 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 44 • Likely Related: A reaction that follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the study drug; that follows a known or expected response pattern to the suspected study drug; and for which other potential etiologies are considered less likely factors than the study drug. 
• Likely Unrelated: A reaction that, considering all potential etiologies, is most likely due 
to factors other than the study drug. 
 
7.3 Follow- up of A dverse E vents and Serious A dverse E vents 
The investigator must make every effort to follow all AEs and SAEs rega rdless of attribution 
until judged resolved or stabilized, the subject  is lost to follow -up, or it has been determined 
that study drug treatment or participation in the study is not the cause of the AE or SAE. 7.4 Reporting Serious A dverse E vents to the Sponsor and Institutional 
Review Board or Ethics Committee  
The Sponsor or designee is under obligation to report certain SAEs to regulatory authorities 
related to investigational drugs in clinical trials. The Sponsor or designee must be notified within 24 hours of an AE when the investigator determines that an AE meets the protocol definition of an SAE, regardless of the cause or relationship to study drug.  
An SAE related to study participation occurring before study drug administration and after 
informed consent should be promptly reported to the Sponsor. If the investigator learns of any SAE at any time after a participant has been discharged from the study, and the SAE is considered likely related to study drug, the SAE should be promptly reported to the Sponsor.  
Please see the SAE and Pregnancy Form Report Completion Guidelines for safety reporting instructions.  
The investigator must also comply with applicable requirements concerning reporting of 
SAEs to the Institutional Review Board (IRB)  or Ethics Committee (EC) . This may include 
initial or follow -up notification of an SAE or other safety information. 
7.5 Reporting Serious A dverse E vents to Regulatory Authorities and Study 
Investigators 
The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for submitting reports of serious, unexpected related AE s to regulatory authorities on an expedited basis, according to the ICH E2A 
Guideline and to other regulatory authorities according to national and local regulations as required. The Sponsor, or its designee, is responsible for prompt submission to the IRB or EC of any expedited SAE reports submitted to regulatory authorities. All investigators participating in ongoing clinical studies with serlopitant will receive copies of the SAE reports submitted on an expedited basis to regulatory authorities .

Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 45 7.6 Emergency Unblinding  
Emergency u nblinding is available 24 hours per day/7 days per week and will be performed 
via IWRS . An Investigator may unblind a subject’s treatment assignment only when 
knowledge of the investigational product is e ssenti al for the welfare of a subject.  There is no 
specific antidote for serlopitant and usual supportive medical management is recommended 
in the case of a medical emergency.  
8 STATISTICAL METHODS  
Endpoints will be summarized with  descriptive statistics  by treatment group and visit. For 
continuous variables, the following information will be presented: n, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum. For categorical variables counts and percentages will be used. 
Baseline for all measures will be th e last recorded value prior to the start of treatment. 
8.1 Decision Rule and Sample Size  
The comparisons related to the primary and key secondary endpoints will be done in a 
hierarchical manner  to control the familywise error rate. The testing procedure will start by 
testing the primary endpoint and then proceed to the key secondary endpoints by following the order as specified in  Section 8.9.4.  
A total of 170 subjects (8 5/arm) in 1:1 ratio to serlopitant 5 mg or placebo will provide 90% 
power to detect a 25% relative reduction (placebo- adjusted ratio  of 0.75) in 24-hour objective 
cough frequency or awake objective cough frequency us ing a two -sample t -test at a 
one-sided significance level of 0.05. This assumes that 24-hour cough frequency or awake 
cough frequency follows a log- norma l distribution with a CV of 0.64. This sample size also 
considers an expected dropout rate of 15%. 
The sample size calculations have been performed in nQuery Advisor + nTerim .  
8.2 Handling of M issing D ata and Excluded Therapy Use  
For summary statistics results will generally be reported based upon observed data. Should a 
determination of treatment period (on treatment, pre -treatment) be required for AE s or 
concomitant medication but the corresponding date is missing, or is a  partial date , the 
event/medication will be considered on treatment unless the portions of the date that are available indicate this is not possible . 
In case of missing data for the primary efficacy endpoint, two selected imputation approaches are specified for the sensitivity analyses ( Section 8.9.2.1). All other efficacy endpoints, 
analysis will be conducted based on the observed data only. 
8.3 Derivations of Efficacy Variables 
The 24-hour cough frequency (coughs per hour) for a specified visit is calculated as: 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 46 24-hour cough frequency = (total number of cough events during the monitoring period 
(24-hour interval))/24  
The awake cough frequency (coughs per hour) is defined as below: 
Awake  cough frequency = (total number of cough events during the monitoring period 
(24-hour interval) the subject is awake)/(Total duration (in hours) for the monitoring period 
the subject is awake)  
Awake duration (hours) is time between waking up and sleep during the 24-hour monitoring 
period.  
The cough data will contain all cough events occurring during that 24-hour monitoring 
period as well as the information about “sleep time” and “awake time”.  Any session with 
duration of recording < 4 hours will be considered as missing.  
In general, each 24-hour session is composed by an awake monitoring period and a sleep monitoring period. If a subject did not wake up before the end of the recording session, it will be assumed that the subject slept for the rest of the session. The session will have missing awake time, and t he rest of session will be considered under the sleep monitoring period. For 
any session with both sleep time and awake time missing, the entire 24 -hour session will be 
considered under the awake monitoring period, unless the session has early termination of recording.   
On each collection day, the cough count, the actual cough monitoring duration (in hours), and the coughs per hour will be derived for the total 24-hour period, the awake period, and the sleep period, respectively. 
The percent change in 24 -hour coughs per hour is defined as below: 
Percent change in 24 -hour cough frequency =  
[(Change from baseline in 24-hour cough frequency×100)/( Baseline 24 -hour cough 
frequency)]  
The proportion of partici pants with ≥  30% of reduction from baseline in 24-hour cough 
frequency is the number of partici pants with ≤ -30% change in 24-hour cough frequency 
divided by the total number of participants with available data. 8.4 Analysis Population s  
The FAS will serve as t he primary population for the analysis of efficacy data in this study. 
The FAS consists of all randomized subjects  who have taken at least one dose of study 
medication and provided at least one baseline and at least one post- baseline primary endpoint 
observation during the treatment period. Subjects  will be analyzed according to the treatment 
group to which they are randomized.  
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 47 The safety analysis set will be used for the analysis of safety data in this study. The safety 
analysis set will consist of all su bjects randomized who receive at least one  dose of study 
medication. Subjects will be classified  based upon the treatment received. For safety 
analyses, subjects  will be classified based upon the treatment received.   
The PK analysis set will consist of all subjects who receive ≥ 1 dose of serlopitant and who have at least 1 post- dose PK blood sample available for analysis . 
8.5 Subject Disposition  
An accounting of all randomiz ed subjects  by disposition will be presented. Subjects  who 
discontinue study drug prem aturely or withdraw from the study will be summarized and 
listed, with a description of the reason for early termination/withdrawal.  
8.6 Subject  Characteristics   
Demographic and other baseline characteristics will be summari zed. Duration of chronic 
cough (year s) will be derived as year of informed consent minus year of start date of the 
chronic cough medical history. 
8.7 Concomitant M edications   
Concomitant medications will be coded by the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary to Anatomical Therapeutic Cl assification (ATC) and preferred drug name. 
Concomitant medications will be summarized by ATC level and preferred drug name and listed.  
8.8 Treatment Compliance and Extent of Exposure  
Percent compliance will be calculated for each subject as below:  
% 100Therapy on  Be  Should   Days of Number Therapy on  Days of Number   Compliance Percent × =
 
 
A day within the study will be considered an “On- Therapy” day if the participant takes all 
required medication. If a subject misses a daily dose , that day is not considered an 
On-Therapy day.  
The duration of exposure for each participant will be evaluated by calculating the number of 
days on therapy.  
Percent compliance and duration of exposure to study medication will be summarized using 
descriptive statistics (mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum) for the safety analysis set.

Version 2.0  Page 48 8.9 Efficacy Analyses   
8.9.1 Statistical Hypotheses and Tests  
The study is designed to evaluate, the effic acy of serlopitant 5 mg  relative to placebo.  The 
primary hypothesis for this trial is th at serlopitant is superior to placebo with respect to the 
mean change from baseline in 24-hour cough frequency (on the log scale).  
Symbolically, the hypo theses for serlopitant 5 mg compared to placebo can be written as:  
H0: µSP,Week 12  - µ SP,Baseline  = µPL,Week12  - µ PL,Baseline  
HA: µSP,Week 12  - µ SP,Baseline < µPL,Week 12  - µ PL,Baseline 
where µSP and µPL represent the mean values at Week 12 for serlopitant 5 mg and placebo, 
respectively .  
As the primary endpoint, cough frequency, is to be analyzed on the log scale the null 
hypothesis relates to the ratio of Week 12/Baseline for serlopitant 5 mg being the same as that for placebo, and the alternative hypothesis being that the ratio of Week 12/B aseline for 
serlopitant 5 mg is smaller than the ratio for placebo . 
A family wise error rate will be controlled to adjust for multiplicity for the co mparison of 
serlopita nt 5 mg to placebo on the primary and key efficacy endpoints in a hierarchical 
manner (s ee details in  Section 8.9.4).  
8.9.2 Primary Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is change from baseline in 24-hour objective cough frequency at each dose studied after 12 weeks of treatment. A negative result indicates a decrease in cough frequency, while a positive result indicates an in crease in cough 
frequency.  
As the change in 24-hour cough f requency may have a skewed and wide distribution, the 
primary analysis for the primary endpoint will be on the natural log scale of the cough frequency data. The difference between serlopitant 5 mg  and placebo will be estimated using 
a mixed effect repeated measures (MMRM) model. The model will include factors for treatment, visit, country, sex, the treatment- by-visit interaction; and the log -transformed 
baseline value as a covariate. The MMRM model will use all available 24-hour cough frequency data on Day 28, 56, and 84. An unstructured covariance structure will be applied for MMRM. In case the model will not converge with the unstructured covariance structure, the heterogeneous compound symmetry (CSH) will be used instead. Contrasts will be constructed to  compare the serlopitant 5 mg group to the placebo group at each visit. 
The least -squares (LS) mean change from baseline (on the log scale) with the associated 
standard errors will be displayed for each treatment group. Estimated treatment differences (serlopitant vs. placebo) along with corresponding CIs will also be presented .  
In addition, the geometric mean of 24 -hour cough frequency will be presented by treatment 
and by visit. The percent difference change between serlopitant and placebo will be estimated 
Menlo Therapeutics Inc.  Confidential  
Proto col MTI -110 
Version 2.0  Page 49 by 100 (ediff - 1), where diff is the difference provided by the analysis of the log-transformed 
variable.   
An observation of zero coughs per hour will be replaced by a cough rate of 0.1/hr for the 
calculation of geometric means. If this rule is used t he table will have a footnote detailing the 
participant and treatment. Further details of the model specification, assumptions, and SAS implementation codes will be provided in the SAP. 
Furthermore, th e changes from baseline in 24 -hour cough frequency on t he original scale will 
be also analyzed using a the same MMRM model.  
8.9.2.1 Sensitivity Analysis  
The primary analyses (MMRM) for assessing primary efficacy variable are valid if the 
missing data are missing at random (MAR), meaning that the probability of a value  being 
missing, conditional on the observed data and factors in the statistical model, is random and not dependent on the unknown value of the missing data point. Therefore, two sensitivity analyses under missingness not at random (MNAR) will be conducted for the primary 
efficacy variable to evaluate the robustness of efficacy results and the effect of missing data.   
Sensitivity analysis using a copy -reference multiple -imputation method will be performed to 
assess the robustness of the primary analysis base d on MMRM. In this sensitivity analysis, 
intermittent missing values will be imputed using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) 
methodology which assumes a multivariate normal distribution over all variables included in the imputation model.  This imputation  will be done by treatment group, using MI procedure 
in SAS 9.4. This imputation will be done by treatment group. Then all the monotone missing values will be multiply -imputed using the imputation model built from the control group, i.e., 
assuming the missing data in the treatment group will have a profile that equals the profile of the control group for all time points (i.e., a copy-reference imputation). The missing data imputation will be implemented using PROC MI in SAS 9.4 with the MNAR statement. The change from baseline values from each of the completed datasets will then be analyzed using MMRM to include terms for treatment and baseline. The results will be combined using SAS PROC MIANALYZE. It is known that this approach may produce an inflated vari ance 
estimate for the treatment comparison. To get a correct variance, a pattern mixture model approximation method will also be used. Results from both the MIANALYZE and the pattern mixture model approximation will be presented as sensitivity analyses.  
An additional sensitivity analysis using the tipping -point approach will be conducted. The 
Variant 3 of the tipping point will be applied  (Ratitch 2013).  The technical details for the 
sensitivity analyses will be provided in the S AP.

Version 2.0  Page 52 8.9.4 Multiplicity Adjustment  
The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy profile of serlopitant 5 mg versus placebo. The 
sequential testing procedure will be employed to control the overall Type I error rate at 5% with respect to multiple comparisons for the primary and key secondary endpoints. The procedure will be done in a hierarchical manner. The order of the testing is outlined below.  
1. Primary endpoint: serlopitant 5 mg versus placebo 
2. Key secondary endpoint #1: serlopitant 5 mg versus placebo 
3. Key secondary endpoint #2: serlopitant 5 mg versus placebo 
4. Key secondary endpoint #3: serlopitant 5 m g versus placebo  
5. Key secondary endpoint #4: serlopitant 5 mg versus placebo 
 
First, the test ranked as first will be tested and the difference will be declared statistically 
significant if the one-sided p value is less than 0.05. Second, in case that the difference for the first comparison is statistically significant, the comparison ranked as second will be tested, and the difference will be declared statistically significant if the one-sided p- value is 
less than 0.05. The testing will continue as long as the previously ranked objective was statistically  significant.  
All other efficacy variables will be tested at the 0.05 level of significance without multiplicity adjustment.

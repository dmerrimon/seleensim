Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which causes cognitive decline and 
brain atrophy associated with the pathologic accumulation of amyloid and tau proteins. 
Passive immunization with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) contains amyloid antibodies 
and has been investigated as a potential safe diseas e-modifying strategy for Aβ clearance in 
AD. 1,2  
We conducted the first study investigating early administration of IVIG given in the pre -
dementia stage, MCI (mild cognitive impairment), of AD. The details of this randomized, double- , placebo -controlled trial have been previously published. 
3 Patients with MCI were 
randomized to receive either 0.4 g/kg of IVIG or 0.9% saline solution every 14 days x 5 infusions. The results showed that there was less brain atrophy in participants given IVIG 
when compared with placebo at 12 months as well as evidence of a sustained effect at 36 
months based on our extension study results.  
We suspect the primary mechanism of action of IVIG to be clearance of amyloid. However 
other possible mechanisms of IVIG have been proposed. IVIG also contains tau antibodies  
and has other immunomodulating properties including regulating effects on microglia which may be beneficial in modulating neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration in AD. 
4-7  
There has never been a published study in humans using amyloid imaging to demonstrate the 
treatment effects of IVIG in MCI. Here we propose use of both amyloid brain PET imaging and 
retinal amyloid imagin g (a novel surrogate scanner used to determine amyloid burden) to 
determine if IVIG treatment results in a measurable reduction in amyloid.  
3 STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
     3.1   Primary Objective  
This is a proof of concept study is to determine if changes in brain amyloid levels as measured by Florbetapir PET, as well as retinal amyloid levels in the retina are evident three months after 
infusion of 0.4 g/kg of IVIG every 14 days x 5 infusions . 
 
     3.2   Primary Endpoint s 
Change in  standard uptake values (SURV)  as measured by Florbetapir PET at baseline and 3 
months  and Retinal Amyloid Index  (RAI)  as measured by amyloid levels in the retina.  
4 STUDY PLAN  
 
     4.1   Study design 
This is  a single center,  open label, proof of concept, out -patient  study . Subjects  will undergo 
Florbetapir PET and have retinal amyloid levels measured , receive an infusion of IVIG at 0.4 
g/kg every  14 days for a total of five infusions , and repeat PET and retinal amyloid measures 
three months after the first infusion.  
 
     4.2   Subject population  
The study  population will consist  of male  and female subjects  diagnosed with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer disease (AD).

Page  9                                                                                                                              v 9.22.17  7 STUDY DRUG AND TREATMENT  
 
     7.1   Description of study drug 
Octagam  is an FDA approved 10%  human normal  immunoglobulin solution ready  for 
intravenous  administration.  Adverse Drug Reactions  (ADRs)  reported for Octagam  are 
expected to be similar  in type and intensity  to those reported with other  IVIG preparations.  
The Octagam  manufacturing process achieves a significant viral reduction through a 
combination of two dedicated manufacturing process steps: solvent/detergent (S/D) 
treatment and nanofiltration (20 nm). Based on the combination of these two steps, Octagam  
complies wit h the latest international consensus on best practices for viral safety. The 
Source Q chromatography (ion- exchange chromatography) step in the Octagam  process 
also contributes significantly to the viral safety of Octagam . The efficacy of the virus 
inactivation procedures  has been extensively  validated according  to relevant  international  
guidelines  in place.  Further  information can be found in the current  Investigator’s  Brochure.  
 
     7.2   Shipping, handling, and storage  
Octagam  will be shipped directly  to the pharmacy  or investigational site,  after all required  
regulatory  and legal documents  have been received by the Sponsor.  
Upon receipt  of the study  drug shipments,  the pharmacist  will verify the condition of the study  
drug and perform  study  drug accountability.  Acknowledgement  of receipt  will be documented 
in the Pharmacy  Binder.  A temperature logger  showing  the transport  temperature will be read 
out by the shipper  and release the drug if the transport  temperature is verified to be between 
+2°C  to + 8°C (36°F to 46°F).  If there was a deviation from this temperature range,  an 
Octapharma Project  Manager  or Qualified Person must  assess the temperature log and 
approve release.  
The study  drug will be stored in a secure  area with access restricted only  to authorized 
personnel.  Octagam  may be stored for 15 months  at +2°C  to + 8°C (36°F to 46°F)  from the 
date of manufacture.  
 
     7.3   Special precautions for storage  
• Do not freeze.  Frozen product  should not be used 
• Do not use after  expiration  date 
 
     7.4   Drug accountability  
The investigator  is responsible to ensure supervision of accurate monitoring of the receipt,  
storage and allocation of the study  drug.  Copies  of all invoices  of study  drug shipments  must  
be retained.  Accurate study  drug inventory,  dispensing  and accountability  logs must  be 
obtained and stored in the Pharmacy  Binder.  
 
     7.5   Study drug dosage  
The dose  level of IVIG at 0.4 g/kg will be administered by IV infusion  once every  14 days for 
two months.  Subject’s weight at the first infusion visit will be used for the dosing calculation for 
the remaining infusions. There is no provision for dose  adjustments  by the investigator  under  
this protocol.

9.22.17  
     7.6   Study drug preparation and infusion  
• The pharmacist  will prepare the IVIG for each infusion.  
• The IVIG should be inspected visually  for particulate matter  and discoloration prior  
to administration,  whenever  solution and container  permit.  Do not  use if turbid 
and/or  discoloration is observed.  
• The IVIG must  not be mixed  with other  medicinal  products  or administered 
simultaneously  with other  intravenous  preparation in the same infusion set.  Do not 
mix with IVIG products  from other  manufacturers.  
• Do not freeze.  Solutions  that have  been frozen should not  be used.  
• IVIG bottle is for single use only. Octagam  contains  no preservative.  Any bottle  that 
has been entered should be used promptly.  Partially  used  bottles  should be 
discarded.  
• Content  of IVIG bottles  may be pooled under  aseptic  conditions  into sterile infusion 
bags  and infused within  8 hours  after pooling  (within 72 hours  if stored at 2-8°C [36-
46°F]).  
• Do not use after expiration  date.  
• IVIG should not be diluted.  
• IVIG must  be allowed to warm  to room  or body  temperature prior to infusion  if stored 
at 2-8°C (36-46°F).  
• 0.4 g/kg body  weight  of Octagam  10% is transferred into an EVA infusion  bag. 
 
     7.7   Incompatibilities  
Octagam  must  not be mixed  with other  medicinal  products  or administered simultaneously  
with other  intravenous  preparations  in the same infusion set. 
 
     7.8   Administration  
• Octagam  should be at room  or body  temperature during  administration.  Only 
administer  intravenously.  
• Any bottle that  has been opened should be used promptly.  Partially  used bottles  
should be discarded.  
• Octagam  is not supplied with an infusion  set. If an in-line filter is used  the pore 
size should be 0.2  – 200 microns.  
• Do not use a needle of larger  than 16 gauge  to prevent  the possibility  of coring.  Insert  
needle only  once,  within the stopper  area delineated (by the raised ring for 
penetration).  The stopper  should be penetrated perpendicular  to the plane of the

Page  11                                                                                                                              v 
9.22.17 if tolerated,  advanced to 0.03 mL/kg/min  (180 mg/kg/hr)  for the third 30 minutes  and, if 
tolerated,  advanced to 0.04 mL/kg/min (240 mg/kg/hr)  for the remaining  time at the discretion 
of the treating Investigator . 
If adverse events  (AEs)  occur  during  infusion,  the rate should be reduced to half the rate at 
which  the event  occurred,  or the infusion interrupted until symptoms  subside.  The infusion 
may then be resumed at  a rate tolerated by the patient.  
The batch number(s)  and number  of different  vial sizes  used will be recorded on the drug 
accountability  form.  
 
     7.1   Concomitant therapy  
Concomitant  medications  will be assessed  at all study  visits.  Concomitant  medications  are 
prescribed or over-the-counter  medications  and should be consistent  with the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria.  Concomitant  medication appropriate to the subject’s  condition may 
be prescribed during the course  of the study  with the exception of those listed above.  
 
Routine vaccinations  (i.e., flu vaccination)  with commercially  available  therapeutics  are permitted 
but must  not be given  within  four weeks  before  or after the administration of the study  drug.   
8 EVALUATIONS BY VISIT  
 
The overall summary  of study  activities by visit is provided Section 1.  
 
Screening  procedures  at visit 1 will take place up to 28 days prior to Visit 2 (Day 1) dosing.  
Screening  labs and assessments  will be performed during the  screening  period.  The first 
dose of study  drug is administered on Day 1. Visits  2 through 6 have a ±1 day window  and 
occur  every  14 days over two months.  The investigator  will determine if a subject  is suitable to 
continue following  a missed infusion.  Visit 7 has a ±7 day window.  
 
All study  screening  data from Visit 1 including  laboratory  results  must  be reviewed for study  
eligibility  prior to receiving  first dose of study  drug. Prior to infusion,  a review  of concomitant  
medications  and AEs takes place . If the subject  continues  to be eligible  for enrollment,  the 
subject  will be infused with study  medication and will remain in the infusion clinic  for at least 1 
hour following  the infusion  for safety  assessments  on Visit 2 (Day 1) , and 15 minutes for the 
subsequent visits .

9.22.17 9 WITHDRAWAL AND REPLACEMENT OF SUBJECTS  
 
     9.1   Criteria for subject withdrawal  
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and other  applicable regulations,  a subject  has 
the right to withdraw  from the study  at any time and for any reason.  If a subject  requests  or 
decides  to withdraw,  every  attempt  will be made  to complete an early  termination visit.  
The investigator  has the right to withdraw  subjects  from the study  if a subject:  
• Is in significant  violation of  the protocol  
• Experiences  an intolerable AE or SAE 
• Is non-compliant  
• Withdrawal  of consent  
• Lost to follow  up 
• Death 
 
     9.2   Replacement of subjects 
Subjects who do not complete all five infusions will be replaced.  
10 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 
     10.1 Adverse event definition 
An AE is any untoward event  that occurs  any time after randomization to the double blind 
treatment  until the end of study  (visit 7 or ET visit).  The event  need not have a causal 
relationship with the study  drug or treatment.  Adverse events  include,  but are not limited  to 
clinically  significant  changes  in clinical status,  physical  or neurological examinations,  ECG,  
abnormal laboratory  findings,  exacerbations  of underlying  disease,  and drug interactions,  
dependency,  misuse  and abuse.  All AEs must  be documented on the Adverse  Event  page of 
the CRF and in the  subject’s  medical notes.  Each  AE is evaluated for duration,  severity,  
seriousness,  relatedness  to study  drug,  and action  taken.  The investigator  may be asked to 
provide follow -up information.  
 
     10.2 Serious adverse event (SAE) definition  
A serious  adverse event  is one that  at any dose  (including  overdose):  
• Results  in death 
• Is life-threatening1 
• Requires  inpatient  hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results  in persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity2 
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• Is a medically  important  condition:

9.22.17 Cerebral hemorrhage resulting  in clinical disability,  or 
Other  reactions  that should be reported in an expedited manner  although 
they did not immediately  result  in one of the above  seriousness  criteria  
     10.3 Other relevant drug safety information  
Any safety  information relating  to: 
• Pregnancies/breastfeeding,  
• Drug  abuse (persistent, sporadic  or intentional excessive use of a medicinal 
product  inconsistent  with the SPC or acceptable medical  practice),  
• Overdose (treatment  exceeding  the medically  recommended dose),  
• Medication errors  (prescribing  or dispensing  error),  
• Interactions  with other  medicinal products  or devices  
• Associated with Octagam  10%,  even if no adverse drug reaction occurred.  
 
1“Life-threatening”  means  that the subject  was at immediate risk of death  at the time of  the serious  adverse event;  it 
does  not refer to a serious  adverse event  that hypothetically  might  have  caused death if  it were more  severe.  
2“Persistent  or significant  disability  or incapacity”  means  that there  is a substantial  disruption of a person’s  ability  to 
carry  out normal  life functions.  
 
     10.4 Adverse event severity  
Severity  of AEs will be assessed using the National  Cancer  Institute  (NCI)  Common 
Terminology  Criteria  for Adverse Events  (CTCAE)  Version 4.0 for toxicity  and adverse event  
reporting.  A copy of the CTCAE  Version 4.0 can be downloaded  from the CTEP  homepage  
(http://ctep.info.nih.gov ). AEs not corresponding  to the CTCAE  term will be assessed  
according  to their impact on the subject’s  ability  to perform  daily activities  as follows:  
• Mild (grade 1) – the AE does  not interfere in a significant  manner  with 
the subject’s  normal  functioning  level.  It may be an annoyance.  
• Moderate (grade 2) – the AE produces  some impairment  of functioning,  
but is not hazardous  to health.  It is uncomfortable or an embarrassment.  
• Severe (grade 3) – the AE produces  significant  impairment  of functioning  
or incapacitation and is  a definite hazard to the subject’s  health.  
• Life threatening (grade 4) – Life threatening  or disabling.  
• Fatal  (grade 5)  Causes  death of the participant.  
The investigator  must  appraise all abnormal  laboratory  results  for their clinical significance.  If 
any abnormal  laboratory  result  is considered clinically  significant,  the investigator  must  
provide details  about  the action taken with respect  to the test drug and about  the patient’s  
outcome.  
 
     10.5 Adverse event reporting 
All AEs, whether  observed  by the investigator  or reported by the patient,  must  be recorded,  
with details  about the duration and intensity  of each episode,  the action taken with respect  to 
the test drug,  and the patient’s  outcome.  The investigator  must  evaluate each adverse 
experience for its relationship  to the test drug and for its seriousness.  The initial report  must

9.22.17 be as complete as  possible,  including  details  of the current  illness  and (serious)  adverse 
event,  and an assessment  of the causal relationship between the event  and the 
investigational  product(s).  Information not available at the time of the initial report  (e.g., an 
end date for the adverse event  or laboratory  values  received after the report)  must  be 
documented on a follow - up form.  A final report to document  resolution of the adverse event  
is required.  
 
     10.6 Investigator reporting to the FDA  
Adverse drug reactions  that are serious,  unlisted/unexpected,  and at least  possibly  
associated to the drug,  and that have  not previously  been reported in the Investigators  
brochure,  or reference safety  information document  should be reported promptly  to the FDA in 
writing  by each investigator/physician engaged in clinical  research.  A clear  description of the 
suspected reaction should be provided  along  with an assessment  as to whether  the event  is 
drug or disease related.  
The investigator/physician shall  notify  the FDA by telephone or  by fax of any unexpected fatal 
or life threatening  experience associated with the use of the drug as soon  as possible,  but no 
later than 7 calendar  days after the sponsors  initial receipt  of the information.  Each  phone call 
or fax shall be transmitted to the FDA new drug review  division in the Center  for Drug 
Evaluation and Research or  the product  review  division  in the Center  for Biologics  Evaluation 
and Research that has responsibility  for review  of the IND if applicable.  
 
     10.7 Reporting of adverse drug reactions and other safety information

Regulatory Affairs )  
Oberlaaer  Strasse  235 
A-1100 Vienna,  Austria  
 
All AE reports  must  include the patient  number,  age, sex, weight,  severity  of reaction (mild,  
moderate,  severe),  relationship to study  drug (probably  related,  unknown relationship,  
definitely  not related),  date and time of administration of test medications  and all concomitant  
medications,  and medical treatment  provided.  The investigator  is responsible  for evaluating  all 
adverse events  to determine whether  criteria  for “serious”  and as defined above are present.  
12 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
 
When  an emergency  occurs  that requires  a deviation from the protocol  for a subject,  a 
deviation will be made only  for that subject.  A decision will  be made as  soon as possible to  
determine whether  or not the subject  (for whom  the deviation from protocol was effected)  is to 
continue in the study. The subject’s  medical  records  will completely  describe the deviation 
from the protocol and state the reasons  for such deviation.  In addition,  the Investigator  will 
notify  the SHIRB  in writing  of such deviation from protocol.  
Non-emergency  minor  deviations  from the protocol  will be permitted with approval of  the 
principal investigator.  
13 DATA RECORDING, RETENTION, AND MONITORING  
 
     13.1 Data entry and maintenance

9.22.17 Study  personnel will construct  case report  forms  (CRFs),  record all study  data onto the CRFs  
and enter  the data into a 21 CFR Part  11 compliant  database.  
 
     13.2 Study records retention 
The investigator  must  ensure that the records  and documents  pertaining to the conduct  of the 
study  and the distribution  of the study  drug,  that is copies  of CRFs  and source documents  
(original documents,  data,  and records  [e.g.,  hospital  records;  clinical and office  charts;  
laboratory  notes;  memoranda;  subject’s  diaries  or evaluation checklists;  SAE reports,  
pharmacy  dispensing records;  recorded data from automated instruments;  copies  or 
transcriptions  certified  after verification as  being accurate copies;  microfiches;  photographic  
negatives,  microfilm,  or magnetic  media;  x-rays;  subject  files; and records  kept at the 
pharmacy,  at the laboratories,  and at medico- technical departments  involved in the clinical  
study;  documents  regarding subject  treatment  and study  drug accountability;  original signed 
informed consents,  etc.])  be retained by the investigator  for as long as needed to comply  with 
national and international  regulations  (generally  2 years  after discontinuing  clinical 
development  or after the last marketing  approval).  The investigator  agrees  to adhere to the 
document/records  retention procedures  by signing the protocol.  
 
     13.3 Data monitoring committee  
The Data Monitoring  Committee  (DMC)  will be composed of independent  reviewers  who will 
meet  to review  the efficacy  and safety  data and determine a risk/benefit  analysis  in this 
subject  population.  The purpose of the DMC  is to advise  on serious  safety  considerations,  lack 
of efficacy,  and any  other  considerations  within the charge to the Committee. The DMC may 
request  additional meetings  or safety  reports  as deemed necessary  upon discussion  with the 
investigator  or Octapharma and its  representatives.  The DMC  may stop the study  following  
review  of results  from the interim  analysis.  
14 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
 
     14.1 Primary endpoint  
Graphs of individual changes in standard uptake ratio values (SURV) of Florbetapir PET will be 
compared between baseline and 3 months. G raphs of individual changes in RAI values will  be 
compared between baseline and 3 months.  
15 SAMPLE SIZE 
Five subjects will be included. If it appears that IVIG shows changes in these two markers, a 
large trial will be considered.  
16 IMPLICATIONS AND DIRECTION FOR FUTURE STUDIES  
This study will help determine if the reason that IVIG treatment appears to reduce brain atrophy in patients with MCI is due to a reduction of CNS (central nervous system) amyloid levels.  
17 ETHICAL AND LEGAL ISSUES  
The study  will be submitted to the SHIRB.  A data safety  monitoring committee will be 
convened to provide oversight  of subjects’ safety  before commencement  of the study.  
     17.1 Institutional review board approval

9.22.17 principles  outlined in the Declaration  of Helsinki.  The review  of this protocol  by the SHIRB  and 
the performance of all aspects  of the study,  including  the methods  used for obtaining  informed 
consent,  must  also be in accordance with principles  enunciated in the declaration,  as well as 
ICH Guidelines,  Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations  (CFR),  Part 50 Protection of 
Human Subjects  and Part 56 Institutional Review  Boards.  
The investigator  will be responsible for preparing documents  for submission to the SHIRB  and 
obtaining  written approval  for this study.  The approval will  be obtained prior  to the initiation  of 
the study.  
The approval  for both the protocol and informed consent  must  specify  the date of approval,  
protocol  number  and version,  or amendment  number.  
Any amendments  to the protocol after  receipt  of SHIRB  approval must  be submitted by the 
Investigator  to the SHIRB  for approval.  The Investigator  is also responsible for notifying  the 
SHIRB  of any serious  deviations  from the protocol,  or anything else that may involve  added 
risk to subjects.  
Any advertisements  used  to recruit  subjects  for the study  must  be reviewed  and approved by 
the SHIRB prior to use. 
 
     17.2 Informed consent  
Informed consent  of a subject  or his/her  designee  prior to any study  related procedures  must 
be obtained  per GCPs  as set forth in the CFR and ICH guidelines.  
Documentation that informed consent  occurred prior to the subject’s  entry  into the study  and 
the informed consent  process  should be recorded in the subject’s source  documents.  The 
original consent  form signed and dated by  the subject  and by the person consenting  the 
subject  prior to the subject’s  entry  into the study,  must  be maintained in the investigator’s  
study  files. 
 
     17.3 Subject confidentiality  
Octapharma affirms  the subject’s  right to protection  against  invasion of privacy.  In compliance 
with United States  federal  regulations,  Octapharma requires  the investigator  to permit  
Octapharma representatives  and, when necessary,  representatives  of the FDA or other  
regulatory  authorities  to review  and/or  copy any medical records  relevant  to the study  in 
accordance with local laws.  
Should direct  access to medical records  require a waiver  or authorization separate from the 
subject’s  statement  of informed consent,  it is the responsibility  of the Investigator  to obtain 
such  permission in writing  from the appropriate individual.  
 
     17.4 Protocol amendments  
Any amendment  to this protocol  must  be agreed to by the principal  investigator  and reviewed 
by Octapharma.  Amendments  should only be submitted to the SHIRB after consideration of 
Octapharma review.  Written  verification  of SHIRB  approval  will be obtained before any  
amendment  is implemented.

19 APPENDIX  A:  NINCDS -ADRDA  criteria for diagnosis Alzheimer  Disease 8 
 
• Dementia established by  clinical examination and documented by the Mini-Mental 
State Test,  Blessed Dementia Scale or  some similar  examination,  and confirmed by 
neuropsychological tests  
• Deficits  in two or more  areas  of cognition  
• Progressive worsening of memory  and other  cognitive  functions  
• No disturbance of consciousness  
• Onset  between ages  40 and 90, most  often  after age 65 
• Absence of systemic disorders  or other  brain diseases  that in and of themselves  
could  account  for the progressive  deficits in memory  and cognition 
20.0.1 The diagnosis  of probable Alzheimer  disease is supported by: 
• Progressive deterioration of specific  cognitive skills  such as language (aphasia),  
motor  skills  (apraxia),  and perception (agnosia)  
• Impaired activities  of daily living  and altered patterns  of behavior  
• Family  history  of similar  disorders,  particularly  if confirmed neuropathologically  
• Laboratory  results  of: 
1. Normal lumbar  puncture as evaluated by standard techniques  
2. Normal pattern or  nonspecific  changes  in EEG,  such  as increased slow-
wave  activity  
3. Evidence of  cerebral  atrophy  on CT with progression documented by 
serial  Observation  
20.0.2 Other  clinical features  consistent  with the diagnosis  of probable 
Alzheimer  disease,  after exclusion of causes  of dementia other  than 
Alzheimer  disease:  
• Plateaus  in the progression of the illness  
• Associated symptoms  of depression,  insomnia,  incontinence,  delusions,  illusions,  
hallucinations;  catastrophic  verbal,  emotional,  or physical outbursts,  sexual  
disorders,  and weight  loss 
• Other  neurologic  abnormalities  in some patients,  especially  with more  advanced 
disease and including motor  signs  such as increased muscle  tone,  myoclonus,  or gait 
disorder  
• Seizures  in advanced disease 
• CT normal  for age 
20.0.3 Features  that make the diagnosis  of probable Alzheimer  
disease  uncertain or unlikely  include:

9.22.17 • Sudden,  apoplectic  onset  
 
 
• Focal  neurologic  findings  such  as hemiparesis,  sensory  loss, visual  field deficits,  
and incoordination early  in the course  of the illness  
• Seizures  or gait disturbances  at the onset  or very early  in the course of the illness  
20.0.4 5. Criteria  for diagnosis  of definite Alzheimer  disease are: 
• The clinical  criteria  for probable Alzheimer  disease and, in addition,  
histopathological  evidence obtained from a biopsy  or autopsy.

9.22.17 20 APPENDIX C: INSTRUCTIONS FOR FLORBETAPIR PET  
Imaging will be acquired on a Siemens Biograph mCT (Ultra High- Definition PET/40 slice 
CT) scanner. Dosing will be 10 mCi Florbetapir in a peripheral vein with saline flush. A 10-
minute acquisition will be obtained 30 to 50 minutes after administration. Image data will be 
processed by iterative reconstruction with all corrections (TOF, PSF modeling, scatter) 256 
matrix, 2X zoom, 2.0 Gaussian filter. Images will be interpreted by a radiologist/nuclear 
medicine physician trained to read Florbetapir studies. Patients with positive studies 
(moderate to frequent beta amyloid neuritic plaques) will be included in the study and will 
undergo a repeat Florbetapir PET/CT brain imaging study 3 months later after treatment with 
either IVIG or placebo.   
 Analysis: Florbetapir is normally washed out of the cerebellar cortical gray matter in bot h 
healthy controls (HC) and in Alzheimer’s dementia patients (AD). As such, it is used as the reference region for SUVR calculation. Regions of interest will be drawn around areas of 
cerebral gray matter in the frontal, lateral temporal, parietal and parieto -occipital regions 
using the fused PET/CT images and SUVRs will be calculated using the ratio of these SUV values to the value in the cerebellar gray standard uptake value.

     21.2 Imaging Procedure  
The imaging shall use the Retia device with software version 1.4.5 or later.  
For each study scan, capture autofluorescence images of the Superior field in 3 focal plans, up to 
6 images each 
a. Image set 1 of 3  
i. First image –  Full automatic IR and AFL of superior field.  
 ii. Images 2 to up to 6  
 1. Review the fully automatic IR image and read/record the machine diopter set point (to 
the tenths digit, e.g. 2.4)  
 2. Start a new exam, select Superior, and then go to Manual Alignment and Focus 
mode  
 a. Use the slider and joystick buttons to enter the previously recorded autofocus 
value to the nearest tenth of an MD.  
 b. Use the on- screen but tons and take one IR and then the sequence of 5 AFL 
images (one every 5 - 10 seconds, the LED cycle time).  
b. Image set 2 of 3 i. Without exiting the exam,  
ii. Move the focus point - 2 MD using the slider and/or the joystick buttons (e.g. if the initial 
focus point was 2.4, then move the focus point to 0.4).  
iii. Use the on -screen buttons to take one IR and then the sequence of up to 6 AFL images, 
one every 5 or so seconds.  
c. Image set 3 of 3  
i. Without exiting the exam,  
ii. Move the focus point +4 MD (+2 MD from the original recorded focus point, 4.4 in our 
example here) using the slider and/or the joystick buttons.  
iii. Use the on -screen buttons to take  one IR and then the sequence of up to 6 AFL images.

11.1. ADVERSE EVENT DEFINITIONS
Adverse events (A Es)collected in this study will be limited to death, serious injury, angiographic 
complications related to the index procedure , revascularizations , amputations of either lower limb ,
myocardial infarction and stroke .  For the purposes of this study, pre-planned interventions noted at 
baseline are not considered AEs.
Major adverse e vents (MAE s)are defined for the purpose of the data analyses of the study 
endpoints and include:
oDeath within 30 days of index procedure
oUnplanned major (above the ankle) amputation of the target limb
oClinically -driven TLR and/or TVR of the target limb
 
Device -related serious injur ies, including death, are required by the FDA to be reported as part 
ofpost market surveillance of medical devices per 21 Code of Federal Regulations ( CFR ) 803.  
Serious injury means an injury or illness that is device related and includes the following :
oIs life -threatening,
oResults in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to a body 
structure, or
oNecessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of a body 
function or permanent damage to a body structure.
Device related means related to any interventional device used during index procedure on the 
target limb .
Permanent means irreversible impairment or dama ge to a body structure or function, excluding 
trivial impairment or damage.
Medical interventions may include hospitalizations or prolonged hospitalizations due to the use of 
the interventional devices used in this study.
Procedural angiographic events that occur during index procedure on the target limb regardless 
of device relatedness that include the following:
oDissection s of target lesion 
oPerforation sof target lesion 
oSlow flow/no re-flow 
oAcute vessel closure 
oDistal embol ization
oThrombus formation
oOther angiographic complications determined reportable by treating physician
Revascularization or amputation of either lower limb that occur sduring subject ’s
participation in the study
Myocardial Infarction that occurs within 30 days following enrollment
Stroke that occurs within 30 days following enrollment
Death (all causes) throughout study participation

LIBERTY 360° Study Protocol 
Page 18of 20pre-approve all changes to the ICF prior to initial submission to the IRB.  A copy of the original IRB -
approved ICF must be sent to the Sponsor prior to study start while the original must be retained at 
the study site.  If the ICF is amended by the reviewing IRB, a copy of the approved document must be 
provided to the Sponsor prior to enrollment of subjects in the study.
The Investigator or authorized designee must administer th eapproved ICF to each prospective study 
subject. Informed consent must be obtained in accordance with the applicable guidelines of 21 CFR 
Part 50 and local laws and regulations, whichever represents the greater protection of the individual.  
This study will be registered on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov .  The following statement will be 
included in the ICFfor the study to notify the prospective subjects for the study:  " A description of 
this clinical trial will be available on http://www.ClinicalTrials.gov, as required by U.S. Law.  This 
Web site will not include information that can identify you.  At most, the website will include a 
summar y of the results.  You can searc h this website at any time."
19.3. CONFIDENTIALITY
All information and data sent to the Sponsor concerning subjects or their participation in this study 
will be considered confidential.  All data used in the analysis and reporting of this data will be used in 
a manner without identifiable reference to the subject.  The Investigator consents to visits by the 
Sponsor or designee and authorized governmental body to review the study subjects’ medical records, 
including any test or laboratory data that mayhave been recorded on diagnostic test media (e.g., 
angiogram ).
19.4. SPONSOR RESPONSIBILIT IES
Sponsor responsibilities include but are not limited to :
Select ion of Principal Investigators , study s ites,and Core Lab oratorie swho participate in the 
study ;
Training of participating study sites including the Investigator and staff conducting the study ;
Providing f inancial support to each study site which is fair, reasonable, and equitable to fair 
market value ;
Follow ing/promoting all applicable regulatory standards per applicable regulations at each 
study site; and,
Ownership and control of the use of data, including review and approval of study -related 
publications/presentations , etc.
19.5. INVESTIGATOR RESPONS IBILITIES
The I nvestigator is responsible for the following:
Protecting the rights, safety , and welfare of su bjects.
Conduct ingthe investigation in accordance with the Clinical Trial Agreement with the 
Sponsor, the Protocol, applicable FDA regulations ,including 21 CFR Part 50 and56, and any 
conditions of approval imposed by theIRB.
Delegation of study -related tasks to qualified personnel under their supervision as may be
applicable ; however, the Principal Investigator remains responsible for the proper conduct of 
the clinical study.  
Enrollment will commence when the Sponsor has received all required document ation , 
including but not limited to the signed Clinical Trial A greement and IRB approvals.
At each site, appropriate procedures must be followed to maintain subject confidentiality 
according to the Health Insurance Por tability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations .  
Each site may have its own internal procedures or requirements for use and release of subject 
medical information in research studies.  Each Investigator is responsible for obtaining

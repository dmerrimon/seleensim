Title of Study: A Phase 1B Study to Evaluate the Safety and Induction of Immune Response of CRS -207 in 
Combination with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin as Front -line Therapy in Adults  with Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma  
Primary Investigator: Raffit Hassan, M.D.  
Number of Sites:  Up to 7  
Phase of Development: Phase 1B  Treatment Period: 25 Weeks  Study Duration: 7 years  
Objectives:  
Primary:  To determine the safety of CRS -207 (with or without low -dose cyclophosphamide  [Cy] given one day prior  
CRS -207) when administered in combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin and to evaluate the induction of immune 
response to mesothelin as measured by IFN -gamma ELISPOT assay prior to treatment and at time points during and 
after treatment.  
Secondary:  To evaluate o bjective tumor response,  progression free survival,  time to progression,  overall survival,  and 
the predictive value of serum mesothelin for therapeutic response  for each treatment regimen . 
Exploratory:  i) conduct  immune subset analysis (e.g. CD4, CD8, T reg) and gene expression profiling of tumor tissue 
pre- and post -vaccination; ii) to assess  induction of anti -mesothelin humoral immune response; iii) to measure tumor 
marker kinetics  as biomarkers of tumor response ; iv) evaluate the association between pulmo nary function 
improvement and tumor response; v) evaluate the relationship of tumor response to overall survival .  
Methodology:  
This is a phase 1B  study to evaluate the safety and induction of immune response of CRS -207 (with or without Cy) in 
combination with pemetrexed and cisplatin in front -line therapy of adults  with malignant pleural m esothelioma  
(MPM) . 
 
Up to  16 subjects were original ly planned to be enrolled in this study.  Up to an additional 44 subjects will be enrolled 
in an expans ion phase of this study  (for a total of up to 60 subjects) to obtain additional safety , immune  and efficacy 
data.  Subjects will be enrolled into 2 mutually exclusive cohorts described below.   
 Cohort 1: At least 32 subjects will receive 2 infusions (prime vaccinations; PV) of CRS -207 (1 × 10
9 CFU given 
intravenously [ i.v.] over approximately 1  hour) 2 weeks apart followed 2 weeks later by up to 6 cycles of pemetrexed 
and cisplatin 3 weeks apart.  Three weeks after completion of chemotherapy, subjects  will receive an additional 2 
infusions (boost vaccinations; BV) of CRS -207 3 weeks apart.  Subjects enrolled in Cohort 1 include the 16 subjects 
originally planned plus a minimum of the first 16 subjects enrolled into the expansion phase.  
 Cohort 2: The r emaining subjects enrolled in the expansion phase (up to 28 total) will receive CRS -207 in 
combination with chemotherapy at the dose and schedule described above, h owever, these subjects will also receive 
low-dose Cy (200 mg/m
2) intravenously over 30 minutes one day prior to each CRS -207 infusion ( i.e. prior to each 
PV and BV infusion).   Low-dose Cy inhibits regulatory T cells and enhances immune responses when given in 
context with vaccine s1-3.  Preclinical  studies of low -dose Cy given prior to CRS -207 in mouse tumor models have  
shown improve d immunogenicity and survival ( Section 1.3). 
 All subjects will return to the clinic 4 weeks after their 2
nd boost vaccination for an End of Course (EOC) visit.  
Subjects will have follow -up visits 4 weeks after the EOC visit and every 8 weeks thereafter until treatment I

Safety and follow -up: 
The i nitial safety of CRS -207 (with or without Cy), pemetrexed  and cisplatin  treatment  will be monitored closely.  
Subjects  will be followed for AEs and dose -limiting toxicities ( Section 3.6 ) which may warrant either CRS -207 dose  
reduction or halting treatment after review by the lead investigator, sponsor and medical monitor.  A  7-day course of 
oral amoxicillin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in penicillin -allergic subjects ) will be administered to eliminate  
any residual CRS -207 beginning 7 days following the second dose (prime vaccination) of CRS -207 during the 
induction phase  and after the final study  dose of CRS -207.  All subjects will complete an End of Study (EOS ) visit no 
more than four weeks following the final dose of study medication or prior to receipt of other cancer -related CRS-207

treatment . To eliminate any potentially residual CRS -207, subjects will be administered a 7 -day course of antibiotics 
beginning at the EOS  visit and prior to receiving any subsequent cancer -related therapy.   Blood will be collected at 
EOS  to assess the clearance of CRS -207 . 
 
Subjects will return to the study site for an End of Course (EOC) visit approximately 4 weeks after their 2nd boost 
vaccination  for safety , clinical response,  and immune resp onse evaluations.  Thereafter,  subjects will have follow -up 
visits 4 weeks after the EOC visit and every 8 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation .  Subjects will continue 
to receive maintenance vaccinations (MV) with (Cohort 2) or without Cy (Cohort 1) following their original schedule 
at each follow -up visit if they are clinically stable and continue to meet dosing eligibility.  
Number of subjects (planned):  
Up to 16 subjects with MPM who meet  all eligibility criteria were originally planned to be enrolled  in the study.   Up 
to 44 additional subjects (for a total of 60 subjects) with MPM who meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled in an 
expansion  phase of the study .   
Subject discontinuation:  
A subject may be removed from the s tudy for the following reasons:  
(1) Occurrence of an adverse event that presents an unacceptable consequence or risk to the subject  
(2) Development of an illness or complication (including progressive disease) that justifies withdrawal from the 
study, as determined by the investigator and medical monitor  
(3) Noncompliance: failure to receive clinical study medication or treatment as mandated by the protocol,  or failure to 
comply with protocol requirements  
(4) Study discontinued by the sponsor  
 Subjects who withdraw consent or are removed from the study before completing at least 4 cycles of chemotherapy  
may be replaced at the discretion of the investigator and Aduro Biotech, Inc . (Aduro).  Subjects may continue on 
treatment with radiographic disease progression if subject is clinically stable and the investigator believes the 
treatment is providing benefit.

(500 mg/m2) and cisplatin (75 mg/m2) every 3 weeks × 6 cycles, CRS -207 with or without Cy (2 infusions , 3 weeks 
apart )] is 25 weeks .  Subject s enrolled in Cohort 1 will receive CRS -207 and pemetrexed and cisplatin per the 
schedule described abo ve.  Subjects enrolled in Cohort 2 will receive Cy/CRS -207 and pemetrexed and cisplatin  per 
the schedule  described above.  Clinical and immune response assessments  will be performed 4 weeks after EOC .  
Eligible subjects will receive maintenance vaccinations of CRS -207 (with or without Cy) beginning at the first follow -
up visit and every visit thereafter .   
Reference therapy, dose, and mode of administration:  
There is no reference therapy or placebo administered in this study.   
Criteria for Evaluation:  
Safety: Safety will be assessed by collection of data on AEs, vital signs, physical examination, clinical hematology, 
serum chemistry , deaths , and blood cultures for CRS -207 clearance.    
Efficacy: Induction of immune response to mesothelin  will be evaluated by IFN-gamma ELISPOT assay  prior to 
treatment and at time points during and after treatment.  Other evaluations will include immune subset analysis ( e.g. 
CD4, CD8 , T reg) by immunohistochemistry  and gene expression profiling of tumor tiss ue pre and post vaccination , 
evaluating  induction of anti -mesothelin humoral immune response  by ELISA, assessing tumor marker kinetics  by 
measuring serum levels of mesothelin and CA -125 and plasma osteopontin.  Objective tumor response, progression 
free su rvival  and time to progression  will be measured using modified RECIST for assessment of response in MPM 
(Appendix A)  and immune -related response criteria (irRC; Appendix B) .  Pulmonary function will be measured by 
forced vital capacity ( FVC ), forced expira tory volume in 1 second (FEV1 ) and vital capacity ( VC).   
Data analysis:  
The sample size of the study  was originally planned to enroll up to 16 subjects in order to evaluate the induction of

Up to 44 additional subjects will be enrolled in an expansion  phase  to obtain additional safety , immune  and 
preliminary efficacy data.  At least 32 subjects will be enrolled i n Cohort 1 and up to 28 subjects will be enrolled in 
Cohort 2.   The expansion cohort of up to 44 additional subjects, including subjects receiving Cy one day prior to 
CRS -207 (Cohort 2) is intended to obtain additional safety, immune and efficacy data for future study planning.  The 
expansion sample size is based on practical rather than statistical considerations.   
These data will be summarized in tables listing the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, and 
number of subjects in a group for continuous data; in tables listing count and percentage for categorical data; and 
median and standard error for time -to-event data.  Data will be listed for each subject.  Statistical analyses will be 
performed and data appendices will be created by using SAS.  The effects of noncompliance, dropouts, and covariates 
will be assessed to determine the impact on the general applicability of results from this study .   
Efficacy analyses  will be conducted on the full analysis set and per protocol analysis set.  Th e full analysis set will 
consist of all subjects who receive at least one dose of  any study treatment .  The per protocol analysis set will consist 
of all subjects with MPM  who receive the initial 2 prime vaccinations with CRS -207 (with or without Cy) and at least 
4 cycles of pemetrexed and cisplatin.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 1 1.0 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 BACKGROUND  
Malignant mesothelioma is a rare tumor that arises from mesothelial cells.  
Approximately 2,000 to 4,500 new cases of mesothelioma are diagnosed in the United States each year .
5,6  Pleural mesothelioma is most common, but 
mesothelioma can also occur in the peritoneum and pericardium.  In the United 
States, th e majority of mesotheliomas occur in men (approximately 80%).  These 
are most often of pleural origin, and 90% or more of these tumors are caused by 
asbestos.6-8  
1.1.1 Current Therapies for Malignant Mesothelioma  
The best -documented, potentially curative approach to malignant pleural 
mesothelioma (MPM) has been extrapleural pneumonectomy, followed by chemotherapy and radiothe rapy in selected patients with earlier stages of 
disease,
6,9 but the majority of patients present with advanced disease and are not 
candidates for surgical resection.  For patients whose disease is unresectable or who otherwise are not candidates for curative surgery, pemetrexed in combination with cisplatin is the standard of care.  In a randomized Phase 3 clinical  trial 
treatment with pemetrexed and cisplatin led to an improvement in overall survival of 12.7 months compared to 9.3 months with cisplatin alone.  The objective response rate was 41% .
10,11  It is clear that new therapies are needed, and 
immunotherapy offers the promise of improving outcomes in these patients by 
developing specific immune responses against tumor antigens.  In support of this 
notion, the presence of high levels of CD8+ tumor -infiltrating ly mphocytes is 
associated in better prognosis in patients undergoing extrapleural pneumonectomy for MPM .
12 
1.1.2 Mesothelin  
Mesothelin is a cell surface tumor differentiation antigen present on normal mesothelial cells that is highly expressed in many human tumors including 
virtually all mesothelioma and pancreatic cancers, 55% to 71% of ovarian cancers 
and 41% to 55% of lung adenocarcinomas .
13-19  The limited distribution of 
mesothelin in normal human tissues and high expression in many cancers makes it an attractive candidate for antibody -targeted immunotherapy and clinical trials of 
anti-mesothelin antibodies are currently ongoing .
20,21  Studies by Dr. Raffit 
Hassan, the Principal Investigator of the proposed trial, and his colleagues as well 
 
  
 Aduro Biotech , Inc.  
Protocol ADU -CL-02-v8 CRS -207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin  
 
 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 2 as other groups have shown mesothelin to be also an attractive antigen for active 
cancer immunotherapy.  Dr. Hassan and colleagues have previously shown that a mesothelin -specific IgG antibody response is present in 39% and 42% of patients 
with mesothelioma and ovarian cancer respectively, suggesting that immune tolerance to mesothelin can be overcome .
22  In addition, studies by Dr. Elizabeth 
Jaffee and colleagues have demonstrated that in patients with pancreatic carcinoma, positive clinical outcomes following vaccination with an irradiated 
allogeneic whole cell vaccine encoding granulocyte/macrophage-colony 
stimulating factor ( GM-CSF; GVAX) correlated with induction of mesothelin -
specific cellular immunity .
23,24  In a Phase 1 study, a vaccine with two allogeneic, 
GM-CSF-secreting pancreatic cell lines induced a dose-dependent delayed type 
hypersensitivity ( DTH ) response and CD8+ T cell response to multiple human 
leukocyte antigen ( HLA )-A2, - A3, and –A24 restricted mesothelin epitopes 
exclusively in 3 of 14 patients.  Patients with DTH and CD8+ T cell responses had increased disease -free survival, remaining disease- free at least 25 months 
after diagnosis.  Additionally, Dr. Hassan in collabora tion with Dr. Jeff Schlom at 
the National Cancer Institute ( NCI) elucidated the immunogenic ep itopes of 
mesothelin and showed that mesothelin- specific T cells cause lysis of 
mesothelioma tumor cells .
25  The mesothelin -targeting therapeutic cancer vaccine 
furthest along in clinical development is CRS -207, a live -attenuated strain of the 
bacterium Listeria monocytogenes  (Lm) encoding human mesothelin (hM eso).26,27 
1.1.3  Listeria monocytogenes  (Lm)-Based Vaccine Therapy  
Lm is an attractive platform for presentation of tumor -associated antigens and 
activation of immune response directed against cancer cells.  Lm provides both a 
potent stimulation of innate immunity and also stimulates an adaptive immune response through recruitment and activation of CD4+ and CD8+ T -cell immunity 
specific for encoded heterologous antigens .
28-31  Aduro Biotech , Inc. (Aduro) 
developed a live -attenuated Lm platform strain ( Lm ∆actA/∆inlB), known as 
ANZ -100 (previously CRS -100), which has deletions of two genes, actA and inlB, 
that encode the virulence -determinant proteins ActA  and Internalin B, 
respectively27.  These two proteins facilitate cell- to-cell spread and invasion of 
nonphagocytic cells, and deletion of actA and inlB in ANZ -100 results in 
1,000- fold attenuation of these processes in mice as compared with wild- type 
Lm.32, 29  Uptake of ANZ -100 by macrophages and other phagocytic cells in the 
liver and spleen is still retained and results in a local inflammatory response as 
well as activation and recruitment of natural killer cells and T cells to the liver.  
ANZ -100 underwent clinical evaluation in a Phase 1 dose -escalation study in

Protocol ADU -CL-02-v8 CRS -207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin  
 
 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 3 adults with carcinoma and liver metastases and was found to be safe and well 
tolerated in 9 subjects given intravenous doses up to 3 × 108 colony- forming units 
(CFU).   Additionally, no shedding of ANZ-100 in urine , stools , or sputum  was 
observed at any dose. 
ANZ -100 has additionally been engineered to express mesothelin and the 
resulting strain has been termed CRS -207.  After uptake of CRS -207 by dendritic 
cells and macrophages, mesothelin is express ed and released into the cytosolic 
compartment and subsequently processed through the endogenous MHC Class I 
presentation pathway, resulting in activation of mesothelin- specific T cell -
mediated immunity.  Other mechanisms to activate mesothelin -specific, cell -
mediated immunity may include uptake and cross -presentation of antigens by 
dendritic cells and other cells after infection by CRS -207 and apoptosis.   
Nonclinical studies have shown that CRS -207 elicits mesothelin -specific cellular 
immunity in mice and  nonhuman primates and demonstrates therapeutic efficacy 
in tumor -bearing mice (refer to the Investigator’s Brochure [IB] for details).  
Findings in a Good Laboratory Practice repeated- dose study in cynomolgus 
monkeys showed that treatment with up to 3 × 1010 CFU of CRS -207 resulted in 
no changes related to body weight, food consumption or body temperature and in no findings related to ocular or functional cardiovascular evaluations.  CRS -207 
was detected in the blood at 24 hours after administration, but w as undetectable at 
72 hours.  There were transient and dose -dependent decreases in red blood cell, 
platelet and white blood cell  (WBC)  counts.  Hepatic and renal function changes 
were transient and generally less than two -fold from that at baseline status.   A 
Phase 1 study (VAC07001; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) has been completed with CRS -207 to 
determine the maximum tolerated dose and to explore the safety profile in subjects with advanced mesothelioma, non–small- cell lung cancer, ovarian cancer 
or pancreatic adenocarcin oma who had failed standard therapy .
26  CRS -207 was 
found to be well tolerated at doses up to 1 × 109 CFU.  Adverse events (AEs) such 
as fevers, chills,  and nausea reported as the most common, immediate, transient, 
mild, and temporally related to CRS -207 administration were self -correcting and 
were resolved by the time of the subjects’ discharge.  Lymphopenia was observed in all doses (1 × 10
8, 3 × 108, 1 × 109 and 1 × 1010 CFU), and transaminase 
elevations were observed at doses of 3 × 108, 1 × 109 and 1 × 1010 CFU.  Both 
were dose -dependent, although transient and not considered clinically significant.  
Two CRS -207- related serious adverse events ( SAEs ) were reported.  One SAE of 
moderate constipation occurred in one subject after the second dose of CRS -207 
at 1 × 108 CFU.  The second SAE, a significant decrease in blood pressure (BP)

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 4 after infusion, occurred in another subject after one dose of CRS -207 at  1 × 1010 
CFU.  This subject required aggressive fluid management and recovered to 
baseline status within 24  hours.  This dose level was subsequently discontinued 
and confirmed the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) as 1 × 109 CFU .  No shedding 
of CRS -207 in urine or stools was observed at any dose.   
While the VAC07001 study enrolled subjects with multiple disease types and was not powered to assess survival, 6 of 17 subjects  survived for ≥ 15 months.  Of 
these 6 “long- term” survivors, 3 had pancreatic cancer, 2 had non- small -cell lung 
cancer, and 1 had mesothelioma.  All 6 subjects had prior immunotherapy or 
subsequent local radiation.  Five of 6 subjects received all 4 doses of CRS -207 
and all 5 evaluable subjects demonstrated vaccine -induced Lm-specific respon ses.  
In addition, 4 of the 5 evaluable subjects among the long- term survivors had 
stable disease by RECIST at day 91 (end of study).    
As 3 of the 6 “long -term” survivors were pancreatic cancer patients had 
previously received GVAX pancreas vaccine in separate clinical studies, CRS -
207 in combination with GVAX pancreas vaccine  (with low -dose 
cyclophosphamide [ Cy]) is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 study in 
metastatic pancreatic cancer patients who have received or refused chemotherapy 
(Protocol ADU -CL-01; [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).  Enrollment has been completed in this 
study and a recent interim analysis showed a signi ficant improvement in median 
overall survival in subjects who received  GVAX pancreas vaccine and CRS -207 
compared to subjects  who received GVAX  pancreas vaccine alone ( 6.0 months 
vs. 3.4 months; one-sided p=0.0.0057).  The se interim data were reviewed by a n 
independent data monitoring committee who recommended that the study be stopped for efficacy and subjects on the GVAX pancreas vaccine arm offered 
rollover treatment with GVAX pancreas vaccine and CRS -207.  FDA concurred 
with this decision.  Subjects in the study continue to receive treatment and all 
subjects are being followed for survival, safety and clinical and immune responses.  Safety findings have been consistent with prior clinical experience .  
The most frequent Grade 3/4 related toxicities were f ever, lymphopenia, 
hypophosphatemia, elevated liver enzymes and fatigue following CRS -207 in 
<5% of subjects.  To date , there have been no treatment -related SAEs, significant 
laboratory abnormalities or safety signals.   
Another Phase 2 study  for pancreatic cancer , ADU- CL-04, was initiated in 2014.

2015, over 200 subjects have been enrolled and there have been three SAEs 
reported as unexpected and related to CRS -207: Grade 3 confusion, Grade 3 
hypoxia and Grade 3 hypertension.  A second Phase 2 study in previously -treated 
metastatic pancreatic cancer  was initiated in January 2015 which is evaluating 
GVAX pancreas vaccine (with low -dose Cy) and CRS -207 with and without anti -
PD-1 antibody (nivolumab) in 88 subjects.  Six patients have been treated with no 
significant toxicities or SAEs reported.  
1.2 RATIONALE  FOR COMBINATION OF CRS -207 AND 
CHEMOTHERAPY  
The combination of vaccines with chemotherapy has traditionally not been used 
due to the possibility of post -chemotherapy leukopenia eliminating antitumor 
directed lymphocy tes.  Emerging data, however, suggest that vaccines and 
chemotherapies may be synergistic by augmenting anti -tumor effectiveness of 
subsequent chemotherapies .33,34  Proposed mechanisms of synergy for activating 
relatively dormant T cells include chemotherapy -induced alterations in tumor 
microenvironment, up- regulation of MHC class I and numerous tumor -associated 
antigens on the surface of tumor cells, reduction of suppressor cell populations 
and tumor lysis followed by cross priming .35-37  
Synergistic activity of combinations of immunotherapy and chemotherapy is also supported by clinical studies.  High chemotherapy response rates were observed in patients with small- cell lung cancer who developed an immunologic response 
to an Ad.p53- dendritic cell vaccine.
38  Advanced -stage cancer patients who 
developed immunity to cytochrome P4501B1 following administration of a plasmid/microparticle vaccine showed marked response to a subsequent chemotherapy regimen .
39  Patients with metastatic androgen independent prostate 
cancer who received recombinant viral vectors containing the PSA and B7.1  
genes followed by docetaxel had a longer time to progression than patients who received docetaxel alone
40.  Glioblastoma patients vaccinated with autologous 
tumor- pulsed dendritic cell vaccine who received subsequent chemotherapy 
exhibited significantly longer t imes to tumor recurrence after chemotherapy 
relative to their own previous recurrence times, as well as significantly longer post- chemotherapy recurrence times and survival relative to patients receiving 
isolated vaccination or chemotherapy .
41,42  In mesothelioma patients, three 
vaccinations at two week intervals with autologous tumor lysate -pulsed dendritic

CD8+ T lymphocyte activity in four of the six patients.43   
CRS -207 has been shown to be safe and well -tolerated at the proposed route of 
administration and dose for this study .26  Five subjects with mesothelioma were 
enrolled in the Phase 1 study and tolerated the treatment at doses up to 1 × 109 
CFU.  One subject with mesothelioma survived for 27 months post -first dose of 
CRS -207 in the Phase 1 study.  The proposed dose level for this study (1 × 109 
CFU) is the MTD as determined in the Phase 1 study and is the dose being administered in the current Phase 2 pancreatic cancer study.  This dose level has shown an acceptable safety profile in the 12 p atients treated thus far (in both 
Phase 1 and Phase 2).  In addition, 3 of 4 evaluable patients at this dose level in 
the Phase 1 study demonstrated CRS -207- induced mesothelin- specific CD8+ T 
cell responses (as compared to 1/3 and 2/3 patients at lower dos e levels) and 2 of 
6 of the “long- term” survivors received CRS -207 at this dose level. 
This study will be the first to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of 
CRS -207 with or without Cy when combined with standard of care chemotherapy 
in patients with  malignant mesothelioma.  
Safety data from the first 23 subjects treated on this study have shown no additive 
or synergistic toxicities when administering CRS -207 prior to or after pemetrexed 
and cisplatin.  The most frequent AEs have been  mild to moderate  infusion 
reactions ( e.g. nausea, chills, headache, and vomiting ) as well as fatigue, anemia, 
decreased appetite, night sweats and lymphocyte count decreases related to CRS -
207 and expected AEs related to chemotherapy dosing.  No treatment -related 
unexpected Grade 3 or greater AEs, SAEs or deaths have occurred.  Additionally, 
in the first 25 subjects evaluated for objective clinical responses post -study 
treatme nt, 15 had best overall response of partial response (PR) , 7 had stable 
disease (SD), and 3 had progressive disease (PD).  No subjects have discontinued 
treatment due to AEs related to CRS -207.   
The initial safety and clinical response data warrant ed further evaluation in an 
expansion phase of this Phase 1B study  and the original sample size was 
increased from 16 to 40 .  The sample size has been further increased to 60 in 
order to evaluate the use of low -dose Cy in this patient population and treatment 
regimen.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 7 1.3 RATIONALE  FOR USE  OF LOW -DOS E CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE AND 
CRS -207 
Cyclophosphamide (Cy) is currently approved as a high -dose chemotherapy 
agent, however, when administered at low -doses, it has exhibited immune -
modulatory effects, namely in the suppression of regulatory T cells (Tregs).44  In 
the context of cancer vaccines, the preferential inhibition of Tregs may enhance 
vaccine -induced tumor-specific immunity, thereby improving vaccine efficacy.    
Data s uggest that immune -modulating doses of Cy may enhance vaccine -induced 
antitumor immune responses by inhibiting CD4+ CD25+ regulatory T  cell activity.   
Several studies have demonstrated this concept and shown prolonged survival of 
patients receiving low -doses of Cy 24-72 hours prior to vaccination with minimal 
side effects .1,2,45,46  
Increased vaccine-induced T cell responses and  improved survival has been 
demonstrated in nonclinical studies of CRS -207 administered  with immune -
modulatory doses of Cy.  In mice administered 50 mg/kg Cy (equivalent to 140 
mg/m2 human dose), immune responses measured seven days after administration 
of CRS -207 demonstrated that the combination of Cy and CRS -207 increased 
mesothelin -specific T cell responses compared to saline and CRS -207 alone.  In a 
lung tumor model, tumor -bearing mice received  50 or 100 mg/kg Cy 
(corresponding to 140 to 280 mg/m2 of the human dose equivalent, respectively) 
followed one day later with 2× 106 CFU CRS -207 or ANZ -100 ( the empty LADD 
platform strain , also named Lm11) and were monitored for survival over 90 days.  
The combination of low -dose Cy and CRS -207 increased the rate of survival to 
100% compared to CRS -207 alone (60% survival) or Cy alone (0%, mOS = 33.5 
days)  (Figure 1 ).  The combination of Cy and LADD- based vaccines has been 
shown to improve anti -tumor efficacy compared to LADD -vaccine alone in 
several models.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 10 3.0 STUDY DESIGN 
3.1 BASIC DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS  
This is a phase 1B  study to evaluate the safety and induction of immune response 
of CRS -207 with or without low-dose Cy in combination with pemetrexed and 
cisplatin in front- line therapy in subjects  with MPM.  
Up to 16 subjects were originally planned to be enrolled in this study.  Up to an 
additional 44 subjects will be enrolled in an expansion phase of this study (for a 
total of up to 60 subjects) to obtain additional safety, immune and efficacy data.  
Subjects will be enrolled into 2 mutually exclusive cohorts described below.   
Cohort 1: At least 32 subjects will receive 2 prime vaccinations (PV) of CRS -207 
(1 × 109 CFU given i.v. over approximately 1  hour) 2 weeks apart followed 2 
weeks later by up to 6 cycles of pemetrexed and cisplatin 3 weeks apart.  Three 
weeks after completion of chemotherapy, subjects will receive an additional 2 
infusions (boost vaccinations; BV) of CRS -207 3 weeks apart (Figure 1 ). Subjects 
enrolled in Cohort 1 include the 16 subjects originally planned plus a minimum of the first 16 subjects enrolled into the expansion phase. 
Cohort 2: The remaining subjects enrolled in the expansion phase (up to 28 total) 
will receive  CRS -207 in combination with chemotherapy at the dose and schedule 
described above, however, these subjects will also receive low -dose Cy (200 
mg/m
2) over 30 minutes one day prior to each CRS-207 infusion (i.e. prior to each 
PV and BV infusion).   
All subjects will return to the clinic 4 weeks after their 2nd boost vaccination for 
an End of Course  (EOC ) visit.  Subjects will have follow -up visits 4 weeks after 
the EOC  visit and every 8 weeks thereafter until treatment discontinuation .  
Subjects will continue to receive maintenance vaccinations (MV) with (Cohort 2) 
or without Cy (Cohort 1) following their original schedule at each  follow- up visit 
if they are clinically stable  and continue to meet dosing eligibility .  Subjects may 
continue on treatment with radiographic disease progression if subject is clinically 
stable and investigator believes the treatment may be  providing benefit. 
The study will consist of  a screening p eriod (within 28 days of the first 
administration of study drug), followed by administration of test treatments per

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 11 resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed every 6 -8 weeks until subject comes 
off study.  Tumor biopsies, which are optional, will be performed pre -treatment, 
before start of chemotherapy (i.e. after initial 2 infusions of CRS -207) , after 
completion of chemotherapy, and after  CRS -207 to evaluate tumor lymphocytic 
(e.g. CD4, CD8 , T reg) infiltrate.   A seven -day course of antibiotics  will be 
administered to eliminate any residual CRS -207 beginning 7 days following the 
second infusion of CRS -207 during the induction phase, and after the final study 
dose of CRS-207.

*Or investigator believes subject is no longer receiving benefit if treatment continued beyond radio graphic progression  
 
To monitor initial safety of the sequential vaccine regimen, no more than  1 
subject per week will be enrolled for the first 6 subjects.   Dose -limiting toxicities 
are defined in Section 3.6.  If >33% of subjects (i.e. 1 out of 3 subjects) 
experience a dose- limiting toxicity  during the study , the dose will be lowered to 3 
× 108 CFU for all subsequent dosing with CRS -207.  Blood will be collected at 
EOS to assess the clearance of CRS -207.  
Safety will be assessed by  collection of data on AEs, vital signs, physical 
examination, clinical hematology, serum chemistry , and deaths .  Induction of CRS-207

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 19 • Any other Grade 3  or greater event according to National Cancer Institute’s 
Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE) Version 4.03 
All unexpected Grade 3 events will be reviewed by the lead investigator, sponsor 
and medical monitor.  If the event is determined to be related to CRS -207 dosing 
and clinically meaningful, it will be considered a dose- limiting toxicity.  Grade 3 
laboratory abnormalities should be repeated within 24- 72 hours  if clinically 
indicated and monitored as necessary to determine if event meets DLT criteria. 
DLTs  will be continuously monitored per cohort and across cohorts .  If more than 
33% of subjects  (i.e. 1 in 3 subjects) experience a DLT  at the starting dose of 1 × 
109 CFU, the dose will be lowered to 3 × 108 CFU for all subsequent dosing with 
CRS -207.  Subjects currently receiving treatment  may continue to receive CRS -
207 dosing at the lower dose  and all  subsequent subjects will receive CRS -207 at 
the lower dose.  DLTs  will continue to be monitored  at the lower dose.

4.1 IDENTIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF CLINICAL TRIAL 
MATERIAL  (CTM)  
4.1.1 CTM  
CRS -207 is a formulated live -attenuated strain hMeso38 of Lm, derived by 
deletion of actA and inlB coding sequences from a Streptomycin- resistant , 
wild-type strain and insertion of the hMeso coding sequence.  The CRS -207 drug 
product consists of attenuated Lm (1 × 109 CFU  total ) suspended in 1.0 mL of 
Dulbecco’s phosphate buffered saline and 9%  vol/vol glycerol, filled into a 
single -use 3 -mL glass vial with a gray butyl stopper and aluminum crimp seal 
with a flip -off cap, and stored frozen at –60ºC or colder until intravenous 
administration.  CRS -207 is supplied by Aduro. 
ALIMTA®, pemetrexed for injection, is an antifolate antineoplastic agent that 
exerts its action by disrupting folate -dependent metabolic processes essential for 
cell replication.  Pemetrexed disodium heptahydrate has the chemical name L -
Glutamic acid, N-[4-[2-(2-amino -4,7-dihydro-4- oxo-1H-pyrrolo[2,3- d]pyrimidin -
5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl] -, disodium salt, heptahydrate.  It is a white to almost- white 
solid with a molecular formula of C 20H19N5Na2O6•7H 2O and a molecular weight 
of 597.49.  Pemetrexed is supplied as a sterile  lyophilized powder for i.v. infusion 
available in single -dose vials.  The product is a white to either light yellow or 
green -yellow lyophilized solid.  Each 500- mg vial contains pemetrexed disodium 
equivalent to 500 mg pemetrexed and 500 mg of mannitol.  Pemetrexed will be 
supplied by the institutional pharmacy. 
Cisplatin, USP ( cis-diamminedichloroplatinum) is a heavy metal complex 
containing a central atom of platinum surrounded by two chloride atoms and two 
ammonia molecules in the cis position.  It is a  white powder with the molecular 
formula PtCl 2H6N2, and a molecular weight of 300.1.  Cisplatin injection is a 
sterile aqueous solution for intravenous use, each mL containing 1 mg cisplatin 
and 9 mg sodium chloride.  Cisplatin will be supplied by the institutional 
pharmacy.  
Cyclophosphamide ( Cy; active ingredient cyclophosphamide monohydrate) is a 
synthetic antineoplastic drug chemically related to the nitrogen mustards.  It is 
commercially available in a sterile powder formulation for use in i.v.

pharmacy.  
4.1.2 Labeling  
Because the study is not blinded, the labeling will be that used on commercial 
vials of  Cy, ALIMTA®, pemetrexed for injection, and cisplatin .  The vials for  
CRS -207 will be labeled with the following: product name; volume; storage 
conditions; product lot number; sponsor name and address; fill date; and a caution 
statement (“Caution: New drug limited by Federal law to investigational use”).  
CRS -207 drug product is packaged in kit boxes that are also labeled with product 
name, number of vials, concentration, storage condition, a caution statement, 
sponsor name and address, expiration date, and kit lot number. 
4.2 DOSING INSTRUCTIONS AND SCHEDULE  
4.2.1  Cyclophosphamide  
Cohort 2 only: Cy will be administered to subjects by i.v. infusion at the 
immunomodulating dose of 200 mg/m2 in 100 m L normal saline over 30 minut es 
one day prior to each CRS -207 dose. 
For complete product information on dosage and administration, contraindications, warnings/precautions, adverse reactions, and drug 
interactions, see package insert  for cyclophosphamide ( Appendix E). 
4.2.2 C RS-207  
CRS -207 will be administered by IV infusion (1 × 10
9 CFU in 100 mL sterile 
saline, USP, over approximately 1 hour ). CRS -207 is prepared by thawing one 
vial of drug product at room temperature. A total of 1 mL of product is drawn 
with a syringe and inserted  into 1 bag of 100 mL saline  solution for IV injection.  
Additional details for storage and preparation of CRS -207 are provided in the 
study Pharmacy Manual. 
CRS -207 will be administered to subjects by i.v. infusion on Day 1 of W eeks 1 
and 3 for Cohort 1 or  Day 2 of Weeks 1 and 3 for Cohort 2 prior to chemotherapy 
(prime vaccinations) and 3 and 6 weeks after the final chemotherapy cycle (boost 
vaccinations) .  Subjects who continue to meet dosing eligibility will receive 
 
  
 Aduro Biotech , Inc.  
Protocol ADU -CL-02-v8 CRS -207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin  
 
 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 22 additional CRS -207 maintenance vaccina tions at each  follow- up visit .  CRS -207 
must not be administered via central venous catheters or infusion ports. 
Before each CRS -207 infusion, subjects will be premedicated with 650 mg 
acetaminophen.  Subjects will receive a minimum of 500 mL of normal sal ine 
immediately before CRS -207 infusion and at least 500 mL after infusion  (1 L is 
recommended for patients who can tolerate it, to mitigate infusion reactions) .  
Additional fluids may be given for persistent tachycardia, fever or hypotension 
based on investigator’s discretion.  Subjects will be observed in the clinic for at 
least 4 hours after each infusion.  Subjects who are not stable to be released at 4 hours after infusion should continue to be monitored until stable.  Hospital admissions for overnight  monitoring will not be considered an SAE unless the 
event meets criteria for seriousness other than hospitalization.   
Accumulating subject  experience during and after CRS -207 infusions at 1 × 10
9 
CFU have further demonstrated the following clinical obser vations which are to 
be expected : 
• Fevers . Despite the acetaminophen premedication, subjects  can spike fevers 
up to 40°C starting at the end of the CRS -207 infusion generally through the 
next 24 hours. Oral Ibuprofen (400 to 800  mg) and acetaminophen (650 to 
1000 mg) can be used in alternate sequence every 4 hours.  
• Rigors . Rigors (generally once or twice) have been observed starting during 
or at the end of the CRS -207 infusion through 24 hours. Intravenous 
narcotics such as morphine or meperidine can be administered per 
institutional policy. Oral morphine or non- steroidal anti- inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) may be used as home treatment.  
• Blood pressure. Decreases in blood pressure have been observed 
necessitating additional IV fluids during the 4 hour observation period (up to 1 or 2 L).  This may be the result of fever, compartmental shifts of fluid 
resulting from the CRS -207 infusion, and the use of narcotics. Some 
subjects  have also been slightly hypotensive at 24 hours. Subjects  are 
encouraged to hydrate themselves liberally at home with oral fluids.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 23 • Nausea and vomiting. Nausea and vomiting have been reported and 
observed within 24 hours after CRS -207 infusion.  Subjects may be given 
anti-emetics as needed.  
 
4.2.3 Pemetrexed  
The recommended dose of pemetrex ed is 500 mg/m2 body surface area ( BSA ) in 
100 mL 0.9% sodium chloride administered over 10 minutes as an intravenous 
infusion on Day 1 of a 21- day cycle.  Dose reductions may be required for 
subjects  with hepatic or renal impairment or history of hematolo gic or non-
hematologic toxicity to pemetrexed/cisplatin  (see Appendix C , prescribing 
information for Alimta®).  Subjects may receive pre- medications (e.g. folic acid 
and cyanocobalamin ) and pre - and post -infusion hydration per standard of care 
and investigator’s practice .   
For complete product information on dosage and administration, 
contraindications, warnings/precautions, adverse reactions, and drug 
interactions, see package insert  for ALIMTA®, pemetrexed for injection  
(Appendix C ). 
4.2.4 Cispla tin 
The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg/m2 BSA in 1L 0.9% sodium chloride 
with mannitol 30g/L infused over 2 hours, beginning approximately 30 minutes 
after the end of pemetrexed administration on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle.   
Subjects may receive anti -emetics , e.g. dexamethasone, prior to cisplatin infusion 
per standard of care and investigator’s practice .   
Dose reductions may be required for subjects  with hepatic or renal impairment or 
history of hematologic or non- hematologic toxicity to pemetre xed/cisplatin  (see 
Appendix D , prescribing information for cisplatin).  If a subject is determined to 
be intolerant to cisplatin after at least one dose, carboplatin may be substituted to be administered with pemetrexed per standard of care with the approval of the 
Sponsor.

contraindications, warnings/precautions, adverse reactions, and drug interactions, see the package insert  for cisplatin  (Appendix D ). 
4.2.5 Delayed Dosing  
Dosing of CR S-207 with or without Cy (prime vaccination 2 [PV2], boost 
vaccination 1 [BV1], boost vaccination 2 [BV2] or maintenance vaccinations [MVs]) may be delayed up to 2 weeks.  The medical monitor should be contacted 
for further instruction on continued dosing for any delay greater than 2 weeks.  
The total delay time during the prime vaccination period may not exceed 2 weeks , 
i.e. the first cycle of chemotherapy treatment should be administered no later than Week 7, after which the medical monitor should be contacted to discuss continued 
dosing.  For subjects enrolled in Cohort 2, i f CRS -207 dosing is delayed more 
than 72 hours after administration of Cy for a particular dose, the dose will be 
delayed and Cy re-administered a minimum of 1 week after the original Cy 
dosing and CRS-207 administered  according to schedule thereafter.  
Delayed chemotherapy dosing or missed chemotherapy doses due to the subject’s clinical status are at the discretion of the investigator, but the medical monitor may be contacted to discuss plans for continued dosing.  The Sponsor should be 
notified of all modifications to the planned study schedule during the 
chemotherapy dosing period.  
If administration of CRS -207 doses  (with or without Cy) or chemotherapy cycles 
are delayed, the subsequent dosing schedule  will be adjusted according to the 
delayed dose(s). 
4.3 STORAGE AND HANDLING OF CLINICAL TRIAL MATERIAL  
4.3.1 Cyclophosphamide  
Cyclophosphamide powder should be kept at or below 25ºC.  Cy reconstituted in 
normal saline is chemically and physically stable for 24 hours at room 
temperature and for 6 days when refrigerated.  Guidelines outlining the 
procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be 
followed when handlin g Cy (OSHA 1996).  Protective gloves should be worn 
when handling Cy  in both powder and reconstituted forms.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 25 4.3.2 CRS -207 
CRS -207 must be stored at –60ºC or colder until just before use.  The 
investigational site (s), per institutional guidelines, will des troy used CRS -207 
vials after formulation for administration.  The formulation of CRS -207 for 
administration and the destruction of each used vial will be carefully documented 
in the study Pharmacy Manual.  The principal investigator is responsible for CRS -
207 accountability during on -site monitoring visits.  Unused CRS -207 will be 
destroyed at the study site after final investigational product accountability and notification by Sponsor, unless otherwise directed by Sponsor.   
Wild -type Lm is classified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for 
handling in the laboratory according to Biosafety Level 2 practices.  Since CRS -
207 is attenuated by greater than 1,000- fold compared to wild- type Lm, 
individuals who prepare CRS 207 for injection should t ake appropriate 
precautions to avoid contamination or direct contact with the agent.  Once it is 
prepared for infusion, CRS -207 can be handled with BSL 1 practices, including 
use of protective gloves, eye and face protection when handling and thorough 
hand washing after handling as the chance for direct exposure to CRS -207 by 
study personnel should be greatly diminished.  Study personnel and staff should 
also adhere to the institutional guidelines for standard precautions.  
4.3.3 Environmental Precautions
  
Wild -type Lm is a common pathogen that is widely distributed in the environment 
and contaminates a variety of ready -to-eat foods.  Despite the presence of Lm in 
diverse locations, clinically apparent human infection is not commonly reported 
in immunocompetent, normal individuals.  Direct human- to-human spread of Lm 
is believed to be limited mainly to vertical transmission from mother to neonate.  
Standard isolation precautions are usually recommended for subjects infected 
with wild -type Lm.  CRS -207 is a live -attenuated construct originating from wild -
type Lm which contains deletion of 2 virulence genes that render it greater than 
1,000- times less toxic than wild- type Lm.  Preclinical studies demonstrated that 
virtually all CRS -207 was cleared from the body within 4 days of infusion and 
clinical studies with CRS -207 and similar live -attenuated Lm strains showed no 
shedding of the bacterium in urine or feces post -infusion.  While the risk of 
infection with CRS -207 is unknown and expected to be low or none based on 
these data, p recautions should be exercised to avoid intimate  contact between 
subjects and individuals who are at high risk of listeriosis (e.g. newborn infants,

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 26 pregnant women, HIV -positive individuals)  for at least 7 days after each CRS -207 
infusion. 
4.4 PRODUCT ACCOUNTABILITY  
The investigator is responsible for the control of the investigational agent under 
study.  An investigational agent dispensing log must be kept current and should 
contain the following information: 
• The subject  number and initials of each subject to whom the investigational 
agent is administered  
• The date(s) and quantity of the investigational agent administered  to the 
subject  
• Documentation of proper disposal of used investigational drug vials 
• Documentation of proper disposal (or return, at sponsor’s request) of unused 
investigational drug vials  
All records and unused supplies of the investigational agent must be available for 
inspection at every monitoring visit. 
4.5 PRIOR, CONCOMITANT, AND EXCLUDED THERAPY  
During the course of the clinical study, subjects are anticipated to continue the use 
of prescribed medications identified during the screening procedures, consistent 
with study inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Concomitant medications used in this 
study include: 
• 7-day antibiotic regimen scheduled 7 days after the last dose  of CRS -207 prior 
to chemotherapy (2nd prime vaccination)  and after final dose of CRS -207 
when  treatment  is discontinued 
• Acetaminophen prior to each CRS-207 infusion 
• Folic acid and cyanocobalamin administered with pemetrexed  
• Anti-emetics (per investigator’s standard practice), including dexamethasone, 
administered with cisplatin  
• Medications to treat any treatment- emergent AEs

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 27 Medications to treat treatment- emergent AEs should not interfere with the study 
and can be used at the investigator’s discretion.  Antipyretics may be used to treat 
fever or to prevent recurrence of fever.  The details of any concomitant  
medications must be recorded in the case report form (CRF).  The generic name, dosage, duration, and reason for the concomitant medication should be included in this report.  
The following therapies are not permitted during the study (if administered, the  
subject may be removed from the study): 
• Non-study chemotherapy or immunotherapy (approved or investigational) 
• TNF pathway inhibitors or PI3 kinase inhibitors 
• Systemically active steroids for more than 3 days or use of any systemic 
steroids within 14 days before or after dosing, with exception of study -
prescribed steroids 
• Any other investigational product 
• Filgrastim (Neupogen or G -CSF) or Sargramostin (Leukine or GM -CSF) 
should not be administered 14 days prior to or 14 days after any CRS -207 
dose.  Approva l must be obtained from the medical monitor for a subject to 
continue dosing if administered within this timeframe.  
• Prophylactic vaccines (e.g. pneumococcal vaccine, influenza vaccine) 
should not be administered 28 days prior to or 28 days after any CRS -207 
dose.  Approval must be obtained from the medical monitor for a subject to 
continue dosing if a prophylactic vaccine is administered within this 
timeframe.  
In addition, the following therapies should not be administered during the study 
unless medically necessary and approval must be obtained from the medical 
monitor for a subject to continue dosing if therapy is given concurrently with 
study participation: 
• General anesthesia or deep sedation  
• Aspirin >325 mg/d (chronic daily use of aspirin ≤325 mg/d and heparin 
flushes for central lines are allowed)  
• More than 4 g/d of acetaminophen

a    Study schedule and timing displayed is based on the subject completing the full treatment regimen of 6 chemotherapy cycles.  However, subjects may receive CRS- 207 boost vaccinations if they complete 
between 4 -6 cycles  in which case the visit timing will be modified.  If CRS-207 doses  or chemotherapy cycles are delayed, subsequent dosing schedule will be adjusted according to the delayed dose(s).  
b Follow -up visit to occur 4 weeks after EOC then every 8 weeks until treatment discontinuation.   EOS Visit will occur within 4 weeks after the last dose of study drug or prior to commencing the new 
therapy. If the EOS visit occurs earlier than 4 weeks, a safety follow- up telephone call on Day 28 (+/- 7 days) is required; document contact in the study records.   
c    Virology screen will be performed if one has not been done within 14 days before screening: HIV antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, and hepatitis C antibody  (exception: clear evidence of natural immunity, 
immunity subsequent to vaccination,  or successful eradication of the virus following antiviral therapy); additional virology may also be evaluated.  
d   Coagulation panel  includes the following: prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio of prothrombin time (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT); UA  includes the following: bilirubin, 
blood, glucose, ketones, leukocytes, nitrite, pH, protein, specific gravity.  
e  Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) to include VC , FVC  and FEV 1. 
f   A spiral CT of  the thorax and abdomen will be performed.  If a subject cannot have a CT scan (e.g. allergy to contrast dye) an MRI should be performed.  CT scans may be done within 1 week prior to or after 
scheduled visit.  Optional FDG -PET may be done.   A clinical assessment of tumor status using modified RECIST will be completed. 
g  Complete physical examinations will be conducted at baseline and EOS; symptom -directed physical examinations to be conducted on Day 1 of dosing weeks.  
h   Blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, temperature and pulse oximetry are required as indicated.  Weight will be taken on Day 1 of dosing weeks.  Height required at screening only.   Pre-dose blood pressure

5.2.1 Screening Period (28 days prior to first study dose)  
Before screening assessments are conducted, the subject must be given a complete 
explanation of the purpose and evaluations of the study.  Subsequently, the subject must sign and receive a copy of an informed consent for m (ICF) that was 
approved by the institutional review board (IRB) and an authorization for use and 
disclosure of protected health information (PHI) before any study -specific 
procedure is performed.  An original signed consent form will be retained in the 
subject’s source documentation at the site, and a copy will be provided for the 
subject to take home.  Screening will occur within 28 days before treatment 
administration.  Potential subjects will be evaluated for entry into the study 
according to the stated inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Individuals who are identified during this screening as not eligible for study enrollment need not complete all screening procedures.  The reason for ineligible status will be 
documented. 
The following evaluations will be performed to assess the subject’s eligibility for 
the study: 
• Medical history, including history of carcinoma treatment  
• Medication history over the past 28 days, including prescription and 
over-the- counter medications, herbs, vitamins, minerals, and prophylactic 
vaccines  
• Baseline signs and symptoms

5.2.2.1 CRS -207 Prime Vaccinations (PV1, PV2)  (with or without low -dose Cy) 
All subjects will be administered CRS -207 during Weeks 1  and 3 (Day 1 fo r 
Cohort 1 and Day 2 for Cohort 2) .  Cohort 2 only will receive a low -dose Cy 
administration one day prior to each CRS -207 prime vaccination by i.v. infusion 
at the dose of 200 mg/m2 in 100 mL normal saline over 30 minutes.   
CRS -207 will be administered by i.v. infusion at 1 × 109 CFU in 100 mL 0.9% 
sodium chloride over approximately 1 hour.  Prior to CRS -207 administration, 
subjects will be premedicated with 650 mg of acetaminophen before drug 
administration.  Subjects will receive a minimum of 500 mL of  normal saline 
immediately before CRS -207 infusion and at least 500 mL  after infusion  (1 L is 
recommended for subjects who can tolerate it, to mitigate infusion reactions) .  
Additional fluids may be given for persistent tachycardia, fever or hypotension 
based on investigator’s discretion.  Investigators will not make dose adjustments 
or changes to administration schedule or rate without p rior approval from sponsor.  
CRS -207 must not be administered via central venous catheter or infusion port.   
Vital signs  (BP, pulse, respiratory rate, temperature) will be obtained every 30 
minutes during the CRS -207 infusion and every hour during post infusion follow -
up.  Subjects will be observed for at least 4 hours after each infusion.  Subjects who are not stable enough to be released at 4 hours after infusion should continue 
to be monitored until stable.  Presence of  fever alone does not indicate subject is 
not clinically stable.  
Because results for clinical hematology and serum chemistry need to be obtained before each CRS -207 administration, subjects may have blood drawn for these 
evaluations up to 3 days  prior to receiving CRS -207 in Cohort 1 or 2 days  prior to 
Cy for subjects in Cohort 2.  Blood samples must not be collected from a central 
line after infusion of CRS-207 for at least 4 days.      
Prior to receiving any study drug on Day 1 of  Weeks 1 (PV1 for Cohort 1 or XP1 
for Cohort 2) and 3 (PV2 for Cohort 1 or XP2 for Cohort 2), the following 
evaluations will be  performed:  
• Symptom- directed physical examination  (May be done up to 3 days  prior to 
CRS -207 dosing ( Cohort 1) or 2 days  prior to Cy for subjects receiving Cy 
(Cohort 2)).

day course of antibiotics ( after 2nd prime vaccination  [PV2] only). 
5.2.2.3 Chemotherapy Treatment: Pemetrexed and Cisplatin Administration 
(CY1  to CY6)  
On Day 1 of Weeks 5  (CY1) , 8 (CY2), 11  (CY3), 14 (CY4), 17  (CY5)  and 20  
(CY6),  pemetrexed  and c isplatin treatment will be administered .  Pemetrexed will 
be administered  at 500 mg/m2 BSA in 100  mL 0.9% sodium chloride  
administered over 10 minutes as an intravenous infusion.  Cisplatin will be 
administered  at 75 mg/m2 BSA in 1L 0.9% sodium chloride  with mannitol 30g/L 
infused over 2 hours , beginning approximately 30 minutes after the end of 
pemetrexed administration .  Subjects may receive pre- medications (e.g. folic acid, 
cyanocobalamin , and anti -emetics) and pre- and post -infusion hydration per 
standard of c are and investigator’s practice.  Dose reductions may be required for 
subject s with hepatic or renal impairment or history of toxicity to pemetrexed or 
cisplatin.    
If a subject is determined to be intolerant to cisplatin after at least one dose, 
carboplatin may be substituted to be administered wi th pemetrexed per standard 
of care with the approval of the Sponsor.   
Subjects who complete at least 2 cycles of pemetrexed/cisplatin may go on to 
receive CRS -207 3 weeks after their final cycle of pemetrexed/cisplatin.  Subjects

5.2.2.4 CRS -207 Post -chemotherapy Boost Vaccination (BV1, BV2) 
During the post -chemotherapy boost vaccination (BV) period, all subjects 
(Cohorts 1 and 2) will be administered two infusions of CRS -207 3 weeks apart at 
least 3 weeks after the last chemotherapy cycle.   
Cohort 2 only will receive a low -dose Cy administration one day prior to each 
CRS -207 boost vaccination by i.v. infusion at the dose of 200 mg/m2 in 100 mL  
normal saline over 30 minutes.  Subjects must receive at least 2 cycles of 
pemetrexed and cisplatin to continue to receive CRS -207 (with or without Cy)  
after chemotherapy.   
CRS -207 will be administered and moni tored and the same procedures conducted 
as on Day 1 in Section 5.2.2.1 and Day 2 in Section 5.2.2.2.   One week (7 ± 1 
days) after each CRS -207 infusion, subjects will be contacted by phone to assess 
AEs and concomitant medications. 
In addition to those procedures listed in Section 5.2.2.1, prior to the first study 
drug dosing ( Cy or CRS -207) at  boost vaccination (BV1)  following 
chemotherapy, the following procedures will be conducted: 
• CD4 count.  Blood draw may be done up to 3 days  prior to CRS -207 dosing 
(Cohort 1) or 2 days prior to Cy for subjects receiving Cy  (Cohort 2). 
• Spiral CT scan of thorax and abdomen with optional FDG -PET scan.  If a 
subject cannot have a CT scan [e.g. allergy to contrast dye], an MRI should 
be performed.   CT scan may be done within ±7 days of BV2. 
• Clinical assessment of tumor status using modified RECIST for assessment 
of response in MPM4 and irRC47

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 43 5.2.2.5 Antibiotic Administration  
To eliminate any potentially residual CRS -207, subjects will be administered 
antibiotics after PV2 (and prior to receiving pemetrexed/cisplatin) and at the EOT 
visit and prior to receiving subsequent cancer -related (non -study) therapy.   
Subjects with a central line port will receive 1 dose [2 mg ampicillin or 3 -5 mg/kg 
trimethoprim/ sulfamethoxazole (in penicillin -allergic subjects)] of IV antibiotics 
through the port, followed by 6 days of oral antibiotics [amoxicillin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (in  penicillin -allergic subjects)]; all other subjects 
will receive a 7 -day course of oral amoxicillin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
(in penicillin -allergic subjects).  
Site personnel will contact the subject by telephone to facilitate compliance with 
antibiotic treatment; subjects will be required to record self -administration of 
antibiotics in a diary.  
If infection with CRS -207 is confirmed or suspected after more than 7 days post -
infusion, IV antibiotics (see below) should be initiated as soon as possibl e and 
follow- up cultures obtained periodically to confirm absence/clearance of any 
CRS -207 infection. The Medical Monitor should be consulted regarding 
continuation of study drug treatment and treatment of suspected or confirmed 
infection. 
Consult the package inserts for amoxicillin, trimethoprim, and sulfamethoxazole 
for product information on dosage and administration, contraindications, warnings/precautions, adverse reactions, and drug interactions. 
5.2.2.5.1  Antibiotic Treatment for CRS -207 Infection 
The recommended antibiotic regimen for suspected or confirmed CRS -207 
infection after more than 7 days post -infusion is IV administration of ampicillin 
(or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole in penicillin -allergic subjects) plus 
gentamicin. Initial doses of ampicillin should be approximately 12 g/day (or per drug label) divided (3- 4 grams per dose every 3 to 4 hours), with gentamicin 3 
mg/kg (or per drug label) daily in divided doses every 8 hours (with adjustments 
according to renal function and serum levels of gentamicin). In penicillin -allergic 
subjects, initial IV doses of trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be 15 to 20 
mg/kg/day (or per drug label) (based on trimethoprim component) divided 4 times

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 44 per day, with gentamicin 3 mg/kg daily in divided doses every  8 hours (with 
adjustments according to renal function and serum levels of gentamicin). For 
those individuals who receive IV antibiotics, the course of therapy is anticipated 
to be greater than or equal to 14 days, depending on clinical course. Antibiotic 
treatment may be completed with use of oral antibiotics, if clinically indicated.  
5.2.2.6 End of Course (EOC ) Follow- up  
Subjects will return to the clinic for follow -up approximately 4 weeks after their 
2nd boost vaccination.  The following evaluations will be performed:  
• Spiral CT scan of thorax and abdomen with optional FDG -PET scan.  If a 
subject cannot have a CT scan [e.g. allergy to contrast dye], an MRI should 
be performed.   CT scan may be done within ±7 days of EOC. 
• Clinical assessment of tumor status using modified RECIST for assessment 
of response in MPM4 and irRC47 
• Pulmonary function tests: VC, FVC and FEV 1 for Cohort 2 only 
• Physical examination  
• ECOG performance status  
• Resting 12- lead electrocardiogram  
• Vital signs (BP, pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, pulse oximetry ) and 
weight  
• Blood draws for clinical hematology, serum chemistry  
• Blood draw (serum and plasma) for tumor marker(s)  (See Section 5.3) 
• AEs and concomitant medications review

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 45 5.2.3 Study Follow- up Period /End of Study  (EOS)  
Subjects will return to the clinic for follow -up approximately  4 weeks after their 
EOC visit and every 8 weeks thereafter until disease progression  or investigator 
determines subject is no longer receiving benefit from treatment (if subject 
continues treatment beyond progression).  Subjects who are clinically stable and 
continue to meet dosing eligibility will receive maintenance vaccinations  (with or 
without Cy) at every follow -up visit . Subjects may continue on treatment with 
radiographic disease progression if subject is clinically stable and investigator 
believes the treatment is providing benefit.  All subjects will complete an EOS  
visit no more than four weeks following the final dose of study medication or 
prior to receipt of other cancer -related treatment. If the EOS  visit occurs earlier 
than 4 weeks, a safety follow-up telephone call on Day 28 (+/- 7 days) is required; 
document contact in the study records.   
The following evaluations will be done at each follow -up (FU) visit and at the end 
of study ( EOS ) visit: 
• Symp tom- directed physical examination  
• ECOG performance status  
• Vital signs (BP, pulse, respiratory rate, temperature, pulse oximetry ) and 
weight  (day 1 only) 
• Blood draws for clinical hematology, serum chemistry 
• AEs and concomitant medications review 
• For eligibl e subjects receiving maintenance vaccinations (MVs), CRS -207 
(without Cy [Cohort 1] or with Cy [Cohort 2] ) will be administered at every 
follow- up visit .  CRS -207 and Cy will be administered following  the same 
procedures stated in Section 5.2.2.1. Subjects  will be monitored for at least 2 
hours after each infusion or until they are considered clinically stable .   
Blood draw s for clinical labs may be done up to 3 days  prior to CRS -207 
dosing ( Cohort 1) or 2 days  prior to Cy for subjects receiving Cy (Cohort 2).  
Subjects will be contacted by phone to assess AEs and concomitant 
medications  1 day after CRS -207 infusion.

• To eliminate any potentially residual CRS -207, subjects will initiate a 7 -day 
course of antibiotics at the EOS  visit and prior to receiving any subsequent 
cancer -related therapy (refer to Section 5.2.2.5).   
In accordance with good medical practice, any ongoing AE present at end of the 
study , including a clinically significant laborat ory test abnormality, which is 
determined by the investigator as possibly or probably related to the study investigational agents, will be followed until resolved, until the event stabilizes and the overall clinical outcome has been ascertained, or until the subject is lost to 
follow-up.  
5.3 LABORATORY EVALUATIONS  
5.3.1 Immune Monitoring  Assessments  
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and serum 
Peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMC s) and serum will be collected at 
various time points as listed in Table 2, prior, during  and post treatment to assess  
Lm- and mesothelin- specific immunity.  T cell responses to mesothelin will be  
considered positive when the frequency of specific responses are ≥ 1 in 105 CD8+ 
peripheral blood lymphocytes (PB L) above the control sample and increased by at 
least 2 -fold compared to baseline.  T cell responses to Lm (LLO ) will be  
considered positive when specific T cell frequencies were ≥ 1 in 105 PBMCs and 
increased by at least 2 -fold compared to baseline.

5.3.3 Tumo r Biopsy  
Collection  
Tissue biopsies will be encouraged but done strictly on a voluntary 
basis.   Standard techniques will be used for pre -treatment and post -treatment 
percutaneous biopsies which may include CT, cone beam CT, ultrasound, or fusion guided biopsy.  When clinically feasible and judged minimal risk by 
Interventional Radiology, the same total number biopsies will be prospectively acquired from areas of tumor that may exhibit imaging features of higher or lower cellularity, such as higher PET scan activity, or evidence solid features or viability on CT scan. This will allow biopsy specimens t o be marked as “high imaging 
cellularity” or “low imaging cellularity”, which could enhance the ability to obtain quality tissue biomarkers, immunohistochemistry or mRNA, and could facilitate the identification of reliable biomarkers for response.  
Biopsies will be obtained from primary tumor sites and metastatic sites  (if 
applicable) .  No more than 4 cores may be obtained per site.  Half of the biopsy 
specimen will be used for immunohistochemistry (IHC)  analysis .  The other half 
will be used for gene expres sion analysis. 
Archival tissue from all subjects will be obtained if possible, with exception for 
subjects who agree to the optional tumor biopsy at screening do will not need 
archival tissue obtained .

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 50 6.0 PROCEDURES FOR HANDLING AES AND SAES  
6.1 DEFINITION OF AN ADVERSE EVENT  
The following definition of an AE will be used for this study: 
Any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered an 
investigational product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with this treatment.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an  
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally 
associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to medicinal (investigational) product.  
Examples of AEs include the following: 
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the indication under 
study 
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent preexisting condition, including an 
increase in frequency or intensity of the condition 
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after investigational product 
administration, even if they were present before the start of the study 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction with 
another medical product 
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either 
investigatio nal product or a concurrent medication  
An overdose should not be reported as an AE or SAE; instead the symptoms 
resulting from the overdose should be reported as the AE or SAE. 
Examples of AEs do not include the following: 
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g. endoscopy, appendectomy) (Instead, 
the medical condition that led to the procedure is an AE.) 
• Situations that are unwanted but in which an untoward medical occurrence 
did not occur, for example social inconvenience after admission to a hospital 
 
  
 Aduro Biotech , Inc.  
Protocol ADU -CL-02-v8 CRS -207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin  
 
 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 51 • Anticip ated day -to-day fluctuations of a preexisting disease or condition 
(present or detected before enrollment) that does not worsen overall 
• Expected progression of the disease being studied, including signs or 
symptoms of the disease being studied, unless progression is more severe 
than expected for the subject’s condition 
It is the responsibility of the investigator to perform periodic and special assessments for AEs.  The investigator and clinical staff will note all AEs offered by the subject at baseline, during administration of the CTM, and at the follow -up 
visit.  All clinical complaints volunteered by, or elicited from, the subject during the study will be recorded on the appropriate page of the CRF for the study period indicated.  If any AE occurs, the s ubject will receive appropriate treatment and 
medical supervision.  
All AEs judged to be clinically significant, including clinically significant 
laboratory abnormalities, will be followed until resolution.  All AEs will be summarized in the annual report or more frequently, if requested by the regulatory agency.  SAEs require special reporting in addition to documentation in the CRF 
as described below.  
6.2 DEFINITION OF A SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT  (SAE) 
In this study, the definition of an SAE is an AE that mee ts any of the following 
criteria:  
• Results in death  
• Is life -threatening  
Note: The term life-threatening in the definition of serious  refers to an event 
in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event.  It does not 
refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death if it were more 
severe.  
• Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
Note: In general, hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained 
at the hospital or emergency ward for observation or treatment that would 
not have been appropriate in the physician’s office or out -patient setting.  
Complications that occur during hospitalization are AEs but not necessarily 
 
  
 Aduro Biotech , Inc.  
Protocol ADU -CL-02-v8 CRS -207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin  
 
 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 52 SAEs.  An occurrence or complication that prolongs hospitalization is an 
SAE.  When there is doubt as to whether hospitalization occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered an SAE.  Hospitalizati on for 
elective treatment of a preexisting condition that did not worsen from its original baseline severity is not considered an SAE. 
Hospital admissions for overnight monitoring following CRS -207 infusion 
will not be considered an SAE unless the event me ets criteria for seriousness 
other than hospitalization.   
• A persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
Note: The term disability  means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability 
to conduct normal life functions.  This definition is not intended to include 
AEs of relatively minor medical significance, such as uncomplicated 
headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, influenza, or accidental trauma (e.g. 
sprained ankle), that may interfere or prevent everyday life functions, but do not constitute a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal 
life functions. 
• A congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Other important medical event  
Note: Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding 
whether reporting is appropriate for other i mportant medical events that may 
not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization but still 
may jeopardize the subject or may require medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  These events should also be considered serious.  
An SAE requires additional detailed reports and follow -up.  The content of these 
detailed reports must address the investigator’s estimate of causality.  
6.3 RECORDING AEs  AND SAEs  
All AEs will be reported from the time study treatment is first administered to the 
subject (PV1 for Cohort 1 or XP1 for Cohort 2) through 28 days after receipt of 
final dose of investigational product. 
 
  
 Aduro Biotech , Inc.  
Protocol ADU -CL-02-v8 CRS -207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin  
 
 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 53 All preexisting medical conditions will be recorded on the baseline physical 
examination page of the C RF.  Starting with the first administration of first 
investigational product, any new event or experience that was not present at 
screening, or worsening of an event present at screening, is considered to be an 
AE.  Unchanged, chronic conditions are not AEs and should not be recorded on the AE page of the CRF.  
When an AE or SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review 
all documentation (e.g. hospital progress notes, laboratory and diagnostic reports) 
relative to the event.  The investi gator is to record all relevant information about 
any AE (including SAEs) on the AE page of the CRF.  It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the subject’s medical records in lieu of the 
proper completion of the appropriate AE (or SAE) CRF pages.  However, there 
may be instances where copies of medical records for certain cases are requested.  In such instances, all subject identifiers and PHI will be blinded on the copies of the medical records before submission to the appropriate authorities.  
The investigator will also attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis of signs, symptoms, or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis, not the individual signs and symptoms, should be documented on the appropri ate 
CRF as the AE or SAE.  In addition, SAEs need to be reported on the SAE report 
form provided in the  study procedures manual ( SPM ). The SPM provides 
additional guidelines. 
6.4 ASSESSMENT OF GRADE  
The investigator will make an assessment of grade for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study, which will be recorded in the CRF.  The assessment will be 
based on the National Cancer Institute’s CTC AE, Version 4.03, and graded as 
shown below: 
• Grade 1: Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnos tic 
observations only; intervention not indicated 
• Grade 2: Moderate; minimal, local or noninvasive intervention indicated; 
limiting age -appropriate instrumental activities of daily living  
• Grade 3: Severe or medically significant but not immediately

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 54 • Grade 4: Life-threatening consequences; urgent intervention indicated 
• Grade 5: Death related to AE  
Any AE that changes in grad e during its course will be recorded in the CRF at the 
highest level experience by the subject.  
6.5 ASSESSMENT OF CAUSALITY 
The investigator is obligated to estimate the relationship between the 
investigational products and the occurrence of each AE or SAE  by using his or 
her best clinical judgment.  Other causes, such as the history of the underlying 
disease, concomitant therapy, other risk factors, and the temporal relationship of 
the event to the investigational products will be considered and investigated.  The investigator will also consult the IB or product labeling information for marketed products in the determination of the assessment. 
There may be situations when an SAE has occurred and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report.  However, it is very important that the investigator always assess causality for every event before the transmission of the SAE.  The investigator may change his or her opinion of the 
causality in light of follow -up information, amending the SAE report.  The 
causality assessment ( Table 3 ) is one of the criteria used to determine regulatory 
reporting requirements and should not be left blank.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 55 Table 3. Assessment of Causality/Relatedness of AEs  
Term  Definition  
Definitely related  The AE is clearly related to the investigational agent(s) or research 
intervention: the AE has a temporal relationship to the administration 
of the investigational agent(s) or research intervention, follows a 
known pattern of response, and no alternative cause is present.  
Probabl y related  The AE is likely related to the investigational agent(s) or intervention: 
the AE has a temporal relationship to the administration of the 
investigational agent(s) or research intervention and follows a known 
or suspected pattern of response, but an alternative cause may be 
present .  
Possibly related  The AE may be related to the investigational agent(s) or intervention: 
the AE has a temporal relationship to the administration of the 
investigational agent(s) or research intervention, follows a suspected 
pattern of response, but an a lternative cause is present.  
Unlikely to be related  The AE is doubtfully related to the investigational agent(s) or 
intervention: the AE has a temporal relationship to the administration of the investigational agent(s) or research intervention but follows no known or suspected pattern of response, and an alternative cause is 
present.  
Unrelated (or not 
related)  The AE is clearly NOT related to the investigational agent(s) or 
intervention: the AE has no temporal relationship to the 
administration of the investigational agent(s) or research intervention 
and follows no known or suspected pattern of response, and an 
alternative cause is present.  
AE = adverse event.  
6.6 REPORTING OF SAEs  
Reporting of SAE s will begin at the time study treatment is first administered to 
the subject (PV1  for Cohort 1 or XP1 for Cohort 2) and will continue through 28 
days after receipt of final dose of investigational product.   
SAEs  will be reported to the sponsor by phone, fax, or e -mail within 24 hours of 
the time the investigator becomes aware of the event.   
SAE Reporting Fax Number: 510-295-2666 
The Medical Monitor may also be contacted to discuss a safety event:  
Jackie Walling, MBChB, PhD : mobile: 650-483-9726 
The urgency for reporting SAE(s) is fourfold:  
1. To enable the safety department to fulfill the reporting requirements to the 
appropriate regulatory authority  
 
  
 Aduro Biotech , Inc.  
Protocol ADU -CL-02-v8 CRS -207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin  
 
 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 56 2. To facilitate discussion (and implementation, if necessary) between the 
safety department and the investigator of appropriate follow -up measures in 
the event an expedited report is required 
3. To facilitate Aduro’s rapid dissemination of information about AEs to other 
investigators or sites in a multicenter study by using expediting reporting  
4. To facilitate investigator reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk 
to human subjects to the IRB and institutional biosafety committee  
In the event an SAE is observed, the SAE report will be completed as thoroughly 
as possible including the following: 
• All available details about the event  
• Signature of the in vestigator 
The SAE report will be forwarded to the sponsor or designee within the 
designated time frames.  If the investigator does not have all information about an 
SAE, the investigator will not wait to receive additional information before 
notifying the  sponsor of the event and completing the form.  The form will be 
updated when additional information is received.  
Aduro will report all SAEs that are unexpected and considered possibly or 
probably related to the administration of the investigational agents to the Food and Drug Administration in the form of an expedited safety report within 15 calendar days after receiving information on the SAE.  Aduro will also report 
to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes 
of Healt h Office of Biotechnology Activities (NIH OBA) by fax or phone within 
7 days of receiving the information, any unexpected life -threatening or fatal SAEs 
that are considered at least possibly associated with the investigational agents.  
Aduro, or designee, will also notify all participating investigators of expedited 
safety reports within 15 calendar days after receiving information.  The 
investigators will notify their reviewing IRB and institutional biosafety committee 
(IBC) as required by institutional policies.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 57 6.7 FOLLOW -UP OF AEs AND SAEs  
After the initial AE or SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively 
follow each subject and provide further information to the safety department in 
regards to the subject’s condition. 
All AE(s) and SAE(s) will be followed until: 
• Resolution 
• The condition stabilizes 
• The event is otherwise explained  
• The subject is lost to follow -up 
Once the event is resolved, the appropriate AE or SAE report page will be 
updated.  The investigator will also ensure that the fol low-up includes any 
supplemental information that may explain the causality of the event(s).  
New or updated information will be recorded on the originally completed AE or 
SAE report, with all changes signed and dated by the investigator or designee.  
The u pdated AE or SAE report will then be signed by the investigator and 
resubmitted to the safety department.  
6.8 ADVERSE EVENTS OF SPECIAL INTEREST  
6.8.1 S uspected Infection with CRS -207 or Listeria 
Suspected infection with CRS -207 and/or Listeria are considered adverse events 
of special interest (AESI) and should be reported following SAE reporting 
procedures irrespective of temporal relationship to study drug administration.  In 
the event a subject has a positive Listeria or CRS -207 culture at any time during  
or after study participation, the event should be reported to the Sponsor within 24 
hours of the event. 
All AESIs must be reported for the duration of the study regardless of causality. 
In the case of a suspected persistent CRS -207 or Listeria infection that has not 
been confirmed by culture, collection of blood, urine and stool samples in 
duplicate is recommended. One set of samples should be cultured locally for

Protocol ADU -CL-02-v8 CRS -207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin  
 
 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 58 Listeria per institutional guidelines.  Culture of cerebrospinal fluid should be 
obtained for subjects with suspected central nervous system infection. In such 
instances, analysis of cerebrospinal fluid should also include cell count, protein, 
glucose, and Gram stain. If samples are positive for Listeria, the Sponsor must be 
notified immediately, and the duplicate samples and Listeria isolate must be sent to Sponsor or designee for testing to confirm CRS -207. Instructions on collection, 
storage and shipping of samples for CRS -207 testing are provided in the Central 
Laboratory Manual.  
If Listeria ha s been confirmed at the clinical site or an external laboratory, all 
efforts should be made to obtain a sample of the bacterial isolate from the original 
positive culture and submit to the Sponsor for strain confirmation; records on all 
samples cultured during this period must be obtained and provided to the Sponsor.  
Refer to the Central Laboratory Manual for sample collection and shipping instructions. 
If infection with CRS -207 is confirmed or suspected, IV antibiotics ( Section 
5.2.2.5) should be initiated as soon as possible and follow -up cultures obtained 
periodically to confirm absence/clearance of any CRS -207 infection.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 59 7.0 STUDY OR STUDY SITE TERMINATION AND SUBJECT 
DISCONTINUATION 
7.1 PREMATURE STUDY OR STUDY SITE TERMINATION 
If Aduro, the investigator, the medical monitor, the study monitor, or appropriate 
regulatory officials discover conditions arising during the study that indicate that the study should be halted or that the study center should be terminated, this 
action may be taken after appro priate consultation among Aduro, the investigator, 
the medical monitor, and the study monitor.  Conditions that may warrant 
termination of the study include, but are not limited to the following: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, serious, or unacceptable risk to the subjects 
enrolled in the study 
• A decision on the part of Aduro to suspend or discontinue testing, 
evaluation, or development of the product for any reason          
A study conducted at a single study site in a multicenter study may also warrant  
termination under the following conditions: 
• Failure of the investigator to enroll subjects into the study at an acceptable 
rate 
• Failure of the investigator to comply with pertinent regulations of 
appropriate regulatory authorities  
• Submission of knowingly false information from the research facility to 
Aduro, the study monitor, or appropriate regulatory authority 
• Insufficient adherence to protocol requirements  
Study termination and follow -up will be performed in compliance with the 
conditions set forth in the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E6, 
Guideline for Good Clinical Practice, Sections 4.12, 4.13, 5.20, and 5.21. 
7.2 SUBJECT DISCONTINUATION 
Subjects will be encouraged to complete the study; however, they may voluntarily 
withdraw at any time.  The investigator will provide a written explanation 
describing the reason for discontinuation in a source document, which will be

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 60 transcribed to the appropriate CRF page.  Subjects who wish to withdraw from the 
study will be encouraged to complete the planned administration of antibiotics , 
complete EOS assessments, post -treatment monitoring for CRS -207, and to 
complete assessments scheduled during the follow-up visit .  
Subjects who withdraw consent or discontinue treatment before completing at 
least 2 cycles of chemotherapy will be considered dropouts and may be replaced 
at the discretion of the lead investigator , sponsor and medical monitor.  A subject 
may be removed from treatment  for the reasons listed in Sections  7.2.1 through 
7.2.4.   
7.2.1 Adverse Event  
If a subject suffers an AE that, in the judgment of the investigator, Aduro, or the medical monitor, presents an unacceptable consequence or risk to the subject, the subject may be discontinued from further participation in the study. 
7.2.2 Intercurrent Illness  
A subject may be discontinued from the study if, in the judgment of the investigator, the subject develops an intercurrent illness or complication (including progressive disease) that, in any way, justifies withdrawal from the study.  
7.2.3 Noncompliance  
After consultation between the investigator, the medical monitor, or study monitor, and Aduro when appropriate, a subject may be discontinued from the 
study for the following administrative reasons: 
• Failure to receive study medication or trea tment as mandated by the protocol  
• Failure to comply with protocol requirements 
• Unauthorized, subject- initiated changes in dosing regimen

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 62 8.0 DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING AND STATISTICAL 
ANALYSIS  
8.1 DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING  
CRFs will be used to capture study results and data.  The study coordinator or other authorized study personnel will transcribe data from source documents onto paper or electronic CRFs.  All CRFs will be reviewed and source verified by the 
study monitor during periodic site visits, and the study monitor will ensure that all 
data in the CRF are correct and complete.  Before or b etween visits, the medical 
monitor or study monitor may request copies of the CRFs for preliminary medical review.  Once the CRFs are complete and source- verified, the investigator must 
sign and date all required pages, verifying the accuracy of all data contained within the CRF.  Training will be provided on proper completion of CRFs. 
If electronic CRFs are used, training will be provided for the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system.  All personnel using the EDC system must have 
appropriate education, training, and experience.  The investigator will be provided with standard operating procedures (SOPs) (contained in the SPM or a vendor- specific SOP) on the use of the EDC system.  The investigator will be 
responsible for documenting employee education, training, and previous experience that pertains to the EDC system.  
The investigator must maintain adequate security of the EDC system, including documentation that all users have been trained on the appropriate SOPs and a list 
of authorized users.  To ensure attributability, all personnel responsible for data 
entry must obtain a unique electronic signature before any data can be entered in the CRFs.  The system must be configured to ensure that the signer cannot readily repudiate the signed record as not genuine.  Authorized study personnel will be 
assigned a unique password and associated electronic signature after receiving 
SOP training.  
If EDC systems other than those provided and maintained by the sponsor are used 
for documentation and data capture, the inv estigator must ensure that the systems 
are validated and ensure data backup as described in Section 9.2.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 63 8.2 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS  
8.2.1 General Overview  
The data will be summarized in tables listing the mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, maximum an d number of subjects in a group for continuous 
data; in tables listing count and percentage for categorical data; and median and standard error for time -to-event data.  Data will be listed for each subject.  All 
statistical analyses will be performed and data appendices will be created by using SAS.  The effects of noncompliance, dropouts, and covariates will be assessed to determine the impact on the general applicability of results from this study.  
Unless specified otherwise, summaries will be reported by treatment regimen  
(Cohort) and overall.  This corresponds to Cohort  1 (CRS -207 without Cy), 
Cohort 2 (CRS -207 with Cy), and overall.  For select summaries of disposition, 
baseline data, and key efficacy endpoints, summaries of Cohort 1 will be further 
broken out by subjects enrolled in the original and expansion phase .  No formal 
comparisons across enrollment phase (original vs. expansion) or treatment 
regimen (Cohort 1 vs. Cohort 2) will be performed.   
Further details of the analysis, including the handling of missing data transformations, assessing impact of the expansion cohort , impact of changes to 
the planned chemotherapy regimen  and further modifications to populations of 
analysis will be provided i n a separate statistical analysis plan.  
8.2.2 Populations of Interest 
The full analysis (FAS) population is all subjects enrolled who receive at least one dose of study treatment . 
The per protocol population is defined as subjects who receive two doses of CRS -
207 (with or without Cy) followed by at least 4 cycles of pemetrexed and 
cisplatin . 
Subjects with major protocol violations will be excluded from the per protocol population.  The precise reasons for excluding subjects from the per protocol set will be  fully defined and documented before database lock. 
8.2.3 Baseline Comparability  
Demographics and baseline clinical variables for subjects will be summarized using descriptive statistics .  Relationship to efficacy and safety endpoints may be 
 
  
 Aduro Biotech , Inc.  
Protocol ADU -CL-02-v8 CRS -207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin  
 
 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 64 assessed via scatter plots for pairs of continuous endpoints and summary statistics 
within categories for categorical / continuous pairs, and contingency tables (N, percent) for pairs of categorical endpoints.  Differences  in baseline variables 
across enrollment phase ( original vs. expansion)  will be evaluated descriptively 
and may be used as covariates in sensitivity analyses of efficacy endpoints . 
8.2.4 Efficacy Analysis 
Efficacy analysis will be conducted on full analysis and per protocol populations.  
Standard adjustments to analyses for pre -specified or baseline -suggested clinical 
covariates will be performed; these covariate -adjusted analyses will be considered 
secondary analyses.  The primary endpoint  is the change in IFN -γ production of 
mesothelin- specific T cells  by ELISPOT assay from baseline to (1) immediately 
after CRS -207 (with or without Cy), (2) after receiving chemotherapy, and (3) 
after receiving two subsequent doses of CRS -207 (with or without Cy) following 
chemotherapy.  Change from baseline will be compared via paired t -test of log -
transformed post/pre ELISPOT values and assessed for statistical significance via 
Hochberg multiplicity alpha adjustment.   T cell responses to mesothelin will be 
considered positive when the f requency of specific responses  are ≥ 1 in 10
5 CD8+ 
peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) above the control sample and increased by at 
least 2 -fold compared to baseline.  T cell responses to Lm (LLO) will be 
considered positive when specific T cell frequencies were ≥ 1 in 105 PBMCs and 
increased by at least 2 -fold compared to baseline.   In addition, if change from  
baseline in the logarithmic scale  is not normally distributed (that is, if p<0.05 by a 
Shapiro-Wilks test) then a Wilcoxon signed rank test will be performed instead. 
Analyses of other efficacy endpoints including changes in PFTs, objective tumor 
response, progression free survival, time to progression and overall survival will 
be conducted on the full analysis and per protocol populations.  Time to event 
data will be analyzed using Kaplan -Meier methods and will be calculated from 
date of first dose of study treatment.  Further details on the analyses  including 
censoring strategies  will be described in a statistical analysis plan.  
Exploratory analyses will be conducted to evaluate t he relationship between PFT 
improvement and tumor response, as well as to evaluate the relationship between 
overall survival and tumor response.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 65 8.2.5 Safety Analysis 
AE data will be listed individually and incidence of AEs summarized by system 
organ class and preferred terms within a system organ class for each treatment 
group.  When calculating the incidence of AEs, each AE (based on preferred 
terminology defined by M edical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities, 
Version  13.1, or the most current version) will be counted only once for a given 
subject.  In analyses of grade and causality, if the same AE occurs on multiple 
occasions, the highest grade and strongest relatio nship to study drug will be 
assumed.  If two or more AEs are reported as a unit, the individual terms will be 
reported as separate experiences.   
Changes in vital signs, hematology, and clinical chemistry parameters from baseline to the end of the study wi ll be examined.  Treatment -emergent changes 
from normal to abnormal values in key laboratory parameters will be identified. 
8.2.6 Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
No formal pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic analyses are planned for the investigational agents used in this study.   
8.2.7 Interim Analysis  
Safety data will be reviewed on an ongoing basis by Aduro, the investigator (s), 
and medical monitor.  
No formal interim analysis for this phase 1B study is planned. 
8.2.8 Sample Size  
Up to 60 subjects in total may be enrolled, based on the original planned cohort of 
16 subjects and an expansion cohort that may enroll up to an additional 44 
subjects.  At least 32 subjects will receive CRS -207 in combination with 
chemotherap y (Cohort 1) .  Additional subjects (up to 28) will receive Cy one day 
prior to each CRS-207 administration combined  with chemotherapy  (Cohort 2). 
The originally planned sample size calculation was based on the primary endpoint 
of change in  mesothelin- specific T cell responses as measured from ELISPOT. 
With one primary parameter (ELISPOT) to be measured with respect to a change from baseline  at three post -baseline time points , the sample size will be selected 
to allow each test to be performed using a 0.017 two- tailed significanc e level, in 
 
  
 Aduro Biotech , Inc.  
Protocol ADU -CL-02-v8 CRS -207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin  
 
 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 66 order to allow the overall set of three tests to be very conservatively performed as 
if at an overall 0.05 level using a Bonferroni adjustment. Assuming 14 subject s 
with complete measurements of the main parameter at baseline and the three 
subsequent time points, there would be 80% power to detect a change from 
baseline to each time point equal to 1.0 standard deviations of the change (1.0 
effect size) using a two -tailed 0.017 level paired t -test.  This stringent multiplicity 
adjustment is for p ower computation only.  In practice, for analysis purposes, 
instead of requiring that each test achieve a 0.017 level in order to be declared significant, a less overly stringent Hochberg adjustment may be used .  In order to 
allow for a small number of ine valuable subjects, up to 16 subjects could  be 
enrolled . 
The expansion cohort of up to 44 additional subjects , including subjects receiving 
Cy one day prior to CRS -207 (Cohort 2)  is intended to obtain additional safety , 
immune  and efficacy data for future study planning .  The  expansion sample size is 
based on practical rather than statistical considerations.

9.1 INFORMED CONSENT AND AUTHORIZATION FOR USE AND 
DISCLOSURE OF PHI  
Written informed consent and authorization of use and disclosure of PHI must be 
obtained from each subject (or the subject’s legally authorized representative) before performing any study -specific screening/baseline period evaluations.  One 
copy of the signed ICF and authorization for use and disclosure of the PHI form will be given to the subject, and the investigator will retain the original.  The ICF and authorization for use and disclosure of PHI, which is prepared by the investigator or the site, must be reviewed and approved by Aduro, the study  
monitor (if applicable), and the site’s IRB before the initiation of the study.  The ICF must contain the 20 elements of informed consent described in ICH E6, Section 4.8.  The authorization for use and disclosure of PHI must contain the 
elements required  by Title 45 of the CFR, Section  164.508(b), for valid 
authorizations.   
9.2 STUDY DOCUMENTATION 
9.2.1 Investigator Information 
Investigator information is included in the SPM, which is updated as needed. 
9.2.2 Investigator Study Files 
Documentation about the investigator and study staff, the IRB, and the institution, is required by the sponsor before study site initiation.  Copies of these documents 
as well as supplemental information, such as the investigator’s obligations, IB, 
clinical study protocol and amendments, safety information, CTM, biological 
samples, laboratory, SPM and study logs, monitoring activities, 
sponsor/investigator/study monitor correspondence, will be kept on- site in study 
site-specific binders. 
Aduro will be responsible for maintaining backup of all CRF data.  The investigator is responsible for maintaining backup of all electronic data systems 
used for primary documentation or source documentation.  Backup of electronic data will be performed periodically as described in the site- specific SOPs.  
Backup records must be stored at a secure location on site, and backup and 
recovery logs must be maintained to facilitate data recovery.  Finally, if an

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 68 electronic medical records system that is not supported by the sponsor (or is 
discontinued or decommissioned) is used, the investigator must maintain a system 
to retrieve these records or arrange for the transfer of these records to an alternate 
electronic format or to paper. 
Changes to any electronic records requires an audit trail, in accordance with 
21 CFR 11.10(e), and should include who made the changes and when and why the changes were made.  An audit trail is defined as a secure, computer -generated, 
time-stamped electronic record that will allow reconstruction of the course of 
events relating to the creation, modification, and deletion of an electronic record.  Audit trails must be created incrementally, in chronological order, and in a manner that does not allow new audit trail information to overwrite existing data.  
Finally, audit trails should be in a readable format and readily available at the 
study site and any other location where electronic study records are maintained.  
Audit trails are generated automatically for electronic CRFs.  The investigator is responsible for maintaining audit trails of all electronic data systems used for 
primary documentation or source documentation. 
9.2.3 CRF s and Source Documentation 
The investigator must make study data accessible to the site monitor, to other authorized representatives of Aduro, and to the appropriate regulatory authority 
inspectors.  The original CRF for each subject will be checked against source 
documents at the study site by the site monitor.   
9.2.4 Retention of Study Documents  
According to ICH E6, Section 4.9, all CRFs, as well as  supporting paper and 
electronic documentation and administrative records, must be retained by the investigator for a minimum of 2 years after notification that the appropriate 
regulatory authority has approved the product for the indication under study, 
notification that the entire clinical investigation will not be used in support of a marketing application, or notification that the marketing application was not approved.  No study documents will be destroyed or moved to a new location 
without prior written approval from Aduro.  If the investigator relocates, retires, 
or withdraws from the clinical study for any reason, all records required to be maintained for the study should be transferred to an agreed -upon designee, such 
as another investigator at the institution where the study was conducted.

as that required for the subject electronic records to which they pertain.  The investigator must retain either the original or a certified copy of audit trails.  
9.3 CONFIDENTIALITY  
9.3.1 Data  
All information about the nature of the proposed investigation provided by Aduro 
or the study monitor to the investigator (with the exception of information 
required by law or regulations to be disclosed to the IRB, the subject, or the appropriate regulatory authority) must be kept in confidence by the investigator. 
9.3.2 Subject Anonymity  
The anonymity of participating subjects must be maintained.  Subjects will be identified by their initials and an assigned subject number on CRFs and other documents retrieved from the site or sent to the study monitor, Aduro, regulatory 
agencies, or central laboratories/reviewers.  Documents that identify the subject 
(e.g. the signed ICF) must be maintained in strict confidence by the investigator, 
except to the extent necessary to allow auditing by the appropriate regulatory authority, the study monitor, or Aduro representatives. 
9.4 PROTOCOL COMPLIANCE  
Substantive changes in the protocol include changes tha t affect the safety of 
subjects or changes that alter the scope of the investigation, the scientific quality of the study, the experimental design, dosages, assessment variable(s), the number 
of subjects treated, or the subject selection criteria.  Such changes must be 
prepared as a protocol amendment by Aduro only upon joint approval of the changes by Aduro and the investigator.  A protocol amendment must receive IRB 
approval before implementation.  In parallel with the IRB approval process, the 
protocol amendment will be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authority as an amendment to the regulatory submission under which the study is being conducted.  If a protocol amendment requires changes in the ICF, the revised ICF 
prepared by the investigator must also be approved by Aduro, the study monitor, 
and the IRB before implementation. 
Emergency departures from the protocol that eliminate an apparent immediate 
hazard to a particular subject and that are deemed crucial for the safety and

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 70 well-being of that subject may be instituted for that subject only.  The investigator 
or the attending physician also will contact the medical monitor as soon as 
possible in the case of such a departure.  These departures do not require

Background: The growth pattern of malignant pleural mesothelioma makes the use of RECIST (response
evaluation criteria in solid tumours) response crite ria difficult. We have developed and validated Modified
RECIST criteria adapted to the growth pattern of malignant pleural mesothelioma.
Patients and methods: We evaluated 73 patients from two clinical trials of cisplatin/gemcitabine chemo-
therapy in malignant pleural mesothelioma. Tumour thickness perpendicular to the chest wall or mediastinum
was measured in two positions at three separate levels on thoracic CT scans. The sum of the six measurements
defined a pleural unidimensional measure. Bidimensionally measureable lesions were measured unidimension-ally as for RECIST. All measurements were added to obtain the total tumour measurement. A reduction of
at least 30% on two occasions 4 weeks apart defi ned a partial response; an increase of 20% over the nadir
measurement, progressive disease. The validity of the modified criteria was gauged by evaluating survival and
pulmonary function.
Results: Response according to these criteria predicted for superior survival (15.1 versus 8.9 months; P = 0.03)
and forced vital capacity (FVC) increase during treatment ( P <0.0001). A significant correlation between
change in linear tumour measurement and FVC was seen ( R = 0.63; P = 0.0001).
Conclusion: These Modified RECIST criteria for tumour response correlate with survival and lung function
and can be used to measure outcome in pleural mesothelioma.

Introduction
The ability to measure reproducibly tumour response to treatment
is vital in the development of new drugs and therapeutic combina-tions, particularly for the conducting of phase II studies. Con-
ventional response criteria have always been difficult to apply to
malignant mesothelioma due to its unique pattern of growth.
Malignant mesothelioma most  commonly grows as a ‘rind’
around the pleural surface, and on computed tomography (CT)scan may not produce spherical lesions with bidimensionallymeasurable diameters. The WHO criteria [1] are poorly suited toevaluating response in mesothelioma, as they were developedprincipally to assess bidimensionally measurable disease. Whenused for unidimensional measurement, these criteria require a 50%decrease in the sum of unidimensional measurements to define apartial response (PR). This equates to a 75% decrease in the sumof the products of perpendicular diameters rather than the 50%decrease required to define response in bidimensionally measur-
able lesions.The recently developed RECIST (response evaluation criteria
in solid tumours) criteria [2] are more suited to tumour assessment
in mesothelioma, as they specify the use of unidimensional measure-
ments, with PR defined as a 30% decrease in the sum of the
longest diameter for all target lesions. However, the selection of
measurement sites in mesothelioma is difficult, and without fur-
ther definition of the method of measurement, the RECIST criteriacould be applied differently by different investigators (Figure
1A). Early experience suggests that modification of the criteria
may be required in the special case of mesothelioma [3].
We have developed a modification of the RECIST criteria
specifically to address the diffi culties of measurement inherent in
assessing changes in tumour bulk in pleural mesothelioma. We
have previously performed two phase II clinical trials of the use ofcisplatin and gemcitabine in patients with measurable pleuralmesothelioma; a single centre st udy [4] and a subsequent confirm-
atory multicentre study [5]. In these studies, response rates of
47.6% [4] and 33% [5] were seen. Response criteria that incor-
porated both unidimensional and bidimensional measurements
had been developed and used to assess response in these two trials(‘original response criteria’). Using Modified RECIST criteria,we have now reassessed the response to treatment for a total of
73 patients who entered these two studies. To validate these new by guest on October 28, 2011 http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from Aduro Biotech, Inc.

criteria we have related response to survival and to serial changes
in pulmonary function on treatment.
Patients and methods
Patient population
Data on the 73 patients entered in the two previous clinical trials of cisplatin
and gemcitabine in malignant pleural mesothelioma were obtained. All patients
had measurable disease, defined as pleural tu mour thickness of at least 1.5 cm
on spiral CT scan, and histologically or cytologically confirmed mesothelioma.CT scans had been performed in all patients prior to the first cycle of chemo-therapy, and then before the second, fourth and sixth cycles. Further CT scans
were performed after the final cycle of chemotherapy, and then twice a month
until disease progression. Forced vital capacity (FVC) had been measuredprior to study entry and on day 1 of each chemotherapy cycle in 52 patientsentered on the second study.
The original response criteria used in both trials were as follows. Tumour
measurements were performed on transverse cuts on thoracic CT scans at three
separate anatomically reproducible levels on the study entry CT scan and at the
same levels on subsequent scans. Where possi ble, bidimensional lesions were
measured. If there were no bidimensiona lly measurable lesions, unidimen-
sional measurements of pleural tum our thickness were performed. Bidimen-
sionally measurable lesions were m easured using the longest  dimension and
the length perpendicular to the longest measurement. For unidimensionally
measurable lesions, thickness of pleural  tumour was measured at two separate
sites on each of the three levels and the six measurements summated to pro-
duce a total measurement. Palpable mass es were measured clinically on day 1
of each cycle as for bidimensionally  measurable lesions. A pleural effusion
was not considered a measurable lesion.
Tumour response was defined as: (i) complete response (CR): disappear-
ance of all known disease, determined by two observations not less than 4 weeksapart; (ii) PR: a ≥50% decrease in the sum of the products of perpendicular
diameters of bidimensionally measured lesions on two occasions not less than4 weeks apart, or a ≥30% decrease in the sum of linear tumour measurements
on two observations not less than 4 weeks apart; (iii) no change: a decrease in
bidimensional tumour area of <50% or an increase of <25%, or a decrease in
the sum of unidimensional measurements of <30% or an increase of <25%,provided no new lesions have appe ared; (iv) progressive disease: a ≥25%
increase in the size of the tumour be ing measured (unidimensi onal or bidimen-
sional) or the appearance of new lesions.
Where response at sites measured bidimensionally differed from that at
sites measured unidimensionally, the overall patient response was assessed byan audit group. The sites with dominant tumour bulk were favoured.
The protocols for each study were approved by the Committee for Human
Rights of the University of Western Australia and the Sir Charles Gairdner
Hospital Clinical Drug Trials Commi ttee. Written informed consent was
obtained from each patient before entry.
Modified RECIST criteria
Modified RECIST criteria were developed.  The major problems in applying
the RECIST criteria to malignant ple ural mesothelioma are in the interpreta-
tion of the meaning and placement of th e ‘longest unidimensi onal diameter’ of
the target tumour mass to be measured. The longest diameter of a tumour mass
is frequently that which follows the inner curve of the chest wall. Defining thelimits of such a diameter  is often problematical. When the tumour regresses
with treatment the line may cross an area outside the tumour margin because ofthe curve of the chest wall. This may produce difficulty with reproducibility ofmeasurement. Furthermore, the longest tumour diameter may be between two
fixed structures, such as the thoracic vertebrae and the carina, and measure-
ment in these areas may not fully reflect tumour response.The Modified RECIST criteria we have developed were as follows. Tumour
thickness perpendicular to the chest wall or mediastinum was measured in two
positions at three separate levels on transverse cuts of CT scan (Figure 1B).The sum of the six measurements defi ned a pleural unidimensional measure.
Transverse cuts at least 1 cm apart and related to anatomical landmarks in thethorax were chosen to allow reproducible assessment at later time points. If
measureable tumour was present, transverse cuts in the upper thorax, above thelevel of division of the main bronchi were preferre d. At reassessment, pleural
thickness was measured at the same position at the same level and by the sameobserver. This was not necessarily the greatest tumour thickness at that level.Nodal, subcutaneous and other bidimensionally measurable lesions were
measured unidimensionally as per the RECIST criteria. Unidimensional
measurements were added to obtain the total tumour measurement.
CR was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions with no evidence
of tumour elsewhere, and PR was defined as at least a 30% reduction in the
total tumour measurement. A confirmed response required a repeat obser-vation on two occasions 4 weeks apart. Progressive disease (PD) was definedas an increase of at least 20% in th e total tumour measurement over the nadir
measurement, or the appearance of one or more new lesions. Patients withstable disease (SD) were those who ful filled the criteria for neither PR nor PD.

Validation of modified criteria
The response status of all 73 patients was re-assessed at each trial time point
according to these Modified RECIST criteri a. Patients were assigned to one of
two groups: responding patients (‘responders’) and patients with SD or PD
(‘non-responders’). Overall su rvival from the start of treatment and serial
changes in FVC were analysed for these two groups as a surrogate measure ofpatient benefit.
Results
Tumour measurements from a total of 236 CT scans from 73
patients were reassessed for response status at each time point inthe trials according to the modified  criteria. In general there was a
close correlation between the origi nal response criteria and the
Modified RECIST. Of 81 time points originally showing PR, 72remained classified as PR, five became SD and four became PD.Of 105 time points originally showing SD, 93 remained as SD, 11became PR and one became PD. Of 50 time points originallyshowing PD, 47 remained PD, two became SD and one becamePR (Table 1). The overall confir med response rate as assessed by
the two systems did not differ, as two patients classified as SDbecame PR and two patients classifi ed as PR became SD (Table 2).
Median survival was plotted as  a Kaplan–Meier curve for the
responding and non-responding patients (Figure 2). There was
a statistically significant difference in survival between thetwo patient groups (log rank test P = 0.03). Median survival was
15.1 months for responding patients and 8.9 months for non-responding patients.
FVC was plotted as a percentage of starting FVC for the
responding and non-responding patients (Figure 3). FVC improvedsignificantly over the course of treatment for responding patientsas compared with non-responding patients ( P = 0.0001).
The change in FVC against change in linear tumour measure-
ment was plotted for each patient (Figure 4); a significant cor-
relation was seen ( R = 0.63, P = 0.001).
Discussion
The response criteria used in our previous two trials of chemo-therapy in mesothelioma inc orporated bidimensional measure-
ments, as the WHO response criteria were widely used when thefirst of these trials began accrua l. These response criteria were
not altered for the second trial, which sought to broaden theapplicability of our findings in the first single-centre study into aTable 1.  Comparison of response at individual time point observations

life and lung function end points. In order to make the response
rates of the two trials directly comparable, it was important that
the measurement criteria used in the two studies were the same.Subsequently, the RECIST criteria have been developed andbecome widely accepted and used in clinical trials. The applica-
tion of RECIST criteria could, however, be variably interpreted by
different investigators in mesothelioma, and this may lead tounsatisfactory results [3]. We have developed Modified RECISTcriteria that are specifically designed to address the unique growthpattern of pleural malignant me sothelioma. Use of these modified
response criteria did not materially alter the response rates in ourtwo previous trials. However, the modified criteria avoided diffi-cult and ambiguous situations that arose in response interpretationin the two previous trials; for example, how to evaluate responsewhen discordance between unidi mensional and bidimensional
lesions occurred.
Whilst tumour response and progression directly reflect changes
in tumour bulk, they are most clinically useful when they relateclosely to other measures of a patient’s condition. Response is asurrogate for patient benefit in the evaluation of new drugs and
combinations. Patient benefit in pleural mesothelioma may include
an improvement in survival or lung function, and improvement insymptom control or quality of life. Thus, it is important that anyvalid measurement of response should reflect changes in theseparameters. We have demonstrated that these Modified RECISTcriteria successfully distinguish between responders and non-responders for the parameters of survival and change in FVC, thusdemonstrating their validity.
Further evaluation of these modified criteria should be per-
formed before they can be incorporated routinely into future clin-ical trials. The development of an automated measurement formatmay enhance the speed and reproducibility of the measurements[6] and go some way to overcoming the potential problem of inter-observer variability. We have avoided this issue by using the sameobserver or an audit group to undertake the measurements. Testsof inter-observer variability are important, however, as has beendemonstrated in the assessment of response in lung cancer [7]. Toconfirm the practicality of the criteria they should be applied to agroup of clinicians who lack extensive experience in the measure-ment of mesothelioma in clinical trials.

FULL PRESCRIBING INFORMATION
1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE
1.1 Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer - Combination with Cisplatin
ALIMTA is indicated in combination with cisplatin therapy for the initial treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer.
1.2 Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer - Maintenance
ALIMTA is indicated for the maintenance treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-small 
cell lung cancer whose disease has not progressed after four cycles of platinum-based first-line chemotherapy.
1.3 Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung  Cancer - After Prior Chemotherapy
ALIMTA is indicated as a single-agent for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous non-
small cell lung cancer after prior chemotherapy.1.4 Mesothelioma
ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma whose 
disease is unresectable or who are otherwise not candidates for curative surgery.1.5 Limitations of Use
ALIMTA is not indicated for the treatment of patients with squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer. [see Clinical Studies 
(14.1, 14.2, 14.3)]
2 DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
2.1 Combination Use with Cisplatin
Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma
The recommended dose of ALIMTA is 500 mg/m2administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on Day 1 of each 
21-day cycle. The recommended dose of cisplatin is 75 mg/m2infused over 2 hours beginning approximately 30 minutes after the end
of ALIMTA administration. Patients should receive appropriate hydration prior to and/or after receiving cisplatin. See cisplati n
package insert for more information.
2.2 Single-Agent Use
Nonsquamous Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
The recommended dose of ALIMTA is 500 mg/m2administered as an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on Day 1 of each 
21-day cycle.
2.3 Premedication Regimen
Vitamin Supplementation
To reduce toxicity, patients treated with ALIMTA must be instructed to take a low-dose oral folic acid preparation or 
multivitamin with folic acid on a daily basis. At least 5 daily doses of folic acid must be taken during the 7-day period preceding the 
first dose of ALIMTA; and dosing should continue during the full course of therapy and for 21 days after the last dose of ALIMTA. 
Patients must also receive one (1) intramuscular injection of vitamin B 12during the week preceding the first dose of ALIMTA and 
every 3 cycles thereafter. Subsequent vitamin B 12injections may be given the same day as ALIMTA. In clinical trials, the dose of folic 
acid studied ranged from 350 to 1000 mcg, and the dose of vitamin B 12was 1000 mcg. The most commonly used dose of oral folic 
acid in clinical trials was 400 mcg [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .
Corticosteroid
Skin rash has been reported more frequently in patients not pretreated with a corticosteroid. Pretreatment with dexamethasone 
(or equivalent) reduces the incidence and severity of cutaneous reaction. In clinical trials, dexamethasone 4 mg was given by mo uth 
twice daily the day before, the day of, and the day after ALIMTA administration [see Warnings and Precautions (5.1)] .
2.4 Laboratory Monitoring and Dose Reduction/Discontinuation Recommendations
Monitoring
Complete blood cell counts, including platelet counts, should be performed on all patients receiving ALIMTA. Patients should 
be monitored for nadir and recovery, which were tested in the clinical study before each dose and on days 8 and 15 of each cycle . 
Patients should not begin a new cycle of treatment unless the ANC is ൒1500 cells/mm3, the platelet count is ൒100,000 cells/mm3, and 
creatinine clearance is ൒45 mL/min. Periodic chemistry tests should be performed to evaluate renal and hepatic function [see 
Warnings and Precautions (5.5)] .
Dose Reduction Recommendations
Dose adjustments at the start of a subsequent cycle should be based on nadir hematologic counts or maximum nonhematologic 
toxicity from the preceding cycle of therapy. Treatment may be delayed to allow sufficient time for recovery. Upon recovery, pat ients 
should be retreated using the guidelines in Tables 1-3, which are suitable for using ALIMTA as a single-agent or in combination with 
cisplatin.Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc.

aThese criteria meet the CTC version 2.0 (NCI 1998) definition of ൒CTC Grade 2 bleeding.
If patients develop nonhematologic toxicities (excluding neurotoxicity) ൒Grade 3, treatment should be withheld until 
resolution to less than or equal to the patient’s pre-therapy value. Treatment should be resumed according to guidelines in Tab le 2.

Discontinuation Recommendation
ALIMTA therapy should be discontinued if a patient experiences any hematologic or nonhematologic Grade 3 or 4 toxicity 
after 2 dose reductions or immediately if Grade 3 or 4 neurotoxicity is observed.
Renally Impaired Patients
In clinical studies, patients with creatinine clearance ൒45 mL/min required no dose adjustments other than those 
recommended for all patients. Insufficient numbers of patients with creatinine clearance below 45 mL/min have been treated to ma ke 
dosage recommendations for this group of patients [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Therefore, ALIMTA should not be 
administered to patients whose creatinine clearance is <45 mL/min using the standard Cockcroft and Gault formula (below) or GFR 
measured by Tc99m-DPTA serum clearance method:
Males:[140 - Age in years] × Actual Body Weight (kg)= mL/min72 × Serum Creatinine (mg/dL)
Females: Estimated creatinine clearance for males × 0.85
Caution should be exercised when administering ALIMTA concurrently with NSAIDs to patients whose creatinine clearance 
is <80 mL/min [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] .
2.5 Preparation and Administration Precautions
As with other potentially toxic anticancer agents, care should be exercised in the handling and preparation of infusion 
solutions of ALIMTA. The use of gloves is recommended. If a solution of ALIMTA contacts the skin, wash the skin immediately and  
thoroughly with soap and water. If ALIMTA contacts the mucous membranes, flush thoroughly with water. Several published 
guidelines for handling and disposal of anticancer agents are available [see References (15)] .
ALIMTA is not a vesicant. There is no specific antidote for extravasation of ALIMTA. To date, there have been few reported 
cases of ALIMTA extravasation, which were not assessed as serious by the investigator. ALIMTA extravasation should be managed
with local standard practice for extravasation as with other non-vesicants.
2.6 Preparation for Intravenous Infusion Administration
1. Use aseptic technique during the reconstitution and further dilution of ALIMTA for intravenous infusion administration.
2. Calculate the dose of ALIMTA and determine the number of vials needed. Vials contain either 100 mg or 500 mg of
ALIMTA. The vials contain an excess of ALIMTA to facilitate delivery of label amount.
3. Reconstitute each 100-mg vial with 4.2 ml of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (preservative free). Reconstitute each
500-mg vial with 20 mL of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection (preservative free). Reconstitution of either size vial gives aProtocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 87
4
solution containing 25 mg/mL ALIMTA. Gently swirl each vial until the powder is completely dissolved. The resulting 
solution is clear and ranges in color from colorless to yellow or green-yellow without adversely affecting product quality. 
The pH of the reconstituted ALIMTA solution is between 6.6 and 7.8. FURTHER DILUTION IS REQUIRED.
4. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration,
whenever solution and container permit. If particulate matter is observed, do not administer.
5. An appropriate quantity of the reconstituted ALIMTA solution must be further diluted into a solution of 0.9% Sodium
Chloride Injection (preservative free), so that the total volume of solution is 100 ml. ALIMTA is administered as anintravenous infusion over 10 minutes.
6. Chemical and physical stability of reconstituted and infusion solutions of ALIMTA were demonstrated for up to 24 hours
following initial reconstitution, when stored at refrigerated or ambient room temperature [see USP Controlled RoomTemperature] and lighting. When prepared as directed, reconstitution and infusion solutions of ALIMTA contain noantimicrobial preservatives. Discard any unused portion.
Reconstitution and further dilution prior to intravenous infusion is only recommended with 0.9% Sodium Chloride 
Injection (preservative free). ALIMTA is physically incompatible with diluents containing calcium, including Lactated Ringer’s Injection, USP and Ringer’s Injection, USP and therefore these should not be used. Coadministration of ALIMTA with other drugs 
and diluents has not been studied, and therefore is not recommended. ALIMTA is compatible with standard polyvinyl chloride (PVC)  
administration sets and intravenous solution bags.
3 DOSAGE FORMS AND STRENGTHS
ALIMTA, pemetrexed for injection, is a white to either light-yellow or green-yellow lyophilized powder available in sterile 
single-use vials containing 100 mg or 500 mg pemetrexed.4 CONTRAINDICATIONS
ALIMTA is contraindicated in patients who have a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to pemetrexed or to any other 
ingredient used in the formulation.5 WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS
5.1 Premedication Regimen
Need for Folate and Vitamin B
12Supplementation
Patients treated with ALIMTA must be instructed to take folic acid and vitamin B 12as a prophylactic measure to reduce 
treatment-related hematologic and GI toxicity [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] . In clinical studies, less overall toxicity and 
reductions in Grade 3/4 hematologic and nonhematologic toxicities su ch as neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and infection with 
Grade 3/4 neutropenia were reported when pretreatment with folic acid and vitamin B 12was administered.
Corticosteroid Supplementation
Skin rash has been reported more frequently in patients not pretreated with a corticosteroid in clinical trials. Pretreatment wi th 
dexamethasone (or equivalent) reduces the incidence and severity of cutaneous reaction [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] .
5.2 Bone Marrow Suppression
ALIMTA can suppress bone marrow function, as manifested by neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, and anemia (or pancytopenia) 
[see Adverse Reactions (6.1)] ; myelosuppression is usually the dose-limiting toxicity. Dose reductions for subsequent cycles are based 
on nadir ANC, platelet count, and maximum nonhematologic toxicity seen in the previous cycle [see Dosage and Administration 
(2.4)] .
5.3 Decreased Renal Function
ALIMTA is primarily eliminated unchanged by renal excretion. No dosage adjustment is needed in patients with creatinine 
clearance ൒45 mL/min. Insufficient numbers of patients have been studied with creatinine clearance <45 mL/min to give a dose 
recommendation. Therefore, ALIMTA should not be administered to patients whose creatinine clearance is <45 mL/min [see Dosage 
and Administration (2.4)] .
One patient with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 19 mL/min) who did not receive folic acid and vitamin B 12
died of drug-related toxicity following administration of ALIMTA alone.
5.4 Use with Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) with Mild to Moderate Renal Insufficiency
Caution should be used when administer ing NSAIDs concurren tly with ALIMTA to patients with mild to moderate renal 
insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 mL/min) [see Drug Interactions (7.1)] .
5.5 Required Laboratory Monitoring
Patients should not begin a new cycle of treatment unless the ANC is ൒1500 cells/mm3, the platelet count is 
൒100,000 cells /mm3, and creatinine clearance is ൒45 mL/min [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] .
5.6 Pregnancy Category D
Based on its mechanism of action, ALIMTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. Pemetrexed 
administered intraperitoneally to mice during organogenesis was embr yotoxic, fetotoxic and teratogenic in mice at greater than 
1/833rd the recommended human dose. If ALIMTA is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this 
drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to  avoid Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc.

becoming pregnant. Women should be advised to use effective contraceptive measures to prevent pregnancy during treatment with
ALIMTA [see Use in Specific Populations (8.1)] .
6 ADVERSE REACTIONS
6.1 Clinical Trials Experience
Because clinical trials are conducted under widely varying conditions, adverse reactions rates cannot be directly compared to
rates in other clinical trials and may not reflect the rates observed in clinical practice.
In clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions (incidence ൒20%) during therapy with ALIMTA as a single-agent were 
fatigue, nausea, and anorexia. Additional common adverse reactions (incidence ൒20%) during therapy with ALIMTA when used in 
combination with cisplatin included vomiting, neutropenia, leukopenia, anemia, stomatitis/pharyngitis, thrombocytopenia, and 
constipation.
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) - Combination with Cisplatin
Table 4 provides the frequency and severity of adverse reactions that have been reported in >5% of 839 patients with NSCLC 
who were randomized to study and received ALIMTA plus cisplatin and 830 patients with NSCLC who were randomized to study and 
received gemcitabine plus cisplatin. All patients received study therapy as initial treatment for locally advanced or metastati c NSCLC 
and patients in both treatment groups were fully supplemented with folic acid and vitamin B 12.

No clinically relevant differences in Grade 3/4 adverse reactions were seen in patients based on age, gender, ethnic origin, or 
histology except a higher incidence of Grade 3/4 fatigue for Caucas ian patients compared to non-Caucasian patients (6.5% versus 
0.6%).
Safety was assessed by exposure for patients who received at least one dose of ALIMTA (N=438). The incidence of adverse 
reactions was evaluated for patients who received ≤6 cycles of ALIMTA, and compared to patients who received >6 cycles of 
ALIMTA. Increases in adverse reactions (all grades) were observed with longer exposure; however no clinically relevant differen ces 
in Grade 3/4 adverse reactions were seen.
Consistent with the higher incidence of anemia (all grades) on the ALIMTA arm, use of transfusions (mainly RBC) and 
erythropoiesis stimulating agents (ESAs; erythropoietin and darbepoetin) were higher in the ALIMTA arm compared to the placebo arm (transfusions 9.5% versus 3.2%, ESAs 5.9% versus 1.8%).Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc.

Cases of esophagitis have been reported in clinical trials.
6.2 Postmarketing Experience
The following adverse reactions have been identified during post-approval use of ALIMTA. Because these reactions are 
reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size, it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or est ablish a 
causal relationship to drug exposure.
These reactions have occurred with ALIMTA when used as a single-agent and in combination therapies.Gastrointestinal — colitis

Skin — Bullous conditions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. Some cases were fatal.
7 DRUG INTERACTIONS
7.1 Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)
Although ibuprofen (400 mg four times a day) can decrease the clearance of pemetrexed, it can be administered with 
ALIMTA in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance ൒80 mL/min). No dose adjustment of ALIMTA is needed with 
concomitant NSAIDs in patients with normal renal function [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] .
Caution should be used when administering NSAIDs concurrently with ALIMTA to patients with mild to moderate renal 
insufficiency (creatinine clearance from 45 to 79 mL/min). NSAIDs with short elimination half-lives (e.g., diclofenac, indomethac in)
should be avoided for a period of 2 days before, the day of, and 2 days following administration of ALIMTA.
In the absence of data regarding potential interaction between ALIMTA and NSAIDs with longer half-lives (e.g., meloxicam, 
nabumetone), patients taking these NSAIDs should interrupt dosing for at least 5 days before, the day of, and 2 days following 
ALIMTA administration. If concomitant administration of NSAIDs is necessary, patients should be monitored closely for toxicity, 
especially myelosuppression, renal, and gastrointestinal toxicity.
7.2 Nephrotoxic DrugsProtocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 93
10
ALIMTA is primarily eliminated unchanged renally as a result of glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Concomitant 
administration of nephrotoxic drugs could result in delayed clearance of ALIMTA. Concomitant administration of substances that are 
also tubularly secreted (e.g., probenecid) could potentially result in delayed clearance of ALIMTA.
8 USE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONS
8.1 Pregnancy
Teratogenic Effects - Pregnancy Category D [see Warnings and Precautions (5.6)]
Based on its mechanism of action, ALIMTA can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. There are no 
adequate and well controlled studies of ALIMTA in pregnant women. Pemetrexed was embryotoxic, fetotoxic, and teratogenic in 
mice. In mice, repeated intraperitoneal doses of pemetrexed when given during organogenesis caused fetal malformations (incompl ete 
ossification of talus and skull bone; about 1/833rd the recommended intravenous human dose on a mg/m2basis), and cleft palate 
(1/33rd the recommended intravenous human dose on a mg/m2basis). Embryotoxicity was characterized by increased embryo-fetal 
deaths and reduced litter sizes. If ALIMTA is used during pregnancy, or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the 
patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effec tive 
contraceptive measures to prevent pregnancy during the treatment with ALIMTA.
8.3 Nursing Mothers
It is not known whether ALIMTA or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human 
milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in nursing infants from ALIMTA, a decision should be made to 
discontinue nursing or discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the drug for the mother.
8.4 Pediatric Use
Efficacy of ALIMTA in pediatric patients has not been demonstrated. ALIMTA was administered as an intravenous infusion 
over 10 minutes on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle to pediatric patients with recurrent solid tumors in a Phase 1 study (32 patients) an d a 
Phase 2 study (72 patients). All patients received pretreatment with vitamin B 12and folic acid supplementation and dexamethasone. 
The dose escalation in the Phase 1 study determined the maximum tolerated dose was 1910 mg/m2and this dose (or 60 mg/kg for 
patients <12 months old) was evaluated in the Phase 2 study of patients with relapsed or refractory osteosarcoma, Ewing 
sarcoma/peripheral PNET, rhabdomyosarcoma, neuroblastoma, ependymoma, medulloblastoma/supratentorial PNET, or non-brainstem high grade glioma. No responses were observed among the 72 patients in this Phase 2 trial. The most common toxicities reported were hematological (leukopenia, neutropenia/granulocytopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, and lymphopenia), liver function abnormalities (increased ALT/AST), fatigue, and nausea. 
The single dose pharmacokinetics of ALIMTA administered in doses ranging from 400 to 2480 mg/m
2were evaluated in the 
Phase 1 trial in 22 patients (13 males and 9 females) aged 4 to 18 years (average age 12 years). Pemetrexed exposure (AUC and C max)
appeared to increase proportionally with dose. The average pemetrexed clearance (2.30 L/h/m2) and half-life (2.3 hours) in pediatric 
patients were comparable to values reported in adults.
8.5 Geriatric Use
ALIMTA is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of adverse reactions to this drug may be greater in 
patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be  taken 
in dose selection. Renal function monitoring is recommended with administration of ALIMTA. No dose reductions other than those 
recommended for all patients are necessary for patients 65 years of age or older [see Dosage and Administration (2.4)] .
In the initial treatment non-small cell lung cancer clinical trial, 37.7% of patients treated with ALIMTA plus cisplatin were 
൒65 years and Grade 3/4 neutropenia was greater as compared to patients <65 years (19.9% versus 12.2%). For patients <65 years, the 
HR for overall survival was 0.96 (95% CI: 0.83, 1.10) and for patients ൒65 years the HR was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.06) in the intent to 
treat population.
In the maintenance non-small cell lung cancer trial 33.3% of patients treated with ALIMTA were ൒65 years and no 
differences were seen in Grade 3/4 adverse reactions as compared to patients <65 years. For patients <65 years, the HR for overall  
survival was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.58, 0.93) and for patients ൒65 years the HR was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.65, 1.21) in the intent to treat 
population.
In the non-small cell lung cancer trial after prior chemotherapy, 29.7% patients treated with ALIMTA were ൒65 years and 
Grade 3/4 hypertension was greater as compared to patients <65 years. For patients <65 years, the HR for overall survival was 0.95  
(95% CI: 0.76, 1.19), and for patients ൒65 years the HR was 1.15 (95% CI: 0.79, 1.68) in the intent to treat population.
The mesothelioma trial included 36.7% patients treated with ALIMTA plus cisplatin that were ൒65 years, and Grade 3/4 
fatigue, leukopenia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia were greater as compared to patients <65 years. For patients <65 years, th e 
HR for overall survival was 0.71 (95% CI: 0.53, 0.96) and for patients ൒65 years, the HR was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.59, 1.22) in the intent 
to treat population.
8.6 Patients with Hepatic Impairment
There was no effect of elevated AST, ALT, or total bilirubin on the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed [see Clinical 
Pharmacology (12.3)] .
Dose adjustments based on hepatic impairment experienced during treatment with ALIMTA are provided in Table 2 [see 
Dosage and Administration (2.4)] .

CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 94
11
ALIMTA is known to be primarily excreted by the kidneys. Decreased renal function will result in reduced clearance and 
greater exposure (AUC) to ALIMTA compared with patients with normal renal function [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and 
Clinical Pharmacology (12.3)] . Cisplatin coadministration with ALIMTA has not been studied in patients with moderate renal 
impairment.
8.8 Gender
In the initial treatment non-small cell lung cancer trial, 70% of patients were males and 30% females. For males the HR for 
overall survival was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.85, 1.10) and for females the HR was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.70, 1.06) in the intent to treat populati on.
In the maintenance non-small cell lung cancer trial, 73% of patients were males and 27% females. For males the HR for 
overall survival was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.63, 0.96) and for females the HR was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.21) in the intent to treat populati on.
In the non-small cell lung cancer trial after prior chemotherapy, 72% of patients were males and 28% females. For males the 
HR for overall survival was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.76, 1.19) and for females the HR was 1.28 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.91) in the intent to treat 
population.
In the mesothelioma trial, 82% of patients were males and 18% females. For males the HR for overall survival was 0.85 
(95% CI: 0.66, 1.09) and for females the HR was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.27, 0.85) in the intent to treat population.
8.9 Race
In the initial treatment non-small cell lung cancer trial, 78% of patients were Caucasians, 13% East/Southeast Asians, and 
9% others. For Caucasians, the HR for overall survival was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.04), for East/Southeast Asians the HR was 0.86 
(95% CI: 0.61, 1.21), and for others the HR was 1.24 (95% CI: 0.84, 1.84) in the intent to treat population.
In the maintenance non-small cell lung cancer trial, 65% of patients were Caucasians, 23% East Asian, and 12% others. For 
Caucasians the HR for overall survival was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.97), for East Asians was 1.05 (95% CI: 0.70, 1.59) and for others 
the HR was 0.46 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.79) in the intent to treat population.
In the non-small cell lung cancer trial after prior chemotherapy, 71% of patients were Caucasians and 29% others. For 
Caucasians the HR for overall survival was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.73, 1.15) and for others the HR was 1.27 (95% CI: 0.87, 1.87) in the 
intent to treat population.
In the mesothelioma trial, 92% of patients were Caucasians and 8% others. For Caucasians, the HR for overall survival was 
0.77 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.97) and for others the HR was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.39, 1.90) in the intent to treat population.
10 OVERDOSAGE
There have been few cases of ALIMTA overdose. Reported toxicities included neutropenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
mucositis, and rash. Anticipated complications of overdose include bone marrow suppression as manifested by neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and anemia. In addition, infection with or without fever, diarrhea, and mucositis may be seen. If an overdose  
occurs, general supportive measures should be instituted as deemed necessary by the treating physician.
In clinical trials, leucovorin was permitted for CTC Grade 4 leukopenia lasting ൒3 days, CTC Grade 4 neutropenia lasting 
൒3 days, and immediately for CTC Grade 4 thrombocytopenia, bleeding associated with Grade 3 thrombocytopenia, or Grade 3 
or 4 mucositis. The following intravenous doses and schedules of leucovorin were recommended for intravenous use: 100 mg/m2, 
intravenously once, followed by leucovorin, 50 mg/m2, intravenously every 6 hours for 8 days.
The ability of ALIMTA to be dialyzed is unknown.

pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidin-5-yl)ethyl]benzoyl]-, disodium salt, heptahydrate. It is a white to almost-white solid with a molecular formula 
of C 20H19N5Na2O6•7H 2O and a molecular weight of 597.49. The structural formula is as follows:
ALIMTA is supplied as a sterile lyophilized powder for intravenous infusion available in single-dose vials. The product is a 
white to either light yellow or green-yellow lyophilized solid. Each 100-mg or 500-mg vial of ALIMTA contains pemetrexed 
disodium equivalent to 100 mg pemetrexed and 106 mg mannitol or 500 mg pemetrexed and 500 mg mannitol, respectively. 
Hydrochloric acid and/or sodium hydroxide may have been added to adjust pH.
12 CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
12.1 Mechanism of Action
ALIMTA, pemetrexed for injection, is a folate analog metabolic inhibitor that exerts its action by disrupting folate-dependent 
metabolic processes essential for cell replication. In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS ),

12
dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltr ansferase (GARFT), which are folate-dependent enzymes 
involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Pemetrexed is taken into cells by membrane carriers su ch as 
the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, pemetrexed is converted to 
polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibito rs of 
TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, is thought to occur  to 
a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites are thought to have an increased intracellular half-life resulti ng in 
prolonged drug action in malignant cells.
12.2 Pharmacodynamics
Preclinical studies have shown that pemetrexed inhibits the in vitro growth of mesothelioma cell lines (MSTO-211H, 
NCI-H2052). Studies with the MSTO-211H mesothelioma cell line showed synergistic effects when pemetrexed was combined 
concurrently with cisplatin.
Absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) following single-agent administration of ALIMTA to patients not receiving folic acid and 
vitamin B 12supplementation were characterized using population pharmacodynamic analyses. Severity of hematologic toxicity, as 
measured by the depth of the ANC nadir, correlates with the systemic exposure, or area under the curve (AUC) of pemetrexed. It w as 
also observed that lower ANC nadirs occurred in patients with elevated baseline cystathionine or homocysteine concentrations. Th e 
levels of these substances can be reduced by folic acid and vitamin B 12supplementation. There is no cumulative effect of pemetrexed 
exposure on ANC nadir over multiple treatment cycles.
Time to ANC nadir with pemetrexed systemic exposure (AUC), varied between 8 to 9.6 days over a range of exposures from 
38.3 to 316.8 mcg• hr/mL. Return to baseline ANC occurred 4.2 to 7.5 days after the nadir over the same range of exposures.
12.3 PharmacokineticsAbsorption
The pharmacokinetics of ALIMTA administered as a single-agent in doses ranging from 0.2 to 838 mg/m
2infused over a 
10-minute period have been evaluated in 426 cancer patients with a variety of solid tumors. Pemetrexed total systemic
exposure (AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (C max) increase proportionally with dose. The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed
do not change over multiple treatment cycles.
Distribution
Pemetrexed has a steady-state volume of distribution of 16.1 liter s. In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is approximately 
81% bound to plasma proteins. Binding is not affected by degree of renal impairment.Metabolism and Excretion
Pemetrexed is not metabolized to an appreciable extent a nd is primarily eliminated in the urine, with 70% to 90% of the dose 
recovered unchanged within the first 24 hours following administration. The clearance decreases, and exposure (AUC) increases, as 
renal function decreases. The total systemic clearance of pemetrexed is 91.8 mL/min and the elimination half-life of pemetrexed is 
3.5 hours in patients with normal renal function (creatinine clearance of 90 mL/min). 
The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed in special populations were examined in about 400 patients in controlled and single arm 
studies.
In vitro studies indicate that pemetrexed is a substrate of OAT3 (organic anion transporter 3), a transporter that may play a 
role in active secretion of pemetrexed.
Effect of Age
No effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed was observed over a range of 26 to 80 years.
Effect of Gender
The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed were not different in male and female patients.
Effect of Race
The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed were similar in Caucasians and patients of African descent. Insufficient data are 
available to compare pharmacokinetics for other ethnic groups.Effect of Hepatic Insufficiency
There was no effect of elevated AST, ALT, or total bilirubin on the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. However, studies of 
hepatically impaired patients have not been conducted [see Dosage and Administration (2.4) and Use in Specific Populations (8.6)] .
Effect of Renal Insufficiency
Pharmacokinetic analyses of pemetrexed included 127 patients with reduced renal function. Plasma clearance of pemetrexed 
decreases as renal function decreases, with a resultant increase in systemic exposure. Patients with creatinine clearances of 45, 50, and 
80 mL/min had 65%, 54%, and 13% increases, respectively in pemetrexed total systemic exposure (AUC) compared to patients with creatinine clearance of 100 mL/min [see Warnings and Precautions (5.4) and Dosage and Administration (2.4)] .
Effect of Third Space Fluid
The effect of third space fluid, such as pleural effusion and ascites, on ALIMTA is not fully defined. A study of ALIMTA 
500 mg/m
2was performed in 31 solid tumor patients with stable third space fluid (All but 2 of the 31 patients included in study had 
mild or moderate amounts of third space fluid). Moderate pleural effusion was defined in the study as less than 1/3 the way up on one 
side with obscuring of the entire hemidiaphragm. Moderate ascites was defined as that detectable on physical exam. The pemetrex ed 
plasma concentrations in these patients were comparable to those observed in previous clinical trials in patients without third space 
fluid collections. Thus, drainage of mild or moderate third space fluid collection prior to ALIMTA treatment should be consider ed, but 
is probably not necessary. The effect of severe third space fluid on pharmacokinetics is not known.Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 96
13
Effect of Ibuprofen
Ibuprofen doses of 400 mg four times a day reduce pemetrexed’s clearance by about 20% (and increase AUC by 20%) in 
patients with normal renal function. The effect of greater doses of ibuprofen on pemetrexed pharmacokinetics is unknown [see Drug 
Interactions (7.1)] .
Effect of Aspirin
Aspirin, administered in low to moderate doses (325 mg every 6 hours), does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed. 
The effect of greater doses of aspirin on pemetrexed pharmacokinetics is unknown.
Effect of Cisplatin
Cisplatin does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed and the pharmacokinetics of total platinum are unaltered by 
pemetrexed.Effect of Vitamins
Coadministration of oral folic acid or intramuscular vitamin B
12does not affect the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed.
Drugs Metabolized by Cytochrome P450 Enzymes
Results from in vitro studies with human liver microsomes predict that pemetrexed would not cause clinically significant 
inhibition of metabolic clearance of drugs metabolized by CYP3A, CYP2D6, CYP2C9, and CYP1A2.
13 NONCLINICAL TOXICOLOGY
13.1 Carcinoge nesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with pemetrexed. Pemetrexed was clastogenic in the in vivo micronucleus 
assay in mouse bone marrow but was not mutagenic in multiple in vitro tests (Ames assay, CHO cell assay). Pemetrexed administered 
at i.v. doses of 0.1 mg/kg/day or greater to male mice (about 1/1666 the recommended human dose on a mg/m2basis) resulted in 
reduced fertility, hypospermia, and testicular atrophy.
14 CLINICAL STUDIES
14.1 Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) - Combination with Cisplatin
A multi-center, randomized, open-label study in 1725 chemonaive patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC was conducted to 
compare the overall survival following treatment with ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin (AC) versus gemcitabine in 
combination with cisplatin (GC). ALIMTA was administered intravenously over 10 minutes at a dose of 500 mg/m2with cisplatin 
administered intravenously at a dose of 75 mg/m2after ALIMTA administration, on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Gemcitabine was 
administered at a dose of 1250 mg/m2on Day 1 and Day 8, and cisplatin was administered intravenously at a dose of 75 mg/m2after 
administration of gemcitabine, on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. Treatment was administered up to a total of 6 cycles, and patients in 
both treatment arms received folic acid, vitamin B 12, and dexamethasone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] .
Patient demographics of the intent to treat (ITT) popula tion are shown in Table 9. The demographics and disease 
characteristics were well balanced.

A pre-specified analysis of the impact of NSCLC histology on ove rall survival was examined. Clinically relevant differences 
in survival according to histology were observed and are shown in Table 11. This difference in treatment effect for ALIMTA based on 
histology demonstrating a lack of efficacy in squamous cell histol ogy was also observed in the single-agent, second-line study and the 
maintenance study [see Clinical Studies (14.2, 14.3)] .

14.2 Non-Small Cell Lung  Cancer - Maintenance
A multi-center, randomized, double-blind, p lacebo-controlled study was conducted in 663 patients with Stage IIIb/IV NSCLC 
who did not progress after four cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients who did not progress were randomized 2:1 to rec eive 
ALIMTA or placebo immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy. ALIMTA was administered intravenously over 
10 minutes at a dose of 500 mg/m2on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle, until disease progression. Patients in both study arms received folic 
acid, vitamin B 12, and dexamethasone [see Dosage and Administration (2.3)] .
The study was designed to demonstrate superior progression-free survival and overall survival of ALIMTA over placebo. 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed by independent review. Patient characteristics of the intent to treat (ITT) populati on are 
shown in Table 12. The demographics and baseline disease characteristics were well balanced between study arms.

14.3 Non-Small Cell Lung Ca ncer - After Prior Chemotherapy
A multi-center, randomized, open label study was conducted in pa tients with Stage III or IV NSCLC after prior chemotherapy 
to compare the overall survival following treatment with ALIMTA versus docetaxel. ALIMTA was administered intravenously over 
10 minutes at a dose of 500 mg/m2and docetaxel was administered at 75 mg/m2as a 1-hour intravenous infusion. Both drugs were 
given on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. All patients treated with  ALIMTA received vitamin supplementation with folic acid and 
vitamin B 12. The study was intended to show either an overall survival superiority or non-inferiority of ALIMTA to docetaxel. Patient 
demographics of the intent to treat (ITT) population are shown in Table 15.

The primary endpoint in this study was overall survival. The median survival time was 8.3 months in the ALIMTA treatment 
arm and 7.9 months in the docetaxel arm, with a hazard ratio of 0.99 (see Table 16). The study did not show an overall survival 
superiority of ALIMTA.

in survival according to histology were observed and are shown in Table 17. This difference in treatment effect for ALIMTA based  on 
histology demonstrating a lack of efficacy in squamous cell histology was also observed in the first-line combination study and  in the 
maintenance study [see Clinical Studies (14.1, 14.2)] .

14.4 Malig nant Pleural Mesothelioma
A multi-center, randomized, single-blind study in 448 chemonaive patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) 
compared survival in patients treated with ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin to survival in patients receiving cisplatin alo ne. 
ALIMTA was administered intravenously over 10 minutes at a dose of 500 mg/m2and cisplatin was administered intravenously over 
2 hours at a dose of 75 mg/m2beginning approximately 30 minutes after the end of administration of ALIMTA. Both drugs were 
given on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle. After 117 patients were treated, white cell and GI toxicity led to a change in protocol where by 
all patients were given folic acid and vitamin B 12supplementation.
The primary analysis of this study was performed on the population of all patients randomly assigned to treatment who 
received study drug (randomized and treated). An analysis was also performed on patients who received folic acid and vitamin B 12
supplementation during the entire course of study therapy (fully supplemented), as supplementation is recommended [see Dosage and 
Administration (2.3)] . Results in all patients and those fully supplemented were similar. Patient demographics are shown in Table 18.

Similar results were seen in the analysis of patients (N=303) with confirmed histologic diagnosis of malignant pleural 
mesothelioma. There were too few non-white patients to assess possible ethnic differences. The effect in women (median survival  
15.7 months with the combination versus 7.5 mo nths on cisplatin alone), however, was larger than the effect in males (median survi val 
11 versus 9.4 respectively). As with any exploratory analysis, it is not clear whether this difference is real or is a chance fin ding.
Figure 5: Kaplan-Meier Estimates of Survival Time for ALIMTA plus Cisplatin and Cisplatin Alone in all Randomized and 
Treated Patients.
Objective tumor response for malignant pleural mesothelioma is difficult to measure and response criteria are not universally
agreed upon. However, based upon prospectively defined criteria, the objective tumor response rate for ALIMTA plus cisplatin wa s 
greater than the objective tumor response rate for cisplatin alone. There was also improvement in lung function (forced vital ca pacity) 
in the ALIMTA plus cisplatin arm compared to the control arm.
Patients who received full supplementation with folic acid and vitamin B 12during study therapy received a median of 6 and 
4 cycles in the ALIMTA/cisplatin (N=168) and cisplatin (N=163) arms, respectively. Patients who never received folic acid and 
vitamin B 12during study therapy received a median of 2 cycles in both treatment arms (N=32 and N=38 for the ALIMTA/cisplatin 
and cisplatin arm, respectively). Patients receiving ALIMTA in the fully supplemented group received a relative dose intensity of 93% 
of the protocol specified ALIMTA dose intensity; patients treated with cisplatin in the same group received 94% of the projecte d dose 
intensity. Patients treated with cisplatin alone had a dose intensity of 96%.

PLATINOL
(cisplatin for injection, USP) 
WARNING
PLATINOL (cisplatin for injection, USP) should be administered under the supervision 
of a qualified physician experienced in the use of cancer chemotherapeutic agents. 
Appropriate management of therapy and complications is possible only when adequate 
diagnostic and treatment facilities are readily available. 
Cumulative renal toxicity associated with PLATINOL is severe. Other major dose-related 
toxicities are myelosuppression, nausea, and vomiting. 
Ototoxicity, which may be more pronounced in children, and is manifested by tinnitus, 
and/or loss of high frequency hearing and occasionally deafness, is significant. 
Anaphylactic-like  reactions to PLATINOL have been reported. Facial edema, 
bronchoconstriction, tachycardia, and hypotension may occur within minutes of 
PLATINOL administration. Epinephrine, corticosteroids, and antihistamines have been 
effectively employed to al leviate symptoms (see WARNINGS  and ADVERSE 
REACTIONS ).
Exercise caution to prevent inadvertent PLATINOL overdose.  Doses greater than 
100 mg/m2/cycle once every 3 to 4 weeks are rarely used. Care must be taken to avoid 
inadvertent PLATINOL overdose due to confusion with PARAPLATIN (carboplatin) 
or prescribing practices that fail to differentiate daily doses from total dose per cycle. 
DESCRIPTION 
PLATINOL (cisplatin for injection, USP) is a white to light yellow lyophilized powder. 
Each vial of PLATINOL contains 50 mg cisplatin, 450 mg Sodium Chloride, USP, and 
500 mg Mannitol, USP. 
The active ingredient, cisplatin, is a yellow to orange crystalline powder with the 
molecular formula PtCl 2H6N2, and a molecular weight of 300.1. Cisplatin is a heavy

metal complex containing a central atom of platinum surrounded by two chloride atoms 
and two ammonia molecules in the cis position. It is soluble in water or saline at 
1 mg/mL and in dimethylformamide at 24 mg/mL. It has a melting point of 207q C. 
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY 
Plasma concentrations of the parent compound, cisplatin, decay monoexponentially with 
a half-life of about 20 to 30 minutes following bolus administrations of 50 or 100 mg/m2
doses. Monoexponential decay and plasma half-lives of about 0.5 hour are also seen 
following 2-hour or 7-hour infusions of 100 mg/m2. After the latter, the total body 
clearances and volumes of distribution at steady-state for cisplatin are about 15 to 16 L/h/m
2 and 11 to 12 L/m2.
Due to its unique chemical structure, the chlorine atoms of cisplatin are more subject to 
chemical displacement reactions by nucleophiles, such as water or sulfhydryl groups, 
than to enzyme-catalyzed metabolism. At physiological pH in the presence of 0.1M 
NaCl, the predominant molecular species are cisplatin and monohydroxymonochloro cis-
diammine platinum (II) in nearly equal concentrations. The latter, combined with the possible direct displacement of the chlorine atoms by sulfhydryl groups of amino acids or 
proteins, accounts for the instability of cisplatin in biological matrices. The ratios of 
cisplatin to total free (ultrafilterable) plati num in the plasma vary considerably between 
patients and range from 0.5 to 1.1 after a dose of 100 mg/m
2.
Cisplatin does not undergo the instantaneous and reversible binding to plasma proteins that is characteristic of normal drug-protein binding. However, the platinum from 
cisplatin, but not cisplatin itself, becomes bound to several plasma proteins, including 
albumin, transferrin, and gamma globulin. Three hours after a bolus injection and two 
hours after the end of a three-hour infusion, 90% of the plasma platinum is protein bound. 
The complexes between albumin and the platinum from cisplatin do not dissociate to a 
significant extent and are slowly eliminated with a minimum half-life of five days or 
more.

Following cisplatin doses of 20 to 120 mg/m2, the concentrations of platinum are highest 
in liver, prostate, and kidney; somewhat lower in bladder, muscle, testicle, pancreas, and 
spleen; and lowest in bowel, adrenal, heart, lung, cerebrum, and cerebellum. Platinum is 
present in tissues for as long as 180 days after the last administration. With the exception 
of intracerebral tumors, platinum concentrations in tumors are generally somewhat lower 
than the concentrations in the organ where the tumor is located. Different metastatic sites 
in the same patient may have different platinum concentrations. Hepatic metastases have 
the highest platinum concentrations, but these are similar to the platinum concentrations 
in normal liver. Maximum red blood cell concentrations of platinum are reached within 
90 to 150 minutes after a 100 mg/m2 dose of cisplatin and decline in a biphasic manner 
with a terminal half-life of 36 to 47 days. 
Over a dose range of 40 to 140 mg cisplatin/m2 given as a bolus injection or as infusions 
varying in length from 1 hour to 24 hours, from 10% to about 40% of the administered 
platinum is excreted in the urine in 24 hours. Over five days following administration of 
40 to 100 mg/m2 doses given as rapid, 2- to 3-hour, or 6- to 8-hour infusions, a mean of 
35% to 51% of the dosed platinum is excreted in the urine. Similar mean urinary 
recoveries of platinum of about 14% to 30% of the dose are found following five daily 
administrations of 20, 30, or 40 mg/m2/day. Only a small percentage of the administered 
platinum is excreted beyond 24 hours post-infusion and most of the platinum excreted in 
the urine in 24 hours is excreted within the first few hours. Platinum-containing species 
excreted in the urine are the same as those found following the incubation of cisplatin 
with urine from healthy subjects, except that the proportions are different. 
The parent compound, cisplatin, is excreted in the urine and accounts for 13% to 17% of 
the dose excreted within one hour after administration of 50 mg/m2. The mean renal 
clearance of cisplatin exceeds creatinine clearance and is 62 and 50 mL/min/m2 following 
administration of 100 mg/m2 as 2-hour or 6- to 7-hour infusions, respectively. 
The renal clearance of free (ultrafilterable) platinum also exceeds the glomerular 
filtration rate indicating that cisplatin or other platinum-containing molecules are actively 
secreted by the kidneys. The renal clearance of free platinum is nonlinear and variable 
and is dependent on dose, urine flow rate, and individual variability in the extent of active 
secretion and possible tubular reabsorption.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 109
There is a potential for accumulation of ultrafilterable platinum plasma concentrations 
whenever cisplatin is administered on a daily basis but not when dosed on an intermittent 
basis.
No significant relationships exist between the renal clearance of either free platinum or 
cisplatin and creatinine clearance. 
Although small amounts of platinum are present in the bile and large intestine after 
administration of cisplatin, the fecal excretion of platinum appears to be insignificant. 
INDICATIONS AND USAGE 
PLATINOL (cisplatin for injection, USP) is indicated as therapy to be employed as 
follows: 
Metastatic Testicular Tumors 
In established combination therapy with other approved chemotherapeutic agents in patients with metastatic testicular tumors w ho have already received appropriate surgical 
and/or radiotherapeutic procedures. 
Metastatic Ovarian Tumors 
In established combination therapy with other approved chemotherapeutic agents in patients with metastatic ovarian tumors who have already received appropriate surgical 
and/or radiotherapeutic procedures. An established combination consists of PLATINOL 
and cyclophosphamide. PLATINOL, as a single agent, is indicated as secondary therapy 
in patients with metastatic ovarian tumors refractory to standard chemotherapy who have 
not previously received PLATINOL therapy. 
Advanced Bladder Cancer 
PLATINOL is indicated as a single agent for patients with transitional cell bladder cancer which is no longer amenable to local treatments, such as surgery and/or radiotherapy. 
CONTRAINDICATIONS 
PLATINOL is contraindicated in patients with preexisting renal impairment. PLATINOL 
should not be employed in myelosuppressed patients, or in patients with hearing 
impairment.

Reference ID: 3006561 Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 110
PLATINOL is contraindicated in patients with a history of allergic reactions to 
PLATINOL or other platinum-containing compounds. 
WARNINGS
PLATINOL (cisplatin for injection, USP) produces cumulative nephrotoxicity which is 
potentiated by aminoglycoside antibiotics. The serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen 
(BUN), creatinine clearance, and magnesium, sodium, potassium, and calcium levels 
should be measured prior to initiating therapy, and prior to each subsequent course. At 
the recommended dosage, PLATINOL should not be given more frequently than once 
every 3 to 4 weeks (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Elderly patients may be more 
susceptible to nephrotoxicity (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use ).
There are reports of severe neuropathies in patients in whom regimens are employed 
using higher doses of PLATINOL or greater dose frequencies than those recommended. 
These neuropathies may be irreversible and are seen as paresthesias in a stocking-glove 
distribution, areflexia, and loss of proprioception and vibratory sensation. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to peripheral neuropathy (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric 
Use).
Loss of motor function has also been reported. 
Anaphylactic-like reactions to PLATINOL have been reported. These reactions have 
occurred within minutes of administration to patients with prior exposure to PLATINOL, 
and have been alleviated by administration of epinephrine, corticosteroids, and 
antihistamines. 
Since ototoxicity of PLATINOL is cumulative, audiometric testing should be performed 
prior to initiating therapy and prior to each subsequent dose of drug (see ADVERSE 
REACTIONS ).
PLATINOL can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. PLATINOL 
is mutagenic in bacteria and produces chromosome aberrations in animal cells in tissue 
culture. In mice PLATINOL is teratogenic and embryotoxic. If this drug is used during 
pregnancy or if the patient becomes pregnant while taking this drug, the patient should be 
apprised of the potential hazard to the fetus. Patients should be advised to avoid

The carcinogenic effect of PLATINOL was studied in BD IX rats. PLATINOL was 
administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) to 50 BD IX rats for 3 weeks, 3 X 1 mg/kg body 
weight per week. Four hundred and fifty-five days after the first application, 33 animals 
died, 13 of them related to malignancies: 12 leukemias and 1 renal fibrosarcoma. 
The development of acute leukemia coincident with the use of PLATINOL has been 
reported. In these reports, PLATINOL was generally given in combination with other 
leukemogenic agents. 
Injection site reactions may occur during the administration of PLATINOL (see 
ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Given the possibility of extravasation, it is recommended to 
closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration. A specific treatment for extravasation reactions is unknown at this time. 
PRECAUTIONS
Peripheral blood counts should be monitored weekly. Liver function should be monitored 
periodically. Neurologic examination should also be performed regularly (see ADVERSE REACTIONS ).
Drug Interactions 
Plasma levels of anticonvulsant agents may become subtherapeutic during cisplatin 
therapy.
In a randomized trial in advanced ovarian cancer, response duration was adversely 
affected when pyridoxine was used in combination with altretamine 
(hexamethylmelamine) and PLATINOL.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 112
Pediatric Use 
Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. 
Geriatric Use 
Insufficient data are available from clinical trials  of cisplatin in the treatment of 
metastatic testicular tumors or advanced bladder cancer to determine whether elderly 
patients respond differently than younger patients. In four clinical trials of combination 
chemotherapy for advanced ovarian carcinoma, 1484 patients received cisplatin either in 
combination with cyclophosphamide or paclitaxel. Of these, 426 (29%) were older than 65 years. In these trials, age was not found to be a prognostic factor for survival. 
However, in a later secondary analysis for one of these trials, elderly patients were found 
to have shorter survival compared with younger patients. In all four trials, elderly patients 
experienced more severe neutropenia than younger patients. Higher incidences of severe 
thrombocytopenia and leukopenia were also seen in elderly compared with younger 
patients, although not in all cisplatin-containing treatment arms. In the two trials where 
nonhematologic toxicity was evaluated according to age, elderly patients had a 
numerically higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy than younger patients. Other 
reported clinical experience suggests that elderly patients may be more susceptible to 
myelosuppression, infectious complications, and nephrotoxicity than younger patients.
Cisplatin is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney and is contraindicated in 
patients with preexisting renal impairment. Because elderly patients are more likely to 
have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and renal function 
should be monitored. 
ADVERSE REACTIONS 
Nephrotoxicity 
Dose-related and cumulative renal insufficiency, including acute renal failure, is the 
major dose-limiting toxicity of PLATINOL. Renal toxicity has been noted in 28% to 36% 
of patients treated with a single dose of 50 mg/m2. It is first noted during the second week 
after a dose and is manifested by elevations in BUN and creatinine, serum uric acid 
and/or a decrease in creatinine clearance. Renal toxicity becomes more prolonged and 
severe with repeated courses of the drug. Renal function must return to normal 
7
Reference ID: 3006561 Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 113
before another dose of PLATINOL can be given. Elderly patients may be more 
susceptible to nephrotoxicity (see  PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use ).
Impairment of renal function has been associated with renal tubular damage. The administration of PLATINOL using a 6- to 8-hour infusion with intravenous hydration, 
and mannitol has been used to reduce nephrotoxicity. However, renal toxicity still can 
occur after utilization of these procedures. 
Ototoxicity 
Ototoxicity has been observed in up to 31% of patients treated with a single dose of 
PLATINOL 50 mg/m2, and is manifested by tinnitus and/or hearing loss in the high 
frequency range (4000 to 8000 Hz). Decreased ability to hear normal conversational 
tones may occur. Deafness after the initial dose of PLATINOL has been reported. 
Ototoxic effects may be more severe in children receiving PLATINOL. Hearing loss can be unilateral or bilateral and tends to become more frequent and severe with repeated 
doses. Ototoxicity may be enhanced with prior or simultaneous cranial irradiation. It is 
unclear whether PLATINOL-induced ototoxicity is reversible. Ototoxic effects may be 
related to the peak plasma concentration of PLATINOL. Careful monitoring of 
audiometry should be performed prior to initiation of therapy and prior to subsequent 
doses of PLATINOL. 
Vestibular toxicity has also been reported. 
Ototoxicity may become more severe in patients being treated with other drugs with 
nephrotoxic potential. 
Hematologic
Myelosuppression occurs in 25% to 30% of patients treated with PLATINOL. The nadirs 
in circulating platelets and leukocytes occur between days 18 to 23 (range 7.5 to 45) with 
most patients recovering by day 39 (range 13 to 62). Leukopenia and thrombocytopenia 
are more pronounced at higher doses (>50 mg/m2). Anemia (decrease of 2 g 
hemoglobin/100 mL) occurs at approximately the same frequency and with the same 
timing as leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Fever and infection have also been reported 
in patients with neutropenia. Potential fatalities due to infection (secondary to 
myelosuppression) have been reported. Elderly patients may be more susceptible to 
myelosuppression (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use ).

CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 114
In addition to anemia secondary to myelosuppression, a Coombs’ positive hemolytic 
anemia has been reported. In the presence of cisplatin hemolytic anemia, a further course 
of treatment may be accompanied by increased hemolysis and this risk should be 
weighed by the treating physician. 
The development of acute leukemia coincident with the use of PLATINOL has been 
reported. In these reports, PLATINOL was generally given in combination with other 
leukemogenic agents. 
Gastrointestinal
Marked nausea and vomiting occur in almost all patients treated with PLATINOL, and 
may be so severe that the drug must be discontinued. Nausea and vomiting may begin 
within 1 to 4 hours after treatment and last up to 24 hours. Various degrees of vomiting, 
nausea and/or anorexia may persist for up to 1 week after treatment. 
Delayed nausea and vomiting (begins or persists 24 hours or more after chemotherapy) 
has occurred in patients attaining complete emetic control on the day of PLATINOL therapy.
Diarrhea has also been reported. 
OTHER TOXICITIES 
Vascular toxicities coincident with the use of PLATINOL in combination with other 
antineoplastic agents have been reported. The events are clinically heterogeneous and 
may include myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, thrombotic 
microangiopathy (hemolytic-uremic syndrome [HUS]), or cerebral arteritis. Various 
mechanisms have been proposed for these vascular complications. There are also reports 
of Raynaud’s phenomenon occurring in patients treated with the combination of 
bleomycin, vinblastine with or without PLATINOL. It has been suggested that 
hypomagnesemia developing coincident with the use of PLATINOL may be an added, 
although not essential, factor associated with this event. However, it is currently 
unknown if the cause of Raynaud’s phenomenon in these cases is the disease, underlying 
vascular compromise, bleomycin, vinblastine, hypomagnesemia, or a combination of any 
of these factors.

Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 115
Serum Electrolyte Disturbances 
Hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia, hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypophosphatemia 
have been reported to occur in patients treated with PLATINOL and are probably related 
to renal tubular damage. Tetany has been reported in those patients with hypocalcemia 
and hypomagnesemia. Generally, normal serum electrolyte levels are restored by 
administering supplemental electrolytes and discontinuing PLATINOL. 
Inappropriate antidiuretic hormone syndrome has also been reported. 
Hyperuricemia 
Hyperuricemia has been reported to occur at approximately the same frequency as the 
increases in BUN and serum creatinine. 
It is more pronounced after doses greater than 50 mg/m2, and peak levels of uric acid 
generally occur between 3 to 5 days after the dose. Allopurinol therapy for hyperuricemia 
effectively reduces uric acid levels. 
Neurotoxicity 
SeeWARNINGS .
Neurotoxicity, usually characterized by peripheral neuropathies, has been reported. The neuropathies usually occur after prolonged therapy (4 to 7 months); however, neurologic 
symptoms have been reported to occur after a single dose. Although symptoms and signs 
of PLATINOL neuropathy usually develop during treatment, symptoms of neuropathy may begin 3 to 8 weeks after the last dose of PLATINOL. PLATINOL therapy should be 
discontinued when the symptoms are first observed. The neuropathy, however, may 
progress further even after stopping treatment. Preliminary evidence suggests peripheral 
neuropathy may be irreversible in some patients. Elderly patients may be more 
susceptible to peripheral neuropathy (see PRECAUTIONS: Geriatric Use ).
Lhermitte’s sign, dorsal column myelopathy, and autonomic neuropathy have also been reported.
Loss of taste, seizures, leukoencephalopathy, and reversible posterior 
leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have also been reported.

CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 116
Muscle cramps, defined as localized, painful, involuntary skeletal muscle contractions of 
sudden onset and short duration, have been reported and were usually associated in 
patients receiving a relatively high cumulative dose of PLATINOL and with a relatively 
advanced symptomatic stage of peripheral neuropathy. 
Ocular Toxicity 
Optic neuritis, papilledema, and cerebral blindness have been reported in patients 
receiving standard recommended doses of PLATINOL. Improvement and/or total 
recovery usually occurs after discontinuing PLATINOL. Steroids with or without 
mannitol have been used; however, efficacy has not been established. 
Blurred vision and altered color perception have been reported after the use of regimens 
with higher doses of PLATINOL or greater dose frequencies than recommended in the 
package insert. The altered color perception manifests as a loss of color discrimination, 
particularly in the blue-yellow axis. The only finding on funduscopic exam is irregular 
retinal pigmentation of the macular area. 
Anaphylactic-Like Reactions 
Anaphylactic-like reactions have been reported in patients previously exposed to PLATINOL. The reactions consist of facial edema, wheezing, tachycardia, and 
hypotension within a few minutes of drug administration. Reactions may be controlled by 
intravenous epinephrine with corticosteroids and/or antihistamines as indicated. Patients 
receiving PLATINOL should be observed carefully for possible anaphylactic-like 
reactions and supportive equipment and medication should be available to treat such a 
complication. 
Hepatotoxicity
Transient elevations of liver enzymes, especially SGOT, as well as bilirubin, have been reported to be associated with PLATINOL administration at the recommended doses. 
Other Events 
Cardiac abnormalities, hiccups, elevated serum amylase, rash, alopecia, malaise, asthenia, 
and dehydration have been reported. 
Local soft tissue toxicity has been reported following extravasation of PLATINOL. 
Severity of the local tissue toxicity appears to be related to the concentration of the 
11
Reference ID: 3006561 Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 117
PLATINOL solution. Infusion of solutions with a PLATINOL concentration greater than 
0.5 mg/mL may result in tissue cellulitis, fibrosis, necrosis, pain, edema, and erythema. 
OVERDOSAGE 
Caution should be exercised to prevent inadvertent overdosage with PLATINOL. 
Acute overdosage with this drug may result in kidney failure, liver failure, deafness, 
ocular toxicity (including detachment of the retina), significant myelosuppression, 
intractable nausea and vomiting and/or neuritis. In addition, death can occur following 
overdosage.
No proven antidotes have been established for PLATINOL overdosage. Hemodialysis, 
even when initiated four hours after the overdosage, appears to have little effect on 
removing platinum from the body because of PLATINOL’s rapid and high degree of 
protein binding. Management of overdosage should include general supportive measures 
to sustain the patient through any period of toxicity that may occur. 
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION 
PLATINOL is administered by slow intravenous infusion. PLATINOL SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN BY RAPID INTRAVENOUS INJECTION. 
Note: Needles or intravenous sets containing aluminum parts that may come in 
contact with PLATINOL should not be used for preparation or administration. 
Aluminum reacts with PLATINOL, causing precipitate formation and a loss of 
potency.
Metastatic Testicular Tumors 
The usual PLATINOL dose for the treatment of testicular cancer in combination with 
other approved chemotherapeutic agents is 20 mg/m2 IV daily for 5 days per cycle. 
Metastatic Ovarian Tumors 
The usual PLATINOL dose for the treatment of metastatic ovarian tumors in combination 
with cyclophosphamide is 75 to 100 mg/m2 IV per cycle once every 4 weeks (DAY 1). 
The dose of cyclophosphamide when used in combination with PLATINOL is 600 mg/m
2 IV once every 4 weeks (DAY 1). 
12

CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 118
For directions for the administration of cyclophosphamide, refer to the cyclophosphamide 
package insert. 
In combination therapy, PLATINOL and cyclophosphamide are administered 
sequentially.
As a single agent, PLATINOL should be administered at a dose of 100 mg/m2 IV per 
cycle once every 4 weeks. 
Advanced Bladder Cancer 
PLATINOL should be administered as a single agent at a dose of 50 to 70 mg/m2 IV per 
cycle once every 3 to 4 weeks depending on the extent of prior exposure to radiation 
therapy and/or prior chemotherapy. For heavily pretreated patients an initial dose of 
50 mg/m2 per cycle repeated every 4 weeks is recommended. 
All Patients 
Pretreatment hydration with 1 to 2 liters of fluid infused for 8 to 12 hours prior to a 
PLATINOL dose is recommended. The drug is then diluted in 2 liters of 5% Dextrose in 
1/2 or 1/3 normal saline containing 37.5 g of mannitol, and infused over a 6- to 8-hour 
period. If diluted solution is not to be used within 6 hours, protect solution from light. 
Adequate hydration and urinary output must be maintained during the following 24 hours.
A repeat course of PLATINOL should not be given until the serum creatinine is below 
1.5 mg/100 mL, and/or the BUN is below 25 mg/100 mL. A repeat course should not be 
given until circulating blood elements are at an acceptable level (platelets t100,000/mm
3,
WBC t4000/mm3). Subsequent doses of PLATINOL should not be given until an 
audiometric analysis indicates that auditory acuity is within normal limits. 
PREPARATION OF INTRAVENOUS SOLUTIONS 
Preparation Precautions 
Caution should be exercised in handling the powder and preparing the solution of 
cisplatin. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be 
utilized. Several guidelines on this subject have been published.1-4 To minimize the risk

of dermal exposure, always wear impervious gloves when handling vials and IV sets 
containing PLATINOL for injection. 
Skin reactions associated with accidental exposure to cisplatin may occur. The use of 
gloves is recommended. If PLATINOL powder or PLATINOL solution contacts the skin 
or mucosa, immediately and thoroughly wash the skin with soap and water and flush the 
mucosa with water. More information is available in the references listed below. 
Instructions for Preparation 
The 50 mg vials should be reconstituted with 50 mL of Sterile Water for Injection, USP. 
Each mL of the resulting solution will contain 1 mg of PLATINOL. 
Reconstitution as recommended results in a clear, colorless to slight yellow solution. 
The reconstituted solution should be used intravenously only and should be administered 
by IV infusion over a 6- to 8-hour period (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ).
Parenteral drug products should be inspected  visually for particulate matter and 
discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit. 
NOTE TO PHARMACIST: Exercise caution to  prevent inadvertent PLATINOL 
overdosage. Please call prescriber if dose is greater than 100 mg/m2 per cycle. Aluminum 
and flip-off seal of vial have been imprinted with the following statement: 
CALL DR. IF DOSE>100 MG/M2/CYCLE.
STABILITY 
Unopened vials of dry powder are stable for the lot life indicated on the package when 
stored at room temperature (25q C, 77q F). 
The reconstituted solution is stable for 20 hours at room temperature (25 q C, 77q F). 
Solution removed from the amber vial should be protected from light if it is not to be 
used within six hours. 
Important Note:  Once reconstituted, the solution should be kept at room temperature 
(25q C, 77q F). If the reconstituted solution is refrigerated a precipitate will form.

Baxter Healthcare Corporation
DESCRIPTION
Cyclophosphamide for Injection, USP is a sterile white powder containing cyclophosphamide monohydrate. Cyclophosphamide is a
synthetic antineoplastic drug chemically related to the nitrogen mustards. Cyclophosphamide is a white crystalline powder with the
molecular formula C 7H15CI2N2O2P•H 2O and a molecular weight of 279.1. The chemical name for cyclophosphamide is 2-[bis(2-
chloroethyl)amino]tetrahydro-2H-1,3,2-oxazaphosphorine 2-oxide monohydrate. Cyclophosphamide is soluble in water, saline, orethanol and has the following structural formula:
CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY
Cyclophosphamide is biotransformed principally in the liver to active alkylating metabolites by a mixed function microsomal oxi dase
system. These metabolites interfere with the growth of susceptible rapidly proliferating malignant cells. The mechanism of action is
thought to involve cross-linking of tumor cell DNA.Cyclophosphamide is well absorbed after oral administration with a bioavailability greater than 75%. The unchanged drug has anelimination half-life of 3 to 12 hours. It is eliminated primarily in the form of metabolites, but from 5 to 25% of the dose is excreted inurine as unchanged drug. Several cytotoxic and noncytotoxic metabolites have been identified in urine and in plasma. Concentrat ions
of metabolites reach a maximum in plasma 2 to 3 hours after an intravenous dose. Plasma protein binding of unchanged drug is lowbut some metabolites are bound to an extent greater than 60%. It has not been demonstrated that any single metabolite is respon sible
for either the therapeutic or toxic effects of cyclophosphamide. Although elevated levels of metabolites of cyclophosphamide ha ve
been observed in patients with renal failure, increased clinical toxicity in such patients has not been demonstrated.
INDICATIONS AND USAGE
Malignant Diseases
Cyclophosphamide, although effective alone in susceptible malignancies, is more frequently used concurrently or sequentially wi th
other antineoplastic drugs. The following malignancies are often susceptible to cyclophosphamide treatment:
1. Malignant lymphomas (Stages III and IV of the Ann Arbor staging system), Hodgkin’s disease, lymphocytic lymphoma (nodular
or diffuse), mixed-cell type lymphoma, histiocytic lymphoma, Burkitt’s lymphoma.
2. Multiple myeloma.
3. Leukemias: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia, chronic granulocytic leukemia (it is usually ineffective in acute blastic crisis), a cute
myelogenous and monocytic leukemia, acute lymphoblastic (stem-cell) leukemia in children (cyclophosphamide given during
remission is effective in prolonging its duration).
4. Mycosis fungoides (advanced disease).
5. Neuroblastoma (disseminated disease).6. Adenocarcinoma of the ovary.7. Retinoblastoma.8. Carcinoma of the breast.
Nonmalignant Disease Biopsy Proven “Minimal Change” Nephrotic Syndrome in Children:
Cyclophosphamide is useful in carefully selected cases of biopsy proven “minimal change” nephrotic syndrome in children but should
not be used as primary therapy. In children whose disease fails to respond adequately to appropriate adrenocorticosteroid thera py or
in whom the adrenocorticosteroid therapy produces or threatens to produce intolerable side effects, cyclophosphamide may induce  a
remission. Cyclophosphamide is not indicated for the nephrotic syndrome in adults or for any other renal disease.Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 123

Continued use of cyclophosphamide is contraindicated in patients with severely depressed bone marrow function. Cyclophosphamide
is contraindicated in patients who have demonstrated a previous hypersensitivity to it. See WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONSsections.
WARNINGS
Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, and Impairment of Fertility
Second malignancies have developed in some patients treated with cyclophosphamide used alone or in association with other
antineoplastic drugs and/or modalities. Most frequently, they have been urinary bladder, myeloproliferative, or lymphoprolifera tive
malignancies. Second malignancies most frequently were detected in patients treated for primary myeloproliferative orlymphoproliferative malignancies or nonmalignant disease in which immune processes are believed to be involved pathologically.In some cases, the second malignancy developed several years after cyclophosphamide treatment had been discontinued. In a singlebreast cancer trial utilizing two to four times the standard dose of cyclophosphamide in conjunction with doxorubicin a small n umber
of cases of secondary acute myeloid leukemia occurred within two years of treatment initiation. Urinary bladder malignanciesgenerally have occurred in patients who previously had hemorrhagic cystitis. In patients treated with cyclophosphamide-containingregimens for a variety of solid tumors, isolated case reports of secondary malignancies have been published. One case of carcin oma
of the renal pelvis was reported in a patient receiving long-term cyclophosphamide therapy for cerebral vasculitis. The possibility ofcyclophosphamide-induced malignancy should be considered in any benefit-to-risk assessment for use of the drug.Cyclophosphamide can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman and such abnormalities have been reportedfollowing cyclophosphamide therapy in pregnant women. Abnormalities were found in two infants and a six-month old fetus bornto women treated with cyclophosphamide. Ectrodactylia was found in two of the three cases. Normal infants have also been born towomen treated with cyclophosphamide during pregnancy, including the first trimester. If this drug is used during pregnancy, or if thepatient becomes pregnant while taking (receiving) this drug, the patient should be apprised of the potential hazard to the fetu s. Women
of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant.Cyclophosphamide interferes with oogenesis and spermatogenesis. It may cause sterility in both sexes. Development of sterilityappears to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide, duration of therapy, and the state of gonadal function at the time of treatm ent.
Cyclophosphamide-induced sterility may be irreversible in some patients.Amenorrhea associated with decreased estrogen and increased gonadotropin secretion develops in a significant proportion of womentreated with cyclophosphamide. Affected patients generally resume regular menses within a few months after cessation of therapy.Girls treated with cyclophosphamide during prepubescence generally develop secondary sexual characteristics normally and haveregular menses. Ovarian fibrosis with apparently complete loss of germ cells after prolonged cyclophosphamide treatment in lateprepubescence has been reported. Girls treated with cyclophosphamide during prepubescence subsequently have conceived.Men treated with cyclophosphamide may develop oligospermia or azoospermia associated with increased gonadotropin but normaltestosterone secretion. Sexual potency and libido are unimpaired in these patients. Boys treated with cyclophosphamide duringprepubescence develop secondary sexual characteristics normally, but may have oligospermia or azoospermia and increasedgonadotropin secretion. Some degree of testicular atrophy may occur. Cyclophosphamide-induced azoospermia is reversible in somepatients, though the reversibility may not occur for several years after cessation of therapy. Men temporarily rendered sterile bycyclophosphamide have subsequently fathered normal children.
Urinary System
Hemorrhagic cystitis may develop in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Rarely, this condition can be severe and even fatal .
Fibrosis of the urinary bladder, sometimes extensive, also may develop with or without accompanying cystitis. Atypical urinary
bladder epithelial cells may appear in the urine. These adverse effects appear to depend on the dose of cyclophosphamide and th e
duration of therapy. Such bladder injury is thought to be due to cyclophosphamide metabolites excreted in the urine. Forced fluidintake helps to assure an ample output of urine, necessitates frequent voiding, and reduces the time the drug remains in the bladder.This helps to prevent cystitis. Hematuria usually resolves in a few days after cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped, but it maypersist. Medical and/or surgical supportive treatment may be required, rarely, to treat protracted cases of severe hemorrhagic cystitis.
It is usually necessary to discontinue cyclophosphamide therapy in instances of severe hemorrhagic cystitis.
Cardiac Toxicity
Although a few instances of cardiac dysfunction have been reported following use of recommended doses of cyclophosphamide,
no causal relationship has been established. Acute cardiac toxicity has been reported with doses as low as 2.4 g/m
2 to as high as 26
g/m2, usually as a portion of an intensive antineoplastic multi-drug regimen or in conjunction with transplantation procedures. In a
few instances with high doses of cyclophosphamide, severe, and sometimes fatal, congestive heart failure has occurred after the  first
cyclophosphamide dose. Histopathologic examination has primarily shown hemorrhagic myocarditis. Hemopericardium has occurred
secondary to hemorrhagic myocarditis and myocardial necrosis. Pericarditis has been reported independent of any hemopericardium .
No residual cardiac abnormalities, as evidenced by electrocardiogram or echocardiogram appear to be present in patients survivi ng
episodes of apparent cardiac toxicity associated with high doses of cyclophosphamide.Cyclophosphamide has been reported to potentiate doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity.Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 124
page 3 of 9Infections
Treatment with cyclophosphamide may cause significant suppression of immune responses. Serious, sometimes fatal, infections may
develop in severely immunosuppressed patients. Cyclophosphamide treatment may not be indicated, or should be interrupted, or th e
dose reduced, in patients who have or who develop viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan, or helminthic infections.
Other
Anaphylactic reactions have been reported; death has also been reported in association with this event. Possible cross-sensitiv ity with
other alkylating agents has been reported.
PRECAUTIONS
General
Special attention to the possible development of toxicity should be exercised in patients being treated with cyclophosphamide i f any of
the following conditions are present.
1. Leukopenia
2. Thrombocytopenia3. Tumor cell infiltration of bone marrow4. Previous X-ray therapy5. Previous therapy with other cytotoxic agents6. Impaired hepatic function7. Impaired renal function
Laboratory Tests
During treatment, the patient’s hematologic profile (particularly neutrophils and platelets) should be monitored regularly to d etermine
the degree of hematopoietic suppression. Urine should also be examined regularly for red cells which may precede hemorrhagic
cystitis.
Drug Interactions
The rate of metabolism and the leukopenic activity of cyclophosphamide reportedly are increased by chronic administration of hi gh
doses of phenobarbital.
The physician should be alert for possible combined drug actions, desirable or undesirable, involving cyclophosphamide even thoughcyclophosphamide has been used successfully concurrently with other drugs, including other cytotoxic drugs.Cyclophosphamide treatment, which causes a marked and persistent inhibition of cholinesterase activity, potentiates the effect of
succinylcholine chloride.If a patient has been treated with cyclophosphamide within 10 days of general anesthesia, the anesthesiologist should be alerted.
Adrenalectomy
Since cyclophosphamide has been reported to be more toxic in adrenalectomized dogs, adjustment of the doses of both replacement
steroids and cyclophosphamide may be necessary for the adrenalectomized patient.
Wound Healing
Cyclophosphamide may interfere with normal wound healing.

Pregnancy
Pregnancy Category D—See WARNINGS section.
Nursing Mothers
Cyclophosphamide is excreted in breast milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse reactions and the potential for
tumorigenicity shown for cyclophosphamide in humans, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing or to discontinuethe drug, taking into account the importance of the drug to the mother.Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 125
page 4 of 9Pediatric Use
The safety profile of cyclophosphamide in pediatric patients is similar to that of the adult population (see ADVERSE REACTIONS
section).
Geriatric Use
Insufficient data from clinical studies of cyclophosphamide for malignant lymphoma, multiple myeloma, leukemia, mycosis
fungoides, neuroblastoma, retinoblastoma, and breast carcinoma are available for patients 65 years of age and older to determin e
whether they respond differently than younger patients. In two clinical trials in which cyclophosphamide was compared withpaclitaxel, each in combination with cisplatin, for the treatment of advanced ovarian carcinoma, 154 (28%) of 552 patients whoreceived cyclophosphamide plus cisplatin were 65 years or older. Subset analyses (<65 versus >65 years) from these trials, publishedreports of clinical trials of cyclophosphamide-containing regimens in breast cancer and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and postmarketingexperience suggest that elderly patients may be more susceptible to cyclophosphamide toxicities. In general, dose selection for anelderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range and adjusting as necessary based on patientresponse (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION: Treatment of Malignant Diseases).
ADVERSE REACTIONS
Information on adverse reactions associated with the use of cyclophosphamide is arranged according to body system affected or type
of reaction. The adverse reactions are listed in order of decreasing incidence. The most serious adverse reactions are describe d in the
WARNINGS section.
Reproductive System
See WARNINGS section for information on impairment of fertility.
Digestive System
Nausea and vomiting commonly occur with cyclophosphamide therapy. Anorexia and, less frequently, abdominal discomfort or pain
and diarrhea may occur. There are isolated reports of hemorrhagic colitis, oral mucosal ulceration and jaundice occurring durin g
therapy. These adverse drug effects generally remit when cyclophosphamide treatment is stopped.
Skin and Its Structures
Alopecia occurs commonly in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. The hair can be expected to grow back after treatment with the
drug or even during continued drug treatment, though it may be different in texture or color. Skin rash occurs occasionally in patients
receiving the drug. Pigmentation of the skin and changes in nails can occur. Very rare reports of Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic
epidermal necrolysis have been received during postmarketing surveillance; due to the nature of spontaneous adverse event repor ting,
a definitive causal relationship to cyclophosphamide has not been established.
Hematopoietic System
Leukopenia occurs in patients treated with cyclophosphamide, is related to the dose of drug, and can be used as a dosage guide.
Leukopenia of less than 2000 cells/mm3 develops commonly in patients treated with an initial loading dose of the drug, and lessfrequently in patients maintained on smaller doses. The degree of neutropenia is particularly important because it correlates with areduction in resistance to infections. Fever without documented infection has been reported in neutropenic patients.Thrombocytopenia or anemia develop occasionally in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. These hematologic effects usually ca n
be reversed by reducing the drug dose or by interrupting treatment. Recovery from leukopenia usually begins in 7 to 10 days aftercessation of therapy.
Urinary System
See WARNINGS section for information on cystitis and urinary bladder fibrosis.
Hemorrhagic ureteritis and renal tubular necrosis have been reported to occur in patients treated with cyclophosphamide. Such lesionsusually resolve following cessation of therapy.
Infections
See WARNINGS section for information on reduced host resistance to infections.
Carcinogenesis
See WARNINGS section for information on carcinogenesis.
Respiratory System
Interstitial pneumonitis has been reported as part of the postmarketing experience. Interstitial pulmonary fibrosis has been reported in
patients receiving high doses of cyclophosphamide over a prolonged period.Protocol ADU-CL-02-v8Aduro Biotech, Inc. 
CRS-207 with Pemetrexed and Cisplatin 
Version 8, 08 March 2018 Page 126
page 5 of 9Other
Anaphylactic reactions have been reported; death has also been reported in association with this event. Possible cross-sensitiv ity
with other alkylating agents has been reported. SIADH (syndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion) has been reported with the use of
cyclophosphamide. Malaise and asthenia have been reported as part of the postmarketing experience.
OVERDOSAGE
No specific antidote for cyclophosphamide is known. Overdosage should be managed with supportive measures, including appropriate
treatment for any concurrent infection, myelosuppression, or cardiac toxicity should it occur.
DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION
Treatment of Malignant Diseases Adults and Children
When used as the only oncolytic drug therapy, the initial course of cyclophosphamide for patients with no hematologic deficienc y
usually consists of 40 to 50 mg/kg given intravenously in divided doses over a period of 2 to 5 days. Other intravenous regimens
include 10 to 15 mg/kg given every 7 to 10 days or 3 to 5 mg/kg twice weekly.Oral cyclophosphamide dosing is usually in the range of 1 to 5 mg/kg/day for both initial and maintenance dosing.Many other regimens of intravenous and oral cyclophosphamide have been reported. Dosages must be adjusted in accord withevidence of antitumor activity and/or leukopenia. The total leukocyte count is a good, objective guide for regulating dosage. T ransient
decreases in the total white blood cell count to 2000 cells/mm
3 (following short courses) or more persistent reduction to 3000 cells/
mm3 (with continuing therapy) are tolerated without serious risk of infection if there is no marked granulocytopenia.
When cyclophosphamide is included in combined cytotoxic regimens, it may be necessary to reduce the dose of cyclophosphamide aswell as that of the other drugs.Cyclophosphamide and its metabolites are dialyzable although there are probably quantitative differences depending upon the dia lysis
system being used. Patients with compromised renal function may show some measurable changes in pharmacokinetic parameters ofcyclophosphamide metabolism, but there is no consistent evidence indicating a need for cyclophosphamide dosage modification inpatients with renal function impairment.
Treatment of Nonmalignant Diseases Biopsy Proven “Minimal Change’’ Nephrotic Syndrome in Children
An oral dose of 2.5 to 3 mg/kg daily for a period of 60 to 90 days is recommended. In males, the incidence of oligospermia and
azoospermia increases if the duration of cyclophosphamide treatment exceeds 60 days. Treatment beyond 90 days increases theprobability of sterility. Adrenocorticosteroid therapy may be tapered and discontinued during the course of cyclophosphamide th erapy.
See PRECAUTIONS section concerning hematologic monitoring.
Preparation and Handling of Solutions
Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, wheneve r
solution and container permit.
Cyclophosphamide should be prepared for parenteral use by adding 0.9% sterile sodium chloride solution if injected directly.Cyclophosphamide should be prepared for parenteral use by infusion by adding Sterile Water for Injection, USP. Cyclophosphamide,constituted in water, is hypotonic and should not be injected directly. Add the diluent to the vial and shake it vigorously to dissolve. If
the powder fails to dissolve immediately and completely, it is advisable to allow the vial to stand for a few minutes. Use the quantity
of diluent shown below to constitute the product:

HOW SUPPLIED
Cyclophosphamide for Injection, USP contains cyclophosphamide monohydrate and is supplied in vials for single dose use.
NDC 10019-955-01 500 mg vial, carton of 1NDC 10019-956-01 1.0 g vial, carton of 1NDC 10019-957-01 2.0 g vial, carton of 1Store vials at or below 25°C (77°F) [see USP Controlled Room Temperature]. During transport or storage of cyclophosphamidevials, temperature influences can lead to melting of the active ingredient, cyclophosphamide. Vials containing melted substance canbe visually differentiated. Melted cyclophosphamide is a clear or yellowish viscous liquid usually found as a connected phase or indroplets in the affected vials. Do not use cyclophosphamide vials if there are signs of melting.Procedures for proper handling and disposal of anticancer drugs should be considered. Several guidelines on this subject have b een
published.
1-8 There is no general agreement that all of the procedures recommended in the guidelines are necessary or appropriate.

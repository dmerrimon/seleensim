3INTRODUCTION
3.1 Study Rationale and Purpose
The new contact lens in development is intended for the optical correction of refractive 
ametropia in persons with non- diseased ey es.
The purpose of this stud y is to obtain on -eye performance data to 
inform contact lens product 
development . The primary endpoint was selected to address the primary objective of the 
study . Procedures for measurement of these endpoints were selected based on common 
practice for these assessments. The design of this study  is justified based upon preclinical and 
clinical testing, as described within the I nvestigator’s Brochure. Biofinity  contact lenses were 
chosen as the control product because these lenses have the same wear modality  and 
replacement schedule.
 
 
 
3.2 Trial Objective
The primary  objective of this study  is to describe the clinical performance of an 
investigational silicone hy drogel contact lens over 30 day s of dail y wear.
3.3 Risk s and Benefits
Contact lenses may  offer improved peripheral visio n and the convenience of not wearing 
spectacles. Material properties and design characteristics of the contact lens in development 
are features consistent with successful contact lens wear .
Based upon non -
clinical testing and/or documented rationale for ap plicability  of test results 
to the I P, the new contact lens in development is assessed to be non -toxic and biocompatible 
for on -eye use. 
Biofinity  contact lenses are commercially  available for dail y wear use under a monthly  wear
modality ; further details onany known potential risks and benefits can be found in the 
package insert . 
A summary  of the known potential risks and benefits associated with the new contact lens in 
development can be found in the I nvestigator ’s Brochure. Risks are minimized by

compl iance with the eligibility  criteria and study  procedures, and through close supervision 
by a licensed clinician during exposure to the study  lenses. The potential harms associated 
with on- eye exposure to the new lens materials include toxicity  response, bl urred vision and 
ocular discomfort. In general, the risks with the new contact lens in development are 
anticipated to be similar to other marketed weekly /monthly  soft contact lenses.
The site personnel will educate subjects on proper hy giene and lens handling, and compliance 
with the use of contact lenses according to the protocol. Subjects should be instructed not to 
wear contact lenses while sleeping or swimming. The site personnel will also advise the 
subjects to remove contact lenses and return for prom pt follow -up of s ymptoms, such as 
ocular discomfort, foreign body  sensation, excessive tearing, vision changes, or hy peremia.
3.4 Subject Population
The study  population includes approximately  36 volunteer subjects to be enrolled at 
approximately  3 sites, with approximately  12 subjects enrolled per site. 
To account for potential screening failure and early discontinuation, approximately  
36subjects are expected to be enrolled to obtain a target of 32 completed subjects. 
Subjects must be screened according to the full list of inclusio n/exclusion criteria in Section 1
of this protocol. The study population will consist of subjects with normal eyes who are 
adapted, existing wearers of weekl y/monthly  soft contact lenses in both eyes, and require 
contact lens sphere power from -1.00 to - 6.00 D. 
Rescreening of subjects is allowed only  for the following criteria and under the following 
conditions:
INC01 –subject must be at least 18 y ears of age
EXC13 – participation in a clinical trial within the previous 7 day s or currently  
enrolled in another clinical trial
A protocol ame ndment potentially  changes eligibility  of previousl y screened and 
excluded subjects
A subject may  only be rescreened once and rescreening should take place within one week 
of the original screening date.

5.2 Unscheduled Visits
Any visit that occurs between regularl y scheduled visits is an Unscheduled V isit. I f a subject 
requires an Unscheduled V isit, he/she must be advised to return to the of fice wearing the 
study  lenses, if at all possible (unless he/she is experiencing a sign or s ymptom [as indicated 
in Section 3.3 Risks and Benefits]). During all unscheduled vi sits, the Investigator must 
conduct the following procedures: 
Collect AE and Device Deficiency  information
Assess and record changes in medical condition or concomitant medication 
Assess and record V As
Perform biomicroscop y (assessments with or without lenses, as possible)
In addition, all procedures for V isit 5 (Follow -up/Exit) should be completed (as possible). 
The Investigator may  perform additional procedures for proper diagnosis and treatment of the 
subject. The Investigator must document this information in the subject’ s case history  source 
documents.
If during an Unscheduled V isit the subject is discontinuing the study  lenses or discontinuing 
from the study , the Investigator must conduct Exit procedures according to T able 1- 1: 
Schedule of Study  Proc edures and Assessments, as possible.
5.3 Discontinued Subjects
Discontinued subjects are those who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study  after signing 
the informed consent, including screen failures. Subjects may discontinue from the study  at 
any time for a ny reason. Subjects may  also be discontinued from the study at any  time if, in 
the opinion of the Investigator , their continued participation poses a risk to their health. 
Discontinued subjects will not be replaced (ie, their subject numbers will not be 
re-assigned/re -used).

7ADVERSE EVENTS AND DEVICE DEFICIENCIES
Terms and Definitions
Adverse Event (AE) Any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury , or 
untoward clinical signs (including abnormal laboratory  findings) in 
subjects, users or other persons, whether or not related to the 
investigational medical device (test product ). Note: For s ubjects, 
this definition includes events r elated to the test product , the 
contr ol product , or the pr ocedur es involved. For users or other 
persons, this definition is r estricted to events r elated to the test 
product .
Adverse Device 
Effect (ADE)AErelated to the use of an investigational medical device (test 
product ) or control pr oduct. Note: This definition includes AEs
resulting fr om insufficient or inadequate instructions for use, 
deployment, implantation, installation, or operation; any 
malfunc tion; and use err or or intentional misuse of the test pr oduct 
or contr ol product .
Anticipated Serious 
Adverse Device 
Effect (ASADE)Serious ADE which b y its nature, incidence, severity  or outcome 
has been identified in the risk management file.
Device Deficiency Inadequacy  of a medical device with respect to its identity , quality , 
durability , reliability , safety , or performance. Note: This definition 
includes malfunctions, use err ors, and inadequate labeling.
Malfunction Failure of a medical device to meet its performance specifications 
or otherwise perform as intended. Performance specifications 
include all claims made in the labeling of the device. The intended

performance of the device refers to the intended use for whi ch the 
device is labeled or marketed.
Non-serious Adverse 
EventAEthat does not meet the criteria for a nSAE .
Serious Adverse 
Event (SAE)AEthat led to an y of the following:
Death.
A serious deterioration in the health of the subject that either 
result ed in:
a)a life -threatening illness or injury .
Note: Life -threatening means that the individual was at 
immediate risk of death fr om the event as it occurr ed, ie, it 
does not include an event which hypothetically might have 
caused death had it occurr ed in a more sever e form.
b)any potentially  sight -threatening event or permanent 
impairment to a body  structure or a body  function.
c)in-patient hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization.
Note: Planned hospitalization for a pr e-existing condition, 
without serious deterioration in health, is not consider ed 
anSAE. In general, hospitalization signifies that the 
individual r emained at the hospital or emer gency war d for 
observation and/or tr eatment (usually involving an 
overnight stay) that would not have been appr opria
te in the 
physician's office or an out -patient setting. Complications 
that occur during hospi talization ar e adverse events. If a 
complication pr olongs hospitalization or fulfills any other 
serious criteria, the event is serio us. When in doubt as to 
whether “hospitalization ” occurr ed, the event should be 
consider ed serious.
d)a medical or surgical intervention to prevent a) or b). 
e)any indirect harm as a consequence of incorrect diagnostic 
test results when used within manufacturer’ s instructions 
for use.
Fetal distress, fetal death, or a congenital abnormality  or birth 
defect.

Permanent vision loss as defined b y loss of 2 or more lines of BCV A from enrollment 
visit that fails to resolve
Uveitis (anterior , intermediate, or posterior)
Corneal abrasion affecting ≥50% of corneal surface area
Significant Non -Serious Adverse Events
A significant non -serious AE is a s ymptomatic, device -related, non- sight threatening AEthat 
warrants discontinuation of any contact lens wear for greater than or equal to 2 weeks. In 
addition, the I nvestigator must report any  occurrence of the following a s a Significant 
Non-Serious AE:
Peripheral non -progressive non- infectious ulcers
All sy mptomatic corneal infiltrative events
Corneal staining score greater than or equal to Grade 3 
Temporary  vision loss as defined by  loss of 2 or more lines of BCV A from e nrollment 
visit that persists for 2 or more weeks
Neovascularization score greater than or equal to G rade 2 
The above events ar e based upon the categories pr ovided in the ISO 1 1980 and the US FDA  
Premarket Notification ( 510(k) )Guidance Document for Daily Wear Contact Lenses and 
Contact Lens Car e Products. 
Device Deficiencies
A device deficiency  is inadequacy  of a medical device with respect to its identity , quality , 
durability , reliability , safety , or performance. A device deficiency  may  or may  not be 
associated with patient harm (ie, ADE or SADE); however , not all ADEs or SADEs are due 
to a device deficiency . The Investigator should determine the applicable category listed in the 
Device Deficiency  eCRF for the identified or suspect device deficiency  and report an y patient 
harm separately . Examples of device deficiencies include the following: 
Failure to meet product specifications (eg, incorrect lens power/diameter/base 
curve/color)

Lens/solution cloud y
Lens surface/edge defect 
Torn lens during handling /in pack
Packaging deficit (eg, mislabeled product, tampered seal, leaking bottle/container)
Suspect product contamination
Lack of performance
7.2 Monitoring for Adverse Events
At each visit, after the subject has had the opportunity  to spontaneousl y mention any 
problems, the Investigator should inquire about AEs by  asking the standard questions:
“Have you had an y health problems since your last study  visit? ”
“Have there been an y changes in the medicines you take since your last study  visit? ”
Additionally , changes in any protocol -specific parameters and/or questionnair es evaluated 
during the stud y are to be reviewed b y the Investigator . Any untoward (unfavorable and 
unintended) change in a protocol -specific parameter or questionnair e response that is 
clinically relevant, in the opinion of the I nvestigator , is to be reported as an AE. These 
clinically  relevant changes will be reported regardless of causality .
7.3 Procedures for Recording and Reporting
AEs are collected from the time of informed consent .Any pre -existing medical conditions or 
signs/sy mptoms present in a subject prior to the start of the study  (ie, before informed 
consent is signed) are not considered AEs in the study  and should be recorded in the Medical 
History  section of the eCRF .
In addition, tempo rary lens awareness or visual changes during the fitting process are not 
considered AEs if the Investigator assesses that the sy mptom(s) can reasonably  resolve within 
the anticipated adaptation period.
ADEs or SAEs are documented on the Serious Adverse Ev ent and Adverse Device 
Effect eCRF within 24 hours of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness . 
Device deficiencies are documented on the Device Deficiency eCRF within 24 hours 
of the Investigator ’s or site ’s awareness .

A printed cop y of the completed Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect 
and/or Device Deficiency eCRF must be included with product returns.
Additional relevant information after initial reporting must be entered into the eCRF as 
soon as the data become available.
Document an y chang es to concomitant medications on the appropriate eCRFs.
Document all relevant information from Discharge Summary , Autopsy  Report,
Certificate of Death ,etc, if applicable, in narrative section of the Serious Adverse 
Event and Adverse Device Effect eCRF .
Note: Should the EDC system become non -operational, the site must complete the 
appropriate paper Serious Adverse Event and Adverse Device Effect and/or Device Deficiency
Form. The completed form is emailed to the Study
 Sponsor at msus.safety@alcon.com
according to the timelines outlined above; however , the reported information must be entered 
into the EDC sy stem once it becomes operational.
Any AEs and device deficiencies for non- study  marketed devices/products (ie, RepleniSH )
will be considered and processed as spontaneous (following the postmarket vigilance 
procedures ) and should be communicated to the device’ s/product ’s manufacturer as per local 
requirements.
Study  Sponsor representatives may  be contacted for any  protocol related question.
Further , depending upon the nature of the AE or device deficiency  being reported, the Study  
Sponsor may  request copies of applicable portions of the subject’ s medical records. The 
Investigator must also report all AEs and device deficiencies that could have led to a SADE
according to the requirements of regulatory  authorities or I RB/IEC.
Intensity and Causality Assessments
Where appropriate, the Investigator must assess the intensity  (severit y) of the AE based upon 
medical judgment with consideration of an y subjective sym ptom(s), as defined below:
Intensity (Severity)
Mild AE is mild if the subject is aware of but can easil y tolerate the sign or 
symptom.
Moderate
An AE is moderate if the sign or s ymptom results in discomfort significant 
enough to cause interference with the subject ’s usual activities.

Page 40of 45
Severe An AE is severe if the sign or sy mptom is incapacitating and results in the 
subject ’s inability  to work or engage in their usual activities.
For every  AE in the study , the Investigator must assess the causalit y (Related or Not Related 
to the medical device or study  procedure). An assessment of causality  will also be performed 
by Study  Sponsor utilizing the same definitions, as shown below:
Causality
Related An AE classified as related may  be either definitely  related or possibl y related 
where a direct cause and ef fect relationship with the medical device or study  
procedure has not been demonstrated, but there is a reasonable possibility  that 
the AE was caused by  the medical device or stud y procedure.
Not Related An AE classified as not related may  either be definitely  unrelated or simply  
unlikely  to be related (ie, there are other more likely  causes for the AE).
The Study  Sponsor will assess the AEs and may  upgrade the Investigator ’s assessment of 
seriousness and/or causality . The Study  Sponsor will notify  the Investigator of an y AEs that 
areupgraded from non -serious to serious or from unrelated to related.
7.4 Return product analysis
Alcon products associated with device deficiencies and/or product related AEs should be 
returned and must include the Complaint # which will be provided by  Study  Sponsor after the 
case is entered in the Study  Sponsor ’s Global Product Complaint Management Sy stem. These 
products should be returned to the Sponsor at the end of the study , unle ss instructed otherwise 
by the Sponsor . 
7.5Follow -Up of Subjects with Adverse Events
The Investigator is responsible for adequate and safe medical care of subjects during the 
study  and for ensuring that appropriate medical care and relevant follow -up pr ocedures are 
maintained after the study . 
The Investigator should provide the Study  Sponsor with any  new safet y information (which 
includes new AEs and changes to previousl y reported AEs) that may  affect the safet y 
evaluation of the device. For AEs that ar e unresolved/ ongoing at time of subject exit from 
study , any  additional information received at follow -up should be documented in the eCRFs 
up to study  completion (ie, database lock).

Any additional data received up to 1 month after subject discontinuation or exit must be 
documented and available upon the Study  Sponsor ’s request. All complaints received after 
this time period will be considered and processed as spontaneous and should be 
communicated to the medical device ’s manufacturer as per local require ments.
The Investigator should alsoreport complain ts on non- Alcon products directly  to the 
manufacturer as per the manufacturer ’s instructions or local regulatory  requirements.
7.6 Pregnancy in the Clinical Study
Women of childbearing potential or women w ho are pregnant at the time of study  entry  are 
not excluded from participation. Pregnancy  should be included in the Medical History  section 
of the eCRF when a pregnant woman enters the study  or if a woman becomes pregnant 
during the stud y. Pregnancy  is not reportable as an AE; however , complications may  be 
reportable and will be decided on a case –by-case basis.
8CONFIDENTIALITY , BIAS, AND MASKING
8.1 Subject Confidentiality and Methods Used to Minimize Bias
The Investigator must ensure that the subject ’s anony mi
ty is maintained throughout the
course of the stud y. In particular , the Investigator must keep an enrollment log with
confidential identify ing information that corresponds to the subject numbers and initials of
each stud y participant. At the end of the cli nical study , the Sponsor will collect a cop y of the
enrollment log without any  identify ing subject information. All documents submitted to the
Sponsor will identify  the subjects exclusively  by number and demographic information. No
other personall y identif ying information should be transmitted to the Sponsor .
This study  is subject -masked with subjects randomized to use LID017569 or Biofinity  for 
30days and then crossover and use the other study  product for 30 day s. The Sponsor 
personnel (other than site monitors, lead clinical site manager , CDMA  PL, Alcon Observer , 
person responsible for generating the randomization schedule, and unmasked clinical data 
managers) involved in reporting, obtaining, and/or reviewing th e clinical evaluations will be 
masked to the identity  of the contact lens being administered. This level of masking will be 
maintained throughout the conduct of the stud y. Unmasking will occur only after all planned
study  data have been validated, and the database locked.
Masked study  personnel must avoid seeking information that may  compromise masking .
Unmasked study  personnel must not disseminate information that is potentially  unmasking to

any masked personnel. The masked and unmasked site personnel must coordinate all study  
activities as necessary  to protect masking and minimize bias during the trial.
8.2 Unmask ing of the Study Treatment
Investigators are unmasked in this study . However , the identity  of the assigned medical 
device should not be disclosed to subjects who are masked during the study . The Study 
Sponsor must be informed of all cases in which unmasking of the subject(s) has occ urred and 
of the circumstances involved. The Study  Sponsor should be informed in advance of 
unmasking when possible, except in the event of a medical emergency . Additionally , the 
Study  Sponsor may  be required to unmask the information in order to fulfill e xpedited 
regulatory  reporting requirements.
9DATA HANDLING AND ADMINISTRA TIVE REQUIREMENTS
9.1 Completion of Sour ce Documents and Case Report Forms
The nature and location of all source documents will be identified to ensure that original data 
required to compl ete the eCRFs exist and are accessible for verification by  the site monitor , 
and all discrepancies shall be appropriately  documented via the query  resolution process. 
Study  monitors are appointed by  the Study  Sponsor and are independent of study  site staff . If 
electronic records are maintained, the method of verification must be determined in advance 
of starting the stud y. 
At a minimum, source documents should include the following information for each subject:
Subject identification (name, sex, race/ethni city)
Documentation of subject eligibility
Date of informed consent
Dates of visits
Documentation that protocol specific procedures were performed

Date of stud y completion and reason for earl y discontinuation, if applicable
It is required that the author of an entry  in the source documents be identifiable. Direct access 
to source documentation (medical records) must be allowed for the purpose of verify ing that 
the data recorded on the eCRF are consistent with the original source data.
Only  designated individuals may complete the eCRFs. The eCRFs will be submitted at 
regular intervals following the clinical study  visit schedule. It is expected that all data 
reported will have corresponding entries in the source documents. T he Principal Investigator 
is responsible forreview ingand certify ingthat the eCRF s are accura te and complete. The 
only subject identifiers recorded on the eCRF s willbe subject number , and subject 
demographic information.
9.2 Data Review and Clarifications
Upon completion of the eCRFs, a targeted review of the eCRF data tothe subject ’s source 
data will be completed by the sitemonitor to ensure completeness and accuracy . 
Additional 
data clarifications and/or additions may  be needed as a result of the data cleaning process.
Data clarifications are documented and are part of each subject ’s eCRF s.
9.3 Regulatory Documentation and Records Retention
The Investigator is required to maintain up- to-date, complete regulatory  documentation as 
indicated by the Sponsor and the Investigator ’s files will be reviewed as part of the ongoing 
study  monitoring. Financial disclosure is not subject to regulatory inspection and should be 
kept separately . 
Additionally , the Investigator must keep study records and source documents until the 
Sponsor provides written approval for their destruction. If the Investigator retires, relocates, 
or for an y other reason withdraws from responsibility  of keeping the study  records, the 
Sponsor must be notified and suitable arrangements made for retention of study  records and 
source document s needed to comply  with national and interna tional regulations (generall y 
2years after discontinuing clinical development or after the last marketing approval).
10ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE
This trial will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles t hat have their origin in

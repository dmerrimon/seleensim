Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/2018  3 PART I: PROTOCOL  SUMMARY  
 
Title: METEOR : Think NIV Pilot Study  
 
Objective : Pilot test three strategies designed to speed implementation of preventive 
post-extubation noninvasive ventilation  (NIV) : one control strategy (traditional online 
continuing medical education) and two novel strategies (interprofessional education and 
just-in-time education)  
Study Design : Three parallel interrupted time series studies  
Inclusion Criteria : Two study populations will be included . Learner s will include [1] 
frontline care providers, including physicians, advanced practice providers, nurses, and 
respiratory therapists, [2] working in one of three participating UPMC ICU s: UPMC 
Presbyterian MICU, UPMC Mercy MSICU, and UPMC Passavant MSICU . Patients  will 
include a ll mechanically ventilated patients treated in the participating UPMC ICUs and 
surviving to extubation.  
Exclusion Criteria : Frontline care providers will be excluded if they:  
[1] Have not worked in their current UPM C ICU for more than one month  prior to 
the current study  
[2] Have not directly cared for a mechanically ventilated patient in a UPMC ICU 
during the three months preceding the current study  
Educational Strategies : 
[1] Traditional online continuing education  
[2] Interprofessional education  
[3] Just-in-time education  
Study Procedures : During a one -month intervention period, we will pilot test the 
educational strategies in three participating UPMC ICUs . Prior to receiving education, 
participants will be invited to complete a short online survey . Participants in the control 
group will be invited to complete a 30 -minute online continuing education module, which 
will conclude with a survey. Participants in t he interprofessional education group will be 
invited to attend a 90 -minute, in -person, interprofessional education session that will 
occur in or near the participating ICU. A trained advance practice provider will provide 
participants in the just -in-time e ducation group with 5 -10 minutes of education in the 
ICU when the ICU team is  rounding on a patient who is identified to be high risk for 
extubation failure. The just -in-time education may occur more than once per day, 
depending in the number of high -risk patients identified. All educational strategies will 
include content on the benefits of preventive post-extubation NIV, the indications and 
contraindications for preventive post-extubation NIV, and the value of working together 
as an interprofessional ICU team when implementing preventive post-extubation NIV. 
Each educational intervention will include a survey designed to determine the feasibility, 
acceptability, and preliminary impact of the educational strategies. We will also directly 
observe  instances o f interprofessional and just-in-time education and conduct in -person 
interviews to assess these factors in a qualitative manner. Lastly, d uring the intervention 
period and the 6 months before and after the intervention period, we will collect data 
from the  electronic health record and analyze changes in percent of high -risk patients 
who receive preventive post-extubation NIV, reintubation rate, duration of mechanical 
ventilation, ventilator -associated pneumonia, and in -hospital mortality.

Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/2018  4 PART  II: STUDY  DESCRIPTION  
1.0 Background  
1.1 Acute Respiratory Failure  
Acute respiratory failure requiring invasive mechanical ventilation affects nearly 800,000 
patients in the United States each year.1 Approximately half of these patients are > 65 
years old,1 a vulnerable group at high  risk for poor short - and long -term outcomes. Even 
among younger patients, mortality among mechanically ventilated ICU patients is 
extremely high, with in -hospital mortality averaging 35% for all patients and 
approaching 50% for syndromes like ARDS.1-3 Costs for these patients are also high, 
with an estimated $27 billion spent annually on their acute hospital care alone.1 
1.2 Post -Extubation O utcomes  for High -Risk Patients  
Recent improvement s in the management of sepsis, ARDS, and other causes of 
respiratory failure have led to better clinical outcomes, such that 70% -80% of 
mechanically ventilated ICU patients recover to the point of extubation.2,4 The current 
evidence -based management of these patients is to extubate once the patient passes a 
spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and is alert with adequate cough and minimal 
secretions. This SBT -based  strategy, especially when paired with sedation interruption, 
greatly improves outcomes,5,6 but many patients remain at high risk for post -extubation 
respiratory failure . Multiple large cohort studies have found that 10% to 20% of patien ts 
recovering from acute respiratory failure require reintubation after planned extubation,2,4 
and reintubation is strongly associated with death,7-10 increased costs,11 prolonged 
hospital stays,7,11 and long -term functional disability.12 This risk is greatest in elderly 
patients4,7,10 and patients with chronic pulmonary disease.7,10 In one recent study, 24% 
of mechanically ventilated ICU patients were both >65 ye ars old and had chronic cardiac 
or respiratory disease —these patients had a reintubation rate of 34% compared with 
9% among other patients (p<0.01).10  
1.3 Efficacy of Post -Extubation No ninvasive Ventilation  (NIV)  
When a mechanically ventilated patient with high risk  characteristics passes an SBT, 
clinicians must decide whether to extubate. Continuing invasive mechanical ventilation 
exposes the patient to risk and undue burden, but extubating without providing support 
is also undesirable. Post -extubation noninvasive v entilation offers clinicians a third 
option. In a landmark randomized controlled trial, Ferrer et al.13 studied high -risk 
mechanically ventilated ICU patients and found that extubation to immediate 
noninvasive ventilation (rather than conventional oxygen treatme nt) reduced both post -
extubation respiratory failure (RR = 0.31, 95%CI: 0.15 –0.62) and 90 -day mortali ty (RR 
= 0.36: 95%CI: 0.15 -0.85). A subsequent meta -analysis of five randomized controlled 
trials demonstrated that post -extubation noninvasive ventilation  improves multiple 
outcomes, including post -extubation respiratory failure, ICU length of stay, and 
mortality.13-17 Based on this evidence, recent clinical practice guidelines on liberation 
from mechanical ventilation sponsored by the American College of Chest Ph ysicians 
(ACCP) and the American Thoracic Society (ATS) and co -chaired by Dr. Girard (PI of this  
Protocol Title: METEOR: Think NIV Pilot   Protocol Version 1.0  
Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/2018  5 study ), made a strong recommendation  that high -risk patients who pass an SBT should 
be extubated to preventive noninvasive ventilation.18-20 A similar recommendation was 
made in guidelines published by the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and ATS, which 
were co -authored by Dr. Hess (a consultant  for this study ).21 
1.4 Implementation of Post -Extubation NIV 
Despite compelling evidence of benefit, multiple international cohort studies show that 
post-extubation noninvasive ventilation is used infrequently in routine clinical practice.2,22 
One of the largest studies, for example, found that  even though nearly 50% of 
invasively ventilated patients had a risk factor for failed extubation, less than 3%  
received preventative noninvasive ventilation after extubation.22 Although no studies 
have specifically examined bar riers to the use of post -extubation non -invasive 
ventilation, surveys about non -invasive ventilation in general,23-26 including one led by 
our consultant Dr. Hess,25 indicate that lack of familiarity with noninvasive ventilation, 
lack of awareness of the evidence, and concerns about the time re quired are key 
barriers to use. Due to these barriers, and likely others in the specific context of post -
extubation use, many  patients are not receiving an important evidenced -based practice. 
Based on epidemiologic data, we estimate that at least 200,000 m echanically ventilated 
patients/year in the United States are at high risk for extubation failure. If post -
extubation noninvasive ventilation leads to a 9% absolute reduction in mortality for this 
vulnerable population, as estimated in a recent meta -analys is,18-20 approximately 18,000 
deaths per year in the United States alone could be prevented by implementation of 
post-extubation noninvasive ventilation.  
1.5 Existing  Implementation Strategies  
Traditional strategies for knowledge transfer include education, guidelin e dissemination, 
audit and feedback of performance data, financial incentives, and automated 
reminders.27 These strategies are extremely effort intensive yet often ineffective, 
typically resulting in either no significant im provements in performance or small 
improvements that are not sustained over time.28,29 One reason for the failure of 
traditional knowledge transfer in the ICU is that these strategies do not fully account for 
the team -based nature of critical care.30 Like non -invasive ventilation, most evidence -
based practices in critical care are complex and multi -faceted, requiring ongoing 
coordination within a dynamic interprofessional care team.31 Existing strategies for 
knowledge transfer fail to account for this complexity, instead generally focusing on 
static barriers on the part of individual providers.32 33 Yet, targeting providers in isolation 
neglects the inherent role of coordination in evidence -based practice.34,35 The ICU is a 
complex adaptive system in which actors have the freedom to act in unpredictable 
ways.36 Absent a robust team, individual providers wi ll find ways to circumvent even 
newer strategies like electronic prompts, making these interventions only modestly 
effective.37 It is essential that the next generation of implementation strategies 
acknowledge and account for this complexity so that they empower interprofessional 
teams with the skills to overcome challenges to implementation of evidence -based 
practice as they dynamically arise as well as sustain improvement after the novelty of 
the new intervention has worn off.

Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/2018  6 1.6 Organizational  Learning  
Over the last three decades a rich body of research has evolved around the area of 
organizational learning, the pro cess by which organizations create, retain and transfer 
knowledge.38 Although individual learning underlies basic knowledge acquisition, for new 
knowledge to be useful to an organization it must embedded within a group repository 
that is accessible to other members so that it can  be accessed and shared when needed. 
This is particularly true when, like in the ICU, performance is contingent upon 
coordination, since all members must be able to draw off the same knowledge 
repository for coordination to occur.39 It is also particularly true when, like in the ICU, 
team membership is dynamic. Becau se ICU team members rotate in and out of the 
team, unembedded knowledge is easily lost. Current theory defines the system by which 
organizations acquire and apply specialized knowledge as a transactive memory 
system .40 Colloquially, transactive memory systems are the knowledge of who knows 
what. When an organization has a robust transactive memory syste m, team members 
can rely each other to recall and apply key knowledge about important tasks. This 
“mutual confidence” frees up each individual team member to deepen their own 
expertise while at the same time ensuring that their knowledge remains accessible  to 
others.38 Extensive empirical data now indicate that transactive memory systems 
underlie organizational learning and are tightly linked to organizational performance in a 
variety of industries ranging from service to hospitality.41 In this application, we posit 
that limitations of past implementation work can be addressed by two interventions 
designed to strengthen  transactive memory systems in ICUs: interprofessional education  
and just-in-time education . 
• Interprofessional education: Traditional continuing education focuses on 
individuals and occurs in professional silos —physicians learning from physicians, 
nurses l earning from nurses, etc. As a result, the individual professions acquire 
different mental models and lack a shared understanding of the task at hand. 
Interprofessional education, in which members of different providers learn together, 
overcomes this probl em by reinforcing not only shared mental models42,43 but also 
cross-understanding, or the degree to which group members have accurate 
understandings of each other’s’ mental models.44 Interprofessional education fosters 
the development of a shared language or common set of terms, which enables 
effective coordination. Int erprofessional education also helps ensure that new 
knowledge occurs in a supportive context, enabling individuals to jointly practice 
coordinated actions in a team -based setting, promoting knowledge retention through 
the development of transactive memory systems.45 
• Just-in-time education: Traditional continuing education occurs in classrooms or 
at home, separate from the “moment of  need” and divorced from the practical 
context. Just -in-time education overcomes this problem by providing instruction at 
the bedside at the exact moment the knowledge is needed.46 Because just -in-time 
education includes demonstrations and opportunities to observe effective pr actice, it 
enables the transfer of tacit, difficult -to-articulate knowledge.47 Just-in-time 
education also strengthens transactive memory systems by tying knowledge 
acquisition directly to experience —instead of depending on subsequent experience 
to reinforce knowledge, knowledge acquisition and experience occur 
simultaneously.48 In addition, just -in-time education ties knowledge acquisition to a 
specific case of immediate relevance,49,50 reducing ambiguity in the learning process.

perform their tasks within the context of a relational team.51 
2.0 Objective  and Hypothesis  
2.1 Objective  
During the METEOR: Think NIV Pilot Study, we seek to pilot test three strategies 
designed to speed implementation of post -extubation  noninvasive ventilation: one 
control strategy (traditional online continuing medical education) and two novel 
strategies (interprofessional education and just -in-time education).  
2.2 Hypothesis  
We hypothesize that interprofessional education and just -in-time education are feasible 
and acceptable to members of the interdisciplinary ICU team; and that the pilot testing 
will yield important information that will enable us to both refine the interventions and 
perform power calculations for the subsequent clinical trial. 
3.0 Study Population and Enrollment  
3.1 Inclusion  Criteria  
Two study populations will be included.  
• Learners  will include [1] frontline care providers, including physicians, advanced 
practice providers, nurses, and respiratory therapists, [2] working in one of three 
participating UPMC ICUs: UPMC Presbyterian MICU, UPMC Mercy MSICU, and UPMC 
Passavant MSICU.  
• Patients will include all mechanically ventilated patients treated in the participating 
UPMC ICUs and surviving to extubation.  
3.2 Exclusion Criteria  
Care providers will be excluded from the Learner population if they:  
[1] Have not worked in their current UPM C ICU  for more than one month  
[2] Have not directly cared for a mechanically ventilated patient in a UPMC ICU 
during the three months preceding the current study  
3.3 Enrollment  
Study personnel  will provide  nursing and medical managers from each participating ICU 
with an introduc tory script that  explain the study’s methods and goals. Uni t leadership 
will provide potential learners with the script, inviting them to participate  and describing 
the study procedures and potential risks and benefits. Because exemptions 45 CFR 
46.101(b)(1) and 45 CFR 46.101(b)( 4) apply and it will not be practicable to obtain 
informed consent, we will request a waiver to document informed consent fro m learners 
(whose actions will indicate their consent to participate) and a waiver to request 
Protocol Title: METEOR: Think NIV Pilot   Protocol Version 1.0  
Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/2018  8 informed consent from patients (for whom the only study procedure will be collected of 
existing data from the electronic health record).  
3.4 Intervention Group Assign ment  
Given the nature of the interventions and the dynamics of interprofessional team care in 
the ICU, randomization at the level of the individual learner would likely result in 
significant cross contamination, thereby introducing bias in the trial. A bet ter alternative 
in this case is to assign learners to i ntervention s in group s. We will therefore assign all 
learners in a single ICU to the same intervention group. Given the pilot nature of this 
trial, we will assign one ICU to each group. For logistical reasons, learners in the UPMC 
Mercy MSICU will be assigned to traditional online continuing education, those in the 
UPMC Passavant MSICU will be assigned to interprofessional education, and those in the 
UPMC Presbyterian MICU will be assigned to just -in-time education.  
4.0 Study Procedures  
4.1 Pre-Education Survey  
Prior to receiving the educational interventions, learners will be asked to complete a 10 -
minute survey designed to assess their baseline knowledge.  
4.2 Educational  Interventions  
During a one -month study intervention period, the following three educational 
interventions will be piloted simultaneously.  
• Traditional  online continuing education . We will use an active control 
consisting of “best existing practice” for continuing education. Learners  working in 
the ICU assigned to this arm will be offered a 30 -minute, online, interactive, 
educational video describing the benefits of preventive post-extubation NIV, the 
indications and contraindications for preventive post-extubation NIV, and the value 
of working together as an interprofessional ICU team when implementing preventive 
post-extubation NIV. The video will be customized to each provider type  (e.g., 
nurse, respiratory therapist, or physician). Learners will be  offered provid er-specific 
continuing education credits . 
• Interprofessional  education . Learners  working in the ICU assigned to this arm 
will receive, a one -time, 90 -120-minute, in -person, interprofessional educational 
workshop consisting of a 30 -minute didactic session an d a 60 -90-minute small group 
session. The workshop is designed according to modern principles of adult learning 
and interprofessional education, including provider participation in development, 
fostering authenticity, reinforcing role identity, and relatin g content to life 
experience. Facilitators will be trained advance practice providers with content 
expert ise who can speak to all targeted professions.  Research staff will observe 
educational sessions.  
• Just-in-time education . Learners  working in the ICU assigned to this arm will 
receive, “just -in-time,” point -of-care education. Trained advanced practice providers 
will be on -hand in the study ICU , where they will deliver the just -in-time education . 
Protocol Title: METEOR: Think NIV Pilot   Protocol Version 1.0  
Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/2018  9 When a patient meets criteria for preventive post-extubation NIV, the educator will 
join the interprofessional ICU team at the bedside  during rounds and will  briefly 
review the evidence underlying risk assessment and proper use of preventive post-
extubation NIV, providing instruction about how to provide preventive post-
extubation NIV as well as how to anticipate potential barriers and pitfalls, while also 
fostering active collaboration. The just-in-time education  is designed to cause  
minimal disruptions in workflow . Research staff will observe select educ ational 
sessions.  
After each  educational intervention , learners  will be asked to complete a brief survey 
designed to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of the 
educational strategies.  
4.3 Follow -Up Interviews  
Two to six weeks after  the educational interventions, trained qualitative research 
coordinators  will conduct learners to invite them to participant in in-person interviews 
that will  qualitative ly assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary impact of the 
educational s trategies  using open -ended questions . 
 
Lastly, during the intervention period and the 6 months before and after the intervention 
period, we will collect data from the electronic health record and analyze changes in 
percent of high -risk patients who receive preventive post -extubation NIV, reintubation 
rate, duration of mechanical ventilation, ventilator -associated pneumonia, and in -
hospital mortality.  
4.4 Statistical  Considerations  
We will use interrupted  time series  analysis  to compare  clinical  outcomes  measured  
during  the six months  before  the implementation  strategies  with those  measured  during  
the six months  after initiation  of the strategies.52 All analyses  will be adjusted  for 
baseline  characteristics  associated  with the outcomes,  including  age, comorbid  
conditions,  and severity  of illness  at admission.  Additionally,  interaction  terms  will be 
used to determine  whether  age and chronic  cardiac  and/or  respiratory  disease  modified  
the effect  of the implementation  strategy  on outcomes.  
 
Due to the pilot nature  of this study,  we do not yet have preliminary  data with which  to 
perform  power  calculations  or sample  size analyses.  The sample  size will therefore  be 
determined  by feasibility  (i.e., the number  of learners  who agree  to participate  and the 
number  of eligible  patients  admitted  to participati ng ICUs during  the study  period),  and 
we will use the results  of the current  pilot study  to determine  the sample  size of a 
subsequent  cluster  randomized  trial. 
4.5 Database and Case Report Forms  
We will collect demographics from the ICU Team including, but not  limited to, UPMC 
emails (for Wolff Center use to collect detailed information), education, background and 
training, and partial social security numbers to facilitate CME credits for physician team 
members, CUE credits for nursing staff members and compara tive education method for 
respiratory therapists . 
Protocol Title: METEOR: Think NIV Pilot   Protocol Version 1.0  
Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/2018  10 All qualitative data collection will be performed by trained qualitative research 
coordinators. We will audiotape and transcribe all recordings. Digital voice files and 
electronic files of transcribed sessions will be stored on a password -protected server. To 
maximize par ticipation, we will provide appropriate compensation  and schedule sessions 
for a time and place that is convenient for participants. No identifiers  will be collected, 
and participants  will be identified by profession and a number and not by name (e.g. , 
Intensivist 1, Nurse 4, etc.). Interviews will be held in private locations.  
De-identified patient  data will be collected  from the electronic health record and the ICU 
Registr y. These data will includ e, but not  be limited to, in -hospital mortality  truncated a t 
60 days from the time of intubation, ICU and hospital length of stay, post -extubation 
respiratory failure, duration of mechanical ventilation, 28 -day ventilator -free days, 
ventilator -associated pneumonia, and organ failure (tracked daily using the Sequen tial 
Organ Failure Assessment score ). 
5.0 Protection of Human Participants  
5.1 Potential Risks  
Since the interventions being studied are educational strategies applied to care providers 
rather than to patients, we anticipate that potential risk to patient particip ants will be 
limited to accidental disclosure of protected health information should there be a breach 
in our data security procedures. Potential risk to learner participants includes 
psychological discomfort associated with completing the surveys, which w ill address 
topics related to the ICU practice environment and working relationships with 
colleagues. Given that these topics are of a non -sensitive nature, we believe 
psychological discomfort will occur infrequently. An additional risk is accidental publi c 
disclosure of a participant’s survey results. For this to occur, a survey must be 
accidentally misplaced and the unique key linking the participant’s survey to the ICU 
identifiers must also be misplaced, and each must be recovered by the same person, a 
series of events that is extremely unlikely. A final risk is that learner participants could 
feel pressured to participate by their employer or a researcher and worry that their 
professional relationships will be jeopardized if they refuse. For our past wor k, the 
University of Pittsburgh Human Research Protection Office has considered similar studies 
to be “minimal risk” under the Department of Health and Human Services Code of 
Federal Regulations because it involved social research methods (e.g., surveys) a nd 
because the probability and magnitude of physical and psychological harm is similar to 
that normally encountered in daily life.  
5.2 Protection Against Risks  
We plan several  steps to protect  the rights  of human  subjects  involved  in this research.  
We will not record  any personal  information  other than what is needed  for a 
demographic  description  of the cohort  (age, gender,  job category,  time in service);  thus, 
interview  participants  will not be identifiable  in any way. All voice recordings  will be 
destroyed  after transcription.  All personal  identifiers  will be redacted  by the transcriber,  
and all transcriptions  will be triple-read to ensure  that they contain  no potential  
identifiers.  We will contact  all potential  participants  directly  to give them the option  of 
refusing  confidentially  in private  and to assure  them that we will not feedback  
Protocol Title: METEOR: Think NIV Pilot   Protocol Version 1.0  
Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/2018  11 information  regarding  participation  to their managers.  This step will not only allow 
potential  participants  to refuse  to participate  without  pressure  or coercion  from 
employer s, but it will also ensure  that information  on whether  or not they participated  
will not find its way back to their employer,  preventing  potential  retaliation.  We will take 
extensive  precautions  to guard  against  disclosure  of protected  health  information  and to 
maintain  participant  confidentially , as described  in section  5.4.2.  
5.3 Record Retention  
Informed  consent  documents  will be source  documents  kept in the study  coordinator’s  
locked  files. Only key personnel  will have access.  All data will be kept for an indefinite  
amount  of time at the University  of Pittsburgh  after the conclusion  of the study.  
5.4 Data  and Safety Monitoring Plan  (DSMP)  
5.4.1  Adherence Statement  
The DSMP outlined herein  will adhere to the study protocol approved by the University 
of Pittsburgh IRB . The study  will be conducted in compliance with the protocol, 
International Conference on Harmonization guideline E6: Good Clinical Practice (ICH 
E6): Consolidated Guideline, and the applicable regulatory requirements from United 
States (US) Code of Federa l Regulations (CFR) (Title 45 CFR Parts 46 and Title 21 CFR 
including Parts 50 and 56) concerning informed consent and Institutional Review Board 
(IRB) regulations . 
5.4.2  Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  
As described in detail in the METEOR: Think NIV Pil ot Study DSMB Charter, a Data and 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)  will be created, consist ing of three voting members 
with expertise in clinical research methodology and critical care medicine.  DSMB 
responsibilities are to:  
• protect the safety of the study p articipants;  
• review the research protocol and plans for data and safety monitoring;  
• evaluate the progress of the trial, including periodic assessments of data quality 
and timeliness, recruitment, accrual and retention, participant risk versus benefit, 
performance of the trial sites, and other factors that can affect study outcome;  
• conside r factors external to the study when relevant information becomes 
available, such as scientific or therapeutic developments that may have an 
impact on the safety of the participants or the ethics of the trial;  
• make recommendations to the Principal Investig ator concerning continuation, 
termination or other modifications of the trial based on the observed beneficial or 
adverse effects of the treatment under study; and  
• ensure the confidentiality of the study data and the results of monitoring.  
The DSMB will ha ve one planned meeting before the intervention period. Additionally, 
the DSMB Chair, the Principal Investigator, or the NHLBI may call a meeting of the 
DSMB at any time.  Though unexpected given the minimal risk nature of the study, any 
serious adverse even ts that are suspected by the Principal Investigator to be related to 
study participation —events referred to as Serious Unexpected Suspected Adverse 
Reactions (SUSARs) —as well as any other AE report that the Principal Investigator 
believes is appropriate fo r DSMB review will be reviewed by the DSMB Chair. The DSMB 
Protocol Title: METEOR: Think NIV Pilot   Protocol Version 1.0  
Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/2018  12 Chair may distribute SUSAR reports to the other DSMB members for review. If a SUSAR 
occurs, the Principal Investigator will email a report to the DSMB Chair within 48 hours 
for review. The DSMB Cha ir will then indicate via email within 96 hours if additional 
information is required and whether additional action is recommended secondary to 
review of the SUSAR (e.g., DSMB teleconference).  
5.4.3  Confidentiality  
Protection of Participant Privacy:  We will take extensive precautions to guard against 
disclosure of protected health information and maintain participant confidentially. All 
data management and analysis activities will take place on CRISMA’s secure, HIPAA -
compliant servers behind the UPMC  firewall. Patient data will be obtained from the 
approved ICU Registry. Data in the registry is  downloaded directly from the electronic 
health record (E HR) via secure FTP. No data containing any protected health information 
will ever leave the secure serv er. All investigators, programmers, and analysts working 
with the files will sign a confidentially agreement committing them to full privacy. We 
will also take several steps to protect the privacy of learner  participants. Paper survey 
forms using during educational sessions  will only include the participant’s unique study 
ID and no other identifying information. Thus, if the survey form is lost, it will not be 
directly linkable to the participant without additional information. And, we will store the 
partic ipant study ID linkage key on our secure, password -protected, HIPAA -compliant 
server, which is maintained according to strict federal security standards. This key will 
be destroyed after data collection is complete.  
 
Database Protection:  All data managemen t and analysis activities will take place on 
CRISMA’s secure, HIPAA -compliant servers behind the UPMC firewall. No data containing 
any protected health information will ever leave the secure server.  
 
Confidentiality during Adverse Event (AE) Reporting:  Adverse event reports and annual 
summaries to regulatory bodies will not include participant -or group -identifiable 
material. Each report will only include the identification code.  
5.4.4  Adverse Event Information  
Clinical Outcomes (Not Considered Adverse Events).  In this study of critically ill patients 
who are at high risk for death or other adverse outcomes due to their underlying critical 
illness, clinical outcomes, including death and organ dysfunction, will be systematically 
tracked and will be included as part of the safety and effectiveness analyses for this 
study. For the purposes of reporting, death and organ dysfunction will not be recorded 
as adverse events ( AEs) unless the investigator believes the event may have been 
related to study participation or is m ore severe or prolonged than expected given the 
underlying critical illness. This approach —considering death and organ dysfunction as 
outcomes rather than AEs and systemically tracking expected safety outcomes for 
analysis rather than solely recording indi vidual AEs —is common during critical care trials 
because these outcomes/events occur frequently in the ICU, and this system mandates 
that data regarding death, organ dysfunction, and expected safety outcomes be tracked 
systematically for all patients and a nalyzed appropriately. Listed below are events that 
will be tracked as clinical outcomes and will not therefore be reported as AEs during this 
Protocol Title: METEOR: Think NIV Pilot   Protocol Version 1.0  
Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/2018  13 study (unless believed to be study related and/or more severe or prolonged than 
expected given the underlying cri tical illness):  
• Death  
• Respiratory failure, including need for mechanical ventilation (invasive or 
noninvasive) or episodes of hypoxemia  
• Circulatory failure, including shock (whether requiring vasopressors or not) and 
cardiac arrhythmias, and hypertension  
• Hepatic failure or injury leading to increased bilirubin, AST, or ALT  
• Renal failure or injury leading to an  increased creatinine or acute hemodialysis  
• Coagulation derangements leading to elevated PT/INR or PTT, DIC, 
thrombocytopenia, or thrombocytosis  
• Cogni tive impairment that is believed to be newly acquired  
• Alterations in vital signs (e.g., temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation)  
• Falls 
• Pressure ulcers  
• Thromboembolisms  
• ICU readmissions  
• Infections  
• Self-removal of devices and invasive tubing and/or monitoring equipment  
• Alterations in routine labs, including chemistries, complete blood counts, liver 
function tests, and creatine kinase  
 
Adverse Event (AE) Classifications . We define an  AE as any untoward medical 
occurrence for a study participant  that is not tracked as a clinical outcome, regardless of 
whether the event  is considered study related or not. All AEs  will be assessed as to 
whether they are (1) related to study participation, (2) serious, and/or (3) unexpected 
according to the followin g definitions:  
Related . AEs that an investigator suspects are related to study participation  will 
be classified as Suspected Adverse Reactions (SARs). A high degree of certainty of 
relatedness is not required as long as a reasonable possibility exists that  the AE is 
related to study participation.  
Serious . AEs that result in any criteria below will be considered Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs):  
• Death  
• A life-threatening episode requiring immediate intervention  
• Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of exist ing hospitalization  
• Persistent or significant incapacitation or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• An episode that requires intervention to prevent the above and/or 
permanent impairment or damage  
Unexpected . AEs, including SARs, that are more severe or prolonged than 
expected will be considered Unexpected.  
 
All events that are related , unexpected , and serious  will be reported as Serious 
Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reactions (SUSARs).  Given that all known risks of 
participation in the proposed study qualify as minimal risks, we do not anticipate any  
Protocol Title: METEOR: Think NIV Pilot   Protocol Version 1.0  
Protocol Version 1.0  
Date: 9/14/2018  14 SUSARs. Nevertheless, we have established this system for monitoring and reporting 
should such as event occur.  
 
Unanticipated Pro blems (UP). Per OHRP and NHLBI regulations and guidance, any 
incident, experience, or outcome that meets all of the following criteria  will be reported 
as a UP: 1) unexpected, 2) related  or possibly related to participation in the research,  
and 3) suggests  that the research places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm 
than was previously known or recognized.  Per this definition, all SUSARs will also be 
classified as UPs, but not all UPs will be classified as SUSARs.  
 
Communication and Reporting of Adverse Events.  All AEs will be reported to the  
University of Pittsburgh  IRB per local policies. In addition, SUSARs and UPs will be 
reported as follows, in keeping with the NHLBI A E and U P reporting policies. 
 
Event type  Timing of report  Repo rter Recipient  
Fatal or life -threatening SUSAR  Within 7 days of initial receipt of information  PI IRB, NHLBI  
Non-fatal or non -life-threatening SUSAR  Within 15 days of initial receipt of information  PI IRB, NHLBI  
UP that is not an SAE  Within 14 days of PI becoming aware of UP  PI IRB, NHLBI  
All UPs  Within 30 days of the IRB’s receipt of the 
report of the UP from the investigator  IRB OHRP  
5.4.5  Data Quality and Safety Review Plan and Monitoring  
Description of Plan for Data Quality and Management . The PI or study staff will review 
all data collection forms on an ongoing basis for data completeness and accuracy as well 
as protocol compliance.  
 
Frequency of Review . This will vary according to the data type, as follows : 
 
Data Type  Frequency of review  Reviewer  
Learner  participant accrual (including 
compliance with protocol)  Weekly during the one -month pilot period  PI 
Status of all enrolled participants (patients 
and learners ) 1. End of pre -implementation period  
2. End of pilot -period  
3. End of post -implementati on period  PI 
Adherence data regarding evidence -based 
practice and implementation strategies  1. End of pre -implementation period  
2. End of pilot -period  
3. End of post -implementation period  PI 
5.4.6  Informed Consent  
When conducting interviews, surveys, educational sessions,  and direct observation of 
the educational strategies in the ICU, we will obtain oral assent from all learner  
participants using an IRB -approved script. We will not obtain written consent for these 
activities because it is not feasible  nor practica ble given the sheer number and rapidity 
of these observations. Prior to each observation episode, research staff will introduce 
themselves, describe the project, and offer the opportunity for ICU staff to opt in or opt 
out. Staff wishing to op t out will be given a lapel pin to wear during the observation 
periods.  Following periods of observation, we will once again give each participant the 
option to opt out if they feel uncomfortable being observed in our research. We will also 
allow any parti cipant to later opt out after the period of observation, to the degree 
possible, thereby reducing the risk of pressure from superiors to participate in this 
research.  We will seek a waiver of informed consent  for inclusion of patients since  the

Date: 9/14/2018  15 research, w hich will be limited to collecting existing clinical data from the electronic 
health record months after the study period,  involves no more than minimal risk and the 
research could not be practica bly carried out without the waiver.  
5.4.7  Reporting Changes in Stu dy Status  
Any action resulting in a temporary or permanent suspension of the study will  be 
reported to the NHLBI  Program Official responsible for the grant .

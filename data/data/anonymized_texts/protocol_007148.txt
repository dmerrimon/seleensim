This amendment is considered to be substantial based on the criteria set forth in Article 
10(a) of Directive 2001/20/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of the 
European Union .  
Overall Rationale for the Amendment:   
Change in  analysis strategy  to perform  primary analysis after the end of Part A  including 
available Part B data and final analysis after the end of Part B , addition of allow ed early 
access to certain data to enable kineti c-pharmacodynamic ( K-PD) modelling, and 
introduction of  blinding strategy to support these changes. Removal of exclusion criteria 
no longer needed, o ther changes to fulfill the EU CTR requirements , and clarifications in 
line with updated sponsor protocol template also included.

Meaningful Content Changes and Notable Clarifications  
Synopsis , Section 
1.1, and throughout 
Protocol  • The terminology of 
Mean Worst Daily Itch 
(MWDI) Score was 
changed to Weekly Itch 
Score (WIS).  
• The terminology of 
Mean Daily Sleep Score 
was changed to Weekly 
Sleep Score.  Adoption of more intuitive 
terminology for the concept – 
the calculation remains the 
same . 
Section  2.3.1, Risk 
Assessment ; 
Section  5.2, 
Exclusion Criteria  • Updated rationale for 
the potential  increased 
risk of colon cancer in 
association with 
increased fecal excretion 
of bile acids ’ and 
removed mitigation 
excluding participants 
from the study with 
current/  previous 
diagnosis of colorectal 
cancer . 
• Exclusion criteria for 
current/previous 
diagnosis of colorectal 
cancer was removed.  
(Any current 
malignancies remains as 
an exclusion criterion.)  Current review of the totality of 
data on the potential risk of 
'colorectal cancer' is not 
consistent with this theoretical 
association  with patients 
receiving linerixibat. Hence, to 
prevent unnecessary exclusion 
of participants with history of 
colorectal cancer, this exclusion 
has been removed.

25 1. PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1. Synopsis  
Protocol Title:  A two -part, randomized, placebo controlled, double blind, multicenter, 
Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of linerixibat for the treatment of 
cholestatic pruritus in participants with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC ).  
Brief Title : Global Linerixibat Itch STudy of Efficacy and Safety i N PBC (GLISTEN)  
Rationale:  
Cholestatic pruritus burdens  up to three quarters of patients with PBC during the course 
of their disease. This itch due to this rare and chronic liver disea se, represents a serious 
condition that continues to lack effective treatments.  
Linerixibat, an ileal bile acid transporter inhibitor administered as an oral tablet, is 
minimally absorbed from gastrointestinal tract. Linerixibat is anticipated to reduce 
pruritus and associated symptoms in patients with PBC by increasing the excretion of bile 
acids and reducing bile acid concentrations in systemic circulation. Twice daily 
linerixibat has demonstrated significant improvement in cholestatic pruritus in PBC 
patients in previous Phase 2a and Phase 2b studies.  
Moreover, the Phase 2b dose ranging study (201000 – [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] –referred to as the 
GLIMMER study) demonstrated linerixibat 40  mg twice daily  (BID) as the minimally 
effective dose providing improvement in cholestatic pruritus over 12 weeks of treatment 
with a low rate of discontinuation due to gastrointestinal ( GI) intolerability.  
This Phase 3 study will further investigate the efficacy and safety of 24 weeks of 40 mg 
BID oral linerixibat for the treatment of pruritus in PBC patients with moderate to severe 
cholestatic pruritus (Part A), as well as assess the return of itch over 8 -weeks after 
withdrawal of 40  mg BID oral linerixibat compared to placebo (Part B). Participants 
enrolled in the study may be treatment naïve, have been previously treated, or may  take 
stable background itch therapy at the discretion of the physician in the best interest of the 
patient.  Definitions of cholestatic pruritus treatments can be found in the main protocol 
text. 
Participants will record itch scores twice daily using an e lectronic Diary  (eDiary) . A 0 -10 
Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), which has been va lidated in the PBC population, will be 
used to assess itch with a response option of 0 representing no itching and 10 the worst 
imaginable itching. Every morning the participant will record the worst itch experienced 
the night before and every evening, the  participant will record the worst itch experienced 
that day.  
The itch scores for any day, week, and month will then be determined as follows:  
• Worst Daily Itch Score:  the worst of the two scores recorded daily will be 
considered the score for that day  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol Amendment 04  
26 • Weekly  Itch Score  (WIS) (formerly referred to as Mean Worst Daily Itch  
[MWDI]  Score) : the average of the Worst Daily Itch scores in one week  
• Monthly Itch Score:  the worst Weekly  Itch Score for that month (i.e., worst 
week  score of the 4 weeks)  
Cholestatic pruritus has a negative impact on health -related  quality of life (QoL) for PBC 
patients. The P rimary Biliary Cholangitis -40 Questionnaire (PBC -40) is a disease -
specific health -related QoL instrument consisting of 6 domains: social, emotional, 
symptoms, fat igue, itch (including an item on sleep disturbance from itching) and 
cognitive. Results from the GLIMMER study demonstrated significant improvement 
from baseline in the social and emotional domains of PBC -40 for participants receiving 
40mg BID linerixibat.  Therefore, this study will further evaluate the  effect of linerixibat 
on PBC -40 domains. Since sleep is only a single item in PBC -40 and sleep disturbance is 
a major complaint of PBC patients, participant’s sleep will also be evaluated using the 
daily eDi ary. Participants will record a sleep interference score each morning using a 
0-10 NRS, where 0 represents no sleep interference and 10 represents complete sleep 
interference. For each week, the average of the Daily Sleep Scores will be used to 
calculate the Weekly Sleep Score (formerly referred to as  the Mean Daily Sleep Score). 
The Monthly Sleep Score is the worst Weekly  Sleep Score for that month (i.e., worst 
week  score of the 4 weeks).

data impacted by  the intercurrent events will be discarded.  
Overall Design:  
This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, 2 -part (Part A and Part B), randomized, 
double -blind, placebo -controlled study in PBC patient s with moderate to severe pruritus. 
Part A will evaluate the efficacy, safety and impact on health -related quality of life of 
linerixibat compared with placebo over 24 weeks, while Part B will assess the return of 
itch over 8 weeks after withdrawal of linerixibat.  In both Part A and Part B, participants 
may be treatment naïve, have had prior itch therapy and/or may  take stable background 
itch therapy  at the discretion of the physician in the best interest of the patient or rescue 
medicati on where applicable .   
This study consists of four Periods (Screening, Intervention (Part A and Part B) and 
Follow -up): 
Screening Period: Participants will attend two screening visits to assess eligibility as 
described below:  
• Screening 1 (Visit  1): Assessments to be performed as described in the schedule 
of assessments (SoA). Itch severity will be assessed retrospectively based on 
participant recall and then prospectively for eligibility purposes using a twice 
daily eDiary throughout the screenin g period.  
• Screening 2 (Visit 2):  Additional liver biochemistry assessments to be 
performed at least 4 weeks after screening visit 1 to ensure stability of liver 
disease for participant safety and eligibility purposes.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol Amendment 04  
30 Intervention (Treatment) Period  Part A  (Day 1 through Week 24) : Eligible participants 
will be randomized in a 1:1 :1:1 ratio to receive linerixibat 40 mg BID in Part A and Part 
B, linerixibat 40 mg BID in Part A and placebo in Part B, placebo in Part A and Part B, 
or placebo in Part A and liner ixibat 40 mg BID  in Part B.  
The primary analysis will be performed when all randomized participants have completed 
the Part A intervention period (up to Week 24/Visit 9), as described in Section 9.4. The 
blinding strategy is described in Section 6.4. 
Randomization will be stratified by:  
• Severity of pruritus based on Monthly Itch Score for the 28 days preceding 
randomization:  
o Moderate: ≥ 4 and < 7  
o Severe: ≥ 7  
• Concomitant cholestatic pru ritus treatment regimen  (definitions of cholestatic 
pruritus treatments can be found in the main protocol text) :  
o Bile acid binding resin -containing regimen  
o Regimen that does not contain bile acid binding resins  
o No cholestatic pruritus treatment .  
The reg ion (US or rest of the world) and site categorized by whether the visits will be 
conducted fully remotely will serve as an administrative stratification factor. The primary 
analysis will not adjust for this administrative stratification factor. Further det ails will be 
provided in the SAP . 
Intervention (Treatment) Period  Part B  (Week 24 through Week 32) : Participants who 
had initially been taking linerixibat in Part A will either continue on linerixibat or switch 
to placebo at Week 24 for Part B. Participants who had been taking placebo in Part A will 
either continue on placebo or switch to linerixibat at Week 24 for Part B.  
Follow -up Period or Follow -on Study :  
Participants who complete treatment in Part A and Part B will be offered the opportunit y 
to take part in a separate long -term follow -on study, where linerixibat will be provided in 
an open -label manner. This open -label, long -term study will assess safety  and tolerability 
(and efficacy in participants transferring from this study) . Participan ts who do not enter 
the follow -on study or are discontinued from study treatment but remain in the study will 
have a follow up phone call approximately 7 -14 days after the last dose of study drug.  
Where applicable country and local regulations allow, some or all of the participant visits 
may be conducted remotely or via a virtual trial platform. Home healthcare services may 
also be utilized to support these activities where local regulations and infrastructure 
allow.

31 Number of Participants:  
This study plans  to randomi ze approximately 230 participants with PBC and moderate to 
severe cholestatic pruritus.  
Participants receiving concomitant bile acid binding resins may comprise up to 15% of 
the overall Phase 3 study population.  
Based on GLIMMER (201000) study, it is expected that at least 20% of participants in 
the study will be receiving concomitant itch therapy and/or have had prior itch therapy; 
patients entering the study have moderate to severe itch and as such these patients have 
not adequately responded t o or are intolerant to available standard of care . 
Intervention Groups and Duration:  
The total duration of the study including screening, treatment and follow up phone -call (if 
performed) is not expected to exceed 42 weeks.  Visit frequency will be approxim ately 
every 4 weeks during treatment.  
• Screening: Up to 56 -day screening window.  
• Part A: 24 weeks treatment with either linerixibat 40  mg BID or placebo  
• Part B: 8 weeks treatment with either linerixibat 40  mg BID or placebo  
• Follow -up: 2 weeks (for those not  enrolling in the follow -on study)  
Data Monitoring / Other Committee:  Yes 
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will perform a futility analysis of 
efficacy at the planned interim analysis for the study  and evaluate the safety  of 
participants .

 39 2. INTRODUCTION  
2.1. Study Rationale  
Cholestatic pruritus burdens up to three quarters of PBC patients through the course of 
their disease [Hegade , 2014; Hegade , 2019 ]. This itch due to the rare, chronic liver 
disease is a serious condition that causes significant impairment of day -to-day 
functioning, including sleep disturbance, fatigue, depression, and suicidality [Jin, 2016; 
Hegade , 2016; Younossi , 2000; Hönig , 2018 ]. 
Limitations of efficacy and tolerability of current treatments mean that patients are left 
with restricted choices. Thus, there is a continued urgent unmet medical need for new 
treatmen ts for cholestatic pruritus in PBC that provide symptomatic relief and reduce the 
impact of pruritus on quality of life.  
Linerixibat, an ileal bile acid transporter inhibitor administered as a twice daily (BID)  
oral tablet, has shown significant improvement in cholestatic pruritus in PBC patients in 
Phase 2 studies ( BAT117213 and  the previously mentioned GLIMMER study). 
Moreover, the GLIMMER study demonstrated linerixibat 40  mg BID as the minimally 
effective dose  providing improvement on cholestatic pruritus over 12 weeks of treatment 
with a low  rate of discontinuation  due to  gastrointestinal (G I) intolerability . 
Primary Biliary Cholangitis -40 Questionnaire ( PBC -40) is a disease -specific health -
related quality of life ( QoL) instrument consisting of 6 domains: social, emotional, 
symptoms, fatigue, itch (including an item on sleep disturbance from itch domain)  and 
cognitive. Results from the GLIMMER study demonstrated clinically and statistically  
significant improvem ent from baseline in the social and emotional domains of PBC -40 
for participants receiving 40  mg BID linerixibat. Since sleep is only a single item in 
PBC -40 and sleep disturbance is a major complaint of PBC patients  with cholestatic 
pruritus , participant’ s sleep was also evaluated daily in the eDiary using an NRS scale 
and concordant improvements in itch and sleep were observed in GLIMMER.  The 
Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) has also been included to further assess the impact of 
itch relief on sleep and day time somnolence.  
This Phase 3 study will further investigate the efficacy and safety of 24 weeks of 40 mg 
BID oral linerixibat  with stable background itch therapy , if applicable , for the treatment 
of pruritus in PBC patients with moderate to severe cholestatic pruritus (Part A), as well 
as assess the return of itch over 8 -weeks  after withdrawal of 40  mg BID oral linerixibat 
compared to placebo (Part B). Participants enrolled in the study can take stable 
background itch therapy (if applicable) at the discretion of the physician in the best 
interest of the patient.  
2.2. Background  
2.2.1.  Overview of Disease  
Primary biliary cholangitis is a rare, chronic autoimmune disease characterized by 
granulomatous inflammatory destruction of intrahepatic bile ducts leading to intrahepatic 
cholestasis, retention of bile acids and other toxic metabolites, and eventual cirrhosis and 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol Amendment 04  
 40 liver failure. A combination of genetic risk factors and environmental exposures has been 
proposed for the etiology of PBC [Lindor , 2019 ].  
The major symptoms of PBC affecting QoL are cholestatic pruritus (itch) and fatigue 
[Lindor , 2019, Zakharia , 2018; Younossi , 2000 ]. While the origin of cholestatic pruritus 
in PBC is still unknown, it has long been suspected that some component of bile that 
accumulates in serum contributes to pruritus. Patients with clinically signifi cant pruritus 
fare worse than those with mild or no itch on all the QoL domains (fatigue, social, 
emotional, cognitive , and other symptoms) of the PBC -40, a disease specific health -
related quality of life instrument [Carey , 2020 ]. 
Overall, pruritus has been reported to affect almost three quarters of PBC patients at 
some time during their disease, but the prevalence of pruritus at any given point in time is 
around 50% [Hegade , 2014;  Hegade , 2019 ]. Recent observational studies report the 
prevalence of approximately 30% when restricted to m oderate to severe pruritus [Hegade , 
2014; Tanaka , 2016; Yagi , 2017; Carey , 2018; Hönig , 2018 ]. Intractable pruritus may be 
an indication for liver transplantation [Lindor , 2019 ].  
In clinical practice, response rates <50% are common for most of the guideline -
recommended therapies for cholestatic pruritus [Levy , 2011 ]. Bile acid sequestrants are 
recommended as first -line therapy in treatment guidelines for c holestatic pruritus in PBC, 
despite a limited evidence base and tolerability is often an issue [Lindor , 2019; EASL , 
2017; Komori , 2014 ; Chengwei , 2015 ]. Only one therapy, cholestyramine, is approved in 
the United States  [Questran USPI ] and China for pruritus associated with partial biliary 
obstruction and in Europe [Questran SmPC ] for pruritus associated with partial biliary 
obstruction and partial biliary cirrhosis . Reduction of serum bile acids t hrough ileal bile 
acid transporter ( IBAT ) inhibition is showing promise in treating pruritus in PBC and 
other cholestatic conditions  [Karpen , 2020 ]. 
2.2.2.  Background information on the product  
Linerixibat (also referred to as GSK2330672) is a soluble and selective inhibitor of the 
human ileal bile acid transporter (IBAT) [Wu, 2013 ], also known as apical sodium -
dependent bile acid transporter (ASBT), that is minimally absorbed from the GI tract. 
Linerixibat is being developed as a novel, oral treatment for cholestatic pruritus 
associated with PBC.  
Inhibition of the IBAT  by linerixibat decreases pruritic serum bile acids through fecal 
elimination [Hegade , 2017 ]. Linerixibat has demonstrated reduction in itch and potential 
for improvement in sleep and health -related quality of life (QoL) in cholestatic pruritus in 
PBC patients in both Phase 2a (BAT117213) and GLIMMER studies as described in the 
below sections and in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB).   
2.2.3.  Clinical Studies  
The effect of linerixibat on cholestatic pruritus in PBC was evaluated in the BAT117213 
study and the GLIMMER  dose-range finding study.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol Amendment 04  
 41 BAT117213 was a randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled 2 -period cross -over trial 
in which linerixibat was administered as 45 mg BID for the first 3 days and increased to 
90 mg BID on Day 4 of the randomized active treatment period. This study enrolled 
participants with severe pruritus and newly diagnosed or untreated pruritus who qualified 
based on disease sta tus and clinical symptoms.  Linerixibat treatment for 14 days resulted 
in significant reductions from baseline in itch intensity scores as measured by numerical 
rating scale ( NRS ), PBC -40 itch domain and 5 -D itch scale (p<0.0001 for all) in both 
treatment s equences after linerixibat treatment [Hegade , 2017 ]. Compared to the 
double -blind placebo treatment, linerixibat reduced itch intensity significantly more in  all 
three scales; between treatment differences were: –23% (95% CI, –1 to –45, p=0·0374) 
for NRS, –14% (95% CI, –1 to –26, p=0·0335) for PBC -40 itch domain, and –20% (95% 
CI, –7 to –34, p=0·0045) for 5 -D itch. This was accompanied by a significant reducti on 
in serum total bile acid concentrations of more than 50%, which was reversed within 
2 weeks of stopping linerixibat. In contrast, there was a 12% increase in serum total bile 
acid concentrations after placebo dosing. In this study, linerixibat also demo nstrated 
statistically significant improvements in the fatigue domain of PBC -40 and sleep 
interference following 14 days of treatment [Hegade , 2017 ]. In gen eral, linerixibat was 
well tolerated without SAEs. An equal number of AEs were reported during placebo and 
study intervention treatment periods. There was a 33% incidence of diarrhea reported as 
an adverse event while on linerixibat vs. 5% on placebo. The individual episodes tended 
to be mild in severity and short lived in the majority of cases. No subjects discontinued 
dosing or had their dose decreased secondary to diarrhea.  
The GLIMMER study was a randomized, double -blind parallel -group, dose -finding stu dy 
further evaluating linerixibat for the treatment of pruritus in patients with PBC. This 
study assessed the efficacy, safety , and tolerability, and assessed dose and dosing 
regimen (once vs. twice daily). Participants must have had proven PBC, rated thei r itch 
severity as being ≥ 4 on a 0 to 10 -point NRS for the majority of time during the 8 weeks 
prior to the screening visit, and on stable doses of ursodeoxycholic acid ( UDCA ) (or 
enrolled 8 weeks after their last dose of UDCA if not taking UDCA due to in tolerance). 
Eligible patients were randomized based on an NRS itch score of ≥ 3. Additionally, they 
could continue to receive therapies including anti-histamines, rifampicin, naltrexone, 
naloxone, nalfurafine  or sertraline for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in PBC 
provided the medications were maintained at stable doses with no plan to discontinue 
them during the study. Concomitant use of cholestyramine, colesev elam, colestimide or 
colestipol was not permitted until after completion of the treatment period.  
Participants were randomized to treatment with placebo or one of the five linerixibat 
doses of 20 mg, 90 mg, 180 mg once daily (QD), 40 or 90 mg BID for up to 12 weeks. 
Itch was measured morning and evening using an NRS anchored with 0 (no itching)  and 
10 (worst imaginable itching).  
Following the Screening period, there were four study periods: a 4 -week single -blind 
Run-in Period where all participants received placebo; a 12 -week Main Study Period 
where participants received double -blind treatment with placebo or linerixibat, a 4 -week 
Final Period where all participants received placebo, and a 2 -week follow -up period. The 
147 eligible participants were randomized based on Mean Worst Daily Itch Score (now 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol Amendment 04  
 42 referred to as the Weekly Itch Score in Study  2126 20 [GLISTEN]) of ≥3  (averaged over 
the 7 days prior to randomization) .  
Mean pruritus intensity scores were reduced (itch improved) at the end of the Main Study 
Period for all treatment groups including the place bo arm (please refer to IB S ection 
5.4.4). Due to the potential for itch to fluctuate over time, the change from Baseline in 
Monthly Itch Score (worst week of the month) over the entire treatment period was used 
to evaluate the duration and stability of treatment effect. A mixed -effect repe ated 
measure (MMRM) analysis of this endpoint thus utilized data across the whole 12 -week 
Main Study period (as opposed to an analysis using a single timepoint) and resulted in a 
statistically significant difference from placebo for 40  mg BID  (p=0.0105),  90 mg BID 
(p=0.0370) and 180  mg QD (p=0.0424) doses ( Figure 1).  
Figure 1 Difference from Placebo in change from baseline in Monthly Itch 
Score over the entire 12 -week treatment period (I ntend To Treat [ITT]  
population ) 
 
Note: Error bars show 95% Confidence Interval (CI).  
Furthermore, a rapid reduction of itch was observed for the 40 mg BID and 90 mg BID 
dosing groups compared t o placebo as early as Weeks 1 and 2 (data on file). Based on 
this observation, a secondary endpoint assessing change in Weekly  Itch Score at Week 2 
will be evaluated in the current study.  
In addition, within person change using the responder definition ( defined as ≥2 -point 
improvement in mean worst daily itch score [now referred to as Weekly Itch Score in the 
current 212620 (GLISTEN ) study ] from baseline ) provides interpretation for the primary 
endpoint in terms of clinical meaningfulness of the result. Percentage of itch responder 
days also favored BID dosing, with a mean increase of 20% for 40 mg  BID and 27% for 
90 mg BID groups relative to placebo  (Figure 2).

Note: Error bars show Standard Error (SE).  
Of note, among the total study population approximately 29% (42/147) had prior history 
of treatment with bile acid binding resins and 29% (42/147) of participants were 
receiving concomitant itch therapy during  the study . Neither prior treatment with bile 
acid binding resins nor concomitant treatment with pruritus t herapy  during the study  were 
significant after accounting for treatment groups in an analysis of covariates.  
Impact on health -related QoL was also evident following treatment with linerixibat. 
Improvement on sleep interference was highly correlated to improvement on itch score 
across all treatment groups (R=0.84 , data on file ).  
All arms including placebo showed significant improvement from baseline in the itch 
domain of PBC -40 but only the 40 mg BID dose demonstrated significant improvements 
from basel ine in the PBC -40 social and emotional domains.   
The most frequently reported drug -related AEs across all treatment groups were diarrhea 
and abdominal pain, with diarrhea demonstrating an increase of incidence with increasing 
dose (placebo 8%, 20 mg QD 31% , 90 mg QD 48%, 180 mg QD 59%, 40 mg BID 39%, 
90 mg BID 64%). Diarrhea and abdominal pain were also the AEs most frequently 
leading to study drug discontinuation across all treatment groups (10  participants and 
5 participants, respectively). The discontinu ation incidence due to diarrhea was lower in 
the 40  mg BID group (4%) compared to the 90 mg BID (1 4%) and 180  mg QD (1 9%) 
treatment groups. Diarrhea was mostly mild to moderate in severity, there were no SAEs 
related to diarrhea and no case of dehydration during the treatment period were observed.  
There were 3 SAEs which were all considered not related to study treatment (lumbar 
spinal stenosis 90 mg QD; lower respiratory tract infection 20 mg QD; constipation 
180 mg QD).    
No notable change from Baseline or difference from placebo was observed for Enhanced 
Liver Fibrosis (ELF) tests, liver function tests (LFTs), bone biochemistry or liposoluble

 44 vitamins across the treatment arms. There were no clinically significant patterns of 
abnormal vital sign measurem ents, ECG changes, or clinical laboratory findings 
observed.  
Overall, the 40 mg BID dose demonstrated significant improvement in pruritus over 
12 weeks of treatment, as well as significant change from baseline in the social and 
emotional domains of PBC -40. Gastrointestinal tolerability data also favored  40 mg BID 
dosing over higher doses.

genetically determined impairment of the 
enterohepatic re circulation of bile acids with an 
increased risk of gallbladder disease and 
cholecystectomy , but not with colorectal cancer  
[Campbell , 2018 ]. An additio nal pheWAS performed 
in up to 2.5 million European ancestry (EUR) 
23andMe cohort participants identified significant

47 Potential Risk of 
Clinical Significance  Summary of Data/Rationale for Risk  Mitigation Strategy  
• In the GLIMMER study, one participant in the 
linerixibat 90  mg BID group met the liver stopping 
criteria for ALT levels (reported as an AE of abnormal 
liver test) 60 days after receiving linerixibat. This 
even t resolved after a duration of 98 days. The 
investigator noted that the AE of abnormal liver test 
could have b een related to study medication and study 
medication was permanently discontinued. The 
participant had also experienced a non -serious AE of 
tooth abscess approximately 6 weeks prior, which 
resulted in tooth extraction and associated dental 
infection and wa s treated with amoxicillin and 
metronidazole antibiotics. Based on the information, 
there is a possibility that the concomitant antibiotics 
and painkillers may have contributed to the abnormal 
LFTs  (see the IB, Section 5.4.3).  
• Increased risk of 
colon cancer in 
association with 
increased fecal 
excretion of bile 
acids  • Although a theoretical association between increased 
colonic bile acids and colorectal cancer has been 
postulated there is no direct evidence of causa tion 
betwee n bile acids and the development of colon 
cancer  [Acosta , 2014 ].  
• Two large pheWAS  studies  in 379,337 and up  to 2.5 
million European ancestry participants respectively, 
did not suggest an association between genetically 
determined impairment of the enterohepatic

colore ctal cancer [Campbell , 2018, McLaughlin , 
2020]. These findings were also supported by a 
genome -wide association study (GWAS) in 58,131 
European ancestry cases [Huyghe , 2019 ]. The genetic 
findings were consistent with published long -term 
follow -up of participants with ileal bypass surgery, 
which did not support an effect of enterohepatic 
circulation on colon cancer risk [Buchwald , 1990 ].   
• No reports of colon cancer (or similar events) have 
been reported in the linerixibat  clinical program  (see 
IB, Section 6. 3.2.2 ). 
• Currently, the data suggests that there is no increase in 
risk of colorectal cancer in  patients receiving 
linerixibat for cholestatic pruritus in patients with PBC  
(see IB, Section 6.3.2.2) .

 49 2.3.2.  Benefit Assessment  
There may be a number of potential benefits of participating in this study including:  
• Potential improvement in symptoms of pruritus associated with PBC during 
intervention . 
• Medical evaluations/assessments associated with study procedures that assess 
participant’s PBC (e.g. , physical examinations, labor atory assessments).  
• Contribution to the process of developing new therapies for the treatment of pruritus 
associated with PBC.  
• Potential opportunity to participa te in a long-term stud y of linerixibat as defined in 
Section  6.7. 
2.3.3.  Overall Benefit: Risk Conclusion  
Taking into account the measures taken to minimize risk to participants participating in 
this study, the potential risks identified in association with  linerixibat are justified by the 
anticipated benefits that may be afforded to participants with PBC.  
3. OBJECTIVES AND ENDPO INTS/ESTIMANDS  
Itch will be recorded by participants twice daily u sing an eDiary as described in 
Section  8.2.1.1 . A 0 -10 NRS will be used, where 0 represents no itching and 10 the worst 
imaginable itching. Every morning the participant will record the worst itch experienced 
the night before and every evening, the participant will record the worst itch experienced  
that day. The itch scores for any day, week, and month will then be determined as 
follows:  
• Worst Daily Itch Score:  the worst of the two scores  recorded daily will be 
considered the score for that day  
• Weekly  Itch Score  (WIS) (formerly referred to as Mean Worst Daily Itch Score  
[MWDI] ): the average of the Worst Daily Itch Scores in one week  
• Monthly Itch Score:  the worst Weekly  Itch Score for that month (i.e., worst 
week  score of the 4 weeks)  
Cholestatic pruritus has a negative impact on health -related QoL for PBC patients. The 
PBC -40 is a disease -specific QoL instrument consisting of 6 domains: social, emotional, 
symptoms, fatigue, itch (including an item on sleep disturbance from itch domain) and 
cognitive. Results from the GLIMMER study demonstrated significant improvement 
from baseline in the social and emotional domains of PBC -40 for participants receiving 
40 mg BID linerixibat. There fore, this study will further evaluate the effect of linerixibat 
on PBC -40 domains. Since sleep is only a single item in PBC -40 and sleep disturbance is 
a major complaint of PBC patients, participant’s sleep will also be evaluated using the 
daily eDiary. P articipants will record a sleep interference score each morning using a 
0-10 NRS, where 0 represents no sleep interference and 10 represents complete sleep 
interference. For each week, the average of the Daily Sleep Score will be used to 
calculate the Week ly Sleep Score ( formerly referred to as Mean Daily Sleep Score). The

4. STUDY DESIGN  
4.1. Overall Design  
This study is a Phase 3, multicenter, 2 -part (Part A and Part B), randomized, 
doubl e-blind, placebo -controlled study in PBC patients with moderate to severe pruritus. 
Part A will evaluate the efficacy, safety , and impact on health -related quality of life of 
linerixibat with background itch therapy , if applicable , compared with placebo with 
background itch therapy , if applicable , over 24 weeks, while Part B will assess the return 
of itch over 8  weeks after withdrawal of linerixibat . Participants may be treatment naïve, 
have had prior itch therapy and/or may take stable background itch th erapy at the 
discretion of the physician in the best interest of the patient or rescue medication where 
applicable .   
This study will consist of four periods:  
• Screening Period (up to 56 days)  
At Screening Visit 1 (Visit 1), screening assessments will be performed as described in 
the Schedule of Assessments (SoA) ( Section  1.3). This will include a baseline itch 
evaluation in which the participant will be asked to rate their overall itch severity in the 
2 months preceding scr eening as described in S ection  8.2.1.1 . Participants will then enter 
the screening period during which participants must complete a symptom questionnaire 
in an electronic Diary (eDiary) for eligibility purposes which include itch and sleep NRS 
scores as defined in S ection  8.2.1.1 .  
Participants must also attend a second screening visit (Visit 2) to take place at least 
4 weeks after Visit 1, for further assessment of liver biochemistry. This is to ensure 
stability of liver disease and for participant safety and eligib ility purposes as described in 
Section  8.3.4.1 . 
• Intervention Period : Part A (Day 1 through Week 24)  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 55 Eligible participants will b e randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive linerixibat 40 mg 
BID in Part A  and Part B, linerixibat 40 mg BID in Part A and placebo in Part B, placebo 
in Part A and Part B, or placebo in Part A and linerixibat 40 mg BID in Part B.   
Randomization will be stratified by:  
• Severity of pruritus based on Monthly Itch Score for the 28 days preceding 
randomization:  
o Moderate: ≥ 4 and < 7  
o Severe: ≥ 7  
• Concomitant cholestatic pruritus treatment regimen (definitions of cholestatic 
pruritus treat ments can be found in the main protocol text):  
o Bile acid binding resin -containing regimen  
o Regimen that does not contain bile acid binding resins  
o No cholestatic pruritus treatment.  
Bile acid binding resins include cholestyramine, colesev elam, colestimide  and 
colestipol. Other cholestatic pruritus medications include antihistamines, 
fibrates , rifampicin, naltrexone, naloxone, nalfurafine, pregabalin, gabapentin or  
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs ). Please see further information 
on concomi tant medications in S ection  6.9. 
The region (US or rest of the world) and site categorized by whether the visits will be 
conducted fully remotely will serve as an administrative stratification factor. The primary 
analysis will not adjust for this administrative stratification factor. Furt her details will be 
provided in the SAP . 
The primary analysis will be performed when all randomized participants have completed 
the Part A intervention period (up to Week 24/Visit 9), as described in Section 9.4. The 
blinding strategy is described in Section 6.4. Part A is completed when the W eek 24 Visit 
(Visit 9) is completed.  
• Intervention Period: Part B (Week 24 through Week 32)  
Participants who had initially been taking linerixibat in Part A will either continue on 
linerixibat or switch to placebo at Week 24 for Part B. Participants who had been taking 
placebo in Part A will either continue on placebo or switch to linerixibat at Week 24 for 
Part B.  
Part B is completed at the completion of Week 32 Visit (Visit 11).  
• Follow up ( approximately 2 weeks)  
Participants who complete treatment in Part A and Part B will be offered the opportunity 
to take part in a separate long-term f ollow -on study as described in S ection  6.7. 
Participants who do not enter the follow -on study or are discontinued from study 
treatment but remain in the study will complete a follow -up telephone call approximately 
7-14 days after the last dose of linerixibat.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 56 The total expected duration of study participation for each participant is approximately 
40-42 weeks.  
Where applicable country and local regulations allow, some or all of the participant visits 
may be conducted remotely or via a virtual trial platform. Home he althcare services also 
may be utilized to support these activities where local regulations and infrastructure 
allow.  
Approximately 230 total participants with PBC and moderate to severe cholestatic 
pruritus are expected to be randomized into this study. Pa rticipants receiving concomitant 
bile acid binding resins may comprise up to approximately 15% of the overall total study 
population.  
Based on GLIMMER (201000) study, it is expected that at least 20% of participants in 
the study will be receiving  concomit ant itch therapy and/or have had prior itch therapy; 
patients entering the study have moderate to severe itch and as such these patients have 
not adequately responded to or are intolerant to available standard of care.  
An Independent Data Monitoring Commit tee (IDMC ) will be utilized to evaluate futility 
for the interim analysis planned fo r the study (please see S ection  9.5). Further detail on 
the IDMC will be provided in a separate charter.  
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design  
4.2.1.  Rationale for Study Blinding and Placebo Control  
This is a Phase 3, placebo -controlled study with a 24 -week double -blind Part A, followed 
by an 8 -week  double -blind Part B. Previous studies of IBAT inhibitors in PBC patients 
have demonstrated that patient -reported itch may show some improvement on placebo 
treatment [Hegade , 2017 ; Mayo , 2019 ]. A placebo arm is employed in the study to help 
determine the true clinical effect of linerixibat relative to background cholestatic prurit us 
treatment.  
4.2.2.  Rationale for Stratification Factors  
In order to balance the baseline itch score, treatment assignment for Randomization at 
Day 1 will be stratified according to the Monthly Itch Score during the 28 days before 
Day 1, using the categories: Moderate : Monthly Itch score ≥ 4 and < 7 ; Severe : Monthly 
Itch Score ≥ 7. 
Concomitant use of stable treatments for cholestatic  pruritus will be allowed (see 
Section  6.9.1 ), consistent  with published guidelines by A merican Association for the 
Study of Liver Diseases ( AASLD ) [Lindor , 2019 ], European Association for the Study of 
the Liver [EASL , 2017 ], Ministry of Health, Labor an d Welfare of Japan [Komori , 2014] 
and guidelines in China [Chengwei , 2015]. In order to balance the use of treatments for 
cholestatic pruritus, randomization will also be stratified by concomitant cholestatic 
pruritus treatment regimen (bile acid binding resin -containing regimen, regimen that does 
not contain  bile acid  binding resins , and no cholestatic pruritus treatment). Bile acid 
binding resins include  cholestyramine, colesev elam, colestimide and colestipol .  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 57 Other cholestatic pruritus medications include antihistamines, fibrates , rifampicin, 
naltrexone, naloxone, nalfurafine, pregabalin, gabapentin or SSRIs . Participants receiving 
concomitant bile acid binding resins may comprise up to 15% of the overall Phase 3  
study population.  
4.2.3.  Rationale for Part B  
The Intervention Period will start with Part A  (Day 1 through Week 24)  followed by Part 
B (Week 24 through Week 32).  Eligible participants will be randomized in a 1:1 :1:1 ratio 
to receive linerixibat 40 mg BID in Part A and Part B, linerixibat 40 mg BID in Par t A 
and placebo in Part B, placebo in Part A and Part B, or placebo in Part A and linerixibat 
40 mg BID in Part B . Therefore, participants who received placebo in Part A will either 
continue on placebo or switch to linerixibat  at Week 24 for Part B . Partic ipants who had 
received linerixibat in Part A will either continue on linerixibat or  switch to placebo at 
Week 24 for Part B . 
Based on results of the GLIMMER data, it is expected that participants switched from 
linerixibat in Part A to placebo in Part B wi ll have some return of their itch. The current 
8-week  randomized -withdrawal in Part B allows evaluation of what occurs once 
linerixibat  is removed compared to those who are maintained on  placebo  treatment in 
regard to itch, sleep, health -related QoL, and safety.  
4.2.4.  Rationale for Concomitant Medications  
Participants may be receiving concomitant therapy with UDCA or fibrates for treatment 
of PBC or with standard of care therapies for cholestatic pruritus, including bile acid 
binding resins, fibrates, rifampicin, naltrexone, naloxone, nalfurafine, pregabalin, 
gabapentin or SSRIs.  Any of these therapies, as well as other medications that may affect 
itch such as opioids, systemic corticosteroids, or antihistamines that may be prescribed 
for other indicati ons, must be stable, defined as no initiation, discontinuation, or dose 
changes within 8 weeks of Screening, during the Screening period and throughout the 
Intervention  (treatment)  period  of the study , including both Part A and Part B  (Please see 
Section  6.9.1 ). This is to ensure that evaluation of linerixibat’s effect on pruritus is not 
confounded by changes in background therapies that may affect itch.   
Eligible participants who are not re ceiving any standard of care therapies for cholestatic 
pruritus may participate in the study. For these participants only, if worsening pruritus 
develops then rescue medication (cholestyramine) may be permitted, provided they have 
been in the study for at least 12 weeks, a duration that was acceptable during the 
GLIMMER trial, and meet  additional itch criteria (see S ection  6.9.3 ). Participants  who 
are receiving background cholestatic pruritus therapy are not eligible for rescue 
medication and, changes in their cholestatic pruritus medications (initiation, 
discontinuation, or change in dose) at any time during the study will b e considered a 
protocol  violation as described in S ection  6.9.3 .  
Obeticholic acid (OCA) use is not permitted at any time during the study  due to its 
potential to confound assessment of efficacy and safety. OCA is approved for use in a 
subset of PBC  participants  with an inadequate response to or intolerance to UDCA  
[Ocaliva  US Prescribing Information,  and EU SmPC,  2021], and is associated with a dose  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 58 dependent exacerbation in pruritus leading to treatment discontinuation in 1 –10% of 
participants [EASL , 2017 ]. In Study 213688  evaluating pharmacokinetic drug-drug 
interaction with 5 and 10 mg O CA, linerixibat 40 mg BID demonstrated a 
protocol -defined meaningful reduction in total-OCA concentration . It is not 
recommended to co -administer linerixibat with OCA  (IB, Section 6.4.4).  
4.2.5.  Rationale for Use of Itch Numerical Rating Scale as the Primary 
Endpoint  
There are no well -established physical or physiological markers of treatment activity of 
pruritus associated with cholestatic liver disease that can be observed or measured. The 
rating of itch is subjective, and each participant is likely to have a distinc t response to 
treatment for cholestatic pruritus. The aim of treatment with linerixibat is to provide the 
symptomatic relief of pruritus associated with primary biliary cholangitis. Therefore, 
patient -reported outcomes (PRO) are the best way to measure a t reatment effect. Both the 
BAT117213 and the GLIMMER study reflected this, where individual participant 
responses clearly showed rapid and significant improvement of pruritus following 
linerixibat treatment using multiple PRO assessments [Hegade , 2017 ; data on file ].  
The Symptom Questionnaire, which includes the itch , sleep  and fatigue  NRS items 
(described in  Section  8.2.1.1 ), was developed by GSK with input from patients with PBC 
and psychometricians to detect the severity and variability of pruritus and associated 
symptoms, as well as the potential effects of treatment with the current standard of care 
on these symptoms. Th e itch and sleep NRS items assess symptoms that are relevant, 
important to, and well understood by PBC patients, and the patients are able to select 
responses that best reflect their disease experiences. NRS scales are widely used as a 
measure of severity as they are clear and simple and effective at measuring single 
constructs [Gries , 2017 ]. An external validation study was completed to collect 
quantitative da ta to assess the psychometric properties of the Mean Worst Daily Score 
(now referred to as  the Weekly Itch Score) , PBC -40, and Symptom Questionnaire and 
GSRS (GSK Health Outcomes Study 212144). The study along with analysis of the 
GLIMMER study provided ps ychometric validation of the PRO measures (0 -10 Worst 
Itch NRS item, Symptom Questionnaire, and the weekly version of the PBC -40) with 
input from PBC -related pruritic study subjects (data on file).  
4.2.6.  Rationale for Questionnaires  
Cholestatic pruritus in patie nts with PBC is a serious condition that causes significant 
impairment of day -to-day functioning, including fatigue, sleep disturbance, depression, 
and suicidality [Jin, 2016;  Hegade , 2016; Younossi , 2000; Hönig , 2018 ]. Participants will 
complete questionnaires in both Part A and Part B of the study in order to assess the 
impact on these parameters. The PBC -40 is a patient -derived, disease specific health -
related quality of life measure developed and va lidated for use i n PBC [Jacoby , 2005 ] as 
described in Section  8.2.1.2 .  
Since depressive symptoms are prevalent in PBC patients  [Shaheen , 2018] the BDI -II 
will assess symptoms of depression as described in Section  8.2.1.5 .  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 59 Cholestatic pruritus often interferes with sleep therefore participants will rate their sleep 
NRS in the eDiary and the ESS will assess daytime sleepiness as  described in 
Section  8.2.1.4 . 
GI symptoms are the most commonly reported adverse events associated with linerix ibat. 
The GSRS as described in S ection  8.2.1.3  will be used to systematically  evaluate 
gastrointestinal symptoms. Management of GI  symptoms should be based on adverse 
event reports (see Section  7.1.3 ). 
4.2.7.  Patient Input into Study Design  
A small group of 5 patients with PBC were interviewed to gain insights on key study 
design elements from the perspective of a potential study participant. Patients provided 
feedback on the placebo -controlled design and follow -on study and how those may 
impact their interest in participati ng, their ability to maintain daily diaries, take study 
intervention daily, and complete the other assessments ; overall study duration, and 
eligibility criteria.  
The patients provided feedback that more clarity was needed about excluded medications 
and st able background medication requirements. Patients also stated that it should be 
clarified that background medications would still be permitted throughout the study. This 
feedback has been incorporated into this protocol (as defined in Section  6.9.1 ) and will be 
incorporated along with other operational aspects as part of the SRM.  
4.3. Justification for Dose  
The dose to be included  in this 24 -week study will be linerixibat 40 mg BID based on the 
efficacy and tolerability results of the GLIMMER study and kinetic -pharmacodynamic 
(K-PD) modelling. In the GLIMMER study, doses of 20 mg once daily (QD), 90 mg QD, 
180 mg QD, 40 mg BID, and  90 mg BID were evaluated over a 12 -week, double -blind 
period. When comparing the mean change from baseline in the Monthly Itch Score over  
the 12 -week main study period, the doses of 40 mg and 90 mg BID and 180 mg QD were 
statistically different than place bo. The 40 mg BID dose trended with the greatest 
difference compared to placebo in Mean Worst Daily Itch score when considering the 
worst week of the month (Monthly Itch Score) as compared to 90 mg BID and 180  mg 
QD. Only 40 mg BID dose demonstrated signif icant improvements from baseline in the 
PBC -40 social and emotional domains. In addition to the dose -dependent decrease in 
Mean Worst Daily Itch scores, biomarkers of target engagement (serum C4 and FGF -19) 
measured in GLIMMER demonstrated a greater respon se with BID dosing as compared 
to QD dosing.  
There was a dose -dependent relationship with gastrointestinal -related adverse events with 
a greater rate of permanent discontinuation and poorer tolerability at the higher doses of 
study intervention (180 mg QD and 90 mg BID) compared to 40 mg BID. Common 
gastrointestinal -related AEs, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, 
all trended to favor the 40 mg BID dose as compared to the higher doses. The most 
frequently reported AE was diarrhea, whic h was mostly mild to moderate, there were no 
reported SAEs associated with diarrhea and no case of dehydration during the treatment 
period. There were no clinically significant consequences of diarrhea. These results 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 60 support the use of 40  mg BID in Phase 3 . Further details on dose rationale are available in 
the IB.  
4.4. End of Study Definition  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last participant in the 
study in the trial globally.  
A participant is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all 
phases of the study including the last visit. For participants that will enroll into a 
follow -on study this last visit is Week 32  or completion of any required follow -up. If the 
participant will not enroll in a follow -on study, this would include completion of the  
follow -up phone  call as shown in the SoA (see S ection  1.3) or any required follow -up. 
5. STUDY POPULATION  
Prospective approval of protocol deviations to recruitment and enrolment criteria, also 
known as protocol waivers or exemptions, is not permitted.  
5.1. Inclusion Criteria

elevations at the time of Screening is not required, recognizing that the ALP 
may have dec reased after initiation of UDCA therapy).  
• Documented positive anti -mitochondrial antibody (AMA) titer (>1:40 titer on 
immunofluorescence or M2 positive by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay 
[ELISA ] or by an alternative validated assay ) or PBC -specific antin uclear

  Protocol amendment 04  
 61 and have a Monthly Itch Score of  ≥4 (i.e., at least 1 of the 4 Weekly  Itch Scores 
must be ≥4), and no Weekly  Itch Score can be <3 for any other week.  
Contraceptive/Barrier Requirements   
4.  Contraceptive/Barrier Requirements (applicable for female participants only): A 
female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant or breastfeeding, and 
one of the following conditions applies:  
o Is a woman of non -childbearing potential (WONCBP)  
OR 
o Is a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) and using an acceptable 
contraceptive method as described in Section  10.4 during th e study intervention 
period (at a minimum until 4 weeks after the last dose of study intervention). 
The investigator should evaluate the potential for contraceptive method failure 
(e.g., noncompliance, recently initiated  in relationship to the first dose o f study 
intervention.  
• A WOCBP must have a negative highly sensitive urine pregnancy test (or serum as 
required by local regulations) within 7 days before the first dose of study 
intervention, see Section  8.3.5 , Pregnancy Testing.  
Note: If a serum pregnancy test is required  by local regulation s, sample collection 
must  be arranged before Visit 3 to ensure the result confirming eligibility can be  
available before randomization.  
o If a urine test cannot be confirmed as negative (e.g., an ambiguous result), a 
serum pregnancy test is required. In such cases, the participant must be excluded 
from participation if the serum pregnancy result is positive.  
• Additional requirements for preg nancy testing during and after study intervention are 
located in Section  8.3.5 . 
• The investigator is responsible for review  of medical history, menstrual history, and 
recent sexual activity to decrease the risk for inclusion of a woman with an early 
undetected pregnancy . 
Note: Contraceptive use by women  should be consistent with local regulations regarding 
the methods of contraception for those participating in clinical studies.

27. QTc >480 msec  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 64 Notes:  
The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Bazett’s formula 
(QTcB), Fridericia’s formula (QTcF), and/or another method. It is either mac hine-
read or manually over -read.  
The specific formula used to determine eligibility and discontinuation for an 
individual participant should be determined prior to initiation of the study and 
should be the only QT correction formula used during the study. In other words, 
several different formulas cannot be used to calculate the QTc for an individual 
participant and then the lowest QTc value used to include or discontinue the 
participant from the trial.  
Other Exclusions  
28. History of sensitivity or intolerance  to the study treatment or components thereof or a 
history of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK 
Medical Monitor, contraindicates their participation in the study.  
29. Subjects with moderate (or greater) alcohol consumption defined as one standard  
drink per day for women and two drinks per day for men; whereby one standard  
drink is equivalent to: 12 oz beer (5% alcohol); 5 ounces of wine (12% alcohol), or 
1.5 ounces of 80 proof spirits  (40% alcohol).  
5.3. Lifestyle Considerations  
5.3.1.  Meals and Dietary Restrictions  
There are no specific dietary restrictions required for participation in the study. 
Laboratory samples should be taken in a fasted state; no food is permitted 6 hours prior to 
sample collection, though water, study interventi ons and other medications are permitted.  
Dosing of study intervention should be taken at least 30 minutes before  food or beverage 
(other than water) for both the morning and evening doses to ensure optimal efficacy.  
5.3.2.  Caffeine, Alcohol, and Tobacco  
• Participants should abstain from alcohol for 24 hours prior to laboratory samples 
being taken and should not consume one standard  drink or more per day for women 
and two drinks or more per day for men  whereby one standard drink is equivalent  to 
12 oz beer (5% alcohol), 5 oz of wine (12% alcohol), or 1.5 oz of 80 proof spirits 
(40% alcohol).  
5.3.3.  Activity  
• Participants will abstain from strenuous exercise for 48 hours before each blood 
collection for clinical laboratory tests. For the duration of the study, until  final follow 
up, participants are encouraged to refrain from changing their activity beyond that 
which they normally perform.

  Protocol amendment 04  
 65 5.4. Screen Failures  
Screen failures are defined as participants who consent to participate in the clinical study 
but are not subsequently randomized  in to the study . A minimal set of screen failure 
information is required to ensure transparent reporting of screen failure participants to 
meet the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) publishing 
requirements and to respond to queries from regulatory authorities. Minimal information 
includes demography, screen failure details, eligibility criteria, any protocol deviations 
and any SAEs.  Information on prior and current treatment for cholestatic pruritus may 
also be col lected for screen failures to provide information on/insight into the treatment 
history of the PBC population with pruritus.  
In the case of COVID -19 diagnosis during the Screening period, the decision whether to 
continue screening the participant will be a t the discretion of the investigator.  
Individuals who do not meet the criteria for participation in this study (screen failure) 
may be rescreened one time at the Investigator’s discretion. The participant may be 
rescreened one additional time in consultation with the GSK Medical Monitor. The 
second rescreening must be approved in writing by the GSK M edical Monitor. 
Rescreening decisions should be documented to indicate that rescreening the participant 
will not introduce additional risk factors and  will not interfere with study procedures or 
ability to interpret results.  
The interval between screening visits for the same participant should be a minimum of 
1-week. Rescreened participants should be assigned a new participant number  for every 
screening /rescreening even t. Previously assigned participant numbers are to be recorded 
in the participants’ electro nic CRF ( eCRF ).

site pharmacists) , and the S ponsor are blinded to study intervention.  
The primary analysis will be performed when all randomized participants have completed 
the Part A intervention period (up to Week 24/Visit 9), as described in  Section  9.4; at 
which point the study will become partially unblinded (core sponsor team unblinded, site 
blinded).  GSK personnel involved in direct communication with the study 
sites/investigators continuing on Part B of GLISTEN will remai n blinded to the 
randomized treatment assignment of individual participants in the study . The results of 
the primary analysis will not be disseminated to  site personnel, investigators  (except for  
the one investigator signatory  of the clinical study report (CSR ), under confidentiality) , or 
study  participants until the study (including Part B) is fully completed and the study is 
fully unblinded. All efforts will be taken to protect site facing sponsor personnel and site 
personnel from unblinding, which is described in a separate blinding plan. No impact on 
trial integrity is expected.  
Individual participant -level, de -identified (not associated with participant number), and 
unblinded exploratory biomarker (TSBA) and tolerability data (AEs of diarrhea and 
GSRS scores) will be analyzed prior to unblinding the study for population K -PD model 
development. Independent sponsor programmers and clinical pharmacology modeling 
and simulation (CPMS) analysts will have access to actual randomization and dosing 
informati on. In addition to the dosing information and pharmacodynamic ( PD) endpoint 
records, variables to be investigated as predictive covariates in the K -PD models such as 
demographics, concomitant medication data, safety laboratory data, and exploratory 
biomark er concentrations (e.g. C4, FGF -19, autotaxin) at one or more timepoints (e.g., 
prior to the final analysis) throughout the study will be made available. Individuals 
unblinded early will have no involvement in the study conduct including any analysis of 
blinded PRO data described in Section  9.4.5 . Procedures are described in a separate 
blinding plan, and no impact on trial i ntegrity is expected.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 68 The IWRS will be programmed with blind -breaking instructions. In case of an 
emergency, the investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unblinding of a 
participant ’s intervention assignment is warranted. Participant saf ety must always be the 
first consideration in making such a determination. If the investigator decides that 
unblinding is warranted, the investigator should make every effort to contact GSK prior 
to unblinding a participant’s intervention assignment unless  this could delay emergency 
intervention for the participant. If a participant’s intervention assignment is unblinded , 
GSK must be notified within 24 hours of this occurrence. The date and reason why the 
blind was broken  must be recorded.  
A participant wil l be withdrawn from study intervention if the participant’s intervention 
code is unblinded by the investigator or treating physician, however the participant will 
be asked to remain in the study and complete all remaining study visits. The primary 
reason for discontinuation (the event or condition which led to the unblinding) will be 
recorded in the eCRF.  
GSK’s Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff may unblind the 
intervention assignment for any participant with an SAE. If the SAE requires that an 
expedited regulatory report be sent to one or more regulatory agencies, a copy of the 
report, identifying the participant’s intervention assignment, may be sent to investigators 
in accordance with local regulations and/or GSK policy.  
6.5. Study  Intervention Compliance  
• When participants self -administer study intervention(s) at home, they will be 
required to document administration of study treatment in a daily eDiary.  
Compliance with study treatment will be assessed by the number of returned tabl ets 
confirmed by site staff at each visit and supported by  the medication  eDiary  data. 
Compliance will be documented in the source documents and eCRF. Deviations that 
impact overall compliance with  the prescribed dosage regimen should be recorded.  
• A record  of the quantity of linerixibat dispensed to and administered by each 
participant must be maintained and reconciled with study intervention and 
compliance records. Intervention start and stop dates, including dates for intervention 
delays and/or dose reduc tions will also be recorded.  
6.6. Dose Modification  
No modification of individual participant’s study intervention dose is permitted.  
6.7. Continued Access to Study Intervention after the End of the 
Study  
The sponsor will not provide treatment after the end of the study. However, participants 
who complete treatment in Part A and Part B will be given the opportunity to take part in 
an open -label, long -term follow -on study assessing safety  and tolerability  (and efficacy in 
participants transferring from this study),  where linerixibat will be provided in an open -
label manner. This follow on study is expected to continue for approximately four years 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 69 until study end, linerixibat can be lawfully made available to participants, or the study is 
terminated.  
Participants who wish to take part in this or any further follow -on studies must provide 
separate consent to those studies and meet the study -defined eligibility criteria.  
6.8. Treatment of Overdose  
For this study, any  dose of linerixibat greater than 180 mg (greater than 4 tablets ) per day 
will be considered an overdose.  
GSK does not recommend specific treatment for an overdose .  
In the event of an overdose, the investigator should:  
1. Contact the Medical Monitor immediat ely. 
2. Closely monitor the participant for AE/SAE and laboratory abnormalities until 
linerixibat can no longer be detected systemically . 
3. Obtain a plasma sample for PK analysis within 24 -72 hour from the date of the last 
dose of study intervention if requeste d by the Medical Monitor (determined on a 
case-by-case basis).  
4. Document the quantity of the excess dose as well as the duration of the overdosing in 
the eCRF.  
5. Decisions regarding dose interruptions or modifications will be made by the 
investigator in consu ltation with the Medical Monitor based on the clinical 
evaluation of the participant.  
6.9. Concomitant Therapy  
Any medication or vaccine (including over the counter or prescription medicines, 
recreational drugs, vitamins, and/or herbal supplements) or other spe cific categories of 
interest that the participant has received in the 12 weeks prior to screening, is receiving at 
the time of enrolment or receives during the study must be recorded in the eCRF  along  
with:  
• reason for use  
• dates of administration including  start and end dates  
• dosage information including dose, route and frequency  
The Medical Monitor should be contacted if there are any questions regarding 
concomitant or prior therapy.  
6.9.1.  Permitted Medications  
Details concerning reasons for taking medications must be recorded in the eCRF for all 
concomitant medications whether prescription or non -prescription, including topical 
agents.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 70 Guidance for permitted agents that may be used in the study population, provided all 
details are recorded in the eCRF, are prov ided below, however this list is not exhaustive 
and further concomitant medications should be discussed with the Medical Monitor:  
• Colchicine, methotrexate, azathioprine, or systemic corticosteroids:  If there 
is a clinical need to start one of these medications during the study, it should be 
discussed with the medical monitor wherever possible. During Follow -Up 
Period systemic corticosteroids may be permitted.   
• Anti -diarrheals : Participants experiencing diarrhea , in consultation with the 
Investigator,  may take anti -diarrheal treatments (loperamide  or suitable local 
alternative as agreed by the Medical Monitor ) obtained over the counter. Use of 
these treatments and their effect will be recorded at each review of concom itant 
medications (please see  Secti on 7.1.3 ). 
Concomitant therapy for PBC or any medications that may affect itch as shown below are 
permitted but must be stable prior to Screening and  throughout the Screening and 
Treatment Periods (i.e. no treatments in these categories may be initiated, 
discontinued or dose changed in the 8 weeks prior to Screening and throughout the 
study).   
• UDCA:  Participants may  be enrolled in the study on UDCA provided the dosing 
regimen is consistent with product labelling. Deviations from product labelling 
are permitted if medically necessary as judged by the Investigator. The UDCA 
dosing regimen must remain stable during the study  
• Bile acid binding resin medications:  Dosing of bile acid binding resin 
medications such as cholestyramine, colesevelam, colestipol or colestimide 
should be altered so that dosing is separated from the study intervention 
(linerixibat) by at least 4 ho urs for the duration of study participation.  
• Rifampicin, naltrexone, naloxone, nalfurafine, gabapentin , pregabalin : Use 
of these agents is permitted during the study.  
• Fibrates : Use of these agents is permitted during the study.   
• Selective Serotonin Reupta ke Inhibitors (SSRIs): Use of these agents is 
permitted during the study.  
• Opioid Medications: Use of these agents is permitted during the study.  
• Antihistamines (topical or systemic): Antihistamines may not be initiated for 
the treatment of itch, but antihi stamines used regularly in the two months before 
screening may be continued without change in dose. Antihistamines used 
acutely for indications other than itch (e.g. for treatment of acute allergic 
reactions ) may be initiated, discontinued, or dose changed  as needed.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 71 6.9.2.  Prohibited Medications  
Other IBAT inhibitors : Use of any IBAT inhibitor except for the study intervention, is 
not permitted at any time during the study.  
Obeticholic acid : Use is not permitted at any time during the study. Obeticholic acid 
should not have been used for at least 8 -weeks prior to the screening visit. 
6.9.3.  Rescue Medication  
Rescue medication is permitted only for participants who are not receiving background 
cholest atic pruritus t reatment  when entering the study. If a participant reports 
experiencing worsening itch and requests rescue therapy, it may be considered only after 
12 weeks of randomized treatment. Rescue medication may be considered if either of the 
follow ing criteria are met:  
1. Monthly itch score at or after Week 12 (Visit 6) has increased by at least 2 points 
compared to baseline AND is ≥ 7  
OR  
2. For participants with a baseline Monthly Itch Score > 8 Monthly itch score at or 
after Week 12 (Visit 6) is 10  
Once these criteria have been satisfied, the investigator may offer  treatment with 
cholestyramine to the participant per treatment guidelines. Any use of rescue medications 
will be recorded in the eCRF.  
7. DISCONTINUATION OF S TUDY INTERVENTION AN D 
PARTICIPANT DI SCONTINUATION/WITHDR AWAL  
No replacement is planned for participant s who  discontinu e/withdraw from the study.  
7.1. Discontinuation of Study Intervention  
In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue study 
intervention. In all cases, the participant should be encouraged to discuss any potential 
study intervention discontinuation with the investigator prior to stopping study 
intervention.   
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or may be 
withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the investigator for safety, behavioral, 
compliance or administ rative reasons as described in Section  7.2. If study intervention is 
permanently discontinued following randomization and before the scheduled follow up, 
participants should not be withdrawn from the study and should complete the remaining 
scheduled visits and all required assessments, i ncluding the patient -reported Symptom 
Questionnaire and all other PRO assessments . Exploratory biomarkers, PK , and 
medication diaries are not required to be completed for participants remaining on the 
study but withdrawn from study treatment.  Participants who have been withdrawn from 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 72 study treatment but will remain in the study will not be required to complete an Early 
Discontinuation Visit but should complete a follow -up phone call 7 -14 days after last 
dose of study treatment.  
If the particip ant is withdrawing from the study, they will be encouraged to complete 
Early Disconti nuation Visit (please refer to S ection  1.3, SoA) before  their last dose of 
study intervention if possible. Table 1 below outlines the scenarios for participant 
discontinuation and the assessments required to be performed.   
Table 1 Scenarios for Participant Discontinuation

last dose of study treatment, additional 
follow -up phone call s are not required  
 
7.1.1.  Liver Chemistry Monitoring/Discontinuation Criteria  
Liver chemistry increased monitoring and stopping criteria have been designed to assure 
participants’ safety and evaluate liver event etiology.  
Particip ants will be informed on the signs and symptoms of potential liver injury such as 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, dark yellow urine, yellow eyes, or 
skin, or persistent fatigue, and report such symptoms immediately to the study center, 
even after the study has been concluded. The monitoring/discontinuation criteria outlined 
in the following sections should be used for participant monitoring.  
7.1.1.1.  Increased monitoring:  
Increased safety monitoring is required under the circumstances listed belo w. The 
baseline  defined below is described in S ection  8.3.4.1 . 
• Participants with normal  baseline liver indices who develop elevations of  any of 
the following :  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 73 o ALT  ≥3x ULN   
o AST  ≥3x ULN  
o Total bilirubin ≥2x ULN  
o ALP ≥2x ULN  and GGT ≥ 2x ULN  
• Participants with abnormal baseline liver indices who develop elevations of  any 
of the following : 
o ALT  ≥2x baseline  
o AST  ≥2x baseline  
o Total bilirubin ≥1.5x baseline  
o ALP ≥2x baseline  and GGT ≥2x baseline  
In the event of abnormal laboratory parameters as described above, repeat testing should 
be performed within 48 -72 hours. If there are persistent elevations upon repeat testin g of 
any of the criteria defined above , then close observation (see S ection  7.1.1.3 ), and study 
intervention discontinua tion should be considered (see  Section  7.1.1.2 ).  
7.1.1.2.  Stopping criteria  
Study intervention will be stopped (permanently or temporarily) for a participant if any of 
the following stopping criteria are met:  
• AST ≥8x ULN  
• ALT ≥8x ULN  
• ALT ≥3x baseline and ≥5x ULN  
• AST ≥3x baseline and ≥5x ULN  
• ALT≥3x ULN and INR > 1.5 and the participant is not receiving anticoagulants 
(if normal at baseline)  
• AST ≥3x ULN and INR > 1.5 and the participant is not receiving anticoagulants 
(if normal at baseline)  
• ALT≥2x BL and INR > 1.5 and the participant is not receiving anticoagulants (if 
abnormal at baseline)  
• AST ≥2x BL and INR > 1.5 and the participant is not receiving anticoagulants 
(if abnormal at baseline)  
• Total bilirubin ≥2x baseline and ≥1.5x ULN  
• Total bilirubin ≥3x ULN  
• ALP ≥2x ULN and GGT ≥2x ULN (if nor mal at baseline) or ALP  ≥2x baseline 
and GGT ≥2x baseline  (if abnormal at baseline) AND either : total bilirubin ≥2x 
baseline  and ≥2x ULN , or direct bilirubin ≥2x baseline and ≥2x ULN , or new or 
worsening of liver -related symptoms *.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 74 • If there are liver chemistry elevations which, in the opinion of the investigator, are 
not attributable to the participant’s underlying PBC, or if there is worsening liver 
chemistry associated with appearance of new liver-related symptoms .  
*Liver -related s ymptoms,  which may typically be associated with drug -induced liver 
injury,  include  fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, 
rash, worsening pruritus and/or eosinophilia [>5 %]. 
When liver stopping criteria are met, the stud y intervention should be immediately 
discontinued . Additional procedures and safety f ollow up will be required (see 
Section  10.6, Appendix 6 ) and close observation should be implemented (see 
Section  7.1.1.3 ). 
The GSK Medical Monitor must be notified within 24 hours of learning of the 
abnormality to confirm the participant’s study intervention cessation and follow -up.  
Upon completion of the liver safety follow -up, restart of study intervention ( where there 
is a clear  underlying  non-Drug Induced Liver Injury [D ILI] cause for the event) may be 
considered as outlined in S ection  7.1.9.1 . 
In all instances where study intervention is stopped due to meeting protocol -specified 
liver stopping criteria or investigator concern about possible deterioration in liver 
function, a  formal adjudication of causality will be requested from the Hepatotoxicity 
Safety Panel. Details of this panel and the process of review will be provided in a 
separate charter.  
7.1.1.3.  Close Observation  
If elevations persist upon repeat testing for participants w ho meet monitoring criteria or 
any participants who meet stopping criteria, the investigator should consult the medical 
monitor and the following ongoing monitoring should be performed:  
• Liver function tests (including AST, ALT , ALP , and direct bilirubin) s hould be taken 
two to three times weekly. Frequency of retesting can decrease to once a week or 
less if abnormalities stabilize or the study intervention has been discontinued and the 
subject is asymptomatic.  
• Obtaining additional tests to evaluate liver fu nction, including international 
normalized ratio (IN R) as appropriate.  
• Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases.    
• Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medications and 
herbal and dietary supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets.    
• Rule out acute viral hepatitis types A, B, C, D, and E; autoimmune or alcoholic 
hepatitis; Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis ( NASH ); hypoxic/ischemic hepatopathy; and 
biliary tract disease.    
• Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.    
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 75 7.1.2.  Hepatic Encephalopathy  
Study intervention should be discontinued if the participant develops new clinically overt 
hepatic encephalopathy as per investigator clinical assessment against the published 
Westhaven 1 -4 criteria [Vilstrup , 2014 ]. Under these circumstances, the liver event form 
should be completed in the eCRF, and the participant should be assessed for potential 
precipitants of encephalopathy.  
Study intervention can only be considered for restart following discussio n with the 
Medical Monitor if an alternative (non -liver-related) cause of cognitive dysfunction is 
diagnosed and the episode is fully resolved and, in the investigator’s opinion unlikely to 
recur.  
7.1.3.  Diarrhea Management Criteria and Stopping Criteria  
Diarrhea is an anticipated pharmacologic effect of linerixibat due to the increase in bile 
acid concentration in the colon and may be clinically similar to bile acid diarrhea. The 
most common clinical characteristics of bile acid diarrhea are loose (rarely  watery) 
stools, stools without blood, and stools that are associated with urgency.  
Participants will be informed about diarrhea and will be instructed to contact the 
investigator if, at any time during the study, they are experiencing diarrhea that impac ts 
their daily activities . In this study, the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE), currently in version 5, will be used to quantitate the severity of diarrhea  as 
well as the standard A E intensity grading defined in S ection  10.3.4 . This standard tool 
was initially developed by the National Cancer Institute.  
When study participants are experiencing diarrhea th at is impacting their daily activities, 
investigators should instruct participants to use anti -diarrheal (loperamide or suitable 
local alternative as agreed by the Medical Monitor)  for treatment (Details to be provided 
separately). Management of diarrhea w ith loperamide  (or suitable local alternative as 
agreed by the Medical Monitor) following inhibition of IBAT has been previously 
described in the literature [Key, 2020] which supports its use in this study.  
7.1.3.1.  Determination of diarrhea severity  
Diarrhea severity is determined in the context of normal stool frequency. At baseline, 
participants will be asked to describe their normal daily stool count and if they are 
currently experiencing diarrhea that is impacting their daily act ivities. This baseline stool 
frequency will be recorded for reference and calculation of diarrhea severity if needed 
and as described in the SRM.  
Participants should be asked about their experience with diarrhea at each visit as part of 
ongoing AE/SAE rev iew. Diarrhea will be considered an AE of special interest (AESI) 
and will be recorded on a specific AESI eCR F page. AESIs are described in 
Section  8.4.7 . 
Diarrhea severity will be assessed using the standard criteria in S ection  10.3.4  and using 
CTCAE 5 criteria (as found in Table 2) in reference to their baseline stool frequency as 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 76 mentioned above. For Activities of Daily Living (ADL) please se e Section  10.9, 
Appendix 9. 
Table 2 CTCAE 5 Severity Scale for Diarrhea  
 
Diarrhea sh ould be managed as detailed in Section  7.1.3.2  and further details will be 
provided in the SRM.  
7.1.3.2.  Stopping Criteria for Diarrhea (Grade 3 or 4)  
The criteria for decisions to permanently or temporarily discontinue study are shown in 
Table 3, as determined by t he CTCAE criteria mentioned in S ection  7.1.3.1 , 
Determination of diarrhea severity . 
Table 3 Study Intervention Actions for Severe Diarrhea (CTCAE 5 criteria)  
Study Intervention action  Symptom Severity  
Temporary Discontinuation  Grade 3 diarrhea  
Permanent Discontinuation  ≥ Grade 4 diarrhea  
 
Participants who have study intervention temporarily discontinued will be managed as 
clinically indicated until the participant returns to no more than Grade 2 diarrhea 
symptoms (i.e., ≤6 stools per day above baseline); at which time the study intervention 
may be restarted.  
Study intervention may be permanently discontinued, at the investigator’s discretion.  
7.1.4.  QTc Stopping Criteria  
The same QT correction formula must be used for each indiv idual participant to 
determine eligibility for and discontinuation from the study. This formula may not be 
changed or substituted once the participant has been enrolled.  
• For example, if a participant is eligible for the protocol based on QTcB, then QTcB 
must be used for discontinuation of this individual participant as well.  
• Once the QT correction formula has been chosen for a participant’s eligibility, the 
same formula must continue to be used for that participant for all QTc data being 
collected for dat a analysis.   
Safety ECGs and other non -protocol specified ECGs are an exception. The QTc should 
be based on a single QTc value of a n ECG obtained over a brief (e.g., 5 -10 minute) 
recording period. If an automated reading is not available, the ECG should b e manually 

TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 77 over-read by the investigator or adequately trained physician. A participant who meets 
either of the criteria based on the single ECG reading will be withdrawn from study 
intervention:   
 
• QTc ≥530 msec AND /OR increase  from  baseline of QTc >60 ms ec 
 
7.1.5.  Renal Stopping Criteria  
A participant’s study intervention will be discontinued if the confirmed eGFR is <30 
mL/min/1.73m2 based on the CKD -EPI equation at any time during the study.  
The investigator should consult with designated sponsor personnel  regarding the potential 
for restarting study intervention. If medical input is required, the Medical Monitor will be 
consulted for guidance.  
7.1.6.  Diagnosis of Colon Cancer  
Participants who are diagnosed with colon cancer at any point  in the study  will be 
perma nently discontinued from study intervention.  
7.1.7.  Pregnancy  
Female participants who become pregnant during the study should discontinue study 
intervention immediately.  
7.1.8.  Temporary Discontinuation due to AEs  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally 
associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the 
study intervention (see Section  10.3, Appendix 3 ).  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE reported during the 
study as described in Section  10.3, Appendix 3 .  
For diarrhea AEs only, an assessment  should also be made  using the CTC AE v5 criteria 
as described in S ection  7.1.3.1 .  
In cases where participants discontinue study intervention due to an AE, the investigator 
should consult wi th the Medical Monitor to determine the appropriate evaluation and 
guidance on whether study intervention may be re -started.  
7.1.9.  Restart of Study Intervention  
7.1.9.1.  Study Intervention Restart after Meeting Liver Stopping Criteria  
Restart refers to resuming study intervention following liver stopping events in which 
there is a clear underlying cause (other than DILI) of the liver event (e.g. , biliary 
obstruction, pancreatic events, hypotension, acute viral hepatitis). Furthermore, restart is 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 78 not permitted following  liver stopping event when the underlying cause was 
alcohol -related hepatitis.  
Approval by GSK for participants to restart study intervention may be considered where:  
o Investigator requests consideration for study intervention restart if liver chemistries 
have a clear underlying cause (e.g., biliary obstruction, hypotension and liver 
chemistries have improved to normal or are within 1.5x baseline and ALT <3x ULN).  
o Possible study intervention -induced liver injury has been excluded by the principal 
investigato r and the study team. This includes the absence of markers of 
hypersensitivity (otherwise unexplained fever, rash, eosinophilia).  
o There is no evidence of alcohol -related hepatitis.  
o IRB/IEC approval of study intervention restart must be obtained, as requir ed. 
o The participant is informed of any associated risks of restart and a separate ICF for 
study intervention restart is signed by the participant  
• If restart of study intervention is approved by GSK in writing:  
o The participant must be provided with a clear  description of the possible benefits and 
risks of study intervention administration, including the possibility of recurrent, more 
severe liver injury or death.   
o The participant must also provide signed informed consent specifically for the study 
interven tion restart. Documentation of informed consent must be recorded in the 
study file.   
o Study intervention must be administered at the dose specified by GSK.  
o Participants approved by GSK for restart of study intervention must return to the 
clinic once a week for liver chemistry tests until stable liver chemistries have been 
demonstrated and then laboratory monitoring may resume as per protocol.  
o If participant meets protocol -defined liver chemistry stopping criteria after study 
intervention restart, study intervention should be permanently discontinued.  
o GSK Medical Monitor, and the I nstitutional Review Board (I RB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee ( IEC) must be info rmed of the participant’s outcome following study 
intervention restart.  
o GSK must be notified of any adverse events.  
7.2. Participant Discontinuation/Withdrawal from the Study  
• A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request for any  
reason (or without providing any reason) .  
• A participant may be discontinued/withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the 
investigator for the occurrence of any condition that, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, significantly jeopardizes the wellbeing and safety of the participant 
(including ser ious or intolerable AE that prevents the participant from continuing 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 79 with study participant). Discontinuation/withdrawal may also occur at the discretion 
of the investigator for any behavioral  or compliance reasons. It is expected that these 
situations wil l be uncommon.  
• At the time of discontinuation from the study, if possible, an early termination visit 
should be conducted as soon as possible, as shown in the SoA (Section  1.3). See SoA 
for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow -up and for 
any further evaluations that need to be completed.  
• The participant will be permanently discontinued both from the study interv ention 
and from the study at that time.  
• All data and samples collected up to and including the date of withdrawal of/last 
contact with the participant will be included in the study analysis. If the participant  
withdraws consent for disclosure of future inf ormation, the sponsor may retain and 
continue to use any data collected before such a withdrawal of consent.  
• If a participant withdraws from the study, he/she may request destruction of any 
samples taken and not tested, and the investigator must document t his in the site 
study records.  
• Participants may be withdrawn from study intervention but encouraged to continue 
participation in the study (including collection of PRO /eDiary  data) as described in  
Section  7.1. 
7.3. Lost to Follow Up  
A participant  will be considered lost to follow -up if he or she repeatedly fails to return for 
scheduled visits and is unable to be contacted by the study site.  
The following actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a 
required study visit:  
The site must attempt to contact the participant and reschedule the missed visit as soon as 
possible and counsel the participant on the importance of  maintaining the assigned visit 
schedule and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and/or should continue in 
the study.  
• Before a participant is deemed lost to follow up, the investigator or designee 
must make every effort to regain contact wit h the participant (where possible, 3 
telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known 
mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be 
documented in the participant’s medical record.  
• Should  the participant continue to be unreachable, he/she will be considered to 
have withdrawn from the study.  
Discontinuation of specific sites or of the study as a whole are handled as part of 
Appendix 1 .

 80 8. STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
• Study procedures and their timings are summarized in the SoA (see S ection  1.3).  
• Protocol waivers or exemptions are not allowed  
• Where applicable country and local regulations and infrastructure for home 
healthcare allow, home healthcare may take place at a location other than the clinical 
trial site to perform study assessments (at the discretion of the investigator). The site 
may work with GSK to use a centrally appointed home nursing vendor for conduct of 
study assessments. Please refer to Section  10.8 for further details o n home healthcare 
availabilit y. 
• Immediate safety concerns should be discussed with the sponsor immediately upon 
occurrence or awareness to determine if the participant should continue or 
discontinue study intervention.  
• Adherence to the study design require ments, including those specified in the SoA 
(Section  1.3), is essential and required for study conduct.  
• All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that potential 
participants meet all eligibility criteria. The investig ator will maintain a screening log 
to record details of all participants screened and to confirm eligibility or record 
reasons for screening failure, as applicable.  
• Procedures conducted as part of the participant’s routine clinical management (e.g., 
blood  count) and obtained before signing of ICF may be utilized for screening or 
baseline purposes provided the procedure met the protocol -specified criteria and was 
performed within the time frame defined in the SoA.  
• Laboratory results that could unblind the s tudy will not be reported to investigative 
sites or other blinded personnel.  
• The maximum amount of blood collected from each participant over the duration of 
the study, including any extra assessments that may be required, will not exceed 500  
mL. 
• Repeat or  unscheduled samples may be taken for safety reasons or for technical 
issues with the samples.  
8.1. Admin istrative  Procedures  
8.1.1.  Collection of demographic data  
Demographic data such as year of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity will be recorded in the 
participant’s e CRF.  
Collection of sex, race and ethnicity data is necessary to assess and monitor the diversity 
of the trial participants , and to determine if the trial participants  are truly representative  of 
the impacted population.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 81 8.2. Efficacy Assessments  
An eDiary will be used to electronically collect a number of PRO s as described in this 
section. All participants will receive sufficient training on PRO completion using 
electronic devices.  
The SoA (S ection  1.3) defines the timepoints and visits at which PROs are to be 
collected.   
8.2.1.  Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs)  
8.2.1.1.  Symptom Questionnaire /eDiary  
A symptom questionnaire will be used to measure impact of lineri xibat on itch, sleep , and 
fatigue as described below.  In addition, the eDiary will prompt participants to record 
whether they are taking the  study treatment, and details of any missed doses.  
Itch Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)  
Itch will be assessed throughout this study using an NRS scale. At the screening visit 
(Visit 1) itch severity will be assessed retrospectively based on participant recall. The 
participant will be asked to rate their overall itch severity in the 2 months p receding 
screening to establish whether their baseline itch is severe enough prior to entering the 
screening period.  
Following the Screening Visit (Visit 1), participants will enter the Screening period and 
begin completing the eDiary to establish their baseline itch for eligibility purposes. The 
eDiary is to be completed twice each day; once in the morning and once in t he evening. 
Participants will score the severity of their itching using the same scale described above. 
The NRS recorded in the morning will characterize the worst itch experienced during the 
night -time, whilst the NRS recorded in the evening will characte rize the worst itch 
experienced during the day -time hours.   
During the screening period, participants must complete at least 40 of the 56 itch entries, 
with an entry on at least 4 days in each week, in the 28 days immediately preceding the 
Randomization v isit on Day 1. For the 28 days prior to Randomization, the Monthly Itch 
Score must be ≥4 (i.e., at least 1 of the 4 Weekly  Itch Scores must be ≥4), and no Weekly  
Itch Score can be <3 for any other week. Please see exclusion crite ria in S ection  5.2. 
After randomization, participants will continue to complete the symptom questionnaire in 
the eDiary throughout the study and wil l be completed twice each day; once in the 
morning and once in the evening approximately at the time of study intervention dosing.  
Sleep Interference and Fatigue NRS  
Participants will be asked to score the severity of how itch interfered with their sleep 
using an NRS from 0 to 10 where 0 represents no sleep interference and 10 is complete 
sleep interference according to the SoA (Section  1.3). The sleep NRS is recorded once 
daily in the morning.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 82 Participants will also be asked to score their fatigue using an NRS from 0 to 10 where 0 
represents no fatigue and 10 represents the worst possible fatigue. The fatigue NRS is 
recorded on ce daily in the evening.  
8.2.1.2.  PBC -40 Health Related Quality of Life Scale  
The PBC -40 is a patient -derived, disease specific health -related quality of life measure 
with data to support its validity in PBC [ Jacoby , 2005 ]. The PBC -40 assesses a variety of 
symptoms including itch, fatigue, memory and concentration and impact on social life 
and daily living. The PBC -40 was developed and validated with a 4 week recall period, 
which was modified to a recall period of “the past 7 days” to ensure more accurate recall 
of the impacts associated with PBC pruritus in the GLIMMER study. The revised recall 
period version has undergone cognitive interviewing and has been validated in a blinded  
interim analysis of GLIMMER and an external validation study (data on file) . This 
revised PBC -40 will be used in this study at the timepoints specified in the SoA 
(Section  1.3). 
8.2.1.3.  Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS)  
The GSRS is a validated scale that will be assessed for all participants at the timepo ints 
indicated in the SoA (see S ection  1.3). The GSRS assesses 15 items combined in to five 
symptom clusters, representing reflux, abdominal pain, indigestion, diarrhea , and 
constipation and wi ll assess gastrointestinal symptoms experienced by participants over 
the preceding 5 to 7 days [ Svedlund , 1988 ]. 
8.2.1.4.  Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)  
The Epwor th Sleepiness Scale (ESS) is a self -administered questionnaire that assesses 
daytime sleepiness. The ESS is comprised of 8 questions with respondents rating on a 4 -
point scale (0 -3) their usual chances of having dozed off or fallen asleep while engaged in 
eight different activities that differ widely in their somnificity. The total ESS score (the 
sum of 8 item -scores, range 0 -24) gives an estimate of a more general characteristic, the 
person’s average sleep propensity  (ASP), across a wide range of activities in their daily 
lives [Johns , 2002 ]. The higher the ESS score, the higher that person’s ASP in daily life, 
or their ‘d aytime sleepiness’. These ESS item -scores provide estimates of eight different 
situational sleep propensities (SSP) for that person [Johns , 1994; Johns , 2010 ]. 
General cut -points for sleepiness severity are: 0 -5 Lower Normal Daytime Sleepiness; 
6-10 Higher Normal Daytime Sleepiness; 11 -12 Mild Excessive Daytime Sleepiness; 
13-15 Moderate Excessive Daytime Sleepiness; 16 -24 Severe Excessive Daytime 
Sleepiness.  
The ESS will be administered at  the timepoints specified in the SoA (Section  1.3).  
8.2.1.5.  Beck Depression Inventory (BDI -II) 
The B eck Depression Inventory (B DI-II) is a 21 -item questionnaire used to assess the 
intensity of depression in clinical and normal patients. The questionnaire will be 
administ ered at the timepoints specified in the SoA (Section  1.3).  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 83 8.2.1.6.  Patient’s Global Impression of Severity (PGI -S) 
This questionnaire will be used  to understand how participant’s itch score over the past 
week using the 0 -10 NRS relates to overall participant -reported itch severity. The 
primary role of the PGI -S is as an anchor for the psychometric analysis of the Itch NRS. 
The PGI -S uses a 5 -level r esponse scale and will be collected at the timepoints specified 
in the SoA ( Section  1.3). 
8.2.1.7.  Patient’s Global Impression of Change (PGI -C) 
This questionnaire will be used to understand how the participant’s daily itch score using 
the 0 -10 NRS relates to overall participant -reported change in itch severity. The primary 
role of the PGI -S is as an anchor for the psychometric analysis of the Itch NRS . The 
PGI-C comprises a 7 -level response scale to evaluate the participant’s assessment of 
change since baseline and a dichotomous (Yes/No) question on whether the change is 
considered meaningful by the participant. The PGI -C will be collected at the timep oints 
specified in the SoA (Section  1.3). 
8.3. Safety Assessments  
Planned time points for all safety assess ments are provided in the SoA (S ection  1.3).  
8.3.1.  Physical Examinations  
• A complete physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the 
Skin, Cardiovascular, Respiratory, Gastrointestinal and Neurological systems. Heig ht 
and weight will also be measured and recorded.  
• A brief physical examination will include, at a minimum, assessments of the skin, 
lungs, cardiovascular system, and abdomen (liver and spleen).  
• In cases where visits may be performed at locations other than a trial site, such as by 
a home healthcare provider, physical exams may be performed as symptom directed 
exams or by other means as agreed with the investigator.  Please refer to Section  10.8 
for home healthcare activities.  
• Investigators should pay special attention to clinical signs related to previous serious 
illnesses.  
8.3.2.  Vital Signs  
• Temperature, pulse rate , and blood pressure will be assessed.  
• Blood pressure and pulse measurements will be assessed with a completely 
automated device. Manual techniques will be used only if an automated device is not 
available.  
• Blood pressure and pulse measurements should be pr eceded by at least 5 minutes of 
rest for the participant in a quiet setting without distractions (e.g., television, cell 
phones).  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 84 • Vital signs (to be taken before blood collection for laboratory tests) will consist of 1 
pulse and 3 blood pressure measuremen ts (3 consecutive blood pressure readings 
will be recorded at intervals of at least 1  minute). The first reading should be 
rejected. The second and third readings should be averaged to give the measurement 
to be recorded.  
8.3.3.  Electrocardiograms (ECGs)  
• Single 1 2-lead ECGs will be obtained as outlined in the SoA (see  Section  1.3) using  
an ECG machine that automatically calculates the heart rate and  measures PR, QRS, 
QT, and QTc  intervals. Refer to Section  7.1.4  for QTc withdrawal criteria and 
additional QTc readings that may be neces sary.  
• ECGs will be reviewed locally by the investigator or an adequately trained physician . 
8.3.4.  Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments  
• Clinical Safety Laboratory Assessments are performed at the relevant laboratories 
provided in the List of Clinical Laboratori es. 
• See Section  10.2 for the list of clinical laboratory tests to be performed and to the 
SoA for the timing and frequency.  
• The investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and rec ord 
any clinically significant changes occurring during the study as an AE. The 
laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents.  
• All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during 
participation in the study sho uld be repeated until the values return to normal or 
baseline or are no longer considered significantly abnormal by the investigator or 
medical monitor.  
• If clinically significant values do not return to normal/baseline within a period of 
time judged reaso nable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the 
sponsor notified.  
• All protocol -required laboratory tests, as defined in Section  10.2, must be conducted 
in accordance with the laboratory manual/Study Reference Manual and the SoA 
(Section  1.3). 
• If laboratory values from non -protocol specified laboratory tests performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are 
considered clinically significant by the investigator (e.g., SAE or AE ), then the 
results must be recorded.  
• All available liver function tests (including liver enzymes, ALP, GGT, INR, total and 
direct bilirubin, CPK, LDH , and albumin)  done by local laborator ies must be  
recorded  in the eCRF . 
• All local lab oratory results  for L iver Event/other safety follow -up must be recorded  
in the eCRF.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 85 8.3.4.1.  Baseline Liver Biochemistry/Variance During Screening  
Given that participants may have abnormal screening values for liver biochemistry, 
baseline serum AST, ALT, ALP , and total bilirubin (TB) values will be established using 
an average of two sets of laboratory values obtained at least 4 weeks apart. If both values 
(Sample 1 and Sample 2) are within normal range, no further assessment is required.  
Variance will be calculated as the absolute value of [ (Sample  1- Sample 2)/average of 
Sample 1 and Sample 2) x100 ]. 
In order to ensure stability of liver disease and for participant safety, if any of the four 
liver parameters is above ULN in either Sample 1 or Sample 2, the variance between the 
two samples for the a bnormal parameter(s) should be ≤ 40%. Should the variance 
between the two samples be >  40%, a third measure (Sample 3) may be obtained prior to 
the randomization visit. These participants would be eligible for enrollment provided the 
variance between Sampl es 1 and 3 for the parameter(s) is ≤ 40%. The baseline value will, 
therefore, be established using the average of Samples 1 and 2 or in the event that a third 
measure was obtained, the average of Samples 1 and 3.  
8.3.4.2.  Fecal Occult Blood Test (FOBT)  
FOBT will be obtained at the timepoints outlined in Section  1.3 (SoA) in line with r isk 
monitoring as described in S ection  2.3.1 .  
Participants with a positive FOBT should be referred to their healthcare provider for 
follow up according to local standard of care.  
8.3.5.  Pregnancy Testing  
• Refer to Section  5.1, Inclusion Criteria for pregnancy testing entry criteria.  
• Pregnancy testing (urin e or serum as required by local regulations) will be conducted 
at all on -treatment visits for women of child bearing potential during study 
intervention period . 
• Pregnancy testing (urine or serum as required by local regulations) will be conducted 
for women of child bearing potential at the end of relevant systemic exposure.  
• Additional serum or urine pregnancy tests may be performed, as determined 
necessary by the investigator or required by local regulation, to establish the absence 
of pregnancy a t any time during the participant’s participation in the study.  
8.3.6.  Study Safety Monitoring  
• Participant safety will be continuously monitored by the GSK Medical Monitor, and 
the designated Safety Lead (or delegate) throughout the study. Pertinent findings and 
conclusions are shared with  the product’s Safety Review Team (SRT) for review of 
the overall benefit risk profile of the product.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 86 8.4. Adverse Events (AEs), Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and 
Other Safety Reporting  
The definitions of AE s or SAEs can be found in Section  10.3. 
All events meeting permanent stopping criteria described in Section  7.1 except for 
pregnancy will be recorded as  a (S)AE . 
AEs will be reported by the participant (or, when appropriate, by a caregiver, surrogate, 
or the participant's legally authorized representative).  
The investigator and any qualified designees are responsible for detecting, documenting, 
and reporting events that meet the definition of an AE or SAE and remain responsible for 
following up AEs that are serious, are considered related to the study interve ntion or the 
study, that caused the participant to discontinue the study intervention (see Section  7).  
The method of recording, evaluating, and assessing causality of AEs and SAEs and the 
procedures for completing and transmitting SAE reports are provided in Section  10.3. 
8.4.1.  Time Period and Frequency for Collecting AE and SAE 
Information  
• All SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICF until the last scheduled visit, 
follow -up phone call (if performed ), or completion of any required follow -up in the 
study (if applicable) , whichever is later , at the time points specified in the SoA 
(Section  1.3).  
• All AEs will be collected from the start of intervention until the last scheduled visit, 
the follow -up phone call (if performed ), or completion  of any required follow -up in 
the study (if applicable) , whichever is later , at the time points specified in the SoA 
(Section  1.3). 
• If a participant is found to have met  increased monitoring or stopping criteria  at 
Week  32 requiring additional follow -up after being enrolled in the follow -on study 
212358 (LLSAT) , AEs and SAEs that occur  after the Week 32 Visit will be recorded 
as follows:  
o AEs and SAEs considered by investigator to be part of the safety event 
requiring additional follow -up in  GLISTEN : Record in GLISTEN eCRF . 
o AEs and SAEs that are considered by investigator NOT to be part of the safety 
event requiring additional follow -up in GLIST EN: Record in LLSAT eCRF . 
• Medical occurrences that begin before the start of study intervention but after 
obtaining informed consent will be recorded as Medical  History/Current Medical 
Conditions not as AEs.  
• All SAEs will be recorded and reported to the sponsor or designee immediately and 
under no circumstance should this exceed 24 hours,  as indicated in Appendix 3 . The 
investigator will submit any updated SAE data to the sponsor within 24  hours of it 
being available.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 87 • Investigators are not obligated to actively seek information on AEs or SAEs after the 
conclusion of the study participation. However, if the investigator learns of any SAE, 
including a death, at any time after a participant has been discharged from the stu dy, 
and he/she  considers the event to be reasonably related to the study intervention or 
study participation, the investigator must promptly notify the sponsor.  
8.4.2.  Method of Detecting AEs and SAEs  
Care will be taken not to introduce bias when detecting AE and /or SAE. Open -ended and 
non-leading verbal questioning of the participant is the preferred method to inquire about 
AE occurrence.  
8.4.3.  Follow -up of AEs and SAEs  
After the initial AE/SAE report, the investigator is required to proactively follow each 
participan t at subsequent visits/contacts. All SAEs, and non -serious AEs of special 
interest (as defined in Section  10.3, Appendix 3 : AEs and SAEs: Definitions and 
Procedures for Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  ), will be followed until 
the event is resolved, stabilized, otherwise explained, or the participant is lost to follow -
up (as defined in Section  7.3). Further information on follow -up procedures is given in 
Appendix 3 , Section  10.3. 
8.4.4.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements for SAEs  
• Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of an SAE is essential so that 
legal obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and 
the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
• The sponso r has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority 
and other regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical 
investigation. The sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory 
requirements relating t o safety reporting to the regulatory authority, IRB/ IECs , and 
investigators.  
• An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing an SAE or 
other specific safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor 
will review a nd then file it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the 
IRB/IEC, if appropriate according to local requirements.  
• Investigator safety reports must be prepared for suspected unexpected serious 
adverse reactions (SUSAR) according to local r egulatory requirements and sponsor 
policy and forwarded to investigators as necessary.  
8.4.5.  Pregnancy  
• Details of all pregnancies in female participants will be collected after the start of 
study intervention and until the final follow up visit . 
• If a pregnancy i s reported, the investigator will record pregnancy information on the 
appropriate form and submit it to GSK within 24 hours  of learning of the female  
participant ’s pregnancy. While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE or 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 88 SAE, any pregnancy compli cation or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical 
reasons will be reported as an AE or SAE.  
• Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, stillbirth, 
congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy) are considered SAEs and will be r eported 
as such.  
• The participant will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. The 
investigator will collect follow -up information on the participant and the neonate, 
and the information will be forwarded to the sponsor.  
• Any post -study pregna ncy-related SAE considered reasonably related to the study 
intervention by the investigator will be reported to the sponsor as described in 
Section  8.3.5 . While the investigator is not obligated to actively seek this information 
in former study participants, he or she may learn of an SAE through spontaneous 
reporting.  
• Any female particip ant who becomes pregnant while participating in the study will 
discontinue study intervention immediately but will be encouraged to continue to 
attend study visits and undergo assessments.  
8.4.6.  Cardiovascular and Death Events  
For any cardiovascular events detai led in Section  10.3.3  and all deaths, whether or not 
they are considered SAEs, specific Cardiovascular (CV) and Death sections of the eCRF 
will be required to be completed. These sections include questions regarding 
cardiovascular (including sudden cardiac death) and non -cardiovascular death.  
The CV eCRFs are presented as queries in response to reporting of certain CV MedDRA 
terms. The CV information should be recorded in the specific cardiovascular section of 
the eCRF within one week of receipt of a CV Event data query prompting its 
completion.   
The Death eCRF is provided immediately after the occurrence or outcome of death is 
reported. I nitial and follow -up reports regarding death must be completed within  one 
week of when the death is reported.  
8.4.7.  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Adverse events of special interest for this study include:  
• Diarrhea reported as an AE  
• Elevated ALT reported as  a Liver Event  
AESIs will be recorded on separate AESI forms within the eCRF  in addition to the 
AE/SAE  eCRFs . 
8.4.8.  Participation Card  
The investigator (or designee) must provide the participant  with a “participant card” 
containing information about the clinical  study. The participant  must be instructed to 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 89 always keep the participant card in their possession for the duration of the study. In an 
emergency, this card serves to inform the responsible attending physician / caregiver/  
family member that the participant  is in a clinical study and that relevant information may 
be obtained by contacting the investigator(s) or their back up.  
8.5. Pharmacokinetics  
Whole blood samples will be collected for measurement of plasma concentrations of 
linerixibat as specified in the SoA  (Section  1.3).  
• The timing of sampling may be altered during the course of the study based on newly 
available data (e.g., to obtain data closer to the time of peak plasma concentrations) 
to ensure appropriate monitoring.  In addition, PK sample collection and/or analysis 
may be terminated when sufficient data has been collected, and any remaining 
samples may be discarded if not required.  
• Dosing instructions for visits at which PK assessments are drawn will be specified in 
the SRM.  
• Instructions for the collection and handling of biological samples will be provided by 
the sponsor. The actual date and time (24 -hour clock time) of each sample wil l be 
recorded.  
• Samples collected for analyses of linerixibat plasma concentration may also be used 
to evaluate safety or efficacy aspects related to concerns arising during or after the 
study.  
• Genetic analyses will not be performed on these plasma samples unless consent for 
this was included in the informed consent. Participant confidentiality will be 
maintained.  
• Intervention concentration information that may unblind the study will not be 
reported to investigative sites or blinded personnel until the stud y has been 
unblinded.  
8.6. Genetics  
A blood  and/or saliva  sample for deoxyribonucleic acid ( DNA ) isolation will be collected 
from participants who have consented to participate in the genetics analysis component of 
the study. Participation is optional. Partici pants who do not wish to participate in the 
genetic research may still participate in the study.  
In the event of DNA extraction failure, a replacement genetic blood  and/or saliva  sample 
may be requested from the participant. Signed informed consent will be  required to 
obtain a replacement sample unless it was included in the original consent.  
See Section  10.5 for information regarding genetic research. Details on processes for 
collection and shipment of these samples will be found in a separate laboratory manual.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 90 8.7. Biomarkers  
Blood samples will be collected to measure the levels exploratory biomarkers, including 
markers of bile acid synth esis and re -uptake (total serum bile acids, autotaxin, serum C4 
and FGF -19). Biomarker sample collection and/or analysis may be terminated when 
sufficient data has been collected, and any remaining samples may be discarded if not 
required.  
The levels of bi omarkers in PBC subjects at baseline, the effect of linerixibat treatment 
on biomarker levels and impact of background therapies (e.g. bile acid binding resins) 
will be assessed. Samples will be collected according to the sche dule described in the 
SoA (see  Section  1.3) and as detailed in the laboratory manual provided separately to 
sites.  
GSK may store samples for up to 15 years after the en d of the study to achieve study 
objectives  (please see China specific requirements in Section  10.7.1 ). Additionally, with 
participants con sent, samples may be used for further research by GSK or others such as 
universities or other companies to contribute to the understanding of PBC, cholestatic 
pruritus, other diseases or the development of related or new treatments or research 
methods.  Further research will only be conducted in countries where permitted by local 
regulation and guidelines.  
8.7.1.  Biomarkers of Disease Progression  
Disease progression can occur even when patients are receiving adequate treatment (e.g. , 
UCDA), with a risk of liver -related complications. In GLIMMER, results demonstrated 
that linerixibat does not result in  an increase in plasma ALP confirming the lack of 
detrimental impact on PBC itself or clinically relevant interaction between linerixibat and 
UDCA (for more details see IB, S ection 5.2.2).   
However, in order to continue to assess the hallmarks of PBC prog ression over a longer 
period, serum surrogate marker s of liver fibrosis  and liver function , ELF, and transient 
elastography (TE) utilizing Fibroscan will be obta ined at timepoints outlined in 
Section  1.3. In addition , investigators  are advised to implement  hepatocellular 
carcinoma  screening for patients with cirrhosis according  to standard of care  and country  
guidelines  and/or local practices . Any liver biopsies that may be performed during the 
course of the study will be collected in the eCRF pages.  
8.7.1.1.  Enhanced Liver Fibrosis Test (ELF)  
Blood samples for the ELF should be obtained at timepoints outlined in Section  1.3 
(SoA). These samples may not be collected from participants in China due to operational 
or logistical difficulties.  
8.7.1.2.  Fibroscan  
Transient Elastography (TE) using Fibrosc an should be perfo rmed at timepoints outlined

 91 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
Unless otherwise specified, all objectives/endpoints /hypotheses  compare treatment with 
oral linerixibat with background itch therapy , if applicable, against placebo with 
background itch therapy, if applicable. Hereafter this comparison will be referred to as 
“linerixibat vs placebo”.  
9.1. Statistical Hypotheses  
9.1.1.  Primary endpoint  
The primary objective is to investigate the superiority of 24 weeks of treatment with oral 
linerixibat compared with placebo  on itch in PBC patients with cholestatic pruritus.  The 
primary endpoint is Change from Baseline in Monthly Itch Scores over 24 weeks using a 
0-10 numerical rating scale (NRS).  The primary estim and is the difference in means 
between linerixibat and placebo in the change from baseline in itch score over 24 weeks 
in PBC patients with cholestatic pruritus . For detai ls of intercurrent events, see 
Section  9.4. The primary analysis will be a mixed model approach based on Monthly Itch 
score over 24 weeks (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24). The primary hypothesis is that 
linerixibat reduces  itch score over 24 weeks compared to placebo. A negative change 
from baseline (or reduction) represents an improvement in itch.  
The null hypothesis (H 0) assumes that there is no difference in the reduction of itch score 
over 24 weeks between linerixibat a nd placebo groups . The alternate hypothesis (H1) 
assumes that there is difference in the reduction of itch score over 24 weeks between 
linerixibat  and placebo groups.  
The overall significance level for the primary endpoint analysis is set at the two -sided  
0.05 level.  
9.1.2.  Secondary endpoints  
Formal multiplicity -controlled testing will be conducted for the key secondary endpoints 
of change from baseline in Weekly  Itch Score  (WIS) at Week 2, change from baseline in 
Monthly Sleep Score over 24 weeks, as well as responder endpoint defined as achieving 
≥2, ≥3, and ≥4-point reduction from Baseline in the Monthly Itch Score at Week 24. 
Additional testing not multiplicity controlled will be conducted for other secondary 
endpoints includi ng change from baseline in PBC -40 domain score at Week 24, change 
from baseline in PGI -S over 24 weeks, PGI -C over 24 weeks, change from baseline in 
ALP at Week 24, and Change from baseline in bilirubin at Week 24 .  
A step -down/hierarchical approach will b e used to test the following key secondary 
endpoints if statistical significance is achieved for the primary endpoint:  
• Change from Baseline in WIS at Week 2  
• Change from Baseline in Monthly Sleep Score over 24  weeks  
• Responder s defined as achieving a ≥2 -point reduction from Baseline in the 
Monthly Itch score at Week 24.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 92 • Responders defined as achieving a ≥3 -point reduction from Baseline in the 
Monthly Itch score at Week 24.  
• Responders defined as achieving a ≥4 -point reduction from Baseline in the 
Monthly Itch score at Week 24.  
These tests will be conducted sequentially at a 5% two -sided significance level. Other 
secondary endpoints will also be tested but outside this formal  hierarchy.  
9.2. Sample Size Determination  
Approximately 230 participants (115 per group) who pass the screening eligibility criteria 
will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to linerixibat or placebo groups. The sample size of 230 
was obtained and evaluated assuming that 10% of participants discontinue from the study 
at random and the data from the discontinuation week through week 24 are missing. This 
sample size allows appro ximately 90% power for a two -sided test with an alpha level of 
0.05 when the expected overall difference in change from baseline in Monthly Score 
across 24 weeks is ~ -0.9 (based on BAT117213 and GLIMMER data) between the 
linerixibat and placebo groups (ass uming a between subject standard deviation [S D] of 
2.07 for both groups base d on GLIMMER data).  
9.2.1.  Sample size assumptions  
Change from baseline in the WIS was simulated for each week from week 1 to week 24 
after randomization. It was assumed that the mean ch ange from baseline in the WIS of 
placebo group reaches its plateaued effect size of -1.5 by week 12 in a linear relationship 
against treatment week. It was also assumed that delta between linerixibat and placebo 
reaches plateau of -1 by week 4 in a linear relationship against treatment week, and the 
mean change from baseline in the WIS of linerixibat  group is the sum of placebo and 
delta as shown in Figure 3.

-2.375}  -2.5 10% 
 
For each iteration of simulation, change from baseline data for each week was generated 
for 115 subjects per group using a truncated multivariate normal distribution within the 
interval of [ -10, 10] with the mean vectors presente d above. The variance covariance 
matrix was assumed to have a compound symmetry (CS) structure with standard 
deviation of 2.25 and correlation of 0.85 which corresponds to a between subjects SD of 
~2.07 and a within subject SD of ~0.87, based on the GLIMME R data.  
The rates of study withdrawal that resulted in missing values from withdrawals for 
placebo group and linerixibat 40 mg BID group after randomization were 1/36 and 1/23, 

TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 94 respectively, in the GLIMMER study. Therefore, it was expected to have ~10% st udy 
withdrawal rate for each arm and the study withdrawal can occur at any week after 
randomization. Missing data was assumed to be missing at random in the simulation.    
Simulations were based on planned visits at week 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24. For visit  on 
week 4, the worst change from baseline in WIS from week 1 to 4 was reported as the 
change from baseline in Monthly Itch Score. Similarly, the change from baseline in 
Monthly Itch Scores were obtained for other visits. Mixed model repeated measure 
analy sis was then applied to change from baseline in Monthly Itch Scores and the model 
included treatment, visit, and treatment by visit interaction as fixed effect. The 
comparison of active and placebo arms was based on the simple average of LS means of 
all vi sits, i.e., the main effect of treatment averaged across the 6 visits with equal weight  
at each visit.  
9.3. Analysis Sets  
For purposes of analysis, the following populations are defined:  
Population  Description  
Screening  All participants who sign the ICF  
Enrolled  All participants who sign the ICF and pass screening 
(meet the eligibility criteria)  
ITT Population  This population will comprise all randomized 
participants. Participants in the ITT Population will be 
classified according to the treatment as r andomized.  
Non-bile acid binding resin 
ITT (Intent to Treat) 
Population  The Non -bile acid binding resin ITT Population is a 
subset of the ITT population who are not receiving 
concomitant bile acid binding resin therapy at 
randomization (e.g., cholestyramine).  
Safety  All randomized participants who take at least 1 dose of 
study intervention. Participants will be analyzed 
according to the treatment they actually received.  
9.4. Statistical Analyses  
The primary  statistical analysis to assess the primary , secondary , and safety  objectives 
will be performed when  all randomized participants  have complete d the Part A  
intervention period ( up to  Week 24 /Visit 9 ). In addition, available data f or exploratory 
endpoints in Part A and Part B will be analyzed  as part of this primary statistical analysis . 
By the time  the last participant  completes the Part A intervention  period , it is anticipated 
that the majority of participants  will have also completed the Part B  intervention period 
(Week 24 through Week 32) . Therefore , all available  Part B data  will also be assessed  
and reported  as part of the primary statistical anal ysis.  
A final analysis will then be performed w hen all participant s have complete d the Part B 
intervention period,  and the follow -up period , if applicable . This analysis will include  
complete Part B data and the full data for exploratory endpoints in Part A  for which full 
datasets were not available at the time of the primary analysis .

  Protocol amendment 04  
 95 The statistical analysis plan will be finalized prior to database lock (DBL) and it will 
include a more technical and detailed des cription of the statistical analyses described in 
this section. This section is a summary of the planned statistical analyses of the most 
important endpoints including primary and key secondary endpoints.  
9.4.1.  General Considerations  
The study will test at a 5% two-sided significance level the null hypotheses listed 
previously  in Section  9.5. 
9.4.2.  Primary and Secondary Endpoint(s)  
Endpoint  Statistical Analysis Methods  
Primary  The primary objective is to evaluate the treatment 
effect of linerixibat compared to placebo on itch over 
24 weeks. The primary hypothesis is that linerixibat 
reduces itch score over 24 weeks  compared to placebo . 
A negative change (or reduction) from baseline in 
monthly itch score averaged over 24 weeks represents 
an improvement in itch.  
 
The Monthly Itch Score, based on a 0 -10 NRS,  will be 
determined from the worst weekly average available 
for the month. A week will have a Weekly Itch Score if 
at least 4 days in the week have a score. Otherwise, the 
Weekly  Itch Score for the week will be missing. If one 
or more weekly scores is miss ing, then the worst of the 
non-missing weekly scores is selected as the worst for 
that month. If no week scores are available for a 
month, the Month Itch Score will be missing.  
 
The following intercurrent events have been 
considered for the evaluation of the primary endpoint 
of Monthly Itch Score:  
o Permanent treatment discontinuation , 
disruptions in treatment, treatment delays 
unrelated to the COVID -19 pandemic, 
addressed with treatment policy strategy  
o Permanent treatment discontinuation, 
disruptions in treatment, treatment delays 
related to the COVID -19 pandemic, 
addressed with hypothetical strategy  
o Change in background itch therapy or use 
of rescue medication, addressed with 
treatment policy strategy  
The summary measure will be mean difference  
between treatment groups . The primary analysis will 
be a mixed model for repeated measures (MMRM) of 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 96 Endpoint  Statistical Analysis Methods  
change from baseline in Monthly Itch score over the 
24-week treatment period. The model will include 
main effects for treatment, visit (Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 , 
20, and 24), concomitant use of itch medications at 
baseline, and baseline itch severity as continuous as 
well as treatment by visit interaction and baseline by 
visit interaction. An unstructured covariance structure 
will be assumed; if this does not con verge then CS  will 
be used, followed by an autoregressive [AR] 
covariance structure if CS does not converge.    
 
The change from baseline over 24 -week treatment 
period will use a treatment policy strategy for the 
intercurrent events unrelated to the COVID -19 
pandemic, in which data following intercurrent events 
will be included as available and participants will be 
classified according to assigned treatment (regardless 
of treatment actually received) according to ITT 
principles. For intercurrent events relat ed to the 
COVID -19 pandemic, hypothetical strategy will be 
used. The outcomes impacted by the COVID -19 
related intercurrent events will be discarded, and the 
MMRM then fitted. This assumes that unobserved 
outcomes of subjects who withdrew from the study or  
who experienced a COVID -19 related intercurrent 
event are missing at random (MAR). Full details will 
be provided in the Statistics Analysis Plan.   
 
A sensitivity analysis will be conducted to evaluate the 
impact of the MAR assumption on the conclusions o f 
the primary analysis if the primary endpoint is 
significant in favor of linerixibat. In this sensitivity 
analysis, a tipping point approach will be used. This is 
akin to progressive stress -testing to assess how severe 
departures from the MAR assumption m ust be in order 
to change the overall conclusion of the primary 
analysis. Missing data will first be imputed for all 
visits under the MAR assumption, and then a shift will 
be applied. This will be repeated until the result is no 
longer statistically signif icant. The plausibility of the 
set of assumptions required for conclusions to change 
provides context for the interpretation of the trial 
results. The tipping point analysis will be two -
dimensional, which allows assumptions about the 
missing outcomes on th e two arms to vary 
independently and includes scenarios where dropouts 
on linerixibat have worse outcomes than dropouts on 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 97 Endpoint  Statistical Analysis Methods  
placebo. Full details will be provided in the Statistics 
Analysis Plan.  
 
As a supplementary estimand for the primary 
objective, the h ypothetical treatment effect of 
linerixibat will be compared to placebo in the absence 
of any intercurrent eve nts. Hypothetical strategy will 
be applied to all the intercurrent events defined above, 
including treatment discontinuation, disruptions in 
treatment or treatment delays, changes in itch therapy 
or use of rescue medication. The outcomes impacted 
by the in tercurrent events will be discarded, and the 
MMRM then fitted. This assumes that unobserved 
outcomes of subjects who withdrew from the study or 
who experienced an intercurrent event are MAR.  
The main analytical approach will also be repeated 
using the non -bile acid binding resin ITT population. 
Any participant taking bile acid binding resin as the 
background itch therapy at baseline  will be excluded 
from the non -bile acid binding resin ITT population 
and any data from these excluded participants will not 
contribute to the analysis.  
Secondary  Change from baseline in Weekly  Itch Score at Week 2  
 
The change from baseline WIS at Week 2 will be 
evaluated. Similar  to the primary estimand framework, 
treatment policy strategy will be used for the 
intercurrent events unrelated to the COVID -19 
pandemic, whereas hypothetical strategy will be used 
for the intercurrent events related to the COVID -19 
pandemic.  
 
Change from ba seline WIS at Week 1 and 2 will be 
analyzed by a MMRM model including baseline itch 
severity as a continuous covariate, treatment, week 
(Weeks 1 and 2), concomitant use of  itch medications 
at baseline, treatment by week interactions, and 
baseline by week i nteraction as fixed effects.  The 
comparison at Week 2 will be estimated from the 
MMRM model.   
• Change from Baseline in Monthly Sleep score 
over 24 weeks:  
Change from baseline in Monthly Sleep score over 24 
weeks will be evaluated .

pandemic, whereas hypothetical strategy will be used 
for the intercurrent events related to the COVID -19 
pandemic.  
 
Change from baseline of Monthly Sleep score  
averaged over 24  weeks  will be analyzed using a 
repeated measure mixed model including baseline 
Monthly Sleep score as covariate, treatment, visit, 
concomitant use of itch medications at baseline, 
treatment by visit interaction, and baseline by visit 
interaction as fixed effects.  
 
Responder defined as achieving a ≥2 -point reduction 
from baseline in the Monthly Itch score at Week 24;  
Responder defined as achieving  a ≥3-point reduction 
from baseline in the Monthly Itch score at Week 24;  
Responder defined as achieving a ≥4-point reduction 
from baseline in the Monthly Itch score at Week 24:  
The proportion of participants who are responders at 
Week 24 will be evaluated . 
 
Similarly, treatment policy strategy will be used for the 
intercurrent events unrelated to the COVID -19 
pandemic, whereas hypothetical strategy will be used 
for the intercurrent events related to the COVID -19 
pandemic. Data impacted by a COVID -19 related 
intercurrent event will be discarded and multiple 
imputation will be applied to impute itch data using 
available data for all subjects. The imputed data will 
then be used to derive the responder endpoint.  
 
The summary measure will be the difference in 
respo nder rate s between linerixibat and placebo 
groups, analyzed using a stratified analysis with 
Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) weights, adjusting 
for baseline itch severity and concomitant use itch 
medications.  
• Change from Baseline in PBC -40 domain scores at

Change from baseline in the domain scores of PBC -40 
at week 24 will be evaluated. Similarly, treatment

from baseline in the domain scores of PBC -40 -over 24 
weeks will be analyzed using a mixed model including 
baseline domain scores of PBC -40 as covariate, 
treatment, visit , concomitant use of itc h medications at

Week 24 will then be estimated from the MMRM 
model .

participants reach 24 weeks of treatment (or discontinued early). The analysis will be 
overseen by an IDMC with non -binding futility guidelines as documented in the IDMC 
Charter. The study may be terminated following this analysis if the probability of 
demonstrating clinical efficacy based on observed data is too low to support continuing 
or following the safety review if the overall risk -benefit is assessed to be unfavorable. In 
the event of the study being discontinued, GSK processes will be followe d to ensure the 
best interests and the safety of the participants. The trial will not be stopped for early 
benefit at this point and no alpha -spend is incurred.

10.1.10.  Study and Site Start and Closure  
First Act of Recruitment  
The study start date is the date on which the clinical study will be open for recruitment of 
participants.  
The first participant’s first visit (FSFV) will be the study start date.  
Study/Site Termination  
GSK or designee reserves the  right to close the study site or terminate the study at any 
time for any reason at the sole discretion of GSK. Study sites will be closed upon study 
completion. A study site is considered closed when all required documents and study 
supplies have been col lected and a study -site closure visit has been performed.  
The investigator may initiate study -site closure at any time, provided there is reasonable 
cause and sufficient notice is given in advance of the intended termination.  
Reasons for the early closure of a study site by the sponsor or investigator may include 
but are not limited to:  
For study termination:  
• Discontinuation of further study intervention development  
For site termination:  
• Failure of the investigator to comply with the protocol, the requireme nts of the 
IRB/IEC or local health authorities, the sponsor's procedures, or GCP guidelines . 
• Inadequate or no recruitment of participants (evaluated after a reasonable amount 
of time) by the investigator  
• Total number of participants included earlier than e xpected  
• If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the sponsor shall promptly 
inform the investigators, the IECs/IRBs, the regulatory authorities, and any 
contract research organization(s) used in the study of the reason for termination or 
suspen sion, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirements. The

 111 10.3.  Appendix 3: AEs and SAEs: Definitions and Procedures for 
Recording, Evaluating, Follow -up, and Reporting  
10.3.1.  Definition of AE  
AE Definition  
• An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, 
temporally associated with the use of a study intervention, whether or not 
considered related to the study intervention.  
• NOTE: An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an 
abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) 
temporally associated with the use of a study intervention.  
 
Events Meeting  the AE Definition  
• Any abnormal laboratory test results (hematology, clinical chemistry, or urinalysis) 
or other safety assessments (e.g., ECG, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsen from baseline, considered clinically 
significant in the medical and scientific judgment of the investigator (i.e., not 
related to progression of underlying disease).  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition including either an 
increase in frequency and/or intensity of the condition.  
• New conditions detected or diagnosed after study intervention a dministration even 
though it may have been present before the start of the study.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected intervention - intervention 
interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or the clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of either study 
intervention or a concomitant medication. Overdose per se will not be reported as 
an AE/SAE unless it is an intentional overdose taken with possible suicidal/self -
harming intent. Such overdoses should be reported regardless of sequelae.  
• "Lack of effi cacy" or "failure of expected pharmacological action" per se will not 
be reported as an AE or SAE. Such instances will be captured in the efficacy 
assessments. However, the signs, symptoms, and/or clinical sequelae resulting from 
lack of efficacy will be r eported as AE or SAE if they fulfil the definition of an AE 
or SAE.  
 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 112 Events NOT  Meeting the AE Definition  
• Any clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal safety 
assessments which are associated with the underlying disease, unl ess judged by the 
investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.  
• The disease/disorder being studied or expected progression, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease/disorder being studied, unless more severe than expected for the 
participant’s condition.  
• Medical or surgical procedure (e.g., endoscopy, appendectomy): the condition that 
leads to the procedure is the AE.  
• Situations in which an untoward medical occurrence did not occur (social and/or 
convenience admission to a hospital ). 
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
present or detected at the start of the study that do not worsen.  
 
10.3.2.  Definition of SAE  
An SAE is defined as any serious adverse event that, at any dose:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life-threatening  
The term 'life -threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event in which the 
participant was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, 
which hypothetically might have caused death, if it were m ore severe.  
c. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• In general, hospitalization signifies that the participant has been admitted 
(usually involving at least an overnight stay) at the hospital or emergency ward 
for ob servation and/or treatment that would not have been appropriate in the 
physician’s office or outpatient setting. Complications that occur during 
hospitalization are AE. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfils any 
other serious criteria, the e vent is serious. When in doubt as to whether 
“hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the AE should be considered 
serious.  
• Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre -existing condition that did not 
worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
d. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• The term disability means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to 
conduct normal life functions.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 113 An SAE is defined as any serious adverse event that, at any dose:  
• This definition is not intended to include experiences of relatively minor 
medical signifi cance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may 
interfere with or prevent everyday life functions but do not constitute a 
substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
f. Abnormal pregnancy outcomes (e.g., spontaneous abortion, fetal death, 
stillbirth, congenital anomalies, ectopic pregnancy)  
g. Other situations:  
• Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised by the investigator in 
deciding whether S AE reporting is appropriate in other situations such as 
significant medical events that may jeopardize the participant or may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in 
the above definition. These events should usually be considered serious.  
o Examples of such events include invasive or malignant cancers, 
intensive treatment for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias, 
convulsions, or development of intervention dependency or intervention 
abuse.  
 
10.3.3.  Definition of Cardiovascular Events  
Cardiovascular Events (CV) Definition:  
Investigators will be required to fill out the specific CV event page of the eCRF for  the 
following AEs and SAEs:  
• Myocardial infarction/unstable angina  
• Congestive heart failure  
• Arrhythmias  
• Valvu lopathy  
• Pulmonary hypertension  
• Cerebrovascular events/stroke and transient ischemic attack  
• Peripheral arterial thromboembolism  
• Deep venous thrombosis/pulmonary embolism  
• Revascularization  
 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 114 10.3.4.  Recording and Follow -Up of AE and SAE  
AE and SAE Recording  
• When an  AE/SAE occurs, it is the responsibility of the investigator to review all 
documentation (e.g. , hospital progress notes, laboratory, and diagnostics reports) 
related to the event.  
• The investigator will then record all relevant AE/SAE information.  
• It is not acceptable for the investigator to send photocopies of the participant’s 
medical records to GSK in lieu of completion of the GSK required form.  
• There may be instances when copies of medical records for certain cases are 
requested by GSK. In this case, all  participant identifiers, with the exception of the 
participant number, will be redacted on the copies of the medical records before 
submission to GSK.  
• The investigator will attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event based on signs, 
symptoms, and/or other clinical information. Whenever possible, the diagnosis (not 
the individual signs/symptoms) will be documented as the AE/SAE.  
Assessment of Intensity  
The investigator will make an assessment of intensity for each AE and SAE reported 
during the study  and assign it to 1 of the following categories:  
• Mild: An event that is easily tolerated by the participant, causing minimal 
discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.  
• Moderate: An event that causes sufficient discomfort and interferes with normal 
everyday activities.  
• Severe: An event that prevents normal everyday activities. An AE that is assessed 
as severe should not be confused with an SAE. Severe is a category utilized for 
rating the intensity of an event; and both AE and SAE can be asses sed as severe.  
• An event is defined as ‘serious’ when it meets at least 1 of the predefined outcomes 
as described in the definition of an SAE, NOT when it is rated as severe.  
Diarrhea AEs will also be  assessed based on the CTCAE criteria as defi ned in 
Section  7.1.3.1 . 
 
Assessment of Causality  
• The investigator is obligated to assess the relationship between study intervention 
and each occurrence of each AE/SAE.  
• A "reasonable possibility" of a relationship conveys that there are facts, evidence, 
and/or arguments to suggest a causal relationship, rather than a relationship cannot 
be ruled out.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 115 Assessment of Causality  
• The investigator will use clinical judgment to determine the relationship.  
• Alternative causes, such as underlying disease(s), concomitant therapy, and other 
risk factors, as well as the temporal relationship of the event to study intervention 
administration will be considered and investigated.  
• The i nvestigator will also consult the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) and/or Product 
Information, for marketed products, in his/her assessment.  
• For each AE/SAE, the investigator must  document in the medical notes that he/she 
has reviewed the AE/SAE and has provid ed an assessment of causality.  
• There may be situations in which an SAE has occurred, and the investigator has 
minimal information to include in the initial report to GSK. However, it is very 
important that the investigator always make an assessment of caus ality for 
every event before the initial transmission of the SAE data to GSK . 
• The investigator may change his/her opinion of causality in light of follow -up 
information and send an SAE follow -up report with the updated causality 
assessment.  
• The causality a ssessment is one of the criteria used when determining regulatory 
reporting requirements.  
 
Follow -up of AE and SAE  
• The investigator is obligated to perform or arrange for the conduct of supplemental 
measurements and/or evaluations as medically indicated or as requested by GSK to 
elucidate the nature and/or causality of the AE or SAE as fully as possible. This 
may include additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathological 
examinations, or consultation with other health care professionals.  
• If a participant dies during participation in the study or during a recognized follow -
up period, the investigator will provide GSK with a copy of any post -mortem 
findings including histopathology.  
• New or updated information will be recorded in the originally submitted 
documents.  
• The investigator will submit any updated SAE data to GSK within 24 hours of 
receipt of the information.  
Follow -up of pregnancies  
• Pregnant participants will be followed to determine the outcome of the pregnancy. 
At the end of the pregnancy, whether full -term or premature, information on the 
status of the mother and child will be forwarded to GSK using the paper pregnancy 
follow -up report and the AE Report if applicable. Generally, the follow -up period 
does not need to be longer tha n 6 to 8 weeks after the estimated date of delivery.  
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 116 Follow -up of AE and SAE  
• Regardless of the reporting period for SAEs in this study, if the pregnancy outcome 
is an SAE, it should always be reported as such.  
• Furthermore, the investigator must report any SAE occurring as a resul t of a 
poststudy pregnancy that is considered by the investigator to be reasonably related 
to the study intervention, to GSK as described in Section  8.4.5 . 
 
10.3.5.  Reporting of SAE to GSK  
SAE Reporting to GSK  via Electronic Data Collection Tool  
• The primary mechanism for reporting SAE to GSK will be the electronic data 
collection tool.  
• If the electronic system is unavailable, then the site will use the paper SAE data 
collection tool (see next section) to report the event within 24 hours.  
• The site will enter the SAE data into the electronic system as soon as it becomes 
available.  
• After the study is completed at a given site, the elec tronic data collection tool will 
be taken off -line to prevent the entry of new data or changes to existing data.  
• If a site receives a report of a new SAE from a study participant or receives updated 
data on a previously reported SAE after the electronic da ta collection tool has been 
taken off -line, then the site can report this information on a paper SAE form (see 
next section) or to the GSK Medical Monitor by telephone . 
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Study Reference Manual . 
 
SAE Reporting to GSK via Paper Data Collection Tool  
• Facsimile transmission of the SAE paper data collection tool is the preferred 
method to transmit this information to the case management group.  
• In rare circumstances and in the absence of facsimile equipment, notifica tion by 
telephone is acceptable with a copy of the SAE data collection tool sent by 
overnight mail or courier service.  
• Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need for the investigator to 
complete and sign the SAE data collection tool withi n the designated reporting time 
frames.  
• Contacts for SAE reporting can be found in the Study Reference Manual .

 117 10.4.  Appendix 4: Contraceptive and Barrier Guidance  
10.4.1.  Definitions:  
Woman of Childbearing Potential (WOCBP)  
Women in the following categories are considered WOCBP (fertile):  
1. Following menarche  
2. From the time of menarche until becoming post -menopausal unless permanently 
sterile (see below)  
Notes : 
• A postmenopausal state is defined as no menses for 12 months without an alternative 
medical cause.  
o A high follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range 
may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal 
contraception or hormonal replacement therapy (HRT). However, in the 
absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, confirma tion with more than one FSH 
measurement is required.  
o Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to 
use one of the non -estrogen hormonal highly effective contraception methods 
if they wish to continue their HRT during the study . Otherwise, they must 
discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of postmenopausal status before study 
enrolment.  
• Permanent sterilization methods (for the purpose of this study) include:  
o Documented hysterectomy  
o Documented bilateral salpingectomy  
o Documented bilateral oophorectomy  
For individuals with permanent infertility due to an alternate medical cause other than the 
above, (e.g., Mullerian agenesis, androgen insensitivity, gonadal dysgenesis), investigator 
discretion should be applied to determining study  entry.  
Note:  Documentation can come from the site personnel’s review of the participant’s 
medical records, medical examination, or medical history interview.  
If fertility is unclear (e.g., amenorrhea in adolescents or athletes) and a menstrual cycle 
canno t be confirmed before first dose of study intervention, additional evaluation should 
be considered.

a. Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local regulations regarding the use of 
contraceptive methods for those participating in clinical studies.  
b. Failure rate of <1% per year when used consistently and correctly. Typical use failure rates differ from those 
when used consistently and correctly.  
c. If locally required, in accordance with Clinical Trial Facilitation Group (CTFG) guidelines, acceptable 
contraceptive methods are limited to those which inhibit ovulation as the primary mode of action.  
d. Considered effective, but not highly effective - failure rate of ≥1% per year. Periodic abstinence (calendar, 
sympto -thermal, post -ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and lactational 
amenorrhea method (LAM ) are not acceptable methods of contraception.  
e. Male condom and female condom should not be used together (due to risk of failure from friction).

USE/ANALYSIS OF DNA  
• Genetic variation may impact a participant’s response to study inter vention, 
susceptibility, severity , and progression of disease. Variable response to study 
intervention may be due to genetic determinants that impact drug absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion; mechanism of action of the drug; disease 
etiology; and/or molecular subtype of the  disease being treated. Therefore, where 
local regulations and IRB/IEC allow, a blood and/or saliva sample will be collected 
for DNA analysis  
• DNA samples will be used for research related to linerixibat or PBC, cholestatic 
pruritus and related diseases. Th ey may also be used to develop tests/assays including 
diagnostic tests related to linerixibat, other IBAT inhibitors and PBC or cholestatic 
pruritus. Genetic research may consist of the analysis of one or more candidate genes 
or the analysis of genetic mar kers throughout the genome or analysis of the entire 
genome (as appropriate)  
• Additional analyses of DNA samples may be conducted if it is hypothesized that this 
may help further understand the clinical data.  
• The samples may be analyzed as part of a multi -study assessment of genetic factors 
involved in the response to linerixibat  or study interventions of this class to 
understand the study disease or related conditions.  
• The results of genetic analyses may be reported in the CSR or in a separate study 
summar y. 
• The sponsor will store the DNA samples in a secure storage space with adequate 
measures to protect confidentiality.  
• The samples will be retained while research on linerixibat or study interventions of 
this class or indication continues but no longer than the data retention period  of the 
study  or other period as per local requirements.

 121 10.6.  Appendix 6: Liver Safety: Required Actions and Follow -up 
Assessments  
Procedures When Liver Stopping Criteria are Met  
The procedures listed below are to be followed if a  participant meets any of the liver 
chemistry stopping criteria defined in Section  7.1.1 . 
Immediately withdraw the participant from study intervention  (see Section  7.1.1.2 ). 
Make every reasonable attempt to have the participant return to the clinic within 24 -72 
hrs. for repeat liver chemistries and additional testing.  
Notify the GSK Medical Monitor or designee within 24 hours of learning of the 
abnormality t o confirm the participant’s study intervention cessation and follow -up. 
Complete the “Safety Follow -Up Procedures” listed below.  
Complete the liver event eCRFs. If the event also meets the criteria of an SAE, the SAE 
data collection tool will be completed  separately with the relevant details.  
Upon completion of the liver safety follow -up, the participant should remain in the study,  
restart of study intervention ( where there is a likely non -DILI cause for the event) might 
be considered upon discus sion with m edical monitor ( see Section  7.1.9.1 ). 
Monitor participants at least weekly  until liver chemistries (ALT, AST, ALP , TB, 
PT/INR) resolve, stabilize or return to within baseline values  and the subject is 
asymptomatic . 
Additi onal Safety Follow -Up Procedures for participants who meet any of the liver 
stopping criteria:  
Viral hepatitis serology including:  
• Hepatitis A I mmunoglobulin (I gM) antibody;  
• Hepatitis B surface antigen and Hepatitis B Core Antibody (IgM);  
• Hepatitis C RNA;  
• Cytomegalovirus IgM antibody;   
• Epstein -Barr viral capsid antigen IgM antibody (or if unavailable, obtain heterophile 
antibody or monospot testing);   
• Hepatitis E IgM antibody.  
Blood sample for PK analysis, obtained within 12 hours of las t dose. Record the 
date/time of the PK blood sample draw and the date/time of the last dose of study 
intervention prior to blood sample draw on the eCRF. If the date or time of the last dose 
is unclear, provide the participant’s best approximation. If the date/time of the last dose 
cannot be approximated OR a PK sample cannot be collected in the time period indicated 
TMF-16740250  CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
 122 above, do not obtain a PK sample . Instructions for sample handling and shipping are 
included in the SRM.  
Serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) an d lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).  
Serum and plasma samples for biomarkers of liver injury  
Fractionate bilirubin, if total bilirubin 2xULN.  
Assess eosinophilia.  
Record the appearance or worsening of clinical symptoms of hepatitis (fatigue, nausea, 
vomiting, r ight upper quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash or eosinophilia) as relevant 
on the AE eCRF.  
Record use of concomitant medications, acetaminophen, herbal remedies, other over the 
counter medications, or putative hepatotoxins on the Concomitant Medicati ons eCRF.  
Record alcohol use on the Liver Events eCRF.  
The following are required for participants who meet liver stopping criteria for both 
ALT and total bilirubin :  
Anti-nuclear antibody, anti -smooth muscle antibody, Type 1 anti -liver kidney 
microsomal antibodies and quantitative total immunoglobulin G (IgG or gamma 
globulins).  
Serum acetaminophen adduct high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay 
(where available ) to assess  potential acetaminophen contribution to liver injury unless 
acetaminophe n use is very unlikely in  the preceding week).   
Liver imaging (ultrasound, magnetic resonance, or computerized tomography) to evaluate 
liver disease.  
The Liver Imaging and/or Liver Biopsy eCRFs are also to be completed if these tests are 
performed.

Autotaxin, Total Serum Bile Acids) will be contingent on agreements with China 
regul atory (HGRAC). Depending on the agreements with the China regulatory and ethics 
committees, all or some of these biomarkers will be made optional for participants from 
China.   
These exploratory biomarkers are all biomarkers of bile acid synthesis and reupt ake and  
will be analyzed to help inform about the pharmacodynamics of linerixibat.  
In addition, the optional genetics sample described in Section  8.6, ELF and Fibroscan as 
described in S ection  8.7.1.2  will be contingent on agreements with HGRAC. ELF  and 
serum acetaminophen Adduct HPLC assay for liver event testing  may not be performed 
in China due to operational or logistical difficulties.  
For any biological samples taken, samples will be analyzed and stored within China 
according to local storage and retention regulations and requirements.  
Further research as described in Section  8.6 and Section  8.7 will not be applicable for 
samples from China.

134 10.8.  Appendix 8: Home He althcare /Remote Activities   
10.8.1.  Overall Rationale for this Appendix  
This protocol appendix outlines measures to be considered  for any country/ site where 
home healthcare options may be implemented  for participants as permitted by country 
and local regulations and infrastructure .  
Activities may be performed remotely either to ensure study continuity during periods of 
significant challenge (e.g. , pandemic, conflict), or if partial or fully remote st udy 
activities are permitted locally to support participant burden with visit schedul ing. 
Where required due to study continuity issues, clinical investigators should document in 
participant notes appropriately how restrictions related to the event led to the changes in 
study conduct and duration of those changes and indicate which trial participants were 
impacted and how those trial participants were impacted (as per the current local 
regulatory guidance). Missing protocol required data/visits due to study  continuity issues 
should be noted in participant notes and recorded as a protocol deviation.  
The purpose of the appendix is to provide information on the measures to be taken to 
protect participants’ safety, welfare , and rights, and promote data integrity.  
10.8.2.  Home Healthcare Provisioning  
If allowed by country regulation/ethics, study assessments may be conducted remotely at 
some visits during this study, the details of which are provided separately. Remote 
activities for these applicable visits, such as those described in the below section, can be 
conducted by a home healthcare professional either as arranged and overseen by the 
investigator site or by a sponsor delegated third party such as , which has been 
contracted to perform these activities in many countries if requested using virtual  
technologies  (telemedicine, secure video conferences, phone calls, or a we b portal and/or 
mobile application) .  
In addition, a fully remote metasite, wherein all visits are conducted fully remotely will 
be implemented with , where permitted by regulation/ethics.

135 10.8.3.  Protocol Defined Procedures/Visits  
• It is the responsibili ty of the investigator or designee to inform GSK when remote 
assessments are required and occur and to document in the source notes.  
• Measurement of vital signs and weight, as well as conduct of a brief physical 
exam may be conducted remotely. In some cases , brief physical exams may be 
performed as symptom directed exams or by other means as agreed with the 
investigator . 
• Clinical safety laboratory sampling, PK, biomarkers and genetic sampling and 
processing may all be conducted remotely by a home healthcare professional. 
Ancillary materials for the above laboratory sampling may also be shipped direct 
to the participant’s home address from the investigational site/depot or delegated 
third party. Collected laboratory samples can also be collected direct from th e 
participant’s home address to the central laboratory.  
• The process for laboratory sample shipments must be agreed with GSK if 
performed by the clinical site or details can be provided if performed by an agreed 
third party.  
• Additional unscheduled safety a ssessments such as routine blood sampling may 
be performed at the discretion of the Investigator including in the participant’s 
home, if deemed necessary  Biological samples should not be collected if they 
cannot be processed in a timely manner or appropria tely stored until the intended 
use.  
• If visits to a site/home are not feasible, then medical evaluation may take place by 
telemedicine which will use secure video conferences, phone calls, and a web 
portal and/or mobile application as a way of communicatin g with and monitoring 
the participant’s progress. GSK will be accountable for working with third party 
vendors to ensure the site has the required equipment, training and support for this 
model and should be notified as soon as possible by the investigator  that the 
service is required.  
• As part of this model, study visits may be completed on a virtual platform that 
connects participants to their investigators and study teams through either a study -
issued smartphone or participant’s own device (BYOD) model. T his technology 
may be used in combination with visits from mobile study personnel (e.g. mobile 
nurses) to participants’ homes for various lab collections and designated study 
procedures.  
• The study investigator is responsible for ensuring that the identifi cation, 
management, and reporting of AEs and SAEs are completed in accordance with 
the protocol and applicable regulations. AEs are first reported by participants to 
the investigator/study team or may be identified by the study team during 
interactions wit h the participants via telemedicine encounters. In addition, mobile 
nurses may identify AEs as well and report them to the investigator for 
evaluation. Additionally, AEs may be identified from lab reports, imaging or ECG 
reports, and other records. As dete rmined by the investigator, the appropriate 
medical intervention, therapeutic intervention, and/or support measures are 
TMF-16740250 - CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
136 instituted, as necessary. Participants can also request a timely secure 
videoconference with the investigator and/or site staff.  
• The par ticipant should be informed of the plan and any potential risks associated 
with the virtual medium and sign a revised Informed Consent Form if required. 
IRB/Ethics committee should be informed and/or approve of this change in 
approach and the process docum ented in study files.  
• Note : If the Investigator wishes to conduct a trial visit at a location that has not been 
previously assessed by GSK, it is the investigator’s responsibility to identify an 
adequate alternate location and to notify GSK of the alternat e location. The 
investigator should ensure that this alternate location meets ICH GCP requirements, 
is well -equipped to perform study procedures and covered by an adequate insurance. 
Furthermore, the investigator should have sufficient oversight to ensure that the staff 
at the alternate location are trained to perform study procedures.  
10.8.4.  Study Intervention(s)  
• If allowed by country regulation/ethics, then study intervention (including rescue 
study medication and ancillary supplies related to I nvestigational Medicinal Product 
(IMP)  administration) can be shipped direct -to-participant (DTP) from the 
investigational site or delegated third party, as arranged by the sponsor, to the 
participant’s home address. The process for this shipment must be agreed with GSK 
who will provide the relevant documentation and links to courier sites required to 
ensure shipments are adequately temperature controlled (if required) throughout 
transportation . 
• Used and/or unused IMP can also be collected from the participant’s home addre ss to 
the return/destruction location, either the investigational site or agreed location of 
destruction. The process for this shipment must be agreed with GSK who will 
provide operational details if this service is available.  
• Staff  at each clinical study center or the home healthcare professional (if provided by 
sponsor delegated third party)  will be responsible for supply of study intervention 
according to procedures detailed in the SRM. No special procedures for the safe 
handling of study intervention ar e required.  
• The Principal Investigator assumes Good Clinical Practice (GCP) responsibilities for 
IMP handling and the medical control for dispensing to participants. Site Staff 
should document the dispensing in the Dispensing/Accountability Logs adding a 
comment that this was a DTP dispensing.  
• Compliance with study intervention administration will be verified through 
observation by study staff or trained home healthcare professionals  if performed by 
sponsor delegated third party . 
• In some cases, trial parti cipants who no longer have access to investigational product 
or the investigational site may need additional safety monitoring (e.g., on withdrawal 
of an active investigational treatment).  
TMF-16740250 - CONFIDENTIAL  212620  
  Protocol amendment 04  
137 10.8.5.  Data Management/Monitoring  
• If on -site monitoring is no longer permitted, GSK will consider remote Source Data 
Verification/Source Document Review (SDV/SDR) where permitted by local 
regulations and the clinical site/institution. Remote SDV/SDR will be proposed to 
study sites to meet a participant and/or critical quality need, e.g., to assess participant 
safety or to ensure data integrity. In case of remote SDV/SDR, GSK will work with 
the site to ensure subject privacy.  
• eCRF/CRF Final or Interim Sign off Process: The Principal Investi gator (PI) is 
responsible for ensuring that the data within the eCRF casebook and any other data 
sources utilized during the study for each study participant is complete and 
consistent with source documents throughout the study (ICH GCP 4.9.1 4.9.2). The 
PI may sign/re -sign the eCRF from any computer/location by accessing the eDC 
platform  (Veeva CDMS ) using his/her unique eCRF log -in credentials. The PI may 
delegate this activity to another medically qualified and trained sub -investigator and 
this must be d ocumented on the Delegation of Responsibilities (DoR) Log. It is 
recommended that the PI identifies a sub -investigator as a back -up for  eCRF 
signatures. The sub -investigator must be appropriately trained on the protocol and 
eCRF requirements (with training  documented), and the DoR log updated 
accordingly.  
• Essential Document Sign Off Process: If an investigator is unable to print and sign 
essential documents such as Protocol /Amendment signature page then Email 
approval can be accepted by replying to the re levant email that is sent by GSK .

Adverse drug reaction  An adverse event where a causal relationship between a 
medicinal product and the adverse event is at least a 
reasonable possibility, i.e., the relationship cannot be 
ruled out.  
a. In the context of a clinical trial, an ADR can be 
serious or non -serious. Serious ADRs may be subject to 
expedited reporting if they are considered unexpected 
(see SUSAR definition).  
Background therapy  Type of medicina l product administered to each of the 
clinical trial participant, regardless of randomization 
group, to treat the indication that is the object of the 
study. Background treatment is generally considered to 
be the current standard care for the particular in dication. 
In these trials, the IMP is given in addition to the 
background treatment and safety efficacy are assessed. 
The protocol  may require that the IMP plus the 
background treatment is compared with an active 
comparator or with placebo plus background treatment .  
Blinding  A procedure in which 1 or more parties to the study are 
kept unaware of the intervention assignment in order to 
reduce the risk of biased study outcomes. The level of 
blinding is maintained throughout the conduct of the 
study, and only when the data are cleaned to an 
acceptable level of quality will appropriate personnel be 
unblinded or when required in case of a SAE.  
In a double -blind study, the participant, the investigator 
and sponsor staff who are involved in the treatment or 
clinical evaluation of the participants and the review or 
analysis of data are all unaware of the intervention 
assignment.  
Certified copy  A copy (irrespective of the type of media used) of the 
original record that has been verified (i.e. by a dated 
signature or by generation through a validated process) 
to have the same information, including data that 
describe the context, content, and structure, as the 
original.

Pharmacogenomics  The ICH E15 Guidance for Industry defines 
pharmacogenomics as the “Study of variation of DNA 
and RNA characteristics as related to drug or treatment 
response.”  
Pharmacogenetics, a subset of pharmacogenomics, is 
“the study of va riations in DNA sequence as related to 
drug response.” Pharmacogenomic biomarkers include 
germline (host) DNA and RNA as well as somatic 
changes (e.g., mutations) that occur in cells or tissues.  
Pharmacogenomic biomarkers are not limited to human 
samples but include samples from viruses and infectious 
agents as well as animal samples. The term 
pharmacogenomic experiment includes both the 
generation of new genetic or genomic (DNA and/or 
RNA) data with subsequent analysis as well as the 
analysis of existing genetic or genomic data to 
understand drug or treatment response (PK, safety, 
efficacy or effectiveness, mode of action).  
Proteomic and metabolomic biomarker research is not 
pharmacogenomics.

PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT:  Phase III 
STUDY DESIGN  Parallel arm, randomis ed, open study  
INCLUSION CRITERIA  
1. Known CAH due to 21 -hydroxylase deficiency (classic CAH) diagnosed in childhood with 
documented (at any time) elevated 17-hydroxyprogestero ne (17-OHP ) and/or androstenedione (A4) 
and currently treated with hydrocortisone, prednisone, prednisolone or dexamethasone (or a 
combination of the aforementioned glucocorticoids) on a stable glucocorticoid therapy for a minimum 
of 6 months.  
2. Male or fema le subject s aged 18 and above.  
3. Provision of signed written informed consent.  
4. Non-pregnant , non -lactating females who are  post menopausal, naturally or surgically sterile, or of 
childbearing potential with a negative urinary pregnancy test and using a medic ally acceptable method 
of contraception  (Note: females presenting with oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea who are aged ≤55 
years of age should be considered potentially fertile and therefore, as well as undergoing pregnancy 
testing like all other female subjec ts, will be expected to be using an acceptable method of 
contraception ). 
5. Plasma renin activity  (PRA)  less than 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening  or within 
3 months prior to screening , except in subject s who have been diagnosed with hyp ertension where the 
renin is not being used to monitor fludrocortisone replacement.  
EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
1. Co-morbid condition requiring daily  administration of a medication (or consumption of any material) 
that interferes with the metabolism of glucocorticoi ds. 
2. Clinical or biochemical evidence of hepatic or renal disease. Creatinine over twice the ULN or 
elevated liver function tests (ALT or AST >2 times the ULN).  
3. Subject s on regular daily inhaled , topical , nasal  or oral steroids for any indication other than CAH.  
4. Subject s with any  other significant medical or psychiatric conditions that in the opinion of the 
investigator would preclude participation in the trial.  
5. History of malignancy (other than basal cell carcinoma successfully treated >6 months prior to en try 
into the study).  
6. Participation in another clinical trial of an investigational or licensed drug or device within the 3 
months prior to inclusion in this study.  
7. Subject s with a history of bilateral adrenalectomy.  
8. Subject s having previously been exposed to Chronocort®. 
9. Subjects who routinely work night shifts and so do not sleep during the usual nighttime hours.  
10. Subject s unable to comp ly with the requirements of the protocol . 
STUDY DURATION:  
After screening and baseline evaluation,  subject s will either be randomi sed to Chronocort® or continue their 
standard therapy . Treatment will continue for 6 months, during which times the glucocorticoid dose  in both 
treatment groups will be titrated according t o an agreed algorithm to optimis e control of the disease . After

Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 completion of the 6 -month study period, all subjects may then enter a period of open -label treatment with 
Chronocort® as part of  an open -label extension  study  (to be co nducted  under a separate protocol) . 
NUMBER OF SUBJECTS : 
A sample size of 102 sub jects provides greater than 95% power and 2 -sided alpha 5% to demonstrate a fall in 
the logarithm of the mean daily unsigned standard deviation score of 17 -OHP  relative to the standard 
glucocorticoid replacement therapy  group . It is assumed that (i) the me an fall in the Chronocort® group will be 
the same (0.78) as that observed in the phase II study (DIUR -003) (ii) the mean fall in the standard therapy 
group will be 0.2 (approximately 25% of the Chronocort® phase II study  fall) and (iii) the standard deviat ion 
of the fall (0.681) is that seen in the phase II study . The study is powered to ensure that there can be a reasonable 
description of the comparison of Chronocort® with a variety of standard therapies . 120 subjects will be 
randomised to this study which  will account for an inevaluability rate of 15%. Individual sites  should not recruit 
more than 25 subject s without first consulting the s ponsor.  
TEST PRODUCT, DOSE AND 
MODE OF ADMINISTRATION : Chronocort® will be provided as 5mg, 10mg and 20mg capsules  for 
oral administration . The starting dose for each subject  will be based 
on the subject ’s previous glucocorticoid therapy dose  and then dose 
titrated to effect . The morning dose of  Chronocort® (approximately 
1/3rd of the total daily dose) should be taken at 07:00 hours on an 
empty stomach at least 1 hour before a meal and the evening dose 
(approximately 2/3rd of the total daily dose) should be taken at 23:00 
hours  at least 2 hours after the last meal of the day.   
REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE 
AND MODE OF 
ADMINISTR ATION:  Continuing previous oral glucocorticoid therapy titrated to effect . 
OBJECTIVES:  
Primary Objectives : 
To demonstrate the superior efficacy of Chronocort® compared with standard glucocorticoid replacement 
therapy in the treatment of CAH based on 17 -OHP. 
Secondary Objectives : 
In adult subject s with CAH:  
 To assess the safety and tolerability of Chronocort® treatment in adult subject s with CAH over a  
6-month period.  
 To assess the efficacy of Chronocort® with regard to the effect on A4 over the 6 -month tr eatment 
period . 
 To assess the impact of Chronocort® on body composition (using dual energy X -ray absorbtimetry 
[DEXA]) – fat mass, lean mass and total bone density – at selected sites. 
Exploratory Objectives:  
 To assess the efficacy of Chronocort® with rega rd to the effect on testosterone levels over the 6 -month 
treatment period . 
 To assess the impact of Chronocort® on cardiovascular (CV) risk (evaluated using high -sensitivity 
C-reactive protein [hsCRP]) . 
 To assess the impact of Chronocort® on bone markers of serum C -terminal cross -linked telopeptide 
(CTX)  and osteocalcin  (after fasting) . 
 To assess changes from baseline in glucose and insulin in the morning (after fasting)  
 To assess changes from baseline in  glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) and PRA  in the morning . 
 To assess the impact of Chronocort® on quality of life (QoL) using SF -36®, Multidimensional 
Assessment of Fatigue (MAF), and EQ -5D™ . 
 To assess subject  compliance in subject s treated with Chronocort® over a 6 -month period.  
ENDPOINT S: 
Primary Endpoint:  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to 24 weeks of the mean of the 24 -hour standard 
deviation score ( SDS) profile for 17 -OHP . The SDS profile is calculated as the SDS of log -transformed 
17-OHP concentration unsigned .

Page 7 of 91 
Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 Secondary Endpoints : 
1. The change from baseline to 24 weeks of the mean of the 24 -hour SDS profile for A4 (calculated in the 
same way as the primary endpoint).  
2. The presentation of 17 -OHP and A4 by individual baseline treatment strata in the study will be presented 
in the same manner as the primary endpoint ( using 24 -hour SDS profile at 24 weeks) . 
3. 17-OHP and A4 level s at 09:00  as a responder analysis (i.e. the number of subjects achieving results in 
the optimal range) . 
4. Changes relative to standard glucocorticoid replacement ther apy in body composition (DEXA)  (fat mass, 
lean mass and total bone density) to be measured at all sites except Germany.  
Exploratory Endpoints:  
1. Partial area under the curve (AUC)  of 17 -OHP at 15:00 -23:00, 23:00 -07:00, and 07:00 -15:00  (all refer to 
actual c lock time of sampling) . 
2. The primary endpoint measure will also be presented for the profiles measured at 4 and 12 weeks  for the 
purposes of titration.  
3. Changes relative to standard treatment in the following:  
a. Bone markers – serum CTX  and osteocalcin  (after fasting)  
b. hsCRP  
c. Assessment of glucose and insulin in the morning (after fasting)  
d. Assessment of HbA1c, total testosterone, and PRA  in the morning  
e. QoL using SF -36®, MAF, and EQ -5D™  
4. Use of glucocorticoids at beginning and end of the study will be presented bot h as individual 
glucocorticoids used, and as calculated hydrocortisone equivalents using accepted conversion constants 
for the calculations.  
Safety Endpoints:  
1. Routine haematology, biochemistry, physical examination, vital signs, urinalysis, electrocardiog ram 
(ECG).  
2. Clinical adverse events ( AEs) – particular note of use of sick day rules and Addisonian crises . Under or 
over-replacement with glucocorticoids will be considered in the efficacy endpoints.  
3. Changes relative to the standard treatment in weight, bo dy mass index (BMI), waist circumference, and 
blood pressure (BP) . 
METHODOLOGY:  
As part of the baseline assessment , subject s will be admitted overnight  for a 24-hour endocrine profile whilst 
on their standard therapy . Subject s will attend the study site in the morning  and have a profile taken: 17 -OHP 
and A4 at 15:00, 17:00, 19:00, 21:00, 23:00, 01:00, 03:00, 05:00, 07:00, 09:00, 11:00, 13:00  and 15:00 . 
Baseline bloods will be taken on the second morning and will include: safety  measure ment s, all secondary 
endpoints to be measured – PRA , fasting osteocalcin and CTX, DEXA scan for body composition (except 
Germany) (DEXA scan may be performed at other times up to 2 weeks before baseline if scheduling proves 
difficult), insulin and glucose, HbA1c, QoL, height, weight  (BMI to be calculated)  and waist circumference . 
After these measure ment s have been tak en, the subject  will be randomis ed to Chronocort® or to continue on 
their standard care. Randomisation will be stratified by baseline treatment:  
1. hydrocortisone onl y or 
2. prednisone or prednisolone, alone or in combination with hydrocortisone   
3. dexamethasone only or in combination with any other gl ucorticoid  
The i nitial dose setting  at the start of the  Chronocort® treatment  will be based on hydrocortisone dose 
equivalen t of baseline therapy in accordance with standard clinical practice.  Further dose refinement/titration 
will be conducted in both treatment groups as necessary after 4 weeks and 12 weeks using a standardis ed 
titration algorithm after the subject  has been re -admitted for further 24-hour profiles, to include 17 -OHP and 
A4. Safety endpoints and PRA  will also be measured at the 07:00  morning sample at each profile.  
At 6 months, all the baseline tests wil l be repeated (including the 24 -hour profile) . All subject s may then 
continue on Chronocort®, whatever their randomi sed treatment , as part of an open -label extension study  (to 
be conducted under  a separate protocol).  
Blinding:  The decision to change doses in both treatment groups will be made by a n independent bl inded 
physician  but the actual change in dose will be made by the local investigator looking after the subject . The 
intention of dose a djustment is to optimis e control of CAH according to current standard of care based on 
subject  symptoms and the measurem ent of androgens , as is currently recommended to clinical practice .  
Stress doses of hydrocortisone will be given for intercurrent illnesses as medically indicated according to 
“sick day rules” . Fludrocortisone dose adjustment will be allowed if medically indicated and will be based on

Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 BP measurements and laboratory data (goal supine PRA above the lower limit and < 1.5 times ULN ). 
o Dose changes  in both treatment groups will be under the direction of an independent blinded 
physician and will be made following an inpatient assessment of symptoms and androgen levels.  
o Dose adjustment will be based on clinical symptoms using the “signs and symptoms of adrenal 
insufficiency questionnaire” and the measurement of the 17 -OHP and A4 profile s. 
o The 5 samples taken between  01:00 and 09:00 will reflect the glucocorticoid dose taken in the 
evening or last thing at night on standard or Chronocort® therapy  and the 5 samples taken between 
11:00 and 19:00 will reflect the morning  glucocorticoid dose  on standard or Chronocort® therapy. 
Dose adjus tments will be considered if 3  or more of the 5 sample times show out of range values for 
17-OHP or A4.  
For subject s continuing on standard therapy the local investigator can change the daytime and evening doses  
of the standard therapy (within the limits set by the independent blinded physician ) but the timing and the 
drugs used  must not be changed . Dose adjustment  will use the lowest dose adjustment available with the 
specific therapy , so genera lly for hydrocortisone this will be 5mg, for p rednisolone 1mg and dexamethasone 
0.25mg.  
Where 17-OHP and A4 show inconsistent trends the A4 parameter will take precedence in directing dose 
adjustment . 
If required, d ose a djustments will be made within 2  weeks of the week 4 and week 12 visits  when 
biochemical results are reviewed.  
 All s ubject s (whether or not there has been a titration) will receive a telephone call one week after 
any dose adjustments to enquire as to whether there have been any AEs, and reinforce any other 
protocol requirements . 
 No dos e adjustments outside of the protocol -defined dose adjustments should be conducted, unless 
clinical signs and symptoms indicate an immediate need. In such cases the Sponsor’s medical 
monitor must be contacted (preferably before any dose changes are impleme nted). Any such 
unscheduled dose adjustments should be based on clinical symptoms only, with repeated androgen 
testing discouraged and must be pre -approved by the Sponsor’s medical monitor .The rationale for 
any dose adjustment, by both the independent blinded physician  and also any changes made by the 
local investigator, will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF).  
 In subject s who have undetectable androgens at baseline on their regular medication , caution will be 
taken over dose reduction so as to avoid the risk of suppressed pituitary -adrenal axis occurring in 
these subject s. 
STATISTICAL METHODS:    
The Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) must be finalised before any subject is randomised into the trial.   
Efficacy:  The primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to 24 weeks in the primary efficacy 
variable (natural logarithm of the mean over the 24 -hour SDS profile for 17 -OHP). The primary efficacy 
endpoint will be compared between treatment groups within a Normal linear analysis of cov ariance 
(ANCOVA) model with baseline treatment category and baseline SDS as covariates. Exploratory analyses will 
investigate the sensitivity of the results to the transformation of the endpoint and to the form of the model. 
Secondary endpoints will also b e analysed as a change from pre -randomisation baseline to end -of-study. To 
ensure that the treatment effect of Chronocort® is not all as a result of non -hydrocortisone based regimes being 
different in achieving control, the effect of Chronocort® within bas eline treatment subgroups will be presented.   
Safety:  Summary vital signs change from baseline data will be presented in tabular form, by dose level across 
time, with N, mean, standard deviation (SD), median, quartiles, minimum and maximum as appropriate.  
Summary ECG (heart rate, PR interval, QRS width, QT interval and QTC interval) change from baseline data 
will be presented in tabular form, by dose level across time, with N, n, mean, SD, median, minimum and 
maximum as appropriate.  
AEs will be coded usin g the latest version of the MedDRA drug dictionary. Data will be summarised using 
preferred term and primary system organ class. Only treatment -emergent AEs, being events with an onset at 
or after the first administration of study drug, will be presented i n summary tables. Where changes in severity 
are recorded in the eCRF, the most severe incidence of the AE will be reported in the tables. Rates will be 
calculated as the proportion of subjects with at least one AE related to the number of subjects treated in each 
treatment group. Frequency tables will be provided concerning severity and drug relationship.

from pre -dose to each time point for laboratory variables (haematology, biochemistry) will be presented. The 
3 x 3 cross tabulations (from low, normal and high to low, normal and high) will be pr esented by treatment

Introduction 
 
Overview 
 
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), generally due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, is a disease 
of the adrenal cortex characterised by cortisol deficiency with or without aldosterone 
de
ficiency, and androgen excess. The severe or classic form occurs in 1 in 15,000 births 
worldwide (Merke 2005; Pang 1993; Therrell 2001), while the mild non-classic form is a 
common cause of hyperandrogenism (New 2006) . The discovery of glucocorticoid therapy as 
a treatment for CAH occurred in the 1950s resulting in subjects with classic CAH surviving . 
However, existing glucocorticoid treatment remains suboptimal and many unresolved clinical 
problems exist (Han et al. 2014).  
 
The
re is currently no standard treatment for this condition, and the glucocorticoid therapies 
currently used often fail to normalise the growth and development of children with CAH. Also 
adults may experience iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome, hyperandrogenism, infertility or the 
development of the metabolic syndrome (Arlt 2010). Chronocort®, a newly-developed 
modified release oral formulation of hydrocortisone, is designed to mimic the normal serum 
levels of the endogenous cortisol circadian rhythm, offering the prospect of an improved 
treatment outcome. The proposed study will evaluate whether a twice a day dosing regimen of 
Chronocort® given at night and in the morning (which can more closely normalise cortisol 
levels) will improve control of adrenal androgen production (as measured by 
17-hydroxyprogesterone [17-OHP] and androstenedione [A4] ). 
 
Overview
 of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia  
 
The adrenal cortex secretes the stress hormone cortisol, a glucocorticoid steroid that regulates 
energy balance and many intracellular processes. Cortisol synthesis is stimulated by 
adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), which increases the synthesis of the cytochrome P 
(CYP) enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of cortisol. ACTH secretion by the pituitary, 
in turn, is increased by hypothalamic secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), 
which is partly regulated by the central ‘zeitgeber’, or clock. Both ACTH and CRH secretion 
are inhibited by hypercortisolism. The adrenal cortex also secretes aldosterone, a 
mineralocorticoid steroid hormone that regulates sodium, potassium and water balance. 
 
The pathophysiology of 21-hydroxylase deficiency-related adrenal hyperplasia is closely 
linked to the degree of enzyme deficiency. In the most severe form, concomitant aldosterone 
deficiency leads to salt loss and dehydration. In CAH, the defect in cortisol biosynthesis leads 
to a compensatory increase in ACTH and hypothalamic CRH due to a lack of the usual negative 
feedback by cortisol. Conventional glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid replacement doses 
fail to replicate the close temporal relationship between CRH, ACTH and subsequent cortisol 
pulses (Krieger 1971; Ross 2005). Supraphysiologic doses of glucocorticoid are often 
necessary to adequately suppress excess adrenal androgen and oestrogen production (Cutler 
1990; Merke 2001). Thus subjects with treated CAH are often poorly controlled on current 
standard therapy.  
 
Conventional medical treatment of CAH is often a difficult balancing act between the 
undesirable states of hypercortisolism and hyperandrogenism (Han 2014). Subjects with CAH 
are
 at risk of developing a number of clinical manifestations, such as obesity in children 
(Cornean 1998), insulin resistance (Azziz 1994; Moran 2000; New 1993; Speiser 1985), and

ycystic ovaries, which may contribute to infertility in women with CAH . Oligomenorrhoea 
or amenorrhoea may be present in adolescence (Barnes 1994; Deneux 2001). The development 
of ectopic adrenal tissue or adrenal rest tissue is also associated with CAH. 
 
Overview of Chronocort® 
 
The active ingredient of Chronocort® is hydrocortisone. The safety profile of hydrocortisone is 
well characterised in humans and there is extensive clinical experience with the use of 
hydrocortisone in subjects with CAH. The excipients (inactive ingredients) used in the 
Chronocort® formulation under investigation are also well-characterised and are approved for 
use in humans at the proposed levels. The Chronocort® formulation has been manufactured and 
is supplied in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP). The risks of 
Chronocort® are, therefore, expected to be no greater than the risks of an equivalent dose of 
cortisol. 
 
Chronocort® is a patented oral modified release formulation of hydrocortisone which is 
intended to mimic, or closely match, the serum levels of endogenous cortisol, thereby 
improving the treatment of subjects with CAH. The rationale for Chronocort® is based on the 
belief that the delivery of a physiological cortisol profile will offer significant clinical benefits 
over current treatment. Formulations of immediate release (IR) hydrocortisone and other 
glucocorticoids used in the treatment of CAH are recognised to be unsatisfactory due to issues 
with: 
 
 subopt imal disease control  
 risk of  glucocorticoid over-treatment 
 inconve nient dosing regimens 
 c omplex and inconsistent protocols for monitoring therapy 
 poor subject compliance 
 
Mimicry of the physiological cortisol profile is achieved by a delayed release and sustained 
absorption profile, such that when the dosage form is administered at night time (approximately 
23:00 hours) there is a period of absence of drug release followed by a period of sustained 
absorption, to yield an elevation in serum cortisol concentration according to the normal 
circadian profile, with peak concentration occurring in the morning (approximately 06:00-
08:00 hours) (Whitaker 2014; Mallappa 2015). 
 
Rat
ionale for the use of Chronocort® in the treatment of CAH 
 
Subjects with classic CAH receive replacement glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid. Many 
diff
erent regimens of glucocorticoid are advocated. Hormone levels are monitored prior to 
morning dose of medication, aiming for mildly elevated morning 17- OHP  levels and normal 
renin levels (Joint LWPES/ESPE CAH Working Group 2002; Merke 2005; Speiser 2003) . 
Physical features and clinical symptoms are monitored for evidence of excessive (e.g. obesity, 
striae, and decreased linear growth in children) or insufficient (e.g. hirsutism, amenorrhoea or 
viriliation in women, fatigue, and increased linear growth, early puberty, advanced bone 
maturation in children) treatment. It is often quite difficult to reduce excess androgen without 
giving excess glucocorticoid because current therapies cannot replace the normal circadian 
rhythm of cortisol.

hronocort® is a newly-developed formulation of hydrocortisone that allows for slow 
absorption after oral administration when given at 23:00 hours (20mg) and 07:00 hours (10mg), 
so that cortisol levels peak in the early morning (Whitaker 2014) . The compound has the unique 
potential to provide the best possible physiologic replacement of cortisol and promises to 
ameliorate many of the unresolved medical issues surrounding the management of subject s 
with CAH (Mallappa 2015).  
 
Over
view of Chronocort® clinical studies  
 
One
 Phase I study has been completed to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of Chronocort® 
(study DIUR-002) (Whitaker 2014). Study DIUR-002 fully characterised the PK performance 
a
nd dose proportionality of Chronocort®. The target PK criteria, commensurate with the 
endogenous circadian profile for cortisol, were as follows: mean C max >300nmol/L 
(>10.8 mcg/dL) for the 20mg dose, T max a pproximately 6-8 h ours post-dosing to prime waking, 
mean cortisol level >100nmol/L (>3.6mcg/dL) up to 16:00 hours, mean cortisol level 
<100nmol/L (>3.6mcg/dL) after 22:00 hours, and relative bioavailability >80%. In study 
DIUR-002, all assessment criteria were met.  
 
Study DIUR-003 (Phase II pilot study) was conducted in 16 subjects at a single site, the 
National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, USA (Mallappa 
2015). DIUR-003 evaluated the PK profile of cortisol following short-term twice-daily 
administration of Chronocort® (20mg at night and 10mg in morning) in subjects with CAH and 
this was compared with data from healthy volunteers in the Phase I study. It also examined the 
effects of both short-term and long-term treatment with Chronocort® on key disease-related 
biochemical markers and other indices of efficacy/ PK. The study evaluated 16 subj ects with 
CAH over a 6-month period. A ll subjects started the study on 30mg daily (given as 10mg at 
07:00 and 20mg at 23:00), with dose titration then taking place within 2 weeks, following 
investi
gator review of biochemical and clinical parameters.  
  
The
 PK profile of Chronocort® after 20mg at 23:00 and 10mg at 07:00 in subjects with CAH 
was similar to that seen in the Phase I clinical study (DIUR-002). The PK profile was 
characterised by an overnight rise in cortisol levels reaching a maximal concentration 
approximately 8 hours post-dosing, consistent with the physiological endogenous profile of 
cortisol reported in normal individuals. The variation in C max and area under the curve ( AUC ) 
was similar to that seen in physiological cortisol levels in healthy volunteers.  
 
This 
physiological replacement of cortisol with Chronocort® improved the control of disease-
related biomarker androgens in subjects (control compared to baseline standard therapy). This 
was achieved with a similar dose of glucocorticoid; the mean hydrocortisone dose equivalent 
on standard therapy was 28mg and on Chronocort® was 26mg. On standard therapy at baseline, 
the majority of subjects had uncontrolled androgen levels, with most having high levels of 
17-OHP and A4. Following 6-months titration with Chronocort®, the majority of subjects had 
17-OHP and A4 levels in the normal or optimal range (see Figure 1).

the
rapy at baseline and after the first administration of Chronocort® (Day 1) and

The
re were no safety issues reported in DIUR-002. There were no serious adverse events 
(SAEs)
 and no events leading to withdrawal from study DIUR-003. Two groups of adverse 
e
vents (AEs) were considered sufficiently remarkable to warrant examination at the time: 5 
cases of anaemia and 4 cases of median nerve entrapment (carpal tunnel) syndrome. The 
anaemia cases were all consistent with acute low level red cell reduction attributable to blood 
loss secondary to the blood draws related to the study. The aetiology of the carpal tunnel 
syndrome was not clear, although thought most likely to be due to increased fluid retention. 
All events were mild and their relationship to the investigational medicinal product (IMP) was 
unc
ertain. All subjects recovered and the findings were not considered to alter the risk/benefit 
analysis or to raise cause for concern. 
 
Study DIUR-004 was an open-label, randomised, single dose, 3-period, crossover study in 18 
healthy male volunteers that was designed to assess the impact of food on the PK of 
Chronocort®. The study also evaluated the relative bioavailability of Chronocort® and 
immediate release hydrocortisone in the fasted state to support dosing in clinical practice. The 
results of this study are currently being analysed, but preliminary PK data indicate that food 
may have an effect on the dosing of Chronocort®. Thus in this study it is recommended that the 
morning dose of Chronocort® is taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before a meal and 
the evening dose should be taken at least 2 hours after the last meal of the day. One subject had 
mild AEs of epigastric pain and shortness of breath that were considered not related to the study 
drug (both were considered related to dexamethasone administration). Both events commenced 
together more than 4 days after dosing and lasted 11 days. The subject was withdrawn from 
the study as a result of these events. A second subject reported an AE of headache, but this 
occurred 14 days pre-dose and lasted 1.5 hours and no there was no causal relationship with 
the study drug.

roposed study   
The proposed study aims to build on the results of study DIUR-003 and further evaluate 
whether Chronocort® can provide improved control of serum androgen levels (using 17- OHP  
and A4  as markers) compared to current glucocorticoid treatment regimens. 
 
Benefit/Risk Assessment 
The subjects in this study have classic CAH. As such, they have an absolute requirement for 
lifelong glucocorticoid replacement therapy. It is proposed that the formulation of 
hydrocortisone being evaluated in this study, Chronocort®, has characteristics that may 
improve the outcome in patients with CAH. 
 
The currently used glucocorticoid replacement therapies do not accurately replicate 
physiological cortisol profiles. Chronocort® is a novel modified-release formulation of 
hydrocortisone that has been shown to closely mimic the physiological circadian profile of 
cortisol. It is hypothesised that this will provide improved CAH disease control. Results of 
clinical trials using Chronocort® have demonstrated that cortisol levels on Chronocort® 
approximated physiologic cortisol rhythm over 24 hours, and  improved control of  androgens 
in su
bjects with CAH when compared to baseline conventional glucocorticoid therapy.  
 
The risks associated with this study include those associated with blood sampling and general 
involvement with clinical trials. The investigators in this trial are all highly experienced both 
in clinical trials and in the management of patients with CAH, and these risks are then 
negligable. In addition, to minimise the risk of anaemia associated with the withdrawal of 
multiple blood samples for laboratory testing (as seen in a previous study), the planned total 
blood volume to be withdrawn during this study has been limited to a maximum of 427mL . 
The other risks then relate to the potential under- or over-treatment of subjects with 
glucocorticoids as seen in day- to-day clinical practice. These risks apply to both conventional 
treatment and Chronocort®. The patients will be informed of the potential for under-treatment 
(a
s occurs when there is an intercurrent illness) and are taught to manage this with supplemental 
steroids (emergency pack for sick day rules) and to seek medical assistance. It is also possible 
that the new formulation of Chronocort® might fail to release properly in the gut with resultant 
low levels of cortisol. If this were to occur once, the associated risk would be low, as a 
subsequent dose would be given either 8 or 16 hours later with little consequence.  It would be 
hazardous if this occurred repeatedly.  However, the formulation technology used is commonly 
used for other pharmaceuticals, and the studies so far in healthy subjects and subjects with 
CAH do not suggest that this happens. If this were to occur, then sick day rules would come 
into force as the subjects would become unwell. Such episodes would also be identified as AEs, 
which would come to the notice of the Data Safety Management Board (DSMB). The DSMB 
will meet on a regular basis during the study to review the safety data and will operate in 
a
ccordance with a predefined charter. 
 
Over-treatment with hydrocortisone is unfortunately common in this condition as physicians 
try to control the cortisol levels.  Regular assessment of the subjects (both biochemically and 
clinically) in the study will identify over-treatment and correct it through a reduction in dose.  
 
Thus the potential risks of the study are minimised and mitigated through investigator 
oversight, use of sick day rules by the individual patients when needed, and specific study 
activities (titration of dose, and identification of AEs). All subjects will be given the relevant 
information about the the risks and potential benefits of the study and all subjects have to sign

 consent form prior to inclusion in the study that meets all the requirements of GCP and 
national regulations.  
 
The risks of Chronocort® are expected to be no greater than the risks of an equivalent dose of 
hydrocortisone and similar to the risks associated with current glucocorticoid therapy the 
subject is receiving at entry into this study. However, the delivery of hydrocortisone with 
C
hronocort® has been demonstrated to produce a cortisol profile more similar to the 
endogenous cortisol profile than current immediate-release hydrocortisone formulations and 
thi
s is expected to result in improved disease control in patients with CAH. For subjects in the 
study
, the potential benefits exceed the potential risks.

therapy in the treatment of CAH over a treatment period of 6 months. 
 
A 
previous phase II study (a two-part, single cohort, open label multiple dose protocol 
[DIUR-003]) demonstrated that Chronocort®, whe n given in a twice a day regimen in subjects 
with CAH, enables physiological replacement of cortisol,  which results in improved control of 
androgens without increasing glucocorticoid exposure (Mallappa 2015). Chronocort®, in 
contrast to hydrocortisone IR, achieved a physiological profile. Dosing times for study 
D
IUR-003 were 23:00 hours and 07:00 hours, and these timings will be continued for the 
pre
sent phase III study . Subject reported outcomes were used in study DIUR-003, which are

lso to be included in this phase III study. The results gained in the phase II protocol have been 
used in the design of this phase III study with regard to dosage, endpoint selection and sample 
size. Additionally, a phase I food effect study has recently been completed, with preliminary 
results indicating that food may have an effect on the dosing of Chronocort®. Thus in this study 
it is recommended that the morning dose of Chronocort® is taken on an empty stomach at least 
1 hour before a meal and the evening dose should be taken at least 2 hours after the last meal 
of the day. 
 
There is a wide variation in standard therapy for this indication. In order to ensure treatment is

rdised, the protocol requires that subjects are on a stable glucocorticoid therapy for a 
minimum of 6 months prior to study participation, and it is this period that will characterise the 
subjects and their baseline characteristics, and is effectively the run-in period for the study.  
 
D
ue to the wide variance in standard therapy for this condition, this study has been designed 
as an open study rather than a blinded study. The randomisation either to Chronocort® or to 
continue on their original therapy will be stratified with regard to the subject’s prior treatment. 
The number of subjects in the study will be closely monitored via the interactive web response 
system (IWRS) system until a total of 120 subjects are randomised in the study. This number 
of 
subjects provides greater than 95% power, with a 2-sided alpha of 5% to demonstrate a fall 
in the mean daily unsigned standard deviation SDS of 17-OHP, which is 20% less than that 
seen in the phase II study. 
 
Dose
 titration decisions in both treatment groups will be made by an independent blinded 
ph
ysician, blinded to the treatment arm. This will be carried out within 2 weeks of each 
prof
iling visit at weeks 4 and 12 using a standard titration algorithm after the subject has been 
r
e-admitted for 24-hour profiles that include 17-OHP and A4 . The use of an independent 
blinded physician will minimise bias in the management of subjects in this open study. Each 
treatment arm will be subject to the same titration rules throughout the study, ensuring that 
opportunities for optimisation and control of androgens are the same in both groups. It is 
intended that dose adjustment should optimise control of CAH according to the current 
standard of care based on subject symptoms and measurement of androgens as is currently 
recommended for clinical practice. 
 
As this is an open study, measures have been taken to minimise any potential bias as follows: 
 
1. R ecords will be kept of any subjects screened, whether or not they enter the study. This 
will enable an assessment of the representative nature of the subjects randomised. 
2. R andomisation will be carried out by IWRS, stratified by 3 baseline treatment groups 
a
ccording to the subjects current treatment: 
a. hydrocortisone only or 
b. prednisone or prednisolone alone or in combination with hydrocortisone  
c. dexamethasone only or in combination with any other glucorticoid 
3. The  titration of the subject’s dose of study treatment following the hormone profiles at 
4 
weeks and 12 weeks will be directed by an independent blinded physician, minimising 
bias in t
he management of subjects.  
4. Care  will be taken not to dose adjust for the Chronocort® arm of the study at baseline 
by selecting the initial dose following randomisation on the equivalent glucocorticoid 
dose at baseline, rather than basing it on hormone levels or symptoms. By using this 
method both arms will effectively continue on their baseline glucocorticoid dosage.

its ascertainment. 
6. Efforts will be made to ensure that all subjects remain in the study and are evaluable . 
Subjects completing the study will become eligible for an open extension study, in 
which all subjects will be offered Chronocort® (this will be conducted under a separate 
protocol).

determined by an independent statistician and will not be communicated to the study 
team. 
 
Written informed consent for the study will be obtained from subjects who have been stable on 
their current treatment for a minimum of 6 months. Subjects will be screened and entered in 
the stu
dy provided they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. 120 subjects will be randomised 
int
o this study (see Subject Stratification below) to obtain 102 evaluable subjects (individual 
sit

aseline Assessment and Randomisation (2 - day visit) 
Subjects will be called in for the Baseline Visit (Visit 1) and admitted overnight for a 24-hour 
e
ndocrine profile whilst remaining on their standard therapy. Subjects will have 17-OHP and 
A4 measured at 13 t ime points. On the second morning baseline bloods will be taken together 
with
 all safety measures and all secondary endpoint measurements (see Section 11).  
 
Af
ter the completion of the baseline profile, the subject will be randomised either to receive 
C
hronocort® or to continue on standard care. 120 subjects will be randomised (see Section 11). 
 
The
 initial dose setting at the start of Chronocort® treatment will be made on hydrocortisone 
dose equivalent of baseline therapy, with the hydrocortisone dose calculated as prednisone dose 
multiplied by 5 and dexamethasone dose multiplied by 80 (up to a maximum starting dose of 
Chronocort® 30mg, split as 20mg at night and 10mg in the morning)  Chronocort® will be given 
at 23:00 hours (approximately 2/3rd of the total daily dose) and 07:00 hours (approximately 
1/3rd of the total daily dose). The first dose of Chronocort® will be taken at 23:00 hours on Day 
2 of the baseline visit. Subjects will be asked to write on the pack the dose, date and time they 
took the first dose of study medication (Chronocort® or standard therapy). 
 
Dose Adjustment 
 
Dose adjustment in both treatment groups will be made, if necessary, within 2 weeks of Visits 
2 
(4 weeks) and 4 (12 weeks). The decision to change dose will be made by an independent 
bli
nded physician but the actual treatment change will be made by the local investigator. The 
independent blinded physician will determine either that no change is required or that an 
increase/decrease in the morning/midday/evening medication is needed. In the event that a 
change in the midday dose is advised for a subject who is receiving Chronocort or in a subject 
who is receiving twice daily dosing of standard therapy, the local investigator must decide to 
make this dose change at the most appropriate timepoint in their judgement (morning or 
evening),  in addition to any changes already advised for morning and evening doses, so that 
the total change advised is accommodated within the day. For each subject, the independent 
blinded physician will record whether or not a treatment change is required in the electronic 
case report form (e CRF ). The local investigator will be informed so they can make the change 
to the prescription and the local investigator will document whether or not a change is required 
in the subject notes, using the eCRF as the source document for this information. All subjects 
will receive a telephone call to inform them whether or not their dose will change.  The local 
investigator will ensure the subject receives clear instructions in writing (emails are acceptable) 
following the telephone call. All subjects will receive a further telephone call one week after 
the first call (whether or not dose adjustment has been recommended) to assess any AEs and 
reinforce any other protocol requirements. 
 
No dose adjustments outside of the protocol-defined dose adjustments should be conducted, 
unless clinical signs and symptoms indicate an immediate need. In such cases the Sponsor’s 
medical monitor must be contacted (preferably before any dose changes are implemented). Any 
such unscheduled dose adjustments should be based on clinical symptoms only, with repeated 
androgen testing discouraged and must be pre-approved by the Sponsor’s medical monitor. 
Rationale for any dose adjustment, by both the independent blinded physician and also any 
changes made by the local investigator, will be recorded in the e CRF . With intercurrent illness, 
sick day rules apply (see Appendix 4 for an example). In subjects w ith undetectable androgen

ls at baseline who are on regular medication, caution will be taken over dose reduction so 
a
s to avoid the risk of adrenal insufficiency in subjects with a suppressed pituitary-adrenal axis. 
 
Dose adjustment by the independent blinded physician will be based on clinical symptoms 
using the “signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency questionnaire” (Appendix 5) and the 
measurement of the 17-OHP and A4 profiles. The adrenal insufficiency questionnaire should 
onl
y be used to determine if symptoms of under or over replacement of glucocorticoids have 
occurred since the last visit – it should not be used to record AEs due to other causes. 
 
o The  independent blinded physician will review the signs and symptoms of adrenal 
insufficiency questionnaire and if there is evidence the subject is undertreated with 
glucocorticoid the glucocorticoid dose will not be reduce and if there is evidence of 
over treatment the glucocorticoid dose will not be increased. 
 
The
 5 samples taken between 01:00 and 09:00 will reflect the glucocorticoid dose taken in the 
evening or last thing at night on standard and Chronocort® therapy and the 5 samples taken 
between 11:00 and 19:00 will reflect the morning glucocorticoid dose on standard and 
Chronocort® therapy. Dose adjustments will be considered if 3 or more of the 5 sample times 
show out of range values for 17-OHP or A4.  
 
F
or subjects continuing on standard therapy the local investigator can change the daytime and 
evening doses of the standard therapy (within the limits set by the independent blinded 
physician) but the timing and the drugs used must not be changed. Dose adjustment will use 
the lowest dose adjustment available with the specific therapy, so generally for hydrocortisone 
this will be 5mg, for prednisolone 1mg and dexamethasone 0.25mg. 
 
Where 17-OHP and A4 show inconsistent trends, the A4 parameter will take precedence in 
directing dose adjustment. 
 
The
 dose adjustment is to optimise control of CAH according to current standard of care based 
on subject symptoms and the measurement of androgens as is currently recommended for 
clinical practice. No other glucocorticoid dose adjustments will be allowed apart from sick day 
rules. Fludrocortisone dose adjustment will be allowed if medically indicated and will be based 
on BP 
measurements and laboratory data (goal supine PRA above the lower limit and <1.5 
ti
mes upper limit of normal [ULN]).  
 
At 24 weeks, all the baseline tests will be repeated, including the 24-hour profile. All subject s 
who 
complete the study may then continue to an open-label extension study where they will be 
offered Chronocort®, whatever their randomised treatment (to be conducted under a separate 
protocol).

Study Medication and Administration 
10.1 Randomisation and Blinding 
The
re will be a fully stratified randomisation of subjects using an IWRS system. Stratification 
will
 be based on subjects’ current treatment at the time of entering the study. This is an 
open-label study so there will be no blinding or unblinding procedures. Subjects will be 
a
llocated an identifying number sequentially per site in the following format: Study No./Site 
No./Screening No. (for example D005/1/001, D 005/ 1/002 etc. for site 1 ; D005/2/001 etc. for 
sit
e 2). When the subject is randomised, a separate randomisation number will be allocated, 
whic
h will be used internally for the purposes of treatment allocation and stratum identification . 
The screening number will still be used for subject identification purposes, so there will be 
gaps in subject ID numbers for screen failures. 
10.2 Description and Handling of IMPs 
The
 Investigational Medicinal Products (IMP) for this study are: 
  Chronocort® (Hydrocortisone Modified Release Capsule). In this study Chronocort® will 
be supplied in three unit dose strengths of 5mg, 10mg and 20mg per capsule.  
 the standard glucocorticoid replacement therapy that the subject is receiving will be used 
for subjects randomised to the comparator arm  
 
Diurna
l Ltd will supply the study sites with adequate bulk study medication of Chronocort® 
for the entire study period. Diurnal will also supply the standard glucocorticoid replacement 
therapy used at each site to ensure that subjects remain on the same products throughout the 
study.  
10.2.1 Chronocort® Formulation  
C
hronocort® is a modified-release formulation of hydrocortisone for oral administration. 
Chronocort® is available in dose strengths of 5, 10 and 20mg hydrocortisone. The 5mg 
formulation will be presented in white opaque body/blue opaque cap size 1 hard gelatin 
capsules, printed with ‘CHRONOCORT 5mg’ on the capsule body. The 10mg formulation will 
be presented in white opaque body/green opaque cap size 1 hard gelatin capsules, printed with 
‘CHRONOCORT 10mg’ on the capsule body. The 20mg formulation will be presented in 
white opaque body/orange opaque cap size 0 hard gelatin capsules, printed with 
‘CHRONOCORT 20mg’ on the capsule body. 
 
All excipients used in Chronocort® modified release capsules are standard materials normally 
used in pharmaceutical drug products, are the subject of United States Pharmacopeia/National 
Formulary (NF) and/or European Pharmacopeia Monographs, and have been used in 
pharmaceutical products worldwide over many years. 
10.2.2 Packaging and Labelling 
Chronocort® capsules are contained within either a PVC/PE/PVdC blister pack sealed with 
aluminium lidding foil or a high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle sealed with a 
polypropylene (PP) lid. Each blister pack contains 10 capsules of the same dose strength. Each 
bottle pack contains 100 capsules of the same dose strength. The sponsor will supply 
Chronocort® to the pharmacy at the study site as clinical packs containing 100 capsules of each 
dose strength, i.e. 10 x 10-count blisters (100-count pack) or 1 x 100-count bottle. A treatment 
pack for each subject randomised to Chronocort® will be assembled by the pharmacy using the 
re
quired number of clinical packs according to the individual subject prescription. Each dose

Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 stre
ngth will be identifiable by the unique colour hard gelatin capsule and product/dose 
identifier printed on the capsule. 
 
Chronocort® Treatment pack 1 will be dispensed by the study site pharmacy on Day 2 and 
take
n home by the subject. Treatment pack 1 consists of a cardboard carton containing one 
clinical pack of each dose strength (5, 10 and 20mg Chronocort®), with each pack containing 
100 Chronoc ort® capsules. The initial Chronocort® dose regimen will be determined according 
to the individual subject prescription, based on the hydrocortisone dose equivalent of the 
subject’s previous therapy, with the hydrocortisone dose calculated as prednisone dose 
multiplied by 5 and dexamethasone dose multiplied by 80 (up to a maximum starting dose of 
Chronocort® 30mg, split as 20mg at night and 10mg in the morning).   
 
Tr
eatment pack 2 (dispensed at Visit 2 after 4 weeks) and Treatment pack 3 (dispensed at Visit 
3 after 12 weeks) will be dispensed by the study site pharmacy. Treatment packs 2 and 3 will 
be
 assembled based on individual prescribed dosing regimen, including any dose adjustment 
required. 
 
Chronocort® will be labelled as shown in Appendix 9. The subject number will be written on 
the study pack by the pharmacist. 
 
Diurn
al will also provide appropriate labels for the standard glucocorticoid replacement 
ther
apy that the pharmacy can use to label the drugs dispensed to subjects (See Appendix 9). 
The
 subject number will be written on the study pack by the pharmacist. The batch numbers of 
the standard glucocorticoid replacement therapy must be recorded by the pharmacist. 
10.2.3 
Storage 
Chronocort® will be securely stored in the study site pharmacy at a temperature not exceeding 
25°C
. Subjects dispensed with treatment packs will be advised to store Chronocort® securely 
in a cool (room temperature) and dry place out of the reach of children. The comparator of 
standard glucocorticoid replacement treatment will be stored in line with the manufacturer’ s 
labelling. 
10.2.4 Accountability 
Subjects randomised to Chronocort® will return treatment pack 1 to the study team at Visit 2, 
t
reatment pack 2 to the study team at Visit 3 and treatment pack 3 to the study team at Visit 4. 
The
 study team will count the number of capsules remaining at each of these visits and enter 
the information in the eCRF, so compliance can be calculated against the treatment and titration 
prescriptions. At Visits 2 and 3 the study team will transfer empty treatment packs to the returns 
pharmacy at the site. At Visit 4 the study team will transfer all supplies returned by the subject 
to 
the returns pharmacy at the site. All used and unused Chronocort® will be stored at the 
returns pharmacy and made available for review by the Clinical Research Associate (CRA) as 
outlined 
in Section 14.8. Following the sponsor’s approval, all remaining Chronocort® will 
either be returned to the supplier or destroyed on site within 8 weeks of completion of the study 
unless 
otherwise instructed. If a subject is continuing on the follow-on study, they will be 
consented for this study and undergo the relevant procedures for the first visit and then a 
separate treatment pack that will provide sufficient capsules to last until the next visit will be 
dispensed. 
Dispensing of the comparator treatment will be in accordance with the site’s usual procedure, 
but used and unused medication must be returned to the study site at each visit and

rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 a
ccountability conducted along similar lines to that detailed above for Chronocort®. 
Accountability must also be performed at each visit for the safety pack, which  should be used 
in conjunction with the sites “sick day rules”. Any use of the medications in the safety pack 
should be recorded in the eCRF, along with the reason for use.  
10.3 Dosage and Administration  
S
ubjects will be randomised on Day 2 of the baseline visit, following the 24-hour endocrine 
profil
e and baseline blood tests. Further 24-hour endocrine profiles will be carried out at weeks 
4 
and 12, and any dose titrations required will be assessed centrally by an independent blinded 
physician.  
 
The morning dose of Chronocort® should be taken on an empty stomach at least 1 hour before 
a
 meal and the evening dose should be taken at least 2 hours after the last meal of the day. 
Subjects will be asked to self-administer the dose of Chronocort® provided at 23:00 hours 
(approximately 2/3rd of the total daily dose) and 07:00 hours (approximately 1/3rd of the total 
daily dose) with a small drink of water. 
 
The
 comparator of standard glucocorticoid replacement treatment will be dosed in line with the 
site’s usual practice. 
10.4 Dose Adjustments 
The
 intention of dose adjustment is to optimise control of CAH according to current standard 
of care based on subject symptoms and the measurement of androgen levels. Stress doses of 
hydrocortisone will be given for intercurrent illnesses as medically indicated according to “sick 
day rules” (Appendix 4 for an example). Other dose adjustments will not be allowed, unless 
the local investigator judges that there is a medical reason to alter the dose, and if so this will 
be recorded in the subject notes and the e CRF  (see also last bullet point below).  
 Dose  adjustment will be based on clinical symptoms using the “signs and symptoms of 
adrenal insufficiency questionnaire” (Appendix 5) and the measurement of the 17-OHP, 
a
nd A4 profile. The adrenal insufficiency questionnaire should only be used to 
determine if symptoms of under or over replacement of glucocorticoids have occurred 
since the last visit – it should not be used to record AEs due to other causes. 
 Dose  adjustments in both treatment groups will be made by an independent blinded 
physician, according to the instructions provided in Section 8 under the heading “Dose 
Adjustment” 
 Dose  adjustment will be made within 2 weeks of visits when biochemical results are 
re
viewed. Subjects will be contacted by telephone to tell them of the outcome of the 
dose
 adjustment process – either to tell them of the new dose, or of no change in dose . 
This 
will be followed in writing (whether there is a change in dose or not) repeating the 
instruction of the phone call. If it is practical to see the subject again in the clinic to tell 
them of
 the dose adjustment, this is also acceptable.  
 All subjects (whether or not there has been a titration) will receive a telephone call one 
week after any dose-adjustment, to enquire as to whether there have been any AEs, and 
reinforce any other protocol requirements. 
 The  rationale for a ny dose adjustment, by both the independent blinded physician and 
also any changes made by the local investigator, will be recorded in the subject’s notes 
and in the eCRF. 
 No dose adjustments outside of the protocol-defined dose adjustments should be 
conducted, unless clinical signs and symptoms indicate an immediate need. In such 
c
ases the Sponsor’s medical monitor must be contacted (preferably before any dose

hanges are implemented). Any such unscheduled dose adjustments should be based on 
clinical symptoms only, with repeated androgen testing discouraged and must be pre-
approved by the Sponsor’s medical monitor. 
 
Fludrocortisone dose adjustment will be allowed if medically indicated and will be based on 
BP measurements and laboratory data (goal supine PR A above the lower limit and <1.5 times 
U
LN). 
10.5 Other Study Medications (Non-Investigational Medicinal Products) 
S
tress doses to be used when the “sick day rules” are implemented will be supplied by the study 
site as part of a safety pack, which will typically include (according to local practice): 
 
 A one-week supply of 20 mg oral hydrocortisone (in 10mg tablets to allow dosage of 
up to 20mg three times daily)  
 2 vials of hydrocortisone for injection plus syringes and needles 
 The  site’s standard information guidance regarding “sick day rules” (routinely given to 
any subject receiving hydrocortisone replacement therapy)  
 
Diurn
al will also provide appropriate labels for the safety pack that the pharmacy can use to 
label the drugs dispensed to subjects (See Appendix 9). The subject number will be written on 
the safety pack by the pharmacist.  
 
Subjects will continue to take Chronocort® twice daily or standard glucocorticoid replacement 
therapy at the usual dosing regimen when taking stress doses. Any additional doses of 
hydrocortisone needed should only be taken from the safety pack and should not be taken from 
the study medication pack. 
10.6 Permitted Concomitant Medications/Treatments 
The
 subjects must be instructed that no additional medication will be allowed without the prio r 
consent of the investigator. Any medication considered necessary for the subject’s safety and 
well-being may be given at the discretion of the investigator(s). Medication for sick days does 
not require authorisation. All concomitant medications and treatments will be recorded in the 
subject’s e CRF . 
 
Existing or previous treatments for CAH (last 6 months) will be recorded separately in the 
eCRF from routine medication as part of the subject’s medical history. 
11
 Study Procedures 
 
The study procedures to be conducted for each subject enrolled in the study are summarised in 
Table 1. Subjects will be screened up to 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit. Written informed 
c
onsent must be taken prior to any study related procedures. Subjects will continue on their 
regular medication for CAH until they are randomised at Visit 1.2 (Day 2 of the baseline visit) .  
11.1 Visit Schedule  
At 
any visit, if multiple assessments are being conducted, then the measurements should be 
made in the following order: demographic data and medical history, AEs, signs and symptoms 
of adrenal insufficiency, waist circumference and weight, physical examination, vital signs, 
ECG, urinalysis, blood tests, and then dosing.

 Visit 0 (Screening Visit) 
At Dutch centres only, potential subjects will be approached by their own treating physician. 
If the treating physician is also the investigator the subject information sheet can be provided 
immediately. If this is not the case then the treating physician will ask the patient for permission 
for the investigator to approach them about study participation.  
 
Once subject s have consented to the study , the following assessments will be carried out on all 
patients and recorded:  
 All i nclusion and exclusion criteria checked 
 De mographic data 
 M edical history taken, together with information on concomitant medications   
 C AH medication will be recorded separately from other concomitant medications   
 AE s 
 S igns and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency 
 W aist circumference will be measured, together with height and weight, and the BMI 
calculated 
 A physical examination 
 Vital si gns (BP, heart rate [ HR], respiratory rate and body temperature) 
 Ur ine sample for urinalysis (including urine pregnancy test in females of childbearing

 Visit 1 (Baseline Visit) 
Day 1 
 
Subjects will attend the clinic on the morning of Day 1 and must be prepared for an overnight 
stay. The following assessments will be carried out and recorded: 
 C heck of inclusion/exclusion criteria  
 Subjects will asked about any AEs and concomitant medications changes since the last 
visit 
 Record the time and dose of the last glucocorticoid medication taken prior to attending 
for this visit   
 An abbreviated physical examination, if indicated by AEs 
 Vital signs 
 DEXA scan (except Germany ) – this needs to be performed at Baseline Visit or within 
2 we
eks prior to Baseline Visit, after inclusion/exclusion criteria are checked 
 
If the subject meets all the study criteria and they have been receiving their normal medication 
for the previous 5 days (i.e. sick days rules have not been applied in the preceding 5 days) they

 then be admitted to the clinic for their first 24-hour endocrine profile (17-OHP and A4). If 
sick 
day rules have been applied in the previous 5 days then the 24-hour profiling should be 
postponed until subjects have been receiving their normal medication for 5 days. The 24-hour 
endocrine profile sampling will commence at 15:00 hours on Day 1 followed by 2-hourly 
se
rum samples, hence 13 samples will be taken; 15:00, 17:00, 19:00, 21:00, 23:00, 01:00 (Day 
2), 03:00, 05:00, 07:00, 09:00, 11:00, 13:00, 15:00h. These blood samples are to be taken 
within ±10 minutes of the stated timepoints.  
 
Day 2
 
 
On the second morning of Visit 1, the following assessments will be conducted (the fasting 
samples to be taken at 07:00hrs): 
 AE s 
 S igns and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency 
 The  following questionnaires will be completed: MAF, SF-36® and EQ-5D™ 
 W aist circumference will be measured, together with weight, and the BMI calculated 
 Vital si gns 
 ECG    
 Ur inalysis (including urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing age) 
 B lood sample for fasting osteocalcin and CTX, insulin, glucose, HbA1c, lipids, hsCRP 
a
nd total testosterone 
 B lood samples will be taken for routine biochemistry and haematology 
 S ample taken for PRA after the subject has been supine for 30 minutes 
 
F
ollowing these procedures, the subject will be randomised to Chronocort® or to continue on 
standard care. Randomisation will be stratified by baseline treatment (see Section 8). Sufficient 
medication will be dispensed to the subject for the next 4 weeks. Initial dose setting at the start 
of Chronocort® treatment will be made on hydrocortisone dose equivalent of baseline therapy 
(see Section 8).  
 
Study drug will be dispensed and th e subject will be asked to attend the clinic for Visit 2 in 4 
weeks’ time. Subjects will be discharged following the end of the endocrine profile. Subjects  
will be asked to record the date, exact time and amount of the first dose of study medication on 
the drug packaging. The first dose of Chronocort® should be taken at approximately 23:00 
hours  on an empty stomach at least 2 hours after the last meal of the day. The first dose of 
standa
rd therapy should be taken in accordance with the instructions from the investigator.

Subjects will attend the clinic on the morning of Day 1 and must be prepared for an overnight 
stay. The following assessments will be carried out and recorded:  
 S ubjects will asked about any AEs and concomitant medications changes since the last 
visit  
 An abbreviated physical examination, if indicated by AEs 
 R ecord the time and dose of the last glucocorticoid medication taken prior to attending 
for this visit  
 Vital signs 
 
If the subject has been receiving their normal medication for the previous 5 days (i.e. sick days 
rules have not been applied in the preceding 5 days) they will be admitted to the clinic for their 
second 24-hour endocrine profile (17-OHP and A4). If sick day rules have been applied in the 
previous 5 days then the 24-hour profiling should be postponed until subjects have been 
receiving their normal medication for 5 days. The 24-hour endocrine profile sampling will 
commence at 15:00h on  Day 1 followed by 2-hourly serum samples, hence 13 samples will be 
taken; 15:00, 17:00, 19:00, 21:00, 23:00, 01:00 (Day 2), 03:00, 05:00, 07:00, 09:00, 11:00, 
13:00, 15:00h. These blood samples are to be taken within ±10 minutes of the stated timepoints. 
If dosing needs to be conducted at the same timepoints as the blood sampling, the blood 
sampling should be conducted first before the dose of study medication is given. 
 
Day 2 
 
On the second morning of Visit 1, the following assessments will be conducted (the blood 
samples to be taken at 07:00 hrs before the morning dose of study medication): 
 AE s 
 Signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency 
 W aist circumference will be measured, together with weight, and the BMI calculated.  
 Vital si gns 
 ECG    
 Ur inalysis (including urine pregnancy test for females of childbearing age) 
 B lood samples will be taken for routine haematology and biochemistry 
 B lood sample taken for fasting osteocalcin and CTX, insulin, glucose, HbA1c, lipids, 
hsCRP  and total testosterone 
 P RA  after the subject has been supine for 30 minutes 
 
The subject will return all of their medication (Chronocort® and the comparator), including any 
unused medication, and the number of tablets will be counted and recorded in the eCRF so 
compliance can be calculated. The safety pack should also be returned and checked, with any 
rescue medication use being recorded. 
 
Sufficient medication will be dispensed for the next 8 weeks, including an extra amount in case 
titration is required and the subject will be asked to attend the clinic for Visit 3 in 8 weeks’ 
time. 
Subjects will be discharged following the end of the endocrine profile. Subjects will be 
asked to record the date, exact time and amount of the first dose of study medication on the 
drug packaging. The dose of Chronocort® should be taken at approximately 23:00 hours on an

Following the assessment of the 4 week 24-hour hormone profile and subject’s symptoms and 
androgen levels, a decision will be made by the independent blinded physician as to whether 
to adjust the dose for the subject. The actual dose adjustment will be made by the investigator, 
within 2 weeks of Visit 2.  All subjects will be contacted by telephone, whether or not a dose 
adjustment is to be made. The subject will receive clear written instructions of the dose they 
will be taking until the next study visit (ev en if there is no adjustment to be made) following 
the telephone call. Subjects will be asked about any AEs at this call and any AEs reported will 
be recorded in the eCRF. 
11.1.5 Telephone call T2.2  
All subjects, whether or not they have received a dose adjustment, will receive a telephone call 
a week after the dose-adjustment call, to enquire as to whether there have been any AEs, and 
to reinforce any other protocol requirements. Any AEs will be recorded in the eCRF.

The
 subject will return their medication (treatment pack 3 for subjects randomised to 
C
hronocort®) and the number of capsules counted and recorded in the eCRF by the study team 
so compliance can be calculated (for both Chronocort® and the comparator). The safety pack 
should also be returned and checked, with any rescue medication use being recorded. An 
appointment will be made for the 30-day follow-up telephone call.  
 
I
f the subject has completed the 24-week study period, they will then be eligible to take part in 
the extension study.  
 
If the subject discontinues from the study early then as many of the above assessments as 
possible should be completed. Subjects who discontinue from the study early are not eligible 
to take part in the extension study. 
11.1.10Telephone call T4  
If the subject does not enter into the extension study then they will receive a telephone call 30 
days following completion of Visit 4 in which they will be asked about AEs. If the subject 
e
nters the extension study then any AEs occurring between the two studies will be collected as 
part of the entry procedures for the extension study.  
11.1.11Unscheduled Visits or telephone calls 
If
 an unscheduled visit is required, e.g. to follow up on an AE, then the details should be 
recorded in the eCRF, along with the results of any tests carried out. If laboratory results are 
needed urgently these can be processed at the local laboratory. Additional telephone calls may 
also be required inbetween visits to maintain contact with the subject and to ensure AEs and

 of any sick day rules are being noted. Any information collected in such calls must be 
recorded in the eCRF. 
11.2 S tudy Assessments 
 Vital si gns 
o BP, HR, respiratory rate and body temperature will be measured   a ccording to 
normal clinical practice at the investigational sites and the results recorded in 
the eCRF   
 
 B lood samples  
Will be taken by suitably qualified study personnel for: 
o routine  biochemistry and haematology tests  (see Appendix 2 ) 
o mea surement of PRA after the subject has been supine for 30 minutes (not 
required at the screening visit if this has been done and documented in the 
subject’s records during the previous 3 months; otherwise required at all visits) 
o g enotyping, unless genotyping has previously been performed, in which case 
the patient will be asked for their permission for this information to be taken 
from their medical records  
o 24-hour endocring profiles  
 
To minimise the risk of anaemia associated with the withdrawal of multiple blood samples for 
laboratory testing (as seen in DIUR-003), the planned total blood volume to be withdrawn 
during this study will be limited to a maximum of 427mL. The date and time of collection of 
a
ll blood and urine samples will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF. With regard to the profile 
sampling, a draw window of ±10 minutes from the prescribed timepoints for blood sampling 
is 
permitted, but exact times of sampling must be recorded in the source documents and e CRF . 
Copies of laboratory accreditation certificates and reference ranges will be provided prior to 
the analysis of the first subject sample. 
 
On 
Day 2 o f each overnight stay, blood samples will be taken at 07:00 hrs before the morning 
dose of study medication, then the study medication will be given at least 1 hour before 
breakfast. These samples are for fasting osteocalcin, CTX, insulin, glucose, lipids, HbA1c, 
hsCRP, and total testosterone. Subjects will fast from 23:00 to 0700 hour on Day 1 of each 
visi
t until th is sample is taken. 
 
All analyses, with the exception of the genotyping, will be carried out by the central laboratory , 
. Genotyping will be carried out by a specialist laboratory. By specific 
e
xception agreed with the Sponsor for logistical reasons, sites may use a local laboratory to 
determine inclusion and exclusion criteria. This must be agreed with the Sponsor prior to the 
start of the study. In addition, if laboratory results are needed urgently for safety reasons during 
the study, these can be processed at the local laboratory but the results must be recorded in the 
eCRF. 
 
 Ur inalysis 
Urine samples will be tested for the following; 
o P regnancy test in females of childbearing potential (this test will be done 
loca
lly at the site) 
o P rotein, glucose, specific gravity, ketones, urobilinogen, bilirubin, pH, blood

  DEXA  scans (except Germany) 
To be performed up to 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit (Visit 1) and again within 2 
we
eks of Visit 4. The DEXA scans will be performed according to the site’s standard 
clinical procedures.  
 
 Qu ality of life questionnaires (QoL)  
QO
L questionnaires (MAF, SF-36® and EQ-5D™) will be administered after breakfast 
on the day when the subject is not fasted and completed in a quiet environment. To be 
a
dministered at baseline and Visit 4. 
 
 Wais t circumference, height and weight 
Waist circumference, height and weight will be measured according to each site’s 
normal clinical practice and the result recorded in the e CRF . The subject’s BMI will be 
calculated and recorded in the e CRF .  
 
 E CG 
ECG will be performed and reported locally, and the result recorded in the e CRF .  
 
 P hysical examination  
A full physical examination to assess the subject’s general appearance and overall 
health will be carried out at screening and at the last visit in the study. Significant 
findings that are present prior to the start of study drug must be included in the relevant 
medical history/current medical status section of the eCRF and significant findings 
made after the start of study drug which meet the definition of an AE must be recorded 
in the eCRF. At the other visits, an abbreviated physical examination will be conducted 
if indicated by AEs, noting any changes from the screening assessment. Any abnormal 
findings will be recorded on the eCRF.  
11.3 Sick Day Rules  
All 
subjects will be educated regarding “sick day rules”. “Sick day rules,” a written guideline 
regarding what to do during any illness, will be given to the subject s (as is done for all CAH 
subjects). Wher e sites have a standa rd set of ‘sick day rules” these will be supplied to subject s 
a
t that site routinely along with an emergency pack of medication (see Appendix 4 for an 
e
xample of sick day rules that can be used for this study if a site choses to do so). Use of sick 
day rules will be recorded in e CRF , including both duration, dose of steroid and use of 
injection. Sick day rules from each site will be collected prior to the beginning of recruitment 
and placed on file by the Sponsor. 
11.4 Early Withdrawal from Treatment  
I
f a subject withdraws or is withdrawn prior to the last scheduled visit, all efforts should be 
made to perform the end of study assessments (as per Visit 4). Additional follow-up by 
telephone may be required to obtain information regarding follow-up of AEs (both non-serious 
and serious) ongoing at the time of study discontinuation.  
 
The
 date the subject withdraws/is withdrawn from the study and the reason(s) for 
discontinuation will be recorded on the subject’s eCRF.

 11.5 Criteria for Withdrawal of Study Treatment 
S
ubjects may withdraw from the study at any time without stating a reason and without 
prejudice to further treatment. The investigator may withdraw a subject from the study and 
discontinue study treatment and assessments at any t ime. Events that will result in 
discontinuation of treatment include:  
 
1. I nability to tolerate Chronocort® secondary to perceived or observed side effects 
2. P regnancy (not due to safety reasons but because pregnancy may interfere with the 
primary endpoint) 
3. Any  other changes to clinical signs or changes in laboratory values, physical status or 
AEs that could compromise the subject’s status if they were to continue with the study 
or if the investigator feels that it is not in the best interests of the subject 
 
T
he sponsor reserves the right to request the withdrawal of a subject due to protocol violation, 
a
dministrative or other reasons, or in the event of emergence of adverse risk data on the product. 
 
If a subject withdraws from the study prior to study completion, the reason for withdrawal 
should be sought and recorded on the e CRF . AEs should be followed up until resolution.  
 
If a subject withdraws from the study they will not be eligible to participate in the extension 
study. 
11.6 Replacement of Withdrawn S ubjec ts 
120 subjects will be randomised to account for withdrawals anticipated during the course of 
the stud
y and to provide 102 evaluable subjects. 
11.7 Additional Information for the Study Population 
F
emales presenting with oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea who are aged ≤55 years of age 
shoul
d be considered potentially fertile and therefore, as well as undergoing pregnancy testing 
like all other female subjects, will be expected to be using an acceptable method of 
contraception as noted below. 
 
Acceptable forms of contraception include: 
1. 
Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception (including 
oestrogen-containing products) – note that use of these methods of contraception must 
remain 
the same throughout the study in both nature and dose. The type of contraception 
should have been ongoing for ≥90 days prior to the study and at least 7 days after the final 
dose. If <90 days prior to the study, additional use of a double barrier method until 90 days 
is reached is required.  
2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).  
3. Barrier methods of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault 
c
aps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. The following should be noted:  
 Failure rates indicate that, when used alone, the diaphragm and condom ar e not 
highly effective forms of contraception. Therefore the use of additional 
spermicides does confer additional theoretical contraceptive protection.  
 How ever, spermicides alone are inefficient at preventing pregnancy when the 
whole ejaculate is spilled. Therefore, spermicides are not a barrier method of 
contraception and should not be used alone.

rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 
 4. 
Male sterilisation (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of the absence of 
sperm in the ejaculate). [For female subjects on the study, the vasectomised male partner 
should be the sole partner for that subject].  
5. True abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. 
Periodic abstinence, such as calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post ovulation methods, 
and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception 
11.8 Completion of the Study 
The
 study will be completed when all subject s have completed the last visit or telephone call 
of this study.  
11.9 Subject Payment Schedule 
R
easonable subject travel costs will be reimbursed. Where appropriate, costs for overnight 
accommodation prior to clinic admittance will be reimbursed, and in some cases a 
compensation or inconvenience payment may be made to subjects. 
11.10 Overdose 
I
n the event of an overdose, the subject should immediately contact the Investigator or Study 
Nurse for advice. There is no antidote available for Chronocort®. 
12 Adverse Events and Toxicity Management 
 
12.1 A dverse Event Definition 
An AE is defined as (21CFR312.32):  “Any untoward medical occurrence associated with the 
use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.”  An AE can therefore be any 
unfavourable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or 
disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or 
not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. This includes any newly occurring event 
or previous condition that has increased in severity or frequency since the administration of 
study drug.  
12.2 Adverse Event Collection  
AE
s will be collected for all subjects from the time of consent up to phone call T4 (30 days ± 
3 days) following the last visit or, if applicable, the Early Withdrawal visit. Any ongoing AEs 
post study will be followed to resolution or stabilisation if resolution is not expected. Only 
treatment emergent AEs will be included in the main safety analysis: other AEs will be listed. 
 
De
tails of any AEs, signs, and symptoms will be collected, including details of onset, 
resolution, frequency, severity, seriousness, relationship to the drug, effect on the study drug, 
treatments administered, and outcome. All AEs will be followed, whenever possible, until it 
returns to the baseline condition or becomes stable with no further change expected. In the 
event of any abnormalities considered to be clinically significant by the investigating physician, 
subjects will be followed up with appropriate medical management until values are considered 
to be clinically acceptable. Referral or collaborative care will be organised if required.

Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 
 12.3 Reporting of Adverse Events 
I
ndividual AEs should be evaluated by the investigator and recorded in the e CRF . AEs must 
be reported equally for both study treatments, regardless of whether the investigator thinks the 
AEs are related to the study treatment. 
12.3.1 Diagnoses vs. signs/symptoms 
Each AE should be recorded to represent a single diagnosis. Accompanying signs (including 
abnormal laboratory values if not constituting AEs themselves or ECG findings) or symptoms 
should NOT be recorded as additional AEs. If a diagnosis is unknown, sign(s) or symptom(s) 
should be recorded as the AE(s). 
12.3.2 Laboratory values  
Changes in laboratory values may be considered AEs if they are judged to be clinically 
significant (i.e., if some action or intervention is required or if the investigator judges the 
change to be beyond the range of normal physiological fluctuation). If abnormal laboratory 
values are the result of pathology for which there is an overall diagnosis (e.g., increased 
creatinine in renal failure), the diagnosis only should be reported as an AE. 
12.3.3 Pre-existing conditions 
Pre-existing conditions (present before the start of the AE collection period) are considered 
concurrent medical conditions and should NOT be recorded as AEs. However, if the subject 
experiences a worsening or complication of such a concurrent condition, the worsening or 
complication should be recorded as an AE. Investigators should ensure that the AE term 
recorded captures the change in the condition (e.g., “worsening of….”). 
12.3.4 Pre-planned surgeries or procedures 
Pre-planned procedures (surgeries or therapies) that were scheduled prior to the start of AE 
event collection are not considered AEs. However, if a pre-planned procedure is performed 
early (e.g., as an emergency) due to a worsening of the pre-existing condition, the worsening 
of the condition should be captured as an AE. 
12.3.5 Insufficient clinical response (lack of efficacy) 
Insufficient clinical response, efficacy, or pharmacological action, should NOT be recorded as 
an AE. The investigator must make the distinction between exacerbation of pre-existing illness 
and lack of therapeutic efficacy. 
12.3.6 Overdose 
Cases of drug overdose without manifested side effects are NOT considered AEs. 
12.4 Assessment of Adverse Event Severity 
The
 following guidelines for rating severity of AEs should be used: 
 
Mild: 
Awareness of signs or symptoms, but easily tolerated; are of minor irritant type; no loss of time 
from normal activities; symptoms would not require medication or a medical evaluation; signs 
and symptoms may be transient, disappearing during continued treatment with study 
medication.

Chronocort®        Diurnal Ltd 
 
Page 44 of 91 
Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 
 Moderate: 
Discomfort enough to cause interference with usual activities; the study medication may have 
been interrupted.  
 
Severe: 
Incapacitating with inability to do work or do usual activities; signs and symptoms may be of 
systemic nature or require medical evaluation; the study drug may have been stopped, and 
treatment for the event may be required.  
 
The term “severe” is often used to describe the intensity of a specific event, as in mild, 
moderate, or severe myocardial infarction; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor 
medical significance, such as severe headache. This is not the same as serious, which is based 
on subject/event outcome or action criteria usually associated with events that pose a threat to 
a subject’s life or functioning. 
12.5 Assessment of Adverse Event Causality/Relatedness 
All 
AEs will be assigned one of the following assessments of causality (note that both 
Chronocort® and the standard glucocorticoid replacement therapy used in the comparator arm 
are considered IMPs in this study): 
 
 Not r elated 
 R elated to the IMP  
 R elated to sick day medication 
 R elated to an interaction between IMP and sick day medication 
 R elated to either IMP or sick day medication 
 
All AEs judged by either the investigator or the sponsor as having a reasonable suspected causal 
relationship to an IMP, or are due to an interaction with an IMP, qualify as adverse drug 
re
actions (ADRs).  
 
Appendix 3 provides a comprehensive list of events that are anticipated to occur in the targeted 
stud
y entry population of subjects with congenital adrenal hyperplasia when disease treatment 
is 
not optimum. In general, if events as listed in Appendix 3 occur and are considered serious, 
they will not be reported to regulatory authorities in an expedited safety report since causality 
will likely be due to the underlying medical condition, rather than to study drug. During th e 
course of the trial, if aggregate analyses indicate that the events are occurring more frequently 
than anticipated, the sponsor will notify regulatory authorities expeditiously as appropriate. 
12.6 Assessment of Adverse Event Expectedness 
An AE 
is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the Investigator Brochure or is not listed 
at the specificity or severity that has been observed. "Unexpected," as used in this definition, 
also refers to AEs that are mentioned in the Investigator Brochure as occurring with a class of 
drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation. 
 
The concept of expectedness does not refer to what may occur in the course of the treated 
disease such as in the case of disease progression and/o r lack of drug effect.

Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 
 12.7 Serious Adverse Event Definitions 
An 
AE is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, it results in 
any of the following outcomes (21CFR312.32): 
 
 Death. 
 I s life-threatening. Life-threatening, in the definition of serious, refers to an event in 
which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an 
event which hypothetically might have caused death if it were more severe. 
 R equires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation. 
 R esults in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
 I s a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
 I mportant medical events that may not result in death, be life- threatening, or require 
hospitalisation may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardise the subject and may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
12.8 Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction 
The definition of Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reaction (SUSAR) includes a 
suspected causal relationship with administration of the test preparation (thus, a causality 
assessment of unrelated is not a SUSAR). 
12.9 Serious Adverse Event Reporting  
As with all AEs, the investigator is responsible for the collection of SAE data. All SAEs should 
be recorded in the eC RF. Any SAE that occurs between administration of the first dose of either 
of 
the study treatments and 30 days after the last dose of the study treatments must be reported 
promptly to the sponsor or designee not later than 24 hours after the study site becomes aware 
of 
its occurrence, using the SAE form provided. All SAEs should be monitored until they are 
resolved or stabilis ed.  
 
The initial report shall be promptly followed by detailed, written reports using the SAE report 
form provided. The initial and follow-up reports shall identify the trial subjects by unique code 
numbers assigned to the subject. The investigator shall supply the sponsor and the ethics 
c
ommittee/Institutional Review Board (IRB) with any additional requested information. 
 
The
 report must be made by telephone, facsimile, or email to the following contacts at the 
following numbers: 
 
SAEs must be notified immediately (and within 24 hours) by telephone or email to the 
sponsor’s responsible physician,  
 and to     
. This should be done even if the required 
information is incomplete or if the investigator is awaiting laboratory or diagnostic reports. 
This should be followed by a written report within 3 working days. 
 
The S AE form requires the following information (at a minimum): 
 
 S ubject ID (case number, gender, date of birth, initials [unless date of birth and initials 
are not allowed to be collected according to local law]) 
 Trial no.

Chronocort®        Diurnal Ltd 
 
Page 46 of 91 
Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 
  S tudy therapy (dose, route, form regime, start date, end date) 
 C oncomitant medication (including dose, route, form, regime, start date where 
available) 
 Nature of SAE (overall diagnosis where available or alternatively signs and symptoms) 
 S everity of SAE 
 Da te and time of occurrence 
 An y associated factors (concomitant disease or medication) 
 P roposed relationship to study therapy 
 Outc ome  
 I dentification of the reporter 
 Ac tion in relation to study (withdrawn, suspended, none). 
 
Investigators may be asked for additional information for any report of an SAE. An SAE form 
indicated as a follow-up report with attached documents (if necessary) should be forwarded to 
the sponsor/designee as soon as the additional information is available. 
 
The sponsor should submit to the regulatory authority(ies) all safety updates and periodic 
reports, as required by applicable regulatory requirement(s). 
 
Some of the AEs likely to occur in subjects with CAH, are of special interest, and whilst they 
may not be defined as SAEs, they will be reported in the same manner in order to capture the 
data in real time, together with additional data, if this should be required. However these events 
will not be reported to the regulatory authorities unless they are defined as SAEs. These events 
will include, but not be limited to, Addisonian crisis and events causing implementation of 
‘sick day rules’.  
 
Addisonian or adrenal crisis is defined as follows (based on Allolio 2015): 
 
 (A ): Major impairment of general health with at least two of the following 
signs/symptom s: 
Hypotension (systolic blood pressure <100 mmHg) 
Nausea or vomiting 
Severe fatigue 
Fever 
Somnolence 
Hyponatraemia (<132 mmol/L) or hyperkalaemia (as judged by characteristic 
ECG changes) 
Hypoglycaemia 
 (B ): Parenteral glucocorticoid (hydrocortisone) administration followed by clinical 
improvement: 
Grade 1: outpatient care only 
Grade 2: hospital care (general ward) 
Grade 3: admission to intensive care unit 
Grade 4: death from adrenal crisis (with or without parenteral glucocorticoid 
administration) 
 
In addition, some events may occur that represent an improvement in the subject's condition 
e.g. restoration of menses. These events are of special interest and should be recorded as AEs 
clearly stating that the event is an improvement in the condition, and these events will be coded

 a
s 'Unexpected Therapeutic Effect'. Whilst these events are not SAEs, they should be reported 
in 
the same manner as SAEs in order to capture the data in real time, together with additional 
data, if this should be required. However these events will not be reported to the regulatory 
authorities as SAEs.  
12.10 Serious Adverse Event Expedited Reporting 
The
 sponsor or designee will expedite the reporting to the appropriate regulatory authority(ies) 
of all ADRs that are both serious and unexpected. Such expedited reports should comply with 
the applicable regulatory requirement(s) (i.e., 21CFR312.32).  
12.10.1 Standards for Expedited Reporting 
For each SAE/SUSAR, the investigator and sponsor (or designee) will independently assess 
whether there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the study drug 
(“drug-related”) . If the SAE is assessed to be both drug-related and unexpected, the sponsor or 
designee will report it to the appropriate regulatory authorities and notify investigators as 
required by applicable local regulations. The sponsor or designee will report SAEs to the US 
FDA as required by 21 CFR 312.32, and EU Competent Authorities as per EU requirements.  
 
S
USARs are required to be reported within 7 calendar days for life threatening events and those 
resulting in death, or 15 calendar days for all others. These timeframes begin with the first 
notification of the SUSAR to the sponsor/designee.  
 
All events qualifying as SAEs and SUSARs will be reported by the Pharmacovigilance 
Contract Research Organisation ( CRO ), as necessary, to Regulatory Authorities and ethics 
committees/IRB (the latter may be through the local investigator, as required by local 
regulations). 
12.10.2 Expedited Reporting Guideline for Other Observations 
Other safety issues that might be considered for expedited reporting when they could materially 
alter the current benefit-risk assessment of the IMP (sufficient to consider changes in the 
administration or in the overall conduct of the trial) include, for example: 
 
 A n increase in the rate of occurrence of an expected serious adverse reaction, which is 
judged to be clinically important 
 Post-study SUSARs that occur after the subject has completed a clinical trial and are 
reported by the investigator to the sponsor 
 New event relating to the conduct of the trial or the development of the I MP likely to 
affect the safety of the subjects, such as a SAE which could be associated with the trial 
proc
edures and which could modify the conduct of the trial 
12.11 Sponsor’s Responsibilities  
The
 sponsor is responsible for the ongoing safety evaluation of the IMP. The CRO is 
responsible for ensuring that expedited reports are made to the regulatory authority(ies) and all 
applicable investigators of all ADRs that are both serious and unexpected, of findings that could 
adversely affect the health of subjects, impact on the conduct of the trial or alter the competent 
authority’s authorisation to continue the trial.

rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 
 S
uch expedited reports should comply with the applicable regulatory requirements (e.g., 
21CFR312.32). The sponsor should submit to the regulatory authority all safety updates and 
periodic reports, as required by applicable regulatory requirements.  
 
The CRO is responsible for arranging structures and writt en standard operating procedures to 
ensure that the necessary quality standards are observed in every step of the case 
documentation, data collection, validation, evaluation, archiving and reporting.  The CRO will 
assign a case number to be used in all futu re correspondence regarding the event and will 
forward the case to Diurnal Ltd within one working day.  
 
All events qualifying as SUSARs will be reported by the Pharmacovigilance CRO, as 
necessary, to Regulatory Authorities and ethics committees/IRB (the latter may be through the 
local investigator, as required by local regulations). 
12.12 Procedures for Reporting Pregnancy Exposure and Birth Events 
S
hould a female subject become pregnant or be suspected of being pregnant while participating 
in this study they must be withdrawn from the study immediately (not due to safety reasons but 
because pregnancy may interfere with the primary endpoint). The event must be reported to 
the sponsor immediately upon receipt of information by the study staff. While the pregnancy 
itself is not considered to be an AE or SAE, any pregnancy complications should be recorded 
as AEs or SAEs (if applicable). Any pregnancy will be followed through delivery for the 
observation of any SAEs . Fatalities and spontaneous abortions must be reported as SAEs. 
12.13 Data Safety Management Board 
A
n independent Data Safety Management Board (DSMB) will meet on a regular basis during 
the study in order to review safety data. The DSMB will meet several times during the study, 
and operate in accordance with a charter, which is a separate document. 
13 Statistical Considerations 
 
A detailed and comprehensive SAP will be prepared and signed-off before the first subject has 
been randomis ed. Minor changes to the statistical methods set out in this protocol need not be 
recorded as a protocol amendment but must be documented in the SAP and in the study report. 
 
The statistical analysis will be undertaken by . The statistical analysis and report will 
conform to the relevant ICH requirements, including but not limited to those set out in ICH 
documents E3 and E9. SAS version 9.2 or later will be used for the analysis.  
13.1 C onventions and Methods 
13.1.1 Summary Tables, Listings  and Figures 
The standard summary statistics for continuous baseline and outcome variables are: N, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, quartiles, minimum and maximum. The standard summary 
statistics for categorical baseline and outcome variables are: count and proportion (expressed 
as percentage). Geometric mean and coefficient of variation will also be presented for variables 
which will subsequently be log-transformed during the analysis. 
 
All efficacy variables, vital signs and laboratory assessments, together with their changes from 
baseline, will be summarised by treatment group (Chronocort®, standard therapy), stratum

 (pr
evious stable therapy: hydrocortisone only,  prednisone or prednisolone with hydrocortisone 
[but not dexamethasone],  dexamethasone alone or in combination with either prednisolone, 
prednisone or hydrocortisone)  and timepoint.  
 
B
aseline and demographic data will be summarised by treatment group and stratum. Shift 
tables from baseline will be provided for vital signs and laboratory assessments. 
 
Data on dose changes indicated by the independent blinded physician, non-implemente d 
changes and reasons for non-implementation will be presented descriptively by treatment 
group. 
 
Where appropriate, graphical displays of variables assessed serially over time may be 
presented. 
 
The summary tables and figures will be supported by full subject listings. 
13.1.2 Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals 
All significance probabilities will be reported as two tailed. Confidence intervals will be 
reported as 95% two-sided. 
13.1.3 Comparison of Groups 
In general, continuous variables will be compared across treatment groups using a Normal 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) linear model including pre-baseline standard therapy and, 
if 
appropriate, the baseline assessment of the variable as covariates in the model. In the case of 
c
hange-from-baseline variables, baseline will always be included as a covariate. 
Binary variables, such as response, will be compared using logistic regression with adjustment 
for covariates as in the continuous data case. 
13.1.4 Missing Outcome Data 
Missing 17-OHP and A4 values (including those considered missing due to being taken outside 
the permitted time window) within the 24-hour hormone profile will be imputed by linear 
interpolation of the two closest non-missing measurements to the scheduled missing time point 
(including out- of-window measurements). In the event that several values are missing from a 
single profile, a decision will be made about the validity of the whole profile will be made at 
the Data Review Meeting on a case- by-case basis (see Section 13.10) 
 
Subjects who withdraw from the study will be assessed on the basis of the latest available 
24-hour profile. This is a conservative procedure as subjects enter the study already receiving 
a
 suitable dose of their standard therapy.  
 
Exploratory and sensitivity analyses will be performed to assess the effect of any missing data 
on the efficacy conclusions.  
13.2 A nalysis Sets 
The safety analysis set comprises all subjects who were randomised into the study and who 
subsequently received at least one dose of Chronocort® or standard therapy.

Chronocort®        Diurnal Ltd 
 
Page 50 of 91 
Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 
 The full analysis set comprises all subjects who were randomised into the study, who received 
at least one dose of Chronocort® or standard therapy, and who have at least one post-
randomisation 17-OHP 24-hour hormone profile. 
 
The efficacy evaluable analysis set comprises all subjects who were randomised into the study, 
who received at least one dose of Chronocort® or standard therapy, and who have a week 24 
17-OHP 24-hour hormone profile, and who have no major protocol violations. 
 
The efficacy evaluable analysis set is the primary analysis set for the evaluation of efficacy. 
The final determination of the membership of analysis sets will be made at a data review 
meeting convened by the sponsor before database lock. 
13.3 E fficacy and Safety Variables 
13.3.1 Definitions 
Standard Deviation Score   
The SDS is the absolute (unsigned) number of standard deviations above or below the average 
of the lower and upper limit of normal, with the value of the limits and standard deviation – 
whic
h may depend on age and gender – being obtained from the laboratory and reference range. 
 
M
ean over a 24-hour SDS profile  
The
 mean over a 24-hour profile is the arithmetic mean over all the 24-hour SDS with the first 
a
nd last observations weighted one half relative to intermediate observations (this definition is 
equivalent to a normalised AUC calculated by the trapezoidal rule). 
13.3.2 Primary Efficacy Variable 
The primary efficacy variable is the natural logarithm of the mean over the 24-hour hormonal 
profile of the SDS for the natural logarithm of 17- OHP .  
13.3.3
 Secondary Efficacy Variables 
The secondary efficacy variables are: 
 
1. The  change from baseline to 24 weeks of the mean of the 24-hour SDS profile for A4 
(calculated in the same way as the primary endpoint). 
2. The  presentation of 17-OHP and A4 by individual baseline treatment strata in the study 
will be presented in the same manner as the primary endpoint (using 24-hour SDS 
profile at 24 weeks). 
3. 17-OHP and A4 levels at 09:00 as a responder analysis (i.e. the number of subjects 
a
chieving results in the optimal range). 
4. C hanges relative to standard treatment in body composition (DEXA) (fat mass, lean 
mass and total bone density) to be measured at all sites except Germany. 
13.3.4 Exploratory Efficacy Variables 
The exploratory efficacy variables are: 
1. The natural logarithm of the means over the partial profiles of 17-OHP at 15:00-23:00, 
23:00-07:00, and 07:00-15:00 (all refer to actual clock time of sampling). 
2. The primary endpoint measure will also be presented for the profiles measured at 4 and 
12 weeks for the purposes of titration. 
3. Changes relative to standard treatment in the following: 
a. Bone markers – serum CTX and osteocalcin

rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 
 b. hsC RP 
c. Assessment of glucose and insulin morning and evening (after fasting), HbA1c, 
total testosterone, and PRA  
d. Qo L using SF-36®, MAF, and EQ-5D™ 
5. Use  of glucocorticoids at beginning and end of the study will be presented both as 
individual glucocorticoids used, and as calculated hydrocortisone equivalents using 
accepted conversion constants for the calculations. 
13.3.5 Safety Variables 
The safety variables are: 
1. we ight, BMI and waist circumference 
2. routine  haematology and clinical chemistry 
3. ph ysical examination 
4. vit al signs 
5. urina lysis 
6. ECG  
7. the incidence, nature, severity, relatedness, duration, outcome and seriousness of 
treatment emergent AEs 
8. the incidence, nature, severity, relatedness, duration, outcome and seriousness of 'sick 
days' and Addisionian crises. 
13.4 Analysis of the Conduct of the Study 
Data concerning the conduct of the study (e.g. allocation to analysis sets, inclusion/exclusion 
criteria, subject disposition/withdrawals, compliance, protocol deviations, study 
termination/duration) will be listed and summarised descriptively. Details will be described in 
the S AP. 
 
Protocol Violations/Deviations 
 
As will be described in the S AP, following trial completion, but prior to database lock, any/all 
protoc
ol deviations will be reviewed and classified as either ‘minor’ (unlikely to appreciably 
affect trial outcomes) or ‘major’ (likely to affect outcomes) and this classification will be 
utilised to define the various study populations for analysis purposes. 
13.5 Demographic and other baseline characteristics 
De
mographic and other baseline characteristics for all randomised subjects will be listed and 
summaris ed.  
13.6 Efficacy Analyses 
13.6.1 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis is the comparison of the mean change from baseline to 24 weeks 
in the primary efficacy variable (natural logarithm of the mean over the 24-hour SDS profile 
for the natural logarithm of 17-OHP) between the Chronoco rt® treatment group and the 
standard therapy treatment group within the efficacy evaluable analysis set. 
This is the primary efficacy analysis for this study . All other analyses of this outcome variable 
and all analyses of other efficacy variables are secondary or exploratory analyses.

Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 
 13.6.2 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
The secondary efficacy analyses are: 
 
1. The  primary analysis repeated for A4. 
2. The  above analyses repeated within each pre-baseline treatment stratum. 
3. The  comparison of the frequency of the 17-OHP and A4 09:00 responders at 24-weeks 
(i.e. the number of subjects achieving results in the optimal range). 
4. C hanges relative to standard treatment in body composition (DEXA) (fat mass, lean 
mass and total bone density) to be measured at all sites except Germany. 
5. The  above analyses repeated in the full analysis set.  
13.6.3 Exploratory Efficacy Analyses 
1. P artial AUCs of 17-OHP at 15:00-23:00, 23:00-07:00, and 07:00-15:00 (all refer to 
actual clock time of sampling). 
2. The primary endpoint measure will also be presented for the profiles measured at 4 
weeks and 12 weeks for the purposes of titration. 
3. C hanges relative to standard treatment in the following: 
a. Bone markers – serum CTX and osteocalcin 
b. hsC RP 
c. Assessment of glucose and insulin morning and evening (after fasting), HbA1c, 
total testosterone, and PRA  
d. Qo L using SF-36®, MAF, and EQ-5D™. 
4. The  comparison of the dose of individual glucocorticoids used, and as calculated 
hydrocortisone equivalents, and its change from baseline at 24-weeks. 
13.7 Safety Analysis 
Safety variables, will be listed and summarised by treatment, stratum and timepoint. 
The nature, severity, relatedness, duration, outcome and seriousness and outcome of all AEs 
will be listed. The subject incidence of treatment emergent AEs will be tabulated by system 
organ class, preferred term, severity and relatedness. Tables will be provided of AEs of special 
interest, SAEs, SUSARs, AEs leading to withdrawal and fatal AEs. 
S
hift tables will be presented for laboratory variables and vital signs. Abnormal findings on 
physical examination and from ECG will be tabulated. Listings of laboratory data, vital signs, 
physical examination and ECG will have abnormal findings marked, together with an 
indication of whether or not that finding was clinically significant. 
 
The versions of the following international dictionaries current at the time of study conduct 
will be used for medical coding: 
 Dia gnoses: MedDRA 
 Medications: WHO Drug Dictionary including ATC classification 
 Adverse events: MedDRA 
13.8 Power and Sample Size Considerations 
A sample size of 102 subjects provides greater than 95% power and 2-sided alpha 5% to 
demonstrate a fall in the logarithm of the mean daily unsigned standard deviation score of 
17-OHP relative to the standard glucocorticoid replacement therapy group. It is assumed that 
(i) the mean fall in the Chronocort® group will be the same (0.78) as that observed in the phase

 II
 study (DIUR-003) (ii) the mean fall in the standard therapy group will be 0.2 (approximately 
25% of the Chronocort® phase II study fall) and (iii) the standard deviation of the fall (0.681) 
is that seen in the phase II study. The study is powered to ensure that there can be a reasonable 
description of the comparison of Chronocort® with a variety of standard therapies. 120 subjects 
will
 be randomised to this study which will account for an inevaluability rate of 15%. 
I
ndividual sites should not recruit more than 25 subjects without first consulting the sponsor. 
13.9 Exploratory Analyses 
Additi
onal exploratory and sensitivity analyses may include, but are not limited to: 
 a n assessment of the efficacy results in subgroups; 
 a n assessment of the effect of missing data on the efficacy conclusions; 
 a n assessment of the effect of baseline variables on efficacy 
 a  comparison between the treatment groups of the number of direction of dose 
changes made during the study period. 
Any exploratory analyses not specified in the SAP must be clearly described as such in the 
clinical study report. 
13.10 Data Review Meeting 
The
 sponsor will convene a Data Review Meeting after the data has been cleaned and the 
database locked but before analysis has commenced. The review will be performed within the 
framework of the requirements of the ICH Guideline E9. 
 
The
 terms of reference for the Data Review Meeting will include, but will not be limited to: 
 the determination of whether protocol violations are 'major' or 'minor', or not a 
protocol violation at all 
 the a llocation of subjects to analysis sets 
 a  review of missing data and of outliers 
 a  review of the distribution of the efficacy variables, considering any 
implications for the proposed method of statistical analysis 
 a  review of whether additional covariates need to be included in the analyses 
 re visions to SAP in light of any Data Review Meeting findings  
 
All persons taking part in the Data Review Meeting must only have access to datasets masked 
to treatment allocation.  Treatment group allocations will be scrambled using a dummy 
randomisation list and presented using generic treatment labels (for example, “Group A” and 
“Group B” 
13.11 Deviations from the Planned Statistical Analysis 
All 
deviations from the planned statistical analysis will be documented in the clinical study 
report.  
14 Responsibilities

8. Maintain adequate and accurate records (in accordance with 21 CFR 312.6 2 for  US sites) 
and to make those records available for inspection with the sponsor, their designated 
representative, the FDA or any agency authorised by law. 
9. Ensure that an ethics committee/IRB that complies with the requirements of ICH Good 
C
linical Practice (GCP) guidelines and local law (and 21 CFR 56 in the US) will be 
responsible for initial and continuing review and approval of the clinical study. 
10. Report promptly to the ethics committee/IRB and the sponsor all changes in the research 
a
ctivity and all unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others (to include 
amendments and IND safety reports). 
11. Not make any changes in the research study without approval, except when necessary to 
e
liminate hazards to the subjects. 
12. C omply with all other requirements regarding the obligations of the clinical investigators 
and all other pertinent requirements listed in in ICH GCP and 21 CFR 312 (US sites). 
14.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study 
The
 study will be conducted according to ICH GCP, the Declaration of Helsinki (1996), and 
ethics committees/IRBs in accordance with the US Code of Federal Regulations on Protection 
of Human Rights (21 CFR 50) (US site).  
14.3 Ethics Committee and Institutional Review Board approval 
The final study protocol and subje ct informed consent form will be approved by the ethics 
committee/IRB for the site participating in the study. Approval will be received in writing 
before initiation of the study at site.

approved by the ethics committee/IRB prior to implementation, except in the case of changes 
made to protect subject safety, which will be implemented immediately. 
14.4 Informed Consent 
The
 principles of informed consent in the Declaration of Helsinki (1996), in the current 
requirements of GCP published by the I CH and local regulation, whichever affords the greater 
subject protection will be implemented before any protocol-specified procedures or 
interventions are carried out.  
 
At Dutch centres only, potential subjects will be approached by their own treating physician. 
If the treating physician is also the investigator the subject information sheet can be provided 
immediately. If this is not the case then the treating physician will ask the patient for permission 
for the investigator to approach them about study participation.

Chronocort®        Diurnal Ltd 
 
Page 55 of 91 
Ve
rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 
 A 
signed and dated inform ed consent form (ICF) shall be obtained from each subject prior to 
entering the study. The investigator is responsible for obtaining written informed consent from 
the subject after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, anticipated benefits, and potential 
ha
zards of the study and before any protocol specific screening procedures or any study 
medications are administered. Information should be given in both oral and written form 
whenever possible and deemed appropriate by the ethics committee/IRB. Subjects will also be 
asked to consent to allow the sponsor, sponsor representative or external regulatory auditor to 
review their medical records to confirm compliance with GCP. All information sheets and 
consent forms will be provided in local language. 
 
The acquisition of informed consent(s) should be documented in the subject’s medical record 
and the ICF should be signed and personally dated by the subject or the subject’s legally 
acceptable representative and by the person who conducted the informed consent discussion 
(not necessarily by the investigator). The original signed ICF will be retained with the medical 
records at each site, a copy retained in the Investigator Site File and a further copy of the signed 
consent will be provided to the subject prior to participation in the trial. 
 
14.5 Subject Data Protection 
The
 ICF will explain that study data will be stored in a computer database, maintaining 
confidentiality in accordance with national data legislation. All data computer processed by 
Diurnal Ltd. will be identified by subject number/study code. The I CF will also explain that 
for data verification purposes, authorised representatives of Diurnal Ltd., a regulatory 
authority, and/or an ethics committee/IRB may require direct access to parts of the hospital or 
practice records relevant to the study, including subjects’ medical history. 
 
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic information being 
linked to the identity of the subject. This involves coding of the samples and data. For coded 
samples this will mean that there is segregation of the databases containing coded genotypic 
and clinical information with protection of confidentiality achieved by limited access. 
14.6 Case Report Forms and QoL questionnaires 
All 
data will be collected using an e CRF , which will automatically enter the data into a 
validated computerised clinical data management system.  
 
Each subject will complete the QoL Questionnaires during the clinic visits (visits 1 and 4). The 
answers to the que
stionnaires will then be transcribed into the eCRF by the study site staff. 
 
Laboratory data received electronically from the central laboratory will be merged with the 
database and not entered from the e CRF .  
 
Analysis of the data will only be performed after all queries have been resolved using 
appropriate software for analysis. 
14.7 Data Management 
D
ata management will be undertaken by who will: 
 Ge nerat e the database to include data collected in the eCRF, the Qo L questionnaires 
and the laboratory data in accordance with  standard operating procedures .  
 C omplete efficacy and end-point reporting.

rsion: Final 7.0 – 23 August 2017 
  Ge nerate safety data listings to include AEs coded using the latest version of the 
MedDRA coding dictionary. 
 
The exact time of the PK blood draws will be recorded. All deviations will be listed to enable 
 to make the necessary adjustments during the PK analysis. 
14.8 Drug Reconcilliation 
The
 CRA will perform drug reconciliation of supplies received on site, used, and destroyed or 
returned. The medication provided for this study is for use only as directed in the protocol. It 
is the investi
gator/institution’s responsibility to establish a system for handling study 
treatments, including IMPs, so as to ensure that: 
 
 De liveries of such products from Diurnal Ltd are correctly received by a responsible 
person 
 Such deliveries are recorded 
 S tudy treatments are handled and stored safely and properly as stated on the label 
 S tudy treatments are only dispensed to study subjects in accordance with the protocol 
 An y unused products are either returned for destruction or destroyed on site in liaison 
with the CRA and following approval from the sponsor of the destruction procedure 
 
At the e
nd of the study, it must be possible to reconcile delivery records with records of usage 
and destroyed/returned stock. Records of usage should include the identification of the person 
to 
whom the study treatment was dispensed and the quantity and date of dispensing . This record 
is in addition to any drug accountability information recorded on the e CRF . Any discrepancies 
must be accounted for on the appropriate forms. Certificates of delivery and return must be 
signed, preferably by the investigational pharmacist, and copies retained in the Investigator 
Site File. 
 
All unused medication should be either returned for destruction or destroyed on site following 
a
ppropriate drug accountability procedures.  
14.9 Inspections 
The
 sponsor or sponsor representative or external regulatory agency may at any time during or 
after completion of the study conduct a G CP audit. Notice will be given to the site in advance 
of a planned GCP audit. 
14.10 Protocol Compliance 
The
 investigator is responsible for ensuring the study is conducted in accordance with the 
procedures and evaluations described in the protocol. 
14.11 Sponsor Responsibilities 
14.11.1 
Indemnity and Compensation

Protocol Modifications 
Protocol modifications, except those intended to reduce immediate risk to subjects in the study, 
may be made only by Diurnal Ltd in conjunction with Principal Coordinating Investigator. All 
protocol modifications must be submitted to the ethics committee/IRB in accordance with local 
re
quirements.  
 
Approval by the sponsor, FDA, other regulatory authorities as necessary, and ethics 
committee/IRB must be obtained before changes can be implemented. 
14.12 Study Monitoring 
The
 CRO will be responsible for the monitoring of the study.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At all sites the study monitor will review the progress of the study on a regular basis, with 
reasonable advance notice and at reasonable times to ensure adequate and accurate data 
collections. Monitoring site visits to review eCRFs, subject case notes, administrative 
documentation including the Investigator Site File and frequent telephone communications 
with site will be performed throughout the study. At each study monitoring visit the investigator 
will make available all records pertaining to the study. To allow sufficient time to assemble 
documentation for the study monitor, monitoring visits will be confirmed in advance of planned 
visits. 
 
All communications, between the sponsor, designated study representative, and investigator 
should be documented for the study file.  
14.13 Publi cation Policy 
This section details the collaboration contractual terms relating to the data ownership and 
publication policy for Diurnal Ltd and the participating investigators stemming from the data 
generated from this study. 
 
The study results will be published irrespective of the study outcome. The sponsor and 
Principal Coordinating Investigator will jointly arrange for the preparation of one or more 
manuscripts. The sponsor’s and investigator’s comments on the proposed publication(s) shall 
be considered in good faith by the authors . Publication of the results will not include company 
confidential information without the permission of the sponsor. 
 
The sponsor may announce summary data in order to comply with Financial and other 
Regulatory Authorities, whilst ensuring that release of such data will not compromise the 
investigator’s liability to publish the data in appropriate scientific forms. Announcements made 
prior to the first scientific publication of the data will be reviewed by the Principal Coordinating 
Investigator. 
 
Data from individual study sites (unless the only site of a study, or a circumscribed sub-study) 
will not be published separately unless exceptional circumstances prevail.

GCP and ICH-E3 guidance.  
14.15 Data Retention and Availability 
The
 investigator is required to maintain all study documentation, including regulatory 
documents, copies of eCRFs, signed ICFs, and records for the receipt and disposition of study 
medications, for a period of two years following approval date of a New Drug Application for 
the drug, or until 15 years after completion of the study, whichever is later. 
 
During the study, the investigator must make study data accessible to the sponsor, ethics 
committee/I RB and regulators including the F DA. A file for each subject must be maintained 
that includes the signed ICF and copies of all source documentation related to that subject. The 
investigator must ensure the availability of source documents from which the information on 
the eCRF was derived. 
14.16 Study Termination 
The
 study may be terminated prior to completion of the specified number of subjects at the 
request of the sponsor, the investigator, the ethics committee/IRB or Regulatory Authority or 
by mutual agreement. Conditions that may warrant early termination include, but are not 
limited to, insufficient adherence to the protocol requirement, the discovery of a significant, 
unexpected and unacceptable risk to the subjects, attainment of study objectives, or at the 
discretion of the sponsor . Procedures for terminating the study will be agreed upon by both the 
sponsor and the investigator.

dix 3 - Expected Adverse Events 
 
The active ingredient of Chronocort® is hydrocortisone. The safety profile of hydrocortisone is 
well characterised in humans and there is extensive clinical experience with the use of 
hydrocortisone in subjects with CAH. The excipients used in the Chronocort® formulation are 
also well-characterised and approved for use in humans at the proposed levels. The risks of 
Chronocort® are, therefore, expected to be no greater than the risks of an equivalent dose of 
cortisol.  
 
For US NIH clinical centre on ly (new text in bold): The active ingredient of Chronocort® is 
hydrocortisone. The safety profile of hydrocortisone is well characterized in humans and there 
is extensive clinical experience with the use of hydrocortisone in subjects with CAH. The 
excipients used in the Chronocort® formulation are also well-characterized and approved for 
use in humans at the proposed levels. The risks of Chronocort® are, therefore, expected to be 
no greater than the risks of an equivalent dose of cortisol. However, until the safety, efficacy 
an
d tolerability of this formulation in the treatment of individuals with CAH has been 
proven, the risk is considered to be greater than minimal rsk with the prospect of direct 
b
enefit in indidivual subjects . 
 
The Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of hydrocortisone is used as the reference for 
expected AEs ( http://www.medicines.org.uk/emc/medicine/27652 ). However, some of the data 
in the hydrocortisone SmPC clearly relates to anti-inflammatory immunosuppressive doses of 
glucocorticoid, which will not be used in this study of Chronocort®. Should such 
immunosuppressive events be observed they would be unexpected so are not included. 
 
The following is reproduced from section 4.8 of the hydrocortisone SmPC:  
 
The
 incidence of predictable undesirable effects, including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal 
suppression correlates with the relative potency of the drug, dosage, timing of administration 
and the duration of treatment. The following side effects may be associated with the long-term 
systemic use of corticosteroids: 
 
Gastrointestinal:  
Dyspepsia, peptic ulceration with perforation and haemorrhage, abnormal distension, 
oesophageal ulceration, candidiasis, acute pancreatitis. 
 
Musculoskeletal:  
Proximal myopathy, osteoporosis, vertebral and long bone fractures, avascular osteonecrosis, 
tendon rupture. 
 
Fluid and electrolyte disturbance:  
Sodium and water retention, hypertension, potassium loss, hypokalaemic alkalosis. 
 
Dermatological:  
Impaired healing, skin atrophy, bruising, striae, acne, telangiectasia.

 Endoc
rine/metabolic:  
Suppression of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, growth suppression in infancy, 
childhood and adolescence, menstrual irregularity and amenorrhoea. Cushingoid facies , 
hirsutism, weight gain, impaired carbohydrate tolerance with increased requirement for 
antidiabetic therapy, negative protein and calcium balance, and increased appetite. 
 
Neuropsychiatric:  
Euphoria, psychological dependence, depression, insomnia and aggravation of schizophrenia. 
Increased intracranial pressure with papilloedema in children (pseudotumour cerebri), usually 
after treatment withdrawal. Aggravation of epilepsy. 
 
Ophthalmic:  
Increased intra-ocular pressure, glaucoma, papilloedema, posterior subcapsular cataracts, 
corneal or scleral thinning, exacerbation of ophthalmic viral or fungal diseases. 
 
Cardiovascular:  
Myocardial rupture following recent myocardial infarction. 
 
General:  
Hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis has been reported. Nausea, malaise, leucocytosis, 
thromboembolism. 
 
Withdrawal symptoms:  
Too rapid a reduction of corticosteroid dosage following prolonged treatment can lead to acute 
renal insufficiency, hypotension and death. A withdrawal syndrome may also occur including 
fever, myalgia, arthralgia, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, painful itchy skin modules and weight loss. 
 
A wide range of psychiatric reactions including affective disorders (such as irritable, euphoric, 
depressed and labile mood, and suicidal thoughts), psychotic reactions (including mania, 
delusions, hallucinations, and aggravation of schizophrenia), behavioural disturbances, 
irritability, anxiety, sleep disturbances, and cognitive dysfunction including confusion and 
amnesia have been reported. Reactions are common and may occur in both adults and children. 
In adults, the frequency of severe reactions has been estimated to be 5-6%. Psychological 
effects have been reported on withdrawal of corticosteroids; the frequency is unknown. 
 
 
In addition, 3 out of 16 subjects in a phase 2 study of Chronocort® had symptoms of carpal 
tunnel syndrome (median nerve compression), which may be related to fluid retention 
secondary to Chronocort® treatment.

dix 4 - Sick Day Rules 
 
Each site should follow their own sick day rules, or if these are not available then the following 
rules should be used: 
 
ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY 
Your body does not make adequate cortisol or aldosterone. Cortisol is a hormone which has 
many purposes in the body including maintaining blood pressure. Normally cortisol is secreted 
in the body in small amounts every day by the adrenal glands. In addition to the usual 
production of cortisol, the body normally has the ability to increase cortisol production in 
response to various stressors such as infection or trauma. Aldosterone is a hormone which is 
important in regulating salt and water balance. Sufficient aldosterone is necessary to prevent 
dehydration. These two hormones are being replaced in your body by medications.  
 
Extra hydrocortisone must be given during times of extreme physical stress  such as illness 
with fever and significant trauma.  
 
For illnesses which result in:  
 
Fever greater than or equal to 100°F (37.7°C)/ minor illnesses: take 10mg Hydrocortisone 
three times a day in addition to the usual daily dose of Chronocort®. 
 
Fever greater than or equal to 101°F (38.3°C)/ more severe illness: take 20mg Hydrocortisone 
three times a day in addition to the usual daily dose of Chronocort®.  
 
Vomiting: If you vomit, wait one half-hour and then take 20mg of hydrocortisone for sick day 
rules from your packet provided. If you vomit the Chronocort® dose do not take another dose 
of Chronocort® until the next dose is due. Call the study team to let us know you are sick. If 
you are vomiting and cannot keep the medication down (vomit less than 1 hour after the dose), 
you need to administer injectable hydrocortisone. Do not delay giving injectable 
hydrocortisone.  Drink SMALL  amounts of clear liquids frequently, as tolerated. Call your 
doctor or go to an emergency room if your symptoms worsen or you do not improve within 
one hour. 
 
Watch for signs of acute cortisol deficiency: headache, nausea, abdominal pain, dehydration, 
confusion, weakness, fatigue.  
 
An injectable form of hydrocortisone must be kept in an easily accessible location for 
emergencies (i.e. purse, briefcase, desk at work). It may be kept for several years in the 
unmixed form at room temperature. It should not be exposed to extreme hot or cold (i.e. do not 
store in the glove compartment of a car) . Check the expiration date routinely and obtain a 
prescription refill when needed. Also make sure you have the needle necessary to inject the 
medication.  
 
Your dose of hydrocortisone for injection is 100 mg - 2mL by intramuscular injection to 
the thigh.

 Othe
r points to remember:  
 
 When you are sick, drink sugar and salt containing liquids (e.g. non-diet soda, Gatorade , 
Lucozade, soup). 
 
 I f you need to have surgery, extensive dental work, or you have been in an accident, 
extra doses of hydrocortisone will be needed, usually by intramuscular injection or 
intravenous administration. Notify any physician or dentist that you have ADRENAL 
INSUFFICIENCY, so proper amounts of hydrocortisone can be given prior to a 
procedure.  
 
 I t is essential that you wear a medical identification bracelet or necklace to alert people 
in times of emergency that you have adrenal insufficiency and are taking medication. 
It is also a good idea to have a wallet card or something on your driver’s licenc e 
identifying you as having ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY.  
 
 Call your doctor for:  
Fever for more than three days 
Changes in behaviour, such as acting confused 
 
 I f you are living with someone, let them know to seek medical help on your behalf if 
you are unresponsive or difficult to arouse. 
 
Ensure that you have a list of important phone numbers:

dix 10 - Protocol Amendment History 
 
Protocol Version 1.0 dated 03 July 2015 
Original protocol. 
 
Protocol Version 2.0 dated 03 September 2015  
The protocol was amended to address MHRA comments on the protocol and to make a small 
administerative change to the Adrenal Insufficieny Checklist. The following changes were 
made:  
 
1) Modification of the RSI in the Investigator’s Brochure (IB) necessitated an update to 
Appendix 3 (Expected Adverse Events) in the protocol. 
2) C
larification was added that the DSMB is independent.  
3) The inclusion criteria of PRA less than 2 x ULN was reduced to PRA less than 1.5 x ULN. 
4) Appendix 5 was updated to a newer version of the Adrenal Insufficiency Checklist (minor 
administrative change). 
Protocol Version 3.0 dated 03 December 2015  
The protocol was amended to address the Swedish Medicines Agency and the US National 
Institutes of Health comments on the protocol that a separate benefit/risk assessment should be 
added. The following c hanges were  made:  
 
1) S
ection 5: new section added at the end of Section 5 titled Benefit/Risk Assessment. 
P
rotocol Version 4.0 dated 28 May 2016  
The following changes were made to the protocol: 
 
1) The Sponsor signatory was changed from .  
 
2) Different clinicians use different conversion factors for dexamethasone to hydrocortisone. 
The
 protocol states that ‘The initial dose setting at the start of Chronocort® treatment will 
be made on hydrocortisone dose equivalent of baseline therapy, with the hydrocortisone 
dose calculated as dexamethasone dose multiplied by 80’. Investigators and Diurnal have 
been concerned that this may lead to a safety issue that if patients on a higher dose of 
dexamethasone were converted by x80 they would be exposed to excess hydrocortisone, 
therefore a greater mineralocorticoid effect, and be at risk of being overdosed. Therefore 
the protocol was amended to state that the current conversion rate of x80 should be used 
as per protocol up to a maximum starting dose of Chronocort® 30mg (split 20mg at night 
and 10mg in the morning). The justification for the maximum of 30mg Chronocort® is 
based on the fact this was the starting dose for all patients in the Phase 2 study (DIUR-003) 
(Mallappa 2015) and is in line with recommendations for hydrocortisone dosing in CAH 
(Speiser 2010).  If the investigator has any concerns regarding the starting dose in a patient 
then these can be discussed with the Medical Monitor. 
 
3) The protocol stated that blood samples should be taken for genotyping, unless genotyping 
had previously been performed. It was clarified that if previous genotyping had been 
performed the patient has to be asked for their permission for this information to be taken 
fr
om their medical records.

 4)
 Subjects who routinely work night shifts and so do not sleep during the usual nighttime 
hours was added to the exclusion criteria.  
 
5) At the request of the Dutch ethics committee, the following sentence has been added to the 
procedures for the screening visit (Section 11.1.1) and also in Section 11.4 (Informed 
Consent): At Dutc h centres only, potential subjects will be approached by their own 
tre
ating physician. If the treating physician is also the investigator the subject information 
sheet can be provided immediately. If this is not the case then the treating physician will 
ask the patient for permission for the investigator to approach them about study 
participation.  
 
6)
 It was noted that the terminology for the independent blinded physician was not consistent 
throughout the protocol so this was corrected throughout.  
 
7)
 In the synopsis, Section 8 (Study Design) and Section 10.4 (Dose Adjustment) it was stated 
that ‘Dose adjustment will not take place without measurement of androgens at an inpatient 
visit,  unless the local investigator considers it is indicated by the severity of symptoms. ’ 
However, this statement was considered confusing and also seemed to mandate the 
measurement of androgens at an unscheduled dose adjustment, which was not the case. 
The text was therefore revised to say ‘No dose adjustments outside of the protocol-defined 
dose adjustments should be conducted, unless clinical signs and symptoms indicate an 
immediate need. In such cases the Sponsor’s medical monitor must be contacted 
(preferably before any dose changes are implemented). Any such unscheduled dose 
adjustments should be based on clinical symptoms only, with repeated androgen testing 
discouraged and must be pre-approved by the Sponsor’s medical monitor.’ 
 
Protocol Version 5.0 dated 23 September 2016 
 
The
 following changes were made to the protocol: 
 
1) The Sponsor signatory was changed from  
 
2) The Chronocort® capsules may now be supplied in either blister pack s or bottles. 
Therefore, Section 10.2.2 (Packaging and Labelling) and Appendix 9 (Labelling) were 
updated . 
 
Protocol Version 6.0 dated 13 April 2017 
 
The
 following changes were made to the protocol: 
 
1) The statistician was changed from . 
 
2) The sample size was increased from 110 to 120 p atients due to a higher level of protocol 
deviations than originally anticipated. As such, the inevaluability rate has been increased 
from 7% to 15%. 
 
3) The titration instructions in Section 8 (Dose Adjustment) has been modified to provide 
guidance if the independent blinded physician states that a change to the midday dose is 
needed but the patient is either receiving Chronocort or is receiving twice daily dosing of 
standard therapy. In such cases the local investigator is instructed to decide whether to

 a
djust the morning or evening dose, based on their judgement, in addition to any changes 
already advised for morning and evening doses, thus ensuring that the total change advised 
is ac
commodated within the day. 
 
4) The screening period has been extended by 1 week (21 days) to allow extra time for the 
stud
y site to obtain the results of the screening PRA test.  
 
5) Clarification added to Sections 9.2 and 11.7 and the synopsis that  female subjects 
presenting with oligomenorrhoea or amenorrhoea who are aged ≤55 years of age should 
be
 considered potentially fertile and therefore, as well as undergoing pregnancy testing 
like all other female subjects, will be expected to be using an acceptable method of 
contraception, as listed in S ection 11.7. 
 
6)
 Some events may occur during the study that represent an improvement in the subject's 
condition e.g. restoration of menses. To ensure sufficient details of such events are 
recorded, Section 12.9 has been updated to state that these events will be reported in the 
same manner as SAEs in order to capture the data in real time, together with additional 
data, if this should be required. However these events will not be reported to the regulatory 
authorities as SAEs.  
 
Protocol Version 7.0 dated 23 August 2017 (administrative local amendment for US only) 
 
F
ollowing comments from the IRB, an additional statement has been added in Appendix 3 
(E
xpected Adverse Events) amending the risk category from 'minimal risk with the prospect of 
direct benefit to individual subjects' to 'greater than minimal risk with the prospect of direct 
benefit to individual subjects'. This is administrative change at the NIH clinical centre in the 
US only and has arisen due to an error in the NIH IRB classification at the beginning of the 
study (i.e. there is no actual change to the benefit/risk assessment).

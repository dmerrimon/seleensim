1. Protocol  Title:  
 
Dosimeter  Location  and Measured  Effective  Radiation  Dose  in Pain Management  
Physicians   
 
2. Objectives  
 
The primary  objective  is to determine  if there  is a significant  difference  in radiation  readings  
between  dosimeters  worn  on the chest  versus  the hand  of interventional  pain management  
physicians  and elucidate  which  dosimeter  had higher  readings.   
 
The secondary  objectives  are to examine  trends  in radiation  exposure  in each group  (chest  
only or chest  plus hand)  over the course  of the study  to understand  if overall  radiation  
exposure  decreases  over time due to changes  in practice  habits  as a response  to exposure  
reports.  The last objective  will be to track  incidences  of physician  glove  breaches  in both 
groups  to assess  if wearing  hand  dosimeters  is associated  with an increased  risk of the event.   
 
3. Background  
 
Radiation  producing  imaging  use is ubiquitous  in medicine  with a wide  range  of imaging  
modalities.  Of these,  computed  tomography  (CT)  and fluoroscopy  are the most  commonly  
used and are associated  with some  of the highest  radiation  exposure  for patients  and 
operators.1-2 This is particularly  important  in fields  such as Interventional  Pain Management  
where  these  modalities  are essential  to daily  practice.  The utilization  of opioid -sparing  
minimally  invasive  techniques  for low back  pain and arthritis  using  CT and fluoroscopy  has 
expanded  over the years  which  has greatly  increased  radiation  exposure  among  pain 
specialists.   
 
Current  Occupational  Safety  & Health  Administration  (OSHA)  guidelines  for occupational  
dose limitations  indicate  that the total maximum  effective  dose to the head  and trunk  is 12.5 
mSv per calendar  quarter  and 187.5  mSv per quarter  for the hands  and feet.4 Complications  
of acute  and chronic  radiation  exposure  can include  tissue  reactions  such as skin burns  and 
cataracts  or stochastic  affects  like cancer  or hereditary  derangements.5  
 
Spatial  relationship  to the imaging  device,  imaging  type,  and technical  execution  of the 
procedure  all affect  the amount  of radiation  physicians  and patients  are exposed  to. In terms  
of equipment  location,  the highest  levels  of radiation  in C-arm fluoroscopy  is very close  to 
the physician’s  waist  and abdomen.6 Discrepancy  in exposure  among  imaging  type is noted  
by Hoang  et al who showed  that CT guided  techniques  have  approximately  half the 
effective  dose to physicians  compared  to conventional  fluoroscopy  techniques.12 However  
this is not without  a tradeoff,  as procedures  such as epidural  steroid  injections  under  CT 
guidance  are associated  with more  than eight  times  the radiation  dose to patients  as 
compared  to fluoroscopy  guided.13 Thankfully,  techniques  that incorporate  the benefits  of 
both such as ultralow -dose CT are being  popularized,  which  actually  has a lower  does than 
traditional  fluoroscopy  to the patient.22 
 
As one might  imagine,  this highly  variable  and multifaceted  nature  of radiation  exposure  
can potentially  lead to large  effective  doses  at one time.  Several  studies  from  other  
specialties  found  that the radiation  exposure  to vulnerable  body  parts  like the eyes,  thyroid,  
and hands  often  meet  acceptable  levels  but could  be easily  and significantly  affected  based  
on physician  practices;  particularly  by the improper  use of personal  protective  equipment,  
patient  positioning,  and work  ergonomics.16-19 Perhaps  unsurprisingly,  a review  by Martin  
shows  that, in radiologists  and cardiologists,  the hands  are the part of the body  most  affected  
by work  practice  and positioning  when  it comes  to radiation  exposure  and the author  highly  
recommends  the use of a hand  dosimeter.20 Stoeckelhuber  et al. noted  that interventionalists  
performing  procedures  under  CT that expose  their hand  to the primary  beam  can receive  an 
effective  radiation  dose of up to 0.6 mSv in procedures  lasting  only 20 seconds.8 At this 
rate, if a physician  were  to use fluoroscopy  in this manner  for a two-minute  procedure,  they 
would  only be able to safely  preform  a mere  52 procedures  per calendar  quarter  to maintain  
OSHA  safety  standards.   
 
The use of multiple  protective  measures  such as long needle  holders,  protective  gloves,  and 
lead drapes  is considered  the gold standard  in practice  and have  been  shown  to decrease  
dose rates  by up to 99.6%  overall.8,14 Similarly,  Hoffler  et al found  that, when  compared  to 
no protective  measures,  just the use of attenuating  gloves  and leaded  eye protection  can 
reduce  the radiation  exposure  to the hands  and eyes by 69.4%  and 65.6%  respectively.21 
However,  in a survey  of 708 interventional  pain physicians,  93% stated  they were  concerned  
with radiation  exposure  but only 63% had formal  safety  training  and there  was low overall  
understanding  of evidence -based  radiation  safety  practices.9 Therefore,  better  understanding  
of a physician’s  individual  practices  on effective  radiation  dose through  a quality  
improvement  study  will help to close  gaps in knowledge  and understanding  of exposure.   
 
A dosimeter  is a small  device  which  measures  the radiation  the physician  receives  from  
their practice.  There  are several  different  kinds  of dosimeters  including  the commonly  worn  
chest  monitor  and others  closer  to the hands  of the physician,  such as wrist  bands  or rings.  
Carinou  et al indicate  that these  devices  are overall  generally  accurate  at measuring  the 
correct  radiation  dose but have  their limitations  depending  on the manufacturer,  scope  of 
intended  use, and material  composition.15 There  are currently  no studies  comparing  
dosimeter  location  and radiation  exposure  readings  in pain management  physicians.  The 
effective  dose detected  by a single  chest  monitor  is likely  not an accurate  representation  of 
the does received  in other  parts  of the body  in pain management  physicians.  There  are also 
no published  studies  assessing  the risk of wearing  hand  dosimeters  in sterile  procedures,  
such as increased  frequency  of glove  breaches  or procedure -related  infections.  
 
Of the various  factors  that influence  radiation  exposure  risk, dosimeter  location  on a 
proceduralists  body  is of particular  interest  to interventional  pain physicians.  Yamashita  et 
al. found  a large  discrepancy  in dosimeter  readings  among  spine  surgeons  using  fluoroscopy  
between  the dosimeters  worn  on the chest  (125.6  mSv)  and those  worn  on the thumb  (368 
mSv).10 This discrepancy  indicates  that the hands  of proceduralist  may be exposed  to 
radiation  exceeding  the acceptable  safe limit  despite  a chest  worn  dosimeter  measuring  safe 
radiation  levels.  This has obvious  and dangerous  implications  for individuals  that only wear  
a chest  dosimeter.   
 
Our review  of literature  identifies  a knowledge  gap between  dosimeter  location  and 
radiation  risk among  interventional  pain physicians.  This evidence  supports  the need  of a 
quality  improvement  study  to further  assess  radiation  exposure  in pain management  
physicians.  In order  to ensure  physician  safety,  it is crucial  to have  adequate  radiation  
exposure  training  and protective  equipment  as well as accurate  measurements  of effective  
radiation  dose.  This is particularly  important  with parts  of the body  such as the hands  where  
effective  radiation  dose may be much  higher  than being  recorded  on chest  dosimeters.  This 
quality  improvement  study  will be essential  to providing  valuable  insight  into radiation  
exposure  and may help guide  safety  protocols  in the future  for OHSU  physicians.   
 
In sum,  the variability  in effective  radiation  dose based  on procedure  type,  imaging  
modality,  protective  equipment  and procedural  approach  requires  further  investigation  into 
dosimeter  location  to accurately  evaluate  provider  safety  during  radiation  generating  
procedures.  
 
4. Study  Design  
 
This is a prospective quality and safety improvement study designed to examine potential 
differences in radiation measurements depending on dosimeter location on an interventional 
pain medicine practitioner’s body. The comparison will be made between a gro up wearing 
chest worn dosimeters (control) and chest plus hand worn dosimeters (experimental) between 
October 1, 2022 and April 21, 2023.   
 
The study will be performed at the Comprehensive Pain Center at Oregon Health and Science 
University (OHSU) and involve attending physicians and fellow physicians who consent to 
participate. The physicians who consent will then be randomly assigned by a computer -
generated program to either the control group (chest dosimeter) or experimental group (chest 
plus hand dosimeter).  
 
The control  group  will be assigned  a chest  dosimeter  to wear  while  the experimental  group  
will be assigned  a hand  and chest  dosimeter.  The dosimeters  will be collected  according  to 
standard  processing  protocol  every  three  month(s)  by the designated  Comprehensive  Pain 
Center  dosimeter  collector.  The badges  will then be submitted  to the vendor,  Mirion,  who 
will process  the dosimeters  and return  an electronic  report  available  for viewing  online  and at 
the procedure  area nursing  station.  All study  participants  will also be emailed  a copy  of the 
report.   
 
The study  team  will assess  physician  compliance  with wearing  the dosimeter(s)  by having  
the procedure  nurses  perform  a daily  written  audit  of chest  and hand  dosimeter  presence  or 
absence.   
 
Radiation  measurements  and compliance  logs will be recorded  inOHSU  Microsoft  Teams  
Excel . We are done  collecting  data.  We are using  Microsoft  Excel  in Teams  to input  and 
analyze  the data.  Data  analysis  will be performed  by an OHSU  statistician.  
 
Consistent  with the OHSU  standards  for wearing  hand  dosimeters  for sterile  procedures,  for 
each procedure  the physician  wearing  the hand  dosimeter  will be required  to:  
 
1) Wash  the hand  dosimeter  with one pump  (2 mL) of Avaguard  
2) Place  the hand  dosimeter  on a bare hand  
3) Dispense  one pump  (2 ml) into the palm  of one hand.  Dip fingertips  of the opposite  
hand  into the hand  prep and work  under  fingernails.  Spread  remaining  hand  prep 
over the hand  and up to just above  the elbow.   
4) Dispense  one pump  (2 ml) and repeat  procedure  with opposite  hand.  
5) Dispense  final pump  (2 ml) of hand  prep into either  hand  and reapply  to all aspects  
of both hands  up to the wrists.  Allow  to dry. Do not use towels  to dry. 
6) Double  glove  both hands  using  sterile  gloves.   
 
At the conclusion  of each procedure,  the physicians  in both groups  will be required  to inspect  
their surgical  gloves  for any visible  breaches.  All breaches  of one or both gloves  on each 
hand  that are recognized  during  or after the procedure  must  be reported  to the study  team.  
The physician  will also indicate  on which  hand  the hand  dosimeter,  if applicable,  was worn.

between  dosimeter  type and effective  radiation  dose.  
 
The statistician  will perform  an analysis  using  descriptive  statistics,  tables,  and data 
visualization  techniques.  The statistics  will include  median  (min,  max)  and mean  (SD)  with 
95% confidence  intervals  for continuous  variables  and frequencies  and proportions  for binary  
and categorical  variables.  The statistician  will use multiple  imputation  to address  missing  
data if the missing  rate is more  than 10%.   Multiple  imputation  by chained  equations  (MICE)  
is implemented  assuming  missing  at random.

15. Risks  and Benefits   
a. Risk    
There  is a risk of breach  of confidentiality.  There  is no increased  risk of radiation  
exposure  to participants  as they will not be asked  to modify  their routine  medical  
practice  in any way.  There  is a risk of hand  dosimeters  being  associated  with a glove  
breach . To address  this risk, all physicians  wearing  hand  dosimeters  will be required  
to double  glove  per OHSU  standards.  There  is no evidence  of dosimeters  causing  
increased  risk to patients  and standard  procedure  consent  will be obtained  per routine  
medical  practice  as is consistent  with OHSU  departments  using  hand  dosimeters.   
 
b. Potential  Benefits  to Participants  
Identifying  a discrepancy  in radiation  exposure  between  chest  dosimeters  and hand  
dosimeters  that could  lead to changes  in provider  radiation  safety.

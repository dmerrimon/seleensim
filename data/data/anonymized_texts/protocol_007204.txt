PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
 
A Phase 1b/2a, Multi -Center Open -Label Study to Evaluate the Safety and 
Efficacy of Combination Treatment with MEDI0457 (INO -3112) and 
Durvalumab (MEDI4736) in Patients with Recurrent / Metastatic Human 
Papilloma Virus Associated Head and Neck Squamous Cancer  
 
Study site(s) and number of patients planned 
This will be a multi- center study with the participation of sites in the United States of 
America.  Approximately eight  centers  will participate in the study.  Approximately 
50 patients will be enrolled to obtain 40 evaluable patients.

Estimated date of last patient completed  Q1 2021  1 
Study design  
This is a Phase 1b/2a, open- label, multi- center study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, 
anti-tumor  activity, and immunogenicity of MEDI0457 (also known as INO -3112)  in 
combination with durvalumab (also known as MEDI4736) .  Approximately 50 patients with 
human papilloma virus associated recurrent / metastatic head and neck squamous cell cancer 
will be enrolled in this study.  Approximately three to 12 patients (Safety Analysis Run- in 
patients) will be enrolled and assessed for safety before additional patients are enrolled at a 
recommended dose and schedule for the combination.  Because this study is the first time 
MEDI0457 has been combined with durvalumab, the study will start with enrollment of a 
minimum of three patients who will receive four doses of MEDI0457 ( Limited Schedule ) in 
combination with durvalumab.  Only if the safety analysis of the initial patients who complete 
the 7 -week dose -limiting toxicity evaluation period, is deemed acceptable (i.e., none of the 
initial patients experience a dose -limiting toxicity), the vaccination schedule will switch from 
the limited four doses ( Limited Schedule ) to the Indefinite Schedule (also known as the 
Planned Dosing Schedule, i.e. vaccinations will continue until disease progression).  This  
Indefinite Schedule will be implemented for all subsequent patients following the S afety 
Analysis Run- in. Otherwise, if a third of the initial patients experience a dose -limiting 
toxicity, a minimum of three additional patients (i.e., a minimum total of six patients for the 
Safety Analysis Run- in) will be enrolled and the initial minimum six patients in the Safety 
Analysis Run- in cohort will be limited to a total of four doses of MEDI0457 ( Limited 
Schedule ) before considering a switch to the Indefinite Schedule , provided the safety data 
was supportive and if only no more than a third of t hese patients experience a dose -limiting 
toxicity during their 7- week dose -limiting toxicity evaluation period.  If at any time during the

7 (159) enrollment of these patients, more than a third of the patients experience dose -limiting 
toxicity, then this regimen has exceeded the maximum tolerated dose and the regimen will be 
modified.  The choice of modifications in the Revised Dosing Schedule  during the Safety 
Analysis Run- in include the following: (1)  decrease the dose of durvalumab to 750 mg every 
four weeks or  decrease the total number of durvalumab doses, (2) increase the interval 
between MEDI0457 doses from every 8 weeks to intervals such as 12 or 16 weeks following 
the Week 12 dose or decrease the total number of MEDI0547 doses administered from a total 
of three to either one or two during the dose -limiting toxicity period.  At least a minimum of 
three patients with no dose -limiting toxicity and up to approximately six patients with no more 
than a third with a dose -limiting toxicity must be evaluated using ei ther the Planned Dosing 
Schedule or Revised Dosing Schedule before study enrollment will continue with a recommended dose and schedule for the combination.  In the Planned Dosing Schedule  both 
MEDI0457 and durvalumab treatment will continue until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.  Either treatment may be stopped by the Investigator while the other treatment continues.  See flowchart and Design for Safety Analysis Run- in table below.

Rules  
• A minimum of three patients will be enrolled and if none of the initial patients 
experience a dose- limiting toxicity, then the vaccination schedule will switch 
from the limited four doses ( Limited Schedule ) to the Indefinite Schedule  
(also known as the Planned Dosing Schedule , i.e. vaccinations will continue 
until disease progression).  The Indefinite Schedule  will be implemented for 
all subsequent patients following the Safety Analysis Run- in. 
• If a third of the initial patients experience a dose- limiting toxicity, then a 
minimum of three additional patients (i.e., a minimum total of six patients) 
will be enrolled into the Safety A nalysis Run- in.  These patients will be given 
the Limited Schedule (four doses) of MEDI0457 before considering a switch to the Indefinite Schedule  provided the safety data was supportive and if no 
more than a  third of these patients experience a dose -limiting toxicity during 
their 7 -week dose -limiting toxicity evaluation period.  
• If at any time during the enrollment of these patients, more than a third of 
the  patients experience a dose- limiting toxicity, then this regimen has 
exceeded the maximum tolerated dose and the regimen will be modified:  
Revised Dosing Schedule  (per Safety Data Monitoring Committee).  
• At least a minimum of three patients with no dose -limiting toxicity and up to 
approximately six patients with no more than a third with a dose -limiting 
toxicity must be evaluated using either the Planned Dosing Schedule or 
Revised Dosing Schedule before study enrollment will continue with a 
recommended dose and schedule for the combination.

a Planned Dosing Schedule:  Minimum time between Week 3 MEDI0457 dose and the Week 4 first durvalumab  dose, and the Week  7 MEDI0457 dose and the 
Week  8 durvalumab dose is 7 days.  Starting at Week 12, the administration of MEDI0457 and durvalumab treatments can be given on the same day.  Safety Analysis 
run-in patients will initially receive a total of four  doses of MEDI0457 ( Limited Schedule ) as per schedule above.  Based on the rules shown in the Design for Safety 
Analysis Run -in table, the Limited Schedule  (four doses) will be swi tched to the Indefinite Schedule (also known as the Planned Schedule ). 
b A Revised Dosing Schedule  will be evaluated in up to six patients if two or more patients during the Safety Analysis Run-in period experience a dose-limiting 
toxicity.  
c All patients should consent to pre -treatment biopsy of the tumor if it can be done safely (as judged by the Investigator) during screening, otherwise archival t issue 
within 3 years prior to study entry in all patients will be allowed except  for a minimum 1 0 of the first 20 patients who will be required to provide a paired biopsy (a 
fresh biopsy at screening and at Week 10).  After 10 paired biopsies have been obtained then Week  10 on-treatment biopsy will be made optional but will be 
encouraged.

12 (159) Target patient population 
Male or female patients 18 years of age or older with recurrent or metastatic huma n papilloma 
virus associated squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck  with persistent or progressive 
disease after treatment with a platinum based chemotherapy and lacking a curative treatment 
option.  Patients who are  platinum ineligible may be enrolled if they have received and failed 
an approved treatment and lack a treatment option with curative potential.  
Eligible patients must have at least one "measurable target lesion" according to RECIST version 1.1 and one additional lesion that can be safely (as judged by the Investigator) 
biopsied at screening.  Patients are required to provide their consent to have a screening biopsy; otherwise, archival tissue within 3 years prior to study entry in all patients will be 
allowed except for a minimum 10 of the first 20 patients who will be required to provide a 
paired biopsy (a fresh biopsy at screening and at Week 10).  
Duration of treatment  
Safety Analysis Run- in patients will initially receive a total of four initial doses of MEDI0457 
as per schedule and will  start durvalumab treatment at Week 4 and then every 4 weeks.  Based 
on the rules shown in the Design for Safety Analysis Run-in table, the Limited Schedule  
(four doses) will be switched to the Indefinite Schedule  (also known as the Planned 
Schedule ).  For the remaining patients, both MEDI0457 and durvalumab treatment will 
continue until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent .  
Either treatment may be stopped by the Investigator while the other treatment continues. 
Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration 
All patients will receive combination treatment with MEDI0457 (also known as INO -3112)
 
and durvalumab (also known as MEDI4736)  as per the following Planned Dosing Schedule .

27 (159) 1. INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study  
Head and neck cancer accounts for about 3% of all cancers in the United States.  In 2016, an 
estimated 61,760 people (45,330 men and 16,430 women) will develop head and neck cancer.  
It is estimated that 13,190 deaths (9,800 men and 3,390 women) will occur in 2016 from this disease.  
There has been a remarkable shift in the epidemiology of head and neck cancer over the past 30 years.  While exposure to chemical mutagens such as tobacco and alcohol remains the most common risk factor for squamous cell cancers of the aerodigestive tract, a rapidly expanding 
subset of head and neck cancers are acquired through human papilloma virus (HPV) infection.  
The oropharynx is uniquely susceptible to HPV, and now up to 70% of oropharyngeal cancers in the United States are HPV -related.  The HP V viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, are 
predominantly responsible for oncogenesis.  E6 promotes degradation of p53, indirectly activates telomerase, and disrupts the function of the cellular phosphatase tumor suppressor PTPN13.  E7 inactivates retinoblastoma protein and activates Mi2beta.  Together, these 
oncogenic alterations result in the expression of p16, drive rapid cellular proliferation, 
suppress or down regulate key tumor suppressor proteins, and lead to cellular immortality.  In addition, E6/E7 expression is required to maintain a malignant transformed phenotype (Scheffner et al 1990 , Jabbar et al 2009).  
While the currently available prophylactic HPV vaccines are highly effective in preventing infection by HPV types 16 and 18, these have no therapeutic effect, and therefore are of no 
value for patients already diagnosed with human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV-16) or human 
papilloma virus type 18 (HPV-18) positive head and neck cancer.   
1.1.1 Summary of clinical experience  
1.1.1.1 MEDI0457 with electroporation 
MEDI0457, also known as INO-3112, is a combination of plasmids contained in the drug 
products called VGX-3100 and INO-9012.

1.1.1.2 Durvalumab (investigational name MEDI4736) 
Durvalumab is a human monoclonal antibody of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) kappa subclass 
that inhibits binding of programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1).  The proposed mechanism of action for durvalumab is interference of the interaction of PD-L1, expressed on cancer cells 
and a subset of leukocytes, with the programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) molecules on 
antigen -presenting cells and T-cells.  By binding to PD-L1 on tumor cells, the mechanism of 
action of durvalumab includes stimulation of the patient’s anti-tumor immune response.

1.2.1 Rationale for t he study  
Although HPV associated head and neck cancers are generally associated with better 
prognosis than non-HPV cancer, approximately 20-25% of patients treated with curative intent for locoregional disease will have disease progression within 3 years ( Ang et al 2010).

31 (159) In addition, ~8-10% of patients will present with de novo incurable metastatic disease.  
Emerging data from anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti- PD-1) / anti-programmed 
death ligand 1 (anti- PD-L1) therapy in head and neck cancer as well as in other solid tumors 
are very promising with a subset of patients showing tumor regression and delayed progression and improvement in surviva l (Ferris et al 2016, Bauml et al 2016) .  Ho wever, a 
majority of patients do not respond to these novel treatments and thus are in need of additional therapies, including rational immunotherapy combinations.

32 (159) 1.2.2 Rationale for endpoints 
In this first study of MEDI0457 and durvalumab in combination, safety and efficacy will be 
the primary endpoints.  The secondary endpoints of immunogenicity, disease control rate 
(DCR), progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) will be used for deciding if 
further studies are warranted.  In this study, there will be a Safety Analysis Run-in period 
because MEDI0457 and durvalumab have never been administered together.  The Safety Analysis Run-in period patients will be included in the efficacy analys is. 
 
 
1.2.3 Rationale for doses selected  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
Durvalumab (also known as MEDI4736)  has an acceptable safety profile.  As of the data 
cut-off d ate of 12 July 2016, 5,225 patients have been exposed to one or more doses of 
durvalumab in AstraZeneca or MedImmune sponsored studies, either as monotherapy or in combination, including 2,878 patients in open- label trials, and 2,347 patients as an estimate 
based on the randomization scheme in studies where the treatment arm is blinded.  Additionally, > 1,700 patients have been exposed to one or more doses of durvalumab in externally -sponsored / investigator- initiated clinical trials.  The data are not completely 
validated as all studies are ongoing and the databases have not been locked and fully cleaned.  Please refer to the Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure  for detailed data from ongoing studies.  
The 20 mg/kg (or its equivalent 1500 mg fixed dose) of durvalumab every 4 weeks has been tested in multiple studies and has been well tolerated.  
1.2.4 Rationale for study population 
The incidence of HPV associated head and neck cancers is rising and is expected to continue on this trajectory until at least 2030 ( Zandberg et al 2013).  The oropharynx is uniquely 
susceptible to HPV with ~70% of patients with cancer in this site are positive for oncogenic

33 (159) HPV.  A large majority (>  90%) of the cancers are positive for HPV -16 and / or HPV-18.  The 
combination of HPV vaccine with anti- PD-L1 antibody is expected to enhance HPV -specific 
T-lymphocyte responses, resulting in improved outcome for these patients. 
1.3 Benefit / risk and ethical assessment  
1.3.1 Potential benefits - MEDI0457 
The safety profile of MEDI0457 (INO-3112) with EP has been generally acceptable, although 
this is based on a limited number of patients who received MEDI0457 with EP.  In addition to 
the safety, other benefits that already have been observed include (1) a generation of robust antigen -specific immune responses; (2) clinical benefits in patients with hig h grade cervical 
intraepithelial neoplasia, including viral clearance and improvement in pathological grade in the lesion area including viral clearance and improvement in pathological grade in the lesion area ( Trimble  et al 2015 ). 
We expect to observe both immune response to MEDI0457 and clinical benefits in most patients in this study. 
1.3.2 Potential benefits - Durvalumab  
The majority of the safety and eff icacy data currently available for durvalumab  are based on 
the first -time-in-human, single agent study ( CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108) in patients with 
advanced solid tumors.  Safety data are described in the current Durvalumab Investigator’s 
Brochure .  Efficacy data are available f or three monotherapy studies 
(CD-ON-MEDI4736-1108, D4190C00007 and D4191C00003 [ATLANTIC] and two 
combination therapy studies (CD- ON-MEDI4736-1161 and D4190C00006).  Clinical activity 
has been observed across the five studies ( Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure ).

1.3.3 Potential benefits - DNA immunotherapy delivery with electroporation  
DNA vaccines developed by Inovio have been delivered without EP (1 study) or with the 
Inovio EP devices (23 studies).  Inovio EP devices have also been used to deliver DNA vaccines developed outside of Inovio in three different studies and two studies have evaluated 
the tolerability of Inovio EP devices with normal saline.  None of these studies have shown 
any safety concern related to the use of an EP device.  Electroporation indeed significantly enhances DNA transfer to host cells, resulting in robust immune responses ( Sardesai and 
Weiner 2011 ). 
1.3.4 Possible risks - MEDI0457 with electroporation 
DNA based vaccines in general are less risky based on their safety information compared to other forms of vaccines that utilize viral and bacterial vectors.  
In two companion papers by Sheets et al ( Sheets et al 2006a , Sheets et al 2006b ), potential 
toxicities (both intrinsic and immunotoxicities) and biodistribution profiles were compared for 21 different plasmid DNA constructs, in nine separate Good Laboratory Practice  
(GLP)-compliant studies.  Despite differing plasmid DNA backbones, promoters, and sequen ce inserts, toxicity and biodistribution profiles were similar for all plasmid DNA 
constructs.  With respect to the toxicity assessments, the authors reported that toxicity was 
localized to the site of the injection for all 21 plasmid DNA constructs.  Similarly, all plasmid 
DNA constructs evaluated showed evidence that they were localized to the injection site and surrounding tissue in all studies.   
Further, four separate GLP toxicology and biodistribution studies have been performed for 
eight additional plasmid DNA vaccine candidates developed by Inovio with identical backbones delivered by EP yielding similar toxicity and biodistribution profiles.  
Intramuscular (IM) co -administration of interleukin -12 plasmid was evaluated in nonclinical 
studies to support the studies of IM interleukin -12 plasmid in humans.  INO-9012 has been 
used in combinations with other DNA vaccines, including VGX-3100 (i.e., MEDI0457
), in 
several ongoing studies ( HPV-004 Study, HPV-005 Study, HPV-006 Study, PCa -001 Study 
and TRT-001 Study).  There was no safety issue reported from these studies (for further

37 (159) Interleukin- 12 may cause autoimmune events.  This is at least partially associated with its 
Th1-promoting activity, which could favor Th1- mediated immunopathology and, in particular, 
the induction of Th1- mediated autoimmune diseases.  With our clinical experience in the 
HPV- 005 Study, we have not observed any AEs that suggest autoimmune activity or 
autoimmune disorder in patients who have received a DNA vaccine treatment that contains 
INO-9012 (human interleukin- 12 DNA plasmid).  This may reflect the use of IL -12 as a local 
adjuvant in relatively low concentrations as opposed to the administration of systemic doses.  The study team will continue to vigilantly monitor patients for any possible risk of autoimmune AEs during the trial. 
The EP procedure with CELLECTRA
®5P could cause patient discomfort, such as transient 
injection site edema, swelling, or pain.  Adverse events of administration site reactions are of 
special interest to the Sponsor.  These are defined, for the purpose of this protocol, as all AEs 
occurri ng as a result of the administration of the study treatment.  Guidelines for the grading 
and management of administration site reactions are outlined in Appendix I .  In order to 
regularly monitor possible muscle damage, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) testing is scheduled 
during the study treatment.  
Although safety data are generally acceptable for clinical testing, MEDI0457 is an 
investigational agent, and the full safety profile is unknown.  Additionally, it is unknown 
about the possible risk due to the proposed changes in MEDI0457 administration re gimen in 
this study and its combination in this study with other investigational agent durvalumab.  This 
study will provide additional information on the safety profiles of these study treatments alone and in combination. 
1.3.5 Possible risks -  Durvalumab  
Clinically significant risks of interest include immune -mediated reactions and their associated 
signs and symptoms, risks due to immunogenicity, and other potential risks.  
Immune -mediated reactions / immune -related AEs (irAEs) that are important risks include: 
dermatitis / rash / pruritus, ALT / AST increases / hepatitis / hepatotoxicity, endocrinopathy 
(i.e., events of hypophysitis / hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes, 
hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism), neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity  (i.e., events of 
encephalitis, peripheral motor and sensory neuropathies, Guillain- Barré, and myasthenia 
gravis), nephritis and increases in serum creatinine, pancreatitis (or laboratory tests suggestive of pancreatitis -  increased serum lipase / increase d serum amylase), myocarditis / pericarditis / 
uveitis, pneumonitis / interstitial lung disease and diarrhea / colitis.  Hypersensitivity and 
serious allergic reaction events include infusion- related reactions, anaphylaxis / serious 
allergic reactions, and  immune complex disease.  These events are managed based on 
established administration and toxicity management guidelines for this entire class of 
therapeutics (see Appendix H , Postow 2015).

38 (159) 1.3.6 Possible risks and mitigations -  MEDI0457 with electroporation + Durvalumab  
Risks observed (administration site re actions) and anticipated (CPK elevations and 
autoimmune AEs [immunogenicity]) with the administration of MEDI0457 with EP are 
described in Section 1.3.4.  Mitigations in place to reduce the adverse effects of MEDI0457 
with EP administration include: rotation of injection sites, patients are educated to promptly 
report potential skin reactions and obtain visual assessment; protocol guidelines are in pl ace 
for management and reporting of injection / administration site reactions; administration of 
MEDI0457 with EP will not occur in an extremity that contains a metal prosthesis or skin 
which is obscured with tattoos or having in the ipsilateral extremity of the chest an electronic defibrillator / pacemaker device; monitoring of possible muscle damage by measurement of 
CPK testing; clinical manifestation and laboratory monitoring for immunogenicity; and 
persistent CTCAE Grade 3 injection site reactions that persist for > 5 days will be considered a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT).  
Clinically significant risks associated with immune oncology drugs (immune -mediated 
reactions and their associated signs / symptoms, and risks due to immunogenicity) have been briefly  discussed in Section 1.3.5
.  It is reasonable to assume there is possible risk for additive 
or synergistic toxicity with this combination.  Mitiga tions in place to detect and reduce the 
adverse effects of potential immune- mediated reactions include: eligibility criteria excluding 
certain autoimmune conditions present at baseline, baseline laboratory tests and monitoring 
per protocol; patients educat ed and instructed to notify the sites for any signs / symptoms that 
may represent an immune -mediated reaction; protocol guidelines for dose delay / withdrawal 
physical examinations at each site visit; and enlisting investigators familiar with the latest 
immune oncology toxicity management guidelines ( Appendix H , Postow 2015).  
Risks commonly associated with the administration of any foreign protein include: immune 
complex disease, infusion reactions (durvalumab), and anaphylaxis and serious allergic 
reactions.  Mitigations to monitor, detect, and trea t these potential adverse effects are: 
monitoring for the induction of anti -drug antibodies with signs / symptoms of immune 
complex disease; and monitoring of patients during and after administration of both investigational products (IPs) to detect and tre at anaphylaxis / infusion reactions.  
Management criteria are in the protocol and in the appended immune oncology toxicity 
management guidelines ( Appendix H , Postow 2015).  
1.4 Study design  
This is a Phase 1b/2a, open- label, multi- center study to evaluate the safety and tolerability, 
anti-tumor activity , and immunogenicity of MEDI0457 (also known as INO-3112)  in 
combination with durvalumab (also known as MEDI4736) .  Approximately 50 patients with 
HPV associated recurrent / metastatic SCCHN  will be enrolled in this study.  Approximately 
three to 12 patients (Safety Analysis Run- in patients) will be enrolled and assessed for safety 
before additional patients are enrolled at a recommended dose and schedule for the 
combination.  Because this study is the first time MEDI0457 has been combined with 
durvalumab, the study will start with enrollment of a minimum of three patients who will 
receive four doses of MEDI0457 ( Limited Schedule ) in combination with durvalumab.  Only

39 (159) if the safety analysis of the initial patients who complete the 7 -week DLT evaluation period, is 
deemed acceptable (i.e., none of initial patients experience a DLT), the vaccination schedule 
will switch from the limited four doses ( Limited Schedule ) to the Indefinite  Schedule  (also 
known as the Planned Dosing Schedule , i.e. vaccinations will continue until disease 
progression).  The Indefinite Schedule will be implemented for all subsequent patients following the Safety Analysis Run- in.  Otherwise, if a third of the initial patients experience a 
DLT, a minimum of three  additional patients (i.e., a minimum total of six patients for the 
Safety Analysis Run- in) will be enrolled and the initial minimum six patients in the Safety 
Analysis Run-in cohort will be limited to a total of four doses of MEDI0457 
(Limited  Schedule ) before considering a switch to the Indefinite Schedule , provided the 
safety data was supportive and if only no more than a third of these patients experience a DLT 
during their 7-week DLT evaluation period.  If at any time during the enrollment of these 
patients, more than a third of the patients experience a DLT, then this regimen has exceeded 
the MTD and the regimen will be modified.  The choice of modifications in the Revised 
Dosing Schedule  during the Safety Analysis Run-in include the following: (1) dec rease the 
dose of durvalumab to 750 mg Q4W or decrease the total number of durvalumab doses (2) increase the interval between MEDI0457 doses from every 8 weeks to intervals such as 12 or 16 weeks following the Week 12 dose or decrease the total number of MEDI0457 doses 
administered from a total of three to either one or two during the DLT period.  
 
 If the choice includes decreasing the number of vaccines doses 
administered during the DLT  
  At least a minimum of 
three patients with no DLT and up to approximately six patients with no more than a third 
with a DLT must be evaluated using either the Planned Dosing Schedule  or Revised Dosing 
Schedule  before study enrollment will continue with a recommended dose and schedule for 
the combination.  All dose and schedule decisions will be made after careful review of all available data by the SDMC which includes all enrolling investigators and the Sponsor Medical Monitor or designee.  In the Planned Dosing Schedule (after the Safety Analysis is 
complete) both MEDI0457 and durvalumab treatment will continue until confirmed disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of consent.  Either treatment may be stopped by the Investigator while the other treatment continues (refer to Figure 1).  
 
 
 The choice of modifications 
include any of the following: (1) decrease the dose of durvalumab to 750 mg Q4W or decrease the total number of durvalumab doses, (2) increase the interval between MEDI0457 doses 
from every 8 weeks to intervals such as every 12 or 16 weeks following the Week 12 dose or 
decrease the total number of MEDI0547 doses administered from a total of three to either one or two during the DLT period.

screening visit ( Table 2 ) and a urine beta- human chorionic gonadotropin (β -HCG) 
pregnancy test during the treatment period (Table 3).  Women will be considered 
post-menopausal if they have been amenorrheic for 12 m onths without an 
alternative medical cause.  The following age -specific requirements apply: women 
older than 50 years of age (i.e., ≥  50 years) would be considered post -menopausal if 
they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments and if they have luteinizing hormone (LH) and 
follicle -stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the post -menopausal range for the 
institution.  Women younger than 50 years of age (i.e., ≤  50 years) would be 
considered post -menopausa l if they have been amenorrheic for 12 months or more 
following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation- induced 
oophorectomy with last menses >  1 year ago, had chemotherapy -induced 
menopause with >  1 year interval since last menses, o r underwent surgical

of the study and drug washout period is an acceptable practice; however, periodic or 
occasional abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not 
acceptable methods of contraception.  It is strongly recommended for the female partners of a male patient to also use at least one highly effective method of 
contraception throughout this period, as described in Table 1 .  In addition, male 
patients should refrain from fathering a child or donating sperm during the study and for 90 days after the last dose of IP.

22. Patients who are unable to provide informed consent, are incarcerated or unable to follow protocol requirements. 
Procedures for withdrawal of incorrectly enrolled patients see Section 3.4.  
3.3 Patient enrollment and registration  
Investigator(s) should keep a record, the patient screening log, of patients who entered pre-study screening.  
The investigator(s) will:  
1. Obtain signed informed consent from the potential patient before any study specific procedures are performed. 
2. Assign potential patient a unique enrollment number, beginning with ‘E#’.  
3. Determine patient eligibility.  See Section 3. 
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his / her enrollment code cannot be reused.  
Study personnel will screen patients and assign unique patient identification number.  Information regarding patient’s screening number and screen date must be documented on a screening log.  
3.4 Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled patients  
Patients who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not under any circumstances be enrolled or receive study medication.  There c an be no exceptions to this rule.   
Where a patient does not meet all the eligibility criteria but is incorrectly started on -treatment, 
the Investigator should inform the MedImmune Study Physician immediately, and a

51 (159) discussion should occur between the MedI mmune Study Physician and the Investigator 
regarding whether to continue or discontinue the patient from treatment.  The MedImmune 
Study Physician must ensure all decisions are appropriately documented.  
3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups  
Not applicable  for this study.  All patients will receive combination treatment with MEDI0457  
and durvalumab.  
3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding  
Not applicable for this study.  The study is an open- label study. 
3.7 Methods for unblinding  
Not applicable for this study.  The study is an open- label study. 
3.8 Patient instructions  
Patients must be instructed not to take any medications, including over -the-counter products, 
without first consulting with the Investigator.  
Patients will be offered medications to manage anxiety and pain due to the EP procedure by the Investigator (see Section 5.4.9.1).  
The following medications are considered exclusionary during the study.  The Sponsor must be notified if a patient receives any of these during the study. 
1. Any concurrent chemotherapy, IP, biologic, radiotherapy (except palliative 
radiotherapy after consultation with the  Medical Monitor) or hormonal therapy for 
cancer treatment.  Concurrent use of hormones for noncancer related conditions 
(e.g., insulin for diabetes and hormone replacement therapy) is acceptable.  
Concurrent use of adjuvant hormonal therapy for a history of breast and prostate 
cancer is allowed if the cancer for which the subject is being enrolled on this study has been histologically proven NOT to be breast or prostate cancer (Refer to Exclusion Criterion 16).  
2. MEDI0457 or durvalumab cannot be administered when the subject is taking immunosuppressive medications, including corticosteroids with the exception of 
intranasal and inhaled corticosteroids  or systemic corticosteroids at doses not to 
exceed 10 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent.  Treatment with corticosteroids to 
prevent or treat hypersensitivity reactions to radiographic contrast agents is allowed.  
A temporary period of steroids will be al lowed for different indications after 
discussion with the Medical Monitor (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
radiation, nausea, etc).  Use of immunosuppressive medications for the management 
of IP -related AEs or in patients with contrast allergies is acceptable.  
Immunosuppressive medications also include drugs like methotrexate, azathioprine 
and tumor necrosis factor -alpha blockers.

52 (159) 3. Use of anticoagulants and irreversible platelet inhibitors (e.g. clopidogrel, prasugrel, 
ticagrelor etc) are no t allowed .  Low dose aspirin for cardiac prophylaxis is allowed.  
4. Females of childbearing potential (defined as those who are not surgically sterile 
[i.e., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy] or 
post-menopausal)  w ho are sexually active with a non- sterilized male partner must 
use at least one highly effective method of contraception ( Table 1 ) from the time of 
screening and must agree to continue using such precautions from 90 days after the 
last dose of IP; cessation of birth control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician.   
Women will be considered post -menopausal if they have been amen orrheic for 
12 months without an alternative medical cause.  The following age -specific 
requirements apply:  
− Women < 50 years of age would be considered post -menopausal if they have 
been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous 
hormonal treatments and if they have LH and FSH levels in the 
post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization 
(bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).  
− Women ≥  50 years of age would be considered post -menopausal if they have 
been amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments, had radiation- induced menopause with last menses 
> 1 year ago, had chemotherapy- induced menopause with last menses > 1 year 
ago, or underwent surgical sterilizati on (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral 
salpingectomy or hysterectomy). 
A highly effective method of contraception is defined as one that results in a low 
failure rate (i.e., less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly.  
Highly effective meth ods of contraception presented in Table 1  include copper T 
intrauterine device, levonorgestrel -releasing
 intrauterine system (e.g., Mirena®), 
implants, hormone shot or injection, combined pill and patch.

3.9 Discontinuation of investigational product  
An individual patient will not receive any further IP if any of the following occur:  
1. Initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy including another investigational agent  
2. Confirmed PD: the initial assessment of PD by RECIST version 1.1 (baseline PD 
assessment) will be confirmed by a repeat evaluation at the next tumor assess ment 
time point, but no sooner than 4 weeks later.  If any tumor assessment time point 
(beyond the first PD assessment) shows ≥ 20% increase in the overall tumor burden 
(the sum of diameters of target lesions and new lesions), when compared to the 
baseline PD assessment (the sum of diameters of target lesions and new lesions), the patient would be deemed as having confirmed PD and must be discontinued.  
Patients will need to sign an additional informed consent form (ICF) to continue 
treatment beyond the ini tial (unconfirmed) PD assessment.  
3. An AE that, in the opinion of the Investigator or the Sponsor, contraindicates further dosing.  
4. Patient experienced a DLT as defined in Section 6.12.2.1.  
5. Withdrawal of consent from further treatment with investigational product or lost to follow -up.  
6. Patient is determined to have met one or more of the exclusion criteria or failed to meet all of the inclusion criteria for study participation and continuing to receive investigational product might constitute a safety risk.

54 (159) 7. Pregnancy or intent to become pregnant. 
8. Non-compliance with the study protocol that, in the opinion of the Investigator or 
Sponsor, warrants withdra wal from treatment with IP (e.g., refusal to adhere to 
scheduled visits). 
9. The treating Physician determines it is not in the best interest of the patient to 
continue on- treatment.  
3.9.1 Procedures for discontinuation of a patient from investigational product  
At any time, patients are free to discontinue IP or withdraw from the study (i.e., IP and assessments – see Section 3.10),  without prejudice to further treatment.  A patient that decides 
to discontinue investigational therapy will always be asked about the reason(s) and the 
presence of any AEs.  If possible, they will be seen and assessed by an investigator(s).  
Adverse event s will be followed up (see Section 6) and all study drugs should be returned.  
If a patient is withdrawn from study, see Section 3.10. 
3.10 Criteria for withdrawal  
A patient will be considered to have completed the study when he / she completes all protocol specified scheduled study assessments.  The  Follow -up visit will be the last study visit.  
If a patient discontinues or is withdrawn at any time after initiation of study treatment, the Investigator should make every effort to have the patient complete all assessments designated 
for the Follow -up visit.  The Investigator will make every effort to have all scheduled 
assessment blood samples collected as indicated in Table 3.  Any AEs present at the time of 
discontinuation / withdrawal should be followed in accordance with the safety requirements outlined in Section 6. 
All patients will be followed for survival and subsequent anticancer therapy until the end of 
the study.  Patients refusing to return to the site should be contacted by phone to assess for 
survival and subsequent anticancer therapy unless consent is withdrawn every 3 months for 
the first year and every 6 months thereafter until the end of study.  Patients who leave the 
study because of a serious or significant safety issues should be followed closely until the AEs 
are fully and permanently resolved or stabilized (if complete resolution is not anticipated), 
with the follow -up data recorded in the Case Report Form (CRF) (see Section 6.7.3 for further 
details regarding the follow -up of unresolved AEs).  Any AEs that are unresolved at the 
patient’s last visit in the study are followed up by the Investigator for as long as medically indicated,  with follow -up data recording in the CRF.6.7.3).  
If a patient discontinues from treatment for reasons other than disease progression, and 
therefore continues to have tumor assessments, drug or procedure -related SAEs must be 
captured until the patient is c onsidered to have confirmed PD and will have no further tumor 
assessments.

Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
55 (159) Investigator should discuss the reason for any discontinuation of study treatment with the 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor prior to any action or within 24 hours when information becomes  
available.  
The primary reason for the patient discontinuing study treatments or withdrawal from the study should be among the following standard categories:  
• Death.  
• Withdrawal of Consent: The patient desired to withdraw from further participation in the study in the absence of an Investigator -determined medical need to withdraw.  
If the patient gave a reason for withdrawal, it should be recorded on CRF.  This 
reason does not allow for further data collection and should not be selected if 
follow -up data co llection of this patient is anticipated by the patient.  
• Protocol Deviation: The patient’s findings or conduct failed to meet the protocol entry criteria or failed to adhere to the protocol requirements (e.g., treatment non-compliance, failure to return for  defined number of visits).  The violation 
should be discussed with the Sponsor’s Medical Monitor prior to discontinuation of study treatments or study withdrawal.  
• Lost to Follow -up: The patient fails to attend study visits and study personnel are 
unable t o contact the patient after repeated attempts including letter sent by certified 
mail or equivalent.  
• Physician Decision: The patient was terminated for a reason other than those listed 
above by the physician caring for the patient. 
• Other: The patient was t erminated for a reason other than those listed above, such as 
termination of study by the Sponsor. 
3.10.1 Screen failures  
Screening failures are patients who do not fulfill the eligibility criteria for the study, and 
therefore must not be enrolled into the study.  The reason for the screen failure will be 
recorded.  
3.10.2 Withdrawal of the informed consent  
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time (IP and assessments), without prejudice to further treatment.  
A patient who withdraws consent should always b e asked about the reason(s) and the presence 
of any AE.  The Investigator should follow -up AEs outside of the clinical study.  
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his / her enrollment code cannot be reused.

56 (159) 3.11 Safety analysis run -in patients  
Approximately three to 12 patients will be enrolled and assessed for safety before additional 
patients are enrolled at a recommended dose and schedule for the combination.  Because this 
study is the first time MEDI0457 has been combined with durvalumab, the study will start with enrollment of a minimum of three patients who will receive four doses of MEDI0457 
(Limited Schedule ) in combination with durvalumab.  Only if the safety analysis of the initial 
patients, who complete the 7- week DLT evaluat ion period, is deemed acceptable (i.e., none of 
the initial patients experience a DLT), the vaccination schedule will switch from the limited four doses ( Limited Schedule ) to the  Indefinite Schedule  (also known as the Planned 
Dosing Schedule , i.e. vaccinat ions will continue until disease progression).  This Indefinite 
Schedule will be implemented for all subsequent patients following the Safety Analysis Run- in.  Otherwise, if a third of the initial patients experience a DLT, a minimum of three 
additional pa tients (i.e., a minimum total of six patients for the Safety Analysis Run -in) will 
be enrolled and the initial minimum six patients in the Safety Analysis Run -in cohort will be 
limited to a total of four doses of MEDI0457 ( Limited Schedule ) before considering a switch 
to the Indefinite Schedule , provided the safety data was supportive and if only no more than a 
third of these patients experienced a DLT during their 7-week DLT evaluation period.  If at 
any time during the enrollment of these patients, more t han a third of the patients experience a 
DLT, then this regimen has exceeded the MTD and the regimen will be modified.  The choice 
of modifications in the Revised Dosing Schedule  during the Safety Analysis Run-in include 
the following: (1) decrease the dos e of durvalumab to 750 mg Q4W or decrease the total 
number of durvalumab doses (2) increase the interval between MEDI0457 doses from every 8 weeks to intervals such as 12 or 16 weeks following the Week 12 dose or decrease the total 
number of MEDI0547 doses administered from a total of three to either one or two during the 
DLT period.  
 If the choice includes decreasing the number of 
vaccines doses administered during the DLT  
.  At le ast a 
minimum of three patients with no DLT and up to approximately six patients with no more than a third with a DLT must be evaluated using either the Planned Dosing Schedule  or 
Revised Dosing Schedule  before study enrollment will continue with a recommended dose 
and schedule for the combination.  
In order to adequately monitor the safety of patients in Study D8860C00005, there will be two 
levels of ongoing monitoring of safety data for this study.

63 (159) a Targeted physical examination will be performed at all visits except at the Follow -up visit for which a complete physical examination will be performed.  
b Patients discontinued from treatment for reasons other than PD will continue disease assessments until confirmed PD or start of subsequent anticancer therapy.  Magnetic 
resonance imaging scan of the brain will be performed at screening and also at each assessment if there are abnormalities at baseline.  The preferred method of disease assessment is CT with contrast except for brain metastasis where a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast is preferred.  The same method is preferred for all subsequen t tumor 
assessments for the same patient.  
c Temperature, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, HR and weight.  
d Vital signs will be measured within 30 minutes prior to the start of durvalumab administration, every 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) during durvalumab administration, at the end of 
durvalumab infusion ( ± 5 minutes), followed by a 1 hour (± 15 minutes) collection, and period of observation except for Week 10.  A 1 hour observation period is required after 
the first  infusion of durvalumab is a dministered . 
e Electrocardiograms are to be collected in triplicate (all three ECG assessments within a 5 minute time period) within 30 minu tes before dosing of MEDI0457 and 30- 60 minutes 
after dosing at Weeks 1, 3, 7 and 12 and thereafter single ECGs at pre-dose at subsequent dosing visits.  Triplicate (all three ECG assessments within a 5 minute time period) 
ECGs will be performed within 30 minutes before dosing of MEDI4736 at Week 4 and 30- 60 minutes after dosing of MEDI4736 at Weeks 4 and 12.  An ECG a ssessment can 
also be performed if clinically indicated and according to the Investigator.  
f Free T 3 and free T 4 will only be measured if TSH is abnormal.  They should also be measured if there is clinical suspicion of an AE related to the endocrine system . 
j Core tumor biopsies will be collected.  At least three core samples are required if samples are collected are via a core needle of 18 gauge or larger or are collected as an excisional tumor biopsy sample.  When a smaller gauge needle is used, the number of  required cores rises to four .  Either fresh tissue or formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded samples may be 
used.  
Archival tissue within 3 years prior to study entry in all patients will be allowed  except  for a minimum 10 of the first 20 patients who will be r equired to provide a paired 
biopsy (a fresh biopsy at screening and at Week 10).  After 10 paired biopsies have been obtained then Week 10 on-treatment biopsy will be made optional but will be 
encouraged.    
k Serum chemistry and hematology will be performed on Day 1, Week 7, Week 8 and Week 12, then every 4 weeks for the first 12 months and every 3  months thereafter until 
study discharge.  Thyroid function testing will be performed on Day 1, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12, then every 4 weeks for the  first 12 mo nths and every 3 months thereafter 
until study discharge.  Urinalysis will only be performed if clinically indicated.  
l After scan and durvalumab administration are completed in Week 8.  Disease status assessments should continue to be performed  at every 8  weeks ±  5 days for 1 year if CR / PR 
/ SD are achieved and then every 12 weeks ±  7 days until end of treatment (EOT).  
m Additional baseline blood samples will be also collected in a 10  mL red top tube in order to have serum samples collected at baseline for future analysis which includes but is not 
limited to an autoimmune work -up (refer to the Laboratory Manual for the processing of this sample).  
n If physical examination, ECOG, weight or safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, creatine phosphokinase, thyroid function testing and pregnancy tests) are performed within 3 days prior to Day 1, they do not need to be repeated.  Patients with a negative serum pregnancy test within 3 days prior to Day 1, do not require a Week 1 Day 1 pregnancy test to be  performed.  
o All visit windows will be ±3 days with the following exceptions: tumor biopsy assessments will have the visit window of ±7 da ys; disease status assessments every 8  weeks 
(± 5 days) (relative to the date of the first MEDI0457 administration) f or 1 year.  After the first year on treatment, if CR / PR / SD are achieved then disease status assessments 
can be performed every 12 weeks ( ± 7 days) until the EOT.  Disease status assessments will be performed once at the end of treatment if PD is observ ed, otherwise at end of 
treatment and then at Day 90 ± 7 days, every 3  months after Day  90 up to Month 12 ± 7 days then every 6 months after Month 12 ± 14 days until the death of the patient, 
withdrawal of consent or loss to follow -up.  
p A dministration of  the COVID-19 vaccine and MEDI0457 should be separated by 14 days.

Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
66 (159) 4.1 Enrollment / screening period  
Procedures will be performed according to Table 2 .  
At screening, consenting patients are assessed to ensure that they meet eligibility criteria.  
Patients who do not meet these criteria must not be enrolled in the study.  
All patients will be required to provide consent to supply a sample of their blood and urine as 
well as a fresh tumor biopsy sample (at least three or four core samples, refer to 
Section  5.8.1.1 for further details) for entry into this study.  This consent is included in the 
main patient ICF.  
4.2 Treatment period  
Descriptions of the procedures for this period are included in Table 3.  
4.3 Follow-up period  
Descriptions of the procedures for this period are included in Table 4 . 
4.4 Continued Treatment Period  
The data cut -off for the primary endpoint will be  in Q1 2021. Data analysis will be performed, 
and a Clinical Study Report will be written based on this data cut -off. 
Any patients st ill receiving IP at the time of this data cut- off will be able to continue to receive 
MEDI0457 or durvalumab or both within the current study through a Continued Treatment Period.  Patients are eligible for the Continued Treatment Period if the Investigator determines 
the patient is deriving clinical benefit from treatment and the patient has not fulfilled 
discontinuation criteria.   Investigators also have the option to remove patients from the 
Continued Treatment Period after 2 years of treatment with MEDI 0457 and durvalumab.  
Patients are often removed from immunotherapy treatment after 2 years because the necessity for further treatment is not clear, and disease control with immunotherapy can last for a year or more after the end of treatment.  If Investi gators decide to keep patients on treatment, these 
patients may continue until 30 April  2023, when the MEDI0457 drug supply expires  and the 
study will end. 
During the Continued Treatment Period, assessments will revert to the standard of care for 
each indi vidual site. Data will not be entered into the clinical study database after the data 
cut-off date.  Patients will continue to be monitored for all SAEs, overdoses, and pregnancies 
up to 28 days after the last dose of IP.  Paper -based reporting will be use d for any SAE, 
overdose, or pregnancy identified after the data cut -off. All reported events will be entered in 
to the AstraZeneca global safety database.  
The I nteractive V oice and Web R esponse  System  will be closed following the data cut -off, 
and sites will manually order IP. The IP dispensation and reconciliation will be handled by the 
study site at each patient’s visit. Drug accountability information must still be collected until 
all patients have completed treatment.

Date 17 March 2021 
67 (159) After the data cut -off for the Clinical Study Report, individual study sites will be closed once 
their final patient completes the 28 -day follow -up visit. The Continued Treatment Period will 
remain available to patients until the last patient discontinues treatment and has his or her  
28-day safety follow -up visit. The Last Subject Last Visit in the Continued Treatment Period 
is defined as the date of the last patient’s final visit.  
5. STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
The RAVE Web Based Data Capture (WBDC) system will be used for data collection and 
query handling.  The Investigator will ensure that data are recorded on the electronic CRFs as 
specified in the study protocol and in accordance with the instructions provided. 
The Investigator ensures the  accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of the data recorded and 
of the provision of answers to data queries according to the Clinical Study Agreement.  The 
Investigator will sign the completed electronic CRFs.  A copy of the completed electronic 
CRFs will be archived at the study site. 
5.1 Demographics  
The demographics (date of birth, sex and race) details for each patient will be collected at the screening visit. 
5.2 Medical history  
The Investigator should document all relevant and clinically significant medical conditions and illnesses that the patient has experienced at time of screening as medical history.  Medical history should include treatment detailed information on all therapy directed against recurrent 
/ metastatic HPV associated SCCHN  e.g., past surgica l and / or radiation regimens.  Any prior 
chemotherapy or immunotherapies, adjuvants, etc should be recorded on the CRFs. 
Illnesses first occurring or detected after the signing of ICF or during the study and / or 
worsening of an existing illness in severi ty, frequency or nature after the signing of ICF are to 
be documented as AEs on the CRF. 
5.3 Efficacy assessments  
RECIST version  1.1 will be used to assess patient response to treatment by determining ORR, 
DCR -16w and PFS.  Objective response rate will also be  assessed using irRECIST.  The 
RECIST version  1.1 guidelines for measurable, non- measurable, target and non -target lesions 
are presented in Appendix F .  Overall survival will also be evaluated.  
The methods of assessment of tumor burden used at baseline are CT and / or or magnetic 
resonance imaging ( MRI) scans, preferably with IV contrast imaging, of the neck (including 
the base of skull) through chest a nd abdomen.  Any other areas of disease involvement should 
be additionally imaged based on the signs and symptoms of individual patients.  At the 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance MEDI0457+Durvalumab  
Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
68 (159) discretion of the Sponsor, an independent central review of all scans used in the assessment of 
tumors by RECI ST version 1.1 and/or irRECIST may be conducted.  Guidelines for imaging 
collection and storage will be provided in a separate document.  The management of the 
patients will be based solely upon the results of assessment conducted by the investigator 
based  on RECIST version 1.1 per protocol.  
The baseline assessment should be performed no more than 28 days before the start of 
MEDI0457 treatment and ideally as close as possible and not later than the start of the IP.  
Efficacy for all patients will be assesse d by disease status assessments every 8 weeks 
(± 5 days) (relative to the date of the first MEDI0457 administration; Table 3) for 1 year.  
After the f irst year on treatment, if CR / partial response (PR) / SD are achieved then disease 
status assessments can be performed every 12 weeks ( ± 7 days) until the end of treatment.  
Disease status assessments will be performed once at the end of treatment if PD is observed, otherwise at end of treatment and then at Day 90 ± 7 days, every 3 months after Day  90 up to 
Month 12 ±  7 days then every 6 months after Month 12 ±  14 days until t he death of the 
patient, withdrawal of consent or loss to follow -up.  Disease assessment will also stop if 
patient is started on subsequent anticancer therapy.  If an unscheduled assessment is performed, and the patient has not progressed, every attempt should be made to perform the 
subsequent assessments at their scheduled visits ( ± 14 days).   
For patients who discontinue therapy due to toxicity in the absence of confirmed objective 
progression, disease status assessments should be continued until confirm ed PD or start of 
subsequent anticancer therapy.  
Patients who discontinued from treatment for reasons other than PD will continue disease assessments until confirmed PD or start of subsequent anticancer therapy.  
Progression would be considered confirmed i f the following criterion is met: 
• Confirmed PD: the initial assessment of PD by RECIST version 1.1 (baseline PD assessment) will be confirmed by a repeat evaluation at the next tumor assessment time point, but no sooner than 4 weeks later.  If any tumor as sessment time point 
(beyond the first PD assessment) shows ≥ 20% increase in the overall tumor burden (the sum of diameters of target lesions and new lesions), when compared to the baseline PD assessment (the sum of diameters of target lesions and new lesi ons), the 
patient would be deemed as having confirmed PD and must be discontinued from treatment.  Patients will need to sign an additional ICF to continue treatment beyond the initial (unconfirmed) PD assessment.  
In the absence of clinically significant d eterioration, the Investigator should continue study 
treatment until progression is confirmed.  
If progression is not confirmed, the patient should continue on study treatment and on-treatment assessments.

Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
69 (159) If a patient discontinues treatment prior to progre ssion, the patient should still continue to be 
followed until confirmed objective disease progression or until subsequent anticancer 
treatment.  
If the Investigator is in doubt as to whether progression has occurred, particularly with response to non- target  lesion or the appearance of a new lesion, it is advisable to continue 
treatment until the next scheduled assessment or sooner if clinically indicated and reassess the 
patient’s status.  If repeat scans confirm progression, then the date of the initial sca n should be 
declared as the date of progression.  
Tumor assessments should include the following evaluations: physical examination (with photograph and measurement of skin lesions as applicable) and CT or MRI scan of the neck, 
chest, abdomen, and pelvis (pe lvic scan is optional unless known pelvic disease is present at 
baseline).  Magnetic resonance imaging scan of the brain will be performed at screening and 
also at each assessment if the patient is found to have abnormalities at baseline scan.  The 
preferred method of disease assessment is CT with contrast except for brain metastasis where an MRI with contrast is preferred.  If CT with contrast is contraindicated, CT without contrast 
is preferred over MRI.  A CT with contrast may be substituted for an MRI w ith contrast if an 
MRI is contraindicated.  The same method is preferred for all subsequent tumor assessments 
for the same patient.  Note: if a patient receives a combined positron emission tomography (
PET) / diagnostic quality CT scan at screening, a CT s can without PET later in the study is 
acceptable.  
The response to immunotherapy may differ from the typical responses observed with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy including the following ( Wolchok et al 2009, Nishino et al 2013):  
• Response to immunotherapy may be delayed.  
• Response to immunotherapy may occur a fter PD by conventional criteria.  
• The appearance of new lesions may not represent PD with immunotherapy. 
• Stable disease while on immunotherapy may be durable and represent clinical benefit.  
Progression free survival measures progression by growth of the primary tumor, nodal spread metastases, death from the cancer, or death from other causes.  Progression free survival will be assessed by the periodic tumor assessment using imaging per the institutional guidelines at the schedules according to Table 3.  
All study evaluations for disease response must be based on RECIST version 1.1.

Based on the above -described unique response to immunotherapy and based on guidelines 
from regulatory agencies, e.g., European Medicines Agency’s “Guideline on the evaluation of 
anti-cancer medicinal products in man” (EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev.4)  for immune modulating 
anticancer compounds, the study will implement the following in addition to standard 
RECIST version  1.1: 
• RECIST  will be modified so that PD must be confirmed at the next scheduled visit, 
preferably, and no earlier than 4 weeks after the initial assessment of PD in the 
absence of clinically significant deterioration.  Treatment with MEDI0457 and 
durvalumab would continue between the initial assessment of progression and confirmation for progression.  
5.4 Safety assessments 
5.4.1 Laboratory safety assessments  
At screening, blood samples will be collected for hematology and serum chemistry.  Blood samples will also be taken for  LH and FSH (for select patients), CPK, thyroid function testing 
(if thyroid stimulating hormone [TSH] is abnormal then free triiodothyronine [T
3] and free 
thyroxine [T 4] will be required to be measured, if TSH is normal then free T 3 and free T 4 are 
not re quired to measured), coagulation tests (activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT] 
and either International Normalized Ratio [INR] or prothrombin time), hepatitis B and 
hepatitis C testing.  Testing for HIV is only required if clinically indicated and is  not 
mandatory for this study.  A urine sample will also be obtained to determine eligibility (see 
Table 2 ).  
A serum pregnancy test will be performed  for women of childbearing potential at the 
screening visit. A urine pregnancy test will be performed during the treatment period. 
A local laboratory will be used for the collection of blood and urine samples (see Laboratory 
Manual for further details).   
Blood and urine samples will be collected during the IP administration period for 
determination of hematology, serum chemistry, CPK, thyroid function testing (TSH, free T 3 
and free T 4), coagulation tests (prothrombin time, APTT and INR).  A urine pregnancy test 
will be taken at the times indicated in Table 3.  Urinalysis will be taken if clinically indicated 
as deemed by the Investigator ( Table 3 ). 
Additional baseline blood samples will be also collected in a 10  mL red top tube in order to 
have serum samples collected at baseline for future analysis which includes but is not limited to an autoimmune work- up (Table 3) (refer to the Laboratory Manual for the processing of 
this sample).

71 (159) Blood samples will also be taken at the Follow -up visit (28 days after the last dose [±  7 days]) 
for determination of hematology, serum chemistry, CPK and thyroid function testing (TSH, 
free T 3 and free T 4), at the times indicated in Table 4 . 
Additional safety samples may be collected if clinically indicated at the discretion of the Investigator.  The date, time of collection and results (values, units and reference ranges) will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.  
The Investigator should make an assessment of the available results with regard to clinically relevant abnormalities.  The laboratory results should be signed and dated and retained at  the 
Investigator’s site as source data for laboratory var iables.  For information on how AEs based 
on laboratory tests should be recorded and reported, see Section 6.7.  Note: In case a patient shows an AS T or ALT ≥ 3 x ULN or TBL ≥ 2 x ULN please refer to Appendix D  for further 
instructions. 
The hematology, serum chemistry and urinalysis will be perfor med at a local laboratory at or 
near to the Investigator site (see Table 5 , Table 6  and Table 7 , respectively).  Sample tubes 
and sample sizes may vary depending on laboratory method used and routine practice at the 
site.

Antibodies to, hepatitis B and hepatitis C will be measured.  Antibodies to HIV will only be 
measured if clinically indicated.  
Patients positive for hepatitis C antibody are eligible only if polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
is negative f or hepatitis C virus RNA.  
Patients with a positive HBsAg test at screening are not eligible for the study.  
Patients who are HBsAg and HBcAb negative, but are positive for hepatitis virus B surface antibody may be included in the study provided that all other eligibility criteria are satisfied.   
A hepatitis virus B DNA test will be performed if the patient is HBsAg negative but HBcAb 
positive (regardless of hepatitis virus B surface antibody status).   
• If the hepatitis virus DNA test is positive, the patien t will be excluded.   
• If the hepatitis virus DNA test is negative, the patient may be included in the study.   
Prophylactic antiviral therapy, in addition to the monitoring described above, may be initiated at the discretion of the Investigator.  
If the pa tient becomes hepatitis virus DNA positive during the study, the Investigator will 
manage the clinical situation as per the standard of care of that institution and the Medical 
Monitor will be notified.   
Urinalysis

For women of reproductive potential, a negative result for serum pregnancy test (test must 
have a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) must be available at the screening visit and a urine 
β-HCG pregnancy test is required to be performed during the treatment period at the  
frequency shown in Table 3.  If at any point, the β -HCG (pregnancy) test is positive, 
indicating that the patient is pregnant, no additional IP will be administered, but the patient will be followed for the duration of the study and beyond to determine the outcome of the 
pregnancy (with the patient’s consent).  
5.4.3 Physical examination  
A complete physical examination will be performed and include an assessment of the 
following: general appearance, respiratory, CV, abdomen, skin (for signs of injection site 
reactions due to MEDI0457 or EP), head and neck (including ears, eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, abdomen, musculoskeletal (including spine and extremities) and 
neurological systems at screening and Follow -up visits.  A targeted physical exami nation to 
document changes in any medical condition since the last visit will be performed at all other 
visits.  
5.4.4 WHO / ECOG performance status  
A WHO / ECOG performance status will be conducted at screening, during IP administration and at follow -up.  A WHO / ECOG performance status will be performed at other visits as 
determined by Investigator or directed per patient complaints. 
WHO / ECOG performance status ( Oken et al 1982 ) will be assessed based on the following:  
0=Fully active; able to carry out all pre -disease performance without restrictions. 
1=Restricted in physically strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out light work 
or work of a sedentary nature, e.g., light housework, office work.  
2=Ambulatory and capable of self -care but unable to carry out any work activities.  Up and 
about more than 50% of waking hours.  
3=Capable of only limited self -care, confined to bed or chair more than 50 % of waking hours.  
4=Completely disabled.  Unable to carry out any self -care and totally confined to bed or chair.  
5=Dead  
Any significant changes from baseline or screening must be reported as an AE. 
5.4.5 Post-treatment reaction assessment  
The Investigator will  assess local and systemic reactions post -treatment (within 30 -60 minutes 
after study treatment) and at post -treatment visits.  Any reported MEDI0457 local

75 (159) post-treatment reactions and systemic post- treatment reactions will be graded per NCI 
CTCAE version 4.03 and all must be recorded on the CRFs. 
5.4.6 Vital signs  
Vital signs including temperature, respiration rate, pulse oximetry, blood pressure, HR and 
weight will be measured at all the study visits.  
On infusion days, patients receiving durvalumab treatment will be monitored during and after infusion of IP as present in the bulleted list below.  
Supine blood pressure will be measured using a semi -automat ic blood pressure recording 
device with an appropriate cuff size, after the patient has rested for at least 5 minutes.  Blood 
pressure and pulse will be collected from patients receiving durvalumab before, during and after each infusion at the following ti mes (based on a 60  minute infusion):  
• Prior to the beginning of the infusion (measured once from approximately 
30 minutes before up to 0 minutes [i.e., the start of the infusion]).  
• Approximately every 30 minutes (± 5 minutes) after start of the infusion (ha lf way 
through the infusion). 
• At the end of the infusion (approximately 60 minutes ± 5 minutes). 
• A 1 hour (± 15 minutes) observation period is required after each infusion of 
durvalumab is administered if clinically significant infusion reactions are obser ved 
during or after the first dose and at Investigator discretion . 
If no clinically significant infusion reactions are observed during or after the first dose, the 
length of subsequent infusion observation periods can occur at the Investigator’s discretion (suggested 30 minutes after each durvalumab infusion).  If the infusion duration exceeds 
60 minutes, then blood pressure and pulse measurements should follow the principles as 
described above or be obtained more frequently if clinically indicated.  The da te and time of 
collection and measurement will be recorded on the appropriate CRF.  Additional monitoring 
with assessment of vital signs is at the discretion of the Investigator per standard clinical 
practice or as clinically indicated.  
Situations in which  vital signs results should be reported as AEs are described in 
Section  6.7.9. 
5.4.7 Weight and height  
Height (cm) will be collected at the screening visit only.  Weight (kg) will be collected at the screening visit, each additional visit from Week 1 to the Follow -up visit.

76 (159) 5.4.8 Electrocardiogram  
An ECG will be performed at screening within 28 days of Day 0 for all patients to determine 
patient eligibility and as clinically indicated throughout the study.  Three 12- lead ECG 
recordings are required in triplicate (all three ECG assessments within a 5 minute time period) at the screening visit.  
The following parameters will be recorded for each ECG: da te and time of ECG, HR 
(beats/min), PR interval (ms), RR interval (ms), QRS interval (ms), QT interval (ms), QTcF 
interval (for Fridericia’s) (ms), QTcB interval (ms), sinus rhythm (yes / no), and overall 
evaluation (normal / abnormal).  
Abnormal ECGs shoul d be interpreted as clinically significant or not clinically significant.  
In case of clinically significant ECG abnormalities, including a QTcF value >  470 ms, 
two additional 12- lead ECGs should be obtained over a brief period (e.g., 30 minutes) to 
confirm  the finding.   
Electrocardiograms should be obtained after the patient has been in a supine position for 5 minutes and recorded while the patient remains in that position.  Electrocardiograms will be 
performed in triplicate.  Electrocardiograms will be re ad and collected locally and held in 
digital format by core laboratory.  
Electrocardiograms are to be collected in triplicate (all three ECG assessments within a 5 minute time period)  within 30 minutes before dosing of MEDI0457 and 30- 60 minutes after 
dosing at Weeks 1, 3, 7 and 12 and thereafter single ECGs at pre -dose at subsequent dosing 
visits.  Triplicate (all three ECG assessments within a 5 minute time period) ECGs will be performed within 30 minutes before dosing of MEDI4736 at Week 4 and 30- 60 minu tes after 
dosing of MEDI4736 at Weeks 4 and 12.  An ECG assessment can also be performed if clinically indicated and according to the Investigator. 
5.4.9 Other safety assessments  
5.4.9.1 Management of anxiety and pain due to electroporation procedure  
Patients will be of fered topical  anesthetic (e.g., EMLA [lidocaine +  prilocaine ]), to prevent 
significant discomfort from the study treatment procedure.  If EMLA (lidocaine 2.5% and 
prilocaine 2.5%) is used, an approximately 1.5 cm diameter amount will be applied with occlus ion to the site of injection ~30 minutes prior to study treatment.  
Patients may be offered a mild sedative (e.g., 0.5- 1 mg lorazepam) for anxiety related to the 
EP procedure.  Mild sedatives may be administered approximately 1 hour prior to EP.  Patients who receive a mild sedative must not be allowed to operate a motor vehicle for 
3-4 hours after receiving medication and must have arranged transportation to depart the study 
site. 
Patients will be offered an analgesic (e.g., ibuprofen, ketorolac) after study treatment.  Note: The use of any narcotic (including Tylenol
® [acetaminophen] with codeine) for pain meets the

77 (159) definition of severe pain (Grade 3) and therefore will not be offered to the patients unless 
clinically indicated.  
Patients who are allergic t o or have contraindications to ibuprofen, ketorolac or lorazepam 
will be offered a suitable alternative.  
Medications administered to manage anxiety and pain due to the EP procedure will be captured as concomitant medications on the CRF. 
5.4.9.2 Monitoring of durvalumab administration  
 
  
Note: Per Inclusion criterion 3, patients who weigh < 30 kg will recei ve durvalumab at 
20 mg/kg at every 4 weeks and if their weight increases to ≥  30 kg they can be switched to 
durvalumab at 1500 mg every 4 weeks.  If in the course of the study after the Safety Analysis 
Run-in the dose is reduced to 750 mg of durvalumab, then patients who weigh ≤ 30 kg will 
receive durvalumab at 10 mg/kg at every 4 weeks and if their weight increases to ≥ 30 kg they can be switched to durvalumab at 750 mg every 4 weeks.  
The following steps apply specifically to durvalumab.  Each dose of durvalumab should be administered using the following guidelines: 
• Investigational product must be administered at room temperature by controlled infusion into a peripheral vein or central line.  Prior to the start of the infusion, ensure that the bag contents are at room temperature to avoid an infusion reaction due to the administration of the solution at low temperatures. 
• A physician must be present at the site or immediately available to respond to emergencies during all administrations of IP.  Fully functional resuscitation facilities should be available.  Investigational product must not be administered via 
IV push or bolus but as a slow IV infusion.  The entire content of each IV bag will 
be infused. 
• Lines used for infusion during dose administration will need to be equipped with 0.22- or 0.2- μm in -line filters.  
• Some IP may remain in the IV line after the infusion has completed.  A volume of IV solution equal to the priming volume of the infusion set should be used to flush 
the lines.  A separate flush bag may be used to clear the line or remaining IP.  The 
infusion rate should not be changed.  The infusion should be completed according to the institutional policy to ensure that the full dose of the IP is administered.  It will be documented if the line was not flushed.

Date 17 March 2021 
78 (159) 5.4.9.3 Management of infusion reactions due to durvalumab  
Patients will be monitored during and after the infusion with assessment of vital signs at the 
times specified in the study protocol. 
In the event of a ≤  Grade 2 infusion- related reaction, th e infusion rate of study drug may be 
decreased by 50% or interrupted until resolution of the event and re- initiated at 50% of the 
initial rate until completion of the infusion.  For patients with a ≤  Grade 2 infusion- related 
reaction, subsequent infusions may be administered at 50% of the initial rate.  If the patient 
tolerates subsequent infusions without reaction, the infusion rate may be increased again back 
to the initial infusion rate.  Acetaminophen and / or an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per institutional standard may be administered at the discretion of 
the Investigator.  If the infusion- related reaction is ≥  Grade 3 or higher in severity, study drug 
will be discontinued. 
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible.  Appropriate 
drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylactic reactions must be immediately 
available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis.  The study site must have immediate acc ess to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in addition 
to the ability to admit patients to an intensive care unit if necessary.  
Note: Any infusion-related reaction is considered as an AESI.  As soon an AE is entered into the Medidata RAVE system by the site and an AESI is selected, then the site must inform 
MedImmune within 24 hours post-infusion.  In addition, all infusion-related reactions should 
be reported to MedImmune within 24 hours post-infusion.  If in the opinion of the Investigato r, the infusion-related reaction is considered to be an SAE, then the infusion- related 
reaction should be reported as an SAE. 
5.4.9.4 Assessment of clinical adverse events  
Patients will be questioned by the Investigator regarding the occurrence of any possible AEs, 
concomitant medications and new onset chronic disease during their clinic visits.  Patients will 
be reminded to contact study personnel and immediately report any event that may happen for 
the duration of the study.  These events will be recorded on the patient’s CRF.  
5.5 Other assessments  
5.5.1 Downloading of electroporation data from CELLECTRA®5P device 
Within 48 hours following each treatment with MEDI0457, data should be downloaded from the EP device and the data file that is created should be sent to the Sponsor or designee by

Patients enrolled in the study can receive coronavirus disease of 2019 ( COVID -19) vaccines, 
at the discretion of the Investigator, following a benefit/risk evaluation for the individual 
patient and in accordance with local rules and regulations and vaccination guidelines.  
Investigators should consider the potential impact of relevant labelling information (i.e. 
“Indications,” “Contraindications,” “Warnings and Precautions,” “Adverse Reactions”).  
Except for the specific type of vaccine (e.g., live , attenuated virus vaccines) prohibited in the 
study (Section 3.2 Exclusion criteria), any type of COVID -19 vaccinations are acceptable.  
Alternative vaccines available in the investigator’s area would need to be discussed, in the interest of the patient, as part of normal patient counselling and good clinical practi ce. 
Administration of MEDI0457 and the COVID -19 vaccine should be separated by 14 days.  
Ensure the  COVID -19 vaccination details (including brand name and manufacturer) are 
captured in the e lectronic CRF or patient chart as concomitant medication .  
5.6 Pharmac okinetics  
5.6.1 Collection of samples  
Blood samples for determination of durvalumab levels  in serum will be taken at the visits 
presented in the study plan ( Table 3).  
Pre-dose sampling (samples collected up to 60 minutes prior to durvalumab start of 
administration) for both ADA and pharmacokinetic sampling schemes of durvalumab.  
Samples will be collected, labeled stored and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual.  
A central laboratory will be used for the collection of blood for pharmacokinetic analysis (see 
Laboratory Manual for further details).  
5.6.2 Determination of drug concentration  
Blood samples for determination of durvalumab concentration in serum wil l be obtained 
according to the assessment schedules (see Table 3).   
Samples for determination of durvalumab  concentration in serum will be analyzed by a 
designated third party on behalf of MedImmune, using an appropriate bioanalytical method.  
Full details of the analytical method used will be described in a separate Bioanalytical Report.  
5.6.3 Storage and destruction of pharmacokinetic / anti -drug  antibody samples  
Pharmacokinetic and ADA samples will be disposed of 5 to 10 years after durvalumab  is 
approved for marketing. 
Pharmacokinetic and ADA samples may be disposed of or destroyed and anonymized by 
pooling.  Additional analyses may be conducted on the anonymized, pooled pharmacokinetic

80 (159) samples to further evaluate and validate the analytical method.  Results from such analyses 
may be reported separately from the Clinical Study Report. 
Incurred sample reproducibility analysis, if any, will be performed alongside the bioanalysis 
of the test samples.  The results from the evaluation will not be reported in the Clinical Study 
Report but separately in a Bioanalytical Validation Report. 
 
 
5.6.4 Collection of samples to measure for the presence of anti -drug antibody  
The presence of ADA will be assessed in serum samples taken according to the assessment schedules (see Table 3 ).   
Samples will be measured for the pr esence of ADA using validated assays.  Tiered analysis 
will be performed to include screening, confirmatory, and titer assay components, and positive 
negative cut points previously statistically determined from drug- naïve validation samples will 
be employed.  Samples will be collected and stored for potential neutralizing ADA analysis in 
the future.

5.8.4 Labeling and shipment of biological samples 
The Principal Investigator ensures that samples are labeled and shipped in accordance with the 
Laboratory Manual and the Biological Substance, Category B Regulations (mate rials 
containing or suspected to contain infectious substances that do not meet Category A criteria), see Appendix B  ‘IATA 6.2 Guidance Document’. 
Any samples identified as Infectious Category A materials are not shipped and no further 
samples will be taken from the patient unless agreed with MedImmune and appropriate labeling, shipment and containment provisions are approved. 
5.8.5 Chain of custody of biological samples  
A full chain of custody is maintained for all samples throughout their lifecycle. 
The Principal Investigator at each center will keep full traceability of collected biological 
samples from the patients while in storage at the center until shipment or disposal (where appropriate) and keeps documentation of receipt of arrival. 
The sample receiver keeps full traceability of the samples while in storage and during use until 
used or disposed of or until further shipment and keeps documentation of r eceipt of arrival.  
MedImmune keeps oversight of the entire life cycle through internal procedures, monitoring of study sites and auditing of external laboratory providers. 
Samples retained for further use are registered in the MedImmune Biorepository during the 
entire life cycle.  
5.8.6 Withdrawal of informed consent for donated biological samples  
If a patient withdraws consent to the use of donated biological samples, the samples will be disposed of / destroyed, and the action documented.  If samples are already analyzed, MedImmune is not obliged to destroy the results of this research. 
The Principal Investigator: 
• Ensures patients’ withdrawal of informed consent to the use of donated samples is 
notified immediately to MedImmune.  
• Ensures that biological samples from that patient, if stored at the study site, are 
immediately identified, disposed of / destroyed, and the action documented.

6. SAFETY REPORTING AND M EDICAL MANAGEMENT  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are familiar with the content of this section.  
6.1 Definition of adverse events  
Adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated with th e use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related ( Guidance for Industry and Investigators ). 
In this study, such changes will be monit ored, classified, and summarized, and as Clinical or 
Laboratory AEs, respectively.  Medical condition / diseases present before starting the 
investigational drug will be considered AEs only if they worsen after starting study treatment. 
An unexpected  AE is  one not identified in the Investigator’s Brochures ( MEDI0457 
Investigator’s Brochure  and Durvalumab Investigator ’s Brochure ) or otherwise not expected 
from the characteristics of the clinical material.  
Adverse events include the following:  
• Pre- or post -treatment complications that occur as a result o f protocol -mandated 
procedure during or after the first screening visit (before the administration of study drug).  
• Any pre -existing condition that increases in severity, or changes in nature during or 
as a consequence of the study drug phase of a human cli nical trial, will also be 
considered an AE.  
• Complications and termination of pregnancy; see Section 6.11 for additional information. 
• All AEs that oc cur from the study screening visits onwards and throughout the 
duration of the study, including the follow -up off -study treatment period should be 
recorded as an AE.  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance MEDI0457+Durvalumab  
Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
86 (159) Adverse events do not include the following:  
• Medical or surgical procedures (e.g., surgery, endoscopy, tooth extraction, 
transfusion) performed; the condition that leads to the procedure is an AE.  
• Pre-existing diseases or conditions or laboratory abnormalities present or detected 
before the screening visits that do not worsen.  
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not occurred (e.g., 
hospitalization for elective surgery, social and / or convenience admissions). 
• Overdose without clinical sequelae.  
• Any medical condition or clinically significant laboratory abnormality with an onset date before the consent form is signed and not related to a protocol associated procedure is not an AE.  It is considered to be pre -existing and should be 
documented on the medical history CRF. 
• Uncomplicated pregnancy (documented on a pregnancy CRF).  
• An induced elective abortion to terminate a pregnancy without medical reason 
(documented on a pregnancy CRF).  
The term AE is used to include both serious and non- serious AEs.  
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse events  
An AE or suspected adverse react ion is considered ‘‘serious’’ if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes: death, a life -threatening 
AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, a persistent or 
significa nt incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions, 
or a congenital anomaly / birth defect.  Important medical events that may not results in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered seri ous when based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require 
medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in 
inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse ( Guidance for 
Industry and Investigators ). 
Clarification of Serious Adverse Events  
• Death is an outcome of an AE, and not an AE in itself.  Note: death due to disease 
progression is not considered to be an SAE (see Section 6.7.13 for further details).  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance MEDI0457+Durvalumab  
Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
87 (159) • The patient may not have been on IP at the occurrence of the event.  Administration 
may have been given as treatment cycles or interrupted temporarily before the onset of the SAE, but may have contributed to the event. 
• “Life- threatening” means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred.  This does not include an event that might have led to death if it had occurred with greater severity.  
• Complications that occur during hospitalizations are AEs.  If a complication prolongs the hospitalization, it is an SAE. 
• Inpatient hospitalization means the patient has been formally admitted to a hospital 
for medical reasons, for any length of time.  This may or may not be overnight.  It 
does not include presentation and care within an emergency department.  
The Investigator should attempt to establish a diagnosis of the event on the basis  of signs, 
symptoms, and / or other clinical information.  In such cases, the diagnosis should be documented as the AE and / or SAE and not the individual signs / symptoms. 
Serious adverse events that are ongoing should be followed until resolution.  The r eporting 
period for SAEs is described in Section 6.8. 
For further guidance on the definition of an SAE, see Ap pendix A  to the Clinical Study 
Protocol. 
6.3 Definition of adverse reactions  
An adverse reaction means any AE caused by a drug.  Adverse reactions are a subset of all 
suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the drug caused the event 
(Guidance for Industry and Investigators ). 
6.4 Definition of suspected adverse r eactions  
Suspected adverse reaction means any AE for which there is a reasonable possibility that the drug caused the AE.  For the purposes of Investigational New Drug (IND) safety reporting, 
‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the drug and the AE.  A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree of certainty about 
causality than adverse reaction, which means any AE caused by a drug ( Guidance for Industry 
and Investigators ). 
6.5 Definition of unexpected events / reactions  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘unexpected’’ if it is not listed in the 
Investigator’s Brochure or is not liste d as the specificity or severity that has been observed; or 
if an Investigator’s Brochure is not required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application, as am ended.  For example, under this definition, hepatic necrosis would be 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance MEDI0457+Durvalumab  
Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
88 (159) unexpected (by virtue of greater severity) if the Investigator’s Brochure referred only to 
elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis.  Similarly, cerebral thromboembolism and cerebral vascul itis would be unexpected (by virtue of greater specificity) if the Investigator Brochure 
listed only cerebral vascular accidents.  ‘‘Unexpected’’ as used in this definition, also refers to AEs or suspected adverse reactions that are mentioned in the Invest igator’s Brochure as 
occurring with a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation ( Guid ance for Industry and Investigators ). 
6.6 Definition of life -threatening events / reactions  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered ‘‘life -threatening’’ if, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the patient or subject at immediate risk of 
death.  It does not include an AE or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death ( Guidance for Industry and Investigators ). 
6.7 Recording of adverse events  
6.7.1 Time period for collection of adverse events  
Adverse events and SAEs will be collected from time of s ignature of informed consent, 
through 90 days after the last dose of the last study treatment.  Note: AEs / SAEs that occur post-signature but prior to IP administration are non- treatment -emergent AEs / SAEs.  When a 
patient is defined as a screen failure,  AE data will not be collected in the CRF.  The site will 
document AE data and keep the data in their files at the site.  
6.7.2 Methods and timing of the collection and recording of adverse events  
After study treatment: Patients will be directly observed by study  personnel for 30- 60 minutes 
after each administration of MEDI0457 IM+EP for immediate reactions.  Injection sites will 
also be assessed at the subsequent study visit.  
The occurrence and severity of any AE during this period will be recorded on the appropr iate 
CRF.  Patients will be given an oral thermometer and instructed to take and record their temperature daily (at the same time each day).  
Throughout the study: Patients will also be questioned by the Investigator regarding the 
occurrence of any possible  AEs, concomitant medications and new onset chronic disease 
during their clinic visits.  Patients will be reminded to contact study personnel and 
immediately report any event that may happen for the duration of the study.  If events occur, these events wil l be recorded on the patient’s CRF.  
On study treatment visits, the assessments will be performed prior to administration.  Study patients will be queried at each clinic visit regarding the occurrence of any AEs, including 
SAEs that may have occurred since  the last visit.  They will be reminded to contact study 
personnel and immediately report any such event that happens during the course of the study.  
These events will be recorded on the CRFs.

89 (159) 6.7.3 Follow -up of unresolved adverse events  
During the course of the study, all AEs and SAEs should be proactively followed up for each 
patient.  Every effort should be made to obtain a resolution for all events, even if the events continue after discontinuation or study completion. 
Any AEs that are unresolved at the pati ent’s last visit in the study are followed up by the 
Investigator for as long as medically indicated, with follow -up data recording in the CRF.  
MedImmune retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing 
AE(s) / SAE(s) at th e end of the study, if judged necessary.  
6.7.4 Variables  
The following variables will be collected for each AE:  
• Adverse event (verbatim)  
• The date and time when the AE started and stopped 
• Each CTCAE grade for a repeated AE  
• Whether the AE is serious or not  
• Investigator causality rating against the IP (yes or no)  
• Action taken with regard to IP  
• Administration of treatment for the AE  
• Whether the AE caused the patient’s withdrawal from the study (yes or no)  
• Outcome  
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs: 
• Date AE met criteria for serious AE  
• Date Investigator became aware of serious AE  
• Seriousness criteria fulfilled  
• Date of hospitalization  
• Date of discharge  
• Probable cause of death  
• Date of death

Drug Substance MEDI0457+Durvalumab  
Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
90 (159) • Whether an autopsy was performed  
• Causality assessment in relation to study procedure(s) and other medication(s)  
• Description of AE  
The grading scales found in the revised NCI CTCAE version 4.03 will be utilized for all 
events with an assigned CTCAE grading.  For those events without assigned CTCAE grades, 
the recommendation in the CTCAE criteria that converts mild, moderate, and severe events 
into CTCAE grades should be used.   
It is imp ortant to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 6.2.  An AE of severe intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not an SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2.  On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be an SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in S ection 6.2. 
6.7.5 Severity codes for adverse events  
Study personnel will grade laboratory AEs and clinical AEs (based on discussions with study participan ts) with respect to the following levels of severity as defined in NCI CTCAE version 
4.03. 
The determination of severity for all other events not listed in the CTCAE should be made by 
the Investigator based upon medical judgment and the severity categories of Grade 1 to 5 as defined below:  
• Grade 1 (mild): An event that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic interv ention.  The event does not generally interfere with 
usual activities of daily living (ADL).  
• Grade 2 (moderate): An event that is usually alleviated with additional specific 
therapeutic intervention.  The event interferes with usual ADL, causing discomfort  
but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the patient. 
• Grade 3 (severe): An event that requires intensive therapeutic intervention.  The event interrupts usual ADL, or significantly affects the clinical status of the patient.  
• Grade 4 (life -threatening): An event, and / or its immediate sequelae, that is 
associated with an imminent risk of death or with physical or mental disabilities that affect or limit the ability of the patient to perform ADL (eating, ambulation, toileting, etc).  
• Grade 5 (fa tal): Death (loss of life) as a result of an event.

Date 17 March 2021 
91 (159) 6.7.6 Causal relationship of investigational product to adverse events  
A causally related AE is one judged to have a possible, probable or definite relationship to the 
administration of the IP and / or the inve stigational device.  An AE may also be assessed as 
not related to the IP and / or the investigational device.  Because the Investigator is 
knowledgeable about the patient (e.g., medical history, concomitant medications), administers 
the IP, and monitors the patient’s response to the IP, the Investigator is responsible for reporting AEs and judging the relationship between the administration of the IP and EP and a 
subsequent AE.  The Investigator is aware of the patient’s clinical state and thus may be 
sensi tive to distinctions between events due to the underlying disease process versus events 
that may be product related and may have observed the event.  The Sponsor will assess the 
overall safety of the IP delivered by EP and determine whether to report expeditiously to the 
regulatory agencies.  
Investigators should use their knowledge of the Study Patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an 
AE is considered to be related  to the IP and / or the investigational device indicating "yes" or 
"no" accordingly.  Causality should be assessed by the Investigator as “yes, related” or “no, unrelated” by the following criteria:  
• Yes – there is a reasonable possibility that administration of the Study Treatment 
contributed to the event.  
• No – there is no reasonable possibility that administration of the Study Treatment 
contributed to the event and there are more likely causes.  
The following guidance should also be taken into consideration:  
• Temporal relationship of event to administration of IP and / or EP. 
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, discontinuation of IP, or reintroduction of IP (where applicable).  
• Known association of the event with the IP, EP or with similar treatments.  
• Known association of the event with the disease under study. 
• Presence of risk factors in the Study Patient or use of concomitant medications known to increase the occurrence of the event.  
The Investigator is also required to provide an assessment of relationship of SAEs to protocol 
procedures on the SAE Report Form.  This includes non- treatment -emergent SAEs (i.e., SAEs 
that occur prior to the administration of IP) as well as treatment- emergent SAEs.  A 
protocol -related SA E may occur as a result of a procedure or intervention required during the 
study (e.g., blood collection, washout of an existing medication).  The following guidelines 
should be used by investigators to assess the relationship of SAEs to the protocol:  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance MEDI0457+Durvalumab  
Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
92 (159) Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure / intervention that was described in 
the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the patient’s medical record.  
Not protocol related: The event is related to an etiology other than t he procedure / intervention 
that was described in the protocol (the alternative etiology must be documented in the study 
patient’s medical record).  
6.7.7 Relationship to protocol procedures  
The Investigator is also required to provide an assessment of the relati onship of SAEs to 
protocol procedures on the SAE Report Form.  This includes both non- treatment- emergent 
(i.e., SAEs that occur prior to the administration of IP) and treatment -emergent SAEs.  A 
protocol -related SAE may occur as a result of a procedure or intervention required during the 
study (e.g., blood collection).  The following guidelines should be used by investigators to assess the relationship of SAEs to the protocol:  
• Protocol related: The event occurred due to a procedure or intervention that was described in the protocol for which there is no alternative etiology present in the patient’s medical record.  
• Not protocol related: The event is related to an etiology other than the procedure or 
intervention that was described in the protocol.  The alternative etiology must be 
documented in the study patient’s medical record.  
6.7.8 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms  
All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or reported in response to the open question from the study personnel: “Have you had any healt h problems since the previous visit / you 
were last asked?” or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the CRF.  
When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred, when possible, to recording a 
list of signs and symptoms.  Howe ver, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or 
symptoms that are not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom 
will be recorded separately.  
6.7.9 Adverse events based on examinations and tests  
The results from protocol -mandated laboratory tests and vital signs will be summarized in the 
Clinical Study Report.  Deterioration as compared to baseline in protocol -mandated laboratory 
values and vital signs should therefore only be reported as AEs if they fulfill any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for discontinuation of treatment with the IP.  
If deterioration in a laboratory value / vital sign is associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE and the associated laboratory result 
/ vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Wherever possible the reporting 
Investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (e.g., anemia versus low 
hemoglobin value).  In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant deteriorations in non- mandated parameters should be reported as AE(s).  
Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
93 (159) Deterioration of a laboratory value, which is unequivocally due to disease progression, should 
not be reported as an AE / SAE. 
Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnorm al medical finding at a physical examination 
as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE.  
6.7.10 Abnormal laboratory value  
Laboratory abnormalities are only to be reported as AEs, if the Investigator feels they are 
clinically significant.  At the time of entry, the site physician will grade the laboratory 
abnormality that they feel is an AE.  Other laboratory abnormalities will not be graded.  In 
addition, laboratory or other abnormal assessments (e.g., ECG, x- rays, vital signs) that are 
associated with signs and / or symptoms must be recorded as an AE or SAE if they meet the 
definition of an AE (or SAE) as described in Sections 6.1 and  6.2.  If the laboratory 
abnormality is part of a syndrome, record the syndrome or diagnosis (e.g., anemia) not the laboratory result (e.g., decreas ed hemoglobin).  
Any laboratory abnormality that is new in onset or worsened in severity or frequency from the baseline condition and meets one of the following criteria will be recorded as an AE:  
• Requires therapeutic intervention or diagnostic tests  
• Leads to discontinuation of study treatment  
• Has accompanying or inducing symptoms or signs  
• Is judged by the Investigator as clinically significant  
Grade is an essential element of these criteria.  Each CTCAE grading term in the current version is a unique representation of a specific event used for medical documentation and scientific analysis and is a single Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) Lowest Level Term.  Note: the most current version of MedDRA will be used. 
Investigators are ask ed to take the CTCAE grading criteria into account when assessing if a 
laboratory abnormality qualifies as a laboratory AE.  Their clinical judgment ultimately 
determines whether the abnormality in question is “clinically significant” or “not clinically 
significant” and the severity of the event.  CTCAE grading can be used as a reference when 
making this determination.  It is the responsibility of the investigators to ensure all AEs are accurately reported and graded.  
6.7.11 New cancers  
The development of a new cancer should be regarded as an SAE.  New primary cancers are those that are not the primary reason for the administration of the study treatment and have been identified after the patient’s inclusion in this study. 
Clinical Study Protocol

Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
94 (159) 6.7.12 Disease progression  
Disease progression can be considered as a worsening of a patient’s condition attributable to 
the disease for which the IP is being studied.  It may be an increase in the severity of the disease under study and / or increases in the symptoms of the disease.  The development of 
new, or progression of existing metastasis to the primary cancer under study should be 
considered as disease progression and not an AE.  Events, which are unequivocally due to disease progression, should not be reported as an AE during the study. 
6.7.13 Deaths  
All deaths that occur during the study, or within the protocol -defined follow -up period after 
the administration of the last dose of study treatment, must be reported as follows:  
• Death clearly resulting from disease progression should be reported to the St udy 
Physician at the next monitoring visit and should be documented in the CRF.  It 
should not be reported as an SAE. 
• Where death is not due (or not clearly due) to progression of the disease under 
study, the AE causing the death must be reported to the St udy Physician as an SAE 
within 24 hours.  The report should contain a comment regarding the 
co-involvement of PD, if appropriate, and should assign main and contributory 
causes of death.  
• Deaths with an unknown cause should always be reported as an SAE.  A post-mortem examination may be helpful in the assessment of the cause of death, 
and if performed, a copy of the post -mortem results should be forwarded to 
MedImmune Drug Safety or its representative within the usual timeframes.  
6.8 Reporting of serious adverse  events  
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the study procedure(s).  All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF. 
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel inform  
the appropriate MedImmune representatives within one day i.e., immediately but no later 
than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it . 
PRA works with the Investigator to ensure that all the necessary information is provided to the 
MedImmune Patient Safety Data Entry Site within 1  calendar day  of initial receipt for fatal 
and life -threatening events and within 5 calendar  days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.  
For fatal or life -threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, ac tive 
follow -up is undertaken immediately.  Investigators or other site personnel inform 
MedImmune representatives of any follow -up information on a previously reported SAE 
within one calendar day i.e., immediately but  no later than 24 hours of when he or s he 
becomes aware of it .

Date 17 March 2021 
95 (159) Once the investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system, 
an automated e -mail alert is sent to the designated MedImmune representative.  
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or  other study site personnel 
reports an SAE to the appropriate MedImmune representative by telephone.  The Principal Investigator must use the back- up paper SAE Report recognizing that the same reporting time 
frames still apply.  
The MedImmune representative will advise the investigator / study site personnel how to proceed.  
6.9 Reporting of serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions  
The Sponsor must report in an IND safety report any suspected adverse reaction to study treatment (i.e., including active comparators) that is both serious and unexpected.  Before 
submitting an IND safety report, the Sponsor needs to ensure that the event meets all three of 
the definitions ( Guidance for Industry and Investigators ): 
• Suspected adverse reaction  
• Serious  
• Unexpected  
If the AE does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an IND 
safety report.  
The timeframe for submitting an IND safety report, any serious unexpected suspected adverse reaction which is not fatal or life -threatening to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is 
no later than 15 calendar days  after the Sponsor determines that the suspected adverse 
reaction or other information qualifies for reporting. 
Unexpected fatal or life- threatening suspected adverse reactions shall be reported by the 
Sponsor to FDA is no later than 7 calendar days  after the Sponsor’s initial receipt of the 
information (in accordance with 21 CFR 312.32(c)(2)).  
The day of initial receipt for cases that are interpretable as single cases and the day the 
Sponsor determines that multiple cases qualify for expedited reporting are considered day zero.  
If FDA requests any additional data or information, the Sponsor shall submit it to FDA as soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days  after receiving the request (in 
accordance with 21 CFR 312.32(c)(1)(v)).

96 (159) 6.10 Overdose  
An overdose is defined as a pa tient receiving a dose of IP(s) in excess of that specified in the 
Investigator’s Brochures ( MEDI0457 Investigator’s Brochure  and Durvalumab Investigator’s 
Brochure ), unless otherwise specified in this protocol. 
Any overdose of a study patient with IP, with or without associated AEs / SAEs, is require d to 
be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to the Sponsor designee.  If the 
overdose results in an AE, the AE must also be recorded as an AE (see Section 6.7).  
Overdose does not automatically make an AE serious, but if the consequences of the overdose 
are serious, for example death or hospitalization, the event is serious and must be recorded and 
reported as an SAE (see Section 6.8).  There is currently no specific treatment in the event of an overdose of either MEDI0457 or durvalumab (see M EDI0457 Investigator’s Brochure  and 
Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure ).  
The Invest igator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.  
• An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis / symptoms on the relevant AE modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module.  
• An overdose without associated symptoms is only report ed on the Overdose CRF 
module. 
If an overdose on a MedImmune study drug occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel inform appropriate MedImmune representatives immediately, or no later than 24 hours  of when he or she becomes aware of it. 
PRA works with the  Investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the 
MedImmune Patient Safety Data Entry Site.  
For overdoses associated with an SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply, see S ection 6.8.  
For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 days. 
6.11 Pregnancy  
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to Med Immune. 
6.11.1 Maternal exposure  
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study the IP should be discontinued immediately.  
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the IP under study may have interfered with the eff ectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  Congenital 
abnormalities / birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.
  The outcome 
of all pregnancies  (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance MEDI0457+Durvalumab  
Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
97 (159) birth or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the patient 
was discontinued from the study. 
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then t he Investigator or other site personnel 
informs the PRA within 1  day i.e., immediately  but no later than 24 hours  of when he or she 
becomes aware of it . 
PRA works with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the 
MedImmune Patient Safety Data Entry Site within 1 or 5  calendar days for SAEs (see 
Section  6.8) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.  
The same timelines  apply when outcome information is available. 
The PREGREP module in the CRF is used to report the pregnancy and the PREGOUT is used 
to report the outcome of the pregnancy.  
6.11.2 Paternal exposure  
Male patients must refrain from fathering a child or donating spe rm during the study since the 
potential for chromosomal aberrations in male gametes, and possible teratogenic effects 
thereof, has not yet been thoroughly investigated.  Male patients who are sexually active must use a barrier (condom with spermicide) meth od of contraception from the first dose until 
90 days after the last dose of IP.  
Pregnancy of the patients’ partners is not considered to be an AE.   
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then investigators or other site personnel 
must inform  PRA within 1 day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
becomes aware of it.  
PRA will work with the Investigator to ensure that all relevant information is provided to the MedImmune Patient Safety Data Entry Site within 1 or 5 days  for SAEs, see Section 6.8 and 
within 30 days for all other pregnancies.  
6.12 Management of investigational product related toxicities  
6.12.1 Dose modifications  
Either treatment may be stopped by the Investigator while the other treatment continues. 
MEDI0457 and durvalumab dose should not be modified.  
Durvalumab: For AEs that are considered at least partly due to administration of durvalumab 
the following dose adjustment guidance may be applied:  
• Treat each of the toxicities with maximum supportive care (including holding durvalumab).  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance MEDI0457+Durvalumab  
Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
98 (159) • If the symptoms promptly resolve with supportive care, consideration should be 
given to continuing the same dose of durvalumab along with appropriate continuing 
supportive care.  If medically appropriate, dose modifications are permitted for 
durvalumab.  
• All dose modifications should be documented with clear medical reasoning and documentation of the approach tak en. 
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which durvalumab should be permanently 
discontinued ( Appendix H, Postow 2015).  
Following the first dose of durvalumab, subsequent administration of durvalumab can be 
modified based on toxicities observed ( Appendi x H, Postow 2015).  All toxicities will be 
graded according to NCI CTCAE version 4.03. 
Based on the mechanism of action of durvalumab leading to T -cell activation and 
proliferation, there is the possibility of observing irAEs during the conduct of this study.  
Potential irAEs include immune -mediated dermatitis, hepatitis / hepatotoxicity, 
endocrinopathy (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, and adrenal insufficiency), 
neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity, nephritis, pancreatiti s (elevated lipase / amylase), 
pneumonitis, and colitis.  Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of irAEs.  In 
the absence of an alternate etiology (e.g., infection or PD) signs or symptoms of dermatitis, 
hepatitis / hepatotoxicity, endocrinopathy (hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, hypophysitis, 
and adrenal insufficiency), neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity, nephritis, pancreatitis (elevated lipase / amylase), pneumonitis, and colitis should be considered to be immune -
related.  Refer to the lat est Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure  for more information. 
Dose modifications will not be required for AEs that are clearly not attributable to durvalumab (such as an accident) or for laboratory abnormalities that are not deemed to be clinically 
significant.  Administration may continue despite concurrent vitiligo of any AE grade.  
Acetaminophen and / or an antihistamine (e.g., diphenhydramine) or equivalent medications per institutional standard may be administered prior to infusion at the discretion of the 
Investigator for primary prophylaxis against infusion- related reactions. For more information 
on dose modification for immune -related reactions please refer to Appendix  H.  
As with any antibody, allergic reactions to dose administration are possible.  Appropriate drugs and medical equipment to treat acute anaphylac tic reactions must be immediately 
available, and study personnel must be trained to recognize and treat anaphylaxis.  The study 
site must have immediate access to emergency resuscitation teams and equipment in addition to the ability to admit patients to a n intensive care unit if necessary.  
6.12.2 Toxicity management  
The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor or a designee will be responsible for the overall safety monitoring of the study.

Grading of DLTs will be according to the NCI CTCAE version 4.03. 
For the Safety Analysis Run- in patients, the DLT period will be 4 weeks after their first 
durvalumab dose.  
A DLT will be defined as any Grade 3 or higher treatment -related toxicity that occurs during 
the DLT evaluation period (i.e., 4 weeks after the first dose of durvalumab is administered for 
patients in the Safety Analysis Run -in), including the following treatment -related toxicities: 
(a) Any Grade 4 irAE is a DLT.  
(b) Any ≥ Grade 3 colitis is a DLT.  
(c) Any ≥ Grade 3 non -infectious pneumonitis irrespective of duration is a DLT. 
(d) Any ≥ Grade 3 neurotoxicity (to include but not limited to limbic encephalitis, autonomic neuropathy, including peripheral neuromotor  syndromes such as 
myasthenia gravis and Guillain- Barré) irrespective of duration is a DLT.  
(e) Any ≥ Grade 3 cardiotoxicity (to include but not limited to arrhythmias, myocarditis with cardiomyopathy, ventricular dysfunction) irrespective of duration is a DLT . 
(f) Any ≥ Grade 3 ocular toxicity (including but not limited to iritis, uveitis, significant vision changes) irrespective of duration is a DLT.  
(g) Any ≥ Grade 3 irAE, excluding colitis or pneumonitis or neurotoxicity or cardiotoxicity and ocular toxicity as mentioned above, that does not downgrade to 
Grade 2 within 3 days after onset of the event despite optimal medical management 
including systemic corticosteroids or does not downgrade to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline within 14 days. 
(h) Alanine aminotransferase or ALT elevation > 8 × ULN or TBL > 5 × ULN. 
(i) Any ≥ Grade 3 non -irAE, except for the exclusions listed below. 
− Grade 3 or greater injection site reaction that is persistent beyond 5 days or does not downgrade to ≤ Grade  1 in 14 days. 
− Grade 3 or greater fever, not associated with above listed events (a to f), assessed by Principal Investigator as related to study treatment.  
− Grade 3 or greater systemic symptoms, not associated with above listed events (a to e), assessed by Principal Investigator as related to study t reatment.  
− Any Grade 3 or greater anaphylaxis related to study treatment.

100 ( 159) The DLT definition excludes the following conditions:  
• Grade 3 fatigue lasting ≤ 7 days. 
• Grade 3 endocrine disorder (thyroid, pituitary, and / or adrenal insufficiency) that is 
managed with or without systemic corticosteroid therapy and / or hormone 
replacement therapy and the patient is asymptomatic.  
• Grade 3 inflammatory reaction attributed to a local anti- tumor response (e.g., 
inflammatory reaction at sites of metastatic disease, lymph nodes, etc).  
• Concurrent vitiligo or alopecia of any AE grade.  
• Grade 3 infusion- related reaction (first occurrence and in the absence of steroid 
prophylaxis) that resolves within 6 hours with appropriate clinical management. 
• Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia that  is not associated with fever or systemic infection that 
improves by at least one grade within 3 days.  Grade 3 or Grade 4 febrile neutropenia will be a DLT  regardless of duration or reversibility. 
• Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia. 
• Grade 3 thrombocytopenia that is  not associated with clinically significant bleeding 
that requires medical intervention, and improves by at least one grade within 3 days. 
• Isolated Grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities that are not associated with clinical signs or symptoms and are reversed w ith appropriate maximal medical intervention 
within 3 days. 
Immune -related AEs are defined as AEs of immune nature (i.e., inflammatory) in the absence 
of a clear alternative etiology.  In the absence of clinical abnormality, repeat laboratory testing will be conducted to confirm significant laboratory findings prior to designation as a DLT.  
6.12.2.2 Events requiring expedited reporting within 24 hours  
Overdose  
An overdose is defined as a patient receiving a dose of IP in excess of that specified in the 
Investigator’ s Brochures ( MEDI0457 Investigator’s Brochure  and Durvalumab Investigator’s 
Brochure ), unless otherwise specified in this protocol. 
Any overdose of a study patient with IP , with or without associated A Es / SAEs, is required to 
be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to the Sponsor designee.   If the 
overdose results in an AE, the AE must also be recorded as an AE (see Section 6.7).  Overdose does not automatically make an AE s erious, but if the consequences of the overdose 
are serious, for example death or hospitalization, the event is serious and must be recorded and 
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance MEDI0457+Durvalumab  
Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
101 ( 159) reported as an SAE (see Section 6.8).  There is currently no specific treatment in the event of 
an overdose of MEDI0457 or durvalumab.  
The Investigator will use clinical judgment to treat any overdose.  
Hepatic Function Abnormality 
Hepatic function abnormalit y (as defined in Section 6.12.4) in a study patient, with or without 
associated clinical manifestations, is required to be reported as “hepatic fun ction abnormal” 
within 24 hours of knowledge of the event to the Sponsor or designee unless a definitive 
underlying diagnosis for the abnormality (e.g., cholelithiasis or bile duct obstruction) that is 
unrelated to IP has been confirmed.  
If the definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality has been established and is unrelated 
to IP, the decision to continue administration of the study patient will be based on the clinical 
judgment of the investigator. 
If no definitive underlying diagnosis for the abnormality is established, administration of IP to 
the study patient must be interrupted immediately.  Follow -up investigations and inquiries 
must be initiated by the investigational site without delay.  Each reported event of hepatic 
function abnormality will be followed by the Investigator and evaluated by the Sponsor. 
Hy’s Law  
Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation 
and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3 x ULN together with TBL  ≥ 2 x ULN may need to be 
reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix D for further instruction on cases of increases in 
liver biochemistry and evaluation of Hy’s Law ( HL). 
Pregnancy  
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study, the IP shoul d be discontinued 
immediately.   
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the IP under study 
may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  Congenital 
abnormalities or birth defects and spontane ous miscarriages should be reported and handled as 
SAEs.  Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs.  The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth, or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the patient was discontinued from the study.   
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel 
should inform the Sponsor or designee within 1 day, i .e., immediately, but no later than 
24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.

6.12.2.3 Events requiring reporting within 72 hours  
The following events must be reported to Sponsor within 72 hours of the occurrence of the event to discuss whether further administration should continue for the participant. 
• Grade 3 or greater injection site reaction.  
• Grade 3 or greater fever, not associated with above listed events (a to f) in Section  6.12.2.1, assessed by Principal Investigator as related to study treatment. 
• Grade 3 or greater systemic symptoms, not associated with above listed events (a to e) in Section  6.12.2.1, assessed by Principal Investigator as related to study 
treatment.  
6.12.3 Stopping rules  
The Sponsor reserves the right to temporarily pause or terminate the study at any time.  The reasons for temporarily pausing or terminating the study may include but are not limited to the following:  
• If at any time during the study one -third or more patients experience any DLT 
assessed as related to study treatment, furth er enrollment and study treatments may 
be halted until a thorough investigation has been conducted by the Sponsor.  
• If a death occurs within 8 weeks of a dose of MEDI0457 or durvalumab and it is assessed as related to study treatment, further enrollment an d study treatments may 
be halted depending upon further discussions between the Sponsor and / or investigator.  
• In the event of any unexpected Grade 4 toxicities, assessed as related to study treatment, further enrollment and study treatments may be halted until a thorough investigation has been conducted by the Sponsor and / or investigator. 
• The study may be halted for any report of Grade 3 anaphylaxis from study treatment 
with MEDI0457 or durvalumab in two or more patients. 
• Non-compliance that might significantly jeopardize the validity or integrity of the 
study. 
• Sponsor decision to terminate development.  
• Sponsor decision to terminate the study based on a planned futility analysis.

103 ( 159) 6.12.4 Adverse events of special interest  
An AESI is of scientific and medic al interest specific to understanding of the IP and may 
require close monitoring and rapid communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor.  An 
AESI may be serious or non- serious.  The rapid reporting of AESIs allows ongoing 
surveillance of these events i n order to characterize and understand them in association with 
the use of this IP.  
Adverse events of special interest for MEDI0457 and durvalumab include but are not limited 
to events with a potential inflammatory or immune -mediated mechanism and which m ay 
require more frequent monitoring and / or interventions such as steroids, immunosuppressants 
and / or hormone replacement therapy.  These AESIs are being closely monitored in clinical 
studies with durvalumab monotherapy and combination therapy.  An irAE  is defined as an AE 
that is associated with drug exposure and is consistent with an immune -mediated mechanism 
of action and where there is no clear alternate etiology.  Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used t o support an irAE diagnosis.  
Appropriate efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or 
other etiologic causes of the irAE.  If the Investigator has any questions in regards to an AE 
being an irAE, the Investigator should promptly contact the Study Physician.  Identified risks 
(listed / expected reactions) for durvalumab include:  diarrhea, ALT increase, AST increase, 
pneumonitis, and colitis / enterocolitis.  
Adverse events of special interest observed with MEDI0457 and durvalumab include:  
• Diarrhea / colitis  
• Pneumonitis  
• ALT / AST increases / hepatitis / hepatotoxicity  
• Neuropathy / neuromuscular toxicity (i.e., events of encephalitis, peripheral motor 
and sensory neuropathies, Guillain- Barré, and myasthenia gravis)  
• Endocrinopathy (i.e., events of hypophysitis, hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, type 1 diabetes, hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism)  
• Dermatitis / rash / pruritus  
• Nephritis  
• Pancreatitis (or laboratory tests suggestive of pancreatitis -  increased seru m lipase, 
increased serum amylase)  
• Myocarditis / pericarditis  
• Uveitis

104 ( 159) • Infusion- related reactions / hypersensitivity / anaphylactic reactions  
• Administration site reactions (any administration site reaction other than pain, and if 
the event is pain it must be Grade 3 or greater pain)  
 
Further information on these risks (e.g., presenting symptoms) can be found in the current 
version of the MEDI0457 Investigator’s Brochure  or the Durvalumab Investigator’s Brochure .  
For more specific guidelines for their evaluation and treatment refer to Appendix H . 
Adverse events of special interest are required to be reported within 24 hours of knowledge of the event on the electronic CRF, even if the event is considered to be non- serious.  
Hy’s Law
 
Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3 x ULN together with TBL  ≥ 2 x ULN may need to be 
reported as SAEs.  Please refer to Appendix D  for further instruction on cases of increases in 
liver biochemistry and evaluation of HL .   
Colitis:  
Diarrhea, colitis, and enterocolitis are irAEs that have been reported with durvalumab.  In rare cases, colon perforation may occur that requires surgery (colectomy) or can lead to a fatal outcome if not properly managed.  Diarrhea / colitis in patients r eceiving durvalumab should 
be managed as per the guidelines for the management of diarrhea and enterocolitis (refer to 
Appendix H ). 
Pneumonitis:  
Adver se events of pneumonitis are also of interest for the Sponsor.  Initial work- up should 
include high- resolution CT scan, ruling out infection, and pulse oximetry.  Pulmonary 
consultation is highly recommended.  For guidelines for management of patients with 
pneumonitis refer to Appendix H . 
Hypersensitivity Reactions:  
Hypersensitivity reactions as well as infusion -related reactions have been reported with 
anti-PD-L1 and anti -PD-1 therapy ( Brahmer et al 2012 ).  As with the administration of any 
foreign protein and / or other biologic agents, reactions following the infusion of monoclonal 
antibodies can be caused by various m echanisms, including acute anaphylactic 
(immunoglobulin E -mediated) and anaphylactoid reactions against the monoclonal antibodies, 
and serum sickness.  Acute allergic reactions may occur, may be severe, and may result in death.  Acute allergic reactions may include hypotension, dyspnea, cyanosis, respiratory 
failure, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, hypotonia, urticaria, arthralgia, bronchospasm,

Adverse events of infusion reactions (also termed infusion- related reactions) are of special 
interest to the Sponsor and are defined, for the purpose of this protocol, as all AEs occurring 
from the start of the study treatment infusion up to 48 hours after t he infusion start time.  For 
all infusion reactions, the electronic CRF should be completed as instructed in Section  6.7, 
and all SAEs should be reported to MedImmune Patient Safety as described in Section 6.8.  For guidelines for management of patients with infusion- related reactions refer to 
Appendix H . 
Administration Site Reactions:  
Adverse events  of administration site reactions are of special interest to the Sponsor.  These 
are defined, for the purpose of this protocol, as all AEs occurring as a result of the 
administration of the study treatment (vaccine and / or EP).  Guidelines for the grading and management of administration site reactions are outlined in Appendix I .  
6.12.5 Unanticipated (serious) adverse device effect  
Unanticipated adverse device effect means any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, 
problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of patients.  
Per the defi nition above, an unanticipated adverse device effect is a type of SAE that requires 
expedited reporting on the part of the Sponsor.  As a reminder, all SAEs regardless of 
relationship to device, drug or procedure are to be reported to Sponsor by the study 
Investigator within 24 hours.  Sponsor will assess each device related SAE to determine if anticipated based on prior identification within the investigational plan.  
6.13 Study governance and oversight  
The safety of all MedImmune clinical studies is closely mon itored on an ongoing basis by 
MedImmune representatives in consultation with Patient Safety.  Issues identified will be addressed; for instance this could involve amendments to the study protocol and letters to investigators.

7.1.1 MEDI0457 
7.1.2
 Durvalumab  
Durvalumab (also known as MEDI4736) is a human IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody 
directed against human PD -L1.  Durvalumab selectively binds human PD-L1 with high 
affinity an d blocks its ability to bind to PD-1 and CD80.  The fragment crystallizable domain 
of durvalumab contains a triple mutation in the constant domain of the IgG1 heavy chain that reduces binding to the complement component C1q and the Fcγ receptors responsibl e for 
mediating antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity ( Oganesyan et al 2008).  
Durvalumab will be supplied by MedImmune or its designee as a 500 mg vial solution for infusion after dilution.  The solution contains 50 mg/mL durvalumab, 26 mM  histidine /

Date 17 March 2021 
112 (159) For the 1500 mg dose add 30 mL ( 750 m g dose add 15 mL) of durvalumab to the IV bag such 
that final concentration is within 1  mg/mL to 20 mg/mL.  Mix the bag by gentle inversion to 
ensure homogeneity of the dose in the bag.  Infusion solutions must be allowed to equilibrate 
to room temperature prior to commencement of administration.  
Dur
valumab  will be administered at room temperature by controlled infusion into a peripheral 
or central vein.  Following preparation of durvalumab, the entire contents of the IV bag should 
be administered as an IV infusion over approximately 60 minutes (±5 minutes), using a 0.2 or 
0.22- μm in -line filter.  Less than 55  minutes is considered a deviation. 
The IV line will be flushed with a volume of IV bag diluent equal to the priming volume of 
the infusion set used after the contents of the IV bag are fully administered, or complete the 
infusion according to institutional policy to ensure the full dose is administered and document if the line was not flushed. 
Standard infusion time is 1 hour.  However, if there are interruptions during infusion, the total 
allowed time should not exceed 8 hours at room temperature. 
In the event that either preparation time or infusion time exceeds the time limits, a new dose 
must be prepared from new vials.  Durvalumab
 does not contain preservatives, and any unused 
portion must be discarded.  
No incompatibilities between durvalumab  and polyvinylchloride or polyolefin IV bags have 
been observed. 
7.6 Investigational product inspection  
Each vial selected for dose preparation should be inspected. 
During the inspection, if the solution is not clear or any turbidity, discoloration, or particulates 
are observed, notify your site monitor and store the vial(s) in QUARANTINE at refrigerated 
temperature of the IP under the appropriate storage conditions for drug accountability and 
potential future inspection. 
If there are any defects noted with the IP, the Investigator and site monitor should be notified 
immediately.   
7.7 Compliance  
The administration of all study drugs (including IP) should be recorded in the appropriate sections of the CRF. 
Treatment compliance will be assured by site reconciliation of the medication dispensed and 
returned.

8.4.1 Primary endpoints  
The co -primary endpoints are the assessment of saf ety (including AEs, SAEs, laboratory 
evaluations, vital signs, ECG, performance status assessments, physical examinations and 
concomitant medications) and ORR by RECIST version 1.1. 
8.4.1.1 Adverse events  
Adverse event data will be summarized by the percentage of patients with AEs.  Adverse 
events (both in terms of MedDRA preferred terms and CTCAE grade) will be listed 
individually by patient.   
Any AE occurring before treatment with IP will be included in the data listings but will not be 
included in the summary tables of AEs.  Any AE occurring within 90 days of discontinuation 
of IP may be included in the AE summaries, but the majority of those summaries will omit those AEs observed after a patient has received further therapy for cancer.  Further details will 
be provided in the SAP.  Any events in this period that occur after a patient has received 
further therapy for cancer (following discontinuation of IP) will be flagged in the data listings. 
A separate data listing of AEs occurring more than 90 days after discontinuation of IP will be 
produced.  These events will not be included in AE summaries. 
8.4.1.2 Safety assessments 
For the change from baseline summaries for vital signs, laboratory data, ECGs, performance  
status, and physical examination, the baseline value will be the latest result obtained prior to 
the start of study treatment.  Concomitant medication data will be listed only.  
8.4.1.3 Investigator RECIST version 1.1- based assessments 
All RECIST assessments, whet her scheduled or unscheduled, will be included in the 
calculations.  This is also regardless of whether a patient discontinues study treatment or 
receives another anticancer therapy.  
At each visit, patients will be assigned a RECIST version  1.1 visit response of CR, PR, SD, or 
PD depending on the status of their disease compared with baseline and previous assessments 
by the Investigator.  Note: at the discretion of the Sponsor, an independent central review of 
all scans used in the assessment of tumors by RECIST version 1.1 and/or irRECIST may be conducted (refer to Section 5.3 for further details).  Baseline will be assessed within the 
28 days prior  to enrollment.  If a patient has had a tumor assessment that cannot be evaluated, 
then the patient will be assigned a visit response of not evaluable (unless there is evidence of 
progression in which case the response will be assigned as PD).  
Please refer  to Appendix F  for the definitions of CR, PR, SD, and PD.

120 ( 159) Objective Response Rate (ORR)  
Objective response rate is defined as the number (%) of patients with at least one visit 
response of CR or PR via RECIST 1.1 and will be based on the Response -evaluable 
Population for the co- primary endpoint.   
8.4.2 Secondary efficacy endpoints  
Objective Response Rate (ORR)  
Objective response rate will be assessed as a se condary endpoint in the As -treated Population 
using RECIST version 1.1.  Objective response rate will be also assessed in the Response -evaluable and As -treated populations using irRECIST ( Appendix G ). 
Progression Free Survival (PFS)  
Progression free survival measures progression by growth of the primary tumor, nodal spread metastases, death from the cancer, or death from other causes.  Progression free survival will be 
assessed by the periodic tumor assessment using imaging per the institutional guidelines at the schedules according to Table 3 . 
All study evaluations for disease response must be based on RECIST  version  1.1 ( Appendix F ). 
Progression free survival will be defined as the time from the date of start of IP treatment until 
the documentation of disease progression according to RECIST  version 1.1 or death due to 
any cause, whichever occurs first.  Patients who have not progressed or died at the time of the 
analysis will be censored at the time of the latest date of assessment from their last evaluable 
RECIST version  1.1 assessment.  However, if the patient progresses or dies after two or more 
missed visits, the patient will be cen sored at the time of the latest evaluable RECIST 
version 1.1 assessment prior to two missed visits.   
The PFS time will always be derived based on scan / assessment / death dates and not visit 
dates.  
RECIST version  1.1 assessment / scans contributing towards a particular visit may be 
performed on different dates.  The following rule will be applied:  
For investigator assessments, the date of progression will be determined based on the earliest of the RECIST version 1.1 assessment / scan dat es of the component that indicates 
progression.  
When censoring a patient for PFS, the patient will be censored at the latest of the dates contributing to a particular overall visit assessment.  
Note: For target lesions, only the latest scan date is recorded  out of all scans performed at that 
assessment for the target lesions, and similarly for non- target lesions, only the latest scan date 
is recorded out of all scans performed at that assessment for the non- target lesions.  
PFS will be assessed in the Respons e-evaluable and As -treated populations.

121 (159) Disease Control Rate (DCR)  
Disease control rate is defined as N (%) patients with CR, PR, or SD by 16 weeks on study 
using RECIST version 1.1.  For SD determination for DCR, the patient must have lack of 
progression for the first 16 weeks on study.  Disease control rate will be assessed in the 
Response- evaluable and As -treated populations.  
Overall Survival (OS)  
Overall survival is defined as the time from the date of start of IP treatment until death 
(+1 day) due to any cause.  Any patient not known to have died at the time of analysis will be 
censored based on the last recorded date on which the patient was known to be alive.  Overall 
survival will be assessed in the Response- evaluable and As -treated populations.  
8.4.2.1 Pharmacokinetics and antibodies for durvalumab   
The actual sampling times will be used in the pharmacokinetic calculations.  Durvalumab 
concentration data and summary statistics will be tabulated.  Individual and mean serum durvalumab concentration- time profiles will be generated.   
Immunogenicity results will be analyzed descriptively by summarizing the number and percentage of patients who develop detectable ADA for durvalumab.  The immunogenicity titer will be reported for samples confirmed positive for the presence of ADA.

Pharmacokinetic concentration data and summary statistics will be tabulated.  Individual and 
mean blood concentration-time profiles will be generated.  Due to the sparse pharmacokinetic 
sampling used in this study, formal non- compartmental analysis to derive pharmacokinetic 
parameters (e.g., terminal half-life) will not be conducted.  A population pharmacokinetic 
model may be developed with similar data from other studies to further characterize the 
pharmacokinetic properties of durvalumab when administered in combination with 
MEDI0457. 
8.5.2.2 Anti -drug antibody analysis  
Immunogenicity results will be analyzed descriptively by summarizing the number and 
percentage of patients who develop detectable ADA for durvalumab.  The immunogenicity 
titers will be repor ted for samples confirmed positive for the presence of ADA.  The effect of 
immunogenicity on pharmacokinetic and its potential association with efficacy, safety and / or tolerability will be performed, if the data allow.  
8.5.2.3 Anti -tumor analysis – objective res ponse rate, disease control rate at 16 weeks,

9.1 Training of study site personnel  
Before the first patient is entered into the study, it is necessary for a representative of PRA to 
visit the investigational study site to:  
• Determine the adequacy of t he facilities  
• Determine availability of appropriate patients for the study  
• Discuss with the investigator(s) (and other personnel involved with the study) their responsibilities with regard to protocol adherence, and the responsibilities of 
MedImmune or its  representatives.  This will be documented in the Clinical Study 
Agreement between PRA and the Investigator.  
Site personnel will be required to complete Electronic Data Capture training before the first 
patient is entered into the study. 
Before the first p atient is entered into the study, a PRA representative will review and discuss 
the requirements of the Clinical Study Protocol and related documents with the investigational staff and also train them in any study specific procedures, and the WBDC system(s)  utilized.  
The Principal Investigator will ensure that appropriate training relevant to the study is given to all of these staff, and that any new information relevant to the performance of this study is forwarded to the staff involved. 
The Principal Inves tigator will maintain a record of all individuals involved in the study 
(medical, nursing and other staff).  
9.2 Monitoring of the study  
PRA will perform the monitoring of the study. During the study, a PRA representative will have regular contacts with the study site, 
including visits to:  
• Provide information and support to the investigator(s)  
• Confirm that facilities remain acceptable  
• Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the protocol, that data are being accurately and timely recorded in the CRFs, that biological samples are handled in accordance with the Laboratory Manual and that study drug accountability checks are being performed

Date 17 March 2021 
125 ( 159) • Perform source data verification (a comparison of the data in the CRFs with the 
patient’s medical records at th e hospital or practice, and other records relevant to 
the study) including verification of informed consent of participating patients.  This will require direct access to all original records for each patient (e.g., clinic charts)  
• Ensure withdrawal of informed consent to the use of the patient’s biological samples is reported and biological samples are identified and disposed of / destroyed accordingly, and the action is documented, and reported to the patient. 
The PRA representative will be available between visits if the investigator(s) or other staff at the center needs information and advice about the study conduct. 
9.2.1 Source data  
Refer to the Clinical Study Agreement for location of source data.  
9.2.2 Study agreements  
The Principal Investigator at each / the cen ter should comply with all the terms, conditions, 
and obligations of the Clinical Study Agreement, or equivalent, for this study.  In the event of 
any inconsistency between this Clinical Study Protocol and the Clinical Study Agreement, the 
terms of Clinica l Study Protocol shall prevail with respect to the conduct of the study and the 
treatment of patients and in all other respects, not relating to study conduct or treatment of patients, the terms of the Clinical Study Agreement shall prevail.  
Agreements bet ween MedImmune and the Principal Investigator should be in place before any 
study- related procedures can take place, or patients are enrolled.  
9.2.3 Archiving of study documents  
The Investigator follows the principles outlined in the Clinical Study Agreement. 
9.2.4 Deviation from the clinical study protocol  
The investigator(s) must not deviate from or make any changes to the protocol without 
documented agreement between the Principal Investigator and MedImmune or the 
Institutional Review Board ( IRB) approval based on its deliberations.   However, this shall not 
apply to cases where the deviation or change is necessary to avoid an immediate hazard to the 
patients or for other compelling medical reasons, or where the changes involve only logistical 
or administrative aspec ts of the clinical study (e.g.,  changes to the organization / structure of 
the MedImmune, the name / department name of the study site, the address or phone number 
of the  study site  or MedImmune, the job title of the investigator, and monitors).  
The inves tigator(s) should document any deviation from the protocol regardless of their 
reasons.   Only when the protocol was not followed in order to avoid an immediate hazard to 
the patients or for other medically compelling reason, the Investigator should prepare  and 
submit the records explaining the reasons thereof to MedImmune and the head of study site, and retain a copy of the records.  
Clinical Study Protocol  
Drug Substance MEDI0457+Durvalumab  
Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
126 ( 159) The investigator(s) may deviate from or make a change to the protocol without documented 
agreement between the Principal Investigator and MedImmune or the IRB approval, only in the event of a medical emergency, e.g., it is only way to avoid an immediate hazard to the 
patients.   In such case, the Principal Investigator must notify details of the deviation or 
change, the reason, a nd a proposed revision in the protocol if required, to MedImmune and the 
head of the study site and IRB via the head of the study site as soon as possible, in order to obtain their approval.  A certificate of approval by the head of the study site as well as 
MedImmune should be obtained via the head of the study site. 
9.3 Study timetable and end of study  
The end of the study is defined as ‘the last visit of the last patient undergoing the study’. 
The study started in Quarter 4 2016 and is expected to end by Qua rter 4 2019. 
The study may be terminated at individual centers if the study procedures are not being 
performed according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP), or if recruitment is slow.  MedImmune may also terminate the entire study prematurely if concerns for safety arise within this study or in any other study with MEDI0457 and durvalumab. 
9.4 Data management  
Data management will be performed by PRA Data Management Center staff according to the Data Management Plan.  
Data will be entered in the WBDC system at the study site.  Trained study staff will be responsible for entering data on the observations, tests and assessments specified in the protocol into the WBDC system and according to the CRF instructions.  The CRF instructions 
will also guide the study site in performing data entry.  Data entered in the WBDC system will 
be immediately saved to a central database and changes tracked to provide an audit trail.  The data will then be Source Data Verified, reviewed / queried and updated as needed.  The data will be validated as defined in the Data Management Plan.  
Data queries will be raised for inconsistent, impossible or missing data.  All entries to the study database will be available in an audit trail.  Quality control procedures will be applied to 
each stage of  data handling to ensure that all data are reliable and have been processed 
correctly.  
Adverse events and medical / surgical history will be classified according to the terminology of the latest version of the MedDRA and the WHO Drug Reference Dictionary.  Medications 
will be classified according to the WHO Reference Drug Dictionary.  All coding will be performed by the Medical Coding Team at PRA.  Note: the most current version of WHO 
Drug Reference Dictionary will be used.  Laboratory data will be coded using NCI CTCAE 
version 4.03. 
Relevant pain scale forms will be filled in by the patients or study staff according to 
age-appropriate guidelines within this protocol.

128 ( 159) Before enrollment of any patient into the study, the final study protocol, including the final 
version of the ICF, is approved by the national regulatory authority or a notification to the 
national regulatory authority is done, according to local regulations.  
PRA will handle the distribution of any of these documents to the national Regulatory Authorities.  
PRA will provide Regulatory Authorities, ECs and Principal Investigators with safety updates / reports according to local requirements. 
Each Principal Inves tigator is responsible for providing the ECs / IRB with reports of any 
serious and unexpected adverse drug reactions from any other study conducted with the IP.  
PRA will provide this information to the Principal Investigator so that he / she can meet thes e 
reporting requirements.  
10.4 Informed consent  
The Principal Investigator(s) at each center  will: 
• Ensure each patient is given full and adequate oral and written information about 
the nature, purpose, possible risk and benefit of the study. 
• Ensure each patient is notified that they are free to discontinue from the study at any time.  
• Ensure that each patient is given the opportunity to ask questions and allowed time to consider the information provided.  
• Ensure each patient provides signed and dated inform ed consent before conducting 
any procedure specifically for the study.  
• Ensure the original, signed ICF(s) is / are stored in the Investigator’s Study File.

135 ( 159) Appendix A Additional Safety Information  
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
Life-threatening  
‘Life -threatening’ means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the adverse 
event (AE) as it occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would 
result in the patient’s death.  ‘Life -threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a 
more severe form it might have caused death (e.g., hepatitis that resolved without hepatic 
failure).  
Hospitalization  
Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons for it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal edema).  Hospital admissions and / or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease 
existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an unexpected way during the study. 
Important medical event or medical intervention  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in situations where important medical events may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death, hospitalization, disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the patient or may require medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the def inition of serious.  
These should usually be considered as serious.  
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical judgment must be used. 
• Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring IV hydrocortisone treatment  
• Hepatotoxicity caused by acetaminophen overdose requiring treatment with N-acetylcysteine  
• Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm  
• Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anemia requiring blood transfusion, etc) or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization  
• Development of drug dependency or drug abuse

Date 17 March 2021 
136 ( 159) A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question  
When making an assessment of causality consider t he following factors when deciding if there 
is a ‘ reasonable possibility’  that an AE may have been caused by the drug.  
• Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the patient actually received the 
suspect drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of the suspect drug?  
• Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from it s pharmacological 
properties?  
• De-challenge experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing 
the dose of the suspect drug?  
• No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another etiology such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors. 
• Re-challenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was 
reintroduced after having been stopped? MedImmune would not normally recommend or support a re-challenge.  
• Laboratory tests.  A specific la boratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed 
the relationship . 
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:  
• Is this a recognized  feature of overdose of the drug?  
• Is there a known mechanism? 
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a ‘reasonable possibility’  of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expression 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a  causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evi dence) or arguments  to suggest a causal relationship. 
The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment.  With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.  
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility.

Labeling and shipment of biohazard samples  
International Airline Transportation Association (IATA) classifies biohazardous agents into 
three categories.  For transport purposes the classification of infectious substances according to Risk Groups was removed from the Dangerous Goods Regulations in the 46
th edition 
(2005).  Infectious substances are now classified either as Category A, Category B or Exempt.  There is no direct relationship between Risk Groups and categories A and B. 
Category A  Infectious Substances  are infectious substances in a form that, when exposure to 
it occurs, is capable of causing permanent disability, life -threatening or fatal disease in 
otherwise healt hy humans or animals.  Category A pathogens are e.g., Ebola, Lassa fever 
virus:  
• Are to be packed and shipped in accordance with IATA Instruction 602. 
Category B Infectious Substances  are infectious Substances that do not meet the criteria for 
inclusion in Category A.  Category B pathogens are e.g., Hepatitis A, B, C, D, and E viruses, 
Human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2.  They are assigned the following UN number and proper shipping name:  
• UN 3373 – Biological Substance, Category B  
• Are to be packed in accordance with UN3373 and IATA 650  
Exempt -  all other materials with minimal risk of containing pathogens  
• Clinical trial samples will fall into Category B or exempt under IATA regulations.  
• Clinical trial samples will routinely be packed and transported a t ambient 
temperature in IATA 650 compliant packaging.  
• Biological samples transported in dry ice require additional dangerous goods 
specification for the dry ice content.  
• IATA compliant courier and packaging materials should be used for packing and transp ortation and packing should be done by an IATA certified person, as 
applicable.  
• Samples routinely transported by road or rail are subject to local regulations which 
require that they are also packed and transported in a safe and appropriate way to 
contain any risk of infection or contamination by using approved couriers and 
packaging / containment materials at all times.  The IATA 650 biological sample

139 ( 159) Appendix C Pharmacogenetics Research  
Background and Rationale  
MedImmune intends to perform genetic research in the MEDI0457 and durvalumab clinical 
development programme to explore how genetic variations may affect the clinical parameters associated with MEDI0457 and durvalumab.  Collection of DNA samples from populations 
with well described clinical characteristics may lead to improvements in the design and interpretation of clinical trials and, possibly, to genetically guided treatment strategies.  
Future research may suggest other genes or gene categories as candidates for influencing not 
only response to MEDI0457 and durvalumab but also susceptibility to recurrent / metastatic 
head and neck cancer associated with HPV -16 and / or HPV -18 for w hich MEDI0457 and 
durvalumab may be evaluated.  Thus, this genetic research may involve study of additional 
un-named genes or gene categories, but only as related to disease susceptibility and drug 
action.  
Genetic Research Objectives  
The objective of this research is to collect and store DNA for future exploratory research into 
genes / genetic variation that may influence response (i.e., distribution, safety, tolerability and 
efficacy) to recurrent / metastatic head and neck cancer associated with HPV -16 and / or 
HPV- 18.  
Genetic Research Plan and Procedures  
Selection of genetic research population  
Study selection record  
All patients will be asked to participate in this genetic research.  Participation is voluntary and if a patient declines to participate there will be no penalty or loss of benefit.  The patient will not be excluded from any aspect of the main study. 
Inclusion criteria  
For inclusion in this genetic research, patients must fulfill all of the inclusion criteria 
describ ed in the main body of the 
Clinical Study Protocol  and: 
• Provide informed consent for the genetic sampling and analyses.  
Clinical Study Pr otocol Appendix C

Date 17 March 2021 
140 ( 159) Exclusion criteria  
Exclusion from this genetic research may be for any of the exclusion criteria specified in the 
main study or any of t he following:  
• Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant  
• Non-leukocyte depleted whole blood transfusion in 120 days of genetic sample 
collection  
Discontinuation of patients from this genetic research  
Specific reasons for discontinuing a patient from this genetic research are:  
Withdrawal of consent for genetic research:  Patients may withdraw from this genetic research at any time, independent of any decision concerning participation in other aspects of the main study.  Voluntary discontinuation will not pre judice further treatment.  Procedures for 
discontinuation are outlined in Section 3.9 of the main 
Clinical Study Protocol . 
Collection of samples for genetic research  
The blood sample for genetic research will be obtained from the patients at Week  1, Week  8, 
Week 10 and Week  16 (Table 3).  Although genotype is a stable parameter, early sample 
collection is preferred to avoid introducing bias through excluding patients who may withdraw 
due to an adverse event (AE), such patients would be important to include in any genetic 
analysis.  If for any reaso n the sample is not drawn at a scheduled visit at Week  1, Week  8, 
Week 10 and Week  16, it may be taken at any visit until the last study visit.  Samples will be 
collected, labeled, stored and shipped as detailed in the Laboratory Manual.  
Coding and storage  of DNA samples  
The processes adopted for the coding and storage of samples for genetic analysis are 
important to maintain patient confidentiality.  Samples will be stored for a maximum of 
25 years, from the date of last patient last visit, after which the y will be destroyed.  DNA is a 
finite resource that is used up during analyses.  Samples will be stored and used until no 
further analyses are possible or the maximum storage time has been reached. 
For all samples irrespective of the type of coding used the DNA will be extracted from the 
blood sample.  The DNA sample will be assigned a unique number replacing the information 
on the sample tube.  Thereafter, the DNA sample will be identifiable by the unique DNA 
number only.  The DNA number is used to identif y the sample and corresponding data at the 
MedImmune genetics laboratories, or at the designated contract laboratory.  No personal 
details identifying the individual will be available to any person (MedImmune employee or 
contract laboratory staff working w ith the DNA.)  
The samples and data for genetic analysis in this study will be single coded.  The link between 
the patient enrollment code and the DNA number will be maintained and stored in a secure 
environment, with restricted access within the Clinical G enotyping Group Laboratory

consent. 
Ethical and Regulatory Requirements  
The principles for ethical and regulatory requirements for the study, including this genetics 
research component, are outlined in Section 10 of the main Clinical Study Protocol. 
Informed consent  
All patients must sign the informed consent prior to any study- related procedures being 
performed.   
Patient data p rotection  
MedImmune will not provide individual genotype results to patients, any insurance company, 
any employer, their family members, general physician or any other third party, unless 
required to do so by law.  
Extra precautions are taken to preserve confidentiality and prevent genetic data being linked to 
the identity of the patient.  In exceptional circumstances, however, certain individuals might 
see both the genetic data and the personal identifiers of a patient.  For example, in the case of a medical emergency, a MedImmune Physician or an Investigator might know a patient’s 
identity and also have access to his or her genetic data.  Also Regulatory Authorities may 
require access to the relevant files, though the patient’s medical information and the genetic files would remain physically separate.  
Data management  
Any genotype data generated in this study will be stored in the MedImmune genotyping LIMS database, or other appropriate secure system within MedImmune and / or third party contracted to work with MedImmune to analyze the samples.  
The results from this genetic research may be reported in the Clinical Study Report for the main study, or in a separate report as appropriate.  
Genotype data will be transferred to the clinical data base, and merged with the clinical data 
from the main study, prior to the statistical analysis and reporting of the study.  
Statistical methods and determination of sample size  
The number of patients that will agree to participate in the genetic research is unknown.  It is 
therefore not possible to establish whether sufficient data will be collected to allow a formal 
statistical evaluation or whether only descriptive statistics will be generated.  A SAP will be 
prepared where appropriate.

142 ( 159) Appendix D Actions Required in Cases of Increases in Liver 
Biochemistry and Evaluation of Hy’s Law 
Introduction 
During the course of the study the Investigator will remain vigilant for increases in liver 
biochemistry.  The Investigator is respons ible for determining whether a patient meets 
potential Hy’s Law (PHL) criteria at any point during the study. 
The Investigator participates, together with MedImmune clinical project representatives, in 
review and assessment of cases meeting PHL criteria to  agree whether Hy’s Law (HL) criteria 
are met.  Hy’s Law criteria are met if there is no alternative explanation for the elevations in 
liver biochemistry other than Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) caused by the Investigational Product (IP).  
The Investiga tor is responsible for recording data pertaining to PHL / HL cases and for 
reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) according to the outcome of the review and assessment in line with standard safety reporting processes. 
Definitions  
Potential Hy’s Law  
A PHL case is defined as a study patient with an increase in serum aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≥ 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) together with  
total bilirubin (TBL) ≥ 2 x ULN, irrespective of an inc rease in alkaline phosphatase (ALP),  at 
any point during the study following the start of study medication.  
Hy’s Law  
A HL case is defined as a study patient with an increase in serum AST or ALT ≥  3 x ULN 
together with TBL ≥ 2 x ULN, where no other reason, other than the IP, can be found to 
explain the combination of increases, e.g., elevated ALP indicating cholestasis, viral hepatitis, another drug.   
For PHL and HL, the elevation in transaminases must precede or be coi ncident with (i.e., on 
the same day) the elevation in TBL, but there is no specified timeframe within which the elevations in transaminases and TBL must occur.

143 ( 159) Identification of Potential Hy’s Law Cases  
In order to identify cases of PHL, it is important to perform a comprehensive review of 
laboratory data for any patient who meets any of the following identification criteria in isolation or in combination:  
• ALT ≥ 3 x ULN  
• AST ≥ 3 x ULN  
• TBL ≥ 2 x ULN  
When a patient meets any of the identification criteria, in isolation or in combination, the 
central laboratory will immediately send an alert to the Investigator (also sent to MedImmune 
representative).  
The Investigator will also remain vigilant for any local laboratory reports where the identificatio n criteria are met, where this is the case the Investigator will:  
• Notify the MedImmune representative.  
• Request a repeat of the test (new blood draw) by the central laboratory.  
• Complete the appropriate unscheduled laboratory CRF module(s) with the original local laboratory test result.  
When the identification criteria are met from central or local laboratory results the Investigator will without delay: 
• Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Definitions  within this 
Appendix for definition) by reviewing laboratory reports from all previous visits 
(including both central and local laboratory results).Definitions within this 
Appendix for defini tion) by reviewing laboratory reports from all previous visits 
(including both central and local laboratory results). 
The Investigator will without delay review each new laboratory report and if the identification criteria are met will:  
• Notify the MedImmun e representative.  
• Determine whether the patient meets PHL criteria (see Definitions  within this 
Appendix for definition) by reviewing laboratory reports from all previous visits.  Definitions within this Appendix for definition) by reviewing laboratory reports from all previous visits.  
• Promptly enter the laboratory data into the laboratory CRF.

144 ( 159) Follow -up 
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria not Met  
If the patient does not meet PHL criteria the Investigator will: 
• Perform follow -up on subsequent laboratory results according to the guidance 
provided in the Clinical Study Protocol.  
Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met  
If the patient does meet PHL criteria the Investigator will: 
• Determine whether PHL criteria were met at any study visit prior to starting study 
treatment (See Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Crite ria are Met Before 
and After Starting Study Treatment ). 
• Notify the MedImmune representative who will then inform the central Study 
Team.  
The Study Physician contacts the investigator, to provide guidance, discuss and agree an 
approach for the study patients’ follow -up and the continuous review of data.  Subsequent to 
this contact the Investigator will:  
• Monitor the patient until liver biochemistry parameters and appropriate  clinical 
symptoms and signs return to normal or baseline levels, or as long as medically indicated.  
• Investigate the etiology of the event and perform diagnostic investigations as discussed with the Study Physician.  
• Complete the three Liver CRF Modules a s information becomes available.  
• If at any time (in consultation with the Study Physician) the PHL case meets serious criteria, report it as an SAE using standard reporting procedures.  
Review and Assessment of Potential Hy’s Law Cases  
The instructions in t his Section should be followed for all cases where PHL criteria are met.  
No later than 3 weeks after the biochemistry abnormality was initially detected, the Study 
Physician  contacts the Investigator in order to review available data and agree on whether 
there is an alternative explanation for meeting PHL criteria other than DILI caused by the IP.  
The MedImmune  Medical Science Director and Global Safety Physician will also be involved 
in this review together with other patient matter experts as appropriate .

145 ( 159) According to the outcome of the review and assessment, the Investigator will follow the 
instructions below. 
If there is an agreed alternative explanation for the ALT or AST and TBL elevations, a 
determination of whether the alternative explanation is a n AE will be made and subsequently 
whether the AE meets the criteria for an SAE:  
• If the alternative explanation is not  an AE, record the alternative explanation on the 
appropriate CRF.  
• If the alternative explanation is an AE / SAE, record the AE / SAE in the CRF 
accordingly and follow the AZ standard processes. 
If it is agreed that there is no explanation that would explain the ALT or AST and TBL elevations other than the IP:  
• Report an SAE (report term ‘Hy’s Law’) according to MedImmune standard processes.  
− The ‘Medically Important’ serious criterion should be used if no other serious criteria apply.  
− As there is no alternative explanation for the HL case, a causality assessment  of 
‘related’ should be assigned. 
If, there is an unavoidable delay, of over 3 weeks, in obtaining the information necessary to assess whether or not the case meets the criteria for HL, then it is assumed that there is no alternative explanation until such time as an informed decision can be made:  
• Report an SAE (report term ‘Potential Hy’s Law’) applying serious criteria and causality assessment as per above.  
• Continue follow -up and review according to agreed plan.  Once the necessary 
supplementary informati on is obtained, repeat the review and assessment to 
determine whether HL criteria are met.  Update the SAE report according to the outcome of the review.  
Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and After Starting Study Treatment  
This section is applicable to patients with liver metastases who meet PHL criteria on study 
treatment having previously met PHL criteria at a study visit prior to starting study treatment.  
At the first on study treatment occurrence of PHL criteria being met  the Investigator will:

# A ‘significant’ change in the patient’s condition refers to a clinically relevant change in any 
of the individual liver biochemistry parameters (ALT, AST or TBL) in isolation or in 
combination, or a clinically relevant change in associated symptoms.  The determination of 
whether there has been a significant change will be at the discretion of the investigator, this may be in consultation with the Study Physician if there is any uncertainty.  
Actions Required for Repeat Episodes of Potential  Hy’s Law  
This section is applicable when a patient meets PHL criteria on study treatment and has already met PHL criteria at a previous on study treatment visit.  
The requirement to conduct follow -up, review and assessment of a repeat occurrence(s) of 
PHL is based on the nature of the alternative cause identified for the previous occurrence.   
The Investigator should determine the cause for the previous occurrence o f PHL criteria being 
met and answer the following question:  
• Was the alternative cause for the previous occurrence of PHL criteria being met found to be the disease under study e.g., chronic or progressing malignant disease, severe infection or liver diseas e, or did the patient meet PHL criteria prior to 
starting study treatment and at their first on study treatment visit as described in Actions Required When Potential Hy’s Law Criteria are Met Before and After Starting Study Treatment ?  
If No: follow the process described in Potential Hy’s Law Criteria Met of this Appendix

149 ( 159) Appendix F Guidelines for Evaluation of Objective Tumor Response 
using RECIST version 1.1 Criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors)  
DEFINITION OF MEASURABLE, NON- MEASURABLE, TARGET AND NON-
TARGET LESIONS  
Only patients with measurable disease at baseline should be included in the study.  
Measurable disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable lesion (by RECIST version 1.1) lesion which has not been previously irradiated.  A tumor lesion in a pre viously 
irradiated field can be assessed as measurable disease provided the lesion has been deemed to demonstrate progression. 
Measurable disease  
Measurable lesions are defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension (longest dia meter [LD] to be recorded) as ≥  20 mm with conventional techniques 
(computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], x -ray) or as ≥  10 mm with 
spiral CT scan.  All tumor measurements must be recorded in millimeters (or decimal 
fractions of centi meters).  
Non-measurable lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (LD <  20 mm with conventional 
techniques or <  10 mm using spiral CT scan), are considered non- measurable disease.  B one 
lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural / pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis cutis / pulmonis, inflammatory breast disease, abdominal masses (not followed by CT or MRI) and cystic lesions are all non- measurable.  
Target lesions  
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions  and recorded and 
measured at baseline.  Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the LD) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging techniques or clinically).  A sum of the LD for all target lesions  will be calculated and 
reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as reference by whi ch to 
characterize the objective tumor.  
Non-target lesions  
All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be identified as non -target lesions  and should 
also be recorded at baseline.  Non- target lesions include measurable lesions that exceed the 
maximum nu mber per organ or total of all involved organs as well as non- measurable lesions.  
Measurements of these lesions are not required but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow -up.

Date 17 March 2021 
150 ( 159) Guidelines for Evaluation of Measurable Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers.  
All baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment . 
Note: Tumor lesions that are situated in a previously irradiate area might or might not be considered measurable.  Lesions progressing after previous irradiation are measurable; lesions not progressing after previous irradiation are not measurable.  
The s ame method of assessment and the same technique should be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up.  Imaging- based evaluation is 
preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have been us ed to assess 
the anti -tumor effect of treatment.  
Clinical lesions   Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial 
(e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes).  In the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion, is recommended.  
Chest x -ray  Lesions on chest x- ray are acceptable as measurable lesions when they are clearly 
defined and surrounded by aerated lung.  However, CT is preferable.  
Conventional CT and MRI   These techniques should be performed with cuts of 10 mm or le ss 
in slice thickness contiguously.  Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm contiguous 
reconstruction algorithm.  This applies to tumors of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Head and 
neck tumors and those of extremities usually required specific protocols.  
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) -CT  At present, the low dose or attenuation correction 
CT portion of a combined PET -CT is not always of optimal diagnostic CT quality for use with 
RECIST measurements.  However, if the site can document that the CT performed as part of a PET- CT is of identical diagnostic quality to a diagnostic CT (with intravenous and oral 
contrast), then the CT portion of the PET -CT can be used for RECIST measurements and can 
be used interchangeably with conventional CT in accuratel y measuring cancer lesions over 
time.  Note, however, that the PET portion of the CT introduces additional data which may bias an Investigator if it is not routinely or serially performed.   
Ultrasound  Ultrasound is not useful in assessment of lesion size  and should not be used as a 
method of measurement.  Ultrasound examinations cannot be reproduced in their entirety for 
independent review at a later date and, because they are operator dependent, it cannot be 
guaranteed that the same technique and measure ments will be taken from one assessment to 
the next.  If new lesions are identified by ultrasound in the course of the study, confirmation 
by CT or MRI is advised.  If there is concern about radiation exposure at CT, MRI may be 
used instead of CT in select ed instances.  
Endoscopy, Laparoscopy  The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is 
not advised.  However, such techniques may be useful to confirm complete pathological

151 ( 159) response when biopsies are obtained or to determine relapse in trials where recurrence 
following complete response (CR) or surgical resection is an endpoint. 
Tumor markers  Tumor markers alone cannot be used to assess response.  If markers are 
initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.  Specific guidelines for both CA -125 response (in recurrent 
ovarian cancer) and prostrate -specific antigen response (in recurrent prostate cancer) have 
been published [ JNCI  96:487- 488, 2004; J Clin Oncol  17, 3461- 3467, 1999; J Clin Oncol  
26:1148- 1159, 2008].  In addition, the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup has developed CA -125 
progression criteria which are to be integrated with objective tumor assessment for use in first-line trials in ovarian cancer [ JNCI  92:1534- 1535, 2000]. 
Cytology, Histology  These techniques can be used to differentiate between partial responses 
(PR) and CR in rare cases (e.g., residual lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual benign tumors can remain).  
The cy tological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that appears or worsens 
during treatment when the measurable tumor has met criteria for response or SD is mandatory 
to differentiate between response or SD (an effusion may be a side effect of  the treatment) and 
progressive disease (PD).  
Fludeoxyglucose  (FDG) -PET  While FDG -PET response assessments need additional study, it 
is sometimes reasonable to incorporate the use of FDG -PET scanning to complement CT 
scanning in assessment of progression (particularly possible 'new' disease).  New lesions on 
the basis of FDG -PET imaging can be identified according to the following algorithm:  
• Negative FDG -PET at baseline, with a positive FDG -PET at follow -up is a sign of 
PD based on a new lesion. 
• No FDG -PET at baseline and a positive FDG -PET at follow -up:  If the positive 
FDG -PET at follow -up corresponds to a new site of disease confirmed by CT, this 
is PD.  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up is not confirmed as a new site of 
disease on CT, additional follow -up CT scans are needed to determine if there is 
truly progression occurring at that site (if so, the date of PD will be the date of the initial abnormal FDG -PET scan).  If the positive FDG -PET at follow -up 
corresponds to a pre -existing site of di sease on CT that is not progressing on the 
basis of the anatomic images, this is not PD.  
• FDG -PET may be used to upgrade a response to a CR in a manner similar to a 
biopsy in cases where a residual radiographic abnormality is thought to represent fibrosis o r scarring.  The use of FDG -PET in this circumstance should be 
prospectively described in the protocol and supported by disease -specific medical 
literature for the indication.  However, it must be acknowledged that both approaches may lead to false positiv e CR due to limitations of FDG -PET and 
biopsy resolution / sensitivity.

Response Criteri a 
Evaluation of target lesions  
CR: Disappearance of all target lesions  
PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum LD  
PD: At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking 
as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment 
started or the appearance of one or more new lesions  
SD: Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient inc rease 
to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started  
 
Evaluation of non -target lesions  
CR: Disappearance of all non -target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level  
Incomplete Response 
/ SD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s) or / and maintenance 
of tumor marker level above the normal limits  
PD: Appearance of one or more new lesions and / or unequivocal 
progression of existing non- target lesions  
 
Although a clear progression of “non- target” lesions only is exceptional, in such 
circumstances, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail and the progression status should be confirmed later on by the review panel (or study chair).  
Note: If tumor markers are obtained and are initially above the upper normal limit, they must normalize for a patient to be considered in complete clinical response.

153 ( 159) Evaluation of best overall response  
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the s tart of the treatment until 
disease progression / recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements 
recorded since the treatment started).  The patient's best response assignment will depend on 
the achievement of both measurement and confirm ation criteria.

Any Any Yes PD 
 
Note: Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having “symptomatic deterioration”.  Every effort should be made to document the objective progression even after discontinuation of treatment. 
In some circumstances, it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue.  
When the evaluation of CR depends on this determination, it is recommended that the residual lesion be inves tigated (fine needle aspirate / biopsy) to confirm the CR status. 
Confirmation  
The main goal of confirmation of objective response is to avoid overestimating the response 
rate observed.  In cases where confirmation of response is not feasible, it should be made clear 
when reporting the outcome of such studies that the responses are not confirmed. 
To be assigned a status of PR or CR, changes in tumor measurements must be confirmed by 
repeat assessments that should be performed no less than 4 weeks after the criteria for 
response are first met.  Longer intervals as determined by the study protocol ma y also be 
appropriate.

Study Code D8860C00005  
Version 8.0 
Date 17 March 2021 
154 ( 159) In the case of SD, follow -up measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after 
study entry at a minimum interval (in general, not less than 6- 8 weeks) that is defined in the 
study protocol  
Duration of overall response  
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for 
CR or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or PD is 
objectively documented, taking as reference for PD the smallest measurem ents recorded since 
the treatment started.  
Duration of stable disease  
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease 
progression are met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
The clinical relevance of the duration of SD varies for different tumor types and grades.  Therefore, it is highly recommended that the protocol specify the minimal time interval required between two measurements for determination of SD.  This ti me interval should take 
into account the expected clinical benefit that such a status may bring to the population under 
study.  
Response review  
For trials where the response rate is the primary endpoint it is strongly recommended that all 
responses be revi ewed by an expert(s) independent of the study at the study’s completion.  
Simultaneous review of the patients’ files and radiological images is the best approach.  
Reporting of results  
All patients included in the study must be assessed for response to tre atment, even if there are 
major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible.  Each patient will be assigned one 
of the following categories: 1) CR, 2) PR, 3) SD, 4) PD, 5) early death from malignant 
disease, 6) early death from toxicity, 7) ear ly death because of other cause, or 9) unknown (not 
assessable, insufficient data).  
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria should be included in the main analysis of the response rate.  Patients in response categories 4 -9 should be considered  as failing to 
respond to treatment (disease progression).  Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug 
administration does not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response rate.  Precise 
definitions for categories 4- 9 will be protocol specific. 
All conclusions should be based on all eligible patients. 
Subanalyses may then be performed on the basis of a subset of patients, excluding those for 
whom major protocol deviations have been identified (e.g., early death due to other reasons,

subanalyses may not serve as the basis for drawing conclusions concerning treatment efficacy, 
and the reasons for excluding patients from the analysis should be clearly reported.

a Common Language for Tumor Response to Immunotherapy: Immune -Related Response 
Criteria Using Unidimensional Measurements.  Clin Cancer Res; 19(14) July 15, 2013 
For the immune -response response criteria (irRC), only index and measurable new lesions are 
taken into account (in contrast to conventional World Health Organization [ WHO] criteria, 
which do not require the measurement of new lesions, nor do they include new lesion 
measurements in the characterization of evolving tumor burden).  
The longest diamet er of each target lesion will be recorded.  Measurable lesions will be 
defined as ≥  10 mm in the longest diameter as in RECIST as opposed to ≥5 x 5 mm2 in WHO / 
irRC.   
For unidimensional measurements, the cut -off values by RECIST (≥  20% increase from the 
nadir for progression, ≥  30% decrease from baseline for partial response, and disappearance of 
lesions for complete remission) will be used.

157 ( 159) Appendix  H Durvalumab Dose Modification for Toxicity Management   
Guidelines for the management of immune -mediated reactions, infusion- related reactions, and 
non-immune -mediated reactions for durvalumab monotherapy are provided in the Dosing 
Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines. The most current version of t hese 
guidelines is an annex to this protocol and is also maintained within the Site Master File.  
Patients should be thoroughly evaluated, and appropriate efforts should be made to rule out 
neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin, or other etiologic cause s of the immune -mediated AE. 
Serologic, immunologic, and histologic (biopsy) data, as appropriate, should be used to support an immune -mediated AE diagnosis. In the absence of a clear alternative etiology, 
events should be considered potentially immune rel ated.  
In addition, there are certain circumstances in which durvalumab should be permanently discontinued (see Section 6.12.1 of this protocol and the Dosing Modifica tion and Toxicity 
Management Guidelines).  
Following the first dose of durvalumab subsequent administration of durvalumab can be modified based on toxicities observed as described in the Dosing Modification and Toxicity Management Guidelines. These guidelines have been prepared by the Sponsor to assist the 
Investigator in the exercise of his/her clinical judgment in treating these types of toxicities. 
These guidelines apply to AEs considered causally related to durvalumab monotherapy regimen by the reporting Investigator.  
Dose reductions are not permitted. In case of doubt, the Investigator should consult with the Study Physician.

Any Grade  For any grade:  
Per guidance below  For any grade:  
• Manage per institutional standard at the discretion 
of investigator.  
• Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of 
administration site reactions.  
• Educate patients on infection control.  
Grade 1  For Grade 1:  
No changes i n dose or schedule are recommended  For Grade 1:  
• Consider symptomatic treatment with over -the-
counter analgesics and supportive care (i.e., cold 
compress)  
Grade 2  For Grade 2:  
If persistent injection site reaction lasting more than 10 days despite optimal management, MEDI0457 next dose of vaccine shou ld be omitted.  
Durvalumab to continue dependent on discussion of Investigator with medial monitor.  
For second occurrence of Grade 2:  
In the setting of second occurrence of persistent ≥ Grade 2 injection site reaction for more than 7 days despite optimal  medical management, 
permanently discontinue MEDI0457 and durvalumab.  • Symptomatic treatment with over -the-counter 
analgesics (opioids should be avoided unless necessary) and supportive care (i.e. cold compress)   
• If pain persists for 3 days, contact Inves tigator  
Grade 3 or Grade 4  For Grade 3:  
Injection should be held until the toxicity resolves to Grade 1 or baseline.  
• If resolution occurs within 5 days, consider continued dosing of 
MEDI0457 and durvalumab at the current schedule as long as 
the adverse event of concern was not considered life -threatening.  
• If the Grade 3 injection site toxicity only improves to Grade 2 
within 5  days then omit next dose of MEDI0147 and continue 
durvalumab dependent on discussion of Investigator with 
Medical Monitor.  
• If no change of Grade 3 reaction within 5 days, then permanently 
discontinue MEDI0457 and durvalumab.  
For Grade 4:  
Permanen tly discontinue MEDI0457 and durvalumab.  For Grade 3 or Grade 4:  
• Consult Investigator for evaluation (rule out infection or other causes) and treatment (opioids 
may be considered)  
• Obtain dermatology / surgical consult

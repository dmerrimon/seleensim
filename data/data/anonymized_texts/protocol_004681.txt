1 CLINICAL STUDY SYNOPSIS  Title A prospective, open label, post marketing study of Magseed and Sentimag in patients undergoing surgical excision of a breast lesion. Device intervention Magseed and Sentimag® by Endomagnetics, Inc. Study Purpose The purpose of this post-marketing study is to provide prospective evidence that the Magseed and Sentimag® is effective for lesion localization in patients undergoing surgical excision of a breast lesion and to summarize measures of product safety and performance. Method of Use The Endomag Magseed® magnetic marker is intended to be placed percutaneously in the breast under imaging guidance (ultrasound or mammography) to mark temporarily (< 30 days) a lumpectomy site intended for surgical removal.  The Magseed® magnetic marker is localized using the Sentimag® handheld probe and surgically removed with the target tissue.   Study Design This is a post-market, prospective, open label, single arm study of Magseed and Sentimag in patients undergoing surgical excision of a breast lesion. Eligible subjects have breast lesions requiring excision. Subjects will have the Magseed marker deployed under imaging guidance up to thirty days prior to surgery.   The Magseed marker will be localized using the Sentimag system during surgery and removed with the lesion. After the lumpectomy procedure, subjects will be evaluated up to 8 weeks post-procedure for safety and patient reported outcomes. Study Population Subjects considered for enrollment will be at least 18 years old at the time of consent, and be scheduled for a lumpectomy1 procedure (which also includes excisional biopsy) of the breast; and meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria. Planned Number of Subjects At least 100 subjects will be enrolled. Investigational Sites United States: MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX. Study Duration The expected duration of enrolment is approximately 10 months across all sites with each individual subject’s participation lasting 1-8 weeks after enrolment.  The total study duration is approximately 12 months. Primary Objective To provide evidence that the index lesion and Magseed can be successfully retrieved in the initial excised specimen when Magseed and Sentimag are used as indicated in lumpectomy procedures in patients requiring surgical excision of a breast lesion.  Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is the percent retrieval rate of the index lesion and Magseed in the initial excised specimen.  This is defined as the number of subjects in whom the index lesion and Magseed are retrieved in the initial excised specimen divided by the total number of subjects undergoing surgery. Other Endpoints Safety • Rates of device-related adverse events and device-related serious adverse events  Radiological Placement • Radiologist rated ease of marker placement • Success rate of Magseed placement (placement accuracy): <5mm to lesion; 5-10mm to lesion; >10 mm to the target. • Duration of Magseed placement (lesion localization) procedure                                                                     1 The term lumpectomy here refers to the removal of any lesion from the breast and will include partial mastectomy, segmental mastectomy, wide local excision, and excisional biopsy.

Surgical Localization • Overall re-excision rate • Re-excision rate necessary to remove the Magseed or targeted lesion • Surgeon rated ease of localization during surgery • Duration of lumpectomy procedure  Pathology • Pathologist rated ease of marker identification and retrieval. Inclusion Criteria • Subjects with a breast lesion requiring image-guided localization prior to excision. • Subjects aged 18 years or more at the time of consent.  Exclusion Criteria • The subject is pregnant or lactating. • Subject has pacemaker or other implantable device in the chest wall. • Subject has current active infection at the implantation site in the breast (per investigator discretion) Statistical Test Method for the Primary Hypotheses Statistical methods are descriptive for this single arm study. Exact 95% confidence intervals will be calculated for the primary endpoint. Sample Size Calculation for the Primary Endpoint Sample size for this single arm study has been calculated based on the precision of the confidence interval for the primary endpoint, the proportion of successful retrievals. A sample of 100 patients will provide an exact 95% confidence interval with maximum width ±0.092 providing the proportion of successes is at least 80%. At the anticipated success rate of 90% the confidence interval precision will be ±0.076.  Up to 120 patients will be enrolled to ensure excision data for 100 patients.

About 1 in 8 (12%) women in the US will develop invasive breast cancer during their lifetime.  The American Cancer Society's estimates for breast cancer in the United States for 20162 are:  • An estimated 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer are expected to be diagnosed in women in the U.S. • 61,000 new cases of non-invasive (in situ) breast cancer will also be diagnosed • About 40,450 women are expected to die from breast cancer Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, with great diversity in the site, size and progression of tumors. Some are palpable and discovered by the patient, but many early cancers identified through screening programs are too small to detect by palpation. For these nonpalpable cancers, localization is necessary, to guide surgeons to the target excision site prior to breast conserving surgery (BCS) being performed. With the increased rate of mammographic screening and improved imaging techniques the numbers of nonpalpable breast lesions detected is also increasing. In addition, lesions not yet proven to be cancers by needle biopsy but suspicious may also require localization to guide their excision in order for a definitive diagnosis to be made.                                                                      2 https://cancerstatisticscenter.cancer.org

3.1 Wire Guided Localization Traditionally, surgical guidance for nonpalpable lesions involves image-guided insertion of a wire into the breast, with positioning of the wire tip at the centre of the lesion. The surgeon estimates the position of the wire tip and excises a margin of tissue around it.  However, this procedure has a number of limitations3 including: • Wire localization must be performed on the day of surgery to minimize risk of wire migration or dislodgement, a significant possibility due to the external section of wire left protruding from the breast.  • Same-day appointments demand excellent coordination between radiological and surgical departments to ensure that disruption to procedure scheduling is minimized.  • Wires have also been associated with higher re-operation rates2,3.  • From the patient perspective, wire placement necessitates a sometimes painful extra procedure on the day of surgery, which can increase stress levels2.   • The position of the surgical incision can be influenced by the wire placement4. This can lead to excessive dissection and suboptimal cosmetic results due to resection of uninvolved breast tissue. 3.2 Radioactive Seed Localization Radioactive seed localization (RSL) is a newer technique which overcomes some of the limitations of guidewires5. A radioactive seed is inserted to mark the lesion prior to surgery, thus eliminating the requirement for radiology appointments on the day of surgery. The seed is detected in the operating room using a handheld gamma probe. With RSL, there is no distraction from external projections of wire, and the surgeon is guided purely by the audible response to the seed using the probe.  Where available, RSL potentially offers improved scheduling and improved surgical outcomes over wires6.  However, implementing and running an RSL system is challenging because of the stringent regulatory regime for the use of radioactive materials, in particular: • An on-site nuclear medicine facility is required; • A total chain of custody of radioactive material at the site (hospital) must be maintained, and loss of a seed can result in closure of the program; • Regulations govern the safe disposal of radioactive waste7. As a result, significant planning, training and administration across multiple departments is required to implement RSL, and this has limited its wider uptake. 3.3 Iron Oxide Use in Breast Surgery Several studies have investigated the use of liquid injections of iron oxide rather than traditional radioisotope and blue dye injections, for sentinel lymph node identification. A handheld magnetometer is then used to detect the iron oxide in the nodes. A meta-analysis of five studies concluded that the                                                                     3 S.M. Dua et al., The Breast 20 (2011) 246-253  4 P.J.

magnetic technique is non-inferior to the standard radioisotope & blue dye injections in sentinel node identification8.  In addition, Ahmed et al. tested localization of cancerous lesions using a magnetic tracer injection9. The tracer successfully localized all tumors and resulted in appropriate excisional margins, without excess tissue excision; thus demonstrating the feasibility of magnetic tracer localization of tumors. 3.4 Magseed Magnetic Localization Magnetic marker localization has similar principles to RSL. However, instead of radioactive seeds, a magnetically responsive marker called Magseed is placed into the breast. The marker is similar to a biopsy clip and can be detected using a handheld magnetometer called Sentimag. The Sentimag probe emits an alternating magnetic field that detects the magnetic response of the Magseed marker. The magnetometer produces an audible response and numerical display when held close to the Magseed marker, and can be used by surgeons to locate target excision sites. Magseed is indicated for implantation up to 30 days before surgery. 3.5 Summary of Localization Techniques The scheduling difficulties and the patient inconvenience encountered in wire guided localization, alongside the logistical and regulatory issues of radioisotope usage, highlight a requirement for further innovation and acquisition of new localization technologies. Magnetic marker localization offers an alternative that can overcome the limitations of these existing technologies. This study will evaluate a magnetic marker called Magseed and its accompanying handheld magnetic probe called Sentimag.  4 DEVICE DESCRIPTION 4.1 Device Name  Sentimag® and Magseed by Endomagnetics, Inc. 4.2 Device Description  The Sentimag® and Magseed intra-operative magnetic sensing system (Figure 1) comprises a magnetic marker, Magseed, and a sensitive handheld magnetometer attached to a base unit, Sentimag®. The magnetometer and magnetic marker have been FDA cleared (K153044) for the following intended use: The Endomag Magseed Magnetic Marker is intended to be placed percutaneously in the breast to mark temporarily (< 30 days) a lumpectomy site intended for surgical removal. Using imaging guidance (such as ultrasound or radiography) or aided by non-imaging guidance (Endomag Sentimag® System) the Endomag Magseed® Magnetic Marker is located and surgically removed with the target tissue.  The Endomag Sentimag® System is intended for the non-imaging detection and localization of the "Endomag Magseed Magnetic Marker" that has been implanted in a lumpectomy site intended for surgical removal.  The Magseed device is a small (5 x 0.9 mm) metallic magnetic marker that has soft magnetic properties. This means that when exposed to a magnetic field it becomes magnetic. The magnetic signature can then be detected using a magnetometer and probe which gives an audible and visual signal of the strength of response from the marker, and as it is directional, this can accurately guide the user to the site of the magnetic marker. The marker is deployed by a radiologist into the center of the lesion planned for                                                                     8 Teshome M., et al.

excision, a similar technique to that currently used to place a wire into the breast.  During surgery, the surgeon uses the Sentimag handheld probe to localize the marker for excision. There is no radiation exposure from this device, nor are there any special considerations for handling or disposal of Magseed. 
 
 Figure 1:  Sentimag® and Magseed System Showing Base Unit, Probe, and Magseed Delivery System   4.2.1 Sentimag Magnetic Probe The Sentimag® Base Unit and handheld probe form an ultrasensitive magnetometer that is designed to detect small amounts of magnetic markers. The detachable hand-held probe is connected to the base unit with a flexible cable.  A detachable footswitch is connected to the base unit via a flexible hose (Figure 2). The sensing of a magnetic marker is indicated by a change in pitch of an audio output from the base unit, enabling the surgeon to move the hand-held probe around the area of the marker, and localize the lesion containing it. A numerical representation of the detected signal level is simultaneously displayed on the

• Maximum MR system reported whole body averaged specific absorption rate (SAR) of 4 W/kg (First Level Controlled Operating Mode).  Please see the Magseed Instructions for Use for further MRI information.  
  Needle delivery system Seed (Nominal size: 0.9mm diameter x 5mm) Figure 3: Magseed magnetic marker needle delivery system and marker   4.3  System Operation The Magseed magnetic marker is deployed under, either ultrasound or mammography (x-ray) imaging guidance.  The needle delivery system and the marker are visible under both these modalities.  Magseed is not suitable for MRI guided deployment as the needle delivery system is not MRI compatible.  Using the delivery system, the marker is placed percutaneously in the breast up to 30 days prior to surgery. A post-placement mammogram can be used to confirm that the marker is in the desired position in the breast.  During surgery the marker facilitates magnetic localization of the target lesion using the Sentimag® probe, initially to allow the approximate location to be identified and an incision made, and then post-incision within the surgical site to detect and localize the lesion for excision.  For some lesions, the position of the incision can be determined by other means, for example a skin mark.  The Sentimag probe generates an alternating magnetic field that temporarily magnetizes the marker. The magnetic signature generated by the marker is then detected by a sensitive magnetometer in the probe. The unit displays a numerical reading and emits an audible tone that increases in frequency (pitch) with the marker's proximity to the probe.  Once the marker has been localized, it is excised with the lesion. 4.4 Device Intended Use The Endomag Magseed Magnetic Marker is intended to be placed percutaneously in the breast to mark temporarily (< 30 days) a lumpectomy site intended for surgical removal. Using imaging guidance (such as ultrasound or radiography) or aided by non- imaging guidance (Endomag Sentimag® System) the Endomag Magseed® Magnetic Marker is located and surgically removed with the target tissue.  The Endomag Sentimag® System is intended for the non-imaging detection and localization of the "Endomag Magseed Magnetic Marker" that has been implanted in a lumpectomy site intended for surgical removal.

 5 STUDY PURPOSE The purpose of this post-marketing study is to provide prospective evidence that the Magseed and Sentimag® is effective for lesion localization in patients undergoing surgical excision of a breast lesion and to summarize measures of product safety and performance. 5.1 Study Rationale The guidewire method for localization of breast lesions has been largely unchanged for thirty years despite a number of drawbacks, including: • Guidewire placement must happen on the day of surgery to reduce the risk of wire movement and to minimize the risk of infection.  This can make scheduling between radiology and surgery departments difficult10,13. • Wires can become displaced or transected during surgery, making accurate lesion localization more difficult10,11. • The position of the surgical incision can be influenced by the wire placement10,13. • The use of guidewires has been associated with high re-excision rates11,12,13. • The additional procedure on the same day is stressful for some patients10. More recently, the introduction of RSL offers scheduling benefits to surgeons and radiologists and the potential for improved surgical outcomes.  However, use of radioactive materials is closely regulated, and in order to set up a seed program, significant multi-disciplinary investment in training and implementation of radioactive materials handling processes is required.  This means that in practice, RSL is limited to the larger healthcare institutions where this administrative overhead is more readily justifiable.  The Sentimag and Magseed system overcomes the limitations of guidewires and offers the benefits of RSL without the administrative burden of dealing with nuclear medicine regulations. This post-marketing study will assess the effectiveness of the Sentimag and Magseed system for breast lesion localization, in particular the % retrieval rate of the index lesion and Magseed in the initial excised specimen. In addition, other measures of device performance and device safety will be recorded. As the focus of this study is a new surgical tool, and not a change to the treatment pathway, it is not considered necessary to include a cohort control or to randomize the study.  In any case, it would not be possible to mask the radiologists or surgeons who perform the localization procedure due to the packaging and shape differences between the Magseed product and any commercially-approved control product.  Therefore, this study will be considered an open-label, single arm study.  6 STUDY DESIGN The Magseed magnetic marker localization study is a prospective, open label, post marketing study of Magseed and Sentimag in patients undergoing surgical excision of a breast lesion. The expected duration of enrolment is approximately 10 months with each individual subject’s participation lasting 2-8 weeks after enrolment, usually ending at the first post-operative visit.  The total study duration is approximately 12 months.                                                                     10 S.M. Dua et al., The Breast 20 (2011) 246-253  11 M. Ahmed, M.

All inclusion criteria must be met and no exclusion criteria can be met in order to be enrolled in the study. Enrollment and Baseline (Visit 1) Prior to any study-specific procedures, the subject’s written informed consent and HIPAA authorization will be obtained. A subject will be considered enrolled in the study after granting written informed consent. The informed consent process must be documented in the subject’s medical records (Section 15: Informed Consent and Confidentiality). A Subject Identification (ID) Log which captures subject identifiers, for subjects enrolled in the study, will be completed by site personnel and maintained at the site. Following the informed consent process, a baseline evaluation will be completed. The baseline evaluation will be performed prior to the Magseed placement procedure and will include the following assessments: • Demographics: age, gender, height, and weight • Breast history, menopausal status, tumor size, stage, and how detected • Neo-adjuvant chemotherapy 10.2 Marker Placement Procedure (Visit 2) All eligible subjects will have the Magseed marker deployed under imaging guidance up to thirty days prior to surgery.  All women of child-bearing potential will undergo standard of care pregnancy evaluation prior to the marker deployment.  If a single Magseed is placed, the marker will be deployed close to the center of the lesion, and the position of the marker relative to the lesion recorded from the post-placement mammogram.  In the beginning of the study (first 20 subjects), only one Magseed will be placed. More than one marker can be deployed to bracket a larger lesion, and the position of the markers relative to the lesion recorded from the post-placement mammogram.  In this study, no more than 3 Magseeds are to be placed in one subject.  If more than one Magseed is used, they need to be placed greater than 20mm apart.  If the Magseeds are placed less than 20mm apart, they behave as once source spread over a slightly larger area.  In this case, the Magseeds can be readily detected, but not easily distinguished apart.

 CONFIDENTIAL Version 1.2     30 December 2016 
The imaging guidance can be ultrasound or stereotactic mammography.  Magseed cannot be deployed under MRI guidance as the Magseed delivery system needle is not MRI compatible.  Radiologist evaluation will include the following assessments: • Location and depth of lesion • Number of markers placed  • BI-RADS breast density • Ease of marker placement After the procedure, the patient will have a mammogram as per standard of care to confirm marker placement. 10.3 Lumpectomy Procedure And Marker Excision (Visit 3) The Magseed marker will be localized using the Sentimag system during surgery and planned removal with the lesion per standard procedures. The Sentimag® probe is not sterile and must be used with a sterile sheath. During the procedure, the surgeon will use the Sentimag® probe to identify the magnetic marker.  The location of the surgical incision is made per physician discretion. Intraoperative X-ray may be used to confirm that the marker is within the excised tissue specimen. The Magseed will be discarded after the pathology assessment is complete. Figure 4 displays the flow of the lumpectomy procedure.

10.4 Post-Operative Visit / Study Completion  The post-procedure evaluation visit should occur up to 8 weeks post-procedure for safety and patient reported outcomes.  Study data collection will include an adverse event assessment, histopathology data and any protocol deviations.   Following collection of the study data, subjects will have completed the study and study completion information will be obtained on the eCRF. 10.5 Pathology Lab All lumpectomy samples removed will be sent to the site’s pathology laboratory for evaluation.  A standard of care histopathology report will be obtained.  The ease of removal of the magnetic marker will also be recorded.

After all assessments have been completed at the Post-Operative Visit (Visit 4), subject completion information will be captured on the Post-Operative Visit eCRF. 10.6.2 Withdrawal or Death Subjects have the right to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.  If a subject chooses to voluntarily withdraw after being enrolled (e.g. signing the informed consent), data that were collected prior 
Clinical Investigational Plan #US-002  Magseed Magnetic Marker Localization  Page 18 of 30     
 CONFIDENTIAL Version 1.2     30 December 2016 
to the subject’s withdrawal from the study will be analyzed.  The Principal Investigator has the right to discontinue a subject’s participation in the study in the event of an underlying illness, adverse event or protocol violation.  All subject withdrawals will be documented on the Subject Exit eCRF. Withdrawn subjects will not be replaced. For subject’s who expire during their participation in the study, an Adverse Event eCRF may be completed in addition to a Subject Exit eCRF.  Copies of the death record, death certificate and/or autopsy report (if performed) are requested to be sent to Endomagnetics as soon as they become available. 10.6.3 Lost to Follow-Up For subjects that appear to be lost to follow-up, the site coordinator must document in the medical records at least three attempts to contact the subject.  The coordinator must use at least two methods (phone, e-mail, certified mail, personal visit) and one contact must be made using certified mail to the subject’s last known address.  All lost-to-follow-ups will be documented on the Subject Exit eCRF. 11 ADVERSE EVENTS  11.1 Adverse Event Overview And Reporting Adverse event definitions are provided in Section 11.2. Administrative edits were made to combine definitions from ISO 14155-2011.  In this study, only the following AEs must be reported and recorded in the eCRF: • Device-related AEs experienced by the study subject from the time of study enrollment through to study subject exit; and • Device-related SAEs experienced by the study subject from the time of study enrollment through to study subject exit.   The following SAEs do not need to be reported or recorded in the eCRF: • Anticipated SAEs, see section 11.2.1, that are related to the index procedure; and  Death should not be recorded as an AE, but should only be reflected as an outcome of a specific SAE. Adverse event reports will include a description including the suspected diagnosis, signs and symptoms, actions taken and the clinical outcome for the subject. The Investigator must provide his/her medical judgment of the following: • Whether the event is an unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE); • Whether the event is serious (SAE); and  • The relationship of the event to the study device.  In the case of serious (SAE) or unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE), or those deemed to be related to the study device, de-identified copies of medical record documentation (e.g. procedure notes, discharge summary, relevant progress notes, imaging or lab studies) will be sent to Endomagnetics with the AE eCRF to describe the treatment, resolution and outcome of the adverse event.   All AE notification for SAEs and UADEs will be sent to Endomagnetics within 3 business days of discovery of the event by site personnel.  All AE eCRFs must be reviewed and signed by the Investigator.  It is the Investigator’s responsibility to inform the IRB of adverse events as required by the IRB’s procedure.

11.2 Definitions Adverse Event (AE) An adverse event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence, unintended disease or injury experienced by a subject during this trial regardless of its relationship to the trial product.  Serious Adverse Event (SAE) An adverse event is considered serious if it meets at least one of the following criteria: a) led to death, b) led to serious deterioration in the health of the subject, that either resulted in • a life-threatening illness or injury, or • a permanent impairment of a body structure or a body function, or • in-patient or prolonged hospitalization, or • medical or surgical intervention to prevent life-threatening illness or injury or permanent impairment to a body structure or a body function, c) led to fetal distress, fetal death or a congenital abnormality or birth defect NOTE: Planned hospitalization for a pre-existing condition, or a procedure required by the protocol, without serious deterioration in health, is not considered a serious adverse event. Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect (UADE) is any adverse device effect on health or safety or any life-threatening problem or death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death that is not previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in this Investigational Plan or application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  11.2.1 Anticipated Adverse Events Adverse events that are anticipated to occur during this clinical trial are believed to be similar to those associated with undergoing the same lumpectomy or excisional biopsy (the index procedure) and those associated with implantation of material similar to Magseed, or have been identified by Endomagnetics as part of their risk assessment.  Anticipated AEs are tabulated below.

Table 3: List of Anticipated Adverse Events  Adverse events associated with lumpectomy or breast conserving surgery Ecchymyosis / Bruising Cellulitis Respiratory Disorder Rash Pain Nausea Allergic Reactions (Anaphylaxis) Seroma Erythema Superficial eschar Hypotension Cellulitis Ecchymyosis / Bruising Skin Ischemia Infection Adverse events associated with implantation of similar materials Hematoma Hemorrhage Infection Adjacent tissue injury Pain Allergic reaction Foreign body reactions (e.g. granulomas)  11.2.2 Device-related Adverse Event  An adverse event is considered to be device-related when, in the judgment of the Investigator, the clinical event has a reasonable time sequence associated with use of the trial device or control and is unlikely to be attributed to concurrent disease or other procedures or medications, or it is reasonable to believe that the device directly caused or contributed to the adverse event.   11.3 Adverse Event Relatedness Adverse events will be determined by the Investigator as to their relatedness to the study device using the following classifications: • Not related: An adverse event for which sufficient information exists to indicate that there is no causal connection between the event and the trial device.  The adverse event is due to and readily explained by the subject’s underlying disease state or the index procedure or is due to concomitant medication or therapy not related to the use of the study device.  • Definitely related: The adverse event has a strong causal relationship to the trial device. The adverse event follows a strong temporal relationship to the use of the study device, follows a known response pattern to the study device, and cannot be reasonably explained by known characteristics of the subject’s clinical state, the index procedure or other therapies.  • Undetermined relationship:  Sufficient information is not available to determine the event’s causality.  11.4 Medical Monitor An additional Medical Monitor, is not required for this study as the study device is FDA approved and being used within its label indication.   11.5 Device Deficiencies And Observations A device deficiency is defined as an inadequacy of a medical device with respect to its identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety or performance.  All device deficiencies and observations of the Sentimag and Magseed are required to be documented on a Device Deficiency eCRF.  In the event of the product not performing to specifications, the product shall be returned to the Sponsor for analysis.  Analysis of the product will be provided to the investigational site from which the product performance issue was reported.

This document will signify the Investigator’s agreement to comply with this Investigational Plan as well as all pertinent regulations and laws.  14.6 Investigational Site Training  All site personnel will be trained prior to performing or being delegated to conduct study-specific activities.  Endomag will conduct training of the Sentimag and Magseed with the surgeons and radiologists as part of site initiation. Proctoring is permissible to train additional investigators. The site staff responsible for completing the eCRFs will be instructed on the proper procedure for completing the forms and ensuring that all data are collected. They will be trained by members of the Sponsor’s clinical staff or nominated representatives. All site personnel (Investigator(s) and site staff) will be instructed on the protocol, including all follow-up requirements, adverse event reporting, trial product handling and accountability, good clinical practices, HIPAA regulations, regulatory requirements and instructions for obtaining consent. All site personnel involved in investigational product use will also be trained on product use.  In addition, Investigator Responsibilities (Section 17.4) training will be conducted with the responsible Investigator.  All training will be documented. 15 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS 15.1 Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is the % retrieval rate of the index lesion and Magseed in the initial excised specimen.  This is defined as the number of subjects in whom the Magseed is localized and the index lesion and Magseed are retrieved in the initial excised specimen, divided by the total number of subjects undergoing surgery for excision of a breast lesion following placement of Magseed in the lesion. 
Clinical Investigational Plan #US-002  Magseed Magnetic Marker Localization  Page 24 of 30     
 CONFIDENTIAL Version 1.2     30 December 2016 
15.2 Sample Size Determination Sample size for this single arm study has been calculated based on the precision of the confidence interval for the primary endpoint, the proportion of successful retrievals. A sample of 100 patients with excision data will provide an exact 95% confidence interval14 with maximum width ±0.092 providing the proportion of successes is at least 80%. At the anticipated success rate of 90% the confidence interval precision will be ±0.076. Up to 120 patients will be enrolled to ensure excision data for 100 patients. 15.3 Statistical Methods Statistical analysis is the responsibility of the sponsor’s designated statistician. A full statistical analysis plan will be written prior to any data analysis. 15.3.1 Analysis Sets All subjects who undergo the lumpectomy with Magseed excision procedure as part of the study will be included in all analyses of safety. Specific endpoints related to Magseed placement and excision will be based on the total number of subjects undergoing the procedure.  15.3.2 Control of Systematic Error/Bias Selection of subjects will be made from the Investigator's usual subject load. All subjects meeting the inclusion/exclusion criteria and having signed the ICF will be eligible to enroll in the trial. Consecutively eligible subjects should be enrolled into the study to minimize selection bias.  15.4 Data Analyses 15.4.1 Demographic and Baseline Characteristics Baseline data will be summarized using descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, n, minimum, maximum) for continuous variables and frequency tables for discrete variables.  15.4.2 Other Endpoints Procedural data will be summarized using descriptive statistics for continuous measures and frequency tables or proportions for discrete variables. Endpoints will be summarized using proportions for rates or binary outcomes while continuous data will be summarized by presenting means, medians, standard deviations, sample sizes, minimums, and maximums. Point estimates will be provided for rates and mean values along with 95% confidence intervals. Rates of serious adverse events (SAEs) will be reported by relationship to device and severity, and rates of adverse events related to the device will be reported. Any unanticipated adverse device effects (UADEs) will be listed and summarized as appropriate. No formal tests of hypotheses are proposed for the other endpoints.  15.4.3 Interim Analyses There are no formal interim analyses planned in this observational study. Ongoing data summaries may be performed at any time. 15.4.4 Subgroup Analyses No subgroup analyses are planned.   15.4.5 Missing Data Management The products being evaluated in this study are designed to help physicians localize lesions during surgery for breast cancer or excision of other breast lesions. All required information can be obtained during the                                                                     14 Calculated based on exact confidence intervals using Clopper-Pearson method as expected proportion is high. 
Clinical Investigational Plan #US-002  Magseed Magnetic Marker Localization  Page 25 of 30     
 CONFIDENTIAL Version 1.2     30 December 2016 
lumpectomy procedure and missing data for the primary endpoint are not expected to be a concern nor affect the scientific soundness of this study.  If there are missing data (i.e. data for Magseed has not been recorded or has been lost), a sensitivity analysis will be carried out for the primary endpoint.  Both the worst case and the best case proportions will be calculated. For the worst case analysis, subjects with missing data will be assumed to have no magnetic marker detected and retrieved. For the best case analysis, subjects with missing data for will be assumed to have a magnetic marker detected and retrieved. No other imputations for missing data are planned. 15.4.6 Changes to Planned Analyses Changes to the planned statistical analysis methods are not expected, however, any changes to the planned statistical analysis methods made prior to analysis will be documented in an amended Statistical Analysis Plan. Changes to the planned analysis methods after analyzing the data will be documented in the clinical study report along with a reason for the deviation from plan. 16 RISK ANALYSIS 16.1 Potential Risks Subjects participating in this study are subject to the same risks shared by all subjects with the underlying medical diagnosis and lumpectomy surgery procedure.   Please refer to the Sentimag and Magseed Instructions for Use (IFU) for warnings and contraindications for the devices. There are no specific additional risks to the subject over and above the risk mentioned in this section related to participation in the study. 16.1.1 Risk Minimization Actions Additional risks may exist. Risks can be minimized through compliance with this protocol, performing procedures in the appropriate hospital environment, adherence to subject selection criteria, close monitoring of the subject's physiologic status during research procedures and/or follow-ups and by promptly supplying Sponsor with all pertinent information required by this protocol. 16.2 Potential Benefits All subjects participating in this study may benefit from the use of Magseed and Sentimag for localizing a lesion.  The Sentimag®, used in conjunction with Magseed, assists the surgeon in the localization of the target lesion.  This technique avoids the need for the use of guidewires and the drawbacks of this technique for patients: wire placement can be painful; the additional procedure on the day of surgery can be stressful15; and there is a risk of wire migration16.  In centers where RSL is used, Magseed offers the benefit of reduced exposure to radiation. 16.3 Risk to Benefit Rationale  16.3.1 Risks associated with the procedure/implant Subjects enrolled in this post-market clinical study are subject to the same risks shared by all subjects undergoing a routine procedure with a Magseed, implanted guidewire or radioactive seed.  Please refer to the instructions for use (IFU) for the list of risks.                                                                     15 S.M. Dua et al., The Breast 20 (2011) 246-253 16 P.J.

 CONFIDENTIAL Version 1.2     30 December 2016 
16.3.2 Risks associated with the study device There are no additional risks to the study subjects over and above the risks of routine implant of the Magseed, as noted above. 16.3.3 Risks associated with participation in the clinical study There are no additional risks to the study subjects over and above the risks mentioned in Section 16.3.1 related to participation in the clinical study.    16.3.4 Potential benefits with participation in the clinical study As patients will not have a wire or radioactive seed placed, there may be a benefit in terms of improved scheduling convenience for the patient. The data collected in this study may provide information to improve future care or management of subjects undergoing standard Magseed implantation procedures in the future. 16.3.5 Risk Minimization Risks can be minimized through adherence to the guidelines for subject selection, close monitoring of the subject's physiologic status during study testing and by promptly supplying Sponsor with all pertinent information required by this study protocol. 16.3.6 Risk to Benefit Rationale Subjects enrolled in the Magseed Magnetic Marker Localization Clinical Study will not be exposed to additional risks as compared to those subjects who are routinely implanted with the Magseed not enrolled in the study.  Standard procedures will be conducted during the implant and follow-up of study subjects, just as they are for subjects not enrolled in this clinical study. Subjects enrolled in this post-market clinical study are subject to the same risks shared by all subjects undergoing a routine procedure with a Magseed, implanted guidewire or radioactive seed. There are no additional risks to the study subjects over and above the risks of routine implant of the Magseed, as noted above.   17 STUDY ADMINISTRATION 17.1 Institutional Review Board Approval The study will not be initiated before the protocol, informed consent and any applicable subject information forms have been reviewed and approved by the IRB.  A copy of all IRB approval letters and correspondence must be maintained in the investigational site study file as well as copies provided to the Sponsor. 17.2 Amendments To The Investigational Plan During the course of this investigation it may become necessary to amend the protocol, informed consent, CRFs or study subject materials.  Such amendments will be made by the Sponsor and presented to the IRB for review and/or approval prior to implementation.  17.3 Early Termination Or Suspension Of Study The Sponsor of this trial has the sole responsibility for any decision to suspend or terminate this study.

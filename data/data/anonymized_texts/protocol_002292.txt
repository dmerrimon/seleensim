Title:  A Long -term Study to Assess t he Safety and Efficacy of Lebrikizumab 
in Patients with Moderate -to-Severe Atopic Dermatitis  
Protocol Number:  DRM06 -AD07 /J2T-DM-KGAA  
Phase:  3 
Number of  Sites:  Approximately 200 sites in North America, the European Union  and 
Asia/Pacific region.  
Study Population:  
Adolescent patients (≥12 to <18 years weighing ≥40 kg) and adults who completed the 
DRM06 -AD04, DRM06 -AD05, DRM06 -AD06, DRM06 -AD17 or DRM06 -AD1 8 trial  
Sample Size:   
Approximately  900 patients may enroll in this long -term extension study.  
Study Objectives:  
To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in patients with moderate -to-
severe  atopic dermatitis ( AD). 
Duration of Patient Participation:  
Maximum total participation: up to 110 weeks  (100 weeks on study plus a 12 -week follow up 
safety visit  after the last injection of study drug at Week 98).  
Study Treatment:  
Lebrikizumab, 250 mg (2 mL injection of 125 mg/mL)  
Study Design:   
Patients who have completed participation in a Dermira - or Lilly -sponsored lebrikizumab study  
(parent study) , DRM06 -AD04, DRM06 -AD05, DRM06 -AD06, DRM06 -AD17 or DRM06 -
AD18, will be offered the opportunity to enroll in this study. This 100-week study is designed 
to assess the long -term safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab for moderate -to-severe atopic 
dermatitis.   
Patients will be considered enrolled once all baseline procedures have been completed and the 
investigator has determined that the pati ent meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two 
treatment regimens will be assessed: 250  mg lebrikizumab, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) 
and 250  mg lebrikizumab, administered every 4 weeks (Q4W). The regimen assigned to each 
patient will be based on the treatment received in the patient’s respective parent trial.   
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 7 For the monotherapy trials, DRM06 -AD04 and DRM06 -AD05:  
 Patients who were re -randomized, in the Maintenance Phase, to either 250  mg 
lebrikizumab Q2W or 250  mg lebrikizumab Q4W will continue to receive the same 
active treatment regimen.   
 Patients who were receiving placebo in the Maintenance Phase will receive a loading 
dose of 500  mg lebrikizumab at the time of enrollment (Baseline) and at Week 2 
followed by 250  mg lebrikizumab Q2W.   
 Patients  who were moved to the Escape Arm will continue to receive open label  250 mg 
lebrikizumab Q2W.   
 Treatment regimen assignment will remain blinded during the long -term extension 
study until unblinding (see Section below ), except for patients from an escape arm , who 
will receive open -label study drug . Placebo injections will be utilized in order to 
maintain the blind and ensure that all patients receive th e same number and frequency 
of injections regardless of treatment regimen assignment.  
For the TCS Combination trial, DRM06 -AD06 : 
 Patients receiving 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W who achieve an  IGA 0,1 or an  Eczema 
Area and Severity Index ( EASI ) -75 response ( ≥EASI -75) at Week 16 will be randomly 
allocated to receive 250  mg lebrikizumab Q2W or 250  mg lebrikizumab Q4W, in a 2:1 
fashion, Q2W:Q4W, respectively.  
 Patients receiving 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W who do not achieve an IGA 0,1 or an 
EASI -75 response (<EASI -75) at Week 16 will receive 250  mg lebrikizumab Q2W.  
 Patients who were receiving placebo will receive a loading dose of 500  mg 
lebrikizumab at the time of enrollment (Baseline) and at Week 2 followed by 250  mg 
lebrikizumab Q2W.  
 Patients who were receiving r escue treatment and were initially randomized to 
lebrikizumab will receive 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W.   
 Patients who were receiving rescue treatment and were initially randomized to placebo 
will receive a loading dose of 500 mg lebrikizumab at the time of enr ollment (Baseline) 
and at Week 2 followed by 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W.  
 Treatment regimen assignment will remain blinded during the long -term extension 
study  until unblinding (see Section below ). Placebo injections will be utilized in order 
to maintain the blind and ensure that all patients receive the same number and 
frequency of injections regardless of treatment regimen assignment.  
For the Adolescent Safety trial, DRM06 -AD17:  
 All patients will continue to receive open label 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 8 For the Vaccine trial, DRM06 -AD18:  
 Patients receiving 250  mg lebrikizumab Q2W will continue to receive 250  mg 
lebrikizumab Q2W  (blinded study drug at Baseline and Week 2, then open -label  study 
drug beginning at Week 4 ). 
 Patients who were receiving placebo will receive a loading dose of 500  mg 
lebrikizumab at the time of enrollment (Baseline) and at Week 2 followed by  open -label  
250 mg lebr ikizumab Q2W.  
 Treatment regimen assignment will remain blinded during the long -term extension 
study  until unblinding (until DRM06 -AD18 study  unblinded) . Placebo injections will 
be utilized in order to maintain the blind and ensure that all patients receive  the same 
number and frequency of injections regardless of treatment regimen assignment.  
Patients who are not already administering study drug at home will be instructed on self -
administration and allowed to inject study drug at home.  
Patients will return  to the clinic at Weeks 2, 4, 16 and every 12 weeks thereafter, through 
Week  100, for safety and efficacy assessments. Patients not achieving an EASI -50 (from parent 
study baseline ) by Week 16 , maintaining an EASI -50 response , or not achiev ing clinical benefit 
based on PI discretion  should be terminated from this study.  
Efficacy will be assessed using the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), EASI and Body 
Surface Area ( BSA ). Patients who have been completing daily pruritus  and sleep -loss 
assessments  and weekly  Patient -Oriented Eczema Measure  (POEM ) assessments  as part of 
their participation in the parent trial  (DRM06 -AD04, DRM06 -AD05 , DRM06 -AD06 , and 
DRM06 -AD18 ), will continue to collect  this information in the long -term extension study  (See 
Appendix  1). Patients who participated in the DRM06 -AD06 study will continue to collect 
daily  topical corticosteroid ( TCS) and topical calcineurin inhibitor ( TCI) use.  
Safety will be assessed by monitoring the collection of adverse events, serum chemistry, 
hematology and urinalysis laboratory testing, physical examination, and vital signs . 
Serum samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis and immunogen icity.   
Patients completing this study or who early terminate will return to the clinic for  a safety 
follow -up visit 12 weeks after the last study drug injection.   
A patient is considered to have completed the study if he/she has completed all required phases 
of the study including the last visit as shown in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures.  
The end of the study is defined as the date of the last visit of the last patient in the study shown 
in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures.

Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 17 1. BACKGROUND   
1.1. Atopic Dermatitis   
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a complex disease that is determined by genetic, environmental and 
immunologic factors ( Werfel,  2016 ; Simon, 2019 ).  
Genetic studies of AD ( Auriemma, 2013 ; Bieber, 2012 ; Weidinger, 2018 ) have shown that genes 
encoding for cytokines involved in the regula tion of the immune system (IL -4, IL -5, and IL -13), 
are strongly associated with the development of AD ( He, 2003 ; Hummelshoj, 2003 ; 
Novak,  2002 ). In addition, variants of genes that encode for proteins involved in skin barrier 
function such as filaggrin (FLG) and loricrin (LOR) are also associated with AD 
(Van Bever,  2011 ). Since FLG plays a central role in skin barrier integrity, loss of function 
mutations of the FLG gene is considered a major contributor to the development of early 
childhood AD ( Bieber, 2008 ; Tanei, 2009 ; Bieber, 2012 ; Flohr, 2013 ).  
Reduced epithelial barrier function, which represents the first line of protection against the 
environment, is thought to lead to sensitization to environmental allergens, associated with 
elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) (present in about 50% to 80% of all patients with AD, 
particularly in children [ Werfel, 2016 ]) and consistent with the presence in the skin of Type 2 
cytokines (IL -4, IL -5, IL -9, IL -13, IL -25, IL -31, IL -33, and thymic stromal l ymphopoietin and 
inflammation. Type 2 cytokines increase epidermal thickening, sensitization, inflammation, 
pruritus and decrease the expression of antimicrobial peptides and the barrier proteins FLG, 
LOR, and involucrin. IL -13 in particular can reduce epi thelial integrity and barrier function 
through downregulation of FLG, LOR, and involucrin ( Kim,  2008 ) and can act on keratinocytes 
in the skin to downregulate their differentiation ( Howell, 2008 ). IL-13 also induces T -cell 
chemoattractants that mediate T -cell infiltration into AD lesions ( Purwar, 2006 ) and may also 
induce IL -5 expression and eosinophil infiltration through the induction of eosinophil 
chemoattractants ( Esche, 2004 ). Increased expression of IL -13 has consistently been reported in 
AD skin lesions and is associated with disease severity ( Choy,  2012 ; Hamid, 1996 ; Jeong, 2003 ; 
La Grutta, 2005 ; Neis, 2006 ; Suarez -Farinas, 2013 ; Tazawa, 2004 ). The ubiquitous presence of 
IL-13 in the skin of patients with AD supports the evaluation of anti -IL-13 therapies in patients 
with AD.  
1.1.1.  Epidemiology of Pediatric Atopic Dermatitis   
AD is one of the most common chronic me dical diseases —15‒30% of children and 2‒10% of 
adults are affected, and the prevalence appears to have increased over the past two to three 
decades (Williams, 2008 ), with some geographic variability. With respect to disease severity, 
about 67% of AD pediatric patients have mild disease, 14 to 26% have moderate disease and 2 to 
7% have severe disease ( Silverberg, 2017 ). Approximately 85% of all cases of AD begin before 
age 5, with up to 70% of  children having spontaneous remission before adolescence 
(Bieber,  2008 ; Hua, 2014 ; Illi, 2004 ).  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 18 1.1.2.  Clinical Manifestations   
Clinically, AD is characterized by xerosis, erythematous crusted eruption (dermatosis), 
lichenification and intense pruritus ( Bieber, 2008 ), which along with the distribution, chronicity 
and history of skin lesions, form the basis for making the diagnosis AD. Flares are frequently 
triggered by exposure to environmental factors, irritants, and allergens ( Bieber, 2009 ). Several 
clinical patterns, with differing distributions of skin lesions in distinct age groups, have been 
noted ( Weidinger,  2016 ; Weidinger, 2018 ). 
The infantile stage (up to 2 years of age) is characterized by eczema that is usuall y localized to 
the face, scalp, and extensor aspects of the arms and legs. The lesions are characterized by 
pruritic, red, eczematous plaques, erythema, papules, vesicles, excoriations, oozing, and 
formation of crusts.  
The adult stage (from puberty onward s) is less predictable. Affected patients may have had only 
a few outbreaks since infancy, or they may have had a chronic, relapsing course. Lesions 
frequently localize to the face and neck (head -and neck dermatitis), as well in the flexures of the 
elbows and knees, and a considerable portion of patients (around 30%) develop atopic hand 
eczema, which may interfere with workplace activities. Like affected children, adolescents and 
adults commonly have lichenification of the flexures and have facial dermatiti s. 
Patients with AD have a high disease burden and their quality of life is significantly affected. In 
one study, AD was shown to have a greater negative effect on patient mental health than diabetes 
and hypertension (Zuber bier, 2006 ). Patients with moderate -to-severe AD have a higher 
prevalence of social dysfunction and sleep impairment, which are directly related to the severity 
of the disease  (Williams, 2008 ). Depression, anxiety, and socia l dysfunction not only affect 
patients with AD, but  also affect their caregivers ( Zuberbier, 2006 ). Compared with psoriasis, 
another common and debilitating skin disease, patients with AD have lower physical vitality, 
socia l functioning, role -emotional, and mental health scores (Kiebert, 2002 ).  
1.1.3.  Treatment for AD   
The therapeutic approach to AD consists primarily of tri gger avoidance, skin hydration with 
bathing, and use of moisturizers and anti -inflammatory therapies consisting predominantly of 
topical corticosteroids (TCS). In many patients, treatment with TCS provides some measure of 
symptomatic relief but does not al ways adequately control the disease. In those patients who 
have persistent moderate -to-severe disease not responding adequately to TCS, the step -up 
options include topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs), phototherapy, and immunosuppressive 
agents such as or al corticosteroids, cyclosporine, azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate 
mofetil. Among these, only cyclosporine is approved for treatment of moderate -to-severe AD 
(nationally licensed in many European countries, but not in the US), and its use is l imited to 
patients ≥16  years for a maximum treatment period of 8 weeks. Recently, a clinically efficacious 
and relatively safe treatment, anti -IL-4R monoclonal antibody, dupilumab, was approved for the 
treatment of adult and adolescent patients with modera te-to-severe AD. Despite  these treatments, 
AD remains a major societal burden and a significant unmet medical need.

Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 19 1.2. Lebrikizumab   
Lebrikizumab is a humanized  monoclonal immunoglo bulin (Ig) G4 antibody (huIgG4) with a 
mutation in the hinge region that increases stability. Lebrikizumab binds specifically to soluble 
human interleukin (IL) -13 with high affinity, and potently inhibits IL -13 signaling through the 
IL-4R/IL-13R1 complex . Because lebrikizumab binds to IL -13 in a non -receptor binding 
domain (i.e., a portion of the molecule not involved in binding to its receptor), antibody -bound 
IL-13 can still bind its receptor (IL -13R1), but the engaged receptor complex cannot be 
activa ted.  
1.3. Study Rationale and Benefit -Risk Assessment   
1.3.1.  Scientific Rationale   
The use of lebrikizumab for AD is supported by numerous preclinical studies demonstrating that 
AD is characterized by the increased expression of IL -13 in skin. Moreover, clinical trials 
(a Phase 2a study GS29250 [Section  1.3.1.1 ] and a Phase 2b study DRM06 -AD01 
[Section  1.3.1.3 ]) with lebrikizumab demonstrated significant cli nical benefit in patients with 
AD. Additional detailed discussion of the lebrikizumab studies is provided in the lebrikizumab 
Investigator’s Brochure.  
1.3.1.1.  Summary of Study GS29250 (TREBLE)   
Study Design  
TREBLE was a Phase 2, global, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled trial designed to 
evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in adult patients (18 –75 years of age) with 
persistent moderate to severe AD, inadequately con trolled by TCS. The study consisted of 
3 study periods: a run -in period (2  weeks), a treatment period (12  weeks), and a safety follow -up 
period (8 weeks). Patients applied emollient at least once daily and TCS of medium potency to 
all active skin lesions t wice daily through the study. A total of 212 patients were randomized as 
follows: 53 to the lebrikizumab 250 mg, single dose group; 53 to the lebrikizumab 125 mg, 
single dose group; 52 to the lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W group; and 54 to the placebo Q4W 
group.   
Efficacy Results  
 EASI -50 at Week 12 (primary endpoint) was achieved by patients treated with 
lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W, with a treatment  difference between this group and placebo) 
of 20.1% p  = 0.0261).  
 Lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W group demonstrated statisticall y significant differences from 
placebo in EASI -75 and SCORing Atopic Dermatitis -50 (SCORAD -50) and adjusted 
mean change from baseline to Week 12.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 20 Safety Results  
 Injection -site reactions occurred infrequently (1.3% all lebrikizumab treated vs. 1.9% 
placebo) ; all events were non -serious, lasted a median of 1 to 3 days, and did not lead to 
treatment discontinuation or interruption.  
 Herpes viral infections and zoster occurred infrequently, but only among lebrikizumab -
treated patients (6 of 156 [3.8%]); all even ts were non -serious, and none led to treatment 
discontinuation or dose interruption of lebrikizumab.  
 Eosinophil -associated adverse events (AEs) were reported infrequently, but only occurred 
among lebrikizumab -treated patients (3.2%); however, all events were non -serious, did 
not result in interruption of treatment, and there were no other associated clinical 
symptoms noted.  
 Allergic conjunctivitis events were only reported in lebrikizumab -treated patients (8  of 
156 patients [5.1%] vs. 0% in placebo treate d patients); all events were non -serious, did 
not lead to treatment discontinuation, all events recovered or resolved, and all patients 
had a history of asthma. Imbalances in allergic conjunctivitis events were not reported in 
previous lebrikizumab trials.  
 The overall incidence of skin infection (noted in the system organ class [SOC] of 
infections and infestations) was 9.6% in all lebrikizumab arms combined, compared to 
22% in the placebo arm.  
Conclusions  
The results of this trial suggested that lebrikizumab (on a background of mandatory twice daily 
TCS treatment) provided some treatment benefit, as measured through EASI and SCORAD, but 
also suggested that higher lebrikizumab dosing might provide greater cl inical benefit. In 
addition, lebrikizumab was well tolerated with a safety profile generally consistent with that 
observed in previous trials conducted in other indications.  
1.3.1.2.  Summary of Study GS29735 (ARBAN)   
Study Design  
ARBAN was a Phase 2, randomized, open -label study designed to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of lebrikizumab monotherapy in adult patients (18 –75 years of age) with persistent 
moderate to severe AD, who were ina dequately controlled by TCS. A total of 55 patients were 
randomized to treatment: 28 to lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W and 27 to TCS.  
Efficacy Results  
 EASI -50 was achieved by 53.6% and 51.9% of patients in the lebrikizumab and TCS 
groups, respectively, with a tr eatment difference of 1.7%. EASI -75 was achieved by 
39.3% and 37.0% of patients in the 2 groups, respectively, with a treatment difference of 
2.3%.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 21  IGA scores of 0 or 1 were observed for 7.1% of patients in the lebrikizumab group and 
25.9% of patients in t he TCS group, giving a treatment difference of −18.8% (95% 
CI: −37.9%, 0.3%).  
 The percent of patients achieving SCORAD -50 or SCORAD -75 showed treatment 
differences of −19.3% and −7.5%, respectively.  
Safety Results  
 AEs were reported for a higher proportion of patients in the lebrikizumab group 
compared with the TCS group (64.3% vs. 37.0%); a higher proportion of patients in the 
lebrikizumab group, compared with the TCS group, had an AE in the SOC of infections 
and infestations (42.9% vs. 25.9%). Upper respir atory tract infections were more 
common in the lebrikizumab group (14.3% vs. 3.7%).  
 The overall incidence of skin infection (in the SOC of infections and infestations) was 
17.9% in the lebrikizumab group and 7.4% in the placebo/TCS group.  
 No serious AEs (S AEs), deaths, anaphylaxis, malignancy, protocol -defined parasitic or 
targeted intracellular infections of interest, herpes viral infections or zoster, or 
eosinophilia -associated AEs were reported.  
Conclusions  
Lebrikizumab was well tolerated at the dose of 125 mg Q4W; the safety profile was generally 
consistent with previous experience with lebrikizumab in previous trials.  
1.3.1.3.  Summary of Dose Ranging Study DRM06 -AD01   
Study Design  
DRM0 6-AD01 was a Phase 2b, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled, dose -ranging 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of lebrikizumab in adult patients with moderate to 
severe AD. A total of 280 patients were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups (in  a 3:3:3:2 
ratio): 73 to lebrikizumab 125 mg Q4W (with a loading dose of 250 mg); 80 to lebrikizumab 
250 mg administered every 4 weeks  (Q4W ) (with a loading dose of 500  mg); 75 to lebrikizumab 
250 mg administered every 2 weeks  (Q2W ) (with a loading dose of  500 mg given at baseline and 
Week 2); 52 to placebo Q2W.  
Efficacy Results  
 Statistically significantly greater proportions of patients in each of the lebrikizumab 
250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups achieved EASI -50, EASI -75, or EASI -90 at 
Week  16 than the p lacebo group.  
 A statistically significantly greater proportion of patients in each of the lebrikizumab 
250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups had both an IGA score of 0 or 1 and a ≥2 -point 
improvement in IGA score at Week 16 than the placebo group.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 22  The lebriki zumab 250  mg Q2W group had a statistically significantly greater proportion 
of patients who achieved a ≥ 4 -point improvement in pruritus numerical rating scale 
(NRS ) compared with the placebo group.  
 Positive changes in pruritus correlated with positive changes in sleep; the lebrikizumab 
250 mg Q4W and 250 mg Q2W groups had statistically significant percent reductions in 
sleep loss due to itching compared with placebo (p=0.0459 and p=0.0062, respectively).  
Safety Results  
 The incidences of conjunctivitis ( 2.6% all lebrikizumab groups, 0 placebo), herpes 
infections (2.2% all lebrikizumab groups, 0 placebo), and herpes zoster (0.9% all 
lebrikizumab groups, 0 placebo) were relatively low.  
 Four patients (1.8%) in the lebrikizumab groups and 2 patients (3.8%) in the placebo 
group had an SAE. Those reported in the lebrikizumab groups were  
o severe chest pain (1  patient in the 250 mg Q2W group)  
o severe hernial eventration (1 patient in the 125 mg Q4W group)  
o femur fracture of moderate severity (1 patient in the 125 mg Q4W group), and  
o panic attack of moderate severity (1  patient in the 250 mg Q2W group).  
Those reported in the placebo group were severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 
severe edema peripheral, and severe pulmonary embolism. All SAEs were considered by 
the investigator as not related to study drug.   
 Most AEs were considered not related to study drug; those considered related were 
reported for 16.2% of patients in the lebrikizumab groups and 5.8% of patients in the 
placebo group  
Conclusions  
This Phase 2b study showed that higher doses of lebrikizumab provided greater clinical benefit. 
All lebrikizumab doses induced statistically significant reductions in EASI scores compared to 
placebo, and a goo d dose response was observed for all primary and key secondary efficacy 
endpoints. The best response for all endpoints was observed with the highest lebrikizumab dose 
(250 mg Q2W), although the next highest dose (250 mg Q4W) also induced significant 
improv ement in virtually all endpoints. All doses of lebrikizumab were well tolerated, without a 
dose response noted; AEs were generally mild or moderate and considered unrelated to study 
drug. These results provided the basis for dose selection for the pivotal Phase 3 studies.

Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 23 1.3.1.4.  Summary of DRM06 -AD03 Phase 1 PK Study   
Study Design  
DRM06 -AD03 was a Phase 1, randomized, parallel -group study to evaluate the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of lebrikizumab in healthy adult volunteers (18 to 45 years of 
age, inclusive). A total of 41 subjects were randomized as follows: 21 subjects received two 
1-mL (125 mg) subcutaneous ( SC) injections and 20 subjects received one 2 -mL (250 mg) SC 
injection. The primary objective was to compare the PK (AUC, C max) of the 2 lebrikizumab 
dosing regimens. Blood samples were collected prior to dosing and on Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 11, 15, 29, 
43, 57, 71, 85 and 99 for PK and Day 29, 43, 57, 71, 85 and 99 for anti -drug ant ibodies (ADA).  
Pharmacokinetic Results  
For each AUC comparison (i.e., AUC last, AUC inf, and AUC 0-57d) geometric mean ratios were 
close to 1 with 90% CIs within the range of 80% to 125%, except for AUC inf, which was just 
above the upper bound, with a value of 132%. The C max geometric mean ratio was 0.89 with a 
90% CI of 73% –108%.  
Conclusions  
Both the AUC and C max results indicated similar overall exposure between the 2 lebrikizumab 
dosing regimens evaluated in this study, i.e., two 1 -mL (125 mg) SC injections versus one 2 -mL 
(250 mg) SC injection. Data from this study support the use of the 2 -mL (250 mg) pre -filled 
syringe with a pre -assembled needle safety device (PFS -NSD) in the Phase 3 pivotal trials.  
1.4. Rationale for Dose and Treatment Regimen   
For the Phase 3 development program, a dosin g regimen  of 500 mg loading dose at baseline and 
Week 2, followed by 250 mg Q2W lebrikizumab was selected for study in the Induction Period 
(baseline to Week 16), based on an evaluation of safety, efficacy and PK data from the 
DRM06 -AD01 and DRM06 -AD03 tri als (Sections  1.3.1.3  and 1.3.1.4 ). The DRM06 -AD03 PK 
study conducted in healthy adults demonstrated that a single SC injection of 2 -mL (250 mg) of 
lebrikizumab delivered comparable levels of lebrikizumab as did two 1 -mL (125 mg) SC 
injections. This simulated the conditions under which study dru g will be administered in Phase 3, 
further supporting the dose and treatment regimen for Phase 3 trials, lebrikizumab 250  mg Q2W 
with a loading dose of 500  mg given at Baseline and Week 2.  
Following Induction, the Phase 3 development program will assess t he long term safety and 
efficacy of both a 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W dosing regimen and a 250 mg lebrikizumab Q4W 
dosing regimen in order to determine whether one or both regimens, one which involves less 
frequent dosing, might be effective in maintaining di sease control over an extended period of 
time.  
Adolescent Patients  
In this Phase 3 study, adolescent patients (≥12  to <18 years weighing  ≥40 kg), will be included 
and will receive the same doses of lebrikizumab described above for adults. The justification for 
this approach is as follows:  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 24 Both adults and adolescent patients have similar disease characteristics, typified by prominent 
Type 2 skin inflammation and similar clinical manifestations. In addition, both groups tend to 
have similar efficacy outcomes in response to therapies, including dupilumab ( Simpson, 2018 ; 
Treister, 2019 ). Pharmacokinetic modeling and simulations of lebrikizumab dosing (population 
PK modeling of pooled data from 2259 adult asthma patients and a subsequent external posterior 
predictive check with lebrikizumab PK data from the DRM06 -AD01 trial in adult AD patients) 
revealed similar kinetics for adults and adolescent patients, 12 to <18 years of age. The maximal 
exposures are predicted to be slightly (≤ 35%) higher in adolescent patients than in adults for any 
given dose due to the lower adolescent weight  ranges and lebrikizumab exposure dependence on 
weight; however, the safety profile in adolescent patients, based on the exposure -response 
relationship analysis and on partial extrapolation, is comparable to that observed in adults.

Patients who have completed participation in a Dermira - or Lilly -sponsored lebrikizumab study , 
DRM06 -AD04, DRM06 -AD05, DRM06 -AD06, DRM06 -AD17 or DRM06 -AD18,  will be 
offered the opportunity to enroll in this study . This 100-week  study is designed to assess the 
long-term safety  and efficacy  of lebrikizumab for moderate -to-severe atopic dermatitis.   
Patients will be considered enrolled once all baseline procedures have been  completed and the  
investigator has determined that the  patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Two 
treatment regimens will be assessed: 250 mg lebrikizumab, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) 
and 250 mg lebrikizumab , administered every 4 weeks (Q4W). The regimen assigned to each 
patient will be based on the treatment received in the patient’s respective parent trial .  
For the monotherapy trials, DRM06 -AD04 and DRM06 -AD05:  
 Patient s who were re -randomized , in the Mainten ance Phase,  to either 250  mg 
lebrikizumab Q2W or 250  mg lebrikizumab Q4W will continue to receive the same 
active treatment  regimen .  
 Patients who were receiving placebo in the Maintenance Phase will  receive a loading  
dose of 500  mg lebrikizumab at the tim e of enrollment (Baseline) and at Week 2 
followed by 250 mg lebrikizuma b Q2W.   
 Patients who were moved to the Escape Arm will continue to receive  open label 250 mg 
lebrikizumab Q2W .  
 Treatment regimen assignment will remain blinded during the long -term ext ension study  
until unblinding (see Section below ), except  for patients from an escape arm, who will 
receive open -label study drug . Placebo injections will be utilized in order to maintain the 
blind and ensure that a ll patients receive t he sa me number and frequency of injections 
regardless of treatment regimen assignment.  
For the TCS Combination trial, DRM06 -AD06:  
 Patients  receiving 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W who achieve an IGA 0,1 or an EASI -75 
response ( ≥EASI -75) at Week 16 will be randomly all ocated to receive 250  mg 
lebrikizumab Q2W or 250  mg lebrikizumab Q4W, in a 2:1 fashion , Q2W:Q4W , 
respectively . 
 Patients receiving 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W who do not achieve an IGA 0,1 or an 
EASI -75 response (<EASI -75) at Week 16 will receive 250  mg lebrikizumab Q2W.  
 Patients who were receiving placebo will receive a loading dose of 500  mg lebrikizumab 
at the time of enrollment (Baseline) and at Week 2 followed by 250  mg lebrikizumab 
Q2W.

lebrikizumab will receive 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W.   
 Patients who were receiving rescue treatment and were initially randomized to placebo 
will receive a loading dose of 500 mg lebrikizumab at the time of enrollment (Baseline) 
and at Week  2 followed by 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W.  
 Treatment regimen assignment will remain blinded during the long -term extension study  
until unblinding (see Section below ). Placebo injections will be utilized in order to 
maintain the blind and ensure that all patients receive the same number and frequency of 
injections regardless of treatment regimen assignment.  
For the Adolescent Safety trial, DRM06 -AD17:  
 All patients will continue to receive open label  250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W . 
For the Vaccine trial, DRM06 -AD18:  
 Patients receiving 250  mg lebrikizumab Q2W will continue to receive 250  mg 
lebrikizumab Q2W  (blinded study drug at Baseline and Week 2, then open -label  study 
drug beginning at Week 4) . 
 Patients who were receiving placebo will receive a blinded loading dose of 500  mg 
lebrikizumab at the time of enrollment (Baseline) and at Week 2 followed by open -label  
250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W.  
 Treatment regimen assignment  will remain blinded during the long -term extension study  
until unblinding  (until DRM06 -AD18 study unblinded) . Placebo injections will be 
utilized in order to maintain the blind and ensure that all patients receive the same 
number and frequency of injectio ns regardless of treatment regimen assignment.  
Patients  who are not already administering study drug at home  will be instructed on self-
administ ration and allowed to inject  study drug  at home .  
Patients will return to the clinic at Weeks 2, 4, 16 and every  12 weeks thereafter, through 
Week  100, for safety and efficacy assessments. Patients not achieving an EASI -50 (from parent 
study baseline)  by Week 16 , maintaining an EASI -50 response , or not achiev ing clinical benefit 
based on PI discretion should be terminated from this study.  
Efficacy will be assessed using the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA), EASI and Body 
Surface Area ( BSA ). Patients who have been completing daily pruritus and sleep -loss 
assessments and weekly Patient -Oriented Eczem a Measure ( POEM ) assessments as part of their 
participation in the parent trial (DRM06 -AD04, DRM06 -AD05 , DRM06 -AD06 , and DRM06 -
AD18 ), will continue to collect this information in the long -term extension study  (See 
Appendix  1). Patients who participated in the DRM06 -AD06 study will continue to collect daily 
TCS/TCI use.   Patients who participated in the DRM06 -AD18 study will continue to be collected 
daily Skin Pain NRS.   
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 28 Safety will be assessed by monitoring  the collection of  adverse events, serum chemistry,

adequately completed the study treatments and last patient visit of the parent trial.  
2. Willing and able to comply with all clinic visits and study -related procedures . 
3. For women of childbearing potential: agree to remain abstinent (refrain from 
heterosexual intercourse) or use a highly effective contraceptive method during the 
treatment period and for at least 18 weeks after the last dose of lebrikizumab or placebo.  
NOTE: A woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is defined as a postmenarcheal 
female, who has not reached a postmenopausal state (  12 continuous months of 
amenorrhea with no identified cause other than menopause) and has not undergone 
surgical sterilizat ion (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).  
NOTE: The following are highly effective contraceptive methods: combined (estrogen 
and progestogen containing) hormonal contraception (oral, intravaginal, transdermal) 
associated with inhibition of ovulation, progest ogen -only hormonal contraception (oral, 
injectable, implantable) associated with inhibition of ovulation, intrauterine device (IUD), 
intrauterine hormone -releasing system (IUS), bilateral tubal occlusion, bilateral tubal 
ligation, vasectomized partner, or sexual abstinence.  The reliability of sexual abstinence 
should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and 
usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, 
symptothermal, or postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of 
contraception.  
If the highly effective contraceptive methods are contraindicated or strictly declined by 
the patient, acceptable birth control methods may be considered. The se may include a 
combination of the following methods:  
• male or female condom with spermicide  and 
• cap, diaphragm, or sponge with spermicide . 
4. Male patients are not required to use any contraception except in compliance with 
specific local government stud y requirements .

emollient(s) taken/used at screening and throughout the study must be recorded. P atients should 
be instructed to consult with the Investigator prior to initiating any new medication (either self -
administered non -prescription drugs or prescription therapy prescribed by another physician) 
while participating in the study. The Investigato r is expected to examine the acceptability of all 
concomitant medications, topical preparations, and dietary supplements taken by patients 
participating in the trial.  
 Medication entries should be specific to product name (if a combination drug product) 
and spelled correctly.  
 The brand and specific product name for any over -the-counter emollient(s) should be 
noted and spelled correctly.  
 Information on the dose, unit, frequency, route of administration, start date, 
discontinuation date, indication, and reaso n for use will be recorded.  
 The use of any concomitant medication must relate to an AE listed on the AE electronic 
case report form ( eCRF ) or the patient's medical history unless it is a supplement or used 
as preventative care.  
6.1. Permitted and Prohibited Tr eatments and Procedures   
The use of concomitant medications for other medical conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, 
acute infections) is permitted during this study. Inhaled corticosteroids and bronchodilators to 
control asthma are permitted.  
Acute severe infections can be treated with systemic antibiotics, use of which must be recorded 
in the eCRF. However, chronic treatment with systemic antibiotics is not permitted.  
Live or live attenuated vaccines are not permitted  during the trial , but if taken, please contact 
sponsor  or designee  for additional guidance  and hold study drug for 12 weeks  post vaccination . 
The use of a tanning booth/parlor is not permitted during the trial.

current over -the-counter moisturize r regimen, if approved by the Investigator.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 35 6.3. Treatment s for AD   
Intermittent use of topical rescue medications (e.g., TCS, TCIs and PDE4 inhibitors) for AD is 
permitted for the tr eatment of disease flares during the trial.  
Patients coming from the TCS combination trial  DRM06 -AD06  and still on TCS use at the end 
of the parent study, may taper or stop TCS use, as needed. If AD lesions return or a patient 
experiences a flare, TCS trea tment may be resumed at the patient’s discretion. For patients 
coming from DRM06 -AD06,  TCS and TCI use will be recorded daily by the patient using an 
electronic diary , as indicated in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures  (Appendix  1). 
Patients who may require short -term systemic treatment for symptoms of AD will be assessed on 
a case -by-case basis and must be discussed with the Medical Monitor prior to initiating 
treatmen t.  
The introduction of medications or therapies for other medical conditions known to affect AD 
(e.g., mycophenolate -mofetil, IFN -y, Janus kinase inhibitors, cyclosporine, azathioprine, 
methotrexate, phototherapy, or photochemotherapy ) are not permitted d uring the study.  Extended 
use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of AD are prohibited and require permanent 
discontinuation of Investigational Product. They may be used only for the treatment of an AE 
(for example, worsening of existing conditio n, such as asthma flare). If used for >30 days, 
sponsor approval is required for the patient to remain in the study.  
Additional drugs are to be avoided du ring the study unless required to treat an AE or for the 
treatment of an ongoing medical problem. If t he need for concomitant medica tion arises, the 
investigato r should base decisions on the patient and clinica l factors. Any additional medi cation 
(including the limited use of therapeutic agent s which, if used under treatment reg imens other 
than for treatme nt an AE or for appropriate medical management, might be considered  therapies) 
whether prescription or over -the-counter, used at baseline and/or during the course  of the study, 
must be documented with the start and stop dates .  
Patients requiring long -term systemic treatment for symptoms of AD (e.g., non -responders) must 
be discontinued from the study.   
Cannabinoid treatments for AD are prohibited.  All medication use d for AD must be recorded in 
the eCRF.

Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 44 8. DETAILS OF ASSESSMEN TS  
8.1. Assessment of Efficacy   
Each patient’s AD will be assessed as specified in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures. 
Whenever possible, the same assessor should perform all assessments on a given patient.  
8.1.1.  Investigator Global Assessment (IGA)   
The IGA  is an instrument used to globally rate the severity of the patient’s AD and is based on a 
5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). The IGA score is selected using the descriptors 
below that best desc ribe the overall appearance of the lesions at a given time point. It is not 
necessary that all characteristics under morphological description be present.  Assessors must be 
trained and certified by the Sponsor prior to conducting this assessment. The IGA m ust be 
conducted prior to conducting the EASI  and BSA assessments.   
8.1.2.  Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI)   
The EASI is used to assess the severity and extent of AD; it is a composite index with scores 
ranging from 0 to 72, with the higher values indicating more severe and or extensive disease. 
A grade of 0 to 72 will be assessed by the Investigator or designee.  Assessors must be trained 
and certified by the Sponsor prior to c onducting this assessment.  
8.1.3.  Body Surface Area (BSA)   
The BSA assessment estimates the extent of disease or skin involvement with respect to AD and 
is expressed as a percentage of total body surface. BSA will be determined by the Investigator or 
designee using the patient palm = 1% rule.  Assessors must be trained and certified by the 
Sponsor prior to conducting this assessment.  
8.1.4.  Pruritus   
Pruritus will continue to be assessed by all patient s who evaluated pruritus as part of their parent 
trial participation using the same patient reported outcome instrument, the  Pruritus Numerical 
Rating Scale (NRS). The Prur itus NRS is an 11 -point scale used by patients to rate their worst 
itch severity over the past 24 hours with 0 indicating “No itch” and 10 indicating “Worst itch 
imaginable.”  Assessments will be recorded daily by the patient using an electronic diary  throu gh 
Week 52 . Data will be transferred to the clinical database.  
8.1.5.  Sleep -Loss   
Sleep -loss due to pruritus will continue to be assessed by all patients who evaluated sleep -loss as 
part of their parent trial participation using the same patient reported outcome instrument. 
Patients rate their sleep based on a 5 -point Likert scale [0 (not at all) to 4 (unable to sleep at all)]. 
Assessments will be recorded daily by the patient using an el ectronic diary  through Week 52 . 
Data will be transferred to the clinical database.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 45 8.1.6.  Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM)   
POEM will continue to be assessed by all patients who co mpleted a POEM assessment as part of 
their parent trial participation using the same patient reported outcome instrument. The POEM is 
a 7-item, validated, questionnaire used by the patient to assess disease symptoms over the last 
week. Patients are asked t o respond to questions on skin dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep 
loss, bleeding and weeping. All answers carry equal weight with a total possible score from 0 to 
28 (answers scored as: No days=0; 1‒ 2  days = 1; 3 -4 days = 2; 5‒6 days = 3; everyday  = 4). 
A high score is indicative of a poor quality of life. POEM responses will be captured using an 
electronic diary  through Week 52, then captured at site visits starting at Week 64,  and transferred 
into the clinical database.  
8.1.7.  Skin Pain Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)   
Skin Pain NRS (Newton et al. 2019) is a patient -administered, validated, 11 -point horizontal 
scale anchored at 0 and 10, with 0 representing “no pain” and 10 represen ting “worst pain 
imaginable.” Overall severity of a patient’s skin pain is indicated by selecting the number that 
best describes the worst level of skin pain in the past 24 hours.  
Skin Pain NRS will only be collected for patients continuing from DRM06 -AD1 8. Participants 
will record the Skin Pain NRS assessments daily using an electronic diary at home through Week 
52, as indicated in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures (Appendix  1).  
8.2. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY   
8.2.1.  Physical Examination   
A complete physical examination will be  conducted at baseline and at end -of-treatment and will 
cover general appearance, dermatological, head, ears, eyes, nose, throat, respiratory, 
cardiovascular, abdominal, neurological, musculoskeletal, and lymphatic body systems. Height 
and weight will also  be recorded.  
At other study visits, a symptom -directed physical examination may be conducted at the 
discretion  of the Investigator .  
8.2.2.  Vital Signs   
Vital signs, including body temperature, respiratory rate (breath per minute), pulse (beats per 
minute), and blood pressure (mmHg), will be obtained with the patient in the seated position, 
after sitting for at least 5 minutes. Any abnormal findings which are new or worsened in sever ity 
and clinically significant, in the opinion of the Investigator, will be recorded as an AE. Vital sign 
measurements will be recorded in the eCRF.  
8.2.3.  Laboratory Evaluations   
Labora tory tests will be analyzed using a central laboratory and include hematology with 
differential, serology, a standard chemistry panel (including liver -function tests), total 
cholesterol, standard urine testing, urine pregnancy test for women who are not po st-menopausal 
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 46 or surgically sterile  and estradiol or testosterone testing in adolescents . Blood and urine will be 
collected from each patient as specified in the Schedule of Visits and Procedures or as clinically 
indicated . Any laboratory re -testing, if ne eded, should be conducted using the central laboratory. 
Laboratory data will be transferred to the clinical database.  
All laboratory tests with values considered clinically significantly abnormal during participation 
in the study or within 28 days after th e last dose of study intervention should be repeated until 
the values return to normal or baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the 
investigator or medical monitor.  
 If such values do not return to normal  or baseline within a period  of time judged 
reasonable by the investigator, the etiology should be identified and the sponsor 
notified.  
 All protocol -required laboratory assessments must be conducted in accordance 
with the laboratory manual and Appendix  1. 
If laboratory values from non -protocol -specified laboratory assessments performed at the 
institution’s local laboratory require a change in participant management or are 
conside red clinically significant by the investigator (e.g., SAE or AE or dose 
modification), then the clinically significant results will be reported as an AE in the AE 
section of the eCRF.  
Blinding of laboratory test results  
Laboratory results that could unblin d the study will not be reported to investigative sites or other 
blinded personnel.

8.2.4.  Adverse  Events   
AEs will be monitored throughout the study. Patients will be instructed to inform the Investigator 
and/or study staff of any AEs. At each visit, patients will be asked ab out AEs in a non -specific 
manner using open -ended questions so as not to bias the response (e.g., How have you been 
since the last visit?). Specific inquiry regarding reported AEs will be conducted when applicable. 
All AEs will be documented and recorded i n the patient’s eCRF.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 48 Any patient who has an AE (serious or non -serious) will be evaluated by the Investigator and 
treated and followed until the symptom(s) return to normal or to clinically acceptable levels, as 
judged by the Investigator. A physician, ei ther at clinical site, or at a nearby hospital emergency 
room, will administer treatment for any serious AEs (SAEs), if necessary. When appropriate, 
medical tests and examinations will be performed to document resolution of event(s).  
8.2.4.1.  Reporting   
AEs that are ongoing at the  exit visit of the parent trial will be carried over and followed.  New 
AEs occurring from the time of consent to the end of study w ill be reported in the AE sectio n of 
the eCRF. All AEs will be individually recorded in the eCRF. Any condition present prior to 
administration of study drug and that worsens after administration of study drug should be 
reported as an AE. Information regarding the onset, duration, severi ty, action taken, outcome, 
and relationship to study drug will be recorded.  
New or worsening abnormal laboratory values and/or vital signs are to be recorded as AEs if 
they are considered to be of clinical significance by the Investigator or meet the crit eria of an 
SAE as described in Section  8.2.4.3 . Unless a diagnosis is available, signs and symptoms must 
be reported as individual AEs in the eCRF; a diagnosis is preferred.  
The severity of an AE will be designated as mild, moderate or severe. The term “severe” is used 
to describe the intensity of an  AE; the event itself, however, may be of relatively minor clinical 
significance (e.g., ‘severe’ upper respiratory infection). Severity is not the same as “serious”. 
Seriousness of AEs is based on the outcome/action of an AE. (Section  8.2.4.3 ) 
The relationship of the AE to the study treatment should be determined by the Investigator and 
will be based on the following two definitions:  
Not related : The AE is judged to not be associated with the study drug and is attributable to 
another cause.  
Related:  A causal relationship between the AE and the study drug is a reasonable possibility, 
i.e., there is evidence (e.g., dechallenge/rechallenge) or other clinical arguments to  suggest a 
causal relationship between the AE and study treatment.  
8.2.4.2.  Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)   
The following treatment emergent adverse events are being designate d adverse events of special 
interest (AESI):  
 conjunctivitis  
 herpes infection or zoster  
 parasitic infection or an infection related to an intracellular pathogen  
AESIs should be reported to the Sponsor or designee. Additional data will be collected for AESIs  
in the eCRF . Patient records must include any follow -up information regarding these AESIs.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 49 Study drug should be discontinued if an adverse event is deemed persistent and if continuation of 
study drug would not be in the best interest of the patient.  The investigator or designee may 
discuss discontinuation of study drug or dose changes with the Sponsor or designee prior to 
implementation.  
8.2.4.3.  Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)   
An SAE  is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that,  
 Results in death  
 Is in the opinion of the Investigator immediately life threatening (i.e., the patient is at 
immediate risk of death; it does not include a reaction that, had it occurred in a more 
sever e form, might have caused death)  
 Requires inpatient hospitalization or results in prolongation of an existing hospitalization  
 Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity  
 Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
 Is an important medical event that may not be immediately life -threatening, result 
in death, or require hospitalization, but based on appropriate medical judgment, it 
jeopardizes the patient, or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent 
one of the outcomes listed.  Examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, 
blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or 
the development of drug dependency or drug abuse . 
The Investigator should institute any clinically necessary supplementary investigation of SAE 
information. In the case of patient death, any post -mortem findings/reports will be requested.  
8.2.4.4.  Reporting of SAEs   
All SAEs, as defined in Section  8.2.4.3 , regardless of causal relationship, must be reported to the 
Sponsor or design ee within 24  hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the event. As soon as 
the Investigator becomes aware of an AE that meets the criteria for an SAE, the SAE should be 
documented to the extent that information is available.  
SAEs will be recorded from  the time of informed consent/assent until the end of the study. 
If, in the opinion of the Investigator, an SAE occurring outside the specified time window  
(i.e., following patient completion or terminations of the study) is deemed to be drug -related, the  
event should be reported with 24  hours.  
SAEs must be recorded on an SAE form. The minimum information required for SAE reporting 
includes the identity of the Principal Investigator ( PI), site number, patient number, event 
description, SAE term(s), reason why the event is considered serious (i.e., the seriousness 
criteria), and PI’s assessment of the relationship of the event to study drug. Additional SAE 
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 50 information including medications or other therapeutic measures used to treat the event, and the 
outcom e/resolution of the event should also be recorded on the SAE form.   
In all cases, the Investigator should continue to monitor the clinical situation and report all 
material facts relating to the progression or outcome of the SAE. The Investigator may be 
required to provide supplementary information as requested by the Sponsor or its designee.  
When reporting SAEs, the following additional points should be considered:  
 Although signs, symptoms, and tests that support the diagnosis of an SAE should be 
provided,  the Investigator should report the diagnosis or syndrome as the SAE term.  
 Death should not be reported as an SAE, but as an outcome of a specific SAE (unless the 
event preceding the death is unknown). If an autopsy was performed, the autopsy report 
should  be provided.  
Although most hospitalizations necessitate reporting of an SAE, some hospitalizations do not:  
 Hospitalization for elective or previously scheduled surgery, or for a procedure for a 
pre-existing condition that has not worsened after administr ation of study drug (e.g., a 
previously scheduled ventral hernia repair). SAEs must, however, be reported for any 
surgical or procedural complication that lead to prolongation of the hospitalization.  
 Events that result in hospital stays for observation of <24 hours and that do not require a 
therapeutic intervention/treatment (e.g., an emergency room visit for hematuria that 
results in a diagnosis of cystitis and discharge to home on oral antibiotics).  
The Sponsor will process and evaluate all SAEs as soon as the reports are received. For each 
SAE received, the Sponsor will determine whether the criteria for expedited reporting to relevant 
regulatory authorities have been met.  
The Sponsor will assess th e likelihood that each SAE is related to study treatment, with the 
current Investigator’s Brochure used as the reference document to assess expectedness of the 
event to study drug.  
Prompt notification by the investigator to the sponsor of a SAE is essentia l so that legal 
obligations and ethical responsibilities towards the safety of participants and the safety of a study 
intervention under clinical investigation are met.  
The sponsor has a legal responsibility to notify both the local regulatory authority an d other 
regulatory agencies about the safety of a study intervention under clinical investigation. The 
sponsor will comply with country -specific regulatory requirements relating to safety reporting to 
the regulatory authority, Institutional Review Boards ( IRB)/Independent Ethics Committees 
(IEC), and investigators.  
An investigator who receives an investigator safety report describing a SAE or other specific 
safety information (e.g., summary or listing of SAEs) from the sponsor will review and then file 
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 51 it along with the Investigator’s Brochure and will notify the IRB/IEC, if appropriate , according 
to local requirements.  
8.2.5.  Pregnancy   
The investigator should notify the Sponsor immediate ly regarding a pregnancy in a (1) female 
clinical trial patient or (2) female partner of a male clinical trial patient.  
Pregnant female patients must be withdrawn from study drug.  
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant or suspects she is pregnant by the male 
patient, the male patient will be advised by the study Investigator to have his female pregnant 
partner inform her treating physician immediately.  
The Investigator must perform medical assessments as clinically indicated and continue to follow 
the patient for ≥4  weeks after delivery. Medical details for both the mother and baby must be 
obtained.  
The Investigator must complete a study -specific Pregnancy Form upon confirmation of a 
pregnancy. Pregnancy reporting forms will be provided to the site.  
8.2.6.  Hypersensitivity Reactions   
Patients experiencing any hypersensitivity reaction should receive appropriate symptomatic 
medical care, as needed. Patients should be ins tructed to inform the site if a hypersensitivity 
reaction occurs. At the next study visit, a blood sample must be collected for immunogenicity 
analysis. The Sponsor or designee should be immediately consulted, particularly if the 
hypersensitivity reaction might be attributed to the study drug, and particularly if the reaction is 
severe, for discussions about discontinuing the study medication.   
8.2.7.  Hepatic Safety Monitoring   
Close hepa tic monitoring  
The laboratory tests listed in Appendix  2, including ALT , AST, ALP,TBL, direct bilirubin , GGT, 
and CK should be repeated within 48 to 72 hours, to confirm the abnormality and to determine 
whether it is increasing or decreasing, if these conditions occur:  
If a participant with baseline...  has the following elevations:  
ALT or AST <1.5 times ULN  ALT or AST ≥3 times ULN  
ALP <1.5 times ULN  ALP ≥2 times ULN  
TBL <1.5 times ULN  TBL ≥2 times ULN  
  
ALT or AST ≥1.5 times ULN  ALT or AST ≥2 times baseline  
ALP ≥1.5 times ULN  ALP ≥2 times baseline  
TBL ≥1.5  times  ULN  TBL ≥ 1.5 times  baseline (except for patients with 
Gilbert’s syndrome)  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 52 If the abnormality persists or worsens, clinical and laboratory monitoring and evaluation for the 
possible  causes of the abnormal liver tests should be initiated by the investigator in consultation 
with the sponsor’s designated medical monitor. At a minimu m, this evaluation should include a 
physical examination and a thorough medical history, including symptoms, recent illnesses (for 
example, heart failure, systemic infection, hypotension, or seizures), recent travel, history of 
concomitant medications (inc luding over -the-counter), herbal and dietary supplements, history of 
alcohol  drinking, and other substance abuse.  
Initially, monitoring of symptoms and hepatic biochemical tests should be done at a frequency of 
one to three  times weekly, based on the parti cipant’s clinical condition and hepatic biochemical 
tests. Subsequently, the frequency of monitoring may be lowered to once every 1 to 2 weeks, if 
the participant’s clinical condition and lab results stabilize. Monitoring of ALT, AST, ALP, and 
TBL should c ontinue until levels normalize or return to approximate baseline levels.  
Comprehensive hepatic evaluation  
A comprehensive  evaluation should be performed to search for possible causes of liver injury if 
these conditions occur:  
If a participant with baseline ... has the following elevations:  
ALT or AST <1.5 times ULN  ALT or AST ≥3 times ULN with hepatic signs  or symptoms*, or  
ALT or AST ≥5 times ULN  
ALP <1.5 times ULN  ALP ≥3 times ULN  
TBL <1.5 times ULN  TBL ≥2 times ULN  
  
ALT or AST ≥1.5 times ULN  ALT or  AST ≥2 times baseline with hepatic signs  or symptoms*, or 
ALT or AST ≥3 times baseline  
ALP ≥1.5 times ULN  ALP ≥2 times baseline  
TBL ≥1.5  times  ULN  TBL ≥ 2 times  baseline , except for patients with Gilbert’s syndrome  
*Hepatic signs  or symptoms are severe  fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant abdominal pain, 
fever, and/or rash.  
At a minimum, this evaluation should include a physical examination and a thorough medical 
history, as outlined above , as well as tests for prothrombin -time/INR (PT-INR); viral hepatitis A, 
B, C, and E; tests for autoimmune hepatitis ; and an abdominal imaging study , for example, 
ultrasound  or CT scan.  
Based on the participant’s history and initial results, further testing should be considered in 
consultation with the sponso r’s designated medical monitor, including tests for hepatitis D virus, 
cytomegalovirus, Epstein -Barr virus, acetaminophen levels, acetaminophen  protein adducts, 
urine toxicology screen, Wilson’s disease, blood alcohol levels, urinary ethyl  glucuronide, and  
serum phosphatidylethanol.  
Based on the circumstances and the investigator’s assessment of the participant’s clinical 
condition, the investigator should consider referring the participant for a 
hepatologist/ gastroenterologist  consultation, magnetic resona nce cholangiopancreatography, 
endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography, cardiac echocardiogram, or a liver biopsy.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 53 8.2.7.1.  Additional Hepatic Data Collection in Participants Who have Abnormal Liver 
Tests during the Study   
Additional  hepatic safety data collection (hepatic safety eCRF) should be performed for 
participants  who meet one or more of the following conditions:  
 Elevation of serum ALT to ≥5 times ULN on two or more consecutiv e blood tests , if 
baseline ALT is <1.5 times ULN  
o In participants with baseline ALT ≥1.5 times ULN, the threshold is ALT  ≥3 times 
baseline on two or more consecutive blood tests 
 Elevat ion of  TBL to ≥2 times ULN , if baseline TBL is <1.5 times ULN (except for  cases 
of known Gilbert’s syndrome)  
o In participants with baseline TBL ≥1.5 times ULN, the threshold should be 
TBL  ≥2 times baseline  
 Elevation of serum ALP to ≥2 times ULN on two or more consecutive blood tests , if 
baseline ALP <1.5 times ULN  
o In participants with baseline ALP ≥1.5 times ULN, the threshold is ALP  ≥2 times 
baseline on two or more consecutive blood tests  
 Hepatic event considered to be a n SAE , and  
 Discontinuation of study drug due to a hepatic event . 
Note  that the interval  between the  two consecutive blood tests should be at least 2 days.  
8.2.7.2.  Hepatitis B Testing and Monitoring   
HBV DNA results that are reported as positive or as detecting HBV  DNA, but HBV DNA is 
below the level of quantification: the sponsor’s designated medical monitor should be contacted 
regarding the study status of the participant. HBV DNA testing is to be repeated as soon as is 
feasible. If HBV DNA is confirmed as positive, the participant must be permanently 
discontinued from study drug.  
The participant is to be referred to, evaluated, and managed by a specialist physician with 
expertise in evaluation  and management of viral hepatitis prior to discontinuation of any 
immunomodulatory and/or immunosuppressive therapy, including study drug. Timing of 
discontinuation from study drug relative to the initiation of any antiviral treatment for hepatitis is 
to be based on the recommendation of the consulting specialist physician, in conjunction with the 
investigator, and aligned with medical guidelines and standard of care.  
8.2.7.3.  Hepatitis C Testing and Monitoring   
If HCV  RNA is detected during the study, the study drug will be per manently discontinued and 
the participant should receive appropriate follow -up medical care.  
8.2.8.  Infections and Opportunistic Infections   
Completion of the Infection eCRF is required  for each infection (with the exception of the 
common cold) reported as an AE or SAE. The sponsor will identify infections considered to be 
opportunistic based on the article by Winthrop et al. (2015 ).

A product complaint is any written, electronic, or oral communication that alleges a deficiency 
related to the identity, quality, durability, reliability, safety, effectiveness,  or performance of a 
Lilly product af ter it is released for distribution. When the ability to use the product safely is 
impacted, the following are also considered as product complaints:  
 deficiencies in labeling information, and  
 use errors for device or combination products due to ergonomic design elements of the 
product.  
Sponsor collects product complaints on investigational products and drug delivery systems used 
in clinical studies to ensure the safety of study participants, monitor quality, and facilitate 
process and product improvements.  
Complaints are also collected on comparators and other materials supplied, as required and 
instructed for the study.  
Participants will be instructed to contact the investigator as soon as possible if they have a 
complaint or problem with the study drug or  drug delivery system, so that the situation can be 
assessed.  
Product complaints will be reported by the investigator to the sponsor per instructions provided 
on the study -specific Product Complaint Form.   
All complaints associated with CT material and/or investigational device supplied by Lilly need 
to be reported within 24 hours of receipt of the complaint (see pharmacy manual). Updated 
product complaints  information should be reported as soon as possible upon site awareness  using 
the originally completed Product Complaint Form with all changes signed and dated by the 
investigator.  
8.3. PK and ADA Sampling   
Serum PK and ADA samples wil l be collected in all patients. Positive ADA results may be 
further evaluated for neutralizing antibodies. The procedural instructions will be provided in a 
separate PK and Serum Antibody Sampling manual.  
8.4. Study Termination   
The Sponsor has the right to terminate the study at any time. Should the study be terminated, the 
decision and reason will be communicated in writing by the Sponsor to the Investigator and 
request that all patie nts be discontinued. Patients should be scheduled for an Early Termination 
visit. The entire study will be stopped if:  
 Evidence has emerged that, in the collective opinion of the Investigators at each site with 
the concurrence of the Sponsor, or the sole o pinion of the Sponsor, continuation of the 
study is unnecessary or unethical  
 The stated objectives of the study are achieved  
 The Sponsor discontinues the development of the study drug  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 55 All data available for the patient at the time of study discontinuation must be recorded in the 
patient’s records and the eCRF.  
8.4.1.  Early Termination of Study Patients   
The Investigator will make reasonable effort s to keep each patient in the study. However, 
patients may terminate or be terminated early from the study for the following reasons:  
 Voluntarily withdrawal of consent to participate in the study participation, at any time . 
 Not achieving an EASI -50, from pa rent study baseline , by Week 16 , maintaining an 
EASI -50 response , or not achiev ing clinical benefit based on PI discretion should be 
terminated from this study.  
 Adverse event, laboratory abnormality or inter -current illness which, in the opinion of the 
Investigator, indicates that continued treatment and/or participation in the study is not in 
the best interest of the patient . 
 Enrollment in any other clinical study involving an investigational product or enrollment 
in any other type of medical research judg ed not to be scientifically or medically 
compatible with this study . 
 Patients requiring long -term systemic treatment for symptoms of AD (e.g., non -
responders) . 
 Serious protocol violation, persistent non -compliance or requirement for medication or 
procedure  prohibited by the protocol . 
 Lost to follow -up  
o Two attempts of contact (e.g., telephone contact) followed by a certified letter of 
contact to the patient must be documented in a patient’s study records for all 
patients who are believed to be lost to follo w-up. 
Patients who are terminated early from the study will have an Early Termination visit  
(Section  7.7) scheduled as soon as possible. All information, including the reason for early 
termination will be recorded in the patient’s study records and in the eCRF.  
8.4.2.  Discontinuation of Inadvertently Enrolled Patients   
If the sponsor or investigator identify a participant who did not meet enrollment criteria and was  
inadvertently enrolled, then the participant should be discontinued from the study unless there  
are extenuating circumstances that make it medically necessary for the participant to continue on  
study drug. If the investigator and the sponsor -designated medical monitor agree it is medically  
appropriate to continue, the investigator must obtain documented approval from the sponsor 
designated  medical monitor to allow the inadvertently enrolled participant to continue in the  
study.

Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 56 8.4.3.  Study Drug Discontinuation   
8.4.3.1.  Temporary Study Drug Discontinuation   
Some possible reasons for temporarily withholding the study drug include, but are not limited to:  
 HBV  DNA results that are reported as positive, or as detecting HBV DNA, but HBV 
DNA is below  the level of quantification: the sponsor’s designated medical monitor 
should be contacted regarding study status of the participant. HBV  DNA testing is to be 
repeated as soon as is feasible. If HBV DNA is confirmed as positive, the participant 
must be permanently discontinued from study drug.  
 Hepatic event or liver test abnormality: the study drug should be withheld and additional 
testing performed  following consultation with the Lilly -designated medical monitor, if 
the results of repeat tests following  elevated ALT, ALP , or TBL include one of the 
following:  
o ALT 3 times ULN and TBL <2 times ULN  
o ALP 2 times ULN and TBL <2 times ULN  
o TBL 2 times ULN without increase from baseline in ALT  or AST  or ALP.  
8.4.3.2.  Permanent Study Drug Discontinuation   
If HCV RNA is detected during the study, the study drug will be permanently discontinued, and 
the participant should receive appropriate follow -up medical care.  
Study drug must be discontinued f or patients who experience the following:  
 Inter -current illness that would, in the judgment of the Investigator, affect assessments of 
clinical status to a significant degree  
 Treatment -related AEs that are clinically significant, deemed persistent, in the judgment 
of the Investigator  
 Unacceptable toxicity  
 Pregnancy  
 The participant develops any of the following conditions during the study:  
o Malignancy , except for successfully treated basal or squamous cell skin 
carcinoma  
o Serious or opportunistic infection  that in the opinion of the investigator merits 
the study drug being discontinued. Such infections may include, but are not 
limited to:  
▪ HIV infection /acquired immune deficiency syndrome  
▪ active TB infection or untreated latent TB infection  
▪ HCV RNA positive  
▪ HBV DNA positive  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 57 NOTE: the HBV DNA result is to be confirmed if initial positive test 
result is positive but below the level of quantification. The participant is to 
be referred to, evaluated, and managed by a specialist physician with 
expertise in evaluat ion and management of viral hepatitis prior to 
discontinuation of any immunomodulatory and/or immunosuppressive 
therapy, including study drug. Timing of discontinuation from study drug 
relative to the initiation of any antiviral treatment for hepatitis is to be 
based on the recommendation of the consulting specialist physician, in 
conjunction with the investigator, and aligned with medical guidelines and 
standard of care.  
Participants who are discontinued from the study drug due to a hepatic event or liver test 
abnormality should have additional hepatic safety data collected via eCRF. Discontinuation of 
the study drug for abnormal liver tests should be considered by the investigator when a 
participant meets one of the following conditions after consultation with the sponsor -designated 
medical monitor:   
 ALT or AST ≥8 times ULN  
 ALT or AST ≥5 times ULN for more than 2 weeks  
 ALT or AST ≥3 times ULN and TBL ≥2 times ULN or international normalized ratio 
(INR) ≥1.5  
 ALT or AST ≥3 times ULN with the appearance of fat igue, nausea, vomiting, right upper  
quadrant abdominal pain or tenderness, fever, and/or rash  
 ALP ≥3 times ULN  
 ALP ≥2.5 times ULN and TBL ≥2 times ULN, or  
 ALP ≥2.5 times ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant abdominal p ain or tenderness, fever, and/or rash  
Patients who discontinue study drug permanently during study participation must be scheduled 
for an Early Termination visit . 
8.5. Data Safety Monitoring Board   
An independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) comprised of members who are 
independent of the study sponsor and study investigators will monitor patient safety by 
conducting formal reviews of accumulated safety data that is blinded by treatment group;  if 
requested, the DSMB may have access to the treatment allocation code or any other requested 
data for the purposes of a risk -benefit assessment.  
The DSMB will provide the sponsor with appropriate recommendations on the conduct of the 
clinical study to ensure the protection and safety of the patients enrolled in the study. The DSMB 
will also institute any measures that may be required for ensuring the integrity of the study 
results during the study execution.  
All activities and responsibilities of the D SMB are described in the DRM06 DSMB charter.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 58 9. STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS   
9.1. General Statistical Methodology   
All statistical processing will be performed using SAS® unless otherwise stated. This study is a 
blinded study until the parent  studies have had database lock and dosing for those studies is no 
longer blinded.  An unblinded interim will be performed to support regulatory submissions when 
the parent  studies have completed the treatment periods.  Additional interim analyses may also be 
performed for regulatory interactions, safety updates, and disclosures.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to provide an o verview of the efficacy and safety results. For  
categorical parameters, the number and percentage of patients in each category will be  presented. 
For continuous parameters, descriptive statistics will include n (number of patients ), mean, 
standard deviatio n, median, minimum and maximum.  
The Pruritus -NRS weekly mean will be calculated as follows: The mean of each patient’s 
baseline and post -baseline Pruritus -NRS scores will be computed for each week based on the 
previous 7 days. The weekly mean will be calcu lated if a patient has responses for Pruritus -NRS 
on at least 4 of the 7 days of the week. If the patient has 3 or fewer Pruritus -NRS responses, the 
mean value for that item will be considered missing.  All Pruritus -NRS efficacy endpoint 
analyses will be co nducted on the weekly mean.  
All safety data from this study will be used as part of integrated summaries, combining with data 
from the parent studies. For the purposes of the CSR for Study DRM06 -AD07, a listing and 
summary of SAEs  and AEs leading to perman ent discontinuation of study drug will be created.  
Demographic data will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics.  
The number of patients in each analysis set will be summarized. Reasons for study withdrawal  
and treatment withdrawal  during the study will be summarized using frequencies and 
percentages by treatment group.  
A statistical analysis plan, describing all statistical analyses will be provided as a separate 
document.  
9.1.1.  Populations Analyzed   
All entered patients are those who have signed informed consent. This population will be used 
for tables and/or listings of disposition that include screen failures and inclusion  or exclusion 
criteria.  
The ITT population con sists of a ll patients assigned to treatment, even if the patient does not take 
the assigned treatment, does not receive the correct treatment, or otherwise does not follow the 
protocol. The modified ITT (mITT) population is the ITT population excluding all patients from 
sites with  critical GCP noncompliance findings  related to participant eligibility . mITT population 
will be used to summarize patient disposition, demographics, and efficacy analyses, plus to list 
patient data.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 59 All patients who r eceive at least one confirmed dose of lebrikizumab will be included in the 
Safety Population . The modified Safety (mSafety) population  is the Safety population  excluding 
all patients from sites with critical GCP noncompliance findings  related to partici pant eli gibility . 
Demographics, extent of exposure, treatment compliance, prior  or concomitant medication use, 
adverse event, and immunogenicity safety analyses will be performed using the mSafety 
Population. A sub -group analys is of safety in patients under  18 years of age  (adolescents)  will be 
conducted as  appropriate.  
The number of patients included in the mSafety population will be summarized.  
9.1.2.  Baseline Definition   
The baseline used for efficacy and immunogenicity endpoints is the parent study baseline .  
9.2. EFFICACY  ASSESSMENTS   
The following efficacy assessments will be  summarized at each visi t, compared to parent study 
baseline : 
 Proportion of patients with Investigator’s Global Assessment (IGA) score = 0 or 1 at each 
visit 
 Proportion of patients with Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) -75 (≥75% reduction 
in EASI scores) at each visit  
 Change and percent change in EASI score at each visit  
 Proportion of patients with EASI -50 and EASI -90 scores at each visit   
 Percentage of patients who achieve a ≥4 -point reduction in the Pruritus NRS score  at 
prespecified time points  (for studies in which these data were collected)  
 Percentage change in Pruritus NRS score at prespecified time points (for studies in which 
these data were collected)   
 Percentage change  in Skin Pain NRS score at prespecified time points (for studies in 
which these data were collected)  
 Change in sleep -loss at prespecified time points (for studies in which these data were 
collected)  
 Change in POEM scores at prespecified time points through the end of study  (for studies 
in which these data were collected)  
 Change in BSA at pres pecified time points through the end of study  
 Proportion of patients requiring AD concomitant treatment  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 60 9.3. Exposure and Compliance   
Exposure to lebrikizumab from the patient’s parent  study and from study KGAA will be 
combined for reporting the extent of exposure. The extent of exposure to study drug in each 
treatment group will be summarized by total number of days of exposure, total number of 
injections, number of missed injections, and study drug total dose.  
The number and percentage of patients who are compliant  will be summarized . The treatment 
compliance calculation is defined as the  percentage of the  total number of injections  
administered  out of the expected  number of injections . A patient will be considered compliant 
with the dosing regimen if the patient received ≥75% of the expected number of injections while 
enrolled in the study.  
9.4. Adverse Events   
The primary endpoint of study DRM06 -AD07 is the proportion of patients discontinued from 
study treatment due to adverse events through the last treatment visit. This proportion will be 
calculated on the Safety Population from  Day 1  to Week 100. For interim an alysis, the 
calculation will be based on all data before interim DBL.  
All AEs occurring during the study will be recorded and coded using the Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities ( MedDRA ) dictionary.  
SAEs and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation o f study drug will be summarized by 
system organ class  and preferred term  in the Safety Population. All SAEs as well as AEs that led 
to permanent discontinuation of study drug  will be listed by patient.  
The data from all studies will be poo led by treatment, 250 mg lebrikizumab Q2W,  250 mg 
lebrikizumab Q4W, and 250 mg lebrikizumab overall.  
The AE data from this study will also be used as part of integrated safety assessments and  
ongoing safety review through study end.  
9.5. Other Safety Data   
The vital sign s and laboratory data from this study will be used as part of integrated safety 
assessments and ongoing safety review through study end.   
Medical histories will be coded using the MedDRA dictionary and presented in a by -patient 
listing. Concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization  Drug 
dictionary. Concomitant medications will be summarized by treatment, drug clas s, and preferred 
term. Physical examination data will be presented in a by -patient listing.  
9.6. Sample -Size Determination   
Sample size  is based on the number of patients who completed  studies DRM06 -AD04, 
DRM06 -AD05, DRM06 -AD06, DRM06 -AD17, and DRM06 -AD18 who choose to participate in 
the study who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria.  It is estimated that approximately 900 
patients may enroll from the parent studies.

10.1. Compliance with the Protocol   
The study shall be conducted as described in this protocol. All revisions to the protocol must be 
prepared by the Sponsor. The Investigator will not implement any deviation or change to the 
protocol without prior review and documented approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/IEC of 
an amendment, except where necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to study patien ts. 
Any significant deviation must be documented and submitted to the IRB/IEC, the Sponsor or 
designee, and, if required, Regulatory Authority(ies). Documentation of approval signed by the 
chairperson or designee of the IRB(s)/EC(s) must be sent to the Spo nsor and/or designee.  
10.2. Informed Consent Procedures   
The Informed Consent Form (ICF) will include all elements required by ICH/GCP and 
applicable regulatory requirements and will ad here to GCP and to the ethical principles that have 
their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. The consent form will also include a statement that 
the Sponsor and regulatory authorities have direct access to patient records.  
Prior to the beginning of th e study, the Investigator will have the IRB/IEC’s written opinion 
(approval/favorable) of the written informed consent form and any other information to be 
provided to the patients.  
The Investigator must provide the patient or legally acceptable representa tive with a copy of the 
consent form and written information about the study in the language in which the patient is most 
proficient. The language must be non -technical and easily understood. The Investigator should 
allow time necessary for patient or pati ent's legally acceptable representative to inquire about the 
details of the study, then informed consent must be signed and personally dated by the patient or 
the patient's legally acceptable representative, by the Investigator and/or by the person who 
conducted the informed consent discussion. The patient or legally acceptable representative 
should receive a copy of the signed informed consent and any other written information provided 
to study patients prior to patient's participation in the study.  
For pa tients considered to be minors according to the national legislation in each country, the 
written consent of the parent or legal guardian must be obtained, as well as the assent of the 
minor according to his or her capacity to understand the information pr ovided. Patients enrolled 
as minors who attain legal adulthood during the course of the study must consent in their own 
right at that time in order to continue participating.  
The informed consent and any other information provided to patients or the patien t's legally 
acceptable representative, should be revised whenever important new information becomes 
available that is relevant to the patient's consent, and should receive IRB/IEC approval/ favorable 
opinion prior to use. The Investigator, or a person desi gnated by the Investigator should fully 
inform the patient or the patient's legally acceptable representative of all pertinent aspects of the 
study and of any new information relevant to the patient's willingness to continue participation in 
the study. Thi s communication to the patient should be documented in the source note.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 63 During a patient's participation in the study, any updates to the consent form or to the written 
information will be provided to the patient in writing.  
10.3. Data Protection  and Confidenti ality   
Study patients must be informed that his/her personal study -related data will be used by the 
sponsor in accordance with local data protection law. The level of disclosure m ust also be 
explained to the patient who will be required to give consent for their data to be used as 
described in the informed consent.  
Patients must be informed that his/her medical records may be examined by Clinical Quality 
Assurance auditors or othe r authorized personnel appointed by the sponsor, by appropriate 
IRB/IEC members, and by inspectors from regulatory authorities.  
Participants will be assigned a unique identifier by the sponsor. Any participant records, datasets 
or tissue samples that are t ransferred to the sponsor will contain the identifier only; participant 
names or any information which would make the participant identifiable will not be transferred.  
The Sponsor has processes in place to ensure data protection, information security and d ata 
integrity.  These processes include appropriate contingency plan(s) for appropriate and timely 
response in the event of a data security breach.  
10.4. Study Documentation and the eCRF   
This protocol is to be signed by the investigator responsible for the conduct of this study at the 
study site. A copy of the signed protocol signature page is to be provided to the Sponsor and 
retained in the study site’s Regulatory Binder.  
The Investig ator is responsible for ensuring that all study data is accurately recorded on the 
eCRFs or other study data collection tools. All eCRF entries must be supported by the patient’s 
medical records or source notes. The Investigator must ensure that study  observations and 
findings are legible and recorded accurately and completely.  
Original reports, traces and films must be reviewed, signed and dated, and retained by the 
Investigator for future reference.  
The Investigator is expected to promptly review all stu dy data recorded in the patient’s source 
records. Completed eCRFs must be promptly reviewed, signed, and dated by the Investigator or 
Sub-Investigator at the end of the study. Corrections to data entered into the eCRF will be 
handled through an electronic query. Corrections to patients’ medical or source records should be 
legible, initialed and dated. At the end of the study, an electronic copy of the investigator’s 
eCRFs will be provided to the Investigator. The Investigator is to retain this data. The 
Investigator will maintain a signature sheet to document signatures and initials of all persons 
authorized to make entries and/or corrections on eCRFs. Refer to Section  10.6 regarding 
retention requirements.  
Approved on 14 Dec 2022 GMT
Dermira, Inc.  Confidential   Page 64 An Investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories designed 
to record all observations and other data pertinent to the investigation for each patient treated 
with the study drug or entered as a control in the investigation. Data reported on the eCRFs that 
are derived from source documents must be consistent with the source documents or the 
discrepancies must be explained.  
10.5. Study Monitoring   
The Sponsor or designee will be responsible for the monitoring of the study. Study monitors will 
contact and visit the Investigators at regular intervals throughout the study to verify adherence to 
the protocol, and assess the completeness, consistency, and accuracy of the data by comparing 
patients’ medical records with entries in the eCRF.  
The study monitor must be allowed access to laboratory test reports and other patient records 
needed to verify th e entries on the eCRF, provided patient confidentiality is maintained in 
accordance with local requirements. These records, and other relevant data, may also be 
reviewed by appropriate qualified personnel independent from the Sponsor or designee, who is 
appointed to audit the study. Patient confidentiality will be maintained at all times.  
By agreeing to participate in this research study, the Investigators agree to co -operate with the 
study monitor to ensure that any problems detected during the monitoring visits are promptly 
resolved.  
10.6. Retention of Study Documentation   
The Investigator must retain study drug disposition records, copies of CRFs and all study -related 
source documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulations and guidelines, or 
Institution procedures, or for the period specified by the Sponsor, whichever is longer. The 
Investigator must contact the Sponsor prior to destroying any records associated with the study.  
If the Investigator withdraws from the study (e.g., relocation, retirement), the records shall be 
transferred to a mutually agreed upon designee (e.g., another Investigator, IRB). Notice of such 
transfer will be given in writing to the Sponsor o r designee.  
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement for any or all the documents at the 
investigational site, arrangements must be made between the Investigator and the Sponsor to 
store these in a secure archive facility outside the  site so they can be returned to the Investigator 
in case of a regulatory audit. When source documents are required for the continued care of the 
patient, appropriate copies should be made for storage outside of the site.  
10.7. Publication Policy   
In accordance with the sponsor’s publication policy the results of this study will be submitted for 
publication by a peer -reviewed journal.

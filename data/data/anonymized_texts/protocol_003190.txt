Statistical Analysis 
For bone radiographic bone height analysis, ten subjects per group will provide 80% power to detect an effect size of 
1.4 on newly formed bone using an independent two group t-test with a 5% two-sided significance level. An 
exploratory analysis was carried out to verify the normality supposition by Shapiro-Wilk. Non-parametric distribution 
was observed for the variables of bone and new bone percentage measurements; however, biomaterial data was 
classified with a Gaussian distribution. Thus, Mann-Whitney and T-test were applied for intergroup comparisons, 
Plot software was used for statistical analysis.

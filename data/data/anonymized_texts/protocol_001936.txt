1.0 PROTOCOL SUMMARY A ND/OR SC HEMA  
 
This is a Multicenter Pha se II study of dose-dense (DD)  gemcitabine and cisplatin (GC) 
neoadju vant chemotherapy  in patients with muscle-invasive bladder  cancer (MIBC)  who 
are candida tes for radical cystectomy. Patients  will receive six cycles of GC administered 
every 14 days. Gem citabine  2,500 mg/ m2 will be admini stered intravenou sly on day 1 and 
cisplatin 35 mg/m2 will be admini stered intravenou sly on days 1 and 2 of a 14 days cycle 
(with Peg G-CSF).  A total of six cycles of thera py will be admini stered followed  by radical 
cystectomy  with bilater al pelvic lymph node  dissection (PLND). The primary  objective of 
this phase II trial will be to deter mine the patholo gic response rate (< pT2)  of this regimen.

3.0 BACKGROUND A ND RATIO NALE 
 
Bladder  cancer is the second most common  genitourinary malignan cy. The American 
Cancer Society estimat es 69,250  new cases and 14,990  deaths  in the United  States  for 
the  year 2011 .1   The prevalence of  bladder  cancer is  estimated  to  be  appro ximately  
600,000  cases and management  of this disease costs $3 billion in healthcare expenditure  
annually  compared  with  $1  billion  for   prostate cancer. The  most  difficult patients  to 
manage  are those with muscle-invasive disease; despite surgery  with curative intent 
(radical cystectomy  and bilateral  pelvic lymph node  dissection),  appro ximately 50% of 
patients  with  muscle-invasive  bladder  cancer  will  develop  distant  meta stases  and 
succumb to their disease.2  Over the past two decades, attempts to impro ve outcomes 
have focused on the addition  of  perioperati ve chemotherapy  in  ho pes of  eradi cating

 micrometa static disease and reducing the risk of relap se. Trials exploring  chemotherapy  in 
the adjuvant setting  have yielded  inconclusive results as these trials were  largely 
underpowered  and/or  utilized  suboptimal  chemotherapeutic  regimen s.3-5   Neoad juvant 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy  prior  to  radical  cystectomy has  been  demon strated  to 
reduce the risk of relapse and improve overall survival (OS)  in multiple  clinical trials and a 
meta -analysis. 
 
3.1 Neoadjuvant  Cisplatin -Based  Chemothe rapy for MIBC Improves  Outcomes  
 
Cisplatin  is the only chemotherapeutic agent  associated with a survival benefit  in any 
urothelial  cancer disease state. In the neoadju vant setting,  a survival benefit  with cisplatin - 
based combination  chemotherapy  has been  confirmed  in two large  randomi zed clinical 
trials  and a meta -analysis of over 3,000 patients .6-8 These data clearly  establish cisplatin- 
based neoadju vant chemotherapy  as the standard of care for patients  with MIBC who are 
being  considered  for radical cystectomy. 
 
The most common ly studied  neoadjuvant regimen  reported  in the literature  is MVAC 
(methotre xate, vinbla stine, doxorubi cin, and  cisplatin),  a standard  of care for patien ts with 
meta static disease.9    The Southwe st Oncology  Group  (SWOG)-8710 trial  randomi zed 
patients  with stage T2–T4aN0 bl adder cancer to receive either  three  cycles of MVAC 
followed  by radical cystectomy  or radical cystectomy  alone.10  Disease specific survival 
was superi or for patien ts receiving neoadju vant MV AC (HR=1.66,  95% CI, 1.22–2.45, 
p=0.002).  There was a trend  toward superior  OS (HR= 1.33, 95% CI, 1.00–1.76) for 
patients tre ated with  MVAC as compared  to patients managed  with surgery alone,  with an 
OS of 57% and 43% at 5 years, respectively (p=0.06).  Furthermore,  pathologic  response 
to neoadju vant chemotherapy  predicted for clinical outcomes.  Patients  without  residual 
disease (pT0) at cystectomy had  an impro ved 5-year survival (85%)  over those who had 
residual  disease, and patients in the MVAC  arm more  frequently  achieved pT0 status 
(38%  vs 15%,  p<0.001) .10 
 
Recently, updated  long-term results from the MRC/EORTC randomi zed Phase III trial of 
neoadju vant cisplatin, methotre xate, and  vinbla stine (CMV)  reported  impro ved outcomes 
associated with neoad juvant cisplatin, methotre xate, and  vinbla stine (CMV)  prior to 
definiti ve therapy  for MIBC.   Neoadju vant CMV  was associated with a 16% relati ve 
impro vement in survival (p=0.037)  and 23% relati ve improvement  in meta stasis-free 
survival (p=0.001)  at 10 years.11  Notably,  the survival benefit  observed with neoad juvant 
chemotherapy in  bladder  cancer is similar  to the survival benefit  observed with adju vant 
chemotherapy  in early  studies  perfo rmed in breast and colon cancer (Table 1).

3.2 Role  for Gemcitabine  and Cisplatin  in the Neoadjuvant  Setting  
 
The MVAC  regimen  has long repre sented a  standard  of care for the treatment  of patients 
with advanced/meta static urothel ial cancer.9      With the advent of newer  agent s, 
investigato rs focused on developi ng regimens  with similar  efficacy but less toxicity than 
MVAC. In a large  randomi zed trial,  the combination of  gemcitabine  and cisplatin (GC) 
proved to have similar  efficacy and less toxicity than MVAC and now repre sents the 
standard  of care for patients  with meta static urothelial  cancer.15    While  tolerability of 
chemotherapy impro ved with the GC regim en, the efficacy of therapy  (response and 
survival) for patien ts with meta static urothelial  cancer did not change  substantiall y. 
 
As GC is better tolerated  and achieves similar  response and  survival rates  to MVAC in 
meta static urothelial  cancer, it is frequently u sed as a substitute for  MVAC  in the 
neoadju vant setting.   Howe ver, GC has not been  prospectively e valuated  in the 
neoadju vant setting.  At MSKCC, pathologic  response rate in 42 patients treated  with 
neoadju vant GC was retro spectively compared  to patholog ic response rate in 54 patients 
treated  with neoadju vant MVAC  prior to definitive surgery.16 Pathologic  response rate, 
defined  as eradi cation of  muscle invasive disease (<pT2)  at cystectomy, was similar  for 
patients  receiving GC (15/4 2; 36%,  95% CI 21-52%)  and MVAC  (19/5 4; 35%,  95% CI 23- 
49).  Furth ermore,  achieving complete  patholo gic response (pT0)  for patients  treated with 
GC (11/4 2; 26%,  95% CI 14-42) was also similar  to MVAC  (15/ 54; 28%,  95% CI 16-42). 
 
Patients  treated with GC received 4 cycles of therapy on  one of two 21-day dosing 
schedules  for 12 weeks: 1.) a standard  single dose schedule  with gemcitabine  1000 
mg/m2 and cisplatin 70 mg/m2 on day 1 and gemcitabine  1000 mg/m2 on day 8; or 2.) a 
“split-dose” schedule  with gemcitabine  1000  mg/m2 and cisplatin 35 mg/mg2 on day 1 and 
day 8.   Under these two dosing schedule s, the achieved median  dose delivered  for 
cisplatin was 91% and for gemcitabine  was 90%.  Treat ment was well-tolerated.  These 
data support  the use of a 21-day schedule  of GC in the neoadju vant setting  for MIBC. 
Unfortunatel y, despite the use of better tolera ted neoadj uvant chemotherap y, outcomes 
have not significantly changed  and a large  proportion  of patients  ultimately  recur. Novel 
neoadju vant treatment  strategies  are needed  to impro ve outcomes. 
 
3.3 Rationale  for Dose  Dense  Chemothera py 
 
Potential  incremental  benefits  in disease-free survival (DFS) and OS have been  observed 
in clinical trials  utilizing higher  doses (dose inten se) and more  frequent admini stration 
(dose dense) of chemotherapeutic  agent s.17 This is especially true for women  with high - 
risk breast cancer, where  dose dense therapy  has become a main stay in the adjuvant 
setting.18 
 
The Cancer and  Leukemia  Group  B (CAL GB) 9741  phase III randomi zed trial evaluated a 
dose-dense chemotherapy  approa ch using concurrent  doxorubicin and cyclopho sphamide 
followed  by paclitaxel in the adjuvant treatment  of women  with lymph node -positive early - 
stage breast cancer.19 This trial demon strated  a significant impro vement  in DFS and OS in 
the dose-dense chemotherapy ar m, which has subsequently  become the adjuvant 
treatment  standard  for patients  with early -stage breast cancer.18 
 
Bonilla,  et al. condu cted a meta -analysis of randomi zed trials  investigating  dose-dense 
chemotherapy  in non-metastatic breast cancer. Ten trials  met the inclusion criteria and 
were  classified into two  categories  based on trial methodolog y. Three  trials  enrolli ng 3,337 
patients  compared  dose-dense chemotherapy  with a conventional  chemotherapy  schedu le 
using similar chemotherapeutic  agents. Patients  who received dose-dense chemotherapy

 had longer  OS (HR=0.84, 95% CI 0.72-0.98, p=0.03)  and longer  DFS (HR=0.8 3, 95% 
CI=0.73 -0.94,  p=0.005)  than patients  receiving similar  chemotherapy  on a conventional 
schedule.  Seven trials  enrolling  8,652 patients  compared  dose-dense chemotherapy wi th 
regimens t hat use standard intervals but  with different  agen ts and/or  dosages in  the treat - 
ment  arms. Similar  results were  obtained  for these trials  with respect to OS (HR=0.85,

3.4 Higher  Dose  Dens ity of Cispl atin May be Associated  with Improved Outc omes in 
Advanced  Urothelial  Cancer.  
 
In meta static urothelial cancer, Sternberg, et  al. were  first to report  a potential  benefit of 
high dose intensity chemotherapy  in a phase III randomi zed trial of high dose MVAC  (HD 
MVAC) plus G-CSF versus conventional  MVAC.20     In actuality, the doses of MVAC  were 
identi cal in both arm s, but the “high dose” arm was admin istered  at 2 week  intervals rather 
than 4 week intervals for standard  MVAC.   After a medi an follow  up of 7.3 years, HD 
MVAC was associated with a significant relative reduction in the risk of progre ssion (p= 
0.017)  and death  (p=0.042)  compared  to MVAC.21 
 
Bamia s, et al. recently  reported  the results of a phase III randomi zed trial evaluati ng do se 
dense MVAC  (DD MVAC) versus DD  GC in patients  with inoperable  or recurrent  urothelial 
cancer.22 Patients  were  randomi zed to receive MVAC (30 mg/m2; 3 mg/m2; 30 mg/m2; 70 
mg/m2) or GC (gem citabine  2500  mg/m2 day 1 plus cisplatin 35 mg m2 days 1 and 2 with 
G-CSF)  every two weeks for a planned 6  cycles.  Overall response rate and survival were 
similar  for both treatment  arms: 65% and median  18.4 months respectively for patients 
treated  with DD GC and 63% and median  18.0 months  respectively for patients  treated 
with DD MVAC.   However, DD GC was better  tolerated  than DD MVAC, leading  the 
authors  to conclude DD  GC could repre sent another  treatment  standard  for advanced 
disease.  Importantl y, the OS reported  for both arms  in this trial using two dose dense 
regimens  appears  to be substantially better  than previously reported  with other  cisplatin - 
based regimens  admini stered in  standard  schedules, suggesting a benefit  to dose dense 
chemotherap y.15 
 
These data sugge st that higher  dose density cisplatin  may be associated with  impro ved 
response rate and survival in advanced urothel ial cancer, and thus, supports  its study in 
the neoadj uvant setting  (Table  2).

3.5 Neoadjuvant  Dose  Dense  Cisplatin -Based  Chemothera py in MIBC 
 
To date,  no prospective trials  have evaluated  dose dense chemotherapy  in the 
neoadju vant setting  in MIBC. However, two retro spective experien ces using MVAC were 
recently  presented  at the 2011  ASCO Genitourinary  Cancers Symposium and the 2011  
ASCO Annual Meeting  that sugge st a dose dense approa ch may impro ve clinical 
outcomes  (Table  3).

These retrospective data sugge st that neoadju vant dose dense chemotherapy  may 
increase response rate (43-50% CR rate for DD MVAC vs 38% for standard MVAC), in a 
manner  similar to that observed with its use in advanced disease, further  strengtheni ng 
the rationale  for the prospective approa ch outlin ed in this clinical trial. 
 
3.6 Rationale  for Neoadjuvant  DD GC in MIBC 
 
Neoadju vant GC  is similar  to MVAC with regards  to pathol ogic response rates  and offers 
an advantage  with respect to tolerab ility.  Admini stering  standard do ses of cisplatin-based 
chemotherapy  over a shorter  period  of time (i.e. higher  dose density) potentially impro ves 
response rate and offers  a survival advantage  without  comprom ising safety or tolerabilit y. 
 
The current  trial seeks to explore  the inten sified regimen  of gemcitabine  and cisplatin in 
the neoadj uvant setting  in patients  with MIBC.  This trial is supported  by the following 
rationale:  
 
• Neoadju vant cisplatin-based thera py has improved survival over cystectomy  alone  in 
patients  with MIBC.  
 
• Since the survival benefit  is greate st in patients  achieving response to chemotherap y, 
strategies  to increase response rates of active regimens  is warranted.  
 
• Dose-dense cisplatin chemotherapy  increases response rate for patients  with 
meta static bladder  cancer. 
 
• DD GC is the best tolerated dose dense regimen.  
 
• DD GC is a logical candidate for prospective study in the neoadju vant setting.

 3.7 Pathologic  Response  to Chemothera py as an Endpoint  of Clinical  Effica cy 
 
3.7.1  Pathologic  Response  (<pT2)  
 
Muscle-invasive bladder  cancer, defined as pathologic  evidence of muscle invasion (pT2) 
on biopsy specimen,  is the major  indication  for neoadju vant chemotherapy  prior to radical 
cystectomy.   Pathologic  response to neoad juvant chemotherapy can be defined  as 
absence of any residual  muscle invasive disease at the time of cystectomy (<  pT2) and 
includes  pT1, pTcis, pTa, and T0 disease.  Due to the multi-focal nature  of this disease, it 
is very common at both pre -chemo therapy  and po st-chemotherapy  evaluations  to see pre- 
existing and/or  residual  superfi cial transitional cell carcinoma such as Tcis, Ta or T1 
disease (frequently  collectively defined  as < pT2).  The likelihood  of residual  superficial 
disease is also directly related  to the extent of the TURBT  prior to neoadjuvant 
chemotherap y.  Superfi cial disease, and in particular Tcis, is typically unresponsive to 
chemotherap y, non -life threatening,  and frequently  included within  the definition  of major 
chemotherapy re sponse. The prognostic value of defining response to neoa djuvant 
chemotherapy in  MIBC  as <pT2  in contra st to solely pT0 (complete  pathologic  response) 
was first shown  in an analysis by  Splinter et  al. of 147 patients treated  with neoadju vant 
chemotherapy prior  to radical cystectomy  at eight  different centers.27     This study 
demon strated  that patie nts with MIBC  who achieved < pT2 (including  pT0, pTcis, pTa, and 
pT1)  after neo-adjuvant chemotherapy  achieved 75% survival at 5 years in contrast to 
20% survival for those whose tumors still harbored  continued  muscle-invasion ( > pT2 
residual  disease). 
 
The comparable  survival rates  of patients  achieving patholog ical complete response (pT0) 
and patients  achieving partial  pathologic re sponse (<pT2)  has been  validated  in a prior, 
independent  study at MSKCC.28   In a trial of  111 patients  treated with neo-adjuvant MVAC 
at MSKCC, outcome analysis showed a similar  survival benefit  from chemotherapy  for 
those  patients  achieving  <   pT2   (pT0,  pTa,   pTcis,  and   pT1)  after   neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy  and for those achieving the status of pT0.  This experience confir ms the 
findings  of Splinter  et al. 
 
3.7.2   Rationale  for Response  Rates  used  in Study Design  
 
This trial will aim to test a 20% impro vement  on the average pathol ogic response rate 
reported  with conventional  schedu le cisplatin-based neoad juvant chemotherapy regimens 
of appro ximately  35%.  Thus, a “promising” pat hological response rate for DD GC of 55% 
would  warrant further  study of this regimen.    The average pathol ogic re sponse rate 
associated with conventional  schedule cisplatin-based chemotherapy  was determined  by 
data from a prior MSKCC  retro spective study and two large  intergroup  randomi zed 
neoadju vant trials.6,8,29        At MSKCC, the pathologi cal response rate (<pT2)  was 36%  for 
patients  treated with neoadju vant GC and 35% for patients treated  with neoad juvant 
MVAC.  In the MRC/ EORTC trial, the patholog ic response rate was 27% (95%  CI 21-33) 
for the 246 patients r eceiving neo adjuvant chemotherapy  by an intent -to-treat analysis.  In 
the SWOG  8710  trial, the patholog ic response rate  was 32% (95%  CI 25-40) for the 153 
patients  randomi zed to neoadju vant MVAC chemotherap y, also using an intent -to-treat 
analysis. 
 
It is well known that pathologic  response rate  can be subject to the completene ss of the 
initial  transurethral  resection of the bladder  tumor (TUR BT) at diagnosis, and thus, can 
vary based on the surgeon performing  the procedure.  For example,  in the SWOG  8710 
randomi zed trial,  15% of patients  randomi zed to  surgery  alone  had a complete  pathologic 
response at the time of cystectomy.  Thus, the pathologic  response rate after neoadju vant 
chemotherapy  can also similarly vary based on the completeness of the initial  TURBT.

 Howe ver, the MSKCC experien ce reported  by Dash et al. demon strates  similar  pathologic 
outcomes  to those reported by prospective randomi zed studies. 
 
This proto col, like our prior MSKCC neoadju vant studies  and those at other center s, will 
examine  pathologic  response (<pT2)  after chemotherapy  as the endpoint  of efficacy. 
 
 
4.0 OVERVI EW OF STUDY D ESIGN/INTER VENTION  
 
4.1     Design  
 
This is a multicenter  phase II study of neoadju vant DD GC in patients  with MIBC  prior to 
radical cystectomy. Patients with biopsy proven MIBC who are candidates  for radical 
cystectomy  will be enrol led and will receive six 14-day cycles of DD GC. Toxicity and 
interval response will be assessed during  treatment.  Follow ing treatment,  patients  will 
undergo  radical cystectomy and bilateral  pelvic lymph node  dissection and the surgical 
specimens  will be assessed for pathologic  response to therapy. Patients  will be followed 
for five years or until disease recurrence/progr ession. 
 
4.2     Interventi on 
 
Patients  will receive six cycles of GC admini stered e very 14 days followed  by radical 
cystectomy. Gem citabine  2,500  mg/m2  will be admini stered  intravenou sly on day 1 and 
cisplatin 35  mg/m2 will be admini stered intravenou sly on days 1 and 2 every 14 days for 6 
cycles (for a total of 12 weeks) with G-CSF support. The primary obje ctive of this phase II 
trial will estimate  the pathologic  response rate of this regimen.  
 
5.0 THERAPEUTIC/DIAGNOSTIC AGENTS  
 
5.1 Gemcitabine  (GEMZAR®): 
 
5.1.1  Gem citabine  is a pyrimidine  analogue  of deoxycytidine in  which the deoxyribose 
moiety  contains 2 fluorine atoms  at the 2’position. The  drug acts as an inhibi tor to 
ribonu cleotide reductase and inhib ition of DNA synthesis may result in perturbations  of 
deoxynucleotide  pools and interfe rence with DNA chain elongation.  The drug is cell-cycle 
specific and blocks cells in the G1/S  interfa ce. Cytotoxicity is schedule dependent  and 
increases with  increasing  durati on  of  exposure.  The  drug  is  rapidly  eliminated  from 
plasma, owing  mainly  to deamination.  Renal  clearan ce of drug is less than 10% of parent 
drug.  
 
5.1.2  Availabili ty 
The drug is supplied  as either  a 200 mg or 1 gram  lyophili zed powder  in a 50mL sterile 
single  vial for reconstitution. 
 
5.1.3  Administration  
The drug is admini stered  via a freely  running  intravenous  catheter  per local institutional 
guideline s. 
 
5.1.4  Toxic ity 
Toxicities include nausea, vomiting,  alope cia, stomatiti s, anorexia, fatigue,  elevations of 
hepatic  transamina ses, rash, flu-like symptom s, edem a, constipation, paresthesias, 
hypersensitivity rea ctions, phleb itis, proteinuria,  hematuria,  reversible myelosuppre ssion, 
rarely  interstitial pneumonitis  and ARDS, and rarely  kidney  damage.

5.2 Cisplatin:  
 
5.2.1  Cisplatin is a planar inorgan ic metal  salt that function as an alkylating ag ent. In 
aqueous  solution,  the drug is equated to a diaquo  species as the two chloride  groups 
leave the molecule. The reactive diaquo  species binds  to N7 residues  of guanine  bases on 
DNA resulting  in strand  scission, and intra- and inter-strand  crosslinking. 
 
5.2.2  Availabili ty 
Cisplatin  is commer cially supplied  as a lyophili zed powder  in 10 mg and 50 mg vials, and 
stored  at room  temper ature. The drug should  be reconstituted using 10 ml and 50 ml 
respectively of sterile  water  for injection, USP,  to yield a concentration of  1 mg/ml. 
Prere constituted multido se vials of 100 mg are also availabl e. Once the  multido se vial has 
been  entered,  the remaining  cisplatin is stable for 28 days when  prote cted from light.  
 
5.2.3  Administration  
Route  of Administration:  Cisplatin should be given IV drip per local institutional  guidelines. 
Needles  and IV sets using aluminum  should  not be used in the admini stration  of cisplatin.  
 
5.2.4  Toxic ity 
Potential  side effects from cisplatin  include cumulative nephrotoxicity, myelosuppre ssion, 
nausea, and vomiting.  Ototo xicity, manife sted by tinnitus  and/or  high frequen cy hearing 
loss, is significant. Anaph ylactic-like rea ctions to cisplatin have been reported.  Facial 
swelling,  bronchospasm, ta chycardia, and hypoten sion may occur within  minutes of 
cisplatin administration.  Other  side effects include fatigue,  anore xia, weight  loss, diarrhea,  
serum    electrolyte   disturban ces   including    h yponatremia,   hypomagne semia,   and 
hypocalcemia,  edema  of  the  lungs  or  extremities,  vascular  toxicities,  neuro toxicity 
including  cerebral  infarction, seizures and dizziness, ocular toxicity with visual 
disturban ces, peripher al neuropat hy, autono mic neuropat hy, infertilit y, muscle cramp s, 
and hepatic  toxicity. Other  rare side effects include cardiac abnormalitie s, hiccoughs, 
elevated serum  amylase, ra sh, and alope cia. Local soft tissue injury  has been  reported 
following  extravasation of  cisplatin. Based on reported  toxicities from completed/ongoing 
trials  utilizing NCI Common Toxicity Criteria.

Chapel  Hill, and New York University.  Every attempt will  be made  to recruit women and 
minorities  to participate in this study. Participation is volunta ry.  The consenting  physician 
will inform  patients  of their diagnosis, current  treatment  options  including  standard 
treatment,  and the risks, benefit s, and experimental nature  of this treatment  program. 
Appro ximately a total of 46 evaluable patie nts will participate in the trial with about  26 
patients  from MSKCC and 20 from University of Carolina  at Chapel  Hill and New York 
University. A ccrual goals are feasible because neoadju vant chemotherapy  is the standard 
of care in our center.  MSKCC  performs over 200 cystectomies per  year (130  in patients 
with MIBC) and our group  has published multip le studies  of neoadju vant chemotherapy  in

discontin ued from chemotherapy  for maximum do se reduction will be treated  according  to 
physician discretion.  Any patients  who have completed  at  least 3  cycles of  protocol 
therapy  will be evaluated  for the primary  endpo int. 
 
9.5 Algorithm  for Dose  Modification  and Interruption  
 
9.5.1  Dose  Modi fications  for Hematologic  Toxici ty 
If the criteria  for treatment  on Day 1 are  not met, treatment  will be held one week  and the 
CBC will be rechecked before  proceeding.  The following  dose modifi cations of 
gemcitabine  will be based on blood  counts  within  1 day prior to day 1 of each cycle of 
therap y. Only the gemcitabine  dose will be reduced for hematologic  toxicity.

If on day 1 of any cycle, the serum  creatinine  > 1.5 and calculated e stimated G FR < 60 
ml/min/ m2, treatment  will be held for one week  and creatin ine/eGFR w ill be rechecked. If 
recovery to serum  creatinine  < 1.5 or eGFR > 60 cc/min occurs, the patient  will be 
retreated  with a cisplatin dose 1 level lower  than the prior cycle. Additional  hydration 
should  be considered  on the day of treatment  or on the day following  treatment.

Neurologic  Toxici ty: 
If neurologic  toxicity ≥ grade  2 occurs at any point  of the cycle, then gemcitabine  and 
cisplatin should be held for one week. If resolution  to grade 1 occurs, patie nt will be 
retreated  with a cisplatin dose 1 level lower  than prior cycle. 
 
Ototoxici ty: 
If ototo xicity is suspected, audiometry  will be performed  to assess hearing.  For loss of 
greater  than 30 db in two consecutive hearing  frequen cies, therapy  will be held for 1 wee k, 
and audiometry a ssessment  will be repeated.  If hearing  loss is resolved, then the patient 
will be retreated with a cisplatin dose 1 level lower  than prior cycle. 
 
 
 
Cardiovascular  Toxicit y: 
If during  any cycle of therapy  a patient  develops  ≥ grade  3 cardio vascular toxicity, then 
treatment  should  be permanently  discontinued  and the PI or Co-PI contacted. 
 
Pulmona ry Toxici ty: 
If during  any cycle of gemcitabine  and cisplatin therapy  a patient  develops  ≥ grade  3 
pulmonary  toxicity, then the patient  should  discontinue  chemotherapy  and the PI or Co-PI 
should  be contacted. 
 
Hepatic  Dysfunction:  
If bilirubin  > 1.5 (in the absence of Gilbert’s  disease) or transamina ses >2.5 X upper  limit 
or normal, evaluate  for progre ssive disease. If drug toxicity suspected, hold until toxicity < 
grade  2 and resume gemcitabine  at 1 dose level lower. 
 
Gastrointe stinal Toxicit y: 
Patients  who develop nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea  that persists at Grade  3 or 4 should be 
treated  with maximal medical therapy and treatment  should  be withheld  until the patient’s  
recovery.  Once fully recovered, therapy  at the same dose and schedu le can resume with 
appropriate  proph ylactic medi cations. 
 
Other  Non-Hematological  Toxicities:  
For any grade 3 or 4 toxicity not mentioned  above, the treatment  should  be withheld  until 
the patient’s  recovery and the possibility  of resumption  of therapy  should  be discussed 
with the Study  PI or Co-PI. 
 
Patients  who develop a symptomat ic grade  4 venous  thromboembolic  event will not be 
eligible  for retreatment.  
 
9.6      Concomitant  Medications  
Radiation  therapy  is not allowed  during the study.  Admini stration of  other chemotherap y, 
immunothe rapy,  or  anti-tumor  hormonal  therapy  during  the  study  is  not  allowed.

 10.1    Clinical  Evaluation  During  Treatment  
Patients  must undergo  a complete  history, physical exam, and toxicity assessment  on 
day 1 of each cycle. Weight and vital signs must be recorded.  Height  and KPS will only 
be assessed at baseline. All clinical assessments should  occur within  +/- 5 days of the 
intended  cycle start date. 
 
10.2    Laborato ry Studies  During  Treatment  
Complete blood count (CBC) with differential and platelets and comprehen sive panel  (Na, 
K, Cl, CO2,  BUN,  Cr, Ca, glucose, AST, ALT,  TP, Albumin,  ALP,  BT) must be performed  
on day 1 of each cycle. 
 
10.3    Radiographic  Studies  During  Treatment  
Follow -up imaging  (CT Chest or CXR;  CT or MR of the abdomen  and pelvis) must be 
perfor med after complet ion of cycle 4 treatment,  prior to initiating  cycle 5. Diffusion- 
weighted  MRI is preferred,  if available. 
 
10.4    Surge ry 
Patients  will undergo  standard  surgery consisting of radical cystectomy  and bilateral 
pelvic lymph node  dissection, as determined  by their attendi ng surgical urologic  
oncologi st. Surgery  will be performed,  if possible, 4-8 weeks after completing  
chemotherap y. 
 
10.5    Post -Trea tment  Follo w-Up 
Standard  follow -up evaluations  and imaging  will occur as determined  by the investigator 
(i.e. every 3 months  for the first 18 month s, followed by every 6 months  for the next 18 
month s, followed  by yearly scans from the time of surgery).  Follow -up will occur until 5 
years from the time of surgery  or until disease recurren ce/progre ssion. 
 
 
11.0 TOXICITIES/SIDE E FFECTS 
 
Cisplatin  Toxici ty 
Potential  side effects from cisplatin  include cumulati ve nephrotoxicity, myelosuppre ssion, 
nausea, and vomiting.  Ototoxicity, manife sted by  tinnitus  and/or high frequency hearing 
loss, is significant. Anaphylactic-like reactions to cisplatin have been  reported.  Facial 
swelling,  bronchospasm, tachycardia, and hypoten sion may occur within  minutes  of 
cisplatin  administration.  Other  side  effects  include  fatigue,  anore xia,  weight  loss, 
diarrhea, serum electrolyte disturbances including hyponatremia,  hypomagne semia, and 
hypocalcemia, edema  of the lungs  or extremities, vascular toxicities, neuro toxicity 
including  cerebral  infarction, seizures and dizziness, ocular toxicity with visual 
disturban ces, peripheral  neuropath y, autonom ic neuropath y, infertilit y, muscle cramp s, 
and hepatic  toxicity. Other rare side effects include cardiac abnormalitie s, hiccoughs, 
elevated serum  amylase, rash, and alope cia. Local soft tissue injury  has been  reported 
following  extravasation  of cisplatin. Based on  reported  toxicities from completed/ongo ing 
trials  utilizing NCI Common Toxicity Criteria.

12.0 CRITERIA  FOR THE RAPEUTIC RE SPON SE/OUTCOME ASS ESSMENT  
 
12.1    Pathologic  Response  
Pathologic  response to neoadju vant DD GC is the primary  endpoint  of this phase II study 
and is defined as the absence of muscle invasive carcinoma (<pT2  disease) and the 
absence of lymph node  meta stases (N0) on the final cystectomy specimen.  Pathologi sts 
will assess surgical specimens  systemati cally u sing criteria  agreed  upon  for all 
conventional  neoadju vant treatment based on the AJCC TNM staging  system. 
 
12.2    Progressi on Free  Survival 
Progre ssion-free survival is measured from the time of treatment  initiat ion until the first 
date that disease progression is objectively documented.  Disease progression for this 
trial  is  defined  as  either  progre ssion of  disease  (documented  clinically  or 
radiographi cally) before  radical cystectomy, or meta static or local pelvic recurren ce after 
radical cystectomy. Due to the multifo cal nature  of transitional cell tumo rs involving other 
segments  of the genito urinary  tract, this definition excludes  new primary  tumors of the 
renal  pelvis,  ureter s,  or  urethra.  The  assessment  of  disease  recurren ce  versus 
development of a second primary  tumor will be left to the discretion of the treating 
physician. If the patient  did not progre ss nor die, the  patient  will be censored on the date 
of last follow-up. 
 
12.4    Toxici ty 
Toxicity will be graded  according  to the National Cancer Institute  Common Toxicity 
Criteria  for Adverse Events version 4.0. 
 
13.0 CRITER IA FOR  REMOVAL FROM STUDY  
 
If, at any time,  the patient  develops progr essive meta static di sease, he/she will 
discontin ue chemotherapy and  be referred  for alternati ve therap y. This will count  as a 
failure  for the primary  efficacy endpo int. 
 
If, at any time, the patient  is found  to be ineligible for the proto col as designated in the 
section on Criteria  for Patient/Subje ct Eligibi lity (i.e., a change in diagnosis), the patient 
will discontinue proto col therapy  and be referred  for alternati ve therap y. 
 
The patient will discontinue chemotherapy  if treatment  is held for >14 days, or the patient 
requires  more  than 3 dose reductions of gemcitabine or 2 dose reductions of cisplatin. 
These patients will only be considered e valuable  for the primary  endpoint  if they have 
completed  at least 3 cycles of proto col therap y. 
 
The patient  will be taken off study and/or  discontinue  chemotherapy if,  at any time,  the 
study doctor belie ves it is in the patient’s best interest to do so.

 14.0 BIOS TATISTICS  
 
This is a single arm phase II study of neoadj uvant DD  GC in surgical candidat es with 
MIBC  prior to radical cystectomy.  The primary  endpoint  is pathologic response, defined 
as the proportion  of patients  who achieve absence of muscle-invasive disease at the 
time of cystectomy  (<pT2).  The “unintere sting” patholog ic response rate is 35%,  which 
is based on a prior retro spective study (Dash et al., 2008)  and two prospective 
randomi zed clinical trials (MRC/EORTC tria l11 and Intergroup  0080  trial10) utilizing a 
conventional  schedule  of cisplatin -based neoadju vant chemotherap y.   A total of 46 
patients  will be accrued to the study to detect an impro vement  in response rate from 
35% to 55%. The study design is based on exact Binomial  one-sided test, Type 1 error 
of  5%  and  power  of  87%.  Patients  that  do  not  proceed  to  have  surgery  due  to 
progre ssion of disease, or discontinue chemotherapy  due to excessive treatment  delays, 
dose reductions, or toxicity will be counted  as non-responders. Patients  will not be 
considered e valuable  for the primary  objective if they receive less than 3 completed 
cycles of protocol therapy and are discontinued from proto col treatment  for either 
withdrawal  of consent or adverse events. These patients  will be repla ced. All patients  will 
remain  evaluable  for toxicity assessment. At  the end of the study, if 22 or more  patients 
will ha ve pathologic  response, the tr eatment  regimen  will be  considered  worthy  of further 
investigatio n. The follow-up time is at least five years for each patient.  The accrual rate 
is 2-3 patients per month,  and the study is expected to be completed within  2 years. 
Since it takes about  5-6 months  from the enrollment date  to surgery  and, therefore, 
determination  of patient ’s response, the two stage design is not utilized. 
 
Secondary  objectives include:  1.)  Safety  and  tolerabi lity, tabulated  by  NCI  CTCAE 
version 4.0; 2.) Progre ssion free survival, defined  as the time from treatment  initiat ion to 
disease progression, local-regional  or meta static recurrence, or death  analyzed using 
the Kaplan  Meier  method. Patients  who do not proceed to  have surgery due to 
documented  disease progression will be counted  as progre ssion.

Research staff at MSKCC will review data and source documentation  as it is submitted. 
Data  will be monitored  again st source documentation  and discrepan cies will be sent as 
queries  to the participating sites. Queries will be sent by MSKCC Research staff twice a 
month.  
 
Participating  sites should  respond  to data queries  within  14 days of receipt. 
 
16.1    Quali ty Assurance  
 
Weekly registration  reports will be generated  to monitor  patient  accruals and 
completene ss of registration  data.  Routine  data quality  reports  will be generated  to 
assess missing data and inconsistencies. Accrual rates  and extent and accuracy of 
evaluations  and follow-up will be monitored  periodically throughout  the study period  and 
potential  problems will be brought  to the attenti on of the study team  for discussion and 
action. 
 
Random -sample  data quality  and proto col compliance audits will be conducted by the 
study team,  at a minimum of two times  per year, more  frequently  if indicated.  
 
16.1.1  Quali ty Assurance for Participating  Sites  
Each site participating  in the accrual of participants to this proto col will be audited  by the 
staff of the MSKCC study team  for proto col and regulatory  complian ce, data  verification  
and source documentation.   Audits  may be accompli shed in one of two ways: (1) 
selected participant  records can be audited  on-site at participating  sites or (2) source 
documents  for selected participants will be sent to MSKCC  for audit.  Audits  will usually 
be determined by  participant  accrual numbers  and rate of accrual, but can also be 
prompted  by reported  SAEs  or reque st of MSKCC PI. 
 
Audits  will be condu cted at least once shortly  after initiation of participant recruitme nt at 
a site, annually  during  the study (or more  frequently if  indicated), and  at the end or 
closeout of the trial. The number  of participants audited  will be determined  by available 
time and the comple xity of the proto col. 
 
The audit  will include a review of source documentation  to evaluate  complian ce for: 
 
•   Informed  consent documents  and procedures  
•   Adheren ce to eligib ility criteria  
•   Proto col defined treatment  
•   Required  baseline,  on study and follow-up proto col testing 
•   IRB documents (submit ted amend ments, annual  continuing  review repor ts, SAEs) 
•   Case Report  Form  submi ssions to MSKCC: timelines  and accuracy 
 
A wrap -up session will be condu cted at the participating  site and preliminary  findings  will 
be discussed with the participating  site PI and research team. The preliminary  results will 
be sent to the MSKCC PI. 
 
Each audit  will be summarized and a final report will be sent to the PI at the audited 
participating  site within  30 days of the audit.  The report  will include a summary  of 
finding s, participant  by participant  case review, specific recommendatio ns on any

 perfor mance and/or  shortcomings  and reque st for corrective action, when necessary. 
When  corrective action is required,  the participating site must reply  within  45 days of 
receipt of audit report  with their corrective action plan.  
 
A copy of the audit  report and corrective action plan (if applicable)  submitted  by the 
participating  site must be sent to the MSKCC IRB/PB,  CRQA and maintained  in the 
department’s  proto col regulatory  binder.  
 
16.1.2  Response  Review  
Since therapeutic  efficacy is a stated primary  objective, all sites participant’s responses 
are subject to review by MSKCC’s  Therapeutic  Response Review Committee  (TRRC). 
Radiolog y, additional  lab reports  and possibly bone marrow  biopsies and/or aspirates 
will need  to be obtained  from the participating  sites for MSKCC TRRC review and 
confirmation  of response assessment. These materials  must be sent to MSKCC 
promptly  upon reque st. 
 
16.2 Data  and Safe ty Moni toring  
 
The Data a nd Safety Monito ring (DSM) Plans at Memorial S loan Kett ering Cancer Center 
were  approved by  the Natio nal Cancer  Institute in Sep tember 2001.  The plans address  the 
new polic ies set forth by  the NCI in the docu ment entitled “Policy of  the National C ancer 
Institute for Data and Sa fety Monito ring of Clinic al Trials” which can be found at: 
http://www.cancer.gov /clinicaltrials/conductin g/dsm-guidelines/page1 . .   The DSM Plans 
at MSKCC  were es tablished and a re monitored by the O ffice of  Clinical Research.  The 
MSKCC  Data and S afety Monit oring Plans can be found on the MSKCC Intra net at: 
http://insid e2/clinrese arch/Documents/MSKCC%20Dat a%20and% 20Safety%20  
Monitorin g%20Pl ans.pdf  
There a re several different mechanis ms by which cli nical trials are monitored for data, 
safety and quality.  The re are  institutional processes in p lace for quality  assurance  (e.g., 
protoc ol monitoring, c ompliance a nd data v erification  audits, thera peutic response, and 
staff educat ion on cli nical re search QA) and depart mental procedu res for qua lity co ntrol, 
plus th ere are two ins titutional committees t hat are respon sible for monitoring t he 
activities of  our c linical trials prog rams.  The co mmittees: Data and Saf ety Mo nitoring 
Committee (DSM C) for Phase I and  II clinical trials, and  the Data and Safety  Monitoring 
Board (DSMB) for Ph ase III clinical trials,  rep ort to the Ce nter’s Rese arch Council and 
Institutional Review Board.  
 
During the protoc ol dev elopment and review pr ocess, each protocol w ill be asses sed for 
its level of risk and degr ee of monitoring req uired. Every type  of protocol (e.g., NIH 
sponsored, in-house sp onsored, ind ustrial spons ored, NCI coopera tive g roup, etc.) w ill be 
addressed  and the monitoring pro cedures wi ll be established  at the  time of protocol 
activation.

Amended:  7/14/15  
Page  31 of 39  
 Deviations  and Violations  
A proto col deviation  on this study is defined  as a reque st to treat a research participant 
who does  not meet all the eligib ility criteria,  pretreatment  evaluation,  or who requires  
alteration  in their study plan.  If a deviation  from this proto col is propo sed for a potential  
or existing participant  at MSKCC or a participating site, approval from the MSKCC 
IRB/PB  is required  prior to the action. Participating sites should contact the MSKCC PI 
who will in turn seek approval from the MSKCC IRB/PB.  
 
A proto col violation  is anything  that occurs with a participant,  which deviated  from the 
proto col without prior approval from the MSKCC IRB/PB.  For proto col violations  that are 
identified  after they occur, the participating  site should  report  to MSKCC as soon as 
possible. The MSKCC PI will in turn report  the violation  to the MSKCC IRB/PB.  
 
Participating  sites should  report  deviations  and violations  to their institution’s IRBs as 
soon as possible per that site’s institutional  guidelines. Approvals/acknowledgments from 
the participating  site IRB for proto col deviations and violations  should be submitted  to 
MSKCC as received. 
 
Other  correspondence  
Participating  sites should  submit  other  correspondence to their institution’s IRB 
according  to local guidelines, and submit copies  of that corresponden ce to MSKCC. 
 
16.3.3  Document  maintenance  
The MSKCC PI and the Participating Site PI will maintain  adequate  and accurate  
records to enable  the implementation  of the protocol to be fully documented  and the data 
to be subsequently  verified.  
 
The participating  sites will ensure that all participating  site IRB corresponden ce (IRB 
appro val letters  referen cing proto col version date and amendment  numb er, IRB appro ved 
proto col, appendices, informed consent forms, deviation s, violations, and appro val of 
continuing  reviews) is maintained  in the regulat ory binder  on site and sent to MS KCC. 
 
A regulatory  binder  for each site will also be maintained  at MSKCC;  this binder  may be 
paper  or electronic. 
 
After  study closure, the participating  site will maintain  all source document s, study 
related  documents  and CRFs  for 3 years. 
 
16.4 Noncompliance  
If a participating site is noncompliant  with the proto col document, accrual privileges  may 
be suspended and/or  contract payments maybe withheld,  until the outstanding  issues 
have been  resolved.

 17.0 PRO TECTION OF HUMAN  SUBJECTS  
 
Potential  risks to human  subjects include drug-related  toxicity, pain and discomfort 
associated with cisplatin, gemcitabine, placement of IV catheters, phlebotom y, and 
possible psychologi cal discomfort from the stresses associated with obtaining imaging 
studies  (e.g., CT scan). The side effects and potential  toxicities of cisplatin and 
gemcitabine  are listed in section  5.1.4,  5.2.3  and 11. All efforts will be made  to avoid 
any compli cation  by completely  reviewing  patients’ symptom s, providing  appropria te 
manage ment, and monitoring  blood  tests. If an adverse medical event occurs, the patient  
will first contact the primary  oncologist or the principal investigato r. At nights  and 
weekends, there is an oncology  physician on call at all times. Patients  may either  call or 
come directly to the urgent  care center at Memo rial Hospital (or to their local emergen cy 
room)  to be seen. Patie nts suffering  serious  adverse reactions must be carefully  follow ed 
and all follow -up information  recorded.  
 
Alternativ es/Options  for treatme nt 
Patients  can elect to receive standard  therapy  for muscle invasive urothelial  carcinoma 
with neoad juvant M-VAC or standard  GC. They  can also elect to participate in anot her 
clinical trial. Participation  in a clinical trial is voluntary. 
 
Costs  
The patient  will be responsible for all costs related to treatment  and compli cations of 
treatment.  Costs to the patient  (or third party  insurer) will include the cost of 
hospitalizations, routine  blood  tests and diagno stic studies, office visits, baseline EKG, 
other  medi cations  such as antibio tics and doctor’s fees. 
 
17.1 Priva cy 
 
MSKCC’s  Privacy Office may allow  the use and disclosure of prote cted health 
information  pursuant to a completed  and signed  Research Authori zation  form.  The use 
and disclosure of prote cted health  information  will be limited  to the individuals described 
in the Research Author ization  form.  A Research Authori zation form must be completed 
by the Principal Investigator and appro ved by the IRB and Privacy Boar d. 
 
17.2 Serious  Adverse  Event  (SAE)  Reporting  
 
Serious  Adverse  Event  Definition  
 
A serious  adverse event is one that at any dose (including  overdose): 
 
• Results in death 
• Is life-threa tening1 
• Requires  an  unplann ed  inpatient  hospitalization  or  prolongation  of  existing 
hospitalization 
• Results in persistent or significant disability  or incapacity2 
• Is a congen ital anomaly  or birth defect 
• Is an important  medi cal event3 
• Pregnan cy

1“Life-threatening”  means that the subject was at immediate ri sk of death  at the time of 
Amended:  7/14/15  
Page  33 of 39  
 the serious  adverse event; it does  not refer to a serious  adverse event that hypotheti cally 
might  have caused death if it were  more  severe. 
 
2“Persistent or significant disability or incapacity” means  that there  is a substantial 
disruption  of a person’s ability  to carry out normal life functions. 
 
3Medi cal and scientific judgment should  be exercised in  deciding  whether  expedited 
reporting is  appropriate  in situatio ns where  none  of the outcomes  listed above occurred. 
Important  medical events that may not be immediately  life-threatening  or result in death 
or hospitalization but  may jeopardi ze the patient  or may require  intervention  to prevent 
one  of  the  other  outcomes  li sted  in  the  definition  above  should  also  usually  be 
considered  seriou s.  Examples  of such events include allergic bronchospasm requiring 
inten sive treatment  in an emergen cy room  or at home,  blood  dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not result in inpatient hospitalization,  or the development  of drug depende ncy or 
drug abuse.  A new diagno sis of cancer during the course of a treatment should  be 
considered  as medi cally important.  
 
Serious  Adverse  Event  Reporting  
 
Any SAE must be reported to the IRB/PB  as soon as possible but no later than 5 
calendar  days. The IRB/PB requires  a Clinical Research Database (CRDB) SAE report 
be submitted  electronically to the SAE Office at sae@ mskcc.org. The report  should 
contain  the following  information:  
 
Fields  popu lated from CRDB:  
 
• Subje ct’s name (generate  the report  with only initials  if it will be sent outside of 
MSKCC) 
• Medi cal record number  
• Disease/histology  (if appli cable)  
• Proto col number  and title 
 
Data  needing  to be entered: 
 
• The date the adverse event occurred  
• The adverse event 
• Relation ship of the adverse event to the treatment  (drug,  device, or intervention)  
• If the AE was expected 
• The severity of the AE 
• The intervention  
• Detailed  text that includes the follow ing 
o A explanation  of how the AE was handled  
o A description of the subject’s condition 
o Indication  if the subject remains on the study 
o If an amendment  will need  to be made  to the protocol and/or consent 
form. 
 
The PI’s signature  and the date it was signed  are required  on the completed  report. 
SAEs  will be collected from the time of consent until 30 days following  the proto col 
specified surgery.

SUGGESTED HYDRATION REGIMEN 
 
General  points: 
- It is helpf ul to weigh  patients at the beginning  and end of treatment  on Days 1 and 2 of each 
cycle and prior to hydration  on Day 3 and record strict I&Os during  infusion. 
- It is also helpful to have a baseline  ECHO  to feel more  comfortable  with fluid shifts, etc. 
 
Days 1 and 2 of each  cycle: 
Pre-Cisplatin hydration:  
- 1000 cc normal saline  given over 3 hours 
- Mannitol  25% (12.5g  IV x 1) 
 
Post-Cisplatin hydration:  
- Normal  saline  at 250 ml/hr  x 3hrs = total 750 ml 
 
Day 3 of each cycle: 
- 500-1000 cc normal  saline may be given if indicated at the investigator’s  discretion.  This is 
subject to change  due to possible fluid retention  on Days 1 and 2 of treatment.

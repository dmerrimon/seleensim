1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
We have developed a pathway for shoulder arthroplasty that in many cases results in excellent 
analgesia (Goon 2014). Roughly half of the patients have minimal needs for additional opioids. 
However, some patients have significant pain (Goon 2014, YaDeau 201 5), including at the 2 -
week time point (anecdotal evidence, per Dr. Gulotta). Dr . Gulotta noted that many of the 
patients with pain appear to have significant bruising, and he hypothesizes that the 
extravasation of blood into the surgical field causes infl ammation, swelling, stiffness and pain. 
Tranexamic acid may reduce the incidence of this problem, and Dr. Gulotta has considered 
requesting tranexamic acid for some of his shoulder arthroplasty patients.  There is limited 
literature about pain after total s houlder arthroplasty, and relevant data are not available about 
patients treated with the following anesthetic/analgesic protocol.  This is a pilot study that will 
help develop a protocol for a tranexamic acid study to help reduce swelling in patients 
under going TSA. The study will also provide much needed clinical data about what patients 
and physicians can expect regarding postoperative pain and total shoulders, when managed 
with this protocol  and thus serve as a benchmark publication.  
2.0 OBJECTIVE (S) OF CLIN ICAL STUDY   
The pain experience for patients after total shoulder arthroplasty has not been well described. 
We believe that our current protocols provide good pain control for many patients while they 
are in the hospital, but we do not know about their pai n experience at POD 14. Review of the 
literature failed to provide suitable information about pain trajectories after TSA. Moreover, 
the innovative analgesic protocol recently developed at HSS is apparently unique and makes 
it difficult to apply data from other institutions. In addition, another reason to conduct this study 
is to obtain baseline data for a possible follow -up study involving tranexamic acid. (No 
tranexamic acid will be administered for patients in the current proposed study). Some patients 
experience pain after shoulder arthroplasty surgery as well as bruising, which could be due to 
blood extravasation into the surgical site. To design a possible tranexamic acid study, a 
preliminary baseline study is needed to determine the timeline of pain f ollowing TSA. 
Moreover, the innovative analgesic protocol recently developed at HSS is apparently unique 
and makes it difficult to apply data from other institutions . 
The pain experience for patients after total shoulder arthroplasty has not been well desc ribed 
in scientific papers. Here at HSS, we have developed a unique pathway for shoulder 
arthroplasty that in many cases results in excellent analgesia, with roughly half of the pa tients 
having minimal needs for addi tional opioids. However, some pa tients e xperience significant 
pain including at the 2 weeks time point. We believe that our current protocols provide good 
pain control for many patients while they are in the hospital, but we do not know in detail about 
their pain experience at 14 days after surg ery. Many of the pa tients with pain appear to have 
bruising at the surgical site, which may contribute to postopera tive pain. We wish to describe 
the pain trajectory after shoulder arthroplasty with this study, including determining how often 
bruising occu rs after shoulder replacement.

3.0 STUDY HYPOTHESES  
Since it is a pilot study there is no formal hypothesis. We believe that using our current protocol 
many patients have postoperative pain that is no worse than their preoperative pain. Previous 
HSS anesthesia  protocols for total shoulder arthroplasty patients have not formally followed 
patients past their hospital discharge, and we believe that some patients do experience 
moderate to severe subacute postoperative pain.  
Th is a pilot study, with the goals of  
a) developing data for a subsequent randomized trial   
b) describing the pain trajectory after total shoulder arthroplasty given comprehensive 
multimodal perioperative analgesia  
c) gathering preliminary data about which shoulder arthroplasty patients are at high ri sk 
for moderate or severe postoperative pain (NRS with movement, POD14, moderate 
>= 4  6; Gerbershagen 2011; severe >= 7 10, Krebs 2007) Potential factors include 
fibromyalgia score, catastrophizing score, anxiety/depression score, gender, 
preoperative opi oid use  
d) gathering preliminary data on the potential association between the predictors listed 
in (c) and NRS pain score with movement on POD14  
e) Estimating incidence, size and severity of postoperative bruising on POD 14 and 3 
months

anesthesiologist  
1. Block procedural intravenous sedation protocol included midazolam (up to 5 
mg), propofol as needed, and ketami ne (10-20 mg).  
2. Both get 50 mg ketamine IV (total, part used with midazolam for block 
sedation).  
3. Sedation: Intraoperative sedation will be maintained with propofol infusion 
and a total of 50mg ketamine.

An extensive literature search found no report of pain intensity two weeks post TSA.  Therefore, 
the standard deviation in mean pain intensity was estimated based on the control group of a 
prior Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) trial (YaDeau 2016). In the prior TKA trial, the maximum 
standard deviation in mean pain intensity (with ambulation, flexion, rest, and worst in past 24 
hours) in the control group was 2.3. The following table and figure s how how the half width of 
the 95% CI (i.e., precision) for the mean pain intensity increases with total sample size, and 
that the gain in precision per additional patient is less pronounced after enrollment of 100 
patients.  
 
Mean pain with movement 2 weeks  post TSA (the primary outcome) will be summarized as a 
point estimate with 95% confidence interval. Continuous variables will be summarized as 
means with standard deviations or medians with 1 st and 3 rd quartiles, depending upon the 
distribution of the d ata. Ordinal variables will be summarized as medians with 1 st and 3 rd 
quartiles. Categorical variables will be summarized as counts and percentages. Longitudinal 
measurements of pain, opioid consumption, and non opioid analgesic consumption will be 
model ed using the generalized estimating equations method. Differences in means or odds 
ratios (from cumulative odds model) with 95% confidence intervals will be estimated for each 
postoperative timepoint vs. POD 1, adjusting for preoperative value where applic able. The 
association between fibromyalgia score, pain catastrophizing score, anxiety/depression score, 
gender, and preoperative opioid use and the odds of experiencing moderate or severe 
postoperative pain (POD 14 NRS pain with movement 4 6 or 7 10, respe ctively) will be 
assessed on a univariate and multivariable basis using logistic regression. The number of

predictor included in each multivariable model will be determined by the number of events 
observed (i.e., 10 events per included predictor). The asso ciation between fibromyalgia score, 
pain catastrophizing score, anxiety/depression score, gender, and preoperative opioid use 
and POD 14 NRS pain with movement will be assessed on a univariate and multivariable 
basis using linear regression. The incidence of adverse events will be reported as point 
estimates with 95% Wilson score confidence intervals. No P values will be reported unless 
requested by peer reviewers.

Statistical  Methodology  The 6 -month PFS rate will be the primary endpoint. Two parallel  Simon’s 
2-stage phase II trials will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy  of 
regorafenib in patients with advanced carcinoid (cohort A) or  pancreatic 
islet cell tumors  (cohort  B). For cohort  A, a 6-month  PFS rate of 40% would 
be considered as disappointing and 65% or higher would be  encouraging. 
For cohort  B, a 57% rate would  be considered  as not interesting,  and 80% 
or higher would be promising. We need a total of 24 patients  with carcinoid  
tumors  (cohort  A) and 24 patients  with pancreatic  islet cell tumors 
(cohort  B). 
 
The study  design  of both trials  has 80% power  to demonstrate  the efficacy 
of regorafenib. The type I error rate is 5.1% and 5.3%, for cohort A and  B, 
respectively.  We designed  the trials  with type I error  rate a little higher 
than 5% because  the tumors  are rare and the sample  size should  be as 
small as  possible.

Protocol version 03.13.2018   1.0 BACKGROUND AND  RATIONALE  
 
1.1 Disease  Background  
Neuroendocrine  tumors,  which  include  carcinoid  tumors  and pancreatic  islet cell tumors,  are rare 
malignancies,  occurring  in only  1-2 people  per 100,000  in the United  States.  As these  cancers 
cause few symptoms and little pain, most patients are diagnosed with disseminated  metastases. 
Patients with metastatic disease have a 5 -year survival rate of only 18%.1 Carcinoid tumors  and 
pancreatic islet cell  tumors both arise from neuroendocrine cells and are  histologically 
indistinguishable. Neuroendocrine tumors are usually made up of small cells containing  regular, 
well-rounded nuclei with rare mitoses. These tumors often have a slow rate of progression,  yet 
patients with metastatic disease eventually develop significant morbidity, including  pain, 
diarrhea,  constipation,  anorexia,  weight  loss,  fatigue,  and sometimes  episodic  flushing,  wheezing 
and right sided valvular heart  disease.  
 
For patients  with  neuroendocrine  tumors  and localized  disease,  surgery  has shown  a survival 
benefit. For unresectable disease, however, no treatment with survival benefit has been  found. 
Therefore, treatment in this population is currently palliative. Somatostatin analogs a re effective 
in relieving  the symptoms  of both  the carcinoid  syndrome  and the hormonal  hypersecretion  seen 
with pancreatic endocrine tumors.2 Octreotide may also led to an improvement in PFS  as reported  
in a phase  II study,  although  treatment  is not necessarily  associated  with  objective responses. 
Some patients benefit from interferon -, but the toxicity of this treatment  frequently outweighs 
the small therapeutic benefit.3 Chemotherapy i s of limited efficacy in the  metastatic population, 
with streptozotocin being the only approved anticancer agent for patients  with neuroendocrine 
tumors, only of the pancreatic islet cell type. The combination of  streptozocin and  doxorubicin  has 
been  investigated  in patients  with  advanced  pancreatic  islet cell tumors,  with a response rate of 
only 6%. The combination was found to have considerable toxicity,  including myelosuppression, 
asthenia and renal insufficiency. Decreases in hormone secretion  and improved  physical  
examinations  were  seen  in patients  treated  with  this combination,  however.4,5 Patients with 
metastatic carcinoid tumors have also shown resistance to  chemotherapeutic regimens consisting 
of streptozocin and cyclophosphamide, streptozocin and 5 -FU, as well  as docetaxel  and 
gemcitabine .6-8 Some  single  agents  and drug  combinations  have  shown  limited activity  
(response  rates  of 30%  or less)  in carcinoid  patients  (fluorouracil,  doxorubicin, dacarbazine, 
cyclophosphamide,fluorouracil plus strotozocin and etoposide plus  cisplatin).  Complete  
responses  with  these  regimens  are rarely  seen.  The responses  that are seen  do not usually  last 
long .9 There  is recent  data  supporting  the role of antiangiogenic  agents  and mTOR inhibitors in 
this disease.  
 
Generally, NE tumors are hypervascular  and VEGF and VEGF receptors have been found to  play 
critical  roles  in angiogenesis  in these  tumors  as expression  has been  demonstrated  both  in GI and 
pulmonary carcinoid. In pancreatic islet cell cancers, phase III trials of sunitinib and  everolimus 
compa red to placebo  have  now  been  reported. Both  trials  enrolled  patients  with  progressive 
disease  within  the previous  12 months  and demonstrated  clinically  and statistically  significant 
improvements in PFS compared to placebo. Both agents have been approved by the US FDA  and 
become  standard  therapy  for pancreatic  NET (islet  cell carcinoma).  For patients  who  participated 
in the sunitinib  trial,  the median  progression -free survival  was 11.4  months  in the sunitinib  group 
as compared with 5.5 months in t he placebo group (hazard ratio for progression or death,  0.42; 
0S-14-3   
5 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   95%  confidence  interval  [CI], 0.26  to 0.66;  P<0.001).  A Cox proportional -hazards  analysis  of 
progression -free survival according to baseline characteristics favored sunitinib in all  subgroups 
studied.  The objective  response  rate was 9.3%  in the sunitinib  group  versus  0% in the placebo 
group.  At the data  cutoff  point,  9 deaths  were  reported  in the sunitinib  group  (10%)  versus  21 
deaths  in the placebo  group  (25%)  (hazard  ratio  for death,  0.41;  95%  CI, 0.19  to 0.89;  P=0.02).  The 
most frequent adverse events in the sunitinib group were diarrhea, nausea, vomiting,  asthenia, 
and fatigue.  
 
For patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors who participated in the everolimus  study, 
The median  progression -free survival  was 11.0  months  with  everolimus  as compared  with  4.6 
months with placebo (hazard ratio for disease progression or death from any cause  with 
everolimus, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27 to 0.45; P<0.001), representin g a 65% 
reduction in the estimated risk of progression or death. Estimates of the proportion of  patients 
who were alive and progression -free at 18 months were 34% (95% CI, 26 to 43) with  everolimus 
as compared  with  9% (95%  CI, 4 to 16) with  placebo.  Drug -related  adverse  events  were  mostly 
grade  1 or 2 and included  stomatitis  (in 64%  of patients  in the everolimus  group  vs. 17%  in the 
placebo group), rash(49% vs. 10%), diarrhea (34% vs. 10%), fatigue (31% vs. 14%), and  infections 
(23%vs.  6%),  which  were  primarily  upper  respiratory.  Grade  3 or 4 events  that were  more  frequent 
with everolimus than with placebo included anemia (6% vs. 0%) and hyperglycemia (5% vs.  2%). 
The median  exposure  to everolimus  was longer  than  exposure  to placebo  by a factor  of 2.3 (38 
weeks vs. 16  weeks).  
 
In addition, bevacizumab has demonstrated anti -tumor activity and is currently being  evaluated 
in a recently  closed  SWOG  trial,  a randomized  phase  III trial with  sandostatin  versus  interferon 
and sandostatin.  10,11 
 
In the recent , double -blind,  placebo -controlled,  phase  3 RADIANT -4 trial in advanced,  progressive,  
well- differentiated, non -functional neuroendocrine tumors of lung or gastrointestinal origin 
patients  were randomly  assigned  in a 2:1 ratio  to receive  everolimus  10 mg per day orally  or 
identical  placebo,  both  with supportive  care.  The primary  endpoint  was progression -free survival  
assessed  by central  radiology  review, analyzed  by intention  to treat.  Overall  survival  was a key 
secondary  endpoint.  A total  of 302 patients  were enrolled, of whom 205 were allocated to 
everolimus 10 mg per day and 97 to placebo.  Median progression -free survival  was 11·0  months  
(95%  CI 9·2–13·3)  in the everolimus  group  and 3·9 months  (3·6– 7·4) in the placebo group. 
Everolimus  was associated with a 52% reduction in the estimated risk  of progression  or death  
(hazard  ratio  [HR]  0·48  [95%  CI 0·35 –0·67],  p<0·00001).  Although  not statistically significant, the 
results of the first pre -planned interim overall survival analysis indicated that  everolimus might  
be associated  with  a reduction  in the risk of death  (HR 0·64  [95%  CI 0·40 –1·05],  one-sided  p=0·037, 
whereas  the boundary  for statistical  significance  was 0·0002).  The drug  was well tolerated  the 
most common toxicities were stomatitis, diarrhea, anemia, fatigue and hyperglycemia . The FDA  
approved everolimus for p rogressive, well -differentiated non -functional, neuroendocrine tumor s 
of gastrointestinal  or lung  origin  in patients  with  unresectable,  locally  advanced  or metastatic  
disease  in February 2016. This has changed the approach and standard treatment options in this  
patient population .12 
 
1.2 Regorafenib  
0S-14-3  
6 
Protocol version 03.13.2018    
Regorafenib has potent preclinical antitumor activity and long -lasting anti -angiogenic activity  as 
measured by dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE) – magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI).13 
Regorafenib is a small molecule inhibitor of multiple membrane -bound and intracellular  kinases 
involved  in normal  cellular  functions  and in pathologic  processes  such  as oncogenesis,  tumor 
angiogenesis, and maintenance of the  tumor microenvironment. In in vitro biochemical  or 
cellular  assays,  regorafenib  or its major  human  active  metabolites  M-2 and M-5 inhibited  the 
activity of RET, VEGFR1, VEGFR2, VEGFR3, KIT, PDGFR -alpha, PDGFR -beta, FGFR1, FGFR2, TIE2,  
DDR2,  Trk2A,  Eph2A,  RAF-1, BRAF,  BRAFV600E,  SAPK2,  PTK5,  and Ab1 at concentrations  of 
regorafenib  that have  been  achieved  clinically.  In in vivo models,  regorafenib  demonstrated  anti- 
angiogenic activity in a rat tumor model, and inhibition of tumor growth as well as  anti- 
metastatic activity in several mouse xenograft models including some for human  colorectal 
carcinoma.  
 
1.2.1  Preclinical  
In vivo,  regorafenib  exhibited  anti-angiogenic  and anti-proliferative  effects  in human  colon 
and breast xenografts as demonstrated by a reduction in microvessel area, reduced  Ki-67 
staining,  and reduced  pERK1/2  staining  in tissue  sections  from  tumor  xenografts,  and dose - 
dependent inhibition of growth in multiple xenograft models (breast, colon, renal,  NSCLC,  
melanoma, pancreatic, thyroid,  ovarian). 13 Immunohistochemical ex -vivo studies with  a 
phospho –specific monoclonal  anti-ERK 1 / 2 antibody demonstrated inhibition of  the 
MAPK pathway five days after treatment with regorafenib in 2 of 3 tumor  models 
examined (MDA -MB 231 and BxPC -3), but not in NSCLC  (H460).  
In addition,  all tested  human  tumor  xenografts  (MDA -MB-231,  H460,  BxPC -3 and Colo -205) 
demonstrated a significant reduction in new blood vessels by histomorphometry  as 
detected  in tumor  samples  using a murine  CD31  antibody .13 These  data  suggest  that 
regorafenib  can target  the tumor  cell MAPK  pathway  (tumor  cell survival)  and tumor 
vasculature in some but not all tumors.  
 
1.2.2  Clinical  experience  
Two  phase  III global  randomized  studies  have  evaluated  the efficacy  of regorafenib.  The 
CORRECT (Patients with metastatic colorectal cancer treated with regorafenib or  placebo 
after  failure  of standard  therapy)  trial is an international,  multicenter,  randomized,  double - 
blind,  placebo -controlled  study  that enrolled  760 patients  with  mCRC  whose  disease  has 
progressed after approved standard therapies. Metastatic colorectal cancer patients  were 
randomized to regorafenib plus best supportive care (BSC) or placebo plus BSC.  Treatment 
cycles  consisted  of 160 mg of regorafenib  (or matching  placebo)  once  daily  for three  weeks 
on / one week  off plus BSC.  The primary  endpoint  of this trial was overall  survival.  Secondary 
endpoints  included  progression -free survival,  objective  tumor  response  rate and disease 
control rate. The safety and tolerability of the two treatment groups were also  compared.  
 
At a preplanned  second  interim  analysis,  there  was a statistically  significant  survival  benefit 
for regorafenib. The estimated hazard ratio for overall survival was 0.773 (95%  confidence 
interval  [CI], 0.635  to 0.941;  1-sided  p = .0051).  Patients  treated  with  regorafenib  had a 
median  overall  survival  of 6.4 months,  compared  with  5.0 months  for placebo  — a 29% 
increase in survival. In addition to improved overall survival, progression -free survival  was 
0S-14-3  
7 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   superior; median  progression -free  survival  was  1.9  months  (95%  CI,  1.88  to  2.17)  for 
 
regorafenib and 1.7 months (95% CI, 1.68 to 1.74) for placebo. The estimated hazard  ratio 
for progression -free survival was 0.493 (95% CI, 0.418 to 0.581; 1 -sided p< .000001).  There 
was a substantial difference in disease control rate in the regorafenib and placebo  groups 
(44% vs. 15%; p<.000001). Regorafenib demonstrated comparable efficacy benefits  across  
patient  subgroups  analyzed  including  age,  number  of mets,  number  of lines  of prior  therapy, 
and kras  status.  
 
The most frequent grade 3+ adverse events in the regorafenib group were ha nd–foot  skin 
reaction  (17%),  fatigue  (15%),  diarrhea  (8%),  hyperbilirubinemia  (8%),  and hypertension 
(7%). The efficacy and safety from the CORRECT study supported FDA approval  in 
September  2012.  
The efficacy and safety of regorafenib were examined in the Phase III GRID trial in  patients 
with gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) who had exhausted all other  treatment 
options.  The study  involved  199 patients  with  metastatic  and/or  unresectable  GIST  that had 
become  resistant  to imatinib  and sunitinib.  Patients  were  randomized  2:1 to regorafenib 
(160  mg orally  once  daily  on a 3 weeks  on/1  week  off cycle)  or placebo,  plus best  supportive 
care.  
 
The results showed that treatment with regorafenib led to a statistically significant  3.9- 
month  improvement  in progression -free survival  (PFS),  compared  with  placebo  (4.8 months 
vs. 0.9 months; hazard ratio [HR] = 0.27; p <.0001). Overall survival was statistically  similar 
between groups as expected due to a trial design that allowed crossover to reg orafenib  for 
disease progression (85% for placebo and 31% regorafenib randomized patients).  The 
median survival period without tumor growth among patients on regorafenib was  4.8 
months  while  for the control  group  on placebo  it was less than  a month.  The overall  disease 
control rate combining partial responses with durable stable disease for at least 12  weeks 
was 53%  with  regorafenib  compared  with  9% in the control  group.  The most  common  grade  
≥3 adverse events associated with regorafenib were hand -foot skin reaction  (56.1%), 
hypertension  (48.5%),  and diarrhea  (40.9%).  The efficacy  and safety  of the GRID  study  data 
supported FDA approval February  2013.  
 
Recently data from a randomized Phase II study of regorafenib in refractory metastatic 
colorectal cance r was presented at ASCO GI  2018 by Bekaii -Saab et al .  This study 
randomized patients to Arm A: 80 mg regorafenib per day, with weekly dose escalation of 
40 mg,  up to a dose of 160 mg per day if no significant drug -related toxicities were observed 
or Arm B : 160 mg regorafenib per day.  Arm A, the dose escalation arm had patients staying 
on regorafenib longer (43% initiating the 3rd cycle versus 25%, p=.028)  and had longer 
overall survival, (9.0 months vs. 5.9 months, p=.094) .  Progression free survival was not 
statistically significantly longer for Arm A (2.5 months versus 2.0 months, p =.553), but rates 
of overall grade 3/4 toxicity did favor Arm A (% p almar -plantar erythrodysethesia syndrome 
15 versus 16, hypertension 7 versus 15 and fatigue 13 versus 18).   
 
 
1.3 Correlative  Studies  
There  are no validated  biomarkers  to predict  efficacy  to anti VEGF  or anti VEGFR  targeted  therapy. 
There are promising markers identified such as VEGF or VEGFR mRNA expression or  germline 
0S-14-3  
8 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   
polymorphisms  in these  genes  which  have  been  shown  to be associated  with  outcomes,  however 
no prospective  clinical  trial with  sufficient  patient  samples  has been  tested.  There  is evidence  that 
VEGF  independent  pathways  may  play a critical  role in effectiveness  of bevacizumab  with  data 
showing  IL8, CXCR2,  IL1beta,  or IL6 are associated  with  outcome  either  measured  by plasma  levels 
or germline  polymorphisms.  
 
We will obtain archival tumor tissue and plasma samples at baseline and at the time  of 
progression to explore the biomarkers of benefit from  regorafenib.  
 
1.4 Rationale  
Regorafenib  is a multiple  kinase  inhibitor  (MKI)  targeting  several  receptor  tyrosine  kinases  (RTKs) 
that are involved in tumor progression (VEGFR -2, VEGFR -3, TIE -2, PDGFR -ß, c-KIT, RET and  FGFR - 
1) (VEGFR:  vascular  endothelial  growth  factor  receptor)  along  with  p38α,  a member  of the MAPK  
family.  In cellular  mechanistic  assays,  regorafenib  reduced  basal  phosphorylation  of the MAPK 
pathway in a panel of human breast, melanoma, and pancreatic tumor cel l lines. In other  cellular 
assays, regorafenib was found to be a potent inhibitor of human VEGFR -2, VEGFR -3, TIE -2, c-KIT, 
and PDGFR -ß receptor phosphorylation. In addition, regorafenib blocks VEGF dependent  MAPK 
activation  in human  endothelial  cells  and PDGF  dependent  cell proliferation  in primary  human 
vascular smooth muscle cells.  (BAYER Regorafenib package  insert)  
 
Given  the potential  treatment  of neuroendocrine  tumors  with  vegf  inhibition,  we are proposing  a 
phase  II study  with  regorafenib  as a single  agent  in patients  with  advanced/metastatic  NE tumors.

4.2 Toxicities and Dosing Delays/Dose  Modifications  
Any patient who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity.  
Each  patient will be assessed for the development of toxicity according to the Study  
Calendar. Toxicity will be assessed according to the NCI Comm on Terminology Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 4.0. Dose adjustments should be made according 
to the  system showing the greatest degree of  toxicity.  
 
 
4.2.1.1  Dose Levels  and Reductions  
Study medication will  be administered on a 3 weeks on/1week off schedule [3 weeks 
out of every 4]. A new  cycle of  therapy  can start  when  all toxicities,  (except  hand -
foot  syndrome,  alopecia,  non- refractory nausea/vomiting, non -refractory 
hypersensitivity and nonclinical  and asymptomatic laboratory abnorma lities) have 
resolved to Grade 2 or less.  Hand -foot syndrome must have resolved to Grade  0-1. 
Doses will be delayed or reduced for clinically significant hematologic and  non- 
hematologic  toxicities  that are related  to protocol  therapy  according  to the 
guid elines shown in the Dose Delays/Dose Modifications table that follows. Dose 
modifications  will follow  predefined  dose  levels.  Dose  adjustments  for hematologic  
toxicity  are based  on the blood counts obtained in preparation for the day of  
treatment.  
Strictly follow the modification in the following tables for the first two cycles until 
individual treatment tolerance can be ascertained.  Thereafter, these modifications 
should be regarded as guidelines to produce mild -to-moderate, but not deb ilitating, 
side effects.  If multiple adverse events are seen, administer dose based on greatest 
reduction required for any single adverse event observed.  Reductions or increases 
apply to treatment given in the preceding cycle and are based on adverse eve nts 
observed since the prior dose.

In addition to these recommended dose modifications, subjects who develop diarrhea,  mucositis, 
anorexia or other events predisposing to fluid loss or inadequate fluid intake should be  carefully 
monitored and rehydrated as clinically necessary. This is in order to minimize the risk of  postural  
hypotension and  renal  failure.

At first occurrence of HFSR, independent of grade, prompt institution of supportive measures 
such  as topical emollients, low potency steroids, or urea -containing creams should be  
administered.  
Recommended prevention/management strategies for skin toxicities consistent with HFSR  are 
summarized  below:  
Control of  calluses  
Before initiating treatment with  regorafenib:  
• Check condition of hands and  feet.  
• Suggest a manicure/pedicure, when  indicated.  
• Recommend pumice stone use for callus or ‘rough spot’  removal.  
• During regorafenib  treatment:  
 
• Avoid pressure  points.  
0S-14-3  
17 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   • Avoid items that rub, pinch or create  friction.  
Use of  creams  
• Non -urea based creams may be applied  liberally.  
• Keratolytic creams (e.g. urea -based creams, salicylic acid 6%) may be used sparingly and 
only  to affected (hyperkeratotic)  areas.  
• Alpha hydroxyl acids (AHA) based creams may be applied liberally 2 times a day.  
Approximately 5% to 8% provides gentle chemical  exfoliation.  
• Topical analgesics (e.g. lidocaine 2%) are to be considered for pain  control.  
• Topical corticosteroids like clobetasol 0.05% should be considered for subjects with Grade 
2 or 3 HFSR. Avoid systemic  steroids.  
Tender areas should be protected as  follows:  
• Use socks/gloves to cover moisturizing  creams  
• Wear well -padded  footwear  
• Use insole cushions or inserts (e.g. silicon,  gel) 
• Foot soaks with tepid water and Epson  salts  
 
Hypertension  
Hypertension  is a known  AE associated  with  regorafenib  treatment.  Subject  will have  their  blood  
pressure measured  at least  weekly  at the study  site during  the first 6 weeks  of treatment.  If 
additional  blood pressure measurements are done outside the study site, and the blood pressure is 
> 140 mm Hg  systolic or > 90 mm Hg diastol ic (NCI CTCAE v4.0), then the subject must contact study 
personnel.  The management  of hypertension,  including  the choice  of antihypertensive  medication,  
will be performed according to local standards and to the usual practice of the investigator. Every 
effort should be made  to control blood pressure by medical means other than study drug dose 
modification. If necessary, Table  4 outlines suggested dose  reductions.

Liver Function  Abnormalities  
For patients with observed worsening of serum liver tests considered related to regorafenib  
(i.e. where no alternative cause is evident, such as post -hepatic cholestasis or disease  
progression),  the dose modification and monitoring advice in Table 5 should be  followed.  
 
Regorafenib is a UGT1A1 inhibitor. Mild, indirect (unconjugated) hyperbilirubinemia  
may occur in patients with Gilbert’s  syndrome.

Restart:  If the potential  benefit  outweighs  the risk of 
hepatotoxicity, re -initiate Regorafenib  treatment, 
reduce dose by 40 mg (one tablet), and monitor  liver 
function weekly for at least 4  weeks.

occurrence  Discontinue treatment with Regorafenib  permanently.  
 
Monitor liver function weekly until resolution or  return 
to baseline.  
 
Exceptions: patients with Gilbert’s syndrome  who 
develop elevated transaminases should be managed  as 
per the above outlined recommendations for  the 
respective observed elevation of ALT and/or  AST.  
Weekly LFT monitoring for the first two cycles is  required.  
 
4.2.1.2  Prevention/management strategies for  diarrhea  
Diarrhea can be a common side effect of regorafenib. The preventive/management strategies  for 
diarrhea should be consistent with local standards (e.g., anti -diarrheas  and optimized hydration  status).  
Anti-diarrhea  medications  may  be introduced  if symptoms  occur.  Previous  trials  have  shown  that 
the diarrhea  could  be managed  with  loperamide.  The recommended  dose  of loperamide  is 4 mg at first 
onset, followed by 2 mg every 2 to 4 hours until diarrhea -free for 12  hours.  
 
4.3 Concomitant  Medications/Treatments  
 
All medication  that is considered  necessary  for the subject’s  welfare,  and which  is not expected  
to interfere with the evaluation of the study treatment, may be given at the discretion of the  
investigator. All  medications  (including  contrast  media)  taken  within  2 weeks  prior  to the start  of the 
study  and during the study  must  be recorded  in the subject’s  source  documentation  and in the CRF 
(including  start/stop dates, dose frequency, route of administration, and indication). Specific caution 
should be taken  when considering or administering a concomitant medication that is metabolized by 
the cytochrome  enzymes CYP2C8, CYP2B6 and CYP2C9.  Such concomita nt medication should be 
0S-14-3  
20 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   avoided, if  possible.  
Co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer (rifampin) with a single 160 mg dose of Stivarga  
decreased the mean exposure of regorafenib, increased the mean exposure of the active metabolite 
M-5, and resulted  in no change  in the mean  exposure  of the active  metabolite  M-2. Avoid  
concomitant  use of Stivarga  with  strong  CYP3A4  inducers  (e.g.  rifampin,  phenytoin,  carbamazepine,  
phenobarbital,  and St. John’s Wort)  
Co administration  of a strong  CYP3A4  inhibitor  (ketoconazole)  with  a single  160mg  dose  of 
regorafenib increased  the mean  exposure  of regorafenib  and decreased  the mean  exposure  of the 
active  metabolites M -2 and M -5. Avoid concomitant use of Stivarga  with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 
activity  (e.g. clarithromycin, grapefruit juice, itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazadone, posaconazole,  
telithromycin, and voriconazole).  
 
 
Permitted concomitant therapy  includes:  
• Standard therapies for concurrent medical  conditions.  
• Supportive care for any underlying  illness.  
• Palliative radiation therapy is allowed if the target lesion(s) are not included within the  
radiation field and no more than 10% of the bone marrow is  irradiated.  
• Granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G-CSF) and other hematopoietic growth factors may  
be used in the management of acute toxicity, such as febrile neutropenia, when clinically  
indicated or  at the investigator’s  discretion.  However,  they  may  not be substituted  for a 
required  dose reduction. Subjects are permitted to take chronic  erythropoietin.  
• Treatment with nonconventional therapies (such as acupuncture), and  vitamin/mineral 
supplements are permitted provided that  they do not interfere with the study endpoints, in  
the opinion of the  investigator.  
• Bisphosphonates  
• Octreotide  
• Subjects  who  are therapeutically  treated  with  an agent  such  as warfarin  or heparin  will be 
allowed to participate provided that their medication dose and INR/PTT are stable. Close 
monitoring  (day  5 of cycle  1 and day 1 of each  cycle)  is mandatory.  If either  of these  
values  are above  the therapeutic  range,  the doses  should  be modified  and the assessments  
should  be repeated  weekly until they are  stable.  
The following are not  permitted:  
• Other investigational treatment during or within 30 days before starting study  treatment  
• Systemic antitumor therapy, including cytotoxic therapy, signal transduction  inhibitors, 
immunotherapy, and hormonal  therapy  
 
• Bone marrow transplant or stem cell  rescue  
• Subjects taking narrow therapeutic index medications should be monitored proactively (e.g. 
warfarin, phenytoin, quinidine, carbamazepine, Phenobarbital, cycloosporin, and  digox in). 
Warfarin  is metabolized  by the cytocrome  enzyme  CYP2C9  and it’s levels  may  be 
0S-14-3  
21 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   especially affected by  regorafenib  
• Use of any herbal remedy (e.g. St. John’s wort [Hypericum  perforatum])  
 
4.4 Duration of  Therapy  
In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse events, treatment may continue  until:  
• Disease  progression  
• Inter -current illness that prevents further administration of  treatment  
• Unacceptable adverse  event(s)  
• Patient decides to withdraw from the study,  OR 
• General or specific changes in the patient’s condition that render the  patient 
unacceptable for further treatment in the judgment of the  investigator.  
 
4.5 Removal of Patients from Protocol  Therapy  
Patients  can be taken  off the study  treatment  and/or  study  at any time  at their  own 
request, or they may be withdrawn at the discretion of the investigator for  safety, 
behavioral or administrative reasons. The reason(s) for discontinuation of treatment  will 
be documented and may  include:  
• Patient withdraws consent  (follow -up); 
• Patient is unable to comply with protocol  requirements;  
• Patient demonstrates disease progression (unless continued treatment with  study 
drug is deemed appropriate at the discretion of the  investigator);  
• Patient experiences toxicity that makes continuation in the protocol  unsafe;  
• Treating physician determines continuation on the study would not be in  the 
patient’s best interest;  
• Patient  becomes  pregnant  (pregnancy  to be reported  along  same  timelines  as a 
serious adverse  event);  
• Development of second malignancy (except for basal cell carcinoma or  squamous 
cell carcinoma  of the skin)  that requires  treatment,  which  would  interfere  with  this 
study;  
• Lost to follow -up. If a research  subject  cannot  be located  to document  survival  after 
a period  of 2 years,  the subject  may  be considered  “lost  to follow -up.”  All attempts 
to contact the subject during the two years must be documented in  CRF’s.  
 
 
4.6 Duration of Follow  Up 
Patients will be followed with phone calls every 3 months until death after removal  from 
treatment.  Patients  removed  from  treatment  for unacceptable  adverse  events  will be 
followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse  event.

6.0 Measurement  of Effect  
 
6.1 Antitumor Effect - Solid  Tumors  
Response and progression will be evaluated in this study using the new  international 
criteria  proposed  by the Response  Evaluation  Criteria  in Solid  Tumors  (RECIST)  
Committee [ JNCI 92(3):205 -216, 2000]. Changes in only the largest diameter 
(unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST v1.1  
criteria.  
 
6.1.1  Definitions  
Evaluable  for toxicity . All patients  will be included  in the toxicity  summaries,  
from the time of their first treatment with study  drug.  
 
All patients  must  be accounted  for in the summary  of objective  response  
(see Section 10.4 for more details). To formally classify a patient as  RECIST -
evaluable, only those patients who have measurable disease present at 
baseline, and  have had their disease re -evaluated will be considered 
evaluable. These pat ients  will have their response classified according to the 
definitions stated below.  (Note : Patients  who  exhibit  objective  disease  
progression  prior  to the end of Cycle  1 will also be considered  evaluable.)  
 
 
6.1.2  Disease Parameters (RECIST  1.1) 
Measurable disease . Measurable lesions are defined as those that can  be 
accurately  measured  in at least  one dimension  (longest  diameter  to be 
recorded) as  >20 mm with  conventional  techniques  (CT, MRI,  x-ray) or as >10 
mm with  spiral CT  scan.  All tumor  measurements  must  be recorded  in 
millimeters  (or decimal fractions of  centimeters).  
 
Note: Previously irradiated lesions are non -measurable except in cases  of 
documented progression of the lesion since the completion of radiation  
therapy.  
 
Non -measurable  disease . All other  lesions  (or sites  of disease),  including  
small lesions  (longest  diameter  <20 mm with  conventional  techniques  or <10 
mm using spiral CT scan), are considered non -measurable disease. Bone  
lesions,  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions,  
lymphangitis cutis/pulmonis,  inflammatory  breast  disease,  abdominal  masses  
(not  followed  by CT or MRI), and cystic lesions are all  non-measurable.  
 
Target  lesions.  All measurable  lesions  up to a maximum  of 2 lesions  per organ  
and 5  lesions  in total,  representative  of all involved  organs,  should  be 
identified  as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target 
lesions should  be selected  on the basis  of their  size (lesion s with  the longest  
diameter)  and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either 
by imaging techniques  or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all 
0S-14-3  
27 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   target lesions will  be calculated  and reported  as the baseline  sum  LD. The 
baseline  sum  LD will be used as reference by which to characterize the 
objective tumor  response.  
 
Malignant lymph nodes. To be considered pathologically enlarged  and 
measurable,  a lymph  node  must  be >15 mm in short  axis when  assessed  by 
CT scan (CT scan slice thickness recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  
At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis will be measured and  
followed.  
 
Non -target  lesions . All other  lesions  (or sites  of disease)  including  any 
measurable lesions  over  and above  the 5 target  lesions  should  be identified  
as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements 
of these  lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should 
be noted throughout follow -up. 
 
6.1.3  Methods for Evaluation of Me asurable  Disease  
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation using a  ruler 
or calipers.  All baseline  evaluations  should  be performed  as closely  as possible  to 
the beginning  of treatment  and never  more  than  28 days  before  the beginning  of 
the treatment.  
 
The same method of assessment and the same technique should be used  to 
characterize  each  identified  and reported  lesion  at baseline  and during  follow -up. 
Imaging -based  evaluation  is preferred  to evaluation  by clinical  examination  when 
both methods have been used to assess the antitumor effect of a  treatment.  
 
Conventional  CT and MRI.  These  techniques  should  be performed  with  cuts of 10 
mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed using  a 
5 mm contiguous reconstruction algorithm. This applies to tumors of the  chest, 
abdomen, and  pelvis.  
 
Cytology, Histology. These techniques can be used to differentiate  between 
partial responses (PR) and complete responses (CR) in rare cases (e.g.,  residual 
lesions in tumor types, such as germ cell tumors, where known residual  benign 
tumors can  remain).  
 
The cytological confirmation of the neoplastic origin of any effusion that  appears 
or worsens  during  treatment  when  the measurable  tumor  has met criteria  for 
response or stable disease is mandatory to differentiate between response  or 
stable  disease  (an effusion  may  be a side effect  of the treatment)  and progressive 
disease.  
 
6.1.4  Response  Criteria  
 
6.1.4.1  Evaluation of Target  Lesions  
Complete  Response  (CR): Disappearance  of all target  lesions,  determined 
by two separate  observations  conducted  not less than  4 weeks  apart. 
0S-14-3  
28 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   There can be no appearance of new  lesions.  
 
Partial Response (PR) : At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the  longest 
diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum  LD. 
There can be no appearance of new  lesions.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) : At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD  of 
target  lesions,  taking  as reference  the smallest  sum  LD recorded  since  the 
treatment started, or the appearance of one or more new  lesions.  
 
Stable  Disease  (SD): Neither  sufficient  shrinkage  to qualify  for PR nor 
sufficient  increase  to qualify  for PD, taking  as reference  the smallest  sum 
LD since the treatment  started.  
 
6.1.4.2  Evaluation of Non -Target  Lesions  
Complete  Response  (CR): Disappearance  of all non-target  lesions  and 
normalization of tumor marker  level.  
 
Incomplete  Response/Stable  Disease  (SD): Persistence  of one or more 
non-target  lesion(s)  and/or  maintenance  of tumor  marker  level  above  the 
normal  limits.  
 
Progressive  Disease  (PD) : Appearance  of one or more  new  lesions  and/or 
unequivocal progression of existing non -target  lesions  
 
6.1.4.3  Evaluation of Best Overall  Response  
The best  overall  response  is the best  response  recorded  from  the start  of 
the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as  reference 
for progressive disease the smallest measurements recorded since  the 
treatment started). The patient's best response assignment will  depend 
on the a chievement of both measurement and confirmation  criteria.

Note : Patients with a global deterioration of health status  requiring 
discontinuation of treatment without objective evidence  of 
disease progression at that time should be reported  as 
“symptomatic deterioration” . Every effort should be made  to 
document the objective progression even after  discontinuation 
of treatment.  
 
Note: If subjects respond to treatment and are able to have their  disease 
resected, the patient’s response will be assessed prior to the  surgery.  
 
6.1.5  Confirmation of  Response:  
Confirmation of response is not required in this trial as response is not  the 
primary  endpoint.  
 
6.1.6  Duration of  Response  
Duration of overall response : The duration of overall response is measured  from 
the time measurement criteria are met for CR or PR (whichever is first  recorded) 
until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is  objectively 
documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the  smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment  started).  
 
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria  are 
first met for CR until  the first date  that recurrent  disease  is objectively 
documented.  
 
Duration  of stable  disease : Stable  disease  is measured  from  the start  of the 
treatment  until  the criteria  for progression  are met,  taking  as reference  the 
smallest measurements recorded since the treatment  started.  
 
6.1.7  Progression -Free Survival  (PFS)  
Progression -free survival  (PFS)  is defined  as the duration  of time  from  start  of 
treatment to time of progression or death on study whichever comes  first. 
Patients who go off treatment for reasons other than disease progression  or 
death will be censored at the time of the last CT  scan.  
 
6.1.8  Time to Treatment Failure  (TTF)  
Time to treatment failure is defined as from start of treatment until time  to 
progression, death, start of alternate therapy or development of  secondary 
malignancy, whichever comes  first.  
0S-14-3  
30 
Protocol version 03.13.2018    
6.1.9  Overall Survival  (OS)  
Overall  survival  is defined  as from  start  of treatment  until  death  due to any cause. 
Otherwise OS is censored on the last day patients are known to be  alive.  
 
6.1.10   The primary endpoint : 
 
 
 
The 6 -month PFS rate is the primary endpoint. The 6-month PFS is  dichotomous,  
yes or no. Radiographic  scan  for disease  measurement  that is done  within  ±14 
days  of the 6-month  landmark  (Day  182 since  first receiving  study  drug)  will be 
counted to determine the 6 -month PFS status. Patients who are alive  and 
progression -free at 6 months  (182  days)  since  first starting  regorafenib  will be 
counted  as ‘yes’ for the 6-month  PFS. Patients  who  progress  or die within  6 
months  of starting  regorafenib  will be counted  as ‘no’ for the 6-month  PFS. 
Patients  whose  status  of progression  or death  at 6 months  is unknown  due to 
early withdrawal, loss -of-follow -up, or other reasons will be also counted as  ‘no’ 
for 6 -month  PFS. 
 
6.2 Safety/tolerability  
Analyses of safety/ toxicity will be performed for all patients having received at least  
one dose  of study  drug.  The study  will use the CTCAE  version  4 for reporting  of non-
hematologic adverse events ( http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html ) and modified 
criteria  for hematologic adverse  events.  
 
7.1 ADVERSE  EVENTS  
 
7.1 Adverse Event  Monitoring  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every  
clinical trial,  are done  to ensure  the safety  of Subjects  enrolled  in the studies  as well as 
those  who will  enroll  in future  studies  using  similar  agents.  Adverse  events  are 
reported  in a routine manner  at scheduled  times  during  a trial.  Additionally,  certain  
adverse  events  must  be reported  in an expedited  manner  to allow  for optimal  
monitoring  of patient  safety  and care.  
 
All patients  experiencing  an adverse  event,  regardless  of its relationship  to study  
drug, will be monitored  until:  
➢ the adverse event resolves or the symptoms or signs that constitute the  
adverse event return to  baseline;  
➢ any abnormal laboratory values have returned to  baseline;  
➢ there  is a satisfactory  explanation  other  than  the study  drug  for the 
changes observed;  or 
➢ death.  
 
7.2 Definitions  
 
7.2.1 Definition of Adverse  Event  
0S-14-3  
31 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient  
receiving study treatment and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship  with this  treatment.  An AE can therefore  be any unfavorable  
and unintended  sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, 
or disease  temporally associated with the use of an experimental 
intervention, whether or not  related to the  intervention.  
 
7.2.2 Severity of Adverse  Events  
 
All adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common  Terminology 
Criteria  for Adverse  Events  (CTCAE)  version  4.0. The CTCAE  v4 is available  at 
http://ctep.cancer.gov/reporting/ctc.html  
 
If no CTCAE grading is available, the severity of an AE is graded as  follows:  
Mild  (grade  1): the event  causes  discomfort  without  disruption  of normal  daily 
activities.  
Moderate (grade 2): the event causes discomf ort that affects normal  daily 
activities.  
Severe  (grade  3): the event  makes  the patient  unable  to perform  normal  daily 
activities or significantly affects his/her clinical  status.  
Life-threatening  (grade  4): the patient  was at risk of death  at the time  of the 
event.  
Fatal (grade 5): the event caused  death.  
 
7.2.3 Serious Adverse  Events  
A “serious” adverse event is defined in regulatory terminology as any  untoward 
medical occurrence  that:  
 
7.3.3.1  Results in death.  
If death results from (progression of) the disease, the disease  should 
be reported as event (SAE)  itself.  
 
7.3.3.2  Is life-threatening.  
(the patient was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does  not 
refer  to an event  that hypothetically  might  have  caused  death  if it 
were more  severe).  
 
7.3.3.3  Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of  existing  
hospitalization for ≥ 24  hours.  
 
7.3.3.4  Results in persistent or significant disability or  incapacity.  
 
7.3.3.5  Is a congenital anomaly/birth  defect  
 
7.3.3.6  Is an important medical  event  
0S-14-3  
32 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   Any event  that does  not meet  the above  criteria,  but that in the 
judgment of the investigator jeopardizes the patient, may  be 
considered  for reporting  as a serious  adverse  event.  The event  may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of  the 
outcomes listed in the d efinition of “Serious Adverse  Event“.  
For example: allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment  in 
an emergency  room  or at home;  convulsions  that may  not result  in 
hospitalization; development of drug abuse or drug  dependency.  
 
7.3 Steps to Determine If an Adverse Event Requires Expedited  Reporting  
Step 1 : Identify the type of adverse event using the NCI Common Terminology  Criteria 
for Adverse Events (CTCAE  v4). 
 
Step 2 : Grade the adverse event using the NCI CTCAE  v4. 
 
Step 3 : Determine whether the adverse event is related to the protocol  therapy 
Attribution categories are as  follows:  
- Definite – The AE is clearly related to the study  treatment.  
- Probable – The AE is likely related to the study  treatment.  
- Possible – The AE may be related to the study  treatment.  
- Unlikely —The AE is unlikely related to the study  treatment.  
- Unrelated – The AE is clearly NOT related to the study  treatment.  
Note : This includes  all events  that occur  within  30 days  of the last dose  of protocol 
treatment.  Any event  that occurs  more  than  30 days  after  the last dose  of treatment  and 
is attributed (possibly, probably, or definitely) to the agent(s) must also be  reported 
accordingly.  
 
Step 4 :  Determine the prior experience of the adverse  event.  
Expected events are those that have been previously identified as resulting  from 
administration of the agent. An adverse event is considered unexpected, for  expedited 
reporting  purposes  only,  when  either  the type  of event  or the severity  of the event  is not 
listed  in: 
• the drug package  insert;  
• the current Investigator’s  Brochure

The investigator  must  report  to Bayer  any pregnancy  occurring  in a study  subject,  or in 
his partner, during the subject’s participation in this study. The report should  be 
submitted within the same timelines as an SAE, although a pregnancy per se is  not 
considered an  SAE.  
For a study subject, the outcome of the pregnancy should be followed up carefully,  and 
any abnormal outcome of the mother or the child should be  reported.  
For the pregnancy  of a study  subject’s  partner, all efforts  should  be made  to obtain  similar 
information on course and outcome, subject to the partner’s  consent.  
Progressive  disease  
If progressive disease leads to signs and symptoms that meet the criteria  for an  SAE (i.e., 
hospitalization, disability, death, or important medical event), the signs  and symptoms  
should  be reported  as an SAE to Bayer  and not the underlying  progressive di sease.  
Death  
If any subject  dies during  the trial or within  30 days  of the end-of-treatment  visit,  the 
investigator will inform Bayer and record the cause of death in detail (within 24  hours.  
 
All non -USC sites are required to notify the study chair, Dr . Iqbal  and the multi -site 
coordinator of all SAE submissions. Investigators should also report events to their IRB as 
required.  
SAE notification to the FDA:  
• USC: study team to work with CISO QA to submit to the FDA using MedWatch 3500A form 
in accordance within the FDA required timelines  
 
0S-14-3  
34 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   • Non -USC site: study team to notify USC PI within 24hrs of site becoming aware of the event 
by completing a MedWatch 3500A form. USC will review and submit applicable reports to 
the FDA and notify Bayer  of the F DA submission.  
The study sponsor, USC, will be responsible for notifying FDA of any unexpected fatal or 
life-threatening suspected adverse reaction as soon as possible but in no case later than 7 
calendar days after the sponsor's initial receipt of the inf ormation.  
 
IRB reporting  
• The Institutional IRB must be notified of “any unanticipated  problems 
involving  risk to subjects  or others”  in accordance  with  the Institutional 
policy.  Such  policies  will be provided  to the CISO  QA prior  to enrolling  1st 
patient. The following events meet the definition of  UPR:  
1. Any serious event (injuries, side effects, deaths or other  problems), 
which  in the opinion  of the Principal  Investigator  was unanticipated, 
involved  risk to subjects  or others,  and was possibly  related  to the 
research  procedures.  
2. Any serious accidental or unintentional change to the  IRB-approved  
protocol that alters the level of  risk. 
3. Any deviation from the protocol taken without prior IRB review  to 
eliminate apparent immediate hazard to  a research  subject.  
4. Any new information (e.g., publication, safety monitoring  report, 
updated sponsor safety report), interim result or other finding  that 
indicates an unexpected change to the risk/benefit ratio for  the 
research.  
5. Any breach in confidentiality that may involve risk to the subject  or 
others.  
6. Any complaint of a subject that indicates an unanticipated risk or  that 
cannot be resolved by the Principal  Investigator.  
• The USC NCCC  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Committee  (DSMC)  must  be 
notif ied within 24 hours of submission of such reportable event to the  IRB. 
The patient ID and the study number as well as identifier of the SAE  report 
should be submitted to the DSMC Coordinator via email or Fax to  the 
attention of the DSMC Coordinator at  323-865-0089.  
• The FDA should be notified within 7 business days of any unexpected  fatal 
or life -threatening adverse event with possible relationship to study  drug, 
and 15 business days of any event that is considered: 1) serious,  2) 
unexpected, and 3) at least possibly related to study  participation.  
 
7.4.2  Routine  Reporting  
• All other adverse events - such as those that are expected, or are unlikely  or 
definitely  not related  to the study  participation - are to be reported  annually 
as part of regular data submissio n. This report should also be forwarded  to 
0S-14-3  
35 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   the DSMC  Coordinator.  A list of all toxicities  will be included  in the IND 
annual report.  
 
7.5 Stopping  Rules  (Monitoring  rules  for safety)  
Although  we expect  that regorafenib  be well tolerated,  the guidelines  listed  below  will be used  to 
raise  a flag if the number  of patients  who  experience  unacceptable  toxicity  is large  enough  to 
strongly suggest that the true probability of unacceptable toxicity is 33% or  higher.  
 
Unacceptable toxicity will be defined  as 
• Any Grade 3 non -hematologic toxicity not reversible to Grade 1 or less within 96 hours  with 
the exception of Grade 3 diarrhea  or 
• Any Grade 4 non -hematologic toxicity  or 
• Any Grade  4 hematologic  toxicity  not resolving  to Grade  1 or less within  5 days,  despite  
supportive care  or 
• Grade 4 neutropenia associated with fever  or 
• Grade 4  thrombocytopenia.  
 
An unacceptable  toxicity,  regardless  of attribution,  observed  during  any course,  will be used  in 
the decision to suspend accrual. Two cohorts will be monitored  separately.  
To be evaluable  for excessive  toxicity  a patient  must  complete  a minimum  of 2 courses  of 
treatment  or have  experienced  unacceptable  toxicity.  Patients  who  do not complete  2 courses 
and who  do not experience  any unacceptable  toxicity  will not be used  in the decision  to continue 
or suspend  accrual  to the trials,  for reasons  for excessive  toxicity.  Every  time  unacceptable  toxicity 
is observed,  the number  of patients  (X) who  have  experienced  unacceptable  toxicity  will be 
compared to the number of patients (N) who are evaluable for excessive toxicity. If the  number 
of patients,  N, is greater  than  NX, the number  given  in column  2 of the Table  XX, below,  then 
accrual will not be suspended. If N is less than or equal to N X, then accrual will be suspended  for 
review of the  data.  
 
Table XX: Criteria for continuing  accrual  
 
X: # pts who experienced a DLT in a  cohort  3 4 5 6 ≥7 
Nx: Suspend trial of # evaluable pts. (N) is  Nx  in a cohort  5 10 15 20 suspend  
 
Using  this rule with  24 patients,  the probability  of correctly  suspending  this regimen  for 
review toxicities  is 0.79  if the true  chance  of unacceptable  toxicity  is 33%.  The probability  
of falsely  suspending this regimen for review toxicities is 0.030, if the true chance of 
unacceptable  toxicity is 10%. Estimations of the probabilities of suspending this regimen are 
based on  10,000 simulations.

10.0 STATISTICAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
0S-14-3  
38 
Protocol version 03.13.2018    
10.1 Study Design/Study  Endpoints  
The 6-month  PFS rate will be the primary  endpoint  (see  definition  at section  6.1.10).  Two  
parallel Simon’s  2-stage  phase  II trials  will be conducted  to evaluate  the efficacy  of regorafenib  
in patients with advanced carcinoid (cohort A) or pancreatic islet cell tumors (cohort B).14 Two  
randomized phase  III trials  [refs  10-11] that were  completed  for advanced  pancreatic  islet cell 
tumors  observed the  median  PFS was about  11 months  and 6-month  PFS rate was 71%  in 
arm of the anti-VEGF  therapy. Two small phase II trials of anti -VEGF agents that were 
conducted among patients  with advanced carcinoid tumor [refs 14 -15] showed that the 
median PFS was about 6 months and  6- month  PFS rate was 45%.  Therefore  6-month  PFS rate 
of 65%  for patients  with  advanced  carcinoid and 80% for patients with advanced pancreatic 
islet cell tumors would be promising for  further investigation.  Otherwise  observation  of 40%  
and 60%  6-month  PFS rate would  be conside red ineffective in the setting of advanced 
carcinoid and pancreatic islet cell tumors,  respectively.  
 
For cohort A, a 6 -month PFS rate of 40% (under the null hypothesis) would be considered  as 
disappointing  and 65%  or higher  (under  the alternative  hypothesis)  would  be encouraging.  For 
cohort  B, a 57%  rate (under  the null hypothesis)  would  be considered  as not interesting,  and 80% or  
higher  (under  the alternative  hypothesis)  would  be promising.  The 6-month  PFS rates  under  
the null and alternative  hypotheses  were  chosen  based  on a phase  II consortium  trial in the similar 
settings  (NCI Protocol  #: 8233 ). We need  a total  of 24 patients  with  carcinoid  tumors  (cohort  A) and 
24 patients with pancreatic islet cell tumors (cohort  B). 
 
10.2 Sample Size and  Accrual  
In cohort  A, 11 patients  will be enrolled  in stage  I. If 5 or more  patients  remain  alive  and 
progression -free at 6 months, we will continue to enroll until a total of 24 patients are  enrolled. 
If 4 or fewer patients out of the first 11 patients remain alive and progression -free at 6 months, 
we will suspend the accrual. If we observe 14 or more patients are alive and progression -free at 
6 months, regorafenib would be considered promisin g for cohort A as long as it is  tolerable.  
 
In cohort  B, 11 patients  will be enrolled  in stage  I. If 7 or more  patients  remain  alive  and 
progression -free at 6 months, we will continue to enroll until a total of 24 patients are  enrolled. 
If 6 or fewer patients out of the first 11 patients remain alive and progression -free at 6 months, 
we will suspend the accrual. If we observe 18 or more patients are alive and progression -free at 
6 months, regorafenib would be considered promisin g for cohort B as long as it is  tolerable.  
 
We will not suspend  accrual  when  the number  of patients  enrolled  meets  the goal for the number 
of patients  required  for stage  I in each  trial but the decision  of suspending  the accrual  during  stage  
I cannot be reached due to the insufficient  follow -up. 
 
The study  design  of both  trials  has 80%  power  to demonstrate  the efficacy  of regorafenib.  The 
type  I error  rate is 5.1%  and 5.3%,  for cohort  A and B, respectively.  We designed  the trials  with 
type I error rate a little higher than 5% because the tumors are rare and the sample size  should  
be as small  as possible.  The sample  size calculation  was based  on a single -arm 2-stage  Simon’s 
Minimax  phase  II Design.  An online  program  (Clinical  Trial  Design  Systems)  developed  by Duke 
Cancer  Institute  was used  to perform  the calculation  
(http://www.dukecancerinstit ute.org/research/shared -resources/biostatistics/clinical -trial- 
0S-14-3  
39 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   design -systems/ ). 
 
 
10.3 Data Analyses  Plans  
Two  cohorts  will be analyzed  separately.  The primary  data  analysis  set will include  all patients 
who enroll the study and start to receive regorafenib for decision making in accrual  and 
warranting  further  studies.  Patients  who  withdraw  the study,  are lost to follow -up, or start 
another  therapy  before  the status  of 6-month  PFS is determined  will be counted  as ‘no’ for the 
primary  endpoint  and be included  in the primary  data  analysis  set. Patients  who  drop  out the trial 
before starting regorafenib will be replaced and excluded from the primary data analysis  set. 
 
The primary endpoint, 6 -month PFS rate will be summarized as a proportion of patients who  are 
alive  and progression -free among  all patients  in the primary  data  analysis  set. The 95%  confidence 
intervals of the 6 -month PFS rate will be calculated using the Wilson method. We chose  6-month 
as the cut-off point  because  it would  be easier  to compare  with  the historical  data.  The tumor 
response will be evaluated by CT scans every 2 cycles starting wit h week 3 of cycle 2.  Six-months 
since  starting  treatment  are 182 days,  may  not be on the CT scan  date.  CT scans  will not on the 
strict schedules. Additional scans may be conducted to confirm a complete or partial  response. 
Patients whose systems deteriorate clinically will be counted as progression event  without 
confirmation of CT scans. CT scans that are conducted within ±14 days of the landmark Day 182  
will be used to determine the 6 -month PFS status if there are no other scans available  to 
dete rmine  the status.  The detailed  status  of 6-month  PFS will be counted  as follows:  alive  and 
progression -free, disease progression within 6 months, death within 6 months, and  progression 
at 6 months unknown due to early withdrawal, toxicities, or other  reasons.  
 
A sensitivity analysis of PFS at week 24 will be conducted. The PFS rate at week 24 may  provide 
the impact of CT scheduling on estimating the 6 -month PFS  rate.  
 
In addition,  progression -free survival  (see definition  at section  6.1.7)  will be analyzed  using 
Kaplan -Meier curves. The median PFS and 95%CIs will be calculated. The probability of  6-month 
PFS will be estimated from the KM curve  too. 
 
The secondary endpoints including tumor response rate and OS (see definition at section  6.1.9) 
will be analyzed  descriptively.  
 
Tumor  response  rate will be calculated  as a proportion  of patients  who  have  either a  complete  or 
partial  response  among  all patients  in the primary  data  analysis  set. The 95%  confidence  intervals 
will be  given.  
 
OS will be analyzed in the same way as  PFS. 
 
Toxicity profile will be summarized by attribution: regorafenib -related and all reported,  course: 
cycle 1 and all cycles, type, and grade: grade 1 -2, 3-4, and 5.

10.4.2  Evaluation of response. All patients included in the study must  be 
assessed for response to treatment, even if there are major protocol  
treatment deviations or if they are ineligible. Each patient will be assigned 
one of  the following categories: 1) complete response, 2) partial 
response, 3) stable  disease,  4) progressive disease, 5) early death from 
malignant disease, 6) early death  from toxicity,  7) early  death  because  
of other  cause,  or 9) unknown  (not assessable, insufficient  data).  
 
All of the patients who met the eligibility criteria (with the possible exception of  those 
who never received any study drug) should be included in the mai n analysis of  the 
response rate. Patients in response categories 4 -9 should be considered to have  a 
treatment failure. Thus, an incorrect treatment schedule or drug administration  does 
not result in exclusion from the analysis of the response  rate.  
 
The primary analysis will be based on all eligible patients and who received any  amount 
of study  drug.  
 
10.5 Data analysis plan for the exploratory  objective  
Biomarkers such as mRNA levels or germline variations of genes related to angiogenesis will  
be measured  once the study  is completed  and regorafenib  is recommended  for further  studies  
in the setting.  The associations  between  biomarkers  and clinical  outcomes  (6-month  PFS, 
response,  PFS, and  OS) will be analyzed  in univariate  analysis  first using  appropriate  
methods.  Multivariable analyses will be conducted to evaluate the independent effect of a 
marker on clinical  outcome. All  tests  will be two-sided  at a significance  level  of 0.05.  P values  
will be adjusted  for multiple comparisons. The purpose of the correlative study is to generate 
hypotheses that will  be examined for future clinical  trials.  
 
 
11.1 STUDY  MANAGEMENT  
 
11.1 Conflict of  Interest  
 
All investigators will follow the University conflict of interest policy. Any USC  
investigator who  has a conflict  of interest  with  this study  (patent  ownership,  royalties,  
or financial  gain greater than the minimum allowable by their institution, etc.) must 
complete  a “Statement of Outside Interests Related to Research” Form. The 
application is  reviewed and approved  by the Conflict  of Interest  Review  Committee  
(CIRC)  USC conflict  of interest policy is available  at 
http://ooc.usc.edu/conflict -interest -research  
 
11.2 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approval and Consent  Process  
It is expected  that the IRB will have  the proper  representation  and function  in 
accordance with federally mandated regulations. The IRB should approve the consent 
form  and protocol and all study  related documents used in the study (e.g. QOL 
questionnaire,  pill diary, brochure, advertisement  etc).  
0S-14-3  
41 
Protocol version 03.13.2018    
In obtaining  and documenting  informed  consent,  the investigator  should  comply  with  
the applicable regulatory requirement(s), and should adhere to Good Clinical Practice  
(GCP) and to ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of  Helsinki.  
 
Before recruitment and enrollment onto this study, the patient will be given a  full 
explanation  of the study  and will be given  the opportunity  to review  the consent  
form. Each consent form must include all the relevant elements currently required by 
the FDA Regulations  and local  or state  regulations.  Once  this essential  information  
has been provided to the patient and the investigator  is assured that the patient 
understands  the implications  of participating  in the study,  the patient  will be asked  
to give consent  to participate in the study by signing a dated IRB -approved consent  
form.  
 
Prior  to a patient’s  participation  in the trial,  the written  informed  consent  form  should  
be signed and personally dated by the patient and by the person authorized to obtain  
the informed  consent  
 
11.3 Required Documentation (for multi -site studies)  
Before the study can be initiated at any site, the following documentation must  be 
provided to the Clinical Investigation Support Office  (CISO)  
• A copy of the official IRB approval letter for the protocol and informed  consent  
• IRB membership  list 
• CVs and medical licensure for the principal investigator and a ny associate 
investigators who will be involved in the  study  
• Protocol signature page with Investigator  signature  
• Form FDA 1572 appropriately filled out and signed with appropriate  documentation  
• A copy of the IRB -approved consent  form  
• CAP and CLIA Laborator y certification numbers and institution lab normal  values  
• Executed clinical research  contract  
 
11.4 Registration  Procedures 
Multi -Site Registration:  
All participants in the multi -site trial are subject to central registration, which is used for 
tracking study accrual, checking eligibility, and monitoring adequate participation of 
women and minorities. Subject registration will be conducted through the coordinating 
center at the NCCC -CISO. External sites will identify eligible subjects and verify enrollmen t 
availability with the MCC prior to consenting patients. The external site is required to 
notify the MCC of a new signed informed consent within 48 business hours and note the 
basic consent information on the screening log. A copy of the consent will acco mpany the 
complete eligibility packet for verification. The MCC will enter the patient, demographic, 
and consent information in the applicable USC database. The MCC will assign a study 
patient sequence ID and communicate this to the external site.  
 
The Coordinating Center Program Hours are 8 am to 4 pm,  Monday through Friday, based 
0S-14-3  
42 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   on the PST zone. The MCC will be closed on official government holidays unless otherwise 
indicated. The contact number for the MCC is 323 -865-3122. A copy of the registration 
sheet is located in the Appendix. 
 
External sites will verify eligibility prior to submitting documents to the MCC for central 
registration. External sites must submit registration requests to the MCC at least one full 
business day prior to the planned tre atment start date. Registration will require the 
external site to submit to the MCC all of the following:  
 
• A completed registration form with patient demographics:  
• Zip code  
• Age 
• Sex 
• Race  
• Ethnicity  
• Initials  
• Date of Birth (DOB)  
• A completed Eligibility Checkli st signed by the investigator  
• A copy of the most recently IRB -approved, patient signed informed consent form  
• All required screening tests, within the time parameters specified by the protocol study 
calendar  
• All other de -identified source documents needed t o verify all points of eligibility  
• Any On -Study forms for registration specified by protocol  
 
These documents must be securely emailed to the MCC staff. With advance notice 
documents will also be accepted faxed to 323 -865-0457. The MCC will verify complete ness 
of documents and confirm eligibility. The MCC will enter the registration information in 
the USC OnCore® database. The MCC will then fax or securely email the completed 
Registration Form with the assigned study sequence ID to the external site as conf irmation 
of patient registration.  
An external site must maintain a log of all subjects who sign informed consents. The log 
must also document an explanation for exclusion due to screen failure. The MCC will 
provide sites with a Patient Tracking Log at the time of site activation. In the event of 
screen failure, external sites must submit the Screen Failure form to the MCC within one 
business day of determining screen failure.  
 
Participating sites are required to retain, in a confidential manner, sufficient information 
on each subject so that the subject may be contacted should the need arise.  
 
All documents, investigative reports, or information relating to the patient are strictly 
confidential. Any patient specific reports (i.e. Pathology reports, MRI reports, Operative 
reports, etc.) submitted to the CISO -MCC must have the patient’s full name and social 
security number redacted (blacked out) and the assigned CISO -MCC patient ID number, 
protocol number, and site number written in. Patient initials only may be included or 
retained for cross verification of identification.  
 
0S-14-3  
43 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   A registration verification letter will be emailed (preferred) or faxed to the registering 
site within one working day for patients registered to CISO -MCC multi -site trials. 
Treatment m ay not be initiated until the site receives this faxed or emailed verification.  
 
USC Registration:  
For patients enrolled at USC, the Research Coordinator must complete the  protocol 
eligibility  form  to ensure  that the patient  is eligible.  The PI will review  the patient  eligibility 
(with assistance from the Research Coordinator - who will assemble the required  source 
documents, and do an initial review) prior to registering the patient on  study.  
 
The Research  Coordinator  or data  manager  will then  registe r the patient  into the Cancer 
Center  database,  Café,  by accessing  the Registration  forms.  Likewise,  after  the patient  has 
completed  the study,  the Off Study  forms  in cafe  will need  to be completed,  for Off 
Treatment and Off  Study.  
 
11.5 RECORDS AND DATA  SUBMISSION  
A. Confidentiality of  Records  
The original  data  collection  forms  will be kept  in secure  file cabinets,  for USC patients  
forms will be kept in the Clinical Investigations Support Office  (CISO).  
 
B.  Patient Consent  Form  
At the time  of registration,  signed  and dated  copies  of the patient  Informed  Consent  with  
the Human  Rights  and the HIPAA  authorization  must  be given  to the patient.  Institutional 
policy regarding distribution and location of original consent documents should  be 
followed.  When  a study  is opened  at two or more  institutions,  a copy  of the signed 
consent  and HIPAA  should  be sent  to USC CISO  QA team  as soon  as possible,  and not later 
than within 5 business days of obtaining consent. For patients consented at  USC/LAC, 
institutional  policy  should  be followed:  a copy  of ICF and HIPAA  should  be uploaded 
through True to USC CRO and to CISO QA Team. The original will be kept in the  patient 
research chart maintained by the study assigned Data  Manager.  
 
C. Registration Eligibility  Worksheet  
At the time of registration, the completed Eligibility Worksheet will be submitted to  the 
QA Monitor at CISO for review of eligibility  compliance.  
 
D. Data Collection Forms and Submission  Schedule  
If a treatment trial, protocol data will be entered into eCRFs in  Café.  
Within  two weeks  of registration,  the data  manager  will complete  the initial  set of On 
Study forms and baseline  Toxicities  
Within  two weeks  of completion  of each  course  of treatment,  the data  manager  must  
complete the Course Assessment, Toxicities, and if appropriate Response  data.  
• After Off Treatment, within two weeks of each follow up, complete the Follow  Up 
forms.  
 
11.6 Data Management and  Monitoring/Auditing  
 
11.6.1  Active Monitoring Program  Details  
0S-14-3  
44 
Protocol version 03.13.2018    
a. Adherence  to Protocol/Per  Patient : It is the responsibility  of the USC Principal 
Investigator  (PI) to ensure  that patient  recruitment  and enrollment,  treatment,  follow -up 
for toxicities  and response,  and documentation  and reporting  at USC are all performed  as 
specified  in the protocol.  When  a study  is opened  at two or more  institutions,  the PI at 
each  institution  will assume  the responsibilities  for the day-to-day monitoring  of the trial, 
as described  below.  
b. Day-to-Day Monitoring – Eligibility: At USC, the Study Coordinator will assist  the 
Investigator  in reviewing  eligibility  and will assemble  the required  source  documents,  and 
do a final  review  by completing  an Eligibility  Registration  Worksheet.  When  a study  is 
opened at two or more institutions, the PI at each institution will review the  patient 
eligibility in accordance with that institution’s policy. For all i nstitutions, the  Eligibility 
Registration Worksheet with a copy of Informed Consent and supporting  source 
documents will be submitted to CISO QA via email or Fax for verification prior  to 
registering the patient on  study.  
c. Day-to-Day Monitoring  – Informed  Consent:  Prior  to registering  the patient  on study,  the 
Study  Coordinator  will review  the informed  consent,  to ensure  that the patient  has signed 
and dated the most current IRB -approved form, and that the form has been signed  and 
dated  by the person  obtaining  the consent  as well as appropriate  witnesses.  A copy  of the 
ICF will also be provided to CISO QA for review. CISO SOP 3.3 will be  followed.  
Day-to-Day Monitoring – Treatment: The PI and co -investigators are responsible  for 
ensuring  that treatment  is given  per protocol.  The Study  Coordinator  will review  the 
treatment  orders  with  the treating  investigator.  Regardless  of who  the treating  physician 
is, there  will be only  one responsible  Study  Coordinator  for each  study  at each  of the 
hospitals  affiliated  with  the USC Norris  Cancer  Center.  The treating  investigator  will 
review  the status  of each  patient  on-study,  with  the Study  Coordinator  and treating 
physicians,  on an on-going  basis.  When  a study  is opened  at two or more  institutions, 
CISO QA will periodically audit medical records for the subjects on study at other 
institutions to ensure compliance and adherence to the  protocol.  
d. Data  Management  – Patient  Charts:  When  a study  is opened  at two or more  institutions,  
the policy in place at each institution will be followed for maintaining medical  and 
research related records. Such policies will be provided to the CISO QA prior to  enrolling 
1st patient. At USC, all written source documents not associated w ith the study  research 
are maintained  in the patient  chart,  which  is stored  in the Department  of Medical  Records 
at the appropriate  hospital.  At the Norris  Hospital,  the official  medical  record  is the 
Electronic Patient File (EPF). Radiographical images are stored in the Department  of 
Radiology  and in an electronic  system  called  Synapse.  At Los Angeles  County  General 
Hospital  the official  medical  record  is called  Affinity.  These  are the permanent,  official 
documents  for each  patient  on-study.  A copy  of the signed  informed  consent,  physician’s 
notes,  orders,  test results  and pathology  notes  are maintained  in the patients’  hospital 
charts.  It is the responsibility  of the research  staff  to ensure  that the patient  chart  contains 
the required documents and work closely with treating investigators to ensure  all 
protocol -related assessments are carefully  documented.  
e. Data Management – Research Charts: When a study is opened at two or  more 
institutions,  the policy  in place  at each  institution  will be followed  for maintaining  medical 
0S-14-3  
45 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   and research  related  records.  Such  policies  will be provided  to the CISO  QA prior  to 
enrolling 1st patient. At USC, to facilitate adherence to the protocol schedule and  data 
management, research charts are created to collect copies of the relevant notes,  orders 
and results,  that are in the Patient  Chart.  In Addition,  all source  documents  related  to the 
research, such as original informed consent forms, HIPAA Forms, AE assessment 
worksheets, disease response worksheets and NTFs are maintained in the  Research 
Charts.  Protocol  calendars,  worksheets,  and checklists,  are also kept  in the research  chart. 
These are maintained in the Clinical Investigation Support Office until the study  is 
completed  and the results  are published  and no further  need  is anticipated.  These  are 
then stored off -site. It is the responsibility of the Data Manager to ensure that  the 
research chart contains all the required  documents.  
f. Data Management – Case Report Forms: It is the responsibility of the Data Manager to 
complete  the required  case  report  forms.  For in-house  trials,  case  report  forms  are 
developed for each trial; these are used to finalize the data entry screens in the  Cancer 
Center  clinical  trials  database.  It is the responsibility  of the PI to review  the Off-Study 
Summary form which summarizes pertinent toxicity, response and  adherence 
information, once the patient has completed  treatment.  
 
11.6.2  Quality Assurance Monitoring Committee (QAMC)  Oversight  
 
The Quality Assurance and Monitoring Committee (QAMC) of the NCCC has  the 
responsibility for study auditing and monitoring for protocol compliance, data  accuracy,  
performance of audits and monitoring of accrual. QAMC procedures are detailed in  the 
NCCC Data Safety and Monitoring Plan available on CISO  Website.  
 
11.6.2.1  QAMC Annual Patient  Audits  
The QAMC is responsible for conducting audits and providing the initial review of  the 
audits, for all open institutional (i.e. USC initiated), CCCP -sponsored trials, and any  trials 
identified by the CIC. These trials are audited by the QAMC once a year. Faculty and  staff 
at the Cancer Center involved in clinical research – but not directly involved in  the 
research  under  evaluation  – are asked  to serve  as auditors.  Twenty  percent  of patients 
accrued during the past 12 months – and a minimum of 2 patients – are selected  at 
random;  however,  additional  patients  may  be selected  for audit  if there  is some  indication 
that there might have been a problem or unusual circumstance (possibly related  to 
compliance, toxicity, response or some indication of an irregularity). The audit involves  a 
review  of the research  chart,  hospital  medical  record  (i.e.,  source  documentation)  and 
evaluates the following: documentation of eligibility (including failure to  obtain 
appropriate informed consent) and baseline status of the patient; documentation  of 
adherence to protocol -specified treatment and follow -up; evaluation of toxicity;  and 
evaluation of response or other outcome. In addition, for investigative agents, a  drug 
audit  is also performed  for these  patients  by the Research  Pharmacist.  In addition,  for 
Institutional, Investigator Initiated Trials, Data in the CAFÉ data base are compared to  the 
information in the medical  record.  
 
11.6.2.2  QAMC Annual Protocol  Review  
All open  trials  are reviewed  at least  once  a year  by the QAMC  (or more  often if  stipulated 
by the CIC). This annual review includes the following: evaluation of the current  accrual 
0S-14-3  
46 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   relative to the planned total accrual; examination of gender and minority  accrual; 
examination  of all reported  violations;  review  of past  audits  and correspondence  with  the 
PI; review  of results  of current  audit  (by an outside  agency  or by the NCCC  QAMC);  review 
of previous  correspondence  between  the PI and the QAMC/DSMC.  The QAMC  review 
process is detailed in USC NCCC DSM Plan available on the CISO  website.  
 
11.6.3  Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC)  Oversight  
The Data and Safety Monito ring Committee (DSMC) is an independent body  responsible 
for the safety of study subjects through the review of new protocols to ensure  an 
adequate  adverse  event  assessment/reporting  plan,  study  stopping  rules  and through  the 
real-time and periodic monitoring of severe adverse events (SAEs) or those AEs  that 
require expedited reporting. The DSMC performs quarterly and annual safety reviews  as 
well as interim  efficacy/futility  analyses  on institutional  trials.  DSMC  procedures  are 
detailed in USC NCCC DSM Plan available on the CISO  website.  
 
11.7 Adherence to the  Protocol  
Except  for an emergency  situation  in which  proper  care  for the protection,  safety,  and 
well-being of the study patient requires alternative treatment, the study shall  be 
conducted exactly as described in the approved  protocol.  
 
11.7.1  Emergency  Modifications  
Investigators  may  implement  a deviation  from,  or a change  of, the protocol  to 
eliminate an immediate hazard(s) to trial subjects without prior IRB  approval.  
 
For any such  emergency  modification  implemented,  an IRB modification  form 
must be completed within five (5) business days of making the  change.  
 
11.7.2  Non -Emergency departures from  protocol  
A protocol deviation is any variance from an IRB approved  protocol.  
If the deviation  meets  all of the following  criteria,  it is considered  a minor  protocol 
deviation  that:  
• Is generally noted or recognized only after it  occurs  
• Has no substantive effect on the risks to research  participants  
• Has no substantive  effect  on the scientific  integrity  of the research  plan  or 
the value of the data  collected  
• Did not result from willful or knowing misconduct on the part of  the 
investigator(s).  
 
If the deviation  meets  any of the following  criteria,  it is considered  a protocol 
violation : 
• Has harmed or increased the risk of harm to one or more  research 
participants.  
• Has damaged the scientific integrity of the data collected for the  study.  
• Results  from  willful  or knowing  misconduct  on the part of the investigator(s).  
• Demonstrates  serious  noncompliance  with  federal  regulations,  State  laws,  or 
University policies.  
0S-14-3  
47 
Protocol version 03.13.2018    
Protocol  Deviations:  personnel  will report  to any sponsor  or data  and safety 
monitoring committee in accordance with their  policies.  
 
Protocol  Violations:  All protocol  violations  will be entered  in the clinical  trial 
database by the Research Coordinator. In addition, Research Coordinator  and 
Investigator  should  report  all protocol  violations  within  one (1) week  of the 
knowledge of the ev ent using  iStar.  
 
 
11.7.3  Amendments to the  Protocol  
Should  amendments  to the protocol  be required,  the amendments  will be originated  and 
documented by the Principal Investigator. It should also be noted that when  an 
amendment to the protocol substantially alters the study design or the potential risk to 
the patient, a revised consent form might be  required.  
 
The written  amendment,  and if required  the amended  consent  form,  must  be sent  to the 
IRB as well as to all the sponsoring agencies (FDA, NCI, etc.) for review and for  approval 
prior to implementation. It is the responsibility of the study PI to ensure that  the 
appropriate agencies have been informed of the proposed amendments and that  these 
have been reviewed and  approved.  
 
11.8 Record  Retention  
Study documentation includes all Case Report Forms, data correction forms or  queries, 
source documents, Sponsor -Investigator correspondence, monitoring logs/letters,  and 
regulatory documents (e.g., protocol and amendments, IRB c orrespondence  and 
approval, signed patient consent  forms).  
 
Source documents include all recordings of observations or notations of clinical  activities 
and all reports  and records  necessary  for the evaluation  and reconstruction  of the clinical 
research  study.  
 
Government agency regulations and directives require that the study investigator  must  
retain all study documentation pertaining to the conduct of a clinical trial. In the case  of 
a study  with  a drug  seeking  regulatory  approval  and marketin g, these  documents  shall  be 
retained  for at least  two years  after  the last approval  of marketing  application  in an 
International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) region. In all other cases,  study 
documents should be kept on file until three years after the completion and final  study 
report of this investigational  study.  
 
11.9 Obligations of  Investigators  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for the conduct of the clinical trial at the site  in 
accordance  with  Title  21 of the Code  of Federal  Regulati ons and/or  the Declaration  of 
Helsinki.  The Principal  Investigator  is responsible  for personally  overseeing  the treatment 
of all study patients. The Principal Investigator must assure that all study site  personnel, 
including sub-investigators and other study staff members, adhere to the study  protocol 
and all FDA/GCP/NCI regulations and guidelines regarding clinical trials both during  and 
0S-14-3  
48 
Protocol version 03.13.2018   after study  completion.  
 
The Principal Investigator at each institution or site will be responsible for assuring  that 
all the required data will be collected and entered onto the Case Report  Forms.  
Periodically,  monitoring  visits  will be conducted  and the Principal  Investigator  will provide 
access  to his/her  original  records  to permit  verification  of proper  entry  of data.  At the 
completion of the study, all case report forms will be reviewed by the  Principal 
Investigator and will require his/her final signature to verify the accuracy of the  data.

1.0  INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND  
 
1.1  Common and Flat Warts of Hand and Fingers  
Non-genital warts (verruca vulgaris ) are an extremely common, benign, and usually a self -
limited skin disease. Infection of epidermal cells with the human papillomavirus (HPV) results in 
cell proliferation and a thic kened, round, raised  papule on the skin  ranging in size from a pinhead 
to 10 mm . The appearance of warts is determined by the type of virus and the location of the 
infection. There are several reasons why some individuals are affected by warts, and other 
remain trouble free.  These include: the type and strength of the viral strain, the health of the 
exposed person, and the strength of an individual’s immune response.  Any area of skin can be 
infected, but the most comm on sites are the hands and feet . Common warts  are most often 
seen on the hands  and present as skin -colored  papules with a rough 'verrucous' surface. Flat 
warts  are most often seen on the backs of the hands and on the legs. They appear as slightly 
elevated, small plaques that are skin -colored  or light brown. Plantar warts  occur on th e soles 
of the feet and look like very thick callouses.   
 
Current Care  
Current treatments for common and flat warts involve destruction of the infected cells either 
chemically or physically and treatment depends on the size, location, number, type, age of the 
patient, risk of scarring and patients’ commitment to the therapy.  The clinical management of 
these warts is challenging,  and no current treatment is singularly effective, especially against 
warts that are recalcitrant. These include non-surgical , pharmacologic and surgical  treatment 
modalities : topical peeling methods like salicylic acid ; immune modulators using contact 
immunotherap ies; intralesional candida antigen or bleomycin  and; cryotherapy; duct tape 
occlusion;  photodynamic treatment; pulsed dye laser; and general surgical procedures.  
 
1.2 Non-Surgical Approach  
Chemical Destruction :  
Salicylic Acid  
The use of salicylic acid is one of the two most commonly used treatments for warts. 
Dermatolog ists prescribe chemical destruction  treatment s where patients apply an over -the-
counter preparation, usually less than 17% salicylic acid or prescription salicylic acid containing 
up to 70% salicylic acid at home every day.  Treatment response rates of 40 -84% with an average 
of 61% have been reported as an effective therapy for non -genital cutaneous warts.1  Minor skin 
irritation was reported occasionally in some of the other trials, but generally there were no major 
harmful effects of topical salicylic acid.2  A systematic review of local treatments of cutaneous 
warts by Mitsuishi et al., found evidence that topical treatments with salicylic acid have a 
therapeutic effect, with a cure rate of 75 percent compared with 34 -48 percent in placebo 
controls.1,3  Other agents used for chemical destruction are monochloracetic acid, dichloracetic 
acid, trichloroacetic acid, silver nitrate , glycolic acid and 80% phenol in solution.  Complications  
associated with using chemicals include pain, hyperpigmentat ion, hypopigmentation, burning 
sensation and erythema.4

____________________________________________________________________________________________    
 
Cantharidin  
Cantharidin  is used as an agent in the clinic  by "painting" the wart causing  oxidative stress by 
inhibiting phosphatases 1 and 2A that damages both DNA single - and double -strand breaks 
and triggers p53 dependent apoptosis .4   Cantharidin causes a blister to form under the wart. In 
a week or so, the patient returns to the  office an d the dermatologist clips away the dead wart.  
 
Immune Modulators  
This treatment uses the patient’s own immune system to fight the warts. Forms of immune 
modulators include imiquimod, intralesional immune modulators  using  Candida antigen or anti -
cancer such as Bleomycin;  contact immunotherapy, cimetidine, zinc, and retinoids. Because 
wart proliferation is controlled by the immune system, various methods have been used to 
stimulate the immunologic response to HPV. This trea tment is used when the warts remain 
despite using other treatments  and the ability to treat many lesions simultaneously . One type of 
immunotherapy involves applying a chemical  diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP). Among these 
are topically applied inorganic molec ules capable of eliciting contact hypersensitivity, such as 
imiquimod and intralesional interferons5 to the warts. A mild allergic reaction occurs around the 
treated warts  which stimulates  the body’s  innate response to fight the virus.  
 
Physical Destructio n:  
Cryotherapy  
For common warts in adults and older children, cryotherapy  is a standard treatment and can be 
done in the physician’s  office .  Cryotherapy involves freezing a wart using a very cold substance 
(usually liquid nitrogen). The liquid nitrogen application usually takes less than a minute  and 
most warts require 1 to 4 treatments, with 1 to 3 weeks between each treatment . Pain from 
cryotherapy can last up to 3 days. Healing is generally quick (7 to 14 days) with little or no 
scarring6.  It can cause dark spots in people who have dark skin. With cryotherapy, it is  common 
for repeat treatments.  
 
Laser  
Laser treatment is an option, mainly for warts that have not responded to other therapies. Before 
laser treatment, the dermatologist may numb the wart with an anesthetic injection.  
 
1.3 Surgical  Approach  
Electrosurgery and Curettage :  
Electrosurgery (burning) is a n available treatment for common warts, filiform warts, and foot 
warts. Curettage involves scraping off (curetting) the wart with a sharp knife or small, spoon -
shaped tool. These two procedures often are used together. The dermatologist may remove the 
wart by scraping it off before or after electrosurgery.  
 
Excision :  
The wart may cut off or surgicall y excise d in combination to using other applications previously 
mentioned .

1.4  Nano -Pulse Stimulation (NPS) Therapy:  
The NPS medical device is intended to clear the skin of benign, undesired skin lesions as an 
alternative to surgery and other more destructive methods for removing benign lesions. The 
system is designed to deliver a timed series of very low energy, high amplitude  (about the 
same as the voltage of static electricity) pulses of a time length between 100 and 750 
nanoseconds (billionths of a second). The non -thermal effect on tissue takes place in a very 
shallow depth of skin directly below the sterile treatmen t tip. The device emits significantly less 
thermal energy than existing laser, electro -surgery or electro -cautery equipment.  
 
Extensive in vitro research demonstrates stimulation of a form of delayed programmed cell death 
in a treated area, which is one of  the identified mechanisms for observations of clinical and 
histologic changes to cells in multiple studies of in -vivo treated tissue in both humans and 
animals. In pre -clinical studies with over 1000 rats and mice, nano -pulsed devices have been 
demonstrat ed to reduce or eliminate malignant tumors with a clinically acceptable margin of 
safety. A pilot clinical trial of common skin cancer lesions was conducted under IRB oversight in 
2012 with a similar version of the NPS device, with the findings published i n Experimental 
Dermatology. A total of ten basal cell carcinoma lesions on the skin of three subjects were treated 
with a range of settings. Seven of the ten lesions were free of basal cells at the conclusion of the 
study, two partially resolved, and one r ecurred. No scars were visible at the healed sites of any 
of the successfully treated lesions.  In another pre -clinical study, NPS treatment  was applied to a 
human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV 16) -transformed C3.43 mouse tumor cell model in 15 
immuno -compete nt mice. The results showed that NPS  technology  is effective in eliminating 
primary tumors through the induction of immunogenic cell death while subsequently increasing 
the number of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes within the tumor microenvironment. The mic e were 
re-challenged and about half of the mice that  had cleared established tumors were protected 
against tumor re -challenge on the opposite flank , indicating that NPS  technology  has an immune 
effect that prevents successful tumor re -challenge .7 
 
Prior NPS  Therapy  Clinical Studies :  
 
The NPS device has been successfully deployed in several clinical studies of skin and 
subcutaneous structures.  As of the date of this writing, the following studies have been 
successfully conducted and concluded:  1) A histological study evaluating  use of the device  
on healthy abdominal human tissue in a dose -response study; 2) A histological study 
evaluating use of the NPS  therapy  and comparative devices on healthy abdominal human 
tissue, 3) histological study follow ing use of the therapy  on healthy facial skin tissue in the pre -
auricular area; 4) A multi -center study in the treatment of Seborrheic Keratosis lesions  
Additional detailed summaries of these studies follows.   
 
Abdominal Tissue ( Pre-Abdominoplasty ) Studi es 
Study Name:  Nano -Pulse Human Tissue Study   
 
A total of 8 subjects participated in this prospective, single site, non -randomized study.  All 
subjec ts were females representing a wide range of Fitzpatrick Skin Tone Classifications, and 
ranging in age from the low 40’s to middle 60’s.   
 
The study was comprised of two sequential segments. The first segment evaluated the 
serialized use of the test device i n demarcated locations on intact abdominal skin 
predetermined for subsequent resection during a standard abdominoplasty scheduled later. 
The primary endpoint of the first segment of the study was to establish that the trauma to the

tested skin would be min imal over a range of six progressively increasing energy levels. The 
appearance of each intact tested tissue location was comparable to that anticipated following 
any minor surgical excisional procedure. A total of 210 NPS applications were tested and 
analyzed in this study.  
 
Lidocaine was injected prior to use of the NPS skin exposure.  Subjects reported little or no 
sensation during the treatment session. Subjects further reported little or no discomfort after 
the Lidocaine effect had diminished. There we re no adverse events, no reports of bleeding, 
and no scarring noted by the Investigator at the end of the 60 -day study  
 
The second segment of the study called for the histological analysis of tissue samples prepared 
from the abdominal section that were res ected at the time of the abdominoplasty. Internal 
technicians and outside expert dermatopathologists evaluated the skin samples using 
standardized methods of microscopic analysis. This second segment did not impact the 
participating subject as it occurred after the abdominoplasty procedure. Consequently, Pulse 
Biosciences, Inc. secured IRB oversight concentrated on the first segment of the study. It 
should be noted however that the histological analysis to date confirmed that the NPS was 
successful in achie ving its intended effect across the range of tested energy settings.  
 
Abdominal Tissue (Pre -Abdominoplasty) Comparative Studies  
Study Name:  Nano -Pulse Human Tissue Study  
  
A total of 2 subjects participated in this prospective, single site, non -randomized  study.  Both 
subject s were females representing two different Fitzpatrick Skin Tone Classifications and  
ranging from the high 20’s to low 40’s in age.   
 
The primary purpose of the study was to collect tissue samples from healthy human resected 
tissue tha t had been exposed to various methods of partial tissue ablation prior to a planned 
abdominoplasty resection date. The skin samples were taken from a section of abdominal skin 
that was previously exposed to the effect of the NPS  therapy  during the same tim e period as 
two comparator medical devices considered to be the “gold standards” for tissue ablation. 
Histological analysis of the resected abdominoplasty tissue was performed on samples taken 
from sites treated with the 2 “gold standard” devices as well a s the NPS  therapy . 
 
The study is best described as comprised of two sequential segments. The first segment called 
for the serialized use of the NPS test device and the gold standard “comparatives” in specific 
locations on intact abdominal skin predetermine d to be resected during a standard 
abdominoplasty. The impact of the study test device, the comparative devices and/or the study 
process ceased at the time of the abdominoplasty.  The primary endpoint of the first segment 
of the study was to establish that  the apparent trauma to the tested skin was minimal for all 
devices. The appearance of each intact tissue location that was tested with the NPS  therapy  
or the two comparative systems was comparable to that anticipated following any minor 
surgical excision  procedure.  
 
Lidocaine was injected prior to use of the NPS skin exposure, and one of the comparators.  
Subjects reported little or no sensation during the multiple treatment sessions. Subjects further 
reported little or no discomfort after the Lidocaine effect had diminished in the days following 
each treatment. There were no adverse events, no reports of bleeding, and no scarring in the 
NPS therapy  group noted by the Investigator at the end of the 60 -day study  
 
The second segment of the study called for the histological analysis of tissue samples prepared

from the abdominal section that was resected at the time of the abdominoplasty. Internal 
technicians and outside expert dermatopathologists evaluated the skin samples using 
standardized methods of micros copic analysis.  
 
Pre-Auricular Tissue (Pre -Face Lift) Studies  
Study Name:  Nano -Pulse  Pre-Auricular Tissue  Study  
 
A total of 3 subjects participated in this prospective, single site, non -randomized study.  Two of 
the subjec ts were females and one was a male representing different Fitzpatrick Skin Tone 
Classifications and all were over the age of 50 years of age.  
 
The study was compromised of two sequential segments.  The first segment called for the 
serialized use of the test device in several locations on intact facial skin pre -determined to be 
resected during a standard face -lift, which is typically a small section in front of the ear (th e pre -
auricular area).  
 
The primary endpoint of the first segment of the study was to establish that the visually apparent 
trauma to the tested skin would be minimal and the appearance of each intact tested tissue 
location was comparable to the appearance  that is anticipated following any minor surgical 
procedure.  
 
Lidocaine was injected prior to NPS  therapy  administration to the skin surface.  After the first 
NPS exposure, subjects returned at varying time intervals prior to their scheduled face lift 
procedure for additional NPS administrations on demarcated areas on each side of their face 
using varying tip sizes and energy settings. Subjects reported little or no sensation during the 
NPS administrations.  Subjects further reported little or no discomfort  after the local anesthetic 
effect had diminished.  There were no adverse events, no reports of bleeding and no scarring 
noted by the Investigator at the end of the study.   
        
Following  the same model as described above, additional studies were perfo rmed involving pre -
auricular tissue of facial skin in 3 subjects scheduled for eventual face lift procedures.  The sole 
Investigator for this series (NP -PT-003) was Dr. James Newman, MD., Plastic Surgeon, in San 
Mateo, CA.  As noted above for the Pre-Abdom inoplasty study, local anesthetic was administered 
prior to the NPS skin exposure.  Subjects reported little or no sensation during the treatment 
session. Subjects further reported little or no discomfort after the local anesthetic effect had 
diminished. T here were no adverse events, no reports of bleeding, and no scarring noted by the 
PI at the end of the 60 -day study.  
 
        Warts Feasibility Study (NP -WF-007) 
Study Name:  Nano -Pulse Non-genital Warts Feasibility  Study  
 
Nineteen ( 19) treated adult subjects were required to have 2 -5 non -genital, off -face cutaneous 
warts in  this multi -center feasibility study.  Up to four warts were designated to be treated, while 
one wart was  designated as the sham control.  Subjects received an initia l NPS -treatment and 
returned for 3 to 5  follow -up evaluations at 7 days, 30 days, 60 days, 90 days and 120 days after 
the initial treatment.  Each  wart was evaluated for size reduction and the condition of the skin.  If 
the reduction in wart size met  study  criteria, the wart was eligible for an additional treatment and 
at the discretion of the investigator.

____________________________________________________________________________________________    
 
Six (6) of the 19 subjects were male and 13 were female.  Ages ranged from 23 to 71, with an  
average  age of 48.  Subjects had Fitzpatrick skin types ra nging from I to III.   A total of 58 warts  
have been  included in the study at the time of this report.  34 warts were identified for treatment  
and 19 warts as  controls. 70% of the study warts had been previously treated with another  
modality and were not  successful at eliminating the wart.  69% of treated warts were located on  
the hand/fingers and the  remaining 31% of treated were located on the feet.  Twenty -five ( 25%) 
of treated  warts received a single treatment, and  75% received two treatments.  Of the treated  
warts, 50%  showed 100% reduction in size, 21% showed a  50-90% reduction in size, and 26%  
showed  less than a 50% reduction in size at the last reported visit. Twenty -nine ( 29%) of the  
treated warts  showed  100% reduction after a single treatment.  There were two instances  
where the control  wart showed 100% reduction in size, suggesting that there may be an  
immune  response.  Preliminary data analysis indicates that complete coverage of the wart within  
the treatment  zone is r equired.  There is also a trend toward the use  of higher settings within  
the allotted range  for better  outcomes.  There were no instances of hypopigmentation noted,  
and 3  cases of mild  hyperpigmentation  at 60 days.  
 
The high rate of wart size reduction sug gests the utility of the unique NPS cellular mechanism  
for the  treatment of non -genital, cutaneous warts.  Based on these initial results, a larger pivotal  
study is  warranted and will be conducted in the future to further evaluate the use of NPS  
technology  for the  treatment of warts.

2.0  STUDY DEVICE DESCRIPTION  
2.1  Pulse Bioscience CellFX™ System  
The Pulse Bioscience CellFX™ System uses a proprietary platform technology called Nano -
Pulse Stimulation™ (NPS™). NPS  technology  utilizes nanosecond (billionth of a second) 
pulses of energy that penetrate into the cytoplasm and organelles to induce regulated cell death 
in a target lesion. The pulses are applied directly to targeted tissue using small microneedles.  
The Ce llFX System is intended for the reduction and/or removal of benign and non -benign 
lesions.  
The CellFX System consists of :  
 
• CellFX Console  - The Console consists of all the electronics and controls required to 
generate a nanosecond pulsed electric field. A touchscreen provides the user interface to 
the system. The power cord electrically connects the Console to the AC mains outlet .  
 
• CellFX Handpiece (re -usable)  - When attached to a Single Patient Use Retractable Tip 
(Treatment Tip), the Handpiece i s held by the user to deliver a timed series of energy 
pulses (referred to as a “Cycle”) from the CellFX Console. The Handpiece  has a custom 
receptacle for attachment to the Treatment Tip,  a custom connector that plugs into the 
Console with a 10 -foot cabl e, a hook for hanging the Handpiece on the Console , a Finger 
Switch for cycle activation, a LED status indicator, and a pair of side buttons on each side 
of the Handpiece .  
 
• CellFX Single Patient Use Retractable Tips – A sterile Single Patient Use Tip atta ches  
to the Handpiece. The Tip holds two to three arrays of needles that define the intended 
treatment area (i.e. lesion zone) where the pulsed electric field is applied. There are 
fiducial markers on each side of the retractable tip portion, one marker on each  side 
perpendicular to the row of needles and second on each side parallel with the rows of 
needles that can be used to align to the treatment area.

3.0  PROTOCOL  
3.1 Study Purpose and Objectives  
The purpose  of this study is to evaluate the  safety and effectiveness of the CellFX  System in 
patients with cutaneous non-genital warts  on all areas of the body , excluding the face.   
        
       The study objectives are listed below : 
 
• Evaluate the condition of skin in the treatment areas (erythema, etc.) over the course of 
7 to 120 days post -initial NPS treatment  
 
• Evaluate the overall response to NPS treatment by:  
1. Wart clearance (generally accepted as complete clearance  of warts from the 
treated area)  
2. Wart reduction (reduction in the total number of warts)  
• Evaluate and assess adverse effects of treatment  
 
3.2 Study Design  Overview  
The study is design ed as a prospective, non-randomized, multicenter pivotal study to evaluate 
the safety and effectiveness of the  CellFX System in patients with non-genital warts, excluding 
the face .  Macrophotography  of all treated warts  will be captured  along with Investigator 
assessments using a wart measurement scale and tissue response. One of the warts for each 
subject will be untreated and will serve as the subject’s internal control . Please note the  
Investigator has the option at baseline and at each follow -up visit for cu rettage of the targeted 
site prior to  NPS treatment .  Additionally, at the 30 -day, 60-day and 90 -day visits the 
Investigator has the option to retreat any previously treated lesion .  
 
3.3 Site Selection and Number of Subjects  
Up to 6 clinical sites will participate in this study. Sites will be selected based on the appropriate 
patient population, physician experience in  the treatment of warts, and adequate resources to 
support this pivotal study.   
 
Approximately 60 subjects at 6 sites will be enrolled. A site may enroll  up to 18 subjects in this 
study.  
 
3.4. Clinical Study Duration  
It is anticipated that the enrollment of subjects in this pivotal  study  will take approximately 4 -
months. All subjects included in this  clinical investigation will return for follow -up visits at 7, 30, 
60, 90 and 120 -days post -initial  NPS treatment. All lesions will have the possibility of being 
retreated up to 3 times, with a maximum of 4 total NPS treatments over the course of the study. 
Total study duration is approximately 8 months.  
 
3.5 Enrollment Definition  
For the purposes of enrollment, only those patients who meet all eligibility criteria, sign an IRB

9.0 BENEFITS AND RISK  ANALYSIS  
9.1  CellFX System  Risk  
The Investigators  for the study  are experienced  physicians.  Use of the CellFX System  poses  very 
minimal  risk, including  scabbing, minor skin pigment changes or scarring  and minor  discomfort  
which  can be further  minimized  by covering  the spot with a small  bandage.  Typical  wound  
complications  such  as infection,  bleeding  and discomfort  which  requires  prescription  medication  
for relief  are not anticipated.  If they should  occur,  they would  be considered  an unanticipated  
adverse  event  and managed  as such.  If  the subject  has any questions  or concerns  about  their 
medical  condition  or if an unforeseen  event  should  occur  the subject  will be advised  to contact 
the PIs or their designate.  
 
A volunteer for the proposed study is someone who has elected removal of their wart  lesions.  Such 
scars are typically removed via surgical excision, intra -scar steroidal injections or systemic steroids. 
Participation in the study offers another technique to accomplish the same thing as the typical tools.  
Experience with the NPS  technol ogy to date offers some confidence that the scars may be les sened 
although no assurances will be offered. The information learned may contribute to the ultimate use 
of a safe r and more effective device available to treat benign and  non-benign lesions in fu ture 
patients.  
 
9.2  NSR Classification of Study  
No significant risk is posed by either the use of the NPS  technology  or the study process. While 
safety can never be taken lightly, this study is not meant to measure monitor or analyze any 
significant disease or disorder for which medical treatment is mandatory.     
 
See additional information regarding Non -Significant Ri sk statement below.  
 
Non-Significant  Risk  Statement  
The proposed  study  fits the criteria  for a non-significant designation  for the following reasons:  
• Subjects  will be recruited  to participate in the study on a voluntary  basis.  Potential 
subjec ts will be recruited directly from the Investigator’s population of patients who 
are candidates for removal of their wart lesions.  
• Participation  in the study  takes  no more than approximately  1 hour for each of 
the maximum of 6 study visits.  
• Localized  anesthesia /numbing  will be used  to control  discomfort  at the time of any 
CellFX System  applications . 
• After  the CellFX  device  is deployed  and the anesthesia /numbing  is dissipated, 
there  may be mild, localized  discomfort  at the  site of the treatment.  A small  scab or 
crust  may develop . This occurrence  is transient  and should  resolve  without 
intervention.  
• Prior studies support the proposal that the use  of the CellFX System  represents 
minimal risk.  
• There  is no loss of privacy  as no study  records  will be viewed  or retrieved  by anyone  
other  than the study  team  members.  
• Protected  information  will not be captured.  
• Subject identity  is protected  by a coding  system  to de-identify  them.

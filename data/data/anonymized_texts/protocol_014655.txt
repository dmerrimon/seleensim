Study Title:  A Phase 2 a, Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics , and Quantitative EEG Study of 
CX-8998 in Adolescents and Adults with Idiopathic Generalized Epilepsy with Absence 
Seizures  
Name of Finished Product: CX-8998  
Protocol Number:  CX-8998 -CLN2 -002  Study Phase:  2a 
Clinical Sites:  
Multiple sites in the United States  
Primary Objective  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of CX -8998 in adolescents and adults with idiopathic 
generalized epilepsy (IGE) with absence seizures . 
Secondary Objectives  
• To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CX -8998 and its metabolites (including, but not 
limited to, M01 and M02) in the plasma of subjects with IGE with absence seizures . 
Exploratory Objectives  
• To assess the exposure -response and exposure- safety relationships for plasma CX -8998 and its 
metabolites ( including, but not limited to, M01 and M02); results to be reported separately 
from the c linical study r eport.  
• To evaluate the pharmacodynamic  effects of CX -8998 as measured by electroencephalogram 
(EEG ) 
Study Design:  
This is a Phase 2a, open- label study consisting of a screening period of up to 4 we eks and a 4-dose -
titration treatment period  to a dose of up to 10  mg twice daily (BID) of CX -8998, followed by  a 
1-week safety follow -up period after  the last dose of study medication.  
Study Population:   
Inclusion Criteria  
1. Signed informed consent form (ICF) indicating that the subject has been informed of the 
procedures to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternatives, potential benefits, side effects, risks, and discomforts. 
2. Men or nonpregnant, non -breas tfeeding women 16 to 55 years  of age who are able to read and 
understand wr itten and spoken local language .  
3. Clinical diagnosis of IGE  (including, but not limited to, childhood absence epilepsy, juvenile 
absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, or Jeavon s syndrome) with absence seizures 
consistent with the International League against Epilepsy Revised Classification of Seizures (2017) . 
4. Absence seizures, by history on average once  per hour,  persist ing despite standard of care 
(SOC) treatment, defined as treatment with at least 2  antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) appropriate for 
the patient’s epilepsy syndrome. SOC failure, per investigator discretion, will be defined as 
insufficient clinical response or intolerable si de effects, which preclude s the use of the 
appropriate  AED. 
5. Observation of at least  1 provoked absence seizure during at least 1 of the hyperventilation 
(HV) periods and at least 3 absence seizures during the 6.5-hour  video -EEG. Absence seizures

Protocol Number: CX -8998 -CLN2 -002 Version 6.0 Issue Date: 30 May 2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 6 of 91 are defined on EEG as typical generalized 3-Hz spike and wave lasting ≥3 seconds during 
wakefulness. Hyperventilation should be carried out in the following manner: 5  minutes of HV 
(HV period  1), followed by 5  minutes of relaxation, followed by a second 5  minutes of HV (HV 
period  2). Subjects who have an induced seizure during HV period  1 do not need to undergo HV 
period  2. At least 75% of the background should be normal . 
6. On stable doses of one or more antiepileptic medication(s) for at least 30  days. If a subject is not 
on medication, adequate documentation justif ying lack of the rapy  may be acceptable  for the 
subject after sponsor review. Ketogenic, modified Atkins diet (MAD), or low glycemic diet with 
stable carbohydrate ratio for at least 30 days before screening is an  acceptable  antiepileptic 
therapy . Vagal nerve stimulation at stable settings  (for at least 30 days before screening) , 
without use of the magnet, is also acceptable . 
7. Body weight ≥45 kg at screening. 
8. Subjects with reproductive capability , including all males and women of childbearing potential 
(WOCBP), must agree to practice continuous abstinence or adequate contraception methods 
(appropriate double barrier method or oral, patch, implant, or injectable contraception) from as 
soon as feasible during screening period until at least 30 days after the last dose (i.e., intermittent abstinence b ased on “rhythm ,” temperature monitoring, or other means of timing 
is not acceptable). WOCBP include any woman who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, and/or bilatera l oophorectomy) or is not postmenopausal. Postmenopausal is defined as  amenorrhea 
for ≥12 consecutive months without another cause, and a documented serum follicle -
stimulating hormone (FSH) level ≥35 mIU/mL .  
9. Male subjects with a partner of childbearing potential must be surgically sterilized or be willing to use condoms with spermicide from as soon as feasible during screening period until at le ast 
30 days after the last dose .

disorder ). 
4. Presence of severe intellectual disability,  severe  autism  spectrum disorder , or severe 
developmental disorder  such that the subject cannot sign the ICF or cannot cooperate with the 
study procedures. 
5. Presence of p ositive urine drug screen for drugs of abuse, except if this is explained by use of a n 
allowed prescription medicine .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 8 of 91 Reference Product, Dose, and Mode of Administration:   
None  
Duration of Treatment:   
26 days  
Administration:   
CX-8998 will be administered as:  
1. Days 1 – 2: 2 mg (1 capsule) BID (4 mg/d);  
2. Days 3 – 8: 4 mg (2 capsules) BID (8 mg/d);  
3. Days 9 – 14: 6 mg (3 capsules) BID (12 mg/d);  
4. Days 15 – 20:  8 mg (4 capsules) BID (16 mg/d) ;  
5. Days 21 – 26 :  10 mg (5  capsules) BID (20 mg/d) . 
  
Study drug should be administered with food. Subjects should be instructed to take their daily dose 
at approximately  the same times each day. Consecutive doses should be taken no closer than 10 
hours and no later than 14 hours (every 12 hours ± 2 hours). Subjects will remain under observation for at least 4 hours post -dosing prior to discharge at Visit 1.  
At the Day 26 clinic visit at which 2 postdose PK blood draws, >2 hours apart,  are scheduled to be 
obtained , subjects will take the morning dose at the appropriate time. Both the time of the morning 
dose and the time of the PK blood draw will be recorded.  
A m issed dose (>14 hours since the prior dose) should be skipped and should not be “doubled -up” 
or “made up”; the next dose should be taken 24 hours from the last administered dose. If the subject experiences emesis following the dose, that dose should not be  retaken; instead the next dose 
should be taken 24 hours from the last administered dose without emesis. If emesis occurs, the subject should contact the investigator or qualified designee at the study site for guidance on 
management of the emesis.  
Subject s who experienc e specified adverse events (AEs) will have their dose adjusted. Subjects 
suspected of experiencing neuropsychiatric AEs may be asked to return to the clinic for an 
unscheduled visit prior to further dose escalation.  
Duration of Subject Study Participation:  
Subjects will participate for a total of up to 9 weeks, including screening, the 4-week treatment 
period and follow -up.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 21 of 91 1 BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE  
1.1 Introduction  
1.1.1 Absence Epilepsy  
Generalized epilepsies  constitute nearly one -third of all epilepsies.  Idiopathic generalized epilepsies 
(IGEs ) manifest with absences  seizures , myoclonic jerks, and generalized tonic –clonic seizures, 
alone or in varying combinations and severity  (Panayiotopoulos, 2005 ). Absence seizures  are the 
h
allmark seizure type in absence epilepsy (a form of generalized epilepsy)  but can also be a 
predominant seizure type in other generalized epileptic syndromes. Absence seizures  are 
characterized by a transient impairment in consciousness generally not followed by a notable post -
ictal state . Absence seizures are characterized clinically and electroencephalographically as typical 
and atypical types . Typical absence seizures show abrupt onset and resolution and are often 
accompanied by other features , including staring, behavioral arrest, eyelid fluttering or hand/face 
automatisms (Penry, 1
969). Electroencephalogram ( EEG ) findi ngs of a typical absence seizure 
show generalized spike- and-wave complexes in the 3 -4.5 Hz range lasting at least 3 seconds 
(Holmes,
 1987 , Frank, 1999, Panayiotopoulos, 2008 ). Age of onset for typical absence seizures is 
bimod
al with a peak at 6 -7 years of age and a second peak  at 12 years of age ( Loiseau,
 1995). 
Atypical absence seizures last longer than typical absences, have less abrupt onset and offset, more 
pronounce
d changes in tone and variable impairments of consciousness ( Proposal
 for revised 
clinical and electroencephalographic classification of epileptic seizures , 1981 ) . EEG findings for 
atypi
cal absence seizure s are more heterogeneous, often showing irregular spike- and-wave 
complexes that are slower (<2.5  Hz), asymmetrical , and often associated with diffuse fast activity 
(Holmes,
 1987).  
Absence epilepsy syndromes include childhood absence epilepsy (CAE), juvenile absence epilepsy (JAE), epilepsy with myoclonic absences, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, and Jeavons syndrome. CAE 
is the most common pediatric epilepsy syndrome, affecting females more than males and characterized by very fre quent (several to many per day) absences in school -age children , with age 
of onset between 4 and 10 years ( Proposal for revised clinical and electroencephalographic 
classification of epileptic seizures, 1981 ; Camfield, 1996 ; Berg, 2000; Jallon, 2001; Fisher,  2005). 
CAE is self -limiti
 ng in many cases with reported remission rates ranging from 21% to 74% ( Tenney, 
2013
) by age 12 or sooner ( Posner , 201 3) but with roughly 40% developing generalized tonic 
clonic 
seizures (GTCS), often 5 -10 years after the initial onset of absence seizures ( Loiseau
 1983). 
JAE has a later age of onset with most cases beginning between 10 and 17 years ( Loiseau, 1995). 
JAE is distinguished from CAE by more common incidence of GTCS which eventually occur in nearly 80% of  JAE patients ( Wolf, 1984) and by a higher likelihood of persistence into adulthood ( Tenney,  
2013). In general, later onset of absence seizures is associated with more severe, persistent and 
drug r 
esistant epilepsy.   
1.1.2 Treatments f
or Absence Seizures  
Current treatments for absence seizures  include ethosuximide, valproate, and the sodium channel 
blocker lamotrigine. Prior to 2010, a total of  6, short duration, small randomized controlled trials 
had examined ethosuximide, valproic acid, and lamotrigine initial monotherapy in children with

Protocol Number: CX -8998 -CLN2 -002 Version 6.0 Issue Date: 30 May 2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 22 of 91 absence epilepsy. Due to multiple methodological limitations, none of these trials met the criteria 
for eith er a Class I or II study, providing insufficient evidence to inform clinical practice  (Glauser et 
al., 2006
). In 2010, a National Institu tes of Health (NIH )-funded randomized controlled trial of 446 
children with CAE , ethosuxim ide and valproate resulted in the best efficacy with 53% and 58% of 
patients achieving freedom- from -treatment -failure respectively, while lamotrigine showed lower 
efficacy with seizure free rates of 29% ( G
lauser et al., 2010). Other treatments less frequently used 
to treat absence epilepsy include clonazepam, clobazam, zonisamide , and topiramate.  
N
early a quarter of patients receiving front -line drugs experience intolerable side effects (Glauser 
et al., 2010 ). Ethosuximide is commonly associated with gastrointestinal ( GI) disturbances, 
anorexia, weight loss, drowsiness, photophobia, headache , and behavioral and psychiatric 
disturbances and is rarely associated with aplastic anemia, skin reactions, and renal and hepatic 
impairment ( Posner , 2013 ). Common adverse events (AEs) associated with valproate include GI 
disturbances, weight gain , and tremor and , rarely , behavioral and cognitive abnormalities and 
potentially fatal liver necrosis and pancreatitis; its use is limited clinically by weight gain and in 
women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) because of fetotoxicity (P
osner , 2013) . Lamotrigine is 
associated with dizziness, somnolence, nausea, vomiting and headache and can cause serious skin reactions and aseptic meningitis (Posner, 2013 ). 
No randomized , controlled, double -blind trials have been conducted in JAE or in other generalized 
epilepsy syndromes with absence seizures . Separate expert opinion surveys in the US and Europe 
found valproic acid and lamotrigine  to be the top initial treatment choice for JAE (as they treat both 
absences and tonic -clonic seizures) ( Wheless et al., 2005 ; Wheless et al., 2007 ). 
Second -line (or 
later) treatments with evidence of modest effi cacy for JAE include  ethosuximide , amantadine, and 
the ketogenic diet ( F
attore et al., 20 11; Groomes et al., 2011 ).  
While a proportion of patients diagnosed with absence seizures  will respond to first -line 
antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and have a generally good prognosis, a significant proportion will fail to 
achieve adequ ate seizure control with existing therapeutics or will experience intolerable side 
effects that limit therapy (Connock, 2006 ). For these patients the goal is to achieve seizure control 
while limiting side effects and negative impacts, especially on cognitive outcomes . Drug- resistant 
epilepsy has been defined as the “failure of adequate trials of 2 tolerated, appropriately chosen and used antiepileptic drug schedules (whether as monotherapy or in combination) to achieve sustained  seizure freedom.” This operational definition, established by an International League 
Against Epilepsy commission,  (
Kwan et al., 2010) relies upon the observation that adults and 
children rarely achieve sustained seizure freedom once 2 agents have failed to control seizures  
(
Mohanraj & Brodie, 2006;  Kwan et al, 2010) . 
Despite the development of nearly a dozen new drugs for epilepsy in the 1990s and 2000s  and, 
although  many newer drugs have superior pharmacokinetic (PK) and side effect profiles than older  
AEDs, they possess the same degree of effectiveness  (Krauss & Sperling, 2011 ). These AEDs rarely 
stop seizures once older agents have failed. Innovative pharmaceutical approaches with new antiepileptic drugs, especially those with greater potency, selectivity and a defined mechanis m of 
action are needed to offer treatment options to these patients and yield better response rates.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 23 of 91 1.2 Rationale for Evaluating CX -8998 in Idiopathic Generalized 
Epilepsy with Absence Seizures  
1.2.1 CaV3 and its Role in Neurological Disorders with Excessive or Abnormal 
Rhythmicity 
Calcium is a ubiquitous intracellular second messenger critical for cellular functions. The elevation 
of free intracellular Ca2+ levels triggers various responses , including the activation of Ca2 + 
dependent enzymes, the secretion of neur otransmitters, and muscle contraction. Multiple calcium 
ion channels regulate calcium influx in response to membrane depolarization, voltage changes, or substrate, which include the pore -forming alpha
1 subunit Cav3 cha nnel ( Catterall, 2005 ; Adams &  
Sn
utch, 2007 ).  
The
 T-type calcium channel, Ca v3, its 3 isoforms (3.1, 3.2 and 3.3), and their genes CACNA1G, 
CACNA1H , and  CACNA1I were discovered and  cloned in the early 1990s, where their function as 
low-threshold, voltage- gated calcium channel was elucidated ( Cribbs et al., 1998). T-type (“T” is for 
t
ransient) calcium channels are low voltage -activated channels predominantly found in neurons. As 
stated previously, a unique and discriminating property of T -type channels (Ca V3) is their ability to 
activate upon small depolarization of the membrane, contributing to the setting of the resting membrane potential and allowing a surge of calcium entry into excitable cells at the beginning of an action potential. In pathologic states, Ca
V3 is either upregulated or found to have increased activity, 
becoming a selective target for specific neurologic diseases ( Bourinet et al.,  2005; Park et al., 2010 ; 
Tai et al., 2011). 
Isoforms of Cav3 are expressed throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral 
nervous system, including the thalamocortical pathway1 (Ertel et al., 2000 ). Deep cerebellar nuclei, 
sub
stantia nigra, globus pallidus externa, globus pallidus interna, subthalamic nucleus, have been 
noted to have oscillations in healthy hosts and excessive rhythmicity in animals and humans with 
pathologic conditions of the nervous system. It has been discovered that Ca v3 is a mediator of 
subthreshold oscillations and excessive rhythmicity in pathophysiologic states found in tremor, 
neuropathic pain, epilepsy and Parkinson’s  disease  (Lliná s et al., 1999; Llin ás, 2003; Handforth et 
al., 2005; Park et al., 2013 ).  
1.2.2 Role of Cav3 in Epilepsy 
It is well established that T -type c alcium channels are a pharmacological target for absence 
seizures . Neuronal burst -firing, a key pathophysiologic contributor to epileptic seizures, is 
generated by low threshold calcium potentials initiated by Cav3 channel opening ( Cain & Snutch, 
2013). In particular, rodent models of absence epilepsy show enhanced Ca v3 currents in 
thalamocortical relay neurons and enhanced burst -firing during seizures that correlate with spikes 
in spike -and-wave discharges. A number of single nucleotide mutations in Ca v3.2 have been 
reported in patients with childhood absence epilepsy ( Chen et al., 2004), some of which result in 
ga
ins of function in channel gating and in elevated channel expression ( Khosr
avani et al., 2004; 
                                                             
1 Cav3.1 is the most common isoform in the thalamocortical pathway

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 24 of 91 Vikto et al., 2005; Peloquin et al., 2006 ; Vikto et al., 2007). In addition, overexpression of Ca v3.1 
results in an absence- like seizure phenotype in mice ( Ernst, et al., 2009) and mice lacking Ca v3.1 
show reduced thalamocortical burst firing and resistance to pharmacologically induced absence 
seizures ( Kim et al., 2001). A number of antiepileptic drugs have been reported to have 
nons
elective Cav3 blocking activity, including ethosuximide, valproate, zonisamide, and phenytoin 
(Powell et al., 2014 ). These drugs are thought to act in part through suppression of Ca v3 activity 
although all have substantial effects on other types of channels , including sodium, potassium, and 
potassium- activated calcium currents. Current treatments for absence seizures  include 
ethosuximide, valproat e, and the sodium channel blocker lamotrigine . In CAE, ethosuximide and 
valproate result in the best efficacy , with approximately 50% of patients achieving freedom from 
seizures, however, nearly a quarter of patients receiving these drugs experience intolerable side effects ( Glauser et al., 2010). Thus, selective targeting Ca
v3 channels may offe r a more efficacious 
and better -tolerated treatment option.

Protocol Number: CX -8998 -CLN2 -002 Version 6.0 Issue Date : 30 May 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PR OPRIETARY  Page 39 of 91 4.3 Administration  
CX-8998 will be administered as : 
1. Days 1 – 2: 2 mg (1 capsule) BID (4  mg/d) ;  
2. Days 3 – 8: 4 mg (2 capsules) BID (8 mg/d);  
3. Days 9 - 14 :  6 mg (3 capsules) BID 12 mg/d);  
4. Days 15 – 20: 8 mg (4 capsules) BID (16 mg/d) ;  
5. Days 21 - 26 :  10 mg (5 capsules) BID (20  mg/d).  
Study drug should be administered with food. Subjects should be instructed to take their daily dose 
at approximately the same times each day. Consecutive doses should be taken no closer th an 10 
hours and no later than 14 hours (every 12 hours ± 2 hours ). Subjects will remain under 
observation for at least 4 hours post -dosing prior to discharge  at Visit  1.  
At the Day  26 clinic visit at which 2 postdose PK blood draws, >2 hours apart, are scheduled  to 
be obtained, subjects will take the morning dose at the appropriate time. Both the time of the 
morning dose and the time of the PK blood draw will be recorded. 
A missed dose (>14 hours since the prior dose) should be skipped and should not be “doubled -up” 
or “made up”; the next dose should be taken 24 hours  from the last administered dose. If the subject 
experiences emesis following the dose, that dose should not be re -taken; instead the next dose 
should be taken 24 hours from the last administered dose without emesis. If emesis occurs, the 
subject should co ntact the investigator or qualified designee at the study site for guidance on 
management of the emesis.  
Treatment compliance will be assessed  as described in Section 4.5.1.  
Subjects experienc ing specified  AEs will have their dose adjusted . See Section 4.6 for details on dose 
adjustments.  
4.4 Subject Stopping Rules  
Study drug dosing for a n individual subject will be permanently discontinued for intolerable AEs 
that do not resolve to mild  in severity (as defined in Section  10.2.2.2) or baseline  within 48 hours  of 
suspension of dosing and for study drug -related SAEs .  
Administration of the study treatment will be discontinued if any of the following liver c hemistry 
stopping criteria is met:   
• Serum alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) or aspartate aminotransferase ( AST ) ≥3 × 
ULN (upper limit of normal) and total bilirubin level ≥2 × ULN  
NOTE: Serum bilirubin fractionation should be performed if testing is available. If 
fractionation is unavailable, urinary bilirubin is to be measured via dipstick (a measurement of direct bilirubin, which would suggest liver injury). 
• Serum ALT or AST ≥5 × ULN  
• Serum ALT or AST ≥3 × ULN if associated with the appearance or wor sening of rash 
or hepatitis symptoms (fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain or 
tenderness, fever, rash, or eosinophilia)

Protocol Number: CX -8998 -CLN2 -002 Version 6.0 Issue Date : 30 May 2019  
CONFIDENTIAL AND PR OPRIETARY  Page 40 of 91 Any laboratory value that exceeds these limits should be repeated as soon as possible and, if 
confirmed, study treatment should be immediately discontinued. If a repeat laboratory assessment cannot be obtained within 3  days after receipt of the result showing the abnormal value, study drug 
should be discontinued.  
A subject who meets the following ECG criteria will have study treatment discontinued:  
• QTcF >500 msec or uncorrected QT >600 msec  
• an increase in QTcF by ≥60 msec from Day 1 predose (baseline) with an absolute 
value of QTcF ≥450 msec (males) or ≥470 msec (females)  
Treatment must be discontinued immediately in any subject who experiences a GTCS during the 
study if the subject had not had a GTCS prior to study entry. Subjects with worsening of seizures 
during the study should have treatment discontinued  per investigator discretion. Unless consent for 
furthe r follow- up is withdrawn, subjects who discontinue study drug for safety reasons should be 
followed in accordance with the schedule detailed in Table 3. 
Other reasons for treatment termination are provided in Section  6.4.  
4.5 Study Drug Accountability  and Compliance  
4.5.1 Study Drug Accountability  
The investigator or an appointed designee is responsible for ensuring that deliveries of study drug are correctly dispensed and recorded, that the product is handled and stored safely and properly, and that it is only given to subjects in accordance with t his protocol.  
Sites will keep a current log of drug accountability recording:  
• What drug supply was received from the sponsor  
• What drug supply was dispensed to each subject  
• What drug supply is current in inventory  
• What drug supply was destroyed or returne d to the sponsor for destruction 
Note: Drug accountability is the responsibility of the investigator; a written account will be required for all discrepancies.  
If the study drug supplies appear to be damaged/missing upon arrival at the investigational site , the 
sponsor should be contacted immediately.  
The sponsor’s designated monitor must verify all accountability records during periodic monitoring visits. Unused and used study drug must be stored on site until such accountability has taken place and author ization is received from the sponsor or sponsor’s designee that the study drug may be 
returned or destroyed.  
4.5.2 Subject Compliance with Study Drug 
Compliance will be assessed by capsule counts. Subjects will be instructed to bring all used empty 
bottles and unused study drug with them to the clinic visit on Day 26.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PR OPRIETARY  Page 41 of 91 4.6 Dose Adjustments / Toxicity Management  
Adverse events will  be graded for intensity by the investigator  (see Section 10.2.2.2).  
Dosing will be discontinued for all study drug -related SAEs . 
A member of the study staff will contact any subject  who is suspected of exp eriencing 
neuropsychiatric AEs to determine the need for an unscheduled visit before further dose escalation 
may proceed.  Subjects who are experiencing any AEs may also be asked to return for an 
unscheduled visit.  Subjects who are suspected of experiencing  a neuropsychiatric event should be 
seen in person.  
In all subjects with intolerable AEs (as defined in Section 10.2.1 ) that are considered related to 
study drug, treatment should be susp ended for up to 48 hours or until  the AE resolves to a tolerable 
level of severity, whichever is earlier. In subjects who are unable to tolerate 6 mg BID, 8 mg BID or 
10 mg BID, d osing may then be resumed at a previously tolerated lower dose. Only a single dose-
step reduction ( i.e., 10 mg BID to 8 mg BID, 8 mg BID  to 6 mg BID, or 6 mg BID to 4 mg BID ) is 
permitted. Reescalation of the dose is NOT permitted. D osing should be discontinued if there is 
recurrence of  intolerable AEs after the dose reduction.  Subjects who experience intolerable AEs 
while receiving  the 2 mg BID or 4 mg BID dose  will be discontinued from treatment. Table  2 details 
dose reductions by dose level.  
Table 2 Study Drug Dose Reduction for Intolerable AEs  
Dose and Schedule of Study Drug  Dose Reduction  
2 mg BID  Remove from treatment 1 
4 mg BID  Remove from treatment 
6 mg BID  4 mg BID  
8 mg BID 6 mg BID 
10 mg BID 8 mg BID 
1 – Subjects who are removed from treatment for AE(s) should be followed for resolution of the AE(s) and 
should complete all assessments scheduled for the End -of Study ( EOS )/Follow -up ( FU) Visit , as well as all 
assessments that they are capable of completing on the scheduled visit day if the decision to remove from 
treatment is made on a scheduled visit day. Likewise, if the investigator plans to temporarily interrupt dosing 
because of an AE and t he decision is made on a scheduled visit day, then the subject should complete all 
scheduled assessments that they are capable of completing on the visit day on which they appear.  
All subjects who discontinue treatment due to AEs will be followed for AE outcome. All AEs should 
be followed for resolution or for 30 days from the last dose of study drug, whichever is shorter.  
The Study Safety Representative  should be notified of all dose reductions as soon as is feasible.  
All subjects who discontinue treatment due to AEs will be followed for AE outcome. All AEs should 
be followed for resolution or for 30 days from the last dose of study drug, whichever is s horter.  
4.7 Overdose Management 
To date, no overdoses of CX -8998 in humans have occurred.  Therefore , specific information 
regarding treatment of overdose is not currently available. In case of an acute overdose, it is recommended that the stomach be emptied and oral gavage with activated charcoal be used to help

study and necessitates the discontinuation of treatment . 
4) Pregnancy . 
5) Subjects who answer “yes” to Suicidal Ideation item 4 or 5 on the C -SSRS during the study must 
be withdrawn from the study treatment. Investigators should also withdraw subjects from treatment if, in the judgment of the investigator, the subject develops other indicators of 
significant risk of suicide.  In the event that suicidal ideation is observed in any study subject, the 
investigator will manage the situation as he/she deems medically and psychiatrically 
appropriate.  
6.4.1 Follow -up Procedures for Subjects Who Withdraw /Discontinue Prematurely  
If a subject  withdraws from the study , attempts should be made to contact the subject  to determine 
the reason(s) for discontinuation.  If a subject does not return to the clinic for follow -up visits, 
attempts should be made to contact the subject via phone, email, or mail. At least 3 documented attempts (one of which should be a certified letter) should be made to contact the subject before 
declaring a subject lost to follow- up. The Study Safety Representative  must be informed as soon as 
possible if a subject discontinues or withdraws early.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PR OPRIETARY  Page 46 of 91 The date and the reason for study drug discontinuation or subject withdrawal from the study must 
be recorded on the c ase report form (CRF)  In case of early discontinuation or withdrawal of a 
subject, every effort must be made to report all study- mandated observations up to the time of 
discontinuation/withdrawal as completely as possible.  
Subjects who are removed from treatment for AE(s) should be followed for resolution of the AE(s) 
(see Section 10.2.3) and should complete all assessments scheduled for the End -of-Study (EOS ) 
Visit, as well as all assessments that they are capable of comp leting on the scheduled v isit day if the 
decision to remove from treatment is made on a scheduled visit day. Likewise, if the i nvestigator 
plans to temporarily interrupt dosing because of an AE and the decision is made on a scheduled 
visit day, the subject  should complete all scheduled assessments that they are capable of completing 
on the visit day on which they appear.  
If the reason for discontinuation/withdrawal is medical and the subject has not withdrawn consent, the subject should remain under the sup ervision of the investigator until the medical issue is 
resolv ed or otherwise declared stable .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 50 of 91 7.2 Summary of Treatment Visits  
7.2.1 Screening 
The Screening Visit must be performed within 28 days  of Visit 1/ baseline . Subject informed 
consent must be obtained prior to initiation of  any study -specified procedures . A central 
reviewer and the sponsor will review eligibility criteria for all subjects. 
A standard multi -lead video- EEG with HV and photic stimulation ( PS) will be obtained  over 
30 minutes and will be followed by an additional 6-hour awake video -EEG  (total, 6.5  hours) . 
Subjects will undergo HV for 5 minutes (HV period 1). If no absence seizure occurs , the 
subject will rest for 5  minutes and then undergo HV f or an additional 5 minutes (HV period 
2). Further details, including procedures for HV and PS will be elaborated in the EEG 
Charter.  
Subjects will begin documenting absence seizure -free days  in a daily diary and will continue 
to do so for the duration of the study. See Table 3 for a detailed list of assessments to be 
performed.   
7.2.2 Visit 1 ( Day 0  - Baseline)

continued eligibility by the central reviewer and sponsor , subjects will receive the first dose 
of study drug (2  mg or placebo) with food and undergo assessments as detailed in Table 3. 
Subjects will be followed for adverse events, orthostatic vital signs , and ECG  for at least 
2 hours prior to discharge. The investigator or qualified designee will make the 
determination of whether it is safe to release the subject from the clinic.  Subjects will be 
instructed to take the second daily dose of study drug no sooner than 10  hours and no later 
than 14 hours (every 12 hours ± 2 hours) fr om the time of their first dose.

may take place on Day 25, 26 , or 27 as needed for scheduling.  Subjects will be instructed to 
take their dose of study drug before reporting to the clinic.  
A standard multi -lead video- EEG with HV and photic stimulation (PS) will be obtained over 
30 minutes and will be followed by an additional 6 -hour awake video- EEG (total, 6.5  hours). 
During this time, safety assessments, as shown in Table 3, will be conducted, and 2 PK blood 
samples, separated by >2  hours, will be obtained. Subjects will undergo HV for 5  minutes 
(HV period 1). If no absence seizure occurs, after a 5- minute rest, subjects will undergo HV 
for an additional 5 minutes (HV period 2). Further details, including procedures for HV and 
PS will be elaborated in the EEG Charter.  Adverse events that are unresolved at the visit will 
continue to be follow ed by study staff as detailed in Section 10.2.3 . 
7.2.9 Telephone Safety Check (Day 33 ) 
One week after the End of Study Visit, the study staff will contact the subject s by telephone  
to qu ery them about their health status, including the occurrence of any AEs. Subjects who 
are experiencing any AEs may be asked to return for an unscheduled visit. Subjects who are 
experiencin g any nervous or psychiatric system-related AEs should return to the clinic for

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 52 of 91 7.3 Concomitant Medications and Other Restrictions  
7.3.1 Concomitant Medications 
The u se of prescription or nonprescription drugs or oth er products ( e.g., grapefruit juice) 
known to be strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4 must be discontinued 2  weeks prior to 
Day 1 of dosing and withheld throughout the study.  See Appendix B for a complete list of 
restricted inhibitors and inducers.  
7.3.2 Other Restrictions 
Regular use of more than 2 standard drinks of alcohol per day is prohibited . In the United 
States, a standard drink contains about 14 grams of alcohol. This roughly corresponds to a 
12-fluid ounce (350  mL) glass of beer (5% alcohol by volume [ABV]), a 5- fluid ounce 
(150 mL ) glass of wine (12% ABV), or a 1.5- fluid ounce (44  mL) glass of a spirit (40% ABV).  
Use of any illicit drugs is prohibited throughout the study period.  
8 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS 
8.1 Electroencephalogram  
 
A standard multi -lead video- EEG with HV and photic stimulation (PS) will be obtained over 
30 minutes and will be followed by an additional 6 -hour awake video- EEG (total, 6.5  hours). 
HV will be conducted under the protocol used in the NIH -sponsored childhood absence 
study (Glauser et al., 2010).  The first 30 minutes will consist of  HV and PS. For HV, subjects 
will be hyperventilated for 5 minutes or until the subject has an absence seizure (HV 
period  1). If no absence seizure occurs during HV period  1, the subject will rest for 
5 minutes and the n perform hyperventilation for an additional 5 minutes (HV period  2). 
Photic stimulation will be performed as described in the EEG charter. The EEG will be 
centrally evaluated by a qualified rater.  After completion of the above 30 -minute video- EEG 
during w hich HV and PS are carried out, the video -EEG will continue, and the subjects will 
be monitored during wakefulness for an additional 6 hours (total , 6.5 h ours ). The EEG 
recording will be centrally evaluated by a qualified rater.  Procedures for VH, PS and video-
EEG will be elaborated in the EEG Charter.  
8.2 Seizure -related Disability  Assessment Scale 
The SERDAS was developed to assess functional impairment in work/school, social, and 
family life . The S ERDAS is a 6- item self-report tool on which the patient rates the extent to 
which work/school, social life , and homelife or family responsibilities are impaired by his or 
her symptoms on a 10 -point visual analog scale . 
8.3 Daily S eizure Diary  
Beginning at the screening visit and continuing each day until the End of Stu dy Visit, 
subjects will document if they had any absence seizures on that day (absence seizure -free

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 53 of 91 day). The number of absence seizure- free days will be calculated during both the baseline 
period and the treatment period.  
9 PHARMACOKINETIC AND PHARMACOGENOMIC 
ASSESSMENTS 
9.1 Blood Sample Collection for Pharmacokinetic 
Assessments 
For details on the timing, volume, handling, storage , and methods of analysis of blood 
samples see the Laboratory Manual.  
9.2 Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
Plasma  concentrations of CX -8998 and its metabolites (including, but not limited to, M01 
and M02)  will be determined . 
The concentrations of CX -8998 and its met abolites (including, but not limited to, M01 and 
M02) in plasma will be summarized by visit, timepoint  and dose using descriptive statistics.  
The concentration data will also be used as part of an exploratory population PK/PD 
analysis intended to evaluate  the exposure -response and exposure -safety relationships , 
which will be  reported separately from the c linical study r eport.  
9.3 Pharmacogenomics of Drug Response  
Genomic and metabolomic variation may help to explain some of the variability in response 
seen with some drugs among different individuals . This is referred to as 
pharmacogenomics . Comparing the DNA, RNA, protein, and metabolite variation patterns of 
subjects who respond well and those who respond poorly to treatment may help to better define the most appropriate group of subject s in which to target a given treatment . 
Collecting and retaining samples for pharmacogenomic analyses makes it possible to seek 
explanations for differences in, for example, exposure, efficacy, tolerability, or safety not antici pated prior to the beginning of the study.  
An optional 4-mL blood sample will be collected at Visit 1 /baseline  and retained for 
potential pharmacogenomic analyses related to drug response for subjects who consent to 
provide sample for these potential analyses . For example, putative safety biomarkers, drug 
metabolizing enzyme genes, drug transport protein genes, or genes thought to be related to the mechanism of drug action may be examined.  Detailed collection, processing, storage and 
shipment instructions are provided in the Laboratory Manual .

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 54 of 91 10 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
10.1 Assessment of Safety  
10.1.1 Adverse Events  
Adverse events (AEs)  will be captured from the time the ICF is signed through the EOS 
telephone safety  check  on Day 33. SAEs will be reported up to 30  days after the last dose of 
study drug. A follow -up phone call will be made 30 days after the last dose of study drug for 
evaluation of any SAEs. See Section 10.2 for definitions and instructions on the rating and 
collection of AEs.  
10.1.2 Physical and Neurological Examinations  
A complete  physical examination  includes  measurement of height (screening only),  weight , 
and examination of general appearance, skin, neck (including thyroid), eyes, ears, nose, 
throat, heart, lungs, abdomen, lymph nodes, and extremities . Genital, rectal, and breast 
examination may be excluded if not clinically indicated.  Weight should  be measured on the 
same scale  each time . A neurological examination includes testing mental status, gait, 
cerebellar function, cranial nerves, motor functioning (including strength and reflexes), and sensation.  
The targeted  physical examination is at the investigator’s discretion based on subject 
reported signs and symptoms and investigator observations.  
10.1.3 Vital Signs 
Vital signs include body temperature, systolic and diastolic blood pressure s, pulse rate , and 
respiration rate.  
Blood pressure and pulse rate will be measured in the recumbent position after at least 2 minutes of recumbency, and both will be measured again after approximately no less than 
1 minute of standing. Subjects should be observed carefully for dizziness or unsteadiness while standing and allowed to sit if such occurs. Blood pressure and pulse rate should be recorded as soon as possible after sitting if the subject cannot stand for 1  full minute.  
Recumbent and standing recordings of blood pressure and pulse rate will be made  at the 
Screening Visit  and at the Day 2 6 Visit. Orthostatic blood pressure  and pulse rate will be 
measured before dosing (recumbent and standing)  on Day 1 . During any visit  (screening, 
baseline, or Day  26 or an unscheduled clinic visit) , blood pressure and pulse rate are to be 
assessed at any  time subjects appear faint or complain of dizziness or other symptoms 
suggestive of hypotension.  
Respiratory rate and temperature will be measured in the recumbent position and need 
only be measured one time (with the first set of blood pressure/pulse measurements)

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 55 of 91 10.1.4 Clinical Laboratory  Tests 
The following screening/safety laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) will 
be performed after 4 to 6 hours of fasting: 
• Hematology testing will include hematocrit, hemoglobin, red blood cell count, white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), and platelet count.  
• Serum chemistry analyses will include sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, phos phorus, bicarbonate, albumin, total protein, glucose, blood urea 
nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, creatine kinase (CK), uric acid, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, triglycerides, total cholesterol, and total bilirubin.  
• Urinalysis wi ll be performed only as clinically indicated .  
10.1.5 Urine Drug Screen 
Subjects will undergo urine drug screening for the presence of phencyclidine (PCP), cocaine, cannabinoids, opiates/barbiturates, benzodiazepines, amphetamines, methadone , and 
MDMA ( Ecstasy)  at the Screening Visit and at the Day 26 Visit. Subjects who have a positive 
urine drug screen will be excluded from the study unless the positive result is explained by 
the use of an approved prescription medication. 
10.1.6 Pregnancy  Tests 
A urine  pregnancy test will be performed for all WOCBP . See Section 6.2, inclusion criterion 
#10 for the definition of WOCBP .  
Positive urine tests will be confirmed with a serum pregnancy test. Subjects may not enter 
the study if pregnant  and must be immediately be discontinued from dosing when a positive 
pregnancy test is reported during study participation . 
10.1.7 Electrocardiogram  
A 12 -lead ECG will be obtained according to the Schedule of Assessments  (Table 3). Subjects 
must rest in the supine position for at least 10  minutes before the ECG recording is started . 
The ECG should be recorded during the period of rest required before blood collection and 
the measurements of orthostatic blood pressure, pulse rate, and respiratory rate . A 
qualified physician will review the ECGs and any clinically important finding will be 
recorded on the appropriate CRF. The investigator is responsible for providing 
interpretation of all ECGs . The results will include heart rate, PR interval, QRS interval, QT 
interval, and QTc interval, and assessment of rhythm and morphology. If necessary, (e .g., 
suspected QTc prolongation) , a manual reading of the ECG data will be perf ormed.  
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs to rule out improper lead placement as contributing to the ECG abnormality. It is important that leads are placed in the same positions each time in order to achieve precise ECG recordings . If a machine- read 
QTc value is prolonged, as defined above, repeat measurements may not be necessary if a

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 56 of 91 qualified physician’s interpretation determines that the QTc values are in the acceptable 
range.  
10.1.8 Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale  
The C -SSRS is a suicida l ideation rating scale created by researchers at Columbia University 
(Posner , 201
1). It rates an individual's degree of suicidal ideation on a scale, ranging from 
"wish to 
be dead" to "active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent."  
The scal
e identifies behaviors that may be indicative of an individual's intent to commit 
suicide. The C -SSRS is used extensively across primary care, clinical practice, surveillance, 
research, and institutional settings.  It is available in more than 100 country- specific 
languages  and is part of a national and international public health initiative involving the 
assessment of suicidal ideation and behavior.  
The C -SSRS requires no mental h ealth training to administer. An electronic patient -reported 
version of the C -SSRS is also available in tablet, interactive voice response, and web versions 
(Mundt 2010
; Mundt 2013).   
Subjects with a history of attempted suicide within the past year or a C -SSRS score of 4 or 5 
at screening will be excluded from the study. Subjects who answer “yes” to Suicidal Ideation 
item 4 or 5 on the C -SSRS during the study must be withdrawn from study treatment. 
Investigators should also withdraw subjects from tre atment if, in the judgment of the 
investigator, the subject develops other indicators of significant risk of suicide. In the event 
that suicidal ideation is observed in any study subject, the i nvestigator will manage the 
situation as he/she deems medically  and psychiatrically appropriate.  
The “lifetime” version of the C- SSRS will be used at screening, and the “since last visit” 
version will be used at all other visits.  
Samples of the C -SSRS are provided in Appendix  A1. 
10.1.9 University of Miami Parkinson’s Disease Hallucinations Questionnaire 
The UM -PDHQ was specifically developed to quantitatively and qualitatively assess 
hallucinations in patients with Parkinson’s disease ( Papapetropoulos, 2008 ). The UM- PDHQ 
is a 2
0-item clinician -administered questionnaire that is completed during a structured 
interview. Questions are divided into 2 groups: a quantitative group that consists of 6 questions (modality, frequency, duration, insight, emotional burden) and a qualitative 
group that consists of 14 questions. The first item is a gating question to assess the presence or absence of hallucinations.  
The inve
stigator will complete the UM -PDHQ for any subject who experiences visual 
hallucinations during the stud y. The investigator should discuss the continued participation 
of any subject developing visual hallucinations during the study with the study safety representative.  
A copy of the UM- PDHQ is provided in  Appendix  A2.

10.2.1 Definitions  
Adverse Event  
An AE is any unfavorable or unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medical treatment or procedure that may or may not be considered related to the medical treatment or 
procedure.  
Seizure should not be reported as an AE or SAE unless it is a new seizure type, the 
frequency of seizure increases, status epilepticus occurs, or the investigator considers the 
seizure to be an AE or SAE.  
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
The following are considered AESIs: increase in seizure frequency, new seizure type, and 
status epilepticus.  
Laboratory Abnormality  
A laboratory abnormality is any clinically significant laboratory abnormality that suggest s a 
disease or organ toxicity and that is of a severity to require active management (i.e., changes 
of dose, discontinuation of drug, more frequent follow -up, medical treatment , diagnostic 
investigation). Laboratory abnormalities are also considered AEs.  
Treatment -emergent Adverse Events  
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are all AEs occurring during the treat ment 
period or a pretreatment event  that worsens in intensity during the treatment period.  
Treatment Period  
The treatment period is the period during which a subject receives study drug (i.e., first 
dose through  Day 26).  
Intolerable Adverse Event  
An intolerable AE is one that is considered by the investigator to be related to study drug 
(Section 10.2.2.3) AND is either a severe or life-threatening event ( Section 10.2.2.2) OR is a 
mild  or moderate  event that prompts the subject to express a desire to discontinue dosing. 
Dose adjustments for intolerable AEs are described in Section 4.6. 
Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is any adverse event  that results in death, is life  threatening, requires inpatient 
hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect observed in any offspring of the subject conceived during treatment with the study drug, or is an important 
medical event. See Section 10.3 for more details on SAEs.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 58 of 91 10.2.2 Collection and Rating of Adverse Events  
All AEs, irrespective of the relatedness to the study drug, will be captured from the time the 
ICF is signed through the telephone safety check on Day 33. SAEs will be reported up to 
30 days after the last dose of study drug. A follow -up phone call will be made 30  days after 
the last dose of study drug for evaluation of any SAEs. In case of an SAE, an SAE Report 
Form must be completed and transmitted to the s ponsor or designee within 24  hours.  
Overdoses and medication errors in the presence of clinical consequences should be 
recorded as AEs. The clinical consequence should be reported as “[enter AE] due to 
overdose .” See Section 4.7 for overdose management.  
10.2.2.1 Onset Date  
The onset date is the date when the first sign(s) or symptom(s) were first noted. For example, if the AE is an abnormal laboratory test (such as “platelets  low”), the onset date is 
the date when the sample was taken.  If the subject was hospitalized for meningitis, and 
symptoms such as fever, headache , and nausea started the day before the hospitalization, 
the onset date is the day symptoms presented versus day of hospitalization.  
10.2.2.2 Assessment of Intensity 
Each adverse event will be graded according to the following definitions:  
• Mild:  asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; intervention not indicated;  
• Moderate:  minimal, local o r noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting 
age- appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) 
[Instrumental ADL refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc];  
• Severe:   medically significant but not immediately life- threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care ADL [ self-care  ADL refer to bathing, dressing and 
undressing, feeding self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden]  
10.2.2.3 Relationship to Study Drug  
The assessment of the relationship of an AE to the administration of study drug is a clinical decision based on all available information at the time of the completion of the CRF.  
The causal relationship of the study drug to an AE will be rated as follows:
  
• Related:  T he AE has at least a possible or stronger causal relationship to the 
study drug, i.e., there are facts in evidence to suggest a causal relationship to the study drug.  The study treatment and the AE are 
reasonably related in time, and any alternative etiology is equally or less likely.

Protocol Number: CX -8998 -CLN2 -002 Version 6.0 Issue Date : 30 May 2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 59 of 91 • NOT Related:  Exposure to study treatment did not occur ; or the occurrence of the AE 
is not reasonably related in time, or is due to an 
underlying/intercurrent illness,  or to other medication or procedure; 
or the AE is considered unlikely to be related to the study treatment.   
10.2.2.4 Action Taken  
The action taken toward the study drug in response to an AE will be listed as one of the following:  
• None:   No change in study drug dosage was made. 
• Reduced:   Dose of study drug was reduced , with or without a period of 
temporary suspension of dosing . 
• Discontinued:  T he study drug was permanently stopped . 
10.2.2.5 Outcome of Adverse Event  
The outcome of an AE will be recorded as one of the following:  
• Recovered:   fully recovered or the condition has returned to the level observed at baseline  
• Recovered with sequel ae:  resulted in persistent or significant disability or incapacity; the nature of the sequelae should be specified  
• Not yet recovered  
• Death 
10.2.3 Adverse Event Follow -up 
Adverse events requiring therapy must be treated with recognized standards of medical care t o protect the health and well -being of the subject.  
Any subject who has any AE (whether serious or non- serious) or clinically significant (in the 
investigator’s opinion) abnormal laboratory test values will be evaluated by the investigator 
or qualified designee and will be treated and followed up until the symptoms or values 
return to normal or acceptable levels, as judged by the investigator and the  sponsor.  
All AEs, whether serious or non -serious, will be collected beginning at the time the ICF is 
signed through the telephone safety check on Day 33. All AEs should be followed until 
resolution or: 
1. 30 days from onset; or  
2. 30 days after the last dose of study drug ; or  
3. the subject is lost to follow- up (as defined in Section 6.4.1); or  
4. the subject withdraws consent,  
whichever occurs first.   
SAEs will be reported up to 30  days after the last dose of study drug. A follow- up phone call 
will be made 30  days after the last dose of study drug for evaluation of any SAEs.

in the clinical study report.  
10.3 Serious and Other Significant Adverse Events  
10.3.1 Definition of a Serious Adverse Event 
A serious adverse event is any adverse event  that  
• Results in death. Death is not an event per se but rather an outcome. Not e that any AE 
resulting in a fatal outcome must be fully documented and reported, including deaths 
that occur within 30 days after treatment ends and irrespective of the causal relationship to the study drug.  
• Is life  threatening. Life threatening refers to an AE in which the subject was at 
immediate risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which may have caused death, if it was more severe.  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
Hospitalization means that the subject was admitted to hospital or that existing hospitalization was extended as a result of an AE. Hospitalization describes a period of 
at least 24 hours. Over -night stays for observation,  stays at the emergency room or 
treatment on an outpatient basis do not constitute a hospitalization. However, medical judgment must always be exercised and, when in doubt, the case should be considered serious (i.e. , if the case fulfills the criterion for a medically important event). 
Hospitalization for administrative or social purposes does not constitute an SAE. Hospital admissions and/or surgical operations planned before study inclusion are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the subject was  enroll ed in the 
study, provided that the condition did not deteriorate during the study.  
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. Disability/incapacity 
means a substantial disruption of a person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. If i n 
doubt, the decision should be left to medical judgment by the investigator.  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Any congenital anomaly or birth defect 
observed in any offspring of the subject that was conceived during treatment with the 
study drug.  
• Is an important medical event. Important medical events are events that may not be 
immediately life  threatening or result in death or hospitalization but that may 
jeopardize the subject or require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the definition above. Examples of important medical events include AEs that suggest a significant hazard, contraindication, or precaution; occurrence of malignancy ; 
or development of drug dependency or drug abuse. Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether events qualify as medically important.  
An AE caused by an overdose or medical error is considered serious if a criterion listed in the definitions above is fulfilled.  
Cavion, Inc.   CX-8998 in Absence Epilepsy  
Protocol Number: CX -8998 -CLN2 -002 Version 6.0 Issue Date : 30 May 2019  
 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 61 of 91 The following are not  considered SAEs:  
• A preexisting conditio n that is present prior to or at the start of the study that did not 
worsen . 
• Hospitalizations for treatment , which were elective or preplanned, for a preexisting 
condition unrelated to the indication under study that did not worsen. 
• Admission to a hospital  or other institution for general care not associated with any 
deterioration in condition.  
10.3.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting by the Investigator to the Sponsor 
Any SAE that  occurs after a subject has entered the study, whether or not related to study 
drug, m ust be reported to the sponsor or the sponsor’s agent immediately (within 24 h ours) 
via telephone or email . If initially reported via telephone, this must be followed -up by a 
written SAE report. The investigator must report all SAEs that occur  from the time the 
subject signs the ICF until 30 days after last dose of the study drug.  
A completed SAE Report Form with the best possible details must be transmitted to the 
sponsor representative within 24 hours of knowledge of the SAE according to contact 
details as specified below:  
Sponsor Representative and Contact Information for SAE Reporting:  
SAE Reporting Primary Contact:  Premier Research Pharmacovigilance 
Reporting email:    GlobalPV -US@premier -research.com   
Back -up reporting fax number:  +1.215.972.8765  
10.3.3 Handling of Follow -up Information 
Follow -up information may be required , or additional information may be requested  by the 
sponsor (e.g., evolution of the SAE, other signs or symptoms, final diagnosis, final outcome, 
hospital discharge summary, autopsy report). The same procedures and timelines as for 
initial reporting, listed above, should be foll owed for any follow -up information.  If 
necessary, the study site will be visited to collect additional information.  
Follow -up information is required on all SAEs until one the following criteria is satisfied:  
۰ The final outcome of the case is known. 
۰ The eve nt is resolved or the medical condition of the subject is stabilized . 
۰ No further information is available. 
۰ Sponsor assessment has been finalized . 
۰ The subject has withdrawn consent for further follow-up; information obtained up 
to the date and time of withd rawal of consent will remain a part of the study record.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 62 of 91 10.3.4 Reporting and Follow -up of Pregnancy  
When an investigator becomes aware of the pregnancy of a female subject  (or female 
partner of a male subject) , the investigator must withdraw the subject from the  study 
treatment  and follow the pregnancy until termination or until the child is 1 month old.  The 
pregnancy will be reported immediately by telephone and by faxing a completed Pregnancy 
Report to the s ponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  The pregnancy will not be 
processed as an SAE; however, the i nvestigator should notify the s ponsor or the sponsor’s 
agent of the outcome of the pregnancy by submitting a follow -up Pregnancy Report. 
Additionally, if the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criteria for immediate classification of an SAE (e.g., spontaneous or therapeutic abortion, stillbirth, neonatal death, congenital anomaly), the i nvestigator will report the event by phone and by faxing a completed SAE 
Report Form to the sponsor within 24 hours of knowledge of the event.  
10.3.5 Expedited Reporting of Serious Adverse Events  
10.3.5.1 Responsibilities 
The sponsor is responsible for ensuring the timely reporting of SAEs to r egulatory 
authorities and to all investigators who participate in the clinical development program of 
the study drug.  It is the responsibility of the investigator to provide the sponsor with the 
case information such that reporting timeline demands of applicable regulatory authorities 
can be met.  
10.3.5.2 Expedited Reporting  
All AEs that are serious, unexpected, and considered related to the study drug judged by the 
sponsor will undergo expedited reporting.  All available information relevant to the 
evaluation of the SAE will be reported.  Serious AEs will be considered reportable regardless 
of whether or not the study drug was used in accordance with the provisions in the 
protocol.  
Adverse events that are serious, but expected, or those that are not associated with the 
study drug will only be subjected to expedited reporting if they are required  to be reported 
to an authority according to national requirements.  
10.3.5.3 Timelines 
Fatal or life- threatening serious unexpected related cases require rapid reporting.  
regulatory authorities shall be notified as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar days 
after first knowledge by the sponsor representative, followed by as complete a report as 
possible within 8 additional calendar days.   
Serious unexpected related cases that are not fatal or life  threatening must be submitted as 
soon as possible, but no later than 15 calendar days after first knowledge by the sponsor 
representative that the case meets the minimum criteria for expedited reporting.  
It is the responsibility of the investigator to supp ort s ponsor activities needed to meet the 
aforementioned timelines for regulatory authority reporting in the event of an SAE.

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 63 of 91 10.4 Safety Monitoring and Risk Mitigation Plan  
Measures to minimize the risks to subjects enrolled in this clinical trial have been ta ken 
with respect to the following study design elements: 
• Subject safety and tolerability will be monitored in this study across multiple 
dimensions by tracking clinical  AEs; vital signs (including orthostatic pulse and 
blood pressure); general and neurological physical examinations; standard clinical laboratory safety panels for complete blood counts, chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis; standard 12 -lead ECGs ; the C- SSRS; and the UM-PDHQ.  
• The specified inclusion/exclusion criteria have been carefully considered to avoid 
enrollment of subjects for whom exposure to the study drug might pose a hazard.  
• This study will perform a careful dose titration in which dosing of CX -8998 will be 
initiated at 2 mg BID for 2 days  and then increas ed to 4 mg BI D for 6 days, to 6 mg 
BID for 6 days, to 8 mg BID  for 6 days, and , finally, if to lerated, to the target dose of 
10 mg BID for 6 days. The study is designed to allow for flexible titration. The dose 
should only be increased if the previous dose level is well tolerated. S hould subjects 
experience intolerable AEs (see Section 10.2.1) at 6 mg, 8 mg, or 10  mg BID, study 
drug may be discontinued , or the dose may be decreased to the previous lower dose. 
Subjects who experienc e intolerable AEs at 2 mg or 4 mg BID  will be discontinued 
from treatment.  
• Dose modification and stopping rules are in place for individual subjects (see Section 4.4). Near real- time safety and tolerability monitoring for individual subjects 
is the primary responsibility of the principal investigators and su b-investiga tors . 
• All SAEs meeting criteria for expedited reporting to the US FDA will be reported to the FDA and all institutional review boards ( IRBs ) in accordance with regulatory 
timelines.  
• The sponsor’s Study Safety Representative will monitor aggregate study level safety 
and tolerability after approximately 50% of the projected sample size of su bjects 
have completed the EOS  Visit. These reviews will be based on blinded, select listings 
and summary tables  of the evolving safety and tolerability data for each arm of the 
study. Decision- making will depend on the specifics of the safety and tolerability 
data reviewed.  
• In the event of a treated subject’s death within 30 days of the last dose of study drug that is assessed by the treating principal investigator/sub -investi gator  or the Study 
Safety Representative as at least possibly related to study drug, further enrollment 
in the study will be immediately suspended until a safety review can be conducted by the  Study Safety Representative , the actively participating principal 
investigators/sub- investigators , and the s ponsor. As required by regulation, all 
deaths that meet  the criteria for expedited reporting to the US FDA will be reported 
to the FDA and all IRBs  within regulatory timelines. A final decision to reopen the 
study to new enrollment without modification(s), reopen with modification(s), or

11.3 Determination of Sample Size 
Up to approximately 15 eligible subjects will receive CX- 8998. The sample size was not 
based on statistical considerations but rather chosen to provide safety and efficacy information on CX -8998 when administered according to this protocol.  
11.4 Analysis Populations  
The populations defined for analysis will include the intent -to-treat (ITT) population, sa fety 
population, and a PK population. Additional analysis populations may be defined to evaluate 
study results ; these populations will be defined in the SAP.  
• Intent -To- Treat Population: The ITT population will include all subjects who are  
enrolled  in the study . The ITT population will be used for analyses of ac countability, 
demographics , and efficacy .  
• Safety Population: The safety population will include all subjects who are enrolled in 
the study and receive at least 1 dose of  CX- 8998 The safety population will be the 
primary population for all analyses of safety data.  
• PK Population: The PK population will consist of all subjects who received study 
treatment and for whom PK samples were obtained  and sufficient plasma 
concentrations are available.

12.1.1 Protocol Amendment 
Administrative amendments to the protocol will be classed as amendment of typographical 
errors, clarifications of confusing wording, and other minor modifications , including, but 
not limited to, name, address, and contact information changes that have no impact on the 
safety of the subject or the science of the study.  Administrative amendments will be 
submitted to the IRB for information only.  The sponsor will ensure that acknowle dgement 
is received and filed.  Otherwise, an amendment will be classed as a substantial amendment 
and will be submitted to the appropriate regulatory authorities and the IRB for approval.  
12.1.2 Protocol Deviations and Waivers 
Requests for waivers will generally not be granted  in advance by  the s ponsor. Should a non-
anticipated protocol deviation occur, the sponsor must be informed as soon as possible.  All 
deviations and the reasons for the deviation will be documented by the investigator or 
designated staff.  Reporting of protocol deviations to the IRB and in accordance with 
applicable regulatory authority mandates is an investigator responsibility.  
12.2 Ethics and Regulatory Aspects

applicable regulatory requirements.  All ethics approvals must be obtained , and all 
regulatory obligations must be met before a subject is exposed to any study -related 
procedure, including screening tests for el igibility. 
12.2.3 Subject Informed Consent 
Subjects will be informed about the study both verbally and in writing.  Each subject will be 
provided with a written subject information sheet that has been approved by the IRB and will be given a reasonable time to consider the study and to ask any questions regarding the study. The written subject information sheet and ICF must be i n a language that the subject 
can understand .  
Only the investigator, a medically qualified sub- investigator , or a suitably qualified and 
trained authorized person may be involved in the informed consent process.  
The investigator or suitable designee will obtain a freely given, written consent from each 
subject after an appropriate explanation of the aims, methods, potential hazards, and any 
other aspects of the study that are relevant to the decision of the subject to participate.  The 
investigator will explain that the subject is completely free to refuse to enter the study or to 
withdraw from it at any time, without any consequences for furt her care and without the 
need to justify.  
The ICF must be si gned and dated by the subject before any study- related procedure  is 
performed , including screening tests for eligibility. The subject will receive a copy of the 
written subject information sheet and the ICF.  
Each subject will be informed that a monitor, a quality assurance auditor mandated by the 
sponsor, or a health authority i nspector, in accordance with applicable regulatory 
requirements, may review his or her source records and health data.  Data protection will be 
handled in compliance with national and local regulations.  
If new safety information becomes available and results in significant changes in the risk -to-benefit assessment, the written subject information sheet will be revised or updated 
where necessary.  Under these circumstances, all subjects (including those already being 
treated) should be informed of the new information, given a copy of the revised form, and 
allowed to reevaluate their consent to continue in the study.  
12.3 End of Study and Regulatory Notification  
The study can be terminated in part or in whole at the discretion of the FDA, an applicable regulatory authority, or the sponsor.

the privacy and confidentiality rules in accordance with applicable regula tory 
requirement(s).  
12.5 Monitoring  
The study will be monitored to ensure that the study is conducted and documented properly according to the protocol, GCP s, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  
On-site visits will be made at appropriate times during the study.  Monitors must have direct 
access to source documentation in order to check the consistency of the data recorded in the CRF s. 
The investigator will make available to the monitor source documents, medical records, and 
source data necessary to complete CRFs. In addition, the investigator will work closely with 
the m onitor s and, as needed, provide them appropriate evidence that the conduct of the 
study is being done in accordance with applicable regulations and GCP guidelines.  
Monitoring of safety data will be conducted in accordance with the safety monitoring plan outlined in Section 10.4. 
12.6 Quality Assurance and Quality Control  
The sponsor or its designee will perform the quality assurance and quality control activities 
of this study; however, responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, and reliability of the study data presented to the sponsor lies with the principal or q ualified investigator 
generating the data.   
Prior to the study initiation, the sponsor will explain the protocol, Investigator’s Brochure, 
and CRFs to investigators.  In addition, the monitor will be available to explain applicable 
regulations and to answer any questions regarding the conduct of the study.  
At its discretion, the sponsor may conduct audits as part of the implementation of quality 
assurance to ensure that the study is being conducted in compliance with the protocol, standard operating p rocedures, GCP s, and all applicable regulatory requirements.  Audits 
will be independent of and separate from the routine monitoring and quality control functions.  
The study center may also be compelled to an inspection by a regulatory authority. 
12.7 Source Data 
Source data are defined as information in original records and certified copies of original records of clinical findings, observations, data, or other activities in a clinical study necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the study.   
Source documents are the original data, documents, and records.  Examples include hospital 
records, laboratory reports, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated

microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays , other 
radiographic depictions or displays, subject files, and records kept at the pharmacy, at the 
laboratories and at medico- technical departments involved in the clinical study.  All source 
documents must  be reviewed  by the principal investigator and the sponsor (or designee)  
for compliance with GCP.  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audit(s), IRB review(s), and 
regulatory inspection(s), with a direct access t o all the required source documents and 
associated records.  
13 DATA AND RECORD KEEPING  
13.1 Case Report Forms  
Study sites will be provided access to an electronic data capture (EDC) system that has been 
fully validated and conforms to 21 CFR Part 11 requirements. The sponsor or designee will 
train designated study site staff on the EDC system. Study site staff will not be given access to the EDC system until they have been trained. Designated study site staff will enter the data required by the protocol into the e lectronic CRFs  (eCRFs) . The investigator must 
certify that the data are complete and accurate prior to database lock. After database lock, the investigator will receive a CD- ROM copy of the subject data for archiving at the study 
site.  
Designated Cavion pe rsonnel will review the data on the eCRFs entered by study site staff 
for completeness and accuracy. Authorized study site staff will respond to queries sent to 
their site and make any necessary changes to the data.  
13.2 Record Keeping  
The investigator must arr ange for retention of study records (“Essential Documents for the 
Conduct of a Trial” are listed in the ICH “Guideline for Good Clinical Practice,” Section 8, E6) 
at the site, in a secure location, for 2 years after the last approval of a marketing applica tion 
in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or for at least 2  years after the formal discontinuation of clinical development 
of the investigational product. These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by the applicable regulatory requirements or by agreement with the sponsor. It is the responsibility of the sponsor to inform the investigator/institution as to 
when these documents no longer need to be retained.  The investigator should take 
measures to prevent any accidental or premature destruction of these documents.

This scale is intended to be used by individuals who have received training in its administration. The questions contained in 
the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale are suggested probes. Ultimately, the determination of the presence of suicidal 
ideation or behavior depends on the judgment of the individual administering the scale. 
Defrnitions of behavioral suicidal events in this scale are based on those used in The Columbia Suicide Histo,y form

mouth but gun 1s broken so no injury results, this is considered an attempt. 
Inf erring Inten t: Even if an individual denies intent/..vish to die, it may be inferred clinically from the behavior or circumstances. For example, 
a highly lethal act that is clearly not an accident sono other intent but suicide can be inferred (e.g., gunshot to head, jumping from window of 
a high floor/stcry) . .Also, if someooe denies intent to die, but they thought that what they did could be lethal, intent may be inferred

This scale is intended tD be used by individuals who have received training in its administration. The questions contained in 
the Columbia-Suicide Severitoj Rating Scale are suggested probes. Ultimately, the determination of the presence of suicidal 
ideation or behavior depends on the judgment of the individual administering the scale. 
Definitions of behavioral suicidal events in this scale are based on those used in The Columbia Suicide History Form,

Part II: A Double- Blind, Randomized, Placebo- Controlled, Serial-Panel, Rising -Multiple- Dose Study in Healthy Young Male Subjects (40 
healthy males, 18- 45 years old)  
Design  Single oral doses 2 -18 mg or placebo, fasted  
 
Summary of 
findings  Safety, Part I (elderly males, single dose):  
• Single doses up to 18 mg of CX -8998 were generally well tolerated 
• TEAE were temporary and generally mild or mode rate in intensity. The 
most frequent TEAE included general, nervous system, and psychiatric 
disorders: relaxation, fuzzy head, tiredness, headache, lightheadedness, dizziness, mood alteration   
• No dose dependent, treatment related effects were observed on safety labs, 
ECGs, ECG telemetry monitoring or vital signs  PK (elderly males, single oral dose):  
• Dose proportional increase in Cmax and AUC 0-
inf 
• Tmax 0.5-1 hr (fasted)  
• Biphasic elimination; terminal T ½ = 18.8- 22.6 
hrs 
 
 Safety, Part II (young males, multiple dosing once QD X 7 days):  
• Multiple oral doses up to 12 -mg daily X 7 days were generally well 
tolerated; TEAEs of mood or perceptual disturbance became more frequent 
and intense at the 18- mg once daily dose  
• Most common TEAE's considered at least possibly drug related were headache, lightheadedness, tiredness, feeling happy or pleasant, feeling emotional, tiredness, somnolence, relaxation, abnormal or vivid dreams or day dreams, and paresthesia/hypoesthesia. No subjects treated with CX -
8998 at doses < 18 mg po QD X 7 days discontinued treatment for AEs  
• For subjects experiencing CNS AE's, these were generally observed at or near T
max; late occurrence (e.g., days after dosing) was not observed in the 
absence of CNS AE's near T max 
 PK, Part II  
• Dose prop ortional Day 1 and Day 7 C max and 
AUC 0-24hr  
• Terminal T ½ = 11 hrs  
• Steady state trough attained after 2 days of dosing  
• Day 7/Day 1 geometric mean accumulation ratios for CX -8998 were 1.31 (AUC
0-24hr) and 
1.15 (C max) for the 8 mg dose;  
• Day 7 mean ( ±SD)  Cmax = 665 (156) nM and  
AUC 0-24hr = 4679(1495) nM hr

CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY  Page 88 of 91  • Two syncopal episodes occurred: 1) A subject fainted after standing 2 hours 
after the first dose of CX -8998 2 mg po; assessed as vasovagal probably not 
related to CX -8998, and the subject continued thr ough the full 7 days of 
dosing without further events of syncope or dose related blood pressure, 
heart rate or orthostatic changes; and 2) A subject experienced syncope 2 hours after the first dose of CX -8998 18 mg po; the event was judged by the 
investiga tor as moderate in intensity and probably study drug related. Due 
to ongoing nausea and feeling weak/lethargic, this subject was discontinued from the study after the first dose  
• One subject experienced a serious adverse event (SAE) of mood swings following the first dose of 18 mg CX -8998; no additional doses were given 
and the event was assessed as moderate in intensity and probably study 
drug related

Title  
(population)  A 2-Part, Adaptive Design, Randomized, Double -Blind, Placebo -Controlled Crossover Polysomnogram (PSG) Study to Evaluate the Effects 
of Single Doses of MK- 8998 on Slow Wave Activity and Rapid Eye Movement Sleep in Healthy Middle Aged and Elderly Subjects (28 
healthy males, 40- 80 years old)  
Design  Single oral doses of 4, 8, or 12 mg CX -8998 or placebo prior to bedtime  
Summary of 
findings  Safety:  
• Single oral doses of 4, 8, or 12 mg CX -8998 were well tolerated  
• The most common AE's were headaches, vivid dreams, and visual 
and/or auditory disturbances/ hallucinations. The dose of CX -8998 was 
administered at bedtime for this sleep study. The visual and auditory disturbances/hallucinations were typically described as seeing geometric shapes, colors, lights and/or movement, and hearing tones similar to a te lephone or electronic music. These were generally not 
disturbing to subjects. These events had onset about 30 minutes after 
dosing or generally near T
max, and resolved within minutes or during the 
night.  PK, PD:  
PK data was not yet available for this study  
PD, polysomnogram (PSG) study:  
• The hypothesis that sleep slow wave activity 
(SWA) would increase following dosing with CX-8998 was not supported: SWA decreased 
by 30% after 12 mg of CX- 8998; delayed sleep 
onset and decreased sleep maintenance were also ob served after 12 mg single doses of CX-
8998  
• Results of the PSG study with 4 and 8 mg of 
CX-8998 are not yet available

Childbearing Potential (9 healthy females of non -childbearing potential, 55- 75 years old)  
Design  Single oral doses of 8 mg CX -8998 or placebo, fasted  
 
Summary of 
findings  Safety:  
• Single doses of 8 mg CX -8998 in healthy middle- aged and elderly 
females were generally well tolerated  
• Mild laughter, nervousness, and racing thoughts were observed in 2, 1, 
and 1 subject administered CX -8998, respectively  
One subject receiving CX -8998 had elevated serum alanine aminotran sferase 
(ALT) deemed as possibly drug related by the investigator. This subject's pre-
dose ALT was 28 IU/L and increased to 41 and 59 IU/L at one and 4 days post -
dose, returning to 33 IU/L by two weeks post -dose (normal range: 6 – 40 IU/L). 
All serum aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin 
values were within the normal range for this subject  PK: 
• Tmax = 0.5 hrs

Title  
(population)  A Phase IIa, Randomized, Multicenter, Double -Blind, Active Comparator - and Placebo -Controlled, Clinical Trial to Study the Safety and 
Efficacy of MK -8998 in Acutely Psychotic Patients with Schizophrenia (216 adult males (N=126) and females (N=90) 20- 55 years old)  
Design  CX-8998 (8 mg BID) was compared with olanzapine and with placebo. N=86 randomized to CX -8998, including 49M/37F, 21 -55 years old 
(mean age 37.4 years)  
Summary of 
findings  Safety:  
• The most frequent TEAEs without regard to causality classified by Me dDRA 
System Organ Class (SOC) in the CX- 8998 group were Psychiatric Disorders 
(19/86 [22.1%] CX -8998 vs. 10/83 [12.0%] placebo); Nervous System 
Disorders (10/86 [11.66%] CX -8998 vs 6/83 [7.2%] placebo); and 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (9/86 [10.5%] CX -8998 vs 5/83 [6.0%] placebo). 
Among CX -8998 treated subjects, insomnia was the only TEAE that rose to a 
frequency of ≥ 5% (13/86 [15.1%] vs. 7/83 [8.4%] placebo).  
• No treatment -emergent SAE’s occurred in CX- 8998 treated subjects  
TEAE’s led to treatment disconti nuation in 9/86 (10.5%) of CX -8998 
treated subjects vs. 1/83 (1.2%) placebo treated subjects. Four of the CX -
8998 discontinuations for AE were for worsening or exacerbation of 
schizophrenia, only one of which was assessed by the investigator as 
causally related to CX -8998.  Anti -Psychotic Efficacy:  
• Primary endpoint measure was mean change 
from baseline in the Positive and Negative 
Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at Week 4 
• CX-8998 was not statistically significantly 
different from placebo in the mean change from 
baseline in PANSS total score at Week 4 (Mean changes from baseline: CX -8998, -13.3; 
olanzapine -17.0; placebo - 12.7)  
• For one of the secondary endpoints, responders were defined as those who demonstrated ≥ 20% improvement from baseline on the PANSS total score. CX -8998 was not statistically significantly 
different from placebo in the responder rate after 4 weeks of treatment (responder rates were: CX -
8998, 57.4%; olanzapine, 66.7%; placebo, 48.3%)  
 
Reported safety observations in this table are limited to those that occurred in CX -8998 treated subjects more frequently than in placebo treated 
subjects. Serious adverse events occurring in placebo treated subjects are not included. Complete details of the safety results are contained in the 
latest edition of the CX -8998 Investigator ’s Broch ure.

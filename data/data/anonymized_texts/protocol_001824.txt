Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 2 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 8: RAT IO NALE  
Specific changes in Version 8 of Protocol MO29518 and their rationale are as follows:  
• Appendix 8: updated to include the changes  in the Atezolizumab Investigator’s 
Brochure version 15 (IB v15), including the guidelines for management of immune -
mediated myositis  and for suspected hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or 
macrophage activation syndrome, removed description and management guidelines for 
systemic immune activation, updated terminology changing "immune -related" to 
"immune -mediated"  (and wherever applicable throughout the protocol) . 
• Clarified provisions for post -trial access to atezolizumab to allow for continued 
treatment of patients following last patient last visit (LPLV), and regarding data 
collection during transition to the  extension study . 
• Change in Medical Monitor  and addition of NCT number.  
• Terminology update to align with recent changes in the atezolizumab IB v15 changed "immune -related" to "immune- mediated" . 
Substantive new information appears in italics. This amendment represents cumulative changes to the original protocol.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 3 PROTOCOL AMENDMENT, VERSION 8: 
SUMM ARY OF CHANGES  
 
5.2.3  Non-Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately Reportable 
to the Sponsor)  
Update of Non -Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest ( AESI ) to align with 
Atezolizumab IB v15 and protocols across the Atezolizumab programme, adding AESIs 
identified more recently and minor terminology updates.  
5.1.4  Management of Specific Adverse Events   
Remov al of term,  description and management guidelines for systemic immune 
activation (SIA), and addition of  the terms hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis ( HLH) 
and macrophage activation syndrome ( MAS) as potential risks, together with diagnostic 
criteria and management guidelines for HLH and MAS . 
SIA was defined by the Sponsor  internally as an excessive activation of the immune 
system in the setting of combined immunomodulatory therapies (immune- doublets)  
characterized as systemic inflammation with fever, elevated inflammatory markers  and 
multiple organ dysfunction in the absence of other etiologies. It was considered a clinical  
entity separate from other similar systemic immune entities (HLH ) and (MAS) etc.  As of 
today,  SIA remains a Roche specific term and is not widely used in the medical  
community. It is a potential risk for Atezolizumab. The event is not described in the literature, hence no common definition or established guidelines for SIA exist unlike 
other established entities [HLH, MAS, or cytokine release syndrome (CRS)]. Evolving 
knowledge of safety  profile of checkpoint inhibitors and a recent review of reported SlA 
cases conducted by the Sponsor did not reveal any case that is clearly differentiated 
from other established entities in the spectrum of systemic immune events (e.g. HLH, 
MAS,  CRS). The current guidance in the IB and protocols for Atezolizumab has led to 
cases being reported as SIA (single agent  atezolizumab or in combinations) even though 
meeting the criteria of other immune entities  such as HLH, MAS or CRS.  The IB  version 
15 and amendments of  protocols and ICFs for Atezolizumab remove the term systemic 
immune activation (SIA) , and add the terms HLH and MAS as potential risks, together 
with diagnostic criteria and management guidelines for HLH and MAS . 
5.1.4.1 Systemic Immune Activation  
Systemic immune activation (SIA) is a rare condition characterized by an excessive 
immune response.  Given the mechanism of action of Atezolizumab, SIA is considered a 
potential risk when given with other immunomodulating agents.  SIA should be included 
in the differential diagnosis for patients who, in the absence of an alternative etiology, 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 4 develop a sepsis like syndrome after administration of Atezolizumab, and the initial 
evaluation should include the following:  
• CBC with peripheral smear  
• PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and D dimer  
• Ferritin  
• Triglycerides  
• AST, ALT, and total bilirubin 
• LDH 
• Complete neurologic and abdominal examination (assess for hepatosplenomegaly)  
If SIA is still suspected after the initial evaluation, contact the Medical Monitor for 
additional recommendations and management.  
 
5.3.4  Post -Trial Access to Atezolizumab  
Added language to c larify provisions for post -trial access to atezolizumab to allow for 
continued treatment of patients following LPLV, and regarding data collection during 
transition to the extension study.  
Patients may also take part in an extension study if the patient is still benefiting from treatment (defined as no registered PD) at the time of planned Last Patient Last Visit date. If the extension study is not set -up in time for the patient to roll over by 
the planned protocol LPLV date, nor is there a Post -Trial Access Program available, 
the patient can continue treatment in the study until the extension study is opened at 
the patient’s site. During the interim period between LPLV and a patient rolling over 
to the extension study, only safety data (AE including SAE and AESI) will continue to be collected in the eCRF. Other assessments (e.g. tumor assessment) can be performed as per standard of care. 
 
 
APPENDIX 1: Schedule of Assessments 
Added footnote 24 to clarify assessments  during transition to the extension study  
following LPLV . 
 
During the interim period between LPLV and a patient rolling over to the extension 
study, only safety data (AE including SAE and AESI) will continue to be collected in the eCRF. Other assessments (e.g. tumor assessment) can be performed as per 
standard of care.  
  
APPENDIX 2: Schedule of Anti -Therapeutic Antibody, Pharmacodynamic and 
Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Addition to footnote 2 to clarify sample collection during transition to the extension study  
following LPLV . 
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 5 For patients who discontinue the study treatment, ATA and PK samples are to be 
obtained at 120 days ± 30 days after the last dose of study treatment unless the patient dies or withdraws consent or the study closes (during the interim period between LPLV and a patient rolling over to the extension study, ATA and PK samples do not need to be collected) .  
 
 
APPENDIX 8: Risks Associated with Atezolizumab and Guidelines for Management of Adverse Events Associated with Atezolizumab  
Added guidelines for management  of immune -mediated myositis  and for suspected 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis or macrophage activation syndrome (see rationale 
above) , and updated terminology changing "immune -related" to "immune- mediated" .
 
 
IMMUNE -MEDIATED MYOSITIS  
Immune -mediated myositis has been associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab.  Myositis or inflammatory myopathies are a group of disorders 
sharing the common feature of inflammatory muscle injury; dermatomyositis and 
polymyositis are among the most common disorders. Initial diagnosis is based on 
clinical (muscle weakness, muscle pain, skin rash in dermatomyositis), biochemical 
(serum creatine kinase increase), and imaging (electromyography/MRI) features, 
and is confirmed with a muscle biopsy. 
Patie nts with signs and symptoms of myositis, in the absence of an identified 
alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 13.

• Initiate treatment as per institutional guidelines.  
Immune-mediated myositis, Grade 2 • Withhold atezolizumab for up to 12 weeks after event onset
 a 
and contact Medical Monitor.  
• Refer patient to rheumatologist or neurologist.  
• Initiate treatment as per institutional guidelines.  
• Consider treatment with corticosteroids equivalent to 1
−2 mg/kg/day IV methylprednisolone and convert to 
1−2 mg/kg/day oral prednisone or equivalent upon 
improvement.  
• If corticosteroids are initiated and event does not improve within 48 hours after initiating corticosteroids, consider adding an immunosuppressive agent.  
• If event resolves to Grade 1 or better, resume atezolizumab.
 b 
• If event does not resolve to Grade 1 or better while withholding atezolizumab, permanently discontinue atezolizumab and contact Medical Monitor.
 c 
a Atezolizumab may be withheld for a longer period of time (i.e., > 12 weeks after 
event onset) to allow for corticosteroids (if initiated) to be reduced to the equivalent of 
≤ 10 mg/day oral prednisone.  The acceptable length of the extended period of 
time must be agreed upon by the investigator and the Medical Monitor.  
b If corticosteroids have been initiated, they must be tapered over  ≥ 1 month to the 
equivalent of ≤ 10 mg/day oral prednisone before atezolizumab can be resumed.  
c Resumption of atezolizumab may be considered in patients who are deriving benefit 
and have fully recovered from the immune- mediated event.  Patients can be 
re-challenged with atezolizumab only after approval has been documented by both 
the investigator (or an appropriate delegate) and the Medical Monitor.

Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 8 HEMOPHAGOCYTIC LYMPHOHISTIOCYTOSIS AND MACROPHAGE 
ACTIVATION SYNDROME  
Immune -mediated reactions may involve any organ system and may lead to 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome 
(MAS).   
Patients with suspected HLH should be diagnosed according to published criteria by 
McClain and Eckstein (2014).  A patient should be classified as having HLH if five of the following eight criteria are met: 
• Fever  
≥ 38.5°C  
• Splenomegaly  
• Peripheral blood cytopenia consisting of at least two of the following:  
– Hemoglobin < 90 g/L (9 g/dL) (< 100 g/L [10 g/dL] for infants < 4 weeks old)  
– Platel et count < 100  × 109/L (100,000/ µL) 
– ANC < 1.0  × 109/L (1000/µL) 
• Fasting triglycerides > 2.992 mmol/L (265 mg/dL)  and/or  fibrinogen < 1.5 g/L 
(150 mg/dL)  
• Hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, lymph node, or liver  
• Low or absent natural killer cell activity  
• Ferritin > 500 mg/L (500 ng/mL)  
• Soluble interleukin 2 (IL- 2) receptor (soluble CD25) elevated ≥ 2 standard 
deviations above age- adjusted laboratory -specific norms 
 
Patients with suspected MAS should be diagnosed according to published criteria 
for systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis by Ravelli et al. (2016).  A febrile patient 
should be classified as having MAS if the following criteria are met:  
• Ferritin > 684 mg/L (684 ng/mL)  
• At least two of the following:  
– Platelet count ≤ 181  × 109/L (181,000/ µL) 
– AST ≥ 48 U/L 
– Triglycerides > 1.761 mmol/L (156 mg/dL)  
– Fibrinogen ≤ 3.6 g/L (360 mg/dL)  
 
Patients with suspected HLH or MAS should be treated according to the guidelines 
in Table 14.

In addition, only patients whose tissue is available for biomarker assessment testing will be 
eligible.   
Enrolled patients will receive Atezolizumab at a fixed dose of 1200 mg administered intravenously on the first day of each cycle.  One cycle of therapy will be defined as 21 days 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 22 (± 3 days).  Patients treated with Atezolizumab who have no post -baseline tumor assessment 
(per protocol mandated timelines), and enrolled patients who do not receive any dose of 
Atezolizumab will be replaced.    
Atezolizumab treatment may be continued as long as patients are experiencing clinical benefit, as assessed by an investigator, in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression after an integrated assessment of radiogr aphic 
data, biopsy results (if available) and clinical status . 
Patients will be permitted to continue Atezolizumab treatment after RECIST v1.1 criteria (or 
disease- specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer [Appendix 6] and malignant pleural 
mesot helioma [Appendix 7]) for progressive disease are met if they meet all of  the following 
criteria:  
• Evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by the Investigator  
• Absence of symptoms and signs (including worsening of laboratory values, e.g., new or 
worsening hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease  
• No decline in ECOG performance status that can be attributed to disease progression 
• Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal disease) that 
cannot be managed by protocol -allowed medical interventions  
 
Patients treated with Atezolizumab in whom radiographic disease progression is confirmed at a subsequent tumor assessment may be considered for continued study treatment at the 
discretion of the Investigator if they continue to meet the above criteria.  
If an individual patient continues to experience clinical benefit beyond 2 years of radiologic 
progressive disease, it lies within the discretion of each investigator to continue study treatment 
based on a positive risk benefit assessment by the investigator.  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate Investigator -determined non- progression rate 
(NPR) at 18 weeks in the individual cohorts using RECIST, v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and 
malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease- specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer 
(see Appendix 6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7).  Secondary efficacy 
variables (including ORR, BOR, CBR, DOR, TTP and PFS) will be recorded using RECIST, 
v1. 1, (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease- specific 
criteria for patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7), and modified RECIST  (see Appendix 3)  
Safety will be monitored by assessing AEs, serious AEs (SAEs), AEs of special 
interest  (AESIs), laboratory findings and electrocardiogram.  The National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE, v4.0) will be used 
to quantify the intensity of AEs occurring during treatment.  Incidence, type and severity of AEs, SAEs, incidence of AEs and SAEs leading to Atezolizumab interruption or discontinuation and 
cause of death will be reported.  In addition, to characterize the immunogenic  potential and the 
pharmacokinetic properties of Atezolizumab, blood samples will be taken at various time points 
before and after study treatment administration (see Appendix 2 for a detailed description of the assessments).  
This study will also have an exploratory analysis examining biomarkers. These analyses will be conducted on archival tissue specimens (required for patient inclusion), as well as prospectively -collected plasma/blood samples and freshly obtained tumor specimens.  
Collected samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory for PD -L1 expression, as well as 
other potential markers (e.g. but not limited to protein or genetic markers), to assess relationships between biomarker expression and patient outcomes including, but not limited to, response and disease progression.  
All patients will be monitored for survival for a minimum period of 24 months after the last 
patient has been enrolled in each cohort or until all patients have died, withdrawn consent or are lost to follow up,  or the Sponsor  decides to end the study,  whichever occurs first.   S urvival 
follow -up information will be collected via clinic visits, telephone calls and/or review of patient 
medical records approximately every 3 months from study treatment discontinuation until patient  
death, loss to follow -up, withdrawal of consent or until the study is terminated by the Sponsor.  
Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than disease progression (e.g., 
toxicity) should continue to undergo scheduled tumor assessments approximately every 3 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 23 months until death, disease progression, initiation of further systemic cancer therapy or study 
closure, whichever occurs first.  
Enrollment in this study will be based on Simon's optimal two- stage design (Simon 1989).  
Accordingly, 12 fully -evaluable patients will be enrolled in each cohort in the first stage.  If 3 or 
more of these patients exhibit non- progressive disease at the end of Stage I, then an additional 
13 fully -evaluable patients will be enrolled in Stage II.  Thus, approxim ately 725 patients are 
expected to participate in the study. However, if positive efficacy signals are observed in any of 
the other cohorts that include different tumor types or in a specific subgroup of patients within 
other cohorts  (e.g. biomarker positive subgroup), the Sponsor in discussion with the Steering 
Committee may decide to extend the enrolment of the individual tumor type or subgroup of patients based on methodology explained in the Determination of Sample Size (Section 6.1).  
 
Please refer to the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 1) for a detailed description of the 
assessments to be carried out in this study.  
 
Number of Patients  
Based on Simon’s optimal two- stage design (Simon 1989), approximately 12 to 25 fully 
evaluable patients per individual tumor type will be included.  
Allowing for expansion of cohorts into further sub- cohorts of individual tumor types and possible 
further expansion into subgroups of responders, the projected total number of patients enrolled 
in this study is approximately 725.  However, cohorts may be expanded under certain conditions 
(see Section 6.1).

Length of Study  
The study is expected to last approximately 5 years.  
 
End of Study  
The end of cohort  will occur when all patients have been followed for survival for a minimum of 
24 months after the last patient has been enrolled in the cohort  or until all patients have died, 
withdrawn consent or are lost to follow up, or the Sponsor decides to end the study,  whichever 
occurs first.   
Recruitment/enrollment in any of the cohorts may present some challenges.  Therefore, a permanent stop rule may be applied if the recruitment rate is too low after any  of the individual 
cohorts have been completely enrolled, which could result in stopping further enrolment in some 
of the remaining cohorts  (Section 4.6.3), based on regular review of the recruitment rate After a 
cohort has been opened for at least 4 months, it may be closed early if the recruitment is less than 2 patients per month on average from the opening of the cohort. This decision will be made by the Sponsor. The overall end of study will occur when the end of cohort  has occurred for all 
of the individual cohorts, as described above.

Investigational Medicinal Products  
Test Product (Investigational Drug)  
The dose of Atezolizumab in this study will be 1200 mg (equivalent to an average body weight -
based dose of 15 mg/kg) administered by intravenous infusion every 3 weeks (21 [± 3] days).  
Administration of Atezolizumab will be performed in a setting with emergency medical facil ities 
and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.  
Atezolizumab will be delivered in 250 mL 0.9% NaCl IV infusion bags with product contacting surfaces of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyolefin (PO) and IV infusion lines with product contacting surfaces of PVC or polyethylene (PE) and 0.2 µm in- line filters (filter membrane of 
polyethersulfone [PES]).  No incompatibilities have been observed between Atezolizumab and 
these infusion materials (bags and infusion lines).  
The ini tial dose of Atezolizumab will be delivered over 60 (± 15) minutes.  If the first infusion is 
tolerated without infusion- associated adverse events, the second infusion may be delivered 
over 30 (± 10) minutes.  If the 30- minute infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may 
be delivered over 30 (± 10) minutes.  
For first infusion of study treatment, the patient’s vital signs must be determined within 
60 minutes before the infusion; during, and after the infusion if clinically indicated.  For 
subsequent infusions, vital signs will be collected within 60 minutes before infusion and at the 
end of the infusion, if clinically indicated.  
Patients will be informed about the possibility of delayed post -infusion symptoms and instructed 
to contact their  study physician if they develop such symptoms.  
No premedication will be allowed for the first dose of Atezolizumab. Premedication may be 
administered for Cycles  ≥ 2 at the discretion of the treating physician.  The management of 
infusion- related reactions  will be according to severity as described in section 5.1.4.  
 
For anaphylaxis precautions, see Appendix 4.  
Guidelines for dosage modification, treatment interruption or discontinuation and the management of specific adverse events are provided in Sections  5.1.3 and in the Atezolizumab

Statistical Methods  
Primary Analysis  
The primary analysis will be based on NPR at 18 Weeks for each cohort, as assessed by the 
Investigator using RECIST, v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural 
mesothelioma) and disease- specific criteria for  patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) 
and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7).  This endpoint will be assessed at Stage 
I and Stage II.  
At the conclusion of this study, Atezolizumab will be declared effective or ineffective for each 
cohort based on rules for Stage II.  
The final analysis for each cohort will take place when all patients in that cohort have been 
followed for survival for a minimum of 24 months after the last patient has been enrolled or until 
all patients have died, withdrawn consent or are lost to follow up, or if the cohort is stopped due to safety or efficacy reasons  or the Sponsor decides to end the cohort, whichever occurs first.  
Hypothesis Testing 
A Simon optimal two- stage design will be used to test whether Atezolizumab yields a NPR that 
is of clinical interest.  In this Phase II study, an NPR of 20% is a level of activity that is not of 
interest for further clinical development, whereas an NPR of 40% is of clinical interest.  
The study hypotheses are:  
• H 0: π  ≤ π 0 
• H 1: π > π 1 
 Where π
0 = 20% and the assumed NPR under the alternative is π 1 = 40%.  
The type I error will be 10% and the study will have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis 
when the true NPR is 40%.  
The hypothesis and clinical assumptions will be applied to all cohorts separately.  
 
Determination of Sample Size   
The sample size for this phase II study is based on Simon’s optimal two- stage design (Simon 
1989).  
In this Phase II study, an NPR of 20% is a level of activity that is not of interest for further 
clinical development, whereas an NPR of 40% is of clinical interest.  The type I error will be 10% and the study will have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis when the true NPR is 40%.  
The Simon design in this study requires 12 fully evaluable patients for the first stage.  If at the end of the first stage there are 0, 1 or 2 patients with non- progressive disease at Week 18, the 
enrollment into this cohort will be terminated (or the cohort may be expanded as described 
below).  Otherwise, if more than 2 patients with non- progressive disease are observed at the 
end of Stage I, an additional 13 fully -evaluable patients may  be enrolled into Stage II.  The 
study drug will be considered of clinical interest in this cohort if, at the end of the second stage, 
there are 8 or more patients with non- progressive disease out of 25 total fully -evaluable patients.  
It can be assumed that some patients will not be evaluable for NPR.  A patient will be considered evaluable for NPR if they received study drug, have a baseline tumor assessment and at least one tumor assessment post -baseline- (per protocol mandated timelines).  Thus, 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 31 more than 25 patients may be needed to be enrolled per cohort to obtain 25 fully -evaluable 
patients.  
The hypotheses and clinical assumptions will be applied to all cohorts individually.  
Statistical analyses will be based on patients with the same individual tumor type and may be 
based on pre- defined cohorts or on sub- cohorts.  
Allowing for expansion of cohorts into further sub- cohorts of individual tumor types and possible 
further expansion into subgroups of responders, the projected total number of patients enrolled in this study is approximately 725 (see Figure 2).   
If a clear clinical benefit has been observed for a defined subgroup of patients at the end of 
Stage I within a cohort that did not meet the criteria for continuation (as described in Section 6.2.1), then enrolment into Stage II might still be allowed in this cohort for this specific subgroup after discussion with the Sponsor and the study Steering Committee. Similarly, if a clear clinical 
benefit has been observed for a defined subgroup of patients at the end of Stage II within a 
cohort that did not meet the criteria for success (as described in Section 6.2.2), then enrolment into Stage II might continue in this cohort for this specific subgroup after discussion with the Sponsor and the study Steering Committee.

1.1 BACKGROUND ON ADVANCED SOLID TUMORS  
This study will assess the efficacy and safety of the anti -PD-L1 therapeutic antibody 
Atezolizumab for the treatment of a diverse array of advanced solid tumors.  The tumors 
were selected based on the characteristics of their pathology that suggest a potential 
susceptibility to immunotherapy with Atezolizumab.  Specifically, the tumors were chosen based on their potential for high immunogenicity, and on published evidence 
linking P D-L1 expression to pathogenesis.  
The tumors included in this study, as well as a brief description of their epidemiology and prognoses, are presented in Table  1. Full details of the histological types / subtypes and 
marker s mandated for each cohort are described in Section 4.1.3 .

tissue and visceral sarcoma is 3.8 per 100,000 and the mortality rate is 1.5 per 100,000. The incidence of bone sarcoma is 0.9 per 100,000 and mortality is 0.4 per 100,000 
• About 12,020 new soft tissue and visceral sarcomas and about 2,300 new cases of bone sarcoma were diagnosed in the US in 2014 and about 4,740 and 1,500 people died from  soft tissue and bone sarcomas, respectively  
• Approximately half of all patients with intermediate or high-grade tumors develop metastatic disease requiring systemic treatment.  The 5- year survival rate is around 10% for soft 
tissue sarcoma ( STS) that have metastasized.  After failure 
of first -line treatment the estimated 6- month progression- free 
survival rate is only 14% for agents deemed to be active in sarcoma 
• The 5- year survival rate for osteosarcoma with unresectable 
disease is between 7% and 19%. For chondrosarcoma the 5-year survival is 89% for grade 1 and 53% for combined

Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 43 1.2 BACKGROUND ON ATEZOL IZUM AB  
Atezolizumab is a phage- derived human immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 monoclonal antibody 
consisting of two heavy chains (448 amino acids) and two light chains (214 amino acids).  
Atezolizumab was engineered to eliminate Fc -effector function via a single amino acid 
substitution (asparagine to alanine) at position 298 on the heavy chain, which results in a 
non-glycosylated heavy chain that has minimal binding to Fc receptors and prevents Fc -
effector function at expected concentrations and eliminates the potential for antibody -
dependent cell -mediated cytotoxicity.  Atezolizumab targets human PD -L1 and inhibits 
its interaction with its receptors, programmed death−1 (PD -1) and B7.1 (CD80, B7- 1).  
Both of these interactions are reported to provide inhibitory signals to T cells.  
Atezolizumab is being investigated as a potential therapy against  solid tumors and 
hematologic malignancies in humans.  
1.2.1  Nonclinical Studies  
The safety, pharmacokinetic (PK) and toxicokinetics of Atezolizumab were investigated 
in mice and cynomolgus monkeys to support intravenous (IV) administration and to aid 
in predicti ng the appropriate starting dose in humans.  Given the similar binding of 
Atezolizumab for cynomolgus monkey and human PD -L1, the cynomolgus monkey was 
selected as the primary and relevant nonclinical model for understanding the safety, PK 
and toxicokinetics of Atezolizumab.  
Overall, the nonclinical pharmacokinetics and toxicokinetics observed for Atezolizumab 
supported entry into clinical studies, including providing adequate safety factors for the 
proposed Phase I starting doses.  The results of the toxicology program were consistent 
with the anticipated pharmacologic activity of down- modulating the PD -L1/PD -1 pathway 
and supported entry into clinical trials in patients.  
Please refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on the nonclinical studies.  
1.2.2  Ongoing Clinical Studies  
Atezolizumab is currently being tested in multiple Phase I, II and III studies, both as 
monotherapy and in combination with several anti -cancer therapies (see the 
Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for study descriptions).  Much of the safety and 
efficacy data summarized below are from the Phase Ia Study PCD4989g, a multicenter, first-in-human, open -label, dose -escalation trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, 
immunogenicity, pharmacokinetics, exploratory pharmacodynamics and preliminary evidence of biologic activity of Atezolizumab administered as a single agent by IV infusion every 3 weeks (q3w) to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies or hematologic malignancies.  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 44 1.2.3  Clinical Safety  
As of t he cutoff date for the Investigator ’s Brochure version 9, Atezolizumab, (August 
2016) has been administered to approximately 6053 patients with solid tumors and 
hematologic  malignancies.   
Safety information for Atezolizumab is also gleaned from studies in the entire 
development program, including those where Atezolizumab is investigated in 
combination with other unapproved agents.  
Study PCD4989g, in which Atezolizumab is being used as a single agent in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors or hematologic malignancies, provides the majority of data (with 558 safety evaluable patients as of the data extraction date of 11 May 2015)  for the safety profile of Atezolizumab as monotherapy. Currently, no 
maximum tolerated dose, no dose- limiting t oxicities and no clear dose- related trends in 
the incidence of AEs have been determined. Fatigue, decreased appetite, nausea and cough were commonly reported adverse events in single and combination therapy. The overall immune- mediated adverse events reported for Atezolizumab were considered 
moderate in severity and majority of patients were able to continue on Atezolizumab therapy.  
A dverse Events  
In PCD4989g of the 558 safety evaluable treated patients 376 patients (67.4%) reported at least one treatment -related adverse event, Grade 3 - 4 AEs were reported in 239 
patients (42.8%) of which 66 (11.8%) were considered related. Grade 3 and 4 AEs 
considered related by the investigator included dyspnea, pneumonitis, increased alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT), increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST), increased gamma -glutamyl transferase (GGT), lymphocyte count decreased, cardiac tamponade, 
asthenia, autoimmune hepatitis, pneumonia, influenza, and hypoxia. More detailed 
information is provided in the latest version of the IB.  
Immune -mediated A dverse Events  
Given the mechanism of action of Atezolizumab, events associated with inflammation 
and/or immune- mediated adverse events have been closely monitored during the 
Atezolizumab clinical program.  These include potential dermatologic, hepatic, endocrine 
and respiratory events.  Events of immune- related hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, 
pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, 
hypophysitis,  Guillain -Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome  / myasthenia gravis, 
meningoencephalitis and infusion -related reactions  are considered adverse drug 
reactions associated with Atezolizumab.  
Please refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for details regarding immune-mediated adverse events observed in patients treated with Atezolizumab.

1.2.4.1  Study PCD4989g  
Anti-tumor activity, including Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 
(RECIST)−based responses (i.e., RECIST v1.1 responses), have been observed in 
patients with different tumor types treated with Atezolizumab monotherapy in 
Study  PCD4989g.  
Among 345 evaluable patients treated by 21 October 2013 (data cutoff of 21 April 2014) 
with a median 30.4 weeks of follow -up, 62 experienced objective responses per RECIST 
v1.1 at an ORR of 18% (95% CI: 14.1%−22.3%).  Objective responses with 
Atezolizumab monotherapy were observed in a broad range of malignancies including NSCLC, RCC, melanoma, bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and sarcoma.  The majority of the responses have been 
durable, with a median DOR of 77.6 weeks (range: 6.4+ to 97.9+ weeks, where “+” 
denotes a censored value); 72.6% (45 of 62 patients) of these responses were ongoing as of the clinical cutoff date.  
Please refer to the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for details on clinical activity in 
all patients treated to date regardless of tumor type.  
NSCLC 
As of the 21 April 2014 cutoff, 88 patients with NSCLC who enrolled into Study  PCD4989g and received their first dose of Atezolizumab by 21 October 2013 were 
evaluable for efficacy.  The median age was 60.5 years.  The group represented a heavily pre- treated patient population in that 84.1% of the patients had received ≥ 2 prior 
systemic therapies.  Patients had a median duration of follow -up of 36.1 weeks.  
RECIST responses (confirmed) were observed in a total of 18 patients, inclusive of 
squamous and non- squamous histologies, and across all treatment cohorts (treatment 
dose levels of 1 to 20 mg/kg).  
Prelimin ary results suggest that PD -L1 expression in tumor tissue is likely to be 
associated with response to Atezolizumab.  A prototype IHC assay was used to measure 
specific PD -L1 signals in TCs and ICs.  PD -L1 staining categories in TCs were defined 
as TC0, TC1, TC2, and TC3, and in ICs were defined as IC0, IC1, IC2, and IC3.  Of note, 
an ORR of 50% (11 of 22 patients, 95% CI: 28.2%− 71.8%) and an ORR of 31.6% (12 of 
38, 95% CI: 17.5%−48.6%) were observed in patients whose tumors were characterized by high level s of PD -L1 staining in TCs or ICs (TC3 or IC3 group and TC3 or IC2/3 group, 
respectively) compared with an ORR of 12.1% (7 of 58 patients, 95% CI: 5.7%−22.5%) 
in patients with low or no PD -L1 staining in TCs and ICs (TC0/1/2 and IC0/1/2 group) 
(Table 2).  
As of the data cutoff of 21 April 2014, 11 of the 18 responding patients have continued to 
respond after 13.0+ weeks to 97.9+ weeks.  The median DOR is 66.9 weeks.  See the

Urothelial Bladder Cancer  
As of the clinical cut -off date of 21 April 2014,  efficacy analyses had been performed on 
70 patients (33 IHC 2/3, 36 IHC 0/1 and 1 unknown) with locally -advanced or metastatic 
urothelial bladder cancer (UBC) (all patients were dosed by 27 January 2014 and had a 
minimum of 12 weeks of follow -up).  In these 70 patients, the median age was 65 years 
(range: 36−89 years).  Sixty -four patients (91%) had received prior platinum -based 
chemotherapy.  The majority of patients had at least one or more poor prognostic features (i.e., hemoglobin < 10 g/dL, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] performance status [PS] ≥ 1, liver involvement) at baseline, with 52 patients (74%) 
having visceral metastases.  
Among the 33 efficacy -evaluable IHC 2/3 patients, median follow -up was 6 months 
(range: 1+ – 12 months).  The investigator -assessed ORR (unconfirmed) per Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 [RECIST, v1.1]) was 52% (95% CI: 34%, 
69%), with 3 complete responses (CRs) ( Table  5).  Among the 36 efficacy -evaluable I HC 
0/1 patients, median follow -up was 4 months (range: 1+ to 7 months).  The ORR was 14%

69 patients with RCC (all patients were dosed by 21 October 2013).  In these 69 patients, 
the median age was 61 years (range: 33−81 years).  Sixty patients (87%) had received prior systemic therapies, including cytokine -based therapies  (39%), tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors (58%) and mTOR inhibitors (25%).  Eighteen patients (26%) were in the Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) poor risk stratification group, while 
71%, 23%, 35% and 4% of patients at enrolment had metastases in the lung, liver, bone and brain, respectivel y.  
Among the 69 efficacy -evaluable patients, the median follow -up was 239 days (range: 
21 to 834 days).  The investigator -assessed ORR (confirmed) per RECIST, v1.1, was 15% 
(95% CI: 8%, 25%), including 1 CR.  The ORRs in the IHC 1/2/3 and IHC 0 groups wer e 
20% (95% CI: 9%, 37%) and 10% (95% CI: 2%, 30%), respectively.  The PFS was 24 weeks (range: 5 to 98+ weeks), with a 24- week PFS rate of 51% (95% CI: 38%, 63%).  
The ORR for Fuhrman Grade 4 or sarcomatoid clear cell RCC (n=18) was 22% (95% CI: 8%, 47%).   
Further analysis indicated that higher response rates were observed in MSKCC poor -risk 
patients with PD -L1 IHC 1/2/3 expression ( Table 4).

1.2.4.2  Study GP28328 
Study GP28328 is an ongoing Phase Ib study evaluating the safety and pharmacology of 
Atezolizumab administered with bevacizumab alone (Arm A) or with bevacizumab plus folinic acid/fluorouracil/oxaliplatin (FOLFOX) (Arm B) in patients with advanced solid tumors.  As of the clinical cut -off date of 7 July 2014,  35 patients had enrolled in Arm  A 
and 36 had enrolled in Arm  B (safety -evaluable population).  Sixty percent of patients in 
Arm A and 22% of patients in Arm  B had received ≥  3 prior systemic regimens.   
Responses in the RCC and CRC cohorts are shown in Table 5.

(1/1 PR).  In Arm B, responses were also observed in RCC (1/1 CR) and breast cancer 
(1/2 PR).  
1.2.5  Clinical Pharmacokinetics  
On the basis of available preliminary PK data (0.03−20 mg/kg), Atezolizumab appeared to show linear pharmacokineti cs at doses ≥ 1 mg/kg.  For the 1- mg/kg and 20- mg/kg 
dose groups, the mean apparent clearance (CL) and the mean volume of distribution at 
steady state (Vss) had a range of 3.11 to 4.14 mL/kg and 48.1 to 67.0 mL/kg, 
respectively, which is consistent with th e expected profile of an IgG1 antibody in humans.  
The development of anti -therapeutic antibodies (ATAs) has been observed in patients in 
all dose cohorts and was associated with changes in pharmacokinetics for some patients in the lower dose cohorts (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg).  The development of detectable ATAs has not had a significant impact on pharmacokinetics for doses from 10 to 20 mg/kg.  Patients dosed at the 10- , 15-, and 20- mg/kg dose levels have maintained the expected 
target trough levels of drug despite the detection of ATAs.  To date, no clear relationship between detection of ATAs and adverse events or infusion reactions has been observed.  
See the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for additional details on clinical pharmacokinetics.  
1.3 STUDY RATIONALE AND BENEFI T-RISK ASSESSMENT  
1.3.1  Rationale  
Encouraging clinical data emerging in the field of tumor immunotherapy have demonstrated that therapies focused on enhancing T -cell responses against cancer can 
result in a significant survival benefit in patients with advanced malignancies ( Hodi et al. 
2010; Kantoff et al. 2010; Chen et al. 2012). 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 50 PD-L1 is an extracellular protein that down- regulates immune responses primarily in 
peripheral tissues through binding to its two receptors PD -1 and B7.1.  Many human 
tumors have been found to overexpress PD -L1, which acts to suppress anti -tumor 
immunity.  PD -1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells following T -cell activation, 
which is sustained in states of chronic stimulation such as in chronic infection or cancer 
(Blank et al. 2005; Keir et al. 2008) .  Ligation of PD -L1 with PD -1 inhibits T -cell 
proliferation, cytokine production and cytolytic activity, leading to the functional inactivation or exhaustion of T cells.  B7.1 is a molecule expressed on antigen-
presenting cells and activated T cells.  PD -L1 binding to B7.1 on T cells and antigen-
presenting cells can mediate down- regulation of immune responses, including inhibition 
of T-cell activation and cytokine production ( Butte et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2011). 
Over expression of PD -L1 on tumor cells has been reported to impede anti -tumor 
immunity, resulting in immune evasion ( Blank and Mackensen 2007 ).  Therefore, 
interruption of the PD -L1/PD -1 pathway represents an attractive strategy to reinvigorate 
tumor -specific T -cell immunity.  
Targeting the PD -L1 pathway with Atezolizumab has demonstrated activity in patients 
with advanced malignancies in patients who have failed standard of care therapies.  In the PCD4989g Phase Ia dose- escalation and expansion study of 345 evaluable patients 
treated by 21 October 2013 (data cutoff of 21 April 2014) with a median 30.4 weeks of 
follow -up, 62 patients experienced objective responses per RECIST, v1.1, at an ORR of 
18% (95% CI: 14.1%−22.3%).  Objective responses with Atezolizumab monotherapy 
were observed in a broad range of malignancies including NSCLC, RCC, melanoma, 
bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, and sarcoma.  The median DOR was 77.6 weeks (range: 6.4+ to 97.9+ weeks, where “+ ” denotes a censored value). The majority of these responses have been durable, with 
72.6% (45 of 62) of responses ongoing as of the clinical cutoff date.  
Preliminary results from the Phase Ia Study PCD4989g suggest that PD -L1 expression 
in tumor tissue is likely to be associated with response to Atezolizumab.  A prototype 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay was used to measure specific PD -L1 signals in 
tumor cells (TCs) and tumor -filtrating immune cells (ICs).  
The basic approach of the study will  be to examine the efficacy and safety of 
Atezolizumab patients with different advanced solid tumors.  The cancer subtypes were 
chosen based on input from academic experts and relevant published literature.  Two 
types of evidence were considered to be particularly relevant in the choice:  
1. Does evidence exist that the tumor is immunogenic?  Two basic categories of tumor 
antigens are thought to trigger anticancer immune surveillance: abnormal self 
antigens (ASAs), and tumor -specific antigens (TSAs) ( Schreiber et al. 2010) .  ASAs 
are generated in a variety of ways, including induction of embryonal and developmental genes not normally expressed in adult tissues, expression of normal 
proteins with abnormal sugar moieties or expression of self proteins at abnormally 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 51 high levels.  TSAs result from spontaneous somatic mutations or breaks in germline 
DNA that lead to missense mutations,  frameshift errors or fusion proteins.  Thus, 
advanced solid tumors having potentially high levels of ASAs and/or TSAs were considered to be suitable for inclusion in this study.  A high level of tumor -infiltrating 
lymphocytes was also used as evidence of inherent immunogenicity, as it indicates a tumor microenvironment permissive for leukocyte trafficking and extravasation.  
2. Does evidence exist that the PD -L1 checkpoint may play a role in the development 
of the tumor?  Thus, tumors that have been shown in published reports to express 
PD-L1 in vivo were considered for inclusion in the study.  This evidence was 
considered to be especially relevant if evidence also existed that the level of PD -L1 
expression correlated with cancer grade and/or prognosis, implying a direct role for 
the PD -L1 pathway in tumor immunity.  
 
Based on these considerations, as well as other tumor -specific issues that might suggest 
potential activity for Atezolizumab (see below), the solid cancers described in the 
following sections were chosen for study.  
1.3.1.1  Cervical Cancer  
A key step in an antitumor immune response is the production and recognition of ASAs and TSAs that are recognized by lymphocytes as foreign (non- self).  Breaking 
self-tolerance is not as great of an obstacle for virally -induced cancers because viral 
antigens are inherently non- self, and virally -induced cancers are thus potentially highly 
immunogenic (Schreiber et al. 2010) .   
Human papilloma virus (HPV) is detected in 99% of cervical tumors, in particular oncogenic subtypes such as HPV 16 and 18 ( Colombo et al. 2012) .  In addition, cervical 
cancer progression is associated with deregulated viral gene expression, which leads to 
(among other things) deficient DNA repair and the accumulation of genetic damage i n 
the infected cell, both of which may increase the levels of TSAs ( Doorbar et al. 2012). 
Evidence in the literature also suggests that PD -L1-mediated immune checkpoints may 
play a role in cervical cancer progression.  PD -L1 was found to be expressed on tumor 
cells in 19% to 29% of patients with cervical cancer ( Karim et al. 2009; Grosso et al. 
2013) .  PD -L1 expression on cervical T cells and dendritic cells, respectively, correlated 
positively with increasing grade ( Yang et al. 2013) and inversely with spontaneous 
regression (Kojima et al. 2013). 
1.3.1.2  Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma  
As with cervical cancer, nasopharyngeal  carcinoma is highly associated with viral 
infection, in this case Epstein- Barr virus (EBV), and thus has the potential to be highly 
immunogenic.  In one study, plasma EBV was detectable before treatment in 94 of 99 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, but not in 40 healthy controls or 20 cured 
patients (Lin et al. 2004) .  Median plasma EBV levels also correlated with disease stage.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 52 Consistent with a role for immune checkpoints in the disease, PD -L1 was expressed on 
tumor cells in 68% to 100% of patients ( Hsu et al. 2010; Yang et al. 2011) .  PD -L1 has 
also been shown to be highly expressed on tumor -infiltrating macrophages in patients 
with nasopharyngeal carcinoma ( Chen et al. 2013) .  Finally, hi gher expression rate of 
PD-1 in intratumoral CD8+ T cells significantly correlated with poorer OS, disease- free 
survival and locoregional recurrence- free survival ( Hsu et al. 2010).  
1.3.1.3  MSI-H or MMR-Deficient Colorectal Cancer  
In MSI- H colorectal cancer, the accumulation of errors in microsatellites that reside in 
gene exons leads to the generation of a large number of abnormal peptides due to 
frameshift mutations: the so-called "mutator phenotype" ( Bodmer et al. 1994) .  Such an 
array of abnormal peptides represents a pool of potential TSAs that render MSI -H 
tumors inherently more detectable by the host immune system.  In fact, epitope mapping based on results of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) estimated that approximately 7 TSAs are generated on average in individual colorectal tumors with appropriate anchor 
residues for MHC loading ( Segal et al. 2008) .   
Consistent with potentially high immunogenicity, MSI -H colorectal cancer is associated 
with high numbers of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes and a Crohn- like host response 
(Hutchins et al. 2011) .  PD -L1 immune checkpoint regulation has also been directly 
implicated in CRC pathogenesis.  Thus, PD -L1 was expressed on tumor cells in 53% of 
patients with colon adenocarcinoma ( Dong et al. 2002) .  A case report has been 
published describing a patient with PD -L1-positive MSI -H colorectal cancer who 
exhibited a long- term response with the anti -PD-1 antibody BMS -936558 (Lipson et al. 
2013).   Finally, the anti -PD-L1 antibody Atezolizumab demonstrated preliminary activity 
against colorectal cancer in Study PCD4989g as a single agent and in Study GP28328 in combination with bevacizumab ± FOLFOX ( Secti on 1.2.4 ). 
1.3.1.4  BRCA 1/2 Mutated Cancers 
The BRCA 1/2 gene products play a central role in another DNA repair pathway, double-
strand break repair (DSBR) ( O'Donovan and Livingston 2010 ).  While not as mutagenic 
as mismatch -repair mutants (see previous section), DSBR mutants do exhibit some 
incre ase in mutator activity, as well as a dramatic rise in genomic instability.  This implies 
that BRCA 1/2 tumors may have high frequencies of induced TSAs ( Schreiber et al. 
2010) .  Consistent with this, it has been estimated that breast cancers accumulate on 
average 10 novel and unique TSAs ( Segal et al. 2008) .  Furthermore, extensive tumor 
infiltration by cytotoxic CD8+ T cells was strongly associated with patient survival and 
response to therapy ( Salgado et al. 2014) .  Thus, growth of these tumors may require a 
bypass of normal tumor immunity.  
Evidence in the literature also suggests that PD -L1-mediated immune checkpoints may 
play a role in cancers commonly associated with BRCA 1/2 mutations.  In one case 
series study ( Ghebeh et al. 2006) , PD-L1 was expressed in 22 of 44 breast cancer 
patients in both epithelial cells and tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes.  Intra- tumor 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 53 expression of PD -L1 was significantly associated with histologic grade, while expression 
of PD-L1 in tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes was associated with large tumor size and 
histologic grade.  In another case series study, PD -L1 was expressed in 152 (23.4%) of 
650 breast cancer specimens; PD -L1 expression was associated with a significantly 
worse  OS (Muenst et al. 2014) .    
In patients with ovarian cancer, higher expression of PD -L1 on tumor cells correlated 
with a significantly poorer prognosis than lower expression, while a significant inverse 
correlation was observed between PD -L1 expression and the intraepithelial CD8+ T 
lymphocyte count ( Hamanishi et al.  2007) .  Ovarian cancer -infiltrating dendritic cells 
progressively expressed increased levels of PD -L1 over time.  Accumulation of PD -L1 in 
the tumor was associated with suppression of T cell activity and decreased infiltrating T cells in advancing tumors (Krempski et al. 2011) .  Finally, in a Phase I dose- escalation 
study of 207 patients treated with the anti -PD-L1 antibody BMS -936559,  a response rate 
of 6% was observed in patients with ovarian cancer ( Brahmer et al. 2012) .  
1.3.1.5  Soft Tissue, Visceral and Bone Sarcomas  
Adult soft tissue sarcoma (STS) and bone and joint sarcoma (BS) constitute a rare group of heterogeneous mesenchymal cancers originating from connective tissue.  There are 
multiple histological subtypes of STS and BS.  
Soft-tissue sarcoma comprises a generally aggressive set of diseases characterized by 
multiple histological subtypes generally categorized according to the normal tissue they mimic and the most common types are malignant fibrous histiocytoma, liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma.  Genomic profiling indicates that many soft tissue sarcomas contain translocations, mutations, amplifications or other more complex and chaotic karyotypes 
(Maki 2001; Linch et al. 2014) .  Consequently, this broad class of tumors may be rich 
sources of TSAs, implying a bypass of tumor immunity may be necessary for 
progression.   Moreover, dendritic cells have been shown to induce an effective antitumor 
immune response in both animal models and human sarcoma trials, suggesting that 
boosting immune responses may have therapeutic value in this setting ( Indelicato and 
Finkelstein 2012). 
Radiation induced sarcomas (RIS) are well -characterized and constitute about 3% of all 
sarcomas.  They are more aggressive than other sarcomas.  One of the most significant 
effects of radiation therapy on normal tissues is mutagenesis and genomic instability which is the basis for radiation- induced malignancies.  A high frequency of MYC 
amplifications has been described in radiation -induced  angiosarcomas, but not in 
primary angiosarcomas and other somatic mutations have been described.  Many tumors that respond to PD -1/PD -L1 inhibitors are those with a high mutation load or that 
are commonly associated with mutations.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 54 The most common types of bone sarcoma are osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma. 
PD-L1 expression in osteosarcoma has been described as 36% in 161 patients with 
osteosarcoma ( Raj et al. 2014).  
Evide nce that PD -L1 specifically plays a role in inhibiting immune surveillance in soft 
tissue sarcoma comes from the observation that the protein was expressed on tumor cells in 58% of patients with the disease ( Kim et al. 2013) .  Moreover, PD -L1 expression 
was significantly associated with higher clinical stage, presence of distant metastasis, 
higher histological grade, poor differentiation of tumor and tumor necrosis, suggesting 
the protein is playing an active role in inducing immune checkpoints ( Kim et al. 2013) .  
1.3.1.6  Mesothelioma  
Chronic exposure to asbestos, a Group I carcinogen, induces genetic alterations in lung epithelial cells via at least two known mechanisms: direct DNA damage, and mutagenic 
asbestos -driven escape from apoptosis ( Otsuki et al. 2007) .  The resulting genetic 
alterations are thought to drive the development of malignant mesothelioma.  The same 
process might be expected to result in an increased rate of TSA production, as well, making mesothelioma a potentially good target for immunotherapeutic approaches.  
Many of the epidemiologic associations pertaining to malignant pleural mesothelioma apply to malignant mesothelioma arising in the peritoneum.  There are, however, several important site- specific differences in the demographic features, genetics, and distribution 
of histological subtypes between mesotheliomas arising in the pleural and peritoneal cavities that suggest fundamental biological disparities between tumors at these sites (Husain et al. 2013).  Due to differences in biology and prognosis, two different cohorts 
have been implemented in this study: pleural mesothelioma and peritoneal 
mesothelioma.  
Evidence that mesothelioma tumors are indeed immunogenic comes from studies demonstrating high levels of immune cell infiltration in mesothelioma tumors ( Gregoire 
2010) .  However, the relative levels of lymphocyte subtypes, as well as the cytokine 
levels, indicate that the immune infiltrate is in a relatively tolerogenic state ( Hegmans et 
al. 2006; Gregoire 2010 ), i.e., that immune checkpoints may be required for 
tumorigenesis.  PD -L1 may play a role in forming this tolerogenic state, as the protein 
has been found to be highly expressed on mesothelioma tumor cells and within the 
tumor stroma ( Currie et al. 2009). 
1.3.1.7  Cholangiocarcinoma/Cancer of the Biliary Tract  
Long established risk factors for cholangiocarcinoma include hepatobiliary flukes, primary sclerosing cholangitis, biliary tract cysts, hepatolithiasis and toxins ( Bridgewater 
et al. 2014) .  All of these etiologic  factors are thought to lead to a chronic state of biliary 
inflammation and increased cellular turnover ( Bridgewater et al. 2014) .  The chronic 
inflammation might be expected to down- regulate immune responses via immune 
checkpoint mechanisms, which in turn might help to promote carcinogenesis.   
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 55 Several published studies support this model.  For instance, resting human 
cholangiocytes in culture have been shown to induce PD -L1 protein expression following 
administration of interferon- gamma, which is known to be up- regulated in many tumor 
microenvironments (Gong et al. 2009) .  Expression of PD -L1 was also up- regulated in 
cholangiocarcinoma tissues compared with adjacent tissues ( Ye et al. 2009) .  Tumor -
related PD -L1 expression was significantly correlated with both tumor differentiation and 
stage and was inversely correlated with CD8+ tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes.  
1.3.1.8  Thyroid Cancer  
There are 4 types of thyroid cancers – papillary, follicular, medullar and anaplastic. 
Papillary and follicular  thyroid cancers are usually considered together as differentiated 
thyroid cancer.  
Most patients with differentiated thyroid cancer will evolve favorably with current therapy, 
which mostly includes surgery and radio- iodine treatment; however, 10– 30% will p resent 
recurrent disease and may metastasize.  Medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) usually 
presents low chemosensitivity and radiosensitivity and does not concentrate iodine.  
1.3.1.8.1  Anaplastic thyroid cancer  
Anaplastic thyroid cancer, one of the most aggressive human tumors, is characterized by multiple genetic mutations and chromosomal aberrations ( Smallridge et al. 2009) . 
DNA copy number changes were found in 11 out of the 13 patients with anaplastic thyroid cancer; gains were noted in 10 out of the 13, deletions in 3 out of the 13, both gains and deletions in two, and chromosome deletion in one ( Hemmer et al. 1999) .  This 
high degree of genetic heterogeneity might be expected to associate with high numbers 
of TSAs , but the highly aggressive course indicates that the immune system is 
nonetheless unable to check the uncontrolled growth.   
The inability of the immune system to slow anaplastic thyroid cancer might be 
attributable, at least in part, to the PD -L1/PD -1 pathway and is supported by several 
observations.  First, in a study of 407 thyroid nodule tissue samples, including 293 differentiated thyroid carcinoma samples, malignant tissues displayed more intense PD -
L1 staining levels than benign tissues (both p<0.0001) ( Cunha et al. 2013) .  Second, 
elevated levels of PD -L1 protein were associated with the presence of CD4+ and CD8+, 
lymphocytes (p<0.05); tumor -associated macrophages (P<0.0001); and the presence of 
myeloid -derived suppressor cells (P=0.03256) ( Cunha et al. 2013) .  Finally, Stage II –IV 
thyroid cancer patients presented with higher PD -L1 mRNA levels than stage I cases 
(p=0.03522) (Cunha et al. 2013). 
1.3.1.8.2  Follicular and papillary thyroid cancers  
Associations between inflammation and differentiated thyroid cancers have been reported and evidenced by a mixture of immune cells frequently found within, inside, or even surrounding primary thyroid tumors ( Ward et al. 2014).  In papillary thyroid cancer, 
PD-L1 expression correlates with a greater risk of recurrence, poorer prognosis and 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 56 shortened disease free survival ( Chowdh ury et al, 2016).  Preliminary results of a study 
of pembrolizumab in a cohort of 22 patients with advanced papillary or follicular thyroid 
cancer, who failed standard therapy, reported 2 partial responses and a stable disease rate of 54.5%  (Mehnert et al, 2016). 
1.3.1.8.3  Medullary thyroid cancer and mixed medullary and follicular or 
papillary carcinoma  
Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC), arising from parafol licular, calcitonin -producing C 
cells, represents an aggressive, usually slow -growing tumor occurring in both sporadic 
and familial forms.  Sporadic MTC harbors RET gene somatic mutations in up to 50% of 
cases, and RAS  family gene mutations occur in about 10%.  
The immune system has been shown to play a role in MTC as evidenced by an increase of FoxP3+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood of patients with MTC, which correlated with prognosis ( Ward et al, 2014).  
1.3.1.9  Gastric Adenocarcinoma/Adenocarcinoma of the Gastro -
Esophageal Junction 
Infection with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori), a type of bacterium found in the stomach of about two- thirds of the world’s population, is a major cause of gastric cancer.  A 2001 
combined analysis of 12 case- control studies estimated that the risk of non- cardia 
gastric cancer (cancer in all areas of the stomach, except for the top portion near the esophagus) was nearly six times higher for H. pylori -infected people than for uninfected 
people (Helicobacter and Cancer Collaborative 2001 ).  Similarly, in prospective cohort 
studies, H. pylori -infected individuals had a nearly eight -fold increased risk for non- cardia 
gastric cancer ( Kamangar et al. 2006) .  A general atrophy of the stomach lining caused 
by H. pylori is thought to be the root cause of carcinogenesis in gastric cancer, although more direct interactions mediated by the bacterium have also been posited ( Atherton 
2006). 
As with other bacterial infections, H. pylori induces a robust immune reaction in the host 
(Atherton 2006; Kusters et al. 2006) .  Unlike other bacterial infections, however, the 
immune response is primarily cellular, rather than humoral.  Moreover, the cell -mediated 
immune reactions mounted by the host generally fail to clear the infection, due to H. pylori -induced products that interfere with local immune responses.  Thus, gastric 
cancer develops in the presence of an induced cell -mediated immune response, but one 
which immune subtypes and cytokine levels indicate to be in a tolerogenic state.  It is reasonable to hypothesize that the PD -L1/PD -1 pathway may be co- opted by the 
bacterium to help generate this anergy.  
Consistent with this hypothesis, a number of studies have indicated a role for PD -L1 in 
gastri c carcinogenesis.  In case studies, PD-L1 was expressed on tumor cells in 42% to 
65% of patients with gastric cancer ( Wu et al. 2006; Geng et al. 2014; Wei et al. 2014) .  
PD-L1 immunodetection was significantly correlated to tumor size, invasion, lymph node 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 57 metastasis and survival time of patients.  PD -L1 immunolabeling was si gnificantly 
enhanced (P<0.01) when the tumor infiltrated into the deep muscular layers, with lymph 
node metastasis or survival time of less than 2 years ( Wu et al. 2006; Geng et al. 2014) .  
High expression of PD -L1 was associated with poor prognosis ( Geng et al. 2014) .  
Finally, the anti -PD-L1 antibody Atezolizumab demonstrated preliminary activity against 
gastric cancer in Study PCD4989g. 
1.3.1.10  Other Solid Tumors  
This cohort has been closed to recruitment from P rotocol Version 4 onwards.  
Immune checkpoints and their involvement in tumor surveillance are highly complex, and 
many details of their regulation remain to be determined.  Thus, other cancers than the ones included in the previous 9 cohorts are good targets for Atezolizumab, but might not  
be predicted to be so based on our current knowledge.  In an effort to potentially capture 
other targetable cancers, the cohort enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors not 
included in the other cohorts.  Any positive signals in Cohort  10 may be followed up in 
future clinical studies.  
1.3.1.11  Malignant Germ Cell Tumors  
Malignant germ cell tumors form a heterogeneous entity that is described by their 
histology. The tumor s derive from embryonal cells and are located in the majority of 
cases in gonads (testis and ovary), but also in head and neck and mediastinum. 
Gonocytes have almost completely demethylated DNA, which facilitates the accumulation of mutations during cell replication and the development of intratubular 
germ  cell neoplasia ( Hanna et al. NEJM 2014). Frankhauser et al. have published PD -L1 
expression in testicular germ cell tumors. They found 73% of all seminomas and 64% of 
all non- seminomas exhibited PD -L1 expression by multi -tissue microarray using a cut -off 
value of 5% (Frankhauser et al. BJC 2015).  
1.3.1.12  ER+/HER2 - Metastatic Breast Cancer with Known High 
Mutation Load (>100 mutations) by Local Test 
Although several advances have been achieved, most of the patients with metastatic ER+/HER2 - breast cancer will die after 4 years. One of the challenges is to identify new 
treatment for patients with ER+/HER2- mBC.  
Whole exome sequencing of metastatic breast cancers has revealed that a subset of 
ER+/Her2 - mBC present with high mutational load ( Stephens et al. Nature 2012, M. 
Disis, ASCO 2015 ). This subset of patients might be more likely to benefit from 
immunotherapy due to increased number of mutations and neoantigens. Haricharan et al. 
demonstrated that ER+, but not ER -, tumors with a high somatic mutational load are 
associated with poor overall survival (HR = 2.02). These high mutation load tumors are enriched for coincident mutations in both DNA damage repair and ER signature genes (Haricharan et al. Breast Cancer Res Treat, 2014).  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 58 1.3.1.13  Thymoma and Thymic Cancer  
Epithelial thymomas and thymic carcinomas include a variety of subtypes, well described 
in the World Health Organization ( WHO ) classification and must be differentiated from a 
number of nonepithelial thymic neoplasms, including (but not limited to) neuroendocrine tumors  (NETs) , germ cell tumors and lymphomas. In general, thymomas are indolent 
tumors with a tendency toward local recurrence rather than metastasis.  Thymic carcinomas, however, are typically invasive, with a higher risk of relapse and a poorer 
prognosis.  
Thymic carcinoma is often associated with an overexpression of growth factor receptors 
like epidermal growth factor  receptor (EGFR), stem cell factor receptor (SCFR) and 
Insulin -like growth- factor -1 receptor (IGF -1R) and have been found to frequently harbor 
mutations in epigenetic regulatory genes.  
In a sample of 38 thymic carcinoma patients, 70% stained positive for PD -L1 and in a 
sample of 101 thymoma s, 23 % stained positive for PD -L1 (Katsuyo et  al. 2015).  
1.3.1.14  Gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) and Lung Neuroendocrine 
Tumors  (NET s) 
Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are generally classified based on their anatomic site of 
origin.  NETs can arise in many different areas of the body, and are most often located in the intestine, pancreas or the lungs.  Due to the different etiology and biology, two different cohorts are implemented in this study: neuroendocrine gastroenteropancreatic 
tumors and neuroendocrine tumors of the lung (excluding small cell lung cancer , SCLC ). 
The WHO classification scheme places neuroendocrine tumors into three main categories, which emphasize the tumor grade rather than the anatomical origin: well -
differentiat ed NETs (low grade), neuroendocrine carcinomas with low -grade malignant 
behavior and poorly differentiated (high grade) and neuroendocrine carcinomas, which 
are the large cell neuroendocrine and small cell carcinomas.  
Neuroendocrine gastroenteropancreatic tumors (GEP -NETs) share a common 
phenotype with immunoreactivity for the so- called ‘pan- neuroendocrine’ markers 
including chromogranin A and synaptophysin.  Neuron- specific enolase (NSE) and CD56 
are often positive in GEP -NETs, but are not specific for this tumor entity. Pulmonary 
neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) express serotonin and NSE and also gastrin- releasing 
peptide (GRP) ( Öberg et al. 2012).  
In a cohort of 32 patients with metastatic GEP -NET, PD -L1 expression was reported in 
21.9% of the patients ( Kim et al. 2016).  
1.3.1.15  HPV Induced Squamous Cell Carcinomas 
As described for cervical cancer, HPV induced tumors have the potential to be highly immunogenic.  An estimated 50% of penile, 88% of anal, 43% of vulvar, 70% of vaginal, 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 59 and 13– 56% oropharyngeal cancers are attributable to HPV, primarily HPV -16 typically 
followed by HPV -18 (De Vuyst et al, 2009).  
1.3.1.15.1  Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC)  
During the past decade, infection with HPVs, in particular HPV16 has emerged as a risk 
factor for HNSCCs, specifically HNSCCs arising in the oropharynx (tonsil, base of tongue, and soft palate). Currently, up to 70% of oropharyngeal cancers in the US are 
HPV-mediated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas. HPV -16 is detected in over 90% 
of HPV -induced HNSCC and data suggests that HPV -16 cancers may present more 
frequently with lymph node metastases and may have a poorer outcome compared with 
other HPV types ( Nichols et al, 2013).  
Recently several studies of PD -1–pathway inhibitors have reported overall response 
rates in the 20% range in relapsed HNSCC (Seiwert et al, 2015; Fury et al. 2014). 
Responses were observed in both HPV positive and HPV negative patients,  
1.3.1.15.2  Penile Cancer  
Penile carcinoma is mostly a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with several histological subtypes. In this study only HPV positive squamous cell penile carcinoma will be included. The current treatment of HPV -positive penile SCC is identical to other penile 
SCCs.  
HPV DNA has been detected in approximately 40% to 50% of invasive penile cancer cases and in up to 90% of high- grade squamous intraepithelial lesions.  The high -risk 
oncogenic subtypes 16 and 18 were detected in over 60% of HPV -positive specimens.  
1.3.1.15.3  Vaginal and Vulvar Cancers 
SCC accounts for approximately 85% of vaginal cancer cases and about 90% of vulvar carcinomas.  In this study only HPV positive squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina and the vulva will be included. Both HPV 16 and 18 are commonly detected in HPV -induced 
vaginal or vulvar cancers. The treatment of HPV positive or negative SCC of the vagina 
and vulva are identical.  
1.3.1.15.4  Anal Cancer  
HPV infection is strongly associated with anal cancer development and may be a 
necessary step in its carcinogenesis. HPV16 is the most prevalent HPV subtype in anal carcinoma and is present in up to 89% of all patients with anal carcinoma 
(Serup- Hansen et al, 2014).  
1.3.1.16  Known MSI High or MMR Deficient Tumors (excluding CRC and 
gastric cancers)  
Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a hypermutable phenotype caused by the loss of DNA MMR  activity and is detected in a wide range of human solid tumors.  Its frequency is 
highly variable across tumor types and has not been evaluated for all tumor types.  
Frequencies assessed include: uterine 14.1%, small bowel 8.6%, prostate 6.2%, cancer 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 60 of unknown primary  origin 2.7%, hepatobiliary 2.3%, neuroendocrine 0.2%, pancreas 
0.2%, NSCLC 0.2% and breast 0.1% ( Hall et al, 2016).  
MSI has been linked to a number of phenotypic characteristics and clinicopathological 
features of tumors and its predictive relevance has been primarily studied in colorectal 
cancer.  Recent data are suggestive of more pronounced efficacy of checkpoint 
inhibitors in patients with colorectal or gastric cancer whose tumors are MSI-high.  
MSI-H CRC is known to have an exceptionally high mutation burden.  There is an 
increased presence of tumor -specific neoantigens in hypermutated tumors which is 
associated with an increased quantity of tumor -infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and 
overexpression of immune checkpoint receptors and ligands such as PD -1 and PD -L1 
(Overman et al. 2016). 
Overall the MSI status appears predictive of anti -PD-1/L1 therapy efficacy independently 
of tumor histology ( Le et al., 2015).  
1.3.2  Benefit -Risk 
Prior to enrolment, most patients in this study will have received previous treatment including surgery, radiation therapy and/or  systemic cyto toxic chemotherapy for the 
treatment of their solid tumor(s).  Moreover, it is likely that all standard therapeutic options for their advancing, treatment -refractory disease will have been exhausted, 
necessitating enrolment into a clinical trial, and that their overall prognosis is consequently bleak.   
Immunotherapy with Atezolizumab could provide substantial benefit to the advanced 
solid tumor patients enrolling in this study.  In the ongoing Study PCD4989g, 
Atezolizumab has exhibited efficacy in a variety of solid tumors.  For instance, in 
advanced NSCLC patients with IC ≥  5%, th e confirmed ORR was 26.5% (95% CI: 14.3%, 
43.6%) and the 24- week PFS rate was 36.4% (95% CI: 19.95%, 52.74%).  The DOR 
ranged from 12.3+ to 85.9+ weeks.  In advanced NSCLC patients with IC < 5%, the confirmed ORR was 15.9% (95% CI: 7.2%, 29.0%) and the 24- week PFS rate was 41.1% 
(95% CI: 26.18%, 56.07%).  The DOR ranged from 25.4+ to 70.6+ weeks.   
Significant efficacy was also observed in Study  PCD4989g in patients with advanced 
urothelial cancer (IHC 2/3, O
RR = 52% [95% CI: 34%, 69%]; IHC 0/1, ORR  =  4% [95% 
CI: 6%, 28%]) and advanced RCC (IHC 1/2/3, ORR  = 20% [95% CI: 9%, 37%]; IHC 0, 
ORR = 10% [95% CI: 2%, 30%]) ( Section 1.2.4.1).  Thus, consistent with other s
tudies in 
the literature ( Brahmer et al. 2012) , the ant i-PD-L1 antibody Atezoli
zumab may act as a 
general anticancer immunotherapy that works across multiple solid tumor types.  
Nonetheless, in order to maximize potential patient benefit, s
ubstantial effort has been 
made to choose patients for enrolment who are most likely to benefit from Atezolizumab 
therapy.  To do so, academic experts were queried and relevant published literature was 
reviewed to identify solid tumors that: 1) were likely to have high immunogenicity and, 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 61 thus, to respond to therapies that increase antitumor immunity; and 2) had published 
evidence indicating a direct role of PD -L1 expression on clinical outcomes, including 
prognosis and treatment outcomes.  Further detail on the reasons for choosing the included tumors in this study are presented in the previous section ( Section  1.3.1 ).  
Although Atezolizumab has been generally well tolerated (see Section 1.2.3 ), adver se 
events with potentially immune- mediated causes, including rash, hypothyroidism, 
hepatitis/transaminitis, colitis, and myasthenia gravis have been observed in 
Study  PCD4989g.  To date, these events have been monitorable and treatable (see 
Section 5.1.4  and the Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure for more information on 
managing adverse events associated with Atezolizumab therapy).  
In summary, then, treatment with Atezolizumab offers the potential for clinical benefit in 
many advanced solid tumors.  Because most Atezolizumab- related toxicities observed to 
date have been mild, transient, and do not overlap with those of chemotherapy, patients 
who do not respond to study treatment are considered likely to be able to subsequently 
receive further  therapies.  Patients will be fully informed of the risk of continuing study 
treatment in spite of apparent radiographic progression, and investigators should make a careful assessment of the potential benefit of doing so, considering radiographic data 
and the clinical status of the patient.

Full details of the histological types / subtypes and markers mandated for each cohort 
are described in Section 4.1.3 . 
In addition, only patients whose tissue is available for biomarker assessment testing will be eligible.   
Enrolled patients will receive Atezolizumab at a fixed dose of 1200 mg administered intravenously on the first day of each cycle.  One cycle of therapy will be defined as 21 days (±  3 days).   
Patients treated with Atezolizumab who have no post -baseline tumor assessment (per 
protocol mandated timelines), and enrolled patients who do not receive any dose of 
Atezolizumab will be replaced.  
Atezolizumab treatment may be continued as long as patients are experiencing clinical 
benefit, as assessed by an investigator, in the absence of unacceptable toxici ty or 
symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression after an integrated 
assessment of radiographic data, biopsy results (if available) and clinical status . 
Patients will be permitted to continue Atezolizumab treatment after RECIST v1.1 criteria (or disease- specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer [ Appendix 6] and malignant 
pleural mesothelioma [ Appendix 7]) for progressive disease are met if they meet all of 
the following criteria:  
• Evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by the Investigator  
• Absence of symptoms and signs (including worsening of laboratory values, e.g., 
new or worsening hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 66 • No decline in ECOG performance status that can be attributed to disease 
progression 
• Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal 
disease) that cannot be managed by protocol -allowed medical interventions  
 
Patients treated with Atezolizumab in whom radiographic disease progression is 
confirmed at a subsequent tumor assessment may be considered for continued study treatment at the discretion of the Investigator if they continue to meet the above criteria. 
If an individual patient continues to experience clinical benefit beyond 2 years of radiologic progressive disease, it lies within the discretion of each investigator to continue study treatment based on a positive risk benefit assessment by the investigator.  
The primary objective of this study is to evaluate Investigator -determined non-
progression rate (NPR) at 18 weeks in the individual cohorts using RECIST, v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural  mesothelioma) and disease- specific criteria for 
patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7).  Secondary efficacy variables (including ORR, BOR, CBR, DOR, TTP and PFS) will be recorded using RECIST, v1.1, (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease -specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer (see 
Appendix  6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7), and modified 
RECIST (see Appendix 3).  
Safety will be monitored by assessing AEs, SAEs, AEs of special interest (AESIs), 
laboratory findings and electrocardiogram.  The National Cancer Institute Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, Version 4.0 (NCI CTCAE, v4.0) will be used to 
quantify the intensity  of AEs occurring during treatment.  Incidence, type and severity of 
AEs, SAEs, incidence of AEs and SAEs leading to Atezolizumab interruption or 
discontinuation and cause of death will be reported.  In addition, to characterize the 
immunogenic potential  and PK of Atezolizumab, blood samples will be taken at various 
time points before and after study treatment administration (see Appendix 2 for a detailed description of the assessments). 
This study will also have an exploratory analysis examining biomarkers.  These analyses 
will be conducted on archival tissue specimens (required for patient inclusion), as well as 
prospectively -collected plasma/blood samples and freshly obtained tumor specimens.  
Collected samples will be analyzed at a central laboratory f or PD -L1 expression, as well 
as other potential markers, to assess relationships between biomarker expression and 
patient outcomes including, but not limited to, response and disease progression.  
All patients will be monitored for survival for a minimum period of 24 months after the 
last patient has been enrolled in each cohort or until all patients have died, withdrawn consent or are lost to follow up, or the Sponsor decides to end the study , whichever 
occurs first.  Survival follow -up information will be collected via clinic visits, telephone 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 67 calls and/or review of patient medical records approximately every 3 months from study 
treatment discontinuation until patient death, loss to follow -up, withdrawal of consent or 
until the study is terminated by the Sponsor.  Patients who discontinue study treatment for reasons other than disease progression (e.g., toxicity) should continue to undergo 
scheduled tumor assessments approximately every 3 months until death, disease 
progression, initiation of further systemic cancer therapy or study closure, whichever occurs first.  
Enrollment in this study will be based on Simon's optimal two- stage design ( Simon 1989) .  
Accordingly, 12 fully -evaluable patients  will be enrolled in each cohort in the first stage.  
If 3 or more of these patients exhibit non- progressive disease at the end of Stage I, then 
an additional 13 fully -evaluable patients will be enrolled in Stage II.  Thus , approximately 
725 patients are expected to participate in the study.   However, if positive efficacy 
signals are observed in any of the other cohorts that include different tumor types or in a specific subgroup of patients within other cohorts (e.g. biomarker positive subgroup) , the 
Sponsor in discussion with the Steering Committee may decide to extend the enrolment 
of the individual tumor type or subgroup of patients based on methodology explained in 
the Determination of Sample Size ( Section 6.1).  
Please refer to the Schedule of Assessments ( Appendix 1) for more detail on the timing 
and nature of assessments to be carried out in this study.  
3.2 END OF STUDY  
The end of cohort  will occur when all patients have been followed for survival for a 
minimum of 24 months after the last patient has been enrolled in the cohort  or until all 
patients have died, withdrawn consent or are lost to follow up, or the Sponsor decides to 
end the s tudy,  whichever occurs first.  
Recruitment/enrollment in any of the cohorts may present some challenges. Therefore, a permanent stop rule may be applied if the recruitment rate is too low after any of the 
individual cohorts have been completely enrolled, which could result in stopping further 
enrolment in some of  the remaining cohorts (Section 4.6.3).  This decision will be made 
by the Sponsor  based on regular review of the recruitment rate. After a cohort has been 
opened for at least 4 months, it may be closed early if the recruitment is less than 2 patients per month on average from the opening of the cohort.  The overall end of study 
will occur when the end of cohort  has occurred for all of the individual cohorts, as 
described above.  
3.3 RATIONALE FOR STUDY DESIGN 
3.3.1  Rationale for Atezolizumab Dose and Schedule  
The fixed dose of 1200 mg (equivalent to an average body weight−based dose of 15 mg/kg) was selected on the basis of both nonclinical studies and available clinical 
data from Study PCD4989g as described below.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 68 The target exposure for Atezolizumab was projected on the basis of nonclinical tissue 
distribution data in tumor -bearing mice, target -receptor occupancy in the tumor, the 
observed Atezolizumab i nterim pharmacokinetics in humans, and other factors.  The 
target trough concentration (C trough) was projected to be 6 μg/mL on the basis of several 
assumptions, including: 1) 95% tumor -receptor saturation is needed for efficacy and 2) 
the tumor -interstitial concentration to plasma ratio is 0.30 based on tissue distribution 
data in tumor -bearing mice.  
The Atezolizumab dose is also informed by available efficacy, safety, PK and immunogenicity data in humans.  Thus, anti -tumor activity has been observed across 
doses from 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg.  The MTD of Atezolizumab was not reached and no DLTs have been observed at any tested dose (0.03– 20 mg/kg).  Preliminary PK data 
from Study PCD4989g suggest that Atezolizumab exhibits pharmacokinetics that are both linear and consistent with typical IgG1 antibodies at doses ≥  1 mg/kg.  Patients 
dosed at 10- , 15-, and 20- mg/kg have maintained the expected target trough levels 
(6 µg/mL), despite the detection of some ATAs.  To date, no relationship between the 
development of measurable ATAs and safety or efficacy has been observed.  
Currently available PK and ATA data suggest that the 15- mg/kg Atezolizumab q3w 
regimen (or fixed- dose equivalent) for Phase II and Phase III studies would be sufficient 
to both maintain C
trough 6 μg/mL and further safeguard against both interpatient variability 
and the potential effect of ATAs that might lead to subtherapeutic levels of Atezolizumab at the 10- mg/kg q3w dose level (or fixed- dose equivalent).  From inspection of available 
observed C
trough data, moving further to the 20- mg/kg Atezolizumab q3w regimen does 
not appear to be warranted to maintain targeted C trough levels relative to the proposed 15 -
mg/kg Atezolizumab q3w level.  
Finally, simulations do not suggest any clinically meaningful differences in exposure 
following a fixed dose or a dose adjusted for weight ( Bai et al. 2012) .  On the basis of the 
preceding analysis, a fixed dose of 1200 mg has been selected in this study (equival ent 
to an average body weight- based dose of 15 mg/kg).  
Selection of an every -21-day dosing interval is supported by this preliminary 
pharmacokinetics evaluation and allows for a convenient integration with common 
chemotherapeutic regimens.  
All available PK , ATA, safety, and efficacy data for Atezolizumab will continue to be 
evaluated as described above to support the proposed 1200 -mg fixed dose.  
3.3.2  Rationale for Patient Population and Analysis Groups  
This study will assess the safety and efficacy of Atezolizumab in patients with a diverse 
array of advanced solid tumors.  An increasing pool of data indicates that anti -PD-L1 
therapy, by reinvigorating tumor -specific T -cell activity, has the potential to boost 
antitumor immunity against multiple cancers.  A Phase I dose- escalation study of 207 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 69 patients treated with the anti -PD-L1 antibody BMS -936559 reported an ORR of 
approximately 17% in patients with melanoma, 12% in patients with renal cell carcinoma, 
10% in patients with NSCLC and 6% in patients with ovarian cancer (Brahmer et al. 
2012) .  Several durable responses were observed in this study, with partial responses 
and complete responses ongoing at over 18 months.   
Similar ly, in the ongoing Study PCD4989g, Atezolizumab exhibited efficacy in a variety 
of solid tumors, including NSCLC, bladder cancer and RCC ( Section 1.2.4.1 ). 
Although the response rate appears to correlate with PD -L1 expression in Phase I study 
PCD4989g, responses per RECIST v1.1 and prolonged stable disease have been 
observed in the subgroup of patients with low PD -L1 expression.  Therefore, this trial will 
include patients with all levels of PD -L1 expression.  
In order to maximize potential patient benefit, substantial effort has been made to choose patients for enrolment who are most likely to benefit from Atezolizumab therapy.  
To do so, academic experts were queried and relevant published literature was reviewed to identify solid tumors that: 1) were likely to have high immunogenicity and, thus, to respond to therapies that increase antitumor immunity; and 2) had published evidence 
indicating a direct role of PD -L1 expression on clinical outcomes, including prognosis 
and treatment outcomes.  Further detail on the rationale for choosing the included 
tumors in this study are presented in Section 1.3.1 . 
3.3.3  Rationale for Biomarker Assessments 
The development of advanced cancers is thought to occur by a complex, multi -step 
process involving diverse cell -biological functionalities.  These include sustaining 
proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, reprogramming of energy metabolism, 
evading immune destruction and activating invasion and metastasis ( Hanahan and 
Weinberg 2011) .  Therefore, all patients may not be equally likely to benefit from 
treatment with Atezolizumab.  Thus, this study will collect various tumor and blood 
samples at baseline in an effort to identify those patients with advanced solid tumors 
who respond most actively to Atezolizumab.  Furthermore longitudinal sampling of both 
tumor and blood may help identifying changes induced by Atezolizumab and might help 
to understand potential escape mechanisms.  Analysis and comparison of tumor and blood samples might additionally help to (further) develop diagnostic tools and 
techniques.  
3.4 OUTCOME MEASURES  
3.4.1  Efficacy Outcome Measures 
The primary efficacy outcome measure for this study is as follows:  
• Non progression rate (NPR) at 18 weeks  is defined as the percentage of pati ents 
with CR, PR or SD at 18 weeks, as determined by the Investigator using RECIST, 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 70 v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease-
specific criter ia for patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) and malignant 
pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7) .  Patients treated with Atezolizumab who 
have no post -baseline tumor assessment (per protocol mandated timelines), and 
enrolled patients who did not receive any dose of Atezolizumab will be replaced 
 
The secondary efficacy outcome measures for this study are as follows:  
• Non progression rate (NPR) at 24 weeks  is defined as the percentage of patients 
with CR, PR or SD at 24 weeks, as determined by the Investigator using RECIST, 
v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease-
specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) and malignant 
pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7).  Patients treated with Atezol izumab who 
have no post -baseline tumor assessment (per protocol mandated timelines), and 
enrolled patients who did not receive any dose of Atezolizumab will be replaced 
• Overall response rate (ORR)  is defined as the proportion of patients with a CR or 
PR, a s assessed by the Investigator using RECIST v1.1 (except for prostate cancer 
and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease -specific criteria for patients with 
prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see 
Appendix 7)  
• Best overall response (BOR)  is defined as the proportion of patients with the best 
response obtained throughout the trial, as determined by the Investigator using 
RECIST v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and 
disease- specific criter ia for patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) and 
malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7)  
• Clinical benefit rate (CBR)  is defined as the proportion of patients whose BOR, as 
determined by the Investigator using RECIST, v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease- specific criteria for patients with 
prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7), is either CR, PR or SD lasting for at least 6 weeks  
• Duration of objective response (DOR)  is defined as the time from the first 
occurrence of a documented objective response to the time of progression, as 
determined by the Investigator using RECIST, v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and 
malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease-specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7), or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.  For patients who do not die or experience disease progression before the end of the study or who are 
lost to follow -up, duration of objective response will be censored at the day of the 
last tumor assessment  
• Progression- free survival (PFS)  is defined as the time from the first day of study 
treatment to the first occurrence of disease progression, as determined by the 
Investigator using RECIST, v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease- specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer (see 
Appendix 6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7), or death from any cause, whichever occurs first.  A patient without a PFS event will be censored at 
the time of the last evaluable tumor assessment.  Patients with no tumor 
assessment after the baseline visit will be censored at the time of the first day of study treatment plus 1 day

RECIST, v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease- specific criteria for  patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) and 
malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7), or death due to reason of 
disease progression, whichever occurs first. Patients who have not progressed or 
died due to disease progression at the time of study completion or who are lost to follow -up will be censored at the date of the last evaluable tumor assessment.  
Patients with no tumor assessment after the baseline visit will be censored at the time of the first day of study treatment plus 1 day  
• Overal l survival (OS)  is defined as the time from the first day of study treatment to 
death from any cause.  Patients for whom no death is captured on the clinical database will be censored at the most recent date they were known to be alive 
 NPR at 18 and 24 weeks, ORR, BOR, CBR, DOR, PFS and TTP will also be determined 
by the Investigator using modified RECIST  (see Appendix 3).

Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 82 4.3.2  Atezolizumab Dosage, Administration, and Compliance  
The dose of Atezolizumab in this study will be 1200 mg administered by intravenous 
infusion every 3 weeks (21 [± 3] days).  
Administration of Atezolizumab will be performed in a setting with emergency medical 
facilities and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.  
Atezolizumab will be delivered in 250 mL 0.9% NaCl IV infusion bags with product contacting surfaces of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyolefin (PO) and IV infusion lines 
with product contacting surfaces of PVC or polyethylene (PE) and 0.2 µm in- line filters 
(filter m embrane of polyethersulfone [PES]).  No incompatibilities have been observed 
between Atezolizumab and these infusion materials (bags and infusion lines).  
The initial dose of Atezolizumab will be delivered over 60 (± 15) minutes.  If the first 
infusion is tolerated without infusion- associated adverse events, the second infusion 
may be delivered over 30 (± 10) minutes.  If the 30- minute infusion is well tolerated, all 
subsequent infusions may be delivered over 30 (± 10) minutes.   
For first infusion of study treatment, the patient’s vital signs  must  be determined within 
60 minutes before the infusion; during, and after the infusion if clinically indicated. For 
subsequent infusions, vital signs will be collected within 60 minutes before infusion and 
at the end of the infusion, if clinically  indicated.  
Patients will be informed about the possibility of delayed post -infusion symptoms and 
instructed to contact their study physician if they develop such symptoms.  
No premedication will be allowed for the first dose of Atezolizumab.  Premedication may 
be administered for Cycles ≥ 2 at the discretion of the treating physician.  The 
management of infusion- related reactions will be according to severity as follows:  
• In the event that a patient experiences a mild (NCI CTCAE Grade 1) infusion- related 
event, the infusion rate should be reduced to half the rate being given at the time of 
event onset.  Once the event has resolved, the investigator should wait for 30 
minutes while delivering the infusion at the reduced rate.  If  tolerated, the infusion 
rate may then be increased to the original rate 
• In the event that a patient experiences a moderate infusion- related event (NCI 
CTCAE Grade 2) or flushing, fever, or throat pain, the patient should have his or her infusion immediately interrupted and should receive aggressive symptomatic 
treatment.  The infusion should be restarted only after the symptoms have 
adequately resolved to baseline grade. The infusion rate at restart should be half of 
the infusion rate that was in progress at the time of the onset of the infusion- related 
event  
• For severe or life- threatening infusion- related events (NCI CTCAE Grade 3 or 4), 
the infusion should be stopped immediately, and aggressive resuscitation and 
supportive measures should be initiated.  Patients experiencing severe or life-
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 83 threatening infusion- related events will not receive further infusion and will be further 
managed as clinically indicated until the event resolves  
 
For anaphylaxis precautions, see Appendix 4.  
Guidelines for dosage modification, treatment interruption or discontinuation, and the 
management of specific adverse events are provided in Section 5.1.3  and the 
Atezolizumab Inv estigator’s Brochure.  
Any overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be noted on the Study 
Drug Administration electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).  AEs associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Please refer to the Pharmacy Manual for detailed instructions on drug preparation, storage and administration.  
4.3.3  Investigational Medicinal Product Accountability  
All investigational medicinal products (IMPs) required for completion  of this study 
(Atezolizumab) will be provided by the Sponsor where required by local health authority regulations.  The study site will acknowledge receipt of IMPs using the IxRS to confirm the shipment condition and content.  Any damaged shipments will be replaced.  
IMPs will either be disposed of at the study site according to the study site’s institutional standard operating procedure or returned to the Sponsor with the appropriate documentation.  The site's method of IMP destruction must be agreed to by  the Sponsor.  
The site must obtain written authorization from the Sponsor before any IMP is destroyed, and IMP destruction must be documented on the appropriate form.  
Accurate records of all IMPs received at, dispensed from, returned to, and disposed of by the study site should be recorded on the Drug Inventory Log.  
4.3.4  Post -Trial Access to Atezolizumab 
The Sponsor will offer post -trial access to the study drug (Atezolizumab) free of charge 
to eligible patients in accordance with the Roche Global Policy on Continued Access to 
Investigational Medicinal Product, as outlined below.  
A patient will be eligible to receive study drug after the end of the study if all of the 
following conditions are met:  
• The patient has a life- threatening or severe medical condition and requires 
continued study drug treatment for his or her well -being  
• There are no appropriate alternative treatments available to the patient  
• The patient and his or her doctor comply with and satisfy any legal or regulatory requirements that apply to them  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 84  
A patient will not be eligible to receive study drug after the end of the study if any of the 
following conditions are met:  
• The study drug is commercially marketed in the patient's country and is reasonably 
accessible to the patient (e.g., is covered by the patient's insurance or wouldn't 
otherwise create a financial hardship for the patient)  
• The Sponsor has discontinued development of the study drug or data suggest that the study drug is not effective for the cohort of advanced solid tumor into which the 
patient had enrolled 
• The Sponsor has reasonable safety concerns regarding the study drug as treatment 
for the cohort of advanced solid tumor into which the patient had enrolled  
• Provision of study drug is not permitted under the laws and regulations of the patient's country  
 
The Roche Global Policy on Continued Access to Investigational Medicinal Product is 
available at the following Web site:  
http://www.roche.com/policy_continued_access_to_investigational_medicines.pdf  
 
Patients may also take part in an extension study if the patient is still benefiting from 
treatment (defined as no registered PD) at the time of planned Last Patient Last Visit date. If the extension study is not set -up in time for the patient to roll over by the planned 
protocol LPLV date, nor is there a Post -Trial Access Program available, the patient can 
continue treatment in the study until the extension study is opened at the patient’s site. During the interim period between LPLV and a patient rolling over to the extension study, only sa fety data (AE including SAE and AESI) will continue to be collected in the eCRF. 
Other assessments (e.g. tumor assessment) can be performed as per standard of care.
 
 
4.4 CONCOMITANT THERAPY  
4.4.1  Permitted Therapy  
Concomitant therapy includes any prescription medic ations or over -the-counter 
preparations  used by a patient between the 7 days preceding the screening evaluation 
and the treatment discontinuation visit.  
Patients who experience infusion- associated symptoms may be treated symptomatically 
with acetaminophen,  ibuprofen, diphenhydramine and/or famotidine or another H2 
receptor antagonist, as per standard practice (for sites outside the United States, 
equivalent medications may be substituted per local practice).  Serious infusion-associated events manifested by  dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, 
tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation or respiratory distress should be managed with 
supportive therapies as clinically indicated (e.g., supplemental oxygen and β2-
adrenergic agonists).  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 85 Systemic corticosteroi ds and tumor necrosis factor−α inhibitors may attenuate potential 
beneficial immunologic effects of treatment with Atezolizumab but may be administered 
at the discretion of the treating physician.  If feasible, alternatives to corticosteroids should be considered.  Premedication may be administered for Cycles ≥ 2 at the 
discretion of the treating physician after consultation with the Medical Monitor.  The use 
of inhaled corticosteroids for COPD and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) and low-dose corticosteroids for patients with orthostatic hypotension or adrenocortical 
insufficiency is allowed.  Megestrol administered as an appetite stimulant is acceptable 
while the patient is enrolled in the study.  
Colony -stimulating factors, such as granulocyte colony -stimulating factor and 
erythropoietin, should only be used according to the ASCO and ASCO/ASH guidelines, respectively (Smith et al. 2006; Rizzo et al. 2010) .  Influenza vaccination should be given 
during influenza season only (approximately October to March).  Patients must not 
receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine (e.g., FluMist®) within 4 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 or at any time during the study  treatment, or within 5 months after the last dose of 
Atezolizumab,  but may receive inactivated vaccine.  
Patients who use hormonal therapy with gonadotropin- releasing hormone agonists or 
antagonists for prostate cancer, oral contraceptives, hormone- replacement therapy, 
prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (such as low molecular weight heparin or warfarin at a stable dose level), or other allowed maintenance therapy (see Section 4.1.2 ) should continue their use.  
Females of reproductive potential should use a highly effective means of contraception.  
All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.
 
 
4.4.2  Prohibited Therapy  
Any concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer, whether health authority -
approved or experimental, is prohibited.  This includes but is not limited to the following:  
• Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, investigational 
agents or herbal therapy (except for maintenance therapies outlined in Section 4.1.1 , 
and 4.1.2 ) 
– After Cycle 2, certain forms of radiotherapy may be considered for pain palliation if patients are deriving benefit (e.g., treatment of known bone 
metastases). Please contact the Medical Monitor prior to initiating radiotherapy.  
– Patients experiencing a mixed response requiring local therapy (e.g., surgery, stereotactic radiosurgery, radiotherapy, radiofrequency ablation) for control of 
three or fewer lesions may still be eligible to continue study treatment.  Patients 
who receive local therapy directed at a target lesion will no longer be evaluable 
for radiographic response but will remain evaluable for progression. Such cases 
must be discussed with and approved by the Sponsor  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 86  
• The concomitant use of herbal therapies is not recommended because their 
pharm acokinetics, safety profiles, and potential drug -drug interactions are generally 
unknown.  However, their use for patients on study is allowed at the discretion of the investigator, provided that there are no known interactions with any study treatment.  
As noted above, herbal therapies intended for the treatment of cancer are prohibited  
• Patients who are receiving a receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand 
inhibitor (denosumab) prior to enrollment must be willing and eligible to receive a 
bisphos phonate instead while on study; denosumab could potentially alter the 
activity and the safety of Atezolizumab 
 
Patients should not receive any live, attenuated vaccine (e.g., FluMist®) at any time 
during the study while the patient is receiving Atezolizumab and for a period of 5 months 
after the discontinuation of Atezolizumab.  
Patients are not allowed to receive immunostimulatory agents, including but not limited to interferon (IFN) -α, IFN -γ, or IL -2, during the entire study.  These agents, in 
combination with Atezolizumab, could potentially increase the risk for autoimmune 
conditions.  
Patients should also not receive immunosuppressive medications, including but not limited to cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, methotrexate, and thalidomide.  These 
agents could potentially alter the activity and the safety of Atezolizumab.  Systemic 
corticosteroids and anti−TNF -α agents may attenuate potential beneficial immunologic 
effects of treatment with Atezolizumab, but may be administered at the discretion of the treatin g physician. If feasible, alternatives to these agents should be considered.  
In addition, all patients should not receive other immunostimulatory agents for 10 weeks after the last dose of Atezolizumab.  
The above list of medications is not necessarily comprehensive.  The investigator should consult the prescribing information for any concomitant medication and contact the Medical Monitor if questions arise regarding medications not listed above.  
4.5 STUDY ASSESSMENTS  
Please see Appendix  1 for the Schedule of Assessments performed during the study.  
4.5.1  Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log 
Written informed consent for participation in the study must be obtained before performing any study -specific screening tests or evaluations.  Informed Consent Forms 
for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be 
maintained at the study site.  
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet 
all eligibility criteria before Cycle 1 Day 1.  The investigator will maintain a screening log 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 87 to record details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for 
screening failure, as applicable.  
4.5.2  Medical History, Disease History and Demographic Data  
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including but not limited to cancer histology, grade, stage, prior cancer therapies and 
procedures, smoking history, asbestos exposure). The following must be reported: 
results of HPV determination on tumor tissue using in situ hybridization (ISH) or a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based test (results from existing tests must be 
available at baseline for patient s who are candidates for the HPV induced tumors cohort), 
results of determination of microsatellite instabilit y (MSI)  or MMR deficiency on tumor 
tissue and corresponding normal tissue per institution’s standard practice (results from existing tests must be available at  baseline for patients who are candidates for the MSI -
high or MMR deficient tumor cohorts), results of BRCA mutations (results from existing 
tests must be provided at baseline for patients candidates for the BRCA positive breast 
or ovarian cancer cohort), results of ER and HER2 status and documentation of number 
of mutations detected by local test ( results from existing tests  are mandatory at baseline 
for patients who are candidates for the breast cancer with > 100 mutations cohort), 
results of EBV determination on tumor tissue per local institutional practice (nasopharyngeal and gastric cancer cohort s).  Associated syndromes, Helicobacter 
pylori  infection, and relevant mutations ( such as RET/PTC, PTEN, BRAF, RAS, PI3KCA, 
TP53, etc.), reproductive status, and all medications (e.g., prescription drugs, over -the-
counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional supplements) used by the patient within 7 days prior to the screening visit must also be reported. A history of pleural or pericardial effusion or of ascites requiring intervention should be entered in the medical history.  
An anonymized copy or transcript of screening test results or medical history  may be 
collected by  the Sponsor for data interpretation, either for a specific cohort or for specific 
cases. A review of histopathology may be performed by the Sponsor or their delegates 
for individual cases or for specific cohorts to ascertain cancer histology - this will b e 
performed using tissue/slides collected for biomarkers.  
Demographic data will include age, sex, and self -reported race/ethnicity.  
4.5.3  Physical Examinations  
A complete physical examination should include an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat  and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, 
gastrointestinal, and neurological systems.  Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF.  Height and weight should be measured and recorded in the eCRF.  
At subsequent visits (or as clinically indicated), limited, symptom -directed physical 
examinations should be performed.  Changes from baseline abnormalities should be 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 88 recorded in patient notes.  New or worsened clinically significant abnormalities should be 
recorded as adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
4.5.4  Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include measurements of respiratory rate, pulse rate, and systolic and diastolic blood pressures while the patient is in a seated position and temperature.  
 For first infusion of study treatment, the patient’s vital signs must be determined within 
60 minutes before the infusion; during, and after the infusion if clinically indicated. For 
subsequent infusions, vital signs will be collected within 60 minutes before infusion and 
at the end of the infusion, if clinically  indicated. Patients will be informed about the 
possibility of delayed post -infusion symptoms and instructed to contact their study 
physician if they develop such symptoms . 
Blood oxygen saturation will be measured at time points specified in the Schedule of Assessments (see Appendix 1) by pulse oximetry.  
4.5.5  Tumor and Response Evaluations  
Screening assessments must include CT scans (with oral/IV contrast unless contraindicated) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  A spiral CT scan of the chest may be obtained but is not a requirement.  
A CT (with contrast) or MRI scan of the head must be done at screening to evaluate CNS metastas is in all patients.  An MRI scan of the brain is required to confirm or refute 
the diagnosis of CNS metastases at baseline in the event of an equivocal scan (see Section 4.1.2  for CNS -related exclusions).  
Bone scans and CT scans of the neck should also be performed if clinically indicated.  At the investigator’s discretion, other methods of assessment of measurable disease as per 
RECIST v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and 
disease- specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix 6) and malignant 
pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7) may be used.  
For subsequent tumor assessments, procedures should be performed as indicated in Appendix 1.  The same radiographic procedure used to assess disease sites at screening should be used throughout the study (e.g., the same contrast protocol for CT scans).  All known sites of disease must be documented at screening and reassessed at 
each subsequent tumor evaluation.  Response will be assessed by the investigator using 
RECIST v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease- specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer (see Appendix  6) and malignant 
pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7), and modified RECIST criteria (see Appendix 3).  
The same evaluator should perform assessments if possible to ensure internal 
consistency across visits.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 89 Computed tomography ( CT) scans and other data s upporting efficacy measure ment s 
may be collected by the Sponsor  in case  an independent review is required, either for a 
specific cohort or for specific cases (e.g. to validate responses) . 
4.5.6  Laboratory, Biomarker, and Other Biological Samples  
Local laboratory  assessments will include the following:  
• Hematology (CBC, including RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC count with 
automated differential [neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, basophils, 
and other cells], and platelet count). A manual differential can be done if clinically 
indicated.  
• Serum chemistries (includes BUN, creatinine/creatinine clearance,  sodium, 
potassium, magnesium, chloride, bicarbonate ([if routinely performed on venous 
blood samples]), calcium, phosphorus, glucose, total bilirubin with fractionation into

DNA  must be obtained prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 if patient has positive serology for 
anti-HBc Ab  
• C- reactive protein (CRP)  
• HCV serology  – prior to inclusion only. Patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) 
antibody must be tested for HCV using RNA polymerase chain reaction 
• All patients will be tested for HIV prior to the inclusion into the study and HIV -
positive patients will be excluded from the clinical trial  
• Patients with ovarian cancer: CA125 level  
• Patients with colon cancer: CEA level  
• Patients with prostate cancer: PSA level  
• Patients with breast cancer: CA153 level  
• Patients with pancreatic cancer: CA 19.9 levels   
• Other tumor biomarkers as clinically indicated  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 90 • Samples for the following laboratory tests will be sent to one or several central 
laboratories for analysis:  
o Serum sample for ATA assessment using validated immunoassays (see 
Appendix 1 and 2 for details)   
o Serum sample for PK assessments using validated immunoassays (see 
Appendix 1 and 2 for details)  
• Plasma samples for biomarkers (see Appendix 1 and 2 for details)  
 
Any remaining samples collected for PK, biomarker assays, and ATAs may be used for 
exploratory biomarker profiling, identification, and pharmacodynamic assay development 
purposes and additional safety assessments (e.g., ATA assay), as appropriate.  
• Archival or  fresh biopsy samples for eligibility:  
o Representative formalin- fixed paraffin- embedded (FFPE) tumor specimens in 
paraffin blocks (preferred) or, in exceptional cases, 15 freshly cut and unstained slides, with an associated pathology report  (in local language), for central 
testing. Detection of tumor in the provided block (or slide) needs to be confirmed by the central pathology laboratory prior to study enrollment.  
o Only tissue from core needle, punch or excisional biopsy sample collection will be accepted.   For core- needle biopsy specimens, at least three cores should be 
submitted for evaluation.  Fine- needle aspiration, brushing, bone tissue, and 
lavage samples are not acceptable  
o Patients who do not have tissue specimens meeting eligibility requirements 
must undergo a biopsy during the screening period.  Acceptable samples 
include core needle biopsies for deep tumor tissue (minimum three cores) or 
excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions  
• Optional biopsies  
o For patients who have agreed to provide optional tumor tissue samples and have signed the Consent for Optional Biopsies Form.  
o Tumor tissue will be freshly obtained by core needle or excisional/punch biopsy.  
Acceptable samples include core needle biopsies for deep tumor tissue 
(minimum three cores) or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous,  or mucosal lesions.  
o The pre- treatment specimen will be obtained after eligibility criteria have been 
fulfilled.  Alternatively, the pre- treatment biopsy can be replaced by a biopsy 
which was taken no more than 12 months before Cycle 1, Day 1.   
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 91 o A subsequent biopsy will then be performed approximately 3 weeks (Cycle 2, 
Day 1) after the first Atezolizumab administration.  (For logistical reasons, the 
subsequent biopsy may be performed with a time window of 1 week.)  
For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and shipment instructions, see the laboratory manual.  
Biopsies shall be performed with discernment as this traumatic surgical gesture will not in all cases benefit intrinsically the individual patient, but hypothetically medical research.  
4.5.7  Electrocardiograms  
Twelve -lead ECG is required at screening and as indicated in Appendix 1.  ECGs should 
be obtained on the same machine whenever possible.  Lead placement should be as 
consistent as possible.  ECG recordings should be performed after the patient has been 
resting in a supine position for at least 10 minutes.  
For safety monitoring purposes, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG tracings. Paper copies of ECG tracings will be kept as part of the patient's permanent study file at the site.  Any  morphologic waveform changes or other ECG abnormalities 
must be documented on the eCRF.  
4.5.8  Samples for Roche Clinical Repository  
4.5.8.1  Overview of the Roche Clinical Repository  
The Roche Clinical Repository (RCR) is a centrally administered group of facilities used for the long- term storage of human biologic specimens, including body fluids, solid 
tissues, and derivatives thereof (e.g., DNA, RNA, proteins, peptides).  The collection and analysis of RCR specimens will facilitate the rational design of new pharmaceutical agents and the development of diagnostic tests, which may allow for individualized drug therapy for patients in the future.  
RCR specimens will be used to achieve the following objectives:  
• To further study the association of biomarkers with efficacy, adverse events, or 
disease progression 
• To increase knowledge and understanding of disease biology 
• To study drug response, including drug effects and the processes of drug absorption and disposition 
• To develop biomarker or diagnostic assays and establish the performance 
characteristics of these assays 
 
4.5.8.2  Approval by the Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee  
Collection and submission of biological samples to the RCR is contingent upon the 
review and approval of the exploratory research and the RCR portion of the Informed 
Consent Form by each site's Institutional Review Board or Ethics Committee (IRB/EC) 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 92 and, if applicable, an appropriate regulatory body.  If a site has not been granted 
approval for RCR sampling, this section of the protocol ( Section 4.5.8) will not be 
applicable at that site.  
4.5.8.3  Sample Collection  
All blood and tissue samples collected in this study and derivatives thereof will be destroyed no later than 5 years after the date of final closure of the clinical study 
database.  However, patients who enroll in this study will have the option, at the time of 
enrolment, to consent to RCR sampling to allow the remainder of these samples and derivatives thereof to be stored and used for exploratory research.  If the patient provides consent for this optional exploratory research, these samples will be sent to 
and stored in the RCR and will be destroyed no later than 15 years after the date of final 
closure of the clinical study database.  
These specimens will be used for research purposes to identify biomarkers that are 
predictive of response to study treatment (in terms of dose, safety, and tolerability) and 
will help to better understand the pathogenesis, course, and outcome of advanced solid tumors.  Specimens for non- inherited biomarker discovery will be single coded like any 
other clinical sample (labeled and tracked using the patient’s study identification number 
(see Section 8.4 and 4.5.8.4 ).  Genetic specimens will undergo additional processes to 
maintain confident iality upon receipt by the RCR ( Section 4.5.8.4 )   
Tumor tissue, plasma samples and derivatives thereof ar
e col
lected throughout the 
study for purposes of b iomarker assessment ( Section 2.4 and Schedule of Assessments 
[Appendix 1 and 2]).  Residual samples will be collected and stored for research 
purposes, including tumor samples (archival material and freshly obtained biopsies) and 
plasma samples.  Archival tumor tissue blocks from the initial diagnosis will be returned 
to the site.  
The specimens in the RCR will be made available for future biomarker research toward further understanding of study treatment, solid tumors and related diseases, adverse events and toward development of potential associated diagnostic assays.  The implementation and use of the RCR specimens is governed by the RCR policy to ensure 
the appropriate use of the RCR specimens.
 
For all samples, dates of consent and specimen collection should be recorded on the 
associate d RCR page of the eCRF.  For sampling procedures, storage conditions, and 
shipment instructions, see the Laboratory Manual.  
4.5.8.4  Confidentiality  
The dynamic biomarker specimens will be subject to the confidentiality standards described in Section 8.4.  The genetic biomarker specimens will undergo additional 
processes to ensure confidentiality, as described in the section below.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 93 Given the sensitive nature of genetic data, Roche has implemented additional processes 
to ensure patient confidentiality for RCR specimens and associated data.  Upon receipt by the RCR, each specimen is "double- coded" by replacing the patient identification 
number with a new independent number.  Data generated from the use of these 
specimens and all clinical data transferred from the clinical database and considered 
relevant are also labeled with this same independent number.  A "linking key" between the patient identification number and this new independent number is stored in a secure database system.  Access to the linking key is restricted to authorized individuals and is 
monitored by audit trail.  Legitimate operational reasons for accessing the linking key are 
documented in a standard operating procedure.  Access to the linking key for any other reason requires written approval from the Pharma Repository Governance Committee and Roche's Legal Department, as applicable.  
Data generated from RCR specimens must be available for inspection upon request by representatives of national and local health authorities, and Roche monitors, representatives, and collaborators, as appropriate.  
Patient medical information associated with RCR specimens is confidential and may be disclosed to third parties only as permitted by the Informed Consent Form (or separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, 
unless permitted or required by law.  
Data derived from RCR specimen analysis on individual patients  will generally not be 
provided to study Investigators unless a request for research use is granted.  The aggregate results of any research conducted using RCR specimens will be available in accordance with the effective Roche policy on study data publicat ion. 
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of the RCR data will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened property of Roche, except where agreed otherwise.  
4.5.8.5  Consent to Participate in the Roche Clinical Repository  
The Informed Consent Form administered at study enrolment will contain a separate 
section that addresses participation in the RCR.  The Investigator or authorized 
designee will explain to each patient the objectives, methods, and potential hazards of participation in the RCR.  Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and may withdraw their specimens at any time and for any reason during the storage 
period.  A separate, specific signature will be required to document a patient's 
agreement to participate in the optional RCR research.  Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.  
The Investigator should document whether or not the patient has given consent to participate by completing the RCR Research Sample Informed Consent eCRF.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 94 In the event of an RCR participant's death or loss of competence, the participant's 
specimens and data will continue to be used as part of the RCR research.  
4.5.8.6  Withdrawal from the Roche Clinical Repository  
Patients who give consent to RCR research have the right to withdraw their specimens 
from the RCR at any time for any reason.  If a patient wishes to withdraw consent to the testing of his or her specimens, the Investigator must inform the Medical Monitor in 
writin g of the patient's wishes through use of the RCR Subject Withdrawal Form and, if 
the trial is ongoing, must enter the date of withdrawal on the RCR Research Sample 
Withdrawal of Informed Consent eCRF.  The patient will be provided with instructions on how to withdraw consent after the trial is closed.  A patient's withdrawal from Study 
MO29518 does not, by itself, constitute withdrawal of specimens from the RCR.  Likewise, a patient's withdrawal from the RCR does not constitute withdrawal from Study  MO29518. 
4.5.8.7  Monitoring and Oversight  
RCR specimens will be tracked in a manner consistent with Good Clinical Practice by a 
quality -controlled, auditable, and appropriately validated laboratory information 
management system, to ensure compliance with data confidentiality as well as 
adherence to authorized use of specimens as specified in this protocol and in the Informed Consent Form.  Roche monitors and auditors will have direct access to 
appropriate parts of records relating to patient participation in the RCR for the purposes 
of verifying the data provided to Roche.  The site will permit monitoring, audits, IRB/EC review, and health authority inspections by providing direct access to source data and documents related to the RCR samples. 
4.6 PA TIENT, TREA TMENT, STUDY, AN D SITE DISCONTINUATI ON 
4.6.1  Patient Discontinuation 
Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  In addition, the Investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time.  Reasons for withdrawal  from the study may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Patient withdrawal of consent at any time 
• Any medical condition that the investigator or Sponsor determines may jeopardize 
the patient’s safety if he or she continues in the study  
• Investig ator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient  
• Patient non- compliance 
 
Every effort should be made to obtain information on patients who withdraw from the 
study.  The primary reason for withdrawal from the study must be documented on the appropriate eCRF.  However, patients will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn.  Patients who withdraw from the study prior to receiving study drug 
will be replaced.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 95 4.6.2  Study Treatment Discontinuation 
Patients must discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the following:  
• Symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression as determined by the 
Investigator after integrated assessment of radiographic data, biopsy results, and 
clinical status  
• Intolerable toxicity related to Atezolizumab, including development of an immune-mediated adverse event determined by the investigator to be unacceptable given 
the individual patient’s potential response to therapy and severity of the event  
• Any medical condition that may jeopardize the patient’s safety if he or she continues 
on study treatment  
• Use of another non- protocol anti -cancer therapy (see Section  4.4.2 ) 
• Pregnancy  
 
Atezolizumab treatment may be continued as long as patients are experiencing clinical 
benefit as assessed by an investigator in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or 
symptomatic deterioration attributed to disease progression after an integrated assessment of radiographic data, biopsy results (if available), and clinical status.  
Patients will be permitted to continue Atezolizumab treatment after RECIST v1.1 (or disease- specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer [see Appendix 6] and malignant 
pleural mesothelioma [see Appendix 7])  criteria for progressive disease are met if they 
meet all of the following criteria:   
• Evidence of clinical benefit as assessed by the Investigator  
• Absence of symptoms and signs (including worsening of laboratory values, e.g., 
new or worsening hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease  
• No decline in ECOG performance status  that can be attributed to disease 
progression 
• Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal 
disease) that cannot be managed by protocol -allowed medical interventions  
 
Patients treated with Atezolizumab in whom radiographic disease progression is 
confirmed at a subsequent tumor assessment may be considered for continued study 
treatment at the discretion of  the Investigator if they continue to meet the above criteria.  
If an individual patient continues to experience clinical benefit beyond 2 years of radiologic progressive disease, it lies within the discretion of each investigator to continue study treatment based on a positive risk benefit assessment by the investigator.  
The primary reason for study treatment discontinuation should be documented on the appropriate eCRF.  Anticancer therapies received after Atezolizumab discontinuation will be collected.   
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 96 Patients who withdraw from the study prior to receiving study drug will be replaced.   
4.6.3  Study and Site Discontinuation 
The Sponsor has the right to terminate this study  or any cohort  at any time.  Reasons for 
terminating the study may include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• The incidence or severity of adverse events in this or other studies indicates a 
potential health hazard to patients  
• Patient enrollment is unsatisfactory  – Recruitment in each cohort will be monitored 
regularly . After a cohort has been opened for at least 4 months , it may be closed 
early  if the recruitment is less than 2 patients per month on average from the 
opening of the cohort.  
 The Sponsor will notify the investigator if the Sponsor decides to discontinue the study  or 
close a c ohort .   
The Sponsor has the right to close a site at any time.  Reasons for closing a site may 
include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• Excessively slow recruitment  
• Poor protocol adherence 
• Inaccurate or incomplete data recording  
• Non-compliance with the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline 
for Good Clinical Practice 
• No study activity (i.e., all patients have completed and all obligations have been 
fulfilled)  
 
5. ASSESSMENT OF SAFETY  
5.1 SAFETY PLAN  
Atezolizumab (TECENTRIQ®) is approved for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma, 
NSCLC , small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and triple- negative breast cancer (TNBC) . 
Human experience is currently ongoing and the entire safety profile is not known at this time.  The following information is based on results  from nonclinical and clinical studies 
and published data on similar molecules.  
Measures will be taken to ensure the safety of patients participating in this trial, including the use of stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria (see Section 4.1.1  and 4.1.2) and 
close monitoring (as indicated below and in Section 4.5). 
Administration of Atezolizumab will be performed in a setting with emergency medical 
facilities and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.  All adverse events and serious adverse events will be recorded during the trial and for up to 90 days after the last dose of study drug or until the initiation of another anti -cancer 
therapy, whichever occurs first.  To mitigate potential unknown risks, at least in part, 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 97 dosing beyond Cycle 1 will be limited to patients who have not developed unaccept able 
toxicity or disease progression or who have evidence of potential 
pseudoprogression/tumor immune infiltration.  The potential safety issues anticipated in this trial, as well as measures intended to avoid or minimize such toxicities, are outlined 
in the following sections.  
5.1.1  Risks Associated With Atezolizumab 
The PD -L1/PD -1 pathway is involved in peripheral tolerance; therefore, such therapy 
may increase the risk of immune- mediated adverse events, specifically the induction or 
enhancement of autoimmune conditions.   
Atezolizumab has been associated with risks such as the following:  IRRs and immune-
mediated hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, pancreatitis, diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, 
hyperthyroidism, adrenal insufficiency, hypophysitis, Guillain- Barré syndrome, 
myasthenic syndrome or myasthenia gravis, meningoencephalitis, myocarditis, nephritis, 
and myositis.  Immune- mediated reactions may involve any organ system and may lead 
to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and macrophage activation syndrome.  
Refer to Appendix 8 and Section 6 of the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for a 
detailed description of anticipated safety risks for atezolizumab.  
5.1.2  General Plan to Manage Safety Concerns  
5.1.2.1  Eligibility Criteria  
Eligibility criteria were selected to guard the safety of patients in this trial.  Results from the nonclinical toxicology studies with Atezolizumab, as well as the nonclinical/clinical 
data from other PD -L1/PD -1 inhibitors, were taken into account.  Specifically, patients at 
risk for study- emergent autoimmune conditions or with a prior diagnosis of autoimm une 
disease, patients with evidence of acute infections, and patients who have received a 
live-attenuated viral vaccine within 4 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1 are excluded from the 
study (see Section 4.1.2  for additional details).  
5.1.2.2  Monitoring 
Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all serious and non-serious adverse events defined and graded according to NCI CTCAE, v4.0.  Patients will be assessed for safety (including laboratory values) according to the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix 1).  Laboratory values must be reviewed prior to each infusion.  
General safety assessments will include serial interval histories, physical examinations , 
and specific laboratory studies, including serum chemistries and blood counts (see 
Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 for the list and timing of study assessments).  
During the study, patients will be closely monitored for the development of any signs or 
symptoms of autoimmune conditions and infection. 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 98 All serious adverse events and protocol -defined events of special interest (see  
Sections 5.2.2  and 5.2.3 ) will be reported in an expedited fashion (see Sect ion 5.4.2).   
Patients will be followed for safety for 90 days
 following their last dose of study drug or 
until they receive another anti -cancer therapy, whichever comes first.  
Patients who have an ongoing study drug−related adverse event upon study completion 
or at discontinuation from the study will be followed until the event has resolved to 
baseline grade, the event is assessed by the investigator as stable, new anti -cancer 
treatment is initiated, the patient is lost to follow -up, the patient withdraws consent, or it 
has been determined that study treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse 
event.  
5.1.3  Atezolizumab Dose Modification 
There will be no dose reduction for Atezolizumab in this study.  Patients may temporarily 
suspend study treatment if they experience adverse events that require a dose to be held.  If Atezolizumab is held because of adverse events for > 105 days beyond when 
the next dose would have been given, then the patient will be discontinued from 
Atezolizumab treatment and will be followed for safety and efficacy as specified in the Schedule of Assessments (Appendix  1). 
If a patient must be tapered off steroids used to treat adverse events, Atezolizumab may be held for additional time beyond 105 days. The acceptable length of interruption will depend on an agreement between the investigator and the Medical Monitor.   
Dose interruptions for reason(s) other than adverse events, such as surgical procedures, may be allowed with Medical Monitor approval.  The acceptable length of interruption will depend on agreement between the investigator and the Medical Monitor.  
5.1.4  Management of Specific Adverse Events  
 Refer to Appendix 8 and Section 6 of the Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure for a 
detailed description of anticipated safety risks for atezolizumab. 
5.2 SAFETY PARAMETERS AN D DEFINITIONS  
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events, including serious adverse events and non- serious adverse events of special interest, performing 
protocol -specified safety laboratory assessments, measuring protocol -specified vital 
signs, and conducting other protocol -specified tests that are deemed critical to the safety 
evaluation of the study.  
Certain types of events require  immediate reporting to the Sponsor, as outlined in 
Section 5.4. 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 99 5.2.1  A dverse Events  
According to the ICH guideline for Good Clinical Practice, an adverse event is any 
untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation subject administered a 
pharmaceutical  product, regardless of causal attribution.  An adverse event can 
therefore be any of the following:  
• Any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, 
whether or not considered related to the medicinal product  
• Any new disease or exacerbation of an existing disease (a worsening in the 
character, frequency, or severity of a known condition), except as described in 
Section 5.3.5.8  
• Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (e.g., headache) not present at baseline 
• Any deterioration in a laboratory value or other cli nical test (e.g., ECG, X -ray) that is 
associated with symptoms or leads to a change in study treatment or concomitant treatment or discontinuation from study drug 
• Adverse events that are related to a protocol -mandated intervention, including those 
that occur prior to assignment of study treatment (e.g.,  screening invasive 
procedures such as biopsies)  
 
5.2.2  Serious Adverse Events (Immediately Reportable to the 
Sponsor)  
A serious adverse event is any adverse event that meets any of the following criteria:  
• Is fatal  (i.e., the adverse event actually causes or leads to death)  
• Is life threatening (i.e.,  the adverse event, in the view of the investigator, places the 
patient at immediate risk of death)  
This does not include any adverse event that had it occurred in a more severe form or was allowed to continue might have caused death.  
• Requires or prolongs inpatient hospitalization (see Section 5.3.5.10 ) 
• Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e., the adverse event results in substantial disruption of the patient’s ability to conduct normal life 
functions)  
• Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to 
study dr ug 
• Is a significant medical event in the investigator's judgment (e.g., may jeopardize the patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes 
listed above)  
 
The terms "severe" and "serious" are not  synonymous.  Severity refers to the intensity of 
an adverse event (e.g., rated as mild, moderate, or severe, or according to National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) criteria; 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 100 see Section 5.3.3 ); the event itself may be of relatively minor medical significance (such 
as severe headache without any further findings).  
Severity and seriousness need to be independently assessed for each adverse event 
recorded on the eCRF.  
Serious adverse events are required to be reported by the investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section  5.4.2 for 
reporting instructions).  
5.2.3  Non-Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest (Immediately 
Reportable to the Sponsor)  
Non-serious adverse events of special interest are required to be reported by t he 
investigator to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Section 5.4.2  for reporting instructions).  Adverse events of special interest 
for this study include the following: 
• The following are confirmed treatment- emergent autoimmune conditions: 
• Pneumonitis  
• Colitis  
• Endocrinopathies: diabetes mellitus, pancreatitis, adrenal insufficiency or 
hyperthyroidism  
• Hepatitis  
• Transaminitis: Grade ≥ 2 (AST or ALT > 3 × ULN and bilirubin > 2 × ULN ) or  
  AST/ALT > 10 × ULN  
– Systemic lupus erythematosus  
– Neurological: Guillain- Barré syndrome, Myasthenia Gravis, 
Meningoencephalitis  
• Events suggestive of hypersensitivity, cytokine release,SIRS (influenza- like illness, 
systemic inflammatory response syndrome), SIA ( systemic inflammatory activation) or infusion- reaction syndromes"  
• Cases of potential drug- induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT or AST in 
combination with either an elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as defined by Hy’s law (see Section 5.3.5.6 ) 
• Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study drug, as defined below  
o Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or non- pathogenic, 
is considered an infectious agent.  A transmission of an infectious agent 
may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory findings that 
indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal product.  This 
term applies only when a contamination of the study drug is suspected."

Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 101  
5.3 MET HODS AND TIMING FOR CAPTURING AND ASSESS ING 
SAFETY PARAMETERS 
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all adverse events (see Section 5.2.1  for 
definition) are recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF and reported to the Sponsor in 
accordance with instructions provided in this section and in Section 5.4-5.6. 
For each adverse event recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, the investigator will make 
an assessment of seriousness (see Section  5.2.2  for seriousness criteria), severity (see 
Section 5.3.3 ), and causality (see Section 5.3.4 ).   
5.3.1  Adverse Event Reporting Period 
Investigators will seek information on adverse events at each patient contact.  All adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study personnel,  will be 
recorded in the patient’s medical record and on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
After informed consent  has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug , only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention (e.g., invasive 
procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported (see  Section 5.4.2  for instructions fo r reporting serious adverse events).  
After initiation of study drug , all adverse events will be reported until 90 days after the 
last dose of study drug or until they receive another anti -cancer therapy, whichever 
comes first.  After this period, the investigator should report any serious adverse events that are believed to be related to prior study drug treatment (see Section 5.6). 
5.3.2  Eliciting Adverse E vent Information 
A consistent methodology of non- directive questioning should be adopted for eliciting 
adverse event information at all patient evaluation timepoints.  Examples of nondirective 
questions include the following:  
"How have you felt since your last clinic visit?"  
"Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last here?"  
 
5.3.3  A ssessment of Severity of A dverse Events  
The adverse event severity grading scale for the NCI CTCAE (v4.0) will be used for 
assessing adverse event severity.  Table  6 will be used for assessing severity for 
adverse events that are not specifically listed in the NCI CTCAE.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 102 Table  6. Adverse Event Severity Grading Scale for Events Not Specifically 
Listed in NCI CTCAE  
Grade Severity  
1 Mild; asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
or intervention not indicated 
2 Moderate; minimal, local, or non- invasive intervention indicated; or limiting 
age-appropriate instrumental activities of daily living a 
3 Severe or medically significant,  but not immediately life- threatening; 
hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; or limiting  self-care activities of daily living

NCI CTCAE  = National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events . 
Note:  Based on the most recent version of NCI CTCAE (v4.0), which can be found at:  
http://ctep.cancer.gov/protocolDevelopment/electronic_applications/ctc.htm  
a Instrumental activities of daily living refer to preparing meals, shopping for groceries or 
clothes, using the telephone, managing money, etc.  
b Examples of self -care activities of daily living include bathing, dressing and undressing, 
feeding oneself, using the toilet, and taking medications, as performed by patients who are not bedridden.  
c If an event is assessed as a "significant medical event," it must be reported as a serious adverse event (see Section 5.4.2 for reporting instructions), per the definition of serious 
adverse event in Section 5.2.2. 
d Grade 4 and 5 events must be reported as serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2  for 
reporting instructions), per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 . 
 
5.3.4  Assessment of Causality of Adverse Events 
Investigators should use their knowledge of the patient, the circumstances surrounding 
the event, and an evaluation of any potential alternative causes to determine whether or not an adverse event is considered to be related to the study drug, indicating "yes" or 
"no" accordingly.  The following guidance should be taken into consideration 
• Temporal relationship of event onset to the initiation of study drug  
• Course of the event, considering especially the effects of dose reduction, 
discontinuation of study drug, or reintroduction of study drug (as applicable)  
• Known association of the event with the study drug or with similar treatments  
• Known association of the event with the disease under study  
• Presence of risk  factors in the patient or use of concomitant medications known to 
increase the occurrence of the event  
• Presence of non- treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with the 
occurrence of the event  
 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 103 For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for 
each protocol -mandated therapy.  
5.3.5  Procedures for Recording Adverse  Events 
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when recording adverse events on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Avoid colloquialisms  and abbreviations.  
Only one adverse event term should be recorded in the event field on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
5.3.5.1  Diagnosis versus Signs and Symptoms  
For adverse events other than infusion- related reactions, a diagnosis (if known) should 
be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF rather than individual signs and symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated transaminases).  However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, each 
individual event should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If a diagnosis is subsequently established, all previously reported adverse events based on signs and symptoms should be nullified and replaced by one adverse event report based on the single diagnosis, with a starting date that corresponds to the starting date of the first 
symptom of the eventual diagnosis.  
5.3.5.2  A dverse Events That A re Secondary to Other Events  
In general, adverse events that are secondary to other events (e.g., cascade events or 
clinical sequelae) should be identified by their primary cause, with the exception of severe or serious secondary events.  A medically significant secondary adverse event 
that is separated in time from the initiating event should be recorded as an independent 
event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  For example:  
• If vomiting results in mild dehydration with no additional treatment in a healthy adult, only vomiting should be reported on the eCRF.  
• If vomiting results in severe dehydration, both events should be reported separately 
on the eCRF.  
• If a severe gastrointestinal hemorrhage leads to renal failure, both events should be 
reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If dizziness leads to a fall and consequent fracture, all three events should be reported separately on the eCRF. 
• If neutropenia is accompanied by an infection, both events should be reported 
separately on the eCRF.  
 
All adverse events should be recorded separately on the Adverse Event eCRF if it is  
unclear as to whether the events are associated.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 104 5.3.5.3  Persistent or Recurrent A dverse Events  
A persistent adverse event is one that extends continuously, without resolution, between 
patient evaluation timepoints. Such events should only be recorded once on the Adverse 
Event eCRF . The initial severity (intensity or grade) of the event will be recorded at the 
time the event is first reported.  If a persistent adverse event becomes more severe, the most extreme severity should also be recorded on the Adverse Event  eCRF.  If the event 
becomes serious, it should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 
24 hours after learning that the event became serious; see Section 5.4.2  for reporting 
instructions).  The Adverse Event eCRF should be updated by changing the event from 
"non- serious" to "serious," providing the date that the event became serious, and 
completing all data fields related to serious  adverse events.  
A recurrent adverse event is one that resolves between patient evaluation timepoints and subsequently recurs.  Each recurrence of an adverse event should be recorded as a separate event on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
5.3.5.4  Abnormal Laboratory Values  
Not every laboratory abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A laboratory test result 
must be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:  
− Change from baseline and one of the following:  
• Is accompanied by clinical symptoms  
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
• Results in a medical intervention (e.g., potassium supplementation for hypokalemia) 
or a change in concomitant therapy  
• Is clinically sign ificant in the investigator’s judgment  
Note:  For oncology trials, certain abnormal values may not qualify as adverse events.  
 It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all laboratory findings.  Medical and 
scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated laboratory 
abnormality should be classified as an adverse event.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome 
(e.g., alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin 5 × ULN associated with cholestasis), only the 
diagnosis (i.e.,  cholestasis) should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
If a clinically significant laboratory abnormality is not a sign of a disease or syndrome, 
the abnormality itself should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, along with a descriptor indicating if the test result is above or below the normal range (e.g., "elevated potassium," as opposed to "abnormal potassium").  If the laboratory abnormality can be 
characterized by a precise clinical term per standard definitions, the clinical term should 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 105 be recorded as the adverse event.  For example, an elevated serum potassium level of 
7.0 mEq/L should be recorded as "hyperkalemia."  
Observations of the same clinically significant laboratory abnormality from visit to visit 
should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.4 for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
5.3.5.5  Abnormal Vital Sign Values  
Not every vital sign abnormality qualifies as an adverse event.  A vital sign result must 
be reported as an adverse event if it meets any of the following criteria:  
- Change from baseline and one of the following:  
• Is accompanied by clinical symptoms  
• Results in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment 
interruption, or treatment discontinuation)  
• Results in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy 
• Is clinically significant in the investigator’s judgment  
 
It is the investigator’s responsibility to review all vital sign findings.  Medical and scientific 
judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated vital sign abnormality 
should be classified as an adverse event.  
If a clinically significant vital sign abnormality is a sign of a disease or syndrome (e.g., high blood pressure), only the diagnosis (i.e.,  hypertension) should be recorded on 
the Adverse Event eCRF.  
Observations of the same clinically significant vital sign abnormality from visit to visit should only be recorded once on the Adverse Event eCRF (see Section 5.3.5.3 for 
details on recording persistent adverse events).  
5.3.5.6  Abnormal Liver Function Tests  
The finding of an elevated ALT or AST (> 3 x baseline value) in combination with either 
an elevated total bilirubin (> 2xULN) or clinical jaundice in the absence of cholestasis or 
other causes of hyperbilirubinemia is considered to be an indicator of severe liver injury (as defined by Hy's law).  Therefore, investigators must report as an adverse event the 
occurrence of either of the following:  
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST >  3 x baseline value in combination with total 
bilirubin >  2 x
 ULN (of which ≥ 35% is direct bilirubin)  
• Treatment -emergent ALT or AST >  3 x baseline value in combination with clinical 
jaundice 
 
The most appropriate diagnosis or (if a diagnosis cannot be established) the abnormal 
laboratory values should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF (see  Section 5.3.5.2 ) 
and reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 106 the event), either as a serious adverse event or a non- serious adverse event of special 
interest (see Section 5.4.2).  
5.3.5.7  Deaths 
For this protocol, mortality is an efficacy endpoint.  Deaths that occur during the protocol -
specified adverse event reporting period (see Section 5.3.1 ) that are attributed by the 
investigator solely to progression of one of the advanced solid tumors included in this 
study should be recorded only on the Study Completion/Early Discontinuation eCRF.  All 
other on- study deaths, regardless of relationship to study drug, must be recorded on the 
Adverse Event eCRF and immediately reported to the Sponsor (see Section 5.4.2),  
Death should be considered an outcome and not a distinct event.  The event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be recorded as the single medical concept on the Adverse Event eCRF.  Generally, only one such event should be 
reported.  The term "sudden death " should be used only for the occurrence of an 
abrupt and unexpected death due to presumed cardiac causes in a patient with or 
without preexisting heart disease, within 1 hour after the onset of acute symptoms or, in the case of an unwitnessed death, within 24 hours after the patient was last seen alive 
and stable.  If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time of reporting, "unexplained death"  should be recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the 
cause of death later becomes available (e.g., after autopsy), "unexplained death" should be replaced by the established cause of death.  
During survival follow -up, deaths attributed to progression of one of the advanced solid 
tumors included in this study should be recorded only on the Survi val eCRF.  
5.3.5.8  Preexisting Medical Conditions  
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the screening visit for this study.  
Such conditions should be recorded on the General Medical History and Baseline 
Conditions eCRF.  
A preexisting medical condition should be recorded as an adverse event only  if the 
frequency, severity, or character of  the condition worsens during the study.  When 
recording such events on the Adverse Event eCRF, it is important to convey the concept 
that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable descriptors (e.g., "more frequent headaches").  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 107 5.3.5.9  Lack of Efficacy or Worsening of the Advanced Solid Tumors 
Included in This Study  
Events that are clearly consistent with the expected pattern of progression of the 
underlying disease should not  be recorded as adverse events.  These data will be 
captured as efficacy assessment data only.  In most cases, the expected pattern of 
progression will be based on RECIST v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant 
pleural mesothelioma) and disease -specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer (see 
Appendix 6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7) and modified RECIST (see Appendix 3). In rare cases, the determination of clinical progression will be 
based on symptomatic deterioration.  However, every effort should be made to 
document progression through use of objective criteria.  If there is any uncertainty as to whether an event is due to disease progression, it should be reported as an adverse event.  
5.3.5.10  Hospitalization or Prolonged Hospitalization 
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization (i.e., in- patient admission to a hospital) 
or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and reported as a serious adverse event (per the definition of serious adverse event in Section 5.2.2 ), except as outlined 
below.   
The following hospitalization scenarios are not  considered to be adverse events:  
• Hospitalization for respite care 
• Planned hospitalization required by the protocol (e.g., for study drug administration 
or to perform an efficacy measurement for the study)  
• Hospitalization for a preexisting condition, provided that all of the following crit eria 
are met:  
− The hospitalization was planned prior to the study or was scheduled 
during the study when elective surgery became necessary because of 
the expected normal progression of the disease 
− The patient has not experienced an adverse event  
 
• Hospitaliz ation due solely to progression of the underlying cancer (including 
symptoms) 
 
The following hospitalization scenarios are not considered to be serious adverse events, 
but should be reported as adverse events instead:  
• Hospitalization that was necessary because of patient requirement for outpatient 
care outside of normal outpatient clinic operating hours  
 
5.3.5.11  Adverse Events Associated with an Overdose or Error in Drug 
Administration 
An overdose is the accidental or intentional use of a drug in an amount higher than the 
dose being studied.  An overdose or incorrect administration of study treatment is not itself an adverse event, but it may result in an adverse event.  All adverse even ts 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 108 associated with an overdose or incorrect administration of study drug should be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If the associated adverse event fulfills seriousness criteria, the event should be reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see Section  5.4.2 ). 
5.3.5.12  Adverse Events in Individuals Not Enrolled in the Study  
If an adverse event inadvertently  occurs in an individual not enrolled in the study 
(e.g., during administration of study drug), the Adverse Event Form provided to 
investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee, either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  
5.3.5.13  Infusion related reactions  
Adverse events that occur during or within 24 hours after study drug administration and are judged to be related to study drug infusion should be captured as a diagnosis infusion- related reaction on the Adverse Event eCRF.  If possible, avoid ambiguous 
terms such as "systemic reaction."  Associated signs and symptoms should be recorded 
on the dedicated Infusion- Related Reaction eCRF.  If a patient experiences both a local 
and systemic reaction to the same dose of study drug, each reaction should be recorded 
separately on the Adverse Event eCRF, with signs and symptoms also recorded separately on the dedicated Infusion- Related Reaction eCRF.  
5.4 IMMEDIATE REPORTIN G REQUIREMENTS FROM 
INVESTIGATOR TO SPON SOR 
Certain events require immediate reporting to allow the Sponsor to take appropriate measures to address potential new risks in a clinical trial.  The investigator must report 
such events to the Sponsor immediately; under no circumstances should reporting take 
place more than 24 hours after the investigator learns of the event.  The following is a list of events that the investigator must report to the Sponsor within 24 hours after learning 
of the event, regardless  of relationship to study drug:  
• Serious adverse events (see Section 5.4.2  for further details)  
• Non-serious adverse events of special interest (see Section  5.4.2  for further details)  
• Pregnancies (see Section 5.4.3 for further details)  
 
The investigator must report new significant follow -up information for these events to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after becoming aware of the 
information).  New significant information includes the following:  
• New signs or symptoms or a change in the diagnosis  
• Significant new diagnostic test results  
• Change in causality based on new information 
• Change in the event’s outcome, including recovery  
• Additional narrative information on the clinical course of the event  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 109  
Investigators must also comply with local requirements for reporting serious adverse 
events to the local health authority and IRB/EC.  
5.4.1  Emergency Medical Contacts  
To ensure the safety  of study patients, an Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will 
access the Roche Medical Emergency List, escalate emergency medical calls, provide medical translation service (if necessary), connect the investigator with a Roche Medical Monitor, and tr ack all calls.  The  Emergency Medical Call Center Help Desk will be 
available 24 hours per day, 7 days per week.  Toll -free numbers for the Help Desk, as 
well as Medical Monitor contact information, will be distributed to all investigators.  
5.4.2  Reporting Requirements for Serious Adverse Events and 
Non-Serious Adverse Events of Special Interest  
5.4.2.1  Events That Occur Prior to Study Drug Initiation 
After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only 
serious adverse events caused by a protocol -mandated intervention should be reported.  
The Serious Adverse Event / Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided 
to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event), either by faxing or 
by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to 
investigators.  
5.4.2.2  Events That Occur After Study Drug Initiation 
After initiation of study drug, serious  adverse events and non- serious adverse events of 
special interest will be reported until 90 days after the last dose of study drug or until they 
receive another anti -cancer therapy, whichever comes first.  Investigators should record 
all case details that can be gathered immediately (i.e., within 24 hours after learning of the event) on the Adverse Event eCRF and submit the report via the electronic data 
capture (EDC) system.  A  report will be generated and sent to Roche Drug Safety by the 
EDC system.  
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the Serious Adverse Event / Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed 
and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours 
after learning of the event), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  Once the EDC system is available, all information will need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system.   
Instructions for reporting post -study adverse events are provided in Section 5.6. 
5.4.3  Reporting Requirements  for Pregnancies  
5.4.3.1  Pregnancies in Female Patients  
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the investigator if they become pregnant during the study or within 5 months after the last 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 110 dose of study drug.  A Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form should be completed and 
submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email address provided to investigators.  Pregnancy should not be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRFA pregnancy report will automatically be generated 
and sent to Roche Drug Safety.  The investigator should discontinue study drug and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus.  Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy.  Any 
serious adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an 
event in the mother  during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in 
the child) should be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.  
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, the Clinical Trial Pregnancy Reporting Form provided to investigators should be completed and submitted to the Sponsor or its designee immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the form using the fax number or email 
address provided to investigators.  Once the EDC system is available, all information will 
need to be entered and submitted via the EDC system . 
5.4.3.2  Abortions  
Any abortion should be classified as a serious adverse event (as  the Sponsor considers 
abortions to be medically significant), recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and 
reported to the Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the 
event; see Section 5.4.2 ).   
5.4.3.3  Congenita l Anomalies/Birth Defects  
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study drug or the female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug should be classified as a serious adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to the 
Sponsor immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see 
Section 5.4.2 ). 
5.5 FOLLOW -UP OF PATIENTS AFTER ADVERSE EVENTS 
5.5.1  Investigator Follow -Up 
The investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow -up, the patient withdraws consent or until the patient receives another anti -cancer 
therapy, whichever comes first.  Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial -related procedures until a final 
outcome can be reported.  
During the study period, resolution of adverse events (with dates) should be documented on the Adverse Event eCRF and in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source data verification.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 111 All pregnancies reported during the study should be followed until pregnancy outcome.  
If the EDC system is not available at the time of pregnancy outcome, follow reporting instructions provided in Section 5.4.3.1 . 
5.5.2  Sponsor Follow -Up 
For serious adverse events, non -serious adverse events of special interest, and 
pregnancies, the Sponsor or a designee may follow  up by telephone, fax, electronic mail, 
and/or a monitoring visit to obtain additional case details and outcome information (e.g., from hospital discharge summaries, consultant reports, autopsy reports) in order to 
perform an independent medical assessment of the reported case.  
5.6 POST-STUDY ADVERSE EVENTS 
The Sponsor should be notified if the investigator becomes aware of any serious adverse event that occurs after the end of the adverse event reporting period (defined as 90 days after the last dose of study drug), if the event is believed to be related to prior 
study drug treatment.   
The investigator should report these events directly to the Sponsor or its designee, either by faxing or by scanning and emailing the Serious Adverse Event / Adverse Event of Special Interest Reporting Form using the fax number or email address provided to 
investigators . During survival follow -up, deaths attributed to progression of the advanced 
solid tumor should be recorded on the Survival eCRF and details should be recorded on 
the Study Completion/Early Termination eCRF. 
 
5.7 EXPEDITED REPORTING TO HEALTH AUTHORITIE S, 
INVESTIGATORS, INSTITUT IONAL REVIEW BOARDS,  AND 
ETHICS COMMITTEES 
The Sponsor will promptly evaluate all serious adverse events and non -serious adverse 
events of special interest against cumulative product experience to identify and 
expeditiously communicate possible new safety findings to investigators, IRBs, ECs, and applicable health authorities based on applicable legislation.  
To determine reporting requirements for single adverse event cases, the Sponsor will 
assess the expectedness of these events using the following reference document:  
• Atezolizumab Investigator's Brochure 
 
The Sponsor will compare the severity of each event and the cumulative event 
frequency reported for the study with the severity and frequency reported in the applicable reference docum ent. 
Reporting requirements will also be based on the investigator's assessment of causality and seriousness, with allowance for upgrading by the Sponsor as needed.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 112 6. STATISTICAL CONSIDER AT IO NS AND ANALYSIS PLAN 
Statistical analyses will be based on patients  with the same individual tumor type and 
may be based on pre- defined cohorts or on sub- cohorts. Furthermore, if during the 
conduct of the study, a specific subgroup of patients in a cohort/sub -cohort is identified 
(e.g. a biomarker positive subgroup) then statistical analysis may be performed based 
on this subgroup of patients. In general, within s ection 6, the term cohort is used to refer 
to a group of patients to be analyzed together (whether this is a cohort, a sub- cohort or a 
subgroup).  
The safety population  will be the main population for all analyses  (demographics, 
efficacy and safety) unless otherwise stated. For each cohort, the safety population will 
include all patients who have received at least one dose of study medication.  
For each cohort, the intent -to-treat (ITT) population will include all patients enrolled in the 
study irrespective of whether they have received study medication or not. The ITT 
population will be used to summarize disposition data.  
The evaluation of each cohort at the end of Stage I and Stage II will be based only on 
data from fully evaluable patients, defined as patients receiving at least one dose of 
Atezolizumab and having at least one tumor assessment post- baseline (per protocol 
mandated timelines).  
The per -protocol (PP) population will not be defined due to the small number of patients 
per cohort, but major protocol deviations will be listed.  
The study will be analyzed for the primary efficacy variable at the end of Stage I and 
Stage II.  All cohorts will also be analyzed at Week 24 (6months) and at the end of 
cohort. In case a cohort is closed before reaching 12 patients (e.g., due to accrual problems), data for that cohort will be listed only or pooled with cohort 10. The end of cohort analysis for each cohort will take place when all patients in that cohort have been 
followed for survival for a minimum of 24 months after the last patient has been enrolled 
in the cohort or until all patients have died, withdrawn consent or are lost to follow up, or if the cohort is stopped due to safety or efficacy reasons, or the Sponsor decides to end the cohort, whichever occurs first.  
6.1 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE 
The sample size for  this phase II study is based on Simon’s optimal two- stage design 
(Simon 1989). 
In this Phase II study, an NPR of 20% is a level of activity that is not of interest for further 
clinical development, whereas an NPR of 40% is of clinical interest.  The type I error will 
be 10% and the study will have 80% power to reject the null hypothesis when the true NPR is 40%.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 113 The Simon design in this study requires 12 fully evaluable patients for the first stage.  If 
at the end of the first stage there are 0, 1 or 2 patients with non- progressive disease at 
Week 18, the enrollment into this cohort will be terminated (or the cohort may be expanded as described below).  Otherwise, if more than 2 patients with non- progressive 
disease are observed at the end of Stage I, an additional 13 fully -evaluable patients may  
be enrolled into Stage II.  The study drug will be considered of clinical interest in this cohort if, at the end of the second stage, there are 8 or more patients with non-progressive disease out of 25 total fully -evaluable patients.  
It can be assumed that some patients will not be evaluable for NPR .  A patient will be 
considered evaluable for NPR if they received study drug, have a baseline tumor assessment and at least one tumor assessment post -baseline (per protocol mandated 
timelines) .  Thus, more than 25 patients may be needed to be enrolled per cohort to 
obtain 25 fully -evaluable patients.  
The hypotheses and clinical assumptions will be applied to all cohorts individually.  
Statistical analyses will be based on patients with the same individual tumor type and may be based on pre- defined cohorts or on sub- cohorts  
If a clear clinical benefit has been observed for a defined subgroup of patients at the end of Stage I within a cohort that did not meet the criteria for continuation (as described in Section 6.2.1 ), then enrolment into Stage II might still be allowed in this cohort  for this 
specific subgroup after discussion with the Sponsor and the study Steering Committee. 
Similarly, if a clear clinical benefit has been observed for a defined subgroup of patients 
at the end of Stage II within a cohort that did not meet the criteria for s uccess (as 
described in Section 6.2.2 ), then enrolment into Stage II might continue in this cohort for 
this specific subgroup after discussion with the Sponsor and the study Steering 
Committee.

* And no additional clinical benefit in a subgroup.  
 
6.2 STOPPING RULES FOR EACH COHORT  
6.2.1  Rules for Stage I 
• Enrolment into the cohort may  continue into Stage II if more than 2 patients (out of 
12) with non- progressive disease at Week 18 are observed at the end of Stage I.  
• Enrolment into the cohort will stop at the end of Stage I if the number of patients 
with non- progressive disease (confirmed or unconfirmed) is 2, 1 or 0 out of 12 patients. 
However, if the overall patient population does not meet requirements at Stage I, but a 
clinical benefit is observed in a specific subgroup (e.g. biomarker positive subgroup) of patients, then only this subgroup may be added for Stage I and Stage II to reach numbers as explained in the Sample Size Estimation.   
All decisions above will be made by the Sponsor in discussion with the study Steering Committee members.   

Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 115 6.2.2  Rules for Stage II 
A study treatment will be considered to be promising for a given cohort in Stage II if:  
• there is no unacceptable toxicity, and 
• at 18 weeks, there are 8 or more patients with non- progressive disease out of 25 
fully-evaluable patients.  
 
If the overall patient population does not meet the Stage II  criteria, but a clinical benefit is 
observed in a specific subgroup (e.g. biomarker positive subgroup) of patients, then 
Stage II may be expanded to include additional patients from this specific subgroup in 
order to re- evaluate the Stage II criteria in this patient subgroup.  
Additionally, other efficacy endpoints and safety may also be evaluated for a final 
decision at the end of Stage II. 
6.3 SUMMARIES OF CONDUCT  OF STUDY  
Enrollment criteria exceptions, study treatment administration, reasons for patient discontinuations from the study and duration of follow -up will be described and 
summarized. Major protocol violations will be listed.  
6.4 SUMMARIES OF TREATMENT GROUP COMPARABILI TY 
This is an open- label phase 2 study that will assess Atezolizumab administered at a 
single dosage (1200 mg q3w). Consequently, no formal treatment group comparability 
analyses will be conducted.  Demographics and medical history will be summarized for 
each cohort.  
6.5 EFFICACY ANALYSES 
6.5.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
The primary analysis will be based on NPR at 18 Weeks for each cohort, as assessed by the Investigator using RECIST, v1.1 (except for prostate cancer and malignant pleural mesothelioma) and disease- specific criteria for patients with prostate cancer (see 
Appendix 6) and malignant pleural mesothelioma (see Appendix 7).  This endpoint will 
be assessed at Stage I and Stage II. The number and percentage of progression- free 
patients will be presented along with the corresponding Clopper -Pearson 95% 
confidence interval.  
Hypothesis Testing 
A Simon optimal two- stage design will be used to test whether Atezolizumab yields a 
NPR that is of clinical interest.  In this Phase II study, an NPR of 20% is a level of activity that is not of interest for further clinical development, whereas an NPR of 40% is of clinical interest.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 116 The study hypotheses are:  
• H 0: π ≤ π0 
• H 1: π > π 1 
 
Where π 0 = 20% and the assumed NPR under the alternative is π 1 = 40%.  
The type I error will be 10% and the study will have 80% power to reject the null 
hypothesis when the true NPR is 40%. 
The hypothesis and clinical assumptions will be applied to all cohorts separately. This is 
an early phase II study and cohorts are independent, hence there will be no adjustment 
for multiplicity.  
6.5.2  Secondary Efficacy  Endpoints  
The number and percentage of progression -free patients at 24 weeks will be presented 
along with the corresponding Clopper -Pearson 95% confidence interval. The ORR, BOR 
and CBR will be analyzed in a similar way.   
The time- to-event variables, DOR, PFS, TTP and OS, will be presented graphically 
using the Kaplan- Meier (KM) approach. Estimates together with the associated 95% 
confidence interval will be reported for the median and for the 1- year and 2- year survival 
rates. Duration of response will be summarized only for responders.  
NPR, ORR, BOR, DOR, CBR, PFS and TTP as assessed by the by the Investigator using modified RECIST (see Appendix 3) will also be analyzed as described above.  
6.6 SAFETY ANALYSES 
The safety variables will be summarized for the safety population.  All safety variables 
will be summarized for each cohort.  
Safety will be assessed through summaries of AEs, changes in laboratory test results, changes in vital signs and ECGs, and exposure to Atezolizumab.  
Verbatim descriptions of AEs will be mapped to thesaurus terms.  Adverse event data will be listed by cohort, study site, patient number and study day.  Events occurring on or after treatment on Day 1 will be summarized by mapped term, appropriate thesaurus levels, and NCI CTCAE v4.0 grade.  In addition, SAEs, deaths, and AESIs will be listed 
separately and summarized.  AEs leading to treatment discontinuation will be listed.  
Relevant laboratory and vital signs data will be displayed by time, with NCI CTCAE 
Grade 3 and 4 values identified, where appropriate.  Additionally, all laboratory data will 
be summarized by grade with use of NCI CTCAE v4.0.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 117 Number of cycles and duration on study medication will be summarized by means of 
frequency tables and descriptive statistics for continuous variable (N, median, inter -
quartile range, mean, SD, minimum, maximum).  
6.7 PHARMACOKINETIC ANAL YSES 
Atezolizumab serum concentration data (C min and C max) will be tabulated and 
summarized for each cycle at which pharmacokinetics are measured (C max will be 
report ed for Cycle 1 only; C min will be evaluated at Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, every eight cycles 
thereafter and at treatment discontinuation).  Descriptive statistics will include means, medians, ranges and SDs, as appropriate.  
6.8 EXPLORATORY ANALYSES 
Exploratory biomarker analyses (e.g. but not limited to protein and genetic markers) in 
tumor and plasma samples (both baseline and on treatment) will be performed in an effort to understand the association of these markers with study drug response.  Biomarkers will b e summarized using descriptive statistics: N, medians, inter -quartile 
range, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum for continuous variables and 
frequency counts and percentages for categorical variables.  The relationship between 
biomarkers and efficacy variables will be assessed using appropriate models.  More details will be provided in the Statistical Analysis Plan.  
6.9 INTERIM ANALYSES 
The study will be analyzed for efficacy at Stage I and Stage II.  All cohorts will also be analyzed at Week 24 (6 months) and at the end of cohort for each cohort. No additional 
interim analysis for efficacy will be performed in this study.  
7. DATA COLLECTION AND M ANAG EM ENT   
7.1 DAT A Q UALIT Y ASSURAN CE 
A contract research organization (CRO) will be responsible for data managem ent of this 
study, including quality checking of the data.  Data entered manually will be collected via 
EDC using eCRFs.  Sites will be responsible for data entry into the EDC system.  In the 
event of discrepant data, the CRO will request data clarification from the sites, which the sites will resolve electronically in the EDC system.  
The CRO will produce a Data Quality Plan that describes the quality checking to be performed on the data.  Central laboratory data will be sent directly to the Sponsor using the Sponsor's standard procedures to handle and process the electronic transfer of 
these data.  
The Sponsor will perform oversight of the data management of this study, including approval of the CRO’s data management plans and specifications.  Data will be 
periodically transferred electronically from the CRO to the Sponsor, and the Sponsor’s 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 118 standard procedures will be used to handle and process the electronic transfer of these 
data.  
eCRFs and correction documentation will be maintained in the EDC system’s audit trail.  
System backups for data stored at the CRO and records retention for the study data will 
be consistent with the CRO’s standard procedures.  
7.2 ELECTRONIC CASE REPO RT FORMS  
eCRFs are to be completed through use of a Sponsor -designated EDC system.  Si tes 
will receive training and have access to a manual for appropriate eCRF completion.  
eCRFs will be submitted electronically to the Sponsor and should be handled in 
accordance with instructions from the Sponsor.  
All eCRFs should be completed by designated, trained site staff.  eCRFs should be 
reviewed and electronically signed and dated by the investigator or a designee.  
At the end of the study, the investigator will receive patient data for his or her site in a readable format on a compact disc that must  be kept with the study records.  
Acknowledgement of receipt of the compact disc is required.  
7.3 SOURCE DATA DOCUMENT AT IO N  
Study monitors will perform ongoing source data verification to confirm that critical 
protocol data (i.e., source data) entered into the eCRFs by authorized site personnel are 
accurate, complete, and verifiable from source documents.  
Source documents (paper or electronic) are those in which patient data are recorded and documented for the first time.  They include, but are not limited to,  hospital records, 
clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, patient -reported outcomes, 
evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded data from automated instruments, copies  of transcriptions that are certified after verification as being accurate 
and complete, microfiche, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, X -rays, 
patient files, and records kept at pharmacies, laboratories, and medico- technical 
departments involved in a clinical trial.  
Before study initiation, the types of source documents that are to be generated will be 
clearly defined in the Trial Monitoring Plan.  This includes any protocol data to be 
entered directly into the eCRFs (i.e., no prior written or electronic record of the data) and considered source data.  
Source documents that are required to verify the validity and completeness of data entered into the eCRFs must not be obliterated or destroyed and must be retained per the policy for retention of records described in Section 7.5. 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 119 To facilitate source data verification, the investigators and institutions must provide the 
Sponsor direct access to applicable source documents and repor ts for trial -related 
monitoring, Sponsor audits, and IRB/EC review.  The study site must also allow inspection by applicable health authorities.  
7.4 USE OF COMPUTERIZED SYSTEMS 
When clinical observations are entered directly into a study site’s computerized medical 
record system (i.e., in lieu of original hardcopy records), the electronic record can serve 
as the source document if the system has been validated in accordance with health authority requirements pertaining to computerized systems used in clinical research.  An acceptable computerized data collection system allows preservation of the original entry 
of data.  If original data are modified, the system should maintain a viewable audit trail 
that shows the original data as well as the reason for the change, name of the person making the change, and date of the change.  
7.5 RETENTION OF RECORDS  
Records and documents pertaining to the conduct of this study and the distribution of 
IMP, including eCRFs, ePRO data (if  applicable), Informed Consent Forms, laboratory  
test results, and medication inventory records, must be retained by the Principal 
Investigator for at least 15 years after completion or discontinuation of the study, or for 
the length of time required by relevant national or local health authorities, whi chever is 
longer.  After that period of time, the documents may be destroyed, subject to local regulations.   
No records may be disposed of without the written approval of the Sponsor.  Written 
notification should be provided to the Sponsor prior to transferring any records to 
another party or moving them to another location.  
8. ETHICAL CONSIDERATIO NS 
8.1 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS  AND REGULATIONS  
This study will be conducted in full conformance with the ICH E6 guideline for Good 
Clinical Practice  and the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, or the laws and 
regulations of the country in which the research is conducted, whichever affords the 
greater protection to the individual.  The study will comply with the requirements of the 
ICH E2A guideline (Clinical Safety Data Management:  Definitions and Standards for 
Expedited Reporting).  Studies conducted in the United States or under a U.S. 
Investi gational New Drug (IND) application will comply with U.S. FDA regulations and 
applicable local, state, and federal laws.  Studies conducted in the European Union (E.U.) or European Economic Area will comply with the E.U. Clinical Trial Directive 
(2001/20/E C). 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 120 8.2 INFORMED CONSENT  
The Sponsor’s sample Informed Consent Form (and ancillary sample Informed Consent 
Forms such as a Child’s Assent or Caregiver's Informed Consent Form, if  applicable) will 
be provided to each site.  If applicable, it will be provided in a certified translation of the 
local language.  The Sponsor or its designee must review and approve any proposed deviations from the Sponsor's sample Informed Consent Forms or any alternate consent forms proposed by the site (collectively, the "Consent Forms") before IRB/EC 
submission.  The final IRB/EC −approved Consent Forms must be provided to the 
Sponsor for health authority submission purposes according to local requirements.  
The Informed Consent Form will contain a separate section that addresses the use of remaining mandatory samples for optional exploratory research.  The investigator or 
authorized designee will explain to each patient the objectives of the exploratory research.  Patients will be told that they are free to refuse to participate and m ay 
withdraw their specimens at any time and for any reason during the storage period.  A 
separate, specific signature will be required to document a patient's agreement to allow 
any remaining specimens to be used for exploratory research.  Patients who decline to participate will not provide a separate signature.  
The Consent Forms must be signed and dated by the patient or the patient’s legally authorized representative before his or her participation in the study.  The case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the informed consent process and that 
written informed consent was obtained prior to participation in the study.  
The Consent Forms should be revised whenever there are changes to study procedures 
or when new information becomes available that may affect the willingness of the patient 
to participate.  The final revised IRB/EC -approved Consent Forms must be provided to 
the Sponsor for health authority submission purposes.  
Patients must be re- consented to the most current version of the Consent Forms (or to a 
significant new information/findings addendum in accordance with applicable laws and 
IRB/EC policy) during their participation in the study.  For any updated or revised Consent Forms, the case history or clinical records for each patient shall document the 
informed consent process and that written informed consent was obtained using the 
updated/revised Consent Forms for continued participation in the study.  
A copy of each signed Consent Form must be provided to the patient or the patient’s 
legally authorized representative.  All signed and dated Consent Forms must remain in each patient’s study file or in the site file and must be available for verification by study monitors at any time.  
For sites in the United States, each Consent Form may also include patient authorization to allow use and disclosure of personal health information in compliance with the U.S. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  If the site utilizes a 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 121 separate Authorization Form for patient authorization for use and disclosure of personal 
health information under the HIPAA regulations, the review, approval, and other 
processes outlined above apply except that IRB review and approval may not be required per study site policies.  
8.3 INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARD OR ETHICS  COMMITTEE  
This protocol, the Informed Consent Forms, any information to be given to the patient, 
and relevant supporting information must be submitted to the IRB/EC by the Principal 
Investigator and reviewed and approved by the IRB/EC before the study is initiated.  In addition, any patient recruitment materials must be approved by the IRB/EC.  
The Principal Investigator is responsible for providing written summaries of the status of the study to the IRB/EC annually or more frequently in accordance with the requirements, policies, and procedures established by the IRB/EC.  Investigators are also responsible 
for promptly informing the IRB/EC of any protocol amendments (see Section 9.6). 
In addition to the requirements for reporting all adverse events to the Sponsor, 
investigators must comply with requirements for reporting serious adverse events to the 
local health authority and IRB/EC.  Investigators may receive written IND safety reports 
or other safety -related communications from the Sponsor.  Investigators are responsible 
for ensuring that such reports are reviewed and processed in accordance with health authority requirements and the policies and procedures established by their IRB/EC, and 
archived in the site’s study file.  
8.4 CONFIDENTIALITY  
The Sponsor maintains confidentiality standards by coding each patient enrolled in the 
study through assignment of a unique patient  identification number.  This means that 
patient names are not included in data sets that are transmitted to any Sponsor location.  
Patient medical information obtained by this study is confidential and may be disclosed to third parties only as permitted by  the Informed Consent Form (or  separate 
authorization for use and disclosure of personal health information) signed by the patient, 
unless permitted or required by law.  
Medical information may be given to a patient’s personal physician or other appropriate medical personnel responsible for the patient’s welfare, for treatment purposes.  
Data generated by this study must be available for inspection upon request by 
representatives of the U.S.  FDA and other national and local health authorities, Sponsor 
monitor s, representatives, and collaborators, and the IRB/EC for each study site, as 
appropriate.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 122 8.5 FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE  
Investigators will provide the Sponsor with sufficient, accurate financial information in 
accordance with local regulations to allow the Sponsor  to submit complete and accurate 
financial certification or disclosure statements to the appropriate health authorities.  Investigators are responsible for providing information on financial interests during the course of the study and for 1 year after completion of the study (i.e., LPLV).  
9. STUDY DOCUMENTATION,  MONITORING, AND 
ADMINISTRATION  
9.1 STUDY DOCUMENTATION 
The investigator must maintain adequate and accurate records to enable the conduct of the study to be fully documented, including but not limited to the protocol, protocol amendments, Informed Consent Forms, and documentation of IRB/EC and governmental approval.  In addition, at the end of the study, the investigator will receive 
the patient data, including an audit trail containing a complete record of all changes to 
data.  
9.2 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
The investigator should document and explain any protocol deviations.  The investigator should promptly report any deviations that might have an impact on patient safety and 
data integrity to the Sponsor and to the IRB/EC in accordance with established IRB/EC 
policies and procedures.  
9.3 SITE INSPECTIONS 
Site visits will be conducted by the Sponsor or an authorized representative for inspection of study data, patients’ medical records, and eCRFs.  The investigator will  
permit national and local health authorities, Sponsor monitors, representatives, and 
collaborators, and the IRBs/ECs to inspect facilities and records relevant to this study.  
9.4 ADMINISTRATIVE STRUCTURE  
This study will be sponsored and managed by F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd.  
Approximately 50 sites globally will participate in the study, and approximately  
725 patients will be enrolled.  
Enrollment will occur through an IxRS.  Central facilities will be used for study 
assessments throughout the study (e.g., PDL1 testing, ATA and PK analyses).  Accredited local laboratories will be used for routine monitoring; local laboratory ranges 
will be collected.  
A Steering Committee will be the advisory committee, and study status will be discussed at an ongoing basis .  
Global CRO will support coordination and medical monitoring activities.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 123 9.5 PUBLICATION OF DATA AND PROTECTION OF TRADE 
SECRETS 
Regardless of the outcome of a trial, the Sponsor is dedicated to openly providing 
information on the trial to healthcare professionals and to the public, both at scientific congresses and in peer -reviewed journals.   The Sponsor will comply with all 
requirements for publication of study results.  For more information, refer to the Roche 
Global Policy on Sharing of Clinical Trials Data at the following Web site:  
https://www.roche.com/roche_global_policy_on_sharing_of_clinical_study_information.p
df 
The results of this study may be published or presented at scientific congresses.  For all clinical trials in patients involving an IMP for  which a marketing authorization application 
has been filed or approved in any country, the Sponsor aims to submit a journal manuscript reporting primary clinical trial results within 6 months after the availability of 
the respective clinical study report.  In addition, for all clinical trials in patients involving 
an IMP for which a marketing authorization application has been filed or approved in any 
country, the Sponsor  aims to publish results from analyses of additional endpoints and 
exploratory data that are clinically meaningful and statistically sound.  
The investigator must agree to submit all manuscripts or abstracts to the Sponsor prior to submission for publication or presentation.  This allows the Sponsor to protect 
proprietary information and to provide comments based on information from other 
studies that may not yet be available to the investigator.  
In accordance with standard editorial and ethical practice, the Sponsor will generally 
support publication of multicenter trials only in their entirety and not as individual center 
data.  In this case, a coordinating investigator will be designated by mutual agreement.  
Authorship will be determined by mutual agreement and in line with International Committee of Medical Journal Editors authorship requirements.  Any formal publication of the study in which contribution of Sponsor personnel exceeded that of conventional monitoring will be considered as a joint publication by the investigator and the 
appropriate Sponsor personnel. 
Any inventions and resulting patents, improvements, and/or know -how originating from 
the use of data from this study will become and remain the exclusive and unburdened 
property of the Sponsor, except where agreed otherwise.  
9.6 PROTOCOL AMENDMENTS  
Any protocol amendments will be prepared by the Sponsor.  Protocol amendments will 
be submitted to the IRB/EC and to regulatory authorities in accordance with local regulatory requirements.  
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann -La Roche Ltd  
Protocol  MO29518, Version  8 124 Approval must be obtained from the IRB/EC and regulatory authorities (as locally 
required) before implementation of any changes, except for changes necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard to patients or changes that involve logistical or administrative aspects only (e.g.,  change in Medical Monitor or contact information).

19. After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a pro tocol -mandated 
intervention should be reported. After initiation of study drug, all adverse events will be reported until 90 days after the last dose of study 
treatment or until initiation of another anti -cancer therapy, whichever occurs first. After this period, investigators should report any deaths, 
serious adverse events, or other adverse events of concern that are believed to be related to prior treatment with study drug . The investigator 
should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is assessed as stable by the investigator, 
the patient is lost to follow up, or the patient withdraws consent. Every effort should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to 
be related to study drug or t rial-related procedures until a final outcome can be reported.
20. The initial dose of study  treatment will be delivered over 60 (± 15) minutes.  If the first infusion is tolerated without infusion -associated adverse 
events, the second infusion may  be delivered over 30(± 10) minutes.  If the 30-minute infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may  
be delivered over 30 (± 10) minutes.

Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
Conventional response criteria may not be adequate to characterize the anti -tumor activit y of 
immunotherapeutic agents like Atezolizumab, which can produce delay ed responses that may  be 
preceded by initial apparent radiological progression, including the appearance of new lesions.  
Therefore, modified response criteria have been developed that account for the possible 
appearance of new lesions and allow radiological progression to be confirmed at a subse quent 
assessment.  In this protocol, patients will be permitted to continue study  treatment even after 
modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria for progressive disease 
are met if the risk/benefit ratio is judged to be favorab le.  
Modified RECIST is derived from RECIST, Version 1.1 conventions1and immune -related 
response criteria2(irRC). When not otherwise specified, RECIST v1.1 conventions will apply.

MEA SUR ABLE LESIONS
Tumor Lesions.  Tumor lesions must be accurately  measured in at least one dimension (longest 
diam eter in the plane of measurement is to be recorded) with a minimum size as follows: 
1. 10 mm by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan (CT/MRI 
scan slice thickness/interval no greater than 5 mm)
2. 10- mm caliper measurement by clinical examination (lesions that cannot be accurately 
measured with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)
Malignant Lymph Nodes.  To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, alymph 
node must be 15 mm in the short axis when assessed by CTscan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm).  At baseline and follow -up, only  the short axis will be 
measured an d followed.  
NON -MEA SURA BLE LESIO NS
Non-measurable tumor lesions encompass small lesions (longest diam eter 10mmor 
pathological lymph nodes with short axis 10 but 15 mm), as well as truly non-measurable 
lesions.  Lesions considered truly non-measurable include leptomeningeal disease, ascites, 
pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or 
lung, peritoneal spread, and abdominal mass/abdominal organomegaly identified by physical 
examination that is no t measurable by reproducible imaging techniques.
SPECIA L CONSIDERA TIONS REG ARDING LESION MEA SUR ABILITY
Bone lesions, cystic lesions, and lesions previously treated with local therapy require particular 
comment, as outlined below.
BONE LESIONS
Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, or plain films are not considered adequate 
imaging techniques for measuring bone lesions.  However, these techniques can be used to 
confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic–blastic 
lesions, with identifiable soft tissue components, that can be evaluated by cross -sectional imaging 
techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue 
component meets the definition of measurability describ ed above. Blastic bone lesions are non-
measurable.
CYSTIC LESIONS
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically defined simple cysts should not be considered 
as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by definition, 
simple cysts. Cystic lesions thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as 
measurable lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability described above.  However, if 
non-cystic lesions are present in the same patient, these are preferred for selection as target 
lesions.
LESIONS WITH PRIOR L OCA L TREA TMENT
Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area or in an area subjected to other loco-
regional therapy are usually not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progr ession in the lesion.  Study protocols should detail the conditions under which such lesions 
would be considered measurable.

7DUJHW/HVLRQV
When more than one measurable lesion is present at baseline, all lesions up to a maximum of 
five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesi ons per organ) representat ive of all inv olved organs 
should be identified as target lesions and will be recorded and measured at baseline.  This means that, for instances in which patients have only one ortwo organ site s involved, a maximum of two 
lesions (onesite) and four lesions (twosites), re spectively, will be recorded.   Other lesions (albeit 
measurable) in those organs will be recorded as non-measurable lesions (even if the size is 
#10mm by CTscan).  
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter) 
and be representative of all involved organs, but in addition, should lend themselves to 
reproducible repeated measurements.  It may be the case that, onoccasion, the largest lesion 
does not lend itself to reproducible measurement, inwhich circumstance, the next largest lesion 
that can be measured reproducibly shouldbe selected.
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they ar e normal anatomical structures thatmay be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor.   As noted above, pathological nodes that are 
defined as measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short 
axis of %15 mm by CT scan.  Only the short axis of these nodes will cont ribute to the baseline 
sum.  The short axis of the node is the diamet er normally used by radiologists to judge if a node 
is involved by solid tumor.  Nodal size is no rmally reported as two dimensions in the plane in 
which the image is obtained (for CT, this is  almost always the axial plane; for MRI, the plane 
ofacquisition may be axial, sagittal, or coronal).  The smaller of these measures isthe short axis.  
For example, an abdominal node that is reported as being 20mm ∋30 mm has a shortaxis of 
20mm and qualifies as a malignant, measurablenode.  In this example, 20 mm should be 
recorded as the node measurem ent.  All other pathological nodes (those with short axis %10 mm 
but &15mm) should be considered non-target lesions.  Nodes that have a short axis of &10 mm 
are considered non-pathological and should not be recorded or followed. Lesions irradiated within 3 weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 may not be counted as target lesions.
1RQ7DUJHW/HVLRQV
All other lesions (or sites of disease), including pathological lymph nodes, should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline.  Measurements are not required.
It is possible to record multiple non-target lesion s involving the same organ as a single item on 
the Case Report Form (CRF) (e.g., “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple liver metastases”). 
After baseline, changes in non-tar get lesions will contr ibute only in the assessment ofcomplete 
response (i.e., a complete response is attained only with the complete disappearance of all tumor lesions, including non-target lesions) and will not be used toassess progressive disease. 
1HZ/HVLRQV
During the study, all new lesions identified and recorded after baseline must be 
assessed at all tumor assessment timepoints.  New lesions will also be evaluated for measurability with use of the same criteria applied to prospective target lesions at baseline per RECIST, (e.g., nonlymph node lesions must be 10mm; see note for new lymph node lesions below).  Up to a maximum of five new lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ), all with measurements at all timepoints, can be 
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd
Protocol MO29518 , Version 8 146Appendix 3
Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (cont.)
included in the tumor response evaluation.  New lesion types that would not qualif y as 
target lesions per RECIST cannot be included in the tumor response evaluatio n.
New lesions that are not measurable at first appearance but meet measurability criteria 
at a subsequent timepoint will be measured from that point on and contribute to the 
sum of longest diameters (SLD), if the maximum number of 5 measurable new lesions
being followed has not been reached.
CALCULA TION OF SUM O F THE DIA METERS 
A sum of the diam eters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) forall target 
lesions will be calculated as a measure of tumor burden.  
The sum of the diamete rs is calculated at baseline and at each tumor assessment for the purpose 
of classification of tumor responses.
Sum of the Diameters at Baseline :  The sum of the diam eters for all target lesions identified at 
baseline prior to treatment on Day 1.
Sum of the Diameters at Tumor Assessment :  For ever y on-study  tumor assessment collected 
per protocol or as clinically indicated, the sum of the diameters at tumor assessment will be 
calculated using tumor imaging scans.  All target lesions and all new measurable lesions that 
have emerged after baseline will contribute to the sum of the diam eters at tumor assessment.  
Hence, each net percentage change in tumor burden per assessment with use of modified 
RECIST accounts for the size and growth kinetics of both old a nd new lesions as they appear. 
Note:  In the case of new lymph nodes, RECIST v1.1 criteria for measurability (equivalent to baseline 
target lesion selection) will be follow ed.  That is, if at first appearance the short axis of a new lymph node 
lesion 15mm, it will be considered a measureable new lesion and will be tracked and included in the 
SLD.  Thereafter, the lymph node lesion will be measured at subsequent timepoints and measurements will 
be included in the SLD, even if the short axis diameter decr eases to 15 mm (or even 10mm).  However, 
if it subsequently decreases to 10 mm, and all other lesions are no longer detectable (or have also 
decreased to a short axis diameter of 10 mm if lymph nodes), then a response assessment of CR may be 
assig ned.
If at first appearance the short axis of a new lymph node is 10 mm and 15 mm , the lym ph node w ill not 
be considered measurable but will still be considered a new lesion. It will not be included in the SLD unless 
it subsequently becomes measurable (short axis diameter  15 mm).
The appearance of new lymph nodes with diameter 10 mm should not be considered pathological and not 
considered a new  lesion.
RESPONSE CRITERIA
Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR):  Disappearance of all target lesions.  Lymph nodes that shrink to 
10 mm short axis are considered normal.
Partial Response (PR):  At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of all target and all 
new measurable lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diam eters, in the absence of 
CR.
Note:  The appearance of new measurable lesions is factored into the overall tumor burden but 
does not automatically qualify  as progressive disease until the sum of the diameters increases by 
20% when compared with the sum of the diameters at nadir.
Atezolizumab —F. Hoffmann- La Roche Ltd
Protocol MO29518 , Version 8 147Appendix 3
Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Soli d Tumors (cont.)
Stable Disease (SD):  Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualif y for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualif y for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of the diameters while on study.
Progressive Disease (PD):  At least a 20% increase in thesum of diameters of all target and all 
new measurable lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study  (nadir SlD; this includes 
the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study ).  In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the 
sum must also demo nstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. 
Impact of New Lesions on Modified RECIST
New lesions alone do not qualif y as progressive disease.  However, their contribution tototal 
tumor burden is included in the sum of the diam eters, which is used to determine the overall 
modified RECIST tumor response. 
EVALUATION OF BEST O VERALL RESPONSE USING MODIFIED RECI ST
TIMEPOINT RESPONSE
It is assumed that at each protocol -specified timepoint, a response assessment occurs.  Table 1
provides a summary  of the overall response status calculation at each timepoin t for patients who 
have measurable disease at baseline.
MISSING A SSESSMENTS AND NOT EVALUABLE DESIGNA TION
When no im aging/measurement is done at all at a particular timepoint, the patient is not evaluable 
(NE) at that timepoint.  If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an assessment, 
usually the case is also considered NE at that timepoint, unless a convincing argument can be 
made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not change the assigned time 
point response.  This w ould be most likely  to happen in the case of PD.  For example, if a patient 
had a baseline sum of 50 mm with three measured lesions and at follow -up only  two lesions were 
assessed but those gave a sum of 80 mm, the patient will have achieved PD status, reg ardless of 
the contribution of the missing lesion.

aWhen lymph nodes are included as target lesions, the % change in the sum of the

lymph node is defined as having a short axis of 10 mm.  Any pathological lymph nodes

The best overall resp onse according to modified RECIST is interpreted as below:
3. CR:  Complete disappearance of all tumor lesions (target and non-target) and no new 
measurable or unmeasurable lesions, confirmed by a consecutive assessment 4 weeks 
from the date first documente d.  All ly mph nodes short axes must be 10mm.
4. PR:  Decrease in the sum of the diam eters of all target and all new measurable lesions 30% 
relative to baseline, in the absence of CR, confirmed by a consecutive assessment 4 
weeks from the date first documented.   
5. SD: Criteria for CR, PR, and PD are not met.

Preexisting A utoimmune Diseases
Subjects should be carefully questioned regarding their history of acquired or congenital 
immune deficiencies or autoimmune disease. 
Subjects with any history of immune deficiencies or autoimmune disease listed in the 
table below are excluded from participating in the stud y
Possible exceptions to this exclusion could be subjects with a medical history of such 
entities as atopic disease or childhood arthralgias where the clinical suspicion of 
autoimmune disease is low.   Patients with a history of autoimmune -related 
hypothyro idism on a stable dose of thyroid replacement hormone may be eligible for this 
study.  In addition, transient autoimmune manifestations of an acute infectious disease 
that resolved upon treatment of the infectious agent are not excluded (e.g., acute Lyme 
arthritis). –
Patients with controlled Type 1 diabetes mellitus on a stable insulin regimen are eligible. 
Patients with eczema, psoriasis, lichen simplex chronicus, or vitiligo with dermatologic 
manifestations only (e.g., patients with psoriatic arthritis would be excluded) are 
permitted provided that they meet the following conditions:
1. Rash must cover less than 10% of body surface area (BSA).
2. Disease is well controlled at baseline and only requiring low potency topical 
steroids.
3. No acute exacerbations of underlying condition within the previous 12 months 
(not requiring PUVA [psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation], methotrexate, retinoids, 
biologic agents, oral calcineurin inhibitors, high potency or oral steroids) 
Please contact the Medical Monitor regarding any uncertainty over autoimmune 
exclusions.

Prostate Response Evaluation Criteria
PROSTA TE-SPECIFIC A NTIGEN A SSESSMENT
Prostate -specific antigen (PSA) Assessment will be evaluated according to the 
recommendations of the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PC WG2)1with modification
PSA complete response is defined as a PSA concentration < 0.5 ng/mL for two 
consecutive measurements separated by at least 3 weeks
PSA response will be defined as a PS A concentration < 50% of the PSA reference 
value occurring at any time after treatment is initiated. The PSA reference value will 
be the PSA concentration measured immediately prior to treatment
PSA decrease of ≥ 30% from baseline by W eek 12 will also be a ssessed
PSA progression is defined as follows:
–In patients where no decrease in PSA from baseline is documented, PSA 
progression is a ≥ 25% increase from the baseline value along with an increase 
in absolute value of 2ng/mL or more after 12 weeks of treatm ent. It should be 
confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later
–In patients whose PSA nadir is < 100% of the baseline value, PSA progression 
is≥ 25% increase from the nadir and an absolute increase of 2 ng/mL or more 
from the nadir, confirmed by a second value obtained 3 or more weeks later
RADIOGRA PHIC ASSESSM ENT
Bone lesions
–Progression is defined as the appearance of two or more new lesions
–Progression should be confirmed by a repeat measurement at least 6 weeks 
later demonstrating additional new lesions
Soft tissue lesions
–Soft tissue lesions should be assessed according to the modified Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria v. 1.1
Patients should be kept on study until no longer experiencing clinical benefit as 
determined by the investigator and an effort should be made not to discontinue therapy 
solely on the basis of an increase in PSA in the absence of other indicators of disease 
progression.

Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma Response Evaluation Criteria
RATIONA LE
The major problems in applying the RECIST criteria to malignant pleural mesothelioma 
are in the interpretation of the meaning and placement of the "longest uni -dimensional 
diameter" of the target tumor mass to be measured. 
The longest diameter of a tumor mass is frequently that which follows the inner curve of 
the chest wall.  Defining the limits of such a diameter is often problematical. 
When the tumor regresses with treatment, the line may cross an area outside the tumor 
margin because of the curve of t he chest wall.  This may produce difficulty with 
reproducibility of measurement.  Furthermore, the longest tumor diameter may be 
between two fixed structures, such as the thoracic vertebrae and the carina, and 
measurement in these areas may not fully refle ct tumor response. 
MODIFIED RECIST FOR MALIGNA NT PLEURA L ME SOTHELIOMA
Modified RECIST criteria have been published with particular reference to malignant 
pleural mesothelioma (Byrne and Nowak, 2004)1:
Response to treatment is evaluated by measuring uni- dimensional tumor thickness 
perpendicular to the chest wall in 2 positions at 3 different levels on CT.  The sum of 
these 6 measurements is defined as the pleural uni -dimensional measure
Transverse cuts at least 1 cm apart and related to anatomical landmarks in the 
thorax were chosen to allow reproducible assessment at later time points
If a measurable tumor was present, transverse cuts in the upper thorax, above the 
level of the main bronchi division were preferred
At reassessment, pleural thickness was meas ured at the same position and at the 
same level by the same observer. This measurement did not necessarily represent 
the greatest tumor thickness at the level
Nodal, subcutaneous, and other bi -dimensionally measurable lesions were 
measured uni -dimensionall y based on the RECIST criteria
Uni-dimensional measurements were included to obtain the total tumor 
measurement
A confirmed response required repeat observation on 2 occasions 4 weeks apart

Risks Associated with A tezolizumab and Guidelines for 
Management of A dverse Events A ssociated w ith Atezolizumab
Toxicities associated or possibly associated with atezolizumab treatment should be 
managed according to standard medical practice.  Additional tests, such as autoimmune 
serology or biopsies, should be used to evaluate for a possible immunogenic etiology.
Although most immune -mediated adverse events observed with immunomodulatory 
agents have been mild and self -limiting, such events should be recognized e arly and 
treated promptly to avoid potential major complications.  Discontinuation of atezolizumab 
may not have an immediate therapeutic effect, and in severe cases, immune- mediated
toxicities may require acute management with topical corticosteroids, syst emic 
corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive agents. 
The investigator should consider the benefit risk balance a given patient may be 
experiencing prior to further administration of atezolizumab.  In patients who have met 
the criteria for permanent di scontinuation, resumption of atezolizumab may be 
considered if the patient is deriving benefit and has fully recovered from the immune -
mediated event.  Patients can be re -challenged with atezolizumab only after approval 
has been documented by both the investigator (or an appropriate delegate) and the 
Medical Monitor. 
DOSE MODIFICA TIONS 
There will be no dose modifications for atezolizumab in this study.
TREA TMENT INTERRUPTI ON
Atezolizumab treatment may be temporarily suspended in patients experiencing toxi city 
considered to be related to study treatment.  If corticosteroids are initiated for treatment 
of the toxicity, they must be tapered over 1month to 10mg/day oral prednisone or 
equivalent before atezolizumab can be resumed.  If atezolizumab is withheld for 
105days after event onset, the patient will be discontinued from atezolizumab.  
However, atezolizumab may be withheld for 105days to allow fo r patients to taper off 
corticosteroids prior to resuming treatment.  Atezolizumab can be resumed after being 
withheld for 105days if the Medical Monitor agrees that the patient is likely to derive 
clinical benefit.  Atezolizumab treatment may be suspen ded for reasons other than 
toxicity (e.g., surgical procedures) with Medical Monitor approval.  The investigator and 
the Medical Monitor will determine the acceptable length of treatment interruption.

endocrine events are provided in Table 4 .
Patients with unexplained symptoms such as headache, fatigue, myalgias, impotence, 
constipation, or mental status changes should be investigated for the presence of thyroid, 
pituitary, or adrenal endocrinopa thies.  The patient should be referred to an 
endocrinologist if an endocrinopathy is suspected.  Thyroid -stimulating hormone (TSH) 
and free triiodothyronine and thyroxine levels should be measured to determine whether 
thyroid abnormalities are present.  Pituitary hormone levels and function tests (e.g., TSH, 
growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle -stimulating hormone, testosterone, 
prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] levels, and ACTH stimulation test) and 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (with detailed pituitary sections) may 
help to differentiate primary pituitary insufficiency from primary adrenal insufficiency.

IMMUNE -MEDI ATEDMYOC ARDITIS
Immune -mediated myocarditis has been associated with the administration of 
atezolizumab.  Immune -mediated myocarditis should be suspected in any patient 
presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of myocarditis, including, but not limited to, 
laboratory (e.g., B -type natriuretic peptide) or cardiac imaging abnormalities, dyspnea, 
chest pain, palpitations, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or syncope.  Immune -
mediated myocarditis needs to be distinguished from myocarditis resulting from infection 
(commonly viral, e.g., in a patient who reports a recent history of gastrointestinal illness), 
ischemic events, underlying arrh ythmias, exacerbation of preexisting cardiac conditions, 
or progression of malignancy.  
All patients with possible myocarditis should be urgently evaluated by performing cardiac 
enzyme assessment, an ECG, a chest X -ray, an echocardiogram, and a cardiac MR I as 
appropriate per institutional guidelines.  A cardiologist should be consulted.  An 
endomyocardial biopsy may be considered to enable a definitive diagnosis and 
appropriate treatment, if clinically indicated.
Patients with signs and symptoms of myocard itis, in the absence of an identified 
alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in Table 6.

INFUSION -RELA TED REA CTIONS
No premedication is indicated for the administration of Cycle 1 of atezolizumab.  
However, patients who experience an infusion -related reaction (IRR) with Cycle 1 of 
atezolizumab may receive premedication with antihistamines or antipyretics/analgesics 
(e.g., acetaminophen) for subsequent infusions.  Metamizole (dipyrone) is prohibited in 
treating atezolizumab -associated IRRs because of its potential for causing 
agranulocytosis.
Guidelines for medical management of IRRs during Cycle 1 are provided in Table 7 .  For
subsequent cycles, IRRs should be managed according to institutional guidelines.
Table 7Management Guidelines for Infusion- Related Reactions
Event Management
IRR, Grade 1 Reduce infusion rate to half the rate being given at the time of 
event onset.
After the event has resolved, the investigator should wait for 30 
minutes while delivering the infusion at the reduced rate.
If the infusion is tolerated at the reduced rate for 30 minutes after 
symptoms have re solved, the infusion rate may be increased to 
the original rate.
IRR, Grade 2 Interrupt atezolizumab infusion.
Administer aggressive sy mptomatic treatment (e.g., oral or IV 
antihistamine, anti -pyretic medication, glucocorticoids, 
epinephrine, bronchodilators, oxygen).
After sy mptoms have resolved to baseline, resume infusion at half 
the rate being given at the time of event onset.
For subsequent infusions, consider administration of oral 
premedication with antihistamines, anti -pyretics, and/or analgesics 
and monitor closely for IRRs.
IRR, Grade 3 or 4 Stop infusion.

Immune -mediated myositis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab.  
Myositis or inflammatory myopathies are a group of disorders sharing the common 
feature of inflammatory muscle inju ry; dermatomyositis and polymyositis are among the 
most common disorders. Initial diagnosis is based on clinical (muscle weakness, muscle 
pain, skin rash in dermatomyositis), biochemical (serum creatine kinase increase), and 
imaging (electromyography/MRI) features, and is confirmed with a muscle biopsy.
Patients with signs and symptoms of myositis, in the absence of an identified alternate

myositis ,Grade 4Permanently discontinue atezolizumab and contact Medical 
Monitor.c
Refer patient to rheumatologist or neurologist.
Initiate treatment as per institutional guidelines.
Respiratory support may be required in more severe cases.
Initiate treatment with corticosteroids equivalent to 
12mg/kg/day IV methylprednisolone ,or higher -dose bolus if 
patient is severe lycompromise d (e.g., cardiac orrespirator y
symptoms, dysphagia , or weakness that severely limits 
mobility); convert to 1 2mg/kg/day oral prednisone or 
equivalent upon improvement.
If event does not improve within 48 hours after initiating 
corticosteroids, consider adding an immunosuppressive agent.
If event resolves to Grade 1 or better, taper corticosteroids 
over  1month.
aAtezolizumab may  be withheld for a longer period of time (i.e., 12 weeks after 
event onset) to allow for corticosteroids (if initiated) to be reduced to the equivalent 
of10mg/day oral prednisone.  The acceptable length of the extended period of 
time must be agreed upon by the investigator and the Medical Monitor.
bIf corticosteroids have been initiated, they must be tapered over 1 month to the 
equivalent of 10mg/day oral prednisone before atezolizumab can be resumed.
cResumption of atezolizumab may be considered in patients who are deriving benefit 
and have fully recovered from the immune -mediated event.  Patients can be 
re-challenged with atezolizumab only after approval has been documented by both 
the investigator (or an appropriate delegate) and the Medical Monitor.

HEMOPHA GOCYTIC LYMPH OHISTIOCYTOSIS A ND M ACROPHA GE 
ACTIVATION SYNDROME
Immune -mediated reactions may involve any organ system and may lead to 
hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS).  
Patients with suspected HLH should be diagnosed according to published criteria by 
McClain and Eckstein (2014).  A patient should be classified as having HLH if five of the 
following eight criteria are met:
Fever 38.5°C
Splenomegaly
Peripheral blood cytopenia consisting of at least two of the following:
–Hemoglobin 90g/L (9 g/dL) ( 100 g/L [10 g/dL] for infants 4 weeks old)
–Platel et count 100109/L (100,000/ L)
–ANC 1.0109/L (1000/L)
Fasting triglycerides 2.992 mmol/L (265 mg/dL) and/or fibrinogen 1.5g/L 
(150 mg/dL)
Hemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, lymph node, or liver
Low or absent natural killer cell activity
Ferritin 500mg/L (500 ng/mL)
Soluble interleukin 2 (IL- 2) receptor (soluble CD25) elevated 2 standard deviations 
above age- adjusted laboratory -specific norms
Patients with suspected MAS should be d iagnosed according to published criteria for 
systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis by Ravelli et al. (2016).  A febrile patient should be 
classified as having MAS if the following criteria are met:
Ferritin 684mg/L (684 ng/mL)
At least two of the follo wing:
–Platelet count 181109/L (181,000/ L)
–AST 48U/L
–Triglycerides 1.761 mmol/L (156 mg/dL)
–Fibrinogen 3.6g/L (360 mg/dL)
Patients with suspected HLH or MAS should be treated according to the guidelines in 
Table 14.

Suspected HLH 
or MASPermanently discontinue atezolizumab and contact Medical Monitor.
Consider patient referral to hematologist.
Initiate supportive care, including intensive care monitoring if 
indicated per institutional guidelines.
Consider initiation of IV corticosteroids and/or an immunosuppressive 
agent.
If event does not improve within 48 hours after initiating 
corticosteroids, consider adding an immunosuppressive agent.
If event resolves to Grade 1 or better, taper corticosteroids over 
1month.

Lung Cancer
Investigational Product(s), Dose and Mode of Adm inistration, Duration of Treatment with Investigational 
Product(s): Each subject will be administered an intravenous (IV) dose of BMS -986012 as monotherapy or in 
combination with nivolumab once every  21 days until meeting protocol -specified discontin uation criteria. With 
Amendment 02 prophylacti c premedication with a H1 blocker will be routinely administered prior to each 
BMS -986012 infusion as described in 
 Section 
 3.7
.
Study Phase : 1/2
Research Hypothesis: There is no formal prim ary research hypothesis for this study to be statistically tested. It is 
anticipated that BMS -986012 as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab will demonstrate adequate safety 
and tolerability at pharmacologically relevant dos es, so as to perm it further clinical development (at a recommended 
dose range).
Prim ary Objective: To determine the multidose safety, tolerability, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), and the 
maxim umtolerated dose (MTD) of BMS -986012 administered as monothe
 rapy
and in combination with nivolumab
in subjects w ith relapsed /refractory small cell lung cancer ( SCLC ).
Secondary Objectives:
To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BMS -986012 as monotherapy and in combination with 
nivolumab .
To investigate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of BMS -986012 as monotherapy and in combination with 
nivolumab as measured by objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, and progression -free survival 
(PFS).
To characterize the immunogenicity of BMS-986012 as mono therapy and in combination with nivolumab as 
well as immunogenicity of nivolumab in combination with BMS -986012
 .
To assess the effect of BMS -986012 as monotherapy and in combination with nivolumab on the QT interval. 
Exploratory Objectives:
To estimate th e trough concentrations of nivolumab in combination with BMS -986012.
To explore overall survival (OS).
  
  
  
Study Design: This is an open -label ,ascending multiple dose study of BMS -986012 administered once every 
21days (1cycle) as a single agent and in combination with nivolumab and will be conducted in 4parts. Dose 
escalation (BMS -986012 m onotherapy [ Part 1 ] and BMS -986012 and nivolumab com bination therapy [Part 3]) is to

Abbreviations: D= day ; EOT = end of treatment; Q3M = every 3 months; Y= year. 
*Subjects may receive additional cycles of treatment until protocol -specified discontinuation criteria are met. The 
DLT observation period pertains to Parts 1 and 3 ( dose escalation) only.
Subjects will complete up to 4 periods in the study: Screening (up to 28 days), Treatment (until meeting 
protocol -specified discontinuation criteria), Clinical Follow -up (approximately 100 days) ,and Survival Follow -up 
(up to approx imately 3 years follow ing end of treatment ). Screening and Treatment periods are calculated relative to 
the first dose of study drug. The Clinical Follow -up period begins 30 days (± 5 days) from the last dose of study 
drug,while the Survival Follow -up period occurs every 12 weeks (± 2 weeks) from the date of the 100

day Clinical 
Follow -up visit.
  
 
  
  
 
  
Each treatment cycle consists of an IV infusion of BMS -986012 monotherapy (Parts 1 and 2) or BMS -986012 and 
nivolumab combination therapy (Parts 3 and 4) once every 21 days. Tum or response will be assessed using 
Response Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tum ors version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1). Subjects will be allowed to continue 
treatment until documentation of progressive disease (except as indicated in Section 4.5.4 )or symptomatic 
deterioration, withdraw al of consent, unacceptable adverse events (AEs) , and/or meeting other protocol -specified 
criteria for discontinuation.
Subjects who receive other anti-cancer therapies during the Clinical Follow -up period will remain in Clinical 
Follow -up for the 100

12weeks (±2 weeks) from the date of the 100-day Clinical Follow -up visit (see Section 3.1). Subjects with stable 
disease, partial response ,or com plete response at the lastClinical Follow -up visit should undergo tumor assessments 
every 3to 4months during the Survival Follow -up period until progression . Subjects will be permitted to receive 
other anti-cancer therapies, including investigational agents, during all follow -up periods . Subjects who have started 
new anti-cancer therapi es or discontinued study due to progressive disease either during the Clinical Follow -up or 
Survival Follow -up periods will not undergo the computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI )
scans every 3 to4 months. The end of the study will occur after the last treated subject has been follow ed for at least 
6 months from his/her last treatment date.
Dose Escalation ( Parts 1 and 3):
BMS-986012 Monotherapy Dose Escalation (Part 1):
Enrollment in dose escalation and MTD selection will adhere to a modified Toxicity Probability Interval (mTPI) 
design, using cohorts of 3to 6 subjects within a dose level, and allowing flexible decision -making based on a 
minimum required cohort size. The design provides a simple algorithm for decisions on escalation, expa nding at the 
same dose level , and de-escalation, depending on the number of observed toxicities after each dose cohort. The 
mTPI w as selected over the rule based 3+3 design as the mTPI is m ore likely to select the true MTD and treat fewer 
subjects at subop timal doses. The m TPI m ethod utilizes a target toxicity (DLT) rate and equivalence interval (EI) to 
make decisions on escalation after each cohort and to estimate the MTD. For this study ,the target DLT rate is 25% 
(EI [24%, 27%]). A total of approximately 30 evaluable subjects will be treated across the proposed dose levels as 
shown in Table -1. Doses interm ediate to those specified may be evaluated if agreed upon by the Sponsor/Medical 
Monitor and investigators, provided the dose escalation increments are smaller than those specified. No intra -subject 
dose escalation of BMS -986012 is allow ed at any dose level.
Dose escalation begins with Dose Level 1 and will be guided by the number of DLTs observed in 3to 6 subjects 
treated initially per dose cohort and evaluable for safety for at least 28 days; additional subjects may be enrolled in 
cohorts of 3 to the same dose level if needed. If a decision to treat more subjects at a given dose level is specified by 
the mTPI algorithm when there are already at least 13 DLT evaluable subjects treated at the same dose level or a 
total of 30DLT evaluable subjects treated at all dose levels , the dose escalation period will be stopped. To m inimize 
risks to subjects from unanticipated acute toxicities, a waiting period of at least 5 days will occur between 
administrations of the first dose for the first, second, and third subjects to create an observation period prior to 
subsequent subject exposures. This w aiting period is mandatory only in Cohort/ Dose Level 1. 
Decisions toescalate, add more subjects to the current dose level , de-escalate, or de -escalate and declare the current 
dose level as unacceptable (exceeding the MTD) will be based on the rate of DLTs in evaluable subjects within the 
28-day DLT evaluation period (Figure 2). DLT evaluable subjects are defined as those receiving 2 doses of study 
drug in the first 28 days of dosing. At least 3 DLT evaluable subjects are required to enable a decision to escalate, 
add more subjects to the current dose level, or de -escalate.
Figure 2 shows examples of scenarios guiding decision making that may be encountered during dose escalation with 
respect to the number of DLT evaluable subjects and the number of subjects w ith a DLT. All potential combinations 
of the number of DLTs and number of treated subjects evaluable for DLT are shown in Appendix 4. In addition to 
escalation or expansion decisions, dose re -escalation is permitted as per Figure 2and Appendix 4after a decision to 
de-escalate is made, except when a dose level has been identified as exceeding the MTD. Therefore, a dose level 
could be revisited multiple times under the mTPI design.

below . BMS- 986012 w ill be evaluated starting at 400 mg (Com bination Dose Level 1). If safety and tolerability are 
established at 400 mg, Combination Dose Level 2 will be opened at 1000 mg. If toxicity is unacceptable at 
Com bination Dose Level 1, additional combination dose level(s) may be evaluated using BMS -986012 dose of 
160mg and/or nivolumab dose of 240 mg Q3W. Selection of dose level for each study drug will be based on the 
nature and attribution of observed DLTs in previously evaluated dose levels . If toxicity is acceptable at Combination 
Dose Level 1 but unacceptable at Combination Dose Level 2, an intermediate dose level of BMS -986012 and/or 
nivolumab dose of 240 mg Q3W may be evaluated in additional cohort(s). The intermediate dose level of BMS-
986012 w ill be selected based on combination therapy safety and available PK data. 
Dose escalation with BMS -986012 and nivolumab combination therapy will follow similar guidelines as described 
above for Part 1. AmTPI design similar to that described for BMS -986012 monotherapy will guide dose escalation 
decisions . This design will use a target DLT rate of 29% (EI [ 28%,31%])forthe combination setting and the mTPI
Bayesian model and posterior inference toguide escalation decisions .The num ber of subjects in the initial cohort of  
each dose level will be 3 to 4. Decisions to escalate to the next dose level, expand (add more subjects to) the current 
dose level, or de-escalate will be guided by the number of DLTs observed, out of the total number of evaluable 
subjects at a current dose level, according to the design algorithm shown in Table 3.1.1.2 -1.Enrollment of additional 
cohorts at the same dose level will proceed in sample sizes of 2to4 subjects. Subsequent dose levels will follow 
similar cohort enrollment size and decision rules.
To minimize risks to subjects from unanticipated acute toxicitie s, in all dose levels evaluated, at least 5days must 
elapse betw een administration of the first dose for the first and second subjects to allow  observation prior to 
subsequent exposures . In all Com bination Dose levels, multiple subjects within a cohort will not be perm itted to 
receive the initial dose of study drugs on the same day. Subjects must be clinically observed for at least 4 hours 
following the first 2doses BMS -986012 and nivolumab combination therapy (ie,Cycles1 and 2) and for at least 1 
hour following doses beyond the first 2 doses of combination therapy (ie, Cycle 3 and beyond) .
At the end of the BMS -986012 and nivolumab combination therapy dose escalation period , the cumulative number 
of subjects who experience a DLT at each dose level will be used to estimate the MTD of BMS -986012 in 
combination with nivolumab using isotonic regression. The MTD will be selected as the dose level with the smaller 
difference of estimated toxicity rate and the target DLT rate, among the dose level s explored .
Safety, including AEs occurring beyond the DLT observation period and available PK data, will also be considered 
in determining the recommended dose regimen of BMS -986012 and nivolumab to be administered in combination in 
Part 4. The dose regimen in Part 4may be at or below  the MTD of BMS -986012 and nivolumab combination 
therapy.
Dose -Limiting Toxicity
For the purpose of guiding dose escalation, DLTs will be determined based on the incidence, intensity , and duration 
of AEs occurring within 28 days of initiation of study drug (ie, the DLT evaluation period) for which no alternative 
cause can be identified. See Figure 2 and Appendix 4for details of the mTPI dose escalation algorithm. The severity 
of AEs will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse 
Events version 4.03 (CTCAE v4.03). AEs occurring after the 28-day DLT evaluation period will be considered to 
represent DLTs for the purposes of definin g the MTD upon agreem ent between the Sponsor/Medical Monitor, and 
investigators, if they are determined to have no clear alternative cause and are not related to disease progression.
Subjects must receive 2 doses of study drug during the 28 -day DLT evaluat ion period to be considered evaluable for 
dose escalation decisions. 
No intra-subject dose escalation is allowed. In the dose escalation period (Parts 1 and 3), subjects with insufficient 
data to establish safety during the DLT evaluation period at the cu rrent dose level may be replaced depending on the 
total number of DLT evaluable subjects at that dose level and the number of observed DLTs, and upon agreement of 
the Sponsor/Medical Monitor in collaboration with the investigators. DLTs are defined in deta il in Section 3.1.3 . 
Dose Expansion (Part s 2and 4 ) 
BMS-986012 Monotherapy Dose Expansion (Part 2)
BMS -986012 monotherapy dose level s selected for the dose expansion period (Part 2)will not exceed the MTD or

relapsed follow ing first-line chem otherapy as follows: ( Table 2)  Cohort A:≤90days response duration (refractory) 
at or below  the MTD/MAAD, Cohort B:≤90days response duration (refractory) at a dose level below the 
MTD/MAAD, Cohort C:>90days response duration (sensitive) at or below  the MTD/MAAD, and Cohort D:
>90days response duration (sensitive) at a dose level below the MTD/MAAD. The response duration referenced 
above is relative to prior first -line therapy. Approximately 22refractory and 28 sensitive subjects will be treated per 
cohort. As additio nal safety and PK data become available, the dose level of opened expansion cohorts may be 
re-evaluated, and an alternate dose level may be selected. New ly selected dose level s will not exceed the 
MTD/MAAD. Subjects currently dosing at the previously selected dose level will be perm itted to continue at that 
dose level unless a protocol -specified dose modification (Section 4.5.1 ) is required. Enrollment will be guided by the 
Simon 2 -stage design framework (see Table 3 ).
Anti-tumor activity will be assessed in approximately the first 9 or 10 evaluable subjects treated in each 
monotherapy cohort, with the option to stop enrolling in a cohort without an initial anti-tumor activity signal. The 
number of subjects needed for the Stage 1 review is guided by a Simo n 2-Stage design, assuming a 25% desirable 
response rate (vs 10%) for refractory monotherapy cohort , and a 40% (vs 25%) for sensitive monotherapy cohort , 
with the following futility boundaries. After Stage 1 , if none of the f irst 9 evaluable subjects in the refractory cohort ,
or if 2 or fewer subjects of the first 10evaluable subjects in a sensitive cohort demonstrate clinical activity, 
enrollment in the cohort meeting criteria may not continue. As the expected time of respon se relative to dose 
initiation and the actual enrollment rate are unknown, it is expected that during the efficacy evaluation of subjects in 
Stage 1, more subjects may enroll and begin receiving treatment than the minimum needed for the Stage 1 
assessment. Therefore, the above numbers are approximate and enrollment will continue during the evaluation of the 
interim data.
Evaluation of toxicity events in the cohort expansions will be performed throughout enrollment. If the aggregate rate 
of toxicities meetin g DLT criteria exceeds 27% across all subjects treated in all monotherapy cohorts, the findings 
will be discussed and further enrollment may be interrupted. Depending on the nature and grade of toxicity and after 
assessing the risk/benefit ratio, additional subjects may be treated at, below , or interm ediate to a dose level 
previously found to be safe follow ing discussion by the Sponsor/Medical Monitor and investigators based on the 
available data. Selection of doselevel s for these additional cohorts will be guided by accumulated safety and 
efficacy data; modeling may also be used to explore potential dose -response relationships.

Follow ing each treatment cycle, the decision to treat a subject with additional cycles of study therapy will be based 
on assessment of toxicity and tumor assessment. Subjects will generally be allowed to continue study therapy until 
the subject meets protocol -specified criteria for discontinuation of study therapy as outlined in Section 3.5.
BMS-986012 and Nivolum ab Combination Therapy Dose Expansion (Part 4)
Part 4 will evaluate toxicity and preliminary efficacy of BMS -986012 and nivolumab combination therapy as

Stage 1 review is guided by a Simon 2-stage design, assuming a 40% desirable response rate (vs 20%), with the 
following futility boundaries. After Stage 1, if clinical activity is demonstrated in 2 or fewer of the first 13 evaluable 
subjects, enrollment may not continue. As the expected time of response relative to dose initiation and the actual 
recruitment rate are unknown, it is expected that during the efficacy evaluation of subjects in Stage 1, more subjects 
may have been enrolled and receiving treatment than the minimum needed for the Stage 1 assessment. Therefore, 
the above numbers are approximate and enrollment will continue during the evaluation of the interim data (see Table 
3).
Evaluation of toxicity events in the cohort expansions will be performed throughout enrollment. If the aggregate rate 
of toxicities meeting DLT criteria exceeds 31% across all subjects treated in combination, the findings will be 
discussed and further enrollment may be interrupted. Enrollment may proceed at or below  a dose level of BMS -
986012 previously found to be safe. This may inclu de an intermediate dose level. Selection of the dose level will 
depend on the nature and grade of toxicities and assessment ofthe risk/benefit ratio.A lower dose level of 
nivoluma b (240 mg Q3W) may also be selected. Decisions will be made by the Sponsor/Medical Monitor, in 
collaboration w ith the investigators as indicated above in Part 2 .  
Duration of Study : The screening period will last up to 28 days. Subjects will receive BMS -986012 as 
monotherapy or in combination with nivolumab every  21 days until meeting protocol -specified criteria for 
discontinuation. The Clinical Follow -up period will be approximatel y 100days following the last dose of study 
drug, including subjects discontinuing the study for disease progression unless subjects have withdrawn consent. 
After completing the Clinical Follow -up period, subjects will continue to be follow ed for overall survival up to 3 
years from end of treatment. Subjects with stable disease, partial response ,or com plete response at end of treatm ent 
will also undergo tumor assessment every 3to 4 months during the follow -up period suntil progression . The end of 
the study will occur after the last treated subject has been followed for at least 6 months from his/her last treatment 
date.
Number of Subjects : During the BMS -986012 monotherapy dose escalation period (Part 1), up to approximately 
30evaluable subjects were expected to be treated. Although the exact number per dose level depends on the number 
of observed toxicities, approximately 3to 9subjects wereexpected to be evaluated in each dose level during dose 
escalation.  Inthe BMS -986012 monotherapy dose expansion period (Part 2), approximately 100evaluable subjects 
will be treated. During the dose escalation period with BMS -98601 2 and nivolumab combination therapy (Part 3), 
approximately 12evaluable subjects are expected to be treated at 2dose level s of BMS -986012 and nivolumab 
combination therapy . In the BMS -986102 and nivolumab combination therapy dose expansion period (Part 4), 
approximately 30evaluable subjects will be treated. Approximately 230subjects are estimated to be enrolled in this 
study, including subjects screened but not meeting eligibility criteria and subjects treated but requiring replacement. 
Additional subjects may be enrolled in escalation or expansion cohorts, if needed to main tain a sufficient number of 
subjects evaluable for safety or anti -tumor activity.
Study Population : Men and women at least 18 years of age orthelocal age of majority with histological or 
cytological confirmed pulmonary SCLC and Eastern Cooperative Oncolo gy Group Performance Status 0to 1 and 
meeting all other eligibility criteria may participate in the study. Subjects must not have central nervous system
metastases , unless they are controlled and treated as outlined in the exclusion criteria. All SCLC subjects must have

Study Assessments:
Safety Outcom e Measures : Adverse events will be assessed during treatment and until 100 days after the last 
treatment. Serious adverse events (SAEs) will be collected from the time a subject signs informed consent and for 
approximately 100 days after the last treatment. Adverse events will be coded using the most current version of 
Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities and reviewed for potentia
 l 
significance and importance. AEs will be 
evaluated according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.03. Subjects should be follow ed until all AEs for which no clear 
alternative cause is identified other than to study treatment have recovered to baseline or are deemed irreversible by 
the investigator. Safety assessments will be based on medical review  of AEreports and the results of vital sign 
measurements, physical examinations , andclinical laboratory tests. Serial electrocard iogram s (ECGs) (reviewed by 
a central laboratory) will be collected from a minimum of 77subjects across doses (including BMS -986012 
monotherapy and BMS -986012 and nivolumab combination therapy) with most subjects at the MTD (MAAD) to 
measure QT, other ECG intervals ,and heart rate to explore the potential effect of study drug on QTc. 
Pharm acokinetic Measures : The follow ing PK measures will be taken according to the times for each study Part, 
as detailed in Section 5.5: maximum observed concentration (Cmax), time of maximum observed concentration 
(Tmax), observed serum concentration at the end of a  dosing interval (Ctau ), area under the concentration -time 
curve from time zero to the time of the l ast quantifiable concentration ( AUC [0-t]), area under the concentration -time 
curve over the dosing interval (AUC [TAU]), total body  clearance (CLT), trough observed serum concentration 
(Ctrough ), volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), average concentration over a dosing interval (Css-avg), 
accumulation index ( AI)(for AUC [TAU],Cmax ,and Ctau), and effective elimination half -life ( T-HALFeff ).  
Efficacy Measures : Disease assessments using CT and/or MRI as appropriate, will be performed at baseline and 
every 6 weeks (every 2 cycles) until disease progression or as planned per protocol. Tumor responses will be 
determined by the investigator for subjects with adequa
 te 
data as defined by RECIST v1.1. At the Sponsor’s 
discretion, de-identified scans and measurements may be collected and reviewed by independent radiologists using 
RECIST v1.1 criteria at a later date, or at any time during the study.
Immunogenicity Measu res: Serum samples to evalua te development of positive anti-drug antibody (ADA) 
response to BMS -986012 and nivolumab will be collected at specified time points.

Statistical Considerations:
Sample Size:
Dose Escalation (Parts 1 and 3)
A total of approximately 30 evaluable subjects are expected to be treated during BMS -986012 monotherapy dose 
escalation (Part 1)and approximately 12evaluable subjects in BMS -986012 and nivolumab combination dose 
escalation , assuming 2 dose levels (Part 3). The exact num ber per dose level will depend on the number of observed 
DLTs andwill be guided by the escalation design thatselects asMTD the dose level with an estimated DLT rate 
closest to25% target DLT rate in monotherapy (Part 1) and the dose level with DLT rate closest to29% in 
combination therapy (Part 3) . Between 2 and up to 13 DLT evaluable subjects may be enrolled to a given dose level
in BMS -986012 monotherapy .Treating additional subjects beyond the 13 at the same dose level would be unlikely 
to alter the decision specified by the mTPI algorithm.
Dose Expansion (Parts 2 and 4)
The total sample size per each BMS -986012 monotherapy expansion cohort (approximately n =22 for refractory 
and approximately n =28for sensitive) is planned to provide a reasonable false positive rate (FPR) and false 
negative rate (FNR), based on assumptions of true (target) and historic ORR for each tumor as seen below. In 
addition to the FPR and FNR, the lower limit sof the confidence interval (CI) for ORR based on the Clopper -
Pearson method are provided below  by cohort.
For a refractory tumor dose expansion monotherapy cohort of 22 subjects and assum ing a true ORR of 25%, there is 
an84% chance of observing at least 4 responses, a 68% chance of observing at least 5 responses, and a 16% chance 
of observing 3 or fewer responses ( FNR ). If the true ORR is only  10% rather than 25%, then there is a 17% and 6% 
chance, respectively, that there will be at least 4 or at least 5 responses in 22 subjects (FPR). In addition, if 4 or 
5responses are observed, then the low er limit of the 80% CI for the ORR is 8.2% or 11.5%, respectively. 
For a sensitive tumor dose expansion monotherapy cohort of 28 subjects and assum ing atrue ORR of 40%,there is 
an85% chance of observing at least 9 responses, a 74% chance of observing at least 10 responses, and a 15% chance
of observing 8 or fewer responses (FNR ). If the true ORR for a tumor is only 25% rather than 40%, then there is a 
25% and 14% chance, respectively, that there will be at least 9 or at least 10 responses in 28 subjects (FPR). In 
addition, if 8 or 9 respons es are observed, then the lower limit of the 80% CI for the ORR is 17% or 20%, 
respectively.
In the combined sensitive and refractory monotherapy expansion cohort of 29 subjects and assuming a true ORR of 
40%,there is an 88
% 
chance of observing at least 9 responses, and a 12
% 
chance of observing 8 or fewer responses 
(FNR ). If the true ORR for a tumor is only 20% rather than 40%, then there is an 11
% 
chance and a 5% chance that 
there will be at least 
 9 
and at least 10 
 responses
,respectively ,in 29 subject s (FPR). In addition, if 10 or 11 responses 
are observed ,then the lower limit of the 80% CI for the ORR is 23
%
or 26%, respectively .
The Simon 2-stage (optim al) design will be used for the expansion cohorts . In monotherapy cohorts after a 
minimum of 9 subjects per refractory cohort and 10 subjects per sensitive cohort are treated in Stage 1,there will be 
an initial evaluation of efficacy, independently in each cohort. Similarly, in the BMS -986012 and nivolumab
combination therapy cohort (Part 4), after a minimum of 13 subjects are treated in the combination cohort 
 in Stage 
1,
there will bean initial evaluation of efficacy in this cohort . This will inform potential early decisions and guide 
planning/operations or early termination after taking into consideration additional data,for example , duration of 
response and/or stable disease and safety. The operational characteristics of this Simon 2-stage design are provided 
inTable 3 although not used for hypothesis testing.

aRefractory and Sensitive Subjects Combined
The number of subjects receiving treatment at the time of the Stage 1 efficacy evaluation is approximate and may 
exceed the specified minimum number of 9,10, or 13 due to time needed for radiological tumor measurement, the 
unknown time to response ,and the unknown true recruitment rate.
Endpoints:
Prim ary endpoint: 
Safety : The primary endpoint of this Phase 1/2 study is safety as measured by the rate of AEs, SAEs, AEs leading to 
discontinuations ,deaths, and clinically significant laboratory abnormalities. Safety will be evaluated from the time a 
subject signs informed consent and for up to 100 days afte r the last dose of study drug .
Secondary endpoints:
Efficacy:
The ORR, duration of response, and PFS will be assessed based on RECIST v1.1 criteria. In addition, PFS rates at 
pre-specified time points (eg,24, 36 weeks)will be assessed. Individual best overall response (BOR) will be a 
subject -level endpoint. The above will be determined based on tumor measurements occurring every 6 weeks during 
the Treatment period, and at approxim ately  the 100
-
day Clinical Follow -up visit, according to institutional practice. 
Subjects not progressing at discontinuation of study treatment will undergo tumor assessments every  3to 4 months 
or as per institutional practice until the date of the first objective documentation of tumor prog ression or death due to 
any cause. Overall survival and OS rate w ill be assessed as part of 
 exploratory efficacy 
analy sis.

findings and clinical laboratory results will be listed. ECG readings will be evaluated by the investigator and 
abnormalities, if present, will be listed.
For subjects with serial ECG measurements, changes in the QT interval Fridericia’s correction formula (QTcF )
(ΔQTcF), ECG intervals QRS, and PR, and in heart rate (ΔHR) will be tabulated by doselevel and study day. 
Scatter plots of heart rate, ΔHR, QTcF, and ΔQTcF versus time-matched BMS -986012 concentrations will be 
provided. A concentration -response effect of BMS-986012 on QTcF may be assessed by a  linear mixed effects 
regression model for ΔQTcF on serum BMS -986012 concentrations , stratified by study day, as well as poo led across 
days, for the BMS -986012 monotherapy and BMS -986012 and nivolumab combination therapy .
Efficacy Analyses
Individual BOR, duration of response and PFS will be listed using RECIST v1.1 criteria (Appendix 3). The ORR
and PFS rate (eg,at 24 weeks) will be tabulated by study period (escalation, expansion) and dose for each
BMS -981012 monotherapy dose expansion cohort (refractory or sensitive , Part 2), and the BMS -986012 and 
nivolumab combination therapy dose expansion cohort (Part 4). The CIswill be based on Clopper -Pearson method 
for ORR and using Greenwood formula for PFS rate. The duration of response and PFS will be estimated by 
Kaplan -Meier (K-M) methodology foreach expansion cohort (Parts 2 and 4). Overall survival will also be assesse d 
as part of exploratory efficacy analysis, by K-M plots and median OS as well as OS rates, at specified times (eg,at 6 
or 12 months)andwill be provided. Subjects from the same disease type in the expansion cohorts may be pooled, 
regardless of dose leve l, if deemed appropriate .

1 I NTRODUCTION AND STUDY RATIONA LE
1.1 Study Rationale
1.1.1 Lung Cancer
Lung cancer hasbeen themost common cancer intheworld forseveral decades, andin2012
there were anestimated 1.8million new cases, representing 12.9% of allnew cancers. Itisalso
themost common cause ofdeath from cancer, with 1.59 million deaths (19.4% ofthetotal).1
From 2004 through 2010 intheUnited States (US) ,theoverall 5-yearsurvival forlung cancer
was 16.8%.2IntheUSfor2014, thenumber ofnew cases oflung cancer was estimated tobe
224,210 andthenumber ofdeaths from lung cancer was 159,260; accounting for27% ofall
cancer deaths, more than anyother cancer. Approximately 57% ofpatients have metastatic
disease atdiagnosis, andinthese patients theprognosis ispoor; with a 5-yearsurvival lessthan
4%.2
These statisti csinclude small celllung cancer (SCL C),which hasaneven poorer prognosis.
SCLC accounts for12% to16% of alllung cancers intheUSA andEurope, andisdistinguished
byitsrapid growth rate, earlydissemination toregional lymph nodes anddistant sites, andits
sensitivity tochemotherapy andradiotherap y.3Patients with SCLC rarely survive more than a
few months without treatment. However, SCLCishighl yresponsive tomultiple
chemotherapeutic drugs, and chemotherap ydramatically prolongs survival compared tobest
supportive care.4Management ofSCLCdepends onthestage ofthe disease atdiagnosis.
Thestaging system most commonly used forSCLC istheVeterans Administration LungGroup
system, defining limited and extensive stage disease. Sixty  percent to 70% of patients have
extensive disease atdiagnosis.5Although American Joint Committee on Cancer TNM staging6
correlates with prognosis inSCLC,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19surgery isappropriate inlessthan
5% of patients. Most patients will receive chemotherap ywith orwithout radiation. SCLCisa
chemotherap y-sensitive disease, and70% to90% ofnewly -diagnosed patients will respond to
first-linetherap ychemotherap y.Regimens containing aplatinum andetoposide areoften chosen
asfirst-linetreatment inpatients with good performance status. However, median survival is9to 
11months andlong-term survival israre. Fewer than 5% of patients with extensive disease live
beyond 2 years,even with multi- agent, intensive treatment with multiple lines oftherap y.
Few new agents with activity inSCLChave been identified, andnone have been successful thus
farinPhase 3studies.
Fucos yl-GM1 (fuc-GM1) offers acellsurface target known tobeexpressed in70% of SCLC
tumors byimmunohistochemistry  (IHC) .20,21,22BMS -986012 isbeing developed forthe
treatment oflung cancer and this first-in-human study will evaluate safet y,tolerability ,and
preliminary efficacy asmonotherap yand,with Amendment 04,incombination with nivolumab
intheSCLCpopulation.

1.1.2 Fucosyl -GM1
Carbohy drate antigens arethemost abundantl yexpressed antigens onthesurface ofcancer
cells.23Gangliosides arecomplex glycosphingolipids that contain sialic acid andthatplay arole
incell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix interactions. They have also been implicated in
promoting cell proliferation, angiogenesis and immune tumor cell evasion. Antibodies to
gangliosides have been shown toinhibit tumor growth and toinduce apoptosis ofantigen
positive cells.24
Fucosylated-monosialotetrahexosy lganglioside (fuc- GM1 ) (fucos yl-α1-2Galβ1- 3GalNAcβ1-
4(NeuAcα2 -3)Galβ1 -4Glcβ1 -1Cer) isasphingolipid monosialoganglioside composed ofa
ceramide lipid component which anchors themolecule inthecellmembra neandacarboh ydrate
component which isexposed atthecellsurface (Figure 1.1.2-1 ).
Figure 1.1.2 -1: Structure ofFucosyl -GM1
1.1.3 Rationale forFucosyl -GM1 asaTarget Antigen
BMS -986012 isafirst-in-class fullyhuman immunoglobulin G(IgG) 1monoclonal antibody
(mAb) thatspecificall ybinds tothefuc-GM1 ganglioside. BMS -986012 isbeing developed for
thetreatment ofSCLC,asIHC analysisoftumor samples with anti-fuc-GM1 mAb has
demonstrated antigen expression inahigh percentage ofSCLCcases andlittle or no expression
innormal tissues.25,26,27,21,22BMS -986012 exhibits high-affinit yanddose-dependent saturable
binding tofuc-GM1 andshows nodetectable antigen -specific binding toclosely related molecule
monosialotetrahexosy lganglioside .BMS -986012 was optimized tohave enhanced effector
functions byelimination ofthefucosy lation onthefragment crystallizable (Fc) domain. The
absence ofthis fucos ylgroup inBMS -986012 (resulting from itsexpression inacell line
deficient infucos yltransferase) confers higher affinity forFcreceptors resulting inenhanced
antibody -dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC).28Furthermore, theantibody was shown to
mediate potent complement -dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) aswell asantibody -dependent

cellular phagocy tosis (ADCP). Please refer totheBMS -986012 Investigator Brochure (IB)for
further details.29
Clinical experience with targeting fuc-GM1 comes from some earlystudies inSCLCpatients
who were vaccinated with keyhole limpet hemocy anin -conjugated fuc-GM1. These patients
developed antibody titers tothis antigen. Ininvitro assay s,these antibodies demonstrated
specific binding totumor cells andCDC directed against fuc-GM1 positive celllines.30,31The
investigators have initiated afurther clinical trial totestapentavalent vaccine containing GD2L,
GD3L, Globo H,Fuc-GM1, and N-Propiony lated Polysialic Acid.32Vaccine associated
toxicities were mild andtransient and3patients with limited -stage SCLC were relapse -free at
18, 24, and30months.30,31
Fuc-GM1 hasbeen evaluated inmice bearing human SCLCtumors. Robust tumor -growth
inhibition (TGI )was demonstrated inmultiple xenograft models when mice were treated with
BMS -986012 asamonotherap y.When BMS -986012 was administered incombination with
cisplatin oretoposide, efficacy increased in5 out of 6 xenograft models. These invivo results
demonstrate that BMS -986012, asasingle agent, isapotent inhibitor ofhuman SCLCtumor
growth andcanimprove outcomes when combined with chemotherap y.33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42
1.1.4 Nivolumab Mechanism of Action
Cancer immunotherap yrests onthepremise thattumors canberecognized asforeign rather than
asselfandcanbeeffectively attacked byanactivated immune system. Aneffective immune
response inthissetting isthought torely on immune surveillance oftumor antigens expressed on
cancer cells that ultimately results inanadaptive immune response and cancer cell death.
Meanwhile, tumor progression may depend upon acquisition oftraits thatallow cancer cells to
evade immunosurveillance andescape effective innate andadaptive immune responses.43,44,45
Current immunotherap yefforts attempt tobreak theapparent tolerance of theimmune system to
tumor cells andantigens byeither introducing cancer antigens bytherapeutic vaccination orby
modulating regulatory checkpoints oftheimmune system. T-cell stimulation isacomplex
process involving theintegration ofnumerous positive ,aswell asnegative ,co-stimulatory
signals inaddition toantigen recognition bytheT-cellreceptor.46Collectively ,these signals
govern thebalance between T-cellactivation andtolerance.
Programmed cell death protein-1 ( PD-1)isamember oftheCD28 family of T- cell co-
stimulatory receptors thatalso includes CD28, CTL A 4, ICOS,andBTLA.47PD-1signaling has
been shown toinhibit CD-28-mediated upregulation ofinterleukin (IL)-2, IL-10, IL-13,
interferon (IFN) -γ,andBcl-xL.PD-1expression hasalso been noted toinhibit T-cellactivation
andexpansion ofpreviously activated cells. Evidence foranegative regulatory role ofPD-1
comes from studies ofPD-1 deficient mice, which develop avariety ofautoimmune
phenoty pes.48These results suggest thatPD-1blockade hasthepotential toactivate anti-selfT-
cellresponses, butthese responses arevariable anddependent upon various host genetic factors.
Thus, PD-1deficiency orinhibition isnotaccompanied byauniversal loss of tolerance toself-
antigens.

Invitro, nivolumab (BMS -936558) binds toPD-1with high affinit y(EC50 0.39 to2.62 nM) and
inhibits thebinding ofPD-1to its ligands programmed death -ligand (PD-L) 1 andPD-L2(half 
maximal inhibitory  concentration ± 1 nM). Nivolumab binds specifically toPD-1andnotto
related members oftheCD28 family such asCD28, ICOS,CTLA -4,andBTL A.Blockade ofthe
PD-1pathway bynivolumab results inareproducible enhancement ofboth proliferation and
IFN-γrelease inthemixed lymphocy tereaction. Using acytomegalovirus (CMV )re-stimulation
assay with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC ),theeffect ofnivolumab on
antigen specific recall response indicates thatnivolumab augmented IFN-γ secretion from CMV
specific memory Tcells inadose-dependent manner versus isoty pe-matched control. Invivo
blockade ofPD-1byamurine analog ofnivolumab enhances theanti-tumor immune response
andresult intumor rejection inseveral immunocompetent mouse tumor models (MC38, SA1/N,
andPAN02).49
1.1.5 Rationale forImmuno -oncology Therapeutic Approaches inSCLC
AnanalysisofPBMCs from SCLCpatients hasshown ahigher number of T- effector cells in
limited disease SCLCcompared with extensive disease SCLCsubjects andahigher T-effector to
T-regulator ratio inlong-term survivors ofSCLC .50InaPhase 2randomized study ,phased
ipilimumab (placebo +paclitaxel/carboplatin followed byipilimumab +paclitaxel/carboplatin)
showed improved progression -freesurvival (PFS) versus carboplatin andpaclitaxel (5.7 months
vs 4.6 months, hazard ratio = 0.72, P = 0.05.51Nivolumab atdoses of 1, 3, and10mg/kg has
been shown tobeeffective against non-small celllung cancer (NSCLC) inaPhase 1study (N=
122) with objective response rate (ORR s) of 6%, 27%, and17% andPFS rates at24 weeks of
25%, 44%, and31%.52,53
InaPhase 1/2study ofnivolumab with orwithout ipilimumab fortreatment of recurrent SCLC
(CA209032) ,subjects who were platinum sensitive orrefractory andhad progressive disease
(PD) were enrolled regardless oftumor PD-L1status ornumber ofprior chemotherap yregimens.
This open -label study randomized subjects tonivolumab 3mg/kg byintravenous (IV) infusion
every 2 weeks (Q2W) ornivolumab +ipilimumab (1+ 1mg/kg,1 + 3 mg/kg, or 3 + 1 mg/kg)IV
every 3weeks (Q3W) for4cycles,followed bynivolumab 3mg/kg Q2W. Theprimary objective
was ORR. Other objectives were safet y,PFS, overall survival (OS),andbiomarker analy sis.
Seventy -fivesubjects were enrolled (nivolumab, n = 40; nivolumab +ipilimumab, n =35); 59%
oftheenrolled subjects had atleast 2prior regimens. Drug -related adverse events (AEs) in
≥ 10% of subjects were fatigue (18%) ,diarrhea (13%) ,nausea (10%) ,anddecreased appetite
(10%) with nivolumab andfatigue (29%) ;diarrhea (17%) ;pruritus (14%) ;andnausea, endocrine
disorders ,andrash (11% each) with nivolumab +ipilimumab. Grade 3 or 4 drug-related AEs
with nivolumab occurred in7(18%) subjects (all inn = 1 [3%]: stomatitis, fatigue,
hypergly cemia, increased alanine aminotransferase ( ALT), increased gamma -glutamy l
transferase ,encephalitis, andinfusion- related reaction). Grade 3 or 4 drug-related AEs in≥ 5%
ofsubjects included diarrhea andrash (6% each inthenivolumab +ipilimumab arm).Drug -
related pneumonitis occurred in2subjects (1per arm). Limbic encephalitis was reported in2
subjects inthenivolumab arm and1subject inthenivolumab +ipilimumab arm. The event

treatment in1subject. Of40evaluable subjects treated with nivolumab, partial response (PR)
was seen in6(15%; duration ofongoing responses 80to251+ days);stable disease (SD) in9
(22.5%); andPDin25 (62.5%). Inconclusion, inthisPD-L1unselected ,heavil ypre-treated
SCLCpopulation including platinum -based first-line treatment, nivolumab treatment was well
tolerated. The ORR was 15% forsubjects with nivolumab with long lasting responses beyond
251days,allongoing atthetime ofthedata cutoff.
Considering theimmune response seen inSCLC patients, andtheresults ofcheckpoint inhibitors
nivolumab and ipilimumab inNSCL Cpatients, it is reasonable toexpect that nivolumab
monotherap yislikely toprovide benefit insecond -linetreatment ofSCLC.
1.1.6 Rationale forCombining BMS -986012 andNivolumab
BMS -986012 in combination with nivolum ab may provide clinical benefit to subjects with 
SCLC by combining the immune -based mechanisms of action (MOA) of both compounds. 
Although, syngeneic and genetically  engineered mouse models (GEMM) are current ly the best 
way to evaluate potential activity  of immuno -oncology  agents , there are few GEMMs in SCLC.  
Each of the SCLC GEMMs characterized to date has unique pathologic characteristics and it is 
unclear which, if any, best represents SCLC in general .54There have been no published studies 
to date of the utility  of these models for determining the activity  of immuno -oncology  agents 
such as PD-1 inhibitors nor for the combination of immuno -oncology  agents with other anti-
cancer therapies.  Additionally , fuc-GM1 tumor expression is currently unknown in these 
models. Therefore, no adequatel y characterized tumors in immune competent mice are available 
to determine pre-clinical efficacy . Internal evaluation to characterize 1GEMM SCLC mode l 
(Rb, p53, and p130 knock -out) has begun and demonstrated no observed adverse effects such as 
weight loss or death when BMS -986012 and nivolumab were administered in combination , 
supporting the potential safet y of this combination for clinical use.
Although pre-clinical efficacy has not been demonstrated due to a lack of adequatel y 
characterized models, potential areas of s ynergy include the following :
Providing antigens to antigen -presenting cells ( APCs )to induce T -cell activity :BMS -986012 
has been shown in pre-clinical models to lead to cancer cell death, including by ADCP. 
Processing and presentation of antigens by APCs,such as macrophages, has been shown to 
increase T-cell responses in tumor models. Furthermore , suboptimal tumor antigen delivery 
and presentation have been postulated as another mechanism by which tumors can 
successfull y evade immune system recognition. As nivolumab is known to increase T-cell 
activation, sy nergy  is expected via this mechanism .
Reducing tumor cell-derived immune inhibition: Tumors and tumor microenvironment are 
known to express a variety  of factors that impede a robust immune response from eliminating 
the tumor. Soluble and membrane -bound factors have been shown to inhibit the cytolytic 
activity  of tumor infiltrating T cells (eg, PD -L1 expression; transforming growth factor -beta). 
In addition, some tumor -derived factors are able to enhance immune system counter -
regulatory  systems (eg,increased T-regulatory cells). BMS -986012 monotherap y has 
demonstrated pre-clinical TGI and clinical activity including tumor reduction .29This anti-

tumor activity  may lead to reduced immune inhibition and synergi stic activity  withthe anti -
PD-1 effects of nivolumab.
Supporting immune -based MOA of BMS -986012: BMS -986012 demonstrated dose-
dependent ADCC and ADCP .29Because BMS -986012 acts via multiple immune cell-based 
mechanisms, enhancement of the overall immune activation via the T -cell stimulatory  effects 
of nivolumab m ay increase BMS -986012 anti -tumor activity . 
1.1.7 Rationale forBMS -986012 Dose
1.1.7.1 Rationale forBMS -986012 Monotherapy Starting Dose
The BMS -986012 monotherap ystarting dose of 70 mgwas chosen using both pre-clinical
toxicology andpharmacology studies. Theflatdose of 70 mgBMS -986012, which approximates
a 1mg/kgdose, is10-fold below themonkey no-observed -adverse- effect -level (NOAEL) and
150-fold below thehighest non-severel ytoxic dose (HNSTD), but within thepredicted
pharmacologically active dose range. Due tothewide margin between thepharmacologicall y
active dose range andtheHNSTD, weight-based dosing tominimize variation inexposure isnot
needed, buttheeffect ofbody weight onexposure willbeassessed inthisstudy .
1.1.7.2 Estimate ofBMS -986012 Monotherapy Human Pharmacologically Active
Dose
Pharmacologicall yactive doses were estimated byexploratory modeling and therapeutic
translation ofpre-clinical data. The therapeutic target response was setto90% tumor volume
regression insubjects with SCLCtoapproximate anear-complete response byResponse 
Evaluation Criteria for Solid Tumors (RECI ST)criteria. Apotentially therapeutic dose regimen
insubjects with SCLCranges 0.6to1mg/kgBMS -986012 administered IV in1 hour every 21
days;ispredicted toachieve 90% tumor volume regression. The 21-day dose interval was
selected tocoincide with standard ofcare chemotherap ydose regimens (potential combination
partners).
1.1.7.3 Estimate ofBMS -986012 Monotherapy First-in-Human Dose
Ina 1 month Good Laboratory Practices ( GLP )study (DM13026), 5male and 5female
cynomolgus monkey s(non-tumor bearing) per dose group received 10and 150 mg/kg
BMS -986012 IV over 3minutes every week for5doses.55Serum BMS -986012 concentrations
were measured atpre-determined times during theGLPstudy toestimate exposure. TheHNSTD
was150mg/kg BMS -986012 andtheNOAE Lwas10mg/kg. Pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling of
data from the10mg/kg dose group andallometric scaling methods with typical exponents were
used toproject linear clearance (4.3mL/h), half-life(T-HALF) (21days)and exposure in
humans.
The NOAEL estimated intheGLPtoxicology study inmonkey sdemonstrates safet yina
non-tumor bearing species, however, studies ofanti-tumor activity demonstrate pharmacologic
activity atdoses/exposures below theNOAEL. The starting dose inthisstudy (subjects with
SCLC)ispredicted saferelative totheNOAEL andpharmacologically active.

The first human dose estimate and dose escalation scheme are intended to minimize the number
of subjects exposed to subtherapeutic and toxic doses. Dose escalation increments are large
enough (half log units) to rapidly achieve full therapeutic activity and possibly identify a
maximally tolerated/feasible dose.
The first-in-human (FIH) dose is 70 mg (to approximate 1 mg/kg) BMS-986012 administered IV 
over 60 minutes every 21 days. This dose is predicted to result in human exposures 12 times
below the NOAEL exposure in cynomolgus monkeys ( Table 1.1.7.3-1 ). Subsequent doses to be
studied by escalating in approximate half log units (2.5 fold increases) are 160, 400, and
1000 mg (2.3, 5.7, 14.3 mg/kg, respectively, in a 70 kg subject). Estimated PK exposure with
corresponding safety margins (exposure multiple of NOAEL and HNSTD) are presented in

1.1.7.4 Rationale for BMS-986012 Dose in Combination with Nivolumab
There is no human experience combining BMS-986012 with nivolumab; therefore, rationale for 
the BMS-986012 dose is based on monotherapy clinical data. As of the last IB update (version
03, 23-May-2016, data cut-off date 05-Apr-2016),2938 subjects with SCLC have been treated
with BMS-986012 monotherapy IV at doses of 70, 160, 400 and 1000 mg Q3W during dose
escalation and expansion in the current study. No DLTs occurred during dose escalation, 
establishing 1000 mg Q3W as the maximum administered dose (MAAD). In the ongoing dose 
expansion, 400- and 1000-mg doses are being administered IV Q3W to subjects with relapsed or 
refractory SCLC after 1 prior line of therapy. All data summarized below is preliminary and is
subject to change.
AEs considered related to BMS-986012 and re ported in > 10% of subjects were pruritus 
(76.3%), eye pruritus (23.7%), vulvovaginal pruritus (21.1% of all subjects; 38.1% of females),

generalized pruritus (21.1%), decreased appetite (15.8%), and rash (10.5%). These events were 
all mild to moderate in nature. There does not appear to be an association between the dose of 
BMS -986012 and the incidence or grade of AEs. Two serious adverse events (SAEs) considered 
related to BMS -986012 have been reported to date. One episode of Grade 3 fatigue lasting 
7days occurred in 1subject at the 70-mg dose level. One episode of Grade 1fever lasting 1 day 
but leading to hospitalization occurred in 1 subject at the 400-mg dose level. No Grade 4 or 5 
events considered related to BMS -986012 have been reported. Seventeen deaths have occurred 
in treate d subjects; out of these, 16 were considered related to disease progression and 1 was due 
to pneumonia. No deaths related to BMS- 986012 have occurred.
As fuc-GM1 is expressed on peripheral nerve in humans, neuropathy  is considered a potential 
on-target AEof BMS -986012. While peripheral neuropathy  related to BMS -986012 has not been 
reported, there have been alterations in sensation including paresthesia and dysesthesia reported 
as related to BMS -986012. Two subjects experienced Grade 1 dysesthesia (400-and 1000- mg 
dose levels), and 3 subjects experienced Grade 1 paresthesia (1 subject in the 160-mg dose and 
2subjects in the 1000- mg dose levels). These changes did not appear related to dose, though 
subjects receiving 1000 mg of BMS -986012 did have longer d uration of sensory  changes.
No changes in chemistry  laboratory  values were reported to be related to BMS -986012. There 
were also no clinicall y significant changes in neutrophil, platelet, or red blood cell counts 
considered related to BMS -986012. Two-and 3-grade decreases in lymphocy te counts were 
observed in approximately  30% of subjects, but these changes were notreported as clinically 
significant AEs and therefore causality  cannot be established; the clinical significance of these 
changes is unclear at this time. The change in lymphocy te counts does not appear to correlate 
with dose of BMS -986012. Details of the laboratory findings are provided in the IB.29
Electrocardiogram (ECG) data, reported to date, do not suggest an y clinically  importa nt trends.
Clinical benefit has been observed in 6 subjects across all dose levels in both dose escalation and 
dose expansion. One subject in the 70-mg dose level had a confirmed complete response (CR)
that lasted for 53 weeks. One subject in the 400 -mg dose level had a confirmed PR that lasted for 
17weeks. Four subjects had stable disease in the 160 -, 400- , and 1000 -mg dose levels, ranging in 
duration from 12 to 30 weeks, with 1 subject ongoing at 24 weeks. 
Preliminary pharmacokinetic (PK) data areprovided inSection 1.4.4.1.
In summary , the clinical data to date suggest there is no clear association between the dose of 
BMS -986012 and the incidence or grade of related- AEs. Furthermore , preliminary  PK analysis 
shows a significant difference in exposure between the 400- and 1000- mg doses. Based onthese
data, combination dose escalation will proceed with 400and1000 mg(with a Dose Level -1 of 
160mg Q3W) of BMS -986012 for the BMS -986012 and nivolumab combination therap y.
1.1.8 Rationale forNivolumab “Flat” Q3 WDose

(PPK) analysis of data collected in these studies, together with PK data from several Phase 1, 2, 
and 3 clinical studies of nivolumab monotherapy  in solid tumors . The PPK modeling of available 
data, as detailed below, supports the use of a flat dose of 360 mg to facilitate combination dosing 
with BMS -986012 on a Q3W schedule. 
PPK analy seshave shown thatthePKofnivolumab islinear with proportional exposure over a
dose range of0.1to10mg/kg, andnodifferences inPKacross ethnicities andtumor typeswere
observed. The PK of nivolumab were studied in subjects over a dose range of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg 
administered as a single dose or as multiple doses of nivolumab every 2 or 3 weeks. The 
geometric mean (coefficient of varia tion [CV]%) clearance (CL) was 9.5 mL/h (49.7%), 
geometric mean volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) was 8.0L (30.4%), and geometric 
mean elimination T-HALF was 26.7 days (101%). Stead y-state concentrations of nivolumab 
were reached by 12weeks when administered at 3 mg/kg Q2W, and systemic accumulation was 
approximately  3-fold. The exposure to nivolumab increased dose proportionally  over the dose 
range of 0.1 to 10mg/kg administered Q2W . The clearance of nivolumab increased with 
increasing body  weight. The PPK analy sis suggested that the following factors had no clinically 
important effect on the CL of nivolumab: age (29 to 87 years), gender, race, baseline lactate 
dehy drogenase , PD-L1. A PPK analy sis suggested no difference in CL of nivolumab based on 
age, gender, race, tumor type, baseline tumor size, and hepatic impairment .Although Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology  Group (ECOG) status, baseline glomerular filtration rate, albumin ,and 
body  weight had an effect on nivolumab CL , the effect was not clinicall y meaningful.
AsthePKofnivolumab islinear, thecorresponding flatdose foraQ3W dosing regimen is
nivolumab 360mg.Using thePPK model developed, theexposures following administration of
several dosing regimens ofnivolumab administered asaflatdose were simulated, including
360mg administered Q3W. The simulated steady -state average concentration following
administration ofnivolumab 360 mgQ3W isexpected tobesimilar tothose following
administration ofnivolumab 3mg/kg Q2W tosubjects weighing 80 kg, theapproximate median
weight ofsubjects used inthePPK analyses.The predicted steady -state peak concentrations
following nivolumab 360 mg Q3W are predicted tobeless than those following the
administration ofnivolumab 10mg/kg Q2W providing sufficient safety margins. Currently ,
nivolumab isbeing studied asnivolumab 360mgcombined with platinum -doublet chemotherap y
administered Q3W forthetreatment ofNSCLC inaPhase 3study (Study  CA209 -227).
Therefore, nivolumab 360mgQ3W (with a Dose Level -1 of 240 mg Q3W) willbeexamined in
thecurrent study with BMS -986012.
1.1.9 Dose Escalation Design Rationale forBMS -986012 Monotherapy (Part 1)
andBMS -986012 andNivolumab Combination Therapy (Part 3)
Dose escalation will utilize a modified toxicity probability interval (mTPI) design.56Rationale
forselection of a mTPI over a 3 + 3 design include theability toenroll additional subjects to
better accommodate dropouts, treatment ofmore subjects atthemaximum tolerated dose (MTD)
and amore accurate determination ofMTD. The design provides asimple dose escalation
algorithm (Figure 3.1.1.1 -1and Table 3.1.1.2-1) thatincreases theaccuracy ofMTD selection
andtreats fewer subjects atsuboptimal doses.

1.1.10 Effect ofDrug onQTInterval forBMS -986012 Monotherapy and
BMS -986012 andNivolumab Combination Therapy
Inthisstudy ,theeffect ofBMS -986012 monotherapy and the combination of BMS -986012 and
nivolumab ontheQTinterval willbeevaluated. Pre-clinical evaluations didnotidentify asignal
indicating thatBMS -986012 may increase theQTinterval oraffect cardiac conduction. Similar
toother drugs inthis class, thelikelihood BMS -986012 directly orindirectly affects QTc
intervals islow. Despite the low risk, such evaluation isrequired during thedevelopment of a
therapeutic agent and the design ofthis study treating subje ctsacross 4 BMS -986012
monotherap ydoses iswell suited forthistype of evaluation. Anintensive QTsubstudy indicated
thatnivolumab monotherap yatdoses studies upto10mg/kg did notaffect theQTc interval or
other ECG findings.57During BMS -986012 monotherap ytreatment inthecurrent study , serial
ECGs (reviewed byacentral laboratory )will becollected with matching PKsamples from all
30subjects indose escalation period (Part 1)andatleast 20subjects treated across the2BMS -

1.4.1.2 Nivolumab
Single -dose PKofnivolumab were evaluated insubjects with multiple tumor typesinStudy
CA209001, whereas multiple -dose PKwas evaluated insubjects inStudy CA209003. Single -
dose PKofnivolumab was evaluated in39subjects with multiple tumor types inStudy
CA209001 inthedose range of 0.3 to10mg/kg. The median Tmax across single doses ranged
from 1.6to3hours with individual values ranging from 0.9to7hours. Geometric mean
maximum observed concentration (Cmax )and area under the concentration -time curve from 
time 0 to infinity  (AUC [INF]) of nivolumab administered atdosages of0.3,1, 3, and10mg/kg
demonstrated approximate dose proportionality .Geometric mean CLafter asingle IVdose
ranged from 0.13 to0.19 mL/h/kg, while mean volume ofdistribution during theterminal phase
(Vz) varied between 83to113 mL/kgacross doses. There was moderate variability inPK
parameters among subjects, with CVof 20% to32% inCmax, 39% to47% inAUC(INF), 17%
to43% inCL,and23% to40% inVz.Themean terminal elimination T-HALF ofnivolumab is
17to25days,which isconsistent with T-HALF ofendogenous IgG4,indicating that the
elimination mechanism ofnivolumab may besimilar toIgG4. Both elimination anddistribution
ofnivolumab appear tobeindependent ofdose inthedose range studied. Additional details are
provided intheIB.58
Inaddition, apreliminary PPK model wasdeveloped bynon-linear mixed effect modeling using
data from 350subjects from Studies CA209001, CA209002, andCA209003. CLofnivolumab is
independent ofdose inthedose range (0.1 to10mg/kg) andtumor typesstudied. The body
weight normalized dosing produces approximately constant trough concentrations over a wide
range ofbody weights, andhence isappropriate forfuture clinical trials ofnivolumab.
1.4.2 Toxicity
1.4.2.1 BMS -986012
Thestructure offuc-GM1 ishomologous across allspecies, andBMS -986012 demonstrates high
affinity binding inallspecies including mice, rats, cynomolgus monkey s,andhumans. Thenon-
clinical safet yofBMS -986012 wasevaluated inaseries ofinvitro tissue cross- reactivity studies
andinvivo single -andrepeat -dose IVtoxicity studies. The BMS -986012 binding profile was
similar inhuman and cynomolgus monkey tissues intheexploratory tissue cross reactivit y
study .61Inasingle -dose exploratory IVtoxicity study inrats (0, 10, 40, or150mg/kg), BMS -
986012 was clinically tolerated at10mg/kg.61The primary BMS -986012 -related finding atall
doses was dose-related hemolytic anemia andassociated clinical toxicity resulting inhumane
euthanasia ofallratsat≥ 40 mg/kg byDay 8.This hemolytic anemia was considered tobe
pharmacologically mediated duetoexpression offuc-GM1 onraterythrocy tes.62Fuc-GM1 is
notexpressed onerythrocy tesinother species including humans.63Based onthese findings,
which arenotconsidered toberelevant tohumans, theratwasconsidered tobeunacceptable for

toxicological assessment ofBMS -986012. The mouse was selected astherodent species for
further toxicology evaluation ofBMS -986012.
Ina pivotal 1- month IVtoxicity study inmice (0,10 or 150 mg/kg, every  week [QW], 5doses),
testicular toxicity characterized bydecreased testes weights with amicroscopic correlate of
bilateral germ cell degeneration, retention ofspermatids, and Sertoli cell vacuolation was
observed atboth doses.64The testicular toxicity observed inmice was considered
pharmacologically mediated and species specific due toexpression offuc-GM1 inmouse
testes.65,66Fuc-GM1 isnotexpressed intestes ofother species, including humans; therefore,
testicular toxicity inmice isconsidered nottobe a concern inhumans.60The high dose of 150
mg/kg wasclinically tolerated, whereas the low dose of 10 mg/kg resulted inmortality following
atleast 2weekly doses that was considered aconsequence ofananti-drug antibody (ADA) -
mediated hypersensitivity .After a 6-week recovery period, there was partial recovery ofthe
BMS -986012-related testicular changes at10mg/kg andprogression oftesticular toxicity at150
mg/kg. ANOAEL was notestablished inthispivotal study duetomortality at10mg/kg and
testicular findings at10and150mg/kg. Thecause ofthemoribundity /mortality at10mg/kgwas
notapparent from gross andmicroscopic examination ofthetissues. However, considering that
these deaths occurred shortly after repeated IVdoses, theacute nature oftheclinical signs, the
presence ofADA inthisgroup (insatellite animals; ADAs were notanaly zedinthemice that
were found dead oreuthanized early ),andtheabsence ofBMS -986012-related clinical signs or
mortality atthehigh dose of 150 mg/kg, these deaths at10mg/kglikelywere aconsequence of
anADA- mediated hypersensitivity reaction. A follow -upexploratory immunotoxicity study in
mice wasconducted todetermine thepotential contribution ofADA- mediated hypersensitivity as
thecause ofthemoribundity andmortality at10mg/kg. Inthisstudy (0,10, or 150 mg/kg,QW,
upto5doses) infemale mice ,BMS -986012-related moribundity andmortality again occurred
only at10mg/kg with a strong correlation with high ADA levels .67The occurrence of
BMS -986012-related effects (moribundity andmortality ) only atthe low dose of 10 mg/kg, their
onset after multiple injections, andthestrong correlation with high ADA levels provide aweight
ofevidence ofanADA -mediated hypersensitivity reaction.68This conclusion isfurther
supported bythelack ofthese findings inrepeat dose studies (10mg/kg,intraperitoneal , upto14
doses) insevere combined immunodeficiency mice which cannot generate antibody
responses.40,41,42
Inanexploratory single -dose IVtoxicity study incynomolgus monkey s(0,10, 40, or
150mg/kg), BMS -986012 wasclinicall ywell tolerated atalldoses with no adverse effects at an y
dose.69Inthepivotal 1- month IVtoxicity study inmonkey s(0,10 or 150 mg/kg,QW, 5doses),
BMS -986012 was clinically well tolerated atalldoses.55Adverse findings were limited tothe

platelets (0.32 to0.50)and increased spleen size/weight and minimal subacute splenic
inflammation. Decreases inplatelets and neutrophils were mostly seen inanimals with high
ADA levels and was likely due toFc-mediated binding ofBMS -986012/ADA immune
complexes tothese cells resulting inclearance predominantly inthespleen. After a 2-month

Nosignificant irritation orlocal tolerance issues were observed attheinjection sites following

isothiocy anate (FITC )toneural elements (ganglion and satellite cells and axons) that was
anticipated based onliterature reports offuc-GM1 expression inperipheral nerves anddorsal
root ganglia.71,72Expression offuc-GM1 inhealthy tissue isvery limited; however, expression
hasbeen associated with sensory nerves inmonkey sandhumans, making peripheral neuropath y
apotential target liability ofBMS -986012. Although fuc-GM1 isreported tobeexpressed in
neural tissues ofmonkeys,60BMS -986012 (150 mg/kg, Q2W, IV)when given alone tomonkey s
for90daysdidnotproduce neurotoxicity ornerve conduction deficits andincombination with

there wasnoBMS -986012 -FITC -specific staining inanyoftheadjacent -to-tumor lung samples
from smokers ornonsmokers, suggesting thatsmoking didnotinduce theexpression offuc-GM1

1.4.3.2 Nivolumab
In cynomolgus monkey s receiving 1 to 50 mg/kg IV single doses of nivolumab, the T-HALF 
estimates were long (124 to 148 hours after 1mg/kg doses, 223 to 267 hours after 10 or 50 
mg/kg doses), and serum clearance was low.76,77,78Systemic exposure to nivolumab increased in 
an approximately  dose-proportional manner. Nivolumab was immunogenic in cynomolgus 
monkey s; generall y, exposure to nivolumab in these anti -nivolumab- positive monkey s was lower 
than the mean exposures in animals in the same dose group with no detectable anti-nivolumab 
antibodies. The low volume of distribution in cynomolgus monkey s (0.046 L/kg to 0.071 L/kg) 
indicates th at there is little extravascular distribution of nivolumab.
No mass balance or metabolism studies with nivolumab have been conducted in animals. The 
expected in vivo degradation of monoclonal antibodies is to small peptides and amino acids via 
biochemical pathway s that are independent of drug metabolism enzy mes.
Nivolumab is not expected to have any effect on cytochrome P450 or other drug metabolizing 
enzy mes in terms of inhibition or induction, and is, therefore, not expected to induce these types 
of PK -based drug interactions. 
1.4.4 Clinical Pharmacology andSafety
1.4.4.1 BMS -986012
The preliminary  PK of BMS -986012 was evaluated in 30 subjects over a dose range of 70 to 
1000 mg administered Q3W. The exposure of BMS -986012 appears to increase dose 
proportionally  over the dose range of 70 to 1000 mg Q3W with moderate to high variability . 
BMS -986012 achieves peak concentrations approximately  2 hours after dosing and has possible 
a terminal T-HALF of approximately  ≥ 10 days based on non- compartmental analysis (NCA). 
Prelim inary  anal yses demonstrated that the mean Vss (standard deviation ) after the first dose was 
5.1L (2.9L),which is consistent across the doses tested. The small volume suggests that 
BMS -986012 is confined primarily  to the extracellular fluid volume, which is consistent with the 
large molecular weight of a mAb. BMS -986012 is slowly  eliminated with the estimated T -HALF 
ranging from 108 to 400 hours (4.5 to 16.6 days), which may  be underesti mated due to collection

Nivolumab has been studied inover 8,600 subjects and iswidel yapproved inmultiple
indications. Extensive details onthesafet yprofile ofnivolumab areavailable intheIB,andwill
not be repeated herein .58
Overall, thesafety profile ofnivolumab monotherap yaswell ascombination therapy with other
drugs ismanageable andgenerall yconsistent across completed andongoing clinical trials with
no MTD reached at an ydose tested upto10mg/kg. Most AEs were low-grade (Grade 1to2)
with relatively fewrelated high-grade (Grade 3to4)AEs. There wasnopattern intheincidence,

1.5 Overall Risk/Benefit Assessment
1.5.1 Risk/Benefit forBMS -986012 Monotherapy
This istheFIHstudy ofBMS -986012 monotherap yand clinical benefit iscurrently being
assessed insubjects with SCLC(see Section 1.1.7.4 ).BMS -986012 is a first-in-class antibody 
targeting a ganglioside antigen ;therefore, no other compounds in development or approved for 
clinical use can inform the potential clinical risks and benefits of BMS -986012, although 
vaccines targeting ganglioside antigens in cancer patients have demonstrated preliminary  
evidence of clinical benefit as well as some preliminary  evide nce of increased neuropathy .
Clinical experience to date with BMS -986012 has shown evidence of preliminary  clinical 
activity , with objective responses in 2 subjects, with duration of response greater than 1year in 1
subject ,and stable disease in 4subjects.
To date, nearl y all AEs considered related to BMS -986012 monotherapy  have been mild to 
moderate in nature (Grade 1 or 2), with the exception of 1subject with Grade 3 fatigue. While 
the majority  of subjects have experienced pruritus, these event s have been mild to moderate in 
nature and appear edto respond to medical management with antihistamines. Potential on-target 
adverse effects such as neutropenia, thrombocy topenia, and peripheral neuropathy , when 
occurring in a few subjects, have not been considered related to BMS -986012 monotherapy .
Sensory  changes related to BMS -986012 have been reported but have been mild to moderate in 
nature and have not progressed to neuropathy. Lymphopenia has also been observed, although its 
relation to BMS -986012 a nd clinical significance have not been established .
Because BMS -986012 isa mAb, infusion reactions arepossible and will be monitored and
managed. Guidelines formanagement ofinfusion reactions, should anyoccur, areprovided in

Section 3.7. With Amendment 02,proph ylactic premedication with aH1blocker will be
administered prior toadministration ofeach BMS -986012 infusion asdescribed inSection 3.7.
BMS -986012 is an experimental agent and clinical experience is limited at this time ; therefore, it 
is possible that unforeseen, unknown, or unanticipated reactions may occur. Frequent safety
assessments will beutilized bytheinvestigator sand Sponsor todetermine whether dose
modification, additional safet ymeasures, ortermination ofthestudy isrequired at an ytime. Data
generated bytheabove -described safety monitoring procedures andassessment of adverse and
SAE swill bereviewed onanongoing basis bytheSponsor’s Medical Monitor and Global
Pharmacovigilance andEpidemiology representatives tomonitor foranysafety signals ortrends.
Subjects enrolling in Parts 1 and 2 will have SCLC that has relapsed after first line therapy. 
While approved therapies are available in this setting, clinical trials to identify more efficacious 
and/or less toxic alternatives are needed and recommended for patient care by treatment 
guidelines. The risks and benefits described above for BMS -986012 monotherapy  support its 
continued development in this setting. 
1.5.2 Risk/Benefit forBMS -986012 andNivolumab Combinatio nTherapy
Nivolumab has demonstrated clinical activity insubjects with advanced NSCL C, RCC,
melanoma, andlymphomas, aswell asother tumors including SCLC.The clinical activity of
nivolumab monotherapy observed todate inSCLC suggests thepotential forimproved clinical
outcomes relative toother approved therapies. InaPhase 1/2trial insubjects with heavily pre-
treated SCLC,nivolumab monotherap yshowed anORR of15%.79
Nivolumab hasdemonstrated amanageable safety profile. The overall safety experience, when
used either asamonotherapy orincombination with another therapeutic, isbased onexperience
inapproximately 8,600 subjects treated todate at doses up to 10 mg/kg Q2W or Q3W .Based on 
the PPK model described in Section 1.1.8, the predicted steady -state peak concentrations 
following nivolumab 360 mg Q3W are predicted to be less than those following the 
administration of nivolumab 10 mg/kg Q2W ,providing sufficient safet y margins. There isno
pattern intheincidence, severit y,orcausality ofAEs with respect tonivolumab dose level .The
most common AEs (as of 30-Jun-2015) include fatigue, rash, pruritus, diarrhea, andnausea. Side
effects ofnivolumab therapy may include those associated with immune -mediated activation,
such aspneumonitis, thyroiditis, and hepatitis. Most ofthese events resolved with immune -
modulating medication. To mitigate risk from serious immune -mediated AEs, subject
management algorithms fornivolumab-related AEs from prior collective nivolumab experience
have been included .58
There ispotential foroverlapping toxicity between clinical findings ofBMS -986012 and
nivolumab involving neurotoxicity , infusion- related reactions, lymphocy te decreases, 
hypophy sitis, and pruritus.
Peripheral neuropathy  related to BMS -986012 has not been reported , and the sensory  changes 
observed to date do not appear to be dose related (see Section 1.1.7.4). Furthermore, theacute
onset and lack of worsening of sensory  changes with repeated dosing of BMS -986012 differ

from the usual pattern of cumulative neurotoxicity  observed with neuropathic agents such as 
cisplatin or taxanes. Details of these events areprovided in the BMS -986012 IB.29For 
nivolumab monotherapy in subjects with SCLC, the incidence ofneuropathies was < 1% and
management guidelines have been established asdetailed inthenivolumab IB.58To minimize
potential risks, criteria excluding subjects with peripheral neuropathy  or autoimmune neurologic 
diseases (including paraneoplastic syndrome) have been developed. In addition, subjects in 
Study CA001030 receiving BMS -986012 monotherapy  or BMS -986012 and nivolumab 
combination therap y will be monitored closel y for any neurologic changes via neurologic 
assessments and frequent assessment for the subjective development of neurologic symptoms. 
Study drug will be discontinued for any  significant neurologic developments.  
Infusion reactions, including high-grade hypersensitivity  reactions, following administration of 
nivolumab are uncommon;58for BMS -986012, 2 Grade 2 infusion reactions have been reported 
to date (as of data cut-off date 05-Apr-2016).29Subjects will be monitored closely  for extended 
periods during the first 2cycles of the combination therap y and will continue to be monitored 
during subsequent cycles. Subjects also will receive proph ylactic premedications, and detailed
management guidelines for infusion reactions are provided intheprotocol (seeSection 3.7).
Lym phocy te decreases have also been observed following BMS -986012 andnivolumab given 
individually  as monotherapies . Based on laboratory  abnormalities reported for metastatic 
melanoma and NSCL C, >40% of subjects treated with nivolumab had a lymphocy te decrease ,58
and approximately  30% of subjects to date have hadlymphocy te declines during treatment with 
BMS -986012 monotherapy . The clinical significance of these observed declines in lymphocy te 
count is unclear, especially  as there are multiple potential etiologies for changes in lymphocy te 
counts in cancer patients. Safet y laboratory  assessments will be performed frequentl y throughout 
the combination therap y.
Pruritus andskin rashes occurred in37 of 38 subjects treated with BMS -986012 monotherap y.
These were typically low grade ,manageable with routine medical intervention, and do not 
appear related to dose.29Rash and pruritus were common AEs observed following treatment 
with nivolumab monotherap y. Most cases have been of low or moderate grade and generall y 
manageable. More severe cases responded to systemic corticosteroids.58Subjects will be 
monitored closely  for the development of rashes and pruritus during combination therapy ,and 
dose modification guidelines were developed to help manage an y of these AEs.
Hypophy sitis is an uncommon event with nivolumab monotherap y,though the incidence is 
reported to be increased in subjects receiving combination therap y with ipilimumab .58Pre-
clinical IHC studies with FITC -conjugated BMS -986012 demonstrated labeling of the 
adenoh ypoph ysisin the 4 species tested. However, there has been no evidence to date of 
endocrine -related events with BMS -986012 monotherap y. Furthermore , monoclonal antibodies 
have poor central nervous system (CNS )penetration across the blood -brain barrier, and,
therefore ,a synergistic effect between nivolumab and BMS -986012 in combination therapy  is 
consi dered unlikel y. However, thyroid testing will be utilized to indirectl y monitor for

manifestation of hypophy sitis and management of this immune -related AE is well established 
based on previous nivolumab trials.
Subjects enrolling in Parts 3and 4will have SCLC that has relapsed after first line therapy. 
While nivolumab is being evaluated as monotherapy  in this setting in other studies, the potential 
synergistic effects of nivolumab with BMS -986012 and the risk/benefit ratio support evaluation 
of this combination.

4parts . A BMS -986012 monotherapy dose escalation period (Part 1)will beconducted to
identify apotential MTD (orMAAD ifno MTD isdetermined ).In the BMS -986012
monotherap ydose expansion period (Part 2),additional subjects with SCLC willbetreated at2
dose level sofBMS -986012 monotherap yatorbelow themonotherapy MTD orMAAD to
confirm safety andevaluate anti-tumor activity atthese dose level s(see Section 3.1.1). With
Amendment 04, a dose escalation period will beconducted with BMS -986012 andnivolumab
combination therap y(Part 3). Inthe BMS -986012 and nivolumab combination therapy  dose 
expansion period (Part 4),additional subjects with SCLCwill betreated atorbelow the
combination dose level identified inPart3toconfirm safety andevaluate anti-tumor activit y(see
Section 3.1.1). In Parts 1 and 3, subjects must have received at least 1 prior line of therapy . In 
Parts 2 and 4, subjects must have received only 1prior line of therap y. 
Subjects will complete upto4periods inthestudy :Screening (within 28daysprior to
administration ofstudy medication), Treatment (until meeting protocol -specified discontinuation
criteria ),Clinical Follow -up ( approximately 100days,seeTable 5.1-3), andSurvival Follow -up
(uptoapproximately 3yearsfollowing endoftreatment [EOT] ,Table 5.1-3). Screening and
Treatment periods arecalculated relative tothefirst dose ofstudy drug.TheClinical Follow -up
period begins 30days (± 5 days)from thelastdose ofstudy drug,while theSurvival Follow -up
period occurs every 12 weeks (± 2 weeks) from thedate ofthe100-dayClinical Follow -upvisit.
Ifasubject discontinues treatment duetoAE(s),then thesubject should beseen infollow -upat

3.1.1.2 BMS -986012 andNivolumab Combination Therapy Dose Escalation
(Part 3)
Dose escalation with BMS -986012 andnivolumab combination therapy will follow thesame
guidelines asdescribed inSection 3.1.1.1. AnmTPI design similar tothat described for
BMS -986012 monotherapy (see Section 3.1.1.1) willguide dose escalation decisions. A total of
approximately 12evaluable subjects willbetreated across 2dose levels . Additional subjects may 
be treated if additional dose levels arerequired as described in “Selection of Dose Levels” 
below.  
To minimize risks to subjects from unanticipated acute toxicities, in all dose levels evaluated, 
5days must elapse between administration of the first dose for the first and second subjects to 
allow observation prior to subsequent exposures.
In all Combination Dose levels, m ultiple subjects within a cohort will not be permitted to receive 
the initial dose of study  drugs on the same day. Subjects must be clinically  observed for at least 
4hours following the first 2 doses of BMS -986012 and nivolumab combination therap y
(ie,Cycles1 and 2) and for at least 1 hour following doses beyond the first 2 doses of 
combination therap y (ie, Cycle 3 and bey ond).
Selection of Dose Level s to be E valuated
In combination therapy , nivolumab will be administered at 360 mg Q3W in all combination dose 
levels ,except as noted below . BMS -986012 will be evaluated starting at 400 mg (Combination 
Dose Level 1). If safet y and tolerability  are established at 400 mg, Combination Dose Level 2 
will be opened at 1000 mg. If toxicity  is unacceptable at Combination Dose Level 1, additional

combination dose level(s)may be evaluated using BMS -986012 doseof 160mg and/or 
nivolumab dos eof 240 mg Q3W . Selection of dose level for each study  drug will be based on the 
nature and attribution of observed DLTs in previously  evaluated dose levels . If toxicity  is 
acceptable at Combination Dose Level 1 but unacceptable at Combination Dose Level 2, an 
intermediate dose level of BMS -986012 and/or nivolumab dose of 240 mg Q3W may be 
evaluated in additional cohort (s). The intermediate dose level of BMS -986012 will be selected 
based on combination th erapy safet y and available PK data. 
No intra -subject dose escalation of BMS -986012 or nivolumab is allowed at any  dose level. 
Dose Escalation Decision Guide
As in Part 1,anmTPI design (Table 3.1.1.2-1 ) will be used to guide dose escalation decisions 
and to select the MTD. A DLT target rate of 29% (EI=[28%, 31% ])will be used for combination 
therap y. Toxicity  assessments will be based on a 28-day DLT evaluation period. See 
Section 3.1.3 for further details of DLT evaluation. Dose escalation decisions will be based on a 
total number of subjects in a dose level receiving 2doses of both BMS -986012 and nivolumab 
within the DLT evaluation period and who are followed for 28days (these subjects are referred 
to as “DLT evaluable”), and the number of DLTs observed at that dose level. 
The number of subjects in the initial cohort of each dose level will be 3 to 4.Decisions to 
escalate to the next dose level, expand (add more subjects to) the current dose level, or de-
escalate will be guided by the number of DLTs observed, out of the total number of evaluable 
subjects at a current dose level , according to the design algorithm shown in Table 3.1.1.2-1. 
Enrollment of additional cohorts at the same dose level will proceed insample sizes of 2 to 4 
subjects. Subsequent dose levels will follow the same cohort enrollment size and decision rules.
Subjects with insufficient data to establish safet y during the DLT evaluation period at a dose
level (eg,withdrawal from the study  or study  treatment discontinuation prior tocompletion of 
DLT evaluation period) may  be replaced
When more than 3 subjects are enrolled in a cohort, the fourth subject may be enrolled following 
agreement between the investigator and the Sponsor/Medical Mon itor if able to start the first day  
of dosing within approximately  1 w eek of the third subject in the same dose escalation cohort. 
When 3 or 4 subjects are enrolled in a cohort, at least 3 DLT evaluable subjects in that cohort 
will be required to enable a decision to escalate, add more subjects to the current dose level, or 
de-escalate.

Termination ofthestudy byBMS
Loss ofabilit ytofreelyprovide consent through imprisonment orinvoluntarily incarceration
fortreatment ofeither apsychiatric orphysical (eg,infectious disease) illness ;
Inability tocompl ywith protocol
Discretion ofthe investigator
Protocol -defined reasons fordiscontinuation (Section 4.5.3)
Allsubjects who discontinue IPshould compl ywith protocol specified follow -upprocedures as
outlined inSection 3.6. The only exception tothisrequirement iswhen asubject withdraws
consent forallstudy procedures including post -treatment study follow -up or loses theability to
consent freely(ie,isimprisoned orinvoluntarily incarcerated forthetreatment ofeither a
psychiatric orphysical illness).
Inthe case ofpregnancy, theinvestigator must immediately notify theSponsor ordesignee of
thisevent. Inmost cases, thestudy drug will bepermanently discontinued inanappropriate
manner (eg,dose tapering ifnecessary forsubject safet y).Please contact theSponsor ordesignee
within 24hours ofawareness ofthepregnancy .Iftheinvestigator determines apossible
favora blebenefit/risk ratio that warrants continuation of study drug, adiscussion between the
investigator andtheSponsor ordesignee must occur.
Ifstudy treatment isdiscontinued prior tothesubject’s completion ofthestudy ,thereason for
thediscontinuation must bedocumented inthesubject’s medical records andentered onthe
appropriate CRF page.
3.6 Post -study Drug Follow -up
Inthisstudy , safety andsurvival areimportant endpoint s ofthestudy .Post-study follow -upisof
critical importance andisessential topreserving subject safet yandtheintegrit y of thestudy .
Subjects who discontinue study drug must continue tobefollowed forcollection of safet y,
survival outcome andother data asdescribed inTable 5.1-3 andSections 5.3and5.4.1.
BMS may request that survival data becollected onalltreated subjects outside ofthe

procedures and/or post-treatment study follow -up, andentered ontheappropriate CRF page. In
theevent that vital status (whether thesubject isalive ordead) isbeing measured, publicly
available information should beused todetermine vital status only asappropriatel y directed in
accordance with local law.
3.6.2 Lost toFollow -Up
Allreasonable efforts must bemade tolocate subjects todetermine and report their ongoing
status. This includes follow -upwith persons authorized bythesubjec tasnoted above. Lost to
follow -upisdefined bytheinability to reach thesubject after aminimum of 3documented phone
calls, faxes, or emails aswell aslack ofresponse bysubject to1registered mail letter. All
attempts should bedocumented inthesubject’s medical records. Ifit is determined that the
subject hasdied, thesitewilluse permissible local methods toobtain thedate andcause ofdeath.
Ifinvestigator ’suseofthird- partyrepresentative toassist inthefollow -upportion ofthestudy
has been included inthe subjec t’sinformed consent, then the investigator may use a
Sponsor -retained third- party representative to assist sitestaff with obtaining subject’s contact
information orother public vital status data necessary tocomplete thefollow -upportion ofthe
study .The sitestaff andrepresentative will consult publicly available sources, such aspublic
health registries and databases, inorder to obtain updated contact information. Ifafter all
attempts, thesubject remains losttofollow -up, then thelastknown alivedate asdetermined by
theinvestigator should bereported anddocumented inthesubject’s medical records .

An IP,also known asinvestigational medicinal product insome regions, isdefined a
pharmaceutical form ofanactive substance orplacebo being tested orused asareference ina
clinical study ,including products alread ywith amarketing authorization butused orassembled
(formulated orpackaged) different lythan theauthorized form, orused foranunauthorized
indication, orwhen used togain further information about theauthorized form.
TheIPshould bestored ina secure area according tolocal regulations. Itistheresponsibility of
theinvestigator toensure thatIPisonly dispensed tostudy subjects. The IPmust bedispensed
only from official study sites byauthorized personnel according tolocal regulations.
Inthisprotocol, IPsare:BMS -986012 andnivolumab .
4.1.1 BMS -986012
There will be no individual subject dose escalations of BMS -986012 allowed. Subjects should be 
carefully  monitored for infusion reactions during BMS -986012 administration. If an infusion 
reaction is noted, subjects should be managed according to the guidan ce provided in Section 3.7.
Doses of BMS-986012 may be interrupted, delay ed, skipped, or discontinued as described in 
Sections 3.7 and 4.5.
BMS -986012 is to be administered as an IV infusion. The administration oftheentire bag
contents should becompleted within approximately 60minutes. At the end of the infusion, an IV 
lineflush should be performed by adding 30 mL normal saline into the infusion bag and then 
finishing the infusion at a rate of 1 to 2 mL per minute. For details regarding drug storage, 
preparation, administration, and use time, refer to the BMS -986012 IB29and/orPharmacy 
Manual .
4.1.2 Nivolumab
There will be no individual subject dose escalations orreductions ofnivolumab allowed.
Subjects should becarefully monitored forinfusion reactions during nivolumab administration.
Ifaninfusion reaction isnoted, subjects should bemanaged according to the guidance provided 
inSection 3.7.Subjects must be monitored in the clinic for at least 4 hours following the first 2 
doses of nivolumab and at least 1 hour following subsequent doses.
Doses ofnivolumab may beinterrupted, delayed, skipped, or discontinued as described in 
Sections 3.7and4.5.
Nivolumab injection istobeadministered as an IVinfusion over 30 minutes. At the end of the 
infusion, the IV line should be flushed with an appropriate amount (15to 20 mL) of diluent to 
ensure that the total dose is administered .Separate infusion bags andfilters should beused when
administering nivolumab andBMS -986012 on thesame day. For details regarding drug storage,

Inthisprotocol there areno non IPs.
4.3 Storage andDispensing
Theproduct storage manager should ensure thatthestudy drug isstored inaccordance with the
environmental conditions (temperature, light, andhumidity )asdetermined byBMS. Ifconcerns
regarding thequalit y or appearance ofthestudy drug arise, thestudy drug should not be
dispensed andBMS should becontacted immediately .
Study drug notsupplied byBMS willbestored inaccordance with thepackage insert.
Investigational product documentation (whether supplied byBMS ornot) must bemaintained
that includes allprocesses required toensure drug isaccuratel yadministered. This includes
documentation ofdrug storage, administration and, asapplicable, storage temperatures,
reconstitution, anduseofrequired processes (eg,required diluents, administration sets).
Storage facilities forcontrolled substances must besecurel ylocked andsubstantially constructed,
with restricted access toprevent theft ordiversion, asapplicable bylocal regulations.
4.4 Method ofAssigning Subject Identification
This isanopen -label study . All e nrolled subjects, including those notdosed, will beassigned
sequential subject numbers starting with 00001, eg, 00001, 00002, 00003.... 00010. Following 
implementation of interactive voice/web- based response system (IVRS/IWRS ), subject numbers 
beginning 00101 will be assigned sequentially . Those enrolled subjects meeting inclusion and
exclusion criteria will beeligible tobedosed. The distinct patient identification number will
ultimately becomprised ofthesitenumber andsubject number, eg, 0002 00001.
Until anIVRS/I WRS system is implemented, once informed consent hasbeen obtained, the
investigator (ordesignee) will register thesubject bytransmitting acopy ofthecompleted
enrollment worksheet (registration form) totheSponsor. The following information isrequired
forregistration:
Subject’s date ofbirth (month andyearonly areacceptable ifrequired bylocal regulation)
Gender
Diagnosis
Statement thatsubject iseligible
Date ofinformed consent
Planned date offirstdose
Treatment groups and/or dose levels willbeprovided tothesitestudy team after thesubject has
registered and eligibility forthestudy confirmed. Site personnel/ investigator will receive a

(Parts 2 and 4)will beenrolled atBMS -986012 dose level satorbelow theMTD or MAAD as
agreed upon bytheinvestigator andtheSponsor (Section 3.1.2).
Subjects in the dose expansion cohorts will be enrolled at dose levels at or below the MTD or 
MAAD of BMS -986012 monotherap y or BMS -986012 and nivolumab combination therap y, 
respectivel y.
For subjects receiving either BMS -968012 monotherapy  or BMS -986012 and nivolumab 
combination therap y, BMS -986012 will be administered as an IV infusion of approximately  
60-minute duration every 21 days. The expected dosages to be used for each monotherap y dose 
level are shown in Table 3.1.1.1-1. Dose levels intermediate to the estimated dose levels may be 
evaluated if agreed upon by the Sponsor/Medical Monitor and investigators, as long as the dose 
escalation increments are smaller than those specified in the protocol.
For subjects receiving nivolumab in combination with BMS -986012, subjects should receive 
nivolumab as a 30-minute infusion on Day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle until PD(except as 
indicated in Section 4.5.4) or symptomatic deterioration, withdrawal of consent, unacceptable 
AEs,and/or meeting other protocol -specified discontinuation criteria (see Section 3.5), 
whichever occurs first. 
For BMS -986012 and nivolumab combination therap y,BMS -986012 will be administered over a 
60-minute infusion followed by  a 30-minute flush, and then nivolumab will be administered over

4.5.1 Guidelines forDose Modification
4.5.1.1 Intra -subject Dose Escalation
Intra -subject dose escalation ofBMS -986012 monotherap yorBMS -986012 and nivolumab
combination therap yisnotpermitted .
4.5.1.2 Management Algorithms forImmuno -oncology Agents: BMS -986012
andNivolumab Combination Therapy Only
Immuno -oncology (I-O)agents areassociated with AEs thatcandiffer inseverit yandduration
from AEs caused byother therapeutic classes. Nivolumab isconsidered anI-Oagent inthis
protocol. Earlyrecognition andmanagement ofAEs associated with I-Oagents may mitigate
severe toxicity .Management algorithms have been developed toassist investigators inassessing
andmanaging thefollowing groups ofAEs:
Gastrointestinal
Renal
Pulmonary
Hepat ic
Endocrinopath y
Skin
Neurological
The above algorithms arefound inthenivolumab IB58and Appendix 2ofthis protocol .In 
addition to the guidance provided in these algorithms, it is recommended that consultation with a 
nephrologist be obtained for subjects with Grade 2 or 3 r enal immuno -oncology -related AEs. 
Also, the use of infliximab for immuno -oncology -related AEs has the most data for treatment of 
colitis/diarrhea, while use in other AEs has not been well established. Infusion reaction 
management is provided in Section 3.7.
4.5.1.3 Dose Reductions
Forsubjects responding totreatment (ie,SD,PR, orCRdemonstrated on imaging evaluations),
intra-subject dose reduction ofBMS -986012 may bepermitted on a case bycase basis (for
reasons such as,but not limited to toxicity ),after discussion and agreement between the
Sponsor/Medical Monitor and the treating investigator .Once reduced, the dose level 
administered will not be re-escalated. Dose reductions of nivolumab for individual subjects are 
not permitted.
4.5.1.4 Dose Delay Criteria
Subjects who experience thefollowing must have allstudy therapy interrupted :

Sponsor/Medical Monitor to assess eligibility  for continued study  treatment prior to 
continued study  treatment
AE, laboratory abnormality , orconcurrent illness that,inthejudgment oftheinvestigator ,
warrants delay ingthedose ofstudy drug.
Note: Subjects who require delay ofany study  drug should bere-evaluated weekly (ormore
frequentl yifclinically indicated )andresume dosing when retreatment criteria aremet.During 
BMS -986012 and nivolumab combination therapy , if there is toxicity  requiring a dose delay  and 
the toxic ity is considered related to 1 study  drug while clinical benefit has been observed, 
treatment must be discontinued for the study  drug to which the toxicity is attributed but may 
continue for the other study  treatment only after discussion and agreement with the BMS 
Medical Monitor.
Dose delay s > 7 dayswill beconsidered missed andwill not be replaced. Subjects who meet
criteria listed inSection 3.5 andSection 4.5.3 arerequired topermanentl ydiscontinue allstudy
drug(s) , which include dose delay s lasting >6 weeks (with exceptions as noted) . All other
subjects willbepermitted toresume therapy with study drug(s)following resolution oftheAEas

treatment isresumed. Subjects with persistent Grade 1pneumonitis after completion of a
steroid taper over atleast 1month may beeligible forretreatment ifdiscussed with and
approved byBMS Medical Monitor .
Subjects with drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic
hormone replacement may resume treatment after consultation with theBMS Medical
Monitor .
For delay s due to laboratory  value changes, subsequent dosing may continue if subjects 
continue to meet laboratory  criteria as listed in Section 3.3.1, subsection 2.e). The 
investigator will determine if subsequen t dosing is appropriate for subjects who have 
laboratory  or clinical abnormalities that do not meet DLT (Section 3.1.3) or discontinuation 
criteria (Section 4.5.3).
If the toxicity  resolves to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline (except asotherwise noted in the excepti ons 
above) > 6 weeks after last dose, but the subject does not otherwise meet the criteria for 
permanent discontinuation (see Sections 3.5and 4.5.3), and the investigator believes that the 
subject is deriving clinical benefit, then the subject may be eligible to resume the study  drug(s) 
following the approval of the BMS Medical Monitor. Subjects who meet criteria for permanent 
discontinuation should receive no further stud y therap y.
4.5.3 Guidelines forPermanent Discontinuation
Subjects meeting any of thefollowing criteria willberequired topermanently discontinue study 
treatment.
Progression ofdisease ,except as described in Section 4.5.4.
Clinical deterioration asassessed bythe investigator
Grade 3infusion reaction

Any dosing interruption lasting > 6weeks after lastdose with thefollowing exceptions:
Dosing interruptions toallow forprolonged steroid tapers tomanage AEsforwhich no
clear alternative cause isidentified other than tostudy treatment areallowed.
Prior tore-initiating treatment inasubject with adosing interruption lasting > 6weeks

Accumulating evidence indicates aminority ofsubjects treated with immunotherapy may derive
clinical benefit despite initial evidence ofPD.49
Subjects treated with BMS -986012 andnivolumab combination therapy may beperm itted to
continue nivolumab monotherapy  beyond initial RECI STv1.1- defined PD, as assessed bythe
investigator, aslong asthey meet thefollowing criteria:
Investigator -assessed clinical benefit
Tolerance ofstudy drug
Stable performance status

Treatment beyond progression will notdelay animminent intervention toprevent serious
complications of disease progression (eg,CNS metastases) .
Subject provides written informed consent prior toreceiving additional nivolumab treatment.
Allother elements ofthemain consent including description ofreasonabl yforeseeable risks
ordiscomforts, orother alternative treatment options willstillapply .
A radiographic assessment/scan should beperformed within 6weeks ofinitial investigator -
assessed progression todetermine whether there hasbeen adecrease inthe tumor size or
continued PD.Theassessment ofclinical benefit should bebalanced byclinical judgment asto
whether thesubject isclinically deteriorating andunlikely toreceive anybenefit from continued
treatment with nivolumab.
Iftheinvestigator feels that thenivolumab subject continues toachieve clinical benefit by
continuing treatment, thesubject should remain onthetrial andcontinue toreceive monitoring
according totheTable 5.1-2.
Forthe subjects who continue nivolumab study therapy beyondprogression, further progression
isdefined as an additional 10% increase intumor burden with aminimum 5mm absolute
increase from time ofinitial PD.This includes anincrease inthesum ofdiameters ofalltarget
lesions and/or thediameters ofnew measurable lesions compared tothetime ofinitial PD.
Nivolumab treatment should be discontinued permanentl y upon documentation offurther
progression.
New lesions areconsidered measureable atthetime ofinitial progression ifthelongest diameter
isatleast 10mm(except forpathological lymph nodes which must have ashort axis ofatleast
15mm). Any new lesion considered nonmeasureable atthetime ofinitial progression may
become measureable andtherefore included inthe tumor burden ifthelongest diameter increases
toatleast 10mm(except forpathological lymph nodes ,which must have ashort axis ofatleast
15mm). Insituations where therelative increase intotal tumor burden by10% issolel ydueto
inclusion ofnew lesions which become measurable, these new lesions must demonstrate an
absolute increase ofatleast 5mm. The criteria for progression during treatment beyond 
progression are for subject management purpose only. Statistical analysis of efficacy  will be

5.4 Efficacy Assessments
5.4.1 Primary Efficacy Assessment
Tumor measurements will beconducted atscreening andevery 6 weeks during theTreatment
period. During theClinical Follow -upperiod ,tumor measurements will becollected asclose as
possible tothe100-dayfollow -upvisit (ie,CT/MRI scans conducted perthesubject’s routine
standard ofcare visit forthis assessment atapproximately 100 dayscan beused). Tumor
measurements should beconducted earlier, if clinically indicated. Tumor measurements during 
follow -up only apply to subjects who discontinue study  therap yfor reasons other than PD. 
Subjects with SD,PR, orCRatthelastclinical follow -upvisit should undergo tumor assessment
viaCT/MRI scans every 3to4months during thefollow -upperiods (Section 8.3.2.2 andSection
8.4.3) until progression ordeath. Tumor measurements will becollected inallsubjects until
progression orthesubject’s discontinuation from thestudy asperSection 5.1. Tumor response
andprogression will beevaluated inthisstudy using RECI STv1.1 ( Appendix 3)for endpoint 
analysis.Subjects may continue nivolumab monotherap y and,for the purpose of subject 
management (eg,decision to treat beyond progression) ,will also be assessed as indicated in 
Section 4.5.4. Statistical analy sis of efficacy  will be based on RECI ST v1.1 criterion. Initial
response assessment ofPRorCRmust be confirmed byaconsecutive assessment nolessthan 4
weeks (28days)later. At the Sponsor’s discretion, de -identified scans and measurements may be

collected and reviewed by independent radiologists using RECI ST v1.1 criteria at a later date, or 
at an y time during the study.
The tumor assessment performed during screening will beused asabaseline forefficacy
assessments. CT/MRI imaging ofthechest andabdomen isrequired atScreening andateach
TA, regardless ofthelocation ofknown metastases. The same imaging modality must beused
forallTAs, unless contraindicated.
Brain scans arerequired atScreening todocument potential asymptomatic CNS metastases. If
CNS lesions aredocumented atbaseline, brain scans should beperformed at each TA. In
addition, brain scans aretoberepeated asclinically indicated. Contrast enhanced CTs are
preferred, MRIs areasecond choice.
Imaging- based evaluation ispreferred toclinical examination. Helical (spiral) CTscans ofthe
chest and abdomen arepreferred. Ifnotavailable, conventional (non-helical, non-spiral CT)
should beused; however, ameasurable lesion must nothave thelongest diameter smaller than
20mmbyconventional CTorMRI (10mmonspiral CT). IVcontrast should beused forallCT
scans; ifIVcontrast iscontraindicated, CTwithout contrast may beused, orMRI should beused
attheScreening exam andatall TA time points. Subjects who develop contrast allergy after
study enrollment must befollowed byCTwithout contrast orMRI forsubsequent tumor
measurements.
Sections should becontiguous, similarly sized and consistent from visit -to-visit. Section
thickness must bebased oninstitutional standards (eg, from 5to8mm, 10mm cuts arenot
recommended). Chest x- raysand ultrasound arenotacceptable methods tomeasure disease.
Response andprogression ofdisease must bedocumented byCTorMRI similar tothemethods
used atScreening.
Bone scans may beutilized attheinvestigator’s discretion and per institutional guidelines. In
case ofnew lesions such aspleural effusion, cytology must beperformed toidentify andconfirm
malignancy .Skin andsofttissue lesions willbecaptured asnon-measurable lesions through PE
only.
Any subject who develops anobjective tumor response (CR orPR) isrequired toundergo
confirmatory scans noless than 4weeks since theprior scan inorder toverify the
reliability oftheradiologic finding.

5.11 Additional Research Collection
With Amendment 04, this protocol will include residual sample storage for additional research. 
This collection for additional research is intended to expand the translational R&D capability  at 
BMS , and will support as yet undefined research aims that will advance our understanding of 
disease and options for treatment. It may also be used to support health authority  requests for 
analysis, and advancement of pharmacodiagnostic development to better target drugs to the right 
patients. This may also include genetic/genomic exploration aimed at exploring disease 
pathway s, progression
 ,
and response to treatment. Allrequests for access to samples or data for 
additional research will be vetted through a diverse committee of the study  sponsor’s senior 
leaders in Research and Development to ensure the research supports appropriate and well
-
defined scientific research ac tivities.
Residual samples for future research will also be retained by the BMS Biorepository  
 
 
at a BMS -approved third party  storage management facility  for additional 
research purposes. Additional research samples will be retained for 15 years or the maximum 
allowed b y applicable law. No additional sampling is required for residual collections.
Additional research collections and retention are mandatory  for all subjects, except where 
prohibited by local laws or regulations. Further detai ls of sample collection and processing will 
be provided to the site in the laboratory  manual .
6 A DVERSE EVENTS
AnAdverse Event (AE
)
isdefined asany new untoward medical occurrence orworsening of a
pre-existing medical condition inaclinical investigation subject administered study drug andthat
does notnecessarily have acausal relationship with thistreatment. AnAEcantherefore beany
unfavorable andunintended sign (such as an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, ordisease
temporally associated with theuseofstudy drug, whether or not considered related tothestudy
drug.
Thecausal relationship tostudy drug isdetermined byaphysician andshould beused toassess
allAEs.Theca
u
sal
relationship canbe one ofthefollowing:
Related: There isareasonable causal relationship between study drug administration and
theAE.
Not related: There isnot a reasonable causal relationship between study drug
administration andtheAE.
The term “reasonable causal relationship ”means there isevidence tosuggest acausal
relationship.
AEscanbespontaneously reported orelicited during open -ended questioning, examination, or
evaluation of a subject. (Inorder toprevent reporting bias, subjects should not be questioned
regarding thespecific occurrence ofoneormore AEs.)

6.1 Serious Adverse Events
ASerious A dverse Event (SAE) isanyuntoward medical occurrence thatat an ydose:
results indeath
islife-threatening (defined as an event inwhich thesubject wasatrisk of death at thetime of
theevent; itdoes notrefer toanevent which hypothetically might have caused death if it
were more severe)
requires inpatient hospitalization orcauses prolongation ofexisting hospitalization (see
NOTE below)
results inpersistent orsignificant disability /incapacity
isacongenital anomal y/birth defect
isanimportant medical event (defined asamedical event(s) that may notbeimmediatel y
life-threatening orresult indeath orhospitalization but,based upon appropriate medical and
scientific judgment, may jeopardize the subject ormay require intervention [eg, medical,
surgical] toprevent one of theother serious outcomes listed inthedefinition above.)
Examples ofsuch events include, butarenotlimited to,intensive treatment inanemergency
room orathome forallergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias orconvulsions that do not
result inhospitalization.) Potential DILI isalso considered animportant medical event. (See
Section 6.6 forthedefinition ofpotential DILI.)
Suspected transmission ofaninfectious agent (eg,pathogenic or non- pathogenic) via the study
drug isanSAE .
Although pregnanc y,overdose ,cancer ,andDILIarenotalway sserious byregulatory definition,
these events must behandled asSAEs. (See Section 6.1.1 forreporting pregnancies).
Any component of a study endpoint thatisconsidered related tostudy therapy (eg,death isan
endpoint, ifdeath occurred duetoanaphy laxis, anaphy laxis must bereported) should bereported
asSAE (seeSection 6.1.1 forreporting details.
NOTE :
Thefollowing hospitalizations arenotconsidered SAEs inBMS clinical studies:
avisit totheemergency room orother hospital department < 24 hours, that does not
result inadmission (unless considered animportant medical orlife-threatening event)
elective surgery ,planned prior tosigning consent
admissions asperprotocol foraplanned medical/surgical procedure
routine health assessment requiring admission forbaseline/trending ofhealth status (eg,
routine colonoscop y)
medical/surgical admission other than toremedy illhealth andplanned prior toentry into
thestudy .Appropriate documentation isrequired inthese cases

inadequacy ,caregiver respite, family circumstances, administrative reason ).
Admission foradministration ofanti-cancer therapy intheabsence ofanyother SAEs
(applies tooncology protocols)
6.1.1 Serious Adverse Event Collection andReporting
Sections 5.6.1 and 5.6.2 intheIBsrepresent theReference Safety Information todetermine
expectedness ofSAE sforexpedited reporting. Following the subject’s written consent to
participate inthestudy ,allSAEs, whether related or not related tostudy drug, must becollected,
including those thought tobeassociated with protocol -specified procedures. All SAEs must be
collected that occur during the screening period and within 100 days of discontinuation of
dosing. Forsubjects assigned totreatment andnever treated with study drug, SAEs should be
collected for30daysfrom thedate oftreatment assignment. Ifapplicable, SAEs must be
collected thatrelate toanylater protocol -specified procedure (eg,afollow -upskin biopsy ).
Theinvestigator should report anySAE thatoccurs after these time periods andthatisbelieved
toberelated tostudy drug orprotocol -specified procedure.
AnSAE report should becompleted foranyevent where doubt exists regarding itsseriousness.
Iftheinvestigator believes thatanSAE isnotrelate dtostudy drug, butispotentially related to
theconditions ofthestudy (such aswithdrawal ofprevious therapy oracomplication of astudy
procedure ),therelationship should bespecified inthenarrative sectionoftheSAE Report Form.
SAEs, whether related ornotrelated tostudy drug, andpregnancies must bereported toBMS (or
designee) within 24hours. SAEs must berecorded ontheSAE Report Form; pregnancies on a
Pregnancy Surveillance Form (electronic orpaper forms). The preferred method forSAE data
reporting collection isthrough theeCRF. Thepaper SAE/pregnancy surveillance forms areonly
intended asaback -upoption when theeCRF system isnot functioning. Inthiscase, thepaper
forms aretobetransmitted viaemail orconfirmed facsimile (fax) transmission to:
SAE Email Address: Refer toContact Information list.
SAE Facsimile Number :Refer toContact Information list.
Forstudies capturing SAEs through electronic data capture (EDC), electronic submission isthe
required method forreporting. Thepaper forms should beused andsubmitted immediately ,only
intheevent theelectronic system isunavailable fortransmission. When paper forms are used,
theoriginal paper forms aretoremain onsite.
SAE Telephone Contact (required forSAE and pregnancy reporting) :Refer toContact
Information list.
Ifonly limited information isinitially available, follow -upreports arerequired. (Note: Follow -up
SAE reports should include thesame investigator term(s) initially reported.)

6.2.1 Non- serious Adverse Event Collection andReporting
The collection of non- serious AEinformation should begin atinitiation ofstudy drug. Non-
serious AEinformation should also becollected from thestart of a placebo lead-inperiod or
other observational period intended toestablish a baseline status forthe subjects.
Non-serious AEs should befollowed toresolution or stabilization, orreported asSAEs ifthey
become serious (see Section 6.1.1). Follow -upisalso required fornon-serious AEs that cause
interruption or discontinuation ofstudy drug andforthose present attheendofstudy treatment
asappropriate. Allidentified non-serious AEs must berecorded anddescribed onthenon-serious
AEpage oftheCRF (paper orelectronic).
Completion ofsupplemental CRFs may berequested forAEs and/or laboratory abnormalities
thatarereported/identified during thecourse ofthestudy .
For subjects receiving study  treatment, allnon-serious AEs(not only those deemed tobe
treatment -related) should becollected continuously during thetreatment period and fora
minimum of 100 daysfollowing discontinuation ofstudy treatment.
Every AEmust beassessed bytheinvestigator with regard towhether it is considered immune
mediated. For events that arepotentially immune mediated, additional information will be
collected onthesubject’s case report form.
6.3 Laboratory Test Result Abnormalities
The following laboratory testresult abnormalities should be captured onthenon-serious AE
CRF page orSAE Report Form (paper orelectronic) asappropriate. Paper forms areonly
intended asaback -upoption when theelectronic system isnotfunctioning.
Any laboratory testresult thatisclinically significant ormeets thedefinition of an SAE
Any laboratory test result abnormality that required thesubject tohavestudy drug

6.4 Pregnancy
If,following initiation oftheIP,it issubsequently discovered thatastudy subject ispregnant or
may have been pregnant atthetime ofstudy exposure, includi ngduring atleast 5half-lives after
product administration (105 daysfrom thelastdose ofBMS -986012 monotherap y or 23 weeks
from thelastdose ofnivolumab inBMS -986012 and nivolumab combination therap y),the
investigator must immediately notify theBMS Medical Monitor/designee of this event and
complete andforward aPregnancy Surveillance Form toBMS Designee within 24hours andin
accordance with SAE reporting procedures described inSection 6.1.1.
Inmost cases, thestudy drug will bepermanently discontinued inanappropriate manner (eg,
dose tapering ifnecessary forsubject safety ).Please calltheBMS Medical Monitor within 24
hours of awareness of thepregnancy .
Follow -upinformation regarding the course ofthepregnancy ,including perinatal andneonatal
outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must bereported onthePregnancy
Surveillance Form.
Any pregnancy thatoccurs inafemale partner of a male study participant should bereported to
BMS .Information onthispregnancy will becollected onthePregnancy Surveillance Form.
6.5 Overdose
Anoverdose isdefined astheaccidental orintentional administration ofanydose of a product
thatisconsidered both excessive andmedically important. Alloccurrences ofoverdose must be
reported asanSAE (seeSection 6.1.1 forreporting details.).
6.6 Potential Drug Induced Liver Injur y
Wherever possible, timely confirmation ofinitial liver-related laboratory abnormalities should
occur prior tothereporting of a potential DILI event. Alloccurrences ofpotential DILIs,
meeting thedefined criteria, must bereported asSAEs (seeSection 6.1.1 forreporting details).
Potential DILIisdefined as:
1.Aminotransferase (ALT or AST) elevation > 3 × ULN if liver chemistries are normal at 
baseline; if liver chemistries are abnormal at baseline, then > 2 × baseline values or any 
value > 8 × ULN should be used as cutoffs,
AND
2.Total bilirubin > 2× ULN, without initial findings ofcholestasis (elevated serum alkaline
phosphatase),
AND
3.Noother immediatel yapparent possible causes ofATelevation andhyperbilirubinemia,
including, but not limited to,viral hepatitis, pre-existing chronic oracute liver disease,

8.1 Sample Size Determination
8.1.1 Dose Escalation (Parts 1 and 3) Sample Size
Atotal ofapproximately 30evaluable subjects areexpected tobetreated during BMS -986012
monotherap ydose escalation (Part 1), andapproximately 12evaluable subjects inBMS -986012 
and nivolumab combination dose escalation , assuming 2 dose levels (Part 3).Theexact number
perdose level willdepend onthenumber of observed DLTs andwillbeguided bytheescalation
design algorithm thatselects asMTD thedose level with anestimated DLT rateclosest to25%
target DLT rate inmonotherapy (Part 1) andthe dose level with DLT rate closest to29% in
combination therap y (Part 3) .Between 2andupto13DLT evaluable subjects may beenrolled to
agiven dose level inBMS -986012 monotherapy .Treating additional subjects beyondthe13at
thesame dose level would be unlikely toalter thedecision specified bythemTPI algorithm.

will beassessed using thefollowing secondary
endpoints:
Best overall response (BOR): defined asthebest response designation over thestudy asa
whole, recorded between thedates offirst dose of study  medication and thelasttumor
assessment prior tosubsequent therapy .CRorPRdeterminations included intheBOR
assessment must be confirmed byasecond scan performed noless than 4weeks after the
criteria forresponse arefirst met. Forthose subjects who have surgical resection, only
pre-surgical tumor assessments willbeconsidered inthedetermination ofBOR.
ORR: defined asthetotal number ofsubjects whose BOR iseither aCRorPRdivided bythe
total number ofsubjects inthepopulation ofinterest.
Duration ofResponse: defined asthetime between thedate offirst response and the
subsequent date ofobjectively documented disease progression ordeath, whichever occurs
first. Forthose subjects who remain alive andhave notprogressed orreceived subsequent
therap y,duration ofresponse will becensored onthedate oflasttumor assessment
PFS: d

APPENDIX 1 SIMULATION TO EXAMINE MTPI VS 3 + 3 DESIGN FOR DOSE
ESCA LATION 
1 SIMULA TION RESULTS F OR MONOTHERA PY DOSE ESCA LATION, 
WITH 4DOSE LEVELS
Simulations of modified toxicity  probability  interval (mTPI )and 3 + 3 designs, as shown below, 
demonstrate that the mTPI  design has a greater chance of selecting the correct maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) and treating fewer subjects at suboptimal doses than the 3 + 3 design . In 
addition, it allows flexibility  in making decisions by requiring a minimum cohort size and 
therefore can handle a dropout rate of 20% without alway s requiring replacement.
The mTPI  uses a set of decision rules guided by  simple Bay esian models and requires a clinicall y 
relevant predetermi ned target dose-limiting toxicity  (DLT) rate and an equivalence interval (EI), 
within which any dose is considered close to the true MTD. For this study , in monotherapy  
setting the selected target toxicity  (DLT) rate is 25% ( EI [24%, 27%] ). 
The mTPI  design makes decisions using the same 2observed numbers as the traditional 3 + 3 
design, the number of DLT evaluable subjects and the number of subjects with DLT. Based on 
these 2numbers, unit probability  mass is calculated within each of 3regions as stated above, and 
the decision is based on which region has the largest unit probability  mass:
E: escalating to the higher dose if interval [0, 24%] has the largest unit probability  mass,
S: stay ing at the same dose if interval [24 , 27%] has the lar gest unit probability  mass,
D: de-escalating to the lower dose if interval [27, 100%] has the largest unit probability  mass.
At the end of the trial, MTD will be picked by isotonic regression estimation method to be the 
dose with the estimated toxicity  rate closest to the target toxicity  rate among all the tried doses.
Due to an expected 20% drop-out rate, mTPI design is conducted in a flexible way  such that if 
there are at least 3DLT evaluable subjects in the initial cohort of 3to 6 subjects for each dose, 
the subjects who dropped out would not be replaced and the decision will be based on the 
available (≥3) DLT evaluable subjects. At least 3 subjects are enrolled initially ,which is 
considered a safe approach because of BMS -986012’s tolerability  at high doses. After the initial 
3to 6 subjects, subjects in cohorts of sample sizes of3subjects will be enrolled to the same dose 
when requested by mTPI decision rules. Once again, subjects who were added and dropped out 
are not to be replaced either unless a ll the added subjects dropped out.
Simulations were performed to examine the performance of mTPI  and a 3 + 3 design for this 
study . Escalation decisions based on the mTPI  are shown in Appendix 4. Decisions based on the 
3 +3 design are shown below:
E: no subject with DLT out of 3 DLT evaluable subjects initially , or at most 1 subject with 
DLT out of 6 DLT evaluable subjects after adding 3 more subjects.
S: 1 subject with DLT out of 3 DLT evaluable subjects initially .
D: at least 2 subjects with DLT out of 3 DLT evaluable subjects initially , or at least 
2subjects with DL T out of 6 DLT evaluable subjects after adding 3 more subjects .

In the simulation with mTPI , a 20% drop -out rate is used. Dropout is not simulated in the 3 +3 
design, since replacement subject is alway s needed to reach a decision.
Settings of simulation:
5 dose -toxicity  scenarios
1,000 trials per scenario
Target toxicity  (Pt) for mTPI  design: 25% with ( EI [24, 27%] )
mTPI : an initial cohort size of 6 followed by(multiple) cohort size of 3
Stopping rule for mTPI: When there are alread y 13 DLT evaluable subjects treated at a dose 
level, and mTPI still make s thedecision to treat more subjects at the same dose level, dose 
escalation can be stopped.
Maximum number of DLT evaluable subjects for the study  is 30
A nominal dose level of -1 is added to account for the case when de-escalation decision is 
made for dose level 1. However, no subjects will be assigned to dose level -1, and simulation 
will stop.
Dose -Toxicity Curve Scenarios
Five scenarios of dose- toxicity  (DLT) curves are selected to cover various possibilities, including  
that the MTD could be any or none of the tested dose levels. The 5 dose-toxicity  curves are 
presented in Figure 1-1with scenario identification shown at the end of the line. Numeric values 
are available in each of the simulation results.

Simulation Result s
Simulation results are summarized from all the simulated trials per scenario and include the 
following statistics:
MTD selected: frequency of each dose level being selected as MTD.
Sample size : number of subjects being allocated to each dose level.
Average DLT rate: the average percentage of subjects who have DLT across all dose levels 
among all of the subjects.
Average sample size: the average number of subjects across all dose levels.

mTPI picks over -toxic doses (level s2, 3, and 4) 26.3% of the time, while 3 +3 picks them 20.1% of the time. 
3 +3’saverage toxicity is slightly higher ,similar with both designs.

ESCA LATION, W ITH2DOSE L EVELS
Similar to the monotherap y setting ,simulations for the BMS -986012 and nivolumab 
combination therap yshow that the mTPI  design has a greater chance of selecting the correct 
MTD than the 3 +3 design and treat sfewer subjects at suboptimal doses than the 3 +3 design.
The mTPI design described above was setup with a target toxicity  (DL T) rate of 29% (EI [28%, 
31%] ) because somewhat higher toxicity  is expected and acceptable in the combination setting . 
The mTPI  design makes decisions using the number of DLT evaluable subjects and the number 
of subjects with DLT. Based on these 2 numbers, the unit probability  mass calculated in each 
region isdefined by  theEIfor the combination setting , with the decision based on the region that
has the largest unit probability  mass, similar to what isdescribed above for the monotherapy
setting.
In the simulation with mTPI , 1 out of 4 subjects may drop out with a probability  of 0.5. Dropout 
is not simulated in the 3 + 3 design, since replacement subject is alway s needed to reach a 
decision.
Settings of S imulation:
5 dose -toxicity  scenarios, each of which with a number of 2 (expected) dose levels
1,000 trials per scenario
Target toxicity  (Pt) for mTPI  design: 29% (EI[28, 31%] )
mTPI : an initial cohort size of 4 followed b y (multiple) cohort size of 4 
Stopping rule formTPI: When there are alrea dy 9DLT evaluable subjects treated at a dose 
level and mTPI  still make s thedecision to treat more subjects at the same dose level, dose 
escalation can be stopped.

APPENDIX 2 MANAGEMENT ALGORITHMS
These general guidelines constitute guidance to the Investigator and may be supplemented by 
discussions with the Medical Monitor representing the Sponsor. The guidance applies to all 
immuno -oncology  (I-O) agents and regimens.
A general principle is that differential diagnoses should be diligently evaluated according to 
standard medical practice. Non-inflammatory  etiologies should be considered and appropriatel y 
treated.
Corticosteroids are a primary  therap y for I-Odrug-related adverse events. The oral equivalent of 
the recommended intravenous (IV)doses may be considered for ambulatory  patients with low-
grade toxicity . The lower bioavailability  of oral corticosteroids should be taken into account 
when switching to the equivalent dose of oral corticosteroids.
Consultation with a medical or surgical specialist, especially  prior to an invasive diagnostic or 
therapeutic procedure, is recommended.
The frequency  and severity  of the related adverse events covered by  these algorithms will depend 
on the I-O agent or regimen being used.

APPENDIX 3 RECIST V1.1
1 ASSESSMENT OF OVERA LL TUMOR B URDEN A ND M EASURA BLE 
DISEA SE
Subjects must have measureable disease to be eligible for this study.
To assess objective response or future progression, it is necessary  to estimate the overall tumor
burden atbaseline and use this as a comparator for subsequent measurements. Measurable 
disease is defined by the presence of at least one measurable tumor lesion. When CT scans have
slice thickness greater than 5 mm, the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the 
slice thickness.
At baseline, tumor lesions/ly mph nodes will be categorized measurable or non-measurable as 
follows:
1.1 Measurable Lesions
Measurable lesions must be accuratel y measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter in 
the plane of the measurement to be recorded) with a minimum size of:
10 mm byCT/MRI scan -(CT/MRI  scan slice thickness no greater than 5 mm)
10 mm caliper measu rement by clinical exam (lesions which cannot be accurately  measured 
with calipers should be recorded as non -measurable)
20 mm by  chest x -ray
Malignant lymph nodes : To be considered pathologically  enlarged andmeasurable, a lymph 
node must be 15 mm in shortaxis when assessed by CT scan (CT scan slice thickness 
recommended to be no greater than 5 mm). At baseline and in follow -up, only the short axis 
will be measured and followed .
1.2 Non- measurable Lesions
All other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter < 10mm or pathological lymph 
nodes with  10 to < 15 mm short axis) , as well as truly  non- measurable lesions.  
Lesions considered truly non-measurable include:  leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or 
pericardial effusion, inflammatory  breast disease, lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, 
abdominal masses/abdominal organomegal y identified by physical exam that in not 
measurable b y reproducible imaging techniques.  
1.3 Special Considerations Regarding L esion Measurability
1.3.1 Bone L esions
Bone scan, PET scan or plain films are notconsidered adequate imaging techniques to 
measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be used to confirm the presence or 
disappearance of bone lesions.

Lytic bone lesions or mixed ly tic-blastic lesions, wit h identifiable softtissue components , that 
can be evaluated by  cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or MRI can be considered 
as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component meets the definition of measurabilit y 
described above.
Blastic bone le sions are non -measurable.
1.3.2 Cystic L esions
Lesions that meet the criteria for radiographically  defined simple cysts should not be 
considered as malignant lesions (neither measurable nor non-measurable) since they are, by 
definition, simple cy sts. 
‘Cystic lesions’ thought to represent cystic metastases can be considered as measurable 
lesions, if they meet the definition of measurability  described above. However, if non-cystic 
lesions are present in the same subject , these are preferred for selection as target lesions.
1.3.3 Lesions with P rior Local Treatment
Tumor lesions situated in a previousl y irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-
regional therapy , are usually  not considered measurable unless there has been demonstrated 
progression in the lesion .  Measurable lesions may be in an irradiated field as long as there is 
documented progression and the lesion(s) can be reproducibl y measured.
1.4 Specifications by  Methods of Measurements
1.4.1 Measurement of Lesions
All measurements should be recorded in metric notation (mm). All baseline evaluations should 
be performed as close as possible to the treatment start and never more than 30 daysbefore the 
beginning of the treatment.
1.4.2 Method of Assessment
The same method of assessment and the same technique shou ld be used to characterize each 
identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow -up. Imaging based evaluation should 
alway s be done rather than clinical examination unless the lesion(s) being followed cannot be 
imaged but are assessable by  clinical exam.
1.4.2.1 CT/MRI S can
CT/MRI is the best currently  available and reproducible method to measure lesions selected for 
response assessment. Measurability  of lesions on CT/MRI scan isbased on the assumption that 
CT/MRI  slice thickness is 5 mm or less. WhenCT scans have slice thickness greater than 5 mm, 
the minimum size for a measurable lesion should be twice the slice thickness.
1.4.2.2 Chest X -ray
Chest CT is preferred over chest X-ray, particularly  when progression is an important endpoint, 
since CT is more sensitive than X-ray, particularly  in identify ing new lesions. However, lesions 
on chest X-ray may be considered measurable if they are clearl y defined and surrounded by 
aerated lung.

1.4.2.3 Clinical L esions 
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial and 10 mm 
diameter as assessed using calipers. For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color 
photograph y including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is suggested. As previously  noted, 
when lesions can be evaluated byboth clinical exam and imaging, imaging evaluation should be 
undertaken since it is more objective and may  also be reviewed at the end of the study .
1.4.2.4 Ultrasound
Ultrasound is notuseful in assessment of lesion size and should not be used as a method of 
measurement. If new lesions are identified by  ultrasound in the course of the study , confirm ation 
by CT or MRI is advised. 
1.4.2.5 Endoscopy, Laparoscopy
The utilization of these techniques for objective tumor evaluation is not advised.
1.4.2.6 Tumor markers 
Tumo r markers alone cannot be used to assess objective tumo r response.

five lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per organ) representative of all involved 
organs should be identified as target lesion sand will be re corded and measured at baseline.
Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be 
representative of all involved organs, and should lend themselves to reproducible repeated
measurements.
A sum ofthediameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target 
lesions will be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be 
included in the sum, then as noted below , only  the short axis is added into the sum. The baseline 
sum diameters will be used as reference to further characterize any  objective tumor regression in 
the measurable dimension of the disease.
2.1.1 Lymph Nodes
Lymph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imaging even if not involved by tumor . Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of 
≥ 15 mm by CT scan . Only  the short axis of these nodes will contribute to the baseline sum. 
Nodes that have a short axis < 10 mm are considered nonpathological and should not be recorded 
or followed.

2.2 Non- target Lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including pathological lymph nodes should be identified as 
non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements are not required and 
these lesions should be followed as ‘present’, ‘absent’, or in rare cases ‘unequivocal 
progression’. In addition, it is possible to record multiple non-target lesions invol ving the same 
organ as a single item on the case record form (e.g. ‘multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes’ or 
‘multiple liver metastases’).
3 TUMOR RESPONSE EVALUATION 
3.1 Evaluation of T arget Lesions
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes 
(whether target or non -target) must have reduction in short axis to < 10 mm.
Partial Response (PR):   At least a30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions,
taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Progressiv e Disease (PD):   At least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum onstudy (this includes the baseline sum if that is the 
smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must a lso demonstrate an 
absolute increase of at least 5 mm. ( Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also 
considered progression).
Stable Disease (SD):   Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify  for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify  for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study .
3.1.1 Special N otes on the Assessment of T arget Lesions
3.1.1.1 Lymph Nodes
Lym ph nodes merit special mention since they are normal anatomical structures which may be 
visible by imagi ng even if not involved by tumor. Pathological nodes which are defined as 
measurable and may  be identified as target lesions must meet the criterion of a short axis of  15 
mm by CT scan . Only  the short axis of these nodes willcontribute to the baseline sum. Nodes 
that have a short axis <10 mm are considered nonpathological and should not be recorded or 
followed.
3.1.1.2 Target L esions th at Become ‘ Too S mall to Measure’
All lesions (nodal and non-nodal) recorded at baseline should have their actual measurements 
recorded at each subsequent evaluatio n, even when very small (e.g. 2 mm). If the radiologist is 
able to provide an actual measure ment , that should be recorde d, even if it is below 5 mm.
However, when such a lesion becomes difficult to assign an exact measure to then:
if it is the opinion of the radiologist that the lesion has likely  disappeared, the meas urement 
should be recorded as 0 mm. 
if the lesion is believed to be present and is faintly  seen but too small to measure, a default 
value of 5 mm should be assigned (note: in case ofa lymph node believed to be present and

faintly  seen but too small to measure, a default value of 5 mm should be assigned in this 
circumstance as well). This default value is derived from the 5 mm CT slice thickness (but 
should not be changed wi th vary ing CT slice thickness).
3.1.1.3 Target L esions that Split or Coalesce on Treatment
When non-nodal lesions ‘fragment’, the longest diameters of the fragmented portions should 
be added together to c alculate the target lesion sum.
As lesions coalesce, a plane between them may be maintained that would aid in obtaining 
maximal diameter measurements of each individual lesion. I f the lesions have truly  coalesced 
such that they are no longer separable, the vector of the longest diameter in this instance 
should be the maximal longest diam eter for the ‘coalesced lesion’
3.2 Evaluation of N on-target Lesions
While some non-target lesions may actuall y be measurable, they need not be measured and 
instead should be assessed only  qualitatively at the time points specified in the protocol. 
Complete Response (CR): Disappea rance of all non-target lesions. All lymph nodes must be 
nonpathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
Non-CR/Non -PD:  Persistence of one or more non -target lesion(s).
Progressive Disease (PD):   Unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions. (Note: the 
appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progression).
3.2.1 Special Notes on Assessment o f Non-target Lesions
The concept of progression of non -target disease requires additional explanation as follows:
3.2.1.1 When the S ubject Also Has M easurable D isease
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening in non-target disease such that, even in presence of SD 
or PR in target disease, the overall tumor burden has increased sufficientl y to merit 
discontinuation of therapy .
A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually  not sufficient to 
quality  for unequ ivocal progression status.
3.2.1.2 When the S ubject Has Only Non-measurable Disease
To achieve ‘unequivocal progression’ on the basis of the non -target disease, there must be an 
overall level of substantial worsening such that the overall tumor burden has increased 
sufficiently  to me rit discontinuation of therap y.
A modest ‘increase’ in the size of one or more non-target lesions is usually  not sufficient to 
quali fy for unequivocal progression status.
Because worsening in non-target disease canno t be easily  quantified (by definition: if all 
lesions are nonmeasurable) a useful test that can be applied when assessing subject s for 
unequivocal progression is to consider if the increase in overall disease burden based on the 
change in non-measurable disease is comparable in magnitude to the increase that would be 
required to declare PD for measurable disease: i.e. an increase in tumor burden representing 
an additional 73% increase in ‘volume’ (which is equivalent to a 20% increase diameter in a

measurab le lesion). Examples include an increase in a pleural effusion from ‘trace’ to ‘large’, 
an increase in lymphangitic disease from localized to widespread, or may be described in 
protocols as ‘sufficient t o require a change in therapy ’.
If ‘unequivocal progr ession’ is seen, the subject should be considered to have had overall PD 
at that point. 
3.2.1.3 Tumor Markers
Tumor markers will not be used to assess objective tumor response s.
3.3 New L esions
The appearance of new malignant lesions denotes disease progression. The finding of a new 
lesion should be unequivocal: i.e. not attributable to differences in scanning technique, change in 
imaging modalit y or findings thought to represent something other than tumor (for example, 
some ‘new’ bone lesions may be simply  healing orflare of pre-existing lesions). This is 
particularl y important when the subject ’s baseline lesions show partial or complete response. For 
example, necrosis of a liver lesion may be reported on a CT scan report as a ‘new’ cystic lesion, 
which it is not.
A lesion identified on a follow -up study  in an anatomical location that was notscanned at 
baseline is considered a new lesion and will indicate disease progression. An example of this is 
the subject who has visceral disease at baseline and while on study  has a CT or MRI brain scan
ordered which reveals metastases. The subject ’s brain metastases are considered to be evidence 
of PD even if he/she did not have brain imaging at baseline.
If a new lesion is equivocal, for example because of its small size, cont inued therapy  and follow -
up evaluation will clarify if it represents truly  new disease. If repeat scans confirm there is 
definitely a new lesion, then progression should be declared using the date of the initial scan.
4 RESPONSE C RITERIA
4.1 Time Point Response
Aresponse assessment should occur at each time point specified in the protocol .
For subject s who have measurable disease at baseline Table 1provides a summary  of the 
overall response status calculation at each time point.

4.1.1 Missing Assessments and Not Evaluable Designation
When no imaging/measurement is done at all at a particular time point, the subject isnot 
evaluable (NE) at that time point. If only a subset of lesion measurements are made at an 
assessment, the case is also considered NE at that time point, unless a conv incing argument can 
be made that the contribution of the individual missing lesion(s) would not have change dthe 
assigned time point response.
4.1.2 Confirmation Scans
Verification of Response: Confirmation of PR and CR is required within 4 weeks to ensure 
responses identified are not the result of measurement error.
4.2 Best Overall Response: All Time Points
The best overall response is determined once all the data for the subject is known. Itis the best 
response recorded from the start of the study  treatment until the end of treatment taking into 
account any requirement for confirmation .The subject ’s best overall response assignment will 
depend on the findings of both target and non -target disease and will also take into consideration 
the appearance of new le sions.
Best response is defined as the best response across all time points with subsequent confirmation. 
Complete or partial responses may be claimed only if the criteria for each are met at a 
subsequent time point as specified in the protocol (generally  4 weeks later).
In this circumstance, the best overall response can be interpreted asspecified in Table 2.When 
SD is believed to be best response, it must meet the protocol specified minimum time from 
baseline. Measurements must have met the SD criteria at least once after study  entry at a 
minimum interval (in general not less than 6 –8 weeks) that is defined in the study  protocol.

aIf a CR is truly met at first time point, then any disease seen at a subsequent time point, even disease meeting PR 
criteria relative to baseline, makes the disease PD at that point (since disease must have reappeared after CR). 
Best response would depend on whether minimum duration for SD was met. However, sometimes ‘CR’ may be 
claimed when subsequent scans suggest small lesions were likely still present and in factthe subject had PR, not 
CR at the first time point. Under these circumstances, the original CR should be changed to PR and the best 
response is PR.
4.3 Duration of Response
4.3.1 Duration of Overall Response
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for 
CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively  documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest measurements 
recorded on stud y).

4.3.2 Duration of Stable Disease
Stable disease is measured from the start of thetreatment (in randomized trials, from date of 
randomization) until the criteria for progression are met, taking as reference the smallest sum on 
study  (if the baseline sum is the smallest, this is the reference for calculation of PD).

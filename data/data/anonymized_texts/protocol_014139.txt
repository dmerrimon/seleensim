NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      8 ABSTRACT  
 
The Aurora A  kinase has been shown to play an important role in neuroblastoma growth.  Inhibition 
of Aurora A kinase activity attenuates the growth of neuroblastoma cells.  MLN8237 is a selective 
small molecule inhibitor of Aurora A kinase that has completed pediatric  single -agent phase I 
testing, as well as stage 1 phase 2 testing in patients with Neuroblastoma. MLN8237 showed 
activity against the NCI -sponsored Pediatric Preclinical Testing Program neuroblastoma in vivo  
panel that exceeded the activity level observed with chemotherapy agents routinely used in the 
treatment of neuroblastoma.  Additional in vitro  and in vivo  studies have shown that Aurora A kinase 
inhibitors result in enhanced cytotoxicity when used in combination with chemotherapy.  Irinotecan 
and temoz olomide is a commonly used salvage regimen for patients with relapsed or refractory 
neuroblastoma.  This combination has a modest objective response rate (16%) and is well -
tolerated, suggesting that it will provide a useful platform for the study of novel compounds in 
combination with chemotherapy.  Preclinical studies demonstrate marked enhancement of anti -
neuroblastoma activity with the addition of MLN8237 to irinotecan and temozolomide.  This study 
therefore evaluates the tolerability and activity of MLN 8237 in combination with irinotecan and 
temozolomide in children with refractory or relapsed neuroblastoma.  Patients receive irinotecan (50 
mg/m2/dose IV) and temozolomide (100 mg/m2/dose orally) once daily for 5 days along with 
MLN8237 orally once daily for 7 days.  The doses of irinotecan and temozolomide will be fixed and 
the dose of MLN8237 will be dose- escalated.  In the phase I portion of the study, the primary aims 
are to determine the recommended phase II doses of this combination, describe the tox icity of this 
combination, and characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of MLN8237 and irinotecan when used in 
combination.  In the phase II portion of the study, the primary aim is to determine the objective 
response rate of this combination in patients w ith relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma.  With 
Amendment 5, the tolerability and pharmacokinetics of an MLN8237 oral solution will be evaluated.  
Optional correlative studies will evaluate UGT1A1 polymorphisms as predictors of toxicity and 
archival tumor tissue Aurora A expression as a predictor of response with this combination.  
 
 
Hypothesis:  
 
We hypothesize that:  
 
1. MLN8237 combined with irinotecan and temozolomide  will be tolerable in children with 
recurrent or refractory neuroblastoma.  
2. The primary toxicity of the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide will be 
myelosuppression.  
3. The combination of MLN8237 with irinotecan and temozolomide will result in enhanced 
antitumor activity compared with irinotecan and temozolomide.

Dose level 1 was completed in Part A of the study.  With Amendment 3, evaluation resumed  with 
evaluation of dose level 1B in which all patients receive mandatory myeloid growth factor support 
and mandatory diarrhea prophylaxis with cefixime or cefpodoxime.   Dose levels 1B, 2B, and 3B 
were evaluated and the maximum tolerated dose with MLN8237 enteric c oated tablets was dose 
level 2B .  
 
With Amendment 5, the phase 2 portion of the study is open to patients who are able to swallow 
intact pills.  All p atients on the phase 2 portion will  begin therapy at dose level 2B  and will utilize 
the enteric c oated tablet formulation.  
 
In addition, w ith Amendment 5, a cohort evaluating an MLN8237 oral solution is open to patients 
who are not able to swallow intact pills.  Based upon adult bioavailability data, evaluation of this  
oral solution cohort will begin at dose level 1B , with possible escalation to 2B or de- escalation to -
1B.  The dose will be assigned at study entry .  These patients will be required to participate in 
pharmacokinetic testing.            
 
Disease evaluation will take place during the third week of cycles 2, 4, 8, and then every 4 cycles.  
Patients may receive up to 34 cycles of therapy (~2 years) on study in the absence of dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) or progressive disease.  Decisions regarding additional therapy on this study 
will be made by the study chair and treating physician in collaboration with the vice chair and 
sponsor.  Disease evaluation after cycles

NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      11 2.0 BACKGROUND  
 
2.1 Neuroblastoma  
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid cancer of childhood. [1]  Most patients are 
initially diagnosed prior to 10 years of age.  Approximately 50% of patients present with initially 
metastatic disease.  Many of these patients are either refractory to initial therapy or develop 
recurrent disease after receiving multimodal therapy.  The outcome for patients with recurrent or 
refractory disease remains poor. Nov el approaches to treating these patients are required to 
improve their outcome.  
 
2.2 Irinotecan and Temozolomide for Relapsed and Refractory Neuroblastoma   
The combination of irinotecan and temozolomide has demonstrated activity in several pediatric 
solid tum ors.  In a pediatric phase I study utilizing a protracted irinotecan schedule (once daily for 
5 days each week for two weeks), one patient with Ewing sarcoma achieved a complete 
response to therapy. [2]  Another patient with Ewing sarcoma and a patient with neuroblastoma 
had part ial responses.   
 
With this initial experience, several studies have evaluated this combination specifically in 
patients with neuroblastoma.  A Children’s Oncology Group phase II study was conducted in 59 
patients with recurrent or refractory disease using temozolomide 100 mg/m2/day orally x 5 days 
and irinotecan 10 mg/m2/day IV once daily for 5 days  each week for two weeks. [3]  The objective 
response rate was 16%.  Stable disease was documented as best response to therapy in an 
additional 47% of patients.  A second study in patients with neuroblastoma evaluated oral 
irinotecan together with temozolomide. [4]  This combination resulted in 1 patient out of 14 total 
patients with a complete response as well as stabilization of disease in an additional 6 patients.   
A report of a single institution study describes 49 patients with neuroblastoma treated with 
temozo lomide 150 mg/m2/day orally x 5 days and irinotecan 50 mg/m2/day IV once daily for 5 
days every three weeks . [5]  One third of patients (12/36) treated in this series showed tumor 
regression, although only 3 of the 36 patients evaluable for response had a complete or partial 
response.   
 
The incidence of thrombocytopenia or neutropenia >  grade 3 associated with this combination 
appears to be relatively low.  In the COG phase II study in neuroblastoma, 9% and 25% of 
patients experienced >  grade 3 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, respectively. [3]  In one case 
series in patients with Ewing sarcoma, 11% and 12% of cycles were associated with > grade 3 
thrombocytopenia or neutropenia, respectively. [6]  These results suggest that an additional 
myelosuppressive agent could be added to this combination.  Moreover, the incidence of grade 3 
or 4 diarrhea was <  5% in these studies, suggesting that non- hematologic toxicity is also 
manageable with this combination. [3,6]  Irinotecan- associated diarrhea can be abrogated with the 
use of oral antibiotics, including cefixime. [7] 
 
This protocol utilizes irinotecan administered once daily for 5 days for one week rather than two 
weeks.  This schedule has been selected for several reasons.  First, irinotecan administered with 
temozolomide on this schedule has activity in patients with neuroblastoma. [5]  Second, 
experience in patients with rhabdomyosarcoma on COG protocol ARST0121 has shown that the 
antitumor activity of this combination is not compromised by  the use of a one week schedule. [8]  
Third, the one week schedule is advantageous in terms of cost and patient convenience.     
 
2.3   Role of Aurora A Kinase in Neuroblastoma   
The Aurora family of serine/threonine protein kinases plays a critical role in the regulation of 
chromosomal segregation and cytokinesis during mitotic progression. [9]The Aurora A kinase 
gene is amplified or overexpressed in many tumors, including colon, breast, pancreatic, bladder 
cancers, and in neuroblastoma cell lines. [10,11] Aurora A overexpression is associated with 
aneuploidy and centrosome amplification, and overexpression of Aurora A kinase results in the 
transformation of normal cells, supporting th e hypothesis that Aurora A is an oncogene.  Given 
this role, investigators have begun to study this kinase in the context of human cancer.   
 
While its importance in many pediatric solid tumors remains poorly understood, a role for Aurora 
A kinase in the gr owth of neuroblastoma has been reported.  Otto and colleagues reported that 
Aurora A interacts with MYCN, and sequesters it from proteolytic degradation. [10]This group 
further demonstrated that Aurora A stabilizes the MYCN protein through a direct physical 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      12 interaction and interferes with ubiquitin- mediated degradation in a kinase independent manner. 
Aurora A protein expression is enhanced by MYC N expression and MYCN protein levels decline 
if aurora A gene expression is inhibited. [10]  Suppression of Aurora A expression using shRNA 
inhibited the growth of MYCN -dependent neuroblastoma cell lines. [10]  Additional work has 
shown that 8 of 9 neuroblastoma cell lines over -expressed Aurora A mRNA and all 9 cell lines 
showed high levels of Aurora A protein. [12]  Aurora A mRNA and protein expression in human 
neuro blastoma tumors appears to be correlated with established adverse prognostic factors in 
this disease, including advanced stage and MYCN amplification. [12]  Increased Aurora A mRNA 
level was associated with inferior progression- free survival, even after controlling for COG risk 
category.  
 
MLN8237 is a small molecule, ATP -competitive, reversible inhibitor of Aurora A kinase that is 
being developed for the treatment of advanced malignancies.  The National Cancer Institute’s 
Pediatr ic Preclinical Testing Program (PPTP) tested MLN8237 against their in vitro  panel at 
concentrations ranging from 1.0 nM to 10 mM and against their in vivo  panel at a dose of 20 
mg/kg administered orally twice daily x 5 days repeated weekly. Treatment durat ion was 6 weeks 
for solid tumor xenografts, with a total treatment/observation period of 6 weeks for all xenografts. 
MLN8237 significantly increased event -free survival EFS in 31 of 38 (82%) evaluable solid tumor 
xenografts. [13]  Maintained complete responses were observed in 4 of 5 neuroblastoma 
xenografts. [13]The very high level of in vivo  activity observed against the neuroblastoma panel far 
exceeds that observed for standard agents evaluated by the PPTP that are used in the treatment 
of neuroblastoma (e.g., vincristine, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide) . 
 
2.4 Preclinical Activity of Aurora A Kinase Inhibition with Other Cytotoxic Agents  
MLN8237 added to docetaxel has been shown to result in synergistic reductions in tumor volume 
in xenograft models of breast and prostate cancer. [14]  In these studies, MLN8237 was given 
orally daily for 21 days and docetaxel was administered IV once weekly for 3 doses.  Synergistic 
cytotoxicity was observed at both low and high MLN8237 doses.  
 
Additional studies have combined MLN8237 with rituximab in preclinical models of B -cell non -
Hodgkin’s lymphoma. [15]  In these studies, at least additive cytotoxicity was observed with the 
combination compared with mice treated with single agent therapy.  Moreover, mice treated with 
the combination of MLN8237 and rit uximab showed prolonged survival compared to mice treated 
with single agent therapy.  These results suggest that additive effects of MLN8237 are not 
restricted to combinations wi th M- phase specific agents.

Treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with siRNA di rected against Aurora A signifi cantly 
attenuates cell growth. [12]  Combined treatment of these cells with this siRNA and doxorubicin 
resulted in enhanced cytotoxicity. [12]Preliminary in vitro studies indicate that MLN8237 added to  
irinotecan or temozolomide results in at least additive cytotoxicity against neuroblastoma cell lines 
(Y. Mosse, ASCO 2010 Annual Meeting, Abstract # 50614; see Figure 1for results with irinotecan). 
Formal evaluation for synergy demonstrated moderate synergy for MLN8237 in combination with 
irinotecan (combination indices < 1), table 1.  
 
Table 1. 
 
 
Follow -up studies have evaluated MLN8237 in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide in 
an in vivo preclinic al model of neuroblastoma.[24]  Simultaneous treatment with this  combination 
prevented tumor growth and also resulted in prolonged survival compared to mice treated with 
either single -agent MLN8237 or irinotecan/temoz olomide (Y. Mosse, ASCO 2010 Annual Meeting, 
Abstract #50614Figure 2 ).These results suggest that MLN8237 provides at least additive 
cytotoxicity when combined with chemotherapy.

NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      14 2.5 Preclinical Pharmacokinetic and Toxicity Data of MLN8237  
MLN8237 is a selective ATP -competitive inhibitor of Aurora A kinase.  The drug shows good oral 
bioavailability.  The major route of metabolism involves glucuronidation.  The target plasma 
concentration for maximal efficacy based on preclinical studies is approximately 1 micromolar.  
The dose- limiting toxicities observed in animal studies included mucosal toxicity and rever sible 
myelosuppression.      
At clinically relevant concentrations, MLN8237 is not anticipated to interact with drugs 
metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Potential drug- drug interactions may occur when 
MLN8237 is co- administered with a P -glycoprotein substrate. Cross -reactivity with the GABA A 
receptor has been observed at plasma concentrations above clinical concentrations, raising the 
possibility of interactions with benzodiazepines and alcohol.   
Specific preclinical modeling of drug- drug interactions between MLN8237 and irinotecan has 
been performed by Millennium (Sudha Parasuraman, personal communication).  Human liver 
microsome studies evaluated the effect of irinotecan and its metabolites on MLN8237 metabolism 
as well as the effect of MLN8237 on irinotecan and SN -38 metabolism.   MLN8237 
glucuronidation and hydroxylation were not inhibited by irinotecan or its metabolites when tested 
at concentrations up to 10 times their clinically relevant concentrations.  In contrast, MLN8237 
resulted in concentration- dependent inhibition of the conversion of irinotec an to SN -38 and also 
glucuronidation of SN -38.  The IC 50 values for inhibition of each of these steps were 18 µM and 4 
µM, respectively.  Based on the observed C max values of 2- 10 µM in COG protocol ADVL0812 
with single -agent MLN8237, these IC 50 values suggest the possibility of an impact on irinotecan 
metabolism at clinically relevant concentrations of MLN8237.  These findings support the 
inclusion of mandatory pharmacokinetic sampling at Day 4 of cycle 1 during the phase I portion of 
the study.   
 
2.6 Hum an Pharmacokinetics and Toxicity with MLN8237  
MLN8237 is absorbed orally with a median T max of 2 hours.  The half -life is approximately 18 
hours and steady state concentrations are achieved after 7 days of once daily dosing.  Exposure 
appears to be dose- proportional over clinically relevant concentrations.  
 
Toxicities observed in adult phase I studies of MLN8237 have been consistent with preclinical 
studies.  The most common toxicities have included mucositis and myelosuppression.  
Somnolence and confusion have also been observed at higher doses and have been attributed to 
effects on the GABA A receptor.  While diarrhea has been reported in approximately 40% of 
patients, no cases of dose limiting diarrhea have been noted.  The recommended dose in adults 
is 50  mg by mouth twice daily for 7 days followed by 14 days of rest.   
 
COG protocol ADVL0812 evaluated MLN8237 (capsule formulation) in children with refractory 
solid tumors and leukemia ( Table). Thirty seven  subjects were  enrolled on the pediatric phase 1 
study of MLN8237. Twenty -four subjects were enrolled and 21 were fully evaluable for toxicity on 
stratum A1 (once daily dosing) and 13 enrolled and 11 fully evaluable  on stratum A2 (BID 
dosing). On stratum A1, hematologic DLTs were not observed until dose l evel 4 (100 
mg/m2/dose), with 3 subjects experiencing 5 total DLTs (ranging from Grade 4 neutrophils, Grade 
4 platelets, and thrombocytopenia that caused a delay of >14 days between treatment cycles). 
One subject on stratum A1 experienced a Grade 4 mood al teration/depression DLT at dose level 
3 (80 mg/m2/dose) and one patient experience dose- limiting mucositis at dose level 1 (45 
mg/m2/dose). On stratum A2, two of six evaluable subjects experienced a hematologic DLT 
(Grade 4 neutrophils) at dose level 1 ( 40 mg/m2/dose; equivalent to dose level 3 on stratum A1, 
80 mg/m2/day divided BID), and 1 of those subjects also experienced a non- hematologic DLT 
(Grade 3 mucositis).  Therefore, there was a de- escalation to dose level -1 (30 mg/m2/dose; 
equivalent to dose level 2 on stratum A1, 60 mg/m2/day divided BID). In addition, 5/11  patients 
have had rash/desquamation (grade >  2) or hand foot syndrome on the bid schedule versus 1/21  
on the once daily dosing schedule. Grade 1 diarrhea was reported in 4 of 21 patients.  Higher 
grade diarrhea was not observed.   Of the 5 patients enrolled at dose level -1 of stratum A2, one 
patient had dose- limiting elevations in alkaline phosphatase.  However, despite the fact that the 
BID dosing regimen appears to be well -tolerated in adult studies, there is a different toxicity 
profile in pediatric patients with more frequent myelosuppression causing delays as well as hand-
foot syndrome.  This dosing s trategy thus appears to be less tolerable overall in children.  
Therefore,  the recommended phase 2 dose is 80 mg/m2 dose once daily (dose level 3 on stratum 
A1).[16] 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      15  
Following an initial dose at 45- 80 mg/m2, all subjects tested on ADVL0812 showed peak plasma 
concentrations of MLN8237 well in excess of 1 µM, with peak concentrations in the range of 2- 10 
µM. MLN8237 was rapidly absorbed after an oral dose, with a median (range) T max of 2.3 (1.1-
3.1) hours. At the recommended single -agent phase 2 dose (80 mg/m2 PO once daily) the mean  
AUC 0-24was 75.2 µM•h.   Wide interpatient variability in drug disposition was observed.  The 
median (range) half -life was 7.34 (6.13- 8.64) hours.  The median (range) apparent clearance 
(CL/F) was 34 (16- 59) ml/min/m2, and CL/F was similar in males (36 ml/min/m2) and females (32 
ml/min/m2). These preliminary pediatric pharmacokinetic results suggest that drug concentrations 
used in preclinical studies are clinically attainable at the dosing range proposed in this study.

MLN8237 was initially formulated as a capsule.  Considerable inter -patient variability in the 
pharmacokinetic profile of this agent was observed, and was thought to be at least partially 
attributable to its formulation.  For this reason an enteric -coated tablet has been developed.  This 
formulation results in more consist ent pharmacokinetic results.  In adults (n=22) the relative 
bioavailability of the enteric coated tablet formulation in reference to the original powder in 
capsule formulation was 90% (90% CI, 74.4, 108.8).{Dees, 2012 #34}  In addition, the enteric 
coated tablet  formulation has already been shown to be well -tolerated in adults using doses of up 
to 40 mg by mouth twice daily, which is 80% of the adult MTD with the previous capsule 
formulation.  This study will utilize the enteric -coated tablet formulation for patients who are able 
to swallow intact pills .   
 
 
2.7 Clinical Activity of MLN8237  
In adult phase I studies of MLN8237, activity was observed in a patient with liposarcoma and 
ovarian carcinoma.  Further single- agent evaluation is ongoing in adults with hematologic 
malignancies and ovarian cancer.  Evaluation of MLN8237 with taxane- based chemotherapy is 
ongoing in adults with ovarian or prostate cancer.   
 
Initial d ata regarding the antitumor activity of MLN8237 in pediatric patients  have recently been 
published. [16]  Of 33 children with relapsed or refractory solid tumors treated on ADVL0812, one 
patient with hepatoblastoma had a partial response.  In addition, four patients with neuroblastoma 
had prolonged stable disease for 6, 9, 10, and 35 cycles of single- agent MLN8237.  
 
2.8 UGT1A1  Polymorphisms and Irinotecan -Associated Toxicity 
The active form of irinotecan is SN38.  The UGT1A1 enzyme is thought to be the predominant 
enzyme involved in inactivating SN38 via glucuronidation.  A growing body of literature has 
implicated polymorphisms in the promoter region of UGT1A1  gene in inter -patient variability in 
irinotecan exposure and toxicity. [17]  The UGT1A1*28  allele leads to reduced expression of the 
gene and therefore diminished inactivation of SN38. [17]  Several groups have demonstrated that 
adults who are homozygous for the UGT1A1*28 allele have an increased risk of irinotecan-
associated toxicity , particularly neutropenia. [17-20]Other groups have found that this effect is not 
seen with lower doses of irinotecan administered on a protracted schedule. [18- 20] 
 
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      16 MLN8237 also undergoes glucuronidation during its metabolism, which is partially mediated by 
UGT1A1 .  Therefore, genotyping of UGT1A1  is of particular interest in this first study evaluating 
irinotecan used in combination with MLN8237.  An optional correlative study wi ll involve 
genotyping patients for UGT1A1  promoter polymorphisms and correlating genotype with toxicity 
in patients receiving irinotecan and MLN8237.   
 
 
Evaluation of Tissue Aurora A Expression  
Increased tumor expression of Aurora A mRNA and protein has r ecently been shown to correlate 
with adverse prognostic factors and adverse outcome in patients with neuroblastoma. [12]  It 
remains unclear whether Aurora A mRNA and/or protein expression will correlate with response 
to Aurora kinase inhibitors, such as MLN8237.  An optional correlative study will involve 
evaluation of Aurora A expression in archival neuroblastoma tumor tissue for correlation with 
clinical response.  
 
2.9 Evaluation of AURKA Polymorphisms and Response to Aurora A Kinase Inhibition  
The gene encoding Aurora A kinase, AURKA , contains two missense polymorphisms with minor 
allele frequencies greater than 10%:  rs1047972 (18% minor allele frequency) and rs2273535 
(30% minor allele frequency).  Several studies have evaluated a potential role for these and other 
AURKA polymorphisms in the risk of developing a range of cancers, with mixed results[25- ,28].  
In addition, there is some evidence that the presence of AURKA polymorphism may impact the 
clinical behavior of breast or gastric cancer [29,30].  To date, only one small study has described 
the impact of AURKA  polymorphisms on toxicity and pharmacokinetics of a pan- Aurora kinase 
inhibitor, with negative findings [31].  It remains unc lear whether AURKA  polymorphisms might be 
associated with response to a specific Aurora A kinase inhibitor.  An optional correlative study will 
involve evaluation of two common AURKA  missense polymorphisms and response to protocol 
therapy.    
 
2.10 Summary  and Rationale for Clinical Use of MLN8237 with Irinotecan and 
Temozolomide  
The combination of irinotecan and temozolomide is well- tolerated and provides a modest degree 
of anti -tumor activity in heavily pre- treated patients.  The toxicity profile and activity level suggest 
that this combination may serve as a useful platform onto which novel compounds may be added.  
MLN8237 demonstrates compelling single- agent activity in preclinical models of neuroblastoma.  
Aurora A kinase inhibition results in at least additive cytotoxicity when used in combination with 
other chemotherapy agents.  This trial therefore will evaluate MLN8237 added to irinotecan and 
temozolomide.  While both irinotecan and MLN8237 are metabolized via UGT1A1, neither drug 
has been shown to induce or inhibit UGT1A1.  Patients in the phase I portion of this trial will have 
detailed pharmacokinetic assessment of i rinotecan and MLN8237 levels.  Optional studies 
include assessment of UGT1A1 and AURKA polymorphisms and tumor Aurora A expression 
levels.   
  
2.11 Rationale for Amendment #3  
The protocol initially opened to enrollment using protocol version Amendment #2.  Six patients 
enrolled to dose level 1.  Two patients experienced protocol -defined dose- limiting toxicities during 
the first cycle of therapy. One patient developed grade 3 mucositis, prolonged grade 4 
neutropenia, and treatment delay due to ongoing thrombocytopenia , in addition to grade 3 
dehydration, anorexia and febrile neutropenia.  The other patient had treatment delay due to 
ongoing neutropenia.  In addition, three of six patients experienced grade 3 diarrhea in dose level 
1.  In  dose level 1, the use of myeloid growth factor support and cephalosporin diarrhea 
prophylaxis were not mandated.  After review of the toxici ty profile seen in dose level 1, the study 
committee determined that further development of this combination should include mandatory 
myel oid growth factor support and cephalosporin diarrhea prophylaxis.  Amendment #3 makes 
this change and resumes evaluation of this combination with dose level 1B that uses the same 
doses of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide as ev aluated in dose level 1, but with 
mandatory supportive care measures.   
 
 
 
 
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      17 2.12 Rationale for Amendment #5  
Amendment #4 was an administrative amendment.   
 
Amendment #5 designates the recommended phase 2 dose for this regimen when used with 
enteric coated tablets.  After Amendment #3, dose levels 1B, 2B, and 3B were evaluated in the 
phase 1 portion of the study.  At dose level 1B, 0 / 6 patients had first -course DLT.  At dose level 
2B, 1 / 6 patients had first -course DLT (prolonged grade 4 neut ropenia).  At dose level 3B, 2 / 4 
evaluable patients had first -course DLT (prolonged grade 4 neutropenia; failure to meet platelet 
criteria by Day 35 of course 1).   This experience established the recommended phase 2 dose as 
dose level 2B  when used with MLN8237 enteric coated tablets .  With Amendment 5, the phase 2 
portion of the study is open to patients who are able to swallow intact pills.  Patients on the phase 
2 portion will begin therapy at dose level 2B  and will utilize the enteric coated tablet formulation.  
   
Amendment #5 als o adds a cohort of patients treated with an MLN8237 oral solution.  This  new 
solution will provide access to patients who are unable to swallow intact pills.  The 
pharmacokinetics of an oral solution formulation of MLN8237 was evaluated in 17 adult patients 
who participated in a cross -over relative bioavailability study evaluating both the powder -in-
capsule formulation (with similar bioavailability to the current enteric coated tablet formulation) 
and the oral solution. The geometric mean ratios (oral solution in reference to the powder -in-
capsule) for exposure  (AUC inf) and peak plasma concentration (C max) were determined as 1.26 
(90% CI 1.09- 1.47) and 1.90 (1.52- 2.37), respectively (Investigator Brochure).  Based upon these 
results, pediatric patient s receiving single- agent MLN8237 as the oral solution are recommended 
to receive 60 mg/m2/dose instead of the standard pediatric dose of 80 mg/m2 obtained with intact 
pills.  In the context of the current combination regimen in which the recommended phase 2 
MLN8237 dose wi th enteric coated tablets is 60 mg/m2/dose, patients in the oral solution cohort 
will begin therapy at dose level 1B with 45 mg/m2 MLN8237.  Patient s in this cohort will 
exclusively receive the oral solution and will be required to participate in pharmacokinetic testing.     
 
Amendment #5 also changes the dose modification procedures to utilize the existing dose levels 
rather than using 25% dose reduct ions.  This change will facilitate dose rounding in a more 
uniform manner based upon the existing protocol dosing nomograms.     
 
Amendment #5 also updates NANT response criteria, including criteria for evaluable disease.   
 
2.13 Rationale for Amendment #6  
Experience with this regimen prior to Amendment #6 has demonstrated that hematologic toxicity 
is the primary dose- limiting toxicity (DLT).  However, some DLTs have been uncomplicated grade 
4 neutropenia for > 1 week (to date, one episode in course 1 in the phase II portion in the 
absence of other DLT) or uncomplicated thrombocytopenia requiring platelet transfusions more 
than twice in a 1 week period (to date, one episode in course 1 in the phase II portion in the 
absence of other DLT).  Having grade 4 neu tropenia for > 1 week or need for multiple platelet 
transfusions during a nadir is consistent with the degree of hematologic toxicity seen in other 
common regimens used for patients with newly diagnosed high- risk neuroblastoma and in some 
regimens used in patients with relapsed disease.  Therefore, with Amendment #6, these elements 
of the definition of hematologic DLT are removed.  Hematologic DLT will be defined solely on the 
basis of delays in starting subsequent courses beyond day 36 due to failure to recover counts.  
Day 36 has been updated from Day 35, as that would be a true two week delay, and allowing for 
patients to stay on a Monday start schedule.  
   
Prior to Amendment #6, the statistical design allowed up to 6 patients from the phase I portion of  
the trial to contribute to the phase II portion of the trial.  Given early evidence of activity of this 
regimen, there is a desire to complete a full independent phase II evaluation of this regimen.  
Amendment #6 formally separates the phase I and phase I I portions of the study and will require 
an additional 6 patients evaluable for response.  Patient accrual to the phase II portion has been 
rapid, such that enrolling an additional 6 patients is feasible.  
 
Amendment #6 also updates eligibility and response criteria for uniformity with other current 
active NANT clinical trials.  The consent form and drug information section have been updated to 
include updated risk tables based upon the most recent MLN8237 Investigators Brochure.  
Additional minor edits are also included.   
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      18 2.14 Rationale for Amendment #7  
This amendment reflects the change of institution for Steven DuBois, MD, Study Chairperson and 
IND holder, from University of California, San Francisco to Dana- Farber Cancer Institute.   An 
additional update to NANT participating sites includes a change in Principal Investigator for 
Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto from Sylvain Baruchel, MD to Meredith Irwin, MD .   
 
 
2.15 Rationale for Amendment #8  
This amendment reflects the change in NANT Site Principal Investigator for Seattle Children’s 
Hospital from Julie Park, MD to Navin Pinto, MD ; the change in NANT Site Principal Investigator 
for Lucile Packard Children’s Hospital from Clare Twist , MD to Sheri Spunt, MD; and the change 
in NANT  Site Principal Investigator for C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital from Gregory Yanik, MD to 
Rajen Mody, MD.  This also includes the removal of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center as 
a participating site.

Prior to the start of each cycle of therapy, patients must meet organ function requirements listed 
in section 3.2.10, with the exception of platelet and ANC criteria which differ from entry criteria:   
 
• Patients in any portion of the study entering the stu dy with platelets >  100,000/uL  
(transfusion independent)  and ANC > 1000/uL must recover to platelets > 
75,000/uL (transfusion independent) and ANC > 750/uL (off any myeloid growth 
factors for more than 24 hours) prior to the start of the next cycle of 
therapy.Patients in the phase 2 portion entering the study with bone marrow 
disease and  platelets < 100,000/uL or ANC < 1000/uL must recover to platelets 
> 50,000/uL (with transfusions) and ANC > 750/uL (off any myeloid growth 
factors for more than 24 hours) prior to the start of the next cycle.   
 
Disease evaluation will take place during the third week of cycles 2, 4, 8, and then every 4 cycles.  
Patients may receive up to 34 cycles of therapy (~2 years) on study in the absence of dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT)  or progressive disease.   Decisions regarding additional therapy on this 
study will be made by the study chair and treating physician in collaboration with the vice chair 
and sponsor.  
 
4.2  Drug Administration  
Please note the need for pharmacokinetic blood draws on Days 4 and 5 when choosing start date 
for Cycle 1.  
 
Doses should be adjusted based upon height and weight obtained within 1 week prior to the start 
of each cycle.   
 
Patients who enrolled during the Phase 1 portion and who remain on therapy shoul d continue to 
follow guidelines for the oral solution cohort with the following exception:  patients taking the 
enteric coated tablet no longer need to fast before or after MLN8237 except as indicated below .  
 Disease evaluation after cycles 
2, 4, 8,  and then  every 4 cycles.  
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      25  
 
4.2.1  MLN8237  
MLN8237 will be given once daily by mouth on days 1- 7 of each 21- day cycle.   On days 
1-5, the dose should be given one hour prior to the start of the irinotecan infusion and at 
the same time as the dose of temozolomide on those days.   
 
For patients in the phase 2 portion,  the dose of MLN823 7 will be 60 mg/m2 (dose level 
2B) using exclusively the enteric coated tablet The dose should be rounded to the 
nearest 10 mg using the dosing table in Appendix II , with doses capped at 2 m2.  Tablets 
should not be crushed, split, or chewed. The dose can be taken either on an empty 
stomach or with food on Days 6  and 7, though on Days 1- 5 should be taken without food 
as the dose is taken at the same time as temozolomide (see below) . If a patient vomits 
after taking a dose, it should not be re- dosed.     
 
For patients in the oral solution cohort, the dose of MLN8237 will be based upon the dose 
level assigned at study entry.  The oral solution may be administered by mouth, via 
nasogastric tube, or via gastrostomy tube.  The calculated dose should be rounded do wn 
to the nearest 0.5 mg (0.1 mL of the 5 mg/mL oral solution).  The dose must  be taken on 
an empty stomach (NPO two hours before and one hour after each dose).  If a patient 
vomits after taking a dose, it should not be re- dosed.     
 
 
 EXAMPLES  
o Assigned dose 45 mg/m2 and BSA 0.83 m2  Calculated dose = 37.35 
mg  Round down to 37.0 mg  Administer 7.4 mL of 5 mg/mL solution  
 
o Assigned dose 45 mg/m2 and BSA 0.84  m2  Calculated dose = 37.8 
mg  Round down to 37.5 mg  Administer 7.5 mL of 5 mg/mL solution  
 
 
For both formulations of the drug, s ystemic  antacids (both H2 receptor antagonists and 
proton pump inhibitors) may alter MLN8237 exposure  and should be avoided during 
MLN8237 treatment.   Locally -acting antacids should not be taken simultaneously with 
MLN8237 but antacids  can be given up to 2 hours prior or 2 hours following MLN8237 
administration.  
 
4.2.2  Temozolomide  
Temozolomide will be given at a dose of 100 mg/m2/dose orally on days 1- 5 of each 21-
day cycle.  The dose for patients < 0.5 m2 is 3.3 mg/kg/dose, respectively.  The dose 
should be rounded based on the dosing table in Appendix III , with doses capped at 2 m2.  
The dose should be given one hour prior to irinotecan infusion and should be given at the 
same time as the dose of MLN8237.  The dose should be taken on an empty stomach 
(NPO one hour before and one hour after each dose).  If a patient vomits within 20 
minutes of taking a dose, the dose should be re- dosed.  If a patient vomits more than 20 
minutes from taking a dose, the dose should not be re- dosed.   
 
For patients unable to swallow pills,  temozolomide capsules can be opened and drug 
administered using t he instructions given in Appendix IV.   Alternatively, an 
extemporaneous suspension can be prepared according to the instructions given in 
section 6.3.   
 
4.2.3  Irinotecan  
Irinotecan will be given at a dose of 50 mg/m2/dose IV over 1 hour on days 1- 5 of eac h 
21-day cycle.  
 
For patients with double- lumen central venous catheters who will have pharmacokinetic 
sampling performed in cycle 1 (i.e. all patients in the oral solution portion of the study and 
consenting patients in the phase 2 portion of the study), the following administration 
routine will keep one lumen available for pharmacokinetic sampling and avoid the need 
for peripheral IV placement for pharmacokinetic sampling:  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      26  
--Use the same lumen for each of the irinotecan infusions on days 1- 4 (leaving 
one lumen unexposed to irinotecan);  
 
--Run normal saline in the irinotecan unexposed lumen at a rate of 20 mL/hour 
starting 5 minutes before the start of the irinotecan infusion and continuing until 5 
minutes after the completion of the irinotecan infusion;  
 
--Flush and heparinize the irinotecan lumen following institutional standard 
practice while normal saline is still running in the irinotecan unexposed lumen;  
 
--Flush with normal saline and heparinize the irinotecan unexposed lumen 
following institutional standard practice after the irinotecan lumen has already 
been flushed.  
 
Since pharmacokinetic sampling is only performed in cycle 1, this routine need only be 
used in cycle 1.   
 
4.2.4  Myeloid Growth Factor Support  (required in all patients in Part B)  
All patients in Part B (dose levels ending in “B” ; therefore all patients in the phase 2 
portion and the oral solution cohort ) receive myeloid growth factor starting on day 8 of the 
first cycle of therapy.  The recommended regimen is filgrastim 5 micrograms/kg 
subcutaneously starting at least 24 hours after the last dose of MLN8237 and continuing 
until the ANC exceeds 2,000/ µL post -nadir.  Filgrastim must be discontinued at least 24 
hours prior to the start of the next cycle of therapy.  A single dose of pegfil grastim (100 
micrograms/kg; maximum dose 6 mg) given subcutaneously on day 8 may be substituted 
for filgrastim according to institutional standard practice.  
 
4.2.5  Cephalosporin Diarrhea Prophylaxis  (required in all patients in Part B)  
All patients in Part  B (dose levels ending in “B” ; therefore all patients in the phase 2 
portion and the oral solution cohort ) receive cephalosporin diarrhea prophylaxis with 
starting with the first cycle of therapy.  The recommended regimen is cefixime 8 
mg/kg/dose (maximum daily dose 400 mg) given orally once daily starting on day -1 (2 
days before the start of irinotecan) and continuing until day +8 of each cycle.  An 
alternative regimen is cefpodoxime 10 mg/kg/day (maximum daily dose 800 mg) divided 
twice daily starting on  day -1 (2 days before the start of irinotecan) and continuing until 
day 8 of each cycle.  If neither cefixime nor cefpodoxime are available, then another oral 
third generation cephalosporin may be substituted using standard dosing for that agent .  
 
Patient s who appear to be on schedule to begin a subsequent cycle of therapy on time 
should resume cephalosporin diarrhea prophylaxis on Day 20 of the current cycle (two 
days prior to planned Day 1 of the subsequent cycle).   
 
4.3 Dose Escalation Schedule 
 
In the completed phase 1 portion, t he starting dose of MLN8237 was 45 mg/m2/day given orally 
once daily.  This dose represented approximately 60 % of the pediatric recommended phase 2 
dose of 80 mg/m2/day from COG protocol ADVL0812.   The dose escalation for the c ompleted 
phase I portion is g iven below

With Amendment 5, the phase 2 portion of the study is open to patients who are able to swallow 
intact pills.  All patients on the phase 2 portion will begin therapy at dose level 2B (60 mg/m2/day 
MLN8237) and will utilize the enteric coated tablet formulation.  
 
With Amendment 5, a cohort evaluating an MLN8237 oral solution is open to patients who are not 
able to swallow intact pills.  Based upon adult bioavailability data, evaluation of this oral solution 
cohort will begin at dose level 1B, with possible escalation to 2B or de- escalation to - 1B based on 
pharmacokinetic data on dose level 1B .  The dose will be assigned at study entry.   These 
patients  will be required to participate in pharmacokinetic testing.

4.4 Definition of Dose -Limiting Toxicity (DLT) 
 
Toxicity will be graded using the CTCAE criteria, version 4.0. The CTCAE provides descriptive 
terminology and a grading scale for each adverse event listed. A copy of the CTCAE can be 
downloaded from the CTEP home page (http://ctep.cancer.gov ). Any dose- limiting toxicity should 
be reported immediately through the NANT Operations Center to the Study Chair.  
 
Definition of Inevaluable for Dose Escalation Evaluation 
Patients who (1) receive < 5 of the 7 planned doses of MLN8237, < 4 of the 5 planned doses of 
irinotecan, or < 4 of the 5 planned doses of temozolomide in cycle 1 and (2) do not experience a 
DLT, will be replaced for the purposes of evaluating the dose level for dose escalation/de-
escalation purposes (see Secti on 10.2.1).  
 
Definition of Dose- Limiting Toxicity :  Note that the definition of DLT changed with Amendment 6.  
Once a site has IRB approval of Amendment 6, the DLT definition and therefore dose 
modification decisions in Amendment 6 will be used for assessment and management of any new 
toxicities for patients enrolling prior to Amendment 6 and who remain on protocol  therapy .  
 
DLT is defined as any of the following events that are possibly, probably or definitely attributable 
to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide:  
• Any grade 4 or 5 non- hematologic toxicity  
• Any grade 3 non- hematologic toxicity, w ith the exception of:  
--Grade 3 nausea,  vomiting,  anorexia or dehydration resolving to < = grade 2 within 72 
hours  
--Grade 3 transaminase elevation resolving to < grade 1 or baseline within 7 days of drug 
interruption/completion (if occurring on days 1- 7 acceptable to continue drug through day 
7 of course) or within 7 days  of first occurrence  if toxicity first occurs after drug 
completion.  In either case, treating sites are to obtain repeat labs by the seventh day to 
determine whether the event meets DLT criteria.   
--Grade 3 diarrhea persisting for less than 72 hours  
--Grade 3 fever, infection or febrile neutropenia  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      28 --Grade 3 electrolyte disturbance resolving to < grade 1 or baseline within 7 days of drug 
interruption/completion (if occurring on days 1- 7 acceptable to continue drug through day 
7 of course)  or within 7 days of first occurrence if toxicity first occurs after drug 
completion.  In either case, supplementation is allowed and treating sites are to obtain 
repeat labs by the seventh day to determi ne whether the event meets DLT criteria.   
• Start of next cycle of therapy later than day 36 due to non- hematologic toxicity  and/or not 
meeting criteria to start subsequent cycle  
• Dose- limiting neutropenia is defined as not meeting neutrophil criteria to st art a 
subsequent course by day 36.  
• Dose- limiting thrombocytopenia is defined as  not meeting platelet criteria to start a 
subsequent course by day 36.  
 
4.5 Treatment Duration  
Patients may receive up to 34 cycles of therapy (~2 years) on study in the absence of progressive 
disease. Decisions regarding additional therapy on this study will be made by the study chair and 
treating physician in collaboration with the vice chair and sponsor. Patients experiencing dose-
limiting toxicity (DLT) may continue to receive therapy modified as described in section 4.6.  
 
4.6 Dose Modification  
4.6.1  Thrombocytopenia  
Patients evaluable for hematologic toxicity who develop dose- limiting thrombocytopenia 
(per section 4.4) should have their dose of temozolomide reduced to 75 mg/m2 (see 
Appendix IIIB).   
Patients who continue to have dose- limiting thrombocytopenia despite temozolomide 
dose reduction should have a bone marrow evaluation to exclude progressive bone 
marrow metastatic disease.  In the absence of progressive bone marrow disease, these 
patients should have their dose of MLN8237 reduced by one dose level .  Patients already 
receiving dose level - 1B or an absolute dose of MLN8237 of 10 mg and who require dose 
reduction will be removed from protocol therapy.    
Patients with recurrent dose- limiting thrombocytopenia despite dose reductions in both 
MLN8237 and temozolomide will undergo up to one additional dose reduction of 
MLN8237 and temozolomide.  Temozolomide will be reduced first followed by MLN8237  
in the nex t cycle if the combination continues to result in dose limiting thrombocytopenia.  
The dose of temozolomide should be reduced to 50 mg/m2/dose, with dose rounded 
down to the nearest 5 mg.  The dose of MLN8237 should be reduced by an additional 
dose level .  Patients already receiving dose level - 1B or an absolute dose of MLN8237 of 
10 mg and who require dose reduction will be removed from protocol therapy .    
Patients with recurrent dose- limiting thrombocytopenia despite two dose reductions in 
both MLN8237 a nd temozolomide will be removed from protocol therapy.      
Patients  who are not evaluable for hematologic toxicity due to low counts and bone 
marrow involvement at study entry who develop dose limiting thrombocytopenia should 
undergo bone marrow re- evalua tion.  If the bone marrow does not show progressive 
disease, then the dose modification strategy above should be followed.  
 
4.6.2  Neutropenia  
Patients who have dose- limiting neutropenia despite myeloid growth factor support 
should have their dose of temozolomide reduced to 75 mg/m2 (see Appendix IIIB).  
These patients should continue to receive myeloid growth factor support.     
 
Patients who continue to have dose- limiting neutropenia despite myeloid growth factor 
support and temozolomide dose reduction are encouraged to undergo bone marrow 
evaluation to exclude progressive bone marrow metastatic disease.  In the absence of 
progressive bone marrow metastatic disease, these patients should have their dose of 
MLN8237 reduced by one dose level.  These patients should continue to receive myeloid 
growth factor support.  Patients already receiving dose level -1B or an absolute dose of 
MLN8237 of 10 mg and who require dose reduction will be removed from protocol 
therapy.   
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      29 Patients with recurrent dose- limiting neutropeni a despite myeloid growth factor support 
and dose reductions in both MLN8237 and temozolomide will undergo up to one 
additional dose reduction of MLN8237 and temozolomide in increments of 25% of the 
starting dose of each agent.  Temozolomide will be reduced first followed by MLN8237 in 
the next cycle if the combination continues to result in dose limiting neutropenia.  The 
dose of temozolomide should be reduced to 50 mg/m2/dose, with dose rounded down to 
the nearest 5 mg.  The dose of MLN8237 should be reduced by an additional dose level .  
Patients already receiving dose level -1B or an absolute dose of MLN8237 of 10 mg and 
who require dose reduction will be removed from protocol therapy .    
Patients with recurrent dose- limiting neutropenia despite myeloid growth factor support 
and two dose reductions in both MLN8237 and temozolomide will be removed from 
protocol therapy.      
Patients who are not evaluable for hematologic toxicity due to low counts and bone 
marrow involvement at study entry should undergo bone marrow re- evaluation if they 
develop dose- limiting neutropenia.  If the bone marrow does not show progressive 
disease, then the dose modification strategy above should be followed.   
4.6.3  Mucositis  
Patients who develop dose -limiting mucositis (per section 4.4) should have their dose of 
MLN8237 reduced by one dose level  with their next cycle of therapy.  Patients already 
receiving dose level - 1B or an absolute dose of MLN8237 of 10 mg and wh o require dose 
reduction will be removed from protocol therapy .    
Patients who continue to have dose- limiting mucositis despite initial MLN8237 dose 
reduction should have their dose of MLN8237 reduced by another dose level.  Patients 
already receiving dos e level - 1B or an absolute dose of MLN8237 of 10 mg and who 
require dose reduction will be removed from protocol therapy .    
If mucositis remains dose- limiting despite two MLN8237 dose reductions, temozolomide 
should be reduced to 75 mg/m2 (see Appendix II IB).  Patients with recurrent dose- limiting 
mucositis despite these dose reductions should be removed from protocol therapy.       
 
4.6.4  Diarrhea  
In addition to oral cephalosporin prophylaxis, other guidelines for patients with dose-
limiting diarrhea include consideration of the possibility of cholinergic syndrome if 
diarrhea occurs within hours of the irinotecan infusion. Patients wi th early diarrhea may 
benefit from pretreatment with atropine (0.01 mg/kg IV; max dose 0.4 mg), as well as  
prolonging the irinotec an infusion to 90 minutes.  Additional strategies for treating 
patients with therapy -associated diarrhea are given in section 5.5.   
Patients who continue to have dose- limiting diarrhea despite cephalosporin prophylaxis 
and other measures above should have the dose of irinotecan reduced by 25% to 37.5 
mg/m2/dose.  These patients should continue to receive the above supportive therapies 
with subsequent cycles.   
Patients with recurrent dose- limiting diarrhea despite supportive measures and irinotecan 
doe reduc tion should have the dose of irinotecan reduced by another 25% of the initial 
starting dose to 25 mg/m2/dose.       
If diarrhea remains dose- limiting despite two irinotecan dose reductions, MLN8237 
should be reduced by one dose level .  Patients already rec eiving dose level - 1B or an 
absolute dose of MLN8237 of 10 mg and who require dose reduction will be removed 
from protocol therapy .  Patients with recurrent dose- limiting diarrhea despite these dose 
reductions should be removed from protocol therapy.       
 
4.6.5  Mood alterations  
Patients who develop dose- limiting mood alteration while receiving MLN8237 should 
have the remainder of the MLN8237 for that cycle held.  These patients should have their 
dose of MLN8237 reduced one dose level  with their next cycle of therapy.  Patients 
already receiving dose level - 1B or an absolute dose of MLN8237 of 10 mg and who 
require dose reduction will be removed from protocol therapy .   
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      30 Patients with recurrent dose- limiting mood alteration despite initial MLN8237 dose 
reduction should have their dose of MLN8237 reduced by another dose level .  Patients 
already receiving dose level - 1B or an absolute dose of MLN8237 of 10 mg and who 
require dose reduction will be removed from protocol therapy .   
 
Patients with recurrent dose- limiting mood alteration despite these dose reductions will 
be removed from protocol therapy.   
 
4.6.6  Other toxicities  
Patients who develop other dose- limiting non -hematologic toxicities (per section 4.4) 
should have their dose of MLN8237 reduced by one dose level.  Patients already 
receiving dose level - 1B or an absolute dose of MLN8237 of 10 mg and who require dose 
reduction will be removed from protocol therapy .   
 
Patients with recurrent dose- limiting toxicity despite initial MLN8237 dose reduction 
should have their dose of MLN8237 reduced by another dose level.  Patients already 
receiving dose level - 1B or an absolute dose of MLN8237 of 10 mg and who require dose 
reduction will be removed from protocol therapy .   
 
Patients with recurrent dose- limiting toxicity despite these dose reductions will be 
removed from protocol therapy.   
 
4.7 Concomitant Therapy  
 
4.7.1  No other cancer chemotherapy or immunomodulating agents will be used.   
 
4.7.2  Palliative radiotherapy is not allowed on study.   
 
4.7.3  Appropriate antibiotics, blood products, anti -emetics, fluids, electrolytes and general 
supportive care are to be used as necessary (see Section 5.0).  
 
4.7.4  Patients may not receive cyclosporine, digoxin, tacrolimus, or sirolimus while on study.  
 
4.7.5  Use of as -needed benzodiazepines is allowed, though discouraged.  Caution should be 
taken with concomitant use of as -needed benzodiazepines with MLN8237.  Such patients 
may be at increased risk for mood alteration and sedation due to combined GABA -ergic 
effect s of both drugs.   
 
Use of scheduled benzodiazepines (defined as at least once daily on a chronic scheduled 
basis) is not allowed.   
 
4.7.6  Systemic antacids (both H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) may  
decrease MLN8237 exposure and should be avoided during MLN8237 treatment.  
Locally -acting antacids should not be taken simultaneously with MLN8237 but antacids  
can be given up to 2 hours prior or 2 hours following MLN8237 administration.  
 
4.7.7  Enzyme -inducing anti convulsants (phenobarbital, phenytoin, carbamazepine) must not  
be used as these may interfere with irinotecan metabolism. Non- enzyme inducing 
anticonvulsants (Keppra, etc.) can be used after discussion with study chair. The use of 
high dose dexamethasone and the use of aprepitant as antiemetics is not recommended 
due to effects on irinotecan metabolism  
 
 
  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      31 5.0 SUPPORTIVE CARE  
 
5.1 Prophylaxis for Pneumocystis Pneumonia  
 All patients should receive PCP prophylaxis according to institutional guidelines.  
 
5.2 Use of Myeloid Growth Factors  
Myeloid growth factor support is now required for all patients, as above.   
 
5.3 Antiemetics  
This combination may be emetogenic.  Patients should receive antiemetic(s) starting a 
minimum of 30 minutes prior to the first dose of oral chemotherapy on days 1- 7.  Use of 
benzodiazepines as a scheduled antiemetic is prohibited.  Use of benzodiazepines as an 
as needed antiemetic is discouraged.  The use of high dose dexamethasone and the use 
of aprepitant as antiemetics is not recommended due to effects on irinotecan metabolism.  
 
5.4 Treatment of Irinotecan -Associated Diarrhea  
Irinotecan- associated diarrhea can be profuse and can occur either early (minutes to 
hours) or late (days) in the treatment schedule. Early diarrhea results from cholinergic 
stimulation, while late diarrhea relates to bacterial processing of irinotecan metabolites.  
 
Early diarrhea: Patients who have the onset of diarrhea during the irinotecan infusion or 
in the hours following the completion of an irinotecan infusion sh ould receive atropine 
(suggested dose 0.01 mg/kg IV, maximum dose 0.4 mg). Early onset diarrhea is usually 
accompanied by cholinergic manifestations (diaphoresis and abdominal cramping). Since 
irinotecan is being administered on a prolonged schedule (daily  x 5), it may be difficult to 
distinguish early versus late diarrhea. If a patient with presumed early diarrhea does not 
improve with administration of atropine, they should be instructed to begin treatment for 
late diarrhea. Patients with suspected early diarrhea should also have the duration of 
subsequent Irinotecan infusions prolonged to 90 minutes.  
 
Late diarrhea (more than 24 hours after irinotecan administration): Patients will be given 
loperamide for late diarrhea based on body weight according to t he following chart. Each 
family will be instructed to have loperamide available and begin treatment at the first 
episode of poorly formed or loose stools or the earliest onset of bowel movements more 
frequent than normally expected for the patient. Families should be given the handout in 
Appendix  V. Patients will also be instructed to contact their physician if any diarrhea 
occurs.  
 
Maximum dose of loperamide per day: < 6 years: 4mg/day; 6- 11 years: 6mg/day; >11 years: 16 
mg/day, using the non silicone- containing product.  
Weight:  > 43 kg:  4 teaspoons or 2 caplets (4 mg) after the first loose bowel movement, 
followed by 2 teaspoons or 1 caplet (2mg) every2 hours. During the 
night the patient may take, 2 caplets (4mg) every 4 hours rather than1 
caplet (2mg) every 2 hours.  
Weight: 30kg –  43kg: 2 teaspoons or 1 caplet (2mg) after the first loose bowel movement 
followed by 1 teaspoon or one- half caplet (1 mg) every 2hours. During 
the night the patient may take, 1 caplet (2 mg) every 4 hours rather 
than one- half caplet every 2 hours.  
Weight: 20kg – < 30kg:  2 teaspoons or 1 caplet (2mg)after the first loose bowel movement 
followed by 1 teaspoon or one- half caplet (1mg) every 3 hours. During 
the night, the patient may take 1 caplet (2mg) every 4 hours rather 
than one- half caplet every3 hours.  
Weight: 13kg -  < 20kg:  1 teaspoon (1mg) after the first loose bowel movement followed by 1 
teaspoon (1mg) every 3 hours. During the night, the patient may take 
1 teaspoon (1 mg) every 4 hours rather than every 3 hours.  
Weight: < 13kg:  Half teaspoon (0.5mg) after the first loose bowel movement followed 
by half teaspoon every 3 hours. During the night, the patient may take 
half teaspoon (0.5mg) every 4 hours rather than every 3 hours.  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      32  
If there is failure of loperamide to control severe diarrhea after 24 hours of use, patients 
should be considered for treatment with octreotide (Sandostatin™) at the dose of 10 
micrograms/kg/dose subcutaneously every 12 hours x 3 days.  
 
Patients receiving prolonged exposure to antibiotic s (i.e., cefixime) who develop diarrhea 
should have stool samples evaluated for C difficile toxin, as this is a potentially treatable 
cause of diarrhea. If patients have fever with diarrhea, or bloody diarrhea, evaluation of 
stools for bacterial culture should also be performed.  
 
 
  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      33 6.0 DRUG INFORMATION 
 
6.1 MLN8237(MLN8237- 004) NSC # 747888  
 
Structure and molecular weight: MLN8237 chemical name is sodium 4- {[9-chloro- 7-(2-fluoro- 6-
methoxyphenyl) -5H-pyrimido[5,4- d][2]benzazepin- 2-yl]amino} -2-methoxybenzoate. It  is a  
reversible and selective small molecule inhibitor of the enzyme Aurora A kinase. The structure of 
MLN 8237- 004 is shown in the diagram below : 
 
 
 
Pharmacology:  Aurora A kinase plays a role in the regulation of chromosomal segregation 
during mitosis. Evidence to support that Aurora A kinase is a target for the treatment of 
malignancies comes from several observations. Aurora A kinase gene is amplified and/or 
overexpressed in many tumors. Over -expression of Aurora A kinase results in the transformation 
of normal cells, supporting the hypothesis that Aurora A is an oncogene. Published reports have 
demonstrated that in cultured tumor cells reduction of Aurora A protei n content results in mitotic 
spindle defects, mitotic delay, and apoptosis. Inhibition of Aurora A kinase has the potential to 
have a role in the progression of malignancies and MLN8237 has demonstrated activity against a 
broad range of in vitro and in viv o preclinical tumor models.  
 
The pharmacokinetic properties of MLN8237 were characterized in animal models and in vitro 
studies. Based on these preclinical evaluations, MLN8237 is expected to have low systemic 
clearance, a moderate volume of distribution at steady state, high plasma protein binding, and 
good oral bioavailability in humans.  Due to potential for alteration of  absorption by agents that 
modify gastric pH, proton pump inhibitors and antacids may influence the drug absorption. . 
MLN8237 is metabolized by both glucuronidation and oxidation pathways. It is not a mechanism -
based inhibitor of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4/5M and is unlikely to inhibit the five major CYP 
enzymes, 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, and 3A4/5, when administered at the projected human 
efficacious dose. Therefore, it is unlikely that MLN8237 will cause drug- drug interactions (DDIs) 
via inhibition of CYP -mediated metabolism. MLN8237 is a P -glycoprotein (P -gp) inhibitor. 
Potential DDIs may occur when MLN8237 is co- administered with a P -gp substrate. Urinary 
excretion of MLN8237 was negligible in the rat and chimpanzee (<1% of the dose).  
 
Preliminary pharmacokinetic analysis of human studies showed that in the 5- 150 mg once daily 
dose range, there is a dose- dependent increase in the area under  the plasma concentration 
versus time curve from zero to 24 hours (AUC0- 24hr) and the maximum plasma concentration 
(Cmax). Peak drug concentrations were generally achieved by 1 to 4 hours. The terminal half -life 
(t1/2) was between 30 and 40 hours for doses  of 5 to 80 mg and was somewhat shorter (between 
10 and 30 hours) at the higher doses of 110 and 150 mg. Comparison between 7 -day and 14- day 
administration suggested that steady -state was achieved following 7 days of dosing with lack of 
additional accumulation beyond Day 7. Preliminary results from pharmacokinetics studies of once 
and twice daily drug administration  showed moderate rate of absorption with a median Tmax of 2 
hours (range 1 to 6 hours) and an overall mean half -life of about 18 hours. Twice daily dosing 
reduces the peak -to-trough ratio compared to once daily administration and is associated with 
decreased incidence of somnolence.  
 
Toxicities:  Information on MLN8237 toxicity is based on the Investigator’s Brochure (Edition 9). 

   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      34  
Inhibition of Aurora A kinase is expected to be toxic to proliferating tissues because of the role 
that this enzyme plays in mitosis. In preclinical experiments in rats and dogs, MLN8237 caused 
reversible myelosuppression and reversible injury to the gastr ointestinal epithelium.  
 
Some of the adverse events that have been observed with MLN8237 include the following:  
Reversible myelosuppression including leukopenia, neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, 
lymphopenia; thrombocytopenia; anemia; gastrointestinal tox icity including stomatitis/mucositis, 
oral pain, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, abdominal pain, heartburn, diarrhea, and dehydration; 
somnolence, confusion and disorientation and associated memory loss and gait disturbances; 
dependency; withdrawal symptoms; m ood alteration; palmer -planter erythrodysesthesia; 
abnormal liver function tests (including AST, ALT,  bilirubin, ALP, and GGT); alopecia; fatigue; 
infection; sepsis; and fever.  
 
MLN8237 is structurally related to benzodiazepines and has activity against the GABAAα1 
receptor. Therefore there is a theoretical risk that MLN8237 could cause dependency and 
withdrawal symptoms. Mood changes, such as euphoria or depression, are possible.  When 
stopping the drug, withdrawal symptoms could include: anxiety, restless ness, difficulty sleeping, 
tremors, rapid heart -beat, nausea and vomiting.  
 
The use of benzodiazepines or alcohol should be limited or avoided and subjects should be 
instructed to avoid potentially hazardous activities that require full alertness  and coordination. 
Concomitant use of opiates should be done with caution.  Flumazenil, the selective 
benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, may be used as an adjunct to, but not as a substitute, for the 
management of life threatening sedation associated with MLN8237. In studies in adult patients, 
the central nervous system adverse effect of somnolence appeared to be related to peak 
concentrations of MLN8237 and was alleviated when dosing was changed from once to twice 
daily dosing.  
 
This list of potential adverse event s is most likely not comprehensive; it is possible that  the drug 
will have other toxicities that have not been observed or predicted from its  evaluation in animals 
or humans to date.

Note: MLN8237 in combination with other agents could cause an exacerbation of any 
adverse event currently known to be caused by the other agent, or the combination may 
result in events never previously associated with either agent.  
 
Formulation and Stabili ty: MLN8237 is available as two different formulations.  
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      36 The phase 1 and 2 portions of the study utilize a 10 mg enteric coated tablet. In addition to the 
active drug, the tablets also contain sodium bicarbonate, sodium lauryl sulfate, povidone, 
microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and sodium stearyl fumarate. The tablets are 
packaged in  high- density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with a child resistant cap. Each bottle 
contains 10tablets. Tablets should remain in the provided bottle until dispensing. The exact 
number of  tablets per cycle can be counted and dispensed in prescription HDPE bottles. The 
tablets are stored at controlled room temperature of 20°- 25°C ( 68°-77°F) with excursions 
permitted from 15 °-30°C (59°-86°F ). 
 
The oral solution cohort utilizes a 5 mg/mL oral solution.  In addition to the active drug, the 
solution also contains sodium bi carbonate, polyethylene glycol 400, propylene glycol, glycerol, 
acesulfame potassium, bubble gum flavor, and purified water.  The solution is provided in 60 mL 
amber polyethylene terephthalate bottles  with a child resistant cap.  The solution should remain in 
the provided bottle until ready for dispensing in the clinic or at home.  The investigational 
pharmacist may draw u p a patient’s dose on the day a patient receives therapy at the study 
center , but should not draw -up the full  7-day course of therapy into prefilled syringes and 
dispense t hat supply t o the patient.  Instead, parents/guardians will be instructed to draw up each 
dose at home prior to administration.  The bottles are to be stored at controlled room temperature 
of 20°- 25°C ( 68°-77°F) with e xcursions permitted from 15° -30°C (59°-86°F ).  Patients are to start 
each cycle of therapy with a new supply of bottles, rather than using any remaining solution from 
previous cycles.    
 
Guidelines for Administration:  See also Treatment and Dose Modificat ion in Section 4.0.    
 
MLN8237 is a cytotoxic anticancer drug and should be handled according to published guidelines 
for handling cytotoxic drugs.  Tablets should not be crushed or manipulated in any way.  
 
The oral solution formulation of the drug must  be given on an empty st omach, at least one hour 
before and  two hours after food or drink except water.   
 
The tablet  must be swallowed whole, but may be given with or without food.  
 
Systemic antacids (both H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors) may decrease 
MLN8237 exposure and should be avoided during MLN8237 treatment. Locally -acting antacids 
should not be taken simultaneously with MLN8237 but antacids can be given up to 2 hours prior 
or 2 hours following MLN8237 administration.  
 
Antiemetics may be administered as needed; however, the use of benzodiazepines for the 
prophylaxis or treatment of nausea or vomiting is discouraged because of the potential 
benzodiazepine- like effects of MLN8237.  
 
In case of contact with the powder  or solut ion (e.g., from a broken tablet), skin should be washed  
immediately with soap and copious amounts of water for at least 15 minutes. In case of contact 
with the eyes, copious amounts of water should be  used to flush the eyes for at least 15 minutes 
and pati ents should be instructed to notify medical personnel.  
 
Drug Supply and Accountability:  MLN8237 will be supplied by Millennium.  MLN8237 will be 
shipped to treating directly from Millennium to treating NANT institutions. Instructions and forms 
for ordering MLN8237 from Millenn ium are posted to the NANT website.  
 
Accountability for MLN8237 at the trial site is the responsibility of the investigator .  The 
investigator will ensure that the study drug is used only in accordance with this  protocol.  Where 
allowed, the investigator may choose to assign some of the drug accountability responsibilit ies to 
a pharmacist or other appropriate individual. Drug  accountability records indicating the drug’s 
delivery date to the site, inventory at the site, use by each patient, and amount returned to 
Millennium  (or disposal of the drug, if approved by Millennium) will be maintained by the clinical 
site. These records will adequately document that the patients were provided the doses as 
specified in the protocol and should reconcile all study drug received from Millennium.  
Accountability records will include dates, quantities, batch/serial numbers, expiration dates (if 
applicable), and patient numbers. All unused, unopened, or expired MLN8237 can be returned to 
Millennium  or destroyed per local institutional policy upon confirmation that the last patient 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      37 enroll ed into the study has completed the treatment period. If a site is unable to destroy their 
remaining supply of study drug, they may using the “Return Drug for Destruction Form” found in 
the N2009- 03 study specific page of the NANT Website.  If a site possesses drug destruction 
capabilities then all study drug is to be destroyed by the site according to the site’s drug 
destruction policy. The site will maintain detailed records of the drug reconciliation and 
destruction with the study files. Documentation of  the site’s drug destruction policy may be 
requested by Millennium Pharmaceuticals (or designee) at any time during the course of this 
study. All material containing study drug will be treated as hazardous waste in accordance with  
governing regulations.  
 
 
6.2  IRINOTECAN (CPT-11, Camptosar ™), NSC #616348  
 
Mechanism of Action : Irinotecan is a semisynthetic water -soluble analog of camptothecin that 
exerts its cytotoxic effect through inhibition of the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase I. Irinotecan is a 
prodrug that undergoes deesterification to a much more potent topoisomerase- I inhibitor, SN -38. 
The lactone forms of both irinotecan and SN -38, unde rgo pH dependent hydrolysis to a hydroxy 
acid (carboxylate) species. SN -38 is glucuronidated to SN -38G.  
 
Formulation & Stability : Each ml of irinotecan contains 20 mg irinotecan (on basis of the 
trihydrate salt) ; 45 mg sorbitol ; and 0.9 mg lactic acid. When necessary, pH has been adjusted 
to 3.5 (range, 3.0 to 3.8) with sodium hydroxide or hydrochloric acid. Irinotecan is supplied in 
amber, glass, single- dose vials containing 40 mg (2ml) and 100 mg (5ml) of irinotecan 
hydrochloride (on the basis of trihy drate salt) as a 20 mg/mL solution. The intact vials should be 
stored at room temperature and protected from light. It is recommended that the vial (and 
backing/plastic blister) should remain in the carton until the time of use.  
 
Guidelines for Administra tion: Irinotecan must be diluted before infusion.  Irinotecan should be 
diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection USP (preferred) or 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, to a 
final concentration range of 0.12 to 2.8 mg/mL.  The solution is physically and chemically  stable 
for up to 24 hours at room temperature (approx 25ΟC) and in ambient fluorescent lighting.  
Solutions diluted in 5% Dextrose Injection, USP, and stored at refrigerated temperatures 
(approximately 2Ο to  8ΟC), and protected from light are physically and chemically stable for 48 
hours.  Refrigeration of admixtures using 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, is not 
recommended due to a low and sporadic incidence of visible particulates. Care should be taken 
to avoid extravasation; the use of a central li ne is suggested.   
 
Irinotecan should be administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes.

6.3  TEMOZOLOMIDE (TEMODARTM) NSC #362856  
 
Pharmacology:  An orally administered alkylating agent, a second generation i madazotetrazine. 
A prodrug of MTIC, temozolomide spontaneously decomposes to MTIC at physiologic pH. The 
drug exerts its effect by cross -linking DNA. This is likely a site specific alkylation at the O6 -
position of guanine with some effect at the N7 positio n. Temozolomide reaches its peak 
concentration in 1 hour. Food reduces the rate and extent of absorption. It has an elimination half -
life of 1.13hr (intraperitoneally) and 1.29hr (orally) with an oral bioavailability of 0.98. Total 
apparent body clearance is 100ml/min/m2 and plasma elimination half -life is ~100 minutes.

Formulation and Stability: 5mg, 20mg, 100mg, 140mg, 180mg, and 250mg capsules, stored at 
room temperature.  
 
Guidelines for Administration: See also Treatment and Dose Modifications in Section 4.0.   
 
There is a potential for medication errors involving temozolomide capsules resulting in drug 
overdosages,  which may have been caused by dispensing/taking the wrong number of capsules 
per day and/or product usage exceeding the prescribed dosing schedule.  
 
Temozolomide capsules are available in six different strengths, each color -coded according to 
strength. Capsules  are available in 5- count and 14- count packages , except the 250 mg capsule 
strength, which is only available in a 5- count package.  
Capsule Strength      COLOR  
5 mg        Green Cap  
20 mg        Yellow Cap  
100 mg       Pink Cap  
140 mg       Blue Cap 
180 mg       Orange Cap  
250 mg       White Cap 
 
When dispensing, it is extremely important that prescribing and dispensing include clear 
instructions on which capsules, and how many of each capsule(s) are to be taken per day. Only 
dispense what is needed for the course, and clearly indicate how many days of dosing the patient 
will have and how many days are without temozolomide dosing. When counseling patients, it is 
important for each patient / parent to understand the number of capsules per day and the number 
of days that they take temozolomide. It is also important for the patient/parent to understand the 
number of days that they will be off the medication  
 
Each type of temozolomide capsule must be dispensed in a separate vial or in its original glass 
bottle. Based on the dose prescribed, determine the number of each strength of temozolomide 
capsules needed for the full course. For example, 275 mg/day for 5 days would be dispensed as 
five 250- mg capsules,  five 20 -mg capsules, and five 5- mg capsules. Label each container with 
the appropriate number of capsules to be taken each day. Dispense to the patient/parent, making 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      40 sure each container lists the strength (mg) per capsule and that he or she understands t o take the 
appropriate number of capsules of temozolomide from each bottle or vial to equal the total daily 
dose prescribed by the physician.  
 
For children unable to swallow the capsules whole, the oral capsules may be formulated into a 
suspension. To prepare a 10 mg/mL suspension  titrate the contents of ten 100 mg capsules 
(1000 mg) , 500 mg povidone K -30 and 25 mg anhydrous citric acid dissolved in 1.5 mL purified 
water in a glass mortar to form a uniform paste. To the paste add 50 mL of Ora- Plus ® by ad ding 
a small amount, mixing and then adding the balance. Transfer to a glass graduated cylinder Add 
Ora-Sweet® or Ora- Sweet® SF to a total volume of 100mL by rinsing the mortar with small 
amounts of the syrup (Ora- Sweet® or Ora- Sweet® SF). Rinse at least f our times. Package in an 
amber plastic prescription bottle. The packaged suspension is stable for 7 days at room 
temperature or 60 days in the refrigerator. The suspension should be shaken well before each 
use. Procedures for proper handling and disposal of cytotoxic drugs should be used when 
preparing the suspension. (Trissel LA, Yanping Z, Koontz SE. Temozolomide stability in 
extemporaneously compounded oral suspensions. Int J Pharm Compounding 10:396- 9, 2006 ). 
 
Alternatively, the capsules can be opened and mixed with apple sauce or juice.

6.4 GRANULOCYTE COLONY STIMULATING FACTOR(G -CSF)  
(Neulasta,Pegylated filgrastim Or Neupogen, Filgrastim).  
 
6.4.1 NEULASTA (PEGFILGRASTIM) : 
 
Source and Pharmacology:  
Pegfilgrastim is the pegylated form of recombinant methionyl human G -CSF (filgrastim). 
Pegfilgrastim is produced by covalently binding a 20- kilodalton (kD) monomethoxypolyethylene 
glycol molecule to the N -terminal  methionyl residue of filgrastim. The molecular weight of 
pegfilgrastim is 39 kD. G -CSF is a lineage specific colony -stimulating factor which regulates the 
production of neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor proliferation, 
differentiation, and selected end- cell functional activation (including enhanced phagocytic ability , 
priming of the cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst, antibody dependent killing, 
and the increased expression of some functions associated w ith cell surface antigens). After 
subcutaneous injection the elimination half -life of pegfilgrastim ranges from 15 to 80 hours and 
the time to peak concentration ranges from 24 to 72 hours. Serum levels are sustained in most 
patients during the neutropenic period postchemotherapy, and begin to decline after the start of 
neutrophil recovery, consistent with neutrophil -dependent elimination. After subcutaneous 
administration at 100 mcg/kg in 37 pediatric patients with sarcoma, the terminal elimination half -
life was 30.1 (+/ - 38.2) hours in patients 0 to 5 years -old, 20.2 (+/ - 11.3) hours in patients 6 to 11 
years -old, and 21.2 (+/ - 16) hours in children 12 to 21 years -old.

Unknown frequency and timing :  Fetal toxicities and teratogenic effects of pegfilgrastim in 
humans are unknown. Conflicting data exist in animal studies. It is unknown whether the drug is 
excreted in breast milk.  
 
Supplier:  Commercially available. See package insert for further information.  
 
Formulation and Stability: 
Supplied as a preservative -free solution containing 6 mg (0.6 mL) of pegfilgrastim (10 mg/mL) in 
a single- dosesyringe with 27 g, ½ inch needle with an UltraSafe® Needle Guard. The needle 
cover of the prefilled syringe contains drug natural rubber (a derivative of latex). Store refrigerated 
at 2º-8ºC(36º -46ºF) and in the carton to protect from light. Prior to injection, pegfilgrastim may be 
allowed to reach room temperature protected from light for a maximum of 48 hours. Avoid 
freezing.  
 
Guidelines for Administration : See Treatment and Dose Modifications sections of the protocol  
 
6.4.2  NEUPOGEN  (FILGRASTIM):  
 
Source and Pharmacology: Filgrastim is a human granulocyte colony -stimulating factor (G -
CSF), produced by recombinant DNA technology.  Filgrastim is a 175 amino acid protein with a 
molecular weight of 18,800 daltons manufactured by recombinant DNA technology utilizing E.coli 
bacteria into which has been inserted the human granulocyte colony stimulating factor gene.  It 
differs from the natural specific colony -stimulating factor which regulates the production of 
neutrophils within the bone marrow and affects neutrophil progenitor pr oliferation, differentiation, 
and selected end- cell functional activation (including enhanced phagocytic ability, priming of the 
cellular metabolism associated with respiratory burst, antibody dependent killing, and the 
increased expression of some functions associated with cell surface antigens).  The elimination 
half-life is similar for subcutaneous and intravenous administration, approximately 3.5 hours.  The 
time to peak concentration when administered subcutaneously is 2 to 8 hours.  
Formulation and Sta bility:  
Supplied as a clear solution in 300 ug/ml (1 ± 0.6 x 108 U/mg) (1 ml or 1.6 ml) vials. Vials are 
preservative free and are intended to be single- use vials; do not reuse opened vials. Filgrastim 
must be stored between 2° and 8°C. Stability has been demonstrated for at least 24 months 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      42 when stored under these conditions. Do not use if discolored or if there is particulate matter. For 
IV use, dilute in D5W to concentrations > 15 ug/ml; G -CSF is incompatible with normal saline. At 
dilutions from 5 ug/ml  to 14 ug/ml, add human serum albumin to a final albumin concentration of 2 
mg/ml to protect against absorption of the GCSF to container walls (glass or plastic). Filgrastim, 
when diluted as described above, is compatible with a number of plastics commonly  used in the 
manufacture of syringes, IV bags, infusion sets, and IV pump cassettes. These include polyvinyl 
chloride, polyolefin, and polypropylene. Diluted filgrastim should be stored at 2° to 8° C and used 
within 24 hours. Do not shake or freeze.  
 
Guide lines for Administration:  
Administer once daily, subcutaneously without dilution or if necessary dilute with 5% dextrose in 
water, preferably to concentrations of 15 ug/ml or greater for IV administration. Dilutions should 
be prepared as close to the time of administration as possible (up to 24 hours), since the product 
is preservative- free. When diluting Filgrastim to 5-14 ug/ml in D5W, it is necessary at all times to 
add human serum albumin, to reach a final albumin concentration of 2 mg/ml.

1. More frequent CBCs may be needed as part of good patient care.   
2. Obtain for females 10 years of age and older or post -pubertal.  
3. Tumor imaging = CT  and/or MRI  for optimum visualization of all areas of bulk tumor (primary & metastasis). All disease status tests must be 
performed < 4 weeks prior to study entry and subsequent to any intervening therapy . 
4. Required for verification of eligibili ty.  All results should be faxed to NANT Operations Center with study registration eligibility. An eligibility 
worksheet is available in the data forms packet on NANT website ( www.nant.org ). 
5. Patients with bone marrow disease present at study entry should have a diagnostic bone marrow sent with each disease evaluation.  All 
disease status tests must be performed <  4 weeks prior to study entry and subsequent to any intervening therapy .  To confirm a bone 
marrow response of CR, an additional bone marrow examination for morphology (for a total of 2 bone marrow exams) must be done a 
minimum of three weeks apart (section 11.2.1).  
6. 123I-MIBG scans are preferred.  Omit for patients known to be MIBG non- avid and replace with 18FDG -PET (preferred) or bone scan.  All 
disease status tests must be performed <  4 weeks prior to study entry and subsequent to any intervening therapy . 
7. Perform disease re- staging after day 14 of cycles 2, 4, 8, and then every 4 cycles thereafter.   
8. All observations timed for the start of a cycle are to be obtained prior to the start of Day 1 therapy (and do not necessarily need to be 
obtained prior to resuming oral cephalosporin on Day - 1; if studies obtained between Day - 2 and Day 0 and meet criteria to proceed with 
subsequent cycle, do not need to be repeated on Day 1).  
9. If plasma lactate elevated above baseline draw on Day Four draw, obtain a venous blood gas to determine if pH < 7.3 (= grade 3 acidosis in 
CTCAE version 4 and therefore a potential dose- limiting toxicity).  
10.  If patient is co-enrolled on NANT 2004- 05, please also submit specimens for biology study for these timepoints.     
 
 
 
  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      47 7.2 Recommended Follow -Up Observations  
 
The following are recommendations only, but may be altered at discretion of treating physician.  
Repeat the following if abnormal on a monthly basis until stable or normalized after the end of 
therapy. If normal at the end of therapy then repeat only as cl inically indicated:  
• History, physical exam (Ht, Wt,  VS)  
• CBC/Differential, Platelets, AST, ALT, Bilirubin, BUN, Creatinine  
 
Patients will be followed for life for any delayed toxicities related to protocol therapy and for the 
development of second malignancies.  
 
After completion of protocol therapy, the disease status, sites of relapse, and last alive date will 
be recorded until first relapse/progression or until patient receives another non- protocol therapy, 
after which only last alive date will be repor ted, as well as date of death and cause of death (if 
applicable).  
 
7.3 Documentation of Tumor Response  
 
Disease evaluation will take place after day 14 of cycles 2, 4, 8, and then every 4cycles.  
It is recommended that all scans and tests previously done to document disease status be 
performed in subsequent evaluations of disease status.  
 
Patients with bone marrow disease present at study entry should have a diagnostic bone marrow 
done with each disease evaluation. To confirm a bone marrow response of CR, an additional 
bone marrow examination for morphology (for a total of 2 bone marrow exams) must be done 
separated by a minimum of three weeks (section 11.2.1).  
 
Once a patient receives therapy other than prescribed on this protocol, no further scans or bone 
marrow evaluations will be required for this protocol since the patient will no longer be evaluable 
for response to MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.  
 
  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      48 8.0 PHARMACOKINETIC AND BIOLOGY STUDIES  
 
Collection of plasma samples for MLN8237 and irinotecan, pharmacokinetic studies is required 
during cycle 1 for all patients in the phase 1 portion (completed) and in the oral solution portion  of 
the study.  Pharmacokinetic sampling is optional during cycle 1 for patients in the phase 2 portion of 
the study.   
 
Collection of other samples for correlative biology studies is optional and not required for study 
entry. Although these studies cannot be mandated, all institutions are strongly urged to submit 
specimens for all consenting patients.  
 
Please see Appendix VI for a summary of blood draws for correlative studies. For patients with a 
weight below the minimum required to tolerate all blood draws requested for correlative studies, 
please consult with study chair to determine prioritization of samples.   
 
8.1  MLN8237 Pharmacokinetics  
 
Please note that these instructions apply to MLN8237 pharmacokinetics.  Samples for irinotecan 
pharmacokinetics require additional volume and different sample processing (see section 8.2).  
 
8.1.1  Sample requirements  
3 mL of blood should be drawn into a 4 mL EDTA purple top tube at each time point.  
Since MLN8237 is given orally, samples may be drawn via central venous catheter, if 
applicable.    
 
8.1.2  Sampling schedule  
Sampling will take place only during cycle 1 of therapy.  Sample timing is based on the 
timing of MLN8237 dosing, with the time of MLN8237 oral administration on Day 4 
considered hour 0.  Samples should be obtained at the following time points:  
 
--Day 1, prior to first dose of MLN8237  
--Day 4, prior to MLN8237  
--Day 4, hour 0.5 (i.e., 30 minutes after Day 4 dose of MLN8237)  
--Day 4, hour 1 (i.e., 1 hour after Day 4 dose of MLN8237)  
--Day 4, hour 2 (i.e., 2 hours after Day 4 dose of MLN8237 and at the end of Day 4 
irinotecan infusion)  
--Day 4, hour 3 (i.e., 3 hours after Day 4 dose of MLN8237)  
--Day 4, hour 4 (i.e., 4 hours after Day 4 dose of MLN8237)  
--Day 4, hour 7 (i.e., 7 hours after Day 4 dose of MLN8237)  
--Day 5, prior to Day 5 dose of MLN8237 (approximately 24 hours after Day 4 dose of 
MLN8237 and 22 hours after completion of Day 4 irinotecan infusion)  
 
In order to accommodate this sampling schedule, patients will need to be reminded to not 
take Day 4 and Day 5 doses of MLN8237 until instructed to do so once they have arrived 
at the treating site.  
 
For patients with double lumen catheters following the procedure for keeping one lumen 
unexposed from irinotecan (section 4.2.3), the Day 4, hour 2 samples should be drawn 
from the irinotecan- unexposed lumen after completion of the normal saline flush that is to 
run for an additional 5 minutes after completion of the irinotecan infusion.  
 
8.1.3  Sample processing  
At the time of collection, EDTA tubes should be gently inverted 6- 8 times.  Next, 
centrifuge the samples in a refrigerated centrifuge (4°C)  for 10 minutes at 1500 g  or 
greater.  Next, remove the plasma using a transfer pipette and transfer the plasma into 
two separate 3.5 mL polypropylene tubes.  Next, immediately freeze the tubes at - 80˚ C.   
 
If samples cannot be centrifuged immediately after sample collection, the tubes may be 
placed in an ice bath for up to 48 hours before further processing.   
 
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      49 8.1.4  Sample labeling  
Polypropylene tubes should be labeled with the patient’s NANT ID number, the word 
“MLN”, the protocol number NANT0903, the date of blood draw, and exact time of the 
blood draw.   
 
No other identifiers should be included on the label.  
 
8.1.5  Sample shipment  
Samples will be held until all samples have been obtained and then sent as a single 
batch.  Batched samples should be sent frozen on dry ice by FedEx priority overnight to:

shipment.   
 
8.1.6  Methodology   
MLN8237 plasma levels will be measured using a validated HPLC MS/MS assay. [23]  
 
 
8.2 Irinotecan Pharmacokinetics  
 
Please note that these instructions apply to irinotecan pharmacokinetics.  Samples for MLN8237 
pharmacokinetics require a dditional volume and different sample processing (see section 8.1).  
 
8.2.1  Sample requirements  
2 mL of blood should be drawn into a sodium heparin green top tube at each time point.   
 
The baseline pre- treatment sample drawn on Day 1 can be obtained through a central 
venous catheter.  Since irinotecan is given intravenously, the Day 4 and 5 samples 
should not be drawn through a central venous catheter lumen through which irinotecan 
has been infused on days 1 -4.   
 
Patients with double- lumen central venous catheters may have irinotecan 
pharmacokinetic samples drawn on days 4 and 5 through a lumen that has not been 
used for irinotecan infusion on days 1- 4 as long as the routine detailed in section 4.2. 3 
has been used during each of those irinotecan infusions.  For patients with double- lumen 
central venous catheters using the irinotecan unexposed lumen for pharmacokinetic 
blood draws, the institutional standard volume of “waste” blood before collecting clinical 
laboratory specimens should be “wasted” before drawing each pharmacokinetic sample.   
 
8.2.2  Sampling schedule  
Sampling will take place only during cycle 1 of therapy.  Sample timing is based on the 
timing of MLN8237 dosing, with the time of MLN8237 oral administration on Day 4 
considered hour 0.  Samples should be obtained at the following time points:  
 
--Day 1, prior to first dose of MLN8237  
--Day 4, prior to MLN8237  
--Day 4, hour 2 (i.e., 2 hours  after Day 4 dose of MLN8237 and at the end of Day 4 
irinotecan infusion)  
--Day 4, hour 3 (i.e., 1 hour after completing Day 4 irinotecan infusion)  
--Day 4, hour 4 (i.e., 2 hours after completing Day 4 irinotecan infusion)  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      50 --Day 4, hour 7 (i.e., 5 hours after completing Day 4 irinotecan i nfusion)  
--Day 5, prior to Day 5 dose of MLN8237 (approximately 24 hours after Day 4 dose of 
MLN8237 and 22 hours after completion of Day 4 irinotecan infusion)  
 
For patients with double lumen catheters following the procedure for keeping one lumen 
unexpos ed from irinotecan (section 4.2.3), the Day 4, hour 2 samples should be drawn 
from the irinotecan- unexposed lumen after completion of the normal saline flush that is to 
run for an additional 5 minutes after completion of the irinotecan infusion.  
 
8.2.3  Sample pr ocessing  
Blood collected into sodium heparin tubes should be gently mixed by immediately 
inverting the tubes.  Blood samples will then be centrifuged immediately for 15 minutes in 
a refrigerated (4° C) centrifuge set at 3000 rpm.  Next, remove the plasma using a 
transfer pipette and transfer the plasma into two separate 3.5 mL polypropylene tubes.  
Next, immediately freeze the tubes at -80˚ C and store until delivery to the Mayo Clinic 
(See section 8.2.5 for shipping instructions).  
 
8.2.4  Sample labeling

NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      53 10.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
10.1 Sample Size and Study Duration  
 
Design of the Completed Phase I Portion:  Two to six evaluable patients will be entered at each 
dose level for determination of the maximum tolerated dose. The minimum sample size required 
to identify the MTD is 15 patients. The maximum sample size for the phase 1 portion, assuming 
all 4-dose levels plus the initial dose level 1 require 6 patients before the MTD is determined, is 
30 patients.  This estimate assumes that all patients are fully evaluable.  Review of the enrollment 
rate onto recent non- MIBG NANT studies indicates that 1- 2 patients per month are available for 
the phase I portion of the study.  For example, NANT protocols N01- 03 (CEP -701), N03- 01 (oral 
irinotecan and temozolomide), and N04- 04 (oral fenretinide) have each enrolled approximately 8 
patients per year, not accounting for closure time due to protocol amendments and drug supply 
issues.  These patient numbers predicted identification of the MTD within approximately 1 2-18 
months .  (The phase 1 portion required 22 patients and 18 months to complete. )    
 
Phase 2 Portion:  The phase 2 portion of the study  will enroll 14-20 new patients based on the 
two-stage design.  Review of enrollment to date to the phase 2 portion indicates that 2 patients 
with neuroblastoma per month are available for this portion of the study.   We ant icipate that the 
phase 2 portion of the study will be completed within 12 months.   
 
The oral solution cohort will enroll 6- 18 patients , though only patients unable to swallow pills will 
enroll to this cohort.  We expect 1 patient per month will be available , allowing c ompletion of this 
cohort in 6- 18 months.   
 
10.2 Definitions  
 
10.2.1  Evaluable for Inclusion in Dose Escalation Consideration  
Patients will be evaluable for inclusion in dose escalation consideration if they have received > 5 
of the 7 planned doses of MLN8237, > 4 of the 5 planned doses of irinotecan, and > 4 of the 5 
planned doses of temozolomide in cycle 1 AND are followed until Day 21 of the first cycle of 
therapy.  In addition, patients who experience DLT at any time after the first dose of MLN8237 are 
evaluable for inclusion in dose escalation consideration.  Toxicity will be assessed and reported 
on all patients who begin MLN8237 therapy.  
 
Patients who do not receive at least 5 doses of MLN8237, at least 4 doses of irinotecan, or at 
least 4 doses of temozolomide (for any reason other than toxicity or tolerability of the regimen) 
and who do not experience dose limiting toxicity, will not be counted as successfully completing 
one course of treatment without toxicity and will be replaced.   
 
10.2.2  Evaluable for Response  
Eligible patients with measurable or evaluable disease who receive > 5 of the 7 planned doses of 
MLN8237, > 4 of the 5 planned doses of irinotecan, and > 4 of the 5 planned doses of 
temozolomide  in cycle 1 are evaluable for response.  Eligible patients with measurable or evaluable 
disease who fail to complete one course of therapy because of disease progression are also 
evaluable for response.  Response will be described for all patients entered on study.  
 
All patients who are registered onto the study must be assessed for response to treatment, even if 
there are major protocol treatment deviations or if they are ineligible or not evaluable . Each patient 
will be assigned one of the following categ ories (see Section 11.4):  
 
a. Complete response  
b. Very good partial response  
c. Partial response  
d. Stable disease 
e.  Mixed response  
f. Progressive disease  
g.    Early death from malignant disease  
h     Early death from toxicity  
i.     Early death because of other cause  
j.     In -evaluable (not assessable, insufficient data, patients off therapy early due to toxicity)  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      54 k.    Never received any of the study drugs, MLN8237, irinotecan, or temozolomide  
 
All eligible patients who receive study therapy will be included in the initial analysis of response. 
Patients in groups a through c will be classified as responders; patients in groups d through j will be 
classified as non- responders.  In a second analysis, the proportion of responders (patients in 
groups a through c) will be calculated from the subset of patients who are evaluable for response 
(as defined above).  
 
10.2.3  Maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  
The MTD is the highest dose level tested at which 0/6 or 1/6 patients experience DLT (that is 
possibly, probably, or definit ely related to the study drug(s) as defined in Section 4.4) with at least 
2/3 or 2/6 patients encountering DLT at the next higher dose.  If 0/6 or 1/6 patients experience DLT 
at the highest dose level (dose level 3), then that dose level will be called the MTD.  
 
 
10.3 Dose Escalation Rules for the Phase 1 and Oral Solution Cohort Portion s of Study  
The primary endpoint for the phase 1  and oral solution cohort portions  of this study will be toxicity 
that is attributable to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide during the first 
cycle of therapy.  Toxicity as graded by CTCAE v4.0 will continue to be recorded and monitored 
throughout all courses of therapy.  
 
These  portions  of the study will utilize the rolling- six design for dose escalation. [21]  This design 
is a modification of the classic 3+3 dose escalation strategy.  With this design, two to six patients 
will be concurrently enrolled onto a dose level, dependent upon (1) the number of patients 
enrolled at the current dose level, (2) the number of patients who have experienced DLT at the 
current dose level, and (3) the number of patients entered but with tolerability data pending at the 
current dose level. Accrual is suspended when a cohort of six has enrolled or when the study 
endpoints have been met.  
 
For example, when three participants are enrolled onto a dose cohort, if toxicity data are available 
for all three when the fourth participant entered and there are no DLTs, the dose is escalated and 
the fourth participant is enrolled to the subs equent dose level. If data are not yet available for one 
or more of the first three participants and no DLT has been observed, or if ≤1 patients have 
experienced DLTs, the new participant is entered at the same dose level. Lastly, if two or more 
patients have experienced DLTs, the dose level is de- escalated. This process is repeated for 
participants five and six. In place of suspending accrual after every three participants, accrual is 
only suspended when a cohort of six is filled. When participants are ine valuable for toxicity, they 
are replaced with the next available participant if escalation or de- escalation rules have not been 
fulfilled at the time the next available participant is enrolled onto the study.  
 
If two or more of a cohort of up to six patien ts experience DLT at a given dose level, then the 
MTD has been exceeded and dose escalation will be stopped.  
 
In this study, the MTD will be defined as the highest dose tested in which 0 or only 1 patient –  out 
of a total of 6 patients –  experiences a DLT during the first course of therapy.    
 
The initial version of the protocol (Amendment #2) did not include mandatory myeloid growth 
factor support or mandatory cephalosporin diarrhea prophylaxis.  That version included a 
provision to replace the first pati ent with dose- limiting neutropenia or dose- limiting diarrhea.  
Based on the experience from the first 6 patients treated at dose level 1 , this provision would 
have been implemented and a patient replaced.  Given the toxicities observed in patients treated 
at dose level 1, Amendment #3 resumed  the phase I portion of the study with evaluation of 6 
more patients at dose level 1B with the same doses of irinotecan, temozolomide, and MLN8237 
as used in dose level 1, but with mandatory myeloid growth factor suppor t and mandatory 
cephalosporin diarrhea prophylaxis.   
 
In order to finalize the dose that will be used in the Phase 2  portion, i n addition to determination of 
the MTD, a descriptive summary of all toxicities will be reported.  Particular emphasis will be 
placed on descriptions of diarrhea, mucositis, and myelosuppression.  
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      55 Preliminary results of pharmacokinetic testing will be examined, including clearance, C max, Tmax, 
Css, and terminal half -life for both MLN8237 and irinotecan.  These parameters will be 
qualitatively compared with estimates from prior studies of MLN8237 and irinotecan as single 
agents.  These results will be reviewed by the study management committee for possible drug-
drug interactions.  This review will take place prior to activation of the phase 2  portion of the study  
and prior to escalation from dose level 1B to 2B in the oral solution cohort (if escalation supported 
by toxicity  and PK  data in that cohort) .   
 
10.4      Statistical Rules for the Phase 2 Portion  
The phase II portion at the MTD will enroll patients in two stages.  A maximum of 20 patients will 
contribute response data reflecting patients treated at the recommended dose of the combination 
of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.   
 
 Cumulative 
Number of 
Responses  Decision / Action  
Stage 1: Enter 14 patients  ≤ 0 Terminate the trial because the combination is not 
sufficiently effective (i.e. ORR < 15%)  
≥ 1 Continue trial (proceed to Stage 2), providing toxicity is 
acceptable  
Stage 2: Enter 6 additional 
patients (total of 20 patients)   
 Construct a 95% confidence interval for the objective 
response rate  
 
 
 
Under the hypothesis of a true response rate that is 15% or greater (derived from response rate 
in COG protocol ANBL0421 with irinotecan and temozolomide), there is a 90% chance that at 
least 1 of the 14 patients in Stage 1 of the expansion will experience an objective response 
(hence no responders in 14 patients will lead us to conclude that the true response rate is less 
than 15%).  With 20 patients, the half -width of a two- sided 95% confidence interval will be no 
more than +/ - 0.24 (using the method of Jennison and Tumbull to adjust for the two- stage 
design) . Completion of enrollment to stage 2 is therefore designed to pr ovide a more precise 
estimate of the response rate of this regimen.  
 
Toxicity Monitoring Plans for the Phase II Portion  
For the patients enrolled during the Phase II portion at the MTD, the following rules will be used to 
monitor toxicity and trigger a formal review of the all the toxicities, with the possibility of reducing 
the dose (applies to the new patients) :   
- If 2 patients experience a first course DLT (at least possibly attributed to the study drugs) 
in the 1st 6 patients  
- If 3 patients experience a first course DLT (at least possibly attributed to the study drugs) 
in the 1st 9 patients  
- If 4 patients experience a first course DLT (at least possibly attributed to the study drugs) 
in the 1st 12 patients  
- If 5 patients experience a first course DLT (at least possibly attributed to the study drugs) 
in the 1st 15 patients  
- If 6 patients experience a first course DLT (at least possibly attributed to the study drugs) 
in the 1st  18 patients  
- If 7 patients experience a first course DLT (at least possibly attributed to the study drugs)  
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      56  
Patients who enrolled as inevaluable for hematologic DLT due to marrow involvement and low 
baseline blood counts will remain inevaluable for hematologic DLT even if their bone marrow 
disease appears to improve on therapy.  The number of these patients who require dose 
modifications in subsequent courses will be reported descriptively . These patients will follow dose 
modification guidelines according to sections 4.6.1 and 4.6.2. These patients will be evaluable for 
response.  
 
The table below summarizes the probability that the boundary indicating excessive DLT’s has 
been crossed according to the rules above.  The values in the table below are based on 10,000 
simulations and are accurate to ± 0.01 (based on a 95% confidence interval).  
     
Table: Probability that the boundary indicating excessive DLT’s has been crossed  
True Chance of DLT  5% 10% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 
Probability of Excessive 
DLT’s  0.04 0.13 0.28 0.44 0.61 0.75 0.85 
 
 
10.5 Statistical Rules for Oral Solution Cohort  
 
Up to 6  patients  evaluable for dose escalation consideration (section 10.2.1)  will be enrolled at 
the starting dose level for this cohort ( dose level 1B = one dose level below the phase 2 dose 
obtained with enteric coated tablets), following the rolling- six rules in section 10.3.  After 
enrollment to this dose level is complete, the toxicity and pharmacokinetic parameters will be 
assessed by the study commit tee.   
 
If dose de-escalation is indicated based upon toxicity at dose level 1B, this  will occur following the 
rolling-six rules in section 10.3 and will occur independent of pharmacokinetic results.     
 
If dose escalation appears feasible based upon toxi city at dose level 1B, this will occur following 
the rolling -six rules in section 10.3 only if the study committee determines that MLN8237 
exposures are below predicted levels at dose level 1B.  This provision is in place since dose level 
2B with the oral solution is predicted to be comparable to dose level 3B with the tablet formulation 
and that dose level was not tolerable in the phase 1 portion of the study.      
 
Once the MTD with the oral solution has been determined, the study committee will assess the  
pharmacokinetic parameters to determine if enrollment of up to additional 6 patients at the MTD 
will be needed to better characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of the oral solution.   Interpatient 
variability and comparison with exposures obtained with oral solution and enteric coated tablets 
will be used to drive this determination.     
 
10.6  Analysis of Results  
 
The outcome status (in terms of  number of courses received, toxicity, response, reason off 
treatment , progression, and survival) of all registered patients will be reported.  
 
10.6.1 Toxicity  
All toxicities observed will be summarized in terms of type (organ affected or laboratory 
determination), severity (by NCI CTCAE), and attribution. Tables will be created to summarize 
theses toxicities  and side effects by tablet vs. oral solution, by dose level  and by course.  
Particular emphasis will be placed on descriptions of diarrhea, mucositis, and myelosuppression.  
 
 
10.6.2   Response/Outcome 
All eligible patients who begin treatment will be included in the analysis of  overall  survival,  event -
free survival (EFS) , and best response (defined in Section 11.0 below) .  Patients with measurable 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      57 or evaluable tumor who receive study therapy or who progress prior to completion of therapy will 
be included in a planned subset analysis of tumor response (per Section 5.2.2) .  
Overall survival is defined as the time from start of treatment until death due to any cause or time 
of last follow -up if the patient is alive at the last known follow -up.  Event -free survival is defined as 
time from start of treatment to disease progression, development of a second malignancy, or 
death – whichever comes first;  patients who are alive, have not progressed or developed a new 
malignancy will be censored at their last foll ow-up.   
 
10.7 Monitoring Plan for Death within 30 Days of Last Treatment  
Each death on study not due to tumor will be reviewed by the NANT Study Management 
Committee, reported to NANT DSMB and a decision in consultation with NANT DSMB and IND 
sponsor will  be made to close the trial, modify the trial, or continue unchanged; in addition, it will 
be determined if the event requires that new information be added to the informed consent.  Each 
death occurring within 30 days of completing the last dose of MLN8237 regardless of cause will 
be reviewed and reported to the NANT DSMB and to the FDA according to standard procedure.   
 
10.8 Pharmacokinetic and Correlative Biology Studies  
Routine pharmacokinetic parameters for both MLN8237 and irinotecan will be determined using 
standard methods and reported descriptively.  After completion of the phase II portion of the 
study, a final pharmacokinetic analysis will be performed that incorporates results from the phase 
I, phase II , and oral solution cohort  portions of the study.  Parameters to be determined include 
exposure, clearance, C max, T max, C ss, and terminal half -life for both MLN8237 and irinotecan.  
These parameters will be assessed for both the enteric coated tablet formulation and for the oral 
solution formulation.  These parameters will be qualitatively compared with estimates from prior 
studies of MLN8237 and irinotecan as single agents.   In addition, these parameters for MLN8237 
will be qualitatively compared between the enteric coated tablet and oral solution formulations.     
 
The correlative biology studies are considered descriptive.  For the study of UGT1A1  genotype 
and toxicity, patients will first be categor ized according to the number of UGT1A1*28 alleles (0, 1, 
or 2 copies of the allele).  Association between UGT1A1  genotype and occurrence of (any) DLT 
and diarrhea will then be  examined qualitatively.  For the study of Aurora A expression, patients 
will fir st be categorized as having “high” or “low” Aurora A tumor expression for both mRNA and 
protein (using a median split) .  Association between Aurora A expression, response and EFS  will 
then be examined.  Similarly, associations between MYCN  amplification sta tus and Aurora A 
expression (mRNA and protein), response and EFS, and will be examined. These descriptive 
analyses will use contingency tables, scatterplots, and Kaplan- Meier plots, as well as 
corresponding quantitative measures of association.  Association between AURKA genotype and 
objective response will be examined qualitatively.  Patients will be categorized according to 
genotype at the two AURKA  SNPs of interest (homozygous wild type; heterozygous; homozygous 
minor allele), with the percent of patient s with at least a partial response or better given in each 
category.   
 
10.9     Inclusion of Women and Minorities  
 
The study is open to all participants regardless of gender or ethnicity. Review of accrual to past 
NANT studies of new agents demonstrates t he accrual of both genders and all NIH -identified 
ethnicities to such studies. The small number of patients entered into this trial will obviate any 
analysis of variation in response rate with gender or ethnicity.  
 
 
  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      58 11.0 RESPONSE CRITERIA  VERSION 1. 2 
 
With Amendment #6 , response criteria have changed to the following NANT Response Criteria 
version 1. 2.  The previous NANT Response Criteria versions  1.0 and 1.1 have been moved to 
Appendix VII  and Appendix VIII , respectively , for reference.   For all patients enrolling prior to 
Amendment #5, sites should continue to utilize version 1.0 to assess and report response.   For all 
patients enrolling with Amendment #5 and after, sites will use  version 1. 2 to assess and report 
response.   NANT central review of response will utilize version 1. 2 for all patients.  
 
Overall response will incorporate all three parameters: CT/MRI; MIBG ( FDG -PET is substituted 
for MIBG non- avid tumors); and bone marrow response with response defined as outlined in 
Section 11. 6.  Response for each parameter and overall response will be reported by the treating 
site using the criteria below. However, the final statistical analysis of response will be defined by 
central review, using the same criteria below.  
 
11.1 Response Criteria for CT/MRI  Lesions  
 
For lesions evaluated by CT/MRI, this study will use the definitions of measurable disease from 
the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1; European Journal Cancer 45: 
228-247, 2009) modified per the criteria below to define tar get lesions (lesions which are 
measurable AND evaluable for response).  
 
11.1.1  Definition of soft tissue TARGET LESIONS on CT/MRI:  
 
Soft tissue target lesions that will be followed for response must meet criteria in a. and b. below:  
a. A target lesion must be measurable, defined as a soft tissue lesion that can be 
accurately measured in at least one dimension with a longest diameter ≥ 10mm, or 
for lymph nodes ≥ 15mm on short axis.  (The short axis is measured after identifying 
the longest diameter of a lymph node or nodal mass, and then measuring the longest 
perpendicular diameter to that as the short axis).  
b. A target lesion must also be evaluable for response:  To be evaluable, the lesion 
must also be MIBG or FDG -PET avid (if tumor known to be MIBG non- avid), o r have 
a biopsy as required in the eligibility criteria.  If one soft tissue lesion present at 
enrollment is biopsied showing neuroblastoma or ganglioneuroblastoma at any time 
point, then all other soft tissue lesions present at enrollment are considered 
evaluable.  Bone marrow positivity does not affect soft tissue evaluability.  
 
NOTE: Soft tissue components of bone lesions will be considered measurable lesions if > 
10mm in at least one dimension, and evaluable for response if MIBG avid (or FDG -PET-
avid if  tumor known to be MIBG non- avid).  
 
Serial measurements of target lesions are to be done with the same method of 
assessment (either CT or MRI) used to characterize each lesion reported at baseline.  
The sum of diameters (longest for non- nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all 
target lesions will be calculated and reported as the sum of diameters . 
 
 
11.1.2  NON -TARGET SOFT TISSUE LESIONS will include:  
 
a. Leptomeningeal tumor and tumor in cerebrospinal fluid cytology will be considered 
non-target lesions.  
b. Lesions  that are considered likely to be active tumor  by the treating physician based 
on clinical correlation (for example, hepatic and pulmonary nodules)  
 
11.1.3  The following lesions will NOT be followed to evaluate response either as target lesions or 
non-target lesions, if the y meet the criteria below AND  the treating physician feels they are 
unlikely to represent active tumor (an exception for active tumor will be made for c. below):  
a. Measurable soft tissue lesions (≥ 10mm) that are not MIBG avid or PET avid (if tumor 
known to be MIBG non- avid) and if biopsied did not show neuroblastoma or 
ganglioneuroblastoma.  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      59 b. Non- measurable soft tissue lesions < 10mm or non- measurable lymph nodes 
(defined as lymph nodes >10 to <15mm on short axis).  
c. Intramedullary bone lesions will not be follo wed for CT/MRI response even though 
they are felt to represent active tumor  since they will be evaluated with MIBG scans 
(or FDG -PET scans if MIBG non- avid), and since bone changes on CT/MRI are 
known to persist after resolution of active tumor.   
 
11.1.4 The response of the CT/MRI lesions will be defined as outlined below:  
 
11.1.4.1  Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all target and non- target CT/MRI lesions.   
 
11.1.4.2  Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in sum of diameters of CT/MRI lesions (using longest diameter for non-
nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions), taking as reference the measurement of target 
lesions performed at study enrollment. Non- target CT/MRI lesions must be stable to smaller in 
size.  No new lesions.  MIB G (FDG -PET for MIBG non -avid tumors) uptake may still be present in 
lesions positive at enrollment.  
 
11.1.4.3  Progressive Disease (PD)  
At least a 20% increase in sum of diameters of target lesions (using longest dimension for non-
nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters 
while on study (this includes the baseline if that is the small est on study).  In addition to the 
relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of 5mm. A new 
target or non- target tumor lesion seen on CT/MRI without MIBG or PET uptake is considered PD, 
but may be biopsied to rule out PD.  An overall substantial worsening of non -target CT/MRI 
lesions is also considered as a criteria for PD (guidance for substantial includes a 73% increase  
in volume, or sufficient worsening of overall non- target disease such that the treating physician 
feels a change in therapy is indicated).     
 
New uptake of MIBG (or FDG -PET for MIBG non- avid tumors) at target and/or non- target lesions 
which are stable in size, will be captured in MIBG response(or FDG PET response if tumor is 
MIBG non- avid) and will NOT be graded as CT/MRI progression (CT/MRI would be graded as 
SD). Biopsy of such lesions can be done to rule out PD for the MIBG (or FDG -PET) response.   
 
11.1.4.4  Stable disease (SD)  
(Applies only to patients with target lesions)  
Neither sufficient shrinkage in sum of diameters to qualify for PR and patient does not meet any 
criteria for PD. No new lesions.  Non- target lesions must be stable to smaller in size.  
 
11.1.4.5  Stable disease- no target lesions (SD -NTL)   
(Applies to patients with non- target lesions only)  
Non- target lesions are still present; may be smaller or stable in size, and do not meet criteria for 
PD.  No new non -target tumor lesions (new lesions may be biopsied to rule out PD).  
 
11.1.4.6  Not involved (NI):  No target or non- target lesions  
 
11.1.4.7  Non- target lesions only:  Patient has no target lesions, but does have non- target 
lesions.  
 
11.1.4.8  Not evaluable (NE)  
 CT/MRI scans are of inadequate quality as assessed by central reviewer, or scans are not 
repeated of all lesions with tumor documented at entry. (Note that patients not evaluable at a 
given time point may be evaluable for response at later time points if all scans done with 
adequate quality at later time point.) or if based on Study Management Committee / PI review it is 
deemed that there is insufficient data to grade response.  
 
11.1.4.9  Not done (ND)  
No CT/MRI scans were done at the given time point.  
 
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      60 11.2 Response Criteria for Morphologic Bone Marrow Disease  
 
Routine morphology (with or without routine immunocytochemistry) w ill be used for baseline 
evaluation and all subsequent response evaluations performed while on protocol therapy, and at 
end of protocol therapy.  Central review will be performed on bilateral biopsies only, unless tumor 
is seen only on aspirates.  
 
Patients  with ≤ 5% tumor on all samples of the bilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsies at 
study entry will be evaluable for bone marrow response, but defined separately from patients with 
> 5% at study entry.  
 
The percentage of tumor in an aspirate will be cal culated as the number of tumor cells divided by 
the number of total nucleated cells.  The percentage of tumor in a biopsy will be calculated as the 
percent of tumor cells (including neuroblasts, mature and maturing ganglion cells) based on the 
bone marrow parenchymal surface area examined (excluding Schwannian stroma).   
 
11.2.1  Complete Response (CR)  
Greater than 5% tumor cells seen on any one sample of bilateral aspirates/biopsies performed at 
study entry, with no tumor cells seen on bilateral aspirates and biopsies at one subsequent time 
point.  
 
11.2.2 Complete Response Minimal Residual Disease (CR- MRD) Percentage of tumor ≤ 5% on 
all samples of bilateral aspirates/biopsies at study entry, with no tumor cells seen on bilateral 
aspirates and biopsies at one subsequent time point after starting protocol therapy.  If subsequent 
time points remain negative, then patient is classified as CR -MRD.  If subsequent time points are 
intermittently positive but with ≤ 10% tumor, then response should be reclassified as SD at the 
negative time points initially reported as CR -MRD.  
 
11.2.3  Progressive Disease (PD)  
Patients with any amount of tumor in the bone marrow  at study entry  will be considered to have 
PD if one subsequent evaluation show s >10% tumor  on any one bone marrow sample AND there 
is a doubling in the amount of tumor compared to study entry (baseline).  
 
For example a patient entering with ≤ 5% tumor in marrow must increase to >  10% tumor to have 
PD; a patient entering with 30% tumor must incr ease to >60% tumor.  If patients have an 
increase in tumor amount which is less than the amount specified for PD, the response will be 
classified as SD.  
 
Patients who enter on study with no tumor seen will be considered PD if ONE subsequent 
evaluation sho ws >10% tumor.  If ≤  10% tumor is seen on one subsequent evaluation or 
intermittently, the response will be classified as SD.  
 
11.2.4  Stable Disease (SD)  
Stable disease will be defined as persistence of an amount of tumor in the bone marrow that does 
not m eet criteria for progressive disease or CR or CR - Minimal Residual Disease. (Note that 
patients who enter with ≤ 5% tumor and have one negative bone marrow which is initially graded 
as a CR -MRD and then on subsequent time points have 1- 10% tumor noted woul d be then 
considered as SD at all time points, including the time point initially graded as CR).  
 
11.2.5  Not Evaluable (NE)  
Patients for whom follow -up bone marrows do not include an attempt to obtain bilateral aspirates 
and biopsies and do not have at l east one adequate biopsy sample, as assessed by local site’s 
pathology report for that time point or if based on Study Management Committee / PI review it is 
deemed that there is insufficient data to grade response.    
 
11.2.6  N ot involved (NI)  
Patients with no evidence of neuroblastoma in the bone marrow at study entry, and remain 
negative on subsequent evaluations.  (Note that such patients may be reclassified as SD if they 
meet the SD criteria above with intermittent tumor in the bone marrow).  
 
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      61 11.2.7  Not done (ND)  
Bone marrow evaluation not done at a given time point.  
 
  
11.3.  Response Criteria for MIBG Avid Lesions  
 
MIBG response will be graded using a modification of the Curie scoring scale ( Eur J Cancer 
1995;31A:256- 261).  The treating site will report the MIBG response using Curie, however the 
statistical endpoint of MIBG response will utilize the Curie score from the central reviewer.  
 
MIBG scans will be scored for 10 regions; 9 anatomic regions for skeletal metastases, and a 10th 
region for any MIBG a vid soft tissue disease.  
 
Each of the 10 regions will be given a score of 0- 3, as defined below.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Scoring of Skeletal Disease  
Regions 1 – 9 
Scoring  MIBG uptake  
0 No MIBG uptake  
1 1 focal lesion  
2 > 1 focal lesion  
3 > 50% of a region  
 
 
The absolute extension score is obtained by adding the scores of all ten regions.  The presence 
of a MIBG avid lesion, and NOT the “intensity” of MIBG -avidity, determines the scoring within a 
particular region.  
 
REGIONS 1 – 9 / SKELETAL DISEASE:  Cranio -facial disease is scored in Region 1, cervico-
thoracic spine in Region 2, ribs / sternum / clavicles / scapula in Region 3, lumbar -sacral spine in 
Region 4, pelvis in Region 5, humeri in Region 6, distal upper extremities in Region 7, femurs in 
Region 8, and distal lower extremities in Region 9 (see figure below).  
 

   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      62 REGION 10 / SOFT TISSUE DISEASE:  Soft tissue disease within the neck, chest or 
abdomen/pelvis is scored within Region 10.  Examples of soft tissue lesions may include MIBG 
avid cervical, paraspi nous, adrenal, renal, retroperitoneal, or hepatic masses.  
 
SCORING SOFT TISSUE DISEASE:   Score = 1 indicates an isolated  soft tissue mass that 
encompasses < 50% of that region (chest or abdomen/pelvis).  Score = 2 indicates > 1 soft tissue 
lesion in the neck, chest or abdomen/pelvis.  A soft tissue score = 3 indicates MIBG avid soft 
tissue disease that emcompasses > 50% of either the chest or abdomen/pelvis.  (For example, a 
large adrenal mass in which the MIBG avidity encompasses > 50% of the abdomen/pelvi s is 
scored a 3 for Region 10).  Cervical soft tissue disease is included in the chest region.  
 
If no MIBG -avid soft tissue lesions are present, then score 0 for Region 10.  
 
If a solitary soft tissue lesion extends into both the chest and abdomen/pelvic re gions, score 3 for 
that lesion.  For example, a large paraspinous mass that extends along the thoracic and lumbar 
spine would be scored a 3 for Region 10.  Any corresponding metastatic bone disease within the 
thoracic or lumbar spine would be scored separately for the cervico- thoracic spine (Region 2) and 
lumbar spine (Region 4).  
 
Conjugate planar imaging will be used to score a given region.  SPECT scans may be used as an 
adjunct, but only to help delineate the location of the MIBG avid lesion.  
 
The relati ve score is calculated by dividing the absolute score at each time by the corresponding 
pre-treatment overall score. The relative score of each patient is calculated at each response 
assessment and classified as below:  
a. Complete response:  all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved.  
b. Partial response: Relative score >  0.1 to <  0.5 
c. Stable disease: Relative score >  0.5 to < 1.2  
d. Progressive disease:  New lesions on MIBG scan OR a relative score > 1.2.  Biopsy 
of new lesions may be done to rule out progressive disease. If biopsy is negative for 
tumor (neuroblastoma and/or ganglioneuroblastoma), patient will not meet definition of 
PD.   
e.  Not evaluable (NE):   MIBG scan of inadequate quality as ass essed by central 
reviewer.  
f.  Not involved (NI):  No MIBG avid lesions at study entry and subsequent response 
time points.  
g. Not done (ND):  MIBG scan not done at a given response time point  
 
11.4   Response Criteria using FDG -PET scans (for MIBG non -avid patients)  
 
Patients known to be non- avid for MIBG should have FDG -PET scans performed for monitoring 
response. FDG -PET avid lesions will be scored by the presence or absence of a lesion with uptake 
that is two times above background.  
 
11.4.1 Complete response (CR)  
Resolution of all FDG -PET uptake in all FDG -PET avid lesions identified at baseline and no new 
FDG-PET avid lesions.  
 
11.4.2  Partial response (PR)  
Reduction of number of lesions by FDG -PET by > = 50%.   No new FDG -PET avid lesions.  
 
11.4.3  Stable disease (SD)  
Changes that do not meet the criteria for PR or PD.   
 
11.4.4  Progressive disease (PD)  
New lesions on FDG -PET scan.  Note: biopsy may be done to exclude causes of FDG -PET uptake 
other than tumor.  If biopsy is negative for tumor (neuroblastoma and/or ganglioneuroblastoma), 
patient will not meet definition of PD.   
 
11.4.5  Not evaluable (NE)  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      63 FDG-PET scan of inadequate quality to evaluate response or if based on Study Management 
Committee / PI review it is deemed that there is insufficient dat a to grade response.  
 
11.4.6  Not involved (NI)  
No FDG -PET uptake that is two times above background.   
 
11.4.7  Not done (ND)  
FDG-PET scan not done at a given time point.  
 
On central review, FDG -PET avid lesions will be evaluated by both the Curie scoring method and 
by enumeration of lesions to grade response.  
 
11.5 Urine Catechol amines  
 
Due to variance with diet and concomitant medications, frequently missing dopamine levels, and 
lack of standardized methodology for this assay, urine catecholamines  will n ot be utilized in 
grading response.  Results of urine catecholamines will still be requested at all response 
evaluation time points and recorded in database as both actual value and as “elevated” or “not 
elevated”.  Catecholamines must be at least 3 standard deviations above the mean for age to be 
classified as “elevated”.  
 
11.6 Definition of Overall Response for Each Patient  
 
The criteria below will be used to define the overall response for each patient, with consideration of 
all three individual response parameters: CT/MRI, MIBG (FDG -PET if MIBG non -avid), and Bone 
Marrow.  
 
11.6.1 Complete Response (CR)  
Response of CR or NI for MIBG, (FDG -PET if tumor is not MIBG avid), CT/MRI, and bone 
marrow.   
 
11.6.2  Complete Response MRD (CR- MRD ) 
Response of CR or NI for MIBG (FDG -PET if tumor is not MIBG avid), CT/MRI response of CR or 
NI, with BM response of CR-MRD   
 
11.6.3  Partial Response (PR)  
Response of PR in both CT/MRI and MIBG (FDG -PET if tumor is not MIBG avid); or response of 
PR in eithe r CT/MRI or MIBG (FDG -PET if tumor is not MIBG avid) with response of CR, NI, or 
SD-NTL for other parameter.  Bone marrow response of either CR, CR -MRD, NI, or SD for 
patients with maximum amount of tumor ≤ 5% at baseline.   
 
11.6.4  Progressive Disease (PD ) 
Either one of the following will define an overall response of PD:  
a. At least one response parameter including CT/MRI, MIBG, bone marrow and/or FDG -
PET response is PD.  If PD is found by one parameter, the other two parameters are 
not required to be evaluated to define an overall response of PD.  
b. Treating physician grades patient as progressive disease based on clinical 
assessment wi thout radiographic or bone marrow evaluations.  
  
11.6.5  Stable disease (SD)   
Response of stable disease for at least one parameter, with response of SD, NI, or SD -NTL 
forother parameters.   
 
11.6.6  Minor response (MR)  
Complete response,  Complete- MRD response, and/or partial response for one parameter (i.e. 
CT/MRI, MIBG (FDG -PET if MIBG non -avid), bone marrow), with response of stable disease for 
second parameter and any response other than PD or not evaluable for third parameter.  
 
 
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      64 11.6.7  Not evaluable (NE)  
Response of  Not evaluable for one or more response parameters including CT/MRI, MIBG (FDG -
PET if MIBG non -avid), or bone marrow for any parameter that had measurable/evaluable tumor at 
study enrollment.  However, if one parameter is done and demonstrates PD this is defined as an 
overall response of PD.  In addition, response may be declared not evaluable if review by the Study 
Management Committee / PI deems that there is insufficient data to grade response.  
 
11.6.8  No progression  
Baseline status at enrollment was NI or non- target lesions only for CT, NI for bone marrow, NI for 
MIBG (FDG -PET if MIBG non -avid) and there has NOT been PD at any site since on protocol 
therapy  
 
11.6.9  Not done (ND)  
Response not assessed at this time point.  
 
11.6.10   Summary  
The overall response as assessed at any particular time point based on consideration of each of the 
three parameters as defined above is summarized in the following table:

NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      65 12.0 ADVERSE EVENT REPORT ING REQUIREMENTS  
 
Rapid mandatory toxicity case report and hemogram forms will be submitted to the NANT 
Operations Office weekly for all patients on Course 1.  
 
12.1 Purpose  
 
Adverse event data collection and reporting, which are required as part of every clinical trial, are 
done to ensure the safety of patients enrolled i n the studies as well as those who will enroll in 
future studies using similar agents. Adverse events are reported in a routine manner at scheduled 
times during a trial. (Please follow directions for routine reporting provided in the data collection 
packet  for this protocol). Additionally, certain adverse events must be reported in an expedited 
manner to allow for timelier monitoring of patient safety and care. The following sections provide 
information about expedited reporting through the use of a written IND safety report (MedWatch) 
to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  
 
Adverse events will be graded according to the NCI Common Terminology Criteria for A dverse 
Events (CTCAE), Version 4.   A copy of the CTCAEv4 can be downloaded from the CTEP home 
page ( http://ctep.cancer.gov) .   
 
12.2  Definitions  
 
Adverse Event  (AE): An adverse event means any untoward medical occurrence associated 
with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
 
Suspected Adverse Reaction: Any adverse event for which there is a reasonable possibility that 
the drug caused the adverse event.  Reasonable possibility means there is evidence to suggest a 
causal relationship between the drug and the adverse event.  
 
Unexpected Adverse Event or Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction:  An adverse event 
or suspected adverse reaction is considered “unexpected” if it is not listed in the investigator 
brochure or is not listed at the specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an investigator 
brochure is not available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigational plan.  
 
Serious Adverse Events (SAE) or Serious Suspected Adverse Reactions:  An adverse event 
or suspected adverse react ion is considered serious if, in the view of either the investigator or 
sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:  
 
Death of Patient  An event that results in the death of a patient.  
Life-Threatening  An event that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have resulted in immediate 
fatality if medical intervention had not been taken.  This does not include an event 
that would have been fatal if it had occurred in a more severe form.  
Hospitalization  An event that results in an admission to the hospital for any length of time.  This 
does not include an emergency room visit or admission to an outpatient facility.  
Prolongation of 
Hospitalization  An event that occurs while the study patient is hospitalized and prolongs the 
patient’s hospital  stay.  
Congenital 
Anomaly  An anomaly detected at or after birth or any anomaly that result in fetal loss.  
Persistent or 
Significant 
Disability/ 
Incapacity An event that results in a condition that substantially interferes with the activities of 
daily living of a study patient.  Disability is not intended to include experiences of 
relatively minor medical significance such as headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, 
influenza, or accidental trauma ( e.g., sprained ankle).  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      66 Important Medical 
Event Requiring 
Medical or Surgical 
Intervention to 
Prevent Serious 
Outcome  An important medical event  that may not be immediately life -threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization, but based on medical judgment may jeopardize the patient 
and may require medical or s urgical intervention to prevent any of the outcomes 
listed above ( i.e., death of patient, life- threatening, hospitalization, prolongation of 
hospitalization, congenital anomaly, or persistent or significant disability/incapacity). 
Examples of such events i nclude allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug 
abuse.  
 
12.3 Expedited Serious Adver se Event Reporting to NANT Operations  
 
For any serious adverse event, both expected and unexpected : 
 
• Contact the Study Chairperson and the NANT Operations Center to alert them to the  
       existence of the serious adverse event within 24 hours of learning of the event  
• Within 48 hours of learning of the event complete the NANT SAE form (see NANT  website 
www.nant.org  under protocol data forms/generic forms packet)  and email to 
NANTstaff@chla.usc.edu .   
• Follow -up in formation should be submitted as soon as relevant information is available.  
 
Copies of all serious adverse event reports will be kept on file in the NANT Operations Center. All 
NANT institutions are to file SAE reports with their Institutional Review Boards according to local 
institutional policy .   
 
12.4 Expedited Adverse Event Reporting to the FDA  
 
Per CFR 312.32 (c), the sponsor of the IND, Steven DuBois , must notify the FDA and all 
participating investigators in a written IND safety report of any adverse experience associated 
with use of the drug  that is both serious and unexpected.  Each written notification shall be 
made as soon as possible, and in no event later than 15 calendar days after the sponsor’s initial 
receipt of the information.   Each written notification may be submitted on FDA Form 3500A 
(MedWatch) or in a narrative format and must bear prominent identification of its contents, i.e., 
“IND Safety Report”.  Follow -up information to a safety report should be submitted as soon as t he 
relevant information is available.  
 
The sponsor must also notify FDA by telephone  or by facsimile  transmission of any 
unexpected fatal or life -threatening  experience associated with use of the drug  in the 
clinical studies conducted under the IND as soon as possible but in no event later than 7 
calendar  days after initial receipt of the information.  
 
Each telephone call or facsimile transmission to the FDA shall be transmitted to the FDA division 
that has responsibility for review of the IND; a specific c ontact person is assigned to each IND at the 
time the application is filed, and this will be included in the FDA’s correspondence acknowledging 
receipt of the IND application.   
 
12.5 NANT Operations Center Role in Expedited Adverse Event Reporting to the FDA 
and Participating Sites   
 
For purposes of this protocol, the MedWatch Report Form (FDA 3500A) will be submitted to the 
FDA by NANT on behalf of the IND sponsor, Steven DuBois.  These forms will be submitted to the 
appropriate FDA division and will serve as the written IND safety report.  The NANT Operations 
Center will file all expedited adverse event reports as well as other adverse events with the FDA 
and other relevant authorities or investigator s.  The IND sponsor, Steven DuBois, has also 
delegated to the NANT Operations Center the telephone/facsimile FDA notification responsibilities 
for unexpected fatal or life- threatening experiences.  All IND submissions will be maintained in a 
master file at  the NANT Operations Center . 
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      67 For Adverse Events associated with the use of the drug that are both Serious and Unexpected:  
• The MedWatch form will be drafted by the NANT Operations Center based on the SAE 
form within 10 days of the adverse event and reviewed with PI at treating site and the study 
chair.  Final Medwatch form will be submitted to FDA by NANT Operations Center.  
Electronic version of MedWatch form is available from NANT Operations Center or Med 
Watch website www.fda.gov/medwatch . NANT will forward the completed report the FDA 
and other relevant authorities or investigators on behalf of the IND Sponsor, Steven 
DuBois.  
• Follow -up information should be submitted as soon as relevant information is available.  
 
 
For Adverse Events associated with the use of the drug that are Unexpected or Life Threatening:  
• Notify the NANT Operations Center (who will notify the FDA and other relevant authorities 
and investigators) by telephone or fax as soon as possible but no later than 7 calendar 
days from the occurrence of the event.  
 
FDA PHONE:  1-800-332-1088  
FDA FAX:  1-800-332-0178  
 
• The MedWatch form wil l be drafted by the NANT Operations Center based on the SAE 
form within 10 days of the adverse event and reviewed with PI at treating site and the study 
chair.  Final Medwatch form will be submitted to FDA and other relevant authorities or 
investig ators by  NANT Operations Center on behalf of the IND Sponsor, Steven DuBois.   
• Follow -up information should be submitted as soon as relevant information is available.  
 
A cover letter to accompany the Med Watch report will be prepared by the NANT Operations 
Center in collaboration with the IND sponsor , Dr. DuBois. Cover letter will be submitted with 
MedWatch report to the FDA and other NANT institutions and relevant authorities).  Contents will 
include:  
 
1. An assessment of the adverse event and its significance/relevance to the study.  Does the 
occurrence of this AE alter the risk/benefit ratio of the study.  
2. A statement as to whether this adverse event has been reported previously, and if so, 
whether the frequency is considered unusually high.  
3. A statement as to whether  the informed consent should reflect changes in the potential 
risks involved.  
 
Copies of all adverse event reports will be kept on file in the NANT Operations Center.  All NANT 
institutions are to file AE reports with their Institutional Review Boards according to local 
institutional policy.  The NANT Operations Center will also distribute copies of AE reports to 
Millennium  Pharmaceuticals Inc within two working days.  
 
 
12.6  Adverse event reporting requirements for Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc

12.8   Procedures for Reporting Drug Exposure during Pregnancy and Birth Events  
 
If a woman becomes pregnant or suspects that she is pregnant while participating in this study, she 
must inform the investigator immediately and must permanently discontinue study drug(s).   All 
pregnancies and suspected pregnancies will be reported to Millennium Pharmacovigilance by the 
NANT Operations Office (see Section 12.4 for contact information) immediately.   The pregnancy 
must be followed for the final pregnancy outcome (ie, delivery, still b irth, miscarriage) and 
Millennium Pharmacovigilance will request this information from the investigator.  
 
If a female partner of a male patient becomes pregnant during the male patient’s participation in this 
study, this must be reported to Millennium Phar macovigilance by the NANT Operations Office 
immediately (see Section 12.4 for contact information).   Every effort should be made to follow the 
pregnancy for the final pregnancy outcome.”

The word “you” used throughout this docume nt refers to you or your child.  
 
 
WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT?  
 
This study is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Clinical trials include only patients who 
choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision about participating. You may 
discuss your decision with your friends, family, and health care team. If you have any questions, 
you may ask your study doctor.  
 
You are invited  to participate in this study because you have been diagnosed with 
neuroblastoma. Your cancer has either grown back (relapsed) or has never gone away 
(persistent tumor) after standard treatment. Standard treatment may have included 
chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy and/or high- dose chemotherapy with a stem cell 
transplant.  
 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
The purposes of this study are: 
 
To find the highest doses of MLN8237, that can be given with irinotecan, and temozolomide 
without causing severe side effects.  
 
To find out the side effects seen by giving MLN8237 at different dose levels with irinotecan, and 
temozolomide.  
 
To measure the levels of MLN8237 and irinotecan in the blood at different dose levels  
 
To determine if your tumor gets smaller after treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan, and 
temozolomide  
 
To determine if specific gene changes  makes you more prone to side effects from and/or 
response to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide  
 
To determine if the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide delays disease 
progression in patients with relapsed or  progressive neuroblastoma  
 
To determine if the amount of something in your tumor called MYCN or Aurora A makes you 
more likely to have a good response to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and 
temozolomide  
  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      73 The research is being done because:  
 
Currently there is no known effective treatment for your type of cancer.  
 
This study will combine an oral drug called MLN8237 with two chemotherapy medicines called 
irinotecan and temozolomide.     
 
MLN8237 is an investigational drug that is not approved by the FDA.  MLN8237 blocks the 
function of a protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells.  This drug has been tested as a 
single- agent in children with relapsed solid tumors, including patients with neuroblastoma.   In the 
laboratory, MLN8237 appears to make neuroblastoma tumors smaller.  This effect is even greater 
when MLN8237 is combined with the chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and temozolomide.   
 
Irinotecan and temozolomide are both FDA -approved chemotherapy drugs.  These drugs are 
approved for the treatment of certain adult cancers, but have also been used to treat children with 
cancer.  These drugs have been used in combination in many people with neuroblastoma.  In 
some patients with neuroblastoma, this combination reduces the amount of neuroblastoma.   
 
Giving MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide may increase the effectiveness of 
this combination.  We first need to find out the highest dose of MLN8237 that can be given safely 
together with irinotecan and temozolomide.  This study will be the first study to test giving 
MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide.  Once we have found out the highest dose 
of MLN8237 that can be given with irinotecan and temozolomide, we will treat more patients with 
this combination to determine how effective it is.   
 
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
22 people joined this first “phase 1” part of the study.  Up to 20 people will take part in a separate 
“phase 2” part of the study .  Another 6- 18 people will take part in a different ongoing part of the 
study if they cannot swallow MLN8237 pills.   
 
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IF I TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
Medical Tests Before You Begin the Study  
 
You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can received the 
treatment part of  the study. These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and 
may be done even if you do not join the study. These tests will also be done at various times 
throughout the study and at the end of the study. The purpose of these tests is t o see how well 
the treatment works and to measure the status of your neuroblastoma. If you have had some of 
them recently, they may not need to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor.  
 
Physical exam   Bone marrow tests# 
Blood tests  Various scans*  
Pregnancy test   
Urine tests   
 
#Bone marrow tests are done by inserting a needle into the hip bone to remove the marrow which 
is inside the bone.  
* Various scans that are done for diagnosis and checking the response of the tumor to treatment. 
Thes e may include CT and /or MRI scans , Bone scans  and MIBG or PET scans. We will 
recommend scans specific for your case and we will answer your questions about these scans  
 
During the Study  
 
If the exams, tests and procedures show that you can be in the study, and you choose to take 
part, then you will need the following tests and procedures during the study. They are part of 
regular cancer care.

You will receive irinotecan  into the bloodstream ( either  through your central line or through a 
small tube placed in a vein in your hand or ar m) over 1 hour on days 1- 5.  This medicine is 
typically given in the clinic.   
 
You will receive temozolomide by mouth once a day on days 1- 5.  The medicine is most 
commonly given as a capsule.  If you have a hard time swallowing capsules, the medicine can 
also taken out of the capsule and swallowed with applesauce or apple juice.  This medicine is 
given 1 hour before the irinotecan is given.  This medicine is given on an empty stomach.   
 
You will receive MLN8237 by mouth once a day on days 1- 7.  The medicine can only be given as 
a tablet.  On days 1- 5, this medicine is given 1 hour before the irinotecan is given.  This medicine 
is given on an empty stomach.   
 
You will receive an oral antibiotic (cefixime or cefpodoxime) by mouth once a day or twice a day 
on days - 1 through day +8.  This antibiotic is given to reduce the chances of getting diarrhea that 
can be seen in patients treated with irinotecan.  
 
You will also receive a drug to boost the white blood cells count (filgrastim or pegfilgrastim).  This 
drug will be started on day 8 of each cycle of treatment.  Filgrastim is a shot giv en into the skin 
each day until the white blood cell count increases.  Pegfilgrastim is a long- acting version of 
filgrastim that is given as a shot into the skin just once per cycle.  Your study doctor will talk with 
you about which of these drugs you will  receive.     
 
When you join the study, y ou will be assigned a certain MLN8237 dose.  This study will test up to 
four MLN8237 doses in groups of 3- 6 patients. The starting MLN8237 dose for the first group of 
patients is a bout 4 0% lower than what is currently being given to patients receiving MLN8237  
alone without bad side effects. If this is tolerated without serious side effects, then the MLN8237 
dose will be increased (“dose escalation”) in groups of 3- 6 patients until serious side eff ects are 
seen. At that point, investigators will have found the highest dose of MLN8237 that can be given 
along with irinotecan and temozolomide without bad side effects.   This part of the study is called 
the Phase I part of the study.    Disease evaluation after cycles 2, 4, 
8, and then every 4 cycles.  
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      75  
The doses of iri notecan and temozolomide are not increased during this study, though the dose 
of temozolomide may be decreased depending upon the side effects seen in other patients.  The 
doses used are typical doses used to treat patients with neuroblastoma.   
 
After the highest dose of MLN8237 that can be given with irinotecan and temozolomide has been 
found, another group of 8- 20 patients will be treated with that highest dose to help determine how 
effective this combination is in treating neuroblastoma.  This part of t he study is called the Phase 
II part of the study.   
 
You will only participate in the Phase I part of the study.  
 
You can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not 
having bad side effects and as long as your tumor  is not getting worse. Although other 
participating patients may receive a different dose of MLN8237, your assigned dose of MLN8237 
will not change during your participation in this study unless you develop certain side effects that 
necessitate lowering yo ur dose of MLN8237.  
 
 
When you have finished treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide  
 
After you stop treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan and temozolomide, you will continue to have 
tests and scans done (listed below) to measure how much tumor is left. If test results show you 
have abnormal organ functions, tests will be repeated monthly until test results are stable or 
normal. You doctor will tell you how often these tests and evaluations will be done.  
 
Medical Tests after the Study:  
 
Physical exam   Bone marrow tests  
Blood tests  Various scans  
Urine tests   
 
A table detailing the tests and procedures required before, during, and after the study has been 
attached to the end of this consent.  
 
Determining blood levels of MLN8237 and irinotecan  
 
One of the main research goals of this study is to find out the amount of MLN8237 and irinotecan 
in the blood during this treatment.  Since this is one of the main goals of the study  you are 
required to submit extra blood samples in order to participate in  the overall study.   
 
On the first day of the first cycle of treatment, a small amount of blood ( 5 mL, or about  a 
teaspoon) will be drawn.  If you have a central line (such as a port or a Broviac), this sample can 
be drawn through that line.  Otherwise, y ou will need to have blood drawn through a vein.   
 
On the fourth day of the first cycle of treatment, a total of 36 mL (or a little more than 7 
teaspoons) will be drawn over 24 hours.  This schedule of blood draws is typically done as an 
outpatient.  If y ou have a central line with only one lumen or tube and that lumen or tube is being 
used to give you the irinotecan, then you will need to have at least 6  of these blood samples 
drawn through a vein.  Your study  doctor may recommend placing an IV catheter or tube in one of 
your veins through which the blood can be drawn.  This may reduce the number of pokes needed 
for this part of the study.  If you have a central line with more than one lumen or tube, you may be 
able to have these blood samples drawn throug h one of the lumens or tubes that is not being 
used to give you the irinotecan.  Your study doctor can tell you whether you will need some pokes 
or an IV catheter placed or whether your type of central line can be used to draw these samples.   
 
This amount  of blood is considered safe to donate over this amount of time.  Samples will be sent 
to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Philadelphia, PA and to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, 
MN for testing.  
 
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      76 Other Research Tests in this Study 
You will be asked if you want to participate in optional research tests. This part of the study is 
optional . The results of these tests would not be told to you or your doctor or become part of 
your medical record. These results would also not be used to m ake decisions about your care 
while enrolled on this study. You can decide not to let the doctors do these tests and still be able 
to be treated as part of this clinical study. There are checkboxes on the next to last page of this 
consent form to mark whet her you are willing to participate in these optional  studies.  
 
Evaluating gene changes involved in breakdown and action of MLN8237 and irinotecan  
 
One part of the research goal is to look for genetic changes in normal blood cells of patients to 
see if thes e are related to how the liver handles MLN8237 and irinotecan, or whether you will 
have bad side effects after taking these drugs. We may also look to see if other genetic changes 
impact how likely a person is to respond to this drug combination.  These tes ts are done on one 
sample of blood (one- two teaspoons , 5-10 mL) taken from your central line (or port) at the start of 
the first cycle of therapy.  This amount of blood is considered safe to donate.  The blood will be 
sent to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN  for testing.    
 
Looking at Aurora A in neuroblastoma tumors  
 
MLN8237 blocks the action of a protein called Aurora A.  Another research goal is to look at the 
amount of Aurora A in neuroblastoma tumors to find out if the amount of Aurora A impacts 
wheth er tumors respond to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.  These 
tests are done on stored neuroblastoma tissue from your previous tumor biopsies or surgeries.  If 
you agree to participate in this optional part of the study, we will request that your hospital send 
us some of your stored neuroblastoma tissue.  You will not need to have an extra biopsy or 
surgery to participate in this part of the study.  The tissue will be sent to the University of 
California in San Francisco, CA.   
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE ON THIS STUDY?  
 
You can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not 
having bad side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse.   
 
After you stop treatment, y ou will continue to have tests and scans done to measure how much 
tumor is left. Your doctor will tell you how often these tests will be done. Researchers will continue 
to collect information about you for a lifetime. Researchers will be in contact with your primary care 
doctor to see how you are doing; whether your tumor has grown back and at what sites in the body; 
whether you have developed any side effects from the treatment; or whether you have developed 
any additional cancer. Your oncologist or family  doctor will give the researchers this information at 
regular intervals.  
 
CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY?  
 
Yes. If you are thinking about stopping the study, you should talk to your doctor before making a 
final decision so he/she can tell you how to do this  safely.  
 
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in this study at any time if he/she believes it is in 
your best interest; if you do not follow study rules; or if the study is stopped.  
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
 
You will participate in the Phase 1 part of the study.   A Phase I study looks at how common and 
serious side effects can be for each patient at a specific dose of a drug. In a Phase I study, some 
patients may have very serious side effects and could die as a result of these side effects.  
 
In this study, researchers will be looking at side effects seen in patients taking different doses of 
MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide. Since subjects will be assigned to different 
doses of MLN8237, some  subjects may receive doses that are too small to be effective while 
others may receive higher doses that may cause increased side effects.   
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      77 Everyone taking part in the study will be watched carefully for any side effects. However, doctors 
don’t know all the side effects that may happen. Side effects may be mild or very serious. Other 
drugs may be given to make side effects less serious and mor e comfortable (such as for nausea, 
headache or itching). Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking MLN8237, irinotecan, 
and temozolomide, but it is always possible that side effects can be serious, long lasting or may 
never go away. There is als o a risk of death. Patients are watched carefully and treatment will be 
stopped if bad side effects develop. Because this combination has never been given to children 
before, there may be risks we do not know about. You should talk to your doctor about any  side 
effects that you have while taking part in this study. While on the study, you are at risk for the side 
effects listed on the following pages.  
 
Possible side effects of MLN8237  
There is limited experience using MLN8237 in humans. The risks and side effects listed here and 
their frequencies are anticipated or predicted based on tests in animals and some experience in 
people. It is expected that MLN8237 toxicities will be reversible, however it is possible that 
MLN8237 will have their toxicities that ha ve not been observed in or predicted from its evaluation 
in animal studies and the few studies in adults that have been conducted to date.  
 
The frequency provided in the following table is approximate:  
 
Risks and side effects related to MLN8237 include those which are:  
 
  Likely 
(Anticipated in 21- 100 
children out of every 100)  Less Likely  
(Anticipated in 5 -20 children 
out of every 100)  Rare but Serious  
(Anticipated in <5 children out of 
every 100)  
 
• Fewer red blood cells in 
the blood*  
• Diarrhea  
• Inflammation and/or 
sores in the mouth that 
may make swallowing 
difficult and are painful 
(painful mouth sores)  
• Nausea  
• Vomiting  
• A feeling of extreme 
tiredness not relieved by 
sleep  
• Low numbers of white 
blood cells* called 
lymphocytes and 
neutrophils/granulocytes 
that may make it easier 
to get infections which 
may be life threatening  
• Fewer platelets in the 
blood*  
• Loss of appetite  
• Hair loss  
 
 
 • Fever with a low white blood 
cell count which could 
indicate infection and may 
require hospitalizat ion and 
treatment with antibiotics*  
• Pain in the abdomen (belly) , 
heartburn  
• Constipation  
• Mouth pain  
• Swelling caused by fluid 
build- up in the tissues of the 
arms and legs  
• Fever  
• Infections including those 
caused by bacteria, virus, 
and fungus , which may 
cause you to become very ill.  
• Increase in the blood level of 
certain enzymes or bilirubin 
(a waste product that passes 
through the liver) which 
could indicate liver irritation 
or damage 
• Increased levels of a 
chemical (creatinine) in the 
blood which could mean 
kidney damage 
• Excessive loss of water from 
the body  
• Back pain  
• Dizziness  
• Headache  
• Cough  
• Shortness of breath  
• Low blood pressure  • Severe rash with redness  
and pain of the skin on the 
palms of the hands and

NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      78 • Weakness  
• Rash  
• Trouble walking  
• Changes in mood or 
confusion  
• Sleepiness , over -tiredness  
 
 
* If you have a decrease in the white blood cell count, the cells that fight infection, you may be  
more likely to get an infection, including a serious infec tion that spreads through the bloodstream 
(sepsis). If this happens, you will have to come to the hospital to be treated with antibiotics. If your 
white blood cell count is very low and you get a fever, you may have t o come to the hospital to 
get treated w ith antibiotics.  
 
If you have a drop in the red blood cell count, the cells that carry oxygen around the body you  
may feel tired. If your red blood cell count drops very low you may need a blood transfusion.  
 
If you have a low platelet count, particles in the blood that help with clotting, you may have easy  
bruising or bleeding. If the count is very low and there is bl eeding, you might need platelet 
transfusions to help stop the bleeding.  
 
Transfusions may be accompanied or followed by fever and/or reactions that can cause kidney  
failure, heart failure, anemia, hepatitis, A.I.D.S. (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and other 
infections.  
 
MLN8237 has a chemical structure that is similar to a group of drugs called benzodiazepines. 
These drugs may cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms.  Therefore, there is a theoretical 
risk that MLN8237 could cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms, as well. It is possible that 
while taking this drug, you will feel  changes in your mood such as a sense of euphoria (joy) or  a 
feeling of unhappiness that  could lead to depression and thoughts of hurting yourself. When 
stopping the drug,  withdrawal symptoms could include: anxiety, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, 
tremors,  rapid heart -beat, nausea and vomiting.  
 
Since there i s a possibility that this drug may cause sedation (or sleepiness), you should 
not drink alcoholic beverages, since alcohol can also cause sleepiness. If you feel sleepy 
while you are on this study, you should avoid driving or doing anything that may need 
your full alertness, such as operating dangerous tools or machinery. This drug may also 
cause sleepiness if you are currently taking an opiate such as morphine, dilaudid, or 
fentanyl . 
 
We will tell you if we learn any new information that may affect your health, welfare, or decision to 
stay in this study.  
 
For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.

A New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) treatment protocol.  
 
 
CONSENT FORM FOR PHA SE II PORTION OF STU DY 
 
 
The word “you” used throughout this document refers to you or your child.  
 
 
WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT?  
 
This study is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Clinical trials include only patients who 
choose to take part. Please take your time to make your d ecision about participating. You may 
discuss your decision with your friends, family, and health care team. If you have any questions, 
you may ask your study doctor.  
 
You are invited  to participate in this study because you have been diagnosed with 
neurobl astoma. Your cancer has either grown back (relapsed) or has never gone away 
(persistent tumor) after standard treatment. Standard treatment may have included 
chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy and/or high- dose chemotherapy with a stem cell 
transplant . 
 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
The purposes of this study are: 
 
To continue to look at  the side effects seen by giving MLN8237 with irinotecan, and 
temozolomide.  
 
To determine if your tumor gets smaller after treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan, and 
temozolomide.  
 
To measure the levels of MLN8237 and irinotecan in the blood during this treatment  
 
To determine if specific gene changes  makes you more prone to side effects from and/or 
response to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.  
 
To determine if the amount of something in your tumor called MYCN or Aurora A makes you 
more likely to have a good response to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and 
temozolomide.  
 
To determine if the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomi de delays disease 
progression in patients with relapsed or progressive neuroblastoma.  
 
 
The research is being done because:  
 
Currently there is no known effective treatment for your type of cancer.  
 
This study will combine an oral drug called MLN8237 with two chemotherapy medicines called 
irinotecan and temozolomide.     
 
 
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      92 MLN8237 is an investigational drug that is not approved by the FDA.  MLN8237 blocks the 
function of a protein that is important i n the growth of cancer cells.  This drug has been tested as a 
single- agent in children with relapsed solid tumors, including patients with neuroblastoma.   In the 
laboratory, MLN8237 appears to make neuroblastoma tumors smaller.  This effect is even greater 
when MLN8237 is combined with the chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and temozolomide.   
 
Irinotecan and temozolomide are both FDA -approved chemotherapy dru gs.  These drugs are 
approved for the treatment of certain adult cancers, but have also been used to treat children with 
cancer.  These drugs have been used in combination in many people with neuroblastoma.  In 
some patients with neuroblastoma, this combination reduces the amount of neuroblastoma.   
 
Giving MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide may increase the effectiveness of 
this combination.   In the first part of this study (the “phase 1” part), the side effects and maximum 
dose of MLN8237 pills given in combination with irinotecan and temozolomide were  found.  In this 
“phase 2” part of the study, all patients will start out with the same doses of all three drugs and 
the number of patients who respond to these drugs will be determined.   
 
HOW  MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
22 people joined the first “phase 1” part of the study.  Up to 20 people will take part in this “phase 
2” part of the study .  Another 6- 18 people will take part in a different ongoing part of the study if 
they cannot swallow MLN8237 pills.   
  
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IF I TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
Medical Tests Before You Begin the Study

treatment part of the study. These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and 
may be done even if you do not join the study. These tests will also be done at various times 
throughout the study and at the end of the study. The purpose of these tests is to see how well 
the treatment works and to measure the status of your neuroblastoma. If you have had some of 
them recently, they may not need to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor.  
 
Physical exam   Bone marrow tests# 
Blood tests  Various scans*  
Pregnancy test   
Urine tests   
 
#Bone marrow tests are done by inserting a needle into the hip bone to remove the marrow which 
is inside the bone.  
* Various scans that are done for diagnosis and checking the response of the tumor to treatment. 
These may include CT and /or MRI scans or Bone scans and MIBG or PET scans. We will 
recommend scans specific for your case and we will answer your questions about  these scans

Ir = Irinotecan given into the blood stream on days 1- 5 
T = Temozolomide given by mouth on days 1- 5 
M = MLN8237 given by mouth on days 1- 7  
C = antibiotic to prevent diarrhea given my mouth on days - 1 to +8  
G = filgrastim or pegfilgrastim given as a shot into the skin starting on day 8    
 
 
                                                                   
 
 
 
You will receive irinotecan  into the bloodstream ( either  through your central line or through a 
small  tube placed in a vein in your hand or ar m) over 1 hour on days 1- 5.  This medicine is 
typically given in the clinic.   
 
You will receive temozolomide by mouth once a day on days 1- 5.  The medicine is most 
commonly given as a capsule.  If you have a hard t ime swallowing capsules, the medicine can 
also taken out of the capsule and swallowed with applesauce or apple juice.  This medicine is 
given 1 hour before the irinotecan is given.  This medicine is given on an empty stomach.   
 
You will receive MLN8237 by  mouth once a day on days 1- 7.  The medicine can only be given as 
a tablet.  On days 1- 5, this medicine is given 1 hour before the irinotecan is given.  This medicine 
is given on an empty stomach.   
 
You will receive an oral antibiotic (cefixime or cefpodo xime) by mouth once a day or twice a day 
on days - 1 through day +8.  This antibiotic is given to reduce the chances of getting diarrhea that 
can be seen in patients treated with irinotecan.  
 
You will also receive a drug to boost the white blood cells count  (filgrastim or pegfilgrastim).  This 
drug will be started on day 8 of each cycle of treatment.  Filgrastim is a shot given into the skin 
each day until the white blood cell count increases.  Pegfilgrastim is a long- acting version of 
filgrastim that is giv en as a shot into the skin just once per cycle.  Your study doctor will talk with 
you about which of these drugs you will receive.     
 
When you join the study, y ou will be assigned a certain MLN8237 dose.  This dose will be given 
to all patients entering this part of the study, as it was determined in the first part of the study 
(phase I portion) to be the highest dose of MLN8237 that can be given along with irinotecan and 
temozolomide without bad side effects.   This part of the study is called the Phase I I part of the 
study.    
 
The doses of irinotecan and temozolomide are typical doses used to treat patients with 
neuroblastoma.   
 
You can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not 
having bad side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse.  Although other 
participating patients may have received a different dose of MLN8237, your assigned dose of Disease evaluation after cycles 
2, 4, 8, and then every 4 cycles  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      94 MLN8237 will not change during your participation in this study unless you develop certain side 
effects that necessitate lowering your dose of MLN8237.  
 
When you have finished treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide  
After you stop treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan and temozolomide, you will continue to have 
tests and scans done (listed below) to measure how much tumor is left. If test results show you 
have abnormal organ functions, tests will be repeated monthly until test results are stable or 
normal. You doctor will tell you how often these tests and evaluations will be done.  
 
Medical Tests after the Study:  
 
Physical exam   Bone marrow tests  
Blood tests  Various scans  
Urine tests   
 
A table detailing the tests and procedures required before, during, and after the study has been 
attached to the end of this consent.  
 
Optional Research Studies  
You will be asked if you want to participate in optional research tests. This part of the study is 
optional . The results of these tests would not be told to you or your doctor or become part of 
your medical record. These results would also not be used to m ake decisions about your care 
while enrolled on this study. You can decide not to let the doctors do these tests and still be able 
to be treated as part of this clinical study. There are checkboxes on the next to last page of this 
consent form to mark whet her you are willing to participate in these optional  studies.  
 
Determining blood levels of MLN8237 and irinotecan  
 
One of the research goals of this study is to find out the amount of MLN8237 and irinotecan in the 
blood during this treatment.  Participati ng in this portion of the study is optional for patients in this 
phase II part of the study.   
 
On the first day of the first cycle of treatment, a small amount of blood ( 5 mL, or about  a 
teaspoon) will be drawn.  If you have a central line (such as a port or a Broviac), this sample can 
be drawn through that line.  Otherwise, you will need to have blood drawn through a vein.   
 
On the fourth day of the first cycle of treatment, a total of 36 mL (or a little more than 7 
teaspoons) will be drawn over 24 hours.  This schedule of blood draws is typically done as an 
outpatient.  If you have a central line with only one lumen or tube and that lumen or tube is being 
used to give you the irinotec an, then you will need to have at least 6  of these blood samples 
drawn through a vein.  Your study  doctor may recommend placing an IV catheter or tube in one of 
your veins through which the blood can be drawn.  This may reduce the number of pokes needed 
for this part of the study.  If you have a central line with more than one lumen or tube, you may be 
able to have these blood samples drawn through one of the lumens or tubes that is not being 
used to give you the irinotecan.  Your study doctor can tell you whether you will need some pokes 
or an IV catheter placed or whether your type of central line can be used to draw these samples.   
 
This amount of blood is considered safe to donate over this amount of time.  Samples will be sent 
to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Philadelphia, PA and to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, 
MN for testing.  
 
Evaluating gene changes involved in breakdown and action of MLN8237 and irinotecan  
 
Another  research goal is to look for genetic changes in normal blood cells of patients to see if 
these are related to how the liver handles MLN8237 and irinotecan, or whether you will have bad 
side effects after taking these drugs. We may also look to see if other genetic changes impact 
how likely a person is to respond to this drug combination.  These tests are done on one sample 
of blood (one- two teaspoon s, 5-10 mL) taken from your central line (or port) at the start of the first 
cycle of therapy.  This amount of  blood is considered safe to donate.  The blood will be sent to 
the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN  for testing.    
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      95 Looking at Aurora A in neuroblastoma tumors  
 
MLN8237 blocks the action of a protein called Aurora A.  Another research goal is to look at the 
amount of Aurora A in neuroblastoma tumors to find out if the amount of Aurora A impacts 
whether tumors respond to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.  These 
tests are done on stored neuroblastoma tissue from your previous tumor biops ies or surgeries.  If 
you agree to participate in this optional part of the study, we will request that your hospital send 
us some of your stored neuroblastoma tissue.  You will not need to have an extra biopsy or 
surgery to participate in this part of the study.  The tissue will be sent to the University of 
California in San Francisco, CA.   
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE ON THIS STUDY?  
 
You can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not 
having bad side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse.   
 
After you stop treatment, y ou will continue to have tests and scans done to measure how m uch 
tumor is left. Your doctor will tell you how often these tests will be done. Researchers will continue 
to collect information about you for a lifetime. Researchers will be in contact with your primary care 
doctor to see how you are doing; whether your tumor has grown back and at what sites in the body; 
whether you have developed any side effects from the treatment; or whether you have developed 
any additional cancer. Your oncologist or family doctor will give the researchers this information at 
regular intervals.  
 
CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY?  
 
Yes. If you are thinking about stopping the study, you should talk to your doctor before making a 
final decision so he/she can tell you how to do this safely.  
 
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in t his study at any time if he/she believes it is in 
your best interest; if you do not follow study rules; or if the study is stopped.  
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
 
You may have side effects while on the study. Everyone taking part in the study will be watched 
carefully for any side effects. However, doctors don’t know all the side effects that may happen. 
Side effects may be mild and some patients may have very serio us side effects and could die as 
a result of these side effects.  
 
In the first part of this study, researchers looked at side effects seen in patients taking different 
doses of MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide. T he dose of MLN you will receive 
was based on the experience of the first portion of the study  that has already been shown to be 
tolerated without bad side effects in several children with neuroblastoma.  Your dose will not 
change with later courses of treatment, unless it needs to be decreased due to side effects.  
 
Other drugs may be given to make side effects less serious and more comfortable (such as for 
nausea, headache or itching). Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking MLN8237, 
irinotecan, and temozolomide, but i t is always possible that side effects can be serious, long 
lasting or may never go away. There is also a risk of death. Patients are watched carefully and 
treatment will be stopped if bad side effects develop. Although this combination has been given to 
children in the first part of this study , there may be risks we do not know about. You should talk to 
your doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in this study. While on the 
study, you are at risk for the side effects listed on the following pages.  
 
Possible side effects of MLN8237  
There is limited experience using MLN8237 in humans. The risks and side effects listed here and 
their frequencies are anticipated or predicted based on tests in animals and some experience in 
people. It is expected that MLN8237 toxicities will be reversible, however it is possible that 
MLN8237 will have their toxicities that have not been observed in or predicted from its evaluation 
in animal studies and the few studies in adults that have been conducted to date.  
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      96 The frequency provided in the following table is approximate:  
 
Risks and side effects related to MLN8237 include those which are:  
 
Likely 
(Anticipated in 21- 100 
children out of every 100)  Less Likely  
(Anticipated in 5 -20 children 
out of every 100)  Rare  but Serious  
(Anticipated in <5 children out of 
every 100)  
 
• Fewer red blood cells in 
the blood*  
• Diarrhea  
• Inflammation and/or 
sores in the mouth that 
may make swallowing 
difficult and are painful 
(painful mouth sores)  
• Nausea  
• Vomiting  
• A feeling of extreme 
tiredness not relieved by 
sleep  
• Low numbers of white 
blood cells* called 
lymphocytes and 
neutrophils/ granulocytes 
that may make it easier 
to get infections which 
may be life threatening  
• Fewer platelets in the 
blood*  
• Loss of appetite  
• Hair loss  
 
 
 • Fever with a low white blood 
cell count which could 
indicate infection and may 
require hospitalization and 
treatment with antibiotics*  
• Pain in the abdomen (belly) , 
heartburn  
• Constipation  
• Mouth pain  
• Swelling caused by fluid 
build- up in the tissues of the 
arms and legs  
• Fever  
• Infections including those 
caused by bacteria, virus, 
and fungus , which may 
cause you to become very ill.  
• Increase in the blood level of 
certain enzymes or bilirubin 
(a waste product that passes 
through the liver) which 
could indicate liver irritation 
or damage 
• Increased levels of a 
chemical (creatinine) in the 
blood which could mean 
kidney damage 
• Excessive loss of water from 
the body  
• Back pain  
• Dizziness  
• Headache  
• Cough  
• Shortness of breath  
• Low blood pressure 
• Weakness  
• Rash  
• Trouble walking  
• Changes in mood or 
confusion  
• Sleepiness, overtiredness.  
 • Severe rash with redness 
and pain of the skin on the 
palms of the hands and 
soles of the feet.  
• Blistering of the skin.  
 
 
* If you have a decrease in the white blood cell count, the cells that fight  infection, you may be  
more likely to get an infection, including a serious infection that spreads through the bloodstream 
(sepsis). If this happens, you will have to come to the hospital to be treated with antibiotics. If your 
white blood cell count is ve ry low and you get a fever, you may have t o come to the hospital to 
get treated with antibiotics.  
 
If you have a drop in the red blood cell count, the cells that carry oxygen around the body you  
may feel tired. If your red blood cell count drops very low y ou may need a blood transfusion.  
If you have a low platelet count, particles in the blood that help with clotting, you may have easy  
bruising or bleeding. If the count is very low and there is bl eeding, you might need platelet 
transfusions to help stop the bleeding.  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      97  
Transfusions may be accompanied or followed by fever and/or reactions that can cause kidney  
failure, heart failure, anemia, hepatitis, A.I.D.S. (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and other 
infections.  
 
MLN8237 has a chemical structure that i s similar to a group of drugs called benzodiazepines. 
These drugs may cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms.  Therefore, there is a theoretical 
risk that MLN8237 could cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms, as well. It is possible that 
while taking this drug, you will feel  changes in your mood such as a sense of euphoria (joy) or a 
feeling of unhappiness that  could lead to depression and thoughts of hurting yourself. When 
stopping the drug,  withdrawal symptoms could include: anxiety, restlessness, diff iculty sleeping, 
tremors,  rapid heart -beat, nausea and vomiting.  
 
Since there is a possibility that this drug may cause sedation (or sleepiness), you should  
not drink alcoholic beverages, since alcohol can also cause sleepiness. If you feel sleepy 
while you are on this study, you should avoid driving or doing anything that may n eed 
your full alertness, such as operating dangerous tools o r machinery. This drug may also 
cause sleepiness if you are currently taking an opiate such as morphine, dilaudid, or 
fentanyl.  
 
We will tell you if we learn any new information that may affect your health, welfare, or decision to 
stay in this study.  
 
For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.

1. My name is ____________________________.  
 
2.  You have a kind of cancer called Neuroblastoma  that has either grown back or has never 
gone away after treatment.  We are asking you to take part in a research study because 
doctors want to learn more about treating neuroblastoma using three medicines called 
MLN8237, irinotecan,  and temozolomide  to see what effects (both good and bad) these 
medicines have on patients and their cancer.  MLN8237 is a medicine that is given by mouth 
as a pill (tablet).  Irinotecan is a medicine that is given into the bloodstream (either through 
your central line or through a small tube placed in a vein in your hand or arm).  
Temozolomide is a medicine t hat is given by mouth, usually as a pill (capsule) though it can 
be given a different way if you cannot swallow capsules.  The doctors think that giving these 
three drugs together may help get rid of  neuroblastoma cancer cells.   
 
3.  If you agree to be in this study this is what will happen:  
  
The medicines will be given in cycles that each last s 21 days.  You will only get the 
medicine during the first 7 days of each cycle.  You will continue to receive cycles of this 
treatment for up to 2 years unless you have bad side effects or your tumor gets worse.   
 
  MLN8237:  
 You will take MLN8237 pills by mouth once a day for the first 7 days every 21- day cycle.   
Irinotecan:  
You will take Irinotecan by I.V. once a day for the first 5 days every 21 day cycle.  
Temozolomide:  
You will take Temozolomide by mouth once a day for the fi rst 5 days every 21- day cycle.  
 
Other medicines (not chemotherapy):  
You will need to take other medicines to help you with side effects of the three  
chemotherapy medicines above.  These medicines will include Neupogen (given once a  
day as an injection) or Neulasta (give each cycle as an injection) to help your normal 
blood cells get better after chemotherapy.  To help with diarrhea, you will also take either 
Cefixime (once per day) or  Cefpodoxime (twice each day) by mouth for ten days during 
each cycle of chemotherapy.  
 
Coming to See the Doctors: 
During and after you have finished the treatment, you will have appointments with the 
doctors who are taking care of you. This is called “ Follow -Up”.  This is to see how well the 
treatment has worked so far. The doctors will want to do some special tests to find this 
information out. They will include;  
• Blood tests (we will do this twice each week to start with, and then less often)  
• MRI, CT, Bone and MIBG Scans (special pictures of your tumor)  
• Bone marrow test (to look for tumor in your bone marrow)  
• Feel your belly, look into your eyes and ears, and listen to your heart and lungs.  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      110 • Ask you and your parents a lot of questions about how you are f eeling, how you are 
doing in school, and any problems you might be having.  
• You may have to come to the clinic to have blood and platelet transfusions when the 
blood counts are low or stay in the hospital if you have a fever with low blood counts.  
• You will come to visit your doctor every week or so to start with, then less often if 
everything is going well.  
 
When you are in a research study, sometimes good things and bad things can happen  
 
4. Sometimes things happen to kids in research studies that  may make them feel bad. These are 
called “risks’.  Some of the risks of this study are:  
• You may feel sick to your stomach and you may throw up.   
• You may feel tired.  
• You may have a bad appetite.  
• You might have a fever and maybe an infection where you will  need to be in the 
hospital to get medicines to treat the infection.  You may feel tired and weak and need a 
blood transfusion or you may get bruises or have bleeding (most often a nosebleed) and 
need a platelet transfusion.  
• You may get sores in your mouth that make it difficult to eat and drink.  If this 
happens, you may need some pain medicines and you may need to stay in the hospital.  
• You may get diarrhea.  
• The treatments may not work, and your tumor may grow, or it might come back again 
after the treatment has finished. If this happens we will try other ways to stop the tumor 
from growing.  
• You could get a different kind of cancer, this doesn’t happen often, but can happen 
years later.  
• It is possible that you could die from the treatment or cancer.  
 
Not all of these things may happen to you. None of these things may happen. Or things may 
happen that the doctors don’t know about yet.  
 
We will  do everything possible to keep your information private.  
 
• Things that happen to children in research studies t hat are good are called “benefits.” 
Some of the good things for this research study could be:  this treatment might make your 
neuroblastoma tumor stay the same size or get smaller for some time. We hope to learn 
more about this new treatment which could hel p other children with neuroblastoma.  
 
• Please talk this over with your parents before you decide whether or not to be in this 
study. We will also ask your parents to give their permission for you to take part in this 
study.  But even if your parents say “yes” you can still decide not to do this.   
 
• Being in this study is up to you.   You do not have to be in this study if you don’t want to. 
You may stop being in this study at any time.  
 
• You can ask any questions that you have about the study. If you have a question later 
that you didn’t think of now, you can c all me or ask me next time.  Study doctor’s phone 
number: __________________.

A New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy (NANT) treatment protocol.  
 
 
CONSENT FORM FOR ORA L SOLUTION COHORT  
 
 
 
The word “you” used throughout this document refers to you or your child.  
 
 
WHAT IS THIS STUDY ABOUT?  
 
This study is a clinical trial, a type of research study. Clinical trials include only patients who 
choose to take part. Please take your time to make your decision about participating. You may 
discuss your decision with your friends, family, and health care team. If you have any questions, 
you may ask your study doctor.  
 
You are invited  to participate in this study because you have been diagnosed with 
neuroblastoma. Your cancer has either grown back (relapsed) or has never gone away 
(persistent tumor) after standard treatment. Standard treatment may have included 
chemotherapy, surgery, r adiation therapy and/or high- dose chemotherapy with a stem cell 
transplant.  
 
 
WHY IS THIS STUDY BEING DONE?  
 
The purposes of this study are: 
 
To find the highest doses of MLN8237, that can be given with irinotecan, and temozolomide 
without causing severe s ide effects.  
 
To find out the side effects seen by giving MLN8237 at different dose levels with irinotecan, and 
temozolomide.  
 
To measure the levels of MLN8237 and irinotecan in the blood at different dose levels , based 
upon either a pill form or a liquid form of MLN8237  
 
To determine if your tumor gets smaller after treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan, and 
temozolomide  
 
To determine if specific gene changes  makes you more prone to side effects from and/or 
response to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide  
 
To determine if the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide delays disease 
progression in patients with relapsed or  progressive neuroblastoma 
 
To determine if the amount of something in your tumor called MYCN or Aurora A makes you 
more likely to have a good response to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and 
temozolomide  
 
The research is being done because:  
 
Currently there is no known effective treatment for your type of cancer.  
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      113 This study will combine an oral drug called MLN8237 with two chemotherapy medicines called 
irinotecan and temozolomide.     
 
MLN8237 is an investigational drug that is not approved by the FDA.  MLN8237 blocks the 
function of a protein that is important in the growth of cancer cells.  This drug has been tested as a 
single- agent in children with relapsed solid tumors, including patients with neuroblastoma.   In the 
laboratory, MLN8237 appears to make neuroblastoma tumors smaller.  This effect is even greater 
when MLN8237 is combined with the chemotherapy drugs, irinotecan and temozolomide.   
 
Irinotecan and temozolomide are both FDA -approved chemotherapy drugs.  These drugs are 
approved for the treatment of certain adult cancers, but have also been used to treat children with 
cancer.  These drugs have been used in combination in many people with neuroblastoma.  In 
some patients with neuroblastoma, this combination reduces the amount of neuroblastoma.   
 
Giving MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide ma y increase the effectiveness of 
this combination.  In an earlier part of the study, w e found out the highest dose of MLN8237 pills 
that can be given safely together with irinotecan and temozolomide.  In this part of the study, we 
will look at side effects and blood levels of these drugs when children take MLN8237 in a new 
liquid form.     
 
 
HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
22 people joined the first “phase 1” part of the study.  Up to 20 people will join the “phase 2” part 
of the study using MLN8237 pills.  Between 6 and 18 people will be in this part of the study 
looking at the liquid form of MLN8237.    
 
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO ME IF I TAKE PART IN THIS STUDY?  
 
Medical Tests Before You Begi n the Study  
 
You will need to have the following exams, tests or procedures to find out if you can receive the 
treatment part of the study. These exams, tests or procedures are part of regular cancer care and 
may be done even if you do not join the study. These tests will also be done at various times 
throughout the study and at the end of the study. The purpose of these tests is to see how well 
the treatment works and to measure the status of your neuroblastoma. If you have had some of 
them recently, they may not need to be repeated. This will be up to your study doctor.  
 
Physical exam   Bone marrow tests# 
Blood tests  Various scans*

T = Temozolomide given by mouth on days 1- 5 
M = MLN8237 given by mouth on days 1- 7  
C = antibiotic to prevent diarrhea given my mouth on days - 1 to +8  
G = filgrastim or pegfilgrastim given as a shot into the skin starting on day 8    
 
 
                                                                   
 
 
 
 
You will receive irinotecan into the bloodstream ( either  through your central line or through a 
small tube placed in a vein in your hand or ar m) over 1 hour on days 1- 5.  This medicine is 
typically given in the clinic.   
 
You will receive temozolomide by mouth once a day on days 1- 5.  The medicine is most 
commonly given as a capsule.  If you have a hard time swallowing capsules, the medicine can 
also taken out of the capsule and swallowed with applesauce or apple juice.  This medicine is 
given 1 hour before the irinotecan is given.  This medicine is given on an empty stomach.   
 
You will receive MLN8237 by mouth once a day on days 1- 7.  The medicine will be given as a 
liquid that can be taken by mouth or put into a feeding tube that goes into the stomach.  On days 
1-5, this medicine is given 1 hour before the irinotecan is given.  This medicine is given on an 
empty stomach.   
 
You will receive an oral antibiotic (cefixime or cefpodoxime) by mouth once a day or twice a day 
on days - 1 through day +8.  This antibiotic is given to reduce the chances of getting diarrhea that 
can be seen in patients treated w ith irinotecan.  
 
You will also receive a drug to boost the white blood cells count (filgrastim or pegfilgrastim).  This 
drug will be started on day 8 of each cycle of treatment.  Filgrastim is a shot given into the skin 
each day until the white blood cell count increases.  Pegfilgrastim is a long- acting version of 
filgrastim that is given as a shot into the skin just once per cycle.  Your study doctor will talk with 
you about which of these drugs you will receive.     
 
When you join the study, y ou will be assigned a certain MLN8237 dose.  This study will test up to 
two MLN8237 doses in groups of 3- 6 patients. The starting MLN8237 dose for the first group of 
patients is about 25% lower than the highest dose of MLN8237 pills that can be given safely 
together with irinotecan and temozolomide. This is because studies in adults show that about 
25% more MLN8237 liquid is absorbed compared with MLN8237 pills.  Based on how the first 3- 6 
patients do with the MLN8237 liquid , it is p ossible that more patients are treated with the same 
dose, a higher dose, or a lower dose of MLN8237 liquid.      
 
The doses of irinotecan and temozolomide are not increased during this study.  The doses used 
are typical doses used to treat patients with neuroblastoma.   Disease evaluation after cycles 
2, 4, 8, and then every 4 cycles  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      115  
 
You can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not 
having bad side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse. Although other 
participating patients may receive a different dose of MLN8237, your assigned dose of MLN8237 
will not change during your participation in this study unless you develop certain side effects that 
necessitate lowering your dose of MLN8237.  
 
 
When you have finished treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolo mide  
 
After you stop treatment with MLN8237, irinotecan and temozolomide, you will continue to have 
tests and scans done (listed below) to measure how much tumor is left. If test results show you 
have abnormal organ functions, tests will be repeated monthly until test results are stable or 
normal. You doctor will tell you how often these tests and evaluations will be done.  
 
Medical Tests after the Study:

A table detailing the tests and procedures required before, during, and after the study has been 
attached to the end of this consent.  
 
Determining blood levels of MLN8237 and irinotecan  
 
One of the main research goals of this study is to find out the amount of MLN8237 and irinotecan 
in the blood during this treatment.  Since this is one of the main goals of the study  you are 
required to submit extra blood samples in order to participate in the overall study.   
 
On the first day of the first cycle of treatment, a small amount of  blood ( 5 mL, or about  a 
teaspoon) will be drawn.  If you have a central line (such as a port or a Broviac), this sample can 
be drawn through that line.  Otherwise, you will need to have blood drawn through a vein.   
 
On the fourth day of the first cycle of treatment, a total of 36 mL (or a little more than 7 
teaspoons) will be drawn over 24 hours.  This schedule of blood draws is typically done as an 
outpatient.  If you have a central line with only one lumen or tube and that lumen or tube is being 
used to give you the irinotecan, then you will need to have at least 6  of these blood samples 
drawn through a vein.  Your study  doctor may recommend placing an IV catheter or tube in one of 
your veins through which the blood can be drawn.  This may reduce the num ber of pokes needed 
for this part of the study.  If you have a central line with more than one lumen or tube, you may be 
able to have these blood samples drawn through one of the lumens or tubes that is not being 
used to give you the irinotecan.  Your stud y doctor can tell you whether you will need some pokes 
or an IV catheter placed or whether your type of central line can be used to draw these samples.   
 
This amount of blood is considered safe to donate over this amount of time.  Samples will be sent 
to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in Philadelphia, PA and to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, 
MN for testing.  
 
 
Other Research Tests in this Study 
You will be asked if you want to participate in optional research tests. This part of the study is 
optional . The results of these tests would not be told to you or your doctor or become part of 
your medical record. These results would also not be used to make decisions about your care 
while enrolled on this study. You can decide not to let the doctors do these tests and still be able 
to be treated as part of this clinical study. There are checkboxes on the next to last page of this 
consent form to mark whether you are willing to participate in these optional  studies.  
 
 
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      116 Evaluating gene changes involved i n breakdown and action of MLN8237 and irinotecan  
 
One part of the research goal is to look for genetic changes in normal blood cells of patients to 
see if these are related to how the liver handles MLN8237 and irinotecan, or whether you will 
have bad side effects after taking these drugs. We may also look to see if other genetic changes 
impact how likely a person is to respond to this drug combination.  These tests are done on one 
sample of blood (one- two teaspoons , 5-10 mL) taken from your central line (or port) at the start of 
the first cycle of therapy.  This amount of blood is considered safe to donate.  The blood will be 
sent to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN  for testing.    
 
Looking at Aurora A in neuroblastoma tumors  
 
MLN8237 blocks the action of a protein called Aurora A.  Another research goal is to look at the 
amount of Aurora A in neuroblastoma tumors to find out if the amount of Aurora A impacts 
whether tumors respond to the combination of MLN8237, irinotecan, and temozolomide.  These 
tests are done on stored neuroblastoma tissue from your previous tumor biopsies or surgeries.  If 
you agree to participate in this optional part of the study, we will request that your hospital send 
us some of your stored neuroblastoma tissue.  You will not need to h ave an extra biopsy or 
surgery to participate in this part of the study.  The tissue will be sent to the University of 
California in San Francisco, CA.   
 
HOW LONG WILL I BE ON THIS STUDY?  
 
You can receive up to 34 cycles of treatment (approximately 2 years) as long as you are not 
having bad side effects and as long as your tumor is not getting worse.   
 
After you stop treatment, y ou will continue to have tests and scans done to measure how m uch 
tumor is left. Your doctor will tell you how often these tests will be done. Researchers will continue 
to collect information about you for a lifetime. Researchers will be in contact with your primary care 
doctor to see how you are doing; whether your tumor has grown back and at what sites in the body; 
whether you have developed any side effects from the treatment; or whether you have developed 
any additional cancer. Your oncologist or family doctor will give the researchers this information at 
regular intervals.  
 
CAN I STOP BEING IN THE STUDY?  
 
Yes. If you are thinking about stopping the study, you should talk to your doctor before making a 
final decision so he/she can tell you how to do this safely.  
 
The study doctor may stop you from taking part in t his study at any time if he/she believes it is in 
your best interest; if you do not follow study rules; or if the study is stopped.  
 
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF THE STUDY?  
 
You will participate in the oral solution cohort  part of the study.   This part of the study  looks at 
how common and serious side effects can be for each patient at a specific dose of a drug. Since 
we are still learning about the best dose of MLN8237 liquid to use with the other chemotherapy 
drugs , some patients may have very serious side ef fects and could die as a result of these side 
effects.  
 
In this study, researchers will be looking at side effects seen in patients taking different doses of 
MLN8237 together with irinotecan and temozolomide. Since subjects will be assigned to different 
doses of MLN8237, some subjects may receive doses that are too small to be effective while 
others may receive higher doses that may cause increased side effects.   
 
Everyone taking part in the study will be wa tched carefully for any side effects. However, doctors 
don’t know all the side effects that may happen. Side effects may be mild or very serious. Other 
drugs may be given to make side effects less serious and more comfortable (such as for nausea, 
headache or itching). Many side effects go away soon after you stop taking MLN8237, irinotecan, 
and temozolomide, but it is always possible that side effects can be serious, long lasting or may 
never go away. There is also a risk of death. Patients are watched carefully and treatment will be 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      117 stopped if bad side effects develop. Because MLN8237 liquid has never been given together with 
irinotecan and temozolomide before, there may be risks we do not know about. You should talk to 
your doctor about any side effects that you have while taking part in this study. While on the 
study, you are at risk for the side effects listed on the following pages.  
 
Possible side effects of MLN8237  
There is limited experience using MLN8237 in humans. The risks and side effects listed here and 
their frequencies are anticipated or predicted based on tests in animals and some experience in 
people. It is expected that MLN8237 toxicities will be reversible, however it is possible that 
MLN8237 will have their toxicities that have not been observed in or predicted from its evaluation 
in animal studies and the few studies in adults that have been conducted to date.  
 
The frequency provided in the following table is approximate:  
 
Risks and side effects related to MLN8237 include those which are:  
 
  Likely 
(Anticipated in 21- 100 
children out of every 100)  Less Likely  
(Anticipated in 5 -20 children 
out of every 100)  Rare but Serious  
(Anticipated in <5 children out of 
every 100)  
 
• Fewer red blood cells in 
the blood*  
• Diarrhea  
• Inflammation and/or 
sores in the mouth that 
may make swallowing 
difficult and are painful 
(painful mouth sores)  
• Nausea  
• Vomiting  
• A feeling of extreme 
tiredness not relieved by 
sleep  
• Low numbers of white 
blood cells* called 
lymphocytes and 
neutrophils/granulocytes 
that may make it easier 
to get infections which 
may be life threatening  
• Fewer platelets in the 
blood*  
• Loss of appetite  
• Hair loss  
 
 
 • Fever with a low white blood 
cell count which could 
indicate infection and may 
require hospitalization and 
treatment with antibiotics * 
• Pain in the abdomen (belly) , 
heartburn  
• Constipation  
• Mouth pain  
• Swelling caused by fluid 
build- up in the tissues of the 
arms and legs  
• Fever  
• Infections including those 
caused by bacteria, virus, 
and fungus , which may 
cause you to become very ill.  
• Increase in the blood level of 
certain enzymes or bilirubin 
(a waste product that passes 
through the liver) which 
could indicate liver irritation 
or damage 
• Increased levels of a 
chemical (creatinine) in the 
blood which could mean 
kidney damage 
• Excessive loss of wa ter from 
the body  
• Back pain  
• Dizziness  
• Headache  
• Cough  
• Shortness of breath  
• Low blood pressure 
• Weakness  
• Rash  
• Trouble walking  
• Changes in mood or 
confusion  
• Sleepiness, overtiredness.  • Severe rash with redness 
and pain of the skin on the 
palms of the hands and

• Blistering of the skin.  
 
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      118  
* If you have a decrease in the white blood cell count, the cells that fight infection, you may be  
more likely to get an infection, including a serious infection that spreads through the bloodstream 
(sepsis). If this happens, you will have to come to the hospital to be treated with antibiotics. If your 
white blood cell count is very low and you get a fever, you may have t o come to the hospital to 
get treated with antibiotics.  
 
If you have a drop in the red blood cell count, the cells that carry oxygen around the body you  
may feel tired. If your red blood cell count drops very low you may need a blood transfusion.  
 
If you have a low platelet count, particles in the blood that help with clotting, you may have easy  
bruising or bleeding. If the count is very low and there is bl eeding, you might need platelet 
transfusions to help stop the bleeding.  
 
Transfusions may be accompanied or followed by fever and/or reactions that can cause kidney  
failure, heart failure, anemia, hepatitis, A.I.D.S. (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) and other 
infections.  
 
MLN8237 has a chemical structure that is similar to a group of drugs called benzodiazepines. 
These drugs may cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms.  Therefore, there is a theoretical 
risk that MLN8237 could cause dependence and withdrawal symptoms, as well. It is possible that 
while taking this drug, you will feel changes in your mood such as a sense of euphoria (joy) or a 
feeling of unhappiness that  could lead to depression and thoughts of hurting yourself. When 
stopping the drug,  withdrawal symptoms could include: anxiety, restlessness, difficulty sleeping, 
tremors,  rapid heart -beat, nausea and vomiting.  
 
There is a chance that a chemical in the MLN8237 liquid could lead to a build up of acid in the 
blood.  Since other liquid drugs contain this same chemical and appear safe, we think the risk of 
this happening is low.  We will test to see if this is happening.   
 
Since there is a possibility that this drug may cause sedation (or sleepiness), you should 
not drink alcoholic beverages, since alcohol can also cause sleepiness. If you feel sleepy 
while you are on this study, you should avoid driving or doing anything that may need 
your full alertness, such as operating dangerous tools or machinery. This drug may also 
cause sleepiness if you are currently taking an opiate such as morphine, dilaudid, or 
fentanyl.  
 
We will tell you if we learn any new information that may affect your health, welfare, or decision to 
stay in this study.  
 
For more information about risks and side effects, ask your study doctor.

1. My name i s ____________________________.  
 
2.  You have a kind of cancer called Neuroblastoma  that has either grown back or has never 
gone away after treatment.  We are asking you to take part in a research study because 
doctors want to learn more about treating neuroblastoma using three medicines called 
MLN8237, irinotecan,  and temozolomide  to see what effects (both good and bad) these 
medicines have on patients and their cancer.  MLN8237 is a medicine that is given by mouth 
as a liquid in this part of the study .  Irinotecan is a medicine that is given into the bloodstream 
(either through yo ur central line or through a small tube placed in a vein in your hand or arm).  
Temozolomide is a medicine that is given by mouth, usually as a pill (capsule) though it can 
be given a different way if you cannot swallow the pills .  The doctors think that g iving these 
three drugs together may help get rid of  neuroblastoma cancer cells.   
 
3. If you agree to be in this study this is what will happen:  
  
The medicines will be given in cycles that each last s 21 days.  You will only get the 
medicine during the first  7 days of each cycle.  You will continue to receive cycles of this 
treatment for up to 2 years unless you have bad side effects or your tumor gets worse.   
 
  MLN8237:  
 You will take MLN8237 liquid by mouth once a day for the first 7 days every 21- day cyc le.   
Irinotecan:  
You will take Irinotecan by I.V. once a day for the first 5 days every 21 day cycle.  
Temozolomide:  
You will take Temozolomide by mouth once a day for the fi rst 5 days every 21- day cycle.  
 
Other medicines (not chemotherapy):  
You will need to take other medicines to help you with side effects of the three  
chemotherapy medicines above.  These medicines include Neupogen (given once a  
day as an injection) or Neulasta (give each cycle as an injection) to help your normal  
blood ce lls get better after chemotherapy.  To help with diarrhea, you will also take either 
Cefixime (once per day) or Cefpodoxime (twice each day) by mouth for ten days during 
each cycle of chemotherapy.  
 
Coming to See the Doctors: 
During and after you have fini shed the treatment, you will have appointments with the 
doctors who are taking care of you. This is called “ Follow -Up”.  This is to see how well the 
treatment has worked so far. The doctors will want to do some special tests to find this 
information out. T hey will include;  
• Blood tests (we will do this twice each week to start with, and then less often)  
• MRI, CT, Bone, and MIBG Scans (special pictures of your tumor)  
• Bone marrow test (to look for tumor in your bone marrow)  
• Feel your belly, look into your eyes and ears, and listen to your heart and lungs.  
• Ask you and your parents a lot of questions about how you are feeling, how you are 
doing in school, and any problems you might be having.  
• You may have to come to the clinic to have blood and platelet transfusio ns when the 
blood counts are low or stay in the hospital if you have a fever with low blood counts.  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      132 • You will come to visit your doctor every week or so to start with, then less often if 
everything is going well.  
• To measure the amount of medicine in your b lood, we will draw 9 blood samples (about 
8 teaspoons total) on day 1 and day 4 during the first cycle of your treatment. You may 
need to have a needle poke or a small plastic tube placed in a vein of your hand or arm 
for these samples. If you have a centr al line, your doctor will be able to tell you if that 
can be used to draw these bloods.  
 
When you are in a research study, sometimes good things and bad things can 
happen  
 
4. Sometimes things happen to kids in research studies that may make them feel bad. These 
are called “risks’.  Some of the risks of this study are:  
• You may feel sick to your stomach and you may throw up.   
• You may feel tired.  
• You may have a bad appetite.  
• You might have a fever and maybe an infection where you will need to be in the 
hospit al to get medicines to treat the infection.  You may feel tired and weak and need a 
blood transfusion or you may get bruises or have bleeding (most often a nosebleed) and 
need a platelet transfusion.  
• You may get sores in your mouth that makes it difficult to eat and drink.  If this 
happens, you may need some pain medicines and you may need to stay in the hospital.  
• You may get diarrhea.  
• The treatments may not work, and your tumor may grow, or it might come back again 
after the treatment has finished. If this  happens we will try other ways to stop the tumor 
from growing.  
• You could get a different kind of cancer, this doesn’t happen often, but can happen 
years later.  
• It is possible that you could die from the treatment or cancer.  
 
Not all of these things may happen to you. None of these things may happen. Or things may 
happen that the doctors don’t know about yet.  
 
5. We will do everything possible to keep your information private.  
 
6. Things that happen to children in research studies that are good are called “benefits.” Some 
of the good things for this research study could be:this treatment might make your 
neuroblastoma tumor stay the same size or get smaller for some time. We hope to learn 
more about this new treatment which could help other children with neuroblastoma.  
 
7. Please talk this over with your parents before you decide whet her or not to be in this study. 
We will also ask your parents to give their permission for you to take part in this study.  But 
even if your parents say “yes” you can still decide not to do this.   
 
8. Being in this study is up to you.  You do not have to be in this study if you don’t want  to. You 
may stop being in this study at any time.  
 
9. You can ask any questi ons that you have about the study. If you have a question later that 
you didn’t think of now, you can call me or ask me next time.  Study doctor’s phone number:

NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      139 APPENDIX IV:  FAMILY INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADM INISTRATION OF TEMOZ OLOMIDE  
FOR PATIENTS WHO ARE UNABLE TO SWALLOW CAPSULES  
Temozolomide is an oral cancer medicine that your child will be taking for treat ment of his/her 
neuroblastoma. If y our child is unable to swallow these capsules , you should use the following 
instructions to administer this medication safely.  
• Temozolomide must be kept in a dark container  
• Temozolomide should be taken at the same time everyday  
• If your child requires nausea medicine it should be taken prior to the temozolomide  
• If the dose of temozolomide is vomited later than 10 minutes after administration (which is unusual), do 
not repeat the dose  
• If the person dispensing this medicine is pregnant or suspects she is pregnant, she should not dispense 
this medicine  
Temozolomide is an anti -cancer agent , and so special precautions must be taken when handling this 
medicine. There is potential hazard to anyone who handles this medicine once the protective capsule is 
opened. Since your child is unable to swallow the capsule,  you will be required to open the capsules and 
mix the contents of the capsule in apple sauce or apple juice. This process must be done according to the 
following guidelines to ensure safe administration of this medicine.  
• Find a place that is as free of air flow as possible and is not an area where food is stored or pre pared.  
The work surface should be covered with aluminum foil to reduce exposure to other members of the 
family.  
• Temozolomide can be mixed in apple sauce or apple juice.  
• Place the apple sauce or apple juice in a disposable container.  
• Put on disposable gloves.  
• Open each capsule and place the powder in a medicine cup.  
• Add the whole contents of the medicine cup to either apple sauce or app le juice. The medicine will not 
dissolve completely if mixing in apple juice s o have extra apple juice on hand so you can add it to any 
remaining powder in the bottom of the cup.  
• If you need to use additional juice or apple sauce, remove your gloves before touching the main 
container then place new gloves on before adding the addi tional juice or apple sauce to the medicine.  
(You do not want to contaminate the main container with any powder that may be on your gloves .) 
• Anything that comes into contact with the medicine must be disposable, such as the spoon used for  
mixing or eating the apple sauce.  
• Once all of the medicine is taken throw away the following in the provided red bag: medicine cup, the 
container the medicine was mixed in, the cover for the work surface, gloves and anything else that 
has been in contact with the medic ine. 
 
Once a Five- day cycle of temozolomide is completed bring the red bag with you to the clinic so it 
can be disposed of properly.  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      140 APPENDIX V:  PATIENT INSTRUCTIONS  FOR TREATING DIARRHE A 
 
Be aware of your/your child's bowel movements. At the first sign they become softer than usual or if your 
child has any increase in the number of bowel movements over what is normal for him/her, then you/your 
child should begin taking loperamide (Imodium).  If he/she does not start taking the loperamide right 
away, the diarrhea may become severe and last several days or require hospitalization.  
 
Please follow these directions carefully, using dosing guidelines below:  
 
Take _____________ loperamide at the f irst sign of diarrhea.  
 
Continue taking__________ loperamide every ____ hours until your normal pattern of bowel movements 
returns. Repeat the same doses and frequency if the diarrhea returns.  
 
Do not give more than ___________ of loperamide in a 24 hour  period.  
 
Please call your doctor if you have any questions about taking loperamide, if your child's diarrhea is not 
under control after two days, or if he/she is feeling extremely weak, lightheaded, or dizzy.  
 
Make an extra effort to give your child lot s of fluids (several glasses of pedialyte, fruit juices, soda, soup, 
etc.) while your child is participating in this study.  
 
Side effects may include tiredness, drowsiness, or dizziness. If your child experiences these side effects, 
or if your child is ur inating less frequently than usual, please contact your child's physician.

NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      142 APPENDIX VI I RESPONSE CRITERIA  VERSION 1  
 
These criteria are to be used for patients enrolled prior to Amendment #5.   
 
Response Criteria for CT/MRI Lesions  
 
For CT/MRI lesions, this study will use the definitions of measurable disease from the Response 
Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST)  from the National Cancer Institute. Overall response for 
each patient will be defined as outlined in Section 11.4.  
 
Definition of Measurable (Evaluable) Disease on CT/MRI scan  
The presence of at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with the 
longest diameter at least 20 mm. With spiral CT scan, lesions must be at least 10 mm. The investigator 
will identify up to 10 measurable target lesions to be followed for response.  Note that bone lesions will be 
considered as non- target lesions for evaluation of CT/MRI response since they will be evaluated with 
MIBG scans.  
 
Serial measurements of lesions are to be done with CT or MRI. The same method of assessment used to 
characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline should be used during follow -up. 
 
The sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the disease 
measurement . The response of the CT/MRI lesions will be defined as outlined below:  
 
Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all target and non- target CT/MRI lesions.  
 
Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)  
Greater than 90% decrease of the disease measurement for CT/MRI lesions, taking as reference the 
disease measurement done to confirm measurable disease at study entry. Non -target CT/MRI lesions 
stable to smaller in size.  
 
Partial Response ( PR) 
At least a 30% decrease in the disease measurement for CT/MRI lesions, taking as reference the disease 
measurement done to confirm measurable disease at study entry. Non- target CT/MRI lesions stable to 
smaller in size.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD)  
At leas t a 20% increase in the disease measurement, taking as reference the smallest disease 
measurement since the treatment started, OR a new site of tumor. Non- target CT/MRI lesions stable, 
smaller, or increased in size.  
 
Stable disease (SD)   
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD taking as reference 
the smallest disease measurement since the treatment started. No new sites of disease.  
 
Response Criteria for Morphologic Bone Marrow Disease  
 
Only those p atients with morphologic evidence of neuroblastoma by routine H and E staining (NSE 
staining only is not evaluable) will be evaluable to assess bone marrow response.  
 
Complete Respons e  
Will be defined as no tumor cells detectable by routine morphology on two subsequent bilateral bone 
marrow aspirates and biopsies done at least  three weeks apart after study entry.  
 
Progressive Disease will be defined as:  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      143  
Tumor seen on morphology on two consecutive bone marrows done at least three weeks apart in patients 
who had NO tumor in bone marrow at study entry. (Note:  Patient may be declared as progressive 
disease in bone marrow after only one diagnostic bone marrow at the discretion of the treating physician 
after discussion with the study  chair.)  
 
Patients who enter study with bone marrow tumor by morphology will be considered to have progressive 
disease if there is a minimum of 25% tumor in the marrow by morphology AND  a doubling in the amount 
of tumor in the marrow compared to the level  present at study entry. (For example, a patient entering with 
5% tumor in marrow by morphology must increase to > 25% tumor to have PD; a patient entering with 
30% tumor must increase to > 60% tumor).  
 
Stable Disease  
Will be defined as persistence of an am ount of tumor in the bone marrow by morphology that does not 
meet criteria for either complete response or progressive disease. Patients who clear morphologic tumor 
but have immunocytologic tumor will be called SD.  
 
 
Response Criteria for MIBG Positive Le sions  
 
All patients will be evaluable for MIBG response following the first course of therapy.  Patients with 
persistent MIBG -positive disease after the first course will also be evaluable for MIBG response following 
the second course of therapy.  
 
Definition of MIBG Response 
The following criteria will be used to report MIBG response by the treating institution on the end of course 
report forms:  
a. Complete response = complete resolution of all MIBG positive lesions  
a. Partial response = resolution of at least one MIBG positive lesion, with persistence of other 
MIBG positive lesions.  
b. Stable disease = no change in MIBG scan in number of positive lesions (includes patients 
who have same number of positive lesions but decreased intensity)  
c. Progressive disease  =  Development of new MIBG positive lesions  
 
Assessment of MIBG Response  
The response of MIBG lesions will be assessed on central review using the Curie scale as outlined 
below. [22]  Central review responses will be used to assess efficacy for study endpoint.  
 
NOTE:  This scoring is NOT required to be done by the treating institution for their end of course response 
assessments.  
 
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for osteomedullary lesions, with a 10th general sector 
allocated for any extra- osseous lesions . In each region, the lesions are scored as follows. The absolute 
extension score is graded as:  0 = no site per segment, 1 = 1 site per segment, 2 = more than one site 
per segment, 3 = massive involvement (>50% of the segment). The absolute score is obtained by adding 
the score of all the segments. See diagram of sectors below:  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      144 The relative score is calculated by dividing the absolute score at each time by the corresponding pre-
treatment overall score. The relative score of each patient is calculated at each response assessment 
and classified as below:  
a. Complete response:  all area s of uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved.  
b. Partial response: Relative score > or = 0.1 (lesions almost disappeared) to < or = 0.5 (lesions 
strongly reduced),  
c. Stable disease: Relative score >  0.5 (lesions weakly but significantly reduced) to < or = 1 
(lesions not reduced).  
d. Progressive disease :  New lesions on MIBG scan.  
 
Definition of Overall Response for Each Patient  
 
The International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria were developed to define responses in patients 
being treated with frontline therapy from diagnosis. [23] These criteria were utilized as a basis for the 
following response criteria, which integrate response at all sites defined as measurable in this study, 
including CT/MRI lesions which meet RECIST criteria, MIBG positive lesions, and bone marrow disease. 
These criteria will be used to define the overall res ponse for each patient.  
 
Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all target lesions. No evidence of tumor at any site (chest, abdomen, liver, bone, bone 
marrow, nodes, etc.), and HVA/VMA normal.  
 
Very Good Partial Response (VGPR)  
Greater than 90% decrease of the disease measurement for CT/MRI target lesions, taking as reference 
the disease measurement done to confirm measurable disease in target lesions at study entry; all pre-
existing bone lesions with CR by MIBG; MIBG scan can be SD or CR in soft tissue lesions corresponding 
to lesions on CT/MRI. CR in bone marrow. No new sites of tumor. HVA/VMA normal.  
 
Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in the disease measurement for CT/MRI target lesions, taking as reference the 
disease measurement done to confirm measurable disease in target lesions at study entry. Bone marrow 
with CR. MIBG with either PR/CR in bone lesions; MIBG  may be SD or CR in soft tissue lesions 
corresponding to lesions on CT/MRI. HVA/VMA may still be elevated.  
 
 

   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      145 Progressive Disease (PD)  
Any one of the following:  
a. At least a 20% increase in the disease measurement for CT/MRI target lesions, taking as 
reference the smallest disease measurement recorded since the start of treatment.  
 
b. Appearance of one or more new lesions or new sites of tumor.  
 
c. PD as defined above for either bone marrow or MIBG lesions.  
 
Stable disease (SD)   
The patient will be class ified as stable disease for overall response if there is stable disease by either 
CT/MRI lesion, bone marrow, or MIBG criteria. No new lesions; no new sites of disease.  
 
Mixed response (MR)  
The patient will be classified as mixed response for overall response if there is complete response, partial 
response, and/or very good partial response at a minimum of one site (i.e. CT, MIBG , and/or bone 
marrow), with sta ble disease at all other sites and any value of catechol amines.  
 
The overall response as assessed at any particular time point based on the various disease sites is 
summarized in the table below.

Response Criteria version 1.2 in Section 11.  The following response criteria 1.1 are included in this 
appendix solely for reference.   
 
Overall response will incorporate a ll three parameters: CT/MRI; MIBG (PET is substituted for MIBG non-
avid tumors); and bone marrow response.  Response for each parameter and overall response will be 
reported by the treating site using the criteria below. However, the final statistical anal ysis of response will 
be defined by central review, using the same criteria below.  
 
Response Criteria for CT/MRI Lesions  
 
For CT/MRI lesions, this study will use the definitions of measurable disease from the Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (R ECIST 1.1; European Journal Cancer 45: 228- 247, 2009).  
 
Definition of Measurable (Evaluable) Disease on CT/MRI scan  
The presence of at least one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with a 
longest diameter >10 mm.   In addition,  lesions must be MIBG or PET avid (if patient known to be MIBG 
non-avid), or have a biopsy as required in the eligibility criteria.  Up to 5 measurable target lesions will be 
identified to be followed for response (maximum of 2 in one organ site). Bone les ions will be considered 
non-target lesions for evaluation of CT/MRI response since they will be evaluated with MIBG scans.  Soft 
tissue components of bone lesions will be considered measurable disease if they meet the size definition 
of measurable disease noted above.  
 
Serial measurements of lesions are to be done with the same method of assessment (either CT or MRI) 
used to characterize each lesion reported at baseline.  
 
The sum (sLD ) of the longest diameters for all target lesions will be calculated and reported as the 
disease measurement . The response of the CT/MRI lesions will be defined as outlined below:  
 
Complete Response (CR)  
Disappearance of all target CT/MRI lesions.  Non- target lesions must be stable to smaller in size.  
 
Partial Response (PR)  
At least a 30% decrease in sLD  of CT/MRI lesions, taking as reference the measurement of target lesions 
performed at study enrollment. Non- target CT/MRI lesions must be stable to smaller in size.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD)  
At least a 20% increase in sLD AND a minimum absolute increase of 5 mm in sLD, the disease 
measurement, taking as reference the smallest sLD disease measurement since the treatment started, 
OR a new site of tumor. Non- target CT/MRI lesions can be stable, smaller, or increased in size.  
 
Stable disease (SD)   
Neither s ufficient shrinkage in sLD to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD. No new sites 
of disease.  
 
Not evaluable (NE)  
 CT/MRI scans are of inadequate quality as assessed by central reviewer, or scans are not repeated of all 
sites with tumor documented at entry. (Note that patients not evaluable at a given time point may be 
evaluable for response at later time points if all scans done with adequate quality at later time point.)  
 
 
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      147 Not involved (NI)  
No measurable CT/MRI lesions present at study  entry and scan remains with no measurable CT/MRI 
lesions.  
 
Not done (ND)  
No CT/MRI scans were done at the given time point.  
 
 
Response Criteria for Morphologic Bone Marrow Disease  
 
Routine morphology (with or without routine immunocytochemistry) will be used for baseline evaluation 
and all subsequent response evaluations performed while on protocol therapy, and at end of protocol 
therapy.  Patients with < 10% tumor on all samples of the bilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsies at 
study entry will be evaluable for bone marrow response, but have separate definitions for response 
criteria.  Tumor percentage will be assessed by the surface area percentage of tumor.  
 
Complete Response (CR)  
At least 10% tumor cells seen on any one sample of bilateral aspirates/biopsies performed at study 
enrollment, with no tumor cells seen on bilateral aspirates and biopsies at one subsequent time point.  
 
Complete Response Minimal Residual Disease (CR -MRD)  Less than 10% tumor on all samples of 
bilateral aspirates/biopsies at study enrollment, with no tumor cells seen on  bilateral aspirates and 
biopsies at one subsequent (post protocol therapy) timepoint.  
 
Progressive Disease (PD) 
Patients who enroll on study with an y amount of tumor in the bone marrow on the baseline evaluation will 
be considered to have PD if one subsequent evaluation shows a minimum of 10% tumor in the marrow on 
any one sample AND there is a doubling in the amount of tumor compared t o study entry (baseline). For 
example, a patient entering with 5% tumor in marrow must increase to > 10% tumor to have PD; a patient 
entering with 30% tumor must increase to >60% tumor.  If patients have in increase in tumor amount 
which is less than the amount specified for PD, the response will be classified as SD.  
 
Patients who enter on study with no tumor seen will be considered PD if ONE subsequent evaluation 
shows >10% t umor.  If < 10% tumor is seen on one subsequent evaluation or intermittently, the response 
will be classified as SD.   
 
Stable Disease (SD)  
Will be defined as persistence of an amount of tumor in the bone marrow that does not meet criteria for 
progressive disease or CR or CR Minimal Residual Disease. .  
 
Not Evaluable (NE)  
Patients for whom follow -up bone marrows (including bilateral bone marrow aspirates and biopsies) are of 
inadequate quality as assessed by central reviewer, will be classified as not eval uable.  
 
Not involved (NI)  
Patients with no evidence of neuroblastoma in the bone marrow at baseline and on subsequent 
evaluations.  
 
Not done (ND)  
Bone marrow evaluation not done at a given timepoint.  
 
Response Criteria for MIBG Avid Lesions  
 
MIBG Response will be graded using a modification of the Curie scoring scale ( Eur J Cancer 
1995;31A:256- 261).  The treating site will report the MIBG response using the scoring outlined belo, 
however the statistical endpoint of MIBG response will utilize the MIBG score from the central reviewer.  
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      148  
The body is divided into 9 anatomic sectors for metastatic lesions (including bone and soft tissue lesions), 
with a 10th general sector allocated for residual primary tumor uptake.  The absolute extension score is 
graded as:  0 = no involvement, 1=1 site per segment, 2 = more than one site per segment, 3 = massive 
involvement (>50% of the segment). The absolute score is obtained by adding the score of all the 
segments. See diagram of sectors below:  
The relative score is calculated by dividing the absolute score at each time by the corresponding pre-
treatment overall score. The relative score of each patient is calculated at each response assessment 
and classified as below:  
a. Complete response:  all areas of uptake on MIBG scan completely resolved.  
b. Partial response: Relative score >  0.1 (lesions almost disappeared) to < 0.5 
c. Stable disease: Relative score >  0.5 to < 1.2  
d. Progressive disease :  New lesions on MIBG scan OR a relative score > 1.2. 
e.   Not evaluable:   MIBG scan of inadequate quality as assessed by central reviewer.  
f.  Not involved:  No MIBG avid lesions at study entry and subsequent response time points.  
g. Not done:  MIBG scan not done at a given response time point.  
 
Response Criteria using  FDG -PET scans (for MIBG non -avid patients)  
 
Patients known to be non -avid for MIBG should have FDG -PET scans performed for monitoring response. 
The number of FDG -PET avid lesions will be scored at each time point as the total number of avid lesions 
(ie fo ur lesions = PET score of 4)  
 
Complete response (CR)  
Resolution of all FDG -PET uptake.  
 
Partial response (PR)  
> 50% decrease in the number of FDG -PET avid lesions  
 
Stable disease (SD)  
No change or less than 50% decrease in the number of FDG -PET avid lesions  
 
Progressive disease (PD)  

   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      149 Appearance of new FDG -PET avid lesions. Note: biopsy may be done to exclude causes of FDG -PET 
uptake other than tumor.  If biopsy is negative for tumor, patient will not meet definition of PD  
 
Not evaluable (NE)  
FDG-PET sc an of inadequate quality to evaluate response 
 
Not done (ND)  
FDG-PET scan not done at a given time point.  
 
Urine Catechol amines  
 
Due to variance with diet and concomitant medications, frequently missing dopamine levels, and lack of 
standardized methodology  for this assay, urine catecholamines  will not be utilized in grading 
response,except to confirm an overall response of CR, which will require that urine catecholamines (HVA 
and VMA) are within 3 standard deviations of normal for patient’s age.  Urine catecholamines will still be 
requested at all response evaluation time points and recorded in database.  
 
Definition of Overall Response for Each Patient  
 
The criteria below will be used to define the overall response for each patient, with consideration of all three 
individual response parameters: CT/MRI, MIBG (FDG -PET if MIBG non -avid), and Bone Marrow.  
 
Complete Response (CR)  
CR for all CT /MRI  target lesions with resolution of uptake at all sites on MIBG scan FDG -PET scan if 
tumor is not MIBG avid) .  Bone marrow must be CR or Not Involved.   Urine catechols must be no more 
than 3 standard deviations above normal for age.    
 
Complete Response MRD (CR- MRD ) 
CR or NI for CT/MRI response and MIBG response (FDG -PEG if MIBG non -avid) with  BM response of 
CR-MRD . 
 
Partial Response (PR)  
CT/MRI response of PR. MIBG response must be either PR or CR.    CT/MRI target lesions may still have 
MIBG (FDG -PET if MIBG non- avid) uptake.  Bone marrow response must not be Progressive Disease.  
Bone marrow response may be SD if the maximum amount of tumor was < 10% at study enrollment .  No 
new lesions by CT/MRI, MIBG (FDG -PET if MIBG non -avid).  
 
Progressive Disease (PD)  
Either one of the following will define an overall response of PD:  
a. At least one response parameter including CT/MRI, MIBG, bone marrow and/or FDG -PET 
response is PD as defined above.  If PD is found by one parameter, the other two parameters 
are not required to be evaluated to define an overall response of PD.  
b. Treating physician grades patient as progressive disease based on clinical assessment 
alone.  
 
Stable disease (SD)   
Response of stable diseas e for at least one parameter, with response of SD or not involved for all other 
parameters.  No PD by any parameter.  
 
Minor response (MR)  
Complete response,  Complete- Unconfirmed response, and/or partial respons e for one parameter (i.e. 
CT/MRI, MIBG (FDG -PET if MIBG non- avid), bone marrow), with response of stable disease for second 
parameter and any response other than PD or inevaluable for third parameter.  
 
 
   
NANT 2009- 03 Version Amendment #8 01-10-2018      150 Not evaluable (NE)  
Response of Not evaluable or Not Done for one or more response parameters including CT/MRI, MIBG 
(FDG -PET if MIBG non -avid), or bone marrow, unless one parameter is done and demonstrates PD which 
defines an overall response of PD.  
 
Not done (ND)  
Response was not assessed for any of the 3 parameters at a given time point.  
 
Unconf irmed  
Response of Inevaluable or Not Done for any of the 3 parameters that did not have measurable/evaluable 
tumor at study entry.

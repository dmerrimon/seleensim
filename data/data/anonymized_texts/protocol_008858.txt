(Amendment 3) 09-Apr-2019 1. Up to 3 additional cohorts may be added to 
Part 1 of the study. Cohort 1- 4 will proceed 
with a dose of HM15211 of 0.06 mg/kg body 
weight. 
Based on prediction from PK data for the second 
cohort, geometric mean weekly AUC 0-t will not 
exceed PK exposure limit determined in 
toxicology studies. Therefore, this protocol will 
be amended to enroll up to 3 additional cohorts 
to increase the dose of the study drug in 
increments. The increments will be determined 
at dose escalation meetings, up to a maximum of 
0.12 mg/kg. Cohort 1-4 will proceed with a dose 
of 0.06 mg/kg

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 Summary of 
Study Design  
 The study includes a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multiple -ascending dose study to investigate the safety, 
tolerability, and PK of SC administration of HM15211  in 
approximately up to 72 (n=12/cohort) obese subjects with 
NAFLD .  
To assess the effect of multiple SC doses of HM15211 in obese 
subjects  on: 
1. Change in % liver fat, assessed by MRI- PDFF in obese 
subjects with pre- existing % liver fat >10% (determined by 
MRI-PDFF). 
The study will be conducted in up to 6 dosing cohorts that might 
partially overlap, enrolling 12  subjects per cohort. Subjects will be 
randomized to HM15211  or placebo in a ratio of 3:1 (9 on active, 
3 on placebo). 
Dose e scalation to the next dose will proceed based on safety and 
tolerability and available PK data . After 2- 4 weeks treatments of at 
least 3/4 (n=9) active participating subjects of previous dose, 
safety and available blinded PK/PD data will be reviewed to 
decide on beginning the next cohort. If dose escalation is stopped, 
dose de -escalation may occur in additional cohorts, to further 
refine clinically relevant dose levels . 
Screening:  
A Screening Visit will be performed up to 44 days prior to the first 
dosing to identify subjects for the study.  All screening evaluations 
except MRI -PDFF will be performed.  
Only  eligible subjects will undergo an MRI-PDFF for the 
assessment of liver fat within 30 days of randomization. Subjects 
who meet the inclusion criteria of >10% liver fat will proceed with 
the study and will be invited for the In -house Period 1. 
For subjects in cohort 1-5 and up: Only eligible subjects will 
undergo an MRI/MRI-PDFF for the assessment of liver fat and 
visceral fat within 30 days of randomization. Subjects who meet 
the inclusion criteria of >10% liver fat will proceed with the study 
and will be invited for  the In-house Period 1. 
In-house Period 1: 
Day -2: Subjects will check in to the clinic in the morning on Day 
-2 for a 10-day In- house Period. They will receive standardized 
meals throughout their inpatient stay. Subjects will be connected 
to an ABPM system, and overnight measurements will be taken to

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 familiarize the subjects with the device. ABPM measurements will 
continue throughout Day 5. Only 24- hour monitoring data from 
Day -1 will be used for the baseline monitoring evaluation. 
Day -1: In the morning, subjects will be connected to a Holter 
ECG for 24 -hour measurements and will continue these until Day 
5. Only 24 -hour monitoring data from Day - 1 will be used for the 
baseline monitoring evaluation.  
Subjects will be randomized to a weekly SC injection of 
HM15211 or placebo.  
Day 1:  The active study drug or placebo, will be administered in 
the morning at approximately 08:00 h ours (t=0), SC into the 
abdominal wall  by qualified study staff. Measurements of vital 
signs, sampling for PK at pre-dose and 8 hours after dosing, and 
pre-dose sampling for laboratory parameters including 
incretins/metabolic hormones, lipid profiles and  particles, amino 
acid panel, inflammatory marker, glucose metabolism parameters, 
ketone bodies and evaluations for safety parameters will be 
performed . 
ABPM and Holter ECG monitoring will be continued until the 
morning of Day 5 for the post-dose evaluation. 
Subjects will continue to stay in -house for safety evaluations and 
PK. They will be released from the clinical research unit (CRU) on 
Day 8, after the second dose of the weekly study drug is 
administered. They will return for  multiple outpatient visits. 
Outpatient Visits:  
Subjects  will return to the CRU every week (Days 10, 15, 22, 29, 
36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71)  in order to undergo assessments as 
described  in the SOE. Subjects will receive the injection of the 
study drug in an outpatient fashion to ensure compliance on days 
15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64 and 71 . 
MRI/ MRI-PDFF: Subjects will undergo an MRI/MRI-PDFF 
assessment  during week 8, as close as possible to Day 57, but prior 
to the Day 57 (week 9) Dosing . 
During all outpatient visits, b lood samples for PK analysis, 
exploratory endpoints  and safety assessments as stated in the SOE 
will occur.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 4.0 INTRODUCTION 
4.1 Background 
Excess weight has become an epidemic disease and impairs the health of more than 1.9 
billion adults, of whom 650 million are obese, defined by a. BMI of ≥  30kg/m2. This 
represents about 13% of the world ’s adult population.1 
Obesity impacts many organ systems. One affected system is the cardiovascular system, 
with an increased prevalence of heart failure, hypertension and coronary heart disease. 
Obstructive sleep apnea and asthma are also common in the obese. Non-alcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD), including non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is on the rise 
and may soon become the leading cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma globally. Psychosocial and psychiatric consequences of obesity are also increasing.
2 
Dual agonists have been developed that co-target the glucagon and glucagon like peptide  
(GLP-1) receptors for obesity treatment.3 Additionally, triple agonists, which have added 
a gastric inhibitory polypeptide receptor (GIPR) agonist to the combination, are under 
development in early phase clinical studies. 
HM15211 is a novel long-acting triple incretin agonist. It is a chemical conjugate of a 
chimeric peptide (GLP-1/Glucagon/GIP triple agonist; named TA15211) and human 
immunoglobulin G4 Fc fragment (named HMC001) linked via a bifunctional Maleimide-Polyethylene glycol- Aldehyde (MAL-PEG-ALD) linker molecule.  
TA15211 is produced by chemical synthesis and the quality of TA15211 is controlled by 
complying with in-house specification. The HMC001 moiety was derived from the 
constant region of human immunoglobulin G4 fragment and produced in the transformed 
E. coli as an inclusion body. The inclusion body was purified after successive refolding 
and purification steps, and the quality of HMC001 was controlled by in-house 
specification. Human immunoglobulin G4 Fc fragment (HMC001) was chosen as the 
stabilizing agent because it is the most prevalent blood protein and has an in vivo half-life 
of several weeks without effector functions including antibody dependent cellular toxicity 
(ADCC) and complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). The linker is a 10 kDa 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) with bifunctional reactive groups (maleimide aldehyde 
reactive groups at individual ends, MAL-PEG-ALD). The conjugation of TA15211 and 
HMC001 is carried out through the formation of a thioether and amine bond between 
hetero-bifunctional MAL-PEG-ALD, Cys40 in TA15211, and the N-terminal amino acid in HMC001. 
HM15211 is a long-acting GLP-1/Glucagon/GIP triple agonist with an extended half-life 
through reduced renal clearance and possibly by vascular endothelial recycling via FcRn 
binding. HM15211 showed triple-agonistic properties with potent glucagon activity in addition to balanced GLP-1 and GIP activity.  
According to series of in vivo pharmacologic studies, HM15211 can be an attractive 
treatment option for obese patients based on its potent body weight loss efficacy from

Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 energy intake inhibition and energy expenditure enhancement. Glucagon activity 
provides potent body weight loss primarily from fat mass reduction as shown in efficacy 
studies in diet-induced obesity (DIO) mice. Furthermore, GLP-1/GIP activities negate a 
possible hyperglycemic risk as demonstrated in intra-peritoneal glucose tolerance test (ipGTT) studies in normal and DIO mice.  
Above all, liver preferential distribution, and subsequent hepatic lipid metabolism 
improvement, renders HM15211 a suitable therapeutic option for NASH and hepatic 
fibrosis. Therefore, HM15211 is expected to have favorable therapeutic profiles in both obesity and NASH as well as convenience in its weekly clinical dosing regimen. 
For further informati on please refer to the Investigator’s brochure (IB).  
4.2 Rationale for the Proposed Study 
The aim of this multiple ascending dose study is to investigate safety and tolerability of 
the drug as well as the PK and PD profiles in obese subjects with NAFLD. Up to 6 
cohorts in obese subjects with NAFLD will compare HM15211 to placebo.  
Adverse effects observed in the ongoing single ascending dose study (HM-TRIA-101), 
include so far GI events of nausea and vomiting. The management of any cardiac event, 
dermatitis, cholelithiasis and GI events will follow a specific adverse event management 
plan as provided in section 17.0. 
Based on the pre-clinical data and the conducted single ascending dose study (HM-TRIA-
101), the intended potential target populations will ensure that a robust and relevant set of safety, PK and PD data can be generated. 
4.3 Summary of Pre-Clinical/Clinical Studies 
In vitro activity of HM15211 was evaluated using respective receptors, human GLP-1 
receptor (hGLP-1R), human glucagon receptor (hGlucagonR), and human GIP receptor 
(hGIPR). HM15211 showed dose-dependent activation of all three receptors with potent 
glucagon activity in addition to balanced GLP-1 and GIP activity. Simultaneous 
activation of three incretin receptors could provide synergistic metabolic benefits on body 
weight loss and lipid profile improvement whilst avoiding hyperglycemic risk.  
Further in vitro studies confirmed that since HM15211 includes an aglycosylated Fc 
moiety derived from human IgG4, there are minimal immune-mediated effector 
functions. In addition, due to Fc moiety, HM15211 retained pH-dependent FcRn binding 
property, which is essential for vascular endothelial recycling. 
In vivo pharmacology studies using obese mice showed that HM15211 enables potent 
body weight loss from both food intake inhibition and enhanced energy expenditure. The 
body weight loss was mainly from fat mass reduction, along with lowered serum lipid 
profile. Glucagon action increased energy expenditure and thus enhanced body weight 
loss; hyperglycemic risk by glucagon was effectively buffered by actions of GLP-1/GIP. 
In NASH-induced models, HM15211 effectively reduced hepatic triglycerides (TG), 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 33 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. Furthermore, HM15211-treated animals 
showed significant reduction in NAFLD activity score and hepatic fibrogenic markers, suggesting HM15211 is an effective pharmacotherapy for NASH with hepatic fibrosis. 
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted to evaluate the effects on the 
cardiovascular, respiratory, central nervous systems and in vitro hERG channel assay. No 
significant effect was observed in the safety pharmacology studies and in vitro human 
ether-a go-go related gene (hERG) channel assay.  
In pharmacokinetic studies, HM15211 exhibited a prolonged half-life (t½) after 
subcutaneous (SC) or intravenous (IV) dosing, which ranged from approximately 42.7 to 
85.6 hours in mice, 74.7 to 86.0 hours in rats, and 35.7 to 79.7 hours in dogs, indicating 
that HM15211 is a long acting triple-agonist. HM15211 is preferentially distributed in the 
liver, making HM15211 a favorable treatment option for dysfunction in lipid metabolism 
specifically in the liver. 
The toxicity studies of HM15211, repeat dose toxicity up to 4 weeks in rats and monkeys, 
and in vitro genotoxicity studies, were conducted. Local tolerance of HM15211 was 
investigated in 4-week repeated rat and monkey studies. Additional studies were 
conducted with HMC001 (inactive ingredient) in rat and monkey up to 4 weeks repeat 
dose toxicity studies.  
No target organ was identified during the 4 weeks repeat dose toxicity studies of 
HM15211. All changes were completely or partially reversible during the recovery period.  
The majority of findings were related to fasting effect or pharmacological effect of 
glucagon. No adverse test article-related findings at the injection sites were noted. No 
adverse events were observed in HMC001 studies.  
Treatment emergent adverse events observed in the HM-TRIA-101 study and thought to 
be related to study drug are primarily gastrointestinal, specifically nausea and vomiting.  
Most GI adverse events were mild in severity; no cardiac or drug-related dermatologic 
adverse events have been noted up to this point. 
4.4 Rationale for Starting and Maximum Dose 
Doses up to 0.12 mg/kg were evaluated in the single dose HM-TRIA-101 study. The 
steady state weekly AUC (AUC
168SS) after multiple dosing can be approximated to the 
AUC inf after single dosing.  From the HM-TRIA-101 study, the maximum AUC inf after 
single dosing in the 0.12 mg/kg group was 126,281 ng*h/mL. In the 13 week rat 
toxicology study, the AUC 168 exposure during the 13th week was 297,000 ng*h/mL at the 
rat NOAEL dose of 0.4 mg/kg. At the highest proposed dose in this study, the ratio would 
be (297,000/126,281) = 2.4  
Moreover, clinical issues including skin lesions, gastrointestinal adverse events (nausea 
and vomiting) and an elevation in fasting plasma glucose are known to occur as

clinical signs and symptoms are easily monitored, and are reversible. 
4.5 Dose Escalation Algorithm 
The proposed dose escalation algorithm may include the following steps: 
Table 4-1 Treatment Allocation and Dose Escalation (NAFLD) 
Cohorts Number of Subjects Treatment Period 
Cohort 1 -1 N=9 HM15211 0.01 mg/kg 
N=3 Matching Placebo 
Cohort 1 -2 N=9 HM15211 0.02 mg/kg 
N=3 Matching Placebo 
Cohort 1 -3 N=9 HM15211 0.04 mg/kg 
N=3 Matching Placebo 
Cohort 1 -4 N=9 HM15211 0.06 mg/kg 
N=3 Matching Placebo 
Cohort 1 -5 N=9 HM15211 X mg/kg 
N=3 Matching Placebo 
Cohort 1 -6 N=9 HM15211 0.12 mg/kg 
N=3 Matching Placebo 
 
Additional cohorts may be added if necessary, to provide sufficient data. Proposed doses 
for cohort 1-2 and 1-3 and 1-4 may be adjusted but will not exceed the doses stated in the table. 
Each subject will be randomized to HM 15211 or placebo according to the table above. 
The dose for the weekly dosing in cohort 1-1 will be 0.01 mg/kg, based on the body 
weight measured prior to the first dosing on Day -1. For dose calculation and rounding, 
please refer to the Operations Manual/Pharmacy Manual. 
After at least ¾ (n=9) of the subjects participating in one cohort have completed 2-4 
weeks of treatment (2 weeks of treatment is reached at Visit week 3), an interim data 
review meeting will be held which may include a dose escalation decision. Safety and 
available blinded PK and/or PD data will be reviewed, and predictions based on results 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 35 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 from the previous study and PK/PD data modelling will be used for a dose decision/ dose 
escalation decision for the subsequent cohort. The dose decision will be made by the 
Sponsor, medical monitor and the coordinating Principal Investigator. Dose escalation 
will not exceed a 2-fold increase. If there are no safety concerns, the next cohort may 
start and may partially overlap with the previous one. An additional data review meeting  
may be held at the end of the completed cohort.  The maximum dose for cohort 1-3 will not exceed 0.04 mg/kg. The dose for cohort 1-4 will be 0.06 mg/kg. The maximum dose 
for the study will not exceed 0.12 mg/kg. 
Following the dose escalation decision, the procedures for the subsequent cohorts will be 
identical to those described above. Therefore, all cohorts could be performed in parallel.   
The blind of the study will be maintained throughout. If dose escalation is stopped, dose 
de-escalation may occur for additional cohorts, to further refine the dose. 
Figure 4-1 Dose Escalation Schematic 
 
Optional adjustments 
Optional adjustments to the number of cohorts: If the first 3 cohorts do not provide sufficient data for the dose selection, optional cohorts 
may be added. The optional cohorts may proceed with a higher dose or a lower dose. If 
deemed appropriate, another cohort with the repetition of the same dose may be 
conducted. 
Optional adjustments to the study visits and sampling schedule: 
Depending on the safety and tolerability and/or on available PK/PD results of the first 
cohorts, additional study visits might be performed, or existing visit schedule or PK/PD sampling schedule may be adjusted/rescheduled for following cohorts.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 6.0 STUDY DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION 
6.1 Study Design 
This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose study to investigate 
the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of SC administration of HM15211, conducted in 1 part. 
This study will be single-blind and conducted in up to 6 cohorts comprising a total of up 
to 72 obese subjects with NAFLD. Each cohort will enroll subjects to ensure that at least 
12 subjects per cohort will complete the study. Subjects will be randomized to 
investigational product (IP) or placebo in a 3:1 ratio via an Interactive Web Response 
System (IWRS). Per cohort (n=12 subjects), 9 subjects will be randomized to IP and 3 
subjects to placebo. Cohorts may partially overlap after at least 9 subjects have completed 
2-4 weeks of treatment (2 weeks of treatment is reached at Visit week 3) and a dose 
escalation decision has been made. Study drug will be administered weekly over a period 
of 12 weeks.  
Based on available safety, tolerability, and PK data of each cohort, and following a safety 
review and dose escalation meeting between the investigator and the sponsor, dose 
escalation to the next cohort may proceed. Cohorts will start in sequential order but may 
overlap partially during execution. Replacement of dropouts and withdrawals may take 
place.  
Each subject will undergo a screening visit, 2 in-house/ treatment periods and multiple outpatient visits. A final follow-up visit that will conclude subject study participation. 
The duration of participation in this study including Screening, Treatment and Follow-up 
will be approximately 23 weeks for each subject including 12 weeks of treatment period.

6.2 Study Description 
Each subject will undergo the following procedures during the study: 
Screening Visit: 
Before the screening takes place, potential subjects for the trial will be provided with 
written and oral information about the trial and the procedures involved. Subjects must 
sign the informed consent form (ICF) prior to entering the study. Please see section 9.1.1  
for further details.  
The screening visit will be performed up to 44 days prior to the first dosing day, to 
identify eligible subjects for the study. All assessments performed at the screening visit 
are stated in Table 16-1  and will be recorded in the electronic case report form (eCRF). 
Please see section 9.1.2  and 11.2  for further details.  
Subjects ’ screening lab parameters and VCTE (CAP) scores will be evaluated to identify 
subjects who are likely to have a liver fat content of > 10% at MRI-PDFF. Depending on 
the outcome/results of these values, the subjects will proceed to MRI/MRI-PDFF. For 
further details on parameters and outcome for the determination to proceed to MRI/MRI-
PDFF see the Operations Manual. Subjects who are not able to proceed to MRI-PDFF 
will be recorded as screening failures. 
In-house Period 1:

6.3 Rationale for Study Design and Endpoints  
This MAD study will assess the safety and tolerability, PK and PD of HM15211 in obese 
subjects with NAFLD compared to placebo.  
Cohorts will be assessed in ascending order, but may overlap, to determine a clinically 
appropriate dose for the subjects and will include the comparison with placebo. 
Randomization is used to avoid bias introduced through an association between study 
drug allocation order and subject characteristics. 
A single-blind design has been chosen to avoid bias and to maintain the blind between 
the administration of the study drug and placebo for subjects and clinical staff. 
Obese subjects with NAFLD will participate in the study, as these subjects are an 
important target population for the novel triple agonist. Enrollment criteria will favor the 
target population. Liver fat will be determined by MRI-PDFF and body mass index of ≥ 
30 kg/m2. 
Measurements for the assessment of cardiovascular events will start right after dosing and 
will continue until Day 5. 
The proposed PK endpoints are well-established, commonly used parameters to 
characterize pharmacological profiles of drugs. For the PK endpoints, blood samples for 
determination of HM15211 will be analyzed using a validated assay. 
This is an exploratory study. No formal sample size calculation and no statistical 
hypothesis testing will be performed. 
6.4 Study Discontinuation and Stopping Criteria 
6.4.1 Dose Escalation Criteria 
Dose decision algorithms: 
x The primary tolerability criterion for decision-making will be emesis/vomiting  
(= GI tolerability). 
x As emesis has been shown to be associated with pharmacological doses of GLP-1 agonists and glucagon, the severity of emesis is defined as follows for this study: 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 44 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 o Moderate: 3 to 5 episodes in 24 hours (individual episodes separated by at 
least 5 min) 
o Severe: ≥ 6 episodes in 24 hours (individual episodes separated by at least 
5 min) or requiring iv fluids 
6.4.2 Dose Escalation Stopping Criteria 
Dose escalation will be stopped if one of the following conditions apply: 
x 50% or more of the subjects in the cohort have experienced moderate or severe 
emesis; 
x 25% or more of the subjects in the cohort have experienced severe emesis; 
x Death of a subject in one cohort, at any time, that is considered related to the IP, judged by the Investigator; 
x One (1) or more of the subjects in a cohort have experienced a serious adverse event 
(SAE), that is considered related to the IP, judged by the Investigator, following 
discussion with the medical monitor and breaking the blind; 
x Two (2) or more of the subjects in a cohort have experienced severe or medically 
significant adverse events (eg, common terminology criteria for adverse events [CTCAE] ≥ grade 3 may be used as a grading scale at the discretion of Investigator), 
that is considered related to the IP, judged by the Investigator; 
x Two (2) or more of the subjects in a cohort have experienced moderate adverse events for more than 7 days (eg, common terminology criteria for adverse events [CTCAE] 
≥ grade 2 may be used as a grading scale at the discretion of Investigator), that is 
considered related to the IP, judged by the Investigator; 
x Two (2) or more subjects receiving HM15211 develop similar clinically significant 
laboratory, significant ECG or vital signs abnormalities, or severe AEs in the same organ class, indicating dose-limiting intolerance. Dose escalation may proceed if after 
review of the data by the Investigator and discussion with Sponsor, it is concluded 
that the events are not drug related; 
x It is determined that the limit of safety and/or tolerability has been reached. Decision 
will be made between Sponsor and the Coordinating Investigator. 
x All dose escalation and stopping decisions will be made following a discussion

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 x Violation of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) that compromises the ability to achieve the 
primary study objectives or compromises subject safety. 
x Failure to meet expected enrollment goals 
x Administrative Reasons 
In case that the Sponsor, an institutional review board (IRB)/ independent ethics 
committee (IEC), or regulatory authority elects to terminate or suspend the study or the 
participation of an investigational site, a study-specific procedure for early termination or 
suspension will be provided by the Sponsor; the procedure will be followed by applicable investigational sites during the course of termination or study suspension. 
6.4.4 Criteria for Early Termination of Individual Subjects 
Subjects may withdraw their consent to participate in the study at any time. 
If a subject withdraws consent, the date and reason for consent withdrawal should be 
documented. Subjects will be encouraged to remain in the clinic for safety assessments 
until the Investigator deems that it is safe for the subject to be discharged. Subject data will be included in the analysis up to the date of the consent withdrawal. 
x AE or SAE that requires discontinuation at the discretion of the Investigator 
x Protocol violation: If protocol violation or concurrent illness occurs, which, in the 
clinical judgment of the Investigator or after discussion with the Sponsor, may invalidate the study by interfering pharmacokinetically or pharmacodynamically with 
the investigational products, subject will be withdrawn by the Investigator. 
x Lost to follow-up. The subject did not return to the clinic and attempts to contact the 
subject were unsuccessful. Attempts to contact the subject must be documented. 
x Voluntary withdrawal of consent (mandatory removal from study) 
x Discretion of Investigator (document reason on CRF) 
x Subject becomes pregnant or begins breastfeeding (mandatory) 
x Study discontinuation by Sponsor 
Wherever possible, the tests and evaluations, including those listed for the Follow-up Visit should be performed for all subjects who discontinue prior to the completion of the study. 
In the event the Investigator determines to terminate a subject participation in the Clinical 
Study, the Investigator must notify the Sponsor of such decision and rationale 
immediately in writing. In all cases, the appropriate IRB/IEC and other applicable regulatory authorities shall be informed.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 8.0 STUDY MATERIALS 
8.1 Investigational Products (IPs) 
8.1.1 HM15211 
A sterile solution of HM15211 contained in 0.52 mL pre-filled syringes will be provided. 
The concentration of HM15211 is 10 mg/mL as protein. HM15211 is manufactured by 
Hanmi Pharmaceuticals, Seoul, South Korea.  
8.1.2 Placebo 
Placebo is a sterile, matching solution (all components except drug substance) and free of 
visible particles. Placebo solution will be supplied in 0.52 mL pre-filled syringes by 
Hanmi Pharmaceuticals, Seoul, South Korea. Storage: 2 ℃ to 8 ℃. 
8.2 Packaging, and Labeling of Investigational Products 
The Sponsor or designee will provide the Investigator with the labeled IPs in accordance 
with specific country regulatory requirements. 
The IP will be packaged and shipped to the clinical research unit (CRU) in an open label 
manner. Hanmi will prepare each syringe and place them in an independent paper 
box/carton. 
For details please see the Operations Manual. 
8.3 Storage and Drug Accountability of Investigational Products 
All clinical material will be kept in an appropriate, limited-access, secure location. 
The investigational product, and its storage and preparation instructions, will be provided 
by the Sponsor. The IP must be stored securely at 2 ℃ to 8 ℃ (36 °F to 46 °F) and should 
not be exposed to excessive heat and never be frozen. It should be protected from direct 
sunlight and therefore should be kept in its carton until ready to be used.   
HM15211 is stable at room temperature up to 4 hours. 
The study staff is required to document the receipt, dispensing, and return/destruction of 
Study Drugs and supplies provided by or on behalf of the Sponsor. The CRU will destroy 
all used syringes of HM15211 and placebo at the CRU by the end of the study. Unused 
syringes of HM15211 and placebo will be processed as requested by the Sponsor by the 
end of the study.  
The Investigator or Investigator’s authorized staff must ensure the availability of proper 
storage conditions. The temperature of all study drugs will be monitored over 24 hours a 
day, 7 days a week (24/7). In case of incorrect storage, the Sponsor and monitor must be 
contacted without delay. 
No study drugs may be dispensed to any person not enrolled in the study.  
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 52 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 8.4 Dose Regimen 
The IPs, HM15211 or placebo will be administered after an ≥ 10 h overnight fast, by 
qualified staff while subjects are in the CRU. The products will be administered weekly 
by SC injection into a lifted skin fold of the abdominal wall. The injection needle should 
be placed at a 45° to 90° angle and kept in the skin fold for 5-10 seconds. Aim is to dose 
at approximately the same clock time (eg, at approximately 08:00 h) for all subjects. The 
actual clock time of dosing is defined as t=0. The actual time of each dosing will be 
recorded in the source documents and on the eCRFs.  
Subjects who miss a dose by > 1 day, must be approved by the medical monitor before 
they continue with the study. 
8.5 Overdose 
If a study medication error occurs, it should be documented as Protocol Deviation. A 
brief description should be provided in the deviation, including whether the subject was 
symptomatic (list symptoms) or asymptomatic and whether the event accidental or intentional. 
Dosing details should be captured on the Dosing Case Report Form. If the subject takes a 
dose of IP that exceeds protocol specifications and the subject is symptomatic, then the 
symptom(s) should be documented as an AE and be reported.  
Should an overdose occur, the Investigator or designee should contact the Sponsor or 
designee within 24 hours.  
8.6 Randomization and Blinding 
Subjects who meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria or check-in criteria will be 
assigned a subject randomization number via an Interactive Web Response System 
(IWRS). The system will randomize in a 3:1 ratio to HM15211 or placebo. 
Randomization will continue until a total of up to 72 subjects have completed the study 
(or until 12 subjects per cohort have completed the study). 
If a subject fails to start dosing, or if a subject can’t be randomized, the reason will be 
entered into the screening disposition page. The IWRS must be notified within 2 days that the subject was not randomized. 
In the event of an emergency, e.g. when it becomes necessary for the investigator to 
know which study drug the subject is taking, the subject code can be broken by the 
investigator, preferably after consultation with the medical monitor. Emergency code 
breaks can be performed using the IWRS, see section 8.7.  
As the study is single-blind, subjects and the clinical staff caring for the subjects are 
blinded to treatment. Staff involved in the data management, statistical analyses and staff 
from Pharmaceutical Services who are responsible for preparing the IP, will be 
unblinded. Unblinded staff will not be involved in the subjects’ care.  
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 53 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 After all subjects in one cohort have completed the Follow-up Visit, necessary steps to 
start with the data analysis may be taken. Data may be unblinded and data analysis for the completed cohort may start. 
8.7 Breaking of Blinded Code 
The code for a subject may be broken in a medical emergency, if knowing the identity of 
the treatment allocation would influence the treatment decision of the subject or if 
demanded by the subject. The emergency code break can be performed using the IWRS. 
Whenever a code is broken, the person breaking the code must record the time, date, and 
reason as well as his/her initials in the source documents. During un-blinding procedure 
in case of medical emergency, it should be ensured that no study personnel is unblinded 
to other subjects. Study site personnel and Sponsor personnel directly associated with the 
conduct of the study will not be unblinded. 
If the study site needs to break the code, the sponsor should, if possible, be contacted 
prior to breaking the blind. In all cases, the Trial Monitor must be notified within 24 hours after an emergency unblinding. 
All codes (whether broken or not) must be kept throughout the trial period. 
Accountability of all broken or unbroken codes (hard copy or electronic) will be 
performed at or after trial closure and will be maintained in the Trial Investigator’s File 
(TIF) at the site.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 9.0 STUDY PLAN 
9.1 Study Procedures 
9.1.1 Informed Consent and HIPAA Release 
Written informed consent will be obtained from each subject prior to performing any 
study-specific evaluations. The HIPAA release is embedded in the informed consent 
document. The informed consent document is subject to review and approval by the 
Sponsor and will be approved by a qualified IRB. The IRB-approved document must 
contain, at minimum, the eight basic elements of informed consent set forth in applicable 
law. Only the most recently IRB-approved informed consent document must be used to 
consent prospective study subjects. The Investigator (according to applicable regulatory 
requirements), or a person designated by the Investigator and under the Investigator’s 
responsibility, will fully inform the potential study subject of all pertinent aspects of the 
Clinical Study, including written information given approval/favorable opinion by the 
IRB/IEC.  
 
Prior to the potential subject’s participation in the Clinical Study, the written informed 
consent form must be signed, name filled in and personally dated by the subject and by 
the person who conducted the informed consent discussion, and by the Investigator. One 
copy of the signed and dated informed consent document will be given to the subject and 
the original retained by the Investigator/CRU. 
9.1.2 Screening 
Investigators must account for all subjects who sign informed consent forms. 
Screening number will be provided and will include a 3-digit site number followed by 3-
digit sequential number (i.e. 101 001). 
The Investigator will keep a Subject Screening and Enrollment Log at the investigational 
site. Subjects who have screen failed due to laboratory abnormalities may be allowed to 
re-screen once at the discretion of the Investigator. Subjects who have screen failed due 
to out of window may be rescreened with CRO approval. A new screening number will be assigned. 
If subjects are fasting (only water for ≥10 hours), all screening laboratory assessments 
may be done on the same day. If subjects are not fasting, they will be invited to return for 
a second screening visit to complete any missing screening procedures. 
Subjects screening lab parameter and VCTE (CAP) will be evaluated to identify subjects 
who are likely to have a liver fat content of > 10% at MRI-PDFF. Depending on the 
outcome/results of these values, the subjects will proceed to MRI/MRI-PDFF or not. For 
further details on parameters and outcome for the determination to proceed to MRI-PDFF 
see the Operations Manual. 
Subjects MELD score will be calculated according to the following formula: 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 55 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 MELD(i) = 0.957 × ln(Cr) + 0.378 × ln(bilirubin) + 1.120 × ln(INR) + 0.643  
Then, round to the tenth decimal place and multiply by 10. For further details see the 
Operations Manual. 
Subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are eligible for 
this study and will be invited for the in-house period. Subjects will be instructed on 
influencing factors, such as refraining from strenuous exercise throughout the entire 
course of the study, restrictions on of alcohol and herbal supplements during the study, 
caffeinated drinks, smoking or medication and illness/infection as stated in section 7.4. 
9.1.3 Demographics and Medical History 
Demographic information and medical history, including smoking status, alcohol 
consumption and medication history will be obtained at Screening.  
9.1.4 Physical Examination 
The baseline physical examination will consist of the following body systems: (1) eyes; 
(2) ears, nose, throat, neck, thyroid; (3) cardiovascular system; (4) respiratory system; (5) 
gastrointestinal system, mouth; (6) dermatologic system; (7) extremities; (8) 
musculoskeletal system; (9) central and peripheral nervous system and (10) lymph nodes. 
An abbreviated physical exam (based on symptoms and including examination of 
cardiovascular, respiratory, and gastrointestinal system) will be performed by the 
Investigator (or a qualified physician at the CRU) at time points indicated in the Table 
16-1. A complete physical examination may be performed in case the subjects have 
symptoms or at the discretion of the Investigator. 
9.1.5 Height, Weight, BMI and Waist Circumference  
Height (without shoes) will be measured once, during the Screening visit. 
Weight (without shoes) will be measured fasting in the morning, with light clothing and 
post void at time points indicated in the Table 16-1.  
BMI (kg/m2) will be calculated from height and weight. 
Waist circumference (inches) will be measured at Screening, Day 85 and at Follow-up 
Visit. 
9.1.6 Vital Signs 
Vital signs will include body temperature ( aural or oral ), supine blood pressure (supine 
BP after 5 minutes resting), respiration rate and pulse rate (after 5 minutes resting). The 
method of temperature (aural or oral) should be consistent throughout the study per 
subject from baseline through end of study. Vital sign measurements will be performed at 
days indicated in the Table 16-1. Vital signs measurements will be performed at PK

Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 sampling timepoints (as stated in the PK sampling schedule), and the vital sign should be 
measured before PK sample is collected. 
Body temperature: Assessments will be performed as stated in the Table 16-1. 
Measurements may be taken more frequently, if deemed necessary by the Investigator. 
Measurement on Day -1 will be performed as baseline assessment. Measurements will 
continue throughout the study. Timepoints must not interfere with ABPM measurement 
timepoints. 
Blood pressure: 
Supine assessments will be performed. Measurements will be taken at Screening. 
Measurements on Day -2 and day 77 will be taken prior to connecting the subjects to the 
ABPM. Measurements on Day 4, 5, 81 and 82 will be taken prior to the PK sample. 
Measurements will be performed on the arm that is not connected to the ABPM system. 
Timepoints must not interfere with the ABPM measurements. 
Pulse rate and respiration rate: Assessments will be performed as stated in the Table 16-1 
at timepoints for blood pressure measurements.  
9.1.7 Concomitant Illness and Therapy 
Concomitant therapy is any medication given in addition to the investigational product 
(including over-the-counter medications, herbal medications, and vitamin supplements) administered between screening and follow-up.  
Concomitant illness is any significant medical condition or disease that is present at study 
start (signing of informed consent). This includes clinically significant laboratory, 
electrocardiogram (ECG), or physical examination abnormalities noted at Screening 
examination. 
Details of all concomitant illnesses and therapies must be recorded at study entry and 
must be recorded on the subject’s CRF. Any changes in concomitant medication must be 
recorded at each visit. If the change influences the subject’s eligibility to continue in the 
study, the Sponsor must be informed. The information collected for each concomitant 
medication includes, at a minimum, start date, stop date or continuing, and indication.  
AEs related to administration of these therapies or procedures must also be documented 
on the appropriate CRF. 
9.1.8 Procedures for Clinical Laboratory Samples 
All samples will be collected in accordance with acceptable laboratory procedures. 
Laboratory samples (Table 9-1) will be taken as described in the Schedule of Events.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 The responsible laboratory will perform all necessary laboratory tests listed above. 
Specialty labs may be responsible for specific PD parameter. The results of safety 
laboratory tests will be sent to the appropriate Investigator or designee, who is 
responsible for reviewing these results. All laboratory safety data will be faxed or transferred electronically. 
Laboratory reports must be signed and dated by the Investigator or designee indicating 
that the report has been reviewed and any abnormalities have been assessed for clinical 
significance. 
All clinically significant laboratory abnormalities must be recorded as an AE. A clinically 
significant laboratory abnormality may be verified by retesting and may be followed upon discretion of the Investigator. 
9.1.9 Contraception 
Females must be non-pregnant and non-lactating, and either surgically sterile (eg, tubal 
occlusion, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingectomy, bilateral oophorectomy) or post-
menopausal for >12 months. If females’ sterility or postmenopausal status is confirmed, 
no pregnancy testing is required during the study. The site will make an effort to retrieve medical records to document the sterility, however, the absence of records will not 
exclude the subject. In case that medical records cannot be obtained, serum pregnancy 
testing will be conducted at Screening, and urine pregnancy testing will be conducted 
throughout the study. Postmenopausal status will be confirmed through testing of FSH 
levels outside the normal range (as specified by responsible lab) at screening for 
amenorrheic female subjects < 60 years of age.  
Female subjects who state they are postmenopausal at the screening visit but have an 
FSH value that does not correspond with a postmenopausal FSH level, may have a serum 
hCG pregnancy test performed on a separate day. If screening sample is within stability 
range, the serum hCG pregnancy test may be performed out of the same sample. If test is 
negative and the subject agrees to be on a highly effective contraceptive method, subject 
may be enrolled in the study at the discretion of the Investigator. 
Female subjects of child-bearing potential must use highly effective contraceptive 
methods. Highly effective contraceptive methods are considered those with failure rate 
less than 1% undesired pregnancies per year, including hormonal intrauterine devices 
(coil), oral hormonal contraceptives, sexual abstinence, or a surgically sterilized partner. 
Oral hormonal contraceptives have to be taken at least 2 months prior to Screening  until 
30 days  after the last Follow-up Visit.  
During the course of the study, regular serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 
pregnancy tests will be performed for sterilized women, when medical records are not 
available. In addition to a negative serum hCG pregnancy test at Screening, subjects also 
must have a negative urine hCG pregnancy test at check-in to in-house periods. 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 63 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 Males must be surgically sterile (at least 1-year post vasectomy), abstinent or if engaged 
in sexual relations of child-bearing potential, the subject and his partner must be using an 
acceptable contraceptive method from screening and for a period of 30 days after the last 
Follow-up visit. Acceptable methods of contraception are the use of condoms together 
with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository. In addition, they must be advised not 
to donate sperm during this period. Male subjects must also encourage their female 
partner to use effective contraception. Effective contraceptive for the female partner 
includes surgical sterilization (e.g., bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral salpingectomy, 
bilateral oophorectomy), hormonal contraception, intrauterine contraception/device, or 
barrier methods (female condom, diaphragm, sponge, cervical cap) together with 
spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/ suppository. The adequacy of other methods of 
contraception will be assessed on a case-by-case basis by the Principal Investigator. 
9.1.10  Pregnancy 
In the event a subject becomes pregnant during the study, she should be withdrawn. 
However, the subject will be encouraged to complete the post-treatment follow-up 
portion of the study to the extent that study procedures do not interfere with the pregnancy. 
In addition, any pregnancies in the partner of a male subject during the study or for 60 
days after the last dose should also be recorded.  
If the pregnancy occurs at any time during the study and the 60 days of last dose of active 
study medication, the pregnancy should be reported immediately to the Sponsor, using a 
pregnancy notification form. 
Study subjects will give consent on enrollment that the Investigator will report any 
pregnancy during the study to the Sponsor and that they will be asked to provide 
information about her pregnancy, delivery, and the health of her infant until age one 
month. Payment for all aspects of obstetrical care, child, or related care will be the subject’s responsibility.  
All reported pregnancies will be followed up to final outcome, using the pregnancy and 
pregnancy follow-up forms. The outcome, including any premature termination, will be 
reported to the Sponsor. An evaluation after the birth of the child may also be conducted. 
Pregnancy complications must be recorded as adverse event(s). If the infant has a 
congenital anomaly/birth defect this must be reported and followed up as a serious adverse event. 
9.1.11  ECG Procedure
  
All ECG’s throughout this study will be performed as standard triplicate 12-lead ECG ’s, 
except the ECG at Screening. ECG’s will be recorded after 5 minutes in a supine 
position. Only the Triplicate ECG’s  will be recorded at least 1 minute apart from each 
other, not exceeding a time period of 5 minutes for the completion of all three ECG’s.  
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 64 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 The Investigator (or designee) will interpret the ECG’s by use of an electronic 
measurement using the following categories: within normal limits, abnormal but not 
clinically significant, or abnormal with clinical significance. ECG’s are performed 
according to the Table 16-1. The following parameters will be recorded from the 
subject’s ECG trace: heart rate, QT interval, PR interval, QRS interval, R -R interval, and 
QTcF (corrected) using the Fridericia correction (QTcF = QT ÷ cube root of the R-R 
interval [where R-R is the duration of the entire cardiac cycle]). 
When ECGs are to be collected at the same time point as a blood collection, ECGs should 
be collected first to avoid any artificially increased heart rates due to the blood collection. 
The mean value of the 3 baseline ECG measurements collected at Day -2 will serve as 
each subject’s baseline for all post -dose comparisons. ECG measurements are to be 
collected during screening and on Day -2 and 77 before subjects are connected to the 
ABPM device. Additionally, ECG measurements are taken on Day 5 and Day 82, after 
ambulatory devices (Holter and ABPM) are removed. 
In some cases, it may be appropriate to repeat abnormal ECGs. If a machine-read QTc 
value is prolonged, repeat measurements may not be necessary if the Investigator’s interpretation determines that the QTc value is in the acceptable range. 
9.1.12  Check-in Procedure 
All subjects will check in to the clinic in the morning for the In-house Periods 1 and 2. 
Eligibility will be confirmed, and the following will be assessed: 
1. Positive alcohol breath test. 
2. Positive urine drug screen. 
3. Positive urine pregnancy test for WOCBP.  
4. Any use of prescription or non-prescription medicine other than the allowed 
concomitant medications within the last 12 hours. 
5. Any medical condition that could interfere with glucose metabolism, as judged by the 
Investigator. 
Subjects who fulfill one or more of the stated criteria at check –in, will not be able to 
continue onto the treatment period. The treatment period will be rescheduled. Each 
treatment period may be rescheduled no more than twice. After that, the subject will be 
excluded from the study. Replacement of subjects for the dosing period may be permitted 
to enroll sufficient subjects into the study after discussion with Sponsor and Investigator. 
9.1.13  Standardized Meals 
During in-house period, subjects will receive standardized meals. The standardized 
weight maintaining meals will be provided using estimated BMR× activity factor of 1.5 
to determine daily caloric intake.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 9.1.14  ABPM 
The 24-hour blood pressure will be measured by an ABPM device. A validated, reliable, 
automated, and accurate monitor will be used with a storage function. Blood pressure 
measurements will be started overnight on Day -2 to familiarize the subjects with the 
device. During this period, measurements will be taken every 2 hours until the morning 
of Day -1.  
The baseline assessment period will start in the morning of Day -1 until Day 1. 
Measurements will be taken hourly up to 14 hours and then 2-hourly until 24 hours. 
The post-dose assessment period will start in the morning of Day 1. Measurements will 
be taken hourly up to 14 hours and then 2-hourly until 24 hours every day (for every 24-hour period), until the morning of Day 5.  
Additionally, subjects will be connected to the ABPM system again on Day 77. Blood 
pressure measurements will be started overnight on Day 77 to familiarize the subjects 
with the device. During this period, measurements will be taken every 2 hours until the morning of Day 78.  
The post-dose assessment period will start in the morning of Day 78. Measurements will 
be taken hourly up to 14 hours and then 2-hourly until 24 hours every day (for every 24-
hour period), until the morning of Day 82. 
Time points stated in the Table 16-1 . Adequate cuff size will be documented for each 
subject, after determination of the patient’s non -dominant arm circumference. Subject’s 
bedtime and awakening will be recorded to divide the downloaded data into diurnal and 
nocturnal values. Depending on available PK and safety data, timepoints for 
measurements may be adjusted for the following cohorts. 
Specifications about the ABPM model will be described in the Operations Manual and 
ABPM Procedure Manual, as well as detailed instructions of blood pressure frequency, 
data management and medical review.  
9.1.15  Holter Monitoring 
24-hour heart rate activity will be continuously recorded with an ambulatory Holter 
monitoring system (eg, Mortara surveyor). Holter electrodes (12 lead, 3-channel 
placement) will be placed to the subject’s chest and will be attached to a small recording 
monitor. The Holter monitor will be carried in a pocket or small pouch. Subject’s 
activities or exercises will be recorded while wearing the monitor. 
Specifications about the Holter model will be described in the Operations Manual and 
Holter Procedure Manual, as well as detailed instructions of data management and medical review.

Instructions for sample processing and shipment will be provided in the laboratory 
manual. All samples, including pre-dose sampling on Day 1 will be taken within 30 
minutes before dosing.  
9.1.18  MRI/MRI-PDFF 
Magnetic resonance imaging-derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) deems as a 
noninvasive, quantitative, and accurate measure of liver fat content/ hepatic steatosis 
grade in this study to identify the study population and assess the treatment response in 
subjects with NAFLD. For subjects in cohort 1-5 and up, the assessment of visceral fat 
will also be assessed via MRI imaging at Screening, during week 8 and week 12, together with the MRI-PDFF assessment. 
MRI-PDFF will be performed using a standardized imaging acquisition calibration 
protocol and the results a will be determined by central reader at screening (as baseline 
value) and during week 8 (close to Day 57 as possible, but prior to dosing on Day 57), 
and week 12 (close to Day 85 as possible, but after ABPM and Holter are disconnected 
on Day 82; but prior to the PK sampling on Day 85). 
For details please see the Operations Manual. 
9.1.19  VCTE 
One-dimensional vibration controlled transient elastography (VCTE) assessed via eg, 
FibroScan (EchoSens
™, Paris, France) will be used in this study. 
At Screening, subjects will be examined with the FibroScan to assess the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) in order to qualify for the inclusion in the study. 
For subjects participating in cohort 1-4 and up, FibroScan assessments will be performed 
on Day 85 to assess a change from baseline in CAP and LSM. 
It is a device, that uses non-invasive, one-dimensional vibration controlled transient 
elastography (VCTE). The device generates a low-frequency shear wave from a probe 
applied to the subject’s  skin between the ribs. The speed of the wave spread is then 
measured between two points within the liver to allow the livers stiffness to be 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 69 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 quantified. The wave will travel more rapidly through stiff tissue. An examination using 
the FibroScan consists of ten signal acquisitions at a single point; the whole process lasts 
around 15 minutes. The results are instantly displayed on a screen and the value for 
stiffness can be matched to a fibrosis stage. 
For details please see the Operations Manual. 
9.1.20  Immunogenicity Assessments 
Blood samples will be acquired to determine ADAbs, nAbs and anti -PEG within 30 min 
prior to the first dosing on Day 1, post first dosing on Day 22, 50, 78, 85 and 99. Post 
first dose samples will be taken at the same time point of safety blood sampling or 
collection of other blood samples.  
Instructions for sample processing and shipment will be provided in the 
PK/Immunogenicity Sample and Shipping Instructions.  
9.1.21  Tolerability Assessments 
After injection of the study drug, the injection site will be marked with an indelible 
marker/pen. Assessment of study drug injection site will be performed within 30 minutes 
of pre-dose, at 4 and 12-hour  post-dose on Day 1 with a window of ± 30 minutes. 
Assessment of study drug injections on the other dosing days will be performed at least 
30 minutes post-dose, and then daily during the in-house periods and at outpatient visits 
on non-dosing days in the morning, approximately at the time of the dosing on dosing 
days. Last injection site inspection will be performed on Day 85. 
The local reaction from the injection site will be evaluated quantitatively using a Draize 
scale or similar scale. If an injection site reaction like pain on palpation, itching, 
erythema, edema, induration is observed, it must be recorded as an AE and then will be 
evaluated using the following scale: 
Erythema will be evaluated as follows:    
•  0 – No erythema  
•  1 – Very slight erythema (barely perceptible)  
•  2 – Well-defined erythema  
•  3 – Moderate to severe erythema  
•  4 – Severe erythema (beet redness) to slight eschar formations (injuries in depth)  
Edema will be evaluated as follows:  •  0 – No edema  
•  1 – Very slight edema (barely perceptible)  
•  2 – Slight edema (edges of area well defined by definite raising)  
•  3 – Moderate edema (raised approximately 1 mm)  
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 70 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 •  4 – Severe edema (raised more than 1 mm and extending beyond the area of 
exposure)  
For the irritation assessment, all irritation events will be documented as AEs. The 
diameter of the affected area will be measured with a paper measuring tape in centimeter 
(cm) and the condition of the injection site will be recorded. Digital photography will be 
used to document all positive injection site reactions. In case of clinically significant 
injection site reactions, subjects may undergo a dermatological consultation and/or 
cutaneous biopsies for further histological examination of the injection site reaction. 
Biopsies will be performed using a 4-mm punch biopsy centered on the injection site. 
The biopsy area will be anesthetized with lidocaine prior to the biopsy. Wound closure 
will be performed with Steristrips. If stitches are necessary to close the punch area, they 
will be removed approximately 2 weeks later. The time between injection and biopsy will 
be recorded. Microscopic and histological examination of the punch biopsies will be 
performed at a qualified lab. 
9.1.22  Blood Volume 
Total blood sampling volume for subjects will approximately be 435 mL for subjects 
participating in the study.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 10.0 ADVERSE EVENTS 
10.1 Definitions 
10.1.1  Adverse Event (AE) 
An AE is any undesirable and unintended medical event occurring to a subject in a 
clinical study, whether or not related to the study products. This includes events from the 
first study related activity after the subject has signed the informed consent and until post 
treatment follow-up period as defined in the protocol. The following should not be 
recorded as AEs, if recorded as medical history/concomitant illness on the CRF at screening: 
• Pre-planned procedure, unless the condition for which the procedure was planned 
has worsened from the first study related activity after the subject has signed the 
informed consent 
• Pre-existing conditions found as a result of screening procedures 
• Pre-existing events that has not worsened in intensity or frequency from baseline 
10.1.2  Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) 
A treatment-emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as any clinically significant event not 
present before exposure to study drug or any event already present that worsens in either 
intensity or frequency after exposure to study drug. 
10.1.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) 
AEs of special interest (AESI) are selected, non-serious adverse events. They will be 
reported to the sponsor within the same timeframe that applies to SAE, using SAE report 
form.   
AESIs in this study include the following: 
x Necrolytic migratory erythema 
x Cholelithiasis 
x Pancreatitis 
10.1.4  Clinical Laboratory Event 
A clinical laboratory AE is any clinically significant laboratory abnormality that suggests 
a disease and/or organ toxicity and is of a severity, which requires active management, 
(i.e. change of dose, discontinuation of study product, more frequent follow-up, or diagnostic investigation). 
A laboratory re-test and/or continued monitoring of an abnormal value is not considered 
an intervention. In addition, repeated or additional noninvasive testing for verification, 
evaluation or monitoring of an abnormality is not considered an intervention.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 10.1.5  Adverse Reaction 
An adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event caused by a drug. Adverse reactions 
are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions where there is reason to conclude that the 
drug caused the event. 
10.1.6  Suspected Adverse Reaction 
Suspected adverse reaction is defined as a subset of any adverse event for which there is a 
reasonable possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND 
safety reporting, ‘reasonable possibility’ means there is evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction 
implies a lower degree of certainty about causality than adverse reaction, which means any adverse event caused by a drug. 
Reasonable possibility is given if: 
• A single occurrence of an event that is uncommon and known to be strongly 
associated with drug exposure 
• One or more occurrences of an event, that is not commonly associated with drug 
exposure, but otherwise uncommon in the population exposed to the drug 
• An aggregate analysis of specific events observed in a clinical study that indicates 
those events occur more frequently in the drug treatment group than in a concurrent or 
historical control group. 
10.1.7  Unexpected Adverse Event/ Unexpected Suspected Adverse Reaction 
An unexpected AE/unexpected suspected adverse reaction is an AE or suspected adverse 
reaction that is not listed in the Investigator Brochure, as occurring with a class of drugs 
or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation, or is not listed at the 
specificity or severity that has been observed; or, if an Investigator Brochure is not 
required or available, is not consistent with the risk information described in the general 
investigational plan or elsewhere in the current application. 
10.1.8  Serious Adverse Event (SAE)/ Serious Suspected Adverse Reaction 
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose: 
1. Results in death. 
2. Is life threatening. 
x The term “life threatening” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of 
death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically 
might have caused death if it were more severe. 
3. Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 73 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 4. Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity. 
5. Leads to a congenital anomaly/birth defect. 
6. Is an important medical event that satisfies any of the following: 
x May require intervention to prevent items 1 through 5 above. 
x May expose the subject to danger, even though the event is not immediately life 
threatening or fatal or does not result in hospitalization. 
10.1.9  Life-Threatening Adverse Event/Life-Threatening Suspected Adverse 
Reaction 
A life-threatening AE/life-threatening suspected adverse reaction, in the view of either 
the Investigator or Sponsor, places the patient or suspect at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death. 
The determination of whether an AE is life threatening can be based on the opinion of the 
Investigator or Sponsor. If either, the Sponsor or investigator believes that the event is 
serious or life threatening, the event must be considered serious and evaluated by the 
Sponsor for expedited reporting (21 CFR 312.32(a) and 312.32(c)(1)). 
10.2 Severity of AEs 
The different categories of intensity (severity) are characterized as follows: 
Mild: The event is transient, easily tolerated by the subject and does not 
affect the subject’s daily activities . 
Moderate: The event causes the subject discomfort and interrupts the subject’s 
usual daily activities. 
Severe: The event is incapacitating and causes considerable interference with 
the subject’s usual activities.  
10.3 Relationship to Study Treatment 
The relationship of each AE to the study drug(s) will be assessed by the Investigator or 
Sub-Investigator on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the following definitions: 
1= Related : 
The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the study product administration 
and cannot be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other factors (e.g., 
disease under study, concurrent diseases, or concomitant medications). 
 
The AE follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the investigational product 
administration and represents a known reaction to the drug under study or other drugs in 
its class or is predicted by the known pharmacological properties of the drug. 
 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 74 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 The AE resolves with discontinuation of the investigational product and/or recurs with 
rechallenge, if applicable. 
 
If a relationship to an AE is not assessable, it should be recorded as Related. 
 
2 = Not Related : 
The AE does not follow a reasonable temporal sequence from investigational product 
administration or can be reasonably explained by the subject’s clinical state or other 
factors (e.g., disease under study, concurrent diseases, and concomitant medications). 
10.4 Procedures 
10.4.1  Collection and Recording of AEs 
Collection of all AEs (serious AEs and non-serious AEs) will commence from the time 
the subject signs the informed consent to participate in the study until the post-treatment 
follow-up visit. Throughout the in-house treatment period and outpatient visits, the 
Investigator will assess whether any subjective AEs have occurred. In order to avoid bias 
in eliciting AEs, a non-specific question, such as “How have you been feeling since your 
last visit?” may be asked. Subjects may repo rt AEs occurring at any other time during the 
study. 
All subjects experiencing AEs, whether considered associated with the use of the study 
medication or not, must be monitored and given appropriate medical treatment at the 
discretion and judgement of the Investigator until the symptoms subside and any 
clinically relevant changes in laboratory values have returned to baseline or until there is 
a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed. All AEs will be documented in the 
AE page of the CRF, whether or not the Investigator concludes that the event is related to 
the drug treatment. The event term, start and stop dates, severity, action taken with study 
drug and outcome, will be documented, along with the Investigator ’s opinion of the 
causal relationship between the event and the study drug.  
10.4.2  Collection and Reporting of SAEs and AESIs 
When an SAE and AESI occur, it should be reported according to the following 
procedure: 
An SAE form must be completed immediately or within 24 hours of first onset or 
notification of the event. The information should be completed as fully as possible but 
contain, at a minimum a short description of the event and the reason why the event is 
categorized as serious, subject identification numb er, Investigator’s name, name of the 
study medication and a causality assessment. 
In the interest of subject safety, and in order to fulfill regulatory requirements , all SAEs 
and AESIs (regardless of their relationship to study drug) should be reported to the 
Sponsor or a designated qualified vendor within 24 hours of the Study Center’s first 
knowledge of the  event.  
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 75 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 The collection of SAEs and AESIs will begin after the subject signs the informed consent 
form and stop at the end of the subject’s follow -up period. An Initial Serious Adverse 
Event Form should be completed, and a copy should be faxed to the Sponsor or 
designated qualified vendor. 
All serious and unexpected adverse event reporting will adhere to 21 CFR 312.32 for 
IND drugs and 21 CFR 314.80 for marketed drugs (15-day alerts). The Institutional 
Review Board (IRB) and all Investigators will be notified of the alert reports per FDA 
regulations. 
10.5 Anticipated Adverse Events 
Normal precautions taken for a human study, including the provision of emergency 
equipment, will be taken during this study. Qualified and well-trained physicians and 
medical staff will instruct the subjects.  
In case any drug related AEs occur, they will be managed according to the AE guidance 
document in section 17.0. 
Procedure related AEs: 
The study procedures involve the use of adhesive to secure the placement medical 
equipment. The adhesive may cause an allergic reaction, redness, swelling or itching 
when in contact with the skin. 
Subjects will participate in several blood draws throughout the course of the study which 
have the potential to cause a venous line-vasovagal response, bruising, tenderness, and rarely infection. 
10.6 Follow-up of AEs and SAEs 
All AEs should be followed up and subjects will be rendered appropriate medical care 
and treatment at the discretion of the Investigator until resolution or until the Investigator 
and Sponsor concludes that “further follow -up is not necessary”. If the AE has not 
resolved by the post-treatment follow-up visit, the stop date will be recorded as 
“ongoing.”  
All SAEs and AESIs should be followed up until resolution or permanent outcome of the 
event or until the Investigator and Sponsor judge that further follow-up is not necessary. 
If information is not available at the time of the first report and becomes available later, 
the Investigator should complete a follow-up SAE form at the earliest possible or provide 
other written documentation and fax it immediately within 24 hours of receipt of 
information to the Sponsor or designee. Copies of any relevant data from the hospital 
notes (e.g., ECGs, laboratory tests, discharge summary, postmortem results) should be sent accordingly. 
All other non-serious AEs must be followed until the outcome of the event is 
“recovering” (for chronic conditions), or “recovered” , or until the end of the post-

Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 76 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 treatment follow-up stated in the protocol, whichever comes first, and until all queries 
related to these AE’s have been resolved.  
10.6.1  Safety Reporting to IRBs or IECs, and Regulatory Authorities 
The Sponsor or designated qualified vendor will be responsible for reporting all 
suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) and any other applicable 
SAEs to regulatory authorities, Investigators, and IRBs or IECs, as applicable, in 
accordance with national regulations in the countries where the study is conducted.  
Relative to the first awareness of the event by/or further provision to the Sponsor or 
Sponsor ’s designee, SUSARs will be submitted within 7 days for fatal and life -
threatening events and 15 days for other SUSARs, unless otherwise required by national 
regulations.  
The Sponsor or designated qualified vendor will also prepare an expedited report for 
other safety issues where these might materially alter the current benefit-risk assessment 
of an investigational product or that would be sufficient to consider changes in the 
investigational product administration or in the overall conduct of the study. The 
investigational site will forward a copy of all expedited reports to his or her IRB or IEC 
in accordance with national regulations.  
Reporting responsibilities of Investigator under 21 CFR 312.64(b) and Sponsor under 21 
CFR 312.32(c)(1)(i) for serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions will be 
followed.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 11.0 DATA HANDLING AND MANAGEMENT 
Clinical Data Management (CDM), is the responsibility of ProSciento. With permission 
of the Sponsor, CDM may be delegated under an agreement of transfer of responsibilities 
to a qualified vendor of ProSciento.  
11.1 Data Management 
The full details of procedures for data handling will be documented in the Data 
Management Plan (DMP). 
AEs and medical history will be coded using the current version of the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Concomitant medications will be coded 
using the World Health Organization (WHO) WHODrug Global.  
Unique numbers will identify the subject and the biological material obtained from the 
subject. Appropriate measures such as encryption or deletion will be enforced to protect 
the identity of human subjects in all presentations and publications as required by 
local/regional/national requirements. 
Data from screening failures will be entered into the database. 
Laboratory data from the central laboratory will be electronically transferred to 
ProSciento for database reconciliation purposes. The electronic laboratory data will be 
considered source data. In cases where sensitive non-PK laboratory data is transferred via non-secure electronic networks, data will be encrypted during transfer. 
The laboratory will provide one copy of the laboratory reports to the CRU staff. The staff 
will receive all laboratory data electronically or based on FAX reports directly from the 
laboratory. An Investigator must review, evaluate, sign and date the laboratory print-outs 
upon receipt. The signed print-out of the laboratory reports are source data. 
All other results, including PK, PD data, and laboratory tests will be transferred 
electronically to the responsible Data Management Unit.  
11.2 CRFs (Electronic) 
11.2.1  Clinical Data Management Workflow 
Electronic CRFs will be developed by the CDM department, in collaboration with the 
clinical study team at ProSciento and statistician. CDM will document the process 
workflow in the DMP. After data entry, monitor(s) will source data verify (SDV) the 
eCRFs against the source documents. Queries may be issued to clarify the data entered. 
The PI will electronically sign the eCRFs after all data have been entered, all queries 
have been resolved and all external data has been reconciled with the eCRF data. If 
corrections and/or resolution of queries are required after PI approvals, those eCRFs 
affected by changes will be re-signed by the PI. The database may be locked after the PI 
approvals are completed. 
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd 
Clinical Study Protocol  Confidential Page 78 of 110 
Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 After database lock, CDM study design documentation and locked eCRFs (PDF) will be 
created and will be provided to the Sponsor, if requested. 
11.2.2  Data Entry of eCRFs 
Data required for analyses and subject safety assessments will be entered from source 
documentation into eCRFs. Instructions for data entry will be provided in the eCRF 
Completion Guidelines, developed by the CDM department. All staff involved with 
entering data into the eCRFs will be trained prior to gaining access to the study database. 
11.2.3  Corrections to eCRFs 
Queries may be generated by the eCRF system during data entry, and queries may be 
generated by CDM staff, monitors, and other data reviewers during the course of the 
study. Only specific CRU personnel will be authorized to make corrections to the eCRFs; 
CDM will train personnel prior to granting access in the eCRF system. Corrections will 
be made directly in the eCRF – by modifying existing data, adding new data, or deleting 
data, as appropriate. All data corrections will be logged in the electronic audit trail. 
11.2.4  PI Approval of eCRF Data 
The Investigator or Investigator’s authorized staff must ensure that all information 
derived from source documentation is consistent with the source information and 
accurately reflected in the eCRFs. By electronically signing the eCRFs, the Investigator confirms that the information is complete and correct. 
11.3 Retention of Documents 
At the completion of the study, all records created by and under the supervision of the 
Investigator should be maintained in accordance with the requirements of the regulatory 
authority guideline and the GCP Guideline. These will be available for inspection at any 
time by the Sponsor or the FDA. 
Clinical study documents are archived upon completion of the study and maintained for 
at least 15 years from the study closure or longer in accordance with local regulation and 
applicable regulatory authority guidelines, and the study sponsor will be notified prior to 
destruction of study records. 
Current FDA guidelines require records to be retained for a period of 2 years following 
the date a marketing application is approved for the drug, for the indication for which it is 
being investigated. If no application is filed or if the application for the investigated 
indication is not approved, documents will be kept until 2 years after the investigation is 
discontinued and the FDA is notified. It is the sponsor’s responsibility to inform 
ProSciento as to when essential documents are no longer needed to be retained.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 12.2.1  Analysis Sets 
12.2.1.1  Safety Set 
The Safety analysis set will include all subjects who received study medication (HM 
15211 or Placebo). The Safety analysis set w ill be used for demographic, baseline 
characteristics and safety summaries.  
12.2.1.2  Pharmacokinetic (PK) Analysis Set 
The PK analysis set will include all subjects who received HM 15211 or placebo with 
sufficient evaluable PK data appropriate for the evaluation of interest (without major 
protocol deviations or violations that would have an impact on the absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, or excretion of HM 15211). The PK analysis set will be used 
for analysis of PK endpoints. 
12.2.1.3  Pharmacodynamics (PD) Analysis Set 
The PD analysis set will include all subjects who received HM 15211 or placebo with 
sufficient evaluable PD data appropriate for the evaluation of interest (without major 
protocol deviations or violations that would have an impact on the PD of HM 15211). 
The PD analysis set will be used for analysis of PD endpoints. 
12.2.2  Analysis of Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for all subjects overall and 
by cohort and treatment. Summary statistics (e.g., number of subjects, mean, median, 
standard deviation, and range) will be generated for continuous variables (e.g., age and 
weight) and the number and percentage of subjects within each category will be 
presented for categorical variables (eg, gender, ethnicity, and race).   
12.2.3  Analysis of the Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 
The planned analyses will be described in more detail in the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP). 
The serum pharmacokinetic (PK) concentration profiles will be graphically presented.  
The PK endpoints will be derived from the individual serum HM 15211 profiles during 
the elimination phase using the non-compartmental models. C trough will be derived from 
the pre-dosing PK samples on Day 78. The PK parameters will be summarized by dose.  
12.2.4  Analysis of the Pharmacodynamic Endpoints 
All PD parameters including but not limited to MRI-PDFF will be summarized using 
appropriate descriptive statistics (e.g., n, mean or geometric mean, CV, min, median, 
max) by treatment dose and collection day. The placebo group will be pooled across 
cohorts in the summary tables.   
Hanmi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 Exploratory PD parameters including but not limited to FPG, insulin, C-peptide, GCG, 
leptin, GLP1, GIP, FGF21, Leptin, as well as CRP, lipid profiles and particles, FFA, 
BMI, and body weight, etc. will be summarized by treatment dose. The placebo group 
will be pooled across cohorts in the summary tables. 
12.2.5  Safety Analysis and Endpoints 
Safety and tolerability of the study drugs will be assessed by collection and review of 
adverse events, tolerability, laboratory parameters, physical examination, vital signs, and 
ECG parameters throughout the duration of the study. Immunogenicity of HM15211 will be assessed by the development of ADAbs, nAbs and anti-PEG. 
Safety analysis will involve examination of the descriptive statistics and individual 
subject listings for any effects of study treatment on clinical tolerability and safety. 
Placebo patients will be pooled across cohorts in the safety analysis. 
The 24-hour blood pressure (day and night time systolic/diastolic BP) collected from 
ABPM, and 24-hour Holter ECG (HR, HRV [eg, difference between day and night HR, 
NN intervals, SDNN, SDANN, SDNN index]) will be summarized descriptively by 
treatment dose.  
All AEs will be coded using the most current MedDRA version. AEs will be summarized 
using preferred term and primary system organ class using the safety analysis set by treatment dose.  
Adverse event summaries will include the overall incidence (by system organ class and 
preferred term), events by maximum intensity, event by relationship to study treatment, 
events leading to discontinuation of study drug, and serious adverse events. Physical 
exam, vital signs, blood pressure assessed by ABPM, heart rate assessed by Holter ECG, 
12-lead ECG data, and laboratory parameters (hematology, chemistry, and urinalysis) will be summarized descriptively by treatment. 
12.3 Interim Analysis 
No formal interim analysis is planned. 
12.4 Determination of Sample Size 
Due to the exploratory nature of this study, a sample size of 12 subjects per cohort is 
empirically determined and consistent with typical sample sizes used for similar studies to assess PK and safety data.

13.1 Monitoring 
The study will be monitored by ProSciento’s monitor.  
Monitoring visits to the study sites will be made periodically during the study to ensure 
that all aspects of the protocol and GCP are followed, CRFs are completed correctly, and 
drug accountability is monitored. The Monitor will visit the sites at least once before First 
Subject First Visit (FSFV) (Initiation Visit), at least once during the clinical part of the 
study, and at least once after Last Subject Last Visit (LSLV). Furthermore, the Monitor must be available for discussions by telephone.  
ProSciento may assign additional Clinical Research Associates (CRAs)/Monitors on an 
ad hoc basis for training purposes and to meet required timelines. In addition, if study 
timelines are modified for any reason, e.g., delays in recruitment or accelerated 
enrollment, ProSciento may use additional CRAs at its discretion to ensure study 
expectations are met. 
The Monitor must be given direct access to source documents, such as original 
documents, data, and records. Direct access includes permission to examine, analyze, 
verify any record(s) and report(s) that are important to evaluation of the clinical study. 
The study will be monitored to verify integrity and validity of the data. Monitoring will follow a Monitoring Plan. 
Additional QC monitoring of the clinical study for protocol and GCP compliance will be 
conducted periodically by qualified staff of ProSciento, Inc. 
13.2 Protocol Deviations 
The Investigator should not deviate from the protocol, except where necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects. Should other circumstances arise that 
will require deviation from protocol-specified procedures, unless there is an emergency 
or immediate need, the Investigator should contact the medical monitor and Sponsor to 
review and discuss the implications of the deviation and determine the appropriate course 
of action. Any deviation must be documented, stating the reason and date, the action 
taken, and the impact for the subject and/or the study. The documentation must be kept in 
the Investigator’s Study File and the Sponsor’s Study Master File.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 Grading* Management 
G1: Asymptomatic abnormal cardiac biomarker 
testing, including abnormal ECG  All grades warrant workup and intervention 
given potential for cardiac compromise 
 
Please consider the following:  
• Hold therapy and permanently discontinue 
after G1  
• Management of cardiac symptoms according to 
ACC/AHA guidelines  
• Transfer patient to the emergency room at the 
hospital for further evaluation and management 
for any grade > G1  
• Cardiology consultation  G2: Mild symptoms consistent with 
cardiotoxicity with or without abnormal cardiac 
biomarkers  
G3: Moderate symptoms consistent with 
cardiotoxicity and/or clinically significant 
abnormal cardiac biomarkers 
G4: Moderate to severe decompensation, 
intravenous medication or intervention 
required, life threatening conditions   
Qualifying Statement: Treatment recommendations are based on local standards of care and the 
life- threatening nature of cardiovascular complications. Holding therapy is recommended for 
complication grades greater than G2. The appropriateness of rechallenging remains unknown.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 2. Rash/Inflammatory Dermatitis and Other Skin Disorders 
Definitions:  
x Erythema multiforme major and minor (a targetoid reaction in the skin and mucous 
membranes usually triggered by infections, such as Herpes Simplex Viruses, but can be associated with an immune-related drug eruption and if progresses to EM major, 
it can be a harbinger of SCAR, such as SJS)  
x Lichenoid (resembling the flat-topped, polygonal and sometimes scaly or 
hypertrophic lesions of lichen planus)  
x Eczematous (Inflammatory dermatitis characterized by pruritic, erythematous, scaly or crusted papules or plaques on the skin, which is vulnerable to superinfection) 
x  Psoriasiform (resembling the well-demarcated, erythematous and scaly papules and plaques of psoriasis)  
x Morbilliform (a non-pustular, non-bullous measles-like exanthematous rash of the 
skin often referred to as “maculopapular” and without systemic symptoms or lab 
abnormalities, excluding occasional isolated peripheral eosinophilia  
x Palmoplantar erythrodysaesthesia (PPE) (hand-foot syndrome) (redness, 
numbness/burning/itching and superficial desquamation of the palms and soles)  
x Neutrophilic dermatoses (e.g. sweet’s syndrome)  
x Others 
 
Diagnostic Workup for Skin Disorders above and Others Considered to be Possibly 
IP-related: 
• Pertinent history and physical exam 
• Rule out any other etiology of the skin problem, such as an infection, an effect of 
another drug or a skin condition linked to another systemic disease or unrelated primary 
skin disorder 
• If needed, a biological checkup including a blood cell count, liver and kidney tests 
• Directed serologic studies if an autoimmune condition is suspected, such as lupus or 
dermatomyositis: a screening antinuclear antibody test, SSA/Anti-Ro, SS-B/Anti-La if 
predominantly photodistributed/photosensitivity, anti-histone, ds-DNA and other 
relevant serologies. Consider expanding serologic studies or diagnostic work up if other 
autoimmune conditions are considered based on signs, symptoms. 
• Dermatology consultation with skin biopsy 
• Consider clinical monitoring with use of serial clinical photography, if IRB approved 
and subject has consented

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 • Review full list of patient medications to rule out other drug-induced cause for 
photosensitivity 
Grading 
Grading according to CTCAE criteri a is a 
challenge for skin. Instead, severity may be 
based on BSA, tolerability, morbidity, and 
duration.  Management 
G1: Symptoms do not affect the quality of life 
or controlled with topical regimen and/or oral 
antipruritic  • Consider continuing therapy for mild localized 
reaction, e.g., injection site erythema  
• Consider treatment with topical emollients 
and/or mild -moderate potency topical 
corticosteroids  
• Counsel patients to avoid skin irritants and sun 
exposure  
G2: Inflammatory reaction that affects quality 
of life and requires intervention based on 
diagnosis.  • Dermatology consultation with possible biopsy 
• Consider holding therapy and monitor weekly 
for improvement. If not resolved, interrupt 
treatment until skin AE has reverted to grade 1 
• Consider initiating prednisone (or equivalent) at
 
dosing 1 mg/kg tapering over at 4 weeks  
In addition, treat with topical emollients, oral 
antihistamines and medium -to-high potency 
topical  
corticosteroids  
G3: As grade 2 but with failure to respond to 
indicated interventions for a grade 2 dermatitis.  • Hold therapy and consult with dermatology to 
determine appropriateness of resuming  
• Treat with topical emollients, oral 
antihistamines and high potency topical corticosteroids
 
• Initiate oral prednisone or equ ivalent  
(0.5-1 mg/kg/day) tapering over at least 4 weeks

Protocol No. HM-TRIA- 102 
 
Version 5.0_02Jul2019 G4: All severe rashes not manageable with prior 
intervention  • Immediate hold therapy and consult 
dermatology to determine appropriateness of resuming therapy upon resolution of skin 
toxicity and once corticosteroids are reduced to 
prednisone (or equivalent) 10mg or less.
 
• Systemic steroids: IV (methyl)prednisolone (or 
equivalent) dosed at 1 –2mg/kg with slow 
tapering when the toxicity resolves  
• Monitor closely for progression to Severe 
Cutaneous Adve rse Reaction 
• Should admit patient immediately with an 
urgent  
consult by dermatology

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 3. Gallstones (Cholelithiasis), Biliary Cholic or Cholecystitis 
Definition: 
Asymptomatic gallstones/ asymptomatic common bile duct stones: Stones that are found 
incidentally, as a result of imaging investigations unrelated to gallstone disease in people 
who have been completely symptom free for at least 12 months before diagnosis. 
Symptomatic gallstones/ symptomatic common bile duct stones: Stones found on 
gallbladder imaging, regardless of whether symptoms are being experienced currently or 
whether they occurred sometime in the 12 months before diagnosis. 
When should symptomatic gallbladder stones be suspected? 
The characteristic symptoms of gallbladder stones, i.e. episodic attacks of severe pain in 
the right upper abdominal quadrant or epigastrium for at least 15-30 minutes with 
radiation to the right back or shoulder and a positive reaction to analgesics, should be 
identified by medical history and physical examination 
 
• Diagnostic Workup for Symptoms Suggestive of Gallstone-related Disorders: 
• Liver function tests and ultrasound for suspected gallstone disease, and for individuals 
with abdominal or gastrointestinal symptoms that have been unresponsive to previous management. 
• Consider magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) if ultrasound has not detected common bile duct stones but the: 
✓ bile duct is dilated and/or 
✓ liver function test results are abnormal. 
• Consider endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) if MRCP does not allow a diagnosis to be made. 
• Consider holding therapy and consulting gastroenterology. 
• Refer people for further investigations if conditions other than gallstone disease are suspected.

Version 5.0_02Jul2019 4. Gastrointestinal Events 
Definition: Nausea and vomiting are anticipated adverse events with this protocol.  
The initial assessment needs to include consideration of other differentials including 
pancreatitis and cholelithiasis.  Laboratory assessments of amylase, lipase and liver 
function tests (ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin) or imaging (ultrasound, CT or MRI) should be considered and pursued if indicated.  
 
Severity of symptoms should be assessed as following: 
Grading 
(Not associated with CTCAE grading system) Management 
G1: Mild symptoms that do not interfere with 
quality of life  • No intervention 
G2: Mild to moderate symptoms that may need 
intervention based on Investigator.  • Patient observation 
• Consider initiating antiemetic medication  
G3: Moderate to severe symptoms that need 
medical intervention.  
 
 
 • Hold therapy; resume therapy only if 
symptoms are fully resolved  
• Treat with antiemetic medication as indicated 
• Treat with IV fluid  
• Treat with parenteral nutrition if no oral intake 
sustained beyond 7 days  
G4: Life-threatening symptoms  • Immediately discontinue therapy  
• Systemic IV fluids  
• Treat with antiemetic medication as indicated 
• Treat with parenteral nutrition  
• Should admit patient immediately with an 
urgent  consult

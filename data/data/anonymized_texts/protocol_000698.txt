 3.0 OBJECTIVE(S) & HYPOTHESIS(ES)  
3.1 Primary Objectives & Hypothesis 
Objectives:   
(1) To investigate the feasibility (safety and tolerability)  of the addition of anti- PD1 after high 
dose therapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant in patients with multiple 
myeloma.  
(2)  To investigate the efficacy of the addition of anti -PD1 after high dose therapy and 
autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant in improving  complete response (CR) conversion 
rate for patients with multiple myeloma 
Hypothesis:   The administration of anti -PD-1 during the lymphopenic  state after  high dose 
therapy and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant is safe and tolerable and will enhance 
recognition and eradication of multiple myeloma by the recovering immune system and will result 
in a higher CR  conversion rate.  
 See Appendix 13.3 for the definition of complete response (CR).  
 
3.2 Secondary Objective & Hypothesis 
 
Objective:   
To investigate the efficacy of this strategy in impr oving other transplant outcomes especially 2-
year progression- free and overall survival  (PFS and OS) . 
 
Hypothesis:  The intervention increases other transplant outcomes especially 2-year PFS among 
patients achieving CR by day 180.  
 
See Section 5.10 for the  definition of PFS and OS.  
 
3.3 Exploratory Objectives 
(1) To perform correlative studies of the effect s of anti -PD-1 on T -cell and NK -cell function.   
Hypothesis:  Enhanced Th1- type and cytotoxic immune responses following anti -PD-1 
treatment will correlate with prolonged remission, while relapse will correlate with reduced Th1 response or increased regulatory immune response. 
(2) To measure immune cell phenotypes in the autologous graft tissue being transplanted.  
Hypothesis:   Remission and relapse rates will correlate with differences in cell types present in 
the graft

 4.0 BACKGROUND & RATIONA LE 
4.1 Background 
1       Multiple Myeloma [MM]  
Multiple myeloma (MM) is a common hematologic malignancy with high disease morbidity burden 
in the western hemisphere. It was estimated that 70,000 new patients were diagnosed and 21,700 
patients died of MM in the US in 2012.[1] MM is a clonal neoplastic proliferation of plasma cells 
and is considered chronic and incurable, with current novel chem o-biologic targeted agents. In 
the previous conventional chemotherapy era, the median overall survival was ~4- 5 years for 
average- risk patients while this has been estimated to be much improved to >7 years in the 
current targeted era.[102 -108]  However, outcomes of high -risk or advanced MM therapy remain 
poor, with a median survival only ~8- 14 months after therapy.[2- 6] 
The current standard therapy for MM is partly based on the pre -biologic targeted era when high 
dose therapy and autologous stem cell transplant (HDT/ASCT) was proven to improve myeloma progression- free and overall survival. This consists of 3 phases: 1) primary induction therapy 2) 
consolidative HDT/ASCT and 3) maintenance therapy. The immune modulating agents, thalidomide and lenalidomide, and proteasome inhibitor bortezomib, are used in the induction and 
maintenance, while conditioning with high- dose melphalan, a conventional chemotherapeutic 
agent with high anti -MM activity, remains the standard agent.[7] Despite these measures, relapse 
or progression during maintenance is inevitable. Retreatment with or without second HDT/ASCT 
is often used but of less efficacy. Few effective treatment options are available for advanced 
relapsed MM.  
In addition, MM with certain cytogenetic abnormalities [17p- , t(4;14), t(14;16), (14:20), 13- , 
hypodiploidy and plasma cell leukemia] are of extremely poor prognosis, with a median survival of 8-14 months and 1- year and 2 -year overall survival rates of 50% and 25% only, respectively, 
after HDT/A SCT [2-6]. These high risk MMs constitute ~30% of MM. Certain novel biologic agents 
e.g. bortezomib have been shown to overcome the resistance of these high risk MMs [8,9] but 
response is temporary and none is proven to be curative or to provide meaningful long- term MM 
control. 
In the initial pioneer stage ~30 years ago, full -intensity allo- HCT was extensively explored in 
advanced or relapsed/refractory MM but these resulted in high early TRM, regimen related 
toxicities and GVHD, up to 50% in the first 6 months post transplant.[10] However, those patients 
who had survived subsequently enjoyed a sustained long- term MM control and likely a cure of 
MM. These led to the use of reduced -intensity allo -HCT in an attempt to decrease TRM in the 
past 15 -20 years. However, the success in decreasing TRM was at the expense of increasing 
MM relapse, thus resulting in no improvement of overall outcomes.[11 -14] 
Failure of the use of allo- HCT in the advanced MM setting led to studying of its role in an upfront 
setting. And to improve MM control, high -dose therapy and autologous HCT was incorporated 
prior to reduced- intensity allo- HCT (tandem auto- allo HCTs). Several genetically randomized 
controlled trials (RCT) comparing tandem auto- allo HCTs versus tandem double auto- HCTs, 
according to the availability of matched siblings. As expected, auto- allo arms experienced 
increased TRM but a trend towards a better MM control after 3 years. However, there was still no definite improvement in the overall survival.[15- 18] 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  7 
  
 
 University of Michigan experience on allo- HCT for high -risk multiple myeloma showed a marginal 
improvement in outcomes, with 1- year and 2 -year survival rates of 65% and 35%, respectively. 
Relapse rates were very high, with 1- year and 2- year progression- free survival rates of 40% and 
15% only, respectively. In addition, most surviving patients suffered debilitating chronic graft -
versus -host disease.[19,20]  
The use of novel targeted biologic agents in primary MM therapy has improved the outcome 
significantly. In addition, bortezomib has been reported to overcome the poor risk karyotype 
t(4;14).[21] Nonetheless, recent studies of primary novel targeted biologic agents, followed by 
HDT/A SCT reported 1 -year progression- free survival of ~50% only.[21- 23] 
2. Immunotherapy for Cancer  
The importance of intact immune surveillance in controlling outgrowth of neoplastic transformation has been known for decades [24]. Accumulating evidence shows a correlation between tumor-
infiltrat ing lymphocytes (TILs) in malignant tissue and favorable prognosis in vari ous malignancies 
[25-29].  In particular, the presence of CD8+ T- cells and the ratio of CD8+ effector T -cells / FoxP3+ 
regulatory T- cells seems to correlate with improved prognosis and long- term survival in many 
solid tumors.  
The PD -1 receptor -ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune 
control.  The normal function of PD -1, expressed on the cell surface of activated T- cells under 
healthy conditions, is to down- modulate unwanted or excessive immune responses, including 
autoim mune reactions.  PD -1 (encoded by the gene Pdcd1) is an Ig superfamily member related 
to CD28 and CTLA- 4 which has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling 
upon engagement of its ligands (PD -L1 and/or PD -L2) [30; 31].  The structure of murine PD -1 has 
been resolved 32].  PD -1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing 
an Ig Variable- type (V -type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail which is 
responsible for the binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 
tyrosine- based signaling motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine- based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an 
immunoreceptor tyrosine- based switch motif (ITSM).  Following T- cell stimulation, PD- 1 recruits 
the tyrosine phos phatases SHP -1 and SHP -2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading 
to the dephosphorylation of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are 
involved in the CD3 T -cell signaling cascade [30; 33; -35].  The mechanism by which PD -1 down 
modulates T- cell responses is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules 
regulate an overlapping set of signaling proteins [36; 37].  PD -1 was shown to be expressed on 
activated lymphocytes including peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B- cells, T regs and Natural 
Killer cells [38; 39].  Expression has also been shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8- 
(double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells [40].  The ligands 
for PD -1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are cons titutively expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell 
types, including non -hematopoietic tissues as well as in various tumors [36; 41- 43].  Both ligands 
are type I transmembrane receptors containing both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the extracellular  
region and contain short cytoplasmic regions with no known signaling motifs.  Binding of either PD-1 ligand to PD -1 inhibits T -cell activation triggered through the T -cell receptor.  PD -L1 is 
expressed at low levels on various non -hematopoietic tissues, m ost notably on vascular 
endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only detectably expressed on antigen -presenting cells 
found in lymphoid tissue or chronic inflammatory environments.  PD -L2 is thought to control 
immune T -cell activation in lymphoid organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -
cell function in peripheral tissues [36].  Although healthy organs express little (if any) PD -L1, a 
variety of cancers were demonstrated to express abundant levels of this T- cell inhibitor.  PD- 1

 has been suggested  to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in subjects with melanoma 
(MEL)[44].  This suggests that the PD- 1/PD -L1 pathway plays a critical role in tumor immune 
evasion and should be considered as an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
Simila rly, d ysfunction of immune surveillance of transformed cells leads  to hematologic 
malignancies.[45,46] Chemotherapy is curative in a small proportion of patients. HDT/ASCT and 
allo-HCT have a curative potential in only some of these advanced refractory malignancies. In 
addition, allo- HCT may result in multiple debilitating or fatal complications. Thus, a safer approach 
of immune therapy is needed.  
Passive immunotherapy includes administration of target specific monoclonal antibody e.g. anti -
CD20 [rituximab]  or tumor -specific effector T cells, while active immunotherapy involves the 
administration of tumor specific cell -based vaccines. These therapies are effective but of very 
short duration. The main mechanism of intolerance involves the regulatory elements e.g. immune 
check points [cytotoxic T -lymphocyte antigen- 4 (CTLA -4) and programmed death -1 (PD -1) 
receptor/PD -1-Ligand (PD -1-L) axes) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (M DSC). Other 
contributing factors in the case of cell- based therapies are poor acces s of effector cells to 
activating cytokines due to presence of competitors of cytokines [cytokine sinks] and the lack  of 
essential “space niche”.[45- 48] 
3. The PD-1/PD-L1 axis 
PD-1 belongs to the B7 family and is a key immune check -point receptor in peripheral tissues.[28] 
Its ligands are the more common PD -1-L1 (B7- H1) and PD- L2 (B7- DC). It is expressed on 
antigen -activated T and B cells, which then become immunologically exhausted, resulting in 
termination of immune response after antigen activation. The PD-1 receptor -ligand interaction is 
a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress immune control. The normal function of PD -1 
receptors , which are  expressed on the cell surface of activated T-ce lls under healthy conditions, 
are to down- regulate  unwanted or excessive immune responses, including autoimmune 
reactions.  
PD-1, which is encoded by the gene PDCD1 ), is an Ig superfamily member related to CD28 and 
CTLA -4 and has been shown to negatively regulate antigen receptor signaling upon engagement 
of its liga nds (PD -L1 and/or PD- L2) [49; 50]. The structure of murine PD -1 has been resolved [51]. 
PD-1 and family members are type I transmembrane glycoproteins containing an Ig Variable- type 
(V-type) domain responsible for ligand binding and a cytoplasmic tail whic h is responsible for the 
binding of signaling molecules.  The cytoplasmic tail of PD -1 contains 2 tyrosine- based signaling 
motifs, an immunoreceptor tyrosine- based inhibition motif (ITIM) and an immunoreceptor tyros ine-
based switch motif (ITSM). Following T-cell stimulation, PD -1 recruits the tyrosine phosphatases 
SHP-1 and SHP- 2 to the ITSM motif within its cytoplasmic tail, leading to the dephosphorylation 
of effector molecules such as CD3ζ, PKCθ and ZAP70 which are involved in the CD3 T -cell 
signaling ca scade [49; 52- 54]. The mechanism by which PD -1 down- regulates  T-cell responses 
is similar to, but distinct from that of CTLA -4 as both molecules regulate an overlapping set of 
signal ing proteins [55,56].  PD -1 is expressed on activated lymphocytes including peripheral 
CD4+ and CD8+ T -cells, B -cells, T regs and Natural Killer cells [57,58 ].  Expression has also been 
shown during thymic development on CD4- CD8- (double negative) T -cells as well as subsets of 
macrophages and dendritic cells [59]. The ligands fo r PD-1 (PD -L1 and PD -L2) are constitutively 
expressed or can be induced in a variety of cell types, including non- hematopoietic tissues as 
well as in va rious tumors [55,60 -62]. Both ligands are type I transmembrane receptors containing 
both IgV - and IgC -like domains in the extracellular region and contain short cytoplasmic regions

 with no known signaling motifs. Binding of either PD- 1 ligand to PD -1 inhibits T -cell activation 
trigger ed through the T -cell receptor.  PD-L1 is expressed at low levels on various  non-
hematopoietic tissues, most notably on vascular endothelium, whereas PD -L2 protein is only 
detectably expressed on antigen -presenting cells found in lymphoid tissue or chronic 
inflammatory environments. PD-L2 is thought to control immune T -cell activa tion in lymphoid 
organs, whereas PD -L1 serves to dampen unwarranted T -cell function in peripheral tissues [ 63]. 
Although healthy organs express no or little PD- L1, a variety of cancers express abundant levels 
of this T -cell inhibitor.  PD-1 has been suggest ed to regulate tumor -specific T -cell expansion in 
subjects with melanoma (MEL) [64]. This suggests that the PD-1/PD -L1 axis  plays a critical role 
in tumor immune evasion and is an attractive target for therapeutic intervention.  
For T cells, PD1 is a surface inhibitory molecule and is a receptor for its ligands, PD1 -L1 and 
PD1-L2, which are expressed by tumor or virally infected cells.[46 -48, 65] Like CTLA -4/ligand 
interaction , binding of PD -1 and its ligand results in inhibition of T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling 
and thus down- regulates T cell function (IFN- γ and IL -2 secretion) and survival/proliferation (BLC -
XL). In contrast, inhibition of PD -1/PD -1-L axis by either anti -PD-1 or anti -PD1-L1 leads to 
enhancement of T- cell response in vitro and preclinical anti- tumor activity.[66,67 ] 
4. Clinical Trials Targeting Cancer Immune Check Points  
The largest randomized controlled trial of anti -CTLA4 to leverage anti -tumor activity in patients 
with advanced melanoma revealed objective response but high incidence of 46% severe grade 
3/4 adverse reactions in the anti -CTLA4 alone arm.[68]  
In contrast, a pilot study of a fully humanized IgG4 anti -PD-1, later known as nivolumab, as a 
single administration on 39 patients with advanced solid tumor, including non- small cell lung 
cancers, s howed safety and feasibility.[69] There were no serious adverse reactions and most 
immune reactions were of mild severity. The plasma half -life was 12 -20 days after one single 
infusion, with >70% sustained PD -1 rec eptor occupancy for >2 months. Lastly, the clinical 
response was sustained.  
The success led to a larger phase 1 study of nivolumab on 296 patients with advanced solid tumor 
receiving one infusion (0.1 to 10 mg/kg) every 2 weeks for up to 2 years .[70] Nivolumab was well 
tolerated and MTD was not reached. The median T max was 1 -4 hours after the start of infusion. 
The PK was linear, with a dose proportional increase in the C max and AUC calculated from day 1 
to day 14 in the dose range 0.1 -10 mg/kg. The median PD-1-receptor occupancy was 64- 70% for 
the dose of 0.1- 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The incidence of grade 3/4 adverse events was 14%, 
with 3 deaths from pulmonary toxicity. The cumulative response rate (CR/PR) was 20- 25% and 
20 of 31 responders had durable response for >1 year. Some had response for >2 years. Common 
adverse reactions were grade 1 or 2 and mainly immunologic skin events (rash, pruritus, urticaria, 
vitiligo) and diarrhea.  
A more recent second phase 1 study of another anti -PD-1 (lambrolizumab; a humanized IgG4 
kappa anti -PD-1 antibody) at a dose of 10 mg/kg IV every 2 or 3 weeks  or 2 mg/kg IV every 3 
weeks  in patients with advanced melanoma for patients who had received prior treatment with 
the anti -CTLA -4, ipilimumab, and those who had not.[71 ] Steady -state serum trough 
concentration was 20% higher in the patients receiving 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, compared to the 
same dose every 3 weeks. The serum half -life time of lambrolizumab was 2- 3 weeks. Common 
adverse events were low -grade fatigue rash, prur itus and diarrhea. The overall response rate was 
38%, with the highest response rate of 52% in the cohort receiving 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  10 
  
 
 response was sustained, with a median follow -up time of 11 months. There was no difference in 
the response rates  of those having or not having had received anti -CTLA -4, ipilimumab.  
The most recent phase 1 study of combination of ant i-PD-1 nivolumab and anti- CTLA -4 
ipilimuma b has recently been reported.[72] The concurrent regimen for those not having had 
received ipilimumab consisted of IV doses of both agents in patients with advanced melanoma 
every 3 weeks  for 4 doses followed by anti -PD-1 nivolumab alone every 3 weeks  for 4 doses, 
followed by maintenance combined treatment every 12 weeks for up to 8 doses. The opti mal 
doses being nivolumab at a dose of 1 mg/kg and ipilimumab at a dose of 3 mg/kg resulted in a 53% objective response rate, with all tumor reduction of 80% or more. This study revealed a more 
rapid and deeper degree of response with the combination of both agents targeting two different 
immune checkpoints.  
A phase 1 study of anti -PD-L1 against the ligand PD -L1 on tumor cells was also performed on 
207 patients with advanced solid tumors. [ 73] The dose ranged from 0.3 to 10 mg/kg every 2 
weeks on a 6- week cycle basis up to 16 cycles. This agent was also very well tolerated and MTD 
was not reached. The grade 3/4 toxicities were only 9%. With a mean follow -up period of 12 
weeks (range, 20- 111 weeks), the objective response rate was 6- 17% and 8 of 16 responders  
had a durable response (>1 year). 
5. Multiple Myeloma Immune Evasion 
MM is an incurable malignancy due to its intrinsic chemotherapy - and immunotherapy -
refractoriness. In contrast to myeloid malignancies, allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant and 
donor lymphocyte infusion have limited role in controlling or cure of MM, i mplicating the underlying 
MM-specific immune evasion. The two major possible mechanisms include[ 74,75]  
1) Immunologically hostile microenvironment: MM cells produce multiple cytokines that promote their own survival advantage, angiogenesis and osteoclast act ivity leading to 
osteolytic lesions and resultant impaired immune response.  These cytokines include TFG-β, IL-10, MUC -1, VEGF, IL -6, Fas/FasL, COX -2 and MMP.  
2) Cellular immune defect: Dysfunction of T -cells, NK -cells, NKT -cells, B -cells, dendritic cells.  
 
6. PD-1/PD-L1 axis and T cell Function in MM  
A MM mouse model study showed that PD -1 expression on T cells from MM -bearing mice was 
up-regulated in the tumor site, compared with non- tumor sites [peripheral blood and spleen].[ 76] 
PD-1 was expressed on CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and NK cells at the tumor sites. The CD8+ T 
cells expressing PD -1 showed immunologically exhausting phenotype as evidenced by the 
impairment of IL- 2, TNF -α and IFN -γ secretion and increased Tim3 expression, compared with 
PD-1 negative CD8+  T cells from tumor site and non- tumor sites. In addition, PD -1 was up-
regulated in primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells collected before HDT/ASCT from bone marrow and peripheral blood of MM patients. The peak of PD -1 expression occurred ~day 30 post transplant 
in these MM patients.[ 77] 
Blockade of PD -1/PD -L1 axis by anti -PD-L1 against PD -L1 ligands on tumor cells enhanced 
efficacy of post -transplant cell based vaccine.[ 49] In another mouse model, it was demonstrated 
that anti -PD-L1 facilitated sub -ablative radiat ion in MM killing, which was CD8+ and CD4+ T cell 
dependent. With a more intensive therapy, anti -PD-L1 synergized with ablative radiation and 
adoptive T cell transfer.[ 77] 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  11 
  
 
 In a similar way, blockade of this axis by anti -PD1 against PD -1 on T cells was shown to enhance 
T cell migration in vitro .[78]  In a mouse model, anti -PD1 increased the efficacy of dendritic 
cell/myeloma fusion cell vaccine following HDT/ASCT.[ 79] The T cell response was enhanced ex 
vivo.[ 80] In another mouse model, anti -PD1 synergized w ith low -dose cyclophosphamide on 
enhancing the effect of vaccine therapy.[ 81] 
7. PD-1/PD-L1 axis and NK cell Function in MM  
Clinical observation revealed increasing NK cell dysfunction with the advancing stages of plasma 
cell neoplasm from MGUS to adv anced stage multiple myeloma.[82] Moreover, absolute number 
of NK cell recovery after HDT/ASCT for patients with MM correlated with PFS and OS.[ 83-85] 
In addition to the general immunologically hostile microenvironment – increased levels of TGF -β, 
IL-10, IL -6 and PGE 2, which inhibits MM killing abilities by NK cells, specific mechanisms against 
NK function include 1) direct interference by excessive MM monoclonal immunoglobulin 2) depletion of essential cytokines by secretion of decoy soluble IL- 2 receptor and expression of 
surface IL -15 receptors 3) modulation of NK receptor ligations including loss or down- regulation 
of membrane MICA, NKG2D and DNAM -1 in advanced MM, increased membrane MHC class I 
expression and secretion of soluble MHC class I and beta-2- microglobulin 4) down- regulation and 
loss-of-function mutation of membrane Fas receptors on MM cells and 5) increased expression 
of PD -1-ligand on MM cells.[ 82,86 ] 
Pre-clinical data showed that NK cell lines were able to kill clonogenic MM cell lines in vitro  and 
in vivo .[87] In addition, PD -1 was demonstrated to be up- regulated on primary NK cells from MM 
patients and MM bearing mice as a the function of MM burden.[ 88] In vitro data revealed that anti-
PD-1 enhanced NK cell cytotoxicity against and trafficking towards PD -L1
+ MM cell lines. In 
addition, anti- PD-1 enhanced immune complex formation between NK and MM cells. 
Interestingly, lenalidomide was also shown to down- regulate PD -L1 expression on MM cells and 
this effect was synergistic with NK cytotoxicity against PD -L1+ MM cell lines.[ 88] 
8. Clinical Data on Leveraging NK cell versus MM effect  
Two activating lymphokines, IFN -α and IL -2, were investigated in clinical trials. IFN- α was shown 
to have activity against MM in vitro , ex vivo  and in patients. It was found to mobilize peripheral 
NK cells into bone marrow, the MM site.[89,90 ] Two large meta -analyses of these randomized 
controlled trials revealed a 20% response rate and prolonged PFS and OS.[91,92 ] Thus, IFN -α 
has remained a standard option for MM treatment. However, significant adverse events precluded its long -term use. Similar outcomes were seen in studies using IL- 2, which increased the number 
of lymphokine- activated killer [LAK] cells, with modest response rate.[93- 96]  Unfortunately, IL- 2 
was associated with more unacceptable toxicities, preventing long- term use.[ 95-97] 
Observation studies of HDT/ASCT for MM reported consistent correlation between early 
lymphocyte recovery and progression- free survival.[ 83-85,98,99 ] The d ose of lymphocytes 
infused, especially the NK cell dose, predicted overall lymphocyte and NK cell recovery, which, in turn, correlated with survival.[ 85] Day -15 absolute lymphocyte count [ALC] >500/μL and day -30 
ALC >1000/μL correlated with PFS and OS.[ 81,82,96,97 ] More specifically, day -15 absolute NK -
cell count >80/μL correlated with PFS.[100] Mayo Clinic group demonstrated an augmentation of 
ex vivo  day-14 primary NK cell cytotoxicity by IL -2 and IFN -α early post HDT/ASCT in patients 
with MM.[ 95] Lastly,  Meehan et al  conducted a phase 1/2 study of post -HDT/ASCT 
immunomodulation of NK cell function in MM patients with IL- 2 therapy during lymphopenic state 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  12 
  
 
 from day 0 for 4 weeks, in conjunction with GM -CSF. There was a significant increase in the 
number of CD3+T cells, CD4+Tcells, CD8+T cells and CD25+ and CD8+CD56+Treg cells, compared 
with control.[ 101]  Ex vivo cytotoxicity of peripheral blood mononuclear cell against MM cell lines 
increased significantly, compared with control.[ 101] 
9. Homeostatic Proliferation of Lymphocytes  
Active immunotherapy e.g. adoptive T cell transfer and cell based vaccines have been limited in 
sustained efficacy due to immune check point and other regulatory components and competition 
with native immune cells for space niche and essential homeostasis lymphokines.[ 45-48, 65]  
Lympho- depletion state occurring after irradiation or chemotherapy creates a suitable condition 
for transferred or newly activated lymphocytes to proliferate and be activated due to depletion of 
competi tors for space niche, cytokines (cytokine sinks) and suppressors or regulators.[ 102-107] 
This effect is potentiated by higher intensity ablation and infusion of hematopoietic stem cells. 
With a higher degree of depletion of competitors or suppressor components, transferred 
lymphocytes proliferate and become activated more efficiently, with less intensity of antigen and 
co-stimulatory signals. In addition, infused hematopoietic stem cells provide more effector and 
precursor cells, which produce or induce other cells to secrete essential cytokines, growth factors and anti -apoptotic factors, nourishing transferred lymphocytes.[ 108,109] Condomines et al  
demonstrated a nadir of absolute lymphocyte count occurring ~day 3- 8 post high -dose 
melphalan/HSCT in patients  with MM and coinciding with the peak of serum IL- 6, IL- 7 and IL- 15 
levels.[ 110] 
10.         Previous Related Clinical Studies on Lymphoid Malignancies 
A phase 2 study of a humanized anti -PD-1 monoclonal antibody, MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab),  in 
66 patients with diffuse large B -cell lymphoma post -HDT/ASCT.[ 89] MK-3475 was administered 
at 1.5 mg/kg every 6 weeks for 3 cycles, starting between 30- 90 days post transplant. This 
intervention was safe and feasible. The 18 -month progression free survival was 72% (95%C I; 60-
82%) overall and 70% (95% CI; 51- 82%) in 24 high- risk patients with PET+ disease prior to 
transplant. The results were very promising, when compared with historical data. Treatment was 
associated with increases in circulating lymphocyte subsets including PD -L1+ lymphocytes, 
suggesting an on- target in vivo  effect of MK -3475. [ 111] 
A more recent phase 2 study of a combination of MK-3475 and the anti -CD20 rituximab in 32 
patients with advanced rituximab -sensitive follicular lymphoma at 3 mg/kg intravenously every 4 
weeks for 4 infusions, plus additional 8 optional infusions every 4 weeks for patients with stable disease or better. Rituximab was added on day 17 at 375 mg/m
2 intravenously weekly for 4 weeks. 
The combination of MK-3475 and rituximab was well tolerated, with no autoimmune or treatment -
related adverse events of grade 3 or 4. The most common adverse events of grade 1 were anaemia (14 patients) and fatigue (13 patients), and the most common adverse event of grade 2 
was respiratory infection (5 patients). Of the 29 patients evaluable for activity, 19 (66%) achieved 
an objective response: complete responses were noted in 15 (52%) patients and partial responses in four (14%).[ 112] 
11. Anti-PD-1: MK-3475 (Pembrolizumab)[ 113] 
MK-3475 (previously known as SCH 900475) is a potent and highly selective humanized 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  13 
  
 
 monoclonal antibody (mAb) of the IgG4/kappa isotype designed to directly block the interaction 
between PD -1 and its ligands, PD -L1 and PD -L2 without ADCC or CDC activity .  
 MK-3475 strongly enhances T -lymphocyte immune responses in cultured blood cells from healthy 
human donors, cancer patients, and primates. In T- cell activation assays using human donor 
blood cells, the EC
50 (concentration where 50% of the maximum effect is achieved) has been ~0.1 
to 0.3 nM. In addition to interleukin- 2 (IL-2), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα), interferon gamma 
(IFNg), and levels of other cytokines were modulated by MK -3475. The antibody potentiates 
existing immune responses only in the presence of antigen and does not nonspecifically activate 
T-cells. Using an anti -murine PD -1 an alog antibody, PD -1 blockade has been shown to 
significantly inhibit tumor growth in a variety of syng eneic murine tumor models. In these 
experiments in mice, anti-PD- 1 therapy is synergistic with chemotherapeutic agents such as 
gemcitabine and 5- fluorouracil (5 -FU) and combination therapy results in increased complete 
tumor regression rates in vivo . 
 
Therapeutic studies in mouse models have shown that administration of antibodies blocking PD -
1/PD -L1 interaction enhances infiltration of tumor -specific CD8+ T -cells and leads ultimately to 
tumor rejection, either as a mono- therapy or in combination with other  treatment modalities.  Anti-
mouse PD -1 or anti -mouse PD -L1 antibodies have demonstrated anti -tumor responses as a 
mono- therapy in models of squamous cell carcinoma, pancreatic carcinoma, MEL and colorectal 
carcinoma.  Blockade of the PD -1 pathway effectively promoted CD8+ T- cell infiltration into the 
tumor and the presence of IFN- γ, granzyme B, and perforin, indicating that the mechanism of 
action involved local infiltration and activation of effector T -cell function in vivo 114- 119].  
Experiments have confirmed the in vivo efficacy of PD- 1 blockade as a mono- therapy as well as 
in combination with chemotherapy in syngeneic mouse tumor models (see the Investigator’s Brochure [IB]).  
Based on preclinical in vitro  data, MK -3475 has high affinity and potent receptor blocking activity 
for PD -1. MK -3475 has an acceptable preclinical safety profile and is being advanced for clinical 
development as an immunotherapy for advanced malignancies.  
 Clinical dat a from PN001 is presented in the  report with a visit cut -off date of 26- Jul- 2013. As of 
26-Jul-2013, there have been 789 patients treated in PN001 with MK -3475 as a 30 -minute IV 
infusion. Of these 789 patients, preliminary data are presented in this  report from 479 patients. 
Data from 200 patients in Part B3 and 110 patients in Part F  that were treated as of the cut -off 
data were not included in the analyses yet. Based upon this safety database consisting of patients 
treated up to 10 mg/kg once every two to three weeks, MK -3475 has been generally well -tolerated 
at doses up to 10 mg/kg every other  week without DLTs. One (0.002%) patient assayed to date 
had samples confirmed positive for ADA, but no impact on safety has been observed. Five other 
clinical studies  (PN002, PN006, PN010, PN011,  and PN012) are ongoing however preliminary 
data a nalyses are not yet available. For these 5 studies, the number of treated patients  indicated 
in this report is based on a visit cut -off date of 18 -Oct- 2013 to allow for more mature enrollment 
data and align  with the Development Safety Update Report data cutoff 
date.  MK-3475 PK results have been obtained from PN001 following the first dose at 1, 3 and  
10 mg/kg IV of MK -3475 administered to 17 patients with solid tumors. The observed 
pharmacokinetic profile of  MK-3475 was typical of other IgG mAbs with a half -life (t½)  of 
approximately 2 to 3 weeks. There was no indication of dose dependency of half -life in the 3 dose 
groups and a dose related increase in exposure was observed from 1 to 10  mg/kg. The long half -
life supports a dosing interval of every 2 or 3 weeks. Exposure  obtained with sparse sampling 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  14 
  
 
 after dosing melanoma and non- small cell lung cancer  (NSCLC) patients at 2 and 10 mg/kg, every 
2 or 3 weeks, is consistent with this profile.  As of 18- Oct-2013, PN002 has randomized 497 
patients with metastatic melanoma (495 p atients were treated) across 3 treatment groups as 
follows, MK -3475 2 mg/kg Q3W,  MK-3475 10 mg/kg Q3W, and chemotherapy (investigator choice 
of treatment) in a 1:1:1  ratio. PN006 has randomized 68 IPI -naïve patients with unresectable or 
metastatic  melanoma across the 3 treatment groups: 10 mg/kg Q2W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and  
ipilimumab in a 1:1:1 ratio. PN010 has randomized three patients with NSCLC across  the 3 
treatment groups: 10 mg/kg Q3W, 2 mg/kg Q3W, and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 Q3W in  a 1:1:1 ratio. 
In PN011 10 patients have been treated. In PN012, 109 patients have been treated across the 
three cohorts as of 18- Oct-2013.  Durable objective responses have been reported in patients with 
melanoma and NSC LC. Adverse events have generally been manageable and infrequently 
require discontinuation of MK -3475 treatment.  
 
12. Significance  
This phase 2 study is embarking on leveraging T and NK cell function after standard high- dose 
therapy and autologous transplant for multiple myeloma by use of anti -PD-1 to disrupt the PD -
1/PD -L-1 immune checkpoint axis. This translational concept is based on the extensive pre-
clinical data of this axis specifically in myeloma and the positive clinical outcomes and safety  
profiles from recent phase I studies of this agent in patients with advanced solid tumors. Timing 
of treatment during post transplant lympho- penic state is expected to further enhance the effect 
of anti -PD-1. 
Multiple myeloma is a very common hematologic malignancy in the US but remains incurable, 
even with novel targeted agents and high -dose therapy/autologous transplant. Immunotherapy 
e.g. allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant has a curative potential but at the expense of high 
treatment -related mortality (graft -versus -host disease, infection and other transplant specific 
events). Thus, the positive outcomes of this safer strategy will definitely be a break through and has great impact on the outcomes of therapy for this common cancer.  
 
4.2 Rationale  
 
4.2.1 Rationale for the Study  and Selected Subject Population  
 
1. Immunotherapy is highly potent but very short -lived in clinical setting; thus meaningful 
clinical benefits are lacking. Reasons include: a) presence of immune checkpoints [CTLA4 and 
PD-1 receptor/PD -1 ligand axes]; b) presence of other suppressor elements [regulatory T cells 
(Treg), myeloid derived suppressor cell s (MD SC)]; c) presence of competitors for essential 
activating cytokines for T/NK cells [Cytokine Sinks]; and d) the lack of “space niche”.  
 2.  Patients with MM who do not respond adequately with primary therapy and those with 
high-risk cytogenetic features have worse treatment outcomes, compared with those who achieve 
a complete response status, which predicts favorable long -term outcomes. Complete response 
rate after primary therapy with highly effective targeted agents, followed by HDT/ASCT is 
disappointingly low (30% only).  
3. Early lymphocyte, especially NK cells, and antigen -presenting dendritic cell recovery post-
transplant is associated with decreased  multiple myeloma relapse.  
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  15 
  
 
 4.  Clinical trials using anti- Cytotoxic T -lymphocyte Antigen -4 [Anti -CTLA4] to leverage T cell 
function resulted in very promising anti- tumor outcomes but high rate of serious autoimmunity.  
5.  Preclinical studie s showed increased PD -1 expression on CD8+ and CD4+ T cells and NK 
cells at the multiple myeloma sites and their function was impaired. Disruption of the PD -1/PD -L1 
axis restored their cytotoxicity against and trafficking towards multiple myeloma. Lastly, in a 
mouse model, anti- PD1 increased the efficacy of dendritic cell/myeloma fusion cell vaccine 
following HDT/ASCT and synergized with low -dose cyclophosphamide on enhancing the effect of 
vaccine therapy.  
6. PD-1 was expressed on primary T and NK cells from multiple myeloma patients. In 
addition, PD -1 was expressed on primary CD4+ and CD8+ T cells collected before and after 
HDT/ASCT from bone marrow and peripheral blood of MM patients. The time peak of PD -1 
expression occurred ~day 30 post -transplant in these MM patients.  
7.   Phase 1 studies of fully humanized IgG4 anti -PD-1 in advanced cancers showed its 
feasibility and safety for use in human, with a sustained anti -tumor activity and a more favorable 
adverse reaction profile, and pharmacokinetics and -dynamics profiles.  
8.    Post high -dose chemotherapy lympho- depletion state is devoid of suppressor T reg or 
MDSC and competitors for enriching cytokines, with more available space niches.  
9.    In addition, transfer of hematopoietic stem cells and T cells with autologous transplant 
augments the above effects of lympho- depletion to T cell/immune recovery.  
10.    Based on the above evidence, administration of anti -PD-1 to unleash and augment T and 
NK cell function during ly mphopenic state early post HDT/A SCT when PD -1 expression on 
effector cells peaks and myeloma tumor burden nadirs may result in a maximal synergy on the 
cytotoxicity to multiple myeloma. This may then result in the improvement of multiple myeloma 
relapse post transplant and overall transplant  outcomes.  
4.2.2 Rationale for Dose Selection/Regimen/Modification  
An open- label Phase I trial (Protocol 001) was conducted to evaluate the safety and clinical activity 
of single agent MK -3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 
mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.  All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose- limiting toxicities were 
observed. This first in human study of MK -3475 showed evidence of target engagement and 
objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg 
Q2W).  No MTD has been identified.  10.0 mg/kg Q2W, the highest dose tested in PN001, will be 
the dose and schedule utilized in Cohorts A, B, C and D of this protocol to test for initial tumor activity.  Recent data from other clinical studies within the MK -3475 program has shown that a 
lower dose of MK- 3475 and a less frequent schedule may be sufficient for target engagement and 
clinical activity.  
 
PK data analysis of MK- 3475 administered Q2W and Q3W showed slow systemic clearance, 
limited volume of distribution, and a long half -life (98).  Pharmacodynamic data (IL -2 release 
assay) suggested that peripheral target engagement is durable (>21 days).  This early PK and 
pharmacodynamic data provides scientific rationale for testing a Q2W and Q3W dosing sc hedule.   
 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  16 
  
 
 A population pharmacokinetic analysis has been performed using serum concentration time data 
from 476 patients. Within the resulting population PK model, clearance and volume parameters 
of MK -3475 were found to be dependent on body weight. The r elationship between clearance and 
body weight, with an allometric exponent of 0.59, is within the range observed for other antibodies and would support both body weight normalized dosing or a fixed dose across all body weights.  
MK-3475 has been found to have a wide therapeutic range based on the melanoma indication.  
The differences in exposure for a 200 mg fixed dose regimen relative to a 2 mg/kg Q3W body 
weight based regimen are anticipated to remain well within the established exposure margins of 
0.5 – 5.0 for MK -3475 in the melanoma indication. The exposure margins are based on the notion 
of similar efficacy and safety in melanoma at 10 mg/kg Q3W vs. the proposed dose regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W (i.e. 5 -fold higher dose and exposure). The population PK evaluation revealed that 
there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar 
between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in 
exposure between different indication settings.  
 The dose regimen of 200 mg Q3W of MK-3475 is planned for all urothelial cancer trials. Available 
PK results in subjects with melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer ( NSCLC) , and other solid tumor 
types support a lack of meaningful difference in PK exposures obtained at a given dose among tumor types. An open -label Phase 1 trial (PN001) in melanoma subjects is being conducted to 
evaluate the safety and clinical activity of single agent MK-3475.  The dose escalation portion of 
this trial evaluated three dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 
weeks (Q2W) in subjects with advanced solid tumors.   All three dose levels were well tolerated 
and no dose- limiting toxicities were observed.   This first in human study of MK-3475 showed 
evidence of target engagement and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg Q2W).   No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been identified.  
In KEYNOTE- 001, two randomized cohort evaluations of melanoma subjects receiving MK-3475 
at a dose of 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W have been completed.   The clinical efficacy and safety 
data demonstrate a lack of clinically important differences in efficacy response or safety profile at 
these doses.   For example, in Cohort B2, advanced melanoma subjects who had received prior 
ipilimumab therapy were randomized to receive MK-3475 at 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W.   The 
overall response rate (ORR) was 26% (21/81) in the 2mg/kg group and 26% (25/79) in the 10 
mg/kg group (full analysis set (FA S)).  The proportion of subjects with drug -related adverse events 
(AEs), grade 3- 5 drug -related AEs, serious drug- related AEs, death or discontinuation due to an 
AE was comparable between groups or lower in the 10 mg/kg group.    
Available pharmacokinetic results in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, and other solid tumor 
types support a lack of meaningful difference in pharmacokinetic exposures obtained at a given 
dose among tumor types.   Population PK analysis has been performed and has confirmed the 
expectation that intrinsic factors do not affect exposure to MK-3475 to a clinically meaningful 
extent.   Taken together, these data support the use of lower doses (with similar exposure to 2 
mg/kg Q3W) in all solid tumor indications.   2 mg/kg Q3W is being evaluated in NSCLC in PN001, 
Cohort F30 and PN010, and 200 mg Q3W is being evaluated in head and neck cancer in PN012, which are expected to provide additional data supporting the dose selection.  
Selection of 200 mg as the appropriate dose for a switch to fixed dosing is based on simulation results indicating that 200 mg will provide exposures that are reasonably consistent with those 
obtained with 2 mg/kg dose and importantly will maintain individual patient exposures within the exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal clinical response.   A 
population PK model, which characterized the influence of body weight and other patient 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  17 
  
 
 covariates on exposure, has been developed using available data from 476 subjects from 
PN001.   The distribution of exposures from the 200 mg fixed dose are predicted to considerably 
overlap those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose, with some tendency for individual values to range slightly higher with the 200 mg fixed dose.    The slight increase in PK variability predicted for the 
fixed dose relative to weight -based dosing is not expected to be clinically important given that the 
range of individual exposures is well contained within the range of exposures shown in the melanoma studies of 2 and 10 mg/kg to provide similar efficacy and safety.   The population PK 
evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no 
anticipated changes in exposure between different tumor types and indication settings.  
Based on the PK/PD data, and the time peak of PD- 1 expression on primary T- cells at day 30 
post-transplant in MM patients,[40] we will study anti -PD-1 at a fixed dose of 200 mg MK- 3475 
intravenously every 3 weeks (+/ -4 days), starting on day +14 or later after an engraftment until 
~day 182 post -transplant for a total of 9 doses. [See Schema]  
 
4.2.3 Rationale for Endpoints 
See Section 5.10 and Appendix 13.3 for the definition of Endpoints.  
 4.2.3.1 Efficacy Endpoints  
We expect that the addition of  anti-PD1 during lymphopenic  state after  high dose therapy and 
autologous transplant will augment immune reaction against multiple myeloma and increase 
complete response (CR) conversion rate at day 180. 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint :  CR rate at day 180  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
- CR rate at day 100  
- Flow based minimal residual disease ( MRD ) rate at day 100 and day 180  
- Progression- free survival at 2 years  
- Overall survival at 2 years  
- Compliance with treatment:  
o Median Number of doses administered  
o Dose de- escalation requirements  
 
4.2.3.2 Safety Endpoints 
- Regimen -related toxicities (RRT) according to CTCAE v4  
- Engraftment  
- Treatment -related mortality  (TRM)  
- Late adverse reactions especially autoimmune disorders

Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  24 
  
 
 A fixed MK -3475 dose of 200 mg/day will be administered as a 30- minute intravenous (IV) infusion 
every 3 weeks, starting ~day +14 post -transplant (Schema).   Dose days are 4 days flexible (+/ - 4 
days).  
 
Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  
However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and +10 
minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).

5.3.3 Standard Transplantation Drugs  
 
1. Melphalan [ Evomela, A lkeran] 
Formulation:   Melphalan (L- phenylanine mustard) is a bifunctional alkylating agent.  It forms 
covalent linkages with susceptible cellular proteins.  It induces formation of DNA interstrand and 
DNA protein cross -links.  Alkeran: IV administration of melphalan revealed rapid elimination from 
plasma with terminal half -life of 1.8 hours.  13% is excreted in the urine.  It is rapidly distributed in 
total body water and eliminated in a biphasic manner. IP administration of 20- 30 mg/M 2 revealed 
a peak concentration in the peritoneal cavity of 6.4 ± 2.4  µg/ml and half -life of 85 ± 30 minutes.  
The peak plasma concentration was 1.22 µg/ml, and half -life was 86 ± 31 minutes. Evomela: IV 
administration has  a comparable PK profile to conventional IV melphalan (Alkeran).   
Availability:  Alkeran: The drug is available as an injectable kit.  This kit contains an ampule of 
100 mg (equivalent) melphalan, a 1 ml ampule of acid- alcohol diluent (cont aining 0.047 ml 37% 

Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  25 
  
 
 HCl, q.s. to 1 ml with alcohol) and a 9 ml ampule of final diluent  containing dipotassium phosphate, 
108 mg propylene glycol 5.4 ml sterile water for injection q.s. 9.0 ml.  Evomela: The drug  is 
available as a lyophilized powder in a si ngle-dose vial for intravenous use. Each vial contains 50 
mg melphalan free base equivalent to 56 mg melphalan hydrochloride and 2700 mg Betatex 
Sulfobutyl Ether Sodium . The Alkeran kits and Evomela vials should be stored at room 
temperature and projected from light.  
Administration : Alkeran: The 100 mg injectable formulation is put into solution initially with the 
addition of 1 m acid -alcohol diluent.  When dissolution is complete, the 9 ml final diluent is added.  
This final solution has a pH of > 7 and should be used promptly.  According to the manufacturer 
(8.5% hydrolysis 24 hours after mixing) a further dilution in D 5W is also reportedly stable for 24 
hours. Evomela: Each 50 mg vial is reconstituted with 8.6 mL of normal saline solution (0.9% 
Sodium Chloride Injection, USP) to make a 50 mg/10 mL (5 mg/mL) nominal concentration of melphalan. The reconstituted Evomela drug product is stable for: 24 hours at refrigerated 
temperature (5
oC) without any precipitation due to the high solubility, and for 1 hour at room 
temperature. Add the required volume of Evomela to the appropriate volume of 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to a final concentration of 0.45 mg/mL. The Evomela admixture solution 
is stable for 4 hours at room temperature in addition to the 1 hour following reconstitution.  
Potential and Expected Toxicities:  Human Toxicology: Melphalan's major systemic toxicity is 
bone marrow depression with secondary anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, usually occurring within three to five weeks of the onset of therapy and lasting four to eight weeks. These 
effects are exacerbated by prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy.  Other adverse reactions  include 
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomatitis, esophagitis, colitis, increases in liver function and kidney function tests, renal/bladder necrosis, pulmonary fibrosis, respiratory distress, peripheral 
neuropathy, paresthesia, alopecia, fever and hypersensitivity including edema, rash and 
anaphylaxis. At high doses, supraventricular arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, may occur.  
The occurrence of acute leukemia has been reported rarely in patients treated with 
anthracycline/alkylator combination chemotherapy.
  
 2. FILGRASTIM  (r-metHuG -CSF, NEUPOGEN®)  
Formulation:  Filgrastim, (recombinant human granulocyte- colony stimulating factor, r -metHuG -  
CSF), is a protein produced by E. coli into which has been inserted the human granulocyte colony -
stimulating factor gene.  Filgrastim differs from the natural protein in that the N -terminal amino 
acid is a methionine and it is not o - glycosylated.  G -CSF functions as a hematopoietic growth 
hormone; it increases the proliferation, differentiation, maturation and release of precursor cells 
into mature blood cells of the neutrophil lineage.  G -CSF has demonstrated in vitro effects on 
mature neutrophils, including an increased expression of chemotactic receptors, enhanced phagocytosis and intracellular killing of certain organisms, as well as enhanced killing of target 
cells that are bound by antibodies.  
Approximately 6,400 patients in U.S. and international based trials have participated in clinical 
trials of filgrastim to date, and the worldwide commercial populations receiving filgrastim totaled 
approximately 190,000.  The drug has been found to be well tolerated at dosages up to 69 
µg/kg/day given IV or SC, with no toxic effects attributable to filgrastim.  A maximum tolerated dose has not yet been determined.  
Availability:   Recombinant G -CSF, filgrastim, NEUPOGEN ®, is supplied as a clear, colorless 
preservative- free liquid for parenteral administration.  Single use vials contain filgrastim 300 µg/ml 
in a preservative- free solution with 0.59 mg/ml acetate, 50 mg/ml sorbitol, 0.004% Tween® 80, 
0.035 mg/ml sodium, and water for injection, USP, pH 4.0 to make 1 ml filgrastim Neupogen® is 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  26 
  
 
 commercially available in 2 vial sizes:  300 µcg/1 ml and 480 µg/1.6 ml. Dilution:  If required, 
filgrastim may be diluted in 5% dextrose.  Filgrastim diluted to concentrations between 5 and 15 
µg/m l should be protected from adsorption to plastic materials by addition of albumin (Human) to 
a final concentration of 2 mg/ml.  When diluted in 5% dextrose or 5% dextrose plus albumin (Human), filgrastim is compatible with glass bottles, PVC and polyolefin IV bags, and 
polypropylene syringes.  Dilution of filgrastim to a final concentration of less than 5 µg/ml is not 
recommended at any time.  Do not dilute with saline at any time; product may precipitate. Storage 
and Stability:  Filgrastim should be stored in the refrigerator at 2 - 8°C  (36 - 46°F).  Avoid shaking.  
Prior to injection, filgrastim may be allowed to reach room temperature for a maximum of 24 hours   
Any vial left at room temperature for greater than 24 hours should be discarded.  Parenteral drug 
products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to 
administration, whenever solution and container permit; if particulates or discoloration are 
observed, the container should not be used.  
Administration:   Filgrastim is administered as a single daily injection by SC bolus injection, by 
short IV infusion (15 - 30 minutes), or by continuous SC or continuous IV infusion.    
Potential and Expected Toxicities : The most frequently reported adverse effect was medullary 
bone pain, occurring in 20 - 25% of patients in Phase II and III trials.  When bone pain was reported 
it often preceded a rise in the circulating neutrophil count; it oc curred more  frequently in patients 
treated with 20 - 100 µg/kg/day of intravenously administered filgrastim and less often in lower 
subcutaneous doses.  The pain was generally mild to moderate in severity, and usually controlled 
with non -narcotic analgesics such as acetaminophen.  Other side effects include transient but 
reversible increases of alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and uric acid levels.  These occurred in 27- 58% of patients, without clinical sequelae observed.  Elevations of leukocyt e 
alkaline phosphatase levels have also been noted but the significance is not yet known.  Less 
frequently reported adverse events related to filgrastim administration include subclinical 
splenomegaly, exacerbation of pre- existing skin rashes, alopecia, and thrombocytopenia, and 
cutaneous vasculitis.  Rarely, allergic -type reactions have occurred.  Since the commercial 
introduction of filgrastim there have been reports (< 1 in 4,000 patients) of symptoms suggestive of an allergic -type reaction, but in which an immune component has not been demonstrated.   
These have generally been characterized by systemic symptoms involving at least two body systems, most often skin (rash, urticaria, edema), respiratory (wheezing, dypsnea), and 
cardiovascular (hypotension, tachycardia).  Some reactions occurred on initial exposure.  
Reactions tended to occur within the first thirty minutes after administration and appeared to occur more frequently in those patients who received filgrastim intravenously.  Rapid resolution of 
symptoms occurred in most cases after administration of standard supportive care, and symptoms 
recurred in more than half the patients when rechallenged.  
 3. LENALIDOMIDE  (REVLIMID ®) 
Formulation: A thalidomide analogue, is an immunomodulatory agent with anti -angiogenic  
properties. The chemical name is 3 -(4-amino-1- oxo 1,3- dihydro -2H-isoindol -2-yl) piperidine- 2,6-
dione and the gram molecular weight is 259.3.  The mechanism of action of lenalidomide remains 
to be fully characterized. Lenalidomide possesses  immu nomodulatory and antiangiogenic 
properties. Lenalidomide inhibited the secretion of proinflammatory  cytokines and increased the 
secretion of anti -inflammatory cytokines from peripheral  blood mononuclear cells. Lenalidomide 
inhibited the expression of cyclooxygenase- 2 (COX -2) but not COX -1 in vitro.  Lenalidomide, in 
healthy volunteers, is rapidly absorbed following oral administration with maximum plasma 
concentrations occurring between 0.625 and 1.5 hours post -dose. Co administration with food 
does not alter the extent of absorption (AUC) but does reduce the maximal plasma concentration

regimen does not result in drug accumulation. In multiple myeloma patients maximum plasma concentrations occurred between 0.5 and 4.0 hours post -dose both on Days 1 and 28. AUC and 
Cmax values increase proportionally with dose following single and multiple doses. Exposure (AUC) in multiple myeloma patients is 57% higher than in healthy male volunteers.  
 Availability: Lenalidomide ( REVLIMID®) is available in 5, 10, 15 and 25 mg capsules for oral 
administration. Each  capsule contains lenalidomide as the active ingredient and the following 
inactive  ingredients: lactose anhydrous, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, and 
magnesium stearate. The 5 mg capsule shell contains gelatin, titanium dioxide and black ink. The 
10 mg capsule shell contains gelatin, FD&C blue #2, yellow iron oxide, titanium dioxide and black 
ink. Lenalidomide is an off -white to pale- yellow solid powder. It is soluble in organic solvent/water  
mixtures, and buffered aqueous solvents. Lenalidomide is more soluble in organic solvents and 
low pH  solutions. Solubility was significantly lower in less acidic buffers, ranging from about 0.4 
to 0.5 mg/ml. Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can exist as the optically active 
forms S( -) and R(+), and is produced as a racemic mixture with a net optical rotation of zero.   
 
Administration: Lenalidomide ( REVLIMID®) is administered as an oral route, preferably at the 
same time.  
 
Potential and Expected Toxicities : Hematologic: anemia, neutropenia, leucopenia,  
lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia;  thromboembolic events (deep vein thrombosis and 
pulmonary embolism).  Neurologic: Somnolence, dizziness, headache, confusion, tremor, loss of 
co-ordination,  asthenia, paresthesia, numbness, and leukoencephalopathy (radiographic  
findings).  Gastrointestinal: Constipation, dehydration, dry mouth, diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea,  
vomiting and stomatitis. Constitutional: Weakness, insomnia, rigors, chills, sweating, weight loss

Note: Pregnancy reporting: Due to its structural similarities to thalidomide, a known human 
teratogen , lenalidomide is contraindicated in pregnant women and women capable of 
becoming pregnant.  When there is  no alternative, females of  childbearing potential may be 
treated with lenalidomide provided adequate precautions are taken to avoid pregnancy. Females 
must commit either to abstain continuously from heterosexual sexual intercourse or to use two 
methods of reliable birth control, including at least one highly effective method (e.g., IUD, 
hormonal contraception, tubal ligation, or partner’s vasectomy) and one additional effective 
method (e.g., latex condom, diaphragm, or cervical cap), beginning 4 weeks prior to initiating 
treatment with REVLIMID® (lenalidomide), during therapy with REVLIMID® (lenalidomide), 
during therapy delay, and continuing for 4 weeks following discontinuation of REVLIMID® 
(lenalidomide) therapy. If hormonal or IUD contraception is medically contraindicated, two other 
effective or highly effective methods may be used.  
 Note:  Deep Venous Thrombosis and Pulmonary Embolism : lenalidomide  has demonstrated a 
significantly increased risk of DVT and PE in patients with multiple myeloma who were treated with REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) combination therapy. Patients and physicians are advised to 
be observant for the signs and symptoms  of thromboembolism. Patients should be instructed to

 seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or arm or 
leg swelling.  
  
5.3.4 Study Drug: MK -3475 (Pembrolizumab ) 
5.3.4.1 Description  
MK-3475 is a potent humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody with high specificity of binding to the 
PD-1receptor, thus inhibiting its interaction with PD -L1 and PD -L2. Based on preclinical in vitro  
data, MK -3475 has high affinity and potent receptor blocking ac tivity for PD -1. 
MK-3475 has an acceptable preclinical safety profile.  
 
MK-3475 is a humanized anti- PD-1 mAb of the IgG4/kappa isotype with a stabilizing  S228P 
sequence alteration in the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region. MK -3475 binds to  human PD -1 and 
blocks the interaction between PD -1 and its ligands. The theoretical  molecular weight of the 
polypeptide is 146,288 Da and its theoretical pI is 7.5. The parental murine anti -human PD -1 
antibody (hPD-1 .09A) was produced by immunizing mice with hPD -1 DNA. The MK -3475 
antibody was generated by humanization of the  parental antibody by the Medical Research 
Council (Cambridge, UK) using  complementarily -determining region (CDR) grafting technology 
(U.S. Patent No.  5,225,539). The gene segments encoding the variable heavy and light chains of 
MK- 3475, as well as human IgG4, were codon -optimized, synthesized, and ligated into a vector.  
 A single expression plasmid, pAPD11V1- GA was constructed for the expression of both the heavy 
and light antibody chains of MK -3475.  The nucleotide sequences encoding the  heavy and light 
chains, along with their respective promoters and poly A signal  sequences have been confirmed 
by DNA sequence analysis. The pAPD11V1- GAexpression vector was subsequently used to 
transfect CHO -DXB-11 cells for the  development of the MK- 3475- producing cell line.  
 5.3.4.2 Formulation   
 MK-3475 Solution will be used. Refer to the Investigator Brochure (IB).  
 
5.3.4.3 Storage  
MK-3475 Solution is stored under refrigerated conditions (2°C - 8°C).  Refer to the IB.  
 5.3.4.4 Administration    
MK-3475 is administer ed as a 30 -minute IV infusion. Refer to the IB.   
 
5.3.4.5 Dose Selection  
 Dose Selection Rationale  
The dose regimen of 200 mg Q3W of MK-3475 is planned for all urothelial cancer trials. Available 
PK results in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, and other solid tumor types support a lack of 
meaningful difference in PK exposures obtained at a given dose among tumor types. An open -
label Phase 1 trial  (PN001) in melanoma subjects is being conducted to evaluate the safety and 
clinical activity of single agent MK-3475.  The dose escalation portion of this trial evaluated three 
dose levels, 1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg, and 10 mg/kg, administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) in subjects with 
advanced solid tumors.   All three dose levels were well tolerated and no dose- limiting toxicities 
were observed.   This first in human study of MK-3475 showed evidence of target engagement 
and objective evidence of tumor size reduction at all dose levels (1 mg/kg, 3 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg 
Q2W).   No maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been identified. 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  29 
  
 
  
In KEYNOTE- 001, two randomized cohort evaluations of melanoma subjects receiving 
pembrolizumab at a dose of 2 mg/kg versus 10 mg/kg Q3W have been com pleted.   The clinical 
efficacy and safety data demonstrate a lack of clinically important differences in efficacy response 
or safety profile at these doses.   For example, in Cohort B2, advanced melanoma subjects who 
had received prior ipilimumab therapy were randomized to receive pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg 
versus 10 mg/kg Q3W.   The overall response rate (ORR) was 26% (21/81) in the 2mg/kg group 
and 26% (25/79) in the 10 mg/kg group (full analysis set (FAS)).   The proportion of subjects with 
drug-related adver se events (AEs), grade 3 -5 drug -related AEs, serious drug- related  
SAEs, death or discontinuation due to an AE was comparable between groups or lower in the 10 mg/kg group.    
Available pharmacokinetic results in subjects with melanoma, NSCLC, and other soli d tumor 
types support a lack of meaningful difference in pharmacokinetic exposures obtained at a given dose among tumor types.   Population PK analysis has been performed and has confirmed the 
expectation that intrinsic factors do not affect exposure to MK-3475 to a clinically meaningful 
extent.   Taken together, these data support the use of lower doses (with similar exposure to 2 
mg/kg Q3W) in all solid tumor indications.   2 mg/kg Q3W is being evaluated in NSCLC in PN001, 
Cohort F30 and PN010, and 200 mg Q3W is being evaluated in head and neck cancer in PN012, which are expected to provide additional data supporting the dose selection.  
Selection of 200 mg as the appropriate dose for a switch to fixed dosing is based on simulation results indicating that 200 mg will provide exposures that are reasonably consistent with those 
obtained with 2 mg/kg dose and importantly will maintain individual patient exposures within the 
exposure range established in melanoma as associated with maximal clinical response.   A 
population PK model, which characterized the influence of body weight and other patient 
covariates on exposure, has been developed using available data from 476 subjects from PN001.    The distribution of exposures from the 200 mg fixed dose are predicted to  considerably 
overlap those obtained with the 2 mg/kg dose, with some tendency for individual values to range slightly higher with the 200 mg fixed dose.   The slight increase in PK variability predicted for the 
fixed dose relative to weight -based dosing is not expected to be clinically important given that the 
range of individual exposures is well contained within the range of exposures shown in the melanoma studies of 2 and 10 mg/kg to provide similar efficacy and safety.   The population PK 
evaluation revealed that there was no significant impact of tumor burden on exposure. In addition, exposure was similar between the NSCLC and melanoma indications. Therefore, there are no anticipated changes in exposure between different tumor types and indication setti ngs.  
The treatment to be used in this study  is outlined below in Table 2.

a total of 9 doses  Experimental  
The MK -3475 dosing interval may be increased due to toxicity as described in Section 5. 3.4.8 (Table 4 
and 5) 
 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  30 
  
 
 A fixed dose of 200 mg/day will be administ ered as a 30 minute IV infusion every 3 weeks .  
Sites should make every effort to target infusion timing to be as close to 30 minutes as possible.  
However, given the variability of infusion pumps from site to site, a window of -5 minutes and 
+10 minutes is permitted (i.e., infusion time is 30 minutes: -5 min/+10 min).  
 
Premedication per institutional guidelines for monoclonal antibodies ( e.g. acetaminophen and 
antihistamine) is allowed. Steroid premedication is not indicated and should be avoided.  
 
 5.3.4.6 Timing of Dose Administration  
MK-3475 will be  started  on “day +14 post -transplant ” AND  “after all assessments prior to the first 
dose of MK-3475” have been completed as detailed in Table 1 and the Study  Flow Chart (Section 
6.0).   
 
The criteria to initiate the first dose of MK -3475 on day 14 i n Table 1 are NOT  required or 
applicable to 8 subsequent doses of MK -3475.  Refer to the Study  Flow Chart (Section 6.0) , 
Section 5.3.4.7  (Event of Clinical Interest (ECI) and immune -related Adverse Event (irAE)) and 
Section 5.3.4.8  (Dose Modification) for required assessments prior to and managements of 8 
subsequent doses  of MK -3475, respectively . 
  
MK-3475 may be administered up to +/- 4 days of each  dose  of MK -3475 due to clinical and 
administrative reasons.  
 MK-3475 will be administered on an outpatient basis, but may be administered during transplant 
admission as appropriate.  
 
5.3.4.7 Event of Cli nical Interest (ECI)  and immune- related Adverse Event (irAE)  
An ECI is defined as an immune -related adverse event (irAE) that is considered MK -3475 
related, after other causes  are excluded. 
 
An irAE is defined as a clinically significant AE of any organ system that is associated with MK-
3475 exposure and is consistent with an immune- related mechanism. irAEs  were reported in 
21.4% of melanoma patients; most of these events (15.8%) were considered drug- related by the 
investigator. The most commonly reported  irAEs  across the dose schedules are rash (3.2%), 
pruritus (2.9%), vitiligo (2.9%), hypothyroidism (2.7%), arthralgia (2.2%), diarrhea (2.2%), and pneumonitis (1.9%). The organ most frequently affected by irAEs with MK -3475 is the skin. Less 
frequently affected tissues include thyroid gland, colon, lung, kidney, and liver.  Severe but rare 
irAEs include Stevens -Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN)  and 
immune- mediated myocarditis.
 
  
ECI/irAEs can be categorized according to organ system s or syndromes (see the Manual 
“Pembrolizumab Program (MK -3475): Event of Clinical Interest Guidance Document”).  
 
ECI/irAEs must be reported to Merck according to the Manual “Pembrolizumab Program (MK -
3475): Event of Clinical Interest Guidance Document” within a specified time period (e.g. within 24 hours according to the Document Version most updated. See Section 7.2.3.2 for reporting 
procedure.

 5.3.4.8 Dose Modification  
 
For immune -related AEs, including immune- related hematologic AEs ( e.g. autoimmune 
hemolytic anemia, immune thrombocytopenic purpura etc.), dose modification and management 
will follow the Manual “Pembrolizumab Program (MK -3475): Event of Clinical Interest Guidance 
Document”.  
 
For non-immune -related hematological AEs ( e.g. neutropenia, thrombocytopenia etc.) dose 
modification and management will follow Table 4 below.  Determination of immune related  versus 
non-immune -related etiology is at the investigator’s discretion.  
 For SJS, TEN and immune- mediated myocarditis, see the Investigator Brochure for 
management.  
 
Recommendations to managing irAEs and any AEs not detailed in the Manual are provided in 
Table 5. (5.5.2)  
For subjects who are receiving maintenance treatment, lenalidomide will be withheld before or at 
the same time of MK -3475 withhold at the investigator’s discretion.   Determination of cause- effect 
relationship of AEs (lenalidomide versus MK -3475) is at investigator’s discretion.

5.4 Concomitant Medications/Vaccinations (allowed & prohibited)  
Medications or vaccinations specifically prohibited in the exclusion criteria are not allowed during 
the ongoing study. If there is a clinical indication for one of these or other medications or 
vaccinations specifically prohibited during the study, discon tinuation from study  therapy o r 
vaccination may be required. The investigator /Institution should discuss any questions re garding 
this with the Merck. The final decision on any supportive therapy or vaccination rests with the 
investigator and/or the subject 's primary physician.  However, the decision to continue the subject 
on study therapy or vaccination schedule requires the mutual agreement of the Investigator , 
Merck, and the subject.  
 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  32 
  
 
 5.4.1 Acceptable Concomitant Medications  
All treatments that the invest igator considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be 
administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the BMT  community standards 
of medical care.  All concomitant medication will be captured in patient medical record including 
all prescription, over -the-counter (OTC), herbal supplements, and IV medications and fluids. If 
changes occur during the study  period, documentation of drug dosage, frequency, route, and date 
may also be included on the CRF.  Only the concomitant medications taken during any SAEs or 
ECI/ i rAEs will be r ecorded on the Case Report Form (CRF) .  
 
All concomitant medications received within 28 days  before the first dose of MK-3475 (or ~14 
days prior to transplant) and 30 days  after the last dose of MK-3475 should be captured in patient 
medical record.  
 
Glucocorticoid up to an equivalent dose of prednisolone 30 mg/day for 5 days is allowed for the 
treatment of engraftment syndrome. See glucocorticoid dosing for suspected acute infusion 
reactions (see 5.5. 1 and the Manual “Pembrolizumab Program (MK -3475): Event of Clinical 
Interest Guidance Document)) and immune- related adverse reactions (see 5.5.2, 5.5.3 and the 
Manual “Pembrolizumab Program (MK -3475): Event of Clinical Interest Guidance Document). 
 
As sta ted above, any  treatments , including systemic glucocorticoid, which the investigator 
considers necessary for a subject’s welfare may be administered at the discretion of the investigator in keeping with the  BMT  community standards of medical care.  
 
Thus, inevitable systemic corticosteroid treatment for a subject’s welfare is NOT considered a 
protocol violation or deviation.  5.4.2 Prohibited Concomitant  Medications

 of the investigator in keeping with the BMT  community standards of medical care . Thus, 
inevitable systemic corticosteroid treatment for a subject’s welfare is NOT considered a 
protocol violation or deviation. 
 
• Sargramostin (Granulocyte/Macrophage -Colony Stimulating Factor: GM -CSF)  
 
• Warfarin 
• Immunotherapy  not specified in this protocol  
 
• Any c hemotherapy not specified in this protocol  
 
• Investigational agents other than MK -3475 
 
• Radiation therapy  
 
Radiation therapy to a symptomatic solitary lesion may be allowed after consultation with Investiga tor/Institution . Disease progression must be investigated accordingly.  
 
• Live vaccines within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment and while participating in the trial.  Examples of live vaccines include, but are not limited to, the following: measles, 
mumps, rubella, chicken pox, yellow fever, rabies, BCG, and typhoid (oral) vaccine. Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally killed virus vaccines and are 
allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g. Flu- Mist®) are live attenuated  
vaccines, and are not allowed.  
  
Subjects who, in the assessment by the investigator, require the use of any of the aforementioned 
treatments for clinical management should be removed from the study .  Subjects may receive 
other medications that the investigator deems to be medically necessary.  
The Exclusion Criteria describes other medications that are prohibited in this study . 
There are no prohibited therapies during the Post -Treatment Follow -up Phase.  
5.5 Rescue Medications & Supportive Care  
5.5.1 Supportive Care Guidelines  
Subjects should receive appropriate supportive care measures as deemed necessary by the treating investigator , including but not limited to, the common items outlined below:  
 
 
 
1. Diarrhea : 
Subjects should be carefully monitored for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis (such as diarrhea, 
abdominal pain, blood or mucus in stool, with or without fever) and of bowel perforation (such as 
peritoneal signs and ileus).  
 
In symptomatic subjects, standard post- transplant workup e.g. infectious etiologies must be  
performed , and if symptoms are persistent and/or severe, endoscopic evaluation should be 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  34 
  
 
 considered before the diagnosis of MK -3475- related immunologic reaction is made. Information 
on how to identify and evaluate irAEs has been developed and is included in “the Manual 
“Pembrolizumab Program (MK -3475): Event of Clinical Interest Guidance Document” located in 
the Administrative Binder.  
 
All subjects who experience diarrhea should be advised to dr ink liberal quantities of clear fluids.  
If sufficient oral fluid intake is not feasible, fluid and electrolytes should be replaced via IV infusion.  
 
2. Nausea/vomiting :  
Nausea and vomiting should be treated aggressively, and consideration should be given in 
subsequent cycles to the administration of prophylactic antiemetic therapy according to standard 
institutional practice.  Subjects should be strongly encouraged to maintain liberal oral fluid intake.  
 
3. Infections :  
Subjects with a documented or suspi cious infectious complication should receive oral or IV 
antibiotics or other anti- infective agents as considered appropriate by the treating investigator for 
a given infectious condition, according to standard institutional practice.  
 4. Immune- related adverse events:  
See Section 5. 5.2 and the Manual “Pembrolizumab Program (MK -3475): Event of Clinical Interest 
Guidance Document in the administrative binder regarding diagnosis , report  and management of 
adverse experiences of a potential immunologic etiol ogy. 
 5. Acute Infusion Reactions: 
Acute infusion reactions, which may include cytokine release syndrome, angioedema and 
anaphylaxis , are different from allergic/hypersensitive reactions, although some of the 
manifestations are common to both AEs. 
Signs and symptoms usually develop during or shortly after MK-3475 infusion and generally 
resolve completely within 24 hours of completion of infusion. 
Signs/symptoms of acute infusion reactions may include:  
- Allergic reaction/hypersensitivity (including d rug fever), r igors/chills , pruritus /itching, 
myalgia , urticaria (hives, welts, wheals)  
- Arthralgia (joint pain), f atigue  (asthenia, lethargy, malaise)  
- Rash/desquamation  
- Bronchospasm; Cough; Dyspnea (shortness of breath)  
- Dizziness  
- Headache 
- Hypertension, hypotension, t achycardia 
- Nausea/ vomiting 
- Sweating (diaphoresis)  
- Tumor pain (onset or exacerbation of tumor pain due to treatment)  
 
See the Manual “Pembrolizumab Program (MK -3475): Event of Clinical Interest Guidance 
Document for diagnosis, report and management of acute infusion reactions.  
 
5.5.2  Supportive Care Guidelines for Events of Clinical Interest (ECI) and Immune- related 
Adverse Events (irAEs)  
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  35 
  
 
  
An Event  of clinical interest (ECI) of a potential immunologic etiology (irECIs) may be defined as 
an adverse event of unknown etiology, associated with MK-3475 exposure and is  consis tent with 
an immune phenomenon.   
irAEs may be predicted based on the nature of the MK -3475 compound, its mechanism of action, 
and reported experience with other immunotherapies that have a similar mechanism of action. 
Special attention should be paid to AEs that may be suggestive of potential irAEs.   
An irAE can occur shortly after  the first dose or several months after  the last dose of treatment.  
If an irAE is suspected, efforts should be made to rule out neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxin or other etiologic causes prior to labeling an adverse event as an irAE. Information on how to 
identify and evaluate irAEs has been developed and is included in the Manual “Pembrolizum ab 
Program (MK -3475): Event of Clinical Interest Guidance Document located  in the Administrative 
Binder.  
Subjects who develop a Grade 2 or higher irAE should be discussed immediately with 
Investigator/Institution and Merck.  
**For subjects who are receiving maintenance treatment, lenalidomide will be withheld before or 
at the same time of MK -3475 withhold at the investigator’s discretion.   Determination of cause -
effect relationship of AEs (lenalidomide versus MK -3475) is at investigator’s discretion.  
Recommendations to managing irAEs not detailed elsewhere in the protocol or the Manual 
“Pembrolizumab Program (MK -3475): Event of Clinical Interest Guidance Document  are detailed 
in Table 5.

improving in 48- 72 hour s. 
 
5.5.3 Management  Guidelines for Pneumonitis  
Subjects with symptomatic pneumonitis should immediately stop receiving MK -3475 and have an 
evaluation.  The evaluation may include bronchoscopy  with bronchoalveolar lavage to rule out 
other causes such as infection.  Management, report and dose modification will follow the Manual 
“Pembrolizumab Program (MK -3475): Event of Clinical Interest Guidance Document”..  
 
**For subjects who are receiving maintenance treatment, lenalidomide will be withheld before or 
at the same time of MK -3475 withhold at the investigator’s discretion.   Determination of cause -
effect relationship of AEs (lenalidomide versus MK -3475) is at investigator’s discr etion  
 5.5.4   Diet/Activity/Other Considerations  
 
 1. Diet 
Subjects should maintain a diet  according to institutional guidelines for autologous transplant,  
unless modifications are required to manage an AE such as diarrhea, nausea or vomiting.  
 
 2. Contraception  
In general, pregnancy is a contraindication for receiving high- dose melphalan and autologous 
transplant; however, becoming pregnant after transplant is not impossible in the first 6 -12 months 
post-transplant.  
 MK-3475 may have adverse effects  on a fetus in utero . Furthermore, it is not known if MK -3475 
has transient adverse effects on the composition of sperm.  
 
Non-pregnant, non- breast -feeding women of child -bearing potential may be enrolled 1) if they are 
willing to use 2 methods of birth control until 120 days  after the planned last dose of MK -3475 or 
2) if they are considered highly unlikely to conceive. 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  37 
  
 
 Highly unlikely to conceive is defined as 1) surgically sterilized, or 2) postmenopausal (a w oman 
who is ≥45 years of age and has not had menses for greater than 2 years will be considered 
postmenopausal), or 3) not heterosexually active for the duration of the study.  
 
Subjects should start using birth control from study visit 1 (first dose of MK -3475 treatment) 
throu ghout the study period up to 120  days after the last dose of MK -3475 therapy.  
 The two birth control methods can be either   
1) two barrier methods or  
2) a barrier method plus a hormonal method to prevent pregnancy  
 
The following are considered adequate barrier methods of contraception: diaphragm, condom (by 
the partner), copper intrauterine device, sponge, or spermicide.   
 
Appropriate hormonal contraceptives will include any registered and marketed contraceptive 
agent that contains an estrogen and/or a progestational agent (including oral, subcutaneous, 
intrauterine, or intramuscular agents).  
 
Subjects should be informed that taking MK-3475 may involve unknown risks to the fetus (unborn 
baby) if pregnancy were to occur during the study .   
 
In order to participate in the study subjects  must  adhere  to the contraception requirement as 
described above for the duration of  the study and during the follow -up period defined in the section 
7.2.2 – “Reporting of Pregnancy and Lactation to t he Investigator/Institution  and to Merck” . If there 
is any question that a subject will not reliably comply with the requirements for contraception, that subject should not be entered into the study.  
 Subjects receiving standard lenalidomide maintenance therapy must strictly follow contraception requirement per lenalidomide program as a standard of care. 
 
 3. Use in Pregnancy  
If a subject inadvertently becomes pregnant while on treatment with MK -3475, the subject will 
immediat ely be removed from the study. The site will contact the subject at least monthly and 
document the subject’s status until the pregnancy has been completed or terminated.  The 
outcom e of the pregnancy will be reported to the Investigator/Institution  and to Merck without 
delay and within 24 hours if the outcome is a serious adverse experience (e.g., death, abortion, congenital anomaly, or other disabling or life -threatening complication to the mother or newborn). 
The study investigator will make every  effort to obtain permission to follow the outcome of the 
pregnancy and report the condition of the fetus or newborn to the Investigator/Institution and to 
Merck . 
 If a male subject impregnates his female partner the study personnel at the site must be inf ormed 
immediately and the pregnancy reported to the Investigator/Institution  and to Merck and followed 
as described above and in Section 7.2.2. 
 
 4. Use in Nursing Women  
It is unknown whether MK -3475 is excreted in human milk.  Since many drugs are excreted in 
human milk, and because of the potential for serious adverse reactions in the nursing infant, 
subjects who are breast -feeding are not eligible for enrollment.

5.6 Subject Withdrawal/Discontinuation Criteria  
Subjects may withdraw consent at any time for any reason or be remov ed from the study  at the 
discretion of the investigator should any untoward effect occur.  In addition, a subject may be 
withdrawn by the investigator  if enrollment into the study  is inappr opriate, the study  plan is 
violated, or for administrative and/or other safety reasons. Specific details regarding 
discontinuation or withdrawal are provided in Section 7.1.4. 
 
Subjects who complete  9 doses of MK -3475 will be considered having completed th e study 
treatment.  
 A subject must be discontinued from the study for any of the following reasons:  
• Current planned autologous hematopoieitic cell transplant does not occur.  
• The subject or legal representative (such as a legal guardian) withdraws consent.  
• Confirmed disease progression 
• Unacceptable adverse experiences as described.  
• Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment 
• Noncompliance with study treatment or procedure requirements  
• Investigator’s decision to withdraw the subject  
• The subject is lost to follow -up 
• The subject has a confirmed positive serum pregnancy test 
• Administrative reasons  
 The End of Treatment and Follow -up visit procedures are listed in Section 6 (Protocol Flow Chart) 
and Section 7.1.5 ( Study Visit Requirement s). 
 
Evaluable subjects who received at least 2 doses of MK -3475 will have End of Treatment 
Evaluation (Table 8). They will have Follow -up visit and Survival Follow -up procedures per Table 
8, starting 8 weeks after End of Treatment Evaluation.  
 
Non-evaluable subjects who received less than 2 doses of MK -3475 will not have the “Efficacy 
Assessments” or the “ Tumor Biopsies/Archival Tissue Collection/Correlative Studies” as parts of 
End of Treatment Evaluation (Table 8). They will have Follow -up visit and Survival Follow -up 
procedures per Table 8, starting 8 weeks after End of Treatment Evaluation.  
 
Non-evaluable subjects who have never received MK -3475 will NOT have End of Treatment 
Evaluation or Follow -up visit or Survival Follow -up procedures per Table 8. 
  
All subjects will be followed for disease status for at least 3 years after transplant (See Table 6: 
Study Flow Chart) or until disease progression, initiating a non -study multiple myeloma  treatment  
(except maintenance therapy as specified in this protocol), withdrawing consent  or becoming lost 
to follow -up. After documented disease progression each subject will be followed by telephone 
for overall survival until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the study, whichever occurs first. 
 
5.7 Subject Replacement Strategy
 
 The following subjects will be replaced: 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  39 
  
 
  
1. Subjects who were screened and signed consent but received less than 2 doses of 
MK-3475 (non-evaluable subjects) . 
2. Subjects who are poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements or who are 
lost to follow -up prior to the end- of-study evaluation after the completion of MK -3475 
treatment  
3. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete  
 
5.8 Clinical Criteria for Early Study Termination  
 
Early trial termination will be the result of the criteria specified below:  
 
1. Quality or quantity of data recording is inaccurate or incomplete. 
2. Poor adherence to protocol and regulatory requirements. 
3. Incidence or severity of adverse reaction indicates a potential health hazard to subjects.  
 
5.9 Plans to Modify or Discontinue the Development of the MK-3475
 
 
In the event of Merck decision to no longer supply MK-3475, ample notification will be provided 
so that appropriate adjustments to subject treatment can be made.  
 
5.10 Definition of Endpoints  
 
5.10.1 SAFTY ENDPOINTS  
  1. ENGRAFTMENT and GRAFT FAILURE  
 
 Neutrophil engraftment day  will be defined as the first day of the 3 consecutive days  (or 
of the 3 consecut ive tests for >3  day-duration)  of achieving an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 
>500/uL . 
 
 Platelet engraftment day  will be defined as the first day of the 2 consecutive days (or of 
the 2 consecutive tests for >2 day duration) of achieving platelet count >20,000/uL, without 
transfusion support.  
 
 Primary graft failure  will be defined as the inability to maintain an ANC >500/uL AND a 
platelet count >20,000 /uL, without transfusion support and without other causes, e.g. viral 
infection, other known myelosuppressive medication or multiple myeloma progression, in a 
subject who survives 35 days after transplant . 
 
 Secondary graft failure will be defined as a decline of ANC to <500 /uL after having 
engrafted that is unresponsive to growth factors, without other causes, e.g. viral infection, other 
known myelosuppressive medication or multiple myeloma progression.  
 
 2. REGIMEN -RELATED TOXICITY [RRT]  
An RTT is defined as an adverse event (AE) that occurs during the period right after the first dose 
of MK -3457 (day 14 +/- 4) until 14 days thereafter (day 28 +/-4), and is considered to be a direct 
consequence and a related event as a result of the combination of conditioning chemotherapy, 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  40 
  
 
 and MK -3475.  
 3. TREATMENT- RELATED MORTALITY  [TRM] 
TRM is defined as any death due  to the transplant procedure, including death attributable directly 
to MK -3475 therapy. Death due to, but not limited to, the following events are considered a TRM: 
general transplant complications ( e.g. infection, graft failure), RRT and Event of Clinical  Interest 
(ECI) and immune -related AEs (irAEs)..  
 
5.10.2  EFFICACY ENDPOINTS  
  1. RELAPSE / PROGRESSION  
 See Appendix 13.3 for the definitions of Multiple Myeloma Response Criteria, including 
relapse/progression.  
 2. PROGRESSION- FREE SURVIVAL [PFS]  
PFS is defined as the period from transplant day 0 to the day of the first Progression /Relapse. 
  3. OVERALL SURVIVAL [OS]  
OS is defined as the period from transplant day 0 to the day of death from any cause.  
 5.10.3        CORRELATIVE STUDIES  
 
The following cor relative studies are planned; however, failure to obtain peripheral blood 
hematopoietic stem cell graft tissue and post transplant blood samples at specified time points is 
not a study violation as these studies are not primary endpoints.  
 
5.10.3.1  Pre-transplant phenotypic analysis of autologous graft tissue  
 5.10.3.2  Quantitative ex vivo  Immune Function Recovery Assays  
1) Lymphocyte subset recovery in anti -PD-1 enhanced HDT/ ASCT  
2) Functional measurements of T cell subtypes and cytokine profiles  
3) NK cell cy totoxicity

5.10.3.3 Sample collection  
We will obtain heparinized (green top; approximately 15 mL total/sample) peripheral blood 
hematopoietic stem cell graft tissue sample on day 0 or previously frozen graft sample and 
peripheral blood samples approximately on day +14 [or before the first dose of MK-3475], day 
100± 7 post -trans plant and at early termination, if any, or day 182± 7 post -transplant  from each 
patient  for the flow cytometric study of immune recovery and ex vivo  T cell function. NK cytotoxicity 
measurements will be performed on the day +100+7 and day 182 ±7 time points using an 
additional 15 mL/patient blood draw. [Schema]  
Samples [a 15-30 mL extra blood draw each; limit to maximal volume allowed per Institutional 
Policy)] will be collected coincidently  with routine daily blood draws on the patients during 
transplant admission and clinic visits. All University of Michigan samples will be processed on  the 
day of collection. Additional samples received from the Medical College of Wisconsin will be 
shipped overnight on wet ice and processed within 24 hours of being drawn. Plasma will be 
banked and frozen for analysis of anti -PD-1 antibody titers and other parameters if indicated. 
Leukocytes will be isolated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and used for phenotypic and functional 
analyses described below.   Previously frozen graft samples will be shipped frozen.  
5.10.3.4  Flow cytometry 
Lymphocyte repopulation in peripheral blood and analysis of the peripheral blood graft tissue 
specimens will be assessed by multi- color flow cytometry using the cell surface and intracellular 
markers. For surface marker only staining, 2 ×105 PBMC will be stained with each panel and 
2×104 cells will be analyzed. Antibody panels are designed to include markers of activated T 
cells, as well as regulatory and cytotoxic T and B cell subsets. CXCR4 expression will be determined as a marker for bone  marrow homing potential. For intracellular cytokine staining, 
5×10
6 PBMC will be stimulated for 3 days with anti -CD3 and anti -CD28 with the addition of 
brefeldin A for the last 5 hours to stop cytokine release. Cytotoxic cells will be stimulated for 3 days with recombinant human IL- 2 prior to staining for intracellular granzyme B and Fas ligand 
expression. Isotype control antibody staining will be used as control for non -specific binding of 
the intracellular markers.  
 
5.10.3.5 Cytokine release  
Cytokine production by PBMC will be analyzed at all time points. Culture supernatants will be 
collected from anti -CD3 and anti- CD28 stimulated PBMC (1 ×10
6 cells/mL) after 5 days of culture. 
Phase 2 Study of Anti -PD-1 After Autologous Transplant  for Multiple Myeloma  42 
  
 
 Released cytokines will be measured by Luminex Cytokine Human 10- Plex Panel ( Life 
Technologies). This panel simultaneously quantifies GM -CSF, IFNg, IL -1b, IL -2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, 
IL-8, IL-10, and TNFa in a single sample.  
 
5.10.3.6 Quantitative PCR   
The relative presence of CD4+ TH cell subsets (T H1, T H2, T H17, and Treg) in fresh 1 million freshly 
isolated PBMC will be determined at all time points using the Human T Helper Cell RT2 Profiler 
PCR Array (Qiagen -SABiosciences).[82] This array sensitively measures the mRNA levels of 84 
genes involved in T H cell differentiation without need of ex-vivo  stimulation.  
 
5.10.3.7 Cytotoxicity assays  
Killer function of NK cells will be determined in patient samples collected on day 100+7 and day 
182+7 post-transplantation by flow cytometry.[83] Human multiple myeloma target cell lines 
(U266 and RPMI -8226) will be cocultured with CalceinAM -FITC -labeled patient PBMC for 4 hours. 
At the end of the coculture, NK cytotoxicity will be measured by labeling apoptotic cells with 7AAD 
and AnnexinV- APC and analysis by flow cy tometry.  
 
5.10.3.8 Partnering PI experience and credentials:   
 
The laboratory correlative studies will be performed in the laboratories of Steven K. Lundy, 
Ph.D. and Bryon D. Johnson, Ph.D.  
Dr. Lundy is a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Internal Medicine of the 
University of Michigan Medical School. Dr. Lundy has over 27 years of experience as a technician, trainee and faculty member working in the field of immunology research. He has a particularly 
high level of expertise in  the cellular immunological assays outlined in this proposal. Dr. Lundy 
spent the earliest parts of his career performing chromium release assays to measure NK cell cytotoxicity of tumor target cells and mixed lymphocyte reactions. He has extensive experience 
in the cloning and functional characterization of human CD4
+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as assays 
related to human prostate and lung cancer cell metastasis.[ 120,121] His doctoral work focused 
on T H cell death mediated by B cells in the S. mansoni  worm e gg granuloma model, with an 
emphasis on the role of Fas ligand- positive B cell subsets.[122 ,123] Dr. Lundy’s work continues 
to be focused on the interactions between killer lymphocytes and their targets.[124,1 25] His 
laboratory is well- equipped to compare the effects of treatment with anti -PD-1 antibodies on the 
phenotypes and functions of human T cells,[126] and the cytotoxic potential of NK cells in these 
patients. His laboratory is well -equipped to compare the effects of treatment with anti -PD-1 
antibodi es on the phenotypes and functions of human T cells,[127 ] and the cytotoxic potential of 
NK cells in these patients [128] .  
The Lundy laboratory does not have CLIA certification, and therefore, results will not be used for 
clinical diagnostics or for any purposes other than the research endpoints outlined in the 
protocol . 
Dr. Johnson is a Professor in the Department of Pediatrics at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee. His laboratory recently generated new data using an animal model that shows 
blocking PD-1- Ligand on myeloma cells can promote elimination of the myeloma cells during 
lymhodepleted state in animals that had just been treated with a low dose of whole body 
irradiation. He was a recipient of 2012 Senior Research Grant Award from  the Multiple Myeloma 
Research Foundation.

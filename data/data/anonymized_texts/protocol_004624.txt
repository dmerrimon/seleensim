Title of Study:  A Multicenter, Placebo -Controlled, Randomized, Double -Blind Study of 
the Safety and Efficacy of Merlin (ethanol and glycolic acid  mixture)  for the Episodic 
Treatment of Recurrent Herpes Labialis  
Study Centers:  There will be approximately 5 - 10 study centers.  
Publication (reference):  Not applicable  
Study Duration: Approximately 9 months  
Objectives:   The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is the clinician assessed 
duration of the classical lesion . 
Methodology:  This is a multicenter, randomized, double -blind, placebo -controlled study 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Merlin ( 10 % ethanol an d 0.6% glycolic acid) for 
the treatment of herpes labialis lesions.  Subjects who meet the eligibility requirements at the screening/randomization visit will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups: 1) twelve  ( 12) treatments with Merlin solution, administered 6  hours 
apart (up to 3 per day) over the ensuing 96 hours ( 4 days)  from the time of the first 
treatment ; or 2) twelve ( 12) treatments with  10% ethanol, as a placebo, administered 6  
hours apart (up to 3 per day) over the ens uing 96 hours ( 4 days)  from the time of the first 
treatment. Each treatment of Merlin or placebo consists of  applying the solution t hree (3) 
times, within a time period of 40  minutes or less, while allowing time for the solution to 
dry on the lesion between applications ; this will result in a total of  thirty six  (36) 
applications  over 96 hours ( 4 days) . The first treatment will be administered on 
Treatment Day (Day 0), and then repeated at  
6 and 12 hours after the first treatment, time 
permitting.

Methodology (cont.):    
 After being enrolled and randomized into the study, subjects will be sent home with a kit containing a bottle filled with either Merlin (active) or the 10% ethanol placebo solution and a packet of foam -tipped applicators sufficient to apply three  (3) study  treatments 
(nine (9) applications) . The subject will be instructed to contact the clinic by telephone at 
the first signs and/or symptoms of a recurrent herpetic episode (Stage 0, prodrome, Stage 1, erythema, or Stage 2, papule/edema ).  The lesion and lesi on stage then will be 
confirmed by telephone interview with the subject . Subjects reporting either a Stage 1 or 
Stage 2 lesion will be instructed to begin treatment immediately, thereby initiating the Treatment Phase of the study.  Subjects reporting only Stage 0 symptoms, i.e. no visible signs of a cold sore lesion, will be instructed to monitor their lesion and to call the clinic immediately upon observing any early visible signs of a cold sore, i.e. redness or swelling, representing a Stage 1 or Stage 2 lesion.  Once the subject calls in and confirms by telephone interview that their lesion has reached Stage 1 or 2, they will be instructed to begin treatment immediately. The subject will be told to continue treatment for the remainder of the day with the treatment schedule outlined above, and to continue to treat with a set of three (3) applications , three (3) times each day, for a total of twelve ( 12) 
treatments resulting in thirty -six (36) applications in total. The subject also will be 
instructed to return to the clinic within 24 hours of the initial treatment for evaluation of the stage of the herpetic lesion.  
 
Subjects will report daily for a minimum of 3 consecutive days, with the last clinic visit 
at the time  of complete healing (Stage 7 -  normal skin) or at 14 days, whichever is earlier.  
Subjects will be contacted by phone, for a safety assessment, 2 weeks after they complete 
the Treatment Phase of the study.  
Number of Subjects: Approximately four hundred and fifty (450) subjects will be 
enrolled into the study, 225 into the active treatment group and 225 into the placebo treatment group. At least 75 subjects in the active treatment group, and 75 subjects in the placebo  treatment group, will enter the Treatment Phase of the study and administer 
treatments.  
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: All enrolled subjects must be 18 to 75 
years of age. To be enrolled, he or she must also have a history of recurrent herpes  
labialis and report at least 3 recurrences during the preceding 12 months. To enter the Treatment Phase of the study, the subject must have a herpes labialis lesion assessed by the subject and confirmed by telephone contact to be at either Stage 1 (erythe ma) or 
Stage 2 ( papule /edema), and the subject must be able to report to the clinic for an initial 
lesion assessment within 24 hour of detection of first signs and/or symptoms of a herpetic 
episode.  The subject must also be able to report to the clinic for  up to 14 days.

Merlin  
Name of Active Ingredient:   
Ethanol and Glycolic Acid  
Test Product and Mode of Administration:  Merlin is the name given to a novel 
formulation intended for the treatment of topical viral infections. The formulation consists of 10% ethanol and 0.6% glycolic acid, with a pH of 2.5. A single -use, foam -
tipped applicator will be used for application to the skin . 
Duration of Treatment:  Each subject , for each set of treatments , will administer three 
(3) applications of Merlin or placebo, depending upon how a subject has been randomized, within a time period of 40 minutes or less, while allowing time for the solution to dry on the lesion between applications .  A total of twelve  (12) Merlin 
treatments, i.e. thirty -six (36) applications, will be administered over the ensuing 96 
hours ( four (4) days ), following  the time of the first treatment.  On each day, treatments 
will be administered six (6) hours apart, with a maximum of three  (3) treatments each 
day. The first treatment will be administered on Treatment Day (Day 0), and then repeated at 6 and 12 hours after the first treatment, time permitting.  
 
Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration:  The reference therapy will be 
a set of three (3) applications of 10% ethanol, applied twenty (20) minutes apart  with the 
same dosing schedule as outlined above in “Duration of Treatment.”  
Criteria for Evaluation:   The primary efficacy endpoint is the clinician assessed 
duration of the c lassical herpetic lesion .  
 Secondary efficacy endpoints are as follows:  
 
• Clinician assessed duration of the herpetic episode  
• Clinician assessed duration of complete healing of the herpetic episode  
• Clinician assessed prevention of progression to a classical lesion  
• Clinician assessed lesion size  (maximum lesion area; cumulative lesion area)  
• Clinician assessed duration of the herpetic lesion hard scab  
 Based on patient diary entries, other efficacy endpoints will be:  
• Subject assessed duration and seve rity of lesion pain 
• Subject assessed duration of the classical herpetic lesion  
• Subject assessed duration of the herpetic episode  
• Subject  assessed duration of complete healing of the herpetic episode  
• Subject  assessed prevention of progression to a classical lesion 
• Subject  assessed duration of the herpetic lesion hard scab  
  
The only safety endpoint is adverse events.

Statistical Methods:   Generally, statistical hypothesis tests will be two -tailed, and 
statistical significance will be declared when the p -value is less than 0.05. Continuous 
variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, specifically the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages.  
 All subjects who received (at least some) treatment, whether they were formally entered into the Treatment Phase of the study or applied the test material without formal authorization, will be included in the Safety Population. The safety analysis will be performed on the S afety Population.   
 All subjects who have been entered into the Treatment Phase of the study will be included in the Modified Intent to Treat (MITT) population. The MITT population will be used as the primary analysis population. All subjects who have been entered into the Treatment Phase of the study and have been followed successfully until their lesion 
healed, or until 14 days, whichever is earlier, will be included in the E fficacy E valuable 
population. The efficacy analysis will be performed on both the MITT and the E fficacy 
Evaluable populations.  
 No imputation of missing data will be performed for the efficacy analyses for the Efficacy E valuable population. 
 
The duration of the classical herpetic lesion  (both clinician and patient assessed) will be 
analyzed using the Hodges -Lehmann method as the primary efficacy analysis method for 
estimating the median difference between the two arms.  Duration of  the herpetic episode 
(both clinician and patient assessed) , duration of complete healing of the herpetic episode  
(both clinician and patient assessed) , duration of the herpetic lesion  (both clinician and 
patient assessed) , duration of the herpetic lesion hard scab (both clinician and patient 
assessed) , and duration of pain will be analyzed in the same manner as the duratio n of the 
classical lesion .  
 The proportions of subjects in each treatment group who do not display classical lesions (prevention of progression to classical lesions) will be compared using Fisher’s Exact Test.   
For pain, the maximum severity will be analyzed using the Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel 
Test to test for differences between treatment groups.

CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 2. INTRODUCTION 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC. is developing Merlin, a novel topical formulation that can be used to treat viral infections of the skin.  It is compose d of two commonly used compounds, 
glycolic acid (0.6%) and ethanol (10%), each with known safety and side effect profiles.  This product, intended for over -the-counter distribution, will consist of single treatment 
foam applicators pre- filled with the Merlin solution. 
 Approximately 20 to 40% of the adult population experience recurrent outbreaks of 
herpes labialis, or cold sores.
1  In almost all cases, the disease is due to reactivation of 
chronic, latent herpes simplex virus type 1 infection from the ganglion of the trigeminal 
nerve.  When the latent infection is activated by any one of a variety of triggers, virions 
descend throu gh the sensory nerve axons and reinfect the peripheral epithelium.  The new 
herpes labialis lesion matures within 8 hours after onset2, leaving very  little time for 
successful chemotherapeutic intervention.  
 
The current standard of care for recurrent herpes labialis involves an oral or topical 
antiviral given episodically at the onset of each recurrence. A variety of topical over -the-
counter preparat ions are available, but in most cases the mechanism of action is 
ambiguous and very few clinical trials have been performed to define their efficacy. Studies of acyclovir ointment have provided little evidence of efficacy for herpes labialis  
in immunocompe tent subjects.
3,4 Acyclovir and pencicl ovir cream -based formulation are 
both approved for treatment of herpes labialis, but while both do penetrate the skin more effectively than the acyclovir ointment, both exhibit relatively limited efficacy with regard to shortening the duration of a herpeti c episode.
5,6 Docosanol 10% cream (Abre va; 
GlaxoSmithKline) is the most well- studied over -the-counter product, with 2 randomized 
trials suggesting some efficacy of treatment.  However, because an unrelated placebo was used in these studies, the true level of efficacy cannot be objectively deter mined.
7  All 
these approved topical treatments, as well as Valtrex and Famvir, the approved oral treatments, provide, at best, approximately a one day shortening of the duration of a herpetic episode, and none of them results in a reduction in the percent of the worst outbreaks, the so- called classical lesions.  Even the most recently approved new 
treatment, Xerese, a combination of acyclovir and hydrocortisone, provides less than one day shortening of the herpetic episode, and an only slightly better, 1.5 day, decrease in the time until complete healing of the outbreak.  Xerese does claim to significantly reduce the percent of classical lesion outbreaks, but the increase in the percent of so -
called “aborted lesions” with Xerese is only modestly better than the essentially ineffective acyclovir cream (42% for Xerese versus 35% for acyclovir cream).
7  
 A pilot clinical study (Protocol TR -H-111) was performed  by the sponsor  to investigate 
the potential  skin irritancy of Merlin . The study involved the application in 40 subjects, 
of a total of thirty -six (36) treatments over four (4) days .  More specifically, each subject 
administered three (3)  applications of Merlin or placebo, depending on how a subject was 
randomized, twenty (20) minutes apart, for each set of treatments.  These sets of treatments were repeated two (2) more times at six (6) and twelve (12) hour after the start of the initial treatments, for a total of nine (9) treatments of active or placebo on Day 1.  The sets o f treatments were then re -applied three (3) times each day for three (3)

CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 additional days, resulting in the above noted total of four (4) days of treatment with 
thirty -six (36) applications  of active or placebo .  
 
On Day 1, scoring of the skin reaction w as performed at the treatment site within 5 min 
prior to each initial application in a set of 3 applications, and within 5 minutes after the third application in the set of 3 applications.   On Days 2 through 4, scoring of the 
treatment site w as performed onl y for the first set of applications, when the subject wa s in 
the clinic for the first set of test article applications.  Similarly to the timing for the 
evaluations on Day 1, scoring of the skin reaction in the treatment site was  performed 
within 5 min pri or to the initial application in the first set of 3 applications, and within 5 
minutes after the third application in the first set of 3 applications.   Skin reaction scoring 
on Day 5 w as performed at 24 hours (± 1 hour) from the time of the first treatment on 
Day 4. Any skin reaction s noted on Day 5 were to be followed either with daily clinic 
visits or telephone contacts, as deemed appropriate, until the event wa s resolved. 
 
The results of the skin irritation portion of the study revealed that all treatments were very well tolerated by all subjects, with no significant skin irritation and only a few, mild adverse events.  Minimal erythema was the most notable reaction observed immediately after treatment  in three subjects , and this resolved in all subjects  within 1 hour . The only 
other reported adverse drug related adverse event was mild burning on treatment application in one subject; this also resolved rapidly.  
 Merlin, therefore, appears to be safe as the only reported adverse events were very mild skin irritation  in three subjects and mild burning on application in one subject . 
 This was followed by Phase 2 study (TR -H-211) the primary objective of which was to 
assess the efficacy of Merlin  as compared to a placebo treatment, on the clinician 
assessed d uration to complete healing of the herpetic episode. Other endpoints included 
the clinician assessed:  1) prevention of progression to a classical lesion associated with herpes labialis; 2) duration of classical herpetic lesions; and 3) duration of the her petic 
episode.  The safety of Merlin was also evaluated.  
 A total of 469 subjects were enrolled in the study with 172 subjects actually treated.  After being enrolled and randomized into the study, subjects were sent home with a kit containing a bottle filled with either Merlin (active) or the 10% ethanol placebo solution and a packet of foam -tipped applicators sufficient to apply three study treatments (nine 
(9) applications) . The subject was  instructed to contact the clinic by telephone at the first 
signs  and/or symptoms of a recurrent herpetic episode (Stage 0 or 1, prodromal or 
erythema).  The lesion then was  confirmed by telephone interview with the subject, and 
upon confirmation of the lesion, the subject was  instructed to begin treatment 
immediately, thereby initiating the Treatment Phase of the study.  The subject was  told to 
continue treatment for the remainder of the day with the treatment schedule as described  
above  for the Phase 1 study , and to continue to treat with a set of three (3) treatments, 
three times each day, for a total of twelve (12) sets of treatments resulting in thirty -six 
(36) applications in total. The subject also was  instructed to return to the clinic within 24 
hours of the initial treatment for evaluation of the stage of the her petic lesion.  
 
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 11 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 Subjects reported daily for a minimum of 3 consecutive days, with the last clinic visit at 
the time of complete healing (Stage 7 - normal skin) or at 14 days, whichever is earlier.  
Subjects will be contacted by phone, for a safety assessmen t, 2 weeks after they complete 
the Treatment Phase of the study.  
 
The results of this study found that t welve (12) treatments with Merlin solution, 
administered 6 hours apart (up to 3 per day) over 96 hours, was generally safe and tolerable in the treatmen t of subjects with lesions associated with herpes simplex labialis. 
The majority of treatment- related AEs were classified as mild in intensity.  No treatment 
related AEs in any cohort were classified as severe.  
 
An a priori analysis found that those subjects, who treated with Merlin at first visible 
signs of a herpetic lesion, erythema, rather than immediately at first symptoms of a herpetic lesion, the prodromal stage, exhibited statistically significant efficacy as 
compared to placebo for the durati on of the classical lesion.  The same a priori analysis 
found trends towards significance for the endpoints of complete healing, duration of the 
herpetic episode, cumulative lesion size, duration of the hard scab, and the subject assessed severity of lesio n pain. 
 
This current clinical study is a follow -up Phase 2 trial using  the same Merlin formulation  
as was used in the studies described above . This trial, as the previous Phase 2 study, will 
have two treatment arms comparing the safety and efficacy of Mer lin solution  to that of a 
placebo ( 10% ethanol ) with treatment at first visible signs of a herpetic episode.   
  3. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of Merlin solution  on the 
clinician assessed duration of the classical herpetic lesion  as compared to placebo 
treatment . The duration of a classical lesion is defined as the time, in hours, from the 
beginning of treatment to the onset of Stage 6, or, if Stage 6 is never observed, Stage  7. A 
classical lesion is defin ed as one that progresses through any of the vesicle/pustule, ulcer, 
or crust stages (stages 3, 4 or 5).  
 The secondary objectives of this study are  to compare the active and placebo  treatment 
arms with regard to : 
 
 
1. The clinician assessed duration of the h erpetic episode.  For a classical lesion, 
the duration of the herpetic episode is defined as the time, in hours, from the beginning of treatment until the loss of hard crust (stage 6; residual erythema can be present after loss of hard crust). For non- classical (aborted) lesions, 
duration is defined as the time, in hours, from the beginning of treatment until complete resolution of all local signs and symptoms (stage 7).   
 
2. The clinician assessed duration until complete healing of the herpetic episode  
(class ical and non -classical lesions) as compared to placebo treatment.  For

the herpetic episode is defined as the time, in hours, from the time of 
treatment until complete resolution of all local signs and symptoms (Stage 7).   
 
 
3. The clinician assessed prevention of progression to a classical lesion 
associated with herpes labialis . 
 
4. The clinician assessed lesion size  (maximum lesion area; cumulative lesion 
area).  
 
5. The clinician ass essed duration of the herpetic lesion hard scab  (end of stage 
5/beginning of stage 6) . 
 
6. The safety of Merlin  
 
Based on patient diary entries, other objectives of this study are to compare the active and 
placebo  treatment arms with regard to :

13. Subject assessed duration and severity of lesion pain. 
 More detailed explanations of these endpoints are provided in Section 10.7.  
 
4. SUMMARY OF STUDY DESIGN  
 This current  clinical study is a Phase 2 trial using  the same Merlin formulation  as was 
used in the Phase 1 T R-H-111 and Phase 2 TR -H-211 trials .  The TR -H-111 study 
showed that Merlin appears to be safe to use even with repeated dosing over several days  
in healthy normal subjects . The Phase 2 TR -H-211 trial similarly demonstrated  that 
Merlin was generally safe and tolerable in the treatment of subjects with lesions associated with herpes simplex labialis.  TR -H-211 also revealed, in an a priori analysis, 
that those subjects who treated with Merlin at the first visible signs of a herpetic lesion, erythema, rather than immediately at first symptoms of a herpetic lesion, the prodromal stage, exhibited statistically significant efficacy as compared to placebo  for the duration 
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 13 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 of the classical lesion.  The same a priori analysis found trends towards significance for 
the endpoints of complete healing, duration of the herpetic episode, cumulative lesion 
size, duration of the hard scab, and the subject assessed severity of lesion pain.   
The present trial is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of treatment with Merlin  
as compared to treatment with placebo (10% ethanol)  in subjects treating at first visible 
signs of a herpes labialis lesion  (i.e. erythema [Stage 1]  or papule/edema [Stage 2] ).   
 
Approximately four hundred and fifty ( 450) subjects, 18 to 75 years of age, who meet the 
eligibility criteria, including a history of at least 3 recurrences of herpes labialis in the preceding 12 months, will be enrolled into the study. Eligible subjects will be randomized 
in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment groups: 1) a treatment of three (3) applications of 
Merlin solution, performed within a time period of 40 minutes or less, while allowing time for the solution to dry on the lesion between applications ; or 2) a treatment of three 
(3) applications of 10% ethanol, as a placebo, performed within a time period of 40 minutes or less, while allowing time for the solution to dry on the lesion between applications .  A total of twelve  (12) Merlin  or placebo treatments,  i.e. thirty -six (36) 
applications, will be administered over the ensuing ninety -six (96)  hours ( four (4) days ) 
after the first treatment.  On each day, treatments will be administered six (6) hours apar t, 
with a maximum of three treatments each day. The first treatment will be administered on Treatment Day (Day 0), and then repeated at 6 and 12 hours after the first treatment, time permitting.  
 After being enrolled and randomized into the study, subjects  will be sent home with a 
sealed kit containing a bottle filled with either Merlin (active) or 10% ethanol ( placebo ) 
and a packet of foam -tipped applicators sufficient to apply three  study treatments  (nine 
(9) applications) . At first signs and/or symptoms of a recurrent herpetic episode (Stage 0, 
prodrome Stage 1, erythema, or Stage 2, papule/edema), subjects will call the clinic to confirm by telephone interview, the presence of a lesion and the lesion stage.  Subjects reporting either a Stage 1 or Stage 2  lesion will be interviewed to review the eligibility 
criteria.  If they meet all the eligibility criteria they will then be instructed to begin treatment immediately, thereby initiating the Treatment Phase of the study.  Though subjects reporting a Stage 2, papule/edema, lesion will be allowed to treat, subjects should be strongly encouraged to call at the first visible signs of a herpetic lesion.  A subject observing a lesion at Stage 1, erythema, therefore, should call in immediately rather than assume t hey may wait until their lesion reaches Stage 2, papule/edema, to call 
in.  Subjects reporting only Stage 0 symptoms, i.e. no visible signs of a cold sore lesion, will be instructed to monitor their lesion and to call the clinic immediately upon observing any early visible sign of a cold sore, i.e. a Stage 1 or Stage 2 lesion.  Once the 
subject calls in and confirms by telephone interview that their lesion has reached Stage 1 or 2, and that they still meet all eligibility criteria, they will be instructed t o begin 
treatment immediately. Subjects will then be instructed to return to the clinic as soon as possible within 24 hours of starting treatment.  
 Subjects will report daily for a minimum of 3 consecutive days, with the last clinic visit 
at the time of complete healing (Stage 7 -  normal skin)  or at 14 days, whichever is earlier.  
Subjects will be contacted by phone, for a safety assessment, 2 weeks af ter they complete

CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 the Treatment Phase of the study.  Subjects will also be provided a diary that he or she 
will be instructed to fill out daily from the first day of treatment until the lesion is healed.  
 
Both treatment groups will continue to accept subjec ts into the Treatment Phase of the 
study until there are at least seventy five  (75) subjects in each group. Once the enrollment 
objectives for the Treatment Phase of the study have been met, the study will be closed to 
any further enrollment.

   5. SUBJECT SELECTION  
 5.1 Source of Subjects  
 Non-institutionalized subjects consisting of members of the community at large will be 
used in this study.  
 Approximately four hundred and fifty  (450) subjects with a history of recurrent herpes 
labialis, who meet the eligibility requirements, will be randomly assigned to one of two  
treatment groups and provided with study materials. Upon noticing visible signs of a herpes labialis lesion which meet the study criteria, the subject will call their clinical study site at which time he or she will be required to answer specific questions to confirm if he or she meets the eligibility requirements. If the subject is e ligible for entry into the 
Treatment Phase of the study, the subject will be instructed to begin treatment immediately. The study will continue until at least 75 subjects have entered the Treatment Phase in each group (Table 4 -1), at which time the study w ill be closed to any further 
enrollment.

cardiovascular purposes, during the Treatment Phase of the study. 
 5.4.3 The subject is not to mechanically disrupt the lesion (i.e. scrubbing, lancing, shaving the area, rubbing with alcohol, etc.).  
5.4.4 Merlin contains an alpha hydroxyl acid that may incr ease the skin’s sensitivity to 
the sun and particularly the possibility of sunburn.  Subjects should therefore limit sun exposure while using Merlin, and for one week afterwards. 
 A subject who does not meet one or more of the Inclusion Criteria or certain Exclusion Criteria may still be eligible for continuing in the study.  Those subjects would be instructed that they cannot be entered into the Treatment Phase of the study at that time, but must wait until their next outbreak at which time they can call in again to see if they qualify to begin the study treatment.  S ee Section 7.2.3 for further details.  
  
 MATERIALS  
 6.1 Drug Supply  
 All study materials  will be supplied by T opical Remedy, LLC  and dispensed by the clinic 
pharmacy at the study site .  
 
Test tr eatment :  
Merlin (10% Ethanol and 0.6% glycolic acid, pH 2.5)  
Placebo  treatment :  
10% Ethanol  
Merlin , or the placebo, will be supplied in 4.0 mL HDPE bottles along with single -use 
foam swabs for application to the skin.  The clinic pharmacy will be supplied preassembled Treatment kits, consisting of sealed , hinge top containers, each contain ing 
one bottle of Merlin or placebo  solution, the bottle blinded with a label noting only the 
study number, along with one (1) pouch containing nine (9 ) single -use foam swabs, 
sufficient for three (3)  treatments (9 application s).   Based upon how a subject is 
randomized, Merlin or placebo group, an appropriate Treatment kit will be assigned to 
that subject.   
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 21 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 For Visit Days 1, 2, and 3 study materials, the pharmacy will be supplied in bulk with 
pouches, each containing nine  (9) foam swabs, one for each application over the next 24 
hours . The study site will provide a new pouch of foam swabs to the subject each study 
day after the evaluation of the treatment site.  
 
6.2 Drug Identification  
 Bottles (4.0 mL HDPE), containing either Merlin or placebo , will be supplied. For 
blinding purposes, the l ot number label on the bottle will be over -labeled by the Sponsor 
with a label noting only the Study Number along with other required regulatory information. That bottle will be placed in the Treatment kit along with a supply of foam 
swabs. The pouch of foam swabs will be labeled with the Study Number, a listing of the 
contents, and the Sponsor address.  The Treatment kit will have a double tear -off label. 
The label adhering to the container will: 1) list the Study Number; 2) have a pre -printed 
Randomization Number; 3)  have a space for filling in the Subject Number associated with that Randomization Number; and 4) contain other required regulatory information 
and the Sponsor address.  The tear -off portion of the label will: 1) list the Study Number; 
2) have a pre- printed Randomization Number; 3) have a space for filling in the Subject 
Number associated with that Randomization Number; and 4) have a pre -printed lot 
number  which will be used for unblinding if necessary.   
 Randomization to a treatment group will be accomplished through a pre -determined 
sequence at each site. When  a subject is randomized, the site will assign the next 
available randomization number which corresponds to an identical Randomization Number on the label on the Treatment kit. Once assigned, the pharmacist, or designee, will complete the double, tear -off label on the container by filling in the appropriate 
Subject Number.  The tear -off portion of the label will then be removed and placed into 
the pharmacy study record.  
  As noted in Section 6.1, the site will also be supplied, in bulk, with pouches, each containing nine  (9) swabs.  The study site will provide a new pouch of foam swabs to the 
subject on Visit Days 1, 2, 3, 4 (if needed  on Days 4 and 5),  after the evaluation of the 
treatment site. As with the pouch in the Treatment kit , these pouches will be labeled with 
the Study Number and Sponsor address.   
 6.3 Drug Storage  
 All clinical trial materials should be stored at the clinical s ite at controlled room 
temperature in a limited access area.  
 6.4 Randomization  
 Approximately four hundred and fifty ( 450) subjects will be randomized into one of two 
treatment groups in a 1:1  ratio and will be assigned a sealed  kit consisting of enough 
single use swabs for three (3) treatments  (9 applications ) and either: 1)  Merlin (10% 
Protocol:  TR -H-212

CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 ethanol and 0.6% glycolic acid, pH 2.5) ; or 2) placebo ( 10% ethanol ). The randomization 
code will be generated by Topical Remedy, LLC,  or its designee.  
 
A total of  at least  one hundred and fifty  (150) of these subjects , with at least seventy -five 
(75) subjects in each group, will be instructed to administer drug upon a qualifying lesion 
outbreak.  
  6.4.1 Blinding Procedure and Code Breaks  
 The study will be  double -blinded for all treatment arms .  Only in the case of an 
emergency, when knowledge of the study drug is essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject, may the Investigator  request that a subject’s study treatment 
assignment be unbl inded.  Wherever possible the Investigator (or designee) must contact 
the Medical Monitor prior to breaking the blind.  Should it be determined that the blind needs to be broken, the Medical Monitor will contact the Vice President of Research and Developme nt at Topical Remedy  who will be able to pe rform any required unblinding. 
The Investigator must document the reason for breaking the code. The randomization 
code will be broken in order to perform the statistical analysis only after all the data of 
the stu dy have been cleaned and audited and the database locked.  
 6.5 Drug Accountability/Retention  
 Clinical Trial Material Accountability Logs must be kept current and should contain the following information:  
• Identification of the subject to whom a k it was dis pensed including 
randomization numbers and initials  
• The date a k it was dispensed to a subject  
• The date a k it was sent back to Topical Remedy.  
• The date and quantity of any disposed kits , and the initials of the person who 
disposed of the kits . 
 
The method of destruction of any used kit s will be documented in a material of 
destruction form that will be maintained in the Regulatory Binder and with the Clinical Trial Materials Accountability Log . 
 The inventory will be maintained in a limited access  area and must be available for 
inspection by the study monitor.  A clinical trial material inventory and storage facility inspection will be conducted at appropriate time intervals throughout the clinical investigation, depending on enrollment and the len gth of the study. Clinical trial material 
inventory must be current and reflect all used and unused materials.   Any discrepancy and/or deficiency must be accounted for by the Principal Investigator or designee.  
 Clinical trial materials, including unused  kits, must be returned at the end of the study to 
Topical Remedy , LLC .  Any missing supplies will be indicated on the Clinical Trial 
Materials  Accountability  Log; the original Clinical Trial Materials Accountability Log 
will be retained in the Trial Master File and a copy retained in the Investigator’s

1 To be conducted prior to dosing. At this time, subject is instructed on how to apply Merlin and given study materials to take home. If the subject comes into the clinic for screening with an already 
existing lesion that meets the study criteria, then the subject could begin treatment immediately. In that instance the Scree ning and Treatment Day  would coincide with the Visit Day 1 clinic visit. 
2 All s ubjects will be followed daily until Stage 7 , reporting  daily for a minimum of 3 consecutive days, with the last clinic visit at the time of complete healing or at 14 days, whichever is earlier.   
3  Treatment Phase eligibility criteria are checked via telephone prior to dosing.  
4 To be performed by subject. Merlin administrations will begin  on Treatment Day . Most typically, it is expected that subjects will treat outside of the clinic on Treatment Day , and come in within 24 
hours , (on Visit Day 1 ), for their first lesion evaluation.  If , however,  a subject can come in to the clinic for a lesion evaluation the same day as the ir treatment  starts , then Treatment Day  and Visit Day 
1 will coincide.  Treatme nts will continue through  at least  Visit Day s 1, 2, and 3 . If Treatment Day and Visit Day 1 are separate days, then treatment on Visit Day 4 will be administered only if the 
subject was unable to complete all three (3) sets of treatments on Treatment Day .  If Treatment Day and Visit Day 1 coincide, then treatment on Visit Day 5 will be administered only if the subject was 
unable to complete all three (3) sets of treatments on Treatment Day  (Visit Day 1) . In either instance a total of twelve (12) treatments  (36 applications)  over 96 hours from the time of the first treatment  
is the maximum duration of treatments.  
5  The first lesion scores, up until first visible signs of a herpetic lesion, are determined by the subject prior to the first treatment.  All oth er lesion scores are determined  in the clinic  by the Investigator or  
the Investigator’s  trained designee.  
6 For women with child -bearing potential. On  Treatment Day  “Pregnancy Status” will be determined by asking the subject if she is pregnant or if she ha s changed her contraceptive practice such that 
there might be a significantly increased likelihood that she could have become pregnant.  
7 Treatment Day is the first day a subject reports visible signs of a herpetic  lesion, as confirmed by telephone, and is  instructed to begin treatment. If the subject can visit the clinic that same day, 
Treatment Day  will coincide with Visit Day 1.  
8 Minimum duration of study for all subjects, i.e., three (3 ) consecutive days of clinic visits for lesion, adverse event and c oncomitant medication assessment.  
9 Treatment Day  Adverse Events will be reported to clinic at the first clinic visit on Visit Day 1.  
10  Subject s who discontinue prior to Visit Day 3 but have administered any treatment should be followed for safety until at least Visit Day 3. 
11 The follow -up (F/U) study visit for safety is to be conducted by telephone 2 weeks, or up to 3 weeks, if there are scheduling issues, af ter the subject completes the Treatment Phase of the study

CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 7.1 Screening and Enrollment Visit  
 
7.1.1 Screening  
 
The following items must be assessed and collected by the Investigator or his /her 
designee prior to enrolling the subject into the study.  
 
1. Informe d Consent . All prospective subjects will have the study explained by a 
member of the research team. The nature of the Merlin solution to be 
evaluated will be explained together with potential hazards involving allergies and possible adverse reactions to the test material.  
 Prior to enrollment into the study, acknowledgment of the receipt of this information and the subject’s freely -tendered offer to participate will be 
obtained in writing from each subject in the study using an IRB -approved 
informed consent form. The subject will be given a copy of the signed informed consent form. 
 
 
2. Enrollment Eligibility Criteria . The subject’s potential eligibility to participate 
in the study will be evaluated using the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in Secti on 5.2. 
 
3. Medical  History . A thorough medical history will be obtained including 
significant medical conditions over the previous 10 years and a subject’s 
history of herpes labialis  including the number of separate outbreak s per year  
(i.e. multiple lesions during one outbreak are counted as only a single 
outbreak) . 
 4. Physical Exam and Vital Signs
.  A baseline physical examination and vital 
signs collection should be performed with all subjects following collection of the Medical History
. 
 
5. Pregnancy Test.  All female subjects of child -bearing potential will be given 
a urine pregnancy test. 
 6
. Concomitant Medications . A determination will be made of the medications 
currently being taken by the subject.   Concomitant medications will be 
collected for the 30 days prior to enrollment into the study, the 30 days prior 
to enrollment into the Treatment Phase of the study, and throughout the Treatment Phase of the study.   For any exclusionary medications that have 
been discontinued prior to entry  into the Trea tment Phase, stop dates for those 
medications must be obtained prior to allowing the subject into the T reatment 
Phase with particular attention as to whether the medications were 
discontinued within the appropriate timeframe.   
 
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 26 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 7.1.2 Enrollment into Study  
 
The subject’s potential eligibility to participate in the study will be evaluated using the inclusion and exclusion criteria listed in Section 5.2. If the subject meets all of the 
inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria in Secti on 5.2, the subject will be enrolled 
into the study and assigned the next available Randomization Number at the study site.  
The assigned Randomization Number corresponds to an identical Randomization 
Number on the label on the Treatment kit, as described in Section 6.1, which  is to be 
allocated to the enrolled subject.  The label on the Treatment kit will include a duplicate 
tear-off label that will also have a space for entry of the Subject Number, the preprinted 
Randomization Number, and the preprinted L ot Number . This tear -off label will be 
separated from the Treatment kit  prior to dispensing to the subject, and that label will be 
placed into the pharmacy study record. The label in the pharmacy study record will 
provide confirmation  of the Randomization Number on the Treatment kit the subject was 
assigned  along with the lot number representing which group, active or placebo, into 
which the subject was randomized.  Neither t he pharmacy, nor anyone else at the study 
site, will be aware of which lot number r epresents the active and which represents the 
placebo treatment.  
 
At the time of enrollment, the subject will be trained in application of the clinical trial material  for later at -home application.  Subjects will also be provided a diary in which 
he/she will record the lesion stage, the patient assessed severity and duration of pain of the herpes lesion, and assessment of attributes as listed in Section 3. Subjects will be instructed to call in to the  clinic as soon as possible in order that they may begin 
treatment no more than 1 hour after detecting first signs and/or symptoms of an incipient herpes labialis lesion. The subject will be given training to enable them to assess the stage of their lesion  when he or she subsequently calls in to the clinical site to report a lesion 
and for completion of the diary . 
 
 
7.2 Study Treatment Phase ( Treatment Day ) 
 7.2.1 Subject Eligibility Determination  
 Immediately upon noticing first signs and/or symptoms of a herpes labialis lesion, the subject is to call in to the study clinic.  Subjects will then be questioned to determine if they in fact are experience a herpetic outbreak and, if so, the stage of the lesion.    Subjects reporting a lesion at the erythema stage (Stage 1) or the papule/edema stage (Stage 2) will then be asked to answer specific questions to confirm whether they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria described in Section 5.3 so that they may enter the Treatment Phase.  Note that while subjects  will be allowed to begin treatment at the 
papule/edema stage (Stage 2), subjects should be strongly encouraged to call in to begin treatment at the erythema stage (Stage 1), if at all possible. The clinic will also inquire about any concomitant medications taken in the last 30 days including a review of any changes in concomitant medications as reported by the subject at the time of enrollment into the study.  All exclusionary concomitant medications must have a stop date noted.  
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 27 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017  
Subjects calling in to rep ort a herpetic lesion at the prodrome stage (Stage 0) should be 
instructed to begin frequently monitoring their lesion so as to be able to call the study 
clinic again at the first visible signs of the lesion, erythema or papule/edema.  As 
mentioned above, while subjects will be allowed to treat at the papule/edema stage, they 
should be strongly encouraged to call in when their lesion reaches the erythema stage, if 
at all possible. Once subjects call in to report a visible lesion, the subjects will then be 
screened to confirm whether they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria described in 
Section 5.3 so that they may begin the Treatment Phase.  The clinic also will inquire, as 
described above, about any concomitant medications.  All exclusionary concomitant 
medications must have a stop date noted. 
 If a subject who has first called in to report a lesion at the prodrome stage has not called back to report visible signs of the lesion, the clinic should try to contact the subject by 
telephone 6 - 18 hours after the time of the initial phone contact. (Subjects should be 
contacted later the same day of their initial phone call, if possible.) If, when contacted, 
the subject reports visible signs of a herpetic lesion (Stage 1 or 2, but not a later stage), they should be screened, as described above, for entry into the Treatment Phase of the protocol.  Otherwise, if the subject is still reporting prodromal symptoms, they should be 
reminded to continue to monitor their lesion for any visible signs of the lesion or until their lesion resolves without any visible signs of a cold sore.  Should, after the first clinic 
call, the subject still not call in to report visible signs of a lesion or resolution of the episode, the clinic should continue to contact the subject by telephone every 6 -18 hours 
until the subject reports visible signs of a lesion or until the subject reports that the lesion has resolved without exhibiting any visible signs of a cold sore. If a subject does not report visible signs of a herpetic lesion within 96 hours of initially calling to report prodromal symptoms, the site may discontinue contacting the subject; the subject, however, should be instructed to contact the clinic if their lesion progresses to a visible stage or if they experience a new herpetic outbreak.  If the subject’s lesion progresses beyond stage 2 prior to, or when calling to enter the treatment phase of the study, the subject should be instructed that they no longer will be able to treat the current outbreak, but may try again, at their next lesion outbreak, to enter the treatment phase of the study.  
 7.2.2 Lesion Assessment  
 Subjects will have been trained at screening to recognize whether they are at the prodromal stage (Stage 0) , the erythema stage (Stage 1), the papule/edema stage (St age 2)  
or a more advanced herpetic stage, with particular attention to distinguishing between Stage 2 and any later stages .  Only subjects with a lesion in Stage 1 or Stage 2, the early 
visible signs of a herpetic outbreak, will be entered into the Treatme nt Phase of the study 
and therefore allowed to treat themselves.  Subjects reporting a more advanced herpetic lesion, beyond Stage 2, will be instructed that they are still in the study but must wait until their next lesion outbreak before again calling in to attempt to enter the Treatment Phase of the study.  Subjects reporting a lesion in the prodromal stage, Stage 0, will be instructed to monitor their lesion for first visible signs of a cold sore, and followed as described above.  If a subject has two o r more distinct lesions, the subject will treat the 
first lesion that appeared as long as it has not progressed beyond Stage 2.  If any lesions 
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 28 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 have progressed beyond Stage 2, as noted above, the subject will be instructed to wait 
until their next outbreak before calling to enter the Treatment Phase of the study.   
 
 
7.2.3 Entry into Study Treatment Phase  
 
If a subject has met all the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in Section 5.3, and 
has a herpes labialis lesion in Stage 1 or Stage 2, the subjec t will then be allowed into the 
Treatment Phase of the study and instructed  to open the Treatment kit containing the 
study material  and begin treatment . The subject will be asked to schedule their Visit Day 
1 clinic visit for later that day, if possible; o therwise the visit must be scheduled as early 
as possible the following day anytime within 24 hours  of the time at which a subject calls 
and is allowed to enter the Treatment Phase of the study.  
 
A subject who does not meet one or more of the Inclusion Cri teria (Section 5.3.1), or 
certain Exclusion Criteria (specifically Treatment Phase Exclusion Criteria # 1 - #5; 
Section 5.3.2) may still be eligible for continuing in the study.  Those subjects will be 
instructed that they cannot be entered into the Treatment Phase of the study at that time, but must wait until their next outbreak at which time they can call in again to see if they 
qualify to begin the study treatment.  The list of those criteria where subjects who do not meet those criteria can still  participate in the study, but must defer their entrance into the 
Treatment Phase until their next cold sore recurrence, is provided below:  
 
• The subject reports a lesion stage later than Stage 2  (Treatment Phase Inclusion 
Criterion #1). 
 
• A female subject i s not using a medically acceptable form of birth control 
(Treatment Phase Inclusion Criterion #2).  In this instance, the subject will be instructed to return to the clinic for another pregnancy test.  Once that test is shown to be negative, the subject wi ll be told to resume proper contraception and 
can then call in again at the next lesion outbreak. 
 
• The subject does not have immediate access to the clinical trial material kit (Treatment Phase Inclusion Criterion #3).   In this case they will be asked to call again when he or she has the kit at hand. At the time of their second phone call they also will be asked again about the stage of their lesion to be certain that the lesion has not progressed beyond Stage 2.  
 
• The subject cannot appear for a clinic vis it within 24 hours from the time of 
enrollment into the Treatment Phase of the study  (the time of the subject’s call to 
establish entry into the Treatment Phase of the study) , or is unable to return to the 
clinic daily for the full 14 day duration of the s tudy if necessary (Treatment Phase 
Inclusion Criterion #4).  
 
• The subject has any evidence of active malignancy  or immunodeficiency  disease 
within the last 30 days ( Treatment Phase Exclusion Criterion # 1). As also noted in 
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 29 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 Exclusion Criterion # 1, subjects who have completed therapy and are considered 
unlikely to relapse or who have had surgery and do not have any evidence of 
disease, are eligible for the study and therefore could begin the study treatment 
provided they meet all other inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
 
• A subject has used topical steroids on or near the face or systemic (oral, 
intravenous) steroids within the last 30 days ( Treatment Phase Exclusion Criterion 
#2). As also noted in Exclusion Criterion #2, use of inhaled steroids does not 
exclude a subject from the study; such subjects, providing they meet all other 
criteria, can be entered into the Treatment Phase of the protocol.  
 
• A subject has used an NSAID within the last 12 hours of calling the clinic to report the lesion (Treatment Phase Exclusion Criterion #3).  
 
• A subject has used an investigational drug and/or device within the last 30 days 
(Treatment Phase Exclusion Criterion # 4). 
 
• A subject has used any anti -viral drug, or any other medication, including home 
remedies, intended to treat c old sores (e.g. lysine, tea tree oil, honey) within the 
last 30 days, or used any topical medication to treat the current active herpes 
simplex labialis lesion (Treatment Phase Exclusion Criterion # 5).  
 Except for those Treatment Phase Exclusion Criteria noted above, specifically #1 -  #5, a 
subject meeting any of the other exclusion criteria will no longer be able to participate in the study and he or she will be asked to report to the clinic in order to return their seal ed 
kit. 
 7.2.4 Drug Administration  
 Each subject , upon entering the Treatment Phase of the study , will be instructed to treat 
their lesion immediately using  the solution and single -use applicators in the Treatment 
kit. The subjects, according to the randomization scheme, will begin self -administration 
of the  application s of either Merlin  or placebo solution . Treatment Day  is the first day  of 
treatment for all subject s.  
 At the time of the subject’s call to enter the Treatment Phase of the study, the clinic should review the method and schedule of treatment applications with the subject.    For the first and all subsequent treatments, e ach subject will administer three (3) 
applications of Merlin or placebo, depending upon how a subject has been randomized, performed within a time period of 40 minutes or less, while allowing time for the solution to dry on the lesion between applications .  A total of twelve  (12) Merlin or placebo 
treatments, i.e. thirty -six (36) applications, will be administered over the ensuing 96 
hours ( 4 days)  from the time of the first treatment.  On each day, treatments will be 
administered six (6) hours apart  (± 1 hour) , with a maximum of three treatments each 
day. The first treatment will be administered on Treatment Day (Day 0), and then repeated at 6 (± 1 hour) and 12 hours  (± 1 hour)  after the first treatment, time permitting.  
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 30 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017  
Subjects who, upon self -examination outside of the clinic, or upon evaluation in the  
clinic, are found to have herpetic lesions that have reached the ulcer/soft crust stage  
(Stage 4) should be instructed to discontinue all remaining treatments. If the observation 
of the lesion reaching Stage 4 is made by the subject outside of the clinic, the subject 
should call into the clinic as soon as possible after making this observation to confirm the 
accuracy of their assessment and to report the event.  
 
Subjects who are unable to begin treatment for any reason , aside from those listed in 
Section 7.2.3, are to be discontinued from the study; those subjects are to return to the clinic to turn in their clinical trial materials  and are not to be followed for safety or 
efficacy.  Subjects , though, who are able to complete any part their treatment,  even only a 
single application of the solution to the face, are to continue to participate in the study as 
planned, including appearing for all safety and lesion assessment  clinic visits .  
 7.2.5 Subject Diaries  
 Each subject will be instructed to record into their diaries the date and time of their first treatment , the stage of their lesion, and his or her assessments of pain as described in this 
section.  The recording of the assessments of lesion stage and pain level are to be done three times per day, just prior to initiation of each treatment  (i.e. just prior t o the first 
application in a set of three (3) applications ). After the course of treatment is completed, 
assessment  of lesion stage and pain level will continue 3 times daily  with approximately 
6 hours in between each assessment  until the lesion is healed.  The subject will also be 
instructed to bring the diary to each office visit so that the Investigator or trained designee can review it.    7.2.5.1 Pain Assessment  
 At the time of the subject’s call to enter the Treatment Phase of the study, the clinic wil l 
ask the subject to provide the time of the onset of any pain caused by the herpes lesion to be treat ed along with the severity of any lesion pain. 
 The severity of lesion pain will be based on the following rating scale:  
 
1 = None  No pain 
 2 = Mild  Pain is present in such a way that the subject is only vaguely aware of it and it does not interfere with daily activities  
 3 = Moderate  The subject is aware of pain at all times, but it does not interfere with daily activities  
 4 = Severe  Level of discomfort o f pain is such that it interferes with daily 
activities.  
 
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 31 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 As noted in Section 7.2.5, the subject will also record in the diary, just prior to each 
treatment , the severity of any lesion pain.  After the course of treatment is completed, 
assessment of pain level will continue 3 times daily with approximately 6 hours in 
between each assessment until the lesion is healed.  
 
 
 
7.3 Follow -up Visits ( Visit Days 1- 14) 
 
Each subject entered into the Treatment Phase of the study is to come in for an office 
visit every day , (preferably about the same time of day each day, if possible), following 
treatment  until the clinician or trained designee determines that the treated lesion has 
reached Stage 7 , up unt il at least Visit Day 3 and at most until Visit Day  14. As subjects 
might call any time of the week, and the Treatment Phase of the study could last as many 
as 14 days, clinics must be staffed with personnel , trained in lesion assessment, 7 days a 
week. Ev ery effort should be made to get the subject to come to all their study visits. If a 
subject misses a visit, the study clinic visits still end for them on Visit Day 3 if their 
lesion has reached Stage 7 by then, or on the day their lesion reaches Stage 7, or Visit 
Day 14, whichever comes  first.   
 
7.3.1 Clinical Lesion Assessment  
 When possible, clinical lesion assessment of a subject should be performed by the same evaluator on each day. If the same lesion evaluator  cannot perform all the lesion 
assessment s for a given subject,  the person taking over the lesion assessment of that 
subject  should observe the lesion with the previous assessor to ensure they are in 
agreement with the stage.  (The name(s) of any clinical staff member(s) involved in the 
evaluation of a given subject’s lesion stage for that day should be noted in the subject’s source documents.)   The Investigator , or trained designee, acting as the lesion evaluator , 
will mark , on the first clinic visit, the location of the treated lesion on a facial diagram 
included in the subject’s source records and will score the lesion on each subject at each 
visit.  A trained designee should be a member of the clinical personnel who is a 
dermatologist/ physician or someone with a clinical background with the ability to evaluate the stages of a herpetic lesion.  
   The herpes lesion treated by the subject will be considered part of the primary recurrence for evaluation.  Any other herpes lesions  that appear within 10 mm of that first lesion , on 
the same calendar day , will also be considered part of the primary lesion complex .  All 
other lesions located at least 10 mm from the first lesion , or occurring within 10 mm of 
the first lesion on any other day after the day of the first lesion outbreak, will be defined as secondary lesions.  Only lesions within the primary lesion complex will be scored for lesion staging for efficacy analysis.   Secondary lesions will not be scored for lesion 
staging.  If the Investigator determines that secondary lesions are typical for a given subject, then the observation of such secondary lesions in that subject need not be captured in the CRF.  If, however, the Investigator concludes that secondary lesions are not usual for a given subject, then the observance of a secondary lesion in that subject may be captured and followed as an Adverse Event.  
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 32 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017  
 
  
The lesion scores are defined as follows:  
 
0. Prodrome  
1. Erythema  
2. Papula/edema  
 3. Vesicle/pustule  
 4. Ulcer /soft crust  
5. Hard crust  
6. Residual swelling/dry flaking 
7. Normal skin 
 Classical lesions are those lesions that pass through Stages 3, 4 or 5 at any lesion assessment.  Non -classical  (aborted)  lesions are lesions  that never pass through Stages 3, 
4, or  5 prior to healing at Stage 7.   
 
A herpetic lesion typically progresses t o higher level stages and therefore would not be 
expected to proceed from a higher number stage to a lower number stage.  The exception to this would be the case where a subject has a Stage 5, hard crust, lesion in which the scab is inadvertently knocked off, e.g. while washing.  In that instance, the lesion would “go backwards” from a Stage 5 lesion to a Stage 4. This expected progression of the herpetic lesion should be kept in mind as a guideline in the evaluation of the lesion stage.  Any time, therefor e, a lesion is observed to “go backwards ,” a note should be made in the 
CRF as to why, if the reason can be determined, the lesion reversed its progression.  The study clinic visits end for a subject when (1) the treated lesion is no longer present 
(Lesion  Stage 7 for both classical and non- classical lesion s) and there have been clinic 
assessments every day up until at least Visit Day 3, or (2) at Visit Day 14, whichever 
occurs earlier.   
 7.3.2   Diary Review  
 At each clinic visit, the investigator, or trained designee, will assess the subject’s cold sore lesion before reviewing entries in the diary.  In reviewing the diary, the investigator, or trained designee, will review the subject assessments for consistency and completeness.  Should any apparent error s or incomplete entries be found in the diary, the 
subject will be informed of these issues, and instructed as to how to properly complete the diary in the future; no retroactive changes, though, are to be made in the diary.  Any blanks that should have be en completed prior to the clinic visit should be marked by the 
diary reviewer, so as to prevent later completion, and initialed and dated by the reviewer.  
   
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 33 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 7.3.3 Lesion Size Assessment  
 
At each clinic visit, the Investigator, or trained designee, will use a disposable ruler, supplied by the sponsor, to measure the lesion size .  Two measurements will be taken : 1) 
the length of the longest dimension of the lesion; 2) the maximum length of the lesion dimension perpendicular to the axis of the first measure ment taken.  
 7.3.4 Pain Assessment  
 
At each clinic visit, the Investigator, or trained designee, will review the subject entries in 
the diary. In reviewing the diary, the Investigator, or trained designee, will inspect the 
subject entries for timing of dos ing and pain assessments with regard to consistency and 
completeness. Should any apparent errors or incomplete entries be found in the diary, the 
subject will be informed of these issues, and instructed as to how to properly complete 
the diary in the futur e; no retroactive changes, though, are to be made in the diary.  Any 
blanks that should have been completed prior to the clinic visit should be marked by the 
diary reviewer, so as to prevent later completion, and initialed and dated by the reviewer.  
 7.3.5 Safety Assessments 
 The subjects will be questioned concerning their well -being at the time of each clinic 
visit. Questions will be posed in a non- specific manner so as not to bias the response. The 
subjects will also be instructed to inform the study phy sician and/or nurses of any adverse 
events that may occur at any time during the study.  O n Visit Day 1 the subject should be 
asked  about any adverse events occurring since treatment  on Treatment Day , so as to 
capture any adverse events that took place since their treatment.   Subjects who 
discontinue prior to Visit Day 3 but have administered any treatment must be followed 
for safety , by telephone or clinic visits, as deemed appropriate by the Investigator, until at 
least Visit Day 3.  
 
7.3.5.1 Pregnancies  
 Any subject who becomes pregnant during the course of treatment will be instructed to immediately stop all treatments and will be discontinued from the study.  Also, any subject who becomes pregnant  in the two week period following their completion of the  
treatment phase of the study , or their discontinuation from the study (for reasons other 
than pregnancy), will be instructed to contact the clinic to report the pregnancy.  All 
treated study subjects who report a pregnancy during the course of the trial will be 
followed during the course of their pregnancy by the study doctor  to determine the 
outcome of the preg nancy . 
 7.3.6 Concomitant Medications  
 The identity of all concomitant medications taken 30 days prior to enrollment into the study, 30 days prior  to enrollment into the Treatment Phase of the study, and during the 
Treatment Phase of the study, as well as their total daily dose, duration of use, and 
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 34 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 indication for use, will be reported on the case report form (CRF ).  Any possible 
exclusionary medication must have a stop date prior to eligibility for treatment.  
 
7.3.7 Subject Return of Unused Test Material to the Clinic  
 All subjects will be instructed to return their Treatment kit, with any unused test materials , to the clinical site  on whichever is the first clinic visit following completion of 
all their treatments. The subjects should have disposed of the used swabs  at home.  
 At the conclusion of the study, those subjects who have been enrolled, but never entered the Treatment Phase of the study, wi ll be contacted and asked to return their unused 
Treatment kit. Should a subject not return their clinical trial material when requested, at least one additional phone call should be made, and, if necessary, a certified letter should 
be sent to request return of those materials. If these efforts are unsuccessful the subject’s clinical trial materials will be considered missing. The return of both used  study solution 
bottles  and unused clinical trial materials is important with regard to drug accountability.  
 Study subjects who have entered the Treatment Phase of the study and administered their 
lesion treatment, will be offered compensation for bringing in their used clinical study 
solution bottle after completion of all their study treatments . This incen tive is important 
as the immediate return of the materials to the clinic will minimize loss or misuse .  Those 
subjects who forget to bring in their used clinical materials immediately after completion 
of all their study treatments  will be offered a lower compensation to return the materials 
at a later date.  Those subjects who were enrolled  into the trial but did not enter the study 
Treatment Phase will be offered compensation for the return of all unused clinical trial materials at the termination of the s tudy.   
 7.4 Follow- Up Telephone Assessment  
 Two weeks , or up to 3 weeks, if there are scheduling issues,  after the subject has 
completed the Treatment Phase of the study (complete healing of the herpetic episode or Visit Day 14, whichever is earlier) the clinic will contact the subject by phone for a final safety evaluation.   Any new adverse events that have occurred since the subject’s last 
clinic visit should be collected at this time.  
  
 ADVERSE EVENTS  
 All adverse events occurring during the Treatment Phase of this clinical trial will be recorded on the case report form provided. Adverse events occurring before the onset of treatment will be classified as non- treatment emergent adverse events and will not be 
captured on the CRF. Adverse events occurring after the application of study treatment will be assigned as treatment emergent adverse events  and will be recorded on the CRF. 
The Investigator will review each event and assess its relationship to the treatment (not related, unlikely, possible, probable and highly probable). The following definitions will be used for rating relationship to treatment:  
 
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 35 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 • Not related – The event is clearly related to other factors such as the subject ’s clinical 
state, ther apeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to the 
subject . 
• Unlikely – The event was most likely produced by other factors such as the subject ’s 
clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications administered to 
the su bject ; and  does not follow a known response pattern to the investigational 
product. 
• Possible – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational product administration; and/or  follows a known response pattern to 
the study tr eatment; but  could have been produced by other factors such as the 
subject ’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications 
administered to the subject . 
• Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of 
investigational product administration; and  follows a known response pattern to the 
investigational product; and  cannot be reasonably explained by other factors such as 
the subject ’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications 
admini stered to the subject . 
• Highly Probable – The event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from the time of investigational product administration; and  follows a known response pattern to 
the investigational product; and cannot be reasonably explained by ot her factors such 
as the subject ’s clinical state, therapeutic interventions, or concomitant medications 
administered to the subject ; and  either occurs immediately following investigational 
product administration, or  improves on stopping the investigational  product, or  
reappears on repeat exposure, or  there is a positive reaction at the application site.  
 
Each adverse event reported will be graded on a 3 -point severity scale (mild, moderate, or 
severe) and the date and time of onset, time relationship to tre atment , duration, and 
outcome of each event will be noted on the case report form.  
 The following definitions for rating severity will be used:  
• Mild – easily tolerated, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with normal everyday activities.  
• Moderate – sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.  
• Severe – incapacitating and/or prevents normal everyday activities.  
 
If any of the above adverse events are serious, as defined by the FDA Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) , Title  21, special procedures will be followed. All serious adverse 
events will be reported within 24 hours by fax or e -mail to the Drug Safety Group  at 
(866) 857- 8839, whether or not the serious events are deemed treatment -related. The

CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 Drug Safety Group  will notify Topical Remedy’s  Vice President of Clinical Research  of 
the serious adverse event.  All serious event reporting will adhere to 21 CFR 312.32 for 
IND drugs. The central IRB and other study sites will be notified by Topical Remedy, 
LLC  of the Alert Reports per FDA regulations.  Sites using their own institutional IRB 
will be instructed by Topical Remedy, LLC  to notify their institutional IRB  of the Alert 
Report . 
 The following is the definition for serious adverse events per FDA regulat ions:  
 
A Serious Adverse Event is any adverse drug experience occurring at any dose that 
results in any of the following outcomes:  death, a life -threatening adverse drug 
experience, in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of hospitalization, a persiste nt or 
significant disability/incapacity, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect. Important medical events that may or may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization 
may be considered a serious adverse drug experience when, based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may jeopardize the subject or subject may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.   If a serious adverse event occurs to a subject on this study, the Investigat or will complete 
the SAE form provided and fax it, along with the front cover sheet provided, to the Drug Safety Group at (866) 857- 8839.  The Medical Monitor  will be responsible for ensuring 
completeness of the SAE form and for reviewing the SAE versus source documentation and the CRF.   
 
Once the SAE form is complete, the Medical Monitor  will forward it, by email,  to the 
Vice President of Clinical Research at Topical Remedy  (email: emorrel @benubio.com ; 
fax: 508- 651-3703)  for review .  The Vice President of  Clinical Research  will send any 
comments to Drug  Safety.  Drug Safety will track the SAE information and forward a 
desk copy of the complete SAE report to Topical Remedy, LLC .  
  
Adverse events, whether serious or non- serious, will be followed to resoluti on or until the 
condition stabilizes, is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow -up, up to a 
maximum of 30 days following the subject’s last clinic visit. Adverse events, whether serious or non- serious, will be captured up to 2 weeks following the last clinic visit, and 
followed up to a maximum of 30 days following the subject’s last clinic visit. Where appropriate, medical tests and examinations will be performed to document resolution of event(s). Outcome may be classified as resolved, improved, unchanged, worse, fatal, or unknown (lost to follow -up). Following the resolution of any study associated adverse 
events or after the completion of the Treatment Phase of the study, there will be no further adver se event reports for that subject.  
 While pregnancy itself is not considered to be an AE, any pregnancy complication or elective termination of a pregnancy for medical reasons will be recorded as an AE or SAE (as appropriate).  A spontaneous abortion is al ways considered to be a SAE.

 REMOVAL OF SUBJECTS FROM STUDY  
 
Subjects will be advised that they are free to withdraw from the study at any time  without 
consequence . The Investigator may remove a subject if he/she feels this action is in the 
best interest  of the subject. When a subject withdraws from the study after treatment , all 
of the necessary safety and tolerability assessments should be obtained if possible. Subjects experiencing adverse events should be followed until the event has resolved or until the condition stabilizes, is otherwise explained, or the subject is lost to follow-up, up to a maximum of 30 days following the subject’s last study visit. Appropriate supportive and/or definitive therapy will be administered as required. As with other su bjects in this 
study, compensation will be offered for return of a used or unused study kit. 
 
Subjects withdrawn from this study cannot re-enter or be used as replacements for other subjects in this study.  
  
 STATISTICAL METHODS  
 10.1 Introduction 
 This trial will be conducted to test the superiority of the Merlin solution  to placebo 
solution in the treatment of recurrent herpes labialis at first visible signs  and/or symptoms 
of a herpetic lesion.  The primary efficacy endpoint for the study will be the clinician assessed duration  of the classical herpetic lesion.  The duration of a classical lesion is 
defined as the time, in hours, from the beginning of treatment to the onset of Stage 6, or, if Stage 6 is never observed, Stage 7. A classical lesion is  defined as one that progresses 
through any of the vesicle/pustule, ulcer, or crust stages (stages 3, 4 or 5). Duration of the classical herpetic lesion  will be analyzed using the Hodges -Lehmann method as the 
primary efficacy analysis method for estimating  the median difference between the two 
arms.  Duration of the herpetic episode, duration of complete healing of the herpetic 
episode, duration of the herpetic lesion , duration of the herpetic lesion hard scab, and 
duration of pain will be analyzed in the same manner as the duration of the classical 
lesion .

 10.2.2 Safety Endpoints  
 
• Adverse events (AEs)  
 10.3 Study Populations  
 10.3.1 Safety Population  
 All subjects who have been entered into the Treatment Phase of the study and self -
administered any  treatment will be included in the safety population. A subject will be 
included in a treatment group for analysis based upon the treatment actually administered, rather than the group to which he or she has been assigned. For example, a subject who is randomized to receive placebo treatments but inadvertently receives active treatment  will be included in the group receiving active treatment .  
 Should a subject gain access to their clinical trial materials and treat themselves without 
having called in to the clinic and been given permission to open their Treatment kit , that 
subject will also be included in the safety population if follow -up safety data are 
available.  
 10.3.2 Efficacy:  Modified Intent -to-Treat (MITT) Population  
 All subjects who have been entered into the Treatment Phase of the study will be included in the MITT population. It is considered a “modified” intent to treat population in that it does not include all randomized subject s but includes only those randomized 
subject s who access their t reatment, i.e., are told to open the ir kit. The MITT population 
will be used as the primary analysis population. A subject will be included in a treatment group for analysis based upon the treatment to which he or she has been assigned.  
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 39 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017  
10.3.3 Efficacy Evaluable (EE) Population  
 
All subjects who have been entered into the Treatment Phase of the study  were reported 
to have successfully completed treatment , and have been followed successfully until their 
lesion heal s, or until 14 days, whichever is earlier, will be included in the efficacy 
evaluable population. Prior to breaking the study blind, study data will be reviewed to determine which subjects need to be excluded from the efficacy evaluable population. A subject will be included in a treatment group for analysis based upon the treatment 
actually administered, rather than the group to which he or she has been assigned.  For 
example, a subject who is randomized to receive a placebo treatment but inadvertently 
receives an active  treatment will be included in the group receiving an active treatment, 
and vice versa.  Only actual observations will be included in the analyses; no imputation 
for missing data will be performed.  
 
10.4 General Methodology 
 All statistical tests will be d one using two- sided tests and a Type I error rate of 0.05.  
 
Data listings will be based on all subjects in the safety population.   Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics, specifically the mean, median, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values. Categorical variables will be summarized by frequencies and percentages.   The primary analyses  will compar e the active treatment arm to  the placebo control arm. 
Aside from any placebo effect, there should be no efficacy associated with the placebo solution.  As a secondary analysis, all statistical comparisons will be performed with the treated subjects stratified based on whether they treated at erythema (Stage 1)  or 
papule/edema (Stage 2) . 
 10.5 Baseline Demographics  
 Baseline demographic information will be summarized for the safety population. For continuous variables, summary statistics  (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, 
and maximum)  will be provided. For categorical variables, the frequency and percent in 
each category will be presented .  
 10.6 Safety and Tolerability Analysis  
 The safety analysis will be performed on the safety population. Assess ment of safety and 
tolerability will be based on adverse events. Each AE will be graded with respect to its relationship to treatment using five categories:  not related, unlikely, possible, probable, and highly  probable . Each AE will also be graded on a three -point severity scale:  mild, 
moderate, and severe. Adverse events will be coded by body system and preferred term using the MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities) dictionary.  
 
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 40 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 The number and percenta ge of subjects experiencing adverse events will be tabulated for 
each treatment group by body system and preferred term. The number and percentage of 
subjects experiencing AEs will also be tab ulated by relationship to drug treatment and by 
severity. If an AE is reported more than once for a subject, only the most related event 
will be counted in the analysis by relationship to drug treatment. For the analysis by severity, if an AE is reported more than once for a subject, only the most severe event 
will be counted in the analysis.  
 
10.7 Efficacy Analysis  
 The efficacy analysis will be performed on both the MITT and the efficacy evaluable 
populations.  For all duration endpoints the following matrix will be used for analyses:  
 
Population  Analysis  Description  Methods  
MITT  Main 
Analysis  Impute duration for subjects 
who drop out prior to healing 
with a duration of 336 hours (14 
days x 24 hours).  Hodges -Lehmann 
estimation methods ; 
Wilcoxon rank sum test to 
compare arms  
 Sensitivity 
Analysis  Subjects who drop out prior to 
healing will be considered 
censored.  Kaplan -Meier estimation 
methods; Log -rank test to 
compare arms  
EE Main 
Analysis  No imputation required since 
these are complete cases.  Hodges -Lehmann 
estimation methods; Wilcoxon rank sum test to 
compare a rms 
For all endpoints on the occurrence of prevention of progression, counts and percentages 
will be summarized , and chi -square tests, or Fisher’s exact test will be used  to compare 
arms , as appropriate.  Fisher’s exact tests will be used if any of the ex pected cell counts 
in the RxC crosstabulations are less than 5.  
 For size endpoints, means, medians, standard deviations and ranges will be summarized. T-tests will be used to compare arms if the sizes are approximately normally distributed, 
or Wilcoxon ra nk sum tests will be used if the sizes are markedly non- normally 
distributed.  For the severity endpoints, counts and percentages will be summarized, and Cochran-  
Mantel -Haenszel tests will be used to compare the arms.  
 In order to assess whether there are differences among centers in treatment effects, a Cox proportional hazards model analysis of the duration of herpetic episode will also be performed for the primary duration endpoint and for both the MITT and EE populations.  The model will include terms for treatment, center, and treatment by center interaction. A test will be performed to test for the significance of the interaction. This test will be conducted at the 0.10 level of significance. If the interaction is found to be significant, estimates of  treatment effect will be provided by center, as well as overall.

CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 10.7.1 Duration of Classical Lesions  (clinician and patient assesse d) 
 
A classical herpetic lesion is defined as one that passes through any of Stages 3, 4 or 5 (vesicle/pustule, ulcer/soft  crust, or hard crust). Therefore, all aborted lesions will be 
excluded from this analysis. The duration of a classical lesion is defined as the time, in hours, from the beginning of treatment to the onset of Stage 6, or, if Stage 6 is never 
observed, Stag e 7.  
 
  
 
10.7.2 Duration of Herpetic Episode (clinician and patient assessed)  
 Duration of herpetic episode is measured by assessment of treated lesion stage daily up until Stage 6 for classical lesions or Stage 7 for non- classical lesions for a maximum of 
14 days, with a minimum of 3 consecutive days of assessment. For a classical l esion, the 
duration of the herpetic episode is defined as the time, in hours, from the beginning of treatment until the loss of hard crust (Stage 6, residual erythema can be present after loss of hard crust). A classical lesion is defined as one that progr esses through any of the 
vesicle/pustule, ulcer/soft crust, or hard crust stages (stages 3, 4 or 5). For non- classical 
lesions, duration of herpetic episode is defined as the time from the beginning of treatment until complete resolution of all local signs  and symptoms (Stage 7).  
    10.7.3 Duration until Complete Healing of the Herpetic Episode (clinician and 
patient assessed)  
 Duration until complete healing of the herpetic episode is defined as the time, in hours, from the beginning of treatment to the onset of Stage 7, for both classical and non-classical lesions.  All s ubjects will visit the clinic daily, for a minimum of 3 days and a 
maximum of 14 days, until the lesion reaches Stage 7 with no signs or symptoms of a herpetic lesion.  
   10.7.4 Prevent ion of Progression to Classical Lesions (clinician and patient 
assessed)  
 A classical herpetic lesion is defined as one that passes through any of Stage s 3, 4 or 5 
(vesicle/pustule, ulcer /soft crust,  or hard crust). Prevention of progression to classical 
lesions will be analyzed by comparing the proportions of subjects in each treatment group 
who do not display classical lesions. (These are considered aborted lesions.)    10.7.5 Clinician Assessed Lesion Size 
 For each subject, the subject’s maximum lesion area (length x width) for ulcerative lesions during the vesicular, ulcerative, and hard crust stages will be determined.   In 
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 42 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 addition,  the cumulative lesion area, for which ulcerative lesion areas, day by day, will 
be added. Last, the cumulative lesion ar ea “all lesions” will be determined; for this 
parameter, all patients will be included (i.e . both ulcerative and non- ulcerative 
recurrences).  
 
10.7.6 Duration  of the Herpetic Lesion Hard Scab  (clinician and patient assessed)  
 Duration of the hard scab wil l be defined as the assessed duration of the hard crust, stage 
5, for all subjects experiencing known classical lesions.  This duration will represent the 
onset of stage 5 until the time of classical lesion healing at stage 6 or 7, whichever occurs 
earlier .  Only known classical lesions will be included in this analysis.  For lesions that 
bypass stage 5, duration of hard scab phase will be calculated as time between the two adjacent assessments either side of stage 5.  
 
10.7.7 Duration of Pain  (subject assessed)  
 
Duration of pain will be evaluated based on the subject’s diary, where the subject will record, just prior to each treatment  and three times daily once treatment is complete , the 
level of pain caused by the defined lesion. The rating scale for pain assessm ent has four 
levels:  none ( 1), mild ( 2), moderate ( 3), and severe ( 4). For each subject, duration of pain 
will be measured in hours from the time of the first occurrence of a pain level of mild, moderate, or severe until a consistent score of a pain level  of none has been achieved 
over at least 2 consecutive pain assessments, or until the lesion is completely healed, 
whichever occurs first .  
 Subjects who do not reach the no- pain level within 14 days will be considered censored 
immediately following their  last pain assessment. Subjects who never reach a pain level 
of mild, moderate, or severe will be assigned a duration of pain value of 0 hours . 
 10.7.8 Severity of Lesion Pain  
 The maximum severity (over time) of lesion pain will be summarized.  
 10.7.9  S ample Size Determination  
 The sample size for this study was based upon the results of the previous Phase 2 study, TR-H-211. In that study, Merlin demonstrated a statistically significant (p=0.0276) effect 
on the duration of classical lesion endpoint for subjects beginning treatment at Stage 1 (erythema) with only 32 subjects treated with Merlin and 22 placebo subjects. Clinical investigations with  Famvir and other independent studies, that initiate treatment within 
hours of the onset of prodromal symptoms ( Stage 0) have demonstrate d that 1/3 of all 
subjects enrolled in herpes  labialis studies will have spontaneously aborted lesion. A ny 
calculation of clinical trial size , therefore,  must consider that factor.  W hen, however, 
treatment is initiated at the erythema stage ( Stage 1), as in the Merlin Phase 2a (TR -H-
211) study, the incidence of spontaneously aborted lesions declines to 25%. As a result, a 
larger percentage of subjects will demonstrate classical lesions in Merlin studies than was seen in the Famvir, or similar previous studies. This was factored in when performing  
Protocol:  TR -H-212 
 
Topical Remedy, LLC  Version 1 Page 43 of 49  
CONFIDENTIAL  Date: 18 April  2017 power calculations for this  Phase 2b clinical study. Those calculations  determined that 
144 subjects would provide a 95% likelihood of statistical significance for the herpetic 
episode endpoint. Merlin decreased the duration of herpetic episode in subjects that began treatment at stage 1 by 41 hours, with a p-value of 0.055 in the Phase 2a study. The herpetic episode endpoint includes the subjects with aborted lesions.  As a result, a 150 subject clinical trial will have approximately 60 subjects progress to classical lesions in each treatment arm and we can be highly confident of having the power to demonstrate a highly significant difference for the duration of classical lesion endpoint, as shown in the Phase 2a results. In addition, a 150 subject clinical trial should have greater  than 95% likelihood of demonstrating a statistically significant Merlin effect on herpetic episode as a secondary endpoint.

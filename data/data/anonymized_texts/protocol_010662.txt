CONFIDENTIAL  9 1. INTRODUCTION  
 
Crohn's Disease (CD) is an inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)  that is serious, debilitating, and 
potentially life -threatening. The disease is termed a “ disease of the young” because it usually 
strikes children, teens, and young adults. Typically onset is between the ages of 15 to 25 years . Its 
inflammation can cause severe pain, diarrhea, and other intestinal problems. CD affects men and 
women equally and appears to show a familial predisposition. Approximately 20-30% of people 
with CD have a direct blood relative with some form of IBD. World-wide, an estimated 1.4 
million people suffer from CD (700,000 US) and the number of sufferers is growing at a rate of at 
least 1% each year. The disease is now considered to be the second most common chronic 
inflammatory disorder after rheumatoid arthritis. 
One of the potential causes of CD is thought to be gastrointestinal infection with Mycobacterium 
avium subspecies paratuberculosis  (MAP) and mycobacterial molecules have been shown to 
dysregulate immune signaling pathways as part of the organism’s evolved survival strategy. MAP has been difficult to isolate from CD patients and it is postulated that it asserts its pathological 
effect either as an infectious agent or by modifying local cytokine responses.  
One of the hindrances to testing for MAP infection in CD patients is that MAP is a very slow  
growing mycobacterium. MAP shed their cell walls when they infect humans, a tactic that enables them to escape identification and attack by human immune system defenses.  
Studies conducted to demonstrate the presence of MAP noted it in 55.4% (range 16-92%) of CD 
subjects vs. 8.2% (range of 0-49%) of control groups across multiple diagnostic specimens e.g. 
blood, tissue and culture. Recent work in Israel, Japan, and Ireland has shown that human tissue 
and white cells can be infected with MAP an d this infection results in cytokine production, 
especially TNF -α and therefore indicate s that MAP plays a role in CD.  
Current therapies for the treatment of CD aim towards alleviation of the disease symptoms and 
offer limited efficacy while often causing significant side effects. In addition, the cost of a 
number of these available therapies is prohibitive, thereby providing limited access to some 
patients. As a result, there continues to be a significant unmet need for more effective disease 
management of CD.  
Several studies evaluating antimicrobial treatment directed at MAP to treat patients with CD have 
been reported. Given their slow growth and periods of latency, treatment of mycobacterial 
diseases require multiple antibiotics including triple therapy to avoid the development of resistance.  
RHB -104 consists of three antimicrobial agents with known activity against mycobacteria, i.e., 
clarithromycin, rifabutin, and clofazimine. The rationale for the development of RHB-104 is to 
demonstrate the efficacy o f an antimicrobial therapy consisting of clarithromycin: 95mg, 
rifabutin: 45mg, and clofazimine: 10mg in the treatment of CD patients. These active ingredients and doses were selected to maximize therapeutic effectiveness against MAP. The dosing rationale 
of each active ingredient is supported by the following: 
•  prescriber information for each active ingredient  
•  the study by Selby et al. utilizing a sub- optimal treatment regimen  
•  a long- term, retrospective Australian study where 52 subjects were treated for  up to nine 
years on this therapy

CONFIDENTIAL  10 2. STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS  
 
2.1 Study Objectives  
 2.1.1 Primary  Efficacy  Objective  
 
The primary objective is to assess whether subjects randomized to receive RHB -104 have a 
higher probability of being in a state of remission (C DAI score <150) at week 26 assessment  as 
compared to subjects randomized to receive placebo.  
 
2.1.2  Key Secondary Efficacy Objectives 
 
1.  Assess whether subjects randomized to receive RHB -104 have a higher probability of being 
in a state of response at the 26 wee k assessment as compared to subjects randomized to 
receive placebo . 
2. Assess whether subjects randomized to receive RHB -104 have a higher probability of being 
in a state of remission at the 52 week assessment as compared to subjects randomized to receive placebo.  
3. Assess whether subjects randomized to receive RHB -104 have a higher probability of being 
in a state of durable ( long- term) remission  in assessments from week  26 through week 52 as 
compared to subjects randomized to receive placebo.  
4. Assess whether subjects randomized to receive RHB-104 have a higher probability of being 
in state of early remission at the 16 week assessment as compared to subjects randomized to receive placebo . 
5. Assess whether subjects randomized to receive RHB -104 have a higher probabil ity of being 
in a state of steroid free remission at the 52 week assessment as compared to subjects 
randomized to receive placebo. Subjects must be maintained off steroids for 3 weeks in order 
to be determined to be in steroid free remission, e.g., by week 49. 
 
2.1.3 Other Supportive Secondary Efficacy Objectives  
 
1. To compare the arm -specific time to remission and time to response.  
2. To compare the arm -specific duration of remission and duration of response. 
3. To compare the proportion of subjects who have maintained  remission from week 16 through 
week 52.  
4. To assess whether subjects randomized to receive RHB -104 have a higher probability of 
being in a state of response at the 16 week assessment as compared to subjects randomized to 
receive placebo .  
5. To assess the diff erence between the treatment groups in health -related quality -of-life using 
the IBDQ and SF- 36 questionnaire instruments.  
6. To compare arm -specific endoscopic 26 -week changes using the CDEIS  and SES- CD score 
in those subjects who consent to undergo colonoscopy. 
7. To assess the effect of RHB -104 on markers of inflammation. 
8. To assess the proportion of subjects in steroid free remission in each treatment arm at week 26. Subjects must be maintained off steroids for 3 weeks in order to be determined to be in steroi d free remission e.g. by week 23.

CONFIDENTIAL  11 2.1.4 Other Exploratory Efficacy Objectives  
 
1.    To characterize the pharmacokinetic profiles of each of the active agents (and active 
metabolites for clarithromycin and rifabutin) using a population PK approach. 
2.  To assess the efficacy outcome measures for interaction with the baseline assay results for 
MAP infection (positive versus negative) to use in development of MAP blood PCR testing . 
3.  To compare the arm -specific changes in MAP PCR status (positive to negative) from pre - to 
post- treatment at week 26 and week 52 . 
4.    To compare arm -specific 26 -week change from baseline in the endoscop ic index (ΔCDEIS 
and ΔSES- CD) and the clinical index (ΔCDAI)  
5.    To compare the arm -specific changes in MAP culture status (positive to negative) from pre- 
to post- treatment at week 26 and week 52 . 
6.   To a ssess the tissue levels of the active agents of RHB -104 in colon biopsy samples if 
possible. 
 
2.1.5 Safety Objective  
 
Assess the safety impact of treatment with RHB -104. 
 
2.2 Outcomes/ Endpoints  
 
The efficacy endpoints for statistical comparison between the RH -104 treatment and Placebo are 
grouped into 4 families for statistical analysis: (i) Primary efficacy endpoint; (ii) Key Secondary 
efficacy endpoints ; (iii) Other Supportive Secondary efficacy endpoints; and (iv) Other  
Exploratory efficacy endpoints.  The endpoints in families (i) and (ii) that are for potential 
treatment efficacy labeling claim will have multiplicity adjustment to control type 1 error rate.  
  
2.2.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint/ Variable : Remission  
 
In general use of rescue medication is considered as treatment failure (not achieve remission or 
response) if there are any new use of rescue medication to treat CD or increased rescue 
medication dose from baseline prior to any remission or response assessment.  Please refer to 
section 6.1.8 for more details.  
 
 
The primary efficacy variable is the proportion of subjects experienced  remission at Week 26, 
where remission is defined as a subject having a Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of 
<150.  Subjects who have a Week 26 CDAI measurement ≥ 150 or who do not have a CDAI 
measurement at Week 26 will be cla ssified as not achiev ed remission.  
 
The CDAI is used to assess the activity of CD; higher scores indicate more active disease.  
 
2.2.2 Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints/Variables 
 
 Key Secondary efficacy endpoints include the following :

CONFIDENTIAL  12 • Proportion of subjects experienced response at week 26, where response is defined as 
reduction from baseline of ≥100 in CDAI score.  Subjects who have a change from 
baseline to week 26 in CDAI score which is not a reduction of ≥ 100 or who do not have 
a change from baseline to week  26 in CDAI score will be classified as not experienced 
response.  
• Proportion of subjects in remission Week 52, where remission is defined as a subject 
having a CDAI score of <150.  Subjects who have a week 52 CDAI measurement ≥ 150 
or who do not have a CDA I measurement week 52 will be classified as not achieved 
remission . 
• Proportion of s ubjects  experienced Durable R emission ( CDAI score < 150) from week 26 
through week 52.  S ubjects experiencing a CDAI score ≥ 150 at any visit time point 
assessment between w eek 26 and week 52 or have no CDAI measurement week 26 or 
week 52 will be considered not achieved Durable Remission. 
• Proportion of subjects in Early R emission w eek 16, where remission is defined as a 
subject having a CDAI score of <150.  S ubjects  who have a week 16  CDAI score ≥  150 
or who do not have a CDAI measurement week 16 will be classified as not achieved early 
remission.   
• Proportion of subjects in steroid free remission week 52 , where remission is defined as a 
subject having a CDAI score of <150. Subjects must be mainta ined off steroids for 3 
weeks in order to be determined to be in steroid free remission, e.g., by week 49. 
 
2.2.3 Supportive Efficacy Endpoints/ Variables 
 
2.2.3.1 Other Remission and Response Endpoints/Variables 
 
• Proportion of subjects in remission from week 16 through week 52, where remission is 
defined as maintaining CDAI score < 150 from week 16 through week 52. Subjects experiencing a CDAI score ≥ 150 at any visit time point assessment between week 16 
and week 52 or have no CDAI  measurement  at  week 16 or week 52 will be considered 
not achieved Remission for this endpoint analysis.  
• Proportion of subjects experienced early response week 16, where early response is 
defined as reduction from baseline of ≥100 in CDAI  score. Subjects who have a change 
from baseline to week 16 in CDAI score which is not a reduction of ≥ 100 or who do not have a change from baseline to week 16 in CDAI score will be classified as not 
experienced early response. 
• Proportion of subjects experienced response week 52, where response is defined as 
reduction from baseline of ≥100 in CDAI  score. Subjects who have a change from 
baseline to w eek 52 in CDAI score which is not a reduction of ≥ 100 or who do not have 
a change from baseline to week 52 in CDAI score will be classified as not experienced  
response. 
2.2.3.2 Time to Event Endpoints/Variables 
 
• Time to remission  – Number of weeks after randomization that a subject first records a 
state of remission  (CDAI score < 150). It will be  calculated as the date on which 
remission is first observed minus the date of the baseline visit (Visit 1), plus 1 day, divided by 7.  For subjects still on study and not achieved remission at the time of

CONFIDENTIAL  13 assessment, time to remission will be censored at the date of the last assessment of CDAI 
score.    
 
• Duration of remission – Duration of remission defined as the number of weeks the 
subject is in remission (CDAI score <  150). It will be calculated as the first da te 
following remission at which CDAI is ≥150 minus the date of remission, plus 1 day, divided by 7.  Those subjects who experienced remission and continue to be in remission 
at the time of their last CDAI assessment will be censored at the date of their la st CDAI 
assessment.  Duration of remission will be calculated only for patients achieving 
remission.  
 
• Time to response – N umber of weeks after baseline that a subject first achieves a state of 
response (a reduction from baseline of ≥100 in CDAI score ). It will be calculated as the 
date on which response is first observed minus the date of the baseline visit (Visit 1), plus 
1 day, divided by 7.  For those subjects not experienced response, time to response will 
be censored at the date of the last assessment of CDAI score.   
 
• Duration of response – Defined as t ime in weeks that a subject is in a state of response (a 
reduction from baseline of ≥ 100 in CDAI score) . It will be calculated as the first date 
following response at which the reduction from baseline in CDAI is <100 minus the date of response, plus 1 day, divided by 7.  Those subjects who experienced response and 
continue to be in response at the time of their last CDAI assessment will be censored at 
the date of their last CDAI assessment. Duration of response will be calculated only for 
patients achieved response.  
 
2.2.3.3 Endoscopic Change Variables 
 
• Change from baseline to week 26 in Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity 
(CDEIS)  and Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease (SES- CD). The CDEIS  and 
SES- CD are endoscopic scoring systems for the assessment of CD . 
 
• Correlation s between the change from baseline to week 26 in CDEIS and SES -CD and 
the change from baseline to week 26 in CDAI. 
 
• Proportion of subjects in remission by visit time post- baseline  based  on CDEIS and SES-
CD measurements. Remission is defined as 0- 3 score based on CDEIS  measurement and  
defined as 0-2 score based on SES- CD measurement.  
 
• Proportion responders based on CDEIS and SEC- CD at week 26.  Responders based on 
CDEIS and SES -CD scores are defined and classified into two categories as 50% 
reduction from baseline score; and 25% reduction from baseline score to week 26. 
 
2.2.3.4 Health Related Quality of Life Variables

3. STUDY DESIGN 
 
This study is a multicenter, Phase III, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel group, double-
blind  study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of RHB-104 compared to placebo to treat 
subjects with moderate to severe CD. RHB -104 consists of 3 antibio tics with  activity against 
Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis  (MAP), a potential cause of CD. Subjects with 
active CD will be randomized at baseline in a 1:1 fashion to receive up to 52 weeks of RHB-104 
or placebo. Subjects will remain on stable doses  of their baseline CD treatment although steroids 
may be tapered after Week 8 at the discretion of the investigator.  
 The study is designed to assess remission at Week 26 as the primary endpoint.  However, as MAP 
are slow growing mycobacteria without a proven antibiotic  treatment, the duration of antibiotic 
treatment needed to achieve remission in subjects with CD caused by MAP may be longer than 
26 weeks. Subjects with response at  week 26 may ultimately achieve remission at a later time 
point with continued treatment for MAP. Also, subjects with CD treated for underlying MAP 
infection may experience benefits with a longer period of time in response or remission with RHB -104 treatment compared to placebo. Thus, the study is also designed to assess response, 
remission, and maintenance of remission in subjects on randomized treatment through week 52.  
Blood samples will be collected at baseline and at every visit after the initial 4 weeks of  treatment 
to test for MAP in the serum using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. MAP cultures will 
be prepared from whole blood at the baseline visit and after 26 and 52 weeks of treatment in 
subjects enrolled at North American study sites. 
 
Safety and pharmacokinetics of the fixed-dose combination product, RHB-104, will also be 
assessed.  Colonoscopy will be done in consenting subjects prior to initiation of study drug and 
after26 weeks of study drug to assess for mucosal healing as well as MAP status via PCR  and 
culture. Optional biopsies will also be collected for possible measurement of tissue drug levels and archived for future MAP determinations.

CONFIDENTIAL  18 code will only be available to personnel responsible for the randomization of subjects or labeling 
of the study drug. The sponsor and all personnel involved in the conduct of the study will be 
blinded to the treatment assigned to each subject.    
 
5. ANALYSIS POPULATIONS  
 
All screened subjects who signed informed consent will be included in the disposition table 
counts.  
The following populations will be used for data analysis. 
 
The Intent -to-Treat (ITT) Population : The primary efficacy analyses will be based on the IT T 
population, which is defined as all subjects randomized. Subjects will be analyzed according to 
the treatment group to which they were  randomized.  
 
The Modified Intent -to-Treat (mITT) Population : The Modified Intent- to-treat population is 
defined as pat ients who fulfill all inclusion/exclusion criteria. The sensitivity analyses will be 
performed using the mITT population. Subjects  will be analyzed according to the treatment group 
to which they were randomized. 
 
The Safety Population  (SAF) : The safety pop ulation includes subjects who are randomized and 
receive at least one dose of study medication. The primary safety analyses will be based on the 
SAF population.  Subjects  will be analyzed according to the treatment which they  actually 
received . 
 
Per-Protoc ol Population (PP):  The PP Population includes all randomized subj ects who receive 
at least one dose of RHB-104 or placebo and complete dose escalation to target dose of 5 capsules bid, as well as all subjects wi thout major protocol deviations that would have a 
significant impact on clinical outcome. Relevant protocol deviations may include errors in 
treatment assignment, the use of excluded medication that might affect study drug bioavailability , 
poor compliance (< 80% compliant over study duration ), and s ubjects lost to follow-up. Protocol 
deviations will be reviewed and the list of major deviations warranting exclusion from the PP 
Population will be finalized prior to study unblinding. Subjects will be  analyzed according to the 
treatment group to which th ey were randomized.  
 The primary and key secondary efficacy sensitivity analyses may be repeated on the PP 
Population. 
 
6. STATISTICAL METHODOLOGY  
 6.1 Statistical and Analytical Issues  
             
6.1.1 Statistical Methods  
 
Descriptive statistics summary results will  be produced and presented for all the data collected on 
the different assessments that include demographics, baseline characteri stics, concomitant 
medications, efficacy , and safety endpoints. Continuous data summary descriptive statistics will

CONFIDENTIAL  19 include the number of observations, means, standard deviations, medians, and ranges.  
Categorical variables will be summarized with frequencies and percentages.  
 The primary hypothesis testing will be t wo-sided statistical significance testing (alpha level = 
0.05) c omparing active treatment to placebo and  mainly dedicated to assessing  the primary 
endpoint and the key secondary endpoints. Point and interval estimates (95% confidence intervals) will be calculated and presented by treatment group for each parameter. Com puted 
p-values will be rounded to four decimal places; p -values less than 0. 0001 will be presented as '< 
0.0001' and p- values greater than 0. 9999 will be presented as ‘>  0.9999’ in the  tables.  
 All statistical analyses will be performed using SAS statistic al software (Version 9.3  or an 
updated latest higher version available at the time of analysis ).  Adverse events will be coded 
using the most recent MedDRA version available at the time of analysis and the version used will be footnoted in the respective summary tables. Concomitant medications will be coded using the 
most recent version of Worl d Health Organization (WHO) Drug dictionary. 
 
6.1.2 Multiplicity  and Testing Strategy 
 
Multiplicity issues in statistical inference in this study may arise from repeated tests on several 
multiple endpoints specified in the protocol . Additionally , the impact of the Type I error 
probability (α) because of the formal planned interim analysis to be conducted needs to be 
understood.  
 The protocol specified α -spending for the pla nned  interim analysis is 0.003. Hypotheses tests at 
the final analysis will be conducted at significance level of α = 0.049. The multiple efficacy tests  
for the study final analysis will employ a serial sequential gatekeeper strategy to maintain the 
Type 1  error rate at α  = 0.049 across two famil ies of analyses that support the primary, and key 
secondary objectives. The protocol pre-specified strategy is to use a hierarchy of significance 
tests where each test acts as a gatekeeper to tests below it. The end points will be  tested in a 
sequential manner and will follow the sequential order given below starting with Remission 
ranked 1. Any inferential and hypothesis testing of a subsequent endpoint will be performed only 
if the test for the preceding endpoint is  significant. In other words, the endpoint hypothesis 
examined earlier serves as gatekeeper. For this study as listed below in  sequence of clinical 
importance, R emission week 26 is  first rank ( 1) and will  be tested first followed by Response 
week 26  (rank 2), followed by Remission week 52 (rank 3), Durable Remission  week 26 through 
week 52  (rank 4), followed by Remission week 16 (rank 5),  and followed by Steroid  free 
Remission week 52 (rank 6).   Again it is important to note that once one hypothesis is tested and 
found not to be significant at α = 0.049, all subsequent tests will not be performed. T he 
multiplicity adjustment following hierarchal testing procedure comparing RHB -104 with Placebo  
will only be performed on the following key clinical efficacy endpoints listed in order of clinical 
importance :  
 1. Remission  (CDAI score < 150) week 26  - Primary Efficacy Endpoint . 
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 2. Response ( reduction from baseline of ≥100 in CDAI score)  week 26 . 
3. Remission (CDAI score < 150) week 52 
4. Durable Remission  (CDAI score < 150) from week 26 through week 52 in remission.

For the endpoints not included in the above pre- speci fied multiple testing, the P-values and 
confidence intervals will be presented with NO adjustment for multiplicity. Nominal P- values and 
confidence intervals are consequently supplementary/supportive to the primary efficacy analyses.   
 
6.1.3 Subgroups  
 
To furthe r assess consistence of the study outcome data, the primary efficacy, key secondary  
efficacy , and select safety data may be further broken down and summarized by the following 
baseline subgroups characteristics with potential differing influence on outcome: 
 
• Sex: male, female  
• Race: White, Black , Other  
• Region: Countries will be grouped into geographical regions, e.g., US, Canada, Europe, 
etc. 
• Alcohol consumption: (Yes/No) 
• Smoking: ( previous smoker, currently smoking, Nonsmoker) 
• Prior CD treatments  (e.g., sur gery/no surgery)  
• Years of CD (Categories to be determined at the  time of analysis)  
• Prior u se of anti-TNF agents (yes or no)  
• Prior use of immunomodulators (yes or no)  
• Prior use of Corticosteroid s (yes/no)  
• CRP level at baseline  
• Fecal Calprotectin level at b aseline  
 
The final subgroups to be assessed will be completed at the time of analysis depending on the 
available data by each subgroup.  
 
6.1.4 Baseline Definition  
 Baseline period consists of 42 days  (covering screening period) immediately preceding first 
administration of study treatment. Any assessment performed during these 42 days before first administration of study treatment will be considered baseline assessment. Study day 1 will be the 
first day of study drug administration. For all endpoints requiring ba seline results, e.g., 
comparison with post -baseline, the baseline is the last non -missing result prior to first dose . 
 
6.1.5 Missing Data and Handling of Drop outs 
 
All available efficacy and safety data will be included in data listings and tabulations. All patients 
who prematurely discontinue for any reason will be considered failures for the different 
proportion based endpoints.  
 
CDAI Missing Data: 

 STATISTICAL ANALYSI S PLAN  
RedHill Biopharma Ltd.  
RHB -104-01 
Page 21  
 
Final Version 3.0, 0 5 April 2018  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  21 The computation of CDAI requires 7 days of consecutive dia ry daily data. For subjects with 
CDAI dia ry data reporte d that is less than 7 days of data, the reported data will be standardized to 
7 days by dividing the sum of CDAI  score over the number of days of data by total number of 
days of reported data multiplied by 7.  If less than 4 days of dia ry data is available , the subject 
will be categorized as a non -responder and the CDAI score will be considered missing. As 
specified in the protocol, subjects with missing week 26 assessment will be assumed to not be in a 
state of remission at week 26 (i.e., non-responders).  Similarly, for subjects with missing week 52 
assessments will be assumed not to be in state of remission  at week 52. Sensitivity analyses may 
be performed on Observed Case ( completer analysis) only . 
 
Handling of missing date information for AEs:  
The term missing date refers to a completely missing date or to partial date where month or/and 
day or/and year is/are missing , e.g. missing month/day/year. Missing start and end dates will be 
imputed conservatively, i.e. missing values will be imputed in such a way that the duration of the 
AE is considered with the longest possible duration. The missing start date and end date of AE 
will be imputed for the purpose of defining treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE) and for 
assigning events to treatment periods using the following definitions :  
 
(i)  Adverse E vent Start Date:  
Event Missing D ay: If Adverse event day is missing but month and year present , then i mpute the 
1st of the month unless month and year are the same as  first dose of study drug then impute day first day of dose. 
Event Missing day and month – If adverse event day and month both are missing but year is 
present then impute 1
st January unless year is the same as first dose date then impute day and 
month first dose day and month. Completely missing – imp ute first dose date unless the end date suggests it could have started 
prior to this in which case impute the 1st January of the same year as the end date.   
 
(ii)  Adverse Event End Date: 
Missing day – If AE day is missing but month and year is present then i mpute the last day of the 
month. 
Missing day and month – If AE has missing day and month but year is present then impute 31st 
December.  
Completely Missing – Required to look at whether the AE is still ongoing before imputing a date 
and also when it started in relation to study drug. If the ongoing flag is missing then assume that 
AE is still present (i.e. do not impute a date). If the AE has stopped and start date is prior to first 
dose date then impute the 1st dose date, if it started on or after first dose date then impute a date 
that is after the last dose date.  
 
(iii) TEAE definition with missing start and stop dates : If the start date of an adverse event is 
incomplete or missing, the event will be assumed to be a treatment -emergent adverse event 
(TEAE ), unless the incomplete start date (month and/or year) or the stop date (complete or 
incomplete) clearly indicates that the event started prior to dosing. Missing/incomplete 
information will be reported as missing/incomplete in the subject listings.

Final Version 3.0, 0 5 April 2018  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  22 (iv) Adv erse event relationship : If the relationship for an adverse event is not recorded, it will be 
assumed to be treatment related in the presentation of the statistical summary of incidence results.  
Missing information will be reported as missing in the subje ct listings.  
 
(v) Adverse event severity : If the severity of an adverse event is missing, the severity will be 
assumed to be severe when summarizing data. Missing information will be reported as missing in 
the subject listings.  
 
(vi) Non -study medication (concomitant medications, steroids) start and stop dates:  If the start 
and/or stop dates of non- study medication use are incomplete or missing, the use will be assumed 
to be concomitant, unless the incomplete date information clearly indicates that the use stopped 
prior to study medication dosing. Missing/incomplete information will be reported as 
missing/incomplete in the subject listings.  
 
6.1.6 Conversion of time interval  
 
In case time interval was calculated in days and need to be converted into weeks, months or years 
the following conversion factors need to be used:  
1 week  = 7 days 1 month = 30.4 days 
1 year    = 365.25 days 
 
6.1.7 Pooling of Investigator Sites 
 
The primary analysis will use data pooled across all investigative sites.  The Region s (UK, US, 
Canada,  New Zealand , Israel, Slovakia, etc. ) and site differences may be explored in preliminary 
analyses depending on how many subjects randomized by each site/region. Preliminary exploratory analyses may be conducted to determine potential influence of treatmen t-by-
investigative  site/region  interaction on the primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints by 
graphical visualization and tabulations of the data and where necessary, using statistical models 
incorporating treatment, site, and treatment -by-site interac tion. A significance level of 0.10 will 
be used in any of the analyses in identifying potential treatment-by-site interactions. The 
exploratory results indicating non- significant interaction will be indicative that pooled data across 
sites/regions was free of the impact of any extreme investigative sites/regions. It is recognized 
that the power to detect an interaction will be limited due to some sites with limited enrollments.   
 
6.1.8 Efficacy Data with High Doses of Steroids Use and Rescue Medications Use  
 Corticosteroids Use:  
A subject may use corticosteroids or increased dose levels of corticosteroids for reasons other 
than CD, and may start corticosteroid tapering at 8 weeks. If the subject experiences a worsening 
of disease activity during the taper, and/or  the oral corticosteroid dose temporarily increased, in 
these circumstances the subject will be considered a treatment failure in the steroid free remission 
analysis but will continue to remain on the study and complete all scheduled visits.  
Use of Rescue Medications:  

 STATISTICAL ANALYSI S PLAN  
RedHill Biopharma Ltd.  
RHB -104-01

Final Version 3.0, 0 5 April 2018  
 
CONFIDENTIAL  23 Subjects rescued with the following treatments or whose baseline doses/regimens are increased to 
treat new or unresolved CD symptoms may remain on the study drug at the discretion of the 
investigator and continue to be assessed at all schedul ed study visits: 
•  Oral or rectal 5 -ASA compounds 
• Azathioprine or 6- mercaptopurine (6 -MP) or methotrexat e 
• Antibiotics as treatment of C D 
• Total parenteral nutrition as treatment of C D 
• Systemic or rectal corticosteroid therap y 
• Anti-TNF or other biologic agen t 
 In the ITT efficacy analyses, subjects who initiate or modify dose/regimens to treat CD symptoms 
will be considered as treatment failures. 
 
6.1.9 Determination of Sample  Size 
 
The sample size justification is provided in the protocol and was based on the review of published   
literature in similar patient population (Sandborn et al., 2013). A total sample size of 410 subjects 
(205 per treatment arm) was computed to be sufficient with one stratification anti- TNF agent use 
(yes/no) to detect a minimum difference of 15 percentage points between RHB-10 4 treatment 
(36% Remission) and Placebo (21% Remission) with 90% Power at two -sided significance level, 
α=0.05. The test statistic used for this analysis was a two -sided Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) 
test controlling f or the stratification variable (anti -TNF agents (yes/no) under the ITT principle. 
These calculations were made to allow for two sequential tests to be made using the O'Brien-
Fleming spending function to determine the test boundaries. The interim analysis ( first sequential 
test) will occur when 50% of the patients have their outcome data measured (i.e., reach 26 weeks of follow- up). The 2- sided alpha level for stopping the trial for efficacy at the interim analysis is 
0.003. If this criterion is not met the trial will be continued and the final analysis (second 
sequential test) will be performed using a 2 -sided alpha level of 0.049 for testing the primary 
outcome ( Elashoff , 2007) . In all analyses, subjects with missing 26 week assessments will be 
assumed to n ot be in a state of remission at 26  weeks.  
 
It should be noted that the  intervention effect used in the sample size derivation for the study is  
15% improvement in 26 week remission success, however a clinically meaningful difference in 
this measure (26 week remission success proportion) is 9% (in absolute percent) based on clinical 
expert opinion. Therefore, any statistically significant difference between groups that has an 
observed percent difference of 9% or larger would indicate that treatment is effective.  
 
Protocol Version 11.0 curtails the number of expected enrolled patients to 324 (162 
per group). Final analysis of the data is to be carried out when approximately 324 
patients have completed the Week 26 primary endpoint assessment. This sample size 
curtailment reflects the study’s current accrual trends. The anticipated power will be at  
least 80% given the study design stage assumptions regarding the treatment groups  
primary efficacy endpoint (36% RHB-104 vs. 21% Placebo).

6.2.7 Prior and Concomitant Medications and Steroids  
 
Prior medications will be defined as medications stopped prior to Day 1 of study medication. 
Concomitant medications include medications taken on or after the first dose of study medication 
as well as medications that started prior to the first dose of study medication and continued after the first dose of study medication. The following algorit hm will be used to define prior and 
concomitant:   
The medication will be assumed to be prior medication if it cannot be definitively shown that the 
medication did not start or continue during the treatment period. 
If the start date or stop date of a medic ation is partially missing, the date will be compared as far 
as possible with the date of the start of administration of study drug. The following approach will 
be taken:  
• If the start date of medication is complete and occurs on or after the day of the fir st dose, 
the medication will be assumed concomitant.  If the start date occurs prior to the first dose date but the end date is on or after the first dose date or the medication is recorded 
as ongoing, the medication will be considered concomitant. 
• If the start day is missing but the start month and year are complete, a medication will 
only be excluded as being concomitant if the start month/year is before the month/year of 
study drug administration and if the stop date (either full date, month and year if missing 
day, or year if missing month and day) is before study drug administration. 
• If the start day and month are missing but the start year is complete, a medication will only be excluded as concomitant if the start year is before the year of study drug administration and if the stop date (either  full date, month and year if missing day, or year 
if missing month and day) is before study drug administration. 
• If the start date is completely missing and the stop date is prior to first dose or completely 
missing, the medication will be assumed to be a prior medication. 
 
All p rior and concomitant medications recorded on CRF will be mapped to standardized terms 
using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary coding system (WHO DD ). The 
Anatomical –Therapeutic–Chemical (ATC) Classification level 2 and preferred term  will be used 
to summarize the data by treatment group. A subject having the same medication more than once will be counted only once in the incidence table for that medication. For each ATC classifi cation 
and Preferred Term the number and percentage of subjects will be displayed .  Summary tables 
will be presented on SAF population separately for prior medications and concomitant medications by treatment group. 
 
 All prior and concomitant medications/treatments will be presented in a data listing with dose, 
units, frequency, route of administration, indication, start and end dates for the safety  population. 
A separate Steroids use subject listing may be presented providing the steroid coded ATC 
classif ication,  preferred tem,  and date. 
 Any concomitant procedures recorded on CRF will be presented in a data listing with procedure 
name, date and reason.

CONFIDENTIAL  28 6.3 Efficacy Analysis 
 
The e fficacy primary analyses will be based  on the ITT population as the primary population. 
Any Supportive/sensitivity analyses may be  assessed on subgroup populations of subjects that 
will be defined for each endpoint as needed for implementing specific sensitivity analysis.  
Additional analyses as defined in SAP addendum will be perfo rmed accordingly as specified.  
 
 
6.3.1  Primary Efficacy Analysis  
 
The primary efficacy analysis will be performed on ITT population. Sensitivity analyses may be 
performed on Observed Case (completers only), on subjects with no violation of key 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (mITT population) , and on PP population.   
 The primary efficacy v ariable  is the proportion of subjects experienced  remission week 26, where 
remission is defined as a subject having a Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score of < 150.  
Subje cts who have a w eek 26 CDAI measurement ≥ 150 or who do not have a CDAI 
measurement w eek 26 will be classified as not achieved  remission . The primary analysis will 
compare the RHB -104 treated group to Placebo treated group on ITT population using Cochran-
Mantel -Haenszel ( CMH)  chi-square test controlling for the stratification variable  anti-TNF  agents 
use (yes/no).  The null and alternative hypotheses are as follows, where π
R and π P are the 
proportion of subjects with remission in the RHB -104 and placebo treated groups, respectively.  
 
Null hypothesis                                  H o: πR = π P  
 “Proportion (%)  of subjects in Remission in RHB -104 Treatment is equal to Proportion (%)  of 
subjects in Remission in  Placebo Treatment at week 26 ” 
 Alternative hypothesis                     H
1: πR ≠ πP  
 “Proportion of subjects in Remission for RHB -104 Treatment is not equal to Proportion of 
subjects in Remission for  Placebo treatment at week 26 ” 
 For each treatment group, descriptive statistics will be presented including the numbe r of 
observations, proportion (%) of subjects in remission.  
The primary analysis will compare RHB -104 group to the placebo group using a two- sided test at 
the α  = 0.049 level of significance.  
 
The statistical criterion for primary objective success will b e met if the CMH chi -square test  p-
value comparing the RHB -104 arm with the placebo  arm (Higher proportion in RHB-104 than 
placebo) is  less than  0.049 based on a 2- sided test  taking into account the pre -specified protocol 
alpha spent at interim equal to 0.003. 
 
 For each treatment group, parameter estimates with 95% confidence interval will be presented including the number of observations and proportion (%) of subjects in remission.

CONFIDENTIAL  29 To assess the robustness of the primary results, s ensitivity analysis will be performed on mITT 
and on observed case ( only completers with 2 6 weeks of data). The observed case population will 
include only subjects that have 26 weeks assessment.   
 
Logistic regression modeling will be implemented as additional exploratory analys is to assess the 
modifying effect of prognostic baseline characteristics identified prospectively as clinically 
important baseline factor s/variables on the remission outcome in both treatment groups at week 
26. This will model a categorical response variab le Remission (< 150 CDAI score) at week 26 
(yes/no) as a function of treatment, stratification an ti-TNF agents (yes/no)  use, and treatment -by- 
baseline clinical factor interaction. The aim  is to assess consistence/inconsistence of the treatment 
differences across each of the pre -defined clinically important baseline characteristic s (one -
variable- at-a-time) . Each prognostic factor will be fitted separately  (one- variable -at-a-time)  in the 
model and output results including 95% confidence inter vals presented in forest plots  showing 
consistence/inconsistence by treatment group . The following baseline factors are considered 
prospectively to be potentially clinically important:   
• Baseline serum inflammation marker: C- reactive protein  (Normal/High )  
• Baseline stool inflammation marker: Fecal calprotectin  (Normal/High)  
• Baseline CDEIS score  (0-3; >3 score) 
• Baseline SES- CD score (0-2; >2 score)  
• Baseline IBDQ  Score  
• Duration of  CD  
• Prior surgical treatment for CD  (yes/no) 
• MAP -Test PCR Blood assay (Posi tive/Negative) Basel ine 
• MAP-Test Blood culture (Positive/Negative) Baseline  
• Gender (male/female)  
• Age at first Diagnosis of CD  
• Smoking  (yes/no) 
• Alcohol consumption (yes/no) 
• Use of Immunomodulators (yes/no)   
• Use of steroids (yes/no)  
 
The continuous variables may be categorized into different classification categories depending on 
the number of observations and final decisions on categories for each variable will be determined 
at the time of analysis.     
6.3.2  Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints Analys es 
 
Five key secondary efficacy end points of clinical importance are considered for primary 
inferential claims. Since gate keeping hierarchical sequential testing strategy is required for 
multiplicity adjustment, any  claim on these key secondary efficacy endpoints will be made only if 
the p rimary efficacy endpoint parameter meets the criterion for statistical success. The 
hierarchical sequence hypothesis testing for multiplicity adjustment is summarized in section 6.1.2 above. The hypothesis testing will be done in a sequential manner following the sequential 
order given in section 6.1.2 with the understanding that any hypothesis test of a subsequent 
endpoint will be performed only if the test for the preceding endpoint is significant. In other 
words, the endpoint hypothesis examined earlier serves as gatekeeper .

CONFIDENTIAL  30 6.3.2.1 Response week 26  
 
The Response week 26 is defined as the proportion (%) of subjects that experienced reduction 
from baseline of ≥ 100 in CDAI score. The same statistical analysis strategy as described for the 
primary endpoint including sensitivity and exploratory analyses will be repeated for the 
proportion responders (%) at 26 weeks comparing the two treatment groups. Summary para meter 
estimates generated from the statistical analyses will be presented by treatment group, and will include the number and proportion of subjects achieving response along with the model estimated 
odds ratio (including 95% confidence interval) and p-value compari ng RHB -104 treatment to 
placebo. The same sensitivity and exploratory analyses as for primary endpoint analysis may be 
conducted and summarized.  
6.3.2.2 Remission week 52  
 Remission at week 52 will be derived following similar strategy as for the primary  endpoint.  The 
subjects in remission will include subjects experienced remission (CDAI < 150 score) at week 26 and also at week 52 , and subjects that were non -responders at week 26 but are responders at week 
52 (Late responders).  
 The same statistical met hods as used for the primary endpoint will be used for this analysis. The 
proportion of subjects experienced remission at 52 weeks will be summarized for each treatment group and compared between the two treatments using Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi-
square test. Summary parameter estimates generated from the statistical analyses will be presented by treatment group, and will include the number and proportion of subjects achieving response along with the model estimated odds ratio (including 95% confide nce interval) and p -
value comparing RHB -104 treatment to placebo. The same sensitivity and exploratory analyses as 
for primary endpoint analysis may be conducted and summarized. 
 
6.3.2.3 Durable (or Sustained) Remission  
 This analysis is intended to compare the tw o treatment groups considering only the subjects that 
experienced remission  (CDAI < 150 score) week 26 through week 52 (Sustained Remission). 
Subjects who are not in remission at any visit point assessment between 26 and 52 weeks will be considered as non- responders for this analysis. The same statistical method as used for the 
primary endpoint will be used for this analysis.  The proportion (%) of subjects experienced 
sustained remission will be summarized for each treatment group and compared between the two 
treatments using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test. Summary parameter estimates 
generated from the statistical analyses will be presented by treatment group, and will include the 
number and proportion of subjects achieving response along wi th the model estimated odds ratio 
(including 95% confidence interval) and p- value comparing RHB -104 treatment to placebo. The 
same sensitivity and exploratory analyses as for primary endpoint analysis will be conducted and 
summarized.  
 An additional comple mentary analysis and summary will be presented for the Proportion of 
subjects that maintained durable remission at least 3 out of the 4 visits  assessed ( i.e. ≥ 75%  of the 
visits in remission) week 26 through week 52.

Early Remission week 16 will be derived following similar strategy as for the primary endpoint.  
The summary results will show the number and proportion (%) of subjects experienced early remission (CDAI < 150 score) week 16. 
 
The same statistical approach as for the p rimary analysis will be employed to compare proportion 
(%) of subjects experienced Early Remission for the RHB -104 treated group versus Placebo 
treated group on ITT population using Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test 
controlling for the stratifi cation variable anti -TNF agents use (yes/no) . Summary parameter 
estimates generated from the statistical analyses will be presented by treatment group, and will include the number and proportion of subjects in remission  along with the model estimated odds 
ratio (including 95% confidence interval) and p- value comparing RHB -104 treatment to placebo. 
The same sensitivity and exploratory analyses as for primary endpoint analysis may be conducted 
and summarized. 
 
6.3.2.5 Steroid free remission week  52 
 This analysis is to compare the proportion (%) of subjects that achieved steroid free  remission 
week 52 in the two treatment groups. To be considered to be in steroid free remission , a subject 
has to be in remission (CDAI score < 150) week 52 and is off steroids use for at least 3 weeks. 
The 3 weeks steroid free  period is by week 49.   
 The statistical analysis strategy, the statistical tests comparing the two treatment groups, summary 
and presentation of the results will be similar to the primary endpoint analysis based on CMH chi -
square tests. Summary parameter estimates generated from the statistical analyses will be presented by treatment group, and will include the number and proportion of subjects in steroid 
free remission  along with the model estimated odds ratio (including 95% confidence interval) and 
p-value compari ng RHB -104 treatment to placebo. The same sensitivity and exploratory analyses 
as for primary endpoint analysis may be conducted and summarized.  
6.3.3 Supportive Secondary Efficacy Endpoints  
 
This group of seco ndary efficacy endpoints is considered to be supportive of the efficacy for the 
primary and the key secondary endpoints. Therefore, there will be no multiplicity adjustments for 
this group of endpoints. Summary statistics and tests of hypotheses will be considered 
descriptive/supportive.   
 
6.3.3.1 Time to Event Endpoints/Variables Analysis  
 
The Time to event endpoints that will be analyzed  includes :  
• Time to  remission  
• Duration of remission

CONFIDENTIAL  32 The four endpoints will require time to event modeling approach.  Cox Proportional Hazard 
modeling will be used  to compare the time to event in both treatments while simultaneously  
adjusting for stratification  variable  anti-TNF agents use (yes/no) . The explanatory variables in the 
model will include treatment, and the stratification  variable anti -TNF agents use (yes/no).  Patients 
who do not achieve the outcome event at the end of the study will be censored on the last visit date recorded. Patients who discontinued early will be censored on the last date of contact. Censored observations and confidence intervals for the estimated median times will be presented.  
 The null hypothesis that is tested is that of equal time to event  distribution between the two 
treatments. Equality of the distributio ns of event times implies that there are similar response 
event rates between the two treatments not only for the entire treatment period, but also for any 
visit time point assessed post -baseline during the study. Rejection of the null hypothesis indicates 
that the event rates significantly differ between the two treatments at one or more visit time points  
assessed post -baseline. Kaplan Meier survival curves and parameters showing time- to-first 
observed response outcome will be summarized by treatment. S umm ary statistics that will be 
presented will include minimum, maximum, the 25th and 75th percentiles, 95% confidence intervals on the median (using the method of Brookmeyer and Crowley), and proportion of  the 
events and censored data.  The log -rank test will be used to test for differences between RHB -104 
treatment and placebo, and p- value s from th e test s will be presented.  Kaplan -Meier plot s with 
descriptive summary statistics will be presented.  
 
6.3.3.2 Sustained Remission week 16 though week 52 
 This analysis i s intended to compare the two treatment groups based on the proportion (%) of 
subjects achieved Sustained Remission defied as maintaining CDAI score < 150 from week 16 through week 52.  Subjects who are not in remission at any visit point assessment betwee n week 
16 and week 52  will be considered as non -responders for this analysis. The same statistical 
method as used for the primary endpoint will be used for this analysis. The proportion (%)  of 
subjects experienced sustained remission will be summarized for  each treatment group and 
compared between the two treatments using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test. 
Summary parameter estimates generated from the statistical analyses will be presented by treatment group, and will include the number and proportion of subjects achieving sustained 
remission along with the model estimated odds ratio (including 95% confidence interval) and p-
value comparing RHB -104 treatment to placebo. 
 An additional complementary analysis and summary will be presented for the Proportion of subjects that maintained durable remission at least 5 out of the 6 visits assessed (i.e. ≥ 83% of the 
visits in remission) week 16 through week 52. 
 
6.3.3.3 Response at Week 52  
 The Response is defined as reduction from baseline of ≥100 in CDAI score  week 52 .  The 
responders will include subjects who were  responders  week 26 through week 52 and the subjects 
that were non- responders at week 26 but were  responders week 52 (Late Responders).  
 The same statistical method s as used for the primary endpoint will be used for this analysis. The

IBDQ is used to assess IBD status. IBDQ is a valid  and reliable quality of life instrument that 
incorpor ates social, systemic and emotional symptoms together with bowel- related symptoms 
into activity index.  The IBDQ includes 32 questions on 4 areas of health -related quality of life:  
 
Bowel Systems (10 questions: 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 20, 22, 24, 26, 29),  Emotio nal Health  Function (12 questions: 3, 7, 11, 15, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32),  
Social Function (5 questions: 4, 8, 12, 16, 28), and  
System Function (5 questions: 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 ). Each item is rated on 7 -point Likert scale (higher 
scores equate to h igher quality of life).  
 
A total IBDQ score is calculated as sum of all 32  scores and the total ranges from 32 to 224. If 
more than 4 questions are missing,  then total scores will not be calculated.  If 4 or fewer questions 
are missing, then missing questions will be imputed by the mean of the rest of available question 
scores.  
 Summary descriptive statistics including mean, standard deviation, median and range (including 
95% confidence intervals) will be presented in tables and bar graphs for the actual observed and change from baseline scores for each domain and overall by treatment and by visit.  
 The change from baseline IBDQ score will be analyzed using an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model with treatment group, stratification variable anti -TNF agents use (yes/no)  as 
classification factors, and baseline IBDQ score as a covariate.  The treatment parameter estimates 
from the analysis model including means,  95% confidence intervals and associated 2 -sided p-
values will be presented .

CONFIDENTIAL  35 The CRP is used as marker  of inflammation . The C -reactive Protein (CRP) level data collected at 
different visits will be used to assess inflammation at baseline  and at different visits post -base line. 
Summary descriptive statistics for the actual observed and change from baseline will include 
mean, standard deviation , median and range for each treatment by visit.  The change from 
baseline CRP  comparing the two treatment groups will be analyzed using an analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group, stratification variable anti -TNF agents use 
(yes/no) as classification factors, and baseline CRP  as a covariate.  The treatment parameter 
estimates from the analysis model including means, 95% confidence intervals an d associated 2 -
sided p -values will be presented  including bar graphs. 
 
In addition, the CRP level will be classified into two categories: “Normal ( ≤  0.999 mg/dL)” and 
“High ( > 10 mg/dL )”.  Summary results will show number of patients and proportion (%) with 
“Normal level” and with “High Level” by treatment group at baseline and at different visit time -
points with data collected post- baseline.  The same statistical method and modeling as used for the 
primary endpoint will be used for this analysis. The proportion of subjects “Normal” at baseline and at each visit with data post -baseline will be compared between the two treatments using 
Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test controlling for the stratification variable anti -
TNF agents use (yes/no ). 
 
Supplementary shift tables will be presented showing proportion of subjects at baseline that were 
in each category and shifted from one category to another or remained in the same category  at the 
different post-ba seline visits.    
 
6.3.3.9 Stool Marker of Inflammation : Fecal calprotectin  
 The fecal calprotectin is used as marker  of inflammation . The level of fecal calprotectin  data 
collected at different visits will be used to assess inflammation at baseline and at different visits 
post- baseline. Summary descriptive statistics for the actual observed and change from baseline 
will include mean, standard deviation, median and range for each treatment by visit. The change 
from baseline Fecal calprotectin comparing the two treatment groups will be analyzed using an 
analysi s of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment group, stratification variable anti- TNF 
agents use (yes/no) as classification factors, and baseline Fecal  calprotectin as a covariate.  The 
treatment parameter estimates from the analysis model including means,  95% confidence 
intervals and associated 2 -sided p- values will be presented including bar graphs.  
 In addition, fecal calprotectin  will be classified into two categories: “Normal (≤ 162.9 mcg/g )” 
and “High (> 162.9 mcg/g )”.  Summary results will show number of patients and proportion (%) 
with “Normal level” and with “High Level” by treatment group at baseline and at different visit time-points with data collected post- baseline. The same statistical method and modeling as used 
for the primary endpoint will be used for this analysis. The proportion of subjects “Normal” at baseline and each visit with data post -baseline will be compared between the two treatments 
using Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) chi -square test controlling for the stratification variable 
anti-TNF agents use (yes/no ). 
 
Supplementary shift tables will be presented showing proportion of subjects at baseline that were 
in each category and shifted from one category to another or remained in the same category at the different post- baseline visits.

6.3.3.10 Endoscopic Assessment Based on CDEIS  and SES -CD at Week 26  
 
The Crohn’s Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) is a validated quantitative measure of disease severity upon endoscopy. The score ranges from 0-44 based upon the extent and 
severity of inflammation and ulcers seen during endoscopy of the colony. A response is a drop in 
score from baseline.  
 The Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s Disease (SES -CD) is a validated quantitative measure 
of disease severity upon endoscopy that is based on four  endoscopic variables (presence and size 
of ulcers, proportion of surface covered by ulcers, proportion of surface affected by disease, and presence and severity of stenosis). Each variable is assessed in each of the five ileocolic 
segments: Rectum, sigmoid and left colon, transverse colon, right colon, and ileum. Each of the 
four SES- CD variables is scored from 0 to 3, with the sum of the scores for each variable ranging 
from 0 to 15, except for the presence and extent of stenosis, which ranges from 0 to 11 (T otal 
SES- CD score range 0–56). 
 
The CDEIS  and SES -CD mean score s at baseline  and week 26, and change from baseline score s 
to week 26 will be summarized by treatment group for subjects who consent to undergo colonoscopy. The change from baseline CDEIS  and SES -CD scores comparing the two treatment 
groups based on each of the two scoring systems will be analyzed using analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) model s with treatment group, stratification variable anti -TNF agents use (yes/no) as 
classification factors,  and baseline CDEIS score or SES -CD as covariate.  The treatment 
parameter estimates from the analysis model s including means, 95% confidence intervals and 
associated 2 -sided p- values will be presented.    
 In addition, the CDEIS and SES- CD scores will be classified into two categories: “Remission 
(CDEIS 0 -3 score; SES- CD 0 -2 score)” and “No Remission (CDEIS > 3; SES- CD > 2 score )”.  
Summary results will show number of patients and proportion (%) in  “Remission ” based on 
CDEIS  and also based on SES-CD by trea tment group at baseline and at different visit time -
points with data collected post- baseline.  The same statistical method and modeling as used for the 
primary endpoint will be used for this analysis.  
 
The proportion of subjects  at baseline and each visit  in “Remission  post- baseline will be 
compared between the two treatments using Cochran -Mantel -Haenszel (CMH)  chi-square test 
controlling for the stratification variable anti- TNF agents use (yes/no ). The same statistical 
summary will be repeated  comparing the two treatment groups on proportion of responders based 
on CDEIS and SES -CD scores defined as 50% reduction from baseline score and 25% reduction 
from baseline score to week 26.  
 Supplementary shift tables will be presented showing proportion of subject s at baseline that were 
in “No Remission” category and shifted to “Remission” category or vice versa or remained in the same category at the different post -baseline visits.  
 
The following highlights the efficacy summar ies in form of tables and/or figures that will be 
displayed by treatment group  for both the CDEIS and SES- CD outcomes assessments:  
• Endoscopic Remission based CDEIS and SES- CD week 26

Additional supportive analysis will be implemented to  estimate t he correlation s between the 
change from baseline to w eek 26  in the SES- CD total score, CDEIS total score , and the change 
from baseline to w eek 26 in the CDAI total score. The results will be presented in graph s 
including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients estimates.  Scatter plot s of the change in 
SES- CD total score and CDEIS total  score versus the change in CDAI total score will be 
presented .

6.3.4 Other Exploratory Endpoints  
 
6.3.4.1 MAP Detection: Blood PCR Assay, Blood Culture Test an d Colon Biopsy PCR Assa y 
 
Initial blood culture analyses will be performed upon unblinding of the study using data that is 
available at the time of the data lock.   However, subsequent analyses will be performed to allow 
for further development of the MAP PCR Blood Assay as well as to allow for the 6 month period required to grow MAP in culture for participants whose samples did not had adequate culture 
growth duration at the time of the data lock.  Subsequent analyses will occur when all baseline 
samples fo r participants have at least 6 months of duration to grow MAP in culture, next analyses 
will be repeated when participants with 26 and 52 week data have corresponding 6 and 12 month 
MAP culture measurements, and finally an analysis will be performed once all participants have 
their corresponding 6 month MAP culture measurements available.   Since this outcome measure 
is among the exploratory measures and not considered a primary efficacy endpoint,   performing 
analyses at several time points based on the avai lability of 6 -month MAP culture measurements is 
justified and will not  jeopardize the rigor of the statistical testing proposed for the primary and 
secondary endpoints.    
 MAP detection analysis is intended to be exploratory. More exploratory analyses may  be done 
but the decision on additional types of analyses will depend on the available data and the final 
decision s will be made at the time of analysis. Data collected on MAP detection based on PCR 
Blood Assay, Blood Culture Test and Colon Biopsy PCR assa y will be summarized and presented 
as follows:  
 
• Proportion of subjects (positive/Negative) for MAP at baseline and weeks 26 and week 52 post- baseline will be summarized by treatment group.  
 
• Shift tables summarizing shifts in status (positive to negative; negative to positive, no change) from baseline to week 26 and week 52 post- baseline will be presented by 
treatment.  
 
The same statistical approach as for the primary analysis will be employed to compare proportion of subjects (positive/negative) for the RH B-104 treated group versus Placebo treated group on

Additional analysis will be implemented to estimate the correlations between the change from 
baseline to week 26 and week 52 in PCR Blood Assay level, Blood Culture Test, Colon Biopsy 
PCR Assay level, and the change from baseline to week 26 and week 52 in the CDAI total score. The results will be presented in graphs including Pearson and Spearman correlation coefficients 
estimates.  Scatter plots of the change in Blood PCR Assay, Blood Culture Test, and Colon 
Biopsy PCR Assay level versus the change in CDAI total score will be presented . 
 
6.3.4.2 Drug Lev els in Tissue Samples  
 
This is an exploratory analysis and will depend on the samples available at the end of the study 
for analysis. The tissue samples being collected will be analyzed for drug levels if possible at the 
end of the study. The patient listings will be presented with correlation of drug levels with CDAI 
and the other efficacy parameters assessed.

Population PK analysis will be detailed in a separate document. 
 
6.5 Safety Analysis  
 
All summarization of safety data will b e based on the safety population.  
 
6.5.1 Adverse Events  
 
Each verbatim adverse event (AE) term recorded during the study will be mapped to a system 
organ class and preferred term using the current MedDRA Dictionary.  
 
A treatment -emergent AE (TEAE) is defined as an AE  that based on start date information 
occurred after the  first study drug administration or an AE that started before the first study drug 
administration but worsened in severity (i.e., became more severe) after administration of the study drug.  
 
Treatment related adverse events will be defined as the adverse events for  which the investigator 
indicates the relationship to study drug as possible, probable, or definite. If the relationship to 
study drug for  an AE is not recorded, it will be assumed to  be treatment related in the summary 
tables. Similarly, if severity of an AE is missing, the severity will be summarized as severe. 
 
A by -subject listing of all AEs (including non- treatment -emergent AEs) will be provided and will 
include all AE data recorded on the eCRF. All summaries of AEs will present the number and percent of subjects reported events by system organ class and preferred term and  by treatment 
group. If a subject has multiple occurrences of an AE, the subject will be counted only once in the 
respective AE.

CONFIDENTIAL  40 Continuous laboratory values will be summarized descriptively by treatment gro up over time for 
each visit and as change from baseline to each visit . Categorical laboratory values will be 
summarized as the number and percentages of subjects in each  category by treatment group over 
time for visit. 
 
Laboratory parameters will also be summarized in shift tables by treatment, to determine the number and percentage of subjects  with measurements classified in a particular category at each 
post- baseline visit with reference to the same classification at baseline.  Bioc hemistry and 
hematology parameters (which are continuous in nature) will use the classifications of low, 
normal, and high relative to normal ranges, whereas appropriate categories will be selected for 
urinalysis parameters (which are categorical in nature), for example, normal and abnormal. 
 
Subjects missing a value at any time point will be excluded from the summary statistics for that time point. If a subject has more than one  value at any time point, then the latest non missing 
value will be used  for summarization. All values will be presented in the data listings.  
 
Listings of all individual laboratory data, indicating any values out of the normal range will be 
produced. A listing of lab parameter values flagged as abnormal will also be provided.    
 
6.5.3  Vital Signs     
 
Vital sig ns include the following:  
• Supine systolic blood pressure (SBP)   
• Supine diastolic b lood pressure (DBP)   
• Supine pulse rate   
• Respiratory rate  
• Temperature 
• Height  
• Weight  
• BMI  
 
Vital signs are recorded at baseline and at different visits post -baseline. Actual a nd change from 
baseline values will be summarized using descriptive statistics by visit and treatment group. The 
mean, standard deviation, median, and range will be used to summarize the data. For each 
subject, vi tal signs data will be presented in a data listing.  
 
6.5.4 12-Lead ECG  
 
Study investigators will record each subject ECG data. The significance and interpretation of each 
ECG finding and a ssessment s of the QTc and other ECG intervals will be made by the ECG 
specialized Lab.  All ECG data will be presented  in the subject data listing s with annotations 
indicating any abnormal values .  For analysis details and presentation of the ECG findings , a

Uveitis confirmed (yes or no).  
 
6.6 Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DS MB)  
 
In order to ensure the safety of study participants, a Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will 
be established to monitor data on an ongoing basis. The committee will meet periodically to 
review  interim safety data. Following their review, the DSMB wi ll recommend whether the study 
should continue  as is  or be modified to improve safety. The DSMB will consist of at least one 
clinician with  experience in the care of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and at least one 
statistician.  The DSMB charter w ill describe the membership, responsibilities , meeting 
procedures related to the DSMB, output to be reviewed, and interim analysis rules to be applied. The DSMB at regular intervals will review  the following, at each of the safety analyses meetings:  
• Demogr aphic and baseline characteristics  
• Physical exam, vital signs, clinical laboratory findings, ECG findings  
• Summaries of SAE, AEs and deaths 
• Summaries of subject withdrawals  
• Summaries of subject accrual and retention  
• Summaries of protocol violations 
 The DSM B will carefully consider safety results and then provide a recommendation for 
continuing or stopping the trial for safety to the Sponsor after each DSMB safety meeting. There 
are three planned DSMB meetings for the study. The first meeting is planned for when 25% of 
patients reach 26 weeks of treatment. The second and third meetings are to occur after 50% and 75% of patients have completed 26 weeks of treatment or terminated study participation early. 
Once the required numbers of patients have reached each  of these thresholds, a database snapshot  
will occur. The DSMB will convene to review safety data within 3 months of the data base snapshot . The timing between each DSMB meeting will be at least 6  months. 
 
In addition, it is anticipated that during the sec ond DSMB meeting, an interim efficacy (or 
inefficacy) and futility analys es will be performed and the results of this analysis evaluated by the 
DSMB . 
 
It is prospectively planned as specified in the protocol that the second DSMB meeting at 50% 
randomized s ubjects will comprise a formal interim of safety and efficacy (or inefficacy) and 
futility analyses will be performed and the results of this analysis evaluated by the DSMB.  
 
6.7 Interim Analysis  
 
One prospectively planned interim analysis for safety and futil ity is planned after 50% (205) 
patients have completed week 26 of treatment. The DSMB will evaluate the results from this 
analysis to assess RHB -104 safety, efficacy (or inefficacy), and the feasibility of continuing or 
stopping the study. The planned interim analysis is designed to have an alpha level of 0.003 as the 
criteria for stopping the trial early for efficacy or inefficacy based on using the O’Brein -Fleming 
spending function to determine the test boundaries.  For the interim analysis, the Cochran-Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test will be used to compare treatment groups controlling for the

CONFIDENTIAL  42 stratification variable (anti -TNF agents (yes/no). The interim test is a 2 -sided test (P=0.003), 
meaning that the trial can be stopped if there is overwhelming evidence of efficacy or 
overwhelming evidence of inefficacy.  Further details are provided in the DSMB charter  for this 
study.   
 
The protocol specified α -spending for the prospectively plan interim analysis is 0.003. A ll tests at 
the final analysis will be conducted at significance level of α = 0.049.  The interim analyses will 
consider subjects with missing 26 week assessments to not be in a state of remission at 26 weeks.  
 
Regarding the interim efficacy (or inefficacy) of the data, recommendations for early termination 
will be guided by the Lan- DeMets alpha-spending implementation of O’Brien- Fleming spending 
function to determine the test boundaries . The efficacy boundary preserves the overall 2 -sided 
study alpha level of 0.05.  The alpha level at first & second sequential test is 0.003 & 0.049, respectively.  
 
The DSMB will carefully consider the safety and efficacy interim results and then pr ovide a 
recommendation for continuing or stopping the study. The sponsor and all personnel involved in the conduct of the study will remain blinded to the treatment assigned to each subject.
 The DSMB 
will disseminate interim results in a manner that will p rotect the scientific and ethical aspects of 
the study. The responsibility of the DSMB, the scope of the data to be reviewed, the organization 
of the review process, dissemination requirements and procedures are described in DSMB 
charter.  
 
6.8 Changes to Stat istical Analysis Methods Planned in the Protocol  
 
Changes to planned analyses from the protocol will be  incorporated in the SAP, if they occur 
before the unblinding of the database.  
7. ADDITIONAL OTHER EXPLOATORY ANALYSES  
 
Other exploratory subgroup analyses to characterize safety and efficacy activities of HRB -104 
versus placebo may be conducted. These additional exploratory analyses will be decided at the time of final data analysis.

 SYNOPSIS    
Compound Name/No.  ATR-101  
Study Number  ATR-101-201 
Study Title  A Phase 2, Multicenter, Study of  ATR-101 for the Treatment 
of Congenital Adrena l Hyperplasia  
Phase of Clinical 
Development  2 
Objective(s) Primary:  The primary objective of thi s study is to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of orally adm inistered ATR-101 in subjects 
with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). 
Secondary:  
 To evaluate the changes in adrenal cortical steroids and 
steroid intermediates   
 To evaluate the changes t o the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal axis (via ACTH) 
 To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ATR-101 
Study Design This is a multicenter, singl e-blind, multiple dose study of ATR -
101 with a placebo washout component. The Screening Period 
will be followed by a placebo, Baseline Lead-in Period. Subjects will then receive th e lowest dose of ATR-101 for 14 
days followed by a single-blind placebo Washout Period of 14 days. Safety and efficacy assessments will occur at the end of ATR-101 treatment and following the Washout Period. If the primary outcome measure (17-OHP ≤ 2x ULN) is not achieved, the subject will procee d to the next higher dose leve l.  
ATR-101 treatment will stop once the primary outcome measure is met. A total of 5 ATR -101 dose levels are possible.  
Duration of Study   Approximately 12 months  
Number of Centers 5-8 in United States  
Number/Type of Subjects   Minimum of 9 with a maximum of 17. Classic CAH due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD). 
Study Treatments   ATR-101 tablets twice daily by m outh. ATR-101 tablets will 
be available in 125, 250 and 500 mg doses with matching placebo tablets. Five dose leve ls are planned: 125 mg BID, 250 
mg BID, 500 mg BID, 750 mg BID and 1000 mg BID.  
Duration of Treatment Treatment duration will range from a minimum of approximately 2 months to 6 months  per subject. Subjects will 
have a Screening Period of  up to 21 days and then enter a 
placebo Baseline Lead-in Per iod of 14 days.  Each dose level

Criteria for Evaluation  Pharmacokinetics:   ATR-101 (and its metabolites) 
pharmacokinetic parameters will be assessed. 
 Pharmacodynamics:  Changes in adrenal cor tical steroids and 
steroid intermediates (e.g. 17-OHP, androstenedione, 
testosterone, free testoste rone, sex hormone binding globulin 
(SHBG), dehydroepiandroste rone (DHEA), DHEA-S, 
aldosterone, PRA); Changes in ACTH  
 Safety:   Safety assessment will consist of monitoring and 
recording: adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE); changes in physical examinations, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs); re gular monitori ng of hematology, 
prothrombin time (PT)/activate d partial thromb oplastin time 
(aPTT), INR, blood chemistry, steroid hormones and urine analysis values. 
Stopping Criteria Investigational Medicinal Product (IMP) may be discontinued due to a safety event. Once a s ubject has met the efficacy 
endpoint, no further administration of study drug will be permitted. 
Study Endpoints Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  The primary efficacy endpoint 
will be the overall response ra te defined by the percentage of 
subjects meeting the primary outcome measure as follows: 
 17-OHP < 2 x ULN 
Safety Endpoints: Safety parameters (AEs, vital signs, 
physical examination, laboratory measures, ECG)  
Pharmacokinetic Endpoints:   
 Area under the curve (AUC 0-4 hr) 
 Maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) 
 Time to maximum concentration (Tmax) 
Statistical Methods  Qualitative statistical analy ses will be performed for both 
safety and efficacy parameters.

 a Day -21 to Day -1 will be used t o collect data from the Screeni ng assessments.  
b Baseline Lead-In with placebo will be a  minimum of 14 days but an additional 3 days is allowed. 
c For each Dose Level there will be 14 days of treatment with AT R-101 and 14 days of treatment with placebo.  For each portion there should be a 
minimum of 11 days of treatment and a maximum of +3 days is all owed beyond the scheduled 14 days. 
d Dose assessment will be performed  prior to dosing on Day 1 of Dose Levels 2, 3, 4 and 5 as needed.  The PI or SI will review the 17-OHP results 
obtained on Day 15 and determine whether the Final Study Visit will be conducted (17-OHP ≤2 x ULN on Day 15) or whether the ne xt Dose 
Level, Day 1 Visit will be conducted (17-OHP > 2 x ULN on Day 1 5).   
e 17-OHP results from Screening and Baseline Lead-In Period will  be used in this evaluation of inclusion criteria. 
f Complete physical examinations will be performed at Screening and the Final Study Visit or Early Termination Visit. An abbrev iated (brief) 
physical exam will be performed  at Day 1 of Baseline Lead-In Period, pre-dose on Day 1 and Day 15 of each dose level.   
g Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate, and temperature) and body weight will be measured at Screening, Day 1 o f the Baseline Lead-
In Period, pre-dose and 1, 2, and 4 hour post-dose on Day 1 of each dose level, Day 15 for each dose level, and at the Final S tudy Visit or 
Early Termination Visit.  Height will be measured at Screening.  
h All subjects will have 12-lead E CG assessments at Screening, D ay 1 pre-dose and 2 hours post-dose for each dose level, Day 15  pre-dose for 
each dose level, and at the completion of the Placebo Washout P eriod on Day 29. 
i Blood samples for steroid hormones and steroid intermediates including 17-OHP, androstenedione , cortisol, testosterone, ACTH,  free 
testosterone, SHBG, aldosterone , 11-DOC, PRA, DHEA and DHEAS wi ll be obtained at Screening, Day 1 of Baseline Lead-In Period, pre-
dose on Day 1 and Day 15 of each dose level and at the Final St udy Visit or Early Termination Visit.  All samples will be coll ected prior to 10 
AM. 
j Blood samples for exogenous gluco corticoid levels (Betamethaso ne, Budesonide, Dexamethasone, F ludrocortisone, Flunisolide, 
Fluorometholone, Hydrocortisone, Megestrol acetate, Methylpredn isolone, Prednisolone, Prednis one, Triamcinolone, Triamcinolone  
acetonide) will be obtained as appropriate for each subject.  
k Obtained for females of childbearing potential who are not sur gically sterile or who have not  been naturally postmenopausal f or at least 12 
consecutive months (i.e., who have  had menses any time in the p receding 12 consecutive months).  A serum pregnancy test will b e performed 
at Screening. A urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to  dosing on Day 1 of each Dose Leve l and at the Final Study Visit or Early 
Termination Visit.  
l Blood for PK analysis of ATR101 and its metabolites in plasma will be obtained on Day 1 of each Dose Level at pre-dose and 1,  2, 3, and 4 hours 
post-dose; on Day 15 of each Dose Level at pre-dose and at the Final Study Visit or Early Termination Visit. A window of ± 10 minutes is 
permitted around each sampling time-point. 
m The first dose will be administered on site on Day 1 and Day 1 5 of each dose level. 
n All bottles and unused tablets m ust be returned to the study s ite on Day 1 and Day 15 of each dose level and at the Final Study Visit or Early 
Termination Visit. 
o IMP compliance will be assessed b y counting the number of tabl ets returned and determining if the correct number were taken w ithin the 
window of 80% to 120%. 
p AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs the info rmed consent form until 30 days after the last dose of IMP. 
q Tests do not need to be repeated on Day 1 of Baseline Lead-In i f the subject’s clinical condition has not changed and these te sts were done < 14 
days prior to Day 1

 1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Description of Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia 
Congenital adrenal hyp erplasia (CAH) consis ts of genetic disord ers affecting the 
synthesis of cortisol from the adrenal glands.  More than 90% of all CAH cases are due to 
defects in the cytochrome P 450 enzyme steroid 21-hydroxylase, a lso known as 
21-hydroxylase or CYP21A2.1  The enzyme 21-hydroxylase facilitates the conversion of 
17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) to 11-deoxycortisol , the immedi ate precursor of 
cortisol. Additionally, 21-hydroxylase is responsible for the c onversion of progesterone 
to 11-deoxycorticosterone, the precursor of aldosterone.1 Depending on the severity of 
the enzyme defect, partial or com plete glucocorticoid (GC) and mineralocorticoid (MC) 
deficiency may exist. Two forms  of 21-hydroxylase deficiency (2 1-OHD) have been 
defined: “classic” 21-OHD is asso ciated with cortisol insuffici ency and “nonclassic” 21-
OHD is associated with mild subclin ical impairment of cortisol synthesis.2  The 
remaining cases (<10%) of CAH are mainly due to four other enzy me deficiencies (i.e. 
P450scc, P450c17, 11 -hydroxylase, 3 -hydroysteroid dehydroge nase), a cholesterol 
protein defect (StAR) and one electron-transfer protein.3 
In the US, Newborn screening for CAH began in the late 1970’s w ith the ability to 
readily measure 17-OHP.4  Elevated 17-OHP, the hallmark of CAH due to 21-OHD, 
occurs in the setting of impaired ability to convert 11-deoxyco rtisol to cortisol and 
progesterone to deoxycorticoster one. Prior to screening measure s to identify CAH 
patients and treatment with G C therapy, undiagnosed/untreated CAH was associated with 
significant morbidity and mortality.   
Replacement GC and MC therapy are  the mainstays of CAH treatment. In spite of many 
decades of GC replacement therapy and CAH patients surviving in to adulthood, CAH 
remains a challenging and difficult disease to manage. Lack of cortisol feedback 
inhibition results in markedly i ncreased ACTH production which over time results in 
enlarged adrenal glands. The adrenals of adult patients with CA H produce a large amount 
of only a few steroids: progesterone, 17-OHP, dehydroepiandrost erone (DHEA) and its 
sulfate (DHEA-S).5   Management of classic CAH enta ils a difficult balance betwee n GC 
replacement required for survi val versus higher, supra-physiologic (pharmacologic) doses 
needed to suppress ACTH levels and decrease androgen production  without causing 
iatrogenic Cushing’s syndrome (CS). Women have the added challe nges of androgen 
excess (e.g., hirsutism, acne a nd alopecia) and potentially the  inability to conceive.5 
Women may also develop a secondary polycystic ovary syndrome (P COS) since 
androgens and 17-OHP also derive from the ovaries and may persi st even after adrenal 
suppression.6   Men may have complications of  androgen excess manifesting as 
suppression of gonadotropins leading to testicular atrophy and infertility.7  Additionally, 
up to 50% of men may have testicular adrenal r est tumors which can become quite large 
and painful along with causing testicular dysfunction.8  Thus, there are three major 
concerns for the management of adults with 21-OHD: (1) preventi on of adrenal and 
gonadal hyperplasia and neoplasia, (2) prevention of long-term consequences of adrenal 
replacement therapies, and (3)  restoration of fertility in thos e who desire to have 
children.5

 1.2 Rationale for Use of ATR-101 in C ongenital Adrenal Hyperplasia  
ATR-101 inhibition of adrenal stero id and steroid intermediate synthesis may provide an 
extremely valuable tool for the c linician managing CAH. Inhibition of adrenal 
steroidogenesis across the androgen pathway would negate the need to suppress ACTH 
with supra-physiologic doses of GC and prevent the risk of iatrogenic CS. CAH patients may then require only physiologic doses of GC replacement. Use of ATR-101 in the 
treatment of CAH is supported by extensive mechanism of action studies, robust non-
clinical proof of concept data and exposure of approximately 50  patients with 
adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) in a Phase 1 study.   
The mechanism of action of ATR- 101 has been studied extensively  in vitro and in vivo. 
ACAT1, the molecular target of  ATR-101, is highly expressed in the adrenal glands 
compared with other tissues
9 and ATR-101 is found at higher le vels in the adrenal glands 
compared to other sites in the body,10 both of which are likel y to contribute to the 
selectivity of ATR-101’s effects on the adrenal glands. ATR-101 disrupts adrenal 
cholesterol homeostasi s via ACAT1, an enzym e that catalyzes the  esterification of free 
cholesterol (FC) to cholesterol ester (CE). In the adrenal glan ds, CE serves as a substrate 
reservoir for steroid biosynthesis. At low doses/exposures, ATR -101 treatment results in 
reduction of the CE reservoir and leads to reduced synthesis of  adrenal steroids.  Higher 
doses/exposures of ATR-101 cause f urther disruption of the norm al FC/CE ratio which 
leads to endoplasmic reticulum stress and activation of the unf olded protein response. If 
left unresolved, this cascade res ults in apoptosis. The results present a clear molecular 
understanding of the dose-dependen t, novel mechanism of action of ATR-101. 
Two proof of concept dog studies  have been conducted which validate the mechanism of 
action studies.10  The first study in normal beagle dogs (N=3) were administered  ATR-
101 at 3 mg/kg/day for 7 days, f ollowed by 30 mg/kg/day for 7 days. At the conclusion of 
the study, adrenal CE levels we re markedly decreased and there were dose-and time-
dependent decreases in the level s of all adrenal steroids and steroid intermediates tested. 
The second study was conducted in dogs with natu rally-occurring  CS. Ten dogs with 
confirmed CS (three adrenal and s even pituitary etiology) were treated as follows: four 
dogs received 2 weeks of treatme nt (3 mg/kg/day x 1 week, follo wed by 30 mg/kg/day x 
1 week); six dogs received 4 weeks  of treatment (3 mg/kg/day x 1 week, followed by 
30 mg/kg/day x 3 weeks). Nine out of 10 dogs experienced reductions in ACTH-stimulated cortisol concentrati ons. The mean reduction in post- ACTH stimulated cortisol 
concentration was 51.5% at the ti me of study completion. ATR-101 was well tolerated in 
both dog studies with no meaningful  safety issues identified. T hese studies, along with 
the in vitro mechanism of action studies, s upport the use of ATR-101 in end ocrine 
diseases of adrenal dysfunction. 
Additional evidence of the adrenal-specific effects of ATR-101 comes from 4-week and 
13-week dog toxicity studies. I n the 13-week dog study, nine of  12 animals (four males, 
five females) at 30/20 mg/kg BID  and three of eight animals (on e male, two females) at 
10/7.5 mg/kg BID exhibited clinical  signs consistent with adren al insufficiency. The 
earliest presentation occurred on Day 17. Replacement glucocort icoid (GC) and 
mineralocorticoid (MC) therapy with subcutaneous prednisone and  fludrocortisone 
Millendo Therapeutics,  Inc. ATR-101-201  
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 17 of 66 
 resulted in marked clinical improvements.  Similar but less rob ust effects (e.g. no changes 
in basal cortisol) were observed in the 4-week study and replac ement GC/MC therapy 
was not required. ATR-101-relate d gross pathologic changes cons isted of bilaterally 
small adrenal glands in both sex es at ≥3 mg/kg BID which correl ated with atrophy of the 
adrenal cortex microscopicall y.  Both 4-week and 13-week studies suggested that the 
effects of ATR-101, even at the higher doses, are partially rev ersible. The decreases in 
adrenal function (decreases in ba sal and ACTH-stimulated cortis ol measurements), 
decreased adrenal weights and histologic changes, were all anti cipated based upon 
published studies.11, 12  
In addition to the nonclinical dev elopment program, ATR-101 is currently being tested in 
a Phase 1, first-in-human, maxi mum tolerated dose (MTD) study, in ACC. ACC is a rare, 
but highly malignant and aggres sive cancer. ATR-101 doses for t his indication are 
markedly higher (i.e. currentl y approximately 97.9 mg/kg/day) a nd are targeted for 
apoptotic effects. Mean AUC 0-24 values as high as ~45,000 ng hr/mL have been observed 
with acceptable toxicity (i.e. MTD has yet to be defined).   
In summary, ATR-101 presents an i ntriguing spectrum of dose-dep endent therapeutic 
options ranging from inhibition of  adrenal steroidogenesis at lower doses to apoptotic 
effects at higher doses. The use of ATR-101 for the treatment o f CAH presents a novel 
therapeutic approach.

 3 INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN 
3.1 Overall Study Design and Plan 
This is a multicenter, singl e-blind, multiple dose study of ATR -101 with a placebo washout 
component. A minimum of nine s ubjects will be enrolled with the potential to add an 
additional eight subjects.  The study design is presented in Fi gure 1.  
Figure 1 Study Design 
 
           
 
 
Each subject will complete a  Screening Period of up to 21 days to assess inclusion and 
exclusion criteria. Baseline stat us will be established with a 14 day single-blind, placebo 
Lead-in Period.  Exogenous GC and MC replacement therapy must b e maintained Dose Levels 2, 3, 4 and 5 follow 
the same 28 day period as

 throughout the duration of the study. Each dose level will last  for a total of 28 days (see 
Figure 2). All subjects will start at Dose Level 1, ATR-101 125  mg BID, for 14 days. 
Efficacy and safety will be assessed after the 14 day ATR-101 treatment period (on the 
morning of day 15). Immediately after the completion of the ATR -101 treatment period, a 
14 day single-blind, placebo Washout Period (placebo matching A TR-101 125 mg) will take 
place. The efficacy assessment obtained on day 15 will be revie wed by the Principal 
Investigator (PI) or Sub-investig ator (SI) to determine if the subject has met the primary 
outcome measure or whether the  subject should continue to the n ext dose level (if there are 
no safety issues).

Subjects will return to the study center after completion of th e 14 day placebo Washout 
Period and will follow one of two actions based upon day 15 efficacy results: 
 If the primary outcome measure is met (i.e. 17-OHP < 2 x ULN ) the subject completes 
the Final Study Visit  
 If the primary outcome measure is not met (i.e. 17-OHP > 2 x ULN ) the subject 
continues to the next dose level  
Table 1 presents the 5 ATR-101 D ose Levels. Dose Levels 2, 3, 4 and 5 will follow the 
same procedures as Dose Level 1 ( i.e. treatment with ATR-101 fo r 14 days, followed by the 
placebo Washout Period of 14 days).  A subject may receive a mi nimum of one dose level 
(Level 1) or a maximum of 5 dose levels (Level 1-5), along with  the corresponding placebo

3.1.1 Screening Period 
Each subject will have a Screening Period of up to 21 days. The Screening Period will 
assess whether a subject is elig ible to participate in the stud y. All Inclusion and Exclusion 
criteria will be a ssessed during this period. The 21 day period  provides flexibility to 
complete laboratory tests and clinical assessments.     
 
3.1.2 Baseline Lead-in Period 
Eligible subjects will enter a  placebo Baseline Lead-in Period.   This 14 day period allows 
subjects to get accustomed to being in a clinical trial (e.g. avoiding prohibited medications) 
and taking investigational medicinal product (IMP) on a regular basis. This period also provides an opportunity to develop a more accurate assessment o f adrenal steroids and 
steroid intermediates and documen tation of exogenous steroid replacement therapy (GC and 
MC).   In order to obtain unbiased information, the subjects will not know that the tablets received 
are placebo and do not contain activ e drug substance (ATR-101).  Placebo tablets for this 
period will look identical to ATR -101 125 mg tablets (i.e. Dose  Level 1). However, the 
study center personnel will be aware that the tablets are place bo.  
 At the conclusion of the Baseline Lead-in Period, subjects will  be assessed for protocol 
compliance, including IMP complia nce (tablet counts) and whethe r it is appropriate to 
proceed in the study.    
3.1.3 Dose Level 1 (ATR-101 125 mg B ID and matching placebo) 
All subjects will start at Dose Level 1 which uses ATR-101 125 mg tablets dosed twice per 
day (BID). ATR-101 will be taken for 14 consecutive days.   Efficacy and safety (including laboratory measures and clinical assessment) will be assessed during a study visit after the completion of the 14 day ATR-101  treatment period (i.e. 
morning of day 15). Subjects should take the last dose of ATR-101 Dose Level 1 on the 
evening of day 14.   Day 15 (of the dosing period) will be the start of the single-blind, placebo Washout Period. The morning dose for day 15 should be  taken from the new bottle  dispensed at the day 15 
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 21 of 66 
 visit. Processing of laboratory tests obtained on day 15 will t ake place during the fourteen 
day placebo Washout Period.    
 
Subjects will take a placebo tab let BID. Study site personnel w ill know that this is a placebo 
period, but subjects should remain blinded (i.e. not know when they are receiving ATR-101 
and when they are receiving placebo).  At the end of the 28 day period ( i.e. 14 days of ATR-101 and 14 days of single-blind 
placebo washout), subjects will re turn to the study center. Lab oratory tests and safety 
assessments will be conducted at this visit. Prior to this visi t, the PI or SI will have reviewed 
the efficacy and safety laboratory values taken at the end of the ATR-101 treatment period (i.e. day 15). If the primary outcome measure is met (i.e. 17-O HP < 2 x ULN) this visit will 
be designated the Final Study Vis it and the subject will not co ntinue to Dose Level 2. 
However, if the primary outcome measure is not met (i.e. 17-OHP  > 2 x ULN) and there are 
no safety concerns, the subject wi ll continue to Dose Level 2.  
 
3.1.4 Dose Levels 2, 3, 4 and 5  
Dose Levels 2, 3, 4 and 5 will follow the same procedures as Dose Level 1. Dose Level 2, (ATR-101 250 mg BID) will be tak en for 14 consecutive days. At the completion of the 
14 day treatment period, subjects will return to the study cent er for assessment of efficacy 
and safety (including laborator y measures and clinical assessment).  The 14 day single-
blind, placebo Washout Period will then start. After completion  of the placebo Washout 
Period, subjects will return to the  study center (laboratory te sting and safety assessment will 
occur) and either a Final Study Visit will take place or the su bjects will continue to Dose 
Level 3. Dose Levels 3, 4 and 5 will follow the same course of action.  
 
3.1.5 Final Study Visit 
The Final Study Visit will take place once a subject has met th e primary outcome measure at 
the completion of Dose Levels 1- 4 or at the completion of Dose Level 5. This visit will be 
the final visit to the study center. 
3.1.6 Follow-up Visit 
Two weeks after the Final Study V isit or Early Termination Visit, a Follow-up Visit will 
take place. This will consist of  a telephone interview with the  subject to determine if any 
safety events need to be reporte d and to record concomitant medications, especially GC and 
MC. 
3.2 Rationale for Study De sign and Dose Levels 
CAH is a rare disease with a limited number of potential subjec ts. Therefore, the study 
design must derive as much information as possible from each su bject while simultaneously 
presenting as little risk as po ssible. This study protocol prov ides the potential for each 
subject to achieve the primary out come measure at the lowest po ssible dose with a minimum 
duration of exposure (i.e. 14 days  per dose level). In addition , the placebo Washout Period 
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 22 of 66 
 ensures that each subject has re turned to baseline status prior  to receiving the next highest 
dose of ATR-101. This period also s erves to verify that changes  in adrenal steroids and 
steroid intermediates are due to ATR-101 effects. Thus, this pr otocol design will generate a 
robust dataset with a limited num ber of subjects which can establish proof of concept for the 
use of ATR-101 in CAH. 
 The starting dose for all subjects will be ATR-101 125 mg taken BID orally with food. This dose corresponds to approximately 3 mg/kg/day for a 75 kg indiv idual and is intended to be 
a non-effective dose. While the 3 mg/kg/day dose was efficacious in dog studies, the 
exposures (i.e. AUC
0-24 hr  mean ~4700 ng hr/mL) were much higher re lative to the projected 
corresponding exposures in humans.  Based on pharmacokinetic mo deling from the 
available human data (ACC subjects and healthy volunteer food e ffect study13), the 125 mg 
BID dose will provide a steady-state AUC 0-24 hr  of ~2308 ng hr/mL. Dose Level 2 (250 mg 
BID) will provide an AUC 0-24 hr of ~4616 nghr/mL. Each subsequent dose level (3, 4 and 5) 
will increase the ATR-101 dos e by 500 mg per day, with projecte d steady-state AUC 0-24 hr  
values of ~9234, 13850 and 18467 ng hr/mL, respectively. Thus, the projected exposures 
span a non-effective range up to approximately 4-times the effe ctive exposure observed in 
the dog studies which allows fo r potential pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic differences 
between dogs and humans.  
 The Phase 1 ACC study provides tr emendous reassurance for the s afety of the doses 
proposed for this pr otocol in that AUC
0-24 hr  exposures as well as the duration of treatment 
have already far surpassed thos e being proposed. The highest ex posures observed (to date) 
in the ACC study have been ~45,000 nghr/mL. These exposures ha ve been well- tolerated 
and the study will continue to dose escalate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or 
Phase 2/3 dose has been identified.10  In addition, the average duration of exposure was 60 
days across the 11 dose cohorts. A TR-101 has been extremely wel l tolerated in a patient 
population that is markedly less r obust (all have advanced stag e cancer and most have 
undergone multiple prior treatment regimens) relative to the CA H patient population. 
 The dosing rationale is furthe r supported by the 13-week dog to xicity study with AUC
0-24 hr  
margins relative to the dog No Obs erved Adverse Effect Level (N OAEL) of 4.0 to 31.9 for 
the highest (1000 mg BID)  and lowest (125 mg BID) ATR-101 dose s planned, respectively.  
 CAH patients will enter the st udy with elevated 17-OHP values i ndicating clinical 
challenges in obtaining optimal G C replacement therapy. CAH patients can have extremely 
high 17-OHP levels, >300 nmol/L  (10,000 ng/dL), relative to ref erence laboratory normal 
ranges (<6 nmol/L; <200 ng/dL)
14. However, complete normaliz ation of 17-OHP is not the 
therapeutic goal, as this typica lly results in overtreatment wi th GC.14   Acceptably treated 
CAH patients generally have m ildly elevated steroid levels.14  Thus, the overall goal of the 
study is to show clinically mean ingful decreases in 17-OHP that  are aligned with clinical 
practice goals and to demonstrate si milar decreases in the andr ogen pathway (i.e. 
androstenedione, testosterone, DHEA, DHEA-S). The study design and dose levels are 
appropriately supported by exist ing clinical and n onclinical da ta.

 3.3 Efficacy Assessment 
 
Efficacy will be assessed by changes in adrenal steroids and st eroid intermediates. 17-OHP 
will serve as the primary outcome measure as this adrenal steroi d intermediate is used 
diagnostically and to aid in the management of exogenous GC rep lacement therapy in 
clinical practice. H owever, absolute targ et values for 17-OHP o r androgens do not currently 
exist in treatment guidelines  put forth by any of the medical societies.  The entry criteria for 
17-OHP is set at > 4 x ULN which i s intended to enroll subjects  that are not optimally 
controlled while on exogenous stero id replacement therapy. It i s anticipated that most 
subjects will enter with 17-OHP  levels markedly higher than 4 x  ULN. The primary efficacy 
outcome measure will be aligned to the clinical goal of achievi ng a mildly elevated 17-OHP 
level which for this study i s defined as < 2 x ULN.  However, o ther key efficacy parameters 
in the androgen pathway (andros tenedione, testosterone, DHEA, D HEA-S) will also serve to 
define efficacy. 
 The majority of CAH subjects will enter the study on both GC an d MC replacement (75% of 
classic CAH subjects have defici encies in both pathways). Howev er, plasma renin activity 
(PRA) and aldosterone will be assessed to determine the potential impact on the MC pathway.   
ACTH levels will be assessed to de termine potential effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-
adrenal (HPA)-axis. Glucocorticoid replacement doses are expect ed to remain unchanged so 
no significant changes in ACTH are anticipated. Confirmation of stable ACTH levels 
associated with decreases in 17-OHP and androgens will help to establish the ATR-101 
pharmacodynamic effects.  Increas ed GC levels, secondary to decreased hepatic metabolism 
(ATR-101 CYP3A effect; see Section 5.4), could potentially lead  to decreased ACTH and 
subsequently decreased 17-OHP l evels. This could potentially co nfound assessment of 
direct ATR-101 effects on adrenal  steroid and steroid intermediate synthesis. Therefore, 
assessment of GC levels will also be done during the study. 
 
3.4 Safety Assessment 
 
Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events, changes in physical examination (including vital signs) , changes in electrocar diograms (ECGs), and changes in laboratory 
parameters. Safety assessment will take place every 2 weeks dur ing study participation. 
 CAH subjects will have entered the study on stable GC and MC re gimens. Monitoring and 
management of replacement steroids should continue per usual cl inical practice.

 5. STUDY TREATMENT 
5.1 Assignment of Subject Identification Numbers 
Once the subject has signed the I CF at Screening, site personne l will assign a subject 
identification number (ID). The s ubject ID will include the sit e number (3 digits), and 
3 digit subject number, assigned sequentially starting with 001 . This number and the 
subject’s initials will be util ized to identify the subject throughout the study period.  Subject 
identification numbers will only be assigned to one subject, i. e., if a subject discontinues 
study treatment early, their subject identification number will  not be used for a new subject.

5.3 Treatments Administered 
The Baseline Lead-in Period will administer placebo tablets for  14 days. The tablets will 
match the ATR-101 125 mg tablets  and be administered BID.  
Starting with Dose Level 1, each dos e level will consist of a 2 8 day dosing regimen 
consisting of 14 days of ATR-101 tr eatment followed immediately  by 14 days of matching 
placebo washout. Bottles containi ng 38 tablets wi ll be supplied  for each 14 day dosing 
period which allows for 5 extra days of dosing to accommodate v isit windows (see 
Pharmacy Manual). Table 3 presents the tablets and dosing regimen by Dose Levels.

Only the doses presented in Table 3 will be permitted. No other doses will be allowed.     
5.3.1 Timing and Administrative Dosing Conditions 
IMP should be taken approximate ly 12 hours apart (twice per day  dosing). The time of day 
that the dose is taken should be as consistent as possible (e.g. every morning at 8AM and every evening at 8PM).   IMP should be taken immediately after consumption of food. No specific food contents are required and subjects should maint ain usual eatin g practices. I f a full meal is not possible or 
not aligned with a subject’s us ual eating practices, a light sn ack should be consumed prior to 
taking IMP.   The first dose of each bottle will be administered at the site prior to PK sampling.  Subjects 
will be provided with food to consum e prior to dose administrat ion. See Pharmacy Manual 
for more details.  Grapefruit, grapefruit juice and other foods containing grapefr uit should be avoided to 
prohibit possible interactions in the metabolism of ATR-101 or other concomitant medications.  
5.3.2 Advancement to the Next Dose Level 
If a subject does not meet the p rimary outcome measure (i.e. 17 -OHP <2 x ULN) at the 
completion of a given dose level, advancement to the next highe r dose level should take 
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 29 of 66 
 place if there are no safety issues. There is the possibility o f receiving a maximum of 5 dose 
levels (Levels 1-5).  
 A subject must follow the dose levels in numerical sequence (i. e. Dose Level 1 followed by 
Dose Level 2 etc.). Skipping a  dose level is prohibited and may result in termination from 
the study.   
5.3.3 Changes in Daily Dose are Not Permitted 
Subjects must adhere to the daily dose of IMP according to each  dose level. Deviation from 
the protocol regimen is not permitted. Specifically, lower dail y doses are not permitted for 
any reason. If a subject cannot tol erate a given dose due to a safety issue then early 
termination from the study is th e recommended course of action.  Decreasing to a lower dose 
(e.g., once per day dosing or taking fewer tablets at each AM o r PM dose) or to the previous 
dose level is not permitted. Additi onally, increased doses are not permitted at any time other 
than those associated with the p rotocol design (i.e. advancing to the next dose level). Taking 
more tablets at a given dose is not permitted under any circums tances.  
 
5.3.4 Missed Doses
 
If a subject forgets to take a dose on a given day (e.g. the AM dose was not taken), a “make up” dose should not be taken. In general, if more than 4 hours have passed beyond the usual 
time of day when the dose is tak en, that particular dose should  not be taken.   
5.3.5 Withholding IMP  
A “drug holiday” or “dosing break” is not recommended due to th e relatively short 28 day 
period per dose level. However , withholding IMP may be possible  under specific 
conditions. For example, a subject may have a medical event (e.g., dental emergency) that is considered to be transient or rev ersible within a few days that may potentially have a 
preferred outcome by withholding IMP. Depending on the specific  circumstances, additional 
days of dosing may be possible to complete a 14 day dosing cycl e. The PI or SI should 
discuss potential events of th is nature with the study medical monitor and Sponsor prior to 
the event if at all possible.   
5.3.6 Compliance with IMP
 
The IMP is to be dispensed by qualified personnel at the study center and only to subjects enrolled in the study.  Subject com pliance to therapy will be assessed at scheduled study 
visits by counting the number of tab lets returned. Treatment compliance is defined as the 
subject taking 80% to 120% of the study tablets to be taken during the dosing period for a given dose level.  Subjects found to be outside of the definiti on of compliance may be 
discontinued from the study at th e discretion of the PI or SI.

 5.3.7 Blinding  
Subjects will be blinded to tr eatment beginning with the Baseli ne Lead-in Period that will 
use placebo tablets that app ear identical to ATR-101 125 mg. Dose levels 1 to 5 are split 
into two weeks of active treatm ent (ATR-101) followed by two weeks of treatment with 
matching placebo (Washout Period).  
 
5.3.8 Concomitant Therapies  
Use of concomitant treatments should be kept to a minimum durin g the study.  Any 
therapies given other than IMP  (including blood transfusions, p arental fluids, and other 
medications) are to be considered  a concomitant medication and must be documented on the 
electronic case report form (eCRF).    GC and MC are critical concomitant medications used in CAH and will be captured on a 
separate eCRF from other concomitant therapies.  
5.3.9 Glucocorticoid and Mineralocorticoid Replacement for CAH 
Subjects must continue to receive GC and MC according to indivi dual regimens established 
prior to entering the study. The regimen should remain as stabl e and unchanged as possible 
to minimize potential conf ounding effects on efficacy outcome m easures. However, changes 
are permitted to ensure subject safety. It is not expected that  ATR-101 will have a direct 
effect on GC replacement therapy as the GC synthetic pathway is  already compromised in 
CAH. Therefore, decreasing cortis ol precursors (i.e. 17-OHP) sh ould have no effect on 
glucocorticoid requirements ove r the 14 day ATR-101 treatment p eriod.  
 The timing of glucocorticoid rep lacement therapy may have an im pact on the measurement 
of 17-OHP. Replacement steroids ( GC and MC) must not be taken on the mornings when 
adrenal steroids/steroid inter mediates are being assessed (i.e.  Day 15) as this could confound 
efficacy endpoint measures. GC and M C replacement doses may be given after blood 
samples are obtained for laboratory assessments.   Approximately 75% of CAH subjects  have deficiency in the minera locorticoid pathway in 
addition to the GC pathway.
5  Thus, the majority of subjects i n this study are anticipated to 
be on MC replacement. ATR-101 inhibition of the MC pathway for these subjects should 
not have an effect on MC replacement therapy. Subjects that ent er the study with 
sufficiently intact endogenous MC production may be impacted by  suppression of this 
pathway by ATR-101. However, pharmacological doses of GC, espec ially shorter acting 
ones such as hydrocortisone, als o confer MC activity and the ne ed for replacement MC is 
not usually required.14  
 
5.3.10 Prohibited Medications 
ATR-101 is metabolized by several c ytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs ) including CYP3A4.  
Concurrent use of drugs known to be metabolized by this pathway  should be avoided. 
(Appendix 4).   
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 31 of 66 
  
ATR-101 is most soluble in acidic conditions.  Proton pump inhi bitors are prohibited and 
calcium preparations and antacids should not be used 2 hours before to 2 hours after 
ATR-101 administration. 
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice are known to inhibit CYP3A4.  G rapefruit products should 
be avoided. Concurrent use of medications  that are known t o prolong the QT/ QTc interval at therapeutic 
exposures are not permitted while  on this protocol (Appendix 3,  List A).  Drugs that only 
cause prolonged QT intervals i n unusual circumstances (e.g., overdosage) may be used with 
caution (Appendix 3, Lists B and C). Preclinical data indicate that ATR-101 may compete with certain  drugs for P-glycoprotein 
in the intestinal lumen.  The  drugs listed in Appendix 5 should  be used with caution, as they 
may have an impact on the level of ATR-101 or vice versa.  Note that some of these drugs 
may also appear in Appendices 3 o r 4, and may be contraindicate d by those properties. 
 
5.4 Restrictions, Precautions and Warnings 
Preclinical studies have identified adrenal suppression with ap optotic histologic changes. 
Such changes were associated w ith exposure levels much higher than what is anticipated for 
this study. However, occurrence of  such changes is a possibilit y. The investigative staff 
should be familiar with the war nings and precautions for ATR-10 1 as presented in the 
Investigator’s Brochure.10  
 ATR-101 is metabolized by CYP enz ymes and is an inhibitor and i nducer of CYP enzymes, 
and as a consequence, ATR-101 ma y interfere with the metabolism  of other medicines also 
metabolized by CYP, especially CYP 3A4.  The metabolism of ATR-1 01 may be affected by 
other medicines or foods such as  grapefruit products that inhib it CYP3A4.  Such medicines 
and grapefruit products must be avoided.  ATR-101 is an inhibit or of P-gp and OATP1B1. 
Glucocorticoids are CYP substrat es so there is the potential fo r increased GC levels. 
Glucocorticoid levels will be m easured during the course of the  study. 
 
5.5 Packaging and Labeling  
The formulation and bulk packaging of ATR-101 will be conducted  according to standard 
procedures.  The IMP will be pa ckaged and labeled by the Sponso r’s designated contract 
packager and labelled according to regulatory requirements.  IMP will be provided to sites as kits containing a total of  15 bottles. Each kit will provide both ATR-101 and matching 
placebo for the Baseline Lead-in P eriod as well as Dose Levels 1-5.

 5.6 Storage and Accountability 
Study drug must be kept in a secure d location and stored at con trolled room  temperature  at 
the study site within its origina l container.  A daily temperat ure log for monitoring of proper 
storage conditions must be  maintained by the site.   
 
Access to drug must be restricte d to designated study personnel only.  Under no 
circumstances should the PI/SI  or site personnel supply study p roduct to other Investigators 
or clinics, or allow the supplie s to be used other than as dire cted by this protocol without 
written authorization from the Sponsor.  The PI (or delegate) m ust maintain records of the 
delivery of the study drug to the s tudy site, the inventory at the site, use for each subject, 
and return of the study drug to a  delegate of the Sponsor or de struction.  Total study site 
accountability will be conducted at the end of the study and th e PI/SI (or delegate) must 
explain all discrepancies.  A  Site Drug Accountability Log will be supplied by the Sponsor.  
This log must be kept current a nd should contain the following information: 
 
 Identification (subject ID number  and initials) of subject to w hom the study drug was 
dispensed 
 The dates and kit numbers for dispensed study drug 
 Initial inventory on recei pt of drug at the site 
 Final inventory on completion of the study 
All records and inventory must  be available for inspection by t he clinical study monitor.  
Additional details on the stora ge and handling of ATR-101 will be provided in the 
Pharmacy Manual.  
5.7 Investigational Product R etention at Study Site 
At the time of study close-out, the Sponsor will direct the sit e regarding the di sposition of 
any unused IMP whether it is to be destroyed or be returned to the Sponsor’s designated 
location.  The Sponsor will assure that a final report of drug accountability is prepared and 
maintained by the investigative site.  Additional details on the inventory of IMP will be 
provided in the Pharmacy Manual.

as much as possible. However, the re is flexibili ty to allow for  logistical considerations and 
to accommodate scheduling conflic ts.  Variations to the protoco l defined visit dates (i.e. 
study days) may be allowed depending upon the specific circumst ances. 
 Screening Visit.  Up to 21 days.   
 Baseline Lead-in Period. A minimum of 14 days must be completed  but an additional 3 
days beyond the 14 day period is allowed. 
 Dose Levels 1-5 
o ATR-101 Treatment Period 
 A minimum of 11 days (22 doses) of ATR-101 must be taken prior to 
drawing blood samples for an assessment of efficacy and safety.   Therefore, 
sample collection cannot o ccur earlier than the 12th day of dosing for a given 
dose level.  
 A maximum of + 3 days is allowe d beyond the scheduled 14 day AT R-101 
treatment period.  
o Placebo Washout Period   A minimum of 11 days (22 doses) of placebo must be taken prior to drawing 
blood samples for an assessment of efficacy and safety.  Theref ore, sample 
collection cannot occur earlier than the 12
th day of dosing for a given dose 
level.  
 A maximum of + 3 days is allo wed beyond the scheduled 14 day pl acebo 
treatment period.  
 Follow-up visit. A window of + 3 days is permitted. 
 
6.2 Informed Consent 
Prior to any study specific screening evaluations and clinical trial participation, written 
informed consent will be obtai ned from each subject to be invol ved in the clinical trial by 
using the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committ ee (IRB/IEC) approved 
ICF.  Potential subjects will be informed in detail about the s tudy product to be 
administered, and the nature of t he clinical investigation with  its risks and discomforts to be 
expected.  The subjects will also be instructed that they are f ree to withdraw their consent 
and discontinue participation in the clinical trial at any time .  The PI/SI will verify that the 
subject has granted consent.  E ach subject will be given a copy  of the signed ICF.  Certified 
translated ICFs will be provi ded by the Sponsor in those languages required or requested by 
investigational sites.

 6.3 Eligibility 
Review of study inclusion/exclu sion criteria w ill be done at th e Screening visit,  at the start 
of the Baseline Lead-in Period and reconfirmed prior to receivi ng the first dose of IMP 
(Dose Level 1). Noncompliance with IMP (i.e., not meeting 80-12 0%) during the Baseline 
Lead-in Period will result in Ear ly Termination from the Study.  
6.4 Medical History  
A complete medical history will be obtained at the Screening vi sit.  The following systems 
will be reviewed:  head, eyes, ears, nose, and throat (HEENT), respiratory, cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal/hep atobiliary (specifica lly, a history of live r dysfunction or the presence of 
hepatomegaly or splenomegaly), genitourinary/ reproductive, mus culoskeletal, neurological, 
psychiatric, endocrine/metabol ic, blood/lymphatic, dermatologic , and immunologic.  Past 
surgeries will also be recorded.   
6.5 Physical Examination 
A complete physical examinati on will be obtained at Screening a nd the Final Study visit or 
Early Termination Visit.   
An abbreviated (brief) physical e xam will be completed as follo ws: 
 Prior to the start of the Baseline Lead-in Period 
 Prior to dosing on the first day of e very Dose Level  (active t reatment) 
 Prior to starting the placebo Washout Period at each Dose Level  
 
The following systems will be examined for a complete physical examination: HEENT, 
respiratory, cardiovascular, gast rointestinal/h epatobiliary (sp ecifically the presence of 
hepatomegaly or splenomegaly will be assessed), genitourinary/ reproductive, 
musculoskeletal, neurological, p sychiatric, endocrine/metabolic , blood/lymphatic, 
dermatologic, and immunologic.  O n a brief physical examination , the following systems 
will be examined: respiratory, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal /hepatobiliary and any areas 
pertinent to any a dverse events.   
6.6 Vital Signs 
Vital signs, including oral or tym panic temperature, systolic a nd diastolic blood pressure, 
pulse, respiratory rate, and body weight will be measured at Sc reening, at the start of the 
Baseline Lead-in Period, a t Day 1 pre-dose and at 1, 2 and 4 hours post-dose for each dose 
level, at Day 15 pre-dose for each dose level and at the Final Study Visit or Early 
Termination Visit.  Height will be measured at Screening.  
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201

 6.7 Electrocardiography and  Determination of QTc 
All subjects will have 12-lead E CG assessments at Screening, Da y 1 pre-dose and 2 hours 
post-dose for each dose level, Day 15 pre-dose for each dose le vel, and at the completion of 
the Placebo Washout Period on Day  29 (this ECG could serve as the pre-dose ECG, Day 1, 
if the subject is moving to the next  dose level or as the ECG f or the Final Study Visit or 
Early Termination Visit). ECGs w ill be stored for later analysis if needed. 
If the QTc is greater than 470 msec on the Screening ECG, three consecutive ECGs will be 
obtained and the QTc values co rrected by the Fridericia method will be averaged.  If the 
average is greater than 470 msec , the subject will be ineligibl e for the study.  In the event of 
an abnormal ECG (especially in t he setting of an intraventricul ar conduction delay) that 
makes QTc determination unreliable by standard means, the QT in terval will be corrected 
by the method of Rautaharju et al.15 
6.8 Prior and/or Concomitant Medication Assessments 
Prior and concomitant therapi es will be documented throughout t he study and include any 
treatments that have been tak en within 30 days prior to the fir st placebo dose in the Baseline 
Lead-in Period until the Follow-up Visit.  Any treatments given  during the clinical trial 
other than IMP, including blood tra nsfusions, parental fluids, herbal preparations, and all 
pre-medications are considered concomitant therapy and must be recorded on the eCRF.  
Following completion of the Final Study Visit, only concomitant medications related to 
follow-up of an AE should be recor ded on the eCRF.  All prior and concomitant 
medications will be coded to the l atest version of the World He alth Organization (WHO) 
Drug Dictionary.   
  
6.9 Pharmacokinetic Assessments 
Blood samples will be collected to profile the levels of ATR-10 1 and its metabolites at 
multiple days and times throughout the study.  Assessment of AT R-101 levels may help to 
determine or establish pharmac okinetic and pharmacodynamic relationships. ATR-101 
exposure levels may also help in the assessment of safety event s. Sampling time points are 
presented for each of the applic able study days in Table 4. Sam ples for PK analysis will be 
taken prior to the first dose of ATR-101 (for each dose level) and up to 4 hours, post-dose. 
This time period is designed to capture the C max (Tmax is approximately 2 hours) and a few 
additional time points. Follo wing the completion of the 14 day ATR-101 dosing period a 
single PK sample will be collect ed to assess trough levels of A TR-101 (morning of day 15). 
Subjects will then enter t he 14 day placebo Washout Period.  After completion of the 
placebo Washout period, subjects w ill either proceed to the next Dose Level and perform 
the same PK sampling as Day 1, or subjects will complete the Fi nal Study Visit and do the 
same PK sampling as Day 15. 
PK results will not be used to determine dose escalation. Appro ximately 4 mL  of blood will 
be drawn at each sampling time point.

6.10 Pharmacodynamic Assessments 
The effects of ATR-101 on adrenal  steroid synthesis will be assessed at each study visit by 
measuring steroids and steroid in termediates across the mineralocorticoid, glucocorticoid 
and androgen pathways. Plasma renin activity (PRA) is not an ad renal steroid, but it will be 
measured as an assessment of min eralocorticoid a ctivity. In add ition, ACTH levels will be 
assessed to determine the poten tial impact on the HPA-axis.  
 
Pharmacodynamic measures:  
 Glucocorticoid pathwa y: 17-OHP, progesterone 
 Mineralocorticoid pathway: 11-de oxycorticosterone (11-DOC); PRA ; aldosterone 
 Androgens: androstenedione, total  testosterone, free testostero ne, DHEA, DHEA-S  
 HPA-axis: ACTH 
 
 
6.11 Timing of Pharmacodynamic Blood Samples and Dosing of Replaceme nt 
Steroids 
Adrenal steroids and steroid intermediates have a diurnal rhyth micity with peak 17-OHP 
occurring at around 8:00 AM. Thus, it is extremely critical tha t the timing of sample 
collection for efficacy endpoints and dosing of replacement ste roids be precise and 
consistent. Every attempt should be  made to collect the sample between 8:00-9:00 AM, but 
no later than 10:00AM. Study visits  that require blood sample c ollection for steroid 
hormones, must adhere to the following:  Morning dose of replacement GC and MC must not be given until a fter the blood sample 
is collected 
 Blood sample collection must be done prior to 10:00 AM   
 
If both of these conditions are not met, the blood sample for steroid hormones must not 
be collected; the visit procedu res should not be performed and the study visit must be 
rescheduled for the next day or  as soon as feasible.  The subje ct should continue taking 
study drug with the last dose o ccurring the evening prior to th e rescheduled visit. 
 Dosing of GC and MC may take place after collection of blood sa mples for adrenal steroids 
and steroid intermediates.    
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 37 of 66 
 Approximately 20 mL of blood will be collected for steroid horm one testing and 
approximately 10 mL of blood will be collected for testing synt hetic glucocorticoid levels.  
If exogenous GC levels are suspected of confounding the efficac y outcome measures, 
additional testing may be perfor med.  Further details on sample  collection and handling are 
provided in the Laboratory Manual. 
 
6.12 Adverse Events, Serious Adve rse Events, and Reporting 
6.12.1 Adverse Events, Severity, and Relationship 
 
Adverse Event (AE):  Any untoward medical occurrence in a subje ct or clinical 
investigation subject administered an investigational product.  An AE does not necessarily 
have a causal relationship with IMP.   
 All AEs reported for enrolled s ubjects during the clinical stud y will be recorded on the 
eCRF.  All AEs, regardless of r elationship to s tudy drug or procedure, should be 
collected beginning from the time the subject signs the study consent.  AEs in clinical 
investigation subjects include  any change in the subject’s cond ition.  This includes 
symptoms, physical findi ngs, or clinical syndromes. 
 An abnormal laboratory value ma y be considered an AE if the ide ntified laboratory 
abnormality leads to any type of intervention whether prescribe d in the protocol or not.  
It is up to the PI/SI to determine  whether an abnormal laborato ry value constitutes an 
AE.  If an abnormal laboratory value is caused by a disease pro cess, the disease process 
and not the laboratory abnormality should be listed as the AE ( e.g., if new onset viral 
hepatitis is causing elevated ala nine aminotransferase (ALT), hepatitis and not the 
elevated ALT should be listed as the AE). 
 Examples of laboratory abnormalities that should be considered AEs include those that 
result in withdrawal of the study treatment, withholding study treatment pending some 
investigational outcome, or additional concomitant treatment.  All laboratory 
abnormalities considered to constitute an AE should be recorded  on the appropriate AE 
page of the eCRF.  Laboratory abnormalities do not need to be l isted as separate AEs if 
they are considered to be part of  a clinical syndrome that is b eing reported as an AE.  It 
is the responsibility of the Investigator to review all laborat ory findings in all subjects.  
Abnormal values should be commented upon as to clinical relevan ce or importance on 
the eCRF or the laboratory repor t as appropriate.  Medical and scientific judgment 
should be exercised in deciding whe ther an isolated laboratory abnormality should be 
classified as an AE. 
 AEs will be collected from the time the subject signs informed consent until 30 days 
after last dose of IMP.     
 Every effort must be made by the P I/SI to categorize each AE ac cording to its severity 
and its relationship to IMP. 
 Subjects who develop toxicity on study will be followed until t he event resolves, 
stabilizes or returns to baseline.

 6.12.2 Assessing Severity of Adverse Events 
The assessment of severity must be based on the Investigator’s clinical judgement.  
Maximum severity should be ass igned to one of the following cat egories: 
 
 Mild : An AE which is easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and 
not interfering with everyday activities. 
 Moderate : An AE which is sufficiently discomforting to interfere with n ormal everyday 
activities. 
 Severe : An AE which prevents normal everyday activities. 
 
An AE which is assessed as sev ere should not be confused with a  serious AE.  Refer to 
Section 6.12.5 for the definition of a serious AE. 
 
6.12.3 Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment 
Items to be considered when asse ssing the relationship of an AE  to the study treatment are 
as follows:  
 Temporal relationship of the onset  of the event to the initiation of the study treatment 
 The course of the event, considering especially the effect of d iscontinuation of study 
treatment or reintroduction of study treatment, as applicable 
 Whether the event is known to be associated with the study trea tment or with other 
similar treatments 
 The presence of risk factors i n the study subject known to incr ease the occurrence of the 
event 
 The presence of non-study treatme nt related factors which are k nown to be associated 
with the occurrence of the event 
 
Only AEs thought to be caused by IMP  should be recorded as “rel ated to IMP”.    
6.12.4 Classification of Causality 
The relationship of an adverse ev ent to the administration of t he study drug is to be assessed 
according to the following definitions: 
 No (unrelated, not rel ated, no relation) – The  time course betw een the administration of 
study drug and the occurrence or worsening of the adverse event  rules out a causal 
relationship and another cause ( concomitant drugs, therapies, c omplications, etc.) is 
suspected. 
 Yes (related) – The time course between the administration of s tudy drug and the 
occurrence or worsening of the a dverse event is consistent with  a causal relationship and 
no other cause (concomitant drugs , therapies, complications, etc.) can be identified. The 
definition implies a reasonable  possibility of a causal relatio nship between the event and 
the study drug. This means that t
here are facts (evidence) or a rguments to suggest a 
causal relationship. 
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 39 of 66 
 Not Related :  A causal relationship betwee n the study treatment and the AE  is not a 
reasonable possibility. 
Related :  A causal relationship between t he study treatment and the AE  is a reasonable 
possibility.  The Investigator m ust further qualify the degree of certainty as “ possible, ” 
“probable ”, or “ definite .” 
6.12.5 Serious Adverse Events 
6.12.5..1 Definition of Serious Adverse Events 
A serious adverse event (experi ence; SAE) or reaction is any un toward medical occurrence 
which: 
 Results in death 
 Is life-threatening (Note:  The term “life-threatening” in the definition of “serious” refers 
to an event in which the subjec t was at risk of death at the ti me of the event; it does not 
refer to an event which hypothe tically might have caused death if it were more severe.) 
 Requires inpatient hospitalizati on or prolongation of existing hospitalization 
 
NOTE: Any hospital admission with at least one overnight stay w ill be considered an 
inpatient hospitaliza tion. An emergency room visit without hosp ital admission will not 
be recorded as a serious adverse event (SAE) under this criteri on, nor will 
hospitalization for a procedure scheduled or planned before sig ning of informed consent. 
However, unexpected complicatio ns and/or prolongation of hospitalization that occur 
during elective surgery should be  recorded as AEs and assessed for seriousness. 
 
 Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity 
 Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
 Is determined to be an important m edical event (at the discretion of the Investigator) 
 Medical and scientific judgmen t should be exercised in deciding  whether expedited 
reporting is appropriate in other situations, such as important  medical events that may not be 
immediately life-threatening or  result in death or hospitalizat ion but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require intervention to prevent on e of the other  outcomes listed in the 
definition above.  These should als o usually be considered seri ous. 
The following hospitalizations are  not considered to be SAEs because there is no “AE” 
(i.e., no untoward medical occurrenc e) associated with the hosp italization: 
 Planned hospitalizations r equired by the protocol 
 Hospitalization planned prior to i nformed consent (where the co ndition requiring the 
hospitalization has not change
d post study drug administration)  
 6.12.5..2 Reporting Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Initial Reports 
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 40 of 66 
 All SAEs occurring from the time of informed consent through the early termination/final 
visit and for 30 days followi ng study drug discontinuation, whichever is longer, must be 
reported to Medpace Clinical Safety within 24 hours of the knowledge of the occurrence 
(this refers to any adverse event that meets any of the aforeme ntioned serious criteria). All 
serious adverse events that the investigator considers related to study drug occurring after 
the 30-day follow-up period must  be reported to the Sponsor. 
To report the SAE, com plete the SAE form electronically in the electronic data capture 
(EDC) system for the study. Whe n the form is completed, Medpace Safety personnel will be 
notified electronically and will retrieve the form. If the even t meets serious criteria and it is 
not possible to access the EDC system, send an email to Medpace  Safety at medpace-
safetynotification@medpace.com  or call the Medpace SAE hotline (phone number listed 
below), and fax the completed paper SAE form to Medpace (fax number listed below) within 24 hours of awareness. When the EDC system becomes avail able, the SAE 
information must be entered with in 24 hours of the system becom ing available.  
Safety Contact Information: 
Medpace Clinical Safety Medpace SAE hotline – USA: Telephone: +1-800-730-5779, ext. 2999 or +1-513-579-9911, ext. 2999 
Facsimile: +1-866-336-5320 or +1-513-579-0444 
e-mail: medpace-safetynotification@medpace.com 
 Follow-Up Reports 
The investigator must continue to follow the subject until the SAE has subsided or until the 
condition becomes chronic in nature , stabilizes ( in the case of  persistent impairment) or the 
subject dies. 
Within 24 hours of receipt of fo llow-up information, the invest igator must update the SAE 
form electronically in the ED C system for the study and submit any supporting 
documentation (e.g., subject discharge summary or autopsy reports) to Medpace Clinical 
Safety via fax or e-mail. If it is not possible to access the E DC system, refer to the 
procedures outlined above for initial reporting of SAEs.  
The Investigator shou ld notify the IRB/ IEC of the occurrence of the SAE, in writing, in 
accordance with local requireme nts.  A copy of this communicati on must be forwarded to 
the clinical research associate (CRA) and f iled in the trial ma ster file (TMF).  
6.12.5..3 Pregnancy Reporting  
Any pregnancy where the estim ated date of conception occurred e ither prior to the study 
termination visit or within 30 da ys of last study treatment mus t be reported. The pregnancy must 
be reported to Medpace Clinical  Safety within 24 hours (from th e time the pregnancy is 
detected). Medpace Clinical Safety will then forward the Exposu re In Utero form to the PI or SI 
for completion.  
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 41 of 66 
 If an adverse outcome of a pregna ncy is suspected to be related  to study drug exposure, this 
should be reported, regardless of  the length of time that has p assed since the exposure to study 
treatment. 
A subject becoming pregnant while on study drug will immediatel y be withdrawn from the 
study and early termination study pr ocedures will be performed. 
The subject should be followed by the PI or SI until completion  of the pregnancy. If the 
pregnancy ends for any reason before  the anticipated date, the PI or SI should notify Medpace 
Clinical Safety.  At the comple tion of the pregnancy, the PI or  SI will document the outcome of 
the pregnancy. If the outcome of the pregnancy meets the criter ia for immediate classification as 
an SAE (i.e., postpartum complication, spontaneous abortion, st illbirth, neonatal death, or 
congenital anomaly), the PU or S I should follow the procedures for reporting an SAE. 
6.12.6 Regulatory Reporting of Adverse Events 
AEs will be reported to the re gulatory authorities in complianc e with local and regional law and 
established guidance by the S ponsor or by a third party acting on behalf of the Sponsor.  The 
format of these reports will be  dictated by the local and regio nal requirements. 
6.13 Clinical Laboratory Tests 
Blood samples for steroids and steroid intermediate testing, sy nthetic glucocorticoid levels, 
hematology, serum chemistry, co agulation and urinalysis will be obtained at Screening, at the 
start of the Baseline Lead-in P eriod, at the st art of every dose level (Day 1), at th e start of every 
placebo Washout Period (Day 15) and at the Final Study Visit or  the Early Termination Visit 
(Day 29). 
Study visits that require blood sam ple collection for steroid hormones, must adhere to the 
following: 
 Morning dose of replacement GC and MC must not be given until a fter the blood sample is 
collected 
 Blood sample collection must be done prior to 10:00AM   
 
If both of these conditions are not met, the blood sample for efficacy endpoints must not 
be collected and another study vi sit must be scheduled for the next day or as soon as 
feasible. 
Approximately 7 mL of blood will be collected for serum chemist ry, 3 mL of blood for 
hematology and 3 mL of blood for P T/aPTT/INR.  Approximately 20 mL of blood will be 
collected for steroid hormone testing and approximately 10 mL of blood will be collected for 
synthetic glucocorticoid testi ng. (See Table 5). Testing will b e carried out by a central 
laboratory per the l aboratory manual. 
Subjects do not need to fast before the blood tests and will be  in a seated or supine position 
during blood collection. Sampling time will be recorded on the eCRF. 
For female subjects who are not surgically sterile or who have not been naturally post-
menopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., who has ha d menses any time in the 
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 42 of 66 
 preceding 12 consecutive months), serum pregnancy tests (ß-hCG) will be performed at 
Screening.  A urine pregnancy test (UPT) will be obtained prior  to the first dose at each dose 
level on Day 1.  A UPT will also be obtained at the Final Study  Visit or Early Termination 
Visit. Sampling time will be recorded on the eCRF.  
Blood samples for serology (HBsAg, Hepatitis C antibody and HIV ) will be obtained at 
Screening.  Approximately 4 mL of blood will be collected for s erology. 
Abnormal, clinically significant results may be verified to rule out laboratory error.  Persistent 
relevant abnormal values must be followed up until the cause is determined or until they return to the previous values.  Abnormal laboratory findings that are considered clinically significant 
by the PI/SI should be recorde d as AEs (see Section 6.12.1).

 6.15 Removal of Subjects from the Study or Study Drug 
In accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and subsequent c onferences, subjects have the 
right to withdraw from the study at any time for any reason.  The PI/SI and the Sponsor also 
have the right to withdraw subj ects from the study.  Subjects m ay be removed from the study 
for the following reasons: 
1. In the PI or SI’s judgment, adm inistration of study drug would be detrimental to the 
subject’s health. 
2. The subject withdraws consent for continued participation or re fuses further treatment with 
the investigational product. 
3. The subject is noncomplia nt with the protocol. 
4. The subject becomes pregnant. 
5. The subject dies.  
6. The subjects experiences an SAE or  medically important event th at would preclude further 
treatment with study drug 
7. Need to initiate therapy w ith an excluded medication 
 
Subjects should return to the inve stigational site for a Final Study Visit or Early Termination 
Visit after withdrawal/removal fr om the clinical trial.  The re ason for and date of 
withdrawal/removal from the c linical trial will be documented i n the subject’s medical records.  
Investigational site  personnel must attempt to determine whethe r the reason for  withdrawal was 
an AE, and if so, this must be reported in accordance with the procedures provided in Section 
6.12.  For all subjects who do not compl ete the clinical trial,  regardless of the duration of 
treatment, all relevant informa tion related to th e withdrawal/r emoval will be entered into the 
eCRF. Subjects who withdraw or are removed from the clinical trial ma y be replaced at the discretion 
of the Sponsor.   All enrolled subjects will be fully accounted  for and documented in the final 
clinical study report (CSR).

 8 QUALITY CONTROL AND ASSURANCE 
Before any subjects can be enrolled at an investigational site and prior to the conduct of any 
protocol-specific procedures, f ormal training of investigationa l site personnel will be conducted.  
The PI/SI and all relevant inves tigational site staff are to be trained on all aspects of the trial for 
which they are responsible.  Site personnel may be trained at a formal initiation visit, at an 
Investigator’s Meeting, or by another means as necessary.  Moni toring and auditing procedures 
will be conducted in compliance wi th the International Conferen ce on Harmonisation (ICH) 
Guidelines for Good Clinical Pract ice (GCP).  Ons ite verificati on of the eCRFs for 
completeness and clarity, crossc hecking with source documents, and clarification of 
administrative matters will be performed on a regular basis.  T he investigational site will be 
monitored immediately following enr ollment of the first subject  at the site (i.e., within 
approximately 2 weeks) to verify t hat inclusion/exclusion crite ria have been fulfilled.  
Subsequent monitoring visits will  occur at regular intervals as  noted in the monitoring plan.  
Through frequent communications w ith the investigational site, the CRA will ensure that the 
investigation is conducted according to protocol design and all  applicable regulatory 
requirements.  Additional details on the monitoring of this cli nical trial are pr ovided in Section 
10.5.  During the course of the clin ical trial, investigational sites, the clinical  trial database, and 
all associated clinical trial  documentation may be subject to q uality assurance audits by the 
Sponsor, or their appointed rep resentatives, on a planned or as -needed basis.  In addition, 
representatives of associate d regulatory bodies may conduct inspections at their discretion.  The 
Investigator is responsible for ensuring direct access to all p rotocol-specific materials for the

 9 PLANNED STATISTICAL METHODS 
9.1 General Considerations 
 
Sample size considerations are  based on a Simon 2-stage Minimax  design with 1-sided alpha of 
5% and 80% power.   Stage 1 consists of 9 completed subjects. The study will stop a t Stage 1 if either of the following 
conditions are met: 
 Futility criteria: defined as   <2 of 9 (22%) subjects meeting t he primary outcome 
measure (17-OHP <2 x ULN)  
 Success criteria: defined as  >7 of 9 (78%) subjects meeting th e primary outcome 
measure (17-OHP <2 x ULN)  
 
Stage 2 will commence if 3, 4, 5 or 6 of the 9 subjects meet th e primary outcome measure. In 
this scenario, accrual will continue with up to 8 additional su bjects for a total of no more than 
17 subjects. Accrual may stop earli er with sufficient evidence for further development if a total 
of 7 or more subjects respond (minimum observed response rate o f 7/17, 41%). 
 The study medical monitor along with the Sponsor may determine if a subject will be replaced in order to have a minimum of 9 evaluable subjects for Stage 1.  Possible reasons for 
replacement may be due to extreme noncompliance with IMP not re lated to an adverse event, 
noncompliance with the protocol s uch as the use of prohibited m edications that could confound 
results.  
9.2 Analysis Populations 
 An intent to treat population is  not deemed necessary for this study given the relatively small 
number of subjects.    The per protocol population will include all subjects that have  taken at least 11 days of ATR-
101 treatment at Dose Level 1 (th e lowest dose level) and have at least one post-baseline 
efficacy assessment (i.e.17-OHP) without having a significant p rotocol deviation.  
 The safety population will include  all subjects that received a t least one dose of IMP. 
 
9.3 Patient Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
 Demographic and clinical charact eristics of subjects enrolled o nto this study will be 
summarized.  For categorical variables, frequencies and percent ages will be provided.  Means 
with standard deviations or medians/percentiles will summarize non-categorical variables. 
 
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 52 of 66 
 9.4 Treatment 
 
A frequency distribution will be generated for the dose levels administered. Any deviations to the dose escalation criteri a will also be noted.   
 
9.5 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
 The primary efficacy endpoint will be the percentage of responders. A responder is defined as 
a subject that meets the primar y outcome measure of 17-OHP <2 x ULN at any dose level.  
Subjects will enter the st udy with 17-OHP > 4 x ULN. The 17-OHP  level associated with the 
primary outcome measure is aligned to clinical management pract ices for classic CAH. 
 
9.6 Secondary Endpoints 
 Descriptive statistics and graphical summaries within each coho rt, and for each dose as 
appropriate, will be utilized to present the pharmacokinetic an d pharmacodynamics parameters 
assessed.  
9.7 Safety 
 
Safety parameters, including adverse events, treatment disconti nuations, laboratory changes and 
abnormalities, and changes in ECG parameters will be tabulated and each dose, as appropriate.  
 
9.8 Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) assessments will be performed at each dose level to determine ATR-101 exposures and to profile PK/PD relationships. PK assessments wi ll include C
max, Area Under 
the Curve (AUC 0-4 hr), and trough levels. 
Individual subject PK data wil l be analyzed along with pooling of subjects’ data at each dose 
level.  
PK/PD analyses will be detailed in the Statistical Analysis Plan.   
9.9 Interim Analysis 
 
No interim analysis is planned f or this study as neither the ef ficacy nor the safety results will be 
blinded to the PI/SI, study medical monitor or the Sponsor.

 10 ADMINISTRATIVE CONSIDERATIONS 
10.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB)/ Independent Ethi cs Committee (IEC)  
Prior to initiation of the st udy at each investigational site, the protocol, the informed consent 
form(s), the subject information sheet(s), details of the subje ct recruitment procedures, and any 
other relevant study documentation will be submitted to the res ponsible local and/or national 
IRB/IEC.  A letter from the IRB/ IEC indicating approval of the Investigator and study site must 
be submitted to the study Sponsor.  All reviews and approval by  the IRB/IEC will be in 
accordance with Title 21 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CF R), Part 56. 
The PI/SI will promptly report any new information that may adv ersely affect the safety of 
subjects or the conduct of the s tudy to the IRB/IEC.  Similarly , the PI/SI will submit written 
summaries of the study status to the IRB/IEC annually, or more frequently if requested.  Upon 
completion of the study, the Inves tigator will provide the IRB/ IEC with a brief report of the 
outcome of the study, if required. 
10.2 Ethical Conduct of the Study 
The guidelines of the World Medic al Association Declaration of Helsinki in its revised edition 
(48th General Assembly, Somerse t West, Republic of South Africa , October 1996), the 
guidelines of ICH GCP (CPMP/ICH/135/95), as well as the demands  of national drug and data 
protection laws and other applicab le regulatory requirements, w ill be strictly followed.  
10.3 Subject Information and Consent 
The PI/SI is responsible for e nsuring that subjects do not unde rgo any study-related examination 
or activity before giving inform ed consent.  The subject must g ive written consent after the 
receipt of detailed informati on regarding the study.  The verba l explanation will cover all the 
elements specified in the writ ten information provided to the subject.  If the written informed 
consent is provided by the legal guardian because the subject i s unable to do so, a written or 
verbal assent from the subject must also be obtained. 
The PI/SI will inform the subject of the aims, methods, anticip ated benefits, and potential 
hazards of the study, including any discomfort it may entail.  The subject must be given every 
opportunity to clarify any points he/she does not understand an d must be provided with more 
information if requested.  At th e end of the interview, the sub ject may be given time to reflect 
and can request more time if need ed.  The subject and/or legal guardian will be required to sign 
and date the informed consent for m.  After completion, informed  consent forms will be kept and 
archived by the PI in the PI  study file. 
It should be emphasized to the subject that he or she is at lib erty to either discontinue IMP 
and/or withdraw consent to par ticipate at any time, without pen alty or loss of benefits to which 
he or she is otherw ise entitled.  Subjects who refuse to give o r withdraw written informed 
consent may not be included or continued in this study, but thi s will not affect their subsequent 
care.

 Please refer to Title 21 of the CFR, Part 50 – Protection of Hu man Subjects for specific details 
on this regulation. 
10.4 Subject Confidentiality 
Personal and sensitive data will  be treated as confidential.  T he results of the clinical trial will 
be made available for review by authorized representatives of t he Sponsor and/or submitted to 
the IRB/IEC, and regulatory authorities.   
Prior to the subject’s enrollmen t in the clinical trial, the su bject’s consent is required for the data 
to be used for these purposes a nd to gain direct access to thei r medical records for data 
verification purposes.  The subjec t must be assured that their identity will be protected.  To 
facilitate this, a unique iden tification number will be assigne d and it will be used when reporting 
study-related data.  
Additionally, in the US, the Hea lth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
(“HIPAA”) requires that all su bjects grant permission to use their personal health information.  
Therefore, in addition to the protocol-specific ICF, each subje ct located in the United States 
(US) will be asked to provide aut horization to use his/her pers onal health information by 
signing a separate HIPAA Authorization Form.   
10.5 Study Monitoring 
It is understood that the Spons or or its designee (e.g., the CR A) will contact and visit the PI/SI 
regularly for monitoring purposes.  The CRA will be allowed, on  request, to inspect the various 
records of the clinical trial (i.e., eCRFs, source documents, a nd any other pertinent data), 
provided that subject confidentiality is maintained in accordan ce with local requirements.  It 
will be the CRA’s responsibility t o inspect the eCRFs at regula r intervals throughout the clinical 
trial, to verify adherence to the  protocol and to ensure the completeness, consistency, and 
accuracy of the data entered.  The CRA must have access to all subject records needed to verify 
the entries on the eCRF.  The PI/ SI (or a designee) agrees to c ooperate with the CRA to ensure 
that problems detected during t hese monitoring visits are resol ved. 
In addition, the Sponsor may perf orm a Clinical Quality Assurance (CQA) audit randomly at a 
sample of clinical sites, or for cause as warranted.  The CQA a udit will examine the accuracy of 
source documentation, record retention, data management, and co mpliance.  These audits will 
be independent of routine mon itoring by the CRA with prior writ ten notification provided to the 
site. 
10.6 Case Report Forms a nd Study Records 
This clinical trial will utilize an electronic data capture sys tem for the management of clinical 
data.  The data will be collecte d in electronic form (i.e., via  an eCRF) to allow for data entry at 
the site from source documentati on directly into the electronic  database.  Access to the 
electronic system will be res tricted, and users will only be ab le to access the system via 
authorized individual accounts.  A ll changes to data in the dat abase will be tracked and time 
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 55 of 66 
 stamped automatically, includi ng updates to data entries and re solution of data queries 
generated by the CRA o r data reviewer.  
Training will be provided to all system users based on their in dividual access and use 
requirements initially an d ongoing throughout the course of the  clinical trial as needed.  
Documentation of training will be k ept in the site regulatory f ile and in Sponsor’s TMF. 
A comprehensive Data Management Plan will be written outlining the standard operating 
procedures, internal/external security safeguards, system and change controls, and training 
procedures and will be filed in the Sponsor’s TMF.  A cumulativ e record will also be kept of the 
user and access privileges for all authorized users across the clinical trial.  
The system and procedures for el ectronic database set-up, entry , review, access, security, and 
auditing are designed in specific compliance with 21 CFR 11 and  the Food and Drug 
Administration's (FDA’s) Part  11 Guidance for Industry supplement “Computerized Systems 
Used in Clinical Investiga tions” dated May 2007.  Any additiona l electronic systems that may 
be used by vendors (e.g., PK) or c linical sites (e .g., electron ic medical records used as source 
documents) should comply with the se same regulatory standards.  
As a final step in the data ma nagement process, a 100% quality control review will be 
performed on the key efficacy and safety parameters.  In addition, a random subject sample 
(approximately 10%) will be selec ted to perform a database audit.  The purpose of this audit is 
to detect systematic and random errors.   
10.7 Data Safety Monitoring Board 
A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is not planned for this s tudy since treatment is 
unblinded to study personnel and t he overall small size of the study generally limits the value of 
pooling data across the study popul ation. All study PI/SI will have the ability to assess 
benefit:risk for each subject i n almost real time.  The study medical monitor and Sponsor will 
have access to safety and efficac y data from across the entire study population. The study 
design limits the duration of ATR -101 treatment duration and as sesses safety every 2 weeks.   
10.8 Protocol Deviations 
Protocol deviations from inclusion/exclusion criteria, concomit ant medication restrictions, and 
from any other protocol require ments that could, at least hypothetically, result in significant risk 
to the subject and/or affect the outcome of the study will be collected.  Additionally, nonadherence to the study proce dures or schedule as defined by the protocol such as a missed 
procedure or an out-of-window st udy visit will be documented as  protocol deviations.    
10.9 Access to Source Documentation 
The PI/SI must permit the author ized Sponsor, agents of the Sponsor, and regulatory agency 
employees to enter and inspect  any site where the drug or records pertaining to the drug are held 
and to inspect and copy all records relating to an investigatio n including subject records.  To 
ensure the accuracy of data subm itted, it is mandatory that rep resentatives of the Sponsor and of 
the regulatory agencies have dir ect access to source documents (e.g., subject medical records, 
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201 
Confidential; 14 January 2016 Page 56 of 66 
 charts, laboratory reports) for the purpose of quality assuranc e audits either by Millendo or their 
appointed representatives.  S ubject confidentiality will be pro tected at all times. 
10.10  Data Generation and Analysis 
Data processing and management will be performed by the Sponsor  or its designee.  Data will 
be promptly entered into the st udy database and reviewed and is sues resolved prior to database 
closure. 
Personal and sensitive personal data will be treated as confide ntial.  The results of the study will 
be made available for review by authorized representatives of t he Sponsor and/or submitted to 
the IRB/IEC, and regulatory author ities.  Prior to the subject’s enrollment in the study, the 
subject’s consent is required for  the data to be used for these  purposes and to gain direct access 
to their medical records for da ta verification purposes.  The s ubject must be assured that their 
identity will be protected.   To facilitate this, a unique iden tification number will be assigned 
and it will be used when reporting study-related data.  
10.11  Retention of Data 
Copies of all study documents should be retained by the PI for at least 2 years after the last 
approval of a marketing applic ation in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applica tions in an ICH region or at leas t two years have elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the inves tigational product, in accordance 
with 21 CFR 312.62.  These documents s hould be retained for a longer period, however, if 
required by regulatory requirement s or by agreement with the Sp onsor.  It is the responsibility 
of the Sponsor to inform the I nvestigator/institution as to whe n these documents no longer need 
to be retained.  The final databa se will be archived by the Spo nsor according to the regulatory 
requirements. 
10.12  Financial Disclosure 
PI and SI are required to provide f ull disclosure of any financ ial relationship to the Sponsor or 
its designee(s) prior to partici pation in any tri al-related act ivities.  Additionally, PI/SI are 
required to promptly provide updated information to the Sponsor  or its designee(s) regarding 
any relevant changes in financial  interests that occur during t he course of the clinical trial and 
for 1 year after completion of t he clinical trial.  For additio nal guidance, refer to 21 CFR 
312.53(c) (4), 312.64(d), 812.43(c) (5), 812.110(d). 
 
10.13  Premature Termination of the Study 
If the study is prematurely ter minated or suspended, the Sponso r will promptly inform the PI/SI 
/institutions and the regulatory a uthority(s) of the terminatio n or suspension and the reason(s) 
for the termination or suspension.   
Millendo Therapeutics, Inc. ATR-101-201

 10.14  Clinical Study Report 
A CSR will be written for this study with a structure and conte nt that will conform to the ICH 
guidance, “Structure and Content of Clinical Stu dy Reports, ICH  Topic E3, July 1996”. 
10.15  Subject Insurance and Indemnity 
The Sponsor will provide insurance in accordance with local gui delines and requirements as a 
minimum for the subjects’ participating in this study.  The ter ms of insurance will be kept in the 
Sponsor’s regulatory files. 
10.16  Amendments to the Protocol 
Modifications of the signed prot ocol are only possible by approved protocol amendments and 
with the agreement of all res ponsible persons.  The procedure f or approval of a protocol 
amendment is identical to that for approval of the protocol.  T he IRB/IEC must be informed of 
all protocol amendments and should be asked for its opinion as to whether a full re-evaluation 
of the ethical aspects of the study is necessary by the committee.  This should be fully documented. 
The PI/SI must not implement a ny deviation from or change to th e protocol without discussion 
and agreement by the Sponsor i n writing and prior review and do cumented approval/favorable 
opinion of the amendment from the relevant IRB or IEC, except w here it is necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to study subjects or where the ch ange(s) involves only logistical 
or administrative aspects of t he study (e.g., change in monitor  or change of telephone number). 
Protocol amendments will be submitted to the appropriate author ity(s) as required by the applicable 
regulatory requirement(s).

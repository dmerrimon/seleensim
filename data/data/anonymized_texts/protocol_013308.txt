INTRODUCTION AND RAT IONALE  
Backgrou nd 
Adipose tissue is a loose type of connective tissue specialized to store lipids. The majority of 
lipids stored in adipose cells are triglycerides formed from imported free fatty acids and glycerol.  
It is not uniformly distributed in the body.  The majo r adipose depot is subcutaneous (about 80% 
of all body fat).1   In men it normally represents 15 -20% of body weight and in women, 20 -25% of 
body weight.  A certain amount of body fat is necessary for normal female reproduction and 
health. Subcutaneous adip ose tissue helps to shape, cushion and insulate the body and provides 
padding to some organs.  
 
Liposuction is a procedure that can help sculpt the body by removing unwanted fat from specific 
areas.2,3,4  The increasing popularity of this procedure is asso ciated with the evolution of 
techniques and equipment for fat removal, body reshaping and cellulite treatments. Besides the 
traditional suction -assisted lipoplasty, other options include ultrasound -assisted and external 
ultrasound -assisted liposuction, pow er-assisted liposuction, laser lipolysis as well as low -level 
laser -assisted liposculpture.5

The efforts in the search for alternative non -invasive or minimally invasive techniques and new 
tools aim mainly at reducing downtime, and facilitating treatment  for reduction of the  localized 
fatty tissue areas.6   
 
The SlimShape  device  is a non -invasive, body countering system based on radiofrequency (RF) 
and vacuum energies. The SlimShape provide a non -invasive approach to achieve a desired 
aesthetic effect ( reduction in abdominal fat and circumference ). The system is designed to 
enable an automatic, hands -free, full abdominal treatment that is based on a predefined user 
protocol. In addition, the system incorporates a skin -temperature control into the protocol,  
enabling accurate, stable and safer treatment.  
 
Device Descriptions  
Syneron SlimShape  Device  
The SlimShape  system is comprised of two main parts:  
 The SlimShape console  which houses the system's computer, control panel, electronics, 
discomfort button, co oling system and other power and control devices which operate 
and control the system.  
 The SlimShape Applicator Belt incorporates an array of vacuum cavities; each cavity 
includes a pair of RF electrodes and a suction pad. Each of the cavities moves 
indepe ndently of the others, applying software -controlled vacuum and RF pulses in turn.  
Main Console  
The SlimShape console (Figure 1) incorporates the major modul es required to deliver RF energy 
and negative air pressure (vacuum) to the  applicator belt assembly,  such as: 
 RF generator  
 Vacuum pump  
 Computer  
 15" LCD control panel with touch -screen technology

Figure 1:  SlimShape  System  
 
The Applicator  
The SlimShape applicator  Belt (Figure 2) incorporates a linear array of vacuum cavities; each 
cavity includes a pair of RF electrodes and a suction pad. Each cavity has sufficient mechanical 
degrees of freedom with respect to the neighboring ones, so that when the applicator belt is 
attached to the patient it conforms to the body curvature. Th e SlimShape applicator is tightened 
to the skin, ensuring vacuum tightness by a strap and buckle mechanism. An array of vacuum, 
air and RF valves/switches will distribute the RF and vacuum energies sequentially between the 
cavities according to a software -controlled routine. Each cavity has temperature sensors that 
enable accurate control of the skin's temperature.

A control button (Figure 3) is available to the patient in order to cease treatment i f any 
discomfort is felt during the treatment. The discomfort button is designed to be held in the 
patient's hand during the entire treatment session. The patient should be instructed to press the 
button at any time he/she feels discomfort related to the t reatment; this action stops the 
pulsing of vacuum and RF energy. The operator may then adjust the parameters or end the 
treatment session.

SlimShape is an upgraded version of the Vela Shape device that is intended for abdominal fat 
reduction. The Vela Shape device is cleared  by the Foo d and Drug Administration (FDA) . The 
upgraded version, the SlimShape device,  is investigational  and not yet FDA  cleared .  
STUDY DESIGN OVERVIE W 
This study is a prospective, baseline controlled, multi -center, one arm  clinical study showing  the 
performance and safety of the  SlimShape  treatment for abdominal  non-invasive fat and 
circumference reduction.  
Up to 120 Healthy subjects in up to  10 investigational sites will be enroll ed in this study. All 
subjects will undergo an assessment of their general health. During the treatment period , 
subject’s  fat thickness and  circumference will be measured and  up to  three successive bi -weekly 
(two weeks interval)  treatments will be performe d.  
The study subjects will undergo treatments with SlimShape  device utilizing the SlimShape 
Applicator Belt . 
During the follow -up period  visit will be conducted as follow: 4 weeks (4wk FU), 8 weeks (8wk 
FU) and 12 weeks (12wk FU) post last treatment.  Subject’s fat thickness will be measured using 
2 different methods (Calibrated Caliper and Ultrasound  Imaging (USI )) and fat reduction will be 
assessed at each post baseline visit. C ircumference will be measured  in 3 measurements heights 
and circumference redu ction will be assessed at each post baseline visit. Additionally, 
investigator and subject questionnaires will be completed.  Finally, photography will be 
performed under visible light conditions of the front, right, left and back view.  Most of the 
assess ments will occur at each of the visits to the clinic.

Pre-Treatment Procedures  
It is expected that the screening and b aseline procedures will be conducted during the same 
visit as the treatment  (prior to the treatment). The  treatment visit procedures will take up to 1.5 
hours.  
Screening  
1. ICF - Prior to any study procedures, informed consent will be obtained.  When the 
subject fully understands the possible benefits and risks of the study, the subject will be 
asked to sign and date the informed consent form (ICF).  The subject will be given a copy 
of the signed ICF.  
2. Subject ID - subjects will be assigned a study subject ID number.  
3. Medical History - A medical history will be obtained to determine if the  subject  meet s 
the study criteria, including a list of all prescribed and over the counter medications 
taken within the previous 6 months will be recorded.   
4. Skin Exam - The su bject will undergo a routine skin exam to determine if they meet the 
study criteria including the presence of fatty tissue deposits in the treatment area.   
5. BMI – the volunteers’ height and weight will be taken for calculation of BMI.  
6. Pregnancy Screen - Subjects who are capable of becoming pregnant will undergo a urine 
pregnancy test. This will be repeated prior to all treatments , and at the end of the study  
(last FU visit / 12wk FU ).  If the Screening and Treatment procedures are not conducted 
on the same d ay, the urine pregnancy test will be repeated on the first treatment day.      
7. Scheduling: Subjects will be scheduled to return for the baseline  and first treatments  
visit within 14 days followi ng the screening visit. It is preferable the baseline procedur es 
and Tx.1 will be conducted immediately after the Screening visit .   
Baseline  
1. Photography – Baseline photographs will be obtained using a consistent camera and 
subject placement settings with a digital imaging system.  
2. BMI – the subject weight and height will be taken if baseline visit occurs on  a different 
day than the screening visit.

Measurements  
Measure the Fat Thickness at the Treated  Area  – Calibrated Caliper  
Assess fat thickness at treatment ar ea prior starting the treatment using calibrated cali per. 
 
Measure the Fat Thickness at the Treated  Area  – Ultrasound Imaging Device  
Ultrasound Imaging ( USI) provides a valid way for measuring fat thickness using known 
interfaces observed in any individual. USI is relies on the ability to recognize different  sub-skin 
interfaces and correctly  identifying them, such as the dermis and the  subcutaneous fat  layer  
interfaces.   
a) Treated area is defined below the sternum and above the iliac. Mark the rectangle of 
the treated area with white pencil.  
b) Measure 2-4 cm fro m each edge of the umbilicus  (superior ly and inferior ly) and 1.5-3 
cm medially and laterally  from the ends of these points ( as illustrated in Figure 5 , white 
lines ). Make sure  that the measurement points selected are at least 1 cm from the 
edges of the tre atment area ( including  the width of the USI transduce r, see green 
arrows in Figure 5 ).  
 
Figure 5: Ultrasound Measurements Points  
c) Mark the treated area and the measurements points on the transparency, to ensure 
measurement  of the same point in each subsequent visit.

d) Ultrasound measurements should be obtained from the edges of the measurement 
points, laterally  (see Figure 5 above , yellow dashed lines ). 
e) Place the applicator on the skin surface at ang le of 90⁰ (located the applicator under the 
measurement point line for consistency).  
f) Measurement should include all the area between the dermis and end o f the fat tissue 
fascia.  At least 2 measurements should be done in each measurement point.  
Marking height of circumference measurement  
The abdominal circumference  measurement will be marked at 1cm Above Iliac Height  (middle 
height of the treated area  circumference ). Patient should stand up straight when arms are 
placed at the rear of neck and head is positioned t owards the horizon ( Figure 7). Elbows will be 
positioned in front of the body ( Figure 7). 
The height for the circumference measurement will be marked at the anterior abdomen, at the 
back and at each lateral side of the body. Additional  measurements will be  taken at : Waist  
Height  (upper height of the treated area circumference ) and at 1.5inch (3.81cm) Below Navel 
Height  (lower height of the treated area circumference ) See Figure 6  below .

The 1cm Above Iliac Height , Waist  Height  and 1.5inch (3.81cm) Below Navel Height  will be 
measured using the height measuring device (supplied by Synero n Medical). The marking pencil 
will be placed horizontally at the stage of the measurement device during  the marking 
procedure. (Figure 7) 
Height of a ll measurements point will  be recorded in the CRF (will used as reference for the 
next visits  measurements ). As well, the circumference resu lts of each height will be recorded  at 
each visit.  
Measuring Circumference  
Abdominal circumference is measured to quantify the treatment effect. This procedure will be 
performed and recorded every visit at the clinic, imme diately following the measur ement of  
height marking.  
In order to achieve reproducible measurement results, the following requirements should be 
fulfilled:  
1. Patient should be wearing underwear and barefoot during circumference measurement.  
2. Patient should st and up straight when arms are placed at the rear of neck and head is 
positioned towards the horizon. Elbows will be positioned in front of the body (see 
Figure 8A).  
3. The measurement tape (supplied by Syneron Medical) should be in parallel to the floor 
during the measurement (see Figure 8B).  
4. The circumference measurement tape should be placed under  the marked reference 
points, in order to maintain repetitive height of the measurement.

5. Middle measurement should be taken at the level of the 1cm Above Iliac He ight. 
Additional two circumference measurements at Waist  Height  and 1.5inch (3.81cm) 
Below Navel  Height  will be taken.  This height level s should be recorded for follow up 
assessments.  
6. Consecutive measurements should be performed at the same height recorded  at 
baseline. In order to assure that the measuring tape is parallel to the floor, several 
reference points should be marked around the treatment area and the measuring tape 
should be placed such that it is aligned with them . 
 
Figure 8: Patient positioning during circumference measurements ( A) and measuring device position 
around the abdomen ( B) 
 
7. The measurement device should be activated at a constant tension to achieve an exact 
measure of the circumference (use measurement devi ce supplied by Syneron only).  
8. In order to minimize measurement inaccuracies originating from human error, it is 
recommended that, whenever possible, the same operator re -measures the patient at 
approximately at the same hour of day (± 3 hours).  
9. Patients s hould be under fasting for at least 3 hours pri or to circumference 
measurement.  
Treatment  Procedure  
Subjects will receive treatments with SlimShape  device utilizing  the SlimShape Applicator Belt on 
the anterior abdomen.  
Prior to each treatment measurements  of weight , fat thickness ( by Caliper & Ultrasound ), and 
abdominal circumference will be done according to the references from  the enrollment visit A

(Baseline/ prior to Tx.1 ). Only patients who are eligible  for treatment will be allowed to undergo 
the SlimS hape  procedure.  
Enrolled subjects will undergo up to 3 successive (according to investigator decision) bi-weekly 
(2 weeks interval) treatments (Tx.1, Tx.2 and Tx.3). Additional three  (3) visits in the clinic will be 
occurred to follow -up the abdominal fat and circumference reduction at visits 4, 5 and  6 (4 
weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks following last treatment).  
SlimShape  Treatment Procedure  
General Treatment I nstruction s 
1. Place the patient so that he/she is lying on his/her back, with the legs extended. In th is 
position, the abdomen is fully accessible and treatment can be easily performed.  
2. Remove any jewelry in the area of the application site.  
3. Ensure that the subject skin in the entire treatment is clean. The skin should be cleaned with 
water and soap and ha irs that exist in the treatment areas will be shaved.   
4. Ensure that the applicator belt  is clean or wipe with 70% alcohol and allowed to dry.  
5. The choice of treatment settings should take into consideration not only the severity of the 
treated condition (fa t layer), but also the subject’s skin type, tendency to bruise, the specific 
anatomical location (abdomen), and comfort.  
6. Immed iately prior the treatment , app ly a generous amount of the commercial VelaEase 
treatment lotion , RF coupling lotion .  You may need  to re -apply the lotion  if required . 
7. Position the SlimShape Applicator B elt at the correct/ chosen treatment area  (on the 
abdomen) . 
8. There should be a complete seal between the applicator and the skin  during the treatment 
session .  If you hear air being suc ked into the chamber, this indicates that the contact 
between the skin and the belt chambers is not ideal for vacuum creation. This usually means 
that the applicator is not positioned properly at that moment, which tends to happen in 
curved or bony areas, so special attention is required when treating such areas. Changing 
the orientation of the applicator slightly may solve this problem.   
9. The applicator belt chambers should have equal compression/contact with the skin to 
ensure safe and effective RF deliver y. 
10. Secure the magnetic pads on the sides of both belts, on both sides of the  patient  and 
tight the SlimShape belt .  
11. Select  the desired treatment protocol.

In the event of an emerge ncy, the Investigator will institute any medical procedures deemed 
appropriate. However, all such procedures must be promptly reported to the sponsor and the 
IRB/IEC.  
ADVERSE EVENTS (AE)  
An adverse event (AE) is any adverse change in health or side effect that occurs in a study 
participant during their participation in the study.  
Anticipated Adverse Effects  
Following treatment with the  SlimShape  the following local adverse effects could occur 
(anticipated):  
 Purpura   Erosion  
 Blister   Pain/ soreness  
 Bruising   First degree burn  
 Bullae   Second degree burn  
An adverse event (AE) is any undesired clinical occurrence in a study subject as indicated by 
signs, symptoms, illnesses, events that develop or worsen in severity in association with the 
study when deemed by the Investigator to be related to use of the device or study procedures. 
The Investigator will document all adverse signs and symptoms regardless of severity or 
frequency that are either volunteered by subjects or observed during the course of the study 
that are related to the device.  The Investigator will also record adverse experiences of subjects 
resulting from concurrent illnesses, reactions to concurrent medications, or progression of 
disease states that the Investigator deems related to the device. I ncluded in the description will 
be the nature of the sign or symptom, the date of onset, whether the event was serious, the 
severity, the relationship to study procedures or investigational device, the action taken, the 
date of resolution, and the outcome.  The Principal Investigator will determine the relationship 
of the adverse device effect to the investigational device.  
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effects  
For device studies, part 21 CRF 812.3(s)  uses the term unanticipated adverse device effect  which 
is defined as an y serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or 
death caused by, or associated with the  device, if that effect, problem, or death was not 
previously identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the  investigational plan or 
application (including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious 
problem associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.

Significant device failure may constitute  an adverse event if an undesirable experience occurs.  
This definition includes any event resulting from insufficiencies or inadequacies in the 
instructions for use or the deployment of the device, or any event that is a result of a user error.  
All unanti cipated adverse e ffects will be graded as follows:  
Mild:  Sign or symptom, usually transient, non -life-threatening requiring no special 
treatment and generally not interfering with usual activities.  
Moderate:  Sign or symptom, non -life-threatening which may  be ameliorated by simple 
therapeutic measures, and may interfere with usual activity.  
Major:  Sign or symptom that is intense or debilitating but non -life-threatening and 
that interferes with usual activities. Recovery is usually aided by therapeutic 
meas ures and the discontinuation of the study device may be required.  
Severe:  Any untoward medical occurrence that at any time results in death or life -
threatening illness, resulting in persistent or significant disability/incapacity.   
The relationship of t he adverse effect to the study is defined as follows:  
Probable:  An adverse event has a strong temporal relationship to study device, and 
another etiology is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
Possible:  An adverse event has a strong temporal relationsh ip to the study device, and 
an alternative etiology is equally or less likely compared to the potential 
relationship to study device.  
Probably not:  An adverse event has little or no temporal relationship to the study device 
and/or a more likely alternati ve etiology exists.  
Not related:  An adverse event has no temporal relationship to study device or has a much 
more likely alternative etiology.  
Reporting Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE)  
Anticipated Adverse Events:  Anticipated advers e events in this study include Purpura , 
blistering, bruising , bullae, erosion, soreness and burn . If an unanticipated adverse event occurs 
at any time during or after the use of the SlimShape  device, the Investigator must report it to 
Syneron.  
The Investi gator must report all unanticipated adverse device effects that are serious in nature 
to the clinical study monitor immediately or within twenty -four  hours by telephone (see below). 
If such an unanticipated adverse device effect is reported after normal wo rking hours, the 
Investigator will leave a voice message at the monitor’s telephone number with accompanying 
report of the unanticipated adverse device effect faxed or sent to the fax number/e -mail

at the site and at Syneron . 
RISK/BENEFIT ANALYSI S 
Risks  
Syneron has determined that the SlimShape  system  is non-significant risk device . As indicated in 
the AE section, the anticipated risks associated with the use o f both of the systems  are: 
 Purpura   Erosion  
 Blister   Pain/ soreness  
 Bruising   First degree burn  
 Bullae   Second degree burn  
Over 2500  subjects worldwide participated in clinical research and underwent treatment with 
the different Vela Shape  family device s. The SlimShape  device will be used in this study was 
previous ly used in  studies and emitted the same acoustic  energy . To date, no serious adverse 
events or unanticipated AEs have been reported. The reported AEs relate to skin and 
subcutaneous tissue, confin ed to the treatment area and were all mild in nature and resolved 
within the study period.  
Potential benefits to participating individuals and to society  
Subjects may or may not benefit from reduction of subcutaneous fatty tissue on the treated 
area  via a non-invasive technique  resulting in body contouring improvement .  All subjects in the 
treatment groups are expected to have some benefit from the treatment procedures as would

be expected for the commercial device s (SlimShape ). Subject will receive all tre atment 
procedures at no cost.  This study will benefit the advancement of medicine by generating data 
on safety and efficacy that will aid in the development of an alternative treatment options to 
procedures with higher potential risks subjects, such as li posuction.  The results of this study will 
help to determine whether th is device is  safe and effective for improvement of localized 
subcutaneous fat.  
Conclusion:  
In light of the potential benefits of non -invasive body contouring relative to its risks, the 
potential benefits associated with the use of the SlimShape  System  outweigh its risks, 
supporting study initiation.

Monitoring Plan  
At least 3 monitoring visit s are project ed during the whole study. The frequency of which will be 
based on enrolment, study activities and the study visit scheduled.   The first visit is schedul ed at 
the initiation of the study prior to the first subject treatment in  the study.  The second visit is 
scheduled after enrolment and treatment has been initiated and a third visit will be for a close -
out visit for the study.  Interim visits may be conducted as needed to assure compliance to the 
study protocol and regulatory requirements.   The number and f requency of monitoring visits 
may also be increased per the sponsor decision  to collect data and images post treatment.  
Case Report Forms

APPENDIX I II ‐ PHOTOGRAPHY  
At each of the specified time  points; photographs of the treated areas should be taken by 
investigator or their designee.  
 Photographs should be taken in a private room or area of the clinic under controlled 
conditions, including the distance from the camera to the subject, height of t he camera, 
background, camera positioning, subject's positioning and lighting in order to achieve 
high -quality before & after sets.  
 Consistent lighting - Lighting should be projected from about 45º angle in order to 
emphasize the body appearance.  
 It is impo rtant to keep a constant distance between the subject’s feet (use “sticky feet” 
or another way of marking) in order to properly present the effect of the treatment. 
The recommended distance between the feet is ~20  cm, but the main point is not to 
make this  distance too small, so the thighs touch each other, or too large.  
 The disposable underwear should be used for all photographs of all of the anatomical 
areas at all time points.  
 For consistency purposes, the same person should ideally take all study photographs, 
especially per area and subject.  
 The digital files should follow a co nsistent standard naming scheme containing subject 
initials and study ID #, visit or visit date.  
Specific photography details:  
Abdomen:  
Three photographs should be taken at each specified time point  
 Front  
 45º from the right side  
 90º from the right side  
 45º from the left side  
 90º from the left side  
The subject’s arms should remain out of the way; it  is best to either cross them over each  other 
in front of the chest or hold them up at a 90° angle to the body, ensuring that they do not rest 
on the chest or touch the body and that they do not cast a shadow in the photograph.

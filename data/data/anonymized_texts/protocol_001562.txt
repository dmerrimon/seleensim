1 Introduction
This document describes the detailed statistical methodology  of the Report Analy sis Plan 
(RAP) of the study CRAD001Y2 201: A three -arm, randomized, open -label , multi -center,
international phase II study  evaluating the combination treatment ofeverolimus (10mg daily ) 
with exemestane (25mg daily ) versus everolimus (10mg daily ) versus capecitabine (1250
mg/m2twice daily  for 14 daysin3-week cycles) in patients with estrogen -receptor positive, 
HER2 negative, advanced breast cancer after recurrence or progressi on on letrozole or 
anastrozole. The data will be anal yzed by  Novartis . It is planned that data from all centers that 
participate in this study will be used.
2 Definitions and general methodology
2.1 Definitions
2.1.1 Study drug and study treatment
Study drug is defined as everolimus, exemestane or capecitabine. All study  drugs are open -
label.
Study treatment is defined as everolimus + exemestane, everolimus monotherapy  or 
capecitabine monotherapy.
2.1.2 Date of first admini stration of study  drug
The date of first administration of study  drug is derived as the first date when a non -zero dose 
of study  drug isadministered and recorded on the dose administration record (DAR )eCRF. 
For the sake of simplicity , the date of first a dministration of study  drug will also be referred to 
as the start of stud y drug.
2.1.3 Date of last administration of study  drug
The date of last administration of study  drug is defined as the last date when a non - zero dose 
of study  drug isadministered and reco rded on the DAR e CRF .
2.1.4 Date of first administration of study  treatment
The date of first administration of study  treatment is derived as the first date when a non - zero 
dose of any component of study  treatment isadministered and recorded on the DAR eCRF . 
For the sake of simplicity , the date of first administration of study  treatment will also be 
referred to as the start of study  treatment.
2.1.5 Date of last administration of study  treatment
The date of last administration of study  treatment is defined as the last date when a non-zero 
dose of an y component of study treatment was administered and recorded on the DAR eCRF .
Novartis Confidential Page 8
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
2.1.6 Study day
The study  day for safety assessments (e.g.,adverse event onset, laboratory  abnormalit y 
occurrence, vital sign measurement, dose interruption ,etc.) will be calculated as the 
difference between the date of the assessment and the start of study  treatment plus 1.(Note: 
except in the case when the assessment is before start of study treatment in which case study 
day is calculated as the difference between the date of the assessment and the start of study 
treatment. In this particular case, the study day displayed on the listing will be negative.)
The study  dayfor all other, i.e.,non-safety assessments (tumor assessment, death, disease 
progression, tumor response, ECOG performance status , QoL assessment ) will be calculated 
as the difference between the date of the event and the randomization date plus 1. In other 
words, all efficacy  time-to-event variables (e.g.,progression -free survival, overall survival, 
time to response) will be calculated from date of randomization. (Example: if randomization 
date is 02JAN2007, start of study  drug is on 05JAN2007, and the date of death is 09JAN2007 ,
then the study  day when de ath occurred is 8.). 
The study  day will be display ed in data listings.
2.1.7 Baseline
Baseline value(s) is (are) the result of an investigation describing the “true” uninfluenced state 
of the subject. 
For efficacy evaluations , the last available assessment before or atthe date of randomization 
is taken as‘baseline ’value or ‘baseline ’assessment. In the context of the definition of 
baseline , efficacy  evaluations also include the ECOG performance status , patient -reported 
outcome measures and clinical measureme ntsincluded in the stratification.
For safety evaluations (i.e.,laboratory  and vital signs ), the last available assessment before or 
at the date of the start of study  treatment is taken as ‘baseline’ assessment.
If patients have no value as de fined above , the baseline measurement will be missing.
2.1.8 On-treatment assessment/event
Safety  summaries and selected summaries of deaths will summarize only on -treatment 
assessments/events. On-treatment assessment/event is defined as any assessment/event 
obtained in th e time interval:
[date of first administration of study  treatment; date of last administration of study treatment +
30days], i.e.,including the lower and upper limits . (Note: The calculation of study  treatment
duration , however, may use different rules a s specified in Section 3.6.1.)
2.1.9 Last contact date
The last contact date will be derived for patients not known to have died at the anal ysis cut -off 
using the sources presented in Table 2 -1 below:
Novartis Confidential Page 9
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
Table 2 -1 Last contact date data sources
Source data Condition
Last contac t date/last date patient was known to 
be alive from survival follow- up page Patient status is reported to be alive.
Do not use ifpatient status is reported 
unknown.
Start/End dates from further antineoplastic 
therapyNon-missing medication/procedure term.
Start/End dates from drug administration record Non-missing dose. Doses of 0 are allowed.
End of treatment date from end of treatment page No condition.
Tumor(RECIST) assessment date Evaluation is marked as ‘done’.
Laboratory/PK collection dates Sample collection marked as done. 
Vital signs date At least one non -missing parameter value.
Performance status date Non-missing performance status.
Start/End dates of AE Non-missing verbatim term.
The last contact date on or before the data cut-offdate should be used ; the cut-off date should 
not be used as the censoring date (even in presence of post cut- off data) unless the patient was 
seen or contacted on the cut-off date .   
Imputed dates (e.g., analy sis cut -off date programmatically  imputed to replace the missing 
end date of a dose administration record) will not be used to derive the last contact date.
Partial ly imputed dates (i.e., only  day or day  and month imputed) are allow ed to be used for 
last contact date only if coming from Survival Follow-up page .
The last contact date will be used for censoring of patients in the anal ysis of overall survival.
2.2 Data included in the analy sis
An efficacy  interim analy sisof PFS was conducted to allow early termination of the 
everolimus monotherap y arm, in case the efficacy in t he everolimus monotherapy  arm wasby 
far inferior compared to the everolimus + exemestane combination arm . Thisefficacy  interim 
analysis was planned after 75 PFS events have been reached across the following 2 arms :
everolimus monotherap y and everolimus + exemestane combination treatment .
The final PFS analysis is planned to be conducted when approximately 150 PFS events per 
local tumor assessment have been documented in each of the t wo following groups:
the everolimus + exemestane combination arm combined with the everolimus 
monotherap y arm, and
Novartis Confidential Page 10
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
the everolimus + exemestane combination arm combined with the capecitabine 
monotherap y arm.
The final OS analysis was planned to be conducted 2 years after the randomization of the last 
patient .Following protocol amendment , the final OS analy sis will be conducted at the time of 
the planned final PFS analy sis.
The final statistical analy sis will be performed using all data collected in the data base up to 
the data cut-off date. Any data collected beyond the cut-off date will not be included in the 
analysis and will not be used for an y derivations.
2.3 Definitions of analysis populations
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) comprises all patients to whom study treatment has been 
assigned by randomization. All efficacy analyses will be conducted using data from this 
population according to the intent -to-treat (ITT) principle, i.e., patients will be analy zed 
according to the treatment and stratum they have been assigned to during the randomization 
procedure.
The Safety Setincludes all patients who received any study  treatment. In analyses of the 
safet y set, p atients will be anal yzed acc ording to the study  treatment they  actually  received.
The actual treatment received corresponds to:
-the randomized treatment if patients took at least one dose of that treatment.
-the first treatment received if the randomized treatment was never received
2.4 Concomitant medications with specific impact on the analysis
2.4.1 Inducers, inhibitors and substrates of CYP3A
Everolimus is metabolized by  CYP3A4 in the liver and ,to some extent ,in the intestinal wall.
Capecitabine and its metabolites d onot inhibit the metabolism of CYP3A4 substrates but may 
inhibit the metabolism of CYP2C9 su bstrates. Therefore:
Co-administration of CYP2C9 substrates (e.g. Irbesartan, Losartan, Pheny toin, 
Cyclophosphamide) should be exercised with caution and monitored closel y per 
capecitabine local label.
co-administration with strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e. g., ketoconazole, itraconazole,
ritonavir) or P -glycoprotein (PgP) inhibitor isto be avoided ;
co-administration with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g., ery thromy cin, fluconazole) or 
PgP inhibitors isto be used with caution;
concomitant use of seville oran ge, star fruit, grapefruit and their juices that affect CYP3A4 
and PgP activit y isto be avoided;
concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inducers such as pheny toin, carbamazepine, rifampin, 
rifabutin, phenobarbital, St. John’s wort isto be avoided.
The following will be tabulated and summarized:
Novartis Confidential Page 11
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
1. c linically  relevant drug interactions: substrates, inducers, and inhibitors of isoenzy me 
CYP3A;
2. list of clinically  relevant drug interactions mediated by  PgP substrates ;
3. list of clinically  relevant drug interacti ons mediated by  PgP inhibitors ;
4. list of clinically  relevant drug interactions mediated by  PgP inducers.
Despite the fact that some of these drugs should be avoided completel y and some used with 
caution, there may be patients who took these drugs during the study .In that case, the 
concomitant medications need to be identified and classified (review to be performed by a 
Clinical Pharmacologist) and then tabulated and/or listed in the Clinical Study  Report as 
approp riate. 
2.4.2 Further anti -neoplastic therapy  
Administration of anti-neoplastic drugs (apart from study  treatment) and other investigational 
drugs is no t allowed during study  treatment . Patients who take such anti -neoplastic drugs after 
randomization but before the end of treatment will be identified as protocol deviations. In 
addition, their efficacy  data (other than overall survival) will be censored so that tumor 
assessments made after the start of anti-neoplastic drugs will not be included in the primary  
efficacy  analysesfor PFS. The same rule will apply  to efficacy  analyses for best overall 
response (BOR) , ECOG performance status and QoL assessments . For details on the 
censoring rules ,see [Appendix 1 of the study  protocol] .
Clinical review of study  data will be performed to identify  anti-neoplastic m edications that are 
not allowed during stud y treatment .
2.5 Implementation of RECIST 1.1
Response and progression evaluation will be performed according to the RECI ST 1.1 
guideline (as described in detail in [Appe ndix 1 of the study  protocol] ). The text below 
provides more detailed instructions and rules needed for programming purposes.
2.5.1 Overall lesion response for patients with bone lesions only at baseline
For patients with lytic or mixed ly tic-blastic bone lesion s only  at baseline, RECI ST 1.1 will be 
extended to allow the evaluation of overall lesion response in such patients , which will be 
based solely  on non- target lesion responses and/or an occurrence of a new lesion. Bone 
lesions will be entered as non- target lesions. Specificall y, in the absence of new lesions, the 
overall lesion response at each assessment will be one of the following: complete response, -
non-CR/non -PD, unknown response , or progressive disease based on non- target lesion 
responses. -Non-CR/non -PD response -will include all assessments not qualify ing for 
complete response, progressive disease or unknown response . In the presence of a new lesion, 
the overall lesion response will be progressive disease.
2.5.2 Disease progression
For patients with measurable disease at baseline, disease progression will only be assigned if 
it is documented as per RECI ST 1.1 by an unbiased assessment method (e.g.,CTscan, MRI, 
Novartis Confidential Page 12
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
X-ray, photo graph yfor skin lesions , etc.). A new lesion will be entered on the ‘New lesio n’ 
RECI ST eCRF with the corresponding measurement method (or method=‘Other’) .
Discontinuation due to disease progression without supporting objective evidence (as defined 
above) will not be attributed to progressive disease.
Patients with bone only lesions , lytic or mixed lytic-blastic, will be allowed to enter the study
but such lesions will not be considered as measurable lesions in this study . The following 
criteria will be used to declare disease progression among these patients:
the appearance of one o r more new l ytic lesions in bone ,
the appearance of one or more new lesions outside of bone,
unequivocal progression of existing bone lesions .
Note: Pathologic fracture, new compression fracture, or complications of bone metastases will 
not be considered as evidence of disease progression unless one of the above -mentioned 
criteria is fulfilled.
2.5.3 Best overall response
The best overall tumor response will be assessed perRECI ST1.1. The definitions and details 
ofthe derivation are given in [Appendix 1 of the study protocol ].
Only  tumor assessments performed before the start of any further anti-neoplastic therapies 
(i.e.,any additional anti-neoplastic medications or surger y)will be considered in the 
assessment of best overall response. These anti-neoplastic therapies will be identified from the 
data collected on ‘Anti -neoplastic therapies since discontinuation of study  drug’ eCRF .
Since ,in this study ,tumor assessments are performed every  6 weeks, allowing for a ± 1-week 
deviation window, the standard definition of a best overall response evaluation of “stable 
disease”, “progressive disease” or “unknown” given in [Appendix 1 of the study  protocol ] 
requires an adjustment.
The following definitions will be used:
The determination of CR and PR remains the same as stated in [ Appendix 1 of the 
study  protocol ].
SD = at least one SD assessment (or better) after randomization (and not qualify ing for 
CR or PR). Because the first assessment after randomization is scheduled at 6 weeks, 
allowing for a 1-week deviation window, SD is defined as at least one SD assessment 
(or better) > 5weeks after randomization (and not qualify ing for CR or PR).
If progression is detected as the first evaluable assessment in ≤ 9weeks after 
randomization, the best overal l response evaluation will be “progressive disease.”
UNK = all other cases (i.e., not qualify ing for confirmed CR or PR and without SD for 
more than 5weeks or early  progression within the first 9weeks).
Patients with best overall response “unknown” will be summarized by reason for having 
unknown status. The following reasons will be used:
no valid post -randomization assessment ,
all post -randomization assessments have overall response UNK ,
Novartis Confidential Page 13
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
new anti -neoplastic therapy  started before first post -randomization assessment ,
SD in less than 5weeks post-randomization (‘SD too earl y’),
PD after more than 9 weeks post-randomization (‘PD too late’) .
Special (and rare) cases where best overall response is “unknown” due to both SD in less than 
5weeks and PD after more than 9weeks post-randomization will be classified as ‘SD too 
early.’
2.5.4 Change in imaging modality
Per RECI ST1.1, the imaging method used at baseline should be matched at all subsequent 
assessment s. A change in methodology  can be defined as either a change in contrast use (e.g. 
keeping the same technique, like CT, but switching from with to without contrast use or vice-
versa, regardless of the justification for the change) or a change in technique (e.g. from CT to 
MRI, or vice-versa), or a change in any other imaging modality . A change in methodology 
will result by default in a UNK overall lesion response assessment . However ,another 
response assessment than the Novartis calculated UNK response may be accepted from the 
investigator if a definitive response assessment can be justified, based on the available 
information.
2.5.5 Determination of missing adequate assessments
The term ‘missing adequate assessment’ is defined as a tumor assessment that isnot done or 
for which theoverall lesion response is‘unknown’. For the sake of simplicity , a ‘missing 
adequate assessment’ is also referred to as a ‘missing assessment’.
As detailed in Appendix 1 to the study  protocol , the PFS censoring and event date options 
depend on the presence and the number of missing tumor assessments. For example: 
1.in the primary  anal ysis of PFS, an event occurring after two or more consecutive 
missing assessments is censored at the last adequate assessment , i.e., the last 
assessment preceding the missing assessment(s) ;
2.in one of the s ensitivity  analy ses of PFS, an event occurring after one or more missing 
assessments is back -dated to the date of the next scheduled assessment.
An exact rule to determine whether there is none, one or two missing assessments is therefore 
needed. This rule isbased on the time interval (distance) between the last adequate tumor 
assessment date and the event date. 
If the distance is greater than threshold D1= 6+2 = 8 weeks ,the analysis will assume one 
missing assessment. If the distance is greater than D2=(2*6)+ 2 = 14 weeks, the analy sis will 
assume two missing assessments. The threshold D1 is formed based onthe protocol -specified 
interval between consecutive tumor assessments plus the protocol -allowed window around the
assessments. Similarly , the thres hold D2 is formed based on the two-fold of the protocol -
specified interval between consecutive tumor assessments plus the protocol -allowed window 
around the assessments.
Therefore, using the D2 definition above, the censoring of an event occurring after ≥2missing
TAs (in primary  PFS analy sis) can be refined as follows: if the distance between the last
adequate TA date and the PFS event date is larger than D2,the patient will be censored and 
the censoring reason will be 'Event documented after twoor more missing tumor assessments'.
Novartis Confidential Page 14
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
The same definition of D2 will be used to determine the PFS censoring reason. If the distance 
between the last adequate tumor assessment date and the first of the following dates:
1. anal ysis cut -off date
2. start date of further anti -neoplastic therap y 
3. date of stud y treatment discontinuation due to consent withdrawal
4. date of stud y treatment discontinuation due to loss to follow -up 
is smaller or equal to D2,the censoring reason will be 1.‘Ongoing’, 2. ‘New cancer therapy
added’, 3.‘Withdrew consent’ or 4. ‘Loss to follow -up’, respectivel y, depending on the case. 
However, if this distance is larger than D2,the censoring reason will alway s default to 
‘Adequate assessment no longer available’.

pages ‘End of Treatment’ and ‘Study  Evaluation Completion’ there will be one combined 
summary ,stratified by  treatment, showing:
Number (%) of patients who are still on-treatment (based on the absence of the ‘End

Number (%) of patients who discontinued the st udy treatment (based on the ‘End of 
Treatment’ page);
Reasons for stud y treatment discontinuation (based on the ‘End of Treatment’ page).
Number (%) of patients who entered the post-treatment evaluation phase (based on the 
‘End of Treatmen t’ page);
Number (%) of patients who discontinued from the post-treatment evaluations (based 
on the ‘Study  Evaluation Completion’ page); 
Reasons for discontinuation from the post-treatment evaluations phase (based on the 
‘Study  Evaluation Completion’ page).
The summary  ofreasons for End of treatment discontinuation will also bepresented 
separately  for patients who have been censored in the primary  PFS analysis due to the reason 
of“Antineoplastic therapy  started” reason. 
3.6 Stud y treatment
Duration of study  treatment expos ure, cumulative dose, dose intensit y (DI) and relative dose 
intensity  (RDI) will be summarized by treatment. In addition, the duration of exposure to

be presente d for the number of patients in each interval. The number of patients, who have 
dose reductions or interruptions, and the reasons, will be summarized by  treatment.
Listings of all doses of the study  treatment along with dose change reasons will be produced. 
The Safety Setwill be used for all summaries and listings of study  treatment.
Novartis Confidential Page 17
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
3.6.1 Duration of study treatment exposure
The following algorithm will be used for everolimus and exmestane to calculate the duration 
of study  treatment exposure for patients who took at least one dose of any of the components 
of the study  treatment:
Duration of exposure (days) = (date of last administration of study  treatment) –(date of first
administration of study  treatment) + 1.
For capecitabine, the duration of exposure will include the rest periods and will be then 
defined as:
Duration of exposure (days) = (date of last administration of study  treatment) –(date of first
administration of study  treatment) + 7days (corresponding to the theoretical rest period) + 1.
The durati on includes the periods of temporary  interruption (of any component of the study 
treatment for an y reason).
Duration of exposure to each component of the study  treatment will also be calculated.
3.6.2 Cumulative dose
Cumulative dose is defined as the total dose given during the study  treatment exposure period 
and will besummarized for each of the study  treatment components separatel y. For patients 
who donot receive any drug ,the cumulative dose will be set to zero.
3.6.3 Dose intensity  and relative dose intensity
Dose intensity  (DI) for patients with non -zero duration of exposure is defined as follows:
DI (dosing unit / unit of time) = Cumulative dose (dosing unit) / Duration of exposure (unit of
time).
For patients who d onot receive any drug, the DI will be set to zero.
Planned dose intensity  (PDI) is the assigned dose by unit of time planned to be given to 
patients as per protocol in the same dose unit and unit of time as that of the Dose Intensit y.
For Capecitabine, the planned dose recommended as per protocol is 1250 mg/m2 twice daily 
for 14-days every  3 weeks (i.e. 3-week cycle). The planned dose intensity  including the rest 
period of 7 day sis calculated as :
PDI (Cap.) = 1250 mg/m2*2*14 day s / 21 day s = 1666.67 mg/m2/day . 
Relative dose intensity  (RDI) is define d as follows:
RDI = DI (dosing unit / unit of time) / PDI  (dosing unit / unit of time).
DI and RDI will be summarized separatel y for each of the study  treatment components, but 
using the duration of the study  treatment exposure, not the duration of exposur e to each of the 
components. 
For the calculation of theassigned body -surface -area-adjusted capecitabine dose at every 
cycle, the following formula will be used: 
Novartis Confidential Page 18
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
BSA [m2] = 234.94*(height[cm]**0.422)*(weight[kg]**0.515)/10000 . 
according to the height at baseline and the last available weight at or before the cy cle start 
date. 
3.6.4 Dose reductions or interruptions
The number of patients ,who have dose reductions or interruptions, and the reasons for such 
reductions/interruptions , will be summ arized separately  for each of the study  treatment 
components.
An interruption is defined as a 0mg dose given on one or more day s. However, f or last records, 
it will be counted as an interruption only  if there are 2 or more last records with 0 mg dose.
If a patient moves from a dose level that is higher than the studied dose under the protocol to 
the dose level that is being studied in the protocol ,such changes will not becounted as 
reduction s. However, if any patient move sdirectly  from a higher than studied dose down to a 
lower than protocol -studied dose, or to the dose level being studied under the protocol but on 
a less frequent regimen, such changes will be counted as reductions. If first dose is lower than 
the studied dose under the protocol, it will be counted as a dose reduction.
For everolimus and exemestane, reductions count should be based on the actual total daily 
dose (mg). 
For capecitabine, reductions count should be based on the actual total daily  dose adjusted to 
BSA (mg/m2) with an acceptance windows of 10%: if the difference compared to the previous 
non-zero dose (mg/m2) is greater than 10% then it is a reduction. If first dose is lower than the 
studied dose under the protocol (mg/m2) by more than 10%, it will be counted as a dose 
reduction.
If one drug is permanently  discontinued (before a protocol -planned discontinuation date) 
while the other is ongoing , such discontinuations will be classified as interruptions .
Dose reductions and interruptions will be tabulated both separatel y and in a combined fashion . 
In the combined summary , dose interruptions will be considered as dose reductions to 0 mg,
and therefore all reductions/interruptions will be labeled as reductions and tabulated in one 
table. Dose escalations will be summarized by  treatment and level of reduced dose ( -1 versus -
2) for all patients with dose reductions in a separate table.
3.7 Concomitant therapy
Concomitant therapy  is defined as all interventions (therapeutic treatments and procedures) 
besides the study  treatment that were administered to a patient, preceding or coinciding with 
the study  assessment period.
Concomitant medications entered into the database will be coded using the WHO Drug 
Reference List to allow for categorization by preferred term. In addition to categ orizing 
medication data by preferred term, drugs will beclassified according to their ATC 
classification in order to present and compare how they are being utilized. 
Concomitant medications and significant non -drug therapies taken concurrently  with the s tudy 
drug(s) will be listed and summarized by ATC class, preferred term and treatment arm by 
Novartis Confidential Page 19
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
means of frequency  counts and percentages. These summaries will include medications 
starting on or after the start of study  treatment or medications starting prior to the start of 
study  treatment and continuing after the start of study treatment.
Any prior concomitant medications or significant non-drug therapies starting and ending prior 
to the start of study  treatment will be listed.
The S afety Setwill be used fo r all concomitant medication tables and listings.
Concomitant medications that have the potential to impact some specific analyses (e.g.,
efficacy  analyses) will be identified prior to database lock. Separate summaries of these 
concomitant medications will be produced and the corresponding analysis populations will be 
used. Strong and moderate inhibitors, inducers, or substrates of the isoenzyme CYP3A will be 
identified as described in Section 2.4.1 . Thestrong ones will be tabulated by ATC code. Both 
strong and moderate ones will be listed. New anti-neoplastic therapies will be listed based on 
their identification (b y the method given in Section 2.4.2 ) by the protocol deviation process.
Anti- neoplastic therapies since discontinuation of study  drug will be listed and summarized by  
ATC class, preferred term and treatment arm by means of frequency  counts and percentages 
in separate summaries using the Full Analy sis Set. In addition, the first regimen with 
combination of several drugs if any after the study  treatment discontinuation will be 
summarized by  treatment arms, using the full analy sis set population. 
3.8 Efficacy  evaluation
The efficacy  endpoints based on tumor assessments will be derived according to RECI ST 1.1
(see Appendix 1 of the study  protocol for details). The tumor endpoint derivation is based on 
the sequence of overall lesion responses at each assessment/time point. The overall lesion 
response at agiven assessment/time point will be provided bythe local (treating center’s) 
radiologist/investigator. In p articular, the final local (treating center ’s) 
radiologist ’s/investigator ’svisit response for each assessment/time point collected on the 
REC IST 1.1 overall lesion response CRF page will be used to derive the primary  efficacy 
endp oint. The tumor assessment dates will be derived by Novartis using the dates of the 
individual lesion measurements. 
Data included in efficacy  analy ses
Efficacy  analyses will include all data observed in patients from the FAS regardless of 
whether the data were observed on -treatment or after the study  treatment discontinuation until 
the analysis cut-off date. In particular, the “30days”rule applied to all safet y analyses will 
NOT be used for efficacy anal yses.
For patients who took other anti-neoplastic drugs ,their efficacy  data (other than overall 
survival) will be censored so that the tumor assessments made after the administration of the 
other anti -neoplastic drugs are not included in the primary  efficacy  anal yses.
For patients with protocol deviation code C17 (“Lack of PI oversight and no eCRF signatures 
at Database Lock (DBL) due to PI departure and no replacement ”), efficacy  data will be 
analyzed as follows:
Novartis Confidential Page 20
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
Progression -Free Survival will be censored at randomization date with censoring 
reason “Adequate assessment no longer available”
Overall Survival will be censored at randomization date with censoring reason “Lost 
to follow-up”
Best Overall Response will beset to UNK with reason “No valid post-baseline 
assessment”
Overall Response status as non -responder
Clinical Benefit status as non -responder
3.8.1 Primary  Efficacy
Progression -free survival (PFS) derived from an investigator’ s assessment of radiology  data 
willbe used as the primary  efficacy  variable. The PFS is defined as the time from the date of 
randomization to the date of the first documented disease progression or death due to any 
cause , whichever occurs first.If a patient has not progressed or died at the analysis cut-off 
date,or ifshe receives any further anti -neoplastic therapy , PFS will becensored at the time of 
the last tumor assessment before the cut -off date or the anti -neoplastic therap y date whichever 
occurs first. Further anti-neoplastic therapies will be identified via protocol deviations and 
from data collected on ‘Antineoplastic therapies since discontinuation of study  drug’ eCRF. 
Definitions and further details on PFS can be found in Appendix 1of the protocol .
Discontinuation due to disease progression (collected on the “End of treatment” and “Study 
Evaluation Completion” page) without supporting objective evidence satisfy ing progression 
criteria per RECI ST1.1will not be considered a progressive disease. 
Primary  analy sis
The primar y objective of this study  is to estimate the hazard ratio of a progression -free 
survival event comparing the everolimus + exemestane combination therap y with the 
everolimus monotherapy  in postmenopausal women with ER-positive, HER2- negative, 
advanced breas t cancer (ABC) after recurrence or progression on letrozole or anastrozole.
The primary  analysis of PFS will be based on data from investigator/local radiology  review. 
The analysis will be performed ontheFAS following the intention -to-treat (ITT)princip le, 
i.e., patients will be analy zed according to the treatment group they were randomized and the 
stratum they were assigned to at baseline. The analysiswill use the default censoring and
event date definitions from Table 3-1 of Appendix 1 of the study  protocol, i.e. A(1), B(1), 
C1(1), C2(1), D(1), E(1), and F(1). In particular, PFS will be censored at the last adequate 
tumor assessment if one of the following occurs: absence of a PFS event; a PFS event occurs
after a new anticancer therap y is given; a PFS event occur safter two or more missing tumor 
assessments (see Section 2.5.5). Discontinuation of study  treatment (for any reason) will not 
be considered as a reason for censoring. 
Novartis Confidential Page 21
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
Kaplan- Meier estimates
The Kaplan -Meier (KM) estimate of the progression -free survival function will be computed 
for each treatment group using PROC LIFETEST with method=KM option in SAS . The 
results will also be plotted graphicall y (Kaplan -Meier curves) by treatment and by 
randomization strata as assigned through IRT. The plots willdisplay  the number of patients at 
risk at equidistant time points. 
The estimated median PFS for each treatment group will be provided along with the 
approximate 90% confidence intervals (Brookmeyer and Crowley , 1982) . Additionally , the
25thand 75thpercentiles will also be computed .The progression -free survival probabilities at 
2, 4, 6 and 9months (timepoints to be adapted depending on the length of the follow -up), 
along with 90% confidence intervals ,will be presented by treatment group.The log-log 
transformation available within PROC LIFETEST will be used to compute the confidence 
intervals.
Hazard ratio estimate
The hazard ratio estimate of a PFS event comparing the everolimus + exemestane 
combination therapy with everolimus monotherapy , along with the two-sided 9 0% confidence 
interval ,will be obtained from the stratified Cox proportional hazards model , fitted using SAS 
PHREG procedure with ties=EXACT option and the stratification information obtained 
through IRT. In the PHR EG procedure ,the MODEL statement will include the indicator of 
assignment to the everolimus + exemestane arm as the only covariate . The baseline hazard 
function will be allowed to vary across strata, i.e.,the STRATA statement will include the 
stratificat ion variable obtained through I RT.
Sensitivity and other supportive analy ses of the primary  endpoint PFS
To assess the impact of stratification, asensitivity analysis will be performed to estimate the 
PFS treatment effect (everolimus + exemestane versus everolimus alone) using the 
unstratified Cox regression model y ielding the hazard ratio estimate of a PFS event along with 
the 90% confidence interval. 
The following sensitivity  PFS analyses will be performed to assess the impact of 
missing/unknown tumor assessments ( analyses 1 and 2 below) and to assess the impact of 
PFS censoring due to another anti -neoplastic therapy (anal ysis 3 below) :
PFS using local radiology assessments on the FAS and using the following options in
Table 14-5 on p age 121 of Appendix 1inthe study protocol : A(1), B(1), C1(1), C2(3), 
D(1), E(1), and F(1), i.e. ,taking the event whenever it occurs even after two or more 
missing tumor assessments (see Section 2.5.5) . In the summary  table, this approach will 
be referred to as the ‘actual event PFS anal ysis’.
PFS using local radiology assessments on the FAS and using the following options in 
Table 14 -5 on page 121of Appendix 1in the study protocol : A(1), B(1), C1(2), C2(2), 
D(1), E(1), and F(1), i.e. ,backdating of events occurring after missing tumor assessments.
In the summary  tables, this approach will be referred to as the ‘backdating PFS analy sis’. 
PFS u sing local radiology assessments on the FAS and using the following options in 
Table 14 -5 on page 121of Appendix 1in the study pr otocol : A(1), B(1), C1( 1), C2(1), 
Novartis Confidential Page 22
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
D(1), E(1), and F( 4), i.e. , and not censoring patients at the start of new anti-neoplastic 
therapies (if tumor assessment data are available following the start of new anti -neoplastic 
therapies).
A multivariate stratified Cox regression model will be used to evaluate the effect of baseline
demographic and disease characteristics of potential prognostic value on PFS. Robustness of 
the PFS hazard ratio estimate to the adjustment for various prognostic factors in the stratified 
Cox model including prior chemotherap y use (yes vs. no), performance status (0 vs. 1 or2),
presence ofbone lesions only at baseline (yes vs. no), time since first diagnosis of 
metastasis/recurrence to randomization (< 6 m onths vs.>= 6 m onths), non-steroidal 
aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) (letrozole or anastrozole ) use (adjuvant vs. metastatic setting ), 
number of organs involved (1 vs. 2 vs. >=3 –to be adapted depending on the number of 
patients in each category ), and PgR status (positive vs. negative) will be assessed. The strata 
will be based on stratification information obtained through IRT. A revised multivariate 
stratified cox model including the key prognostic factors as well as the baseline covariates 
where imbalan ces between arms have been observed will be provided: performance status (0 
vs. 1 or 2), presence of bone lesions only at baseline (yes vs. no), number of organs involved 
(1 vs. 2 vs. >=3), prior chemotherapy  use (yes vs. no), age (<65 years vs. >=65 yearsold) and 
Race (Caucasian vs. non -caucasian). 
Further supportive anal yses will include:
Number of patients with a PFS event and number of patients censored for the PFS 
analysis will be summarized. I n addition, a summary  of reasons for PFS censoring will 
be provided b y treatment arm. The following categories will be used as appropriate 
(based on the end of treatment page, the stud y evaluation completion page andthe 
survival page and based on the distance D2 defined in Section 2.5.5 ):
Ongoing without event
Adequate assessment no longer avail able (when follow -up for progression is 
stopped at a certain time or interrupted for a certain time period before cut -off for 
any reason, e.g. ,due to los sto follow- up or consent withdrawal )
New cancer therap y added
Event documented after two or more miss ing tumor assessments (for primary  
analysis onl y)
Timing of all tumor assessments will be depicted graphicall y as per local radiology
review by treatment arm
95% confidence intervals will be provided for all estimates of the main primary  
analysis (i.e. median, survival probabilities and hazard ratio)
3.8.2 Secondary  Efficacy
Key Secondary  Objective
The key secondary  objective of this study  is to estimate the hazard ratio of a PFS event using 
local investigator’s/radiologist’s tumor assessments comparing the everolimus + exemestane 
Novartis Confidential Page 23
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
combination therap y with the capecitabine therapy  in postmenopausal women with ER-
positive, HER2- negative, advanced breast cancer after recurrence or progression on letrozole 
or anastrozole.
The stratified Cox regression model will beused to estimate the hazard ratio of a PFS event, 
along with the associated 90% confidence interval, comparing the everolimus + exemestane 
combination therapy  with the capecitabine therapy where the stratification information will be 
obtained through IRT. The confidence interval for the hazard ratio will not be adjusted for 
multiple comparisons.
Distribution of PFS will be assessed using the Kaplan -Meier estimation method. The 
estimated median PFS for each treatment group will be provided along with the approximate 
90% confidence intervals .Additionally , the 25thand 75thpercentiles will also be computed .
The progression -free survival probabilities at 2, 4, 6 and 9months (timepoints to be adapted 
depending on the length of the follow -up), along with 90% confidence intervals, will be 
presented b y treatment group .
The same statistical principles will be applied and supportive anal yses conducted as described
in Section 3.8.1 “Sensitivity  and other supportive analy ses of the primary  endpoint PFS ” for 
the key  secondary  treatment comparison of everolimus + exemestane combination therapy  
versus capecitabine therapy .
Other Secondary  Objectives
Other secondary  objectives of this study  are to evaluate each of everolimus + exemestane 
versus everolimus monotherap y and everolimus + exemestane versus capecitabine 
monotherap y with respect to overall survival (OS), overall response rate (ORR), clinical 
benefit rate (CBR), deterioration in the ECOG performance status, changes in quality  of life 
scores over time, and safety .
The analysis of all secondary  efficacy  endpoints (mentioned above) will be performed on the 
FAS.
Overall survival (OS)
Overall survival (OS) is defined as the time from the date of randomizatio n to the date of 
death due to any cause. The cut-off date for the planned final OS analysis was specified 2 
years after the randomization of the last patient. However, at that time, the number of PFS 
events needed for final PFS analysis was not reached. Therefore the final OS analysis will be 
conducted at the time of the planned final PFS analy sisusing the same cut-off date. If death 
has not been observed by the analy sis cut -off date, then OS will be censored at the date of last 
contact.
The OS analysis will be based on data from the FAS on the ITT basis, i.e., according to the 
treatment group patients are randomized to at baseline. Distribution of OS in each of the three 
treatment arms will be assessed using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) estimation method , and the
treatment -specific KM curves will be graphically  display ed. The estimated median OS and 
probability  of surviving at the estimated median OS, along with 90% confidence intervals, 
will be presented for the three treatment arms. Stratified Cox regression mod els will be used 
to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of death from any cause, along with the associated 90% 
Novartis Confidential Page 24
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
confidence interval, comparing (i) the everolimus + exemestane combination therapy  with 
everolimus monotherap y, and (ii) the everolimus + exemestane combination therap y with 
capecitabine therap y where the stratification informati on will be obtained through IRT and the 
baseline hazard functions will be allowed to vary  across strata.
As a sensitivity  analysis, a stratified multivariate Cox regression model will be fitted after 
additional adjust ment for key potential prognostic factors including prior chemotherap y (yes 
vs. no), performance status (0 vs. 1, 2), presence of bone lesions only at baseline (yes vs. no), 
time since first diagnosis of metastasis/recurrence to randomization (<6 Months, >=6 
Months), non-s teroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) (letrozole or anastrozole) usage (adjuvant 
vs. metastatic), number of organs involved (1 vs. 2 vs. ≥ 3 –to be adapted depending on the 
number of patients in each category ) and PgR status (positive vs.negative). A revised 
multivariate stratified cox model including the key prognostic factors as well as the baseline 
covariates where imbalances between arms have been observed will be added : performanc e 
status (0 vs. 1 or 2), presence of bone lesions only at baseline (yes vs. no), number of organs 
involved (1 vs. 2 vs. >=3), prior chemotherapy  use (y es vs. no), age (<65 years vs. >=65 years 
old) and Race (Caucasian vs. non-caucasian). The strata will bebased on stratification 
information obtained through IRT. 
Survival status, reason for censoring and death cause will be listed. Patients not known to 
have died will be censored for ‘Lost to follow -up’ if the time between their last contact date 
and the analysis cut -off date is longer than 3 months and 2 weeks (104 days).
95% confidence intervals for the median, hazard ratio and survival probabilities of the overall 
survival will be also provided as supportive anal ysis.
Overall response rate (ORR)
Overall response rate (ORR) is defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response 
of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) according to RECIST 1.1 ( Appendix 1). 
ORR will be calculated based onthe FAS according to the ITT principle, using local 
radiologist’s/investigator’s tumor assessment. Patients with bone lesions only at baseline will 
be included in the numerator if they achieve a complete response. ORR estimates will be 
presented by treatm ent group along with exact 90% confidence intervals (Clopper a nd 
Pearson 1934 ). The estimation procedure will be repeated based on data for a subset of 
patients in the FAS with measurable disease onl y at baseline.
Clinical benefit rate (CBR)
Clinical benefit rate (CBR) is defined as the proportion of patients with best overall response 
of CR, PR,or overall lesion response of stable disease (SD for measurable disease andnon-
CR/non -PD(NCRNPD) for non-m easurable disease ) with duration of 24 weeks or longer. A 
patient will be considered to have a SD/NCRNPD for 24 weeks or longer if SD/NCRNPD is 
recorded at 24 weeks or later after randomization. Taking into account the allowed time 
window for tumor assessm ent visits, the SD/NCRNPD response has to be recorded at 23 
weeks or later after randomization to be included in the CBR calculation. Best overall 
Novartis Confidential Page 25
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
response of CR, PR and overall lesion response of SD/NCRNPD are defined according to 
RECI ST 1.1 (see Appendix 1). CBR will be calculated based on the FAS according to the ITT 
principle, using local radiologist’s/investigator’s tumor assessment. Patients with non-
measurable disease only at baseline will be included in the numerator if they achieve a 
complete respo nse. CBR estimates will be presented by  treatment group along with exact 90% 
confidence intervals.
ECOG performance status
ECOG performance status (PS) scale will be used to assess physical health of patients, 
ranging from 0 (most active) to 5 (least activ e):
Table 3 -1 ECOG Performance Status Scale
Score Description
0 Fully active, able to carry on all pre -disease performance without restriction
1 Restricted in phy sically  strenuous activity but ambulatory and able to carry out 
work of a light or sedentar ynature, e.g., light house work, office work
2 Ambulator y and capable of all self -care but unable to carry out any work 
activities. Up and about more than  50% of waking hours
3 Capable of only limited self -care, confined to bed or chair more than 50% of
waking hours
4 Completely disabled. Cannot carry on any self -care. Totally confined to bed or 
chair
5 Dead
ECOG performance status will be assessed and recorded at baseline , on Treatment Day 1,at 
week 6 and every  6 w eeks thereafter as well as at discontinuation from the study  treatment 
(within one week after discontinuation). If patients discontinue study  treatment for any reason 
other than progression, lost to follow -upor consent withdrawal, the ECOG performance status 
will continue to be perfor med every  6 weeks until progression, lost to follow -up, consent 
withdrawal or investigator decision in patient best interest.
Time windows will be defined for summar iesof ECOG data. If more than one assessment is 
available in the same time window, the assessment closest to the planned date will be 
considered. If two assessments are obtained with the same time difference compared to the 
scheduled visit day, the assessment with the worst value will be considered . Data obtained at 
the end of treatment will beclassified as other assessment in the corresponding time window. 
Note that only  data collected under treatment (i.e. while the patient is treated and up to 7 days 
after last dose intake ) will be included in the time to deterioration analy sis. Post-treatme nt 
data will be summarized separatel y. The end of treatment assessment will be included if 
collected within 7days of the last dose intake.

Frequencies of patients with ECOG PS values of 0, 1 or >=2 will be used to summarize the
ECOG PS data at each time window. .
An analy sis of the time to definitive deterioration of the ECOG PS by at least one category  of 
the score from baseline will be performed. A deterioration will beconsidered definitive if no 
improvements in the ECOG PS are observed at subsequent measurement times during the 
treatment period following the time point at which the deterioration is observed. (Example 1: 
if the score is 1 at baseline and then 1, 2, 1, 2, 3 at study  days 28, 57, 83, 115, 150, 
respectivel y, then the time to definitive worsening is 115 days.Example 2: if the score is 1 at 
baseline and then 1, 1, 2 at study  days 28, 57, 83, respectivel y, with no assessment of the 
ECOG performance status after day  83,then the time to definitive worsening is 83 day s.)
Death will be considered as worse ning of the ECOG PS if it occurs close to the last available 
assessment where “close” is defined as being within twice the planned period between two 
assessments. Patients who die after more than twice the planned period between two 
assessments will be censored at the date of their last assessment before the cut-off.This 
avoids overestimating the time to definitive worsening in patients dying after an irregular 
assessment scheme. For example, if the last assessment is at week 6 and the patient dies at
week 16, the definitive deterioration date will be week 16. On the other hand, if the last 
assessment is at week 6 and the patient dies atweek 22, which is after more than twice the 
planned period between two assessments (6 weeks) since the last assessment ( at week 6), then 
the patient is censored for definitive deterioration and the censoring date will be week 
6.Patients receiving any further anti-neoplastic therap y prior to definitive worsening will be 
censored at their date of last assessment prior to the start of therapy . Patients that have not 
worsened at the data cut-off point will be censored at the date of last assessment prior to the 
cutoff.
The Kaplan -Meier estimation method will be used to assess the distribution of time to 
definitive worsening in the ECOG PS score, stratified by treatment. The estimated treatment -
specific median times to definitive worsening will be presented along with 90% confidence 
intervals. The stratified Cox regression model will be used to estimate the hazard ratio of a 
defini tive worsening in the ECOG PS score , along with the associated 90% confidence 
interval, comparing the everolimus + exemestane combination therap y with everolimus alone 
and comparing the everolimus + exemestane combination therap y with the capecitabine 
therapy.

Patient reported outcomes (PRO)
The FAS will be used for all PRO summaries and listings.
Quality  of life questionnaire (QLQ)
The EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire along with the breast module (BR23) will be used to 
collect patients’ qualit y of life (QoL ) data. Raw QoL data will be scored according to the 
EORTC scoring manual. If at least half of the items comprising the scale have been answered, 
the score for this scale will be calculated.  For single item scales with missing responses and 
scales where less than half of the items have been answered, the score for these scales will be 
set to missing. The global health status/QoL scale score is identified as the primary  QoL 
variable of interest. Physical functioning, emotional functioning and social functi oning scale 
scores in QLQ -C30, and functional and symptom scale scores in BR23 are identified as 
secondary  QoL variables of interest.
QLQ -C30 and BR23 will be assessed and recorded at baseline, on Treatment Day  1, at week 6 
and every  6 weeks thereafter as well as at discontinuation from the study  treatment (within 
one week after discontinuation). If patients discontinue study  treatment for any reason other 
than progression, lost to follow -up or consent withdrawal, the QLQ -C30 and BR23
performance status andwill continue to be performed every  6 weeks until progression, lost to 
follow -up,consent withdrawal or investigator decision in patient best interest.
Time windows will be defined for descriptive summaries of PRO data. If more than one 
assessment is available in the same time window, the assessment closest to the planned date 
will be considered. If two assessments are obtained with the same time difference compared 
to the scheduled visit day, the assessment obtained prior to scheduled visit day will be 
considered. Data obtained at the end of treatment will be classified as other assessment in the 
corresponding time window. Note that only data collected under treatment (i.e. while the 
patient is treated and up to 7 days after last dose intake ) will be inclu ded in the time to 
deterioration analysis. Post-treatment data will be summarized separately . The end of 
treatment assessment will be included if collected within 7 day s of the last dose intake.

The number of patients filling QoL data and the number of patients missing/expected to have 
QoL assessments will be summarized by each treatment group for scheduled assessment time 
points. Furthermore, the amount and the pattern of missing data will be explored by treatment 
group and over time. The following categories will be used to describe whether the 
questionnaire was completed at a specific time point:
-yes, full y completed
-yes, part ially completed
-no, patient (or subject) missed scheduled assessment visit
- no, patient refused due to poor health
-no, patient (or subject) refused (unrelated to health) -no, study  staff felt patient was too ill
- no, questionnaire not available
-no, institutional error
-no, other
Other exploratory  analyses may be performed to better understand the missing ness pattern for 
QoL data.
Descriptive statistics (count, mean, median, standard deviation, first and third quartile) will be 
used to summarize domains at each scheduled assessment time. Patients will be included if 
they completed at least one questionnaire item. Additionally , change from baseline in the 
scale scores at the time of each assessment will be summarized . Patients with an evaluable 
baseline score and at least one evaluable post-baseline score during the treatment period will 
be included in the change from baseline analysis.
Time to definitive 10% deterioration in the global health status / QoL score , and in each of the 
three secondary  scales, will be examined for the three treatment arms. In addition, time to 
definitive 5-point and 10-point deterioration in the global health status / QoL score will be 
explored for each treatment arm. The assessed distributions will be presented descriptivel y 
using Kaplan -Meier curves. Summary  statistics based on Kaplan -Meier distributions will be 
presented, including the estimated medi an time to definitive 10% (5-, 10- point) deterioration 
and the probability  of not experiencing definitive 10% (5-, 10- point) deterioration by 12 and 
24 weeks. Both point estimates and 90% confidence intervals will be presented .
Definitive 10% (5-or 10-poi nt) deterioration is defined as a decrease in score by at least 10% 
(5or 10points) compared to baseline, with no later increase above this threshold observed 
during the course of the study . Baseline is defined as the latest available assessment made on 
or before the date of randomization when patient can still deteriorate. Time to definitive 
deterioration is the number of days between the date of randomization and the date of the 
assessment at which definitive deterioration is seen.
Death will be considered as deterioration of symptoms/QoL  if it occurs close to the last 
available assessment where “close” is defined as twice the planned period between two 
assessments. This avoids overestimating the time to definitive worsening in patients dying 
after an irregular assessment scheme. Patients who die after more than twice the planned

period between two assessments since the last assessment will be censored at the date of their 
last available questionnaire.
Patients receiving any further anti-neoplastic therap y before definitive worsening will be 
censored at the date of their last assessment before starting this therapy . Patients that have not 
worsened as of the cut-off date for the analysis will be censored at the date of their last 
assessment (question naire) before the cut- off.
Treatment satisfaction questionnaire for medication (TSQM)
Patients’ self- reported satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the study treatment will be measured 
using the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication (TSQM) ver sion 1.4. TSQM is 
planned to be administered at week 3, 6, 12, and the end-of-treatment (EOT) visit. The 
questionnaire will be administered in the patients’ local language .
TSQM items will be divided into four scales: side effects, effectiveness, convenien ce, and 
global satisfaction. Raw TSQM data will be scored according to the scoring manual .Only 
scale scores with not more than one missing item will be computed.
The following time-based interv als will be used to group TSQM data over time. Day x is 
define d as date ofTSQM administration –randomization date + 1.If more than one 
assessment is available in the same time window, the assessment closest to the planned date 
will be considered. If two assessments are obtained with the same time difference compar ed 
to the scheduled visit day, the assessment obtained prior to scheduled visit day will be 
considered.

assessment time point (week 3, week 6, week 12, and EOT). Differences in mean scale scores 
at weeks 3 and 12, and differences in mean change in scale scores between weeks 3 and 12 
along with 90% confidence intervals comparing treatment satisfaction with everolimus + 
exemestane versus everolimus alone, and everolimus + exemestane versus capecitabine will 
be reported (no significance testing will be performed). The normal approximation will be 
used in the computation of confidence intervals.

3.9 Safet y evaluation
For all safety  analyses, the safet y set will be used. The assessment of safety  will be based 
mainly  on the frequency of adverse events and on the number of laboratory  values that fall 
outside of pre -determined ranges. 
The overall observation period will be divided into three mutually  exclusive segments:
pre-treatment period: from day  of patient’s informed consent to the day  before first 
dose of study  treatment
on-treatment period: from day  of first dose of study  medication to 30days after last 
dose of study  treatment
post-treatment period: starting on da y 31 after last dose of study treatment .
Safety  summary  tables will only  include on -treatment events/assessments, i.e. ,those collected 
no later than 30 days after the date of the last study  treatment administration. All safet y 
events/assessments will be listed and those collected in the pre -and post -treatment period will 
be flagged.

Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
3.9.1 Adverse events (AEs)
3.9.1.1 Coding of AEs
Adverse events are coded using the Medical Dictionary  for Regula tory Activities (MedDRA) 
terminology .
3.9.1.2 Grading of A Es
AEs will be graded according to the Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) version 4.03.
The CTCAE represents a comprehensive grading system for reporting the acute and late 
effects of cancer treatments. CTCAE v4.03 grading is by definition a 5-point scale generall y 
corresponding to mild, moderate, severe, life threatening, and death. This grading system 
inherently  places a value on the importance of an event, although there is not necessa rily 
proportionality  among grades (a grade 2 AE is not necessaril y twice as severe as a grade 1
AE).
If CTCAE grading does not exist for an adverse event, grades 1 – 4 corresponding to the 
severit y of mild, moderate, severe, and life-threatening will be used. CTCAE grade 5 (death) 
will not be used in this study ; rather, this information will be collected on the “End of 
Treatment”, “Study  Evaluation Completion ” or “Survival I nformation” eCRF pages.
3.9.1.3 General rules for A E Reporting
AE summaries will include all AEs starting on or after study  day 1 (i.e.,on or after the day of 
the first intake of study  treatment) and starting no later than 30days after the last 
treatment/exposure date. All AEs will be listed. AEs starting prior to study  day 1  and AEs 
starting l ater than 30 days after the last treatment/exposure date will be flagged in the listings.
AEs will be summarized by presenting the number and percentage of patients having at least 
one AE, and having at least one AE in each body  system/primary  system organ class 
(SOC_TXT), and for each preferred term (PT_TXT) using MedDRA coding. A subject with 
multiple occurrences of an AE will be counted only  once in the AE category .
Separate AE summaries will be presented by primary  system organ class, preferred term, and 
maximum CTC grade (AEVGRD1C). A patient with multiple CTC grades for an AE will be 
summarized under the maximum CTC grade recorded for the event. In the summaries 
presented b y grade, all AEs will be pooled regardless of whether they  are CTC gradable or n ot, 
i.e.,regardless of whether the question “CTC AE” (variable CTIAEV1C) on the Adverse 
Events eCRF is answered ‘Yes’ or ‘No’.
The frequency  of CTC grade 3 and 4 AEs will be summarized separatel y.
Any information collected (e.g. ,CTC grades, relatedness t o study  drug, action taken ,etc.) will 
be listed as appropriate.
3.9.1.4 AE summaries
The following adverse event summaries will be produced:
Novartis Confidential Page 33
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
Adverse events, regardless of study  drug relationship by  primary  system organ class and 
preferred term
Adverse events with suspected relationship to study  drug by  primary  system organ class, 
preferred term
Adverse events with an overall incidence rate of 5% or more in either treatment arm, 
regardless of study  drug relationship by  primary  system organ class and preferred term 
Adverse events, regardless of study  drug relationship by  primary  system organ class, 
preferred term and maximum CTC
Adverse events with suspected stud y drug relationship by primary s ystem organ class, 
preferred term and maximum CTC
CTC grade 3 or 4 advers e events, regardless of study  drug relationship by  primary  system 
organ class and preferred term
CTC grade 3 or 4 adverse events with suspected study  drug relationship by primary  
system organ class and preferred term
Deaths, b y primar y system organ class a nd preferred term
On-treatment deaths, b y primary  system organ class and preferred term
Serious adverse events, regardless of stud y drug relationship, by  primary  system organ 
class and preferred term
Serious adverse events with suspected study drug relatio nship, by  primary  system organ 
class and preferred term
Adverse events leading to study  drug discontinuation, regardless of study  drug 
relationship, by  primary  system organ class and preferred term
Adverse events requiring dose adjustment or study -drug interruption, regardless of study  
drug relationship, by  primary  system organ class and preferred term
Adverse events requiring additional therap y, regardless of study drug relationship, by 
primary  system organ class and preferred term
All grade 3/4 non -hematological adverse events
3.9.1.5 AEs of special interest (A ESIs)
Specific groupings of adverse events (AESIs) will be considered and the number of patients 
with at least one event in each grouping will be reported for the entire population . Such 
groups consist ofadverse events for which there is a specific clinical interest in connection 
with RAD001 treatment (i.e. where RAD001 may influence a common mechanism of action 
responsible for triggering them) or adverse events which are similar in nature (although not 
identical). The latest version of Case Retrieval Strategy  (CRS) sheet should be used.
3.9.1.6 Clinical trial safet ydisclosure
For the legal requirements of ClinicalTrials.gov and EudraCT, two required tables on on-
treatment adverse events which are not serious adverse events with an incidence greater than 5% 
and on on- treatment serious adverse events and SAE suspected to be related to study 
treatment will be provided by system organ class and preferred term on the safety  set 
population.
Novartis Confidential Page 34
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
If for a same patient, several consecutive AEs (irrespective of study  treatment causalit y, 
seriousness and severit y) occurred with the same SOC and PT:
a single occurrence will be counted if there is ≤ 1 day  gap between the end date of the 
preceding AE and the start date of the consecutive AE
more than one occurrence will be counted if there is > 1 day gap between the end date 
of the preceding AE and the start date of the consecutive AE
For occurrence, the presence of at least one SAE / SAE suspected to be related to study 
treatment / non SAE has to be checked in a block e.g., among AE's in a ≤ 1 day gap block, if 
at least one SAE is occurring, then one occurrence is calculated for that SAE.
The number of deaths resulting from SAEs suspected to be related to study  treatment and 
SAEs irrespective of study treatment relationship will be provided by SOC and PT.
3.9.2 Laboratory  data
All laboratory  values will be converted into SI units and the severit y grade calculated using 
appropriate common toxicity  criteria (CTCAE).
A listing of labora tory values will be provided by  laboratory  parameter, patient, and treatment 
group. A separate listing will display  notable laboratory  abnormalities (i.e., newl y occurrin g 
CTCAE grade 3 or 4 laboratory  toxicities). The frequency  of laboratory  abnormalities will be 
display ed by parameter and treatment group.
Laboratory  datasummaries will include all laboratory  assessments collected no later than 30
days after the last treatment/exposure date. All laboratory  assessments will be listed and those 
collected later than 30days after the last treatment/exposure date will be flagged in the 
listings.
Laboratory  data will be classified (by Novartis biostatistics/SAS programming) into CTC 
grades according to the NCI Common Terminology  Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCA E) 
v4.03. A severit y grade of 0 will be assigned when the value is within normal limits. In the 
case when a local laboratory normal range overlaps into the higher (i.e. ,non-zero) CTC grade, 
the laboratory  value will still be taken as within normal limits and assigned a CTC grade of 
zero.
The following rules will be applied: 
Conflict between normal range and grade definition: because many institutions have 
differences for normal ranges of metabolic laboratory  and hematology  values, the CTCAE 
often uses theterms 'Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)' and 'Lower Limit of Normal (LLN)' 
in lieu of actual numerical values. In some cases, an institution's LLN might be bey ond the 
range specified for a grade. In this case, the institutional limits of normal should take 
precedence over the CTCAE values: the laboratory  value will still be taken as within 
normal limits and assigned a CTC grade of zero.
For the few parameters having comparison to baseline in CTCAE grading definition 
(Fibrinogen, INR, Hemoglobin, Creatinine), the highest grade will be retained. In other 
words, in the particular case when a value is grade x as per CTC grade definition based on 
threshold/ranges and also grade x+1 when comparing to baseline, grade x+1 is retained. 
Novartis Confidential Page 35
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
Grade 5 will not be used. Grade values will be integers from -4 to 4.
For calcium, CTCAE grading is based on Corrected Calcium and not on Calcium. 
Corrected Calcium (CALC) will be calculated from Albumin and Calcium : Corrected 
Calcium (mg/dL) = Calcium (mg/dL) –0.8 [Albumin (g/dL)- 4].
GFR will be calculated based on creatinine (CREA parameter) collected regularl y during 
treatment and the CTC grade will be determined for GFR.
For creatinine clearance (CRCL CG parameter), no calculation of CTC grade will be done.
The following summari es will be produced for the laboratory  data (by laboratory  parameter
and treatment ):
Number and percentage of patients with worst post- baseline CTC grade (regardless of 
the baseline status). Each patient will be counted only  for the worst grade observed 
post-baseline.
Shift tables using CTC grades to compare baseline to the worst post -baseline value 
will be produced for hematology  and biochemistry laboratory  parameters with CTC 
grades.
For laboratory  parameters where CTC grades are not defined, shift tables to the worst 
post-baseline value will be produced using the low/normal/high classifications based 
on laboratory  reference ranges.
The following listings will be produced for the laboratory  data:
Listing of patients with laboratory  values outside the labor atory  reference ranges with 
values flagged to show the corresponding CTC grades and the classifications relative to 
the laboratory  reference ranges. 
Listing of all laboratory  data with values flagged to show the corresponding CTC grades 
and the classifica tions relative to the laboratory  reference r anges.
3.9.3 Vital signs
Vital sign assessments will beperformed in order to characterize basic body  function. The 
parameters expected to be collected include : height (cm), weight (kg), body  temperature (°C), 
pulse rate (beats per minute), sy stolic and diastolic blood pressure (mmHg).
The criteria for clinically notable abnormalities are defined as follows:
Clinically  notable elevated values
systolic BP: ≥ 180 mmHg and an increase ≥ 20 mmHg from baseline
diastolic BP: ≥ 105 mmHg and an increase ≥ 15 mmHg from baseline
body  temperature: ≥ 39.1°C
weight: increase from baseline of ≥ 10%
pulse rate: ≥ 120 bpm with increase from baseline ≥ 15 bpm
Clinically  notable below  normal values
systolic BP: ≤ 90 mmHg and a decrease ≥ 20 mmHg from baseline
diastolic BP: ≤ 50 mmHg and a decrease ≥ 15 mmHg from baseline
Novartis Confidential Page 36
Y2201 RAP Module 3 (SAP) –Addendum1 CRAD001Y2201
body  temperature: ≤ 35°C
weight: decrease from baseline of ≥ 10%
pulse rate: ≤ 50 bpm with decrease from baseline ≥ 15 bpm.
The following summaries will be produced for ea ch vital sign parameter:
summary  statistics for change from baseline to the worst post -baseline value (in both 
directions, i.e., from baseline to the highest post- baseline and from baseline to the lowest 
post-baseline value)
number and percentage of patien ts with at least one post -baseline vital sign abnormality  
(in both directions, i.e., both elevated and below normal values).
In addition, the following two listings will be produced b y treatment group:
patients with clinically  notable vital sign abnormalit ies
all vital sign assessments will be listed by  patient and vital sign parameter.
In both listings, the clinically  notable values will be flagged and also the assessments 
collected later than 30 days after the last treatment/exposure date will be flagged.
3.9.4 Other safety  data
Data from other tests (e.g. ,electrocardiogram, pulmonary  function tests, LVEF) will be listed, 
notable values will be flagged, and any other information collected will be listed as 
appropriate.
All assessments collected later than 30 days after the last treatment/exposure date will be 
flagged in the listings.
Any statistical tests performed to explore the data will be used only  to identify  any interesting

3.11 Interim analy sis
One efficacy  interim analy sis of PFS was conducted toallow early termination of the
everolimus monotherap y arm, in case of far inferior efficacy  as compared to the everolimus +
exemestane combination treatment arm. The efficacy  interim analy sis was planned after 75 
PFS events have been observed as per local tumor assessment, across the following 2 arms: 
everolimus monotherap y and everolimus + exemestane combination arm.
Based on simulations, the probability  of stopping the everolimus monotherap y arm was 
calculated.

A general guidance wasto stop the single agent arm if the observed hazard ratio wasless than 
0.20, (i.e., if the everolimus monotherapy  arm was far inferior when compared to the 
everolimus + exemestane combination arm). The proposed decision guidance yieldedhigh 
probability  to stop the control arm if the combination arm is highly  superior (HR≤0.1), while 
keep ingthe probabilit y low if the superiorit y wasnot so extreme (HR ≥0.3). 
At the time of interim analysis, the observed hazard ratio along with the 90% confidence 
interval wasprovided for decision making. Simulation (L.J. Wei, 2007) was also carried out to 
predict the hazard ratio and 90% confidence interval at the final analysis, based on the data 
observed at interim. 
The predicted hazard ratios and 90% confidence interv als were provided by the independent 
statistician to independent programmer as per following process:
Trial statistician create dR program that was used to calculate predicted hazard ratios 
and 90% confidence intervals and put this program into GPS under source control in 
the unrestricted area.
Independent statistician import edthis R program in the restricted area, put it under 
source control and usedit to produce a csv file in the restricted area containing the 
predicted hazard ratios and 90% confidence intervals.
Independent programmer usedthe csv file created by independent statistician to 
produce outputs display ing the predicted hazard ratios and 90% confidence intervals.
Based on the interim analy sis results and DMC recommendation, the study continues without
change .

3.12 Sample size calculation
The primary  objective of this study  is to estimate the hazard ratio of PFS comparing 
everolimus + exemestane versus everolimus alone with approximately  150 PFS events. For 
this number of PFS events, the precision of HR estimation is illustrated by tabulating the 
approximate 90% confidence intervals ( Jennison and Turnbull 1999 ) for the hazard ratio (HR) 
(see Table 3-3) under different point est imates for the HR.

* Jennison and Turnbull (1999)
A total of 300 patients are planned to be recruited at a uniform rate over an 18 -month 
enrollment period and randomized with equal allocation to one of the three treatment arms. 
Assuming the median PFS time to be 7 months in the everolimus + exemestane arm (Baselga 
et al 2012 ), 4 months in the everolimus monotherapy  arm (NCI -Canada), and 6 months in the 
capecitabine arm (O’Shaughness y et al 2012 , Stocker et al 2 007, Jäger et al 2010 , Kaufmann 
et al 2010 , Robert 2011 ), the expected time to observe 150 PFS events in each of the two 
pairwise t reatment comparisons is about 28 months after the randomization date of the first 
patient in the study , assuming that about 10% of the patients will be lost to follow -up or 
withdraw consent.

4.2 Time- to-event analyses
The following sections present a general methodology to beused to analy ze the following 
time-to-event variables:
Progression -free survival
Overall survival
Time to definitive deterioration inthe ECOG score by  one category  of the score from
baseline
Time to definitive 10%  deterioration from baseline in the global health status / QoL  
score of the EORTC QLQ -C30 questionnaire
Time to definitive 5- point deterioration from baseline in the global health status / QoL  
score of the EORTC Q LQ-C30 questionnaire
Time to definitive 10- point deterioration from baseline in the global health status / 
QoL score of the EORTC QL Q-C30 questionnaire
Time to definitive 10% deterioration from baseline in each of the three secondary  
scales (ph ysical functioning, emotional functioning, and social functioning) of the 
EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire
4.2.1 Analysis of time -to-event data with ties
The STRATA statement inthe SAS LIFETEST procedure will be used to analyze time-to-
event data with ties.The SAS PHREG proced ure with option TIES=EXACT will be used to 
fit the Cox proportional hazards model .
4.2.2 Kaplan- Meier survival function estimat ion
The survival function in each treatment group will be estimated using the Kaplan -Meier
(product -limit) method as implemented in PRO C LIFETEST (see Figure 4-2 below ). In each 
treatment group, the estimated median PFS time,along with the approximate 90% confidence 
interval ,will be obtained from thePROC LIFETEST output .The log-log transformation 
option available within PROC LIFETEST will be used to compute the confidence intervals. 
The Kaplan -Meier graphs will be obtained from the SAS software. The hazard ratio point and 
interval estimates will be display ed in the figure s.
4.2.3 Hazard ratio estimation
The hazard ratio as ameasure oftreatment effect will be derived from the Cox proportional
hazards model using SAS procedure PHREG with TIES=EXACT option in the MODEL
statement. The stratified unadjusted Cox model will be used (where the baseline hazard
function is allowed to vary across strata) for the primary  and key secondary  analyses, i.e.,the 
MODEL  statement will include the indicator of assignment to the everolimus + exemestane 
arm as the only covariate, and the STRATA statement will include the stratification variable 
obtained through IRT.

/* survtime represents variable containing event/censor ingtimes;
censor represents censoring variable (1 =censored, 0 =event);
trtrepresents treatment group variable;
stratum1 to stratumk represent stratification variables */
The two-sided 90% asymptotic confidence interval for the hazard ratio will be based on the 
Wald test .
4.3 Median follow -up of the study
Median study  follow -up (in months ) in this study  will be calculated as 
([analy sis cut-off date] -[median randomization date] + 1)/30.4375, where 30.4375 is the 
average duration of a month in days: 365.25/12 ≈ 30.4375.
The median randomization date is obtained by first sorting all patients in the FAS by the 
randomization dates, respectivel y, and then taking the date of the median patient (i.e.,the 
patient in the middle of the sorted list in case of an odd number of patients or the average 
between the two patients in the middle of the sorted list in case of an even number of patients).
The time from last contact date to data cut-off date will be summ arized by time intervals in 
increments of 6 weeks.
The number of patients at risk of death and the number of deaths in intervals of time with 
increments of 6 weeks will be summarized during the course of the trial using the life table 
method. The Kaplan -Meier estimates of survival probabilities and associated standard errors 
will be provided.

Time to the first moderate or severe COPD 
exacerbation
Work Productivity and Activity Impairment - General 
Health (WPAI-GH)
Target patient population
Patients, 40-95 years of age, with moderate to very severe COPD.
Duration of treatment
Patients will be treated for 24 weeks.
Investigational product, dosage and mode of administration
Each patient will undergo a screening period of 1 to 4 weeks (-28 to -9 days).  During the 
screening period, patients will be provided with ipratropium bromide MDI 2 inhalations QDS 
as COPD maintenance therapy. Albuterol/salbutamol MDI will be provided as rescue 
medication during the screening period and throughout the study. 
Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 scheme. Approximately 500 patients will be randomised 
to the GFF and UV treatment groups, respectively. Patients will be stratified based on 
incoming COPD treatment at screening; rescue/maintenance monotherapy (LAMA, LABA or ICS only) vs. double maintenance therapy (LABA/LAMA or ICS/LABA). 
The first dose of IP will be taken at Visit 3 (Day 1). During the 24 week double-blind 
treatment period, patients will take two inhalations in the morning and in the evening from the GFF inhaler (active or placebo) and one inhalation in the morning from the UV inhaler (active 
or placebo). 
Statistical methods
The co-primary non-inferiority analyses will be conducted using the Per Protocol analysis set. 
Data following important protocol deviations which may affect efficacy or from visits where 
patients do not comply with required restrictions will be excluded from this analysis.

Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
9 (129)Supportive analyses and superiority testing will be conducted in the full analysis set of all 
patients randomised and dosed, using all data obtained while on treatment.
The co-primary endpoints of change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV 1and peak 
change from baseline in FEV 1within 2 hours post-dosing will be analysed separately using a 
linear mixed effects repeated measures approach. The models will include baseline FEV 1and 
bronchodilator responsiveness as continuous covariates and stratification factors (prior treatment - rescue/maintenance monotherapy vs double maintenance therapy), region, visit, treatment, and treatment by visit, as categorical covariates. Patient will be considered a random effect. 
The co-primary analyses will be based upon an estimate of the treatment difference over the 
entire 24-week treatment period, along with two-sided 95% and 97.5% confidence intervals. For both endpoints, non-inferiority will be concluded using a 1-sided hypothesis test according to a significance level of either 1.25% or 2.5% based upon the hierarchical testing and recycling procedure. This is equivalent to the lower bound of the 95% or 97.5% 2-sided confidence interval being greater than the pre-specified margin of -50 mL. For peak FEV
1, a 
similar model will then be used for the formal assessment of the superiority hypothesis in the full analysis set. 1-sided p-values will be produced accordingly for all non-inferiority and superiority hypothesis testing.
The secondary endpoints of peak change from baseline in IC within 2 hours post-dosing, TDI 
focal score and EMSCI symptom severity score will be analysed using a similar repeated measures model to the co-primary endpoints, including appropriate baselines in the model. Peak IC will be referred to a non-inferiority margin of -50mL, while TDI and EMSCI will be referred to non-inferiority margins of -1.0 units and -0.1 units respectively.
In order to strongly control the 1-sided type I error rate at 2.5% across all co-primary endpoint 
hypothesis tests and the non-inferiority hypothesis tests of the secondary endpoints, a 
hierarchical testing procedure with recycling will be defined. 
To account for the multiplicity of the two co-primary endpoints, the test mass (1 sided alpha 
of 2.5%) will initially be split equally between the tests of the non-inferiority null hypothesis 
for each of trough FEV
1and peak FEV 1(1-sided alpha of 1.25% each). Should either of these 
null hypotheses be rejected, the test mass will be recycled. As such, respective hypothesis tests 
will be conducted at either a 1-sided 1.25% or 2.5% significance level depending upon this 
recycling. The superiority of peak FEV 1 is only tested once non-inferiority of peak FEV 1is 
achieved. Should all three null hypotheses relating to the co-primary endpoints be rejected 
then testing will proceed to the secondary endpoints using a 1-sided 2.5% significance level.
If non-inferiority is demonstrated for a secondary endpoint in the per protocol analysis set, 
then testing may proceed to the next endpoint in the hierarchy, and a superiority test of the 
endpoint will also be conducted in the full analysis set where relevant. 
An exception to this sequential non-inferiority/superiority testing procedure is the secondary 
endpoint of onset of action (proportion of patients with increase in FEV 1 of ≥100 ml from

10 (129)baseline at 5 minutes on day 1). For this endpoint superiority testing will immediately be 
carried out using logistic regression without any prior non-inferiority testing.
Rescue medication use, CAT, NiSCI and other spirometry and symptom sub-scale endpoints 
will also be analysed using mixed effects repeated measures models.
Adverse events (AEs) and exploratory endpoints will be reported descriptively.
Approximately 500 patients per arm are to be randomised and it is expected that around 440 
patients per arm will be included in the Per Protocol Analysis Set for the co-primary analyses. This sample size will provide around 94% power to demonstrate that the difference between 
GFF and UV in change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV
1over 24 weeks is 
greater than the non-inferiority margin of - 50 mL, using a one-sided significance level of 
2.5% and assuming an effective standard deviation of 167mL and a true difference of -10 mL. 
Should testing be conducted at a one-sided significance level of 1.25% then the power would 
be 90%. 
For the co-primary endpoint of peak FEV 1over 24 weeks the power to show non-inferiority is 
expected to be at least that of trough FEV 1. Assuming an effective SD of 188mL for peak 
FEV 1, and a true difference of 50mL then 500 patients would provide at least 97% power to 
demonstrate superiority of GFF to UV in peak FEV 1with a one-sided significance level of 
1.25%.

20 (129)1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background and rationale for conducting this study
Long-acting bronchodilators are central to the pharmacological management of chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) ( GOLD 2017 ). However, many patients remain 
symptomatic despite the availability of effective long-acting monotherapies. In a real-world 
study ( Dransfield et al 2011 ), patients receiving tiotropium, formoterol, or salmeterol as long-
acting bronchodilator maintenance therapy continued to report dyspnea and high levels of 
supplemental rescue medication use, irrespective of the level of airflow limitation.
Glycopyrronium (GP) is a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA) which exerts its 
bronchodilatory effect via muscarinic receptors located on smooth muscle cells within the 
trachea and bronchi. GP is approved in many countries in multiple formulations for different 
indications, including for the treatment of COPD.
Formoterol fumarate (FF) is a selective long-acting β2-agonist (LABA) approved worldwide 
for use in COPD. In addition, FF is also approved worldwide in combination with inhaled 
corticosteroids (ICS) such as budesonide (e.g., Symbicort®MDI, Symbicort®Turbuhaler®
(TBH [AstraZeneca, LP]) for use in patients with asthma and COPD. When inhaled, FF acts 
locally in the lung as a bronchodilator. FF stimulates β2-adrenoreceptors in the airways, 
inducing airway smooth muscle relaxation and reducing or preventing bronchoconstriction. 
Dual long-acting bronchodilator therapy represents an alternative to long-acting 
bronchodilator monotherapy ( Cazzola et al 2010 ). Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate 
(GFF) is a fixed-dose combination of GP and FF in a metered dose inhaler (MDI). It is approved in the USA for maintenance treatment of COPD (at a dose of 7.2/4.8 μg two 
inhalations twice daily ( Bevespi Aerosphere™ prescribing information, 2016. ). Dual 
bronchodilation with GFF has been shown to provide greater improvements in lung function than GP or FF alone, with similar or greater improvements in measures of dyspnea, rescue 
medication use, and health-related quality of life ( Martinez et al 2016 ). However, a direct 
comparison between GFF and other inhaled LAMA/LABA combinations has not been performed 
Umeclidinium/Vilanterol (UV) is a fixed-dose combination of the LAMA umeclidinium and 
the LABA vilanterol, which is approved in many countries for the treatment of COPD. UV is a dry powder inhaler (DPI) prescribed at a dose of 62.5 μg/25 μg once daily ( Anoro™ 
Ellipta™ prescribing information, 2016. ).
The rationale for a direct comparison between LAMA/LABA combinations is multi-fold. 
There are several LAMA/LABA combinations available, approved at once-daily or twice-
daily dosing regimens ( Duaklir® Genuair® Summary of Product Characteristics 2015 ; 
Anoro™ Ellipta™ prescribing information, 2016. ;Utibron™ Neohaler® prescribing 
information 2016. ;Stiolto® Respimat® prescribing information 2016 ). The mono-components 
of the LAMA/LABA combinations have different pharmacological properties which may

21 (129)have an impact clinically on both lung function and symptoms. The symptomatic impact of 
COPD can vary over the course of the day and night, whereby different dosing regimens and 
differences in treatment effects may be important. It is a well-known fact that many COPD patients find the morning hours particularly burdensome, as they get up and start their day. 
Therefore, effective bronchodilation during the night and fast onset of effect in the morning 
have relevance for this patient group ( Roche et al 2013 ). A direct comparison between two 
LAMA/LABAs will help elucidate the influence of their different dosing regimens and 
pharmacological properties on the treatment effects and evaluate the importance of these 
differences for patients’ lung function, symptoms and health-related quality of life.
This study will compare the efficacy of GFF to UV in patients with moderate to very severe 
COPD.
1.2 Rationale for study design, doses and control groups
This is a randomised, double-blind, active controlled, parallel group study of 24 weeks 
duration in patients with moderate to very severe COPD. The study design is commonly used in COPD and is consistent with regulatory guidelines. 24 weeks is sufficient duration to be 
able to observe improvements in airflow obstruction and symptom relief.
As described in Section 1.1, both GFF and UV are approved therapies for COPD in the USA, 
and while UV is already approved in several other major markets, GFF is expected to gain 
similar approvals by the time of completion of this study. Both treatments will be given in 
accordance with their labelled dosing regimens. A direct comparison of these two treatments will support the evidence base for the prescribing of GFF.
This study will recruit patients with moderate to very severe COPD; therefore, spirometry 
entry requirements are set according to the thresholds defined by GOLD grade 2 or above (GOLD 2017 ). These requirements are in line with the inclusion criteria used in the pivotal 
study programmes of both GFF and UV. In addition, patients are required to be symptomatic 
at baseline with a COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score of 10 or above. This threshold is specified in the current guidelines ( GOLD 2017 ) as determining those in need of treatment for 
symptoms of COPD. In patients meeting these criteria, with severe or persistent 
breathlessness, treatment with dual bronchodilator therapy is recommended ( GOLD 2017 ).
Randomisation and blinding minimise any potential for selection bias, or for bias in the 
assessment of study endpoints or the management of patients. This is especially important 
given the patient-reported endpoints collected in this study. As GFF is delivered in a metered dose inhaler (MDI) and UV in a dry powder inhaler (DPI), it is not possible to provide a single 
matched inhaler that could deliver either investigational treatment. Therefore, a double-
dummy design will be used whereby matched placebo versions of each of the MDI and DPI will be used and patients will be randomised to receive one of the active inhalers to be taken 
alongside one of the placebo inhalers. Patients will also continue to use short-acting rescue 
medication when necessary (albuterol/salbutamol MDI inhaler). As the aim of this study is to directly assess the differences in lung function and symptoms attributable to the two 
LAMA/LABA combinations, patients should discontinue from inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) 
Clinical Study Protocol

22 (129)treatment before being randomised. Given that multiple inhalers are involved in study 
treatment, there would also be concerns about treatment complexity and compliance if a 
fourth inhaler were used. Patients who are receiving a stable ICS/LABA combination at screening may enter the study if ICS treatment is withdrawn. The switch to LAMA/LABA 
treatment for these patients, particularly those with lower blood eosinophil counts, is justified 
since recent studies ( Wedzicha et al 2016 ) have demonstrated the benefits of LAMA/LABA 
dual bronchodilation over ICS/LABA combination treatment in terms of reduction in 
exacerbation risk and improvements in lung function and symptoms. 
Patients at high exacerbation risk who experience further exacerbations may need their 
treatment to be escalated (for example to triple therapy including ICS). Patients who 
experience ≥2 moderate exacerbations (requiring antibiotics or ≥3 days of systemic steroids) 
or ≥1 severe exacerbation (leading to hospitalisation) while on study will be withdrawn.
The co-primary endpoints in this study are morning pre-dose trough FEV
1and peak FEV 1
within 2 hours post-dosing. These are recognised measures of pulmonary function and airflow 
obstruction and have been used as primary or secondary endpoints in many regulatory studies in COPD. Trough FEV
1was the primary endpoint in the pivotal studies of both GFF and UV 
(Martinez et al 2016 ; Donohue et al 2013 ). Since trough FEV 1measures lung function at the 
nadir of the effect of the randomised therapies and it is important to consider the entire dosing interval, peak FEV
1is included as a co-primary endpoint at the zenith of the effect. Secondary 
endpoints include recognised and validated measures of dyspnea, COPD symptoms and 
health-related quality of life. These are important factors to patients experiencing COPD in addition to measures of airflow obstruction.
As the comparator is an approved active therapy, the primary aim of the study will initially 
involve establishing the non-inferiority of GFF to UV in improving lung function and symptoms. The potential for superiority over UV in maximum bronchodilation, inspiratory 
capacity (IC), early onset of effects and morning symptom control will then also be assessed. 
No placebo arm is included, but as there is extensive experience of these therapies in terms of the endpoints used (in particular the co-primary endpoints and other spirometry assessments), 
there are no concerns about assay sensitivity in this study. Similar two-arm non-inferiority 
studies have been conducted with other products in COPD, including between dual bronchodilator combinations ( Kalberg et al 2016 ; Buhl et al 2015 ).
The proposed non-inferiority margin of 50mL for trough FEV
1is well established and based 
upon considerable experience in reproducible effects of long acting bronchodilators over placebo. It relates to half of the commonly recognised clinically important difference of 
100mL ( Donohue 2005 ) and has been used in several non-inferiority studies, both of dual and 
single long acting bronchodilators ( Kalberg et al 2016 ; Chapman et al 2014 ; Volgelmeier et al 
2010 ). The same margin will be applied to Peak FEV
1and IC. As the magnitude of changes in 
peak FEV 1with therapy are typically larger than for trough FEV 1, this represents a relatively 
more stringent non-inferiority margin for peak FEV 1.
The non-inferiority margin for TDI is based upon the Minimum Clinically Important 
Difference (MCID) of 1 unit ( Mahler et al 2005 ). Although there is less precedent for formal 
Clinical Study Protocol

Date 14 July 2017
23 (129)non-inferiority testing of TDI, a similar approach to using the MCID as a pre-specified margin 
has been used previously for SGRQ ( Buhl et al 2015 ). There is less clinical experience with 
the use of EMSCI, but a non-inferiority margin of 0.1 units is proposed based upon the difference observed between LAMA/LABA and LAMA only treated patients ( D’Urzo et al 
2014 ). 
1.3 Benefit/risk and ethical assessment
GFF was approved by the US FDA for patients with COPD in April 2016 and launched in the 
US January 2017. Its two mono-components, GP and FF, are used as single therapy or in combination with other inhaled drugs in patients with COPD in many countries worldwide. 
The clinical development program for GFF included 4,602 patients with COPD. Overall, the 
program demonstrated that GFF was effective for long-term maintenance therapy in patients with COPD and provided additional efficacy benefits compared to its mono-components (as 
assessed by measures of lung function, COPD symptoms and disease-specific health status). 
GFF was well tolerated, with a safety profile comparable to the mono-components, and with no unexpected safety observations. Adverse drug reactions with ≥1% incidence were anxiety, 
headache, tremor, dry mouth, nausea, muscle spasms and chest pain. Less common adverse 
drug reactions were hyperglycaemia, agitation, restlessness, sleep disturbance, tachycardia, palpitations, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, extrasystoles, dizziness and 
hypersensitivity. In conclusion, these findings support a favourable benefit-risk profile for 
GFF in the treatment of patients with COPD. 
UV was approved by the US FDA in 2013 and has since then been launched worldwide for 
patients with COPD. Adverse drug reactions with ≥1% incidence reported with UV are 
pharyngitis, sinusitis, lower respiratory tract infection, constipation, diarrhea, pain in extremity, muscle spasms, neck pain and chest pain. Less common adverse drug reactions are 
productive cough, dry mouth, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, gastroesophageal reflux disease, 
vomiting, musculoskeletal chest pain, chest discomfort, asthenia, atrial fibrillation, ventricular extrasystoles, supraventricular extrasystoles, myocardial infarction, pruritus, rash, and 
conjunctivitis. 
During screening, all patients will switch their COPD therapy to ipratropium bromide MDI 
four times daily (QDS) and albuterol/salbutamol MDI as needed (PRN). Although this 
regimen is expected to give adequate symptom relief for most patients, some of them (mainly 
those with previous LAMA/LABA combination treatment) may experience an increase in symptoms.  Patients will be have a faster follow up than what they would experience in 
regular clinical settings and will be reminded to contact their physicians if they have 
significantly worsening symptoms.   During the 24-week treatment period, all patients will be treated with a LAMA/LABA combination, and since patients on incoming triple therapy will 
not be eligible, no patients will be subjected to a step-down in therapy after randomisation 
compared to their regular maintenance therapy. Patients on incoming rescue treatment only or maintenance monotherapy will be eligible only if they are symptomatic (CAT score ≥10) at 
screening, i.e. a step-up in treatment for these patients will be based on clinical judgement and 
will offer a potential for improvement. Both arms will use approved doses and the study population represents the population for which these medications were approved.

24 (129)Based on the safety profile of the investigational products (IPs), no new or specific risks 
beyond what has been described are anticipated with the doses and the dose regimens being 
used in this trial. Investigators will ensure adequate medical care of the study participants at all times throughout the course of the study, and patients will be followed by clinic visits 
every 4-8 weeks.
The study requires documentation of a standard chest x-ray as per local practice (postero-
anterior and lateral projections strongly recommended), or computed tomography (CT) scan 
of the chest/lungs, within 6 months of enrolment to rule out clinically significant 
abnormalities not associated with COPD. The requirement for chest x-ray introduces minimal radiation exposure and is a standard diagnostic test for COPD symptom worsening and 
pneumonia.
1.4 Study Design 
This is a phase IIIb randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, multicentre, parallel group, 24 
week study to assess the efficacy and safety of GFF  7.2/4.8 μg 2 inhalations twice daily (BD) 
compared to UV 62.5/25 μg 1 inhalation once daily (OD) in patients with moderate to very 
severe COPD.
The study will be conducted in approximately 150 sites. Across these sites, it is planned that 
approximately 1400 patients will be screened and 1000 randomised into the study.
Patients will be randomised in a 1:1 scheme. Approximately 500 patients each will be 
randomised to the GFF and UV treatment groups. Patients will be stratified based on incoming COPD treatment at screening: rescue only/maintenance monotherapy (LAMA or LABA or 
ICS only) vs. double maintenance therapy (LABA/LAMA or ICS/LABA). 
The study will evaluate the benefit of GFF compared to UV in patients with moderate to very 
severe COPD. Patients on rescue medication only or maintenance monotherapy will be 
required to be symptomatic (CAT ≥10) at screening (Visit 1), whereas there will be no 
symptom requirement at screening for patients on double maintenance therapy (ICS/LABA or LAMA/LABA). All patients will be required to be symptomatic (CAT ≥10) at randomisation 
(Visit 3). Patients on triple maintenance therapy will not be eligible. A history of 
exacerbations in the previous year will be obtained to characterize the population but will not be included as an entry criterion. COPD severity, defined as post-bronchodilator forced 
expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV
1), must be <80% predicted normal value, calculated 
using the Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) equations ( Quanjer et al 2012 ), and the 
measured FEV 1must also be ≥750 mL if FEV 1less than 30 % of predicted normal value. 
Post-bronchodilator FEV 1(after inhalation of albuterol/salbutamol MDI) will be tested at 
screening (Visit 1 and Visit 2) to determine eligibility and COPD severity. Bronchodilator responsiveness to albuterol/salbutamol MDI will be tested at Visit 2.
Any treatment with ICS, LAMA, LABA and existing rescue medications will be stopped at 
the screening visit. During the screening period, patients will be treated with ipratropium

25 (129)bromide MDI 2 inhalations QDS and albuterol/salbutamol MDI as needed. 
Albuterol/salbutamol MDI will also be used as rescue medication throughout the 24-week 
treatment period.
Baseline assessments: vital signs, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical laboratory testing 
and pregnancy test will be performed to assess patients’ eligibility.
After the Randomisation Visit (Visit 3), patients will be evaluated at Visit 4 (Week 4), Visit 5 
(Week 12), Visit 6 (Week 18) and Visit 7 (Week 24) using spirometry and patient reported 
outcome questionnaires. From Visit 2 onwards, patients will also enter data daily in an 
electronic Patient Reported Outcomes device (ePRO).
For patients who remain on treatment throughout the study (i.e., complete Visit 7), a follow-
up telephone call will be performed approximately 14 days after the last IP dose.  
Patients who discontinue study treatment prior to Week 24 (Visit 7) will complete a Treatment 
Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit. These patients will be placed on appropriate maintenance 
COPD medications, as per the Investigator’s judgement. Consideration should be given to 
maintaining patients on at least double therapy, while ensuring appropriate follow-up and further evaluation of the prescribed treatment. 
A follow-up telephone call will be performed approximately 14 days after the last IP dose. No 
further data will be collected. In the event the Treatment Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit is performed approximately14 days post last IP dosing, a follow-up TC will not be required.

3.3 Patient enrolment and randomisation
The Investigator should keep a record, the Patient Screening Log, of patients who entered pre-
study screening.
The Investigator will:1. Obtain signed informed consent from the patient before any study-specific procedures are 
performed.
2. Assign the patient a unique enrolment number, beginning with ‘E#’ (using the Interactive 
Web Response System [IWRS/IVRS]).
3. Determine patient eligibility (see Section 3.1and 3.2).
4. Randomise the patient using IWRS/IVRS (randomisation code will be blinded).If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomisation 
code cannot be reused. Only the enrolment number will be used for patient identification in 
the eCRF. 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
33 (129)3.4 Procedures for handling incorrectly enrolled or randomised 
patients 
Patients who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not, under any circumstances, be 
enrolled or receive study medication. There can be no exceptions to this rule. Patients who are 
enrolled, but subsequently found not to meet all th e eligibility criteria must not be randomised 
or initiated on treatment and must be withdrawn from the study.
Where a patient does not meet all the eligibility criteria but is randomised in error, or 
incorrectly started on treatment, the Investigator should inform the AstraZeneca study 
physician immediately, and a discussion should occur between the AstraZeneca study physician and the Investigator regarding whether to continue or discontinue the patient from 
treatment. Treatment must be discontinued in all cases where continued treatment is deemed 
to pose a safety risk to the patient. The AstraZeneca study physician must ensure all decisions including the rationale for continuing or discontinuing treatment are appropriately 
documented.
3.5 Methods for assigning treatment groups
The randomisation codes will be computer-generated using the AstraZeneca Global 
Randomisation system (AZRand) and loaded into the IWRS/IVRS database. The randomisation codes will be generated in blocks to ensure approximate balance (1:1) between 
the two treatment groups. Patients will be stratified based on incoming COPD treatment; 
rescue or maintenance monotherapy (LAMA, LABA or ICS only) at screening vs. double maintenance therapy (LABA/LAMA or ICS/LABA).
3.6 Methods for ensuring blinding
Patients, study site personnel, and AZ personnel will not know which medication the patient is receiving.
Since there are two different devices, a double-dummy technique will be applied to ensure the 
double-blinding of the study.  Matched placebo to GFF and UV will be present with the same 
external appearance. There will be no differences between active and placebo formulations with regards to appearance, odour or colour that could unmask the blinded design.  
3.7 Methods for unblinding
Individual treatment codes, indicating the treatment randomisation for each randomised 
patient, will be available to the Investigator or pharmacists from the IWRS/IVRS. Routines for 
this will be described in the IWRS/IVRS user manual that will be provided to each site.
The treatment code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the patient requires knowledge of the treatment randomisation. The 
Investigator documents and reports the action to AstraZeneca, without revealing the treatment given to patient to the AstraZeneca staff.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
34 (129)AstraZeneca retains the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are 
suspected to be causally related to an IP and that potentially require expedited reporting to 
regulatory authorities. Treatment codes will not be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the evaluability of the data from each individual patient have been made 
and documented.
3.8 Restrictions
The following is restricted during the study:
!Donation of blood is not allowed throughout the study.
!Patient should keep regular night/day shifts.
!The activities that should be avoided in the morning prior to lung function 
testing are :
Smoking within at least 1 hour of testing.
Consuming alcohol within 4 hours of testing.
Performing vigorous exercise within 30 minutes of testing.
Wearing clothing that substantially restricts full chest and abdominal 
expansion.
Eating a large meal within 2 hours of testing.
Using albuterol/salbutamol MDI within approximately 6 hours of 
testing.
Using ipratropium bromide MDI within approximately 6 hours of 
testing at Visit 2 and Visit 3.
Using IP in the morning before visits 4-7.
!Restrictions regarding concomitant medication are described in Section 7.
Any event likely to interfere with the objectives of the study will be communicated to the 
Investigator and reported without delay to AstraZeneca.
3.9 Discontinuation of IP
Patients may be discontinued from IP in the following situations:
∀ Patient decision.  The patient is at any time free to discontinue treatment, without 
prejudice to further treatment.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
35 (129)∀ AEs that, in the opinion of the Investigator, contraindicates further IP treatment.
∀ Severe non-compliance with the Clinical Study Protocol as judged by the 
Investigator or AstraZeneca. The study physician should be consulted before IP is 
discontinued based on this criterion.
∀ In the opinion of the Investigator, patient requires additional treatment or care 
beyond what is provided by the study, including treatment with prohibited COPD 
medications (see Table 8 ). 
∀ Eligibility requirement found not to be fulfilled.
∀ A severe COPD exacerbation (requiring hospitalisation) or more than one moderate 
exacerbation (requiring antibiotics or ≥3 days of systemic steroids).
∀ Pregnancy.
3.9.1 Procedures for discontinuation of a patient from investigational product 
At any time, patients are free to discontinue IP or withdraw from the study (i.e., IP and 
assessments – see Section 3.10), without prejudice to further treatment.  A patient that decides 
to discontinue IP will always be asked about the reason(s) and the presence of any AEs. 
If possible, patients who discontinue IP prematurely will be seen and assessed by the 
Investigator at an Early Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit which should be performed at the 
earliest possibility. Patients will return to appropriate COPD maintenance medications, per the 
Investigator’s discretion. Consideration should be given to maintaining patients on at least double therapy, while ensuring appropriate follow-up and further evaluation of the prescribed 
treatment. AEs will be followed up (see Section 6) and rescue medication, ePRO and all IPs 
should be returned by the patient. The reason and date for premature discontinuation of IP will be documented in the source documentation and in the eCRF. 
A follow-up telephone call will be performed approximately 14 days after the last IP dose for 
follow-up of any AEs. After the follow-up telephone call, patients will be withdrawn and no further data will be collected. In the event the Early Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit is 
performed approximately 14 days post last IP dosing, a follow-up contact will not be required. 
If a patient is withdrawn from study (see Section 3.10).
3.10 Criteria for withdrawal 
If a patient withdraws from participation in the study, then his/her enrolment/randomisation 
code cannot be reused. Withdrawn patients will not be replaced.
3.10.1 Screen failures 
Screening failures are patients who do not fulfil the eligibility criteria for the study, and 
therefore must not be randomised.  These patients should have the reason for study withdrawal 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
36 (129)recorded as ‘Screen failure’. (This reason for study withdrawal is only valid for the patients 
who have not been randomised.)
3.10.2 Discontinuation of investigational product
Patients who discontinue IP will be withdrawn from the study (see Section 3.9.1 ).
3.10.3 Withdrawal of the informed consent
Patients are free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to further treatment 
(IP and assessments).
A patient who withdraws consent should always be asked about the reason(s) and whether any 
AEs are present; to ensure patient safety in such cases, the Investigator should follow up AEs 
outside of the clinical study period based on clinical judgement. The patient will return 
electronic PRO (ePRO) devices to the study site. 
Withdrawal of consent should be documented by the Investigator in the eCRF and medical 
records. If possible, the patient should complete the Early Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit at 
the time of withdrawal of consent.
3.11 Discontinuation of the study
The study may be stopped if, in the judgment of AstraZeneca, study patients are placed at undue risk because of clinically significant findings that:
∀ are assessed as causally related to IP and 
∀ are not considered to be consistent with continuation of the study
Regardless of the reason for termination, all data available for the patient at the time of 
discontinuation of follow-up must be recorded in the CRF. 
In terminating the study, the Sponsor will ensure that adequate consideration is given to the 
protection of the patients’ interests and wellbeing.

43 (129)4.1 Screening/Enrolment period
At screening, consenting patients are assessed to ensure that they meet eligibility criteria. 
Patients who do not meet these criteria must not be enrolled in the study.
The screening period will start at Visit 1 with the signature of the ICF, followed by Visit 2, 
and will end at the randomisation visit (Visit 3).
The minimum length of screening period will be 9 days (one day for Visit 2, and a minimum 
of 7 full days of ePRO assessments in the patient’s home to establish baseline data for the 
ePRO instruments); maximum will normally be 4 weeks. In certain cases, screening may be extended after it is agreed with the AstraZeneca study physician.
4.1.1 Visit 1 (day -28 to -9) 
The screening visit will be scheduled in the morning, preferably at a time similar to future 
study visits (as outlined in Section 4.2and 5.1.1.2 ). The following assessments and processes 
will be performed during Visit 1:
∀ Obtaining signed informed consent before any study-related procedures
∀ Assignment of an E-code in IWRS/IVRS to the patient
!Any patient signing the ICF should be recorded in IWRS/IVRS and should be 
assigned an E-code. At this point, albuterol/salbutamol MDI which will be later used for the post-bronchodilator spirometry assessment will be assigned as well 
as the screening period maintenance treatment.
∀ Review of medical/surgical history, demographic, COPD history (date of COPD 
diagnosis, diagnosis of chronic bronchitis or emphysema, number of COPD 
exacerbations during last year and date of last COPD exacerbation and if 
hospitalization) and smoking information (i.e., date of smoking initiation, current 
smoker or former smoker, date of smoking cessation and total-pack years)
∀ ePRO Training (for CAT questionnaire)
∀ CAT questionnaire 
!Completed by patient in the ePRO
!Patient will be trained how to use ePRO and will be asked to complete CAT 
questionnaire in the ePRO (ePRO device will be dispensed at Visit 2)
∀ Prior/Concomitant Medications 
!All medications the patient is currently taking and has taken during the month 
prior to signing of the ICF should be collected

44 (129)∀ Physical examination including body weight (in light indoor clothes, without shoes) 
and height measurement
!BMI will be calculated automatically by eCRF system
∀ Vital signs
!Body temperature will be measured by an appropriate method according to 
local practice and standards. Systolic and diastolic pressure (in mmHg) and 
pulse will be measured after at least 5 minutes resting and before taking any 
blood sample and conducting any spirometry. Measurements will be carried out 
as per local practice.
∀ 12-Lead ECG
!Standard 12-lead ECG evaluations will be recorded after approximately 5 
minutes resting in supine position before any blood sampling and spirometry 
test. If the result is not available at Visit 1, it must be available by Visit 2 at the 
latest.
∀ Pregnancy Test when appropriate
!Urine pregnancy test
∀ Clinical Laboratory Test (non-fasting)
!Blood sampling performed in the local laboratory for haematology and 
biochemistry 
!Urinalysis
If the result of the blood or urine sampling is not available at Visit 1, it must be 
available by Visit 2 at the latest.
∀ Chest Image or CT
!New chest x-ray as per local practice (postero-anterior and lateral projections 
strongly recommended), or computed tomography (CT) scan should be 
obtained if chest x-ray or CT performed within the last 6 months prior to Visit 1 is not available. If the result is not available at Visit 1, it must be available by 
Visit 2 at the latest.
∀ Training of inhalation technique and device cleaning
!Training devices will be available at each study site for instructional purposes

!Post-bronchodilator forced manoeuvre test (FEV 1and FVC measurement): 
Administer 4 inhalations of inhaled albuterol/salbutamol MDI with or without a 
spacer device. After 20 to 30 minutes perform 1 set of Spirometry Forced 
manoeuvre.
∀ Review of inclusion/exclusion criteria
Only patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria at this point will be allowed to 
continue (patient meets COPD definition following spirometry assessments). See Section 4.4for rescreening procedures.  Otherwise, screening failure will be recorded in the 
IWRS/IVRS and eCRF. When patients fulfil inclusion/exclusion criteria, the following 
will occur:
∀ Screening period maintenance treatment (ipratropium bromide MDI) and rescue 
medication (albuterol/salbutamol MDI) dispensing (as allocated earlier using IWRS/IVRS):
! Adjustment of COPD Medications
!Stop prohibited COPD medications and change COPD medications (i.e., to 
sponsor provided ipratropium bromide MDI 2 inhalations QDS and 
albuterol/salbutamol MDI PRN).
∀ Scheduling of Visit 2. Patient will be reminded to avoid the intake of ipratropium 
bromide MDI and albuterol/salbutamol MDI for at least approximately 6 hours 
before attending Visit 2, and to bring back the rescue and wash-out medications
∀ It is recommended that the time of Visit 2 is scheduled according to instructions 
outlined in Section 4.2and Section 5.1.1.2 .
4.1.2 Visit 2 (Day -11 to -8)
∀ Telephone Contact - (in the morning of day before the visit) - It is recommended 
that sites call the patient in the morning of the day before a scheduled visit to 
remind the patient of the expectations for the upcoming visit:
!Withhold albuterol/salbutamol MDI and ipratropium bromide MDI for at least 
approximately 6 hours prior to start of the spirometry procedures
!Follow other restrictions related to spirometry
!Bring all study medications to the visit

apply correct inhalation technique for both types of inhalers . Training 
devices will be available at each study site for instructional purposes.
∀ Spirometry 
!Spirometry (slow manoeuvre for IC assessment followed by forced manoeuvre 
for FEV 1and FVC): 2 sets will be performed during the hour preceding the 
scheduled morning IP dose (-60 minutes and -30 minutes), allowing 30 min between them. 
!If the average of the -60 and -30 minute FEV
1 is >20% or >200 ml different 
from the average of the same pre-dose FEV 1 assessments at visit 2, the 
investigator will be alerted to contact the study physician for a discussion about patient eligibility.
Only patients who meet all inclusion/exclusion criteria at this point will be 
allowed to continue. See Section 4.4for re-screening procedures. Otherwise the 
screening failure will be recorded in the IWRS/IVRS and eCRF. Note: it is 
advised to allow enough time for the randomisation call in IWRS to be ready 
with the assigned kit numbers before the IP needs administration, as shown below.
When patient fulfils inclusion/exclusion criteria, the following assessments will be 
performed:
B Randomisation 
∀ Randomise the patient via IWRS/IVRS, and obtain kits number assignment.

∀ IP Administration
!Dosing of IP in the clinic should be planned to occur at approximately the same 
time the patient prefers to administer IP in the mornings between the visits. The 
patient should then be advised that subsequent morning IP administration 
should happen at approximately this time, and that evening dosing should occur as close as possible to 12 hours from this. It is recommended that dosing in the 
clinic occurs before approximately 10:00 AM. If it is unavoidable that IP 
administration in the clinic is at a later time of day than the patient normally administers IP at home (for example due to the travelling time to site), then 
patients should be strongly advised that on the day prior to the next clinic visit ,
the time of IP administration should be adjusted to be approximately 24 hours and 12 hours prior to the planned dosing at the clinic. Sites should make every 
effort to ensure that dosing in the clinic occurs as close as possible to 24 
and 12 hours after the patient’s IP intake the previous day .
!IP is administered by inhalation of 2 inhalations from the GFF/placebo inhaler 
followed by 1 inhalation from the UV /placebo inhaler. Site personnel should 
check that the patient uses the inhalers correctly.
!Record the date and time of the IP administration in the medical notes and in

ongoing AE (as well as any concomitant medication administered to treat the mentioned AE) 
and COPD exacerbations. IWRS/IVRS Follow-up call “Study completion” should be recorded in the system. Follow-up call will not be performed if Early Discontinuation/Withdrawal visit 
was done 14 or more days since the last dose of IP. 
4.4 Rescreening and rescheduling of visits.
4.4.1 Rescreening  
Patients with an event, such as a COPD exacerbation or pneumonia, occurring within the 
exclusion criteria specified time requirements prior to Visit 1, should not be screened; if this is done in error, these patients should be screen failed. Patients who experience an event during 
the screening period, which is specified in the exclusion criteria, should also be screen failed. 
Screen-failed patients may be re-screened observing timelines described in the exclusion criteria. 
Other instances where rescreening is being considered should be discussed with the AZ study 
physician.
Re-screening is only allowed once per patient.
If a patient is re-screened, a new informed consent form is to be signed, and re-screening Visit 
1 procedures must be initiated within 3 working days from the date of the new ICF. Rescreened patient keeps an originally assigned enrolment number.
4.4.2 Rescheduling of visits
Rescheduling of a visit will be allowed within the specified visit window for reasons such as 
incorrect dosing/time of dosing of IP the day prior to a visit, intake of disallowed medication or other disallowed events related to spirometry, or technical issues with spirometry or ePRO. 
If rescheduling is not possible within the specified visit window, the rescheduled visit should 
occur as soon as possible. If a visit needs to be rescheduled, no assessments will be performed, or if already partly done they will need to be repeated at the rescheduled visit. An important 
note regarding spirometry: during screening, for the spirometer technical reasons, each visit 
can be rescheduled only once and only if spirometry was not yet started at the original visit.

5.1.1 Spirometry Assessments at Clinic Visits
5.1.1.1 General requirementsLung function (IC, FEV
1and FVC) will be measured by spirometry using equipment provided 
by a central vendor. Spirometry will be performed by the Investigator or authorized delegate 
according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society (ATS/ERS) guidelines (Miller et al 2005 ).
The central spirometry vendor is responsible for assuring that the spirometer meets ATS/ERS 
recommendations and that the study site personnel who will be performing the testing are properly certified. Spirometry calibration will be detailed in a separate spirometry procedures 
manual.
Important! 
Patients should be instructed not to use their IP in the morning before site visits, as this 
will affect the spirometry results; IP will be taken at the site. For the same reason 
patients should not use their rescue albuterol/salbutamol MDI or their screening period 
ipratropium bromide MDI within approximately 6 hours of a scheduled site visit spirometry.
Options for handling patients who have inadvertently taken their COPD medication within the 
restricted window are described in Section 7.7.1.2 . 
N.B. There are no restrictions regarding medications taken prior to Visit 1, as spirometry at 
this visit will only measure lung function values following maximal bronchodilation.

Date 14 July 2017
61 (129)5.1.1.2 Time of day for scheduled site visit spirometry
Spirometry testing should be done according to the schedule provided in Table 1 and Table 2 . 
It is recommended to start spirometry testing in the morning between 6 and 9AM.  Following 
randomisation, the spirometry assessment should be performed within approximately ±1 hour of the time at which spirometry was tested on Visit 3 (Randomisation).  It is understood that 
this will not always be possible for patients or Investigators. The priority should be given to 
dosing of IP approximately 12 hours after the evening dose and 24 hours after the morning dose of IP, and to start spirometry approximately 60 minutes before these timepoints. 
The time for the spirometry assessments depends on the time chosen for IP administration, 
which should be planned to occur at approximately the same time the patient prefers to administer IP in the mornings between the visits (for further details on the timing of IP 
administration, please see Section 4.2). For example, if the patient prefers to administer IP at 9 
AM (and 9 PM), then the pre-dose randomisation spirometry would be planned to start at 8 AM (so as to be 60 minutes prior to IP dosing), and all subsequent pre-dose spirometry testing 
should be initiated between 7 AM and 9 AM. 
5.1.1.3 Spirometry technique
Patients should avoid engaging in strenuous exertion for at least 30 minutes prior to 
spirometry measurements. Patients should also avoid eating a large meal for at least 2 hours 
prior to spirometry measurements. Smoking should be avoided for at least 1 hour, and 
consuming alcohol for 4 hours. 
For information about the slow manoeuvre technique used for IC assessment, please see 
Section 5.1.1.5 .
Forced expiratory manoeuvres should be performed with the patient seated in an upright 
position. If this is not comfortable for the patient, standing is permitted. The same position 
should be used by the patient for each forced expiratory manoeuvre from enrolment 
throughout the study. The head must not be tilted during manoeuvres and the thorax should be able to move freely; hence tight clothing should be loosened. A nose-clip should be used for 
the manoeuvre. The patient from enrolment throughout the study should use mouthpieces of 
the same dimension and shape.
The forced expiratory manoeuvre (FEV
1and FVC) should start with a maximal inspiration 
and then followed by a fast and forceful expiration that should last for at least 6 seconds. It is 
important to encourage the patient to continue the expiration to be fast and forceful throughout the manoeuvre. Ensure that none of the following has occurred: coughing during the first 
second, glottis closure, leak or obstruction of the mouthpiece (by the tongue).
Multiple forced expiratory efforts (at least 3 but no more than 8) will be performed for each 
site spirometry session. An adequate test should consist of three acceptable manoeuvers. The 
best effort that meets the ATS/ERS acceptability and reproducibility criteria ( Miller et al 
2005 ) will be recorded. The best efforts will be based on the highest FEV
1.
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
62 (129)The absolute measurement (for FEV 1and FVC), and the percentage of predicted normal value 
(Quanjer et al 2012 ) will be recorded. The highest FVC will also be reported regardless of the 
effort in which it occurred (even if the effort did not result in the highest FEV 1).
5.1.1.4 Post-bronchodilator spirometry
Post-BD spirometry following maximal bronchodilation will be performed at Visit 1 (with no 
pre-BD spirometry) to confirm COPD diagnosis and disease severity, and at Visit 2 (after pre-
BD spirometry) to assess BD responsiveness.  
Maximal bronchodilation will be induced using 4 inhalations of albuterol (90 μg metered 
dose) or salbutamol (100 μg metered dose) with or without a spacer device. At visit 2, this will 
occur within 30 minutes ± 15 minutes of the final pre-BD spirometry measurement. Post-BD spirometry will be performed 20-30 minutes after administration of albuterol/salbutamol MDI. 
If a patient cannot tolerate 4 inhalations of beta agonist, a lower number of inhalations may be 
considered at the Investigator’s clinical judgment (minimum 2 inhalations). BD responsiveness at Visit 2 will be a comparison of the average of the best FEV
1effort obtained 
at 60 minute and 30 minute pre-BD to the best FEV 1effort obtained at 20-30 minutes post-
BD. 
5.1.1.5 Inspiratory Capacity
IC assessments will be conducted at Visits 3-7. Pre-dose assessments will be at 60 minutes 
and 30 minutes prior to IP administration at Visit 3 only. Post-dose assessments will be 1 and 
2 hours after administration of IP. The average of the two pre-dose assessments at Visit 3 will be used to establish the baseline IC. IC assessments are always performed prior to any other 
spirometry assessments.
All patients will be instructed on the performance of the slow manoeuvre technique used for 
IC assessment. Patients must be tested in the seated position wearing a nose clip with no air 
leaks between the mouth and mouthpiece. Patients should be relaxed with shoulders down and 
asked to breathe regularly for several breaths until the end-expiratory lung volume is stable (this usually requires at least five tidal manoeuvres). They are then urged to take a deep breath 
to total lung capacity with no hesitation. At least three acceptable manoeuvers should be 
performed. Reporting will be done as per ATS/ERS guidelines ( Miller et al 2005 ).
5.1.1.6 Record keeping
A signed and dated copy of the pre- and post- BD printout must be kept at the study site for 
source data verification. The printout must be marked with the study code, enrolment code, 
date and time of measurement, visit number.
5.1.1.7 Spirometry references
The Global Lung Function Initiative (GLI) equations will be used to determine the patients 
predicted normal (PN) values and will be pre-programmed into the spirometer ( Quanjer et al 
2012 ).

FEV 1measured/ FEV 1PN x 100.
5.1.2 Patient Reported Outcomes
Patients will complete PRO assessments at the study site and at home using a handheld 
electronic device (ePRO). PRO assessments must be collected in a systematic way to ensure 
data integrity. The following best practice guidelines should be followed when collecting PRO 
data at the site or at home via an ePRO device:
For PRO instruments administered during site visits using ePRO device
∀ Administer before other procedures
!Always administer PRO instruments before other study procedures. For details 
how to activate them, refer to the ePRO materials.
∀ Provide the right environment
!Provide a quiet and private location to complete the instrument.
∀ No right or wrong answers
!Remind patients that there are no right or wrong answers and that we are asking 
them to complete these questionnaires because we’re interested in hearing 
directly from them on how they feel.
∀ Help with procedural questions
!Make sure the patient understands how to complete the instrument. Instrument 
instructions are usually self-explanatory but staff may answer questions about 
procedural issues like what it means to “tick a box”.
∀ Avoid bias: do not clarify the meaning of questions or responses
!Sometimes patients will ask site staff to clarify the meaning of a question or 
response. To avoid introducing any bias, politely tell the patient that you cannot clarify items. Remind them that there are no right or wrong answers. Tell them 
that they should select the response that best answers the question as they understand it.
∀ No time limits. Although most instruments require only a few minutes to complete 
the patient should be given as much time as is needed.
∀ Review for completeness
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
64 (129)!Prompt review of the questionnaire for completeness will minimize missing 
data and data queries. 
For PRO instruments captured at home using an ePRO device.
∀ Guidelines similar to PRO completion at the visits
!Same principles apply for ePRO for home based assessments as assessment at 
site. Remind patients that there are no right or wrong answers, avoid bias by not 
clarifying items, remind patients that they should complete the ePRO questions 
in a quiet and private location without help from others.
∀ Train the patient on ePRO device usage
!Train the patient on how to use the ePRO device using the materials and 
training provided by the ePRO vendor.
!Provide guidance on whom the patient should call if they have problems
∀ Monitor compliance
!Minimizing missing data is a key aspect of study success. Compliance must be 
checked at each study visit and should be checked more frequently to identify 
problems early. If compliance drops below 80% a check-in call from the site to ask the patient if they are having difficulties is highly recommended. 
5.1.2.1 Baseline/Transitional Dyspnea Index (BDI/TDI)
The BDI/TDI is an instrument developed to provide a multidimensional measure of dyspnea 
in relation to activities of daily living ( Mahler et al 1984 ). The Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI) 
provides a measure of dyspnea at a single state, the baseline, and the Transitional Dyspnea 
Index (TDI) evaluates changes in dyspnea from the baseline state. The instrument consists of 
three components: functional impairment, magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. For the BDI, each of these three components are rated in five grades from 0 (severe) to 4 
(unimpaired), and are summed to form a baseline total score from 0 to 12. For the TDI, 
changes in dyspnea are rated for each component by seven grades from -3 (major deterioration) to +3 (major improvement), and are added to form a total TDI score from -9 to 
+9. Positive scores indicate an improvement, and a change from the BDI or a difference 
between treatments of 1 point has been estimated to constitute the minimum clinically important difference (MCID) ( Mahler et al 2005 ).
The BDI/TDI is completed by a trained interviewer, who asks the respondent various 
questions as part of a medical history, and selects a grade (score) using specific criteria for each of the three components. The same interviewer will complete the BDI and the TDI for an 
individual patient. The questionnaires should be completed in a quiet area, and the patient 
should be allowed to ask questions. Site personnel should take care not to influence the patient’s responses.  The interviewer must be blinded to other assessments evaluated for the

Date 14 July 2017
65 (129)patient.  BDI/TDI will be recorded in the ePRO, provided by the ePRO vendor in relevant 
local language. BDI will be completed at Visit 3, and TDI at Visit 4, Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 7 
and Early Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit (except in those cases when the IP has already been discontinued and not used according to protocol on the day before the visit).
5.1.2.2 COPD Assessment Test (CAT)
The CAT is an 8-item PRO developed to measure the impact of COPD on health status ( Jones 
et al 2009 ). The instrument uses semantic differential six-point response scales which are 
defined by contrasting adjectives to capture the impact of COPD. Content includes items 
related to cough, phlegm, chest tightness, breathlessness going up hills/stairs, activity 
limitation at home, confidence leaving home, sleep and energy. A CAT total score is the sum of item responses. Scores range from 0-40 with higher scores indicative of greater COPD 
impact on health status. CAT will be recorded by the patient in the ePRO, provided by the 
ePRO vendor in relevant local language, at Visit 1, Visit 3, Visit 4, Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 7 and Early Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit (except in those cases when the IP has already been 
discontinued and not used according to protocol on the day before the visit).
5.1.2.3 Night-time and Early morning symptoms of COPD instrument (NiSCI and 
EMSCI)
The questionnaire is made up of two parts. The first part covering “last night” symptoms (time 
elapsed from the time patient went to bed until woke up and got out of bed to start his/her day) 
and the second part covering “this morning” symptoms (time elapsed since patient got out of 
bed to start the day).
The EMSCI was developed to collect data about the frequency and severity of early morning 
symptoms and the impact of COPD symptoms on early morning activity in patients with 
COPD.
The NiSCI was developed to collect data about the frequency and severity of night-time 
symptoms and the impact of COPD symptoms on night-time awakenings in patients with 
COPD.
The data collected can be used to generate the following scores:
1. The six-Item Symptom Severity score is derived by averaging the responses from a 
patient on the six item-level symptom scores and can be used to quantify the severity of early morning and night-time symptoms. 
2. The Overall COPD Symptom Severity score is comprised of a single item asking 
about overall COPD symptom severity in the early morning and at night. 
3. The Early Morning Activity score obtains information on the reduction in early 
morning activity limitation due to COPD symptoms. The Night-time Awakenings 
score can be used to obtain information on the number (or proportion) of days without night-time awakening due to COPD symptoms.

66 (129)The NiSCI and EMSCI (see Appendix E ) will be recorded by the patient in the ePRO, 
provided by the ePRO vendor in relevant local language, every morning approximately 
between 7 AM and 11 AM, preferably approximately 1 hour or later after taking IP. The questionnaire will be collected from the day after Visit 2 (Screening) and up to Visit 7. The 
NiSCI and EMSCI will not be recorded on Visit days.
5.1.3 Investigational Product Use
Administration of IP taken will be recorded by the patient in the ePRO twice daily (morning 
and evening), from Visit 3 to the end of the study.
5.1.4 Rescue Medication Use
The number of inhalations of rescue medication taken will be recorded by the patient in the 
ePRO twice daily (morning and evening), from Visit 2 to the end of the study. Patients will 
report nighttime use (since last evening when completing the ePRO) in the morning, and 
daytime use in the evening.
5.2 Safety assessments
5.2.1 Laboratory safety assessments
Blood and urine samples for determination of clinical chemistry, haematology, and urinalysis 
will be taken at Visit 1. Fasting is not required. If the result is not available at Visit 1, it must 
be available by Visit 2 at the latest.
The clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis will be performed at a local laboratory at 
or near to the Investigator site.  Sample tubes and sample sizes may vary depending on 
laboratory method used and routine practice at the site.
The following laboratory variables will be measured:

should be recorded and reported, see Section 6.3
Note: In case a patient shows an AST orALT ≥3xULN ortotal bilirubin ≥2xULN please 
refer to Section 6.3.7 , for further instructions.
5.2.1.1 Pregnancy Test
Urine HCG test will be performed in female patients (when appropriate) using a urine 
dipstick. The test should be performed at the study site at Visit 1, and before IP administration at Visit 3, Visit 5, Visit 7 and at an Early Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit. 
5.2.2 Physical examination
A complete physical examination will be performed at Visit 1 and include an assessment of 
the following: general appearance , respiratory, cardiovascular, abdomen. According to the 
Investigator’s judgement, assessment will also include skin, head and neck (including ears, 
eyes, nose and throat), lymph nodes, thyroid, abdomen, musculo-skeletal (including spine and 
extremities) and neurological systems.
Only relevant findings, detected at Screening Visit, will be recorded in the Medical 
History/Physical examination at the eCRF. Body weight and height will be measured only at 
Visit 1 (screening) (allowing calculation of Body Mass Index done automatically by the eCRF system) which will be recorded on the MasterScope CT. Patients should be in light indoor 
clothes without shoes.

5.3.1 Clinical Outcome Assessments/Patient Reported Outcomes
5.3.1.1 EQ-5D-5L EuroQol 5 Dimensions QuestionnaireThe EQ-5D-5L questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions: mobility, self-care, usual activities, 
pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. Each dimension has 5 response options (no problems, 
slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, and extreme problems) that reflect 
increasing levels of difficulty.
The patient will be asked to indicate his/her current health state by selecting the most 
appropriate level in each of the 5 dimensions. The questionnaire also includes a visual 
analogue scale, where the patient will be asked to rate current health status on a scale of 0-100, with 0 being the worst imaginable health state.
The EQ-5D-5L will be completed at randomisation Visit 3 at visit 7 and Early 
Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit using the ePRO device.
5.3.1.2 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaire - General Health 
(WPAI - GH)
The WPAI-GH will be used to measure self-reported productivity loss and consists of 
questions on COPD impact on patient’s general health, ability to work and perform regular 
activities in daily living within the previous 7 days.
The questionnaire will initially be completed at the study site on Visit 3 (Day 1) on the ePRO 
device. Patients will then be prompted to complete the WPAI-GH on the ePRO device at Visit 
4, Visit 5, Visit 6, Visit 7 and Early Discontinuation/Withdrawal Visit.
5.3.1.3 Healthcare Resource Utilization
Broad-based COPD-related health care resource utilization event information will be collected 
by the Investigator/authorized delegate in accordance with the schedule provided in Table 1 
and recorded in the appropriate eCRF module.
At Visit 3, COPD-related Healthcare Resource Utilization information will be collected with a 
one year recall period. All the subsequent visits will collect COPD related Healthcare 
Resource Utilization and COPD exacerbation information with a recall period of ‘since last scheduled visit’.
Note: Cases of hospitalization must also be reported as an SAE (see Section 6.2and 6.4).

6. SAFETY REPORTING AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT
The Principal Investigator is responsible for ensuring that all staff involved in the study are 
familiar with the content of this section.
6.1 Definition of adverse events
An adverse event is the development of any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical study patient administered a medicinal product and which does not necessarily have a 
causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavourable and 
unintended sign (eg, an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom (for example nausea, chest pain), or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, whether or not 
considered related to the medicinal product. 
The term AE is used to include both serious and non-serious AEs and can include a 
deterioration of a pre-existing medical occurrence. An AE may occur at any time, including 
screening or washout periods, even if no study treatment has been administered.
6.2 Definitions of serious adverse event
A serious adverse event (SAE) is an AE occurring during any study phase (ie, screening, 
treatment, or follow-up), that fulfils one or more of the following criteria:
∀ Results in death
∀ Is immediately life-threatening
∀ Requires in- patient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalisation 
∀ Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
∀ Is a congenital abnormality or birth defect
∀ Is an important medical event that may jeopardise the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above.
For further guidance on the definition of a SAE, see Appendix A to the Clinical Study 
Protocol.

70 (129)6.3 Recording of adverse events
6.3.1 Time period for collection of adverse events
AEs and SAEs will be collected from time of signature of informed consent throughout the 
treatment period and until the follow-up telephone call.
6.3.2 Follow-up of unresolved adverse events
Any AEs that are unresolved at the time of the follow-up telephone call are followed up by 
the Investigator for as long as medically indicated, but without further recording in the CRF. AstraZeneca retains the right to request additional information for any patient with ongoing 
AEs/SAEs at the end of the study, if judged necessary.
6.3.3 Variables 
The following variables will be collected for each AE;
∀ AE (verbatim)
∀ The date and time when the AE started and stopped
∀ Severity
- Maximum intensity
- The Investigator must categorize the severity of each AE according to the 
following guidelines:
1 mild (awareness of sign or symptom, but easily tolerated)2 moderate (discomfort sufficient to cause interference with normal activities)
3 severe (incapacitating, with inability to perform normal activities)
∀ Whether the AE is serious or not
∀ Investigator causality rating against the IP (yes or no)
∀ Action taken with regard to IP
∀ AE caused patient’s withdrawal from study (yes or no )
∀ Outcome
In addition, the following variables will be collected for SAEs:
∀ Date AE met criteria for serious AE

Date 14 July 2017
71 (129)∀ Date Investigator became aware of serious AE
∀ Reason that the AE is serious
If the following two seriousness criteria, collect the following variables:
Hospitalization
- Date of hospital admission
- Date of discharge
Death
- Probable cause of death
- Date of death- Autopsy results
- Causality assessment in relation to Study procedure(s)
∀ Causality assessment to other medication
∀ Causality assessment to additional study drug
∀ Description of AE.
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of 
intensity whereas seriousness is defined by the criteria in Section 6.2.  An AE of severe 
intensity need not necessarily be considered serious.  For example, nausea that persists for several hours may be considered severe nausea, but not a SAE unless it meets the criteria 
shown in Section 6.2. On the other hand, a stroke that results in only a limited degree of 
disability may be considered a mild stroke but would be a SAE when it satisfies the criteria shown in Section 6.2.
6.3.4 Causality collection
The Investigator will assess causal relationship between IP and each AE, and answer ‘yes’ or 
‘no’ to the question ‘Do you consider that there is a reasonable possibility that the event may have been caused by the IP?’
For SAEs causal relationship will also be assessed for other medication and study procedures. 
Note that for SAEs that could be associated with any study procedure the causal relationship is implied as ‘yes’.
A guide to the interpretation of the causality question is found in Appendix A to the Clinical 
Study Protocol.

Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
72 (129)6.3.5 Adverse events based on signs and symptoms
All AEs spontaneously reported by the patient or reported in response to the open question 
from the study site personnel: ‘Have you had any health problems since the previous visit?’ , 
or revealed by observation will be collected and recorded in the CRF. When collecting AEs, the recording of diagnoses is preferred (when possible) rather than recording a list of signs and 
symptoms.  However, if a diagnosis is known and there are other signs or symptoms that are 
not generally part of the diagnosis, the diagnosis and each sign or symptom will be recorded separately.
6.3.6 Adverse events based on examinations and tests
The Clinical Study Protocol mandates laboratory testing, physical examination, and 
assessment of vital signs at screening only. Further testing may however be performed by the Investigator during the course of the trial. If deterioration in a laboratory value/vital sign is 
associated with clinical signs and symptoms, the sign or symptom will be reported as an AE 
and the associated laboratory result/vital sign will be considered as additional information.  Values and/or vital signs that fulfil any of the SAE criteria or are the reason for 
discontinuation of treatment with the IP should be reported.  Wherever possible the reporting 
Investigator uses the clinical, rather than the laboratory term (eg, anaemia versus low haemoglobin value). In the absence of clinical signs or symptoms, clinically relevant 
deteriorations should be reported as AEs. Any new or aggravated clinically relevant abnormal 
medical finding at a physical examination as compared with the baseline assessment will be reported as an AE,unless the finding is associated with a medical condition reported as an AE.
6.3.7 Hy’s Law
Cases where a patient shows elevations in liver biochemistry may require further evaluation 
and occurrences of AST or ALT ≥ 3xULN together with total bilirubin ≥ 2xULN may need to 
be reported as SAEs. Please contact the AstraZeneca study physician for further instruction on 
cases of increases in liver biochemistry and evaluation of a potential Hy’s Law case. 
Investigators should be vigilant for potential Hy’s Law cases from ad hoc laboratory tests or AEs.
6.3.8 Disease under Study (DUS)
COPD symptoms or signs, such as bronchitis, cough, phlegm, sputum increased, dyspnea and 
wheeze, will be recorded as AEs when:
∀ the sign or symptom is serious according to definitions, see Section 6.2and/or
∀ the patient discontinues the study due to the sign or symptom and/or
∀ the sign or symptom is new to the patient or not consistent with the patient’s 
preexisting COPD history (defined as within 1 year of Visit 1) as judged by the 
Investigator

73 (129)6.4 Reporting of serious adverse events
All SAEs have to be reported, whether or not considered causally related to the IP, or to the 
study procedures. All SAEs will be recorded in the CRF.
If any SAE occurs in the course of the study, then Investigators or other site personnel inform 
the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within one day i.e., immediately but no later 
than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all the 
necessary information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1
calendar day of initial receipt for fatal and life threatening events and within 5 calendar
days of initial receipt for all other SAEs.
For fatal or life-threatening AEs where important or relevant information is missing, active 
follow-up is undertaken immediately.  Investigators or other site personnel inform 
AstraZeneca representatives of any follow-up information on a previously reported SAE 
within one calendar day i.e., immediately but no later than 24 hours of when he or she 
becomes aware of it.
Once the Investigators or other site personnel indicate an AE is serious in the WBDC system,
an automated email alert is sent to the designated AstraZeneca representative.
If the WBDC system is not available, then the Investigator or other study site personnel 
reports a SAE to the appropriate AstraZeneca representative by telephone.
The AstraZeneca representative will advise the Investigator/study site personnel how to 
proceed. 
The reference document for definition of expectedness/listedness is the Investigator’s 
Brochure for the AstraZeneca drug and the EU Summary of Product Characteristics for the active comparator product.
6.5 Overdose
This refers to the administration of a quantity of a medicinal product given per administration or cumulatively, which is above the maximum recommended dose according to the authorised product information. Clinical judgement should always be applied.
∀ An overdose with associated AEs is recorded as the AE diagnosis/symptoms on the 
relevant AE modules in the CRF and on the Overdose CRF module.
∀ An overdose without associated symptoms is only reported on the Overdose CRF 
module.

other site personnel inform appropriate AstraZeneca representatives immediately, or no later 
than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site.
For overdoses associated with a SAE, the standard reporting timelines apply, see Section 6.4.  
For other overdoses, reporting must occur within 30 days.
6.6 Pregnancy
All pregnancies and outcomes of pregnancy should be reported to AstraZeneca.
6.6.1 Maternal exposure
If a patient becomes pregnant during the course of the study the IP should be discontinued 
immediately.
Pregnancy itself is not regarded as an AE unless there is a suspicion that the IP under study 
may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contraceptive medication.  Congenital 
abnormalities/birth defects and spontaneous miscarriages should be reported and handled as SAEs. Elective abortions without complications should not be handled as AEs. The outcome 
of all pregnancies (spontaneous miscarriage, elective termination, ectopic pregnancy, normal 
birth or congenital abnormality) should be followed up and documented even if the patient was discontinued from the study.
If any pregnancy occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site personnel 
informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1day i.e., immediately but no 
later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.
The designated AstraZeneca representative works with the Investigator to ensure that all 
relevant information is provided to the AstraZeneca Patient Safety data entry site within 1 or 5 calendar days for SAEs (see Section 6.4) and within 30 days for all other pregnancies.
The same timelines apply when outcome information is available.
6.7 Medication error
For the purposes of this clinical study a medication error is an unintended failure or mistake in 
the treatment process for an AstraZeneca study drug that either causes harm to the subject or 
has the potential to cause harm to the subject. 
A medication error is not lack of efficacy of the drug, but rather a human or process related 
failure while the drug is in control of the study site staff or subject.
Medication error includes situations where an error:

75 (129)∀ occurred
∀ was identified and intercepted before the subject received the drug
∀ did not occur, but circumstances were recognized that could have led to an error.
Examples of events to be reported in clinical studies as medication errors:
∀ Drug name confusion
∀ Dispensing error
∀ Drug not administered as indicated, for example, wrong route or wrong site of 
administration
∀ Drug not taken as indicated, for example, nasal inhalation used instead of oral 
inhalation
∀ Drug not stored as instructed e.g. kept in the fridge when it should be at room 
temperature 
∀ Wrong subject received the medication (excluding IWRS/IVRS errors)
∀ Wrong drug administered to subject (excluding IWRS/IVRS errors)
Examples of events that do not require reporting as medication errors in clinical studies:
∀ Errors related to or resulting from IWRS/IVRS – including those which lead to one 
of the above listed events that would otherwise have been a medication error 
∀ Subject accidentally missed drug dose(s) e.g. forgot to take medication
∀ Accidental overdose (will be captured as an overdose)
∀ Subject failed to return unused medication or empty packaging
∀ Errors related to background and rescue medication, even if an AZ product
Medication errors are not regarded as AEs but AEs may occur as a consequence of the 
medication error. 
If a medication error occurs in the course of the study, then the Investigator or other site 
personnel informs the appropriate AstraZeneca representatives within 1 day i.e., immediately 
but no later than 24 hours of when he or she becomes aware of it.

7.4 Storage
All study medications should be kept in a secure place under appropriate storage conditions.  The IP label on the IP inhalers and boxes specifies the appropriate storage.
The clinical supplies storage area at the site must be monitored by the site personnel for 
temperature consistency with the acceptable storage temperature range specified in 
accordance with the product label.  Documentation of temperature monitoring should be maintained.
7.5 Compliance
The technique for inhalation from an MDI (GFF) is different from the technique used with a DPI (UV). It is important to ensure that patients apply correct inhalation technique for 
both types of inhalers. Training devices will be available at each study site for instructional 
purposes, as well as for patients to practice the correct inhalation technique. Instruction and 
practice should occur prior to dispensing study medication, and review of patients' inhalation technique should be done at each visit.
The administration of all study medications (including IPs) should be recorded in the 
appropriate sections of the Case Report Form.

79 (129)Administration of study medication will be recorded twice daily in the patient’s ePRO. If IP 
use drops below 80%, or if IP use is not recorded on two consecutive days, an e-mail alert will 
be sent to the investigator; the patient should be contacted and the compliance problems investigated. Furthermore, site personnel will check study medication compliance in the ePRO 
at each visit, and any issues identified will be documented in the appropriate study files. If 
appropriate, site personnel will retrain the patient on the proper use of the IP inhalers. In case of repeated compliance alerts and/or if IP compliance drops below 50%, withdrawal of the 
patient should be considered. Before withdrawal of a patient due to low compliance, a 
discussion with the study physician is mandated.
7.6 Accountability
The study medications provided for this study will be used only as directed in the Clinical Study Protocol.
The study site personnel will account for all study medication, including IP, dispensed to and 
returned from the patient.
The supplies that are returned and accounted for or have never been used, shall be destroyed 
as applicable in a given country. Study site personnel or AZ monitor will account for all IPs 
received at the site, unused IPs and for appropriate destruction.  Certificates of delivery, destruction and return should be signed.

7.7.1 COPD Medication restrictions
7.7.1.1 Use of short-acting anticholinergics and short-acting β2-agonists
Patients will be provided ipratropium bromide MDI taken as 2 inhalations QDS for use as 
COPD maintenance therapy during the screening period. Use of any SAMA as rescue 
treatment for worsening COPD symptoms is not allowed from Visit 1 and throughout the 
study duration, with the exception of treatment during a COPD exacerbation. 
Albuterol/salbutamol MDI will be dispensed at Visit 1 for use as rescue medication for 
worsening of COPD symptoms. No other SABA is allowed during the study outside of 
managing a COPD exacerbation. Rescue use of albuterol/salbutamol MDI will be recorded inthe ePRO as number of inhalations per day (see Section 7, Table 7 ). Regularly scheduled use 
of albuterol/salbutamol MDI is not allowed. Prophylactic use in the absence of symptoms is 
discouraged. However, if deemed necessary by the patient and Investigator (e.g. prior to planned exercise), it can be used, but prophylactic inhalations should not be recorded in the 
daily ePRO. Such use should be documented in the medical notes and recorded in the eCRF.
Albuterol/salbutamol MDI rescue medication is not regarded as an IP, but will be provided by 
AstraZeneca, in order to ensure access for this therapy from enrolment and up to Week 24, 
unless the patient is withdrawn from the study.
7.7.1.2 COPD medication restrictions on the days of scheduled spirometry visits
Spirometry assessments will be performed at scheduled site visits (see Section 4, 
Table 1 ). 
There are no restrictions regarding patients’ COPD medications prior to the spirometry at Visit 1 (other than those related to study eligibility), whereas important restrictions apply prior to the spirometry at the following visits:
Visit 2: patients will be asked to withhold ipratropium bromide MDI and albuterol/salbutamol 
MDI within approximately 6 hours of the first (pre-BD) spirometry assessment. Use of albuterol/salbutamol MDI should be avoided until the screening lung function assessments are 
Clinical Study Protocol

Date 14 July 2017
83 (129)completed. Ipratropium bromide MDI may be administered following completion of the lung 
function assessments.
Visit 3: patients will be asked to withhold ipratropium bromide MDI and albuterol/salbutamol 
MDI within approximately 6 hours of the first (pre-BD) spirometry assessment. The treatment 
with ipratropium bromide MDI will be stopped, and the first doses of the two IP inhalers will 
be administered after completion of all pre-dose assessments. Use of albuterol/salbutamol MDI should be avoided until all lung function assessments are completed.
Visits 4-7: patients will be asked to withhold IP in the morning before the visits. The time 
from the previous dose until dosing of IP at the visit should be approximately 12 hours for the GFF/placebo inhaler, and approximately 24 hours for the UV/placebo inhaler. Use of 
albuterol/salbutamol MDI should be avoided for at least approximately 6 hours prior to the 
first scheduled spirometry. IP will be administered after completion of all pre-dose assessments. Albuterol/salbutamol MDI intake should be avoided until all lung function 
assessments are completed. 
If IP was dosed incorrectly (missed or not taken as directed) on the day prior to a visit, the 
visit should be rescheduled to another day, as soon as possible and preferably within the visit 
window. 
If IP was dosed at an incorrect time on the day prior to a visit (see Section 4.2), it is strongly 
recommended that the visit is rescheduled as above, but if this is not feasible for the patient, 
spirometry may be performed with a notation of the incorrect timing of IP.
If rescue medication was taken within 6 hours of the planned site visit spirometry, the patient 
should ideally remain at the site until such time that the 6 hours withholding time has been 
reached, given it does not exceed the spirometry window (see Section 5.1.1.2 ) or the 
stipulated time interval since IP intake on the previous day (see Section 4.2). Alternatively, 
patients can return on another day, as soon as possible and preferably within the visit window. 
If neither of options is feasible for the patient, spirometry may be performed with a notation 
indicating that the spirometry was conducted within 6 hours of rescue medication use.
7.7.1.3 Allowed Medications to treat a COPD exacerbation
For allowed medications to treat a COPD exacerbation, see Table 5 .
Rescue use of SABA and/or SAMA administered via nebulization is allowed to manage an 
acute COPD exacerbation.
Medications to treat an exacerbation should not be used for more than 14 days. Recent data 
suggest that treatment with systemic steroids for shorter periods of time results in similar 
outcomes with less systemic steroid exposure. Therefore, it is recommended that patients are treated with a 5 day course. A single depot injectable dose of corticosteroids will be 
considered equivalent to a 3-day course of systemic corticosteroids.

7.8 Post Study Access to Study Treatment 
After completion of study treatment, patients will be prescribed appropriate COPD maintenance medication according to the Investigator’s judgment and local medical practice. Consideration should be given to maintaining patients on at least double therapy, while 
ensuring appropriate follow-up and further evaluation of the prescribed treatment.
8. STATISTICAL ANALYSES
8.1 Statistical considerations
The primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of GFF relative to UV on lung 
function. This will be addressed by the following co-primary hypothesis tests: 
∀ non-inferiority of GFF relative to UV in the change from baseline in morning pre-
dose trough FEV 1over 24 weeks; 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
85 (129)∀ non-inferiority of GFF relative to UV in the peak change from baseline in FEV 1
within 2 hours post-dosing over 24 weeks;
∀ superiority of GFF relative to UV in the peak change from baseline in FEV 1within 
2 hours post-dosing over 24 weeks.
The non-inferiority null (H 0) and alternative (H 1) hypotheses, with μ representing the mean 
change from baseline in each treatment group, correspond to a null hypothesis of inferiority and an alternative hypothesis of non-inferiority, as follows: 
H0: μ
GFF–μUV≤ -Δ (GFF is inferior to UV by Δ or more) 
H1: μGFF–μUV> -Δ (GFF is inferior to UV by less than Δ)
The non-inferiority analysis for each endpoint is assessed within a Per Protocol analysis set 
and if non-inferiority is demonstrated the consistency of this conclusion will be assessed 
within the full analysis set.
If non-inferiority is demonstrated, then for selected endpoints superiority hypotheses will also 
be addressed within the full analysis set. Here the null (H 0) and alternative (H 1) hypotheses are 
as follows: 
H0: μGFF –μUV≤ 0 (GFF is not superior to UV) 
H1: μGFF –μUV> 0 (GFF is superior to UV)
The exception to this sequential testing of non-i nferiority followed by superiority is the 
analysis of the proportion of patients with increase in FEV 1 of ≥100 ml from baseline at 5 
minutes. For this endpoint testing will immediately be in terms of superiority hypotheses.
P-values will thus be reported as one-sided for both the non-inferiority and superiority 
hypothesis testing. This will equivalently be presented by comparing the lower bound of confidence intervals to the pre-specified margin.A comprehensive Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be signed off prior to unblinding or to the review of any potentially treatment revealing data. Analyses will be performed by AstraZeneca or its representatives.
All personnel involved with the analysis of the study will remain blinded until the database is 
locked and all protocol violations are identified.
8.2 Sample size estimate
1000 patients (500 patients each in the GFF and UV treatment arms) are to be randomised in 
this study. Based upon Phase III studies of GFF, it is estimated that 12% of the patients 
randomised will be excluded from the Per Protocol Analysis Set, leaving around 440 patients 
in the co-primary non-inferiority analyses. This sample size will provide around 94% power to demonstrate that the difference between GFF vs UV in change from baseline in morning pre-
dose trough FEV
1over 24 weeks is greater than the non-inferiority margin of -50 mL. This 
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
86 (129)calculation assumes a one-sided significance level of 2.5% and a true difference of -10 mL. 
Should testing be conducted at a one-sided significance level of 1.25% then the power would 
be 90%. Assumptions regarding variability for the co-primary endpoints are based on experience in previous GFF Phase III clinical studies. An effective standard deviation (SD) of 
167 mL for the change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV
1over 24 weeks has 
been assumed. This value is based on a per-visit SD of 200 mL and a within-patient (between-visit) correlation of 60%. Under these assumptions, for non-inferiority to be achieved the point 
estimate of the difference in pre-dose trough FEV
1over 24 weeks must be above -28mL when 
testing at a 2.5% significance level, or above - 24.5mL when testing at a 1.25% significance 
level. 
For the co-primary endpoint of peak FEV 1over 24 weeks and secondary lung function 
endpoint of peak IC over 24 weeks, the power to show non-inferiority is expected to be at least that of the co-primary endpoint of trough FEV
1. Assuming an effective SD of 188mL for 
peak FEV 1, and a true difference of 50mL then 500 patients would provide at least 97% power 
to demonstrate superiority of GFF to UV in peak FEV 1with a one-sided significance level of 
1.25%.
For the secondary endpoint of the TDI focal score over 24 weeks a non-inferiority margin of -
1 unit is defined. However, note that the power to show non-inferiority would remain at least 90% with a margin of -0.75 units (three quarters of the MCID), assuming no difference 
between treatments and a standard deviation of 3 units.
8.3 Definitions of analysis sets
The co-primary non-inferiority analyses and all other non-inferiority analyses in this study 
will primarily be conducted using the per protocol analysis set. This will be used to compare GFF and UV when the treatments are used as planned at each visit, in the intended patients 
and without important protocol deviations which may affect efficacy. This will provide an 
estimate of the true biological efficacy of the treatments and counters the tendency for intention-to-treat analyses to favour a conclusion of equivalence. Non-inferiority comparisons 
will also be conducted in the full analysis set of all patients receiving IP, allowing for 
variation in clinical application whilst on treatment, as a comparison of their effectiveness when used in practice. For selected endpoints this full analysis set will be used to provide an 
assessment of superiority, including for the co-primary analysis of the superiority of GFF 
relative to UV in Peak FEV
1.
The All Patients Analysis Set
This analysis set comprises all patients screened for the study and may be used for the 
reporting of disposition and screening failures.

87 (129)8.3.1 Efficacy analysis sets
Full Analysis Set
The Full Analysis Set will be defined as all patients randomised who received at least one 
inhalation of IP. Patients will be analysed according to the treatment they were assigned to at 
randomisation.  
This analysis set will be used to demonstrate consistency in non-inferiority hypothesis tests 
and as the primary means of assessing superiority hypotheses.
Per Protocol Analysis Set
The Per Protocol (PP) Analysis Set will be used as the primary means of assessing non-
inferiority hypotheses.
The Per Protocol Analysis Set is the subset of the full analysis set containing patients with 
post-randomisation data obtained prior to important protocol deviations which may affect efficacy. Data obtained after such important protocol deviations, i.e. those which may affect efficacy, will be excluded from analyses using this set. The use of certain prohibited medications (such as inhaled corticosteroids) outside of the limitations described in Section 7.7will be defined in the SAP as important protocol deviations and so data after the initiation 
of these will be excluded from per protocol analyses. Since receiving the wrong treatment will be a major protocol deviation, patients in the PP analysis set will be analysed as randomised (which for this population is identical to analysis by the actual treatment received). Patients must also have a valid spirometry baseline to be included given that this is required to ensure that key inclusion criteria are met.
Patients who are found not to meet the inclusion criteria for clinical diagnosis of COPD or the 
COPD severity criteria or who did not have the required washout of prohibited medications 
prior to baseline will be excluded entirely for the PP analysis set. In addition, data from visits 
where patients do not comply with required restrictions will be removed from analyses which use the per protocol analysis set (see Section 8.4.3 ). 
A detailed definition of the Per Protocol Analysis Set and data points to be excluded will be 
given in the Statistical Analysis Plan and defined prior to the review of any potentially treatment revealing data.

All patients who received any IP will be included in the safety analysis set. Patients will be 
classified according to the treatment they actually received. If a patient received more than one randomised treatment, they will be analysed and included in summaries according to the treatment they received the most. Any major deviations from the randomised treatment assignment will be listed and considered when interpreting the safety data.

88 (129)8.3.3 Other analysis sets
Rescue Medication User analysis setRegional differences in rescue albuterol/salbutamol MDI usage are expected with some 
regions using virtually no rescue albuterol/salbutamol MDI at study entry. Therefore, the 
Rescue Medication User analysis set is defined as all patients in the full analysis set with average baseline rescue albuterol/salbutamol MDI use of ≥ 1 inhalation/day. 
8.4 Outcome measures for analyses
8.4.1 Definition of baseline
All efficacy assessments are relative to pre-dose baseline obtained at randomisation at Visit 3. 
For spirometry endpoints the mean of all availab le evaluable -60 and -30 minute pre-dose 
spirometry assessments conducted at Day 1 (Vis it 3) will be used to establish baseline for all 
FEV 1, FVC, and IC parameters. 
For the diary symptom score parameters and rescue medication usage, baseline will be the 
average of the non-missing values from the ePRO data collected in the last seven days before 
randomisation (i.e. excluding data recorded on the day of visit 3).
8.4.2 Visit windows
Data will be summarised according to the protocol-scheduled week for that visit. Data 
collected in spirometry and ePRO systems will be allocated to visit weeks based upon assigned windows so as to allow rescheduled assessments to be included. Detailed definitions 
of visit windows and periods will be provided in the SAP.
For efficacy endpoints or derivation of AUC based on assessment times pre and post dosing, 
the assessments will be allocated to derived nominal collection time windows of minutes from IP dosing. These will be specified in the SAP.
8.4.3 Pulmonary Function Outcomes
All pulmonary function assessments that have at least one effort that meets ATS/ERS criteria 
for acceptability will be considered acceptable and contribute to the post-dose assessments for analyses using the full analysis set. If all the assessments at a specific timepoint were deemed to be of unacceptable quality the pulmonary function assessments obtained at the timepoint will not be included in any efficacy analysis and will be considered missing.
Further requirements will have to be met in addition to the ATS/ERS criteria in order for 
pulmonary function data to be used in the Per Protocol analyses. Patients who do not comply with selected restrictions during a study visit (for example on smoking and bronchodilator or 
rescue medication use) will have their data from that visit removed from analyses which use 
the per protocol analysis set. Patients who do not take the morning and evening doses of blinded study inhalers on the day preceding a study visit will also have their data from that 
visit removed.

Date 14 July 2017
89 (129)8.4.3.1 Morning pre-dose trough FEV 1
The co-primary endpoint of change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV 1 is defined 
as the average of the -60 and -30 minute pre-dose values at each visit minus baseline. Baseline 
is defined as the average of the non-missing -60 minute and -30 minute values obtained prior to dosing at Visit 3.
In patients missing either of these pre-dose assessments, the value will be calculated from the 
single measurement. In patients missing both pre-dose values, morning pre-dose trough FEV
1 
at that visit will not be calculated.
The change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FVC will be derived similarly.
8.4.3.2 Peak FEV 1 and Inspiratory Capacity post-dosing
The co-primary endpoint of peak change from baseline in FEV 1 is defined as the maximum of 
the FEV 1 assessments within 2 hours post-dosing at each visit minus baseline. Similarly, the 
secondary endpoint of peak change from baseline in IC is defined as the maximum of the ICassessments within 2 hours post-dosing at each visit minus baseline.
Further additional spirometry endpoints will also be derived. Peak change from baseline in 
FVC within 2 hours post-dose will be derived similarly to Peak FEV
1. The trapezoidal rule 
will be used to derive estimates of AUC 0-2for FEV 1and FVC, normalised by time from first 
to last non-missing value, as long as there are at least 2 non-missing time points during the 
first 2 hours post-dose.
8.4.3.3 Increase in FEV 1 at 5 minutes post-dosing
To assess the early onset of action, a secondary endpoint of this study will be the proportion of 
patients with increase of FEV 1 of ≥100 ml from baseline at 5 minutes on day 1. Only data 
assigned to the 5 minute window will be used to determine response. Patients with missing data will be considered to be non-responders for the analysis.
Additional categorical endpoints will be derived similarly as the proportion of patients with 
increase of FEV
1 of ≥150 ml from baseline at 5 minutes and the proportion of patients with 
increase of FEV 1 of ≥12% from baseline at 5 minutes.
8.4.4 Patient Reported Outcomes 
8.4.4.1 Transition Dyspnea Index (TDI) focal scoreAs a secondary endpoint assessing dyspnea, the TDI focal score will be derived at post-
randomisation visits relative to the baseline severity of dyspnea assessed using the BDI at visit 
3. The BDI and TDI consist of 3 individual components: functional impairment, magnitude of task, and magnitude of effort. These are summed to form a baseline total score for BDI (range 
0-12) and a total TDI score (range -9 to +9). For the TDI, at each visit, if a response to any of 
the three questions is missing, then the focal score will also be considered missing. Otherwise, scoring and handling of missing items will be conducted in accordance with the user’s guide 
for the TDI score.

Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
90 (129)The percentage of patients achieving the threshold of 1 unit or more in TDI focal score will be 
derived at each visit. For the TDI responder analyses, patients with missing data will be 
considered to be non-responders for the analysis.
8.4.4.2 Early Morning Symptoms COPD Instrument (EMSCI) and Night Time 
Symptoms COPD Instrument (NiSCI)
Patients will complete a daily ePRO questionnaire of their COPD symptoms with two parts 
covering symptoms “last night” and “this morning”.
The change from baseline in the 6-item EMSCI Symptom Severity Score is a secondary 
endpoint. This is derived by averaging the responses from a patient on the six item-level symptom scores
The change from baseline in the 6-item NiSCI Symptom Severity Score will also be assessed. 
The change from baseline in the Overall COPD Symptom Severity score, Early Morning Activity score and Night-time Awakenings score will also be derived.
Each daily measure will be aggregated based upon the time periods between clinic visits. Data 
from the day of the clinic visit will not be used in these aggregates. These periods will be specified in detail in the SAP. If the measure is available on more than half of the days in a given period then an aggregate score will be computed as the average of all present daily values. Otherwise the score will be considered missing for that period. ePRO data recorded during the last 7 days of the screening period prior to Visit 3 will be used to calculate the baseline.
8.4.4.3 COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score
The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is used to quantify the impact of COPD symptoms on 
health status. The CAT has a scoring range of 0-40, and it is calculated as the sum of the responses given for each of the 8 items (scored on a 6-point scale from 0 to 5), with higher scores indicating a higher impact of COPD symptoms on health status. If the response to 1 of the 8 items is missing, the missing item will be considered equal to the average of the 7 non-missing items for that patient. If more than 1 item is missing the score will be considered missing.
The change from baseline in CAT score will be derived at each visit relative to the baseline at 
visit 3. The percentage of patients achieving a MCID threshold for CAT of 2 units or more
will be derived at each visit, with patients with missing data considered to be non-responders.
8.4.4.4 Daily rescue medication use
The number of inhalations of rescue albuterol/salbutamol MDI will be recorded in the patient 
ePRO in the morning and evening and these summed. The mean daily number of inhalations of rescue albuterol/salbutamol MDI will be calculated overall and in time periods between 
each clinic visit. These periods will be specified in detail in the SAP. ePRO data recorded 
during the last 7 days of the screening period prior to randomisation will be used to calculate the baseline. Change from baseline in mean daily rescue (albuterol/salbutamol MDI) use will

Date 14 July 2017
91 (129)then be derived. The denominator will be adjusted based on the number of days (or half days) 
with non-missing values.
A ‘day with no rescue use’ is defined from days where rescue albuterol/salbutamol MDI usage 
data is non-missing as any day where the patient reported no inhalations of rescue albuterol/salbutamol MDI in both the morning and evening. The percentage of days with no rescue use will be derived using a denominator of the number of full days in the period with no missing data. 
8.4.4.5 EuroQol 5 Dimensions Questionnaire (EQ-5D-5L)
The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire assesses 5 dimensions which will be derived separately: 
mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression. 
The patient will also be asked to rate current health status on a visual analogue scale from 0 -
100, with 0 being the worst imaginable health state. The change from baseline in visual analogue scale will be calculated.
8.4.4.6 Healthcare Resource Utilisation (HCRU)
Broad-based health care utilization event information will be collected by the 
Investigator/authorized delegate via patient interview at each visit and recorded in the appropriate eCRF module. Examples include aspects such as physician visits or telephone calls. 
The number of moderate exacerbations (defined as those requiring antibiotics or ≥3 days of 
systemic steroids) or severe COPD exacerbations (defined as those leading to in patient hospitalisation, including >24 hours in emergency department/urgent care setting) will also be recorded.
8.4.4.7 Work Productivity and Activity Impairment – General Health (WPAI-GH)
The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment – General Health (WPAI-GH) will be 
collected. Measures summarised will include the patient’s work time missed (absenteeism), impairment at work or reduced on-the-job effectiveness (presenteeism), overall work impairment (abseentism and presenteeism, ie, work productivity loss), and activity impairment outside the work environment. The WPAI-GH outcomes are expressed as impairment percentages whereby higher scores indicate greater impairment and less productivity (ie, worse outcomes).
8.4.5 Safety and tolerability
AEs experienced by the patients will be collected throughout the entire study and will be 
coded by the AstraZeneca designee using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).

92 (129)8.5 Methods for statistical analyses
8.5.1 Analysis of the primary variable (s)
8.5.1.1 Trough FEV 1
The co-primary analysis of trough FEV 1will be conducted using the Per Protocol analysis set. 
The change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV 1will be analysed using a linear 
mixed effects model repeated measures (MMRM) approach. The model will include baseline 
FEV 1and bronchodilator responsiveness to albuterol/salbutamol MDI as continuous 
covariates and stratification factors (prior treatment - rescue/maintenance monotherapy vs 
double maintenance therapy), region, visit, treatment, and treatment by visit, as categorical 
covariates (fixed effects). Patient will be considered a random effect. Baseline is defined as the average of the non-missing -60 min and -30 min values obtained prior to dosing at Visit 3. 
An unstructured matrix will be used to model the variance-covariance structure within patient.  
If this model fit fails to converge, more parsimonious covariance structures will be considered to model correlation between time-points from the same patient. 
A contrast will be used to obtain an estimate of the treatment difference over the entire 24-
week Treatment Period with two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) and 97.5% CI. Non-inferiority will be concluded using a 1-sided hypothesis test according to a significance level 
of either 1.25% or 2.5% based upon the hierarchical testing and recycling procedure described 
in section 8.5.1.3 . This is equivalent to the lower bound of the 95% or 97.5% 2-sided 
confidence interval being greater than the pre-specified margin of -50 mL. 1-sided p-values 
will be produced accordingly.
From the same model contrasts will also be used to produce estimates of the treatment 
difference at each individual time-point (for example at week 24).
A similar analysis will be conducted in the full analysis set using all data obtained while on 
treatment. 
8.5.1.2 Peak FEV
1
The peak change from baseline in FEV 1within 2 hours post-dosing will be analysed using a 
similar MMRM model to trough FEV 1. Testing of non-inferiority between GFF and UV will 
first be conducted in the Per Protocol analysis set. The estimates of treatment difference over 24 weeks and associated 95% and 97.5% 2-sided CIs will be referred to a non-inferiority margin of -50mL.
The Full Analysis Set will be used to assess the consistency of the non-inferiority conclusion 
using all evaluable data and a similar repeated measures model. This model will then be used for the formal assessment of superiority hypotheses. Testing of non-inferiority and superiority will be at a significance level of either 1.25% or 2.5% based upon the hierarchical testing and recycling procedure described in section 8.5.1.3 . 1-sided p-values will be produced 
accordingly for both non-inferiority analyses and the superiority analysis.
Contrasts will be used to produce estimates at individual visits.

93 (129)8.5.1.3 Hierarchical testing strategy – primary endpoints
In order to strongly control the 1-sided type I error rate at 2.5% across all co-primary endpoint 
hypothesis tests and the non-inferiority hypothesis tests of the secondary endpoints a 
hierarchical testing procedure with recycling will be defined. 
To account for the multiplicity of the two co-primary endpoints, the test mass (1 sided alpha 
of 2.5%) will initially be split equally between the tests of the non-inferiority null hypothesis 
for each of trough FEV 1and peak FEV 1(1-sided alpha of 1.25% each).
Should either of these null hypotheses be rejected, the test mass will be recycled ( Burman et al 
2009 ), as described in Figure 2 . That is, after respective null hypotheses are rejected there will 
be recycling from each test as follows:
∀ from trough FEV 1non-inferiority testing to peak FEV 1non-inferiority testing
∀ from peak FEV 1non-inferiority testing to peak FEV 1superiority testing
∀ from peak FEV 1superiority testing to trough FEV 1non-inferiority testing
As such, respective hypothesis tests will be conducted at either a 1-sided 1.25% or 2.5% 
significance level depending upon this recycling.
Figure 2 Testing hierarchy for primary endpoints
NI = Non-inferiority, Sup = Superiority
Should all three null hypotheses relating to the co-primary endpoints be rejected then testing 
will proceed to the secondary endpoints using a 1-sided 2.5% significance level.

94 (129)8.5.2 Analysis of the secondary variable(s)
8.5.2.1 Hierarchical testing strategy – secondary endpointsA sequential testing hierarchy will be defined so as to strongly control 1-sided type I error at 
2.5% across all non-inferiority hypothesis tests of secondary endpoints. The secondary 
endpoints over 24 weeks will be tested against their respective non-inferiority margins in the following sequence using a 1-sided significance level of 2.5%: 
1. Peak change from baseline in Inspiratory Capacity within 2 hours post-dosing over 
24 weeks (non-inferiority with option to proceed to superiority), 
2. Proportion of patients with increase of FEV
1 of ≥100 ml from baseline at 5 minutes 
on Day 1 (superiority only), 
3. Change from baseline in TDI focal score over 24 weeks (non-inferiority only)4. Change from baseline in EMSCI  Symp tom Severity Score over 24 weeks (non-
inferiority with option to proceed to superiority),
If non-inferiority is demonstrated for an endpoint, then testing may proceed to the next 
endpoint in the hierarchy, and a superiority test of the endpoint will also be conducted in the 
full analysis set for those endpoints indicated. Proceeding to the next endpoint is not 
contingent on demonstrating superiority.
An exception to this sequential non-inferiority/superiority testing procedure is the secondary 
endpoint Onset of action (proportion of patients with increase in FEV
1 of ≥100 ml from 
baseline at 5 minutes at day 1). For this endpoint, superiority testing will immediately be carried out and superiority is required in order to move to the next step in the testing 
hierarchy.
This sequential testing hierarchy is illustrated in Figure 3 :

achieving a MCID threshold for CAT of 2 units or more at week 24
∀ Change from baseline in NiSCI symptom severity score over 24 weeks

∀ Change from baseline FEV 1AUC 0-2and FVC AUC 0-2over 24 weeks
8.5.2.2 Pulmonary Function over 24 weeks
The peak change from baseline in IC within 2 hours post-dosing will be analysed using a 
similar MMRM model to peak FEV 1. The estimates of treatment difference over 24 weeks 
will also be referred to a non-inferiority margin of -50mL.

96 (129)If non-inferiority is demonstrated in the Per Protocol analysis then the Full Analysis Set will 
be used to assess the consistency of the non-inferiority conclusion using all evaluable data and a similar repeated measures model. This model will be used for the formal assessment of superiority hypotheses and 1-sided p-values and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be produced.
Contrasts will be used to produce estimates at individual visits. Other continuous pulmonary 
function endpoints such as morning pre-dose trough and peak post-dose FVC and AUC
0-2for 
FEV 1and FVC will be analysed similarly. Estimated treatment differences will be interpreted 
using 95% CIs, but will not be formally assessed for non-inferiority.
8.5.2.3 Pulmonary Function at Day 1
On Day 1 at the assessment 5 minutes post-dosing, the proportion of patients achieving an 
improvement from baseline in FEV 1 of ≥100 ml will be estimated for each treatment. Logistic 
regression will be used to compare the treatment groups with baseline and bronchodilator responsiveness to albuterol/salbutamol MDI as continuous covariates and treatment, region and stratification factors as categorical covariates. This analysis will use the full analysis set and proceed immediately to testing of the superiority hypothesis. One-sided p-values and odds ratios with 2-sided 95% CI will be produced.
Similar analyses will be conducted at 5 minutes on day 1 using alternative thresholds (increase 
in FEV
1 of ≥150 ml from baseline and increase in FEV 1 of ≥12% from baseline).
8.5.2.4 Transition Dyspnea Index Focal Score
The difference between treatment groups in TDI over 24 weeks will be evaluated using a 
similar MMRM approach as for the co-primary endpoints. The model will include BDI (in place of baseline) and bronchodilator responsiveness as continuous covariates. Stratification factors, region, visit, treatment, and treatment by visit will be included as categorical covariates. Patient will be considered a random effect. 
One-sided p-values and point estimates with two-sided 95% CIs will be produced for the 
treatment difference over 24 weeks. Non-inferiority will be concluded if the lower bound of this confidence interval is greater than the pre-specified margin of -1.0 units (the minimum clinically important difference). Estimates of treatment difference will also be produced at each individual timepoint. A supportive analysis will also be produced using the Full Analysis Set.
The individual components of the TDI: functional impairment, magnitude of task, and 
magnitude of effort will also be summarised. Furthermore as supportive analyses, responder analyses will be performed at each visit, where responders are defined as a response of 1.0 point or more. Logistic regression will be used to compare the treatment groups with BDI as a continuous covariate and treatment group, region and stratification factors as categorical covariates. Odds ratios with 95% CIs will be produced.

Symptoms COPD Instrument (NiSCI)
The difference between treatment groups in the change from baseline in EMSCI symptom 
severity score over 24 weeks will be evaluated using a similar MMRM approach as for the co-primary endpoints. Instead of visit, the relevant time interval will be used as a categorical covariate in the model. The model will include baseline and bronchodilator responsiveness as continuous covariates and stratification factors, region, time interval, treatment, and treatment by time interval, will be included as categorical covariates. Patient will be considered a random effect. 
One-sided p-values and point estimates with two-sided 95% CIs will be produced for the 
treatment difference over 24 weeks. Non-inferiority will be concluded if the lower bound of this confidence interval is greater than the pre-specified margin of -0.1 units. Estimates of treatment difference will also be produced at each individual time-point. 
If non-inferiority is demonstrated in the Per Protocol analysis then the Full Analysis Set will 
be used to assess the consistency of the non-inferiority conclusion using all evaluable data and a similar repeated measures model. This model will be used for the formal assessment of superiority hypotheses and 1-sided p-values and 2-sided 95% confidence intervals will be produced.
Estimates of treatment differences will be produced similarly for the NiSCI symptom severity 
score. These will be interpreted using 95% CIs, but will not be formally assessed for non-inferiority. Other sub-scales and responses will be summarised descriptively by treatment group.
8.5.2.6 COPD Assessment Test (CAT) score
The difference between treatment groups in the change from baseline in CAT score over 24 
weeks will be evaluated using a similar MMRM approach as for the co-primary endpoints. Treatment differences will be interpreted using 95% CIs in relation to a non-inferiority margin 
of 2 units.
Responder analyses will be performed at each visit, where responders are defined as a 
response of 2 units or more. Logistic regression will be used to compare the treatment groups with baseline CAT score as a continuous covariates and treatment group, region and stratification factors as categorical covariates. Odds ratios with 95% CI will be produced for each treatment comparison.
8.5.2.7 Daily Rescue Medication Use
The difference between treatment groups in the change from baseline in mean daily rescue 
albuterol/salbutamol MDI use will be evaluated using a MMRM approach using the Rescue Medication User Analysis Set. Instead of visit, the relevant time interval will be used as a categorical covariate in the model. The model will include baseline and bronchodilator responsiveness as continuous covariates and stratification factors, region, time interval, treatment, and treatment by time interval, will be included as categorical covariates.

but will not be formally assessed for non-inferiority.
Additionally daytime and night-time mean albuterol/salbutamol MDI use and the percentage 
of days with ‘no rescue use’ will be evaluated and summarized. 
8.5.3 Subgroup analysis
Subgroup analyses of the co-primary endpoints will be produced according to prior treatment 
at entry (rescue therapy only, single maintenance therapy, LABA/LAMA maintenance 
therapy, LABA/ICS maintenance therapy).
Selected symptomatic endpoints will be analysed within subgroups of patients with varying 
levels of baseline symptom scores as measured by CAT.
Further subgroup analyses may be defined in the SAP.8.5.4 Interim analysis - Not applicable
No interim analyses are planned for this study.
8.5.5 Sensitivity analysis 
Although the co-primary and secondary endpoints are primarily addressed using estimates of 
the effects over 24 weeks contrasts will also be used to produce estimates at each individual visit. 
As described in Section 8.3, the co-primary analyses and all other non-inferiority analyses in 
this study will primarily be conducted using the per protocol analysis set and non-inferiority comparisons will also be conducted in the full analysis set to assess consistency when all 
patients and evaluable data are used. 
The methods used primarily in these analyses rely on the assumption that data is missing at 
random (MAR) given the covariates included in the models. Sensitivity analyses will be 
conducted to assess the robustness of conclusions to this assumption, including under Missing 
Not at Random (MNAR) scenarios. 
Multiple imputation methods will be used under varying assumptions about treatment effects 
in the unobserved data and assuming differing effects according to the patterns of missingness 
and reason for withdrawal. Full details will be given in the Statistical Analysis Plan. 
8.5.6 Safety and tolerability
All safety variables will be summarized using the safety analysis set and data presented 
according to treatment received. No hypothesis tests will be performed.
AEs will be summarized by System Organ Class and Preferred Term assigned to the event 
using MedDRA. For each PT, the number and percentage of patients reporting at least one occurrence will be presented by treatment group i.e., for a patient multiple occurrences of an

deemed causally related to IP by the Investigator will be summarised by treatment group.
8.5.7 Exploratory analysis 
The EQ-5D-5L responses from each dimension and the visual analogue scale (VAS) will be
summarised descriptively by treatment group and period. 
COPD-related and non-COPD-related health resource utilisation will be summarized by 
treatment group. The frequency and rate per year of COPD exacerbations will also be summarised.
Time to the first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation will be analysed using Cox 
regression model for the full analysis set. The model will include baseline percent predicted FEV
1, baseline CAT score, and bronchodilator responsiveness to albuterol/salbutamol MDI as 
continuous covariates and stratification factors (prior treatment - rescue/maintenance 
monotherapy vs double maintenance therap y), COPD exacerbation history, region and 
treatment as categorical covariates (fixed effects). The estimated adjusted hazard ratio for GFF 
relative to UV will be displayed along with the associated Wald two-sided 95% confidence 
interval and p-values. Time to first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation will be displayed graphically for each treatment group using a Kaplan-Meier curve. Subjects who did not 
experience a COPD exacerbation will be censored at the Week 24 visit or day 183, whichever 
is earlier. Subjects who withdrew from the study without experiencing a COPD exacerbation will be censored at the date of withdrawal.
WPAI-GH responses will be summarised using descriptive statistics by treatment group.
9. STUDY AND DATA MANAGEMENT
9.1 Training of study site personnel
Before the first patient is entered into the study, an AstraZeneca representative will review and 
discuss the requirements of the Clinical Study Protocol and related documents with the investigational staff and also train them in any study specific procedures and the ePRO, eCRF, 
IWRS/IVRS systems utilised.
The Principal Investigator will ensure that appropriate training relevant to the study is given to 
all of these staff, and that any new information relevant to the performance of this study is 
forwarded to the staff involved.
The Principal Investigator will maintain a record of all individuals involved in the study 
(medical, nursing and other staff).
9.2 Monitoring of the study
During the study, an AstraZeneca representative will have regular contacts with the study site, 
including visits to:
Clinical Study Protocol
Drug Substance Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
100 (129)∀ Provide information and support to the Investigator(s)
∀ Confirm that facilities remain acceptable
∀ Confirm that the investigational team is adhering to the Clinical Study Protocol, that 
data are being accurately and timely recorded in the CRFs and that IP accountability 
checks are being performed
∀ Perform source data verification (a comparison of the data in the CRFs with the 
patient’s medical records at the hospital or practice, and other records relevant to the study) including verification of informed consent of participating patients. This 
will require direct access to all original records for each patient (e.g., clinic charts)
The AstraZeneca representative will be available between visits if the Investigator(s) or other 
staff at the site needs information and advice about the study conduct.
9.2.1 Risk based quality management
Quality by design will be implemented, including a focus on identifying key risks to patient 
safety, data quality, and GCP/regulatory compliance. A risk based approach to monitoring will 
be applied. A mix of monitoring strategies will be implemented: on-site monitoring, remote 
monitoring (site level monitoring activities performed at a location other than the research site) and centralized monitoring systems. Monitoring strategies will be tailored to risks, permit 
timely oversight (through central/remote monitoring and use of technology), and will be 
focused on Critical Processes and Critical Data.
Central monitoring will be used to check that data is consistent and complete, identify unusual 
distribution of data, identify higher risk sites to target additional monitoring, and to ensure 
routine review of data is completed in real time.
9.2.2 Source data
The location of source data is defined in the Clinical Study Agreement. The Principal 
Investigator must provide direct access to source data/documents for study-related monitoring, 
audits, IRB/IEC review, and regulatory inspection.
9.2.3 Study agreements
The Principal Investigator at each/the site should comply with all the terms, conditions, and 
obligations of the Clinical Study Agreement, or equivalent, for this study.  In the event of any 
inconsistency between this Clinical Study Protocol and the Clinical Study Agreement, the terms of Clinical Study Protocol shall prevail with respect to the conduct of the study and the 
treatment of patients and in all other respects, not relating to study conduct or treatment of 
patients, the terms of the Clinical Study Agreement shall prevail.
Agreements between AstraZeneca and the Principal Investigator should be in place before any 
study-related procedures can take place, or patients are enrolled.

The Investigator follows the principles outlined in the Clinical Study Agreement (CSA).
9.3 Study timetable and end of study
The study is expected to start in Q2 2017 and to end by Q3 2018. The end of the study is 
defined as ‘the last visit of the last patient undergoing the study’.
The expected recruitment period is 6-8 months and AstraZeneca will notify Investigators 
when recruitment is complete.
The study may be terminated at individual sites if the study procedures are not being 
performed according to GCP, or if recruitment is slow.  AstraZeneca may also terminate the entire study prematurely if concerns for safety arise within this study or in any other study 
with GFF.
9.4 Data management by AstraZeneca 
Data management will be performed by AstraZeneca Data Management Centre staff at 
Cognizant, according to the Data Management Plan .
The data collected through third party sources will be obtained and reconciled against study 
data.
AEs and medical/surgical history will be classified according to the terminology of the latest 
version the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA).  Medications will be 
classified according to the WHO Drug Dictionary.  All coding will be performed by the Medical Coding Team at the AstraZeneca Data Management Centre.
Data queries will be raised for inconsistent, impossible or missing data.  All entries to the 
study database will be available in an audit trail.
The data will be validated as defined in the Data Management Plan.  Quality control 
procedures will be applied to each stage of data handling to ensure that all data are reliable 
and have been processed correctly.  The Data Management Plan will also clarify the roles and responsibilities of the various functions and personnel involved in the data management 
process.
When all data have been coded, validated, signed and locked, clean file will be declared.  Any 
treatment revealing data may thereafter be added and the final database will be locked.
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Reconciliation
SAE reconciliation reports are produced and reconciled with the Patient Safety database and 
eCRF.

108 (129)Appendix A Additional Safety Information
Further Guidance on the Definition of a Serious Adverse Event (SAE)
Life threatening‘Life-threatening’ means that the patient was at immediate risk of death from the AE as it 
occurred or it is suspected that use or continued use of the product would result in the patient’s 
death.  ‘Life-threatening’ does not mean that had an AE occurred in a more severe form it 
might have caused death (e.g., hepatitis that resolved without hepatic failure).
Hospitalisation
Outpatient treatment in an emergency room is not in itself a serious AE, although the reasons 
for it may be (e.g., bronchospasm, laryngeal oedema).  Hospital admissions and/or surgical 
operations planned before or during a study are not considered AEs if the illness or disease existed before the patient was enrolled in the study, provided that it did not deteriorate in an 
unexpected way during the study.
Important medical event or medical intervention
Medical and scientific judgement should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious in 
situations where important medical events may not be immediately life threatening or result in 
death, hospitalisation, disability or incapacity but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
medical intervention to prevent one or more outcomes listed in the definition of serious.  These should usually be considered as serious.
Simply stopping the suspect drug does not mean that it is an important medical event; medical 
judgement must be used.
∀ Angioedema not severe enough to require intubation but requiring iv hydrocortisone 
treatment
∀ Hepatotoxicity caused by paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose requiring treatment 
with N-acetylcysteine
∀ Intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm
∀ Blood dyscrasias (e.g., neutropenia or anaemia requiring blood transfusion, etc.) or 
convulsions that do not result in hospitalisation
Development of drug dependency or drug abuse
A Guide to Interpreting the Causality Question
When making an assessment of causality consider the following factors when deciding if there 
is a ‘reasonable possibility’ that an AE may have been caused by the drug.
Clinical Study Protocol Appendix A
Drug Substance Glycopyrronium/Formoterol Fumarate
Study Code D5970C00002Version 2
Date 14 July 2017
109 (129)∀ Time Course.  Exposure to suspect drug.  Has the patient actually received the suspect 
drug?  Did the AE occur in a reasonable temporal relationship to the administration of 
the suspect drug?
∀ Consistency with known drug profile.  Was the AE consistent with the previous 
knowledge of the suspect drug (pharmacology and toxicology) or drugs of the same 
pharmacological class? Or could the AE be anticipated from its pharmacological properties?
∀ De-challenge experience.  Did the AE resolve or improve on stopping or reducing the 
dose of the suspect drug?
∀ No alternative cause.  The AE cannot be reasonably explained by another aetiology 
such as the underlying disease, other drugs, other host or environmental factors.
∀ Re-challenge experience.  Did the AE reoccur if the suspected drug was reintroduced 
after having been stopped? AstraZeneca would not normally recommend or support a 
re-challenge.
∀ Laboratory tests.  A specific laboratory investigation (if performed) has confirmed the 
relationship.
In difficult cases, other factors could be considered such as:
∀ Is this a recognized feature of overdose of the drug?
∀ Is there a known mechanism?
Causality of ‘related’ is made if following a review of the relevant data, there is evidence for a 
‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship for the individual case.  The expression ‘reasonable possibility’ of a causal relationship is meant to convey, in general, that there are 
facts (evidence) or arguments to suggest a causal relationship.
The causality assessment is performed based on the available data including enough 
information to make an informed judgment.  With limited or insufficient information in the 
case, it is likely that the event(s) will be assessed as ‘not related’.
Causal relationship in cases where the disease under study has deteriorated due to lack of 
effect should be classified as no reasonable possibility

Version V1.0  3 Introduction  
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted 
according to US  (21 CFR Part 812)  and international standards of Good Clinical 
Practice (International  Conference on Harmonization ICH -E6, ISO 14155 and other 
applicable government regulations, and Institutional research policies and procedures ).  
3.1 Background  
Sleep is a necessary component of good health and comprises about one- third of a 
human life.  The average person sleeps about 3000 hours per year; thus, the 
importance of sleep should not be underestimated.  Adequate quantity and quality of 
sleep is essential to most psychological and physiological processes.  Obstructive sleep 
apnea (OSA) is a common and serious condition that impairs sleep and can 
compromise an individual’s health.      
OSA can be characterized by a periodic full closure or partial obstr uction in the upper 
airway due to neurological and/or anatomical features factors including micro-  and 
retrognathia and impaired neuromodulation to the upper airway.  Risk factors also 
include obesity, male, or post -menopausal females, age, neck size, and upper airway 
malformations such as deviated septum (Epstein, et al., 2009; Kapur, 2010).  The 
obstruction or upper airways resistance results in cyclical reductions in blood oxygen, 
increased work  of breathing, and arousals (cortical and sympathetic) from sleep.  These 
sequelae may in turn have short - or long -term results such as insulin resistance, type 
two diabetes, stroke, incident coronary heart disease in men, neurocognitive deficits, 
and hypertension.  Along with damage to health, these conditions  may and also have 
significant negative  workplace and economic consequences (Gottlieb et al., 2010; 
Marin, et al., 2005; Redeker &  McEnany, 2011; Redline et al., 2010; Rosekind, et al., 
2010; Yaggi;, 2005).  
Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is the most often frequently prescribed 
therapy for OSA.  CPAP provides a pneumatic splint to the upper airway, thus 
preventing closure due to critical closing pressure.  Other therapeutic options include 
oral appliances, surgical procedures, and, most recently, expiratory positive airway 
pressure (EPAP) devices (Provent K071560; K080983; K090398; K102404, Theravent, 
San Jose).   
While CPAP is considered the therapy of choice, adherence to short -term (acclim ation) 
and long -term therapy remains problematic (Somers, Peterson, Sharma &  Yaramchuc, 
2011).  Rates of adherence, defined as usage of at least 4 hours for 70 percent of the 
nights, are reported to average between 30% and 60%; one study found that 31% of 
their population did not fill their prescription for CPAP (Sin, Mayer, Man &  Pawluk, 2002; 
Wolkove, Baltzan, Kamel, Dabrusin & Palayew, 2008).  Thus there is still an opportunity 
to improve therapeutic targets for patients with OSA.  
Expiratory positive air way pressure (EPAP) is such a therapeutic target.  Data support 
the use of the EPAP for the treatment of OSA.  At least two potential mechanisms of 
action have been suggested. One of these is increased functional residual capacity,

Version V1.0  which produces tracheal traction, resulting in lessened propensity for upper 
airway/pharyngeal collapse. An alternative mechanism is passive dilation of the airway, 
which reduces flow limitation (Braga, Chen, Burschtin, Rapoport  & Ayappa, 2011; 
Colrain, Brooks &  Black, 2008; Heinzer et al., 2008; Owens et al., 2012; Rosenthal, 
Massie, Dolan, Loomas, Kram & Hart, 2009; Walsh et al., 2011).   
The Provent device provides for an “unimpeded flow of air during inhalation, but closes 
so that exhalation occurs against a fixed orifice”  thus creating EPAP  (Rosenthal, et al, 
2009).  The Provent device is comprised of two nasal inserts which are affixed to the 
nares via adhesive, each containing an actuated valve. Several studies provide the 
long-term (up to 12 months) effect iveness of Provent versus sham devices in 
multicenter trial with up to 250 subjects enrolled.  These studies demonstrated an 
effective therapeutic approach in reducing the apnea hypopnea values (Berry et al ., 
2010;Kryger, et al ., 2011).  These studies furt her demonstrated that no serious adverse 
events occurred over the span of the study.  
The BONGO NASAL  EPAP device was developed to provide similar principals of 
operation and is  posited to be substantially equivalent  to the Provent device. This 
mechanism provides for m inimal inhale resistance and controlled exhale resistance 
which increases  expiratory  airway pressure upon exhalation  as noted above.  
The Bongo differs from the Provent in that it is reusable, does not use adhesive, and 
seals against the openin g of the nares instead of the outer edges of the nares and nose.  
During product development, bench testing was conducted on the Bongo, including age 
testing, environmental testing (high temperature, low temperature, and humidity ), cycle 
testing, drop testing, and cleaning testing. Comparative testing against the Provent 
device was  also conducted including inhale resistance testing and exhalation flow rate 
testing.  
3.2 Investigational Product Description  
The BONGO NASAL EPAP device consists of two nasal inserts (a connected pair), 
each containing an actuated valve, with a  patient attachment mechanism.  The device 
works by providing an inhalation port that offers minimal inhale resistance during 
inhalation,  but is closed by the actuated valve so that exhalation occurs against a fixed 
orifice.  This mechanism provides increased EPAP upon exhalation . 
The design incorporates elements of the currently marketed Nasal -Aire II (K022465).  
The Nasal -Aire II is a nas al interface that delivers  positive pressure from the CPAP 
machine to the patient.  The materials to be used in the investigational product are 
similar to those  in the currently marketed product.  Like t he Nasal -Aire II , the Bongo will  
seal against the nar es.

The Bongo is made  of silicone and polypropylene.  A total of four ( 4) nasal insert sizes 
(SM, MD, LG, and XL) will be available during this study.  Subjects will fit  the most 
appropriate size for comfort during the first clinic visit .  A total of two ( 2) valves with 
different resistances (R1 and R2) will be available during this study. Each nasal insert 
size will have the capability to use each resistor for a total of 8 variations (e.g. Nasal 
Insert MD will have R1 and R2 options).  
4 Study Overview  
4.1 Study Objectives  
The objective for this study is  to provide the data required for inclusion within a pre -
market notification (510k) submission. The study design and end points have previously 
been discussed  with the Food and Drug Administrat ion.

Version V1.0  4.2 Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint for the study is change in AHI, defined as the difference in AHI 
between the diagnostic study and PSG 2 with the Bongo. A reduction in AHI to less than 
10 or an  AHI reduction by at least 50% from the baseline is considered clinically 
significant.  
5 Study  Design and Procedural  Detail  
5.1 Study Outline and Design  
This study is a prospective, non- randomized, open label, single -center clinical study for 
the BONGO NASAL EPAP device for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea.  
 
Subjects will have the following study schedule:  
1. Screening  
2. In-lab PSG 1 with the Bongo  
3. 2 week at home use of the Bongo  
4. In-lab PSG 2 with the Bongo  
5. Study termination visit (may be completed the morning following PSG 2)  
5.2 Subject Recruitment and Screening  
Subjects will be recruited from existing patient rolls within the participating sleep center .  
The patient rolls provide the first line of screening f or inclusion criteria and exclusion 
criteria.  Phone screening  will be conducted to further assess meeting  the inclusion 
criteria and exclusion criteria (e.g. do they use a full face mask or are they mouth 
breathers). Additional screening will be conducted during the screening  visit.  Data 
obtained from screening will not be retained and the site will follow their standard 
procedures for destroying the data.  
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects  
Subjects will not be randomized for this study  
5.4 Concomitant Therapy  
Subjects will take their medications as normal  
5.5 Blinding of Study  
This study is open- label  
6 Screening and Visits  
6.1 Screening/Baseline  
Subjects will be first phone screened using existing patient rolls at each individual sleep 
center. Subjects who meet the initial  qualifications will be asked to attend an in- clinic 
visit ( Screening Visit).   
 
InnoM ed Healthscience 
INN-C003

Page 12 of 27 
Version V1.0  During this Screening Visit the following will occur:  
• Informed Consent Process 
• Subjects will be asked to bring their CPAP /APAP machines and/or their data card 
for downloading and review.  The following data from the past 30 days will be 
downloaded: pressure setting, average hours of use per night, % of time used, 
and residual AHI.  If the subject has no data on their data card over this time 
period, and/or the subject has been di agnosed and is unable or willing to use 
CPAP, this will be noted on their record.  
• Subjects will fit for the nasal inserts : 
o Subjects will s elect the size of the BONGO  according to Bongo IFU  
o Subjects will be allowed a minimum of 10 minutes of acclimation with the 
valve R1; ensure that subject has some “supine” time  during the 
acclimation period.  
o Subjects will be asked on a scale of 1- 10 where their tolerability level of 
the device resides (<5, not qualified; ≥5, will qualify to move ahead) .  
• Once a subject is deemed eligible to participate, b aseline measurements 
including BMI, vital signs, medications, and the above measures  will be recorded.   
6.2 PSG Studies  
Two in -lab PSG studies will be performed  while using the Bongo device. PSG 1 will be 
performed on a separate visit after  the Screening Visit. PSG 2 will be performed after a 
two week (14 day) period of at home use with the Bongo.  
 
Sites will follow the standard sleep protocol methods that include patient preparation 
procedures, the standard r ecording montage, the proper instrument calibration and bio-
calibration procedures that must precede the initiation o f the collection of the PSGs 
according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) Manual for Scoring 
Sleep and Associated Events (2007), a standard PSG montage, recording channel 
labels and the order to be used will be:  
• left electrooculogram  (E1/M2)  
• rightelectrooculogram (E2/M1)  
• submental electromyogram (chin1/chin2)  
• submental electromyogram (chin2/chin3)  
• electroencephalogram  (C3/M2) 
• electroencephalogram (O2/M1)  
• electroencephalogram (F4/M1)  
• electroencephalogram (C4/M1)

• nasal/oral nasal air pressur e transducer (PFLOW),  
• oxygen saturation (SaO2)  
• left  anterior tibialis electromyogram (L LEG)  
• right anterior tibialis electromyogram (R LEG)  
Prior to each PSG, the site will screen the subject for acute alcohol intoxication by 
obtaining a breath alc ohol test or equivalent. If testing shows any evidence of recent 
alcohol use, then the subject will be sent home after being counseled to refrain from 
alcohol use and return to the site within one week for the PSG.  Subjects will be allowed 
no more than two attempts to participate if they are intoxicated upon arrival to the sleep 
clinic .  
In addition, prior to each PSG, the site will call the subject to remind them of the 
upcoming PSG, they will be asked if they have any current cold or nasal condition which 
would prevent them from attending. At the time of the PSG, the research staff will 
assess the subject for  nasal infection, nasal congestion,  or nasal allergies  that may 
impact the ability of the subject to breathe through the nose. If observation shows any 
evidence of nasal infection, nasal congestion, or nasal  allergies, then the subject will be 
sent home and asked to return to the  site after the symptoms have resolved.  
A standard type pre (PM) sleep questionnaire will also be completed at a PSG visit . This 
questionnaire will assess the subjects day of test activity . 
To record data during a PSG with the Bongo, a sampling tube connec ting the nasal 
insert to the pressure transducer is used.  Each nasal insert has a sampling  port for 
connecting a sampling tube.   The sample tubes  and instructions for use will be supplied 
by InnoMed to the site  for this purpose.  
 
During  PSG 1:  
1. Subjects may sleep in the position that is the most comfortable for them . 
2. All subjects will begin with the R1 valve in place.   
3. Subjects will sleep with the R1 valve  until the completion of one REM cycle. 
Calculate the AHI at this time.  
a. If the AHI is  below 10 (AHI < 10), maintain the R1 valve . 
b. If the AHI equals or exceeds 10 (AHI ≥ 10), change to the R2 valve  for the 
remainder of PSG 1.  
4. Continue to calculate the running AHI of subjects that remained on the R1.  
a. If the running AHI equals or exceeds 10 (AHI ≥  10), change to the R2  
valve  for the remainder of PSG 1 .

Version V1.0  5. At the end of PSG 1 and prior to the subject leaving the facility:  
a. Calculate and r ecord the AHI for the overall  time the R1 valve was used.  
b. If applicable, also calculate and record the AHI for the overall  time the R2 
valve was used. ( Note that the AHI for R1 and R2 should not be 
combined) .

Version V1.0   
Prior to the subject leaving the facility, the research staff will need to score and assess 
whether the subject qualifies for the at home portion of the study.  Score using the 
AASM 3% and/or arousal criteria.  
 
1. Compare R1 AHI , as well as the R2 AHI (if app licable) , to the subject's  baseline AHI 
(from their diagnostic study).  
2. If the subject while using the Bongo had an AHI reduction to less than 10 (AHI < 10) 
or an AHI reduction by at least 50% (AHI reduction ≥ 50%) compared to  the baseline, 
then the subject qualifies for the at home portion of the study.  
a. Send the subject home with either the R1 or R2 valve only, whichever  valve 
the subject had the lowest AHI with.  
3. If the subject did not have the AHI reductions described above with either valve, then 
that subject will be terminated from the remainder of the study . 
 
Subjects that qualif y for the at home portion of the study will continue using the Bongo 
at home for two weeks . Subjects will complete a daily use log while using the Bongo at 
home.  
Enrollment will continue until such time a total of up to 10 subjects have completed all 
components of the study.  
In preparation for the home use portion of the study, t he site will: 
• Remove the sampling tubes from the Bongo and cover the Bongo sampling por ts 
with caps provided by InnoMed prior to the subject going home  
• Subjects will be provided with the instructions for use.  
• Instruct the subject to call the si te if any adverse events are experienced.  
After two weeks  (14 days)  of at home use with the Bongo, the subjects will return with 
their Bongo unit  and daily use log to the site for PSG 2 . PSG 2 should be conducted no 
later than three days  (14+3 days ) after the end of the at home use portion of the study.  
 
During  PSG 2 :  
1. All subjects will use  either the R1 or the R2 valve (the same device) that they 
have been using during the at home use period for the entirety  of PSG 2.  
2. Subjects may sleep in the position that is the most comfortable for them.  
3. Calculate and record the AHI for the overall  time.  
 
Score using the AASM 3% and/or arousal criteria. PSG 2 s tudies to be scored no more 
than 3 days following the PSG 2.

8 Statistical Plan  
The primary aim of this study is to assess objective sleep parameters while sleeping 
with the BONGO NASAL EPAP device (Test product).  The primary endpoint to be 
evaluated is AHI  compared to baseline data. Baseline demographic will  be summarized 
and reported. For continuous variables such as weight, the mean, standard deviation 
and range will be presented. For categorical variables such as gender, the proportion of 
subjects in each category will be presented.   Descriptive statistics  for sleep study data 
will be reported.  
8.1 Sample Size  
Up to 20 subjects may be enrolled in the study  with a targeted number up to 10 subjects 
who complete the study  and are deemed evaluable. A study with 10 subjects was 
proposed and accepted by the FDA for  the data required for inclusion within a  pre-
market notification (510k) submission for the Bongo.

Version V1.0  9 Subject Compliance Monitoring 
Compliance for subject participation will be assessed at each visit.  
9.1 Early Withdrawal of Subjects  
Although early withdrawal of subjects is not anticipated, for subject s who withdraw prior 
to completion of their participation, data collected to date will be included.  If the 
withdrawal is due to  medical reasons , appropriate referral to their primary care 
physician will be done.  
9.1.1  When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
A subject may withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.  Explanation of 
such rights will be given to the subject during the informed consent process, both 
verbally and in writing.  If subjects decide that they no longer wish to participate in  the 
study, they will be asked to return for a final visit. If they are unable to comply with this 
request, a study termination letter will be sent to their given address. A request for the 
study documents will be made.  
9.1.2  Data Collection and Follow -up for W ithdrawn Subjects  
Data will cease to be collected upon subject withdrawal of informed consent ; however , 
data collected until the time of withdrawal will be used as appropriate and will be 
reported in the clinical study report.  
10 Risk s/Benefits  
Risks  
Known ri sks include : 
• Breach of confidentiality.  It is possible that information regarding subjects’ clinical or 
laboratory evaluations will be discovered by individuals outside of study personnel, 
despite careful steps to protect confidentiality.  
• Polysomnography : Some subjects experience mild skin irritation from electrode 
preparation solution, electrode adhesive, or solvents used to remove electrodes.  
These materials can also cause eye irritation if they come into contact with the eyes. 
This is a standard test for ascertaining sleep disorders in clinical practice and is 
widely used. Sleeping within a laboratory setting may produce psychological 
discomfort for some subjects.  
• Subjects may feel some psychological discomfort just by the fact that they are 
participat ing in research. Such concerns include confidentiality and privacy, clinical 
intervention or tests adverse effects from the investigational product.  
Possible Anticipated Device adverse events include : 
• Headache  
• Sinus Allergy  
• Irritation of the nares from the nasal inserts

11 Safety and Adverse Events  
11.1 Definitions  
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others  
Any incident, experience, or outcome that meets all  of the following criteria:  
• Unexpected in nature, severity, or frequency  (i.e. not described in study -related 
documents such as the IRB -approved protocol or consent form, the investigators 
brochure, etc …) 
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research  (i.e. possibly related 
means there is a reasonable possibility that the incident experience, or outcome 
may have been caused by the procedures involved in the research)  
• Suggests that the research places subjects or others at greater risk of harm  
(including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm).  
 
Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect  
An Unanticipated Adverse Device Effect is any serious adverse effect on health or 
safety, or any life- threatening problem or death caused by or associated with a p roduct , 
if that effect, problem, or death was not previously identified in nature, severity, or 
degree of incidence in the investigational plan or application (including a supplementary 
plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious probl em associated with a 
product  that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects.  
 
Serious injury  
Any injury or illness that is any one of the following:  
• life-threatening  
• results in permanent impairment of a body function or permanent damage to body 
structure  
• necessitates medical or surgical intervention to preclude permanent impairment of 
a body function or permanent damage to a body structure  
 
Adverse Event  
An adverse event  (AE) is any symptom, sign, illness or experience that develops or 
worsens in severity during the course of the study.  Intercurrent illnesses or injuries 
should be regarded as adverse events.  Abnormal results of diagnostic procedures are 
considered to be adverse events if the abnormality:  
• results in study withdrawal  
• is associated with a serious adverse Product  effect  
• is associated with clinical signs or symptoms  
• leads to additional treatment or to further diagnostic tests  
• is considered by the investigator to be of clinical significance

Version V1.0  11.2 Recording of Adverse Device Effects 
At each contact  with the subject, adverse events will be assessed. Data will be 
documented on an adverse event form and the subject chart.  Any and all clearly study 
related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic procedures results should be 
recorded in the source document ; however, events related to each other should be 
grouped under one diagnosis.  
 
All adverse Product  effects occurring during the study period will be recorded.  The 
clinical course of each event will be followed until resolution or stabilization or until it has 
been determined that the study treatment or participation is not the cause.  Serious 
adverse Product  effects that are still ongoing at the end of the study period will be 
followed to determine the final outcome.  Any serious adverse Product  effects that occur 
after the study period should be recorded and reported promptly (see section 8.3 
below).

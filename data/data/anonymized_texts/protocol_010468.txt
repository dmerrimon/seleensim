 PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
Title:  Randomized, Controlled Dietary Treatment Study of Pediatric NAFLD  
 
Summary:  This is a multisite, randomized, controlled, 8 -week outpatient feeding study at 
Emory University and University of California, San Diego . Participant s will be 
non-diabetic male adolescents with biopsy -proved NAFLD . Two groups of 20 
participant s will be followed for 8 weeks with hepatic fat content assessed by 
MRI PDFF  at we eks 0, 4, and 8. One group will be a standard of care control to 
track the naturally -occurring changes in hepat ic fat content in children over 
time. The other group will be provided with a low free sugars  (<3%  total daily 
calories ) version of their habitual diets. The primary outcome is % change in 
MRI PDFF  over time in the treatment group  compared to the control g roup. 
Additional parameters of liver function and metabolic status (e.g., serum ALT) 
will also be assessed.

 2 INTRODUCTION: BACKGROUND INFORMATI ON AND SCIENTIFIC 
RATIONALE  
2.1 Background Information  
The field of pediatric nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has grown exponentially 
over the past decade in response to the growth of the disease and increased awareness 
of this important liver disease.  NAFLD is now the most common liver disease for both 
adults and children in the US and is estimated to affect more than 20 million persons1, 2.  
It is a chronic liver disease closely associated with the metabolic syndrome, although its 
role as cause, effect or innocent bystander has yet to be defined3-9.  NAFLD is an 
umbrella t erm and it is histologically categorized into nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL), 
defined as hepatic steatosis (fat) without hepatocellular injury and nonalcoholic 
steatohepatitis (NASH), defined as hepatic fat plus hepatocellular injury with or without 
fibrosis10.   
In the US, Mexican- Americans are the group most affected by NAFLD and it is estimated 
that 1 of 4 Mexican American adults has NAFLD 1. Hispanic -Americans are 2.5 t imes 
more likely to have NAFLD compared to African Americans2, 11, 12.  Liver disease is the 
6th leading cause of death for Hispanic adults compared to 12th for the general 
population13, 14. NAFLD increases the risk of liver disease but also increases risk of type 
II diabetes, cardiovascular disease (CVD) and the metabolic syndrome15-20.  For 
exampl e, a person with NAFLD and fibrosis has 2.5 –  3.5 times the risk of 
cardiovascular disease death and increased risk of type II diabetes compared to a 
similarly overweight person without NAFLD (reviewed in Armstrong et al21). An estimated 
1/3 of adults with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a more severe form of NAFLD, 
will go on to develop cirrhosis and liver cancer22 and it is the most rapidly increasing 
reason for liver transplan ts in adults. The morbidity and mortality of NAFLD, along with 
its high prevalence in a vulnerable population make NAFLD a public health priority23.   
In a healthy person, almost no fat (<5% of the liver by volume) is stored in t he liver, 
despite the fact that the liver is a major site of metabolism for dietary fat, cholesterol, 
triglyceride, free fatty acids and more.  NAFLD develops when the balance of triglyceride 
metabolism in the liver becomes dysregulated in the setting of i nsulin resistance (IR).  
Triglyceride rich lipoproteins either originate in the intestine or liver and the sources of 
fatty acids used for lipoprotein assembly are derived either from de novo lipogenesis 
(DNL), the diet or from the plasma pool of nonesteri fied FA (NEFA)24.  Hepatic DNL 
appears to underlie the mechanism of excess hepatic storage of triglyceride during 
carbohydrate feeding in individuals with NAFLD24-26.  Compared to subjects with 
metabolic syndrome and no increased hepatic fat, subjects with NAFLD have 3 fold 
higher rates o f DNL in addition to higher plasma levels of FFA during the nighttime25.  
The mechanisms of NASH, in which hepatic fat is associated with inflammation and 
hepatocellular injury are complex but likely involve lipotoxicity and increased oxidative 
stress.   
 
10 
 Because of the high level of consumption and its metabolic fate, fructose has been 
studied in relation to many health problems, including NAFLD. Fructose was initially 
linked to steatosis and NAFLD in animal models but more recently, a number of human 
studies have demonstrated links. Fructose enters the diet primarily from sugars that are 
in processed food and beverages, often referred to as added sugars.  The World Health 
Organization (WHO) has provided a draft of guidelines on sugar consumption and has 
clarified the term “f ree sugars ” which includes all monosaccharides (fructose, glucose, 
galactose) and disaccharides (sucrose, maltose, trehalose) which are added to the foods 
by the manufacturer, the cook, or the cons umer.  The “free sugars” category includes 
naturally occurring sugars in honey, fruit juices, and syrups and excludes  sugars from 
fruits, vegetables or the lactose from dairy. Naturally occurring sources of fructose 
include fruit and vegetables, but only account for a small percentage of fructose in the 
diet27. In the U.S., added sugar consumption rose over most of the past century 27, 28 until 
the 2000’s when consumption of sugar sweetened beverages began to decline29. Recent 
estimates indicate a slightly declined consumption of total added sugar, fructose, and 
sugar sweetened beverages29-32. Even with this decline, the amount of added sugars, 
and thus the  amount of fructose,  in the typical US diet remains elevated at ~16% of total 
calories, which exceeds the upper recommendation of 5- 10%33.   
 
Fructose is absorbed from the lower part of duodenum and jejunum both passively and 
actively primarily through GLUT5. After absorption across the brush border of the small 
intestine into the portal blood supply, fructose is cleared from the blood in the liver on the 
first pass and almost exclusiv ely metabolized in hepatocytes.  Most absorbed fructose is 
cleaved into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and these trioses further 
go to glycerol phosphate and pyruvate metabolic pathways, promoting gluconeogenesis 
and DNL, respectively. It is this stimulation of DNL that has been studied closely and 
may be a critical environmental contributor to NAFLD.  When compared with a isocaloric 
diet with the same macronutrient distribution, a fructose containing diet (25% of calories) 
was associated with both higher DNL and higher li ver fat in a short term study of healthy 
adults34.   
 
NAFLD patients have been found to be high consumers of fructose.  In a cross -sectional 
analysis, Quyang et al. found a 2 -3 fold increase of fructose consumption in patients with 
biopsy -proven NAFLD as compared to their sex, age, and BMI matched controls35. A 
longitudinal study in obese adol escents indicated that energy -adjusted fructose intake 
was independently associated with NAFLD during a 3 -year follow up36.  And fructose 
may be associated with the severity of NAFLD. For example, work by Abdelmalek et al. 
reported a significant association between fructose intake and fibrosis severity in a 
cohort of 427 adults with histologically -confirmed NAFLD 37.   
 
There are a few small studies demonstrating improvement in features of NAFLD with 
fructose reduction but this is an area that deserves more research. In a randomized 
controlled trial, 4 -week fructose restriction in children with NAFLD improved their 
adipose insulin sensitivity, high sensitivity C- reactive protein (hs -CRP), and LDL 
 
11 
 oxidation; whereas their liver enzymes and intrahepatic fat remained unchanged 38. Over 
a longer intervention as of 6 months, improvement of liver enzyme was seen wi th 
lowering dietary component of fructose and glycemic load in NAFLD subjects 39. Finally, 
a recently reported 10 day study in children on a fructose- free diet demonstrated a 20 
percent drop in liver fat.  
 
Of note, while the studies above isolated fructose as the dietary component being 
evaluated, in real life, most fructose in the di et is from added sugars. Thus, while 
fructose is important to evaluate for the mechanism of effect,  added sugars are a human 
health relevant environmental exposure that is being considered in this study.   
 
Another technology utilized in this protocol is magnetic resonance imaging- estimated 
liver proton density fat fraction (MRI -estimated liver PDFF) fo r the measurement of 
hepatic fat.  This is a research technology that is not yet clinically available, but has 
recently been validated for use in children and is highly beneficial because it can be 
used instead of a liver biopsy to measure hepatic fat40.  In the validation study, MRI -
estimated liver PDFF was used to measure hepatic steatosis and was compared this to 
histopathologic grading in 174 c hildren with a mean age of 14 years (range 8 to 16  
years)41. All the children completed the MRI acquisition protocol without difficulty 
demonstrating the feasibility of MR -based steat osis measurements in young children.  
The correlation of the MRI -estimated liver PDFF with the pathology assigned steatosis 
grade was very good (0.725)41.  Further, it is a precise, l ow risk technology42. No MRI 
contrast is required and the scan time can be brief (~15 minutes) thus making MRI PDFF 
ideal for measuring hepatic fat in this research protocol.  
 
In summary, free sugars  are associated with severity of NAFLD and may be an 
important environmental cause of increased DN L leading to hepatic steatosis.  In this 
proposal, we will test the effect of a low “free sugars” (<3% total daily calories) diet in  
children with biopsy -proven NAFLD using innovative, low risk, non- invasive tools like  
MRI for hepatic fat measurement.   
2.2 Justification    
Before designing  a large RCT it is prudent to first test effect size of reducing sugar in 
male children wit h a history of NAFLD on hepatic fat, ALT, and other markers in a  
smaller, randomized, controlled study.  
Population studies demonstrate that NAFLD is more than twice as likely in boys 
compared to girls2, 11.  In the recently completed NIH sponsored NASH randomized, 
controlled trial, XX% of the subjects enrolled were boys, despite best efforts to increase 
recruitment of girls.  Puberty is a strong modifier of NAFLD severity43.  Girls undergo 
puberty earlier than boys.  Together, these  effects could confound the study  results 
because more girls would be in later stages of puberty compared to the boys.  
Increasing the sample size would allow for subgroup analysis and controlling for sex, 
however budget constraints did not allow for a larger cohort.  Thus, the study was 
 
12 
 designed with boys alone, excluding girls.  There are limitations of including only boys 
including that it makes the study less generalizable.  This will hopefully be addressed by 
proceeding with a larger, longer trial including both sexes justified by the data of this 
initial study.   
2.3 Potential Risks and Benefits  
2.3.1 Potential Risks  
There is minimal risk in this  study . Potential risks are related to 1)  the MRI PDFF 2) 
blood draws, 3) NPO status, 4) cumulative blood loss, 5) confidentiality and 6) diet 
low in free sugars .   
1) MRI PDFF  – Some children may find the MRI examination to be a fear invoking one.  
These will be done at a research imaging facility where the staff is experienced in 
working with children.  The MRI scanner also  has movies for improving the 
experience.  
2) The placement of an intravenous catheter and drawing of blood specimens has 
minimal risk of dis comfort, bruising, or bleeding.  There is minimal ri sk of infection or 
extravasation. Experienced staff with pediatric expertise will place all catheters and 
draw blood.  
3) Patients will remain NPO from 8 pm the evening before the study until the fasting 
portion of the study is concluded.  Some children may bec ome agitated with NPO 
status.  Blood sugar will be monitored at the beginning of the study and water will be 
encouraged to maintain hydration. Each participant  will be asked to drink one glass 
of water at bedtime prior to the study and one glass in the morning before leaving  
home for the research center. Food and water will be provided immediately following 
the conclusion of fasting visits  
4) Blood loss: During the study visits, blood will be drawn from an  indwelling IV at 19  
time-points. To minimize risk to th e patient, we will limit amounts in accordance with 
the guidelines of our IRB and the NIH. The total blood volume drawn over the course 
of the study will be 97 mL. We expect all of our patients to be >37 kg making these 
amounts well within the NIH clinical  center guidelines recommending less than 
3ml/kg at a single research visit and no more than 7ml/kg over any 6 week period.   
5) There is a small risk of loss of confidentiality.  We will follow all procedures required 
by respective institutions  to protect participant s. Efforts will be made to ensure that 
all personal information remains confidential.  All data will be stored in locked offices 
and password- protected computers.  Personal identity will be protected in any 
publication.  
6) Potential risks of a low “fre e sugars” diet : sugar is not a required nutrient but it is 
known to have s ome addictive qualities. Elimination of “ free sugar s” in the diet may 
at first result in cravings of sugar and this is expected to fade over 2- 3 weeks.   
 
13 
 2.3.2 Potential Benefits  
The proposed research has substantial potential benefits for children. Sugar is known to 
increase adiposity in children over time and even a short reduction of 8 weeks is likely to 
have benefits from a BMI and cardiovascular standpoint, although these may not  be 
sustained after the trial ends. In the standard of care control group, families will receive 
gift cards to cover groceries and this may allow them to purchase healthier foods such 
as vegetables.   
Participant s in both groups will benefit from the knowl edge that they are helping to 
contribute to the knowledge of how diet changes can help treat NAFLD.   
In addition, a t the conclusion of the study, all participant s in the studies will receive 
copies of their liver transaminases, lipid results and baseline MRI  PDFF results and 
these will be discussed with them by one of the investigators . Education will be provided 
as appropriate regarding the result s and standard of care advice for diet and physical 
activity levels.  
2.3.3 Alternative treatments and procedures  
Patients that are approached about the study can choose not to participate. If they 
decide not to participate it will not impact their standard of care treatment.  
2.3.4 Protection against  risks 
Risk will be minimized to the children by using nurses and  staff experienced in pediat rics 
for the research studies. As discussed above, the risks associated with heavy water will 
be minimized by giving the first dose at the research center under supervision. Risk to 
confidentiali ty will be reduced by using non- identifying participant  numbers and removing 
all ide ntifiers as early as feasible. Only study personnel will have access to identifying 
data. Laboratory personnel will only have access to numeric identifiers and the key will 
be kept in a password protected database.   
Children will provide written  assent ( 11-16 y). Children are able to decline to continue to 
participate at any time before and during the  study or study visit.  During study visits, if an 
IV fails , we will attempt to replace it. If the child does not wish to have it replaced, we 
encourage them to tell us this and the visit will be stopped immediately.  Study stipends 
are provided at a standardized pro- rated level appropriate for the time/study procedures 
completed.

 3 OBJECTIVES  
What is the role of sugar consumption in the etiology and treatment of pediatric NALFD?  
3.1 General hypothesis 
Sugar restriction will reduce hepatic fat content and reverse liver histopathology in 
children with NAFLD (and by extension, such foods/beverages that trigger the  condition).  
3.2 Specific Hypothesis 
Restricting sugar in beverages, in food, or in both will decrease hepatic fat content and 
reverse liver histopathology in children with NAFLD in relation to the type and/or degree 
of restriction (and by extension, such foods/beverages that trigger the condition).  
3.3 Implications  
Improvement in NAFLD/NASH in children can be achieved by limiting all sugars, or by 
limiting a specific form of sugar ( free sugars in beverages or in food) alone. Avoiding 
such foods will prevent development of NAFLD and NASH.  
3.4 Primary Outcome Measure 
Change in hepatic steatosis (%) by MRI  PDFF  in the intervention group compared to 
change in the control  group.  
3.5 Secondary Outcome Measures  
ALT, AST, GGT, Adipo -IR, fasting glucose, insulin,  serum lipids, sweetness perception 
testing, compliance (all baseline compared to 8 weeks, change in intervention group 
compared to control ).

 4 STUDY DESIGN 
 A study that tests nutritional interventions that clinicians currently prescribe, such as  ad 
libitum  weight -reducing diets, has the potential to directly and rapidly affect clinical 
practice, but does not necessarily provide significant insight into the dietary trigger of 
disease or the dietary mechanism driving any observed effects. Conversel y, a highly 
controlled diet study may more clearly identify the nutritional trigger and mechanism 
(necessary for the successful prevention of the disease in public health campaigns) but 
may be dismissed by many clinicians as divorced from actual practice. Here we describe 
a trial that  hopes to  balance the need for establishing practical clinical guidelines for 
dietary treatment and experimental controls sufficient to identify the dietary trigger for 
NAFLD in a pediatric population.  
4.1 Overview  
This is a 2 site, 8-week randomized, controlled, outpatient feeding study at Emory 
University and UCSD. Participant s will be non- diabetic mal e adolescents with biopsy -
proven NAFLD . Two groups of 20 participant s will be followed for 8 weeks with hepatic 
fat content ass essed by MRI  PDFF at weeks 0, 4, and 8. The participant s will be 
randomized to either standard of care  control arm to track the naturally -occurring 
changes in hepatic fat content  over time , or replacement of habitual diet with a low “free 
sugars” (<3% of  total daily calories) version,  intervention arm . The primary outcome is 
percent change in liver fat content over time in the treatment group compared to the 
control  group. Additional parameters of liver function and metabolic status (e.g., serum 
ALT) wil l also be assessed.   
4.2 Intervention  
The intervention is replacement of habitual diet with a low “free sugars” diet (<3% of total 
calories) . The intervention will be applied by family  and will aim to alter the diet by 
specifically targeting the foods that  contain free sugars  (WHO definition: glucose, 
fructose, galactose, sucrose, maltose, trehalose) added to food by consumer, cook, or 
manufacturer, while preserving the family’s other food group choices . At recruitment, 
families will be randomized to  either  the low “free sugars”  diet (intervention) or remain on 
their regular diet  (standard of care control) . Following screening procedures and prior to 
study initiation, a home visit will be scheduled at which  current food consumption, food 
preferences, and weekly food volume required for the family  will be assessed and 
recorded. Additionally, common recipes used by the family will be collected.  One day 
prior to study initiation (Day 0 ), the nutritionist /coordinator/staff  will assist the parent or 
guardian in selecting and removing all sugar and sugar -containing products from the 
home.  The items will be replaced with similar foods that contain no free sugars.  In 
general, artificial sweeteners will be avoided although in some instances it will be 
necessary to use  them.   
 
16 
 For each week of the study (8 weeks total), families will  be able to choose meals from a 
list of food s similar to their usual diet including  ready -to-eat foods, breakfast foods, lunch 
items, dinner entrees, fruits, and snacks. Food will be prepared by dieticians/nutritionists  
at the research metabolic kitchen and supplies for several days at a time will be 
delivered to the fami ly by the study staff. Each child will be provided with a lunch bag 
and instructed to bring lunch to school  to maintain the  study diet .  
Families will have the opportunity to choose from a list of pre -prepared evening meals 
that are similar to what they consumed before study  initiation  but not containing any free 
sugars . Dinners will typically be fresh or frozen and re -heating  in the oven or microwave 
may be required. The families will be instructed to not eat any food outside of assigned 
diet. For the duration of the study a water dispenser will be provided. Families will be 
instructed to avoid all fruit juice and sweet drinks . Fruit consumption will be allowed but 
restricted in amount ( to 1-2 portions/ day per family member ). 
Methods to improve compliance: Twice a week, a  coordinator/study staff member  will 
conduct home visit s or phone calls  to assess food satisfaction as well  as diet compliance 
in the intervention arm . In the standard of care control arm, study staff will visit the home 
once a week to check on their compliance and provide them with any study -related items 
(water, gift cards etc.).  To enhance compliance, the fa mily will be allowed 1 meal “off” of 
the diet 4 times during the study.  These meals will be planned in coordination with the 
staff and may include holidays or special family events  or other days that they select . 
These “off” meals may not be used during t he last week of the intervention.   
Compliance will also be increased by informing participants that the investigators can 
assess compliance with the diet by measuring sugar in the blood work.  If there is 
evidence of the participant  not complying, the study  coordinator or investigator will meet 
with the participant  and family members and explain the importance of only consuming 
the study diet.  If the study coordinator/staff perceives evidence of persistent non -
compliance by the participant , families will be  withdrawn  from study and the diet will be 
stopped.  
4.3 Dietary Assessment  
Baseline diet by 24- hour recal ls will include 2 x 24- hour recalls to reflect diet during 
week days and 1 x 24- hour recall to reflect diet on a weekend day. Families will be asked 
to specify times that work best to conduct the 24- hour recalls and will be called at 
random, to minimize diet change. The 24 -hour recalls will aid in getting a better sense of 
the food groups consumed by the participant  and his family and in the preparation o f a 
personalized, tailored diet. Following study participant  randomization, two weeks prior to 
study initiation, a home visit will be scheduled where current food consumption, food 
preferences, and weekly food volume required for the family will be recorde d. 
Additionally, common recipes will be collected. During the study, every week a 
coordinator/study staff member will conduct two home visits to assess food satisfaction 
and diet compliance. If the study coordinator/staff perceives non- compliance by the 
 
17 
 family at any point of the study, the intervention will be stopped and families will be 
withdrawn from the study.  
4.4 Sweetness Perception Testing 
 4.4.1 Participant  preparation  
Participant s will be asked to undergo sweetness taste perception testing at three points 
in the study: baseline (study initiation, week 0), follow -up visit 1 (week 4), and follow up 
visit 2 (study end, week 8). Participant s will arrive at the clinic after an overnight fast to 
conduct the sweetness perception testing and MRI. Prior to each study visit, participant s 
will be reminded not to eat or drink anything except for water  after 8 pm the night before 
the visit . At each  visit height, weight, and vital signs will be collected.  
 
4.4.2 Sensory Ratings 
Sweetness perception will be asses sed in a test session of about 1 hour. Participant s 
will rate both the intensity and pleasantness of model beverages that vary widely in 
sucrose concentration. The model beverages will be formulated using unsweetened 
Kool-Aid ™ drink mix at a fixed concent ration. Concentrations of sucrose (ranging from 
barely sweet to very sweet) will be added to this fixed concentration of drink mix. Model 
beverages will be presented chilled. Over the course of a 1 -hour session, participant s 
will consume about 120 ml of mo del beverage, or the equivalent of about 1/3rd  of a 12 
oz can of soda.  
 
The first 10 -15 minutes of each session will be devoted to instructions and practice 
ratings. Participant s will rate perceived sweetness intensity using visual analog scales 
(i.e., vertical lines with the anchor labels “ Tasteless ” on the bottom  and “ Extremely 
Strong ” on the top). Such scales are easy for participant s to understand and use. 
Participant s will practice by rating the sweetness of 8  sucrose solutions ( different 
concentrations of Kool -Aid) that cover the range of sucrose concentrations to be using in 
sensory testing. Participant s will rate pleasantness using a standard category scale 
ranging from “ Dislike Extremely ” (-4), to “ Neither Like Nor Dislike ” (0), to “ Like Extremely ” 
(+4). Again, the use of such scales is fairly intuitive.  
 
After scaling practice, participant s will be instructed to rate the sweetness and 
pleasantness of 16  model drink samples. The 16  samples will be presented in 5 ml 
aliquots (in 160 ml disposable plastic medicine cups). The 16 samples will be presented 
in two blocks of 8  trials. Each block will include all 8  sucrose concentrations, presented 
in random order. Prior to the first trial of each block, participant s will be asked to rinse 
their mouth four t imes with water (same water used to make test beverage) and spit it 
out. Next, participant s will sample each of the 8  cups by sipping, rolling the liquid sample 
 
18 
 around in the mouth for several seconds, and then swallowing the sample. After 
swallowing, participant s will rate both the sweet taste intensity and pleasantness of the 
sample. After each trial, the participant  will rinse the mouth a few times with water (same 
water used to make test beverage), spit, and wait ~45 seconds before tasting the next 
sample. Each block (all 8  concentrations, once each, in randomized order) will be 
followed by a five minute break. The first block will be used as practice and will not be 
included in analysis. The second and third blocks (replicate ratings for each of the 8  
concentrations) will be used for analysis.   
4.5  Study duration for participant s

 reason(s) for the termination or suspension by the  sponsor or by the 
investigator/institution, as specified by the applicable regulatory requirement(s).  
 
22 
 6 STUDY SCHEDULE  
The schedule of events (Section 11.1) summarizes the procedures to be done at each 
visit. T he visit windows are the goal for the study and serve as a guideline for the clinical 
sites. These visit windows are not strictly set; conducting a study visit outside of the visit 
window will not be considered a protocol deviation.  Visit windows are outlines in the 
Schedule of Events.  
6.1 Screening  
Screening visits/procedures may be combined or changed to accommodate the sub-
study schedule.  
 
Day -60 Screening visit:  Participant s will provide verbal consent or in- person written  
consent indicating that they wish to participate in the study so that a screening visit may 
be scheduled to assess eligibility. Informed consent will be obtained prior to initiating  any 
research procedures.  The screening visit may be conducted at a clinical visit if that is 
convenient for the participant . The ALT for eligibility must be drawn at or within 7 days 
before this visit.   
Vital signs, height, and weight , waist and hip circumference measures  will be obtained at 
the screening visit  as well as a physical exam . Alcohol use will be assessed using the 
Alcohol Use Disorders  Identification Test (AUDIT) and baseline beverage consumption 
will be assessed using the Bev -Q beverage questionnaire.  A background medical history 
will be obtained and c oncomitant medications will be reviewed as well.  
The following labs will be drawn at the screening visit:  
• CMP  
• CBC  
• Direct bilirubin  
• PT/INR 
• HbA1c  
• Plasma and serum for storage  
Day -25  Dietary Assessment : After the screening visit, the baseline usual diet will be 
assessed using three 24 -hour, interviewer assisted, dietary  recalls (1 weekend day and 
2 week days).  These will be administered by telephone or in person  by a trained study 
nutritionist or coordinator after the screening visit/enrollment  and prior to Day 0.  
Day -14 MRI,: MRI will be used to assess level of liver fat  within 10 days of  Day 0 (diet 
initiation) . At the Emory site, both the usual MRI based quantification of hepatic fat and a 
10-minute HISTO protocol will be collected during a single 30 minute MRI. The HISTO 
 
23 
 protocol is a highly precise measurement of hepatic fat and will be used to determine 
eligibility for the study.  If the hepatic fat is >10% by MRI PDFF , the participant  will be 
enrolled.  The % hepatic fat for the outcome measurements will be determined by the 
UCS D center’s hepatic PDFF MRI protocol. The MRI may be repeated if images are 
inadequate  and the MRI may be used to measure visceral fat.  
Re-screening: Participants that screenfail for any reason may re -screen after  a period of  
6 months.  
Day -9   Randomization : Randomization will be assigned after  the initial screening visit 
and the participant  will be informed o f their assignment after the 24- hour dietary recalls 
but before Day 0.  
Day -7 Home Visit Food Assessment:   A study coordinator and nutritionist will visit the 
home of intervention- arm participants and comp lete the assessment of the family’s usual 
consumption patterns, recipes and the initial menus.   
6.2 Day 0: Baseline  Visit  
 Once the screening assessments are complete  and the participant  is deemed eligible to 
participate in the study  the participant  will be scheduled for their Day 0 visit. This visit 
may be scheduled  up to 60 days after the screening visit.  
Height, weight, waist and hip circumference measurements  and vital signs will be 
collected at this visit.  Any adverse events and changes to any concom itant medications 
will be reviewed as well .  A sweetness perception test will be administered at this visit.  
For the intervention arm, t he nutritionist will meet with the family during this visit to 
review the details of the intervention. The standard of c are participant s will have diet 
assessmen t but no instructions on diet. Instructions will be given for compliance and the 
nutritionist will arrange a time to meet with the family in the home.  
The following labs will also be drawn at this visit:  
• CMP  
• GGT  
• Lipid Profile  
• Insulin  
• Plasma and serum for storage  
• Stool sample collection 
After the research visit, the food for the first several days of the study will be delivered to the 
home of the intervention participant s and the sugar -containing non- perishable foods will be 
boxed up and stored at the home (or another  location at the discretion of  the family).  
Perishable sugar -containing foods will be disposed of and replaced with no free sugars 
containing versions.   
 
 
24 
 6.3 Follow -up Visit Day 28 
The Day 28 visit will take place 28 days  (4 weeks) after baseline. All assessments and 
testing done at the baseline visit  will be repeated at this visits with the exception of the 
nutrition counseling, and stool collection.  
6.4  Follow -up Visit Day 56  
Up to 6 weeks prior to the Day 56 visit three 24- hour, interviewer assisted, dietary recalls 
(1 weekend day and 2 week days)  will be performed. These will be administered by 
telephone or in person by a trained study nutritionist or coordinator at least 1 week prior 
to the Day 56 vi sit. This visit will take place 56 days (8 weeks) after baseline. All 
assessments and testing done at the baseline visit will be repeated at this visit with the 
exception of the nutrition counseling.  
6.5 End of study follow -up 
A phone visit will take place two weeks after the Day 56 visit. The purpose of this call is  
to discuss feedback about the study with the participant  and his or her family. We will 
ask for details about what they liked or disliked  about study participation and ask for any 
suggestions f or future studies.  
 
25 
 7 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
7.1 Sample Size Considerations  
Initial analyses will be undertaken to inspect data for errors, inconsistencies, and 
incomplete information. This will include examining the data with simple frequency tables 
and dot plots for univariate data and scatter plots and multi -way dot plots with bivariate 
and multivariate data. Data anomalies and outliers will be examined and corrected if 
necessary. To summarize bivariate relationships between predictors and hepatic fa t 
percent, Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient, r s, will be used. For reporting inferential 
statistics, such as differences in means, 95 percent confidence intervals will be used 
extensively to quantify degree of clinical efficacy. For any models, appr opriate 
assumptions and model conditions will be verified prior to analysis.  
Analyses will include descriptive statistics at baseline and for each treatment group for 
all outcome variables, plots of longitudinal data over time, and examination of 
distribu tions within groups at important nodal points (e.g., Baseline, 4 weeks and 8 
weeks).  All longitudinal models will include baseline measurements as a covariate to 
adjust for potential differences between treatment groups at baseline. All efficacy 
analysis will follow the intention- to-treat convention (inclusion of all randomized 
participants in the analysis). Participants that drop out or are lost to follow -up will be 
compared to those that remain in the study to assess for bias and generalizability of the 
results.  All analyses will be conducted using SAS v9.3 for Windows (Cary, NC, USA).  
Power Analysis  
The primary outcome is change in MRI PDFF from baseline to 8 weeks in the 
intervention group compared to the standard of care group. Participants will be s creened 
at baseline and confirmed that their hepatic fat is < 10%. Given 40 completed 
participants, (20 randomized to the diet low in free sugars  and 20 randomized to usual 
diet), our goal is show a 25% improvement in MRI PDFF with intervention over control.  
For example:  
 
Intervention: 15% hepatic fat baseline –  (30% change = 4.5%) = Hepatic fat of 10.5% at 
8 weeks  
 
Control: 15% hepatic fat at baseline –  (5% change = 0.75%) = Hepatic fat of 14.25% at 8 
weeks  
 
A two sample, two- tailed t test with an overal l sample size of 40 participants (20 per 
group) achieves greater than 90% power to detect a true difference of means of 4% 
when the sigma is 3%. Power was calculated assuming that 20% of patients in each 
group will be lost to follow -up with a 0.05 signific ance level.  
 
 
 
26 
 Plan for missing data:   
We note that attrition, participant compliance and systematic data collection are 
fundamental requirements for this study. Successful coordination of participants and 
management of data are important prerequisites for  a subsequent trial. Thus, we focus 
appropriate attention to missing data. Prevention is the first line for controlling bias and 
loss of power from missing data. Upon entry, alternative contacts will be identified for all 
participants to minimize loss -to follow -up.  Consistent with the intent to treat principle, we 
will follow -up with all randomized participants regardless of the actual treatment received 
(we will invite families who miss visits to return for assessments later if possible).  
Participants who express intent to dropout completely will be asked to attend an early 
termination visit to collect endpoint measures. Timely data entry combined with monthly 
missing data reports will prompt tracking down missing outcome assessments. Despite 
these prevention efforts, m issing data will occur. Our primary analysis is valid under the 
assumption that missing data are missing at random (MAR).  To evaluate this 
assumption, we will examine the extent of missing data and missing data patterns, and 
determine the reasons and time  of dropout.

 Optional Sub- study Amendment:  
 
De novo lipogenesis sub- study for the protocol “Randomized, Controlled Dietary 
Treatment of Pediatric NAFLD”  
 
Background:  
The diet treatment study is  an 8 week, randomized, controlled clinical trial of a low sugar 
diet as a treatment for NAFLD.  In the main study, children will be evaluated at baseline, 
4 weeks and 8 weeks using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and labs.  Because 
carbohydrates and espec ially simple sugars stimulate de novo lipogenesis (DNL –  new 
fat synthesis in the liver), an important secondary outcome of the study is change in 
DNL.  In this optional sub- study , we propose to add the use of heavy water  (2H2O) 
metabolite measurement as a tool for determining DNL and markers of fibrogenesis  at 
baseline and at 8 weeks.   
 
Heavy water is a form of water that is enriched for the hydrogen isotope deuterium 
compared to the common hydrogen- 1 isotope that m akes up most hydrogen in water.  
Heavy wa ter is not radioactive and is physically and chemic ally similar to regular water. 
The human body naturally contains some deuterium. Stable isotopes have a long 
history as a safe, effective tracer for measuring synthesis of molecules in humans 40. 
Small oral doses of 2H20 are routinely used in human metabolic experiments and there 
are no known health risks with small amounts.   
Utilizing in vivo heavy water labeling and a small amount of plasma, multiple pathways 
related to protein metabolism (fibrogenesis) and lipid metabolism can be quantified in a 
minimally invasive fashion in human subjects.  Recently, new developments in stable 
isotope labeling tech niques and advances in mass spectrometry have made in vivo 
kinetic measurement of slow  metabolic processes possible. Through the use of 2H2O 
(heavy water) as the source of labeling, our collaborators and others have measured T -
cell proliferation 41, mammary epithelial cell proliferation 42, prostate epithelial cell 
proliferation 43, triglyceride synthesis 44and protein synthesis 45 in humans. DNL as well 
as hepatic TG assembly and cholesterogenesis are easily measured in plasma from 
patients consuming 2H2O, after 5 -14 days of labeling the plasma DNL reaches a steady 
state and reflects hepatic DNL rates.    
Both Emory and UCSD research entities and IRBs have previous experience with heavy  
water based research studies and this sub- study is minimal risk to participants.  
 
Hypothesis:   We hypothesize that DNL will significantly decrease in the children wit h 
NAFLD randomized to the low sugar diet.   
 
33 
  
Risks : 
7) Heavy water – 2H2O Intake  — Participants  will be given heavy water (deuterated 
water, 2H2O) for up to 28 days over the course of the study . There are no known 
medical risks of heavy water (2H2O) intake.  2H2O is not radioactive. Rarely, 
individuals (<3%) may experience temporary light -headedness, dizziness, or vertigo 
(room spinning) when they take the first doses of 2H2O.  These symptoms are self -
limited and resolve within 2- 3 hours. Participant s will als o be instructed to avoid 
driving or performing other potentially hazardous activities for one hour after drinking 
the initial dose of 2H2O in case they become dizzy. Participant s will be instructed on 
the intake of 2H2O to ensure a slow rise in initial body water enrichment and  thereby 
avoid these symptoms. This is achieved by drinking 50 mL of 70% 2H2O twice a day . 
This labeling protocol has been shown in >100 human participant s in studies to 
produce a steady rise to plateau body water enrichments of 1.0- 2.0% 2H2O  49.  
 
Potential Benefits : 
There are no additional benefits to the participants from this additional study measure.   
 
Protection Against Risks : 
Participants will be given their first dose of heavy water i n the pediatric research unit 
and observed for at least 90 minutes afterwards.  The heavy water dose is divided into 
twice daily doses so that the dose is small at each consumption. No large loading dose 
(sometimes used in studies) is being used to improve safety for the children.   
 
Outcomes : 
Results of this sub- study are secondary outcomes for the main study.  Outcomes 
include baseline rates of DNL, fibrogenesis markers, change in DNL from baseline, and 
other metabolites of interest.  
 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria : 
Same as main study.  
 
Consenting and Assenting Process:  
After the main study is explained, the sub- study will also be explained.  Participants will 
be provided ample time to ask questions about the sub- study.  There is no penalty for 
not part icipating in the sub- study.   
 
 
 
34 
 Sub- Study Schedule and Procedures  
The heavy water labeling will occur in two time periods –  one at the beginning of the 
study and one at the end.   
 
Day -7 to -5: For all screening subjects  participating in the sub- study , heavy water 
labeling will be initiated at a study visit in the pediatric research unit. Subjects will be 
monitored for 30 minutes  and vitals will be obtained.  Instruction s and heavy water doses 
for 7 days will be provided to the participants to take home. The heavy water will be 
provided in sealed single dose bottles and participants will be asked to consume one in 
the morning and one any time after dinner.  
 
If subjects do not enroll in the full study because of their screening MRI results they will 
be instr ucted to dispose of the water at home and will not have any further visits.  
   
Day 0:   6 mL of fasting plasma will be collected along with a blood spot  during their day 
0 visit at the research center.   
 
Day 4 7 to 53: Saliva sample and a blood spot will be collected during a home visit.  
After the specimen collection, the participant will resume heavy water twice a day for up 
to 7 days (completing the evening before the final study visit).   
 
Day 5 6: At the final study visit, 6 mL of fasting plasma and sali va will be collected from 
the participants. A blood spot on filter paper will also be collected at this visit.  
 
Sample Handling and Data Transfers : 
The saliva and plasma samples will be shipped to KineMed for measurement of the 
sub-study markers.  A secon d reserved plasma sample will be retained at each study 
site as back up in case of issues with the first sample.   
 
All samples will be de -identified and will be provided to KineMed collated and in random 
order in batches over the course of the study.  Sal iva and plasma samples will be batch-
shipped to Kinemed from each site. These samples will be used to assess the methods 
and sample quality. Technicians at KineMed will be blinded to study assignment 
(intervention or control).   
 
The results of the analysi s of the saliva and plasma will be entered into the study 
Redcap database through coordination between the study statistical team and KineMed 
using secure systems.   
 
 
 
 
35 
 Power Analysis and Statistical Considerations:  
There are no previous studies reported i n children with NAFLD evaluating de novo 
lipogenesis and thus the effect size is unknown.  Consistent with the intent of the main 
study to provide pilot data for a larger RCT, this sub- study will provide important, novel 
information on the rates of DNL and  response to diet change in a cohort of children.

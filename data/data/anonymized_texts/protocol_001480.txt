1  PROTOCOL SUMMARY  
1.1 SYNOPSIS  
Title:  Increasing recruitment of underrepresented cancer survivors with 
awareness enhancing interventions (AWEI)  
Study Description:  
This study aims to investigate whether increasing awareness and, 
thus, enhancing positive attitudes about research, prior to 
recruitment attempts, will increase participation in cancer clinical 
research among African American (AA) cancer survivors  
Specifically , we investigate if interventions to raise awareness about 
research can increase the recruitment of African American cancer survivors to a web- based diet and physical activity interventions trial, 
known as the Adapting MultiPLe behavior Interventions that 
eFfectively Improve (AMPLIFI) Cancer Survivor Health trial  
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]) . The study will use a factorial trial design to test the 
effectiveness of the Awareness and Willingness  to Engage in 
Research Intervention (AWEI) versus the original AMPLIFI 
recruitment strategy.
  
Objectives:  
 To determine if interventions to raise awareness about 
research can increase the recruitment of African American 
cancer survivors to the AMPLIFY web -based diet and physical 
activity trial  
 
Endpoints:  – Reached = whether the AMPLIFI recruiter was able to reach the potential participant over the phone  
– Screened if reached = whether the survivor who was reached by the recruiter was willing to consider the study and to be screened to ascertain eligibility for the AMPLIFI 
trial 
AWEI RCT  Version 1.0 
 <31 March 2025> 
  2 – Consented if eligible = whether the survivor who was 
screened and found eligible to participate in the AMPLIFI 
trial agreed and consented to participate in the AMPLIF I trial  
 
Study Population:  Adult (age ≥50 years old) African American cancer survivors who were eligible for enrollment into the AMPLIFI trial
  
- Within 1- 5 years from a diagnosis of loco- regional 
cancers of the colorectum, female breast, prostate, endometrium, localized kidney or ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, multiple myeloma and non- Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma  
 
Phase:  2 
Description of Study 
Intervention:  The AWEI interventions were educational interventions that varied 
by:  
- delivery channel, i.e., education through a brochure vs. a 
research educator ‘navigator’  
- research emphasis, i.e., highlighting the importance of 
participating in AMPLIFI vs. in research in general  
- perspective, i.e., the information reflected the voice of a 
cancer survivor  vs. that of an expert rese archer  
Study Duration:  3 years  
Subject  Duration:  15 days  
  
  
 
2  INTRODUCTION  
 
2.1 STUDY RATIONALE  
 
African American cancer survivors are often underrepresented in clinical trials, which 
can limit the generalizability of research findings. This study seeks to address this gap by testing an intervention designed to increase awareness and willingness to participate in a web- based diet and physical activity trial.  
 
2.2 BACKGROUND  
 
As highlighted in the 2022 National Academies of Medicine report on improving 
representation in clinical trials and research, the lack of representation of diverse groups 
has many consequences including hindering innovation and new discoveries, 
generalizability of research findings, access to effective medical interventions, and trust 
in research and medicine. Inadequate representation in research means we have limited information and opportunity to advance knowledge to reduce the cancer burden 
AWEI RCT  Version 1.0 
 <31 March 2025> 
  3 and to under stand underlying causes of disparate outcomes across different groups. 
This is highly significant for African Americans who have the highest death rates of all 
racial and ethnic groups for about half of the most common cancers.  
Increasing awareness among cancer survivors about the importance of research 
and study participation may be a key, yet often overlooked approach to achieving more 
racially/ethnically diverse trials.  Many questions exist about the best ways to convey 
the relevant information to potential participants. For example, while lay navigator interventions are promising, they are also costly: whether more economical interventions, e.g., using brochures conveying the same information, are effective is unknown. Other questions are related to whether it would be more effective to raise 
awareness about the specific study recruiting participants or about the importance of 
research in general, and whether this should be done conveying the information from the perspective of the survivor or the resear chers.  
 
2.3 RISK/BENEFIT ASSESSM ENT   
 
2.3.1 KNOWN POTENTIAL RISKS  
 
Risks and discomforts from participation in project activities for the AWEI trial are no greater 
than those associated with day -to-day living. No medical tests or procedures will be conducted, 
and no social, legal or other risks are anticipated.  
  
2.3.2 KNOWN POTENTIAL BENEFITS  
 Survivors participating in this project may benefit from increasing their awareness about 
research, and better understanding the importance of participating. They will be better able to 
make an informed decision about the opportunity to participate in the AMPLIFI trial. The findings 
will benefit the research community as evidence for recruitment methods are scarce especially 
for increasing the recruitment of minorities.  
 
3 STUDY DESIGN  
 
3.1 OVERALL DESIGN 
  
This is a prospective interventional study using a randomized factorial trial design. Participants 
will be randomized to one of 8 combinations of the AWEI intervention or to the control group (no 
AWEI)  (Table 1) . The AWEI in tervention varies by type of delivery channel (Research Educator 
[RE] and Brochure), information emphasis (research general information vs.  AMPLIFI study 
specific information), and type of perspective (information presented from a researcher or a 
survivor perspective).

4.1 INCLUSION CRITERIA  
 
African American cancer survivors who were eligible for enrollment into the AMPLIFI trial 
- adults (age ≥50 years old)  
- within 1 -5 years from a diagnosis of loco- regional cancers of the colorectum, 
female breast, prostate, endometrium, localized kidney or ovarian cancer, thyroid cancer, multiple myeloma and non- Hodgkin’s lymphoma  
 
4.2 EXCLUSION CRITERIA  
 
- Not identified for recruitment to AMPLIFI trial  
 
 
4.3 STRATEGIES FOR RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION  
 
AWEI RCT  Version 1.0 
 <31 March 2025> 
  5 The AWEI trial was embedded into the 
AMPLIFI trial’s recruitment process.2  To 
identify the list of eligible survivors, AMPLIFI 
collaborated with the Alabama Statewide 
Cancer Registry (ASCR) and the North Carolina Registry (NCR), and followed their protocols for the release of contact information 
to the AMPLIFI research team. The AMPLIFI 
process started with survivors receiving a 
recruitment letter informing them about the study and of the possibility of receiving a call 
from an AMPLIFI recruiter. Survivors were also given the team’s contact information to opt-out from the study if they so wished.  
The AWEI trial randomization occurred once the recruitment letter was sent. No retention strategies were necessary since participation in the AWEI trial lasted 15 days. Outcomes 
were assessed as part of the AMPLIFY trial .  
 
 
 
 
5 STUDY INTERVENTION  
 
5.1 STUDY INTERVENTION(S ) ADMINISTRATION  
 
5.1.1 STUDY INTERVENTION DESCRIPTION 
 
AWEI interventions were educational interventions delivered through a research 
educator or a brochure.  
 
5.1.2 DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION  
 
In the AWEI- Research Educator (RE) arm, one of four REs attempted to contact 
survivors by phone starting 5 days after the letter was sent (7 attempts over 10 days) 
and deliver the content of the intervention following a script. Each RE was trained on the 

AWEI RCT  Version 1.0 
 <31 March 2025> 
  6 script of one of the AWEI -RE combinations differing by Information Emphasis and 
Perspective to avoid contamination across AWEI groups.  If the survivor did not receive 
the recruitment letter, the RE would give more information about the purpose of the call 
and offer to resend the letter.  
In the AWEI- Brochure arm, one of 4 brochures according to AWEI combination was 
sent 4 days after the recruitment letter was sent. The same content was delivered in the 
AWEI -RE and AWEI -Brochure arms.  
 
 
5.2 MEASURES TO MINIMIZE BIAS: RANDOMIZATION  
All particip ants were randomized to the AWEI (the intervention group) and no AWEI 
(control group) using permuted block randomization. Those who were randomized to 
the AWEI arm were simultaneously randomized to one of 8 combinations using the 
same method (Table 1).

7 STUDY ASSESSMENTS AN D PROCEDURES  
 
7.1 STUDY  ASSESSMENTS  
 
AWEI study outcomes are tracked and recorded by AMPLIFI recruiters who are blind to 
the AWEI random assignment. No other assessments are conducted.  
To allow for the AWEI interventions to be delivered, we allow 15 days from  the time 
from when the recruitment letter was sent to when the AMPLIFY recruitment call occur red.  
AWEI RCT  Version 1.0 
 <31 March 2025> 
  7 To further ensure that AMPLIFY recruiters remain blind to study assessment, AWEI 
participants, including those in the no AWEI control arm, are “released” to the recruiters 
in a random fashion over the 15 days AWEI period starting at day 8.  For the AWEI RE 
arm, survivors a re released after the RE call is  completed or the RE completed all 7 
attempts to deliver the intervention.  
Survivors reached by AMPLIFY recruiters are given more information about the study 
and given the option to be screened for participation to verify additional inclusion (e.g., 
completed primary treatment) and exclusion criteria (e.g., conditions that would make 
unsupervis ed exercise unsafe).  If they screen eligible and are interested in joining 
AMPLIF Y, they would undergo the informed consent process and enroll in AMPLIF Y.  
 
 
7.2 ADVERSE EVENTS AND SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENT S 
 
Risks and discomforts from participation in project act ivities for the AWEI trial are no greater 
than those associated with day -to-day living. No medical tests or procedures will be conducted, 
and no social, legal or other risks are anticipated.  
 
Given this low risk there is no independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the 
AWEI trial , but will rely on the DSMB established for the AMPLIFI.  
 
7.3 UNANTICIPATED PROBLE MS 
 
7.3.1 DEFINITION OF UNANTI CIPATED PROBLEMS (UP) 
The Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) considers unanticipated problems 
involving risks to subject s or others to include, in general, any incident, experience, or outcome 
that meets all  of the following criteria:  
 
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research procedures 
that are described in the protocol- related documents; and (b) the characteristics of the 
subject  population being studied; 
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means there is a reasonable possibility  that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by the procedures involved in the research); and , 
• Suggests that the research places subject s or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
 
7.3.2  UNANTICIPATED PROBL EM REPORTING  
 
To minimize the risk of breach of confidentiality , we will take the following precautions:  
1. Investigators, recruiters, interviewers, the navigator and other study personnel, are, or will be, HIPAA and IRB certified prior to the handling of any personal data from study 
participants and must maintain current HIPAA and IRB certification as a require ment for 
continued employment.  
AWEI RCT  Version 1.0 
 <31 March 2025> 
  8 2. Data on potential participants will be obtained from AMPLIFI.  Identifiable data (name, 
addresses, phone numbers, emails) will be imported in Studytrax. Studytrax is an Electronic Data 
Capture system designed for clinical tr ials (Phase I – IV), observational studies and patient 
registries. Studytrax tracks subject enrollment and captures data elements via a secure web portal, and facilitates the transfer of data into statistical packages for analysis. Studytrax uses MS SQL Se rver as the back end relational database. In compliance with HIPAA privacy rules and 
HIPAA security rules, database security features target multiple levels including the data element (e.g., restricted access to fields), user (e.g., password authentication access), application (e.g., 
role-based access to features, access audit trails), and hosting services (e.g., firewall, secure 
sockets layer). Some of the most important features related to data security include: SSL enforced access, Strong authentication,  All passwords are individually salted and hashed, 
Account locking after 5 failed attempts, Inactive user session time out, Role- based security, and 
User activity auditing. These features ensure access control, audit control, data integrity, user 
authentic ation, and transmission security.  
The investigator will report unanticipated loss of confidentiality problems  to the Institutional 
Review Board (IRB)  of the University of Alabama at Birmingham (relying IRB) and the University 
of Tennessee Health Science Center . The report will include the following information: 
 
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title and number, PI’s name, and the IRB 
project number;  
• A detailed description of the loss of confidentiality event;  
• A description of any changes to the  protocol or other corrective actions that have been 
taken or are proposed in response to the loss of confidentiality event . 
 To satisfy the requirement for prompt reporting, loss of confidentiality events  will be reported 
within 10 working days  of the investigator becoming aware of the problem.  
 
8 STATISTICAL CONSIDER ATIONS  
 
8.1 STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES  
 
• Primary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  
Recruitment yield  assessed by :  
1) Consented if eligible: Binary indicator of whether the survivor who is  screened and 
found eligible to participate in the AMPLIF Y trial agrees and consent s to participate in 
the AMPLIFY trial.  
 
• Secondary Efficacy Endpoint(s):  
 
Interest in participating in the AMPLFY study and returned their consent  assessed by:  
 
Same as recruitment yield.  
 
Post Hoc Outcomes:  
AWEI RCT  Version 1.0 
 <31 March 2025> 
  9 1) Reached: Binary indicator of whether the AMPLIFY recruiter is able to reach the 
potential participant over the phone, regardless of whether the survivor is willing to receive information about AMPLIFY  
2) Screened if reached:  Binary indicator of whether the survivor who is reached by the recruiter is willing to consider the study and to be screened to ascertain eligibility for the 
AMPLIFY trial  
 
8.2 SAMPLE SIZE DETERMIN ATION  
Hypothesis 1:  AWEI (any combination) will have a significantly higher recruitment yield than 
the basic AMPLIFI recruitment  strategy  (no AWEI control group) . 
With a minimum of 1,600 in the AWEI intervention group, and 400 in the no AWEI 
control group, a two -sided chi -square test (for unequal sample sizes), and a 5% 
significance level, we will have > 95% power to detect a statistically significant difference in recruitment yield of 10% vs. 20%.  
Hypothesis 2 - Delivery channel: AWEI -Research Educator w ill have a significantly higher 
recruitment yield than AWEI -brochure  
Hypothesis 3 - Information emphasis:  Education content with study -specific emphasis will 
have a significantly higher recruitment yield than with research general emphasis  
Hypothesis 4 - Perspective: Education content delivered from the survivor perspective will 
have a significantly higher recruitment yield than education content delivered from the 
researcher perspective.  
For these hypotheses, with a minimum of 800 per group, a two- sided chi-square test, 
and a 5% significance level, we will have > 95% power to detect a statistically significant 
difference in recruitment yield of 10% vs. 20%.  
Hypothesis 5: AWEI -Research Educator with study -specific emphasis and cancer survivor 
perspective (combination #3, Table 1) will be the most efficacious.  
The same sample size calculation applies to the comparison of any two combinations. With a minimum of 200 per group, a two- sided chi -
 square test, and a 5% significance 
level, we will have 80% power to detect a statistically significant difference in recruitment yield of 10% vs. 20%.  
Calculations were performed using nQuery Advisor + nTerim, version 3.0.   
Thus, the trial is fully powered with a sample of 2,000 survivors, 200 in each AWEI combination,  and 400 in the no AWEI arm. However, we will randomize all survivors 
identified from the cancer registries. If these are less than 2000, we will expand to other 
AWEI RCT  Version 1.0 
 <31 March 2025> 
  10 cancer registries  (estimated numbers from these registries exceed 2000 survivors). If 
these are more  than 2000, we will randomize all.  
 
8.3 STATISTICAL ANALYSES  
 
8.3.1 GENERAL APPROACH 
 
An intent -to-treat approach is used for statistical analyses. Descriptive statistics, 
including frequencies and proportions, are obtained for study variables. Differences 
between the group and sub- group proportions are examined using the chi -square test; if 
the assumptions for the chi -square test are not satisfied, Fisher’s exact test is used.  
Logistic regression compared outcomes for three groups: Control, AWEI Brochure a nd 
AWEI Research Educator. Future analyses will include logistic regression analysis to test hypotheses 3, 4, and 5.  Odds ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence 
intervals are obtained. Statistical tests are two- sided, and a significance level of 0.05 is 
assumed for all tests.  
 
8.3.2 ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY EFFICACY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
Imbalances in randomization groups if any will be adjusted in analysis.  
 Outcome variables are categorical. We  will logistic to test for differences in outcomes across the 
randomized groups . 
Hypothesis 1 will be tested using all randomized individuals. We will test differences in 
outcomes for 2 groups: AWEI (any combination) vs.  no AWEI (control group) . 
Hypothesis 2 will be tested within the AWEI group. We will test differences in outcomes for 2 
groups: AWEI -Research Educator vs. AWEI -brochure. 
Exact 95% confidence intervals based on the binomial distribution will be determined for each proportion.   
 
All statistical analyses will be conducted using SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Insti tute, Cary, 
NC).  
 
8.3.3 ANALYSIS OF THE SECONDARY ENDPOINT(S)  
 
We will use the same statistical approach for secondary endpoints.  
 
8.3.4 SAFETY ANALYSES  
 
AWEI RCT  Version 1.0 
 <31 March 2025> 
  11 None 
 
8.3.5 BASELINE DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS 
 
We will first conduct  descriptive analyses  to describe the study  population  and verify  that the 
randomization groups are balanced in age, gender, cancer type and stage, time since 
diagnosis, and rural/urban status.  
 
9 SUPPORTING DOCUMENTA TION AND OPERATIONAL  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1 REGULATORY, ETHICAL,  AND STUDY OVERSIGHT  CONSIDERATIONS  
 
9.1.1 INFORMED CONSENT PRO CESS  
 
9.1.1.1  CONSENT/ASSENT AND OTHER INFORMATIONAL DOCUMENTS 
PROVIDED TO SUBJECT S 
A waiver of informed consent and documentation is approved by the IRB for this trial, given that 
the purpose is to test recruitment strategies before enrollment in a study (before consent to a 
study occurs).  
 
9.1.1.2  CONSENT PROCEDURES AND DOCUMENTATION  
Not applicable  
9.1.2 STUDY DISCONTINUATION AND CLOSURE  
 Given this low risk there is no independent Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) for the AWEI trial , but will rely on the DSMB established for the AMPLIFI.  The AMPLIFI DSMB may 
temporarily suspend or prematurely terminate the trial if there is sufficient reasonable cause.  
Written notification, documenting the reason for study suspension or termination,  will be 
provided by the suspending or terminating party to regulatory authorities.  If the study is prematurely terminated or suspended, the Principal Investigator s will promptly inform the IRB, 
and will provide the reason(s) for the termination or suspension.  
 
  
Circumstances that may warrant termination or suspension include, but are not limited to:  
• Demonstration of efficacy that would warrant stopping    
• Insufficient compliance to protocol requirements  
• Data that are not sufficiently complete and/or evaluable 
• Determination of futility  
 
Study may resume once concerns are addressed, and satisfy the IRB . 
 
9.1.3 CONFIDENTIALITY AND PRIVACY  
Subject  confidentiality and privacy is strictly held in trust by the participating investigators  and 
their staff. Therefor e, the study protocol, documentation, data, and all other information 
generated will be held in strict confidence. No information concerning the study or the data will be released to any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the Principal 
Investigator .  
 
AWEI RCT  Version 1.0 
 <31 March 2025> 
  12 All research activities will be conducted in as private a setting as possible.  
 
IRB r epresentatives may inspect all documents and records required to be maintained by the 
investigator s. The clinical study site will permit access to such  records.  
 
The study subject ’s contact information will be securely stored for internal use during the study. 
At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a secure location for as long a 
period as dictated by the reviewing IRB  and/or  Institutional policies.  
 Study subject  research data, which is for purposes of statistical analysis and scientific reporting, 
will be stored at UAB . This will not include the subject ’s contact or identifying information. 
Rather, individual subject s and their  research data will be identified by a unique study 
identification number. The study data entry and study management systems used by research 
staff will be secured and password protected.  
 
9.1.4 QUALITY ASSURANCE AN D QUALITY CONTROL  
We reviewed recruitment report weekly to ensure that recruitment was done as planned. We 
provided ongoing training to interventionists to ensure that we the intervention was delivered as 
planned and appropriately documented. We oversaw that the intervention was delivered as 
planned (e.g., brochure mailed on the prespecified schedule). We had a detailed manual of 
operations specifying procedures.   
The site will provide direct access to all trial related sites, source data/documents, and reports 
for the purpose of monitoring and inspection by local and regulatory authorities.
 
 
9.1.5 DATA HANDLING AND RECORD KEEPING  
 
9.1.5.1  DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  
Data collection is the responsibility of the clinical trial staff at the site under the supervision of the Principal Investigator s. The Principal I nvestigator s are responsible for ensuring the 
accuracy, completeness, legibility, and timeliness of the data reported.  
 All source documents should be completed in a neat, legible manner to ensure accurate 
interpretation of data.   
 
9.1.5.2  STUDY RECORDS RETENT ION  
Study documents should be retained for a minimum of 3 years after the completion of the study . 
These documents should be retained for a longer period, however, if required by local 
regulations.  
 
9.1.6 PROTOCOL DEVIATIONS  
A protocol deviation is any noncompliance with the clinical trial protocol  requirements. The 
noncompliance may be either on the part of the subject, the investigator, or the study site staff. As a result of deviations, corrective actions are to be developed by the site and implemented 
promptly.

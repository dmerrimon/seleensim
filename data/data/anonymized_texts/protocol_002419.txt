Study Duration:
Patients will be dosed for 101 weeks (51 infusions), preceded b y a Screening/baseline period 
of up to 28 day s and followed by  a 30 -day Safet y Follow -up Period.
Study Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria:
Inclusion c riteria
Each patient must meet all the following criteria to be enrolled in this study:
1.The patient has a documented diagnosis of t ype 1 Gaucher disease, as documented by 
deficient glucocerebrosidase (GCB) activity  in leukocy tes (whole blood only ) or cultu red 
skin fibroblasts. Diagnosis by  only dry blood spot test is insufficient. Diagnosis may be 
based on results obtained prior to Screening if documented in the patient’s medical history . 
2. Patients must have a L S BMD Z -score < -1 or BMD T -score of < -1 as mea sured b y DXA 
during the screening phase.
3.Patient is treatment
-naïve, ie, should not have received ERT or SRT in the 12 months prior 
to enrollment.
4.The patient is ≥18 and ≤70 y ears of age. 
5. Female patients of childbearing potential must agree to use a medicall y acceptable method 
of contraception at all times during the stud y. (See Section 6.8.3 for acceptable methods of 
contraception).
6.The patient, or patient’s legally  authorized representative (s), if applicable, understands the 
nature, scope, and possible consequences of the study and has provided written informed 
consent that has been approved b y the Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (I RB/IEC).
7.The patient must be sufficiently  cooperative to participate in this clinical study as judged 
by the investigator.
Exclusion criteria
Patients who meet an y of the following criteria will be excluded from the study:
1.Neurological s ymptoms indicating that the patient may  have t ype 3 Gaucher disease.
2.A significant comorbidity, which, as determined by the investigator, might compromise 
study  assessment, affect study  data or confound the study  results (eg, malignancies, 
primary  biliary  cirrhosis, autoimmune liver disease, etc).
3.Any osteoporosis- specific treatment (eg, bisphosphonates) or treatment with ery thropoietin 
(or erythropoietin -like substances) during the past year.
4. Structural, joint- associated bone damage of such extent and severity  that t he investigator 
deems it could impact participation in the study  and assessment of relevant study  endpoints 
(eg, pain).
5.The patient is pregnant or lactating.
6.The patient has had a splenectom y.(This criterion is not meant to exclude subjects who 
have acces sory spleens.)
7.The patient is enrolled in another clinical stud y that involves clinical investigations or use 
of an y investigational product (drug or device) within 30 days prior to study enrollment or 
at an y time during the study. 
8.Severe vitamin D deficiency  to the level that would be expected to result in osteomalacia 
(vitamin D < 10 ng/mL [25 nmol/L ]). If there is mild vitamin D insufficiency  at screening 
(vitamin D >10 and < 30 ng/mL) treat with 4000 IU vitamin D per day  for 1 month and 
rescreen.

Statistical Methods: 
Statistical analy ses will be based on the intent- to-treat (ITT) principle for all efficacy  
variables. The ITT anal ysis will be based on all enrolled patients who received at least 1 study
drug infusion (full or partial). Summary statistics will be provided for the changes and 
percent changes from baseline for each parameter . Two -sided 95% confidence intervals in 
themean changes and mean percent changes from baseline will be presented for each 
endpoint.
Continuous data collected at baseline and subsequent study  visits will be summarized, and the 
mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median values for each variable will be 
tabulated to facilitate the search for trends over time tha t may  be attributable to study  drug. 
Categorical variables will be presented in terms of frequencies and percent. Within patient 
changes from baseline will be examined using 1 sample t -test or Wilcoxon signed rank test. 
Statistical significance will be defined at the 0.05 level. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized as frequencies and percentages, 
and data will be presented using descriptive statistics. 
In general, descriptive statistics and graphs will be used for the presentation o f study  results 
including, if relevant, graphs showing the treatment effect over time for patients individually  
and overall. 
The safet y population will be used for all safety analyses and is defined as all enrolled patients 
who received at least 1 study  drug infusion (full or partial). Safet y will be evaluated on the 
basis of AEs reported, clinical laboratory  data, use of concomitant medications, vital signs, and 
physical examinations. In addition, blood samples will be analy zed for determination of the 
presence of anti -velaglucerase alfa antibodies.
Sample Size 
Determination
In aprevious protocol version ( Amendment 4), approximately  40 patients were planned for 
enrollment in order to achieve a total of 34 evaluable patients (driven b y the key  secondary  
efficacy  endpoint), assuming a 15 % drop- out rate. A total of 34 evaluable p atients provided 
99% power to detect a significant change in L S BMD Z -score from baseline after 24 months of 
treatment (primary  efficacy  endpoint) when in fact there is a +0.6 change (improvement) in 
Z-score. The calculation assumed an alpha of 0.05 2- sided t -test) and a standard deviation of 
change of 0.6 based on data from stud y HGT -GCB -044. The 34 evaluable patients also 
conferred 80% power to detect a significant change in one of the key  secondary  endpoints, 
namely  the change from baseline in L S BMD Z-score after 12 months of treatment. 
Assumptions for the key  secondary  endpoint power calculation were also based on study  
HGT -GCB -044 in which a +0.25 change in in Z -score at 12 months was reported with a 
standard deviation of 0.5. 
In the previous amendment (Amendmen t 5), the number of patients planned for enrolment was 
revised based on the patient recruitment and retention experience to date to allow for a more 
realistic and achievab le recruitment target. Cumulative enrollment data collected from study  
initiation to date indicate a suboptimal enrollment rate of 0.5 patient permonth.

Study enrollment is hindered b y the considerable prevalence of screen failures (approximately  
50%) res ulting from the limited global pool of naïve patients with Gaucher disease who 
demonstrate bone involvement at baseline and who meet the eligibility  criteria of this study .
Based on this information, the number of patients planned for enrollment was reduce d to at 
least 19 patients in order to yield 13 evaluable patients. To be considered evaluable, a patient 
must have an eligible DXA score at Baseline and at 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]).The 
number of evaluable patients was determined assuming a drop -out rate of 30% based on the 
rate of earl y discontinuations reported during the first 2 years of the stud y.With 13 evaluable 
patients and assuming the same effect size (increase in L S BMD Z -score of +0.6) and standard 
deviation (0.6) values at 24 months from study  HGT -GCB -044, the study  will be 90% powered 
to detect significant changes (alpha 0.05) in L S BMD Z -score at 24 month s(primary  efficacy  
endpoint). As the revised sample size no longer provides adequate statistical power for the
detect ion of signi ficant changes in the key  secondary  endpoints defined in the previous 
protocol version, those were demoted to secondary  endpoints in the current amendment .

1INTRODUCTION
1.1 Bone Pathology in Gaucher Disease - An Unmet Medical Need
Gaucher disease, a pan -ethnic, autosomal, recessive disease with an estimated 30,000 persons 
with type 1 disease worldwide (Cox and Schofield, 1997), is the most common 
glycosphingolipid (GSL) storage disorder (Cox et al., 2003). Despite the pan -ethnicity  ofthe 
disorder, there is a particularly high prevalence in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The disease 
occurs when an inherited deficiency  of the l ysosomal enzy me glucocerebrosidase (GCB) leads to 
progressive accumulation of glucocerebroside within macroph ages and subsequent tissue and 
organ damage. Glucocerebrosidase is required for hy drolysis of glucocerebroside to glucose and 
cerebroside. 
Gaucher disease is a multisy stem disorder with clinical features reflective of the distribution of 
abnormal macropha ges (Gaucher cells) in the liver, spleen, bone marrow, skeleton, lungs, and 
occasionall y, lymph nodes (Beutler and Grabowski, 2001 ).Accumulation of 
glucocerebroside -containing cells (mainly  macrophages or macrophage -like cells) in the liver
and spleen leads to secondary  changes, including organomegal y, which can be massive, 
particularl y in the case of the spleen. Bone involvement results in skeletal abnormalities and 
deformities as well as bone pain and bone crises. Deposits in the bone marr ow and splenic 
sequestration lead to d ysfunction with clinically significant anemia and thrombocytopenia. 
The disease has been classified into 3 clinical subty pes based on the presence or absence of 
neurological s ymptoms and severit y of neurological symptoms (Beutler and Grabowski, 2001 ).
Type1 Gaucher disease, the most common form accounting for more than 90% of all cases,
(Pastore s et al., 2004 )does not involve the CNS; ty pical manifestations include hepatomegal y, 
splenomegaly , thrombocy topenia, bleeding tendencies, anemia, hy permetabolism, skeletal 
pathology , growth retardation, pulmonary  disease, and decreased quality  of life (QoL) (Pastores 
et al., 2004 ).Patients with ty pe 2 Gaucher disease present with acute neurological deterioration, 
and those with ty pe 3 disease typicall y display a more subacute neurological course. 
Most research effort to date has focused on strategies for augmenting enz yme levels to 
compensate for the underly ing defect; enzy me replacement therapy  (ERT) has been the 
cornerstone of treatment for Gaucher disease since the early  1990s and is highl y effective in 
improving man y of the clinical manifestations (Cox et al., 2003).
1.2 Experience with ERT for Bone -related Complications of Gaucher Disease 
Data from the International Collaborative Gaucher Group (ICGG) demonstrate that 
approximately  90% of all patients with Gaucher disease should achieve normal hemoglobin 
concentration within 2 years of i nitiation of treatment (Cox et al., 2003). Enzy me replacement 
therap y reduces organomegal y, improves hematological parameters, and positively  impacts
health- related QoL (Weinreb et al., 2002; Masek et al., 1999).
Despite the availabilit y since 1991 of the first ERT for Gaucher disease, the management 
of the 
skeletal manifestations of the disease remains a significant unmet medical need. Skeletal 
complications are a frequent occurrence in patients with Gaucher disease.

4INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
4.1 Overall Study Design and Plan
This is a multicenter, open- label, single -arm, Phase 4 study  to prospectively  evaluate the effect 
of VPRI V on bone -related pathology  in treatment -naïve pati ents with ty pe 1 Gaucher disease. In 
order to yield 13 evaluable patients, at least 19patients will be enrolled to receive VPRI V at the 
recommended starting dose for treatment -naïve patients of 60 U/kg EOW by a minimum 
60-minute intravenous infusion. To be considered evaluable, a patient must have an eligible 
DXA score at Baseline and at 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]).
The primary  endpoint is the change from baseline to 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]) in LS 
BMD Z -score. Bone mineral densit y will b e measured using DXA, and the results will be 
converted to Z- scores appropriate for the patient’s age, sex, and race. 
See Appendix 1 for the Study  Schedule of Events table.
4.2 Rationale for Study Design and Comparator Group
Bone -related problems are a critic al unmet medical need in Gaucher disease and there is reason 
to believe that treatment with VPRI V may  lead to significant bone and bone -related effects as 
early as 12 months after initiation of treatment in ERT -naïve patients. Twenty -one 
treatment -naïve pa tients received initial VPRIV therapy  at a dose of 60 U/kg in Study  TKT032 
or HGT- GCB -039 and showed a mean increase in LS BMD Z -score that was statistically  
significant at the first post -baseline assessment (9 months for those patients in 
Study HGT -GCB -039 and 12 months for those patients in Study  TKT032). 
In consideration of the rarity  of Gaucher disease, a single -arm study  was chosen because a 
placebo-controlled trial would not be feasible or ethical for the proposed indication. 
4.3 Study Duration
It is ex pected that the duration of study  participation for each subject will be approximately  
110 weeks, including 101 weeks of treatment (51 infusions), additional screening/baseline 
assessments taking up to 4 weeks, and 4 weeks of safet y follow up after treatme nt is completed. 
It is expected that 24 months of treatment is sufficient to observe statistically  significant changes 
in lumbar spine BMD, based on previous experience in Study  TKT025EXT and 
Study HGT -GCB -044.

6STUDY TREATMENT
6.1 Description of Treatment
6.1.1 Inve stigational Product
The investigational product to be used in this study  is VPRIV for intravenous infusion. 
Velaglucerase alfa is supplied as a sterile, preservative- free, l yophilized powder in single -use 
vials.
6.1.2 Comparator
Not applicable.
6.2 Treatment Adminis tered
All enrolled patients will receive VPRIV b y aminimum 60-minute intravenous infusion at the 
recommended approved starting dose for treatment- naïve patients of 60 U/kg EOW. Patients will 
continue to receive 60 U/kg EOW for 24 months (101 weeks). A 30 -day follow -up period is 
planned after the final dose. 
6.3 Selection and Timing of Dose for Each Patient
All enrolled patients will receive VPRIV at the same dose, ie, 60 U/kg EOW, which is the 
recommended approved starting dose for patients who are naïve to E RT and SRT for Gaucher 
disease. The first dose of VPRI V will be based on the patient’s weight at screening (Day s -28 to 
Day -4). A change in patient weight of ±5% from screening or the last weight used to recalculate 
the dose will require a new dose recalc ulation by  the clinical site. Weight will be measured every  
12weeks throughout the study , with an y dosing adjustment to be completed prior to the next 
dose. When a weight change of ±5% is identified, the dose should be adjusted as soon as 
possible, but no later than the next bi- weekly  study  visit. If the dose can be adjusted prior to the 
infusion on the same day, this adjustment should be performed; however, if the dose cannot be 
adjusted on the same day, the dose must be adjusted prior to the next bi -weekly  infusion. It is 
acceptable for the dose adjustment to occur at either of the following times in the study :
1)The dose adjustment to occur on the same day  a weight change of ±5% from the 
screening weight or weight at last dose adjustment is identified at t he clinic site 
(
Weeks 13, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89); or
2)
The dose adjustment to occur at the next bi- weekly  study  visit after a weight change of 
±5% from the screening weight or weight at last dose adjustment is identified at the clinic 
site ( Weeks 1 3, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89).
For dosing calculations, patient weight can be rounded to the nearest 0.5 kg, VPRIV dose to the 
nearest Unit, and dose volume to the nearest 0.1 mL
Study  drug infusions are to occur on approximately  the same day  of the week, but may  occu r 
every  14 day s (±7 day s) of the target day  in order to facilitate patient scheduling. If at all 
possible, missed infusions should be avoided.

Ifapatient isnotdosed within 21daysfrom their scheduled dose, the patient should receive the 
next infusion as soon as possible. I t may  be acceptable to give the next infusion as earl y as 
7days after the previous infusion. Subsequent infusions will return to the original schedule. 
6.4 Method of Assigning Patients to Treatment Groups
Not applicable; single -armed s tudy, all enrolled patients are to receive the same dose of VPRIV.
6.5 Blinding
Not applicable; this is an open -label stud y.
6.6 Home Infusion of Velaglucerase alfa
The first three velaglucerase alfa infusions are to be administered at the clinical site. After the
first 3 doses, patients who have not experienced a treatment-related serious adverse event or an 
infusion-related adverse event of more than mild severit y ma y receive their subsequent infusions 
at home by  qualified and trained medical personnel, per the d iscretion and direction of the 
Investigator. Patients who have experienced an infusion -related adverse event of more than mild 
severit y ma y be re -evaluated at a later time point during the stud y for consideration to transition 
to home infusions. Patients r eceiving velaglucerase alfa as home therapy  will be required to 
return to the clinical site at Weeks 13, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89, and 103. Please refer to Appendix 9
for information on transferring visits at Weeks 77 and 89 to home therap y and the addition of 
dose continuation infusions due to the COVID -19 pandemic.
The qualified, trained medical personnel will follow the instruction manual provided separatel y 
from this protocol that outlines all operating procedures to be followed for this study  including 
drug transport, reconstitution and the required patient assessments before, during, and after 
infusion of study  drug. Clinical evaluations will remain under the medical supervision of the 
Investigator. Appropriate medical support including adequatel y traine d personnel in emergency  
measures, should be readily  available when velaglucerase alfa is administered. If anaphy lactic or 
other acute severe reactions occur, immediatel y discontinue the infusion and initiate appropriate 
medical treatment.
In the home sett ing, vital signs and documentation of adverse events will be collected at each 
visit. The qualified, trained medical personnel will evaluate and report to the study  site the 
occurrence of adverse events. Study  site personnel will report SAEs as described in 
Section 7.15.2. I n addition, a urine pregnancy  test will be conducted at each home infusion visit 
for women of childbearing potential. If the result is positive, the infusion will not be 
administered, and a blood sample will be collected for serum pregna ncy testing. The next 
infusion of velaglucerase alfa will not be administered until the results of the serum pregnancy  
test are received. If the serum human chorionic gonadotropin (β -hCG) result is also positive, the 
Investigator is to contact the Shire M edical Monitor to determine the appropriate course of 
action.
If there are no infusion-related reactions ( IRRs ) during the first 3 infusions the observation and 
vital signs post -infusion can be omitted at the discretion of the investigator.

SHP -GCB -402 Protocol Amendment 6
velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®) 02 Nov 2020
If an infusion- related adverse event of more than mild severity  occurs while a patient is receiving 
treatment at home, the qualified, trained medical personnel will maintain contact with the 
investigator for treatment advice. The infusion should not be restarted in the h ome setting after 
an infusion-related adverse event of more than mild severit y. Home therap y can onl y then 
resume at subsequent infusions after agreement is reached b y the investigator and the Shire 
Medical Monitor.
6.7 Infusion Reactions and Management
Infusions of proteins can be associated with reactions to the infusion that may  or may  not be 
immune mediated. Thus, potential reactions to the infusion of the investigational drug are 
unpredictable. S ymptoms suggestive of hy persensitivity , including anaphy laxis , have been 
observed in patients receiving ERT. Sy mptoms included pruritus, flushing, urticaria, 
angioedema, chest discomfort, dy spnea, coughing, cy anosis, and hy potension.
The management of IRRs should be based on the severit y of the reaction. Such manage ment may  
include, at the discretion of the investigator, slowing the infusion rate, treatment with 
medications such as antihistamines, antipy retics, and/or corticosteroids and/or stopping and 
resuming treatment with prolonged infusion duration.
Pretreatment with antihistamines and/or corticosteroids may prevent subsequent reactions in 
those cases where s ymptomatic treatment was previously  required. Pretreatment of infusion 
reactions is left to the clinical judgment of the investigator.
In cases when require d and at the discretion of the study  site, additional clinical laboratory  
samples may  be collected for further anal ysis of IRRs. Suggested laboratory  evaluation includes 
complete blood count, complete metabolic panel including liver and renal function test s, CH50, 
C3, C4, C1 inhibitor, C3a and C5a, total try ptase, histamine, immune complex and serum IgE 
levels .
6.8 Restrictions
6.8.1 Prior Therapy
The use of an y osteoporosis -specific treatment (eg, bisphosphonates) or treatment with 
erythropoietin within the past y ear is an exclusion criterion. To be eligible for the study , patients 
are to be treatment -naïve (ie, have not received ERT or SRT in the 12 months prior to study  
enrollment).
6.8.2 Concomitant Therapy
Patients who enter the study  receiving supplemental therapy  (eg, supplemental iron, calcium) 
must remain on a constant dose and regimen throughout the stud y. All patients will receive 
800IU vitamin D (oral) daily starting at the week 1 visit for the duration of the study. Initiation 
of osteoporosis -specific therap y or treatment with ery thropoietin during the trial is prohibited.

7STUDY PROCEDURES
Detailed descriptions of patient evaluations required for this protocol are described in this 
section. These eval uations will be performed during the indicated day s and weeks (± 7 day s) of 
the study  (Study  Schedule of Events table in Appendix 1 ). 
All data collected are to be recorded on the appropriate electronic case report form (eCRF).
7.1 Informed Consent
Prior to con ducting an y study -related procedures, written informed consent must be obtained 
from the patient, or the patient’s legall y authorized representative(s) and assent from the patient 
(if applicable).
The nature, scope, and possible consequences, including ris ks and benefits, of the study  will be 
explained to the patient, or the patient’s legall y authorized representative(s) by the investigator or 
designee in accordance with the guidelines described in Section 11.4. Documentation and filing 
of informed consent documents should be completed according to Section 11.4.
7.2 Study Entrance Criteria
At screening, each patient will be reviewed for eligibility  against the study  entrance criteria 
(Section 5.2and Section 5.3). Patients who do not meet the study  entrance crit eria will not be 
allowed to participate in the study . The reason(s) for the patient’s ineligibility  for the study  will 
be documented.

velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®) 02 Nov 2020
7.6 Glucocerebrosidase Genotype Analysis
At screening, all patients will have a blood sample collected for Gaucher disease (GBA) gene 
sequencing; however, GBA sequencing is not required at screening if documented results are 
available in the medical history . The sample will be sent to a central laboratory  for anal yzing and
reporting. The results will be used for statistical analy sis purposes. 
7.7 Height and Weight
Height and weight will be recorded for all patients.
The measurements for height will be collected b y way of a calibrated stadiometer. Height 
measurements will be c ollected 3 times for each patient at the specified study  visits, and the 
average of the 3 measurements will be determined and recorded at the site.
The clinical site staff will be instructed to use calibrated scales for weight measurement.
7.8 Investigational Product Administration
All doses of VPRI V will be administered by  continuous intravenous infusion. Study  drug 
infusions are to occur on approximately  the same day  of the week but may  occur every  14days 
(±7days of the target day ) in order to facilitate patient scheduling. If at all possible, missed 
infusions should be avoided. If a patient is not dosed within 21 day s from their scheduled dose, 
the patient should receive the next infusion as soon as possible. I t may  be acceptable to give the 
next infusion as early as 7 days after the previous infusion. Subsequent infusions will return to 
the original schedule.
The infusion time will be at least 60 minutes (1 hour). For example, a 60 U/kg dose will be 
delivered at a rate of at least 1 U/kg/minute. The infus ion of VPRI V will be delivered 
intravenously  with an in -line sterilizing filter ( 0.2 micron or 0.22 micron) .
The dose of VPRIV will be calculated based on the patient’s weight determined at screening. A 
change in weight of ±5% from screening or the previous weight assessment in the study  will 
require recalculation of the dose.
If a patient experiences an infusion- related AE (as defined in Section 7.14.1.7 ) during the 
infusion of investigational product, the investigator should decide, based on his or her cl inical 
judgment, whether the infusion should be slowed or temporaril y or permanently discontinued.
Patients experiencing recurrent infusion -related AEs may  be pre -medicated, as described in 
Section 6.6. If infusions continue without incident, then tapering of medications can be 
considered.

velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®) 02 Nov 2020
Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)
D-dimer
The laboratory  tests for Hematology , Serum Chemistry , and Urinaly sis are t o be performed as 
indica ted in S ection 7.11.5 and Section 7.11.6 and the Appendix 1 Schedule of Events (at 
Baseline and Weeks 13, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89, and 103).
7.11.15 Antibody Assessments
Blood samples will be collected for all patients for the determination of anti -velaglucerase alfa 
antibodies prior to the patient receiving the first dose of VPRIV at the baseline visit and at 
specified time points throughout the stud y (Weeks 13, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89 and 103). 
Blood samples collected for anti- velaglucerase alfa antibody  determina tion will be evaluated at 
Shire Bioanal ytical and Biomarker Development or a contract research laboratory  designated b y 
the Sponsor. These samples will be anal yzed for anti -therapeutic protein binding antibodies. 
Confirmed positive samples will undergo assessment of neutralizing activity .
7.11.16 Pregnancy Testing
Female patients of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy  test at each study  visit.
At screening, pregnancy  testing will be cond ucted using a urine test and a serum human 
chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) test. Patients with a positive result for either test will not be 
eligible for this study . The screening urine pregnancy  test will be performed locally ,and the 
screening serum pregn ancy  test will be anal yzed at the central laboratory  responsible for this 
study .
At all other visits, pregnancy  testing will be performed with a urine test. If the urine test is 
positive, a blood sample will be collected for serum β- hCG testing. The clinic al site’s local 
laboratory  will anal yze and report all subsequent urine and serum pregnancy  testing results.
If, during the Treatment Period (Week 1 to Week 103), a urine pregnancy  test result is positive, 
the patient will not receive the planned infusion (s) until the result of the serum test is available. If 
the serum β-hCG result is also positive, no additional doses of the investigational product are to 
be administered and the investigator must contact the Shire Medical Monitor. An y report of 
pregnancy  for an y female study  participant must be reported within 1 business day .
7.12 Sample Collection, Storage, and Shipping
All samples will be stored and secured in a way  that ensures that unauthorized access is 
prohibited, and the samples are not lost, allowed to deteriorate, or are accidentally  or illegall y 
destroy ed. Detailed sample collection, processing and shipping, and storage procedures will be 
provided in the Study  Operations and/or Laboratory  Manuals.

velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®) 02 Nov 2020
The medical assessment of severit y is determined by using the following definitions:
Mild:     A ty pe of AE that is usually  transient and may  require onl y minimal treatment or 
therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally  interfere with usual activities of daily  
living.
Moderate:     A ty pe of AE that is usually  alleviated with specific therapeutic intervention. The 
event interferes with usual activ ities of daily  living, causing discomfort but poses no significant 
or permanent risk of harm to the research subject.
Severe:     A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly affects 
clinical status, or may  require intensi ve therapeutic intervention.
7.14.1.2 Relationship Categorization
A phy sician/investigator must make the assessment of relationship to investigational product for 
each AE. The investigator should decide whether, in his or her medical judgment, there is a 
reasonable possibility  that the event may  have been caused b y the investigational product. If 
there is no valid reason for suggesting a relationship, then the AE should be classified as “not 
related”. Otherwise, if there is an y valid reason, even if undetermined or untested, for suspecting 
a possible cause -and-
effect relationship between the investigational product and the occurrence 
of the AE, then the AE should be considered “related”. The causality  assessment must be 
documented in the source document.
The followin g additional guidance may  be helpful:
Term Relationship Definition
RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the administration of the 
investigational product is compelling and/or follows a known or suspected response 
pattern to that product , and the event cannot be explained by the subject’s medical 
condition, other therapies, or accident.
Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by other factors such as the subject’s underlying 
medical condition, concomitant therapy, or accident a nd no plausible temporal or 
biologic relationship exists between the investigational product and the event.
7.14.1.3 Outcome Categorization
The outcome of AEs must be recorded during the course of the stud y on the CRF. Outcomes are 
as follows:
Fatal
Not Recovered /Not Resolved
Recovered/Resolved
Recovered/Resolved with Sequelae
Recovering/Resolving
Unknown

Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 43
SHP -GCB -402 Protocol Amendment 6
velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®) 02 Nov 2020
7.14.1.4 Symptoms of the Disease under Study
Symptoms of the disease under study  should not be classed as AEs as long as they  are within the 
normal day -to-day fluctuatio n or expected progression of the disease and are part of the efficacy  
data to be collected in the study; however, significant worsening of the s ymptoms should be 
recorded as an AE.
7.14.1.5 Clinical Laboratory and Other Safety Evaluations
A change in the value of a clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG assessment can represent an AE 
if the change is clinically relevant or if, during treatment with the investigational product, a shift 
of a parameter is observed from a normal value to an abnormal value, or a further worsening of 
an alread y abnormal value. When evaluating such changes, the extent of deviation from the 
reference range, the duration until return to the reference range, either while continuing treatment 
or after the end of treatment with the investigational product, and the range of variation of the 
respective parameter within its reference range, must be taken into consideration.
If, at the end of the treatment phase, there are abnormal clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG 
values which were not presen t at the pre -treatment value observed closest to the start of study  
treatment, further investigations should be performed until the values return to within the 
reference range or until a plausible explanation (eg, concomitant disease) is found for the 
abno rmal values.
The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory , vital sign, or ECG parameter is clinicall y 
significant and whether it represents an AE.
7.14.1.6 Pregnancy
Any report of pregnancy for a female study  participant or the partner of a male study  participant 
must be reported within 24 hours to the Shire Global Drug Safet y Department using the Shire 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form. A copy of the Shire 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form (and any  applicable follow -up 
reports) must also be sent to the/Shire Medical Monitor using the details specified in the 
emergency  contact information section of the protocol.
The p regnant female study  participant must be withdrawn from the study .
Every  effort should be made to gather information regarding the pregnancy  outcome and 
condition of the infant for every  pregnant female study  participant withdrawn from the study  and 
for pr egnant partners of male study  participants. It is the responsibility  of the investigator to 
obtain this information within 30 calendar day s after the initial notification and approximately  30 
calendar days post partum.
Pregnancy  complications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital abnormality  
are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event 
and Non -serious AEs Required by  the Protocol Form. Note: An elective abortion is not 
considered an SAE.
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 44
SHP -GCB -402 Protocol Amendment 6
velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®) 02 Nov 2020
In addition to the above, if the investigator determines that the pregnancy  meets serious criteria, 
it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event and 
Non-serious AEs Required by  the Protocol Form as well as the Shire Inves tigational and 
Marketed Products Pregnancy  Report Form. The test date of the first positive serum/urine 
-HCG test or ultrasound result will determine the pregnancy  onset date.
Pregnancy  and lactation are exclusion criteria for this study . Any report of pr egnancy  for a 
female stud y participant or the partner of a male study participant during the course of the stud y 
and through 30 day s after the patient’s last dose of VPRI V must be reported to the Sponsor. 
Pregnancy  is not to be reported as an AE; the Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy  
Report Form should be used to report the pregnancy . The pregnancy  will be followed up through 
delivery  or final outcome. 
7.14.1.7 Infusion -related Adverse Event Definition
An IRR will be defined as an AE that 1) begins ei ther during or within 24 hours after the start of 
the infusion and 2) is judged as related to study  drug. 
Other AEs that occur prior to the infusion, along with AEs associated with protocol -defined 
testing and assessments (laboratory  testing and phy sical examinations) that were performed prior 
to the infusion will not be defined as IRRs. All AEs should be recorded together with a causalit y 
assessment.
7.14.1.8 Abuse, Misuse, Overdose, and Medication Error
Abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication error (as defined be low) must be reported to the sponsor 
according to the SAE reporting procedure whether or not they  result in an AE/SAE as described 
in Section 7.15.2. Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply  to reports of 
abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors unless these result in an SAE. 
The categories below are not mutually  exclusive; the event can meet more than 1 category .
•Abuse – Persistent or sporadic intentional intake of investigational product when used for a 
non-medical purpose (eg , to alter one’s state of consciousness or get high) in a manner that 
may be detrimental to the individual and/or society
•Misuse –Intentional use of investigational product other than as directed or indicated at any  
dose (Note: this includes a situation w here the investigational product is not used as directed 
at the dose prescribed b y the protocol)
•Overdose –
Intentional or unintentional intake of a dose of investigational medicinal product 
10% higher than the protocol- specified dose. 
•Medication Error – A mistake made in prescribing, dispensing, administration, and/or use 
of the investigational medicinal product
•Cases of subjects missing doses of the investigational product are not considered 
reportable as medication errors.
•Medication errors should be co llected/reported for all products under investigation.
•The administration and/or use of an expired investigational product should be considered 
as a reportable medication error.

7.15 Serious Adverse Event Procedures
7.15.1 Reference Safety Information
The reference fo r safet y information for this study  is the investigator’s brochure for US 
investigator sites and the Summary  of Product Characteristics for European investigator sites, 
which the sponsor has provided under separate cover to all investigators.
7.15.2 Reporting Procedures
All initial and follow -up SAE reports must be reported by  the investigator to the Shire Global 
Drug Safet y Department andthe Shire Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness 
ofthe event. Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAE s does not apply  to reports of 
abuse, misuse, overdose, or medication errors (see Section 7.14.1.8) unless they  result in an 
SAE.
The investigator must complete, sign, and date the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event 
and Non -serious AEs Required by the Protocol Form and verify  the accuracy  of the information 
recorded on the form with the corresponding source documents (Note: Source documents are not 
to be sent unless requested) and fax or e -mail the form to the Shire Global Drug Safet y
Department. A copy of the Shire Clinical Study  Serious Adverse Event and Non- serious AEs 
Required b y the Protocol Form (and an y applicable follow -up reports) must also be sent to the 
Shire Medical Monitor using the details specified in the emergency  contact information section 
of the protocol.
7.15.3 Serious Adverse Event Definition
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any  untoward medical occurrence (whether considered to be 
related to investigational product or not) that at any dose:
•Results in death.
•Is life -threatening. Note: The term ‘life -threatening’ in the definition of “serious” refers to an 
event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to 
an event which h ypothetically might have caused death if it was more severe.
•Requires inp atient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. Note: 
Hospitalizations, which are the result of elective or previousl y scheduled surgery for 
pre-existing conditions, which have not worsened after initiation of treatment, should not 
be classified as SAEs. For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia 
repair would not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from a 
hospitalization for an elective or previousl y scheduled surgery  that meet(s) serious criteria 
must be reported as SAE(s).
•Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity .
•Is a congenital abnormality /birth defect.
•Is an important medical event. Note: I mportant medical events that may  not result in death, 
be life -threatening, or r equire hospitalization may  be considered an SAE when, based upon 
appropriate medical judgment, they  may  jeopardize the subject and may  require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. 
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 46
SHP -GCB -402 Protocol Amendment 6
velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®) 02 Nov 2020
Examples ofsuch medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home; blood dy scrasias or convulsions that do not 
result in inpatient hospitalization; or the development of drug dependency  or drug abuse.
7.15.4 Serious Adverse Event Collection Time Frame
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the 
informed consent until the defined follow- up period stated in Section 8.5and must be reported to 
the Shire Global Drug Safety Departmen t andthe CRO/ Shire Medical Monitor within 24 hours 
of the first awareness of the event. 
In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and discovered by  the 
investigator at an y interval after the study has completed must be r eported to the Shire Global 
Drug Safet yDepartment within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event.
7.15.5 Serious Adverse Event Onset and Resolution Dates
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study ) are collected from the time the subject signs the 
inform ed consent until the defined follow- up period stated in Section 8.5and must be reported to 
the Shire Global Drug Safety Department andthe Shire Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the 
first awareness of the event. 
In addition, any  SAE(s) considered “rela ted” to the investigational product and discovered by  the 
investigator at an y interval after the study has completed must be reported to the Shire Global 
Drug Safet yDepartment within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event.
7.15.6 Fatal Outcome
Any SAE that results in the subject’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the primary  cause of death) 
must have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death recorded as the resolution date. For 
all other events ongoing at the time of death that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the 
outcome should be considered not resolved, without a resolution date recorded.
Action taken with the investigational product should be an active decision by  the investigator. 
For an y SAE that results in the subject’s death or any ongoing events at the time of death, unless 
another stud y drug action was previousl y taken (eg, drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the 
action taken with the investigational product should be recorded as “dose not changed” or “not 
applicable” (if the su bject never received investigational product). The study  drug action of 
withdrawn should not be selected solel y as a result of the subject’s death.
7.15.7 Regulatory Agency, Institutional Review Board, Ethics Committee, and Site 
Reporting
Thesponsor or sponsor designee is responsible for notify ing the relevant regulatory  
authorities/ US central IRBs/EU central ECs of related, unexpected SAEs.
In addition, the sponsor or the sponsor’s designee is responsible for notifying active sites of all 
related, unexpected SA Es occurring during all interventional studies across the velaglucerase alfa 
program.

The investigator is responsible for notifying the local IRB, local EC, or the relevant local 
regulatory  authorit y of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required.
7.16 Removal of Patients from the Trial or Investigational Product
A patient’s participation in the study  may  be discontinued at any  time at the discretion of the 
investigator. The following may  be justifiable reasons for the investigator to remove a patient 
from the study :
•Non-compliance, including failure to appear at 1 or more stud y visits
•The patient was erroneously  included in the study
•The patient develops an exclusion criterion 
•The patient suffers an intolerable AE
•The patient requests to be discontinued from the study
•The study is terminated by  the Sponsor
•Pregnancy
The patient, or the patient’s legally  authorized representative(s), acting on behalf of the patient is 
free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation in the study  at any  time without prejudice 
to further treatment.
If a patient, or the patient’s legally  authorized representative(s) acting on behalf of the patient, 
discontinues participation in the study  or the patient is discontinued by  the investigator,
reasonable efforts will be made to follow the patient through the end of study  assessments. The 
reason for refusal will be documented on the eCRF. Any  AEs experienced up to the point of 
discontinuation must be documented on the AE eCRF. If AEs are present when the patient 
withdraws from the study , the patient will be re -evaluated within 30 day s of withdrawal. All 
ongoing SAEs at the time of withdrawal will be followed until resolution.
7.17 Other Study Procedures
7.17.1 Safety -related Study Stopping Rules
This study  will be stopped and safet y data r eviewed if any  patient experiences a life -threatening 
SAE or a death occurs, if either is considered related to the investigational product.
Following the review of safet y data, the study will be either:
•Resumed unchanged
•Resumed with modifications to the protocol 
•Terminated
Patient safet y will be monitored on a continuous basis during this study until the last patient 
completes his or her last scheduled stud y visit/assessment. For patients who discontinue or are 
withdrawn prior to the Week 103 end of stu dy visit, a follow -up assessment for safety  will occur 
30 (±7) day s after their last infusion. This follow -up assessment may  be conducted over the 
telephone.

10PLANNED STATISTICAL ME THODS
10.1 General Considerations
This is a multicenter, open- label study  designed to evaluate the effect of VPRI V on bone -related 
pathology  in adult treatment -naïve patients with Ty pe 1 Gaucher disease. 
Statistical analy ses will be based o n the intent -to-treat (ITT) principle for all efficacy  
variables. The ITT anal ysis will be based on all enrolled patients who received at least 
1study drug infusion (full or partial). Summary  statistics will be provided for the changes 
andpercent changes from baseline for each parameter. Two -sided 95% confidence intervals 
inthemean changes and mean percent changes from baseline will be presented for each 
endpoint.
Continuous data collected at baseline and subsequent study visits will be summarized, and the 
mean, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, and median values for each variable will be 
tabulated to facilitate the search for trends over time which may  be attributable to study  drug. 
Categorical variables will be presented in terms of frequencies and percent. Within patient 
changes from baseline will be examined using 1 sample t-test or Wilcoxon signed rank test. 
Statistical significance will be defined at the 0.05 level. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized as frequencies and percentages, 
and data will be presented using descriptive statistics. 
In general, descriptive statistics and graphs will be used for the presentation of study  results 
including, if relevant, graphs showing the treatment effect over time for patients indiv idually  and 
overall. 
Safety  will be evaluated on the basis of AEs reported, clinical laboratory  data, use of 
concomitant medications, vital signs, and ph ysical examinations. I n addition, blood samples will 
be anal yzed for determination of the presence of anti-velaglucerase alfa antibodies. 
All statistical analy ses will be performed using SAS®software. An y changes to the analyses 
proposed in this protocol will be described in the statistical analy sis plan and/or the clinical study  
report. 
10.2 Determination o f Sample Size
In aprevious protocol version ( Amendment 4), approximately  40 patients were planned for 
enrollment in order to achieve a total of 34 evaluable patients (driven b y the key  secondary  
efficacy  endpoint) , assuming a 15 % drop- out rate. A total of 34 evaluable patients provide d
99% power to detect a significant change in L S BMD Z -score from baseline after 24 months of 
treatment (primary  efficacy  endpoint) when in fact there is a +0.6 change (improvement) in 
Z-score. The calculation assumed an alph a of 0.05 ( 2-sided t - test) and a standard deviation of 
change of 0.6 based on data from stud y HGT -GCB -044. The 34 evaluable patients also conferred 
80% power to detect a significant change in one of the key  secondary  endpoints, namely  the 
change from basel ine in LS BMD Z -score after 12 months of treatment.

velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®) 02 Nov 2020
Assumptions forthekeysecondary  endpoint power calculation were also based on stu dy 
HGT -GCB -044 in which a +0.25 change in in Z -score at 12 months was reported with a standard 
deviation of 0.5. 
In the previous amendment ( Amendment 5), the number of patients planned for enrolment was 
revised based on the patient recruitment and retention experience to date to allow for a more 
realistic and achievable recruitment target .Cumulative enrollment data collect ed from study  
initiation to date indicate a suboptimal enrollment rate of 0.5 patient permonth. Study  enrollment 
is hindered b ythe considerable prevalence of screen failure s (approximately  50%) resulting from 
the limited global pool of naïve patients wit h Gaucher disease who demonstrate bone 
involvement at baseline and who meet the eligibility criteria of this study .Based on this 
information, the number of patients planned for enrollment was reduced to at least 19 patients in 
order to yield 13 evaluable patients. To be considered evaluable, a patient must have an eligible 
DXA score at Baseline and at 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]). The number of evaluable 
patients was determined assuming a drop-out rate of 30% based on the rate of early 
discontinuati ons reported during the first 2 years of the study .With 13 evaluable patients and 
assuming the same effect size (increase in LS BMD Z -score of +0.6) and standard deviation (0.6)
values at 24 months from study  HGT -GCB -044, the study  will be 90% powered to detect 
significant changes (alpha 0.05) in L S BMD Z -score at 24 month s(primary  efficacy  endpoint).
As therevised sample size no longer provides adequate statistical power for the detect ion of
significant changes in the key  secondary  endpoints defined in the previous protocol version, 
those were demoted to secondary  endpoints in the current amendment.
10.3 Analysis Populations
The ITT population will be used for all efficacy  analy ses and is defined as all enrolled patients 
who received at least 1 study  drug infusion (full or partial). The safet y population will be used 
for all safety anal yses and is defined as all enrolled patients who received at least 1 study  drug 
infusion (full or partial). 
10.4 Patient Disposition
Patient disposition for those enrolled, treated , completed, or discontinued/withdrew will be 
presented in summary  tables using number and percentage of patients per category ; reasons for 
discontinuation/withdrawal will be presented. 
10.5 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics
Demographic (eg, age, sex, and race) and baseline characteristics (eg, medical history, disease 
history , and bone pathology ) will be anal yzed using the safet y population. Demographic and 
baseline characteristics will be summarized using either descriptive statistics or frequency  
distributions, as appropriate.

10.6 Primary Endpoint
10.6.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint
The primary  efficacy  endpoint is the change from baseline to 24 months (Week 103 [end of 
study ]) in LS BMD Z -score as measured b y DXA. The null hy pothesis is that there is no change 
from baseline to 24 months in L S BMD Z -scores. A statistically  significant change in BMD after 
24months of treatment is highl y clinicall y relevant in this patient population. One sample t -test 
or Wilcoxon signed rank test will be applied for the change from baseline of L S BMD Z -scores 
with patients whose LS BMD scores are collected after 24 months of treatment. A 95% 
confidence interval for the mean of the change from baseline will also be presented. 
As a sensitivity  anal ysis, the primary  efficacy  analy sis w ill be repeated b y apply ing last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) method. That is, if the LS BMD score is missing at 
24months (Week 103 [end of study ]), the last non -missing score before 24 months will be 
carried forward, and the score at baseline will not be carried forward for the anal ysis.
The descriptive summary statistics of the percentage of change from baseline of the LS BMD 
Z-score will also be generated. 
10.7 Secondary Endpoints
10.7.1 Safety Endpoints
All patients who receive at least 1 study  drug infusi on (full or partial) will be assessed for 
clinical safet y and tolerability . The safety  population will be used for the analy ses of the safet y 
endpoints. No formal statistical tests will be performed on the safet y parameters.
The number and proportion of patients for the following parameters will be descriptivel y 
summarized:
•Study  drug -related AEs
•Infusion- related AEs
•Serious AEs
•Use of concomitant medication
•Clinically  abnormal laboratory  tests (hematology , serum chemistry , and urinaly sis)
•Positive anti -velaglucerase alfa antibody  test
AEs will be coded using the MedDRA, and tabular summaries of AEs will be based on all 
TEAEs recorded. A TEAE is defined as an y AE that occurred on or after the time of the first 
infusion of study  drug until 30 days after the last infusion of study  drug. 
The number and proportion of patients experiencing an AE will be tabulated for the following:
•Overall summary  of AEs: Recurrent AEs observed within a patient will be counted once.
•AEs by  system organ class (SOC) and preferre d term (PT).
For non-commercial use only
Shire CONFIDENTIAL Page 57
SHP -GCB -402 Protocol Amendment 6
velaglucerase alfa (VPRIV®) 02 Nov 2020
•AEs by  SOC, PT, and severity : In the case of multiple occurrences of the same AEs (at the 
PT level) in an individual patient, the AE that is classified as the most severe (ie, maximum 
severit y) will be identified.
•AEs by  SOC, PT, and relationship: The AE with the closest relationship to the study  drug in 
the same PT level will be reported.
•SAEs, infusion- related AEs, and AEs that led to permanent discontinuation, by SOC and PT. 
Furthermore, an SAE listing and a listing of all patients who per manentl y discontinued due to an 
AE(s) will be provided. An infusion- related AE is defined as an AE that begins either during or 
within 24 hours after the start of the infusion and is judged as related to the investigational 
product.
Anti- velaglucerase alfa antibody  results will also be summarized. For this study , once the patient 
becomes antibod y positive to velaglucerase alfa, they will be considered positive for the 
remainder of the stud y. 
Any newl y occurring abnormalities or worsening from baseline in v ital signs, ECG, phy sical 
examination, or clinical laboratory  test data will be flagged. In addition, the number and 
proportion of patients with any  shifts in vital signs from normal before infusion to abnormal after 
infusion will be presented. Changes in laboratory  parameters will also be summarized using shift 
tables based on a classification of values as low, normal, or high with respect to the reference 
range.
10.7.2 Secondary Efficacy Endpoints
The secondary  efficacy  endpoints include the following evaluations: 
•Change from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) in LS BMD Z
-score. Assessments will be 
performed at the screening visit and Weeks 51 and 103 (end of stud y).
•Change from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) and 24 months (Week 103, end of study ) in 
LS BMD in g/c m2.
•Change from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) and 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]) in 
BMB score (MRI of LS and femur). Assessments will be performed at the baseline visit and 
Weeks 51 and 103 (end of study ).
•Change from baseline over time in hemoglobi n concentration. Assessments will be 
performed at baseline and Weeks 13, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89, and 103 (end of study ).
•Change from baseline over time in platelet count. Assessments will be performed at baseline 
and Weeks 13, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89, and 103 (end of study ) .
•Change from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) and 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]) in 
normalized liver volume as measured b y abdominal MRI . Assessments will be performed at 
the baseline visit and Weeks 51 and 103 (end of study ).
•Chang e from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) and 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]) in 
normalized spleen volume as measured b y MRI. Assessments will be performed at the 
baseline visit and Weeks 51 and 103 (end of stud y).

•Shifts in WHO BMD classification (normal bone density , osteopenia, osteoporosis), based on 
LS T -scores. Assessments will be performed at the baseline visit and Weeks 51 and 103 (end 
of study ).
For WHO BMD classification based on L S T-score endpoint, the number and proportion of 
patients classified as having normal (T -score ≥-1), osteopenia (- 2.5< T -score < -1), or 
osteoporosis(T -
score ≤- 2.5) BMD will be captured; patient shifts in BMD classification based on 
T
-score will be reported. 
For the remaining secondary  efficacy  parameters, 1 sample t- test or Wilcoxon signed rank 
testwill be applied for the change from baseline of each endpoint at each time point. I n this 
analysis, the LOCF method for missing values will be applied. As an additional anal ysis, a 
linear mixed -effects model will be used as a repeated measures anal ysis to investigate the 
improvement of efficacy  over time. This model uses all the clinical information obtained on a 
patient while allowing for the repeated measurements to exhibit correlation between 
observations within the same p atient. Estimates for the clinical parameters obtained over time 
will account for the baseline measurements and will be adjusted for demographic and baseline 
factors. This linear mixed- effects model will be described in more detail in a statistical anal ysis 
plan. 
The descriptive summary statistics of the percentage of change from baseline for the quantitative 
efficacy  endpoints will also be generated. 
10.7.3 Other Secondary Efficacy Endpoints (Health Economics and Outcomes 
Research Endpoints)
Health economic and outcomes research endpoints are secondary  endpoints. These include the 
following:
•Change from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) and 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]) in 
overall fatigue as measured by the BFI. Assessments will be performed at the baseline visit 
and Weeks 13, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89, and 103 (end of study ).
•Change from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) and 24 months (Week 103 [end of study ]) in 
bone pain as measured by questions taken from the BPI -SF©.
•Assessments will be performed at the basel ine visit and Weeks 13, 25, 37, 51, 65, 77, 89, and 
103 (end of stud y).
For the health economics and outcomes parameters, 1 sample t -test or Wilcoxon signed rank test 
will be applied for the change from baseline of each endpoint at each time point. I n this anal ysis, 
the L OCF method for missing values will be applied. 
The descriptive summary statistics of the percentage of change from baseline for the quantitative 
efficacy  endpoints will also be generated.

hazard(s) to patients. The I RB/IEC may  provide, if applicable regulator y authorities permit, 
expedited review and approval/favorable opinion for minor change(s) in ongoing studies that 
have the approval/favorable opinion of the I RB/IEC. The Sponsor will submit all protocol 
modifications to the regulatory  authorities in accord ance with the governing regulations.
A record of patients screened, but not entered into the study, is also to be maintained. No 
protocol exemption will be granted for this study .
When immediate deviation from the protocol is required to eliminate an immed iate hazard(s) to 
patients, the investigator will contact the Sponsor or its designee, if circumstances permit, to 
discuss the planned course of action. An y departures from the protocol must be fully documented 
as a protocol deviation. Protocol deviations will need to be reviewed b y the medical monitor and 
may also be required to be submitted to the I RB/IEC.
Protocol modifications will only  be initiated by  the Sponsor and must be approved by  the 
IRB/IEC and submitted to the FDA or other applicable internati onal regulatory  authority  before 
initiation.
11.10 Premature Closure of the Study
If the Sponsor, investigator, or regulatory  authorities discover conditions arising during the stud y 
which indicate that the clinical investigation should be halted due to an unacc eptable patient risk, 
the study  may  be terminated after appropriate consultation between the Sponsor and the 
investigator(s). In addition, a decision on the part of the Sponsor to suspend or discontinue 
development of the investigational product may  be mad e at any  time. Conditions that may  
warrant termination of the study or site include, but are not limited to:
•The discovery  of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the patients enrolled in 
the study
•Failure of the investigator to comply  with pertinent global regulations
•Submission of knowingly  false information from the study  site to the Sponsor or other

Selection and 
Timing of Dose 
for Each patien tThe first dose of VPRIV will be based on the patient’s weight at 
baseline screening (Days 3 -28 to Day -4 0). A change in 
patient weight of ±5% from baseline screening or the last 
weight used to recalculate the dose w ill require a ne w dose 
recalculation by the clinical site.
Study drug infusions are to occur on approximately the same 
day of the week, but may occur every 14 days (± 3 7days) of the 
target day in order to facilitate patient scheduling. If at all 
possible, missed infusions should be avoided. If a patient is not 
dosed within 1721 days from their scheduled dose, the patient 
should receive the next infusion as soon as possible.Weight measurement will 
be performed at screening 
to allow  for calculation of 
patient doses before 
baseline/Week 1 vis it.

Reactions and 
ManagementThe management of infusion -related reactions (IRRs) should be

include, at the discretion of the investigator, eg, slow ing the 
infusion rate, treatment with medications such as antihistamines, 
antipyretics, and/or corticosteroids and/or stopping and 
resuming treatment with increased prolonged infusion time
duration .
In cases when required and at site’s discretion, additional 
clinical laboratory samples can be collected for further 
analysis of IRRs. Suggested laboratory evaluation includes 
complete blood count, com plete m etabolic panel including 
liver and renal function tests, CH50, C3, C4, C1 inhibitor,
C3a and C5a, total tryptase, histamine, immune complex 
and IgE levels.Added or modified text to

A total of 34 evaluable patients will also provide 80% pow er to 
detect significant change in LS BMD Z- score from baseline 
after 12 months of treatment ( one of key secondary efficacy 
endpoint). With consideration of 15% early discontinuation up

Appendix 5 Protocol Amendmen t 2 Summary of Changes
Previous Version: Protocol Amendment 1 (14 September 2015)
Clinical Protocol SHP -GCB -402 Amendment 2 has been amended to extend evaluation of the 
primary  endpoint from 12 to 24 months and secondary  endpoints from 24 to 12 months, add
specific guidance for contraception, update emergency  contact information, add concomitant 
dosing of 600 IU 25- hydroxy vitatmin D dail y, , and revise age 
range to ≥18 and ≤65 years of age.
NOTE: Changing the IRR definition timeframe from 12 hours to 24 hours was considered in 
order to align with the post -marketing definition; however, the consensus of the clinical trial 
team was to remain consistent with the definition used in the most recent clinical studies.
Changes in grammar, spelling, punctuation, format, minor editorial changes (including changes 
for consistency  and clarity ), and updates to the list of abbreviations and cr oss-references are not 
enumerated in this summary  of changes. The text solely  deleted is presented as strikethrough and

Section 10.2
Determination of 
Sample SizeA total of 34 evaluable patients will provide at l east 80%90% power to detect a significant 
change in LS BMD Z -score from baseline after 12 months of treatment when in fact there is a 
+0.2 +0.6 change (improvement) in Z -score. The calculation w as based on the following 
assumptions:
A total of 34 patients will also provide 80% power to detect significant change in LS 
BMD Z-score from  baseline after 12 months of treatm ent. 
With consideration of 5%15% early discontinuation up to 24 m onths , up to 40 planned 
patients will be enrolled and needed for the primar y efficacy analysis
Section 10.6.1 
Primary Efficacy 
EndpointThe primary efficacy endpoint is the change from baseline to 12 months (Week 51) 24 
months (Week 103 [end of study]) in LS BMD Z -score as measured by DXA. Assessments 
will be performed at baseli ne and Weeks 25, 51, 77, and 103 (end of study). The null 
hypothesis is that there is no change from baseline to 12 months 24months in LS BMD Z -
scores. A statistically significant change in BMD after 1 year 24 m onths of treatment is 
highly clinically relevant in this patient population. One sample t -test or Wilcoxon signed 
rank test will be applied for the change from baseline of LS BMD Z -scores with patients 
whose LS BMD scores are collected after 1 year 24 m onths of treatment. A 95% confidence 
interval f or the mean of the change from baseline will also be presented. 
As a sensitivity analysis, the primary efficacy analysis will be repeated by applying last 
observation carried forw ard (LOCF) method. That is, if the LS BMD score is missing at 12 
months (Week 51) 24months (Week 103 [end of study]), the non -missing score at 6 months 
(Week 25) 12 m onths (Week 51) will be carried forw ard, and the score at baseline will not 
be carried forw ard for the analysis.

Section Summary of Changes
Section 7.15.1 
Definitions of Adverse 
Events Assessment, 
Period of Observation 
and Recording of 
Adverse EventsAll AEs are collected from  the tim e the informed consent is signed until the defined 
follow -up period stated in Section 8.5. This includes events occurring during the 
screening phase of the study, regardless of whether or not investigational product is 
administered. Where possible, a diagnosis rather than a list of sym ptoms should be 
recorded. If a diagnosis has not been m ade, then each symptom  should be listed 
individually. All AEs should be captured on the appropriate AE pages in the CRF 
and in source documents. In addition to untoward AEs, unexpected benefits outside 
the investigational product indication should also be captured on the AE CRF.
All AEs must be followed to closure (the subject’s health has returned to his/her 
baseline status or all variables have returned to norm al), regardless of whether the 
subject is still participating in the study. Closure indicates that an outcom e is 
reached, stabilization achieved (the investigator does not expect any further 
improvement or worsening of the event), or the event is otherwise explained. When 
appropriate, m edical tests and examinations are performed so that resolution of 
event(s) can be docum ented .

Severity 
CategorizationMild no limitation of usual activities
Moderate some limitations of usual activities

:
Mild: A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minim al 
treatm ent or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally 
interfere with usual activi ties of daily living.
Moderate: A type of AE that is usually alleviated with specific therapeutic 
intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or perm anent risk of harm  
to the research subject.
Severe: A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or 
significantly affects clinical status, or m ay require intensive therapeutic 
intervention

Section Summary of Changes
Definitely 
relatedThe event follows a reasonable temporal sequence from 
administration of the investigational product, follows a known or 
suspected response pattern to the investigational product, is 
confirmed by improvement upon stopping the investigational 
product (de challenge), and reappears upon repeated exposure (re
challenge). Note that this is not to be construed as requiring re
exposure of the patient to the investigational product; how ever, the 
determination of definitely related can only be used when recurrence 
of the event is observed.
The following additional guidance m ay be helpful:
Term Relationship Definition
RelatedThe temporal relationship between the event and the 
administration of the investigational product is com pelling 
and/or follows a known or suspected response pattern to 
that product, and the event cannot be explained by the 
subject’s medical condition, other therapies, or accident.
Not RelatedThe event can be readily explained by other factors such as 
the subject’s underlying medical condition, concomitant 
therapy, or accident and no plausible temporal or biologic 
relationship exists between the investigational product and 
the event.
Section 7.15.1.3 
Outcome 
CategorizationThe outcome of AEs must be recorded during the course of the st udy on the CRF. 
Outcom es are as follows:
•Fatal
•Not Recovered/Not Resolved
•Recovered/Resolved
•Recovered/Resolved With Sequelae
•Recovering/Resolving
•Unknown.
Section 7.15.1.4 
Symptoms of the 
Disease Under StudySymptoms of the disease under study should no t be classed as AEs as long as they 
are within the norm al day -to-day fluctuation or expected progression of the disease 
and are part of the efficacy data to be collected in the study; however, significant 
worsening of the symptoms should be recorded as an AE.
Section 7.15.1.5 
Clinical Laboratory 
and Other Safety 
EvaluationsA change in the value of a clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG assessment can 
represent an AE if the change is clinically relevant or if, during treatment with the 
investigational product, a shift of a parameter is observed from a normal value to an 
abnormal value, or a further worsening of an already abnormal value. When evaluating 
such changes, the extent of deviation from the reference range, the duration until return 
to the refe rence range, either while continuing treatment or after the end of treatment 
with the investigational product, and the range of variation of the respective parameter 
within its reference range, must be taken into consideration.

Changes to Update Safety Language
Section Summary of Changes
If, at the end of the treatm ent phase, there are abnormal clinical laboratory, vital sign, or 
ECG values which were not present at the pre -treatment value observed closest to the 
start of study treatment, further investigations should be performed until the values return 
to within th e reference range or until a plausible explanation (e.g., concomitant disease) 
is found for the abnormal values.
The investigator should decide, based on the above criteria and the clinical condition of a 
subject, whether a change in a clinical laboratory, vital sign, or ECG parameter is 
clinically significant and whether it therefore represents an AE.
Section 7.15.1.6 
PregnancyAny report of pregnancy must be reported within 24 hours to the Shire Global 
Pharm acovigilance and Risk Managem ent Department usi ng the Shire 
Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form . A copy of the

applicable follow -up reports) m ust also be sent to the/Shire Medical Monitor using 
the detail s specified in the emergency contact inform ation section of the protocol.
The pregnant female study participant m ust be withdrawn from  the study.
Every effort should be made to gather inform ation regarding the pregnancy 
outcom e and condition of the infant . It is the responsibility of the investigator to 
obtain this information within 30 calendar days after the initial notification and 
approximately 30 calendar days post partum .
Pregnancy com plications such as spontaneous abortion/miscarriage or congenital
abnorm ality are considered SAEs and must be reported using the Shire Clinical 
Study Serious Adverse Event and Non- serious AEs Required by the Protocol Form . 
Note: An elective abortion is not considered an SAE.
In addition to the above, if the investigator determ ines that the pregnancy m eets 
serious criteria, it must be reported as an SAE using the Shire Clinical Study 
Serious Adverse Event and Non -serious AEs Required by the Protocol Form as well 
as the Shire Investigational and Marketed Products Pregnancy Report Form. The 
test date of the first positive serum/urine -hCG test or ultrasound result will 
determine the pregnancy onset date.
Pregnancy and lactation are exclusion criteria for this study. Any report of pregnancy for 
a female study participant or the partner of a male study participant during the course of 
the study and through 30 days after the patient’s last dose of VPRIV must be reported to 
the Sponsor. Pregnancy is not to be reported as an AE; the Investigational and Marketed 
Products Pregnancy Report Form should be used to report the pregnancy. The pregnancy 
will be followed up through delivery or final outcome.

patient after informed consent should be recorded by the clinical site on an SAE form. 
The SAE must be completely described on the patient’s eCRF, including the judgment of 
the investigator as to the relationship of the SAE to the investigational product. The 
investigator will promptly supply all information identified and request ed by  the Sponsor 
(or contract research organization) regarding the SAE.
The investigator must report the SAE to the Shire Pharmacovigilance and Risk 
Management Department AND to the Shire Medical Monitor on an SAE form. This form 
must be completed and FA XED or EMAILED within 24 hours of the investigator’s 
learning of the event to:
All initial and follow -up SAE reports must be reported by the investigator must 
report to the Shire Global Pharm acovigilance and Risk Managem ent Department 
andthe Shire Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event. 
Note: The 24 -hour reporting requirement for SAEs does not apply to reports of 
abuse, misuse, overdose, and or m edication errors according to the SAE reporting 
procedure (see Section 7.15.4.3) un less they result in an SAE.
The investigator must complete, sign, and date the Shire Clinical Study Serious 
Adverse Event and Non -serious AEs Required by the Protocol Form and verify the 
accuracy of the inform ation recorded on the form  with the correspond ing source 
documents (Note: Source documents are not to be sent unless requested) and fax or

e-mail the form to the Shire Global Pharmacovigilance and Risk Managem ent 
Departm ent. A copy of the Shire Clinical Study Serious Adverse Event and Non-
serious AEs Required by the Protocol Form  (and any applicable follow -up reports) 
must also be sent to the Shire Medical Monitor using the details specified in the 
emergency contact inform ation section of the protocol.
Section 7.16.3 Serious 
Adverse Event 
DefinitionAn SAE is any AE occurring at any dose that results in any of the following outcomes:
•Death
•Is life threatening
•Requires hospitalization
•Requires prolongation of existing hospitalization
•A persistent or significant disability or incapacity 
•A congenital ano maly or birth defect
Important medical events that might not result in death, be life threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient and may require medical o r surgical 
intervention to prevent 1 of the outcomes listed in this definition. A life threatening AE 
is defined as an AE that placed the patient, in the view of the initial reporter, at 
immediate risk of death from the AE as it occurred (ie, it does not i nclude an AE that, 
had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death).
Hospitalization, which is the result of elective or previously scheduled surgery for a pre
existing condition that has not w orsened after initiation of treatment, should no t result in 
an SAE designation. For example, an admission for a previously scheduled ventral 
hernia repair w ould not be classified as an SAE; however, complication(s) resulting from 
a hospitalization for an elective or previously scheduled surgery that mee t(s) serious 
criteria must be reported as SAEs. Furthermore, this does not apply to device failures 
resulting in scheduled surgical revisions, which should be reported as SAEs.
A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) is any untoward m edical occurrence (whether 
consi dered to be related to investigational product or not) that at any dose:
•Results in death
•Is life -threatening. Note: The term  ‘life- threatening’ in the definition of 
“serious” refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might 
have caused death if it was more severe.
•Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
Note: Hospitalizations, which are the result of elective or previously 
scheduled surgery for pre- existing conditions, which have not worsened after 
initiation of treatm ent, should not be classified as SAEs. For example, an 
admission for a previously scheduled ventral hernia repair would not be 
classified as an SAE; however, c omplication(s) resulting from  a 
hospitalization for an elective or previously scheduled surgery that m eet(s) 
serious criteria must be reported as SAE(s).
•Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity

•Is a congenital abnorm ality/birth defect
•Isan important medical event. Note: Im portant medical events that m ay not 
result in death, be life -threatening, or require hospitalization m ay be 
considered an SAE when, based upon appropriate m edical judgm ent, they 
may jeopardize the subject and may requir e medical or surgical intervention 
to prevent 1 of the outcom es listed in this definition. Examples of such 
medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive treatm ent 
in an emergency room  or at hom e; blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization; or the developm ent of drug 
dependency or drug abuse.
Section 7.16.4 Serious 
Adverse Event 
Collection Time FrameAny SAE, regardless of relationship to the investigational product, w hich occurs in a 
patient after informed consent should be recorded by the clinical site on an SAE form. 
The SAE must be completely described on the patient’s eCRF, including the judgment of 
the investigator as to the relationship of the SAE to the investigational product. The 
investigat or will promptly supply all information identified and requested by the Sponsor 
(or contract research organization) regarding the SAE.
All SAEs (regardless of relationship to study) are collected from  the time the 
subject signs the informed consent until the defined follow -up period stated in 
Section 8.5 and m ust be reported to the Shire Global Pharm acovigilance and Risk 
Managem ent Department andthe CRO/Shire Medical Monitor within 24 hours of 
the first awareness of the event. 
In addition, any SAE(s) con sidered “related” to the investigational product and 
discovered by the investigator at any interval after the study has completed must be 
reported to the Shire Global Pharm acovigilance and Risk Managem ent Department 
within 24 hours of the first awareness o f the event.
Section 7.16.5 Serious 
Adverse Event Onset 
and Resolution DatesAll SAEs (regardless of relationship to study) are collected from  the time the 
subject signs the informed consent until the defined follow -up period stated in 
Section 8.5 and m ust be reported to the Shire Global Pharm acovigilance and Risk 
Managem ent Department andthe Shire Medical Monitor within 24 hours of the 
first awareness of the event. 
In addition, any SAE(s) considered “related” to the investigational product and 
discovered by the investigator at any interval after the study has completed must be 
reported to the Shire Global Pharm acovigilance and Risk Managem ent Department 
within 24 hours of the first awareness of the event .
Section 7.16.6 Fatal 
OutcomeIn the event of a severe and unexpected, fatal, or life threatening SAE, the clinical site 
must contact the Shire Medical Monitor by telephone; this is in addition to completing 
and transmitting the SAE form as stated above. The follow ing provides contact 
information for the Shire Medical Monitor. 
Any SAE that results in the subject’s death (ie, the SAE was noted as the prim ary 
cause of death) m ust have fatal checked as an outcome with the date of death 
recorded as the resolution date. For all other events ongoing at the tim e of death 
that did not contribute to the subject’s death, the outcome should be considered not

resolved, without a resolution date recorded.
Action taken with the investigational product should be an active decision by the 
investigator. For any SAE that r esults in the subject’s death or any ongoing events 
at the tim e of death, unless another study drug action was previously taken (eg, 
drug interrupted, reduced, withdrawn), the action taken with the investigational 
product should be recorded as “dose not ch anged” or “not applicable” (if the 
subject never received investigational product). The study drug action of 
withdrawn should not be selected solely as a result of the subject’s death. 
Section 7.16.7 
Regulatory Agency, 
Institutional Review 
Board, Ethics 
Committee, and Site 
ReportingThe investigator must promptly report all required information to the IRB/IEC. It is the 
responsibility of the Sponsor to ensure that each investigator receives a copy of any 
CIOMS I/MedWatch report that has been submitted to the appropriate regulatory 
agencies notifying them of an unexpected related SAE. The investigator or Sponsor must 
ensure that the IRB/IEC receives a copy of the report and that a copy is also filed within 
their study files.
The sponsor or sponsor designee is responsible for notifying the relevant regulatory 
authorities /US central IRBs/EU central ECs of related, unexpected SAEs.
In addition the sponsor or the sponsor’s designee is responsible for notifying active 
sites of all related, unexpected SAEs occurri ng during all interventional studies 
across the velaglucerase alfa program .
The investigator is responsible for notifying the local IRB, local EC, or the relevant 
local regulatory authority of all SAEs that occur at his or her site as required.
Section 7 .17Removal 
of Patients from the 
Trial or Investigational 
ProductA patient’s participation in the study may be discontinued at any time at the discretion of 
the investigator. The follow ing m ay be justifiable reasons for the investigator to remove 
a patien t from the study:
•Non-compliance, including failure to appear at 1 or more study visits
•The patient w as erroneously included in the study
•The patient develops an exclusion criterion 
•The patient suffers an intolerable AE
•The patient requests to be disconti nued from the study
•The study is terminated by the Sponsor
•Pregnancy
The patient, the patient’s parent(s), or the patient’s legally authorized representative 
acting on behalf of the patient is free to withdraw consent and discontinue participation 
in the study at any time without prejudice to further treatment.
If a patient, the patient’s parent(s), or the patient’s legally authorized representative(s) 
acting on behalf of the patient, discontinues participation in the study or the patient is 
discontinued b y the investigator, reasonable efforts will be made to follow  the patient 
through the end of study assessments. The reason for refusal w ill be documented on the 
eCRF. Any AEs experienced up to the point of discontinuation must be documented on

protocol followed at the study site for patients with severe 
COVID-19 or complications associated with COVID-19, including off-label use of approved drugs (eg, antibodies against interleukin -6 
[anti-IL-6]/antibodie s against IL -6 receptors [ anti-IL-6R]) or an 
investigational product ( IP) for which administration under an 
emergency use authorization has been granted  (eg, remdesivir ). 
Administration of IP for which expanded access for treatment use 
(“compassionate use”) has been authorized (eg, convalescent plasma) is also permitted  during study participation. 
The study consists of a Screening Period of up to 2 days, and a Treatment Period of up to 28 days. 
Aggregate data from groups of subjects will be reviewed by an 
Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC), both early and at predetermined intervals during the conduct of the study. 
For futility monitoring and sample size re -estimation, an interim 
analysis of unblinded primary endpoint data is planned after 
62 subjects (50% of the target sample size) have completed primary endpoint assessment. 
Primary Objective  The primary objective of the study is to assess the treatment benefit 
of CSL312 after intravenous (IV) infusion in patients with COVID-19. 
Primary Endpoint  The primary endpoint is the incidence of tracheal intubation or death prior to tracheal intubation from randomization to Day 28. 
Secondary 
Objectives  The secondary objectives of the study are: 
• To further assess the efficacy of CSL312 
• To assess the safety of CSL312  
• To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of CSL312

1.1 Background  
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a new coronavirus strain of severe acute 
respiratory syndrome coronavirus- 2 (SARS -CoV-2). According to the World Health 
Organization (WHO), the virus emerged in Wuhan, China [ WHO  Disease Outbreak News, 
2020]. Since the first reports in December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 has spread rapidly with soaring numbers of confirmed cases globally [ WHO  COVID-19 Situation Report 65, 2020]. 
Symptoms elicited by SARS -CoV-2 include fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and fatigue. While 
most patients display a mild form of illness, a subset of infected individuals (~14%) develop 
severe disease, viral pneumonia, leading to hospitalization and the need for oxygen support, 
with approximately 5% of these patients requiring intensive care unit (ICU) admission 
[Novel Coronavirus Pneumonia Emergency Response Epidemiology Team ( NCPERE Team ), 
2020]. In severe cases, COVID -19 may be complicated by acute respiratory distress 
syndrome (ARDS), sepsis and septic shock, multi-organ failure, and even death [ Yang  et al, 
2020]. Risk factors associated with severe disease are age > 65 years and underlying comorbidities, such as obesity, diabetes mellitus, and other chronic disorders. 
Emerging radiological evidence suggests that patients with COVID-19 pneumonia present 
with thoracic computed tomography (CT) imaging abnormalities [ Shi et al, 2020]. The 
predominant pattern reported is ground- glass opacity, with ill-defined margins, air 
bronchograms, smooth or irregular interlobular or septal thickening, and thickening of the adjacent pleura. CT  scan abnormalities appear to evolve from focal unilateral to diffuse 
bilateral ground-glass opacities and may progress to or co-exist with consolidations within 
1 to 3 weeks. Evidence suggests that CT abnormalities are observed even in patients with 
mild symptoms. Overall, the reported imaging characteristics bear resemblance to those 
observed for other coronavirus infections, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and are suggestive of vascular leakage and 
fluid accumulation in the lung tissue.

Version Number: 1.0  
Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 25 of 83 In a study by Huang et al, patients with COVID-19 had CT scan abnormalities that were 
associated with leukocytopenia and lymphopenia [ Huang et  al, 2020 ]. At the time of hospital 
admission, increased prothrombin time (PT) and D-dimer levels have been observed in 
patients that are eventually admitted to the ICU. Preliminary evidence f urther suggests that 
the non-survivors, at the time of admission, had higher levels of D-dimer and fibrin 
degradation product, longer PT, and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) compared with survivors [ Tang  et al, 2020] During their hospital stays, 71.4% of non-survivors and 
0.6% of survivors met the criteria for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Together, these data suggest that severe CO VID-19 is associated with activation of the coagulation 
cascade. While DIC was initially thought to be a consequence of extrinsic activation of the coagulation system, more recent findings suggest that intrinsic activation may also play a 
role. Lastly, analysis of immune mediators in plasma showed increased concentrations of 
interleukin (IL)-2, IL- 7, IL -10, granulocyte colony- stimulating factor (G -CSF), interferon 
gamma -induced protein 10 ( IP-10), monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP -1), 
macrophage inflammatory protein  1-alpha (MIP -1α), and tumor necrosis factor- alpha 
(TNF -α) in ICU patients compared with non- ICU patients [ Huang et  al, 2020].  
Similar to SAR S-CoV , the functional ligand of SARS-CoV-2 is angiotensin-converting 
enzyme- 2 (ACE -2). Binding of SARS- CoV to ACE -2 has been reported to downmodulate 
ACE -2 expression. In addition to its role in the renin–angiotensin system, ACE -2 inactivates 
des-Arg9 brad ykinin (DABK), a potent vasodilative, vascular leakage, and proinflammatory 
mediator. Hence, we postulate that dysregulated ACE -2-dependent inactivation of DABK 
contributes to vascular leakage, fluid accumulation, and excessive tissue inflammation in 
COVID-19. 
Coagulation factor XII (FXII) is the principal initiator of the plasma contact phase system. 
Upon contact with negatively-charged surfaces, FXII is converted to activated coagulation factor  XII (FXIIa), leading to the production of bradykinin (BK) through the kallikrein-kinin 
pathway. Binding of BK to BK receptor type 2 and DABK to BK receptor type 1 activates various intracellular signaling pathways that dilate vessels, induce chemotaxis of neutrophils, and increase vascular permeability and fluid efflux. Further cleavage of FXIIa releases the light chain containing activated beta coagulation factor XII (β FXIIa), which can activate the 
classical complement pathway. Independent of kallikrein -kinin system (KKS) and 
complement activation, FXII induces expression of inflammatory mediators, including IL-8, IL-1β, and IL-6 on human fibroblasts and precision cut lung slices.

Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 26 of 83 FXII activation to FXIIa also initiates the intrinsic coagulation pathway through cleavage and 
subsequent activation of coagulation factor XI. This pathway supports the formation of a stable thrombus but appears to have no critical function for fibrin formation during “normal” 
hemostasis at a site of injury. Specifically, patients with congenital deficiency of FXII do not 
exhibit a bleeding phenotype. Similarly, FXII knockout mice and rats maintain normal hemostasis despite FXII deficiency. Taken together, these findings show that FXII has potent proinflammatory and procoagulant activities. 
To date, no targeted treatment for the COVID- 19 ass ociated pulmonary edema has been 
identified. Multiple potential therapeutic options, including immune modulation and antiviral 
combined with adjuvant therapies are currently under investigation. While the role of FXII in COVID-19 is currently not understood, indirect evidence, such as excessive fluid 
accumulation, DIC, and the observed cytokine storm may implicate this molecule in 
COVID-19. Of note, endothelial cell permeability during Hantavirus infection involved FXII-dependent activation of the KKS, implicating FXII in the pathobiology of viral 
infections [ Taylor  et al, 2013].  
We hypothesize that FXII inhibition attenuates progression of SARS-CoV-2- related 
respiratory disease toward severe pneumonia and ARDS. Specifically, we hypothesize that 
FXII-targeted interventions will attenuate vascular leakage and expression of inflammatory 
mediators through inhibition of KKS-dependent BK generation. We further postulate that 
FXII inhibition will have a beneficial effect on DIC through attenuation of intrinsic coagulation-driven thrombosis. 
According to feedback from treating physicians, in patients with disease progression, the time 
period from symptoms onset to development of dyspnea is reported to be between 
5 to 10 days, and progression to severe leukocytopenic or lymphocytopenic pneumonia with 
or without ARDS occurs within 10 to  14 days. An estimated 15% to  18% of these patients 
will need mechanical ventil ation, despite the use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) support in 
the earliest phases of the disease. The probability of progression to end- stage disease is 
unpredictable, with the majority of these patients dying from multi-organ failure. Preventing disease progression to avoid the need for mechanical ventilation in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia should reduce morbidity and mortality and result in a decrease in the 
use of healthcare resources, ie,  the need for mechanical ventilation and prolonge d ICU stay.

Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 27 of 83 1.2 Information on CSL312  
CSL312 is a fully human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)/lambda, FXIIa antagonist, recombinant 
monoclonal antibody. CSL312 binds to the catalytic domain of FXIIa and potently inhibits 
the intrinsic coagulation cascade and BK production via inhibition of KKS [ Cao et al, 2018]. 
Based on available nonclinical data, CSL312 may offer a novel therapeutic approach to 
prevent disease progression in patients with COVID -19. 
CSL312 is a potent antithrombotic antibody in both mouse and rabbit thrombosis models 
involving FXII activation (without bleeding risk in either thrombosis or bleeding models). 
Pharmacologically, CSL312 treatment is accompanied by an expected increase in aPTT but without any increase in PT [ Larsson  et al, 2014]. CSL312 inhibits BK production in vitro and 
attenuates edema formatio n in vivo in BK- mediated edema models (ACE -inhibitor induced 
edema and acute anaphylaxis mouse models) [ Cao et al, 2018]. CSL312 attenuates 
expression of inflammatory mediators. The parental antibody to CSL312, 3F7, attenuates bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis, renal fibrosis in a unilateral ureteral obstruction model, and 
liver fibrosis in mice. Based on available nonclinical data, CSL312 might offer a novel 
therapeutic approach to prevent disease progression in patients with COVID-19. 
1.3 Study Overview  
Study CSL312_COVID-19 is a prospective, phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo -controlled, parallel-group study to assess the safety and efficacy of CSL312 
administered intravenously in combination with standard- of-care (SOC) treatment in patients 
with COVID-19. The study will consist of a Screening Period of up to 2 days and a 
Treatment Period of up to 28 days. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a 
single intravenous (IV) dose of either CSL312 or placebo in addition to SOC trea tment 
(CSL312 + SOC or placebo + SOC) on Day  1. The primary endpoint for this study is the 
incidence of tracheal intubation or death prior to tracheal intubation from randomization to 
Day 28. A more detailed overview of the study is provided in Section  3. 
1.4 Potential Risks and Benefits  
CSL312 is a fully human monoclonal antibody that inhibits FXIIa activity. CSL312 is currently being developed for routine prophylaxis to prevent angioedema attacks in patients 
with hereditary angioedema  (HAE). In the current study, CSL312 will be administered for the 
first time to subjects with COVID -19 with the aim of preventing disease progression (ie, the 
need for tracheal intubation or death).

Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 28 of 83 CSL312 is currently only administered in the clinical study setting in accordance with the 
clinical study protocol (CSP). The maximum dose and the predicted corresponding maximum plasma concentration (C
max) in this study is e qual  to the highest administered dose and its 
corresponding C max observed in the phase 1 study (CSL312_1001). Each subject who 
participated in Study CSL312_1001 received a single dose of CSL312; each subject who participates in the current study will recei ve a single dose of either CSL312 in addition to 
SOC treatment (CSL312  + SOC) or placebo in addition to SOC treatment (placebo + SOC).  
Benefits  
The benefits of CSL312, when provided in addition to SOC treatment, in patients with COVID-19 are unknown. Potential benefits are based on the mechanism of action of CSL312, ie, inhibition of FXIIa. The potential benefit is the prevention of disease progression 
in patients with COVID -19. Subjects randomly assigned to the placebo + SOC group, which 
is included for scientific rigor, are not expected to receive any additional benefits from 
placebo beyond the expected response to SOC treatment.  
Risks  
The following risks were not observed in the phase 1 study (CSL312_1001) but are potential risks based on the drug class and mechanism of action of CSL312: 
• Severe Hypersensitivity/Anaphylactic -type Reactions:  Administration of 
therapeutic proteins including monoclonal antibodies such as CSL312 is associated 
with the risk of hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions, some of which can be 
serious and life-threatening. Appropriate precautions will be taken when CSL312 is 
administered at the study site, with constant monitoring for potential anaphylactic reactions. The administration of CSL312 will be performed under medical supervision 
with immediate access to emergency equipment and medication for the treatment of 
severe hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis. 
• Exacerbation of Cytokine Release Syndrome:  Cytokine release syndrome is a 
symptom complex caused by the rapid release of pro-inflammatory cytokines from 
target immune cells which can be life -threatening [ Stebbings  et al, 2007; Stebbings  
et al, 2013]. Patients with severe COVID -19 are known to have an evolving cytokine 
release syndrome at the time of ICU admission. The administration of CSL312 will be 
performed under constant medical supervision and cytokine levels will be tested 
before and after dosing.

Version Number: 1.0  
Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 29 of 83 • Bleeding and Thromboembolic Events:  By blocking FXIIa with CSL312, there may 
be a potential risk of bleeding or thromboembolic events (TEEs) due to altered 
hemostasis, unstable clot formation, or impaired clot breakdown. In addition, because of the pharmacological action of CSL312, a prolongation of aPTT is expected to be 
observed in a concentration-dependent manner. Clinical experience with CSL312 in 
healthy volunteers in the phase  1 study (CSL312_1001) and patients with HAE in the 
ongoing phase 2 study (CSL312_2001) did not show an effect on PT. This is 
consistent with the observation that patients who have congenital deficiency of FXII 
do not exhibit a bleeding phenotype, despite having a prolonged aPTT [ Lammle  et al, 
1991; Ratnoff  and Colopy, 1955]. In addition, nonclinical studies in mice and rabbits 
showed no impairment in hemostasis after inhibition of FXIIa [ Larsson  et al, 2014]. 
Currently, there is also no human experience with the administration of CSL312 in combination with other anticoagulant drugs. Coagulation parameters will be monitored throughout the study and subjects will be monitored carefully for any signs of bleeding or thrombosis. 
• Immunogenicity (Anti -drug Antibodies) : All protein  therapeutics are potentially 
immunogenic. Because CSL312 is a protein, it has the potential to cause the development of neutralizing and non- neutralizing anti -drug antibodies (ADAs). 
Subjects will be monitored for the development of immunogenicity throughout the study. 
Given the potential benefit of CSL312 in patients with COVID- 19, the favorable safety data 
from the phase 1 study (CSL312_1001) and the ongoing phase 2 study (CSL312_2001), and the implementation of procedures in the current study to closely monitor subject safety, the 
associated benefit -risk assessment is considered acceptable. Additional information on 
CSL312 can be found in the CSL312 Investigator’s Brochure.

5.1 Allocation to Treatment  
5.1.1 Subject Assignment  
After informed consent has been obtained, subjects will be assigned a study-level unique 
subject identification number, via an IRT system, which will be used to identify the subject for the duration of the study. Subject identification numbers will not be reassigned or reused. 
5.1.2 Randomization Procedures  
Randomization will be conducted using an IRT. The investigator will be supplied with a user guide for the IRT. Subjects will be randomly assigned to treatment with either CSL312 + SOC or placebo + SOC using a 1:1 randomization ratio and stratified by country 
(USA or Brazil). 
A centralized randomization schedule will  be used. The randomization list will be generated 
according to the approved randomization specifications. The IRT service provider will keep 
the randomization code on file. 
5.1.3 Blinding Procedures  
5.1.3.1  Blinding Method  
Investigational site staff, including the inve stigators, will be blinded to treatment allocation. 
Subjects and CSL staff (or delegates) participating in the conduct of the study will also be blinded to treatment allocation (double-blind). 
Unblinded study site personnel delegated by the investigator wi ll prepare the IP, as assigned 
by the IRT. Unblinded study site personnel are not to administer the IP and will not be 
involved in conducting or recording any study assessment procedures (ie, in the care of the 
subject). Study site staff who will be conducting safety assessments, including the investigator, and subjects will be blinded to treatment allocation, the contents of the syringe and to kit number assignment (double-blind). Sponsor staff will also be blinded to treatment 
allocation, the contents of the syringe and kit number assignment, except as stated below.

sites. Designated unblinded personnel agree not to disclose the contents of the randomization list, the contents of the kit list or any subject kit number assignment. The safety- related data 
provided to the IDMC during the course of the study will be unblinded. All individuals will be placed under strict confidentiality to protect the integrity of the study. 
All blood samples analyzed by the central laboratory will remain blinded until database lock. 
Blood samples analyzed by the local laboratory will be interpreted by personnel appointed by the investigator and defined in the site-specific blinding plan. 
Study unblinding will take place following the locking of the database except in situations as 
outlined in Sections  5.1.3.2, 5.1.3.3, and 5.1.3.4. 
Adequate procedures are in place to ensure the integrity of the blinded data within CSL. 
Study data will be provided to the IDMC as unblinded data, as requested. 
5.1.3.2  Breaking the Blind for an Emergency  
The randomization code for individual subjects may be unblinded to a site during the study in emergency situations for reasons of subject safety, if knowing treatment assignment will change subject management. In case of an emergency situation for the reason of subject 
safety, the investigator should use the IRT to identify the treatment allocation for a subject. 
Whenever possible, the investigator should consult with CSL before unblinding the randomization code. The reason for unblinding the randomization code must be fully recorded in the subject’s source documents, and the investigator must follow the defined 
procedures provided i n the study reference manuals. The subject’s treatment allocation 
should not be recorded in the subject’s source document. 
5.1.3.3  Planned Unblinding Procedures  
Periodic unblinding safety reviews are planned for this study for the purposes of safety monitoring activities by the IDMC. With authorization by CSL, the IRT will provide the 
unblinded statistician performing analysis for the IDMC or the unblinded statistician with the randomization code or an IRT user account access to obtain the required information dire ctly 
from the IRT.

Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 41 of 83 An unblinded interim futility and sample size re -estimation analysis will also be performed 
by an IDMC. With authorization by CSL, the IRT will provide the unblinded statistician 
performing the analysis for the IDMC with the randomizatio n code or an IRT user account 
access to obtain the required information directly from the IRT. 
At the end of the study, CSL will authorize that the study be unblinded after database lock. 
The randomization codes will be provided to the study statistician ( or delegate).  
5.1.3.4  Ad-hoc Safety Unblinding  
CSL Global Clinical Safety Pharmacovigilance personnel may, on an ad-hoc basis, unblind 
the randomization code directly in the IRT at any time during the study because of a safety concern. The purpose of the unblinded data review is to determine whether there is a risk to 
subject safety that would require further action either for the individual management of a 
study subject or for the ongoing conduct of the study. The need to unblind a subject or group of subjects may  not necessarily arise because of an SAE. The need to unblind on an ad- hoc 
basis will be determined by CSL’s Global Clinical Safety and Pharmacovigilance senior 
leadership.  
6 Study Population and Main Criteria for Eligibility  
6.1 Eligibility Criteria  
The study population will be selected on the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria described in the sections below. Subject eligibility should be reviewed and documented by an 
appropriately medically qualified member of the investigator’s study team before subjects are included in the study. Eligibility may be assessed at the time of hospital admission provided that the subject is randomized within 24  hours. 
6.2 Inclusion Criteria

Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 45 of 83 6.4.3 Subject Withdrawal  
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time either at their own request or at the 
discretion of the investigator or CSL for safety, behavioral, or administrative reasons 
(eg, because of an AE, protocol deviation, subject noncompliance, or study termination). The 
investigator should record in the electronic case report form (eCRF) and in the subject's 
medical records the reason for and date of subject withdrawal.  
In accordance with the ICH principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP), the investigator 
always has the option to advise a subject to withdraw from the study if the subject's safety or 
well-being is compromised by his or her further participation in the study. Concern for the 
interests of the subject must always prevail over the interests of the study. 
6.4.4 Procedures for Handling Withdrawals  
If a subject is withdrawn from the study, attempts will be made to complete and document the Day 28 (EOS) Visit assessments. If the subject is withdrawn from the study after receiving IP, 
every effort will be made to ensure that the relevant safety assessments are completed. The 
subject may also be asked by the investigator to complete other study assessments.  
If the subject withdraws from the study, and also withdraws consent for disclosure of future 
information, CSL may retain and continue to use any data collected before such withdrawal of consent. 
6.4.5 Replacement Policy 
Subjects withdrawn from the study will not be replaced. 
7 Study Assessments  
7.1 Unscheduled Study Assessments and Additional Medical Data  
Unscheduled study assessments are possible and can be documented in the unscheduled visit in the eCRF.  
Additional data given to CSL may include any medical information from hospital records 
required by the study but not outlined in the study protocol. This information may be required 
to help scientific understanding of study data and might be collected even the completion of 
the study.

8.2 Study Halting Criteria  
The study will be halted (no recruitment or further dosing), pending review, if any of the 
following criteria are met: 
• One subject develops an SAE that results in death and is considered by the investigator and/or CSL to be related to the administration of CSL312 
• One subject develops any other serious event that is deemed to pose an unacceptable risk to other subjects in the study, and this event is considered by the investigator and/or CSL to be related to the administration of CSL312 
• An overall pattern of symptomatic, clinical, or laboratory events that the medical monitor, CSL or IDMC consider associated with CSL312 and that may appear minor 
in terms of individual events but that collectively may represent a serious potential concern for safety  
• Three subjects with severe toxicity for the same parameter associated with study 
product

required to resume the study (including the addition of new risk mitigation measures), 
then a substantial protocol amendment will be submitted  
• Regulatory authorities and Institutional Review Boards (IRBs)/Independent Ethics 
Committees (IECs) will be informed of a study halt and then its resumption  
If safety concerns warrant a PERMANENT  stop to the study: 
• The SMT will conduct a risk assessment  
• The SMT and Global Safety Committee are i nvolved in recommending a stop, if it is 
has concluded that continued dosing poses an unacceptable risk to subjects and no 
further risk mitigation steps can be applied 
• CSL’s Global Benefit Risk Committee will ratify the decision to stop the study  
• In case d ecision to stop study is not ratified, GBRC could recommend study 
continuation with implementation of additional risk -benefit measures (including 
addition of new risk mitigation measures); substantial protocol amendment will be submitted if modifications a re required to continue the study 
Regulatory authorities and IRBs/IECs will be notified in the case of a study stop. 
8.3 Treatment Compliance  
All doses of IP will be administered by IV infusion at the study site. Treatment compliance 
will be assessed using the administration details entered into the eCRF. A subject will be 
regarded as compliant with regard to IP administration if the subject received between ≥ 80% and ≤ 120% of the planned dose of IP.

9.1 Prohibited Therapies  
Because of the severity of the COVID -19 pneumonia pandemic, it is difficult to define in 
advance any contraindications to concomitant treatments (including antiviral drugs). Any 
medication that the subject is receiving at the time of study enrollment or that the subject receives during study participation will be recorded in the subject’s eCRF along with the 
dates of administration (start date and end date), dosing information (dose and frequency), 
and reason for use. 
The use of any IP or investigational device according to a clinical study protocol for another 
clinical study is PROHIBITED during this  study and within ≤ 30 days before Screening or 
within 5  half-lives of the final dose of IP administered during the previous interventional 
study, whichever is longer. However, use of an IP with emergency use authorization is 
permitted (see Section  9.2). 
Use of the following mediations is also PROH IBITED during this study: 
• any therapeutic antibody other than CSL312 
• anticoagulant therapy except low- molecular -weight heparin (LMWH) 
9.2 Permitted Medications/Therapies  
The following medications and therapies are PERMITTED at any time during the study: 
• Prescribed medications required for the management of acute or chronic medical 
conditions including COVID-19, except those described in Section  9.1. 
• Treatment considered SOC for COVID -19, defined as any written or established 
treatment protocol followed at the study site for the treatment of patients with severe 
COVID-19 or complications associated with COVID -19, including off-label use of 
approved drugs (eg, anti- IL-6/anti- IL-6R), an IP for which administration under an 
emergency use authorization has been granted  (eg, remdesivir) . Administration of IP 
for which expanded access for treatment use (“compassionate use”) has been authorized (eg, convalescent plasma) is also permitted during study participation. 
• Therapies to treat any AEs that the subject experiences during the study, including 
non-prophylactic aspirin (eg, to treat a headache) . 
• LMWH

Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 53 of 83 9.3 Lifestyle Restrictions  
Female subjects of childbearing potential and fertile male subjects must use a medically 
reliable form of contraception  until 90 days after the last administration of study drug. 
Childbearing potential is assumed in all female  subjects except:  
• Female subjects ages > 45  years with amenorrhea for ≥ 12 months without an 
alternative medical cause.  
• Female subjects who are surgically sterile for ≥ 3 months before providing informed 
consent. 
Acceptable methods of contraception are: 
• Abstinence, where abstinence is the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject, 
including refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the entire period of risk 
associated with the IP. Periodic abstinence (calendar, symptothermal, and 
post-ovulation methods), withdrawal (coitus interruptus), spermicides only, and 
lactational amenorrhea method are not acceptable definitions of abstinence.  
• Hormonal methods associated with inhibition of ovulation, if used at a stable dose 
during the 3 months before Screening with no plans to change dose during the study. 
Acceptable hormonal methods include: oral contraceptives, contraceptive medication 
patch, contraceptive medication injection, estrogen/progestin vaginal ring, or 
contraceptive medication implant.  
• Use of intr auterine device (placed > 3 months before providing informed consent). 
• Surgical sterilization (>  3 months before providing informed consent) of subject or 
subject's partner. 
9.4 Overdose  
Overdose is defined as the infusion or ingestion of any dose (single or cumulative) of a product that is considered excessive. In this study, excessive is defined as any dose greater than the planned dose. The effects of any potential overdose with CSL312 have not been 
studied. In case of overdose, the subject should be closely monitored, and supportive 
treatment should be administered, as needed.

Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 54 of 83 10 Adverse Events  
10.1 Definitions 
10.1.1  Adverse Event  
As per ICH  E2A (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for Expedited 
Reporting), an AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal 
relationship with this treatment. An AE can, therefore, be any unfavorable and unintended 
sign (including an abnormal, clinically significant laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal (investigational) product. 
The period of observation for AEs extends from the time that informed consent is obtained 
until the EOS  Visit (see Section  10.4 for further details).  
Adverse events may include: 
• Exacerbation (ie,  an increase in the frequency or severity) of a pre -existing condition. 
Illness present before study entry should be recorded in the medical history section of 
the eCRF and only be reported as an AE if there is an increase in the frequency or 
severity of the condition during the study. 
• A clinical event occurring after consent but before IP administration. 
• Intercurrent illnesses with an onset after administration of IP. 
Adverse events do not include: 
• Events identified at Screening that meet exclusion criteria.  
• Medical or surgical procedures (the condition that leads to the procedure is the AE). 
• Situations where an untoward medical occurrence has not taken place. For example:  
o Planned hospitalizations due to pre-existing conditions, which have not worsened. 
o Hospitalizations that occur for procedures not due to an AE (eg, cosmetic 
surgery). 
o Hospitalizations for a diagnostic procedure where the hospital stay is less than 24 hours in duration or for normal management procedures (eg, chemotherapy).

Version Number: 1.0  
Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 55 of 83 • Overdose of IP or any concomitant therapy that does not result in any adverse signs or 
symptoms. 
For laboratory safety parameters, any instanc es of absolute values being outside the reference 
range or changes at any visit after study start that are considered by the investigator as clinically significant must recorded in the eCRF as AEs. In addition, at the investigator’s 
discretion, any changes or trends over time in laboratory parameters can be recorded in the eCRF as AEs if such changes or trends are considered to be clinically relevant, even if the 
absolute values are within the reference range.  
Laboratory findings do not need to be reported as AEs in the following cases: 
• Increases in aPTT will not be classified as AEs because CSL312 is expected to cause increase in these parameters.  
• Laboratory parameters already beyond the reference range at Screening, unless a further increase/decrease can be considered an exacerbation of a pre -existing 
condition.  
• Abnormal laboratory parameters caused by mechanical or physical influences on the blood sample (eg, in  vitro hemolysis) and flagged as such by the laboratory in the 
laboratory report. 
• Abnormal parameters that are obviously biologically implausible (eg, values that are incompatible with life or outside the measuring range). 
• An abnormal laboratory value that cannot be confirmed after repeat analysis, preferably in the same laboratory (ie, the previous result could be marked as not valid 
and should not necessarily be reported as an AE). 
10.1.2  Serious Adverse Event  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose:  
• Results in death – The event must be the cause of death for the SAE to meet this 
serious criterion. 
• Is life -threatening  – The term “life -threatening” refers to an event in which the 
subject was at risk of death at the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that 
hypothetically might have caused death if it had been more severe.

Version Number: 1.0  
Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 56 of 83 • Requires in -patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  – 
CSL considers “hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization” for 
≥ 24 hours as the defining criterion for an SAE. Hospital admissions for planned surgery or for normal disease management procedures (eg,  chemotherapy) are not 
considered as defining criteria for SAEs. 
• Results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity . 
• Is a congenital an omaly or birth defect.  
• Is medically significant  – A medically significant event is defined as an event that 
does not necessarily meet any of the SAE criteria, but which is judged by a physician 
to potentially jeopardize the subject or require medical or surgical intervention to 
prevent one of the above outcomes listed as an SAE criterion. 
Adverse events that do not fall into the above categories are defined as nonserious AEs. 
10.1.3  Adverse Event of Special Interest  
There are several AEs that will be monitored closely as AESIs to enable an adequate risk-benefit evaluation of CSL312 during the study and additional data may be requested for 
these events. The AESIs will be:  
• Bleeding events that are abnormal in the opinion of the investigator 
• TEEs  
o Non-systemic thrombosis (eg, localized thrombosis associated with vascular 
access) is not considered an AESI  
• Severe hypersensitivity including anaphylaxis 
The reporting requirements for AESIs are detailed in Section  10.6.1.

Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 57 of 83 10.2 Severity of Adverse Events  
The severity of each AE (ie,  nonserious and serious AEs) is to be assessed by the investigator 
as follows: 
Severity  Definition  
Mild  A type of AE that is usually transient and may require only minimal 
treatment or therapeutic intervention. The event does not generally interfere with usual activities of daily living.  
Moderate  A type of AE that is usually alleviated with additional specific therapeutic intervention. The event interferes with usual activities of daily living, 
causing discomfort but poses no significant or permanent risk of harm to the subject.  
Severe  A type of AE that interrupts usual activities of daily living, or significantly 
affects clini cal status, or may require intensive therapeutic intervention.  
Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM) Severity 
Intensity Scale for Adverse Event Terminology.  
10.3 Causality of Adverse Events  
The causal relationship of an AE to IP must always be assessed  by the investigator. All AEs 
will be classified as either related  or not related  to IP. If a causality assessment is not 
provided for an AE (including an SAE), that AE will be considered related to the IP. 
The degree of certainty with which an AE is attributed to the IP or an alternative cause 
(eg, natural history of the underlying disease, concomitant therapy) will be determined by 
how well the event can be understood in terms of: 
• Known pharmacology of the IP. 
• Clinically and/or pathophysiologically plausible context. 
• Reaction of a similar nature previously observed with similar products, or reported in the literature for similar products as being product related (eg, headache, facial flushing, pallor).  
• Plausibility supported by the temporal relationship (eg, the event being related by time to administration or termination of treatment with the IP, drug withdrawal or 
reproduced on rechallenge).

Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 58 of 83 10.4 Observation Period for Adverse Events  
The observation period for the reporting of AEs (and SAEs) for an individual subject will 
start at the time that informed consent is obtained for participation in the current study and 
end at the subject’s final site visit.  
If the investigator becomes aware of an SAE that has started after the EOS  Visit and is 
considered by the investigator causally related to the IP, the event must be reported to CSL 
following the same timelines and procedures described for SAEs occurring during the study 
(see Section  10.6.1).  
Such events are not entered into the eCRF. 
10.5 Follow -up of Adverse Events  
Every effort should be made to follow AEs until resolution or stabilization. Ongoing, 
nonserious AEs that have not resolved or stabilized will be followed until the subject completes the study. SAEs will be followed until the AE resolves, stabilizes, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
10.6 Adverse Event Reporting  
10.6.1  Adverse Events  
At each clinical evaluation, the investigator (or delegate) will determine whether any AEs have occurred. All AEs are to be recorded in the eCRF. If known, the medical diagnosis of an 
AE should be recorded in preference to the listing of individual signs and sym ptoms. The 
investigator must follow up on the course of an AE until resolution or stabilization. If an SAE 
is ongoing after the final study visit, the SAE will continue to be followed up until resolution, 
stabilization, or the subject is lost to follow -up. 
If, during study participation, a subject presents with a pre-existing condition that was not 
noted at the time of study entry, the condition should be retrospectively recorded in the Medical History eCRF.  
10.6.2  Serious Adverse Events  
This study will comply with all applicable regulatory requirements and adhere to the full requirements of ICH  E2A (Clinical Safety Data Management: Definitions and Standards for 
Expedited Reporting). Foreign cross reporting will be ensured.

information in the eCRF. 
All SAEs that occur during the course of the study, whether or not causally related to 
the IP, must be entered into the eCRF immediately (within 24  hours of the investigator 
becoming  aware of the event). An assessment of causality to the IP must be included.  
AEs occurring in the period between the time that informed consent is obtained and the time 
of the first exposure to the IP that meets 1 or more of the seriousness criteria must be entered 
into the eCRF in the same manner as other SAEs and will be included in the clinical study 
database.  
Any SAE that occurs after the final study visit and is considered by the investigator as causally related to the IP must be reported following the same timelines and reporting 
procedures described for SAEs occurring during the study. Such events are not entered into 
the eCRF.  
The minimum reporting requirements for reporting of SAEs include: 
• Subject identification number 
• Suspected medicinal product and/or procedure 
• Event term  
• Reporting source identification 
If the minimum requirements for reporting are fulfilled, the investigator should not wait to receive additional information to fully document the event. 
In addition, the investigator must: 
• Report all SAEs to the relevant IRB/IEC within the timeframe specified by the IRB/IEC.  
• If the subject is an active participant in the study: 
o Enter follow-up information in the eCRF until the SAE has resolved, or, in the 
case of permanent impairment, until stabilized.  
o Ensure that the causality assessment for all SAEs is entered in the eCRF  
• If the subject is no longer participating in the study, report the follow-up information to 
CSL.

any additional information as it becomes available (eg, autopsy reports and detailed medical reports).  
10.6.3  Adverse Events of Special Interest  
AESIs must be reported as AEs in the subject’s eCRF. Additional data might be requested in the eCRF for these events. Serious and nonserious AESIs must be reported following expedited reporting procedures, as described for SAEs (see Section  10.6.2 ). 
10.6.4  Other Significant Events  
Not applicable.  
10.6.5  Overdose  
Any overdose that occurs in association with an adverse sign or symptom must be entered into the eCRF as an AE; if the AE meets any seriousness criteria, the event must be reported as an SAE (see Section  10.6.2).  
Details (ie,  volume infused, location of infusion, infusion start and stop times, and infusion 
rate) of overdose of IP (defined in Section  9.4) must be recorded in the Study Treatment 
Adminis tration eCRF. Details of an overdose of any concomitant therapy must be recorded in 
the Concomitant Medication eCRF. 
10.6.6  Pregnancy and Breastfeeding  
A female subject or female partner of a male subject who becomes pregnant while participating in the study, or up to and including 90 days after the last dose of IP, must notify the investigator immediately.  
If a female subject becomes pregnant during study participation, she may continue study procedures at the discretion of the investigator. If the subject withdraws from study participation, the procedure for discontinuation of a subject will be followed, as described in Section  6.4.3).  
CSL must be notified within 5 days of the investigator becoming aware of the pregnancy.

the status of the mother and child after delivery, should be reported by the investigator to 
CSL using a Pregnancy Reporting/Outcome Form. 
10.7 Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics Committee Reporting 
Requirements  
The time frame within which an IRB/IEC must be notified of deaths and IP- related 
unexpected SAEs is stipulated by each IRB/IEC. It is the investigator’s responsibility to comply with the requirements for IRB/IEC notification. CSL will provide investigators with 
all details of all SAEs reported to regulatory authorities.  
11 Statistical Analyses  
11.1 Sample Size  
There are limited data on the rates of subjects with COVID -19 who progress to tracheal 
intubation or death prior to tracheal intubation within 28 days. For sample size calculation, a 
rate of 30% in the control group and a rate of 10% in the CSL312 group have been assumed. With a 2 -sided α = 0.05 and 1:1 randomization ratio for CSL312 + SOC ve rsus 
placebo  + SOC, a total of 124 subjects need to be randomized (62 subjects to CSL312 + SOC 
and 62 subjects to placebo  + SOC) in order to achieve 80% power to detect a treatment 
difference using a 2  group chi- square test.  For the sample size calculation , it is further 
confirmed using simulations performed in East
® 6.5 software (Cytel, Inc.: Waltham, MA) 
that 80% power is maintained, accounting for the interim analysis for futilit y and sample size 
re-estimation.

The primary endpoint for this study is the incidence of tracheal intubation or death prior to 
tracheal intubation from randomization to Day 28. The proportion will be calculated as the 
number of subjects with tracheal intubation or death divided by the total number of subjects 
for each  treatment group. Treatment effect of interest (ie,  estimand) is defined as the 
proportion difference of tracheal intubation or death prior to tracheal intubation (CSL312 + SOC minus placebo  + SOC) in the target population regardless of whether 
additional treatment is used or initial SOC has changed. The ITT Analysis Set will be used for the primary efficacy analyses.  
Firth logistic regression model including treatment group; age group as a continuous 
covariate; gender (male or female); country (US A or Brazil ); and Baseline comorbidities (yes 
or no) as categorical covariates will be used to compare the rates between the 2  treatment 
groups. Comorbidities include hypertension, diabetes, and obesity (defined as body mass 
index ≥ 30 [kg/m
2]). A 2 -sided p- value will be estimated from the model. The proportion 
difference and associated 95%  confidence interval (CI) will be estimated using the method 
described by Ge at  al [2011 ]. The mITT Analysis Set will be used for primary efficacy 
endpoint sensitivity analysis. 
Sensitivity analyses to assess the effect of missing data will be conducted, for example, by 
performing tipping point analyses that vary assumptions about the missing outcomes in both 
study treatment groups. 
11.4 Analyses of Secondary Efficacy  
The following secondary efficacy endpoints will be summarized by treatment group using 
subject count and percentage: 
• All-cause mortality  
• Incidence of tracheal intubation from randomization to Day 28

the above secondary efficacy endpoints between the 2 treatment groups. The proportion 
differences, associated 95%  CIs, and 2-sided p-values will be reported. 
Clinical Status Assessed on an 8 -Point NIAID Ordinal Scale  
Frequency and proportion of subjects within each category o f the 8 -point NIAID ordinal 
scale will be summarized along with graphical displays for each treatment group. Frequency 
and proportion of subjects with an improvement from Baseline of ≥ 2 points will be analyzed 
using descriptive statistics.  
Hospital Length  of Stay  
Hospital LOS is defined as the time interval from randomization to hospital discharge alive. 
In this analysis, for subjects who did not have hospital discharge (ie, no recorded date of hospital discharge) and did not die, the time to hospital discharge will be censored at the last known in-hospital date if the subject did not complete the 28-day Treatment Period. For 
subjects who do not have a hospital discharge event or censoring time within the 28 days 
after randomization or for subjects who have died, an administrative censoring will be applied at 28 days. 
Hospital LOS will be analyzed using Cox model including treatment group; age as a 
continuous covariate ; gender (male or female) , country (US A or Brazil ); and comorbidities 
(yes or no) as categorical covariates in the model. Hazard ratio, its 95% CI and 2- sided Wald 
p-value for hypothesis- testing will be estimated from the model. Cumulative event rates will 
be calculated using the Kaplan -Meier (KM) method. The effect over time will be illustrated 
with a plot of the complement (1  – KM) of KM estimates. Event counts and percentages will 
be summarized. If ties occur, Efron’s method will be used to adjust for ties.

Maximum SOFA score, maximum change from Baseline in SOFA score, and mean SOFA 
score during the study will be calculated for each subject and summarized by treatment 
group. Descriptive statistics for continuous variables will be reported. Median differences 
between treatment groups and 95% CIs using Hodges-Lehmann’s method will be reported. 
Nonparametric Wilcoxon rank- sum test will be used to compare the 2  treatment groups. 
SOFA score components will also be summarized by treatment and visit using descriptive 
statistics.  
The ITT Analysis Set and  mITT Analysis Set will be used for the secondary efficacy endpoint 
analyses.  
Baseline is defined as the most recent, non-missing value before randomization, if applicable, otherwise, the most recent non-missing value before administration of IP.  
11.5 Analysis of Safety  
Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version  21.1 (or higher). A treatment- emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined 
as an AE reported at or after the start of the first administration of stu dy treatment. Only 
TEAEs will be summarized.  
An overview summary of TEAEs, including counts and percentages of subjects with any TEAE; TEAEs related to study treatment; TEAEs leading to permanent discontinuation of 
study treatment; TEAE leading to dose modifications; serious TEAEs; serious TEAEs related to study treatment; fatal TEAEs; fatal TEAEs related to study treatment, TEAEs by severity, and TEAEs of special interest will be produced. 
TEAEs will be summarized by system organ class and preferred term. TEAEs will also be 
summarized by causality and severity. All TEAE summaries will be provided for each 
treatment and overall.  
Number and percentage of subjects with plasma anti-CSL312 antibodies will be summarized 
by treatment group and overall. 
Laboratory evaluations (hematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis) will be summarized 
descriptively by treatment group.

Version Number: 1.0  
Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 70 of 83 12.4 Subject Confidentiality  
All subject names and contact details will be kept confidential. Subjects will be identified 
throughout documentation and evaluation by the subject number assigned to them during the 
study. Each subject will be told that all study findings will be handled in the strictest 
confidence. 
The investigator at the study site will be responsible for retaining sufficient information about 
each subject (eg,  name, address, phone number, and identity in the study) so that regulatory 
agencies or CSL may access this information should the need arise. These records should be retained in a confidential manner as long as legally mandated according to local requirements.  
Subject medical records pertainin g to the study may be inspected/audited at any time by CSL 
employees or their duly authorized representatives, a health authority or the IRB/IEC. All records accessed will be strictly confidential. Consent to participate in the study includes consent to these inspections/audits  
12.5 Indemnity and Compensation  
CSL has taken out insurance to cover its obligations under both the Indemnity and the Compensation guidelines for injury to subjects involved in the study. 
Other details regarding compensation and the obligations of the investigator/CSL are 
provided in the Clinical Trial Research Agreement (CTRA) for the study ( Section  13.1).  
13 Administrative Considerations 
13.1 Clinical Trial Research Agreement  
This study will be conducted under a CTRA between CSL (“Sponsor”) and the institutions 
representing the investigational study sites (“Authority”). Financial support to the investigational sites will be detailed in the CTRA. The CTRA will clearly delineate the responsibilities and obligations of the investigators and CSL, and will form the contractual 
basis under which the clinical study will be conducted. The CTRA may be executed by 
electronic signature (current provider DocuSign) in compliance with 21 Code of Federal 
Regulations Part 11 and simple or advanced electronic signature according to European Union Regulation No. 910/2014 – eIDAS.

Version Number: 1.0  
Effective Date: Week commencing 30 -Apr-2018   Page 71 of 83 13.2 Clinical Study Registration and Results Disclosure  
CSL will provide the relevant CSP information in public databases before or at 
commencement of the study. CSL may also provide study information for inclusion in 
national registries according to local regulatory requirements. 
Results of this study will be disc losed according to the relevant regulatory requirements. All 
publications in peer- reviewed medical journals resulting from this study will be listed in the 
original CSP registration record. 
13.3 Implementation of the Clinical Study Protocol and Amendments  
With the exception of medical emergencies, no changes or deviations in the conduct of the 
signed CSP will be permitted without documented approval of the CSL Medical Monitor or 
designee and the IRB/IEC. In the event of a medical emergency, the investigator at the study 
site will institute any medical procedures deemed appropriate. However, all such procedures must be promptly reported to the CSL Medical Monitor and the IRB/IEC. 
Modifications to the CSP that may affect subject safety or the way the study is to be 
conducted will be documented in a protocol amendment, which must be approved by the 
IRB/IEC.  
Administrative changes to the CSP, defined as minor corrections and/or clarifications that have no effect on the way that the study is to be conducted, will not r equire IRB/IEC 
approval, but will be submitted to the IRB/IEC for their information.  
13.4 Protocol Deviations 
All instances where the requirements of the CSP were not complied with will be tracked. Corresponding subjects may be withdrawn from the study at the discretion of the investigator 
and/or CSL. CSP deviations arise when either subjects who have been entered in the study 
and/or the study sites deviate from the IRB/IEC-approved study protocol. 
If a major protocol deviation (ie, a deviation that could have a significant effect on the 
subject’s safety, rights, or welfare and/or on the integrity of the study data) occurs, the 
investigator must notify CSL and the appropriate IRB/IEC as soon as possible or as per local requirements.

13.5.1  Data Collection  
The investigator (or delegate) will maintain individual records for each subject. These records 
should include dates when a subject visited the study site, records of vital signs, medical 
history, or physical examinations, administration of IP or concomitant therapy, any AEs experienced, and other notes as appropriate. These records (electronic or paper) constitute 
source data.  
An eCRF will be provided by CSL (or delegate) for each subject enrolled into the study. The 
investigator is resp onsible for ensuring accurate and proper completion of the eCRF in a 
timely manner so that it always reflects the latest observations on the subjects enrolled in the 
study. All entries on the eCRF must be backed up by source data unless the eCRF is 
conside red source data. All source data will be kept according to all applicable regulatory 
requirements. Source data must be completed legibly for each subject enrolled into the study and signed by the investigator (or delegate). 
13.5.2  Data Quality Assurance  
Data generated throughout the study will be monitored and the eCRFs checked against the subject records for completeness and accuracy. The investigator must provide direct access to source data documents. CSL’s study monitor will perform this function. 
Following completion of eCRF pages and entry of the data into a database, the data will be 
checked electronically and manually for consistency and plausibility. Queries will be generated for questionable data and clarification sought from the investigator. These data queries must be resolved in a timely manner by the investigator (or delegate). 
13.5.3  Monitoring  
The monitoring activities during the current COVID-19 pandemic will be primarily or exclusively be performed without peripheral visits. Remote monitoring will be perf ormed 
through periodic, comprehensive connections through the internet or telephone with all participating study sites by CSL personnel or representatives.

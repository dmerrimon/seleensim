1.0 Research  Introduction  
1.1 Purpose/Specific  Aims  
Severe challenging behaviors such as aggression and self -injury can cause significant morbidity and 
decrease  the quality  of life for individuals  with  Autism  Spectrum  Disorders  (ASD).  The prevalence  of these 
symptoms varies according to patient samples however one study has placed it as high as 68% (Kanne & 
Mazurek,  2011).  The mainstay  of medical  treatment  for significant  aggression  in individuals  with  ASD are 
antipsychotics.  However,  as many  as 40%  of individuals  can be resistant  to any pharmacological  treatment 
(Adler  et al., 2015).  Inadequate  treatment  necessitates  the use of physical  force,  take  down  and four -point 
restraint  making  the improved  treatment  for this group  acute  (Van  Schalkwyk  et al., 2015).  Without  proper 
treatment, individuals face severe injuries (retinal detachments, tooth loss, concussions, infections, 
hospitalizations), and potentially jeopardize school placements, vocational training and/or residential 
placements.  
 
There are only two medications (Risperdal and Abilify) rigorously studied and FDA -approved for the 
treatment of irritability in individuals with ASD. These medications are not always successful and have 
many short and long -term side effects making their use problematic even in cases where the behavioral 
outcome is successful (Orsolini et al., 2016). Well -designed studies demonstrating efficacy and safety of 
alternative medication treatment choices for this population are needed.  
 
There is preliminary evidence that high dose propranolol can be effective in individuals with ASD who 
display severe aggression and have not responded to antipsychotics or mood stabilizers. Concerns 
regarding the safety of high dose propranolol have limited its clinical application. Well -designed clinical 
trials  demonstrating  the efficacy  and safety  of high  dose  propranolol  will have  significant  effects  on clinical 
practice and improve the physical and behavioral quality of life for an underserved subset of individuals 
with ASD.  
 
Our current proposal will pilot the safety and efficacy of high dose propranolol. We will randomly assign 
participants  to either  propranolol  or to placebo  later  crossing  each  participant  over  to the other  group.  As 
propranolol  can cause  changes  in blood  pressure  and heart  function,  each  participant  will complete  initial 
comprehensive testing to monitor cardiac safety throughout the study. We will be utilizing telemedicine 
and computer based telemetry to minimize the burden of office visits on the individual and family.  
 
A. Objectives  
Aim #1 : To demonstrate the feasibility of treating and evaluating severely behaviorally impaired 
participants  with  aggression,  self-injury,  and disruptive  behaviors  who  are diagnosed  with  ASD,  using  high 
dose propranolol to obtain blinded randomized placebo controlled data.  
 
Aim #2: To document  the cardiac  effects  of various  dosing  levels  of propranolol  through  careful  follow  up 
of blood  pressure/heart  rate (BP/HR)  and repeated  Holter  monitoring  to ensure  the safety  of using  these 
doses.

Aim #3 : To evaluate and analyze the sensitivity and specificity of the secondary dependent measures of 
challenging behaviors in order to develop novel and innovative data collection methods of studying this 
population.  These  novel  methods  will be used  to develop  more  rigorous  and adequately  powered  studies 
in the future.  
 
B. Hypotheses  / Research  Question(s)  
 
Hypothesis #1 - High dose propranolol will show evidence of being effective in treating the symptoms of 
aggression, self -injurious behaviors and disruptive behaviors, defined as greater than a 25% reduction in 
the Aberrant  Behavior  Checklist —Community  (ABC -C) Irritability  subscale  and a rating  of much  improved 
or very much improved on the Clinical Global Impressions -I scale.  
 
Based on the literature and the results of our preliminary data, we anticipate that propranolol will be an 
effective treatment for these challenging behaviors. It would be optimal to do this as part of a formal 
clinical trial powered to give statistical significance; however, this would be possible in this application 
only if the effect size is very large. At this point, a pilot grant to obtain needed data is scientifically more 
appropriate.  Our pilot  will address  the preliminary  questions  and gather  the data  needed  to design  a larger 
and costlier clinical trial. Some of the preliminary information needed includes: 1) whether there is an 
optimal target dose of propranolol, 2) the extent of the improvement of challenging behavior which can 
inform  us as to how  to power  a larger  study,  and 3) reliability  and validity  of rating  instruments  which  are 
targeted  to the symptoms  we are focused  on in this study  (i.e. a more  sensitive  measure  of improvement).  
 
This study is designed to address important questions about propranolol at the level of the individual 
participant.  We will be able  to review  clinical  information  on the effects  of propranolol  in adolescents  and 
adults with ASD and challenging behaviors. We will be able to monitor our ability to recruit and retain 
such  participants  as well  as our ability  to obtain  the cardiac  clearance  and safety  cardiac  monitoring.  We 
will be able  to review  the tolerability  of our stepwise  increase  in the study  medication  as well  as document 
the changes  in behavioral  function  in the study  participants.  The purpose  of the crossover  design  is to use 
each participant as a control, which is important in ensuring that behavioral changes are not due to 
placebo effect.  
 
Hypothesis #2 - We hypothesize based on our preliminary data that the propranolol will not necessitate 
discontinuation of the medication in nearly all cases.  
 
On high doses of propranolol (daily dose of 240 mg or more), there will be a decrease in heart rate and 
blood  pressure; however,  we will carefully  monitor  all changes  with  a set of acceptable  cutoffs  as well as 
through clinical evaluation by the cardiologist. We will utilize cutoff scores for pulse and blood pressure 
(BP < 90/50  and HR < 50 or clinical  symptoms  of significant  dizziness  or fainting  or near  fainting)  with  these 
findings  necessitating  discontinuation  of treatment.  Holter  monitor  exam  showing  any clinically  significant 
changes will also be grounds for discontinuation at the discretion of the cardiologist.

Propranolol has been used on a worldwide basis for over 50 years. It has proven to be a very safe 
medication  with  side effects  well known.  One proviso,  however,  is that there  is a lack of safety  data  in the 
literature with the use of high doses. Based on our pilot study including about 30 Holter monitor exams, 
we did not observe problems with high doses as there were no changes other than the expected drop in 
pulse and blood pressure. For this research project, we include diligent monitoring of the cardiac status 
of our participants which includes not only a comprehensive baseline cardiac assessment (cardiac 
clearance) but also repeated heart rate and blood pressure monitoring to be obtained remotely and 
available  to the research  team  through  telemetry.  We anticipate  a drop  in blood  pressure  and pulse  with 
increase in study drug dosage and we will include these parameters in determining the rate of titration 
and therefore do not anticipate that participants will drop out due to clinical concerns. We do not 
anticipate there will be significant cardiac changes as the dose increases as it is likely that peripheral 
receptors  will be saturated  and the higher  doses  will have  mostly  an enhanced  behavioral  effect.  This will 
be documented with our safety monitoring and Holter monitor.  
 
We will utilize  Holter  monitoring  to ensure  participant  cardiac  safety  (Aim  #2). This type  of monitoring  will 
also allow  us to capture  data  on heart  rate variability  (HRV),  which  has been  used  as a proxy  for autonomic 
functioning.  Although  our study  is not designed  to answer  questions  of the mechanism  by which  the effect 
of propranolol might be working, one possible hypothesis is that its mechanism is through blocking of 
sympathetic  neural  activity.  We will be able  to examine  the HRV  measure  prior  to the introduction  of the 
treatment medication and then at various doses. We will examine whether the baseline HRV predicts 
improvement on propranolol. If so, HRV could be an inclusion criterion for future studies.  
 
1.2 Research  Significance  
 
The ASDs are a heterogeneous group of disorders with multiple etiologies and pathophysiologies and 
myriad  of behavioral  symptom  presentations  (London,  2014;  Waterhouse  & Gillberg,  2014).  It is very  likely 
that to be effective, treatment regimens will have to account for this heterogeneity. A unitary treatment 
for ASD is unlikely. Rather, the optimal management of ASD and especially the severe symptoms often 
associated are thought to be multimodal, including both behavioral and pharmacologic intervention 
(McDougle, Stigler, & Posey, 2003) and must be specific to the symptoms found in each individual.  
 
Although  the “core  signs”  of ASD comprise  social  deficits  and rigid  repetitive  behaviors,  many  individuals 
with ASD have comorbid behavioral symptoms including tantrums, aggression, self -injury, hyperactivity, 
anxiety,  rapid  changes  in mood  and others  (Lecavalier,  2006).  These  symptoms,  especially  the most  severe 
among them (aggression, self -injurious behaviors and disruptive behaviors), are a common chief 
complaint of parents and educators and at times far outweigh the core signs as problems (Carroll et al., 
2014; Lecavalier, Leone, & Wiltz, 2006; Matson & Jang, 2014). The prevalence of these symptoms in ASD 
cases  varies  according  to the patient  samples  studied  however  one report  places  it as high  as 68%  (Carroll 
et al., 2014; Kanne & Mazurek, 2011). Presently, the treatments for these symptoms continue to yield 
only partial benefit for many. Two antipsychotic medications, Risperidone and Aripiprazole, are the only

two medications  which  are FDA-approved  for the treatment  of ASD,  more  specifically,  for the “irritability 
(tantrums, aggression and self -injury) associated with autism”. While very successful for some, their 
efficacy is far from optimal with one study showing 40% of the sample being resistant to any 
pharmacotherapy (Adler et al., 2015).  
 
Further, these medications are associated with many adverse effects making their long -term use 
problematic in many cases (Orsolini et al., 2016). Antipsychotics, used to treat various pediatric CNS 
disorders  are associated  with  three  times  the risk of diabetes  with  these  effects  observed  within  one year 
of follow -up (Bobo et al., 2013). Pediatric patients also gain a significant amount of weight, notably, as 
much  as 7% increase  in weight  in 12 weeks  under  antipsychotic  treatment  (Correll  et al., 2009).  The need 
for improved  treatment  of these  symptoms  is acute.  Often  inadequate  treatments  necessitate  the use of 
physical interventions, takedowns and four -point restraint (Van Schalkwyk et al., 2015) and can disrupt 
typical family life for the parents and siblings of these individuals.  
 
Behavioral treatments for aggression and self -injurious behaviors have been successfully employed for 
many  years.  Perhaps  the main  limitations  of using  behavioral  methods  are those  caused  by an inadequate 
number  of practitioners  with  the knowledge  and ability  to implement  these  strategies  (Van  Schalkwyk  et 
al., 2015)  as well as the cost associated  with  intensive  treatment.  Even  if the service  delivery  systems  are 
optimal  however,  there  are limitations  that come  along  with  using  behavioral  methods  alone.  Behavioral 
methods are based on cause -effect relationships and the treatment is accomplished by altering the 
environmental component of the relationship (Iwata & Dozier, 2008). However, 25% of individuals with 
self-injurious behaviors are found on functional behavior analysis to have “automatic reinforcement.” In 
other words, the problem behavior was not displayed in response to any demonstrable environmental 
condition (Hagopian, Rooker, & Zarcone, 2015). Rather, automatically reinforced, sensory -maintained 
behaviors are thought to be self -reinforcing, and therefore internal biologic functions are likely to be 
driving  the behavior.  Because  a problem  behavior  may  also serve  multiple  functions,  the behavior  may  be 
facilitated,  at least  in part,  by the biological  underpinnings  of that individual.  This conclusion  would  imply 
that combination of treatments would be synergistic, and therefore, superior.  
 
Broader, public health issues also need to be considered. There are high levels of psychiatric 
hospitalization in this population, with 10.8% of children with ASD having had a hospitalization, most 
commonly  for self-injurious  behaviors  or aggression  (Mandell,  2008).  Medicaid  expenditures  are ten times 
higher  for those  diagnosed  with  ASD compared  to other  children,  with  the difference  largely  attributable 
to inpatient psychiatric care (Mandell, Cao, Ittenbach, & Pinto -Martin, 2006). As the children age, the 
expenditure for these behavioral symptoms increases and there is a concomitant decrease in the 
expenditure for other services which are more consistent with medical home aspirations and life skills 
(Cidav,  Lawer,  Marcus,  & Mandell,  2013;  Mandell  et al., 2006).  Therefore,  large  amounts  of the resources 
devoted  to ASD go to the management  of those  with  these  severe  symptoms  at the expense  of other  less 
emergent but necessary goals.

In the literature, well designed studies for the serious challenging behaviors associated with ASD are 
scarce.  There  has been  however,  many  anecdotal  or small  case  series  reports  which  show  some  promise. 
One of these  strategies  involves  the beta -adrenergic  blocking  agent  propranolol.  The literature  on the use 
of propranolol  for these  symptoms  (in a variety  of psychiatric  disorders),  suffers  from  various  limitations. 
Most  of the literature  is made  up of case  studies  although  there  have  been  six small  double -blind  and/or 
placebo  controlled  studies  (Ruedrich  & Erhardt,  1999)  involving  patients  with  these  symptoms.  Although 
treating aggression, self -injurious and destructive behaviors is common to all six studies, they involved 
many different psychiatric diagnoses,  including intermittent explosive  disorder (with  and without known 
brain damage), conduct disorders, attention deficit disorder, schizophrenia, atypical psychosis, 
schizoaffective disorder, drug abuse, seizure disorder, borderline personality disorder, various types of 
intellectual disabilities with various etiologic origins and dementia (Jenkins & Maruta, 1987; Silver et al., 
1999; Ward, Tharian, Roy, Deb, & Unwin, 2013). Some studies used mixed diagnostic populations. The 
studies  were  done  on a wide range  of ages  from  children  to geriatric cases  and over  a wide  range  of IQ’s.  
 
Specifically,  for ASD,  in 1987  a case  series  of 8 adults  with  violent  or self-injurious  behaviors  was reported 
(Ratey et al., 1987). The authors described a “remarkable” effect on previously intractable aggressive 
behavior which was consistent with similar findings in the studies involving individuals diagnosed with 
schizophrenia, brain damage and severe mental retardation. In a recent review of the effect of beta 
adrenergic  blockers  on behaviors  of people  with  developmental  disability,  it was reported  that many  had 
positive  outcomes  and supported  the efficacy  for this indication,  despite  the overall  quality  of the research 
being poor with no randomized controlled studies have been performed (Ward et al., 2013). In a review 
of studies on brain injured patients with aggression (Fleminger, Greenwood, & Oliver, 2006), it was 
concluded that beta blockers have the best evidence for efficacy of all medications while these authors 
also highlighted the lack of quality studies.  
 
Despite the urgent need for treatment for these debilitating symptoms, and the anecdotal success 
propranolol has had for aggression treatment across a range of diagnoses, it appears that it is not 
commonly  used  for ASD treatment.  In the UK, adrenergic  blocking  agents  are rarely  prescribed,  with  only 
2% of patients with ASD receiving any type of beta blockers (Murray et al., 2014). In a study of 
pharmacologic  treatments  in Germany,  no beta  blockers  were  listed  in the most  common  25 medications 
prescribed for ASD (Bachmann, Manthey, Kamp -Becker, Glaeske, & Hoffmann, 2013). In systematic 
reviews  of treatments for ASD propranolol is  either not mentioned or is briefly mentioned in the context 
of there  being  no high -quality  studies  to demonstrate  its efficacy  (Baribeau  & Anagnostou,  2014;  Siegel  & 
Beaulieu, 2012).  
 
1.3 Research  Design  and Methods  
This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled crossover study.  Participants will include 
individuals  with  ASD between  the ages  12-30. Based  on the gender  distribution  of ASD in the population, 
we expect that our group will be approximately 75% male. Participants will be recruited from the local 
New Jersey community, including schools, work programs, and parent support groups.

a) Randomized : the researchers will not decide which group the participant will be 
assigned.  The assignment  to group  A (propranolol  first)  or group  B (placebo  first)  will be 
determined by chance and recorded by the research pharmacist.  
b) Double -blind : the researchers,  the study  staff,  and even  the participant  and his/her  family 
will not know what kind of treatment is provided first or what phase they are in during 
the study.  They  will be unblinded  at the end of the study,  as well as during  the open -label 
study.  
c) Placebo -controlled : an identical -looking inactive drug (“sugar pill”) will be compared to 
propranolol  to account  for variables  such  as improvements  related  to simply  knowing  that 
one is receiving a treatment, attention from researchers, and the expectations of drug’s 
effectiveness by the research team and the caregivers.  
d) Cross -over : the participant’s initial assignment to a particular group (A or B) will be 
switched to the other treatment phase (A → B or B → A) after a washout period. That is, 
each participant will receive a sequence of both propranolol and placebo. In crossover 
design, the influence of confounding covariates is reduced because each participant 
serves as his or her own control.

1.3 A. STUDY  PROCEDURES  
1.3 A1 PRE-ENROLLMENT  
 
• An independent  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  will be established  to ensure  the 
safety  of research  participants  and the integrity  of the study  data.  The DSMB  will meet  prior 
to the enrollment  of the first participant  to review  the research  protocol,  informed  consent, 
and plans for safety and data monitoring of the study. This review is to determine the risks 
and benefits  to research  participants,  protection  and safety  of the participants,  and to offer 
suggestions for improving the study ( see SAFETY section for further details).  
• Participant  Screening  and Consent  and Diagnostic  Confirmation - 
• Upon referral, the study staff will contact the referring person by telephone to get 
preliminary information as to whether the individual meets inclusion criteria. We 
expect  about  25%  of those  screened  to be candidates  for a propranolol  trial.  Therefore, 
we may  need  to screen  80 referrals  in two years  to find 24 eligible  subjects.  If the initial 
screening  telephone  call is successful,  an appointment  will be made  for an initial  visit in 
the Children’s Health Institute.  
• At the initial study visit, the research Coordinator/ PI will describe the study in detail 
with the family (see consent procedures) Informed consent will be obtained by the 
Research  Coordinator.  Confidentiality  will be protected  by assigning  a study  ID with  (no 
identifying information) for each participant and all information obtained on each 
participant will be referenced through their study ID.  
• Diagnostic  confirmation  of an ASD diagnosis.  
 
• Cardiac  Clearance : 
An appointment will be made for a complete cardiac exam by the pediatric cardiology team 
in the Clinical Academic Building at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. This will include a 
full cardiac physical exam including history review, vital signs, auscultation, and circulatory 
assessment. A baseline EKG will be completed (and reviewed by a cardiologist) to detect 
arrhythmias  or heart  block  that might  be an exclusion  for participation  in the study.  A limited 
echocardiogram  will be completed  to assess  cardiac  functioning.  The participant  will be fitted 
with  a portable  24-hour  Holter  monitor.  At least  6 hour  of continuous  recording  is needed  for 
analysis. The results will be transmitted to the cardiology department and reviewed by the

cardiologist.  After  review  of all these  tests,  a cardiologist  will notify  the PI regarding  eligibility 
into the study. If our cardiac exam uncovers an unknown cardiac problem, the PI will discuss 
the findings with the subject’s family and Primary Care Physician to ensure the subject 
receives referral for further treatment. A cardiologist will discuss with the family and PCP if 
additional  testing/clinical  follow -up is needed.  The family  and PCP may  decide  to follow -up at 
RWJ  cardiology  or may  choose  another  provider.  The participant  will however,  not be enrolled 
in the enrollment  study  arm without  clearance  from  cardiology.  (Before  the appointment  with 
cardiology  all female  participants  will take  a urine  pregnancy  test.  A negative  urine  pregnancy 
test will allow further participation.)  
 
……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………  
1.3 A2 ENROLLMENT  
Baseline  Behavior  
• Once  the prescreening is  complete and  subject remains  eligible, the subject will be enrolled 
in the active  study.  The study  coordinator  will meet  with  the family  to train  them  on the use 
of the home  blood  pressure  and heart  rate monitoring.  The family  will receive  a smart  tablet 
to record behavioral questionnaires and medical data. This tablet will collect data through 
HIPAA -compliant web application. The study coordinator will train the family to use the 
study tablet and the internet, as necessary.  
 
• The blood pressure readings will be collected by the family and electronically transmitted to 
the study  staff.  The family  will not be blind  to the measurement  outcome.  These  data  will be 
monitored by the study coordinator.  
 
A 2-week baseline period will begin once admitted to the active study. During the 
Baseline  period,  demographic  data  will be obtained  using  the Vineland -3 to assess  the adaptive 
behaviors and IQ (if not available from the previous three years, we will administer the Leiter 
International Performance Scale, Third Edition (Leiter -3). 
……………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………………  
Randomization  and Medication  Dispense  
The Rutgers Research Pharmacy will supply active study drug and placebo at the first treatment 
visit.  Prior  to dispensing  the study  drug,  the participant  will be randomly  assigned  to propranolol 
(Phase A) or placebo (Phase B). *All participants will remain on their pre -study medication 
throughout all phases of the study.

a) The standard  dosing  of propranolol  will be 10 mg tid (3 times  per day),  40 mg tid, 80 
mg tid, 120 mg tid, 160 mg tid and 200 mg tid (PHASE A) or matching placebo 
(PHASE B).  
b) All patients will begin at dose one (10 mg tid or 30 mg per day of 
propranolol/placebo).  The family will obtain HR/BP readings  on the first 3 days  (1 
hour  after  evening  dose)  after  beginning  study  drug  and for the first three  days  of 
each  dose  increase.  The HR/BP  readings  will be transmitted  to the RA/PI  to review 
as per safety guidelines (see below).  
c) Each week the family will complete behavioral data online through RedCap (Side 
Effects Survey, Aberrant Behavior Checklist --Community (ABC -C), IBR Modified 
Overt  Aggression  Scale  (MOAS).  The informant  who  completes  these  forms  should 
remain the same throughout the study. Each family will be emailed a link which 
opens to a behavioral form with subject ID and no identifiers. Once the form is 
completed by the family member, it is automatically uploaded to the RedCap 
database.  
d) The study  psychiatrist  will utilize  two-way teleconferencing  (i.e.,  Skype -like HIPAA - 
approved  platform)  to conduct  study  visits  with  the participant  and his/her  family.  
e) There  will be weekly  follow  up with  the study  psychiatrist,  participant  and family  to 
review  the behavior  of the participant.  The study  psychiatrist  will complete  CGI and 
review the Side Effects survey, the ABC,  and IBR MOAS and titrate up in stepwise 
fashion based on weekly follow up visits with the study psychiatrist  
f)  The dose will be titrated up in stepwise fashion (based on the weekly follow up 
visits) until adequate therapeutic response is obtained (as decided by the 
subject’s/subject’s  parents  and study  psychiatrist)  or up to a maximum  dose  of 600 
mg per day (note: propranolol is FDA -approved up to a dose of 640 mg).  
g) The dose can be raised as frequently as once per week. The titration schedule 
however will be flexible and the dose can be held steady for an extended period 
primarily  if it is deemed  that additional  observation  is needed  prior  to increasing  the 
dose.  
h) Scheduled dose increases could be delayed due to mild adverse effects (i.e. some 
nausea, tiredness or difficulty adjusting to medication or parent preference) or due 
to marked  improvement  at a lower  dose.  Dose  reduction  to manage  side effects  are 
allowed at any time.  
i) Maintenance  dose  (or optimal  dose)  - If the dose  is held  steady  for 6-8 weeks,  due to 
optimal behavioral outcome, that will be considered the maintenance dose for the 
study.

a) After completing  the crossover  study,  all participants  will be invited  to participate  in 
an open  label  study  on propranolol.  
b) The “double blind” will be broken and the psychiatrist with the parent or guardian 
will evaluate whether there was benefit on active medication and which dose was 
optimal.  
c) Participants will be offered the opportunity to again be titrated to the optimal dose 
for two months.  
All participants,  whether  or not they  complete  the double  blind  portion  of the study,  will 
be eligible  for the open  label  study.  We anticipate  that  participants  may  be more  likely  
to drop out of the double blind during placebo portion of the study (due to delays in 
treatment with the study drug and continued behavioral difficulties) or during the 
crossover  phase  when  on study  drug  (due  to decrease  in optimal  dose  of study  drug  and 
increase in behavioral difficulties).

Once  enrolled,  the weekly  study  visits  will occur  via teleconferencing.  The study  psychiatrist  will 
utilize telemedicine (i.e., HIPAA -approved platform) to conduct study visits with the participant 
and his/her  family.  This will circumvent  some  of the difficulties  in having  aggressive  participants 
with developmental disabilities attend outpatient clinics, which tend to exacerbate their 
symptoms.  
 
1.3 B What  data  points  will be collected  including  long -term  follow -up? 
Following the pre -enrollment phase, all behavioral data (i.e., questionnaires) will be completed 
online through RedCap. Each participant will be emailed a link which opens to a behavioral form 
with subject ID and no identifiers. Once the form is completed by the family member, it is 
automatically  uploaded  to the RedCap  database.  The family  will be provided  with  training  on how 
to complete the questionnaires and to collect vitals prior to beginning data collection. These 
include:  
 
● Side  Effects  Survey  
● Aberrant  Behavior  Checklist --Community  (ABC -C) 
● IBR Modified  Overt  Aggression  Scale  (MOAS)  
 
Data  will be collected  at predetermined  points  (see  above  chart).  No long -term  follow -up is planned 
beyond the open -label trial.  
 
1.3 C Define  the duration  of the study  and the length  of time  each  subject  will participate  in the study . 
 
The study  will be 5-7 months  long.  Each  participant’s  duration  of participation  will vary  depending  on 
his/her  response  to the medication.  That  is, based  on the participant’s  clinical  presentation,  the blind 
investigator may shorten or lengthen the duration of a particular dosage.  
1.3  D. Describe  any primary  and secondary  study  or safety  endpoints 
Primary Endpoint  
The primary  efficacy  parameter  will be the change  from  baseline  to endpoint  of the double -blind 
phase. The end -point is the last post -baseline assessment of the double -blind phase.  
 
The efficacy  will be measured  by the ABC-Irritability  Subscale,  which  is rated  by the parent  or 
primary caregiver.

1.4 Preliminary  Data  
 
Our group has obtained a retrospective case series with n=46 patients (38 males, 8 females), which is 
currently  under  editorial  review  (London,  Fethke,  Zimmerman -Bier,  & Yoo).  The mean  age of the patients 
was 16 years  (range  = 8 to 32 years).  The mean  propranolol  dose  was 462 mg per day (range  = 120 mg to 
960 mg). The mean dosage for males was 481 mg (range = 120 - 960 mg) and for females was 372 mg 
(range = 120 - 640 mg). Twenty -five of the 46 patients engaged in self -injurious behaviors while the 
remaining patients engaged in various aggressive behaviors. The time on propranolol ranged from 0.1 
year  (one  patient  who  deteriorated  on propranolol  also discontinued  their  antipsychotic  at the same  time) 
to 10 years on propranolol with the average duration on propranolol being 2.6 years. The mean number 
of medications previously and or currently being tried was 6.2 and the number of previous medication 
trials varied from 1 - 17 different medications.  
 
Our results show that 39 (85%) of 46 patients were much improved or very much improved (CGI -I = 1 or 
2) based  on their  aggressive  symptoms,  self-injurious  behaviors  or severely  disruptive  behaviors.  Two  out 
of 46 patients were slightly improved (CGI -I = 3). Five (11%) of 46 cases were not improved or worsened 
(CGI -I = 4 or greater). Although not quantified, there was little to no benefit treating other symptoms 
present, such as hyperactivity, repetitive behaviors, attention, and mood.  
 
Only two patients (4.2%) needed to be discontinued due to side effects (both bronchial constriction).  30 
patients  on high  dose  propranolol  had cardiology  workup  and other  than  some  bradycardia  and reduction 
in pulse (not clinically significant) there were no adverse effect on Holter monitor or echocardiogram.  
 
1.5 Sample  Size Justification  
 
McNemar's test will be used to compare the percentage of participants achieving treatment response 
on propranolol  as opposed  to placebo.  The preliminary  pilot  data  (London  et al., under  review)  showed 
an 85% response to propranolol. Assuming a 20% placebo response and a conservative estimate of a

75% propranolol response, we require 17 participants  to detect a difference of (75 -20) percent. To 
account  for an anticipated  drop -out rate of 15%,  24 participants  will be recruited . Given  the gender  rate 
of 4:1 male to female prevalence of ASD, we expect more male participants (18 males: six females).  
 
1.6 Study  Variables  
A. Independent  Variables,  Interventions,  or Predictor  Variables  
Describe  any treatments  or interventions  to be compared  for their  effects  on participants.  
 
Propranolol  
We are using  a beta  blocker,  propranolol,  as an independent  variable  to investigate  its effects  on people 
with ASD who present with chronic challenging behaviors. Propranolol has been used worldwide for 
over 50 years (Black, Crowther, Shanks, Smith, & Dornhorst, 1964). It has been listed by the World 
Health  Organization  as one of the ten most  important  medications.  Safety  concerns  are well  known  and 
are quite manageable. Its primary indication is for heart problems (high blood pressure) but has also 
been used to:  
 
● control  heart  rhythm  in atrial  fibrillation  
● relieve  angina  (i.e.,  chest  pain)  
● prevent  migraines  
● reduce  shaking  or essential  tremor  
● help  with  medical  conditions  involving  your  thyroid  and adrenal  glands  
● support  heart  function  after  a heart  attack  
 
There  is evidence  that at higher  doses,  propranolol  inhibits  rage  and anger  through  effects  on the central 
nervous system. This effect has been demonstrated in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders including 
head  trauma,  schizophrenia,  ASD,  and other  developmental  disabilities.  In addition,  propranolol  does  not 
cause  the significant  weight  gain  or other  side effects  associated  with  the use of antipsychotic  medications 
(viz. risperidone). Our preliminary experience has shown that 85% of a group of extremely aggressive 
adolescents and adults with ASD have “much improved” or” very much improved” when treated with 
propranolol.  
 
Concomitant  Medication  and/or  Behavior  Intervention  
Throughout the study the participants will remain on their pre -existing medications due to the severe 
nature of the problem behaviors and the ethical dilemma of the possibility of worsening symptoms by 
withdrawing medications for the sake of the study. The participants will be encouraged to continue all 
other treatments and educational (behavioral) programs they are on prior to the study throughout the 
study  duration.  However,  any significant  change  in their  other  treatments  such  as a change  in medication, 
or the institution of a new behavioral program which is significantly different from the program which 
they  were  on at the beginning  of the study  will necessitate  the participant  being  dropped  from  the study.

Describe  the regimen  (drugs,  doses  and schedule  by which  the treatment  will be given),  and drug 
administration guidelines  
 
A. Medication  Dispense,  Randomization,  and Medication  Dispense  
At the first treatment  visit,  the participant  will be randomly  assigned  to propranolol  first or placebo  first 
(Phase  A or Phase  B) based  on a computer -generated  randomization  schedule  prepared  by the research 
pharmacist. The medication will then be supplied by the Rutgers Research Pharmacy. The pharmacists 
alone will supply active medicine and placebo with all other study personnel blinded.  
 
The randomization will be balanced by using randomly permuted blocks. Based on this randomization 
code, the study drug will be packaged and labeled for each participant. Medication numbers will be 
preprinted  on the study  drug  labels  and assigned  as participants  qualify  for the study  and are assigned  to 
treatment.  
 
Study drug labels  have peel -off panels  printed with corresponding medication  numbers  to be removed 
and attached to the participant’s case report form (CRF) or drug accountability logs when the drug is 
dispensed. The core part of the label remains affixed to the study drug container and will have all 
identifying  information  except  for the dose  of the drug.  The study  drugs  will be identical  in appearance 
and will be packaged in identical containers. To maintain the blind, sealed envelopes containing the 
study  drug  identification  (i.e.,  propranolol  or placebo)  will be provided  to the investigator.  These  sealed 
envelopes will be kept together, in a limited access area that is accessible 24 hours per day. The same 
information will be kept in a shared restricted folder for the PI and Pediatric cardiologist to access in 
case of emergency.  
 
The study  drug  and placebo  will be supplied  in a liquid  form  and will be matched  for color  and taste.  The 
subject will receive prefilled syringes packaged in daily supply. The standard dosing will be 10 mg tid (3 
times per day), 40 mg tid, 80 mg tid, 120 mg tid, 160 mg tid and 200 mg tid (PHASE A) or matching 
placebo (PHASE B). All patients will begin at dose one (10 mg tid or 30 mg per day) (For subjects unable 
to take liquid, the pharmacy will prepare capsule formulations with matching placebo).

The Research Assistant will be responsible for ensuring delivery of study drug to the subject. The first 
dose will be given to the subject’s family during the Baseline phase. The research doctor (psychiatrist) 
will be responsible  for determining  the study  drug  dose  each  week.  The Research  Pharmacy  will prepare 
the study drug and the Research Assistant package the study drug for express delivery or courier/ or 
supply to family after study visit.  
 
The dose changes will be stepwise and flexible to allow for subject tolerability. The dose will be titrated 
until adequate therapeutic response is obtained (as decided by the parents and psychiatrist) or up to a 
dose  of 600 mg per day (note:  propranolol  is FDA-approved  up to a dose  of 640mg).  If there  is suboptimal 
response  (based  on the judgment  of the psychiatrist  and the parent  or caregivers),  the dose  can be raised 
as frequently as once per week. The titration schedule however will be flexible and the dose can be held 
steady for an extended period primarily if it is deemed that additional observation is needed prior to 
increasing the dose. The downward titration schedule can be slower, depending on clinical factors 
(although this was not needed in our preliminary study --London et al., under review).  
 
Scheduled  dose  increases  could  be delayed  because  mild  adverse  effects  (i.e. some  nausea,  tiredness  or 
difficulty adjusting to medication or parent preference) or because of marked improvement at a lower 
dose.  
Dose  reduction  to manage  side effects  are allowed  at any time.  
 
In addition,  we will monitor  side effects  Medication  will be held  for participants  with  HR < 90/50  and HR 
< 50 awake  in asymptomatic  subjects.  Families  will be instructed  to ensure  patient  is adequately  hydrated 
and to hold medication during fever and GI illness with vomiting or diarrhea.  
 
B. Drug/Device  Accountability  And  Storage  Methods  
The Research pharmacist at RWJ Medical School Pharmacy/Investigational Drug Service will properly 
store  and dispense  all investigational  drugs  (active  and placebo)  and maintain  accurate  dispensing  and 
inventory records. Propranolol does not require a special temperature control.  This includes keeping 
records of:  
1. Receipt  and inventory  of investigational  drugs  
2. Storage  of investigational  drugs  
3. Dispensing  of investigational  drugs  and 
4. Return  or disposal  of the investigational  drugs.  
The Research pharmacist at RWJ Medical School Pharmacy/Investigational Drug Service will be 
responsible  for preparation,  dispensing  and disposal  of the study  drug.  The Research  Coordinator  will be 
responsible  for collection  of all unused  study  medication  from  families  and delivery  of study  medication 
to the research pharmacist for disposal.

4.2 Subject  Selection  and Enrollment  Considerations  
 
A. Recruitment  Details  
 
General : Recruitment activities take place under the Office of Research and the guidance provided by 
the IRB at Rutgers/RWJ  Medical  School.  The study  will take  place  under  the supervision  of the Pediatrics 
Department and IRB at RWJ Medical School. The Subject Pool includes adolescents and adults with a 
diagnosis of ASD and significant symptoms of aggression or self -injury.  
 
B. Source  of Subjects  
 
Recruitment Procedures: Information about the study will be provided to physicians, special educators, 
behavior  analysts,  and voluntary  agency  staff  and family  advocacy  groups  through  flyers,  advertisements 
and on the RWJ research websites and social media (e.g., Facebook). The study will be registered at 
Clinicaltrials.gov.  
 
C. Method  to Identify  Potential  Subjects  
 
A separate  phone  line will be created  for families  and local  practitioners  to get information  about  the 
study. Children’s Specialized Hospital, Robert Wood Johnson Psychiatry Department and the RWJ. 
Neurology Department provide extensive medical and behavioral services for many adolescents and 
adults  with  ASD.  We will also reach  out to the local  special  education  schools,  voluntary  agencies,  and 
developmental  disabilities  service  providers  (psychiatrists,  neurologists,  developmental  pediatricians, 
behavior analysts) with the study advertisement. We do not anticipate difficulty with recruitment.  
 
Retention : Each participant will be followed through the pre -enrollment phase, enrollment, 
randomization, titration phase, maintenance and cross over phase and open label portion of the study 
through  standardized  study  visits  and safety  monitoring.  We will be enrolling  24 participants  to allow  for 
potential drop out. Procedures to optimize retention and decrease study burden:

1) The initial cardiac function visit will require families to visit the hospital. Financial barriers 
include  costs  of traveling  and parking  for the clinic  appointment  and missed  work.  Our study  will 
provide stipends to defray the cost of transportation/parking.  
2) We are using a telehealth platform (Skype -like) for the clinical follow up. Families will receive 
tablets  through  the study,  or can use their  cell phone  or computers,  for clinical  follow  up visits 
with  clinicians.  We are utilizing  home  Holter  monitoring  with  equipment  that has been  used  in 
other research studies. Families will use prepaid mailers to return the Holter monitors at the 
end of their participation in order to minimize the frequency of travel for clinic visits.  
3) We are using  web -based  platforms  (RedCap)  to enable  families  to complete  questionnaires 
which can be completed at home.  
4) The participants enrolled in the placebo arm of the study will most likely have a delay in 
treatment with the study agent and could be more likely to drop out. However, all families will 
be given  the opportunity  to “un-blind  “from  the treatment  arm and then  enroll  in the open  label 
portion of the study. This will allow us to continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of the 
study medication while minimizing the study burden.  
5) We will keep  frequent  contact  (weekly)  with  study  participants  to address  any concerns  related 
to study burden.  
 
D. Subject  Screening  – initial  telephone  screening  (see  attachment  for telephone  screening)  will occur 
by the Research Coordinator using the following inclusion and exclusion criteria.  
 
Inclusion  Criteria  
 
1. Males  and females  between  the ages  of 12-30 years  and NJ residents.  
2. Diagnosis  of ASD conducted  by a clinician  with  confirmation  such  as ADOS -2 or SCQ.  
3. At least  one of the following  challenging  behaviors:  
a. Self-injurious  behaviors  (i.e. hitting  one’s  self, head  banging  or banging  of other 
body parts causing some degree of tissue damage);  
b. Physical  aggression  towards  others  (i.e. hitting,  kicking,  pushing,  spitting  or throwing 
objects at others);  
c. Disruptive  behaviors  including  property  destruction  during  anger  episodes, 
excessive screaming which interferes with functioning; and 
d. The challenging  behaviors  are generally  (but not necessarily  exclusively)  associated 
with a congruent affect (i.e. anger or rage when aggressing) as determined by the 
study psychiatrist.  
4. Pharmacologic treatment with at least two psychotropic medications including one 
antipsychotic  medication  has yielded  inadequate  outcome  (partial  improvement  on one or 
more medications is acceptable for the study).  
5. Clinical  Global  Impression  Severity  scale  (CGI -S) score  of 6 or 7 (severely  impaired  or most 
severely impaired).  
6. Aberrant  Behavior  Checklist --Community  (ABC -C) Irritability  scale  score  at or above  18

4.3 Subject  Randomization  
Simple  randomization  will be utilized  to allow  for complete  randomness  of the assignment  of a subject 
to a group. With the two treatment groups (placebo first versus treatment first), a computerized 
random number generator will be used for simple randomization of participants.  
 
It is possible  that simple  randomization  method  may  lead  to an unequal  number  of participants  among 
the two groups. Therefore, the research pharmacist will have the option to balance the group 
assignment for the last 3 participants.  
 
4.4 Secondary  Subjects  
 
Participants’ legal guardians will become secondary participants as a result of the information provided 
on behalf of the primary participants. We will take appropriate precautions for data security in order to 
minimize  a breach  of confidentiality  or an invasion  of privacy  to both  primary  and secondary  participants 
from information disclosure. During the study visits, we may observe embarrassing behaviors or 
inadvertently  discover  sensitive  information  about  secondary  participants.  If the risks  are legal  in nature, 
such as observations of unsafe conditions or unlawful behaviors that may need to be reported to law 
enforcement agencies, then proper procedure will be followed. In all other cases, the secondary 
participants’ Consent will be collected during the very first contact and continue throughout the study.

• They will be informed that their participation is voluntary and that they may withdraw 
consent to participate at any time. They will be informed that choosing not to participate 
will not affect  the care  the participant  will receive  from  Rutgers  for the treatment  of his/her 
condition. Participants will again be told that alternative treatments are available if they 
choose not to take part and that such refusal will not prejudice future treatment.  
• The participant and his/her parent, or legally acceptable representative will be given 
sufficient time to read the informed consent form and the opportunity to ask questions. 
After this explanation and before entry into the study, assent and consent will be 
appropriately recorded by means of the participant's assent and the signed and dated 
consent of the participant’s parent or legally acceptable representative. After having 
obtained  the consent,  a copy  of the informed  consent  form  will be given  to the participant 
and his/her parents or legally acceptable representative.  
 
• Individual  Roles  for Researchers  Involved  in Consent - 
 
All study personnel will receive training prior to start date of the study. There will be a kick -off 
meeting  with  the PI and COPIs  as well as research  assistants.  The PI and research  assistants  will 
be organizing consent meetings, providing the consent forms and answering participant 
questions throughout the consent process.  
 
• Consent  Discussion  Duration  
 
The initial consent meeting and discussion will take at least 45 -minutes. Thereafter, the 
consent  (i.e.,  continuation  with  study  participation)  and the upcoming  study  procedures 
will be discussed at each study visit and as necessary.  
 
• Coercion  or Undue  Influence  
 
Participants  and their  parents  or legally  acceptable  representatives  will be informed  that 
their participation is entirely voluntary and that they may withdraw consent/assent at 
any time.  
 
• Subject  Understanding  
 
Minors  or participants  who  are unable  to comprehend  the information  provided  can 
only be enrolled after obtaining consent of his/her parent or legally acceptable 
representative. However, assent will be obtained from participants capable of 
understanding the nature of the study (typically participants with mental age of 
approximately 7 years of age and older).

This research  involves  minors  and adults  with  cognitive  and developmental  disabilities.  
 
A. Minors -Subjects  Who  Are Not Yet Adults  
 
• Criteria  for Consent  of Minors  – Participants  less than  18 years  of age will be considered  minors. 
Consent of minors will not be acceptable due to a diagnosis of intellectual disabilities being an 
inclusion criterion. Parent or legally acceptable representative’s consent will be required.  
• Wards  of the State  N/A 
• Parental  Permission  
 
Parent  or legally  acceptable  representative’s  consent  will be required.  (A legally  acceptable 
representative  is an individual  or judicial  or other  body  authorized  under  applicable  law to 
consent on behalf of a prospective participant to his/her participation in the procedures 
involved in the research.)  
Also, both parents must give their permission unless one parent is deceased, unknown, 
incompetent,  not reasonably  available,  or when  only  one parent  has sole legal  responsibility 
for the care and custody of the research participant.  
 
• Non -Parental  Permission  
Only  parents  and legally  acceptable  representative’s  consent  (a court -appointed  legal  guardian)  will 
be able to provide consent for participation in this research study. For minors who have a legal 
guardian  (non -parental),  we will review  the guardianship  authorization  and complete  the Surrogate 
Certification Form.  
• Assent  Process  
Assent will be obtained from all participants capable of understanding the nature of the study 
(typically,  participants  with  mental  age of 7 years  of age and older).  Every  effort  must  be made  to 
maximize the factors that would promote the ability of the participant to assent.  
 
• Documentation  of Assent  
Assent  will be documented  on the consent  form  by the individual  obtaining  informed  consent.  
. 
• Non -English  Speaking  Subjects  N/A 
The consenting  parent  or legally  acceptable  representative  must  speak  English  in order  to 
complete all study procedures.

All adult study participants, due to the study inclusion criterion of ASD and cognitive and 
developmental disabilities and symptoms of severe aggressive behaviors, will be unable to consent. 
By the age of 18, parents/  other  caregiver  will have  completed  the process  of obtaining  guardianship 
for the adult  participant.  The guardianship  process  is a legal  proceeding  and requires  two physicians 
to certify that the subject is unable to make health care decisions. These physicians are not 
associated  with  the research  study.  Because  ASD and developmental  disabilities  are a pervasive,  life- 
long  condition,  if the participant  does  not have  the capacity  to consent  during  the study  enrollment, 
it is highly improbable that the participants will gain the capacity to consent at a later time.  
We will review  the guardianship  authorization  and complete  the Surrogate  Certification  Form.  The 
parent guardian or legally acceptable representative will provide surrogate consent.  
 
• Capacity  To Consent  
All adult study participants, due to the study inclusion criterion of ASD and cognitive and 
developmental  disabilities  and symptoms  of severe  aggressive  behaviors,  will be not have 
capacity to consent.  
 
• Wards  of the State : N/A 
 
• NJ Law-Selecting  A Witness  
 
For studies at RWJ, an independent advocate who is familiar with informed consent process 
who is unrelated to this research project will be the designated witness for surrogate consent. 
We will be utilizing the Research staff at the Institute for Child Development (ICD) who are not 
involved in our study.  The research staff at ICD are trained on informed consent procedures. 
The written  consent  form  will be signed  and dated  by the ICD research  staff,  who  will serve  as a 
witness.  
• Removing  a Subject  
 
In the event  the participant  or his/her  legally  acceptable  representative  expresses  dissent  or 
withdraws consent, the study blind will be broken.  
● If the participant  was taking  placebo,  it will be immediately  stopped.  
● If the participant  was taking  the active  medication  at the time  of termination,  he/she  will 
still need to safely undergo a titration down to no medication. This may require several 
additional study visits or telemedicine calls.  
 
A follow -up for 2-weeks  beyond  the last day of active  drug  administration  will also be required.  
However,  the participant  and his/her  legally  acceptable  representative  may  also elect  to seek  
follow -up from  their  primary  care  physician  instead.  The study  psychiatrist  will communicate  directly 
with  the primary  care  physician  in such  case,  with  the written  authorization  from  the participant  and

Reproductive  risks:  The effects  of the drug  on the female  or male  reproductive  systems  or on a 
developing fetus are unknown but could cause harm.  
Discomforts:  The participant  may  experience  physical  discomfort  while  undergoing  study  procedures 
such as wearing the Holter monitor and during EKG.  
 
Inconvenience: This study requires many visits that takes time away from the participant’s regular daily 
activities.  Moreover,  participant’s  ongoing  interventions  (e.g.,  behavior  therapy)  are to remain  constant 
without significant changes.

Parents  or legally  acceptable  representatives  may  feel uncomfortable  answering  questions  about  the 
participant’s challenging behaviors, especially if those behaviors have led to risk/harm to the 
participant and/or others in the past.  
 
D. Assessment  of Social  Behavior  Considerations  
 
a) Reasonably  Foreseeable  Risks  
 
Propranolol:  Participants  may  experience  worsening  of challenging  behaviors  or they  may 
experience side effects with the use of propranolol.  
Titration  and Washout : The result  of increasing  or stopping  the study  medicine  could  cause  the 
participant’s challenging behaviors to worsen.  
 
b) Risk Of Imposing  An Intervention  On Subject  With  Existing  Condition  
 
The risk of imposing  a medication  and placebo  on people  with  ASD and severe  challenging  behaviors  is 
assuming  that the individual  wants  to participate  and potentially  ameliorate  these  symptoms.  Because

d) Observation  And  Sensitive  Information  
 
Sensitive information may be disclosed during study visits in -person and during telemedicine 
conferences. Unless the information relates to direct harm or neglect of those involved, all 
information will be held confidential.  
 
E. Minimizing  Risks - Safety  Monitoring  
This is a vulnerable  population,  and as such,  our study  requires  that the study  participants  receive  the 
most careful protection at every stage of the evaluation and treatment.  
The major  side effect  which  we will be vigilant  about  are the cardiac  side effects.  We will continuously 
monitor pulse and blood pressure and any adverse events carefully throughout the study. The 
participants’ parents will have access to telemetric monitoring devices to transmit data at any time. 
Below is a summary of the safety measures for this study:  
 
1. An independent  Data  and Safety  Monitoring  Board  (DSMB)  will be established  to ensure  the safety 
of research  participants  and the integrity  of the study  data.  We have  identified  experts  in the fields 
of neurology/ASD/cardiology  and research  statistics  who  have  agreed  to serve  on the DMSB.  They 
are independent of this study and do not have any conflict of interest. The DSMB will meet prior 
to the enrollment of the  first participant to  review the  research protocol, informed consent, and 
plans  for safety  and data  monitoring  of the study.  Thereafter,  the DSMB  will meet  periodically to 
monitor  progress,  efficacy,  safety,  and other  confidential  data  from  this study.  The PI will provide 
a written report to the Board prior to each meeting. Topics to be discussed during the meetings 
include, but are not limited to, recruitment, protocol compliance, efficacy, and safety. All DSMB 
safety reports recommendations will be sent to the PI, including instructions on forwarding 
recommendations to the Rutgers IRB, the NJ Governor’s Council, and regulatory agencies.  
2. The dose will be stepwise and flexible to allow for subject tolerability. The dose will be titrated 
until adequate therapeutic response is obtained (as decided by the parents and psychiatrist) or 
up to a dose of 600 mg per day (note: propranolol is FDA -approved up to a dose of 640mg). If 
there is suboptimal response (based on the judgment of the psychiatrist and the parent or 
caregivers),  the dose  can be raised  as frequently  as once  per week.  The titration  schedule  however 
will be flexible and the dose can be held steady for an extended period primarily if it is deemed 
that additional  observation  is needed  prior  to increasing  the dose.  The downward  titration

schedule  can be slower,  depending  on clinical  factors  (although  this was not needed  in our 
preliminary study --London et al., under review).  
3. Scheduled  dose  increases  could  be delayed  because  mild  adverse  effects  (i.e. some  nausea, 
tiredness or difficulty adjusting to medication or parent preference) or because of marked 
improvement at a lower dose.  
4. Dose  reduction  to manage  side effects  are allowed  at any time.  
5. We have included a comprehensive cardiac clearance before patients are randomized to 
treatment arms. ( See section  1.3 Research Design and Methods ) to identify subjects with any 
undiagnosed cardiac problems or increased likelihood of adverse reactions to the study drug.  
6. A cardiac Holter monitor test  will be completed at  dose #3 (240 mg) and at  maintenance  dose to 
ensure no significant bradycardia or other cardiac issues ensue. Holter monitoring at high doses 
of propranolol (240 mg or more per day) will evaluate heart rate during sleep and look for 
arrhythmias. HR less than 30 during sleep or any arrhythmia will prompt discontinuation of 
medication.  
7. In addition, we will monitor side effects (see side effect questionnaire screening for the most 
frequent side effects of propranolol), require blood pressure and heart rate to be completed 
during  the first three  days  of each  dose  adjustment.  Medication  will be held  for participants  with 
HR < 90/50  and HR < 50 awake  in asymptomatic  subjects.  A repeat  blood  pressure  will be obtained 
prior to the next dose to ensure BP> 90/50 and HR > 50. The dose will be reduced if more than 2 
doses of the drug are held.  
8.  There is a 24 -hour call center for Pediatric Cardiology and  parents can reach the study doctor 
(psychiatrist /PI) in case of concern.  
9. Families will be instructed to ensure patient is adequately hydrated and to hold medication 
during fever and GI illness with vomiting or diarrhea. Prolonged illness necessitating holding 
more  than  3 days  of study  drug  will prompt  breaking  of the blind.  Subjects  will be offered  the 
option of entering the open label portion of the study.  
10. Adverse events will be reported by the participant and/or by the subject’s parent, primary 
caregiver,  or legally  acceptable  representative  for the duration  of the  study,  and serious adverse 
events  will be recorded  throughout  the study  and will be followed  up until  resolution.  In addition, 
adverse events for the 30 -days following completion of the study will be reported and followed 
by the investigator for 1 week or until resolution, whichever occurs first.  
 
F. Certificate  of Confidentiality  
Certificate  of Confidentiality  will not be obtained.  
 
G. Potential  Benefits  to Subjects  
 
Our preliminary  results  have  shown  a significant  decrease  in aggression,  self-injury,  and/or  disruptive 
behaviors in adults with ASD.

participants to be identified, either directly or through identifiers linked to them.  
 
I. Research  Team  Access  To Subject  Data  
 
Only the authorized research staff will have access to study information and data. The data will be 
stored in a locked cabinet within a locked office in the PI office (1201) in the Children’s Health 
Institute.  Electronic  data  will be stored  securely  in password -protected  computer  with  access  limited 
to the study staff. The data will be collected and processed with adequate precautions to ensure 
confidentiality and compliance with applicable data privacy protection laws and regulations.  
Appropriate  technical  and organizational  measures  to protect  the personal  health  information  against 
unauthorized  disclosures  or access,  accidental  or unlawful  destruction,  or accidental  loss or alteration 
will be put in place. Study personnel whose responsibilities require access to personal health 
information will keep the identity of study participants confidential.

6.0 Research  Data  Protection  and Reporting   
 
6.1 Data  Management  and Confidentiality  
A. Data  Analysis  Plan  
 
1) Aim #1- To demonstrate  the feasibility  of treating  and evaluating  severely  behaviorally 
impaired participants with aggression, self -injury, and disruptive behaviors who are 
diagnosed with ASD, using high dose propranolol to obtain blinded randomized data 
from which to justify a major placebo controlled clinical trial.  
a) Hypothesis  #1- High  dose  propranolol  will show  evidence  of being  effective  in 
treating the symptoms of aggression, self -injurious behaviors and disruptive 
behaviors, defined as greater than a 25% reduction in the ABC -C Irritability 
subscale and a rating of much improved or very much improved on the CGI -I 
scale.

propranolol  as opposed  to placebo.  The preliminary  pilot  data  showed  an 83 percent 
response to propranolol.  
 
Assuming a 20% placebo response and a conservative estimate of a 75% propranolol 
response, we will need to recruit 17 subjects to detect a difference of (75 -20) percent. 
To account  for an anticipated  drop -out rate of 15 percent,  24 subjects  will be recruited.  
 
Outcome measures - Treatment response will be defined as a composite endpoint 
including  [a] greater  than  a 25%  reduction  in the ABC-C Irritability  subscale  score,  and 
[b] a score  of 2 or lower  (much  improved)  on the CGI-Global  Improvement  scale.  
 
2) Aim #2- To document  the cardiac  safety  of various  dosing  levels  of propranolol  through 
follow up blood pressure/heart rate (BP/HR) and repeated Holter monitoring.  
a) Hypothesis #2 - On high doses of propranolol (daily dose of 240 mg or more), 
there  will be a drop  in heart  rate and blood  pressure;  however,  this will not be 
clinically  significant  (HR < 90/50  and HR < 50 awake  and HR< 30 while  sleeping 
and no significant dizziness or fainting or near fainting that would necessitate 
discontinuation of treatment. Holter monitoring those at high doses will not 
show any arrhythmias.  
b) Hypothesis  #2a- At higher  doses,  propranolol  may  cause  a non-clinically 
significant decrease in heart rate and/or blood pressure.  
c) Hypothesis  #2b- Holter  monitoring  of individuals  at a propranolol  dose  of 240 
mg/day or on maintenance dosing will not show any arrhythmias.  
 
Aim #2 will be considered  numeric.  A repeated -measures  analysis  of variance  (ANOVA) 
will be used  to compare BP,  HR, and HR variability  at baseline, on maintenance  dosing, 
and if applicable  at a propranolol  dose  of 240 mg/day.  A Friedman  two-way ANOVA  will 
be used  for data  that is not normally  distributed.  A Friedman  two-way ANOVA  will also 
be used  to compare  BP, HR, and HR variability  at baseline,  on maintenance  dosing,  and 
if applicable at a propranolol dose of 240 mg/day between propranolol and placebo 
patient cohorts.  
 
In case  the study  enrollment  falls short  of the proposed  sample  size,  we will instead  use 
mean scores and range (minimum -maximum) per study phase. The primary efficacy 
parameter will be the change from baseline to study endpoint (i.e., the last data point 
in each phase). Cohen’s d (effect size) will be calculated as (M1 – M2) / SD.  
 
3) Aim #3 - To evaluate and analyze the sensitivity and specificity of the secondary 
dependent  measures  of challenging  behaviors  in order  to develop  novel  and innovative 
data  collection  methods  of studying  this population.  These  novel  methods  will be used 
to develop more rigorous and adequately powered studies in the future.

Aim #3 will be considered ordinal. A Friedman two -way ANOVA will be used to compare 
ABC-C, CGI, and IBR MOAS  questionnaire  results  at baseline  to those  obtained  at the end 
of each propranolol dosage titration.  
 
B. Provide  a power  analysis  
 
All analyses will be intent -to-treat, including all randomized participants who receive at least one 
dose  of double -blind  study  drug,  propranolol.  A P value  less than  0.05  will be considered  statistically 
significant.  
 
C. Describe the steps that will be taken secure the data (e.g., training, authorization of access,  
password  protection,  encryption,  physical  controls,  certificates  of confidentiality,  and separation 
of identifiers and data) during storage, use, and transmission.  
 
All study personnel will receive training prior to start date of the study. There will be a kick -off 
meeting  with  the PI and Co PIs as well  as research  assistants . All study -related  staff  will receive  data 
safety and confidentiality training. Research Staff will ensure the identity of the participants and 
data collected remains confidential. The following safeguards will be implemented to maintain 
human subject confidentiality:  
• Each  participant  will be given  a unique  study  identification  number.  These  identifiers  will be 
transcribed into a logbook with corresponding subject name. The logbook will be kept in a 
locked cabinet in the PI’s office.  
• Only  the personal  study  ID will be used  on data  collection  sheets  where  clinical  data  will be 
transcribed.  
• Participants’  identifiable  information  (such  as name,  DOB,  MR number)  will be removed  from 
collected reports and replaced with the participant unique study I.D. These reports will be 
stored in participant binders and kept in a secure locked cabinet in the PI office.  
• Information  from  the data  collection  sheets  (using  only  subject  unique  ID) will be entered  into 
the RedCap database which will be secured with password protection.  Data collection sheets 
stored in the subject’s binders.  
• Subject  data  will be entered  into a password -protected  database  RedCap  Database.  
• Subject’s parent and legal guardian will complete behavioral data (i.e., questionnaires) online 
through  RedCap.  Each  participant  will be emailed  a link which  opens  to a behavioral  form  with 
subject ID and no identifiers. Once the form is completed by the family member, it is 
automatically  uploaded  to the RedCap  database.  Subject  parent  and legal  guardian  will not be 
able to view the database or other subject files.  
• Any publication  will not include  any identification  of the study  participants  
• The link between  the subject  unique  I.D .and  subject  names  will be destroyed  after  the 
completion of data collection and data analysis.  
• The study  data  will be kept  in a RedCap  database  for a minimum  of 6 years  after  study  closure  or 
publication of the data.

• Confidential  information  obtained  through  written  consent  will be held  exclusively  by the study’s  investigators 
and will in no way influence the access to and quality of medical care provided.  
 
D. Describe  any procedures  that  will be used  for quality  control  of collected  data.  
 
The PIs and the study  staff  will review  all data  on an ongoing  basis  for data  completeness  and 
accuracy. Data verification  will be performed  by someone other than  the individual originally 
collecting the data.  
 
E. Describe  how  data  be handled  study -wide:  
▪ The study  data  will be kept  in a password  protected  database  for a minimum  of 6 years  after 
study closure or publication of the data.  
▪ Access  to the computerized  data  will be strictly  limited  to study  investigators  approved  by the 
Institutional Review Board, except as required by law.  
▪  The study research assistants will be inputting the data into the secure RedCap database. 
Our research team will receive secure passwords to allow for statistical analysis and team 
discussions.  REDCap  provides  automated  export  procedures  for seamless  data  downloads  to 
Excel, PDF, and common statistical packages (SPSS, SAS, Stata, R).  
6.2 Data  Security  
We will consult with the Rutgers Office of Information Technology to safety store all electronic data. 
Study personnel whose responsibilities require access to personal health information will keep the 
identity  of the participants  and data  related  to the study  confidential.  The data  will be stored  in a locked 
cabinet within a locked office. The information on the data collection sheet will be entered into a 
password -protected database RedCap Database with access limited to the study staff. The data will be 
collected and processed with adequate precautions to ensure confidentiality and compliance with 
applicable data privacy protection laws and regulations.  The REDCap application is a secure web 
application for building and managing online databases. REDCap can be installed for compliance with 
such standards as HIPAA, 21 CFR Part 11, FISMA and international standards.  Access to the 
computerized data will be strictly limited to study investigators approved by the Institutional Review 
Board, except as required by law.  
 
For questionnaires and HR/BP data that are collected and transmitted through the internet, the 
participant  and his/her  parent  or legally  acceptable  representative  will have  the participant’s  assigned 
code, rather than name, when submitting the data. There are no foreseeable risks to participation 
except for the remote possibility that the responder’s email or IP address would be inadvertently 
disclosed.

The PIs and the study  staff  will review  all data  on an ongoing  basis  for data  completeness  and accuracy 
as well as protocol compliance. Data verification will be performed by someone other than the 
individual originally collecting the data.  
 
B. Type  of Data  Evaluated  
 
Adverse Events will be labeled according to severity, which is based on their impact on the participant. 
An AE will be termed  “mild”  if it does  not have  a major  impact  on the participant,  “moderate”  if it causes 
the participant some minor inconvenience, and “severe” if it causes a substantial disruption to the 
participant’s well -being.  
 
C. Collection  of Safety  Information  
 
Safety  information  will be collected  using  a side effects  questionnaire  and by the study  psychiatrist 
during the regularly scheduled study appointments.  
 
D. Frequency  Of Data  Collection  
 
Data  are collected  during  screening,  baseline,  and then  every  two weeks  thereafter  until  the study 
completion. Safety data collection begins during baseline.  
 
E. Reviewer  of Data  
 
The medical  data  will be reviewed  by the Drs. Zimmerman -Bier,  and London  on a weekly  basis. 
Behavioral data will be reviewed by Drs. London and Yoo on a weekly basis.  
 
The PI and Co PI’s will meet  monthly  at the start  of the study  and then  quarterly  to discuss  the study 
progress.  
 
We will be using an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) to ensure the safety of 
research participants and the integrity of the study data. The DSMB is comprised of experts in clinical 
trials, statistics, pharmacology and autism. They have no direct relationship with the study. The DMSB 
will meet  quarterly  or as needed  ad hoc to monitor  the progress,  efficacy,  safety,  and other  confidential 
data from this study.

F. Schedule  Of Review  Of Cumulative  Data  
 
The PI will meet with the RA bi weekly to discuss and review the study progress. This will include 
screening data, outreach and recruitment. The PI will review study documents, informed consent, data 
acquisition  and any safety  issues  (e.g.,  failed  cardiac  screening  or participant  adverse  events).  The PI will 
review the RA progress in task completion and develop plans to meet the study ongoing needs.  
 
The PI and Co PI will meet  quarterly  to discuss  the study  including  challenges  and accomplishments. 
Each member will provide updates on the study. The results of the DSMB quarterly analysis will be 
reviewed by each member of the team.  
 
G. Tests  for Safety  Data  
 
The DSMB review will be centered in systematic analysis of Adverse Events (AEs) and Serious Adverse 
Events  (SAEs).  The DSMB  review  will analyze  the Adverse  Events  (AEs)  and Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAEs) 
including their occurrence, grading, and causality. The Board will consider dropout rates and reasons, 
hypothesis validation, analysis of outcome data, and its relationship to potential modifications in study 
design and procedures, and participant complaints, in their written safety reports. Monitoring adverse 
effects and a sequential stopping rule may be formed in two ways:  
1) Bayesian  approach  to evaluating  the proportion  of participants  with  side effects  
2) Hypothesis  testing  approach  using  the sequential  probability  ratio  test to see if the normal, 
acceptable side effect rate has been exceeded.  
 
H. Suspension  of Research  
 
This study will be stopped prior to its completion if: (1) propranolol is associated with adverse effects 
that call into question  the safety  of the intervention;  (2) any new  information  becomes  available  during 
the trial that necessitates  stopping  the study;  or (3) other  situations  occur  that might  warrant  stopping 
the study.  
 
6.4 Reporting  Results  
 
A. Sharing  of Results  with  Subjects  
The study results will be shared with each participant and his/her parent or legally acceptable 
representative.  The results  will be conveyed  by the study  psychiatrist  at the termination  of the double - 
blind study.

1)To examine the feasibility and acceptability of the Whole Health  Lifestyle Care for 
Reproductive Well-being  Pilot  Program (“Lifestyle Care for Fertility” or LCF) and 
collection of health behavior and patient-reported outcomes 
2)To examine the longitudinal changes in health  behaviors, and patient reported 
outcomes of participants in the Lifestyle  Care for Fertility  program
2.Background
Approximately 10 to 15% of couples are impacted by infertility (1). Struggles  with fertility  can 
have a wide range of effects on an individual’s and couple’s life including physical, emotional, 
sexual, spiritual,  and financial aspects. Studies have shown that infertile couples experience 
significant emotional distress including anxiety, grief, loss,  and depression (2). Fertility 
treatments can be physically demanding and uncomfortable,  with side effects including pain, 
mood changes, headaches, bloating, hot flashes,  and sleep disturbance. Recently, research is 
starting to focus more on diet and lifestyle  factors as a way to improve time to pregnancy and 
therefore lessen the burden of infertility  felt by couples (3, 4, 5). Lifestyle factors are the 
modifiable habits and ways of life that can greatly influence overall health and well-being,  
including fertility. Many  lifestyle factors such as nutrition, weight, exercise, psychological stress, 
environmental toxins, and others can have substantial effects on fertility.
A combination lifestyle  approach is an evidence-based practice in which nutrition, exercise,  and 
integrative therapies such as mindfulness training and stress management have  been shown to 
improve health and well-being,  as well as positively impact chronic disease  management (6). 
Evidence shows  that patient-centered coaching yields positive results related to lifestyle 
behaviors (7). Health and wellness coaching (HWC) can provide significant value  to patients’ 
healthcare in the combination lifestyle  approach (7). Applying the concept  of HWC to fertility  
patients has the potential  to yield  improved fertility outcomes, decreased time  to pregnancy, 
and enhanced well-being during  the fertility journey, healthier pregnancy as pre-conception is 
an ideal time  to optimize diet and lifestyle  habits,  and impact future generations with better 
health and better health habits.  This combination  lifestyle approach is particularly important for 
women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) which is one of the most common causes of 
female infertility. International evidence-based  guidelines  for the management  of PCOS include 
the recommendation  of healthy lifestyle  behaviors encompassing healthy  eating,  weight loss,  
and regular exercise,  which are all supported through HWC (8).

4.Study Design
This is an observational outcome evaluation of the Lifestyle Care  for Fertility  program. 
5.Study Procedures
Setting
Consent will take  place either virtually via telehealth or in a private room at the UH Connor  
Whole Health (CWH) Beachwood  office.  The shared medical appointments (SMA) occur at the 
CWH Beachwood office  and the individual Health and Wellness Coaching (HWC) sessions  are 
virtual. Data  will be collected via a link to REDCap sent to participants’ mobile device.
Participants and Recruitment:
Study participants will be patients of UH CWH  who have a fertility-related diagnosis and who 
are participating in LCF. Patients are referred to the program by their Integrative Medicine 
provider. The HWC, who is also IRB approved  research  staff, will then  screen program 
participants for research  eligibility and send a recruitment email  about the research to those 
who meet eligibility criteria. Seven days  later, the program’s HWC  will call the patient to tell 
them about the research study and ask if they are interested to particpate. The HWC will make 
it clear that the patient  can participate in the program without  participating in the research. If 
the patient  is interested in participating in the research, the HWC  will verify that the patient has 
access to a mobile device  with  a data  plan  to complete the study surveys.  The coach  will then 
schedule the informed consent with  those who have appropriate access.
Consent Process
The consent process  begins when the HWC first calls  the potential participant and explains the 
study to them. Interested individuals  will schedule a time to meet with the coach or other  
research staff via telehealth or in person, depending on patient preference and availability,  for 
consent. Potential  participants will receive a copy  of the informed consent form ahead  of time  
by mail or email and be asked to read it carefully. At the scheduled time via telehealth, the 
research staff will present the consent  form  in detail, making sure the participant  understands 
the research by encouraging them to ask any questions they may have,  and asking them  to 
explain what  the study  will involve in their own words. The participant a will be given sufficient 
time to read the informed consent form  and the opportunity to ask questions. The patient will 
be informed that acceptance or refusal to participate in the research  will not influence their

withdraw from study  participation at any time.  Once  all of the patient’s  questions  are 
answered, they  will sign an electronic version of the consent form in REDCap, either  on their 
own device or on a study iPad.
For consents conducted via telehealth, research staff will confirm the identity of the patient 
before signing the consent. Potential  participants  will confirm their identity by showing his/her  
driver’s license or, if not available,  any state or government-issued picture identification card.  If 
they do not have picture identification available,  they will be asked  to provide the last four 
digits of the social security number, their date of birth and one of the following: account 
number, street address,  insurance carrier name, insurance  policy number,  medical record  
number, birth certificate  or insurance card.
Immediately following the consent,  the research staff will send participants  a REDCap link to 
complete the demographics form  to be completed on the participant’s  own device or on the 
study iPad. The remaining  baseline surveys  will also be sent at this time if the first session is 
scheduled for within  two weeks of the consent  appointment. Otherwise the link to the 
remaining baseline  surveys will be sent when it is within two weeks  of Session 1.
Intervention Delivery
The program consists  of an individual Integrative Health and Medicine (IHM)  consultation  with 
a CWH IHM provider,  4 Shared  Medical Appointments (SMA) and 4 individual Health  and 
Wellness Coaching (HWC) sessions. The SMA  sessions take place at the UH CWH Beachwood 
office conference and movement rooms.  The HWC sessions are virtual. The consultations  are 
either virtual or in person at UH CWH  Beachwood.
The following are the topics for each of the 8 weekly sessions:
Week Type of Session Topic
1 Shared Medical 
Appointment (SMA) “NOURISH” with Nutrition experiential and cooking demo. 
2 Health and Wellness 
Coaching (HWC) Implement “NOURISH” education  into patient’s  personal life.

Participation in the program is not contingent  participation in the outcome  evaluation. Patients 
with a uterus aged 18-50 who  have a fertility  related  diagnosis are eligible  to participate in the 
program. Participants in the outcome  evaluation will be a subset  of the participants  in the 
program who give their consent to researchers to collect  survey and EHR data.
Data Collection
Data will be collected at baseline, at 4 weeks, 8 weeks,  and before, after,  and in between each 
of the 8 weekly sessions. Data collected at baseline include demographics, PROMIS Sleep 
Disturbance 8a, Perceived Stress Scale 4 (PSS-4), Infertility  Self Efficacy Scale (ISE), and current  
Health Behaviors (HB). The HB survey  will be administered between  Sessions 1-8, as well as 
after Session 8, to observe any longitudinal changes. Patients will complete the PROMIS Sleep 
Disturbance 8a, PSS-4,  and ISE at 4 weeks and 8 weeks. Pre- and post- session data includes 0-
10 NRS ratings of stress,  energy, focus,  wellbeing, perceived support  (post-only), and 
satisfaction (post-only). Additionally, participants will complete a satisfaction  survey post 
Session 8. All data will be collected  in REDCap via a text message or email link sent to the 
participant. Research staff will conduct  a review of the participant’s medical  record  to collect 
data on the participant’s demographics  and clinical characteristics at baseline, and to collect 
chemical pregnancy data at six months after the 8 sessions have been completed. This data will 
be entered  into REDCap.

8.Data Analysis  Plan
Acceptability
Patients’ responses  on the satisfaction survey will be assessed using descriptive  statistics.
Feasibility of Study Recruitment and Retention 
We will use counts and percentages to summarize recruitment rates  (#enrolled/#approached) 
and pace of accrual for the study, as well as retention rates of study participants  
(#attended/#enrolled) at each program  session.
Demographics and clinical  characteristics
We will use descriptive statistics (e.g. means,  standard deviations,  counts, and percentages) to 
summarize demographics (e.g., education level,  age, income)  and clinical  characteristics (e.g., 
fertility-related diagnoses and duration  of fertility treatment). 
Effects on patient-reported outcomes
Descriptive statistics (e.g. means, standard deviations, counts,  and percentages) will be 
generated for (1) patient-reported outcomes  (PRO)  collected at baseline,  4 weeks and 8 weeks 
(2) pre-and  post-session NRS measures; and (3) responses to the health behavior survey. We 
will use linear mixed  effects models to assess  changes in quantitative  measures of perceived 
stress, sleep disturbance,  and self-efficacy over the course of the program. Means  and 
bootstrapped 95% CI will be used to assess single-session effects on numeric rating scale  
measures of stress, energy, focus, and wellbeing.  All statistical analyses will be conducted using  
R and RStudio.
Data Completeness
Data collected via REDCap at each  time point will be evaluated for quality and completeness  
using reporting functions within REDCap.

v1 12.20.2023 Page  7 of 99.Risks to Research Participants
Some of the questions might make participants  feel uncomfortable. They  may skip any 
questions that they may find upsetting. 
There is a slight risk to losing privacy and confidentiality. All paper records will be kept in locked 
file cabinets and all electronic data  will be stored in a password protected database to which 
only study staff  will have  access.
10. Provisions to Protect the Privacy  Interests of Research Participants
Privacy will be ensured by conducting all study related interactions,  including the consent  
process, within the private spaces, whether that is in person at the UH CWH clinic or remotely. 
Confidentiality of the research data will be protected  in several ways.  Any paper study 
documents will be stored in locked  cabinets within the locked research offices of the PI and/or 
study staff.  Participants will be identified by a separate study ID number  on all study records.  
The lists that link study ID codes with  participant  names, and all electronic study records will be 
stored on password-protected, encrypted  computers  or secure servers. Only aggregate data  
will be presented or published, and will be presented such that individuals cannot be identified. 
Only IRB approved  study personnel will have access to participant data.  All study personnel will 
be required to be certified in the protection of human subjects throughout the study.
Identifiable information will not be reused  or disclosed  to any person or entity outside of 
University Hospitals  other than those identified  in the protocol, except as required by law, for 
authorized oversight  of the research study, or as specifically approved for use in another  study 
by the IRB.
11. Potential Benefit to Research  Participants
There is no guarantee of benefits  to any participant in the outcome evaluation,  but the 
knowledge gained may be of benefit to future fertility patients who  participate in the program.  
 
12.Withdrawal of Research Participants
The study PI can withdraw participation of research participants  at any time without their 
consent for the following reasons:
• If the subject fails to follow directions  for participating in the study;
• If it is discovered  that the subject  does not meet the study requirements;
• If the study  is canceled; or 
• For administrative reasons, including competitive enrollment - the target number  of 
subjects has entered the study.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Based on your child’s participation in the initial phase of this project, we are asking for your 
permission for your child to participate in phase II of this research study. Our goal is to repeat the 
phase I study in the athletes remaining on the soccer team so that we can learn new information that 
may help others. If you decide not to give your permission for your child to be in this study, we will still 
take good care of her.  If you decide to allow your child to be in this study, you may change your mind 
at any time during the study and your child can stop being in the study.  Take all the time you need to 
make your choice.  Ask us any questions you have. It is also okay to ask more questions after you 
decide to allow your child to be in the study.  You can ask questions at any time.   
 
 
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS RESEARCH? 
 
In phase II of this research study we want to learn more about the long term effects of device that was 
previously investigated  presently called the “Q collar (see Figure below), which may help prevent 
concussions.  The neck collar device is made of soft plastic, and silicone, over a gentle embedded 
metal “spring” that is fitted around the neck providing comfortable compression to two of the veins on 
the side of the neck.  Based on phase I results, we are continuing to test the theory that this mild 
compression will help prevent concussions by back-filling the empty space around the brain with 
some blood and thereby acting like “bubble wrap” around it.  It has been suggested that many “head 
banging animals” may be using a similar protection in the wild. 
 
In addition, for phase II of the project we wish to learn more about how the brain responds to 
concussive impacts during sport and if it returns back to normal without head impact exposure over 
the past year.  .   
 
We are asking your child who participated in phase I of the study because we want to learn more

period. In addition to determine the long term effects of collar wear and recovery on brain 
microstructure, those participants from Phase I who have graduated or are not playing soccer will be 
asked to participate in a single follow-up visit in the late summer/fall of 2017.  This single study visit 
will consist of brain MRI and EEG tests. 
  
 
WHO IS IN CHARGE OF THE RESEARCH?  
 
Greg Myer, PhD is the researcher at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) that is 
in charge of this study.   
 
CCHMC is being paid by Q30 Labs, LLC to do this study. 
 
 
WHO SHOULD NOT BE IN THE STUDY 
 
Your child cannot be in this study if he/she has any of the following: 
 History of neurological deficits or  severe head trauma 
 Known increased intracerebral pressure, metabolic acidosis or alkalosis 
 Any known increased pressure in eyes  
 any known increased fluid on the brain 
 Recent penetrating brain trauma (within 6 months) known increased pressure in the brain 
 Any known blood clots to the brain 
 Any known airway obstruction 
 Did not participate in phase I of the project 
 
 
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IN THE STUDY? 
 
The research staff will explain each visit to you and may give you a handout that explains each visit in 
more detail.  You will be able to ask questions to make sure that you understand what will happen to 
your child.  We will also ask parents/guardians of study participants to complete a brief behavioral 
rating scale that assesses indications of ADHD. We will send you a link via email to complete this 
questionnaire via a REDCap online survey.  This questionnaire will take you no longer than 5-10 
minutes to complete. 
 
If your child qualifies and you decide you want your child to be in the study, your child will come to 
CCHMC at least 3 times over the next 9 months.   If your child is diagnosed with a concussion during 
the sports season, your child may be asked to come to CCHMC for additional study visits.  The study 
visit will take about 90 minutes to complete.

If your child was NOT assigned to the device-wearing group in phase 1, your child will wear the Q 
collar during their practices and games that will fit around their neck which will place light pressure on 
their neck.  While most do not find this uncomfortable, the pressure on your child’s neck will feel like 
wearing a necktie.  The neck collar device is made of plastic, silicone, and metal that is fitted to the 
neck providing comfortable pressure around the neck.  Studies have shown that there is no significant 
change in blood flow or oxygen uptake pattern or any negative cognitive effect to the brain (even with 
prolonged similar physiology of wearing a tight necktie) and therefore the risk of wearing this device is 
low.  It has also been tested during high intensity exercise and has shown no effect on performance, 
and has been deemed safe.   
 
This device is ONLY to be used during the soccer team games and practices. This device will NOT 
go home with the athlete.     
 
These are the things that will happen to your child while in the study: 
1. Neck Circumference, Height, Weight, and Body Fat % Measurements: We will measure the 
circumference of your child’s neck with a measuring tape. We will also measure your child’s 
height, weight, and body fat percentage using a standard measuring stick for height and a 
scale for weight and body fat percentage. This will be completed once at pre-season and once 
at post-season. 
2. IMPACT (Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing) Test:   This test will 
be administered on a computer and will assess your child’s verbal and visual memory, 
processing speed and reaction time.  This test will be completed at pre-season and at post-
season.  
3. Eye Tracking:  For this test, your child will look at several points in order to calibrate the desk-
top eye tracker .Your child then will be asked to follow a moving object with his/her eyes on a 
computer screen. This test will be completed at pre-season and at post-season. 
4. MRI Imaging:  Your child will be asked to lie down in a machine that will take images of her 
brain. For part of this test, your child may be asked to lay still.  For other parts of this test, your 
child may be asked to answer questions that will assess his/her thinking and memory.  This test 
will be completed at the pre-season and post-season time points and will take approximately 60 
minutes to complete.   Prior to the imaging appointment, your child will be asked to complete a 
screening questionnaire to ensure that she does not have any contraindications to this type of 
scan. If any contraindications are revealed (i.e. permanent metal dental/orthodontic work, 
cochlear implant, cardiac pacemakers, orthopedic pins/screws/plates, etc) your child will not 
complete the MRI imaging portion of this study.  This will not affect their participation in the 
remaining parts of this project. 
5. Accelerometers:   An accelerometer is a device that measures how fast something is moving.  
Your child will be provided with an X-patch accelerometer that will collect information on the 
collisions that happen while playing soccer.  An accelerometer is a very small device that 
measures the acceleration and rotation of the head. Your child’s play will not be affected by 
this. 
6. Injury tracking:  We will be monitoring your child ’s injuries throughout the competitive sports

Parental Permission Version – 4.0 Page 4 of 9 season and collecting information about your child’s injuries from the athletic trainer.   
 
7. Menstruation questionnaire- Your child will complete an online questionnaire monthly, while 
participating in the study.  Answers from this questionnaire will allow study staff to determine 
the approximate status of their menstruation cycle.  Subjects will be emailed the link to 
complete the questionnaire each month during participation in the study. Your child will also 
complete a menstruation questionnaire at the time of the pre-season study visit. 
8. Follow Up Visits – If your child is diagnosed with a concussion during the competitive sport 
season, we will have your child come in for an additional study visit 1-5 days after your injury.  
During this visit, your child would be asked to complete all of the same tests plus complete a 
Post-Concussion Symptom Inventory (PCSI) form.  If your child has a concussion, her care will 
be not affected by participation in this study. 
 
Group Assignment:  Your child will be assigned to the OPPOSITE group as they were last season in 
phase I 1) Subjects wearing the Q-collar device (seen in Figure on page 1) around the neck or 2) 
Subjects not wearing the Q-collar device for the season.  Both groups will complete the same testing. 
Ultrasound will be used to ensure proper fitting of the collar.  This fitting visit will be completed at the 
school before the first official practice.  The study coordinator will visit the team weekly to monitor the 
use of the collar.  The school athletic trainer will be there daily to ensure proper use and compliance.  
 
In addition to determine the long term effects of collar wear and recovery on brain microstructure, 
those participants from Phase I who have graduated or are not playing soccer will be asked to 
participate in a single follow-up visit in the late summer/fall of 2017.  This single study visit will consist 
of brain MRI and EEG tests. 
 
 
WHAT ARE THE GOOD THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN FROM THIS RESEARCH? 
 
Being in this study may not help your child right now.  When we finish the study, we hope that we will 
know more about this device and its effectiveness in preventing concussions.  This may help us 
prevent concussions later on.  We do not currently know if this device will protect your child from 
suffering a concussion injury. 
 
 
WHAT ARE THE BAD THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN FROM THIS RESEARCH? 
 
There are no known risks of wearing the Q collar device.  There are no known negative effects from 
exposure to the magnet or radio waves used in the MRI at this time; however it is possible that 
harmful effects could be recognized in the future.   The tight space of the MRI may make some 
people feel uncomfortable.  One known risk is that the magnet can attract certain kinds of metal. 
Therefore, we will have all subjects complete a pre-MRI screening questionnaire.  If there is any 
indication from this questionnaire that the MRI is not safe your child will not have the MRI testing.  
The MRI testing will require your child to lie on their back and remain still for the duration of the test, 
which could last about 60 minutes. Due to the nature of the test, there will be a loud knocking noise 
that your child will hear while the test is being performed.  Your child will be instructed  that if at any

Parental Permission Version – 4.0 Page 5 of 9 point during the test, you can signal to the research staff to stop the test if you get too uncomfortable. 
 
There is also a minimal risk that the data collected may be viewed by individuals outside the research 
team. The risk that confidential data may be viewed is relevant for both the written forms and the 
electronic databases. 
 
Wearing this device does not allow your child to adjust the safety measures put into place about how 
to play the sport of soccer in a safe manner.  
 
There may be o ther risks that we do not know about yet.  
 
WHAT OTHER CHOICES ARE THERE? 
 
Instead of being in this study, you can choose not to have your child be in it.   Participating in this 
research is completely voluntary.  Your child will not be punished if she decides not to participate.  
 
 
HOW WILL INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR CHILD BE KEPT PRIVATE? 
  
Making sure that information about your child remains private is important to us.  To protect your 
child’s privacy in this research study we will:  keep the results of this study confidential. No subject 
identification will be made public record in any form unless you give your expressed written 
permission of release of your child’s name, photograph or likeness captured on video.  Your child has 
the right to privacy.  We will protect your child’s privacy to the extent allowed by law.  All facts about 
this study that can describe a subject’s name will be kept private.  Results of the study will be 
summarized regarding age, etc., but we will take every precaution necessary to keep names private.  
All subject data will be blinded from the researchers with the use of an identification code.  Personal 
information and identifiers will be securely recorded and filed by the administrative assistant.  The 
data will be encrypted with a password and stored on a personal computer and backed up on a 
network drive.  We will be available for any questions that might arise. 
 
Because this research study involves payment for participation we are required by federal Internal 
Revenue Service (IRS) rules to collect and use your social security or tax ID number (SSN) in order 
to track the amount of money that we pay you.  Unless you have given specific permission for another 
use of your SSN related to this research we will only use your SSN to keep track of how much money 
we pay you and your SSN will not be used as part of this research. 
 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may choose to inspect your child’s records since your child 
is a subject in this investigation of an unapproved device.  
 
 
WHAT IF WE LEARN NEW INFORMATION DURING THE RESEARCH?   
 
The study doctor will tell you if they find out about new information from this or other studies that may 
affect your child’s health, safety or your willingness for your child to stay in this study.

Parental Permission Version – 4.0 Page 6 of 9 The MR imaging that your child is having as part of this research study will be reviewed by a qualified 
radiologist just as it would be if you were having the MRI as part of your child’s routine medical care.  
There is a possibility that while reviewing your child’s MRI we may see an abnormality that we did not 
expect to see in this study. This is what is called an "incidental finding." We will let you know if we see 
such an incidental finding. Depending on the type of incidental finding, we may contact you by mail or 
by phone. If you want, we will give information about this incidental finding to your primary doctor or 
we will refer you to an appropriate doctor for further evaluation. The costs for any care that will be 
needed to diagnose or treat an incidental finding would not be paid for by this research study. These 
costs would be your responsibility.   
 
WILL IT COST YOU ANYTHING EXTRA FOR YOUR CHILD TO BE IN THE RESEARCH STUDY?  
 
Participating in this study will not cost you anything other than time and effort.  Your insurance will not 
be billed for any testing associated with this study.   
 
 
WILL YOU/YOUR CHILD BE PAID TO BE IN THIS RESEARCH STUDY?  
 
You will be reimbursed for your time, effort and travel while you are in this research study. 
 
You (your child) will receive payment for this study in the form of a reloadable debit card (Clincard).  
We will give you (your child) a handout that will explain how to use the card.  Because you (your 
child) are being paid for your participation, CCHMC is required by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 
to collect and use your (your child’s) social security number (SSN) or taxpayer identification number 
(TIN) to track the amount of money that we pay.  You will need to complete a Federal W-9 form for 
this income tax reporting.  This form requires your child’s Social Security number.  This form will be 
given to the CCHMC business office.  It will not be kept as part of your child’s study chart.  If you 
move, you will need to complete another W-9 with an updated address. 
 
You (your child) will be paid $50 Clincard Mastercard ® at the first study visit, and a $100 Clincard 
Mastercard® for completing the second study visit.  If you are diagnosed with a concussion, you will 
receive an additional $50 Clincard Mastercard® for completing a follow up study visit after the 
concussion diagnosis. If you suffer an acute knee injury, you will receive an additional $50 Clincard 
Mastercard® for completing a follow up study visit after the injury. Subjects that have graduated, no 
longer participating in soccer, or not participating in a second season as a study participant, will 
receive $100 Clincard Mastercard® gift card for completing a one-time follow-up testing session.  You 
will receive a $100 Clincard Mastercard® for completing the follow-up testing session 8-12 weeks 
after your post-season session.  
 
 
WHAT HAPPENS IF YOUR CHILD IS INJURED FROM BEING IN THIS STUDY?  
 
This research does not require that the participant maintains participation in their sport. The desire to 
participate in the sporting event is an independent, personal decision separate from the decision to

Parental Permission Version – 4.0 Page 7 of 9 enter into this study.  During the course of this study, we expect that injuries consistent with the sport 
being played will occur, such as head injuries, sprains, fractures, and muscle injuries.  Some of these 
injuries may be severe and have severe consequences.  The choice to participate in the sports and 
accept the risk of the participation in the sport you have chosen is entirely a choice made by you.   
Neither the study investigator (Dr. Myer) nor CCHMC will be responsible for the medical treatment of 
any sport related injuries.  While the likelihood of an injury related to this research is small, if you 
believe that you have been injured as a result of this research you should contact Gregory Myer, PhD 
as soon as possible to discuss the concerns.  Treatment for injuries is available at CCHMC.  If you go 
to the Emergency Room or to another hospital or doctor it is important that you tell them that you are 
in a research study.  If possible, you should give them a copy of this consent form. 
 
CCHMC follows a policy of making all decisions about compensation for the medical treatment of 
physical injuries that happened during or were caused by research on an individual basis. 
 
 
WHO DO YOU CALL IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS OR PROBLEMS?

How will you know that your child’s PHI is not misused? 
People that receive your child’s PHI as part of the research are generally limited in how they can use 
your child’s PHI.  In addition, most people who receive your child’s PHI are also required by federal 
privacy laws to protect your child’s PHI.  However, some people that may receive your child’s PHI 
may not be required to protect it and may share the information with others without your permission, if 
permitted by the laws that apply to them.   
 
Can you change your mind? 
You may choose to withdraw your permission at any time.  A withdrawal of your permission to use 
and share your child’s PHI would also include a withdrawal from participation in the research study.  If 
you wish to withdraw your permission to use and share your child’s PHI you need to notify the study 
doctor, listed on the first page of this document, in writing.  Your request will be effective immediately 
and no new PHI about your child will be used or shared.  The only exceptions are (1) any use or 
sharing of PHI that has already occurred or was in process prior to you withdrawing your permission 
and (2) any use or sharing that is needed to maintain the integrity of the research. 
 
Will this permission expire? 
Your permission will expire at the end of the study.  If the study involves the creation or maintenance 
of a research database repository, this authorization will not expire.  
 
Will your child’s other medical care be impacted? 
By signing this document you agree for child to participate in this research study and give permission 
to CCHMC to use and share your child’s PHI for the purpose of this research study.  If you refuse to 
sign this document your child will not be able to participate in the study.  However, your child’s rights 
concerning treatment not related to this study, payment for services, enrollment in a health plan or 
eligibility of benefits will not be affected.

 1 Introduction  
 
This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study will be carried out in accordance with the 
applicable United States government regulations and Mayo Clinic research policies and procedures.   
1.1 Background 
 
Androgenic alopecia (AGA) is a common, progressi ve hair  loss disorder affecting both sexes with significant 
negative impact on social and psychological well -being. The frequency and severity increases with age, and up 
to 80% of men, and 50% of women are affected by AGA over the course of their lives. (Piraccini 2014) 
(Varothai ) (Bologna  - book)   While men are more frequently affected, the psychological impact is likely to be 
high for  women where the social impact of hair loss is often devastating. Current medical therapies specifically 
approved by the US  FDA are l imited to minoxidi l (for men and women) and finasteride  (for men only) 
(Varothai) , but variable responses  and the need for indefinite use  often result in patient fatig ue and suboptimal 
compliance.   (Gupta)   
 Recently, there has been interest in treatments orientated to more biologically regenerative therapies, and consequently there have been numerous studies that have demonstrated successful use for platelet rich plasma  
(PRP)  in treating AGA.  (Singhal)  (Maria -Angeliki
) (Gentile)  (Trink)  (Gkini) (Cerveli)  (Uebel) (Greco) 
(Takikawa) (Kang) (Betsi) (Sclafani) (Khatu) (Schiavone)  PRP contains concentrated platelet cells derived from 
autologous whole blood that are believed to activate a cascade of growth factors when injected into an area of poor hair growth that stimulates hair growth . (Jain) (Lubkowska) In this proposal we will examine whether PRP 
therapy provides similar or better hair growing capacity in women compared to  the conventional topical 
application minoxidil. 
1.2 Investigational Agent 
 
Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP)  
 
1.3 Clinical Data to Date 
PRP is an autologous concentration of human platelets in a small volume of plasma that  has a 4- 7 times higher 
platelet concentration than  baseline.(Jain)  (Lubkowska )  (Parsley)  Since activated platelets secrete a number of 
cytokines and growth factors, such as  platelet -derived growth factor, epidermal growth factor, transforming 
growth factor, and vascular endothelial growth factor, (Ja in) (Lubkowska ) ( Parsley ) PRP may provide an 
attractive therapy to promote hair growth in the declining hair follicle.  
 
Recent investigators have explored the use of PRP as a treatment modality for AGA, with most available studies to date showing positive  results.  (Singhal) (Maria -Angeliki
) (Gentile )  (Trink) (Gkini) (Cerveli)  PRP is 
attractive as a useful treatment for nonscarring alopecia’s such as AGA, because the treatment is safe  and 
adverse effects appear to be negligible. (Singhal) (Maria -Angeliki ) (Gentile )  (Trink) (Gkini) (Cerveli) 
However, the  effect of PRP on hair growth has been studied primarily in men. Studies that include men and 
women usually do not analyze the data according to sex or comment on whether sex differences were observed . 
(Trin k) (Takikawa) (Kang) (Betsi) (Sclafani) (Schiavone) (Gkini) Although s ex differences  are known to exist  
in the incidence, diagnosis and mechanisms leading to AGA, women are understudied ( Farage) (Romanelli) . 
The need to understand hair loss in women is underscored by the growing interest of cosmetic derma tologists 
and plastic surgeons to use PRP routinely in their aesthetic and rejuvenation practice to reduce/prevent hair loss.  
7 
  
A recent review of  the availabl e literature regard ing PRP treatment for hair loss  identified 14 articles des cribing 
the use of PRP, 12 of which were used for AGA.  (Maria -Angeliki ) This systematic review considered 7 studies 
to be of moderate quality, 4 of low quality and 3 of very low.  Of the 7 trials of moderate quality, all reported a 
statistically significant increase in the number of hairs and hair density  following PRP  therapy , indicating a 
positive response to treat ment. The predominant criticisms  of the trials to date are the lack of a consensus 
protocol regarding the exact concentration  of PRP , dose, frequency, depth of injecti ons, and number of required 
sessions. Variability in evaluation methods also limits accurate comparison  between the studies  (i.e., global 
photographs, phototrichograms, dermascopic images, hair pull test, and manual counting were all reported as 
measurement tools). In addition, these studies predominantly used men.  Very little published data exists for 
PRP use in women with AGA. T he studies that did include women  examined  very low numbers and/or did not 
analyze results according to  sex so that it is not possible to evaluate whether PRP therapy is safe and efficacious 
in women. (Trink) (Takikawa) (Kang) (Betsi) (Sclafani) (Schiavone) (Gkini) Nonetheless, PRP appears to be a 
useful treatment for AGA , particularly in men, and there is an urgent need for randomized controlled studies 
with standardized measurement techniques and reproducible protocols to study clinical efficacy . Considering 
the widespread use of PRP in cosmetic clinics among women and the lack of data on the effect of PRP on hair 
regeneration  in women there is a great need to perform a controlled trial in women. In future studies we would 
like to examine whether PRP is equally effective in men and women and to examine its mechanism of action.  
1.4 Dose Rationale and Risk/Benefits 
 
We will dose PRP in a manner similar to previous trials. (Gentile, Trink, Cerveli)  Fresh PRP will be harvested  
from the individual and their own PRP administered at three time  points, once every 4 weeks  for a totally 
treatment time of 12 weeks . Minoxidil will be used according to  FDA and manufacturer instructions daily for 
12 weeks. 
 Risks associated with  PRP therapy  include possible pain, redness, and/or irritation at the site of injections for up 
to 2- 3 days post injection. P ublished human data indicate  no significant adverse events related to injection of 
PRP into the skin and previous authors utilizing similar protocols reported no infection, fever, hematoma, tissue 
hypertrophy, or major adverse events among the subjects. (Singhal) (Cerveli)
 (Gentile)  (Trink) (Gkini) Known 
possible risks for Minoxidil include chest pain, rapid heartbeat, faintness,  dizziness, sudden or 
unexplained weight gain, swelling of the hands or feet, scalp irritation or redne ss, changes in 
hair color and texture, and unwanted facial hair growth.  
  
2 Study Objectives  
 
The overall goal of this study is to develop regenerative cell therapy for use in female patients with AGA. The 
primary objective of this proposal is to conduct a pilot study on the efficacy  of using PRP to treat this type of 
hair loss in females .

4.3 Subject Recruitment, Enrollment and Screening  
 
Subjects will be recruited from the clinical practice of the Department of Dermatology, Mayo Clinic Florida. 
Patients seeking treatment for Androgenic Alopecia will be offered standard conservative medical therapy for 
their disease as part of rou tine dermatological treatment. As an alternative, patients will be informed of the 
study protocol, and offered the option to enroll if they meet the study eligibility  criteria.  
 
4.4 Early Withdrawal of Subjects 
4.4.1 When and How to Withdraw Subjects  
 
Subjects may withdraw from the study at any time for the following: 
• Subject safety issues  
• Subject decision to withdraw from the study (withdrawal of consent) 
• Subject’s decision to pursue other therapeutic regimens, either surgical or non- surgical  
 
4.4.2 Data Collection and Follow- up for Withdrawn Subjects  
 
10 
 Even though a subject has withdrawn from the study, it may be important to collect some follow-up or survival 
data on subjects throughout the protocol defined follow-up period. Such data are important to the integrity of the final s tudy analysis since early withdrawal could be related to the saf ety profile of the study drug. If a 
subject withdraws cons ent to participate in the study  for subject safety reasons  attempts will be made to obtain 
permission to collect follow up information  whenever possible. Patients will be analyzed by intention to treat 
principles without some of the follow- up data as necessary.  
5 Study Drug  
5.1 Description  
 
1. PRP – Autologous  Platelet Rich Plasma isolated from blood collected from each patient at each 
treatment time point.   
 
2. Minoxidill 5% Topical Foam  - Manufacturers Description: Indications: To regrow hair on top of the 
scalp.  Active Ingredient: Minox idil 5% w/w (without propellant) Inactive Ingredients: butane, butylated 
hydroxytoluene, cetyl alcohol, citric acid, glycerin, isobutane, lactic acid, polysorbate 60, propane, purified water, SD alcohol 40-B, stearyl alcohol (Rogaine for Women). 
5.2 Treatment Regi men 
 
Patients will b e randomized into a PRP then MNX (Arm A) or MNX  then PRP group ( Arm B ). Patients 
randomized to Arm A will receive injections of PRP using the nappage technique ( Sivagnanam ) every 4  weeks 
for a total of 3 treatments  over 12 weeks . Patients will then have a 2 month (8 week) washout period lasting 
until the end of month 4. Starting on month 5 they will receive crossover treatment with Minoxidil by applying 
the 5% foam once daily following manufacture instructions (Rogaine For Women) for a total of 3 months after 
which they will be followed until 1 year  after enrollment. Patients randomized to Arm B will apply Minoxidil 
topical foam once daily following manufacture instructions for a total of 3 months followed by a two month (8 
week) washout period. At the 5 month mark, the patients in Arm B will receive crossover treatment with PRP 
harvested and administered in the same manner as the patients in  Arm A.  At the end of the PRP treatment 
patients in Arm B will be followed until 1 year afte r enrollment.  
5.3 Method for Assigning Subjects to Treatment Groups  
 Assignment of treatments will be randomized using dynamic allocation .  
5.4 Preparation and Administration of Study Drug  
 PRP will be harvested and prepared in the Mayo Jacksonville Dermatology practice.  20 mLs of blood will be collected from patients using standard venipuncture technique.  Collected blood will be processed using a 
standard dual spin centrifugation protocol resulting in approximately 10.5 mLs  of PRP.   The 10 cc of PRP will 
be injected with a 30 -gauge needle using the nappage technique (Sivagnanam ) over the affected part of the 
scalp, approxim ately 1/10 cc / injection site.  At the investigators discretion scalp may be numbed with 
Gebauer’s Pain Ease Nonflammable Medium Stream Spray Instant Topical Anesthetic or Impax Lisocaine and 
Prilocaine Cream, USP 2.5%.  The remaining 0.5 mL of PRP will be collected for future research purposes.

 7 Statistical Plan  
7.1 Sample Size Determination  
 
A total of 2 3 patients  will be enrolled in this study.  This sample size will be sufficient in order to gain valuable 
data to be used in the design of a future, larger study. Given the pilot/feasibility nature of the study, no formal 
power calculations were performed.  
 
7.2 Statistical Methods  
 
Data Analysis – Give n the design, all statistical analysis will be focused on the difference in outcomes, and 
differences in outcomes compared to baseline, for each treatment within individual patients. For continuous or 
ordinal outcome variables, we will use a Wilcoxon signed rank test for comparison of outcomes between PRP 
and Minoxidil , while for categorical outcome variables we will use  McNemar’s exact test for these . Continuous 
outcome measures will be summarized using the sample mean, standard deviation, median, minimum,  25th and 
75th percentiles, and maximum. Categorical variables will be summarized with number and percentage. 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) will be  estimated where appropriate. P-values of 0.05 or less will be considered as 
statistically significant, however the results of these tests will be interpreted with the low power of this pilot study in mind; more emphasis will be placed on graphical and descriptive summaries than on the results of statistical tests. No adjustment for multiple testing will be made  owing to the exploratory, pilot nature of the 
study. Given the prospective nature of the study, we expect to encounter little if any missing data. However in the event of missing data, no attempt to impute this missing data will be made in this pilot study; missing data will be treated as missing.  
 
Descriptive Statistics  
 
We will summarize continuous variables using the sample mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, 25th 
and 75th percentiles, and maximum. We will summarize categorical variables with number and percentages. Ordinal variables will be summarized using the s ample median, minimum, 25th and 75th percentiles, and 
maximum, as well as with number and percentage.  
 
Handling of Missing Data  
Given the prospective nature of the study, we expect to encounter little if any missing data. However in the 
event of missing data, no attempt to impute this missing data will be made in this pilot study; missing data will 
be treated as missing.  
 
Multiplicity  
 
No adjustment for multiple testing will be made owing to the exploratory, pilot nature of the study. P -value of 
0.05 or l ess will be considered as statistically significant.  
 
Primary Hypothesis: 
 
We hypothesize that PRP administration for AGA will be safe and without significant complications for the 
patient.  AGA will be comparable in efficacy or superior to  conventional tr eatment with MNX. 
 
14 
 The primary endpoints of the study, occurrence of adverse reactions and morbidity, are both dichotomous 
categorical variables. As such, the proporti on for which these outcomes occur will be estimated along with 95% 
CIs. These proportions will be compared between treatments  using McNemar’s exact test  
  
Interim Analysis  
 
No interim analysis  will be performed in this pilot study.  
 
7.3 Subject Population(s) for Analysis  
All-treated population:  Any subject randomized into the study that received study drug.  
 
 
8 Safety and Adverse Events  
8.1 Definitions  
 
Unanticipated Problems Involving Risk to Subjects or Others (UPIRTSO)  
Any unanticipated problem or adverse event that meets the following three criteria:  
• Serious : Serious problems or events that result s in significant harm, (which may be physical, 
psychological, financial, social, economic, or legal) or increased risk for the subject or others (including 
individuals who are not research subjects). These include: (1) death; (2) life threatening adverse experience; (3) hospitalization - inpatient, new, or prolonged; (4) disability/incapacity - persistent or 
significant; (5) birth defect/anomaly; (6) breach of confidentiality and (7) other problems, events, or new information (i.e. publications, DSMB reports, interim findings, product labeling change) that in the opinion of the local investigator may adversely affect the rights, safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromise the research data, AND  
• Unanticipated : (i.e. , unexpected) problems or events are those that are not already described as potential 
risks in the protocol, consent document, not listed in the Investigator’s Brochure, or not part of an underlying disease. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it wa s unforeseeable at the time of its 
occurrence. A problem or event is "unanticipated" when it occurs at an increased frequency or at an increased severity than expected, AND  
• Related: A problem or event is "related" if it is possibly related to the research procedures.  
  
Adverse Event  
 
An untoward or undesirable experience associated with the use of a medical product (i.e. drug, device, biologic) 
in a patient or research subject.  
 
   
Serious Adverse Event  
15 
  
Adverse events are classified as serious or non -serious.  Serious problems/events can be well defined and 
include; 
• death  
• life threatening adverse experience  
• hospitalization  
• inpatient, new, or prolonged; disability/incapacity 
• persistent or significant birth  defect/anomaly  
 
or other events that in the opinion of the sponsor -investigator may have adversely affected the rights, 
safety, or welfare of the subjects or others, or substantially compromised the research data.  
 All adverse events that do not meet any of the criteria for serious, should be regarded as non- serious adverse 
events .  
 
Adverse Event Reporting Period  
For this study, the study treatment follow -up period is 12 months  after enrollment. T he adverse event 
monitoring period will end at th e end of the follow -up period. If an event is reported after this time it would not 
be considered study related.  
 Preexisting Condition 
A preexisting condition is one that is present at the start of the study.  A preexisting condition should be 
recorded as  an adverse event if the frequency, intensity, or the character of the condition worsens during the 
study period.  
General Physical Examination Findings 
At screening, any clinically significant abnormality should be recorded as a preexisting condition.  At  the end of 
the study, any new clinically significant findings/abnormalities that meet the definition of an adverse event must 
also be recorded and documented as an adverse event.  
 
Post-study Adverse Event  
All unresolved adverse events should be followed by the sponsor -investigator until the events are resolved, the 
subject is lost to follow -up, or the adverse event is otherwise explained.  At the last scheduled visit, the sponsor -
investigator should instruct each subject to report, to the sponsor -investig ator, any subsequent event(s) that the 
subject, or the subject’s personal physician, believes might reasonably be related to participation in this study.   
Abnormal Laboratory Values 
A clinical laboratory abnormality should be documented as an adverse event if it was exhibited as a severe 
reaction i.e. swelling, that required hospitalization or additional clinical intervention.   
 
Hospitalization, Prolonged Hospitalization or Surgery 
Any adverse event that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and 
reported as a serious adverse event unless specifically instructed otherwise in this protocol.  Any condition 
responsible for surgery should be documente d as an adverse event if the condition meets the criteria for an 
adverse event.   
  
Neither the condition, hospitalization, prolonged hospitalization, nor surgery are reported as an adverse event in 
the following circumstances:  
16 
 • Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective surgical procedures for a 
preexisting condition.  Surgery should not  be reported as an outcome of an adverse event if the purpose 
of the surgery was elective or diagnostic and the outcome was uneventful. 
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow efficacy measurement for the study. 
• Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for therapy of the target disease of the study, unless it is a 
worsening or increase in frequency of hospital admissions as judged by the clinical investigator.  
 
8.2 Recording of Adverse Events  
All adverse events will be documented as required under  21 CFR part 1271. Depending on the nature and 
seriousness of the adverse reaction, the IRB will be notified according to the Mayo Clinic IRB policy. If An 
SAE occurs it will also be reported to the FDA as per regulations  At each contact with the subject,  the study team must seek information on adverse events by specific 
questioning and, as appropriate, by examination.  Information on all adverse events should be recorded immediately in the source document, and also in the appropriate adverse event section of the case report form 
(CRF) or separate worksheet.  All clearly related signs, symptoms, and abnormal diagnostic, laboratory or procedure results should recorded in the source document.  All adverse events occurring during the study period must be recor ded.  The clinical course of each event 
should be followed until resolution, stabilization, or until it has been ultimately determined that the study treatment or participation is not the probable cause.  Serious adverse events that are still ongoing at the end of the study period must be followed up, to determine the final outcome.  
8.3 Reporting of Serious Adverse Events and Unanticipated Problems  
When an adverse event has been identified, the study team will take appropriated action necessary to protect the 
study participant and then complete the Study Adverse Event Worksheet and/or log.  The sponsor -investigator 
will evaluate the event and determine the necessary follow -up and reporting required. 
 
8.3.1 Sponsor -Investigator reporting: notifying the Mayo IRB 
The sp onsor- investigator will report to the Mayo IRB any UPIRTSOs and Non- UPIRTSOs according to the 
Mayo IRB Policy and Procedures. 8.4 Stopping Rules  
Study enrollment and treatment procedures will be suspended in the event that 3 successive subjects experience 
a Serious Adverse Event within the first 3 months after treatment.  The study would only be resumed after a 
thorough review of the incidents and any corrective and preventative actions have been put in place along with consultation between the study team and the IRB.  
8.5 Medical Monitoring  
It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator to oversee the safety of the study at his/her site.  This safety monitoring will include careful assessment and appropriate reporting of adverse events as noted above, as w ell 
as the construction and implementation of a site data and safety -monitoring plan (see section 10  “Study 
Monitoring, Auditing, and Inspecting”).  Medical monitoring will include a regular assessment of the number and type of serious adverse events.

 9 Data Handling and Record Keeping  
9.1 Data Handling 
Data will be collected and entered by the study coordinator  assigned to the project, and stored into a REDCap 
database.  
9.2 Confidentiality  
Information about study subjects will be kept confidential and managed according to the requirements of the 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA).  Those regulations require a signed subject authorization informing the subject of the following:  
• What protected health information (PHI) will be collected from subjects in this study 
• Who will have access to that information and why 
• Who will use or disclose that information  
• The rights of a research subject to revoke their authorization for use of their PHI.  
In the event that a subject revokes authorization to collect or use PHI, the investigator, by regulation, retains the ability to use all information collected prior to the revocation of subject authorization.  For subjects that have revoked authorization to collect or use PHI, attempts should be made to  obtain permission to collect at least 
vital status (long term survival status that the subject is alive) at the end of their scheduled study period.  
 Hard copy data such as consent forms will be stored in locked file cabinets; electronic data will be stored in secure web -based database (REDCap) that will be designed with the help of the statistician.  
9.3 Source Documents  
Source data are  all information, original records of clinical findings, observations, or other activities in a clinical 
trial necessary for the reconstruction and evaluation of the trial.  Source data are contained in source documents.  Examples of these original documents, and data records include: hospital records, clinical and office charts, laboratory notes, memoranda, subjects’ diaries or  evaluation checklists, pharmacy dispensing records, recorded 
data from automated instruments, copies or transcriptions certified after verification as being accurate and complete, microfiches, photographic negatives, microfilm or magnetic media, x -rays, s ubject files, and records 
kept at the pharmacy, at the laboratories, and at medico- technical departments involved in the clinical trial.  
 
Data Management 
Study data will be managed in a study specific REDCap system  
 
Data Security and Confidentiality  
 
The REDCap system has built in systems for control of access, data integrity and audit trails. Access and 
confidentiality are controlled in a manner similar to other institutional systems.  
9.4 Records Retention  
The sponsor -investigator will maintain records and essential documents related to the conduct of the study.  
These will include subject case histories and regulatory documents.  The sponsor-investigator will retain the specified records and reports for whichever is longer ; 
1. Up to 2 years after the marketing application is approved for the drug; or, if a marketing application is 
not submitted or approved for the drug, until 2 years after shipment and delivery of the drug for investigational use is discontinued and the FDA has been so notified. OR  
 
2. As outlined in the Mayo  Clinic Research Policy Manual “Access to  and Retention of Research Data 
Policy” http://mayocontent.mayo.edu/research-policy/MSS_669717

 10 Study Monitoring, Auditing, and Insp ecting  
10.1 Study Monitoring Plan 
The investigator will allocate adequate time for such monitoring activities.  The Investigator will also ensure 
that the monitor or other compliance or quality assurance reviewer is given access to all the study -related 
documents and study related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.), and has adequate space to conduct the monitoring visit.  The study specific DSMP will be submitted to the IRB as a separate document in the IRB application.  
 This study will be monitored on a routine basis during the conduct of the trial.  The Mayo Clinic Office of Research Regulatory Support will assist in coordination of the clinical monitoring for the trial as a service for the sponsor -investigator.  Clinical trial monitoring r equires review of the study data generated throughout the 
duration of the study to ensure the validity and integrity of the data along with the protection of human research subjects.  This will assist sponsor-investigators in complying with Food and Drug A dministration regulations.  
10.2 Auditing and Inspecting  
The investigator will permit study -related monitoring, audits, and inspections by the IRB, the sponsor, and 
government regulatory agencies, of all study related documents (e.g. source documents, regulatory  documents, 
data collection instruments, study data etc.).  The investigator will ensure the capability for inspections of applicable study -related facilities (e.g. pharmacy, diagnostic laboratory, etc.).  
 Participation as an investigator in this study imp lies acceptance of potential inspection by government 
regulatory authorities and applicable compliance offices.  
11 Ethical Considerations  
This study is to be conducted according to United States government regulations and Institutional research policies and procedures.  This protocol and any amendments will be submitted to a properly constituted local Institutional Review Board (IRB), in agreement with local legal prescriptions, for formal approval of the study.  The decision of the IRB concerning the conduct of the study will be made in writing to the sponsor -investigator before commencement 
of this study.  All subjects for this study will be provided a consent form describing this study and providing sufficient information for subjects to make an informed decision about their participation in this study.  This consent form will be submitted with the protocol for review and approval by the IRB for the study.  The formal consent of a subject, using the Approved IRB consent form, must be obtained before that subject undergoes any study procedure.  The consent form must be signed by the subject or the subject’s legally authorized representative, and the individual obtaining the informed consent.

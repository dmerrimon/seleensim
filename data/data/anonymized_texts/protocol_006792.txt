Page 3 PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Title:   
A clinical study of patients with symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension to assess 
sustained effects of droxidopa therapy  
Indication:  
Symptomatic neurogenic  orthostatic hypotension (NOH) in patients with Primary Autonomic 
Failure [Parkinson’s Disease (PD), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA) or Pure Autonomic Failure 
(PAF)], or Non -Diabetic Autonomic Neuropathy (NDAN) or Dopamine Beta Hydroxylase (DBH) 
deficiency.  
Rationale:  
Symptomatic NOH in patients is thought to be a consequence of norepinephrine (NE) 
neurotransmission dysfunction, leading to low systolic blood pressure (SBP) and cerebral 
hypoperfusion. Therapy with droxidopa results in increased levels of NE wh ich should lead to 
improved SBP and cerebral perfusion thereby reducing the signs and symptoms of NOH.   
Droxidopa was approved in the US for the treatment of orthostatic dizziness,   light-headedness or 
the “feeling that you are about to black out” in pati ents with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic 
NOH due to Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, non -diabetic 
autonomic neuropathy, or dopamine -β-hydroxylase deficiency. Effectiveness was established in 
short -term ( ≤ 2 week) s tudies; effectiveness longer than 2 weeks has not yet been demonstrated.  
This long -term study will evaluate the durability of the clinical benefit in NOH patients treated 
with droxidopa in a randomized withdrawal design (time to treatment intervention stu dy). 
Objectives:  
Primary  objective :  
• To evaluate the time to treatment intervention in patients with PD, MSA, PAF, NDAN or 
DBH Deficiency  who have been previously stabilized with droxidopa therapy for 
symptoms of NOH (dizziness, light -headedness, or feelin gs that they are about to black 
out) 
Secondary objectives:  
• To evaluate the long -term efficacy of droxidopa in patients with symptomatic NOH 
measured by  
o Discontinuation for any reason ( all cause discontinuation ) 
o Composite Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ) scores  
o Clinicians’ and patients’ clinical global impression of severity (CGI -S)

Protocol: Version 7.0 –18 March 2021  
Lundbeck NA, Ltd. – Confidential  
Page 7 Investigational Medicinal Product and Formulation:  
Droxidopa (also known as L -threo -3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine, or L -DOPS) in 100, 200, and 300 
mg capsules  
Placebo capsules (to match droxidopa 100, 200, and 300 mg capsule s) 
Dosage and Administration:  
During the Titration Period (Visits 2a -2f) and Open -Label Period (Visits 3 -5), patients will receive 
100, 200, 300, 400, 500, or 600 mg TID of droxidopa, orally.  
The droxidopa starting dose for all eligible patients in the Ti tration Period is 100 mg TID. Doses 
will be titrated in 100 mg TID increments until the optimal dose is achieved. Four dose changes 
are permitted within the first two months of the Open -Label Period. No dose changes are allowed 
after Visit 5.  
Randomized p atients will receive 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, or 600 mg TID of droxidopa or 
matching placebo (equal to their dose at the end of the Open -Label Period), orally at 
Randomization (Visit 6) and during the Double -Blind Period (Visits 7 -12). No dose changes are 
permitted during the Double -Blind Period.  
Statistical Analysis:  
Sample Size Determination:  
The sample size and power calculations are based on the analysis of time to intervention in the 
Double -Blind Period.  
It is anticipated that event rates will be 0.15  for the droxidopa group and 0.25 for the placebo 
group 12 weeks post randomization. Assuming these event rates and a hazard ratio of 0.56 in 
favor of droxidopa, a 240 -subject sample size would be expected to result in 48 events, providing 
~51% power to de tect a difference between droxidopa and placebo.  A blinded review conducted  
in July 2020 indicated that the event rate may be higher than originally assumed  and, if accurate , 
will resul t in a substantially higher power than 51% .  In addition, the study will contribute to the 
totality of results for the post -marketing requirement (PMR) evaluation, which justifies the 
reduced power given the circumstances.   
 Primary Efficacy Endpoint:  
Time -to-intervention.   Need for intervention is defined as meeting ANY of the following criteria 
during the Double -Blind Period : 
• OHSA Item #1 ≥2 unit worsening from Randomization (Visit 6) AND lack of efficacy as 
judged by the investigator; OR

Page 8 • OHSA Item #1 ≥2 unit worsening from Randomization (Visit 6) at 2 consecutive visits ; 
OR 
• OHSA Item #1 ≥2 unit worsening from Randomization (Visit 6) at the visit before early 
discontinuation; OR  
• Patient stops IMP or withdraws from study for patient -reported lack of efficacy  
The timing of the need for intervention in the above criteria is defined as the first occurrence of a 
worsening of OHSA Item #1 by ≥ 2 units or when the patient stops taking IMP or withdraws due 
to a patient -reported lack of efficacy. Patients who withdraw  without meeting criteria for treatment 
intervention will be censored at the time of withdrawal; patients who do not meet criteria for 
treatment intervention at the end of the Double -Blind Period (Visit 12) will be censored at the time 
of study completion.   
 
The primary endpoint will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier method. The primary analysis is 
the log -rank test to compare the two treatment groups. In addition, the Cox regression model will 
be used to estimate the hazard ratio.  Furthermore, the followin g sensitivity analyses using the 
same approach will be conducted:  
• Time -to-intervention defined as the criteria specified above; or OHSA Item #1 ≥2 unit  
worsening from Randomization (Visit 6) at the last visit of the Double -Blind Period (Visit 
12). 
• Cox regr ession analysis of time to intervention based on various definitions above.  
Secondary Endpoints: The Key Secondary Endpoint  
Time to all cause discontinuation is the key secondary endpoint.  
A gate keeping strategy will be applied in the testing of this key  secondary endpoint. That is, the 
Log-rank test of this secondary endpoint will be performed at the nominal alpha level of 2 -sided 
0.05 only if the primary endpoint reaches statistical significance in the primary analysis. This 
strategy ensures the overall  type 1 error rate is preserved.  
Other Secondary Endpoints:  
Efficacy measures of droxidopa versus placebo:  
• Mean change in OHSA Item #1 score from Randomization (Visit 6) to all post -
Randomization visits  
• Mean change in Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ) composite score from 
Randomization (Visit 6) to all post -Randomization visits (Visits 7 -12) 
• Clinician -rated CGI -S at all post -Randomization visits (Visits 7 -12) 
• Patient -rated CGI -S at all post -Randomization visits (Visits 7 -12) 
• Proportion  of patients who need intervention over the 12 -week Double -Blind Treatment 
period

Page 19 1.  INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Symptomatic Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension  
Symptomatic neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (NOH) in patients is thought to be a consequence 
of norepinephrine neurotransmission dysfunction, leading to low systolic blood pres sure (SBP) 
and cerebral hypoperfusion.  SBP is transiently and minimally decreased in healthy individuals 
upon standing.  Normal physiologic feedback mechanisms work through neurally -mediated 
pathways to maintain the standing blood pressure (BP), and thus maintain adequate cerebral 
perfusion.  The compensatory mechanisms that regulate BP upon standing are dysfunctional in 
patients with symptomatic NOH, a condition that may lead to inadequate cerebral perfusion with 
accompanying symptoms of syncope, dizzines s or lightheadedness, unsteadiness and blurred or 
impaired vision, among other symptoms.  Symptomatic NOH may be a severely disabling 
condition which can seriously interfere with the quality of life of afflicted patients.   
Many of the currently available therapeutic options provide some symptomatic relief in a subset 
of patients, but are relatively ineffective and are often accompanied by severe side effects that limit 
their usefulness.  Support garments (e.g., tight -fitting leotards) may prove useful in s ome patients, 
but are difficult to don without family or nursing assistance, especially for older patients.  
Midodrine, fludrocortisone, methylphenidate, ephedrine, indomethacin and dihydroergotamine are 
some of the pharmacological interventions that have been used to treat orthostatic hypotension 
(OH), although, of these medications, only midodrine is specifically approved for this indication.   
The only other medication approved for this indication is droxidopa.  Therapy with droxidopa has 
been shown to r esult in increased levels of norepinephrine (NE) which leads to improved SBP and 
cerebral perfusion thereby reducing the signs and symptoms of symptomatic NOH.  As of 2014, 
droxidopa has been approved in the United States (US) for the treatment of orthosta tic 
dizziness,   light-headedness or the “feeling that you are about to black out” in patients with a 
clinical diagnosis of symptomatic NOH due to Parkinson’s disease (PD), multiple system atrophy 
(MSA), pure autonomic failure (PAF), non -diabetic autonomic neuropathy (NDAN), or dopamine -
β-hydroxylase (DBH) deficiency. Effectiveness was established in short -term studies and efficacy 
beyond two weeks has not yet been demonstrated.  This long -term study will evaluate the durability 
of the clinical benefit in pa tients with symptomatic NOH treated with droxidopa.  
1.2 Background  
1.2.1 Droxidopa  
Droxidopa [also, known as L -threo -3,4-dihydroxyphenylserine, or L -DOPS] is the International 
Non-proprietary Name (INN) for a synthetic amino acid precursor of NE, which was original ly 
developed by Sumitomo Dainippon Pharmaceuticals Co., Limited, Japan (SDP). It has been 
approved for use in Japan since 1989 and in the United States (US) since February 2014. 
Droxidopa has been shown to improve symptoms of orthostatic hypotension that r esult from a

Page 20 variety of conditions including Shy -Drager syndrome (Multiple System Atrophy), Pure 
Autonomic Failure (PAF), and Parkinson’s disease (PD). There are four stereoisomers of L -DOPS; 
however, only the L -threo -enantiomer (droxidopa) is biologically  active.   
1.2.2 Pharmacology  
Droxidopa is decarboxylated by 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine  (DOPA) decarboxylase (DDC), and 
is directly converted to NE (see  Figure 1 ). 
Figure 1: Biosynthesis of Norepinephrine from Droxidopa  
 
The exact mechanism of action of droxidopa in the treatment of symptomatic NOH has not been 
precisely defined; however, its NE replenishing properties with concomitant recovery of decreased 
noradrenergic activity are considered to be of major importance.  
1.2.3 Pre-clinica l studies with Droxidopa  
Numerous studies in animal models support central and peripheral mechanisms of action of 
droxidopa. Central nervous system (CNS) studies have shown the ability of droxidopa to increase 
the content of NE and 3 -methoxy -4-hydroxy -phenylglycol (MHPG), the main metabolite of NE, 
in the brain of normal animals.  Droxidopa also replenished the levels of NE in the brain of NE -

Page 21 depleted animals. These results suggest that droxidopa acts as a NE precursor in the CNS.  
Droxidopa also increases  the release of NE from nerve endings in experiments using brain 
synaptosomes and slices.  
Studies of the peripheral action of droxidopa show that droxidopa increased heart rate (HR) and 
elevated BP.  Inhibitors of DDC and -adrenoceptors blocked this effec t, which suggests that these 
changes can be attributed to peripheral conversion of droxidopa to NE rather than a direct action 
of droxidopa itself.  Droxidopa inhibited the fall in BP associated with orthostatic changes, and 
accelerated the recovery from l ow BP in rats whose sympathetic nerves were chemically 
destroyed.  The efficacy of droxidopa in OH is, therefore, thought to be the result of a 
compensatory increase in the overall BP or a possible improvement in the BP reflex process.  
Further details of p reclinical studies with droxidopa are provided in the Package Insert (PI).  
1.2.4 Clinical studies with Droxidopa  
To date, Lundbeck NA, Ltd. (Lundbeck; formerly Chelsea Therapeutics, Inc.) has completed three 
placebo -controlled Phase III studies and two long -term extension Phase III studies with droxidopa 
in patients with NOH.  Lundbeck has also sponsored a fed/fast pharmacokinetic (PK) study with 
healthy volunteers (NOH101), a bioequivalence study in healthy volunteers (NOH104), a 24 -hour 
BP monitoring study (NOH 305) and a dedicated thorough QTc study (NOH102).   
1.2.5 Efficacy Profile  
To date, Lundbeck has completed three Phase III studies of droxidopa for the treatment of 
symptomatic NOH:  
• A multi -center, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, 
induction -design study using the OHQ  composite score as the prospectively -defined 
primary outcome variable to assess the clinical effect of droxidopa in patients with 
symptomatic NOH and PD, MSA, PAF, DBH Deficiency, or NDAN (Study  NOH301)   
• A multi -center, double -blind, randomized, placebo -controlled, parallel -group, withdrawal -
design study using the Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment   (OHSA ) Item 1 
(dizziness) as the prospectively -defined primary outcome variable and the OHQ composite 
score as a post-hoc analysis  to assess the clinical effect of droxidopa in patients with 
symptomatic NOH and PD, MSA, PAF, DBH Deficiency, or NDAN and to study 
population PK/Pharmacodynamic parameters (Study  NOH302)  
• A multi -center, double -blind, randomized, parallel -group, placebo -controlled study to 
assess the clinical effect of droxidopa in the treatment of symptomatic NOH in patients 
with PD (Study NOH306)

Page 22 Lundbeck has also completed two Phase III, multi -center long -term open -label extension studies 
with droxidopa in patients with symptomatic NOH and PD, MSA, PAF, DBH Deficiency, or 
NDAN (Studies NOH303 and NOH304).  
In addition, numerous other studies have also shown droxidopa to be effective in the improvement 
of OH symptoms in PD patients ( Birkmayer et al., 1983, Narabayashi et al., 1987, Yanagisawa et 
al., 1998), and in patients with PD or MSA (Sumitomo Pharmaceuticals Europe Limited CSR 
S10002, 2002).   
The collective data from Lundbeck’s clinical development program (further details of which are 
provided in the PI) demonstrate that treatment with droxidopa results in clinically meaningful 
improvements in the symptoms of NOH, including dizziness/light -headedness, vision, weakness, 
fatigue, trouble concentrating, head/neck discomfort, and their impact on patients’ ability to 
perform daily activities that require standing or walking. Treatment with droxidopa also results in 
significant increases in standing BP in patients with NOH. These increases in BP were generally 
similar when standing compared to when supine.   
Based on the results of Lundbeck’s clinical program, droxidopa was approved in the US in 2014 
for, “the treatment of orthostatic dizziness,  light-headedness or the “feeling that you are about to 
black out” in patients with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic NOH due to Parkinson’s disease, 
multiple system atrophy, pure autonomic failure, non -diabetic autonomic neuropathy, or 
dopamine -β-hydroxylase deficiency.”  However, durable clinical benefits with chronic use beyond 
2 weeks have not been demonstrated.   
1.2.6 Safety Profile  
The collective data from Lundbeck’s clinical development program demonstrate that droxidopa is 
safe and well tolerated in patients  with symptomatic NOH associated with primary autonomic 
failure (PD, MSA and PAF), DBH Deficiency, or NDAN.  Data from this program indicates that 
droxidopa treatment is associated with a small increase in supine hypertension (SBP >180  mmHg), 
and an increa se in the incidence of headaches, dizziness, and nausea.  Data from the 
SDP-sponsored clinical studies conducted in Europe and the large safety database of patients 
treated in Japan, where droxidopa has been marketed for over 20 years, further support the safety 
of droxidopa.  For further information on the safety of droxidopa, refer to the PI.  
1.3 Study Rationale  
Symptomatic NOH in patients is thought to be a consequence of NE neurotransmission 
dysfunction, leading to low SBP and cerebral hypoperfusion. Therapy with droxidopa results in 
increased levels of NE which leads to improved SBP and cerebral perfusion, ther eby reducing the 
signs and symptoms of symptomatic NOH.

Page 23 Droxidopa was approved in the US for the treatment of orthostatic dizziness,  light-headedness or 
the “feeling that you are about to black out” in patients with a clinical diagnosis of symptomatic 
NOH due to PD, MSA, PAF, NDAN, or DBH deficiency. Effectiveness was established in short -
term studies.  This long -term study will evaluate the durability of the clinical benefit in patients 
with symptomatic NOH treated with droxidopa in a randomized withdraw al design (time to 
intervention study).  
1.3.1 Selection of Droxidopa Dose and Schedule of Administration  
Single rising doses of droxidopa (100, 300, 600, and 900  milligrams ( mg)) have been shown to be 
well tolerated in healthy male Japanese and Caucasian volunte ers.  Droxidopa pharmacokinetics 
are roughly linear, but less than dose -proportional, for single doses between 100 and 2000  mg.  
The upper limit of individual doses for this study will not exceed 600  mg TID (1800  mg/day).  
In Japan, the recommended dosing r egimen for NOH -associated indications is to administer the 
daily maintenance dose of droxidopa in divided doses three times a day. Pharmacokinetic 
modeling based on Phase I data in healthy volunteers indicate no accumulation of droxidopa with 
multiple dose s of 100 mg or 300 mg administered three times per day.  Importantly, the reduced 
fluctuation in droxidopa plasma levels expected with three times a day dosing may help to maintain 
a therapeutic effect in NOH patients throughout the day, by maintaining a t hreshold NE level for 
beneficial pressor effects.  Maintenance of plasma plateau drug levels is supported by divided daily 
doses, especially for a drug like droxidopa, which has a half -life of approximately 1.5 hours in 
humans.   Increased dosing frequency  is also supported by the findings of Kachi  et al. (1988), who 
demonstrated decreased muscle sympathetic activity and reoccurrence of OH symptoms in a Shy -
Drager patient 3 hours post -dosing of droxidopa despite concomitant peak NE levels, suggesting 
a shor ter duration of action than what might be predicted from plasma NE concentrations.  Lower 
peak plasma concentrations provided by split daily dosing should augment the drug’s safety by 
reducing the incidence of any peak concentration -related side effects.   
Lundbeck has conducted studies of droxidopa in more than 650 patients with pure autonomic 
failure (PAF) associated with symptomatic NOH and demonstrated that individually optimized 
doses from 100 to 600 mg TID are safe and effective for the treatment of s ymptomatic NOH 
associated dizziness or lightheadedness.  
The present study will utilize an open -label dose titration, during which patients are titrated on 
droxidopa, based on efficacy and tolerability as assessed by OHSA Item #1, BP measurements and 
advers e events (AEs).  The individual visits within the open -label dose titration period do not have 
fixed visit windows.  Investigators should tailor the titration schedule based on individual patients’ 
response to therapy and their own clinical judgment.  Pati ents should be up -titrated until they reach 
600mg TID or until a safety or tolerability concern prevent further up -titration.  The entire dose -
titration period will last for up to 4 weeks from the date of the initial titration visit (Visit 2a).  The 
initia l dose will be 100 mg TID, and increase in 100 mg TID steps to a maximum dose of 600 mg

Page 24 TID.  Once the optimized dose has been identified, patients will then enter a 12 -week open -label 
dose treatment period, followed by a 12 -week, double -blind, randomized withdrawal period on 
their individualized dose of  investigational medicinal product  (IMP). Doses are to be timed such 
that the first dose is taken upon waking and then taken approximately every 4 hours thereafter, 
with the final dose taken early enough (la te afternoon) to minimize drug effects during night -time 
sleeping hours.  
1.3.2 Selection of Primary Efficacy Endpoint  
Time -to-intervention is the primary endpoint.   Since it is predomi nantly based on the OHSA Item 
#1 score, it is believed that the time-to-intervention endpoint requires corroboration to ensure that 
worsening OHSA  Item # 1 scores represent a true event . The criteria  below  represent a balanced 
approach to identify true events requiring treatment intervention . 
During the Double -Blind Per iod, eligible patients will be randomized 1:1 to either their stable 
regimen of droxidopa or matching placebo. Patients will be withdrawn from the study if they 
require treatment intervention for their NOH symptoms, defined by meeting ANY of the following 
criteria:   
1. OHSA Item #1 ≥ 2 unit worsening from Randomization (Visit 6) AND lack of efficacy as 
judged by the Investigator; OR  
2. OHSA Item #1 ≥ 2 unit worsening from Randomization (Visit 6) at 2 consecutive 
visits ;OR 
3. OHSA Item #1 ≥  2 unit worsening from Randomization (Visit 6) at the visit before early 
discontinuation; OR  
4. Patient stops IMP or withdraws from study for patient -reported lack of efficacy  
Time -to-intervention measures clinically relevant deterioration of the patient’s NOH symptoms. 
Importantl y, patients are not required to remain on ineffective treatment. Patients will be 
withdrawn from the study if treatment fails.  
The criteria for treatment intervention are predominantly based on the OHSA  Item # 1 score. This 
instrument has both strengths and limitations. One limitation is that it is has high variability. 
Conditions such as poor hydration and diarrhea can cause worsening of OHSA  Item # 1 scores 
independent of treatment effects. Therefore, the time -to-intervention endpoint requires 
corroborat ion to ensure that worsening OHSA  Item # 1 scores represents a tru e event . Investigator 
judgment is one way, but not the only way, to corroborate worsening of dizziness symptoms. Thus:  
• If a patient has worsening OHSA  Item # 1 at any one visit and the invest igator agrees that 
the worsening condition represents a treatment failure, then the patient is considered a 
treatment failure. If, however, the investigator does not consider the worsening OHSA  
Item # 1 score at any one visit to be a true treatment failure,  then the patient will continue

care is optimized and any other medical conditions are treated appropriately.  
• If the patient continues to have worsening OHSA  Item # 1 at the second consecutive clinic 
visit, then the patient is considered a treatment failure. This criterion is independent of 
investigator judgment.  
• If the patient fails to return to the clinic after a visit with a worsened OHSA  Item # 1 
score, the patien t is considered a treatment failure by definition. This criterion is 
independent of investigator judgment.  
• Also, a patient who stops study drug or withdraws from the study for patient -reported 
loss of efficacy is also a treatment failure. This criterion i s also independent of 
investigator judgment.  
Altogether, these criteria represent a balanced approach in an attempt to identify true events of 
treatment failure.  
2. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
The study is designed to evaluate the clinical efficacy and safety of droxidopa versus placebo over 
a 12-week double -blind treatment period in patients with symptomatic NOH who have previously 
received up to 16  weeks of open -label treatment with an individually optimized dose of droxidopa 
(randomized withdrawal design).  
• Primary objective:  
o To evaluate the time to treatment intervention in patients with PD, MSA, PAF, 
NDAN or DBH Deficiency  who have been previously stabilized with droxidopa 
therapy for symptoms of NOH (dizziness, light -headedness, or feeling that they are 
about  to black out)  
 
• Secondary objectives:  
o To evaluate the long -term efficacy of droxidopa in patients with symptomatic NOH 
measured by  
▪ Discontinuation for any reason ( all cause discontinuation ) 
▪ Composite OHQ scores  
▪ Clinicians’ and patients’ clinical global im pression of severity (CGI -S) 
▪ To evaluate  the long -term safety and tolerability of droxidopa in patients 
with symptomatic NOH.  
3. STUDY METHODS

Screening laboratory test results and ECG reports must be reviewed and assessed by the 
Investigator or designee prior to the initial Titration Visit (Visit 2a).  
3.5.1.1  Patients who are taking prescribed droxidopa therapy  
Patients who are taking prescribed droxidopa therapy are eligible to participate in the study if they 
meet the additional inclusion criteria for this patient subgroup (see Section 3.4.1.1) in addition to 
all other inclusion / exclusion criteria. Discontinuation of prescribed droxidopa should not occur 
prior to signing the informed consent. It is permitted, based on the Investigator ’s judgment, for 
patients to continue their prescribed droxidopa therapy while eligibility is being assessed in the 
screening period. However, it is required that patients discontinue droxidopa for at least 3 days 
before entering the Open Label Dose Titration Period  at Vis it 2a.  
Eligible patients will begin the Titration Period at 100 mg TID. Study procedures will be the 
same as patients who have not previously been prescribed droxidopa.  
3.5.1.2  Re-Screening of patients  
Patients who Screen Fail may be re -screened at a later date i f, in the Investigator’s opinion, 
circumstances have changed such that the patient may now be an appropriate candidate for the 
study.  Approval by the Lundbeck Medical Monitor must be obtained for a patient to be re -
screened. A patient will only be allowed  to be re -screened once.  
At the time of re -screening, the patient must sign a new Informed Consent Form (ICF) and will 
be assigned a new screening number. A re -screened patient must complete a full new Screening 
Visit (Visit 1), and all eligibility criteri a must be re -assessed when re -screened.

• That the patient has previously been screened for the study  
• That re -screening has been authorized by the Lundbeck Medical Monit or 
• The screening number that was assigned to the patient at the previous screening visit  
For a re -screened patient, none of the data from the original Screening Visit, where the patient 
failed to enter the study, will be used in the statistical analysis.  
3.5.2 Open-Label Dose Titration (Visits 2a -2f) 
It is anticipated that patients will have up to 6 visits during the Titration Period (Visits 2a -2f); some 
patients may have as few as 2 visits.  It is possible that a patient may have more than 6 visits during 
the Ti tration Period in order to properly ascertain their optimal dose of IMP. In these cases, 
subsequent visits would be considered as 2g, 2h, etc. , and would be entered as Unscheduled visits 
in the eCRF . All open -label dose titration visits (except for Visit 2a) may be completed on site or 
via phone or video link . 
Visits within the Titration Period do not have fixed visit windows, although there should be a 
minimum of 1 day between each Titration Visit.  P atients should be titrated up until they reach 
600mg TID or until they reach one of the Titration stopping criteria (see Section 3.5.2.3).  Increases 
in dose must be at least 1 day apart.  The entire dose -titration schedule is to be completed, and the 
patient’s optimal dose reached, within the 4 -week titration period, which begins with the initial 
Titration  Visit (Visit 2a).  At the end of the Titration Period, patients will proceed to Visit 3 where 
their End of Titration criteria will be assessed (see Sect ion 3.5.3.1).  If these criteria are met, they 
will proceed into the Open -Label Period.  
Dose titration will begin with an initial dose of 100 mg TID open -label droxidopa and will not 
exceed 600 mg TID. All doses of IMP during the open -label dose titration period will be 
administered using 100 mg and 200 mg capsule strengths of droxidopa (no 300 mg capsules will 
be used during the Titration Period).   Bottles of open -label IMP must be dispensed through the 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS).  Patients ar e to be given IMP only from bottles 
dispensed specifically for them through the IWRS.  
3.5.2.1  Initial Open -Label Dose Titration Visit (Visit 2a)  
The Investigator, or other qualified designee, will conduct the following procedures at the first 
dose titration visit (Visit 2a) and record the data in the eCRF provided:  
• Clinical Symptoms: OHQ  (prior to initiating dosing ) 
• Clinician - and Patient -recorded CGI -S (prior to initiating dosing ) 
• Review of inclusion and exclusion criteria ( prior to initiating dosing )

• Assessment  of supine BP 3 hours (+/ - 30 minutes) post -dose (as per section 3.6.1.1.1)  
• Schedule the next visit and instruct patient on appropriate dosing schedule until the next 
visit 
If the patient is found to be experiencing supine systolic blood pressure ( SBP) greater than or 
equal to 180 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ( DBP ) greater than or equal to 110 mmHg, 
when assessed ~3 hours after their initial dose of IMP, they will be withdrawn from the study.  
3.5.2.2  Subsequent Open -Label Dose Titration (Visits 2b, 2c, 2d, 2e, 2f) 
At each subsequent Titration Visit, it is anticipated that the patient’s dose will be increased by 100 
mg higher than the previously evaluated dose (up to a maximum of 600  mg TID).  However, at the 
Investigator’s discretion the patient’s current dose may be maintained or reduced by 100 mg  TID.  
The patient’s first dose of IMP on the day of a Titration Visit should be administered in the clinic, 
regardless of the time of day for which the visit is scheduled. Visits 2b -2f may be completed on 
site or via phone or video link . 
The Investigator, other qualified designee, will conduct the following procedures at each dose 
titration visit and record the data in the eCRF provided:  
• Seated BP  (prior to dosing ) 
• Time and dose of droxidopa taken on the day of the vis it 
• Review of concomitant medications  
• Review of AEs  
• Assessment of supine BP 3 hours (+/ - 30 minutes) post -dose (as per section 3.6.1.1.1)  
• Dose Titration Evaluation  
• Schedule the next visit and instruct patient on appropriate dosing schedule until the next 
visit   
If the visit is done via phone or video link, the patient (or their caregiver) will record the seated 
BP, time and dose of droxidopa and supine BP and report this information to the Investigator or 
qualified designee during the call , who will record  this data in the eCRF provided.

Page 34 If at any time during the study and / or the titration period a patient experiences sustained 
hypertension or if a patient becomes symptomatic  for hypertension , the patient should be advised 
to immediately seek emergency me dical attention and contact the investigator . 
3.5.2.3  Titration Period Stopping Criteria  
Patients will be titrated upwards until either one of the following stopping criteria is met:  
1. The patient experiences supine SBP greater than or equal to 180 mmHg or DBP greater 
than or equal to 110 mmHg, when assessed ~3 hours after their initial dose of IMP;  
2. The patient is unable to tolerate side effects considered by the Investigator to be related to 
the IMP.  
If the initial supine BP measurement ~3 hours post -dose yield s values greater than or equal to 180 
mmHg SBP or 110 mmHg DBP, two additional supine measurements should be conducted which 
are at least 10 minutes apart and for each of which the patient has been supine for at least 5 minutes 
(see Section 3.6.1.1.1).  If the average of these 3 supine measurements are either ≥180 mmHg 
systolic or ≥110 mmHg diastolic, the patient will be considered to have met stopping criterion #1.  
A patient’s optimal dose is defined as the highest dose at which they did not meet either  of the 
titration stopping criteria.  If a patient does not meet either of the stopping criteria at 600 mg, this 
will be considered their optimal dose.   
Once the patient’s optimal dose has been established, the patient should be scheduled to return to 
the clinic for Visit 3 and instructed to continue taking their optimal dose until Visit 3.   This optimal 
dose will also be the dose assigned to the patient at the beginning of the Open -Label Period (Visit 
3). 
3.5.3 Open -Label Treatment Period (Visits 3 -6) 
The windo ws for Visits 4 -6 are anchored from the Visit 3 date, which is considered Day 0 of Open -
Label Treatment.  If the patient is required to return for a re -evaluation of the Open -Label entry 
criteria (see Section 3.5.3.1), the date of the re -evaluation will be  considered Day 0 of Open -Label 
Treatment.  
3.5.3.1  End of Titration / Initial Open -label Treatment Visit (Visit 3; Day 0)  
At Visit 3, in order to successfully complete the Titration Period and enter the Open -Label 
Period, patients must demonstrate an Acute Dizzine ss score ≥ 2 units lower (improved) than the 
Visit 2a OHSA Item #1 score.  
If a patient does not meet this criterion  at Visit 3, they may, at the Investigator ’s discretion, 
continue to take their assigned dose of droxidopa and then return to the clinic for a second 
evaluation of their Acute Dizziness score within 7 days (and within 28 days of Visit 2a).  This re-
evaluation would be recorded as an Unscheduled Visit.

enrolled into the Open -Label Period of the study as outlined below.  If the patient fails to meet this 
criterion  at both Visit 3 and the repeat evaluation, they are to be withdrawn from the study, and 
Early Termination procedures (see Section 3. 5.7) should be conducted.  
The patient is to take their first dose at Visit 3 from the IMP dispensed for the Titration Period.  If 
the patient is required to return for a re -evaluation of the Open -Label entry criteria, they are to 
continue to take their ass igned dose of droxidopa from the IMP dispensed for the Titration Period.  
Once a patient has been determined eligible to enter the Open -Label Period, the Investigator, or 
designee, will use the IWRS to dispense IMP for the Open -Label Period.

If a patient meets the criteria for a need for intervention at this visit, the pati ent is to be considered 
withdrawn due to a need for intervention, and their disposition recorded as such.  The Early 
Termination procedures should then be completed during the visit as outlined in Section 3.5.7 
below.  
3.5.6 Safety Follow -Up Visit (Visit 13)  
Sites will contact the patient 30 days (+5 days) after their final visit (Visit 12 or Early Termination 
Visit) to record any new AEs and follow -up on any AEs that were ongoing at the end of their 
previous visit.  This visit is to be conducted for all patients who have taken at least one dose of 
IMP; this visit is not required for patients who screen fail.  
The follow -up visit may be conducted via phone or video link .  In the event that the patient is 
unreachable, all reasonable efforts should be made and documen ted before considering the patient 
as unable to be contacted . 
3.5.7 Early Termination Visit  
If at any time during the study a patient requests to withdraw from treatment, or if a decision 
is made to withdraw the patient, including during the double -blind treatment period due to 
a need for intervention, the patient will be requested to return for an Early Termination 
Visit.  
If a decision is made to withdraw the patient from the study while on site due to:  
• a failure to meet criteria to enter the Open -Label Period at Visit 3  
• a failure to meet criteria to enter the Double -Blind Period at Visit 6  
• a need for intervention while on -site at Visits 8 or 10 , OR  
• for any other reason  
the Early Termination procedures should be completed during that visit.  The patient should not 
be brought back for an Early Termination Visit at a later date.  
Whenever practical,  patients should be encouraged to remain on IMP until the completion 
of the early termination procedures .  This is particularly important for patients who withdraw 
from the study during the double -blind treatment period.  As the primary efficacy endpoint i s time

Page 42 3.5.8 Unscheduled Visit  
A patient may return for an unscheduled visit at any time at the Investigator’s discretion.  The 
procedures conducted at the unscheduled visit may be limited, depending on the reason for the 
visit (for example, unscheduled visits for a repeat blood or urine sample, or for dispensing of 
new IMP to replace a lost bottle of IMP would onl y require those specific procedures relevant to 
the reason for the unscheduled visit to be done).  If an Unscheduled Visit is conducted between 
Visits 3 -5 of the Open -Label Period for the purpose of modifying a patient’s dose of IMP, all 
procedures  to be c onducted during an Open -Label Treatment Visit (see Section 3.5.3.2) should 
be conducted.  
3.5.9 Guidance regarding  Covid -19 
The protocol has always allowed the option of conducting Titration Visits 2b -2x remotely, via 
telephone or video chat.  In addition, Visits  7, 9 and 11 are required to be conducted remotely, as 
per the protocol.   
 
Due to the COVID -19 situation that developed in 2020, guidance was issued to all trial sites to 
temporarily allow all other study visits (except for Visits 1 and 2a) to be conducte d remotely.  
This was done in the interest of patient safety as well to allow compliance with local and site 
regulations and guidance regarding COVID -19.  This guidance also included procedures to allow 
IMP to be sent to patients via courier, if required, and allowed for Visit 6 and 12 lab samples to 
be collected at a later date if such visits could not be conducted on site.  This guidance was 
placed into effect on 17 March 2020 and, as of the date of this version of the protocol, is still in 
effect.   This guidance may be rescinded by Lundbeck at any time in the future, once it is 
determined to be no longer needed.

Page 44 3.6.1 General Study Procedures and Considerations  
3.6.1.1  Supine Blood Pressure Assessments  
3.6.1.1.1  Titration Period  
During the Titration Period, BP assessments are to be performed 3 hours (+/ - 30 minutes) after 
dosing at each visit during the open -label titration period (Visit s 2a-2f; Sections 3.5.2.1 & 3.5.2.2).  
The initial BP reading should be taken following a 10 minute period of rest in the supine position 
(head and torso elevated at approximately 30 degrees from horizontal).  If the initial 
measurements are greater than o r equal to 180 mmHg SBP or 110 mmHg DBP ,  two 
additional supine measurements should be conducted which are at least 10 minutes apart and for 
each of which the patient has been supine for at least 5 minutes prior to the reading.  
These measurements will be c onducted on site at Visit 2a.  If further titration visits are to be 
conducted via phone or video link, the Investigator will instruct the patient and / or caregiver at 
Visit 2a on how to conduct this BP reading at home and how to report the results during  the phone 
call or videoconference.  
3.6.1.1.2  Open Label Period and Double -Blind Period  
At Visits 4 , 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12 (as well as during an Early Termination Visit): A supine BP reading 
will be taken as part of the Vital Signs, and does not need to be at any specified time following 
dosing.  This BP reading should be taken following a 10 minute period of rest in the su pine position 
(head and torso elevated at approximately 30 degrees from horizontal).   
At Visits 7, 9 and 11, which are conducted via phone or video link, this supine BP reading will be 
conducted at home by the patient or caregiver.  The Investigator will instruct the patient and / or 
caregiver on how to conduct this BP reading at home and how to report the results during the 
phone call or videoconference.  
3.6.1.2  Seated Blood Pressure Assessments  
A seated BP assessment is to be performed as part of the Vital Signs  at the Screening Visit (Visit 
1), at all Titration Period Visits (Visits 2a -2f) and at Visit 3.  In addition, at Visit 3, a second seated 
BP is to be conducted 2 hours (+/ - 15 minutes) post dose (see Section 3.5.3.1).  These BP readings 
should be taken fo llowing a 5 minute period of rest with the patient in the seated position in a chair 
(head and torso elevated at approximately 90 degrees from horizontal, feet flat on the floor).  
3.6.1.3  Orthostatic Standing Test  
An Orthostatic Standing Test (OST) is to be conducted at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) if the patient 
does not have a documented history of OH.  T he patient will lie supine for at least 5 minutes (head 
and torso elevated at approximately 30 ° from horizontal).  BP measurements will be taken

Page 45 immediate ly prior to having the patient stand up, upon standing (minute 0) and after +3 minutes 
of standing.  If the Investigator considers that a patient cannot, or is unlikely to be able to stand for 
3 minutes, BP measurements should be taken as close to 3 minute s as possible.   
To calculate the decrease in BP, the “immediately prior to standing” SBP measurement is used as 
the baseline. The decrease in SBP is the difference between the baseline measurement and the 
lowest SBP measurement at a time point within 3 mi nutes of standing (between “minute 0” and 
“minute +3”).  
3.6.1.4  Alcohol Consumption  
Patients are to be instructed not to drink any alcohol in the 24 hours prior to any study visits, and 
not to exceed a moderate consumption level of alcohol at all other times duri ng the study.  
Moderate consumption is defined as no more than 2 standard drinks per day, with a standard drink 
containing 0.6 ounces of alcohol (e.g., 12 ounces of 5% beer, 6 ounces of 12% wine, or 1.5 ounces 
of 80 proof spirits per day).  
3.6.1.5  Hydration  
Patien ts should be well hydrated on entry to the study, and should be encouraged to remain well 
hydrated throughout the study period.  
3.6.2 Efficacy Assessments  
3.6.2.1  Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ)  
The OHQ was developed by clinicians who treat disorders of the autonomic nervous system, in 
consultation with a psychometrician and statistician (Kaufmann et al., 2011; 0 et al., 2005).  The 
questionnaire includes specific instr uctions that are read aloud to the patients before the 
questions are answered , and is administered in two separate sections; a symptom assessment 
scale and a daily activity scale.  
The Orthostatic Hypotension Symptom Assessment (OHSA) scale was designed to rate symptoms 
occurring specifically as a result of low BP, using an 11 -point scale (zero to 10), with more severe 
symptoms scoring higher.  A score of zero indicates that the symptom was not experienced.  The 
scale assesses six symptoms: 1) dizziness/ligh theadedness, 2) problems with vision, 3) weakness, 
4) fatigue, 5) trouble concentrating, and 6) head/neck discomfort.  Scores for each activity and a 
composite score for all 6 activities are tabulated.  
The Orthostatic Hypotension Daily Activity Scale (OHDAS) was designed as a measure of quality 
of life.  It uses an 11 -point scale to assess whether OH “interfered” with 4  types of activities:  1) 
standing for a short time, 2) standing for a long time, 3) w alking for a short time, and 4) walking 
for a long time.  A zero rating means that over the preceding week the activity was performed with 
no interference and a 10  rating means that OH completely interfered with the activity.  As many

Page 46 of these patients hav e difficulty walking or standing for reasons not directly related to their OH 
(e.g., parkinsonism or somatic neuropathy), patients are able to check a box in the questionnaire 
stating that they could not perform the activity for reasons other than OH.  Sco res for each activity 
and a composite score for all 4 activities are tabulated.  
The OHQ composite score is a mean of the OHSA composite and the OHDAS composite scores.  
3.6.2.2  Acute Dizziness Assessment  
At Visit 3, acute dizziness will be assessed by asking the pa tient to rate (on a scale from 0 -10) the 
severity of their symptom of dizziness/lightheadedness/feeling faint/feeling like you might black 
out due to low blood pressure during the past 24 hours.   
3.6.3 Safety Assessments  
3.6.3.1  Adverse Events  
All adverse events observ ed by the Investigator , elicited upon a non -leading question (such as 
“how do you feel?”), or reported spontaneously by the patient will be recorded, starting at the 
Screening Visit. T he Investigator  will assess the seriousness and the intensity of the adv erse event 
and its relationship to the IMP. Refer to Section 5 for details on the definition of adverse events 
and the manner in which they are to be recorded and reported . 
3.6.3.2  Blood Pressure Measurements  
Blood pressure should be taken on the same arm every vi sit. 
It is a recognized best practice that patients with symptomatic NOH are advised not to lay fully 
supine because of the associated risk of supine hypertension inherent with their condition (patients 
are advised to sleep in a semi -recumbent position).  Accordingly, for the purpose of this study, 
supine BP measurements are not to be conducted in the fully horizontal position, but should be 
done with patients positioned with their head and torso elevated at approximately 30 degrees from 
horizontal (see Sec tion 3.6.1.1).  
Patients will be instructed by the Investigator or qualified designee how to take and report their 
BP for visits that take place via phone or video link (see Sections 3.6.1.1.1 and 3.6.1.1.2).  
If at any time during the study and / or the tit ration period a patient experiences sustained 
hypertension or if a patient becomes symptomatic  for hypertension , the patient should be advised 
to immediately seek emergency medical attention and contact the investigator .

Page 47 3.6.3.3  Physical Examination  
A physical e xamination will be conducted at the screening visit (V isit 1) and at the End of 
Treatment Visit (Visit 12) / Early Termination Visit.  The physician conducting the physical exam 
must state whether or not any abnormal findings are of clinical significance.  
3.6.3.4  ECG  
A 12 -lead ECG will be conducted at the Screening Visit (Visit 1).  The Investigator, or a qualified 
designee, will be responsible for reviewing the results of this assessment, and must evaluate 
whether the results are normal or abnormal; the Investigat or must also state whether or not any 
abnormal findings are of clinical significance.  
3.6.3.5  Vital Signs and Weight  
Vital signs (seated BP, HR, RR, temperature) and weight will be measured at the Screening Visit 
(Visit 1), the first visit of the Titration Period  (Visit 2a) and Visit 3.  At Visits 4 -12 (and at the 
Early Termination Visit), the vital signs procedure will be modified to include a supine BP 
measurement (see Section 3.6.1.1.2) instead of a seated BP assessment.  Height will be measured 
only at the Scr eening Visit (Visit 1).  At Visit 3, a second, seated BP assessment will be taken ~2 
hours post -dose (see Section 3.5.3.3).  
3.6.3.6  Clinical Safety Laboratory Tests  
All analytical tests will be performed by a central laboratory.  Urine pregnancy test will be asses sed 
at sites.  Electronic copies of all results will be provided to the Investigator.   
The following laboratory tests will be performed at Screening (Visit 1), End of Open -label 
Treatment / Randomization (Visit 6) and End of Treatment (Visit 12) or Early Termination, as

3.7.1 Efficacy Endpoints  
3.7.1.1  Primary Efficacy Endpoints  
Time to intervention.   Need for intervention is defined as meeting A NY of the following events 
that occur in the Double -Blind Period:  
• OHSA Item #1 ≥2 unit worsening from Randomization (Visit 6) AND lack of efficacy as 
judged by the  Investigator; OR  
• OHSA Item #1 ≥2 unit worsening from Randomization (Visit 6) at 2 consecutive visits; 
OR 
• OHSA Item #1 ≥2 unit worsening from Randomization (Visit 6) at the visit before early 
discontinuation; OR  
• Patient stops IMP or withdraws from study for patient -reported lack of efficacy  
The timing of the need for intervention in the above criteria is defined as the first occurrence of a 
worsening of OHSA item 1 by ≥ 2 units or when the patient stops taking IM P, whichever comes 
first. 
The primary efficacy analysis will include all randomized patients who received at least one dose 
of double -blind IMP (all patients treated set (APTS)) and will be analyzed by the log -Rank test to

Page 50 3.7.2 Safety Endpoints  
Adverse events, vital signs, and clinical safety laboratory assessments will be observed through 
the entire study.  Safety parameters from the open -label portion of the study (Titration Period and 
Open -Label Period) and the Double -Blind Period will be repo rted separately.  
3.8 Early Termination  
An Early Termination occurs when an enrolled patient ceases participation in the study, regardless 
of the circumstances, prior to completion of the study.  The Investigator must determine the 
primary reason for discontin uation or withdrawal.  P atients withdrawing due to reasons other than 
a need for intervention will be censored at the time of withdrawal.   
Withdrawal due to an AE (see Section 5.1 for the definition of an AE) should correspond to the 
AE recorded on the ap propriate eCRF page.  
When a patient is withdrawn due to a serious adverse event (SAE), the SAE must be reported in 
accordance with the reporting requirements defined below (see Section 5.4).  A withdrawal due to 
an SAE must be reported immediately to Lundb eck or the site’s Clinical Research Associate 
(CRA).  The decision to withdraw a patient from treatment for safety reasons may be made by the 
Medical Monitor, Lundbeck, and/or the Investigator.  In the event of discontinuation of treatment 
/ withdrawal fro m treatment, the Investigator will complete Early Termination procedures for the 
specified patient, as outlined in Section 3.5.7 . 
If a subject becomes pregnant during the study, she will be withdrawn from study treatment 
immediately.  The pregnancy must be reported as detailed in Section 5.2. 
The patient may elect to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.  If the pat ient 
wishes to withdraw from treatment, they should return for a final, on -site visit, and the 
procedures outlined for an Early Termination Visit should be completed (see Section 3.5.7 ).  
Whenever practical, subjects should remain on IMP until the completi on of the end of the 
Early Termination Visit.  
3.9 Study Termination  
Premature termination of this clinical study may occur as a result of a regulatory authority decision, 
change in opinion of the institutional review board/independent ethics committee (IRB/IEC ), drug 
safety concerns, or at the discretion of Lundbeck.  In addition, Lundbeck retains the right to 
discontinue development of droxidopa at any time.  
The Investigator reserves the right to terminate the study, at his/her participating study site, at any  
time, for any reasons.  Should this be necessary, the procedures will be arranged on an individual 
site basis after review and consultation with Lundbeck.  In terminating the study, Lundbeck, the

is given to the protection of the patients’ interests.  
4. STUDY TREATMENTS  
4.1 Allocation to Study Treatments  
In the Double -Blind Period, each patient will be randomized to receive study treatment (droxidopa 
or matching pla cebo; 1:1 ratio) according to a computer generated randomization schedule 
administered through a central IWRS. Neither the Investigator nor the patient will know the 
identity of the treatment that the patient will receive; however, the study will not be bl inded with 
respect to (expected) dose.    
All bottles of IMP will be dispensed through the central IWRS.  
4.2 Emergency Blind Breaking  
In the case of an emergency where, in the opinion of the Investigator, discontinuation of IMP is 
not sufficient and the study treatment must be unblinded in order to evaluate a further course of 
action, the Investigator should make every effort to contact the Medical Monitor prior to 
unblinding.  The Investigator requesting the unblinding should be able to confirm that the 
unblin ding of the patient is necessary and directly impacts the patient’s immediate medical 
management.  
In the rare event that contact with the Medical Monitor and/or sponsor is not possible prior to 
unblinding, the Investigator reserves the right to unblind a p atient in a true medical emergency, 
where patient safety is at immediate risk. All instances of emergency unblinding must be reported 
to the Medical Monitor within 24 hours.  Upon breaking the blind, the patient must be withdrawn 
from the study, but should  be followed up for safety purposes.  
The procedures described below will be followed in the event a request for emergency unblinding 
is received.  
The Medical Monitor will discuss the request with the Investigator and record the following 
information:  
• Proto col Number  
• Site Number  
• Patient Number and Initials  
• Reasons for Unblinding  
• Current Interventions

The sponsor representative/Study Medical Monitor will follow up wi th the Investigator to 
communicate the decision regarding the request for unblinding.   
The Investigator will perform the emergency unblinding in accordance with the applicable 
procedure described in the IWRS procedures documentation.  
4.3 IMP Supplies  
IMP will  be provided to the study site as open -label 100 - and 200 -mg capsules for the Titration 
Period, as open -label 100 - 200-, and 300 mg capsules for the Open -Label Period, and as double -
blind 100 -, 200 -, and 300 -mg capsules and matching placebo for the Double -Blind Period.  IMP 
is to be stored at room temperature (20 °C-25°C).   
Patients must bring their IMP (including empty bottles) with them to each study visit, and must 
return all unfinished IMP to the Investigator at the end of each study period.  Inventory control of 
all IMP must be rigorously maintained throughout the duration of the study until final 
accountability procedures have been performed by the CRA, at which time the IMP may be 
destroyed on -site or returned to Lundbeck or the sponsor’s designee (se e Section 4.6).  Any 
discrepancies noted between Drug Dispensing Records and the drug inventory must be reported to 
the sponsor.  
4.4 Manufacturing, Formulation, Packaging and Labeling of IMP  
4.4.1 Formulation Details  
Each active IMP capsule will contain 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg droxidopa.  
Matching placebo capsules will contain the same ingredients as the active IMP capsules, except 
that droxidopa will be replaced by an equivalent quantity of mannitol.  
4.4.2 Manufacturing, Packaging and Labeling Details  
All IMP will be man ufactured and packaged by Patheon, and will be labeled by Almac, and will 
be distributed in accordance with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice, under the 
responsibility of Lundbeck.  Patheon will provide sufficient test formulations and the resp ective 
certificates of analysis, and will keep reference samples of the medication.   
IMP for the Titration, Open -Label and Double -Blind periods will be packaged and labeled to 
clearly identify the dose of the IMP.  All double -blind IMP will be packaged an d labeled according 
to a randomization schedule generated by the Lundbeck BioStatistics department or their designee.  
For the IMP provided for the Double -Blind Period, the labels will be blinded with respect to 
treatment identity (but not dose) and will c ontain at least the following information (where 
required):

capsules for the Double -Blind Period will also be packaged in child -resistant high -density 
polyethylene (HDPE) bottles, each containing 90  capsules of either 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg 
droxidopa or matching placebo. IMP w ill be stored in a secure, locked area, which is only 
accessible to authorized study personnel.  
4.5.2 Route of Administration and Dose Schedule  
Each patient will take 1 to 3 capsules three times daily during the Titration Period, and 1 -2 capsules 
three times da ily during the Open Label Period and during the Double -Blind Period.  Capsules will 
be taken orally with water (typically half a glass).  
Doses are to be timed such that the first dose is taken upon waking and then taken approximately 
every 4 hours thereaf ter, with the final dose taken early enough (i.e., late afternoon) to minimize 
drug effects during night -time sleeping hours.  However, on days when a patient has a study 
visit, the first dose should not be taken until the patient has arrived at the site f or their visit .

During the Titrat ion Period, the dose of IMP will be up -titrated from 100 mg TID to 600 mg TID 
(see Section 3.5.2).  It is anticipated that this will take up to 6  Titration visits, within the 4 -week 
Titration Period.  
During the initial 8 weeks of the Open -Label Period, the Inv estigator may elect to increase or 
decrease an individual patient’s dose, in increments of 100 mg TID, a maximum of four times (see 
Section 3.5.3.2).  The dose should remain stable during the last four weeks of the Open -Label 
Period (between Visits 5 and 6 ).

Page 56 4.6 Drug Storage and Accountability  
A central IWRS will be used to manage on -site IMP supplies.  The Investigator or a qualified 
designee (e.g., pharmacist) will receive IMP supplies and keep records of their receipt, storage, 
and dispensing in accordance w ith current  International Conference on Harmonization ( ICH) Good 
Clinical Practice ( GCP ) guidelines.  A Drug Dispensing Log must be kept current and should 
contain, at a minimum, the following information:  
• The identification/randomization number of the pat ient to whom the IMP was dispensed;  
• The date(s) and quantity of IMP dispensed to the patient.  
The inventory must be available for inspection by the study’s CRA or Lundbeck.  During the study, 
the Investigator or a qualified designee will liaise with the CR O to ensure that supplies of IMP are 
maintained.  
Unused or partially used IMP may be destroyed by the Investigator only after authorization from 
the CRA (after verification with Lundbeck), provided such disposition does not expose humans to 
risk from the d rug.  The Investigator or their designee  should maintain records of any such 
alternative disposition of the IMP.  These records must show the identification and quantity of 
each unit that has been disposed, the method of destruction (taking into account th e requirements 
of local law and the site’s standard operating procedures [SOPs]), and the person who disposed of 
the IMP.  Alternatively, Investigators may elect to return unused or partially used drug supplies to 
Lundbeck, or the sponsor’s designee, inste ad of destroying them on -site. 
4.7 Treatment Compliance  
At each visit at which IMP is dispensed, patients will be given sufficient IMP to supply them until 
their next clinic visit.  
Patients will be required to bring their IMP to all in clinic visits, and compl iance will be monitored 
by capsule counts.  The number of returned capsules will be counted by the Investigator, or a 
designee,  and recorded in the Drug Dispensing Log and eCRF.  The study CRA will review the 
compliance documentation during routine monitor ing visits.  
At least 80% compliance will be defined as acceptable in this study during the Open -Label and 
Double -Blind periods.  If a patient is found to be below 80% compliance during a treatment visit, 
the patient should be counseled on the proper dosin g regimen and the counseling should be 
documented in the patient’s chart.  If a patient is found to be non -compliant at a second treatment 
visit, the Investigator is to discuss this issue with the Medical Monitor in order to determine the 
patient’s eligibi lity to continue in the study.  In the event of over -compliance (i.e., a patient who 
is found to be over 120% compliant with their IMP), the patient will be treated in the same manner 
as a patient with compliance below 80%.

Page 57 4.8 Prior and Concomitant Medication s 
4.8.1 Concomitant Medications  
No prescribed concomitant medication is to be taken without the knowledge of the Investigator.  
The Investigator may, at their discretion, prescribe any medication considered necessary for the 
patient’s welfare that is not expecte d to interfere with the evaluation of the IMP.  
All concomitant medications must be recorded in the eCRF.  The generic name of the drug, dose, 
frequency of dose and the duration of treatment must be specified.  In addition, any diagnostic, 
therapeutic or su rgical procedure conducted during the study, that is not part of the study, should 
be recorded in the eCRF.  The date, indication, description of procedure(s) and any clinical finding 
should be recorded.  
All concomitant medications (including permitted med ications given concomitantly for 
symptomatic NOH) should be maintained at stable doses during the study.  Any proposed changes 
in a patient’s treatment for symptomatic NOH considered necessary by the Investigator must be 
discussed with the Study Medical Mo nitor prior to implementation to determine its impact on the 
patient’s participation in the study.  
If patients are already on other concomitant medications, which based on investigator judgment, 
would be expected to have side effect of hypertension, (e.g, amphetamine, amphetamine -like 
drugs, serotonin -norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors ( SNRIs ), and norepinephrine reuptake 
inhibitors ( NRIs )), evaluate their continued use when introducing droxidopa . 
4.8.2 Prior Medications  
Prior medication includes all medications (including herbal treatments and vitamins) taken within 
28 days prior the Screening Visit (Visit 1).  All prior medications taken within 28 days of the 
Screening Visit must be recorded in the appropriate eCRF page.  
4.8.3 Prohibited Medications  
Administering droxidopa  in combination with other agents that increase blood pressure (e.g, 
norepinephrine, ephedrine, midodrine, triptans) would be expected to increase the risk for supine 
hypertension. The following drugs must not be prescribed by the Investigator or taken by patients 
during the study:  
• Vasoconstricting agents such as ephedrine, dihydroergotamine, or midodrine;  
• Sumatriptan -like drugs, (for example,  naratriptan, zolmitriptan, rizatriptan);  
• Cyclopropane or halothane, or other halogen -containing inhalational anesthetics;  
• Catecholamine -containing preparations (e.g. isoprenaline);

• Oral Anticoagulants in the drug classes of Coumarins: Coumadin (warfarin); Factor Xa 
Inhibitors: Xarelto (rivaroxaban), Eliquis (apixaban) , Savaysa (edoxaban); and Direct

• Any investigational medication.  
Patients currently taking a prohibited medication at Screening may be enrolled into the study 
after a washout of at least 5 half -lives prior to first dose of IMP at Visit 2a.  Patients taking 
midodrine at Screening are required to washout of this drug for at least 2 days prior to first dose 
of IMP at Visit 2a.  
4.8.4 Allowed Medications  
Concomitant treatment for symptomatic NOH (with the ex ception of vasoconstricting agents) will 
be permitted during the study. This includes fludrocortisone, which is permitted during the study. 
Medications for the treatment of PD will be permitted during the study. Fludrocortisone and 
medications for treatmen t of the patient’s primary diagnosis should remain stable during the 
Double -Blind Period.  Short -acting anti -hypertensive medications taken at bedtime to reduce the 
risk of nocturnal supine hypertension may be taken during the study.  
The concomitant use of  drugs that inhibit the re -uptake of NE at nerve terminals (e .g. tricyclic 
antidepressants) is permitted during the study.  However, due to a potential interaction with 
droxidopa, patients are not allowed to either initiate treatment with NE re -uptake inhi bitors or 
modify the dose of any such medications during the study (the combined action of both drugs can 
increase NE concentrations at the nerve terminal).  
5. ADVERSE EVENTS  
5.1 Definitions  
5.1.1 Adverse Event Definitions  
5.1.1.1  Adverse Events  
An Adverse Event (AE)  is any un toward medical occurrence in a clinical study patient 
administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment.

Page 59 An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including clinically significant out -
of-range values from relevant tests, such as clinical safety laboratory tests, vital signs, ECGs), 
symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, regardless of 
whether it is considered related to the medicina l product.  
All AEs, including pre -treatment AEs (those that start after the patient has signed the ICF and prior 
to the first dose of IMP) will be collected and recorded up until 30 days after the last dose of IMP.  
Worsening of NOH is related to the prima ry endpoint in the Double -Blind Period.  As such, 
“worsening of NOH” is not to be considered an AE in the Double -Blind Period of this study unless 
the worsening meets the criteria for an SAE (see Section 5.1.1.2).  
5.1.1.2  Serious Adverse Events  
A serious adverse event  (SAE) – is any AE that:  
• results in death  
• is life -threatening (this refers to an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the 
time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hypothetically might have caused death 
had it been more sever e) 
• requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity  
• is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
• is medically important (this refers to an event that may not be immediately li fe-threatening 
or result in death or hospitalization, but may jeopardize the patient or may require 
intervention to prevent any of the SAEs defined above)  
SAE’s are collected 30 days after the last dose of IMP.  
Examples of medically important events are in tensive treatment in an emergency room for allergic 
bronchospasm; blood dyscrasia or convulsions that do not result in hospitalization; or development 
of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
Planned hospitalizations or surgical interventions for a condition that  existed before the patient 
signed the ICF and that did not change in intensity are not SAEs.  
A non -serious adverse event  is any AE that does not meet the definition of an SAE.  
If there is any doubt as to whether an AE meets the definition of an SAE, a con servative viewpoint 
must be taken, and the adverse event must be reported as an SAE.  
A suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction  (SUSAR) is any AE that is assessed as serious, 
unexpected (its nature or intensity is not consistent with the current versi on of the reference safety 
information) and related to an investigational product by either the Investigator  or the sponsor.

Page 60 An overdose is a dose taken by a patient that exceeds the dose prescribed to that patient. Any 
overdose (and associated symptoms) m ust, at a minimum be recorded as a non -serious adverse 
event.  
5.1.2 Adverse Event Assessment Definitions  
5.1.2.1  Assessment of Intensity  
The Investigator  must assess the intensity of the adverse event using the following definitions, and 
record it on the Adverse Event Form : 
• Mild: the AE causes minimal discomfort and does not interfere in a significant manner 
with the subject’s normal activities.  
• Moderate: the AE is sufficiently uncomfortable to produce some impairment of the 
subject’s normal activities.  
• Severe : the AE i s incapacitating, preventing the subject from participating in his or her  
normal activities.  
5.1.2.2  Assessment of Causal Relationship  
The Investigator  must assess the causal relationship between the AE and the IMP using the 
following definitions, and record it on  the Adverse Event Form (and on the Serious Adverse Event 
Report Form, if applicable):  
• Probable : the AE has a strong temporal relationship to the IMP or recurs on rechallenge, 
and another aetiology is unlikely or significantly less likely.  
• Possible : the AE  has a suggestive temporal relationship to the IMP, and an alternative 
aetiology is equally or less likely.  
• Not related: the AE has no temporal relationship to the IMP or is due to 
underlying/concurrent illness or effect of another drug (that is, there is no causal 
relationship between the IMP and the adverse event).  
An AE is considered causally related to the use of the IMP when the causality assessment is 
probable or possible . 
5.1.2.3  Assessment of Outcome  
The Investigator  must assess the outcome of the AE using the following definitions, and record it 
on the Adverse Event Form  (and on the Serious Adverse Event Report Form, if applicable):  
• Recovered: the subject has recovered completely, and no symptoms remain.  
• Recovering : the subject’s condition i s improving, but symptoms still remain.

Page 61 • Recovered with sequelae: the subject has recovered, but some symptoms remain (for 
example, the subject had a stroke and is functioning normally, but has some motor 
impairment).  
• Not recovered: the subject’s condition has not improved and the symptoms are unchanged 
(for example, an atrial fibrillation has become chronic).  
• Death  
5.2 Pregnancy  
Although not necessarily considered an AE, a pregnancy in a patient in the study must be recorded 
on an  Adverse Event Report Form , as well as on a  Pregnancy Form , even if no adverse event associated 
with the pregnancy has occurred. Pregnancies must be reported to Lundbeck using the same 
expedited reporting timelines as those for SAEs.  
An uncomplicated pregnancy should not be considered a n SAE. If, however, the pregnancy is 
associated with an SAE, the appropriate serious criterion (for example, hospitalization) must be 
indicated on the  Serious Adverse Event Report Form . Examples of pregnancies to be reported as SAEs 
(medically important) a re spontaneous abortions, stillbirths, and malformations.  
The Investigator  must follow up on the outcome of the pregnancy and report it on a Pregnancy 
Form .  The follow -up must include information on the neonate at least up until the age of 1 month.  
5.3 Recording Adverse Events  
Adverse events (including pre -treatment AEs) must be recorded on an Adverse Event Form . The 
Investigator  must provide information on the AE, preferably with a diagnosis, or at least with signs 
and symptoms; start and stop dates, st art and stop time; intensity; causal relationship to IMP; action 
taken; and outcome. If the AE is an overdose, the nature of the overdose must be stated (for 
example, medication error, accidental overdose, or intentional overdose). If the intensity changes  
during the course of an adverse event, this must be recorded on the Adverse Event Intensity Log.  
If the AE is serious , this must be indicated on the Adverse Event Form . Furthermore, the 
Investigator  must fill out a Serious Adverse Event Report Form  and re port the SAE to Lundbeck, 
NA immediately  (within 24 hours) after becoming aware of it (refer to section  5.4). 
Adverse events, including clinically significant out -of-range clinical safety laboratory test values, 
must be recorded individually, except when c onsidered manifestations of the same medical 
condition or disease state; in such cases, they must be recorded under a single diagnosis.  
5.4 Reporting Serious Adverse Events  
The Investigator must report SAEs to Lundbeck immediately (within 24 hours) after becom ing 
aware of them by completing a Serious Adverse Event Form in the EDC system.

Page 62 As much information as possible must be entered when initially completing the EDC form.  I f 
more information about the patient’s condition becomes available  at a later date , the Serious 
Adverse Event Form in the EDC system must be updated with the additional information.  
If the investigator cannot report the SAE in the EDC System, then he or she must complete and 
sign the Serious Adverse Event Fallback Form and send to:  
Global Pharmacovigilance – US (GPV -US) 
Fax:       +1 (847) 282 -1003  
e-mail:    luinc_safety@lundbeck.com  
 
The signed (original) Serious Adverse Event Fallback Form must be collected by the CRA and 
filed in the sponsor TMF.  
Any Serious Adverse Event i nformation pr ovided on the Serious Adverse Event Fallback Form 
must be entered into the EDC system in a timely manner . 
Lundbeck will assume responsibility for reporting SAEs to the authorities in accordance with local 
regulations.  
It is the Investigator ’s responsibility to be familiar with local requirements regarding reporting 
SAEs to the IEC or IRB and to act accordingly.  
Lundbeck will assess expectedness and inform the Investigators about suspected unexpected 
serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) via individual blinded CIOMS  in accordance with local 
requirements.  
5.5 Treatment and Follow -Up of Adverse Events  
Patients with AEs must be treated in accordance with usual clinical practice at the discretion of the 
Investigator . 
Non-serious AEs must be followed up until resolution or the follow -up assessment (Visit 13), 
whichever comes first. At the safety follow -up visit (Visit 13), information on new SAEs, if any, 
and stop dates for previously reported AEs must be recorded.  
It is the responsibility of the Inves tigator  to follow up on SAEs until the patient has recovered, 
stabilized, or recovered with sequelae, and to report to Lundbeck all relevant new information 
using the same procedures and timelines as those for the initial report. Relevant information 
inclu des discharge summaries, autopsy reports, and medical consultations.  
SAEs that are spontaneously reported by a patient to the Investigator  after the follow -up 
assessment must be handled in the same manner as SAEs that occur during the study. These SAEs 
will be captured in the GPV database.  
5.6 Warnings and Precautions  
Patients will be informed in a language that is understandable to them, that the following clinically 
significant adverse reaction was reported in post -marketing data: neuroleptic malignant syndro me

Page 63 (symptoms include hyperpyrexia, disturbance of consciousness, marked muscle rigidity, 
involuntary movements, and elevation of serum CPK).  If these adverse reactions should occur, 
the Investigator should contact the medical monitor to discuss.  
Other adv erse reactions that have been reported with droxidopa can be found in the PI.  
6. DATA ANALYSIS / STATISTICAL METHODS  
Continuous variables will be summarized using descriptive statistics including the number of 
observations, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum values.  Categorical 
values will be summarized using number of observations and percentages.  
All other statistical tests will be done at the two -sided, 5% significance level, unless otherwise 
specified.  The assumptions underlying the s tatistical tests will be evaluated as appropriate and 
documented in the study report.  
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy endpoints will be evaluated using the full analysis set (FAS).  
In order to control the overall type I error, statistical significanc e of the secondary endpoints (see 
Section 3.7.1.2 ) will be evaluated using a hierarchical testing procedure that will be described in 
the Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP).  
A detailed description of all planned analyses will be provided in the SAP before the  study is 
unblinded.  Any deviations from the protocol or SAP will be documented in the study report.  
6.1 Sample Size Determination  
The sample size and power calculations are based on the analysis of time to intervention in the 
Double -Blind Period.   
It is anticipated that event rates will be 0.15 for the droxidopa group and 0.25 for the placebo 
group 12 weeks post randomization. Assuming these event rates and a hazard ratio of 0.56 in 
favor of droxidopa, a 240 -subject sample size would be expected to result  in 48 events, providing 
~51% power to detect a difference between droxidopa and placebo.  A blinded review conducted  
in July 2020 indicated that the event rate may be higher than originally assumed  and, if accurate , 
will resul t in a substantially higher p ower than 51% .  In addition, the study will contribute to the 
totality of results for the post -marketing requirement (PMR) evaluation, which justifies the 
reduced power given the circumstances.   
6.2 Randomization  
The study randomization schedule will be computer generated by the Lundbeck BioStatistics 
department or their designee, and provided to the IWRS programmers prior to the opening of site 
enrollment.  Randomization will be on a one to one basis with no addit ional stratification factors.

Page 64 Neither the Investigator nor the patient will know the identity of the treatment that the patient will 
receive; however, the study will not be blinded with respect to (expected) dose.  
6.3 Study Treatments  
Summaries of efficacy an d safety data for this study will be presented in terms of randomized 
treatment group (i.e., droxidopa or placebo) as well as for all open -label periods of the study.  
6.4 Analysis Population  
6.4.1 Safety Set  
The Safety Set will consist of all patients who received a t least one dose of IMP.  This includes 
patients who received IMP during the open label titration.  All safety analyses will be based on the 
Safety Set unless otherwise specified.  
6.4.2 All Patients Treated Set  
The APTS will be a modified intent to treat (ITT) s et, consisting of all randomized patients who 
take at least one dose of study drug in the double -blind period of the trial.  Patients will be included 
in the analysis according to the treatment to which they were randomized.  
6.4.3 Per Protocol Set  
The per protoc ol set (PPS) will consist of patients in the FAS who do not have major protocol 
violations and are compliant with study treatment.  Compliance will be defined as taking at least 
80% of the planned study doses during the 12 -week Double -Blind Period, from th e date of 
Randomization (Visit 6) to the date of their final visit (Visit 12 or Early Termination Visit).  In 
order to minimize the potential for bias, the review of protocol violations and assignment of 
patients to analysis sets will be performed prior to  unblinding.  Protocol violations will be defined 
in the SAP and will be listed by treatment group.  
The primary efficacy analysis will be based on the APTS, although a secondary analysis will also 
be performed based upon the PP Set, to assess the sensitivi ty of the analysis to the choice of 
analysis population.  Analysis of all other efficacy endpoints will be based upon the APTS.  
Selected secondary efficacy parameters may be evaluated using the PP Set.  All safety analyses 
will be based on the Safety Set.  
6.5 Data Summary  
6.5.1 Summary of Efficacy Data  
Details of the analysis of these endpoints , as well as exploratory endpoints,  will be further 
described in the SAP.

Page 65 6.5.1.1  Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
The primary endpoint is time to treatment intervention defined in section 1.3.2. The event time is 
measured as the time from randomization to the  time of occurrence of the earliest event, as defined 
in the treatment intervention criteria. Patients withdrawing and without need for intervention will 
be censored at the time  of withdrawal; patients without need for intervention before the end of the 
study will be censored at the time of study completion.   
The primary endpoint will be summarized using Kaplan -Meier method. The primary analysis is 
the Log -rank test to compare th e two treatment groups. In addition, the cox regression model will 
be used to estimate the hazard ratio.  Furthermore, the following sensitivity analysis using the same 
analysis approach will be conducted:  
1 Time to treatment intervention according to the treatment intervention criteria (see Section 
3.7.1.1) or OHSA  Item #1 ≥ 2 unit worsening from randomization at the last visit of the 
study  
2 Time to treatment intervention defined as discontinuation due to lack of efficacy as judged 
by the Investigator . 
3 Cox regression analysis of time to treatment intervention based on various definitions 
above.     
6.5.1.2  Analysis of Key Secondary Endpoint  
A gate keeping strategy will be applied in the testing of the key secondary endpoint, time to all 
cause discontinuation. That i s, the Log -rank test of this endpoint will be performed at the nominal 
alpha level of 2 -sided 0.05 only if the primary endpoint reaches the statistical significance in the 
primary analysis. This strategy ensures the overall type 1 error rate is preserved.  
6.5.1.3  Analysis of Other Secondary Endpoints  
Proportion  of patients with need for treatment intervention will be summarized by treatment groups 
and treatment difference will be tested using Chi -square test.  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize mean c hange of OHSA item 1 score as well as 
OHQ composite score from randomization to each post randomization visit.  
Categorical analysis will be used to summarize both clinician and patient reported CGI -S at each 
post-randomization visit.  
6.5.2 Summary of Safety Data  
The safety data will be presented in two separate periods of the study.  The Titration Period and 
the 12 week Open -Label Period will be presented as appropriate in standard tabulations and 
listings . The changes from Randomization (Visit 6) to Week 12 of t he Double -Blind Period (Visit

Further details will be provided in the SAP.  
Clinical laboratory tests will be summarized using descriptive statistics by vis it and treatment 
group.  Changes from randomization and shift tables will also be presented as appropriate. Vital 
signs will be summarized by treatment group using descriptive statistics and/or listed.  
AEs will be coded according to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) AE 
dictionary.  Treatment -emergent AEs will be summarized by system organ class, preferred term, 
and by treatment group.  Severity of the AE and the relationship to IMP will also be summarized.  
Serious AEs and events lea ding to discontinuation of IMP will be summarized by body system, 
preferred term and treatment group.  
6.6 Interim Analysis  
There will be no interim efficacy analysis for this study.  Accordingly, no formal stopping rules 
will be applied.  
An interim analysis of  safety data will be prepared annually.  
6.7 Replacement Policy  
A sufficient number of patients will be screened to allow 240 patients to be randomized into the 
study and receive at least one dose of double -blind IMP ( 120 randomized to droxidopa and 120 
randomi zed to placebo).   
Patients who fail to qualify prior to receiving their first dose of IMP may be rescreened once, with 
approval of the Medical Monitor (see Section 3.5.1.2).  
7. DATA MONITORING COMMITTEE  
Safety data from this study will not be reviewed by an independent Data Monitoring Committee 
(DMC).    
8. STUDY DOCUMENTATION, eCRF AND RECORD KEEPING  
8.1 Investigator’s Files and Retention of Study Data  
The Investigator must maintain adequate and accurate record s to enable the conduct of the study 
to be fully documented and the study data to be subsequently verified.  These documents should 
be separated into two categories: Investigator’s study file and patient clinical source documents.  
1. The Investigator’s study file will contain the protocol and protocol amendments (if 
applicable), eCRF guidelines, eCRF query forms, IRB/IEC and governmental regulatory 
approval with correspondence, informed consent, drug records, staff curriculum vitae and 
authorization forms and other appropriate documents and correspondence.

Page 67 2. Patient clinical source documents (which are usually defined by the project in advance to 
record key efficacy and/or safety parameters independent of the eCRF) may include patient 
and/or hospital clinical rec ords, physician’s and nurse’s notes, appointment book, original 
laboratory reports, ECG, X -ray, pathology and special assessment reports, consultant’s 
letters, screening and enrollment log, etc.  
The patient’s involvement in the study should be clearly docu mented in the study site’s clinical 
records. Details should include the study protocol number, the patient’s screening and 
randomization number, the patient’s consent to take part in the study (including the date of 
consent), the dates of all study visits,  details of any treatments withdrawn because of study 
participation, the dates of dispensing IMP, details of any AEs (including any SAEs), and changes 
in concomitant medications.  
The documents in these two categories must be kept on file by the Investigato r for at least 15  years 
after completion or termination of the study.  
Study documents should not be destroyed without prior written agreement between Lundbeck and 
the Investigator. If the Investigator wishes to assign the study records to another party or move 
them to another location, Lundbeck must be notified in advance.  
If the Investigator cannot guarantee this archiving requirement for any or all the documents at the 
investigational site, arrangements must be made between the Investigator and Lundbeck t o store 
these in a sealed container(s) outside the site. The sealed container(s) can therefore be returned to 
the Investigator in case of a regulatory audit. Where source documents are required for the 
continued care of the patient, appropriate copies shou ld be made for storing outside the site.  
8.2 Electronic Case Report Forms  
The Investigator is to record all data with respect to protocol procedures, drug administration, local 
laboratory data, safety data and efficacy ratings in the eCRF.  The Investigator mu st sign the final 
eCRF pages to attest to the accuracy and completeness of all data.   
8.3 Background Data  
The Investigator will supply Lundbeck and the CRO, on request, with any required background 
data from the study documentation or clinic records.  This is  particularly important when errors in 
data transcription are suspected.  In case of special problems and/or governmental queries or 
requests for audit inspections, it is also necessary to have direct access to the completed study 
records, provided that pa tient confidentiality is protected.  
8.4 Monitoring, Verification of Data, Audit, and Inspection  
The Lundbeck monitor, or assigned CRA, will periodically visit each site that has enrolled patients 
into the study to discuss the progress of the study and review e CRFs and original source documents

Periodically, some/all of the facilities used in the study (e.g., laboratory, pharmacy) may be 
reviewed or inspected by Lu ndbeck, the IRB/IEC and/or regulatory authorities.  
The Investigator is to ensure that the study participants are aware of and consent that personal 
information may be reviewed during the data verification process as part of monitoring/auditing 
by properly authorized agents of Lundbeck or subject to inspection by regulatory authorities.  In 
addition, participation and personal information is treated as strictly confidential to the extent the 
applicable law permits and not publicly  available.  The audit or in spection may include, for 
example, a review of all source documentation, drug records, original medical notes, some or all 
of the facilities used in the study.  
The Investigator  must notify Lundbeck, without delay, of an announced inspection by a regulatory  
authority. During audits and inspections, the Investigator  must permit direct access to all the source 
documents, including medical records and other documents pertinent to the study.  
During audits and inspections, the auditors and inspectors may copy re levant parts of medical 
records. No personal identification apart from the screening or randomisation number will appear 
on these copies. Patient data will not be disclosed to unauthorised third parties, and patient 
confidentiality will be maintained at al l times.  
9. ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES  
9.1 Compliance with Good Clinical Practice and Ethical Considerations  
This study must be conducted in compliance with Institutional Review Board/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IRB/IEC) and International Committee on Harmonization (ICH) GCP Guidelines.  In 
addition, all local regulatory requirements will be adhered to, in particular those which afford 
greater protection to the safety of the study participants.  
This study will be conducted in general according to the De claration of Helsinki and with local 
laws and regulations relevant to the use of new therapeutic agents in the country of conduct.  
Before initiating a study, the Investigator/institution will have written and dated 
approval/favorable opinion from the IRB/I EC for the study protocol, written informed consent 
form, patient recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements), and data collection instruments which 
will be completed by patients.  Protocol amendments, consent form updates, and any amendments 
to the docu ments described before must be approved by the IRB/IEC prior to implementation 
unless such changes are necessary to address immediate safety concerns.  
9.2 Informed Consent  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to obtain written informed consent from eac h patient 
participating in this study, after adequate explanation of the aims, methods, potential benefits and 
any potential hazards of the study.  The informed consent procedure needs to be documented at

Page 69 each study site.  No study -related procedures, incl uding washout of any medications, may be 
performed prior to obtaining written informed consent.  
The Investigator must explain that the patients are completely free to refuse to enter the study or 
to withdraw from it at any time and for any reason.  Similar ly, the Investigator or Lundbeck is free 
to withdraw the patient from the study at any time for safety reasons.  Any other requirements 
necessary for the protection of the human rights of the patient will also be explained, according to 
current ICH GCP Gui delines.  
A sample copy of the patient information sheet and consent form will be provided by the sponsor. 
These documents may, however, be subject to country specific changes and the IRB/IECs may ask 
for them to be altered.  In this case, any modifications  are to be approved by Lundbeck.  A copy 
of the patient information sheet and consent form that is approved for this study by each IRB/IEC 
and Lundbeck will be kept by the CRO in the trial master file (TMF).  
9.3 Confidentiality of Patient Information  
All patie nts who provide written informed consent will be assigned a patient number.  
Subsequently, patients will be identified in the eCRFs only by their initials, date of birth, and their 
patient number (as allowed by local country regulations).  Any information published as a result 
of the study will be such that it will not permit identification of any patient.  The information from 
this study will be available within Lundbeck and may be shared with regulatory authorities.  It may 
also be the subject of an audit  by a regulatory agency, such as the Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA), within the local government.  The patient’s identity will remain protected except as 
required for legal or regulatory inquiries.  
9.4 Protocol Compliance  
Lundbeck has a “no -waiver” policy,  which means that permission will not be given to deviate from 
the protocol. If deviations occur, the Investigator  must inform the CRA and they must review, 
discuss, and document the implications of the deviation.  
9.5 Conditions For Modification of the Protocol  
Protocol modifications to an ongoing study that could potentially adversely affect the safety of 
participating patients, or that alter the scope of the investigation, the scientific quality of the study, 
the experimental design, dosages, duration of therapy, assessment variables, the number of patients 
treated or patient selection criteria must be made only after consultation with appropriate 
representatives of Lundbeck, the CRO, and the Investigator.  
Protocol modifications will be prepared, and re viewed by Lundbeck, and reviewed and signed by 
the Investigator.

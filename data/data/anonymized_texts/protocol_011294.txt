Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 4 of 121Abstract
TitlePhase II Study of Neoadjuvant Atezolizumab-based Immunotherapy 
for Patients with Urothelial Carcinoma (NEBULA)
Phase of StudyPhase II
Study DrugsAtezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody. Dose will be 1200mg IV given 
on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle x 3 doses. 
Tiragolumab, an anti-TIGIT antibody (Cohort B only). Dose will be 
600mg IV on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle x for up to 3 doses
Study PopulationSubjects with muscle-invasive urothelial cell carcinoma of the bladder
Study DesignThis is a single arm, open label multiple-cohort phase II study of 
atezolizumab, an anti-PD-L1 antibody, alone or in combination with 
tiragolumab, an anti-TIGIT antibody, administered as neoadjuvant 
therapy to patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma 
appropriate for cystectomy and either refusing or ineligible for 
neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Enrolled patients will 
receive atezolizumab (1200mg IV on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle) and, in 
the combination cohort, tiragolumab (600mg IV on Day 1 of a 21 day 
cycle) as neoadjuvant treatment for an intended total of three 
treatment cycles. 
As of October 2020 the atezolizumab monotherapy cohort (Cohort A) 
has completed dose escalation and is in dose expansion, and will 
accrue up to 27 total patients. Once amendment 4.3 (October 19th, 
2020) is approved patients will only be accrued to the combination 
cohort (Cohort B). 
For Cohort B there will be an initial safety lead in phase for 
combination treatment, detailed in Section 3.1. Once the intended 
treatment regimen is established following completion of the safety 
assessment, an additional 15 patients will be enrolled at the same 
regimen for a total of 21 patients in Cohort B at the established 
regimen. Consequently, a minimum of 21 and a maximum of 33 
patients will be enrolled in Cohort B.
After all neoadjuvant study therapy is administered, each patient will 
undergo radical cystectomy with pelvic lymph node dissection to 
evaluate pathologic response to treatment and for immunologic 
characterization in the resected tissue. 
All patients will undergo radical cystectomy within 12 weeks of the 
start of neoadjuvant treatment. Any delays in surgery beyond 12 
weeks from the start of neoadjuvant treatment that are thought to be 
treatment related will be considered an adverse event. Serum and 
urine will be obtained as well to characterize circulating immune

be followed clinically for up to 2 years with regular visits and imaging 
to assess for disease recurrence.
Primary ObjectivesCohort A (Atezolizumab Monotherapy): 
Multi-dose cohorts: To assess the intratumoral immune response 
associated with increasing numbers of Atezolizumab treatments. 
Expansion cohort: To assess the anti-tumor activity of Atezolizumab 
as determined by the pathologic T0 rate (pT0N0) at the time of 
cystectomy.
Cohort B (Atezolizumab + Tiragolumab): 
Multi-dose cohorts: To assess the safety of neoadjuvant combination 
treatment with atezolizumab and tiragolumab according to CTCAE 
v5.0 in cisplatin-ineligible patients with MIBC undergoing radical 
cystectomy.
Expansion cohort: To assess the anti-tumor activity of Atezolizumab + 
Tiragolumab as determined by the pathologic T0 rate (pT0N0) at the 
time of cystectomy.
Secondary 
ObjectivesCohorts A & B
Multi-dose cohorts: 
1. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of administering up to 3 
cycles of Atezolizumab pre-operatively to patients with resectable 
urothelial bladder cancer. Note this is the coprimary objective for 
Cohort B.
Expansion cohort:
1. To assess the anti-tumor activity of neoadjuvant treatment as 
determined by pathologic pathologic partial response (<pT2N0) 
assessed at the time of radical cystectomy
2. To determine the 2-year relapse-free survival (RFS) rate and 
median RFS from time of radical cystectomy in patients treated 
with neoadjuvant therapy

Unique Aspects of 
this StudyThis is the first study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
atezolizumab-based neoadjuvant therapy prior to radical cystectomy in 
patients with muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma who are either 
ineligible for or refusing cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Similarly it is 
the first study to provide a comprehensive characterization of the 
immunologic effects in the bladder tumor microenvironment of the 
neoadjuvant atezolizumab-based regimen      prior to radical 
cystectomy.

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 15 of 1211 Introduction
1.1 Background on Bladder Cancer
Urothelial cancer (UC) is the most common cancer of the urinary system worldwide with 
transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) being the predominant histologic type. It was estimated that in 
2013, there would be 72,570 new cases of bladder cancer and 15,210 deaths in the United 
States.1 Non-muscle invasive disease (stages Ta, T1, or carcinoma in situ (CIS)) accounts for 
approximately half of new diagnoses, muscle-invasive disease (stages T2-4) accounts for 
approximately 35% of new diagnoses, and metastatic disease accounts for the remainder. 
When confined to the bladder itself UC is a curable disease, although treatment approaches 
differ depending on the presence of muscle invasion as discussed below.
1.2 Treatment of Muscle Invasive Bladder Cancer (MIBC)
Although bladder tumors that are non-muscle invasive are treated with intravesical treatments 
such as BCG; due to the depth of invasion, intravesical treatments are inadequate for patients 
with muscle-invasive disease. Therefore, more definitive therapy is needed. Although 
concurrent chemoradiation may be used for patients who are not surgical candidates or for 
those desiring bladder preservation, radical cystectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy is 
considered the standard of care. The addition of neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy has 
been associated with both improved overall survival as well as a lower risk of recurrence.2 This 
was illustrated in a randomized Phase III study in which 3 cycles of neoadjuvant MVAC 
(methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, cisplatin) chemotherapy increased the pathologic T0 
rate from 15% to 38% (p<0.001) and was associated with a trend toward increased median 
survival (46 vs. 77 months, p=0.06) when compared to surgery alone.3 Importantly, in this study 
a pathologic complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant therapy was associated with both a 
disease-free and an overall- survival benefit, suggesting that downstaging tumors prior to 
surgery may confer long term benefit. An analysis of 11 randomized trials of cisplatin-based 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy concluded neoadjuvant therapy confers a modest survival benefit 
(OS, hazard ratio [HR] for mortality 0.87, 95% CI 0.78-0.98) corresponding to an absolute 
survival benefit of 5%, and a modest reduction in the risk of recurrence (HR for recurrence 0.81, 
95% CI 0.74- 0.90), corresponding to an absolute disease-free survival benefit of 7%.2
Despite these benefits associated with chemotherapy prior to cystectomy, nationally less than 
20% of patients undergoing radical cystectomy for MIBC actually receive neoadjuvant therapy.4, 
5  Among concerns include advanced patient age, comorbidities, concerns over chemotherapy 
toxicity, and the modest nature of benefit from chemotherapy.6 Similarly there is no neoadjuvant 
standard of care for patients with marginal renal function, advanced hearing loss, or significant 
peripheral neuropathy that makes them ineligible for cisplatin therapy. Therefore, novel 
approaches for these patients are needed.
1.3 PD-L1 Immune Checkpoint Blockade
Encouraging clinical data emerging in the field of tumor immunotherapy have demonstrated that 
therapies focused on enhancing T-cell responses against cancer can result in a significant 
survival benefit, and in recent years immunotherapeutic have been approved for multiple solid 
tumors including prostate cancer and melanoma.7-9
PD-L1 is an extracellular protein expressed on multiple tissues that downregulates immune 
responses primarily in peripheral tissues through binding to its two receptors PD-1 and B7.1. 
PD-1 is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T-cells following T-cell activation, which is

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 16 of 121sustained in states of chronic stimulation such as in chronic infection or cancer.10, 11  Ligation of 
PD-L1 with PD-1 inhibits T-cell proliferation, cytokine production, and cytolytic activity, leading to 
the functional inactivation or exhaustion of T cells. B7.1 is a molecule expressed on antigen-
presenting cells and activated T cells. PD-L1 binding to B7.1 on T cells  and antigen-presenting 
cells can mediate downregulation of immune responses, including inhibition of T-cell activation 
and cytokine production.12, 13 
In cancer PD-L1 expression is prevalent in many human tumors, and overexpression of PD-L1 
on tumor cells has been reported to impede anti-tumor immunity, resulting in immune evasion.10 
In UC elevated PD-L1 expression on tumor cells is associated with a increased pathologic 
stage, and PD-L1 expression predicts all causes-mortality after cystectomy for patients with 
organ-confined tumors.14, 15  
1.4 Background on Atezolizumab
Atezolizumab is a human immunoglobulin (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that is produced in 
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. It targets programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on antigen-
presenting cells or tumor cells and prevents interaction with programmed death−1 (PD-1) 
receptor, which is an inhibitory receptor expressed on T cells. Atezolizumab also blocks the 
interaction between PD-L1 and B7.1. Interference of the PD-L1:PD-1 and PD-L1:B7.1 
interactions may enhance the magnitude and quality of the tumor-specific T-cell response 
through increased T-cell priming, expansion, and/or effector function.
Atezolizumab was engineered to eliminate Fc-effector function via a single amino acid 
substitution at position 298 on the heavy chain, which results in a non-glycosylated antibody that 
has minimal binding to Fc receptors and, consequently, eliminates detectable Fc‑effector 
function.
1.4.1 Non-Clinical Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism and Toxicology
The pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of atezolizumab have been investigated in 
several nonclinical studies.  Atezolizumab binds to recombinant human and murine PD-L1 with 
subnanomolar affinity (Kd = 0.433 nM and 0.134 nM, respectively) and with comparable affinity 
to PD-L1 on cynomolgus monkey (Macaca fascicularis) T cells (50% effective concentration 
[EC50] = 0.704 nM).  Atezolizumab does not induce cytokine release from human peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) following in vitro culture with immobilized or soluble 
atezolizumab. Two chimeric derivatives of atezolizumab (PRO304397, PRO314483) were 
generated to assess efficacy in mouse models with minimal interference of murine antibodies 
directed to human IgG.
Studies were conducted to assess the potential of PD-L1 blockade to enhance anti-tumor 
immunity when administered to mice with established tumors of colorectal and melanoma origin 
in three different genetic strains of mice. Anti−PD-L1 induced complete regression of 
immunogenic MC38 colorectal tumors and up to 60% overall responses in mice with unmodified 
established MC38 tumors. Tumor growth inhibition rates from 76% to 119% were observed and 
time to progression was increased by 1.75- to 3-fold in response to anti−PD-L1. Therefore, 
blockade of PD-L1 represents a compelling strategy for enhancing anti-tumor T-cell responses 
for the treatment of solid tumors.
In addition to the nonclinical tumor efficacy studies described above, the activity of anti−PD-L1 
was also evaluated in mouse infection models. Initial in vivo studies assessed the efficacy of 
atezolizumab in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV). When anti−PD-

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 17 of 121L1 was administered during the chronic phase of LCMV CL-13 infection, the antibody was 
effective in enhancing T-cell function and reducing viral load without evidence of toxicity. 
However, blockade of PD-L1 at the peak of the acute T-cell response and concomitant peak 
viremia following LCMV CL-13 infection resulted in a mortality rate of 80%−100%. Published 
and internal data show that these mortalities are not unique to this molecule or pathway since 
similar mortalities are observed in this model with other PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors, as well as 
with IL-216. Rather, the data suggest that the mortalities observed in the acute CL-13 infection 
model are mediated by enhanced CD8+ T-cell function in the presence of extremely high viral 
burden in multiple organs thereby compromising vascular integrity leading to circulatory system 
collapse.17 The unique features of the murine CL-13 infection model contribute significantly to 
these deaths, and these features are not representative of the vast majority of viral infections 
that affect humans.
1.4.2 Toxicology and Safety Pharmacology
The toxicology program was designed to support clinical administration of Atezolizumab for up 
to 2 months when administered intravenously or subcutaneously to patients and consisted of 
the following:
●A 15-day pilot study in mice
●An 8-week repeat-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys
●An in vitro hemolytic potential assay
●A tissue cross-reactivity analysis of human and cynomolgus monkey 
tissues.
The mouse was considered the preferred rodent species in which to test the toxicity of 
Atezolizumab because the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway has been characterized more extensively in 
mice than in rats. The nonclinical efficacy studies were conducted in mice, as the known biology 
is more comparable to that in humans. Additionally, the availability of murine- specific reagents 
enabled an extensive immune response characterization. The pilot study demonstrated a high 
level of immunogenicity in mice. The immune response to Atezolizumab resulted in rapid drug 
clearance in a pilot mouse study in C57BL/6 and CD-1 mice, which would confound 
interpretation of immune system consequences of blocking PD-L1/PD-1 in a study of longer 
than 2 weeks; thus, the use of this species was precluded in studies of > 2 weeks for 
assessment of general toxicity. Because Atezolizumab binds to PD-L1 in cynomolgus monkeys 
and humans with comparable affinity, the cynomolgus monkey was chosen as the most 
appropriate species to assess the systemic toxicity of Atezolizumab. At necropsy, arteritis was 
observed in 3 animals at the 50 mg/kg dose and 1 animal at the 15 mg/kg dose. These 
histological findings were not associated with any clinical signs or symptoms. As no arteritis was 
found in animals treated with 5 mg/kg, this dose level was identified as the NOAEL. All other 
findings were considered incidental and not drug related. Overall, Atezolizumab was clinically 
well tolerated by cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 50 mg/kg for 8 weeks (total of nine doses) 
(Study 08-1148).
The Phase I starting dose of 0.01 mg/kg was based on nonclinical PK/PD data that projected 
~80% receptor occupancy at the Cmax of this dose (unpublished data) and was supported by 
the toxicology data. On the basis of this starting dose, a safety factor of 160-fold based on BSA 
was determined as it relates to the NOAEL of 5 mg/kg in the 8-week, repeat dose GLP toxicity 
study in cynomolgus monkeys.

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 18 of 1211.5 Clinical Studies of Atezolizumab
There are multiple ongoing studies of Atezolizumab, and it has received accelerated FDA 
approval for the treatment of urothelial cancer. Details of all studies may be found in the 
Atezolizumab Investigator’s Brochure (IB). Briefly, in patients with metastatic disease, the 
IMvigor 210 study18 enrolled 310 subjects with inoperable locally advanced or metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma whose disease had progressed after previous platinum-based 
chemotherapy. These patients received atezolizumab 1200mg IV every 3 weeks. The PD-L1 
expression status on infiltrating immune cells (ICs) in the tumor microenvironment was defined 
by the percentage of PD-L1-positive immune cells: IC0 (<1%), IC1 (≥1% but <5%), and IC2/3 
(≥5%). The primary analysis showed that compared with a historical control overall response 
rate of 10%, treatment with atezolizumab resulted in a significantly improved RECIST v1.1 
objective response rate for each prespecified immune cell group (IC2/3: 27% [95% CI 19–37], 
p<0·0001; IC1/2/3: 18% [13–24], p=0·0004) and in all patients (15% [11–20], p=0·0058). With 
longer follow-up (data cutoff Sept 14, 2015), by independent review, objective response rates 
were 26% (95% CI 18–36) in the IC2/3 group, 18% (13–24) in the IC1/2/3 group, and 15% (11–
19) overall in all 310 patients. With a median follow-up of 11.7 months (95% CI 11·4–12·2), 
ongoing responses were recorded in 38 (84%) of 45 responders. Exploratory analyses showed 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) subtypes and mutation load to be independently predictive 
for response to atezolizumab. Grade 3–4 treatment-related adverse events, of which fatigue 
was the most common (five patients [2%]), occurred in 50 (16%) of 310 treated patients. Grade 
3–4 immune-mediated adverse events occurred in 15 (5%) of 310 treated patients, with 
pneumonitis, increased aspartate aminotransferase, increased alanine aminotransferase, rash, 
and dyspnea being the most common. No treatment-related deaths occurred during the study. 
Similar studies including IMvigor 211 and SAUL have demonstrated comparable results. 
In the neoadjuvant setting one study in addition to this trial explored the value of atezolizumab 
as monotherapy. The ABACUS study19 was an open-label, international, multicenter, single-
arm, neoadjuvant phase 2 trial evaluating the effects of two cycles (1,200 mg, three times 
weekly) of preoperative atezolizumab in patients with histologically confirmed (T2–T4aN0M0) 
transitional cell UC of the bladder, awaiting planned radical cystectomy. Additional eligibility 
criteria included residual disease after TURBT, adequate fitness for planned cystectomy 
(according to local guidelines), ineligibility for or refusal of cisplatin-based neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, no evidence of nodal or metastatic disease on cross-sectional imaging, ECOG 
performance status of 0 or 1, and adequate hematologic and end-organ function within 4 weeks 
of the first study treatment. Major exclusion criteria included evidence of significant uncontrolled 
concomitant disease that could affect compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, 
previous autoimmune disease, ongoing active infections or prior use of immune checkpoint 
inhibitors. Pathological complete response was the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints 
focused on safety, relapse-free survival and biomarker analysis. The pathological complete 
response rate was 31% (95% confidence interval: 21–41%). Baseline biomarkers showed that 
the presence of preexisting activated T cells was more prominent than expected and correlated 
with outcome. Other established biomarkers, such as tumor mutational burden, did not predict 
outcome, differentiating this from the metastatic setting. Dynamic changes to gene expression 
signatures and protein biomarkers occurred with therapy, whereas changes in DNA alterations 
with treatment were uncommon. Responding tumors showed predominant expression of genes 
related to tissue repair after treatment, making tumor biomarker interpretation challenging in this 
group. Stromal factors such as transforming growth factor-β and fibroblast activation protein 
were linked to resistance, as was high expression of cell cycle gene signatures after treatment.

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 19 of 121A similarly designed study, the PURE-01 trial20, also accrued patients with MIBC to receive 
neoadjuvant PD-1 checkpoint inhibition. Patients had a predominant urothelial carcinoma 
histology and clinical (c)T≤3bN0 stage tumor. They received three cycles of pembrolizumab (a 
PD-1 inhibitor) 200 mg every 3 weeks before RC. The primary end point in the intention-to-treat 
population was pathologic complete response (pT0). Biomarker analyses included programmed 
death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression using the combined positive score (CPS; Dako 22C3 
pharmDx assay), genomic sequencing, and an immune gene expression assay. Fifty patients 
were enrolled from February 2017 to March 2018. Twenty-seven patients (54%) had cT3 tumor, 
21 (42%) cT2 tumor, and two (4%) cT2-3N1 tumor. One patient (2%) experienced a grade 3 
transaminase increase and discontinued pembrolizumab. All patients underwent RC; there were 
21 patients with pT0 (42%; 95% CI, 28.2% to 56.8%). As a secondary end point, downstaging to 
<pT2 was achieved in 27 patients (54%; 95% CI, 39.3% to 68.2%). In 54.3% of patients with 
PD-L1 CPS ≥ 10% (n = 35), RC indicated pT0, whereas RC indicated pT0 in only 13.3% of 
those with CPS < 10% (n = 15). A significant nonlinear association between tumor mutation 
burden (TMB) and pT0 was observed, with a cutoff at 15 mutations/Mb. Expression of several 
genes in pretherapy lesions was significantly different between pT0 and non-pT0 cohorts. 
Significant post-therapy changes in the TMB and evidence of adaptive mechanisms of immune 
resistance were observed in residual tumors.
1.6 Background and Clinical Studies of Tiragolumab
Tiragolumab is a fully human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)/kappa mAb derived in Open 
Monoclonal Technology (OMT) rats that binds T-cell Immunoreceptor with Immunoglobulin and 
Immunoreceptor Tyrosine-Based Inhibition Motif [ITIM] domains (TIGIT) and prevents its 
interaction with the poliovirus receptor (PVR). The recombinant antibody is produced in Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells and consists of two heavy chains (456 amino acid residues each) 
and two light chains (220 amino acid residues each). 
The inhibitory immunoreceptor TIGIT has been shown to limit the effector function of tumor-
associated lymphocytes. TIGIT is an immunoglobulin (Ig) super family member expressed on 
subsets of activated T cells and natural killer (NK) cells, and found highly expressed in tumor 
tissue and in tumor-infiltrating immune cells in many human cancers, including, but not limited to 
NSCLC, breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In multiple tumor types, 
TIGIT is coordinately expressed with PD-121-23. Genetic ablation or antibody blockade of TIGIT 
has been shown to enhance NK cell killing, CD4 and CD8 T-cell activation, and effector 
function in vitro and in vivo in nonclinical models.21, 22, 24, 25 In the nonclinical tumor models, 
TIGIT interacted with high affinity to CD155 (also known as PVR), which also has an activating 
counter-receptor CD226. Activation of TIGIT on T cells and NK cells was demonstrated to limit 
proliferation, effector cytokine production, and killing of target tumor cells.21, 22, 24
Therapeutic blockade of TIGIT by tiragolumab represents an attractive strategy for cancer 
therapy and is expected to enhance the magnitude and quality of the tumor-specific T-cell 
responses, which may result in improved meaningful anti-tumor activity when tiragolumab is 
used in combination with other cancer immunotherapies and administered with chemotherapy. 
The available nonclinical and clinical data provide a strong rationale for evaluating the potential 
clinical benefit of tiragolumab in cancer patients. Refer to the tiragolumab Investigator’s 
Brochure for details on nonclinical studies. 
Clinically study GO3010326 is a first-in-human, open-label, multicenter, global, dose-
escalation/dose-expansion Phase I study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of tiragolumab as a single agent (Phase Ia) and in combination with

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 20 of 121atezolizumab (Phase Ib) in patients with locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic incurable 
tumors, including urothelial cancer, renal cell cancer, NSCLC, head and neck squamous cell 
carcinoma, esophageal cancer, colorectal cancer (CRC), gastric cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, 
and triple-negative breast cancer. 
As of the data cutoff date of 3 December 2018, 42 patients had received tiragolumab 
monotherapy at doses of 2−1200 mg, and 164 patients had received tiragolumab at doses of 
2−600  mg in combination with 1200-mg atezolizumab. The best observed response with 
tiragolumab monotherapy was prolonged stable disease in 8 of 42 patients, with some patients 
(including 1 patient with CRC) experiencing a decrease in tumor size. Among 164 patients 
receiving tiragolumab in combination with atezolizumab, a complete response was observed in 
3 patients (including 1 patient with esophageal cancer), a partial response was observed in 22 
patients (including patients with esophageal cancer), and stable disease was observed in 38 
patients. Among 4 patients with urothelial cancer receiving tiragolumab in combination with 
atezolizumab, a confirmed partial response was observed in 3 patients. 
No maximum tolerated dose, dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs), or clear dose-related trends in the 
incidence or severity of adverse events have been determined for tiragolumab as a single agent 
or in combination with atezolizumab. A fatal case of hepatic toxicity culminating in fulminant liver 
failure occurred in a patient with metastatic head and neck cancer receiving single-agent 
tiragolumab at the highest dose cleared for enrollment (1200 mg) (see the tiragolumab IB for 
details). No other fatal cases of fulminant liver failure have been observed. 
Overall, tiragolumab as a single agent or in combination with atezolizumab has been well 
tolerated, adverse events have been manageable, and the safety profile is observed to be 
consistent across different solid tumor indications. 
A second study GO4029027 is a global, multicenter, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled 
Phase II study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of tiragolumab plus atezolizumab 
compared with placebo plus atezolizumab in patients with previously untreated, locally 
advanced unresectable, or metastatic PD-L1−selected NSCLC. 
As of the primary clinical cutoff date of 30 June 2019, a total of 135 patients with a PD-L1 TPS ≥ 
1% were included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population and were randomly assigned to receive 
tiragolumab plus atezolizumab (n  67) or placebo plus atezolizumab (n  68). Of the enrolled 
patients, 43.0% of patients had a TPS ≥ 50% relative to 57.0% of patients with a TPS 1%−49%, 
59.3% had non-squamous histology compared with 40.7% of patients who had squamous 
histology, and 10.4% of patients were never- smokers versus 89.6% who had smoked. These 
three stratification factors were well balanced between treatment groups. Demographics were 
also generally well balanced between treatment groups, with a median age of 68 years in both 
the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab and placebo plus atezolizumab arms. There were more 
females (41.8% vs. 29.4%) and more White patients (62.7% vs. 58.8%) in the tiragolumab plus 
atezolizumab arm compared with the placebo plus atezolizumab arm. 
In the ITT population, the confirmed ORR was higher in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab arm 
(31.3%) than in the placebo plus atezolizumab arm (16.2%). In the subgroup of patients with 
TPS ≥  50%, the confirmed ORR was higher in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab arm (n  29; 
55.2% [95% CI: 35.4%, 75.0%]) than the placebo plus atezolizumab arm (n  29; 17.2% [95% 
CI: 1.8%, 32.7%]). Of note, responders in the tiragolumab plus atezolizumab arm included 
patients with both squamous and non-squamous histology.

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 22 of 121●Multi-dose phase (fully accrued as of October 2020): A fixed number of 6 
patients will be accrued at each dose level in the multi-dose portion of the 
study to allow for investigation into the immunologic impact of different 
cumulative doses of atezolizumab prior to cystectomy. It is unknown 
whether multiple doses of atezolizumab are necessary to achieve a 
complete response or a durable remission as opposed to a single dose, 
and accrual of 6 patients at each dose level will allow for a preliminary 
estimate of the efficacy of each cumulative dose level. The safety profile 
of atezolizumab is well established from multiple Phase I - III studies, and 
treatment related Grade 3 or 4 toxicities were rare. The multi- dose 
portion may better inform future studies of neoadjuvant atezolizumab and 
potentially allow for shorter neoadjuvant courses to be administered.
●Cohort A expansion phase opened after the multi-dose portion of Cohort 
A completed, consisting of up to 27 total patients in Cohort A. In order to 
reduce the number of subjects needed for this study and allow for faster 
study completion, the 6 subjects treated at the highest dose from the 
multi-dose phase of the study will be included as part of the expansion 
cohorts, therefore the total accrual to the expansion cohort after the multi-
dose portion of Cohort A will be up to 9 subjects. The highest dose level 
is chosen for the expansion cohorts as it is expected that administration 
of multiple doses of atezolizumab will best enhance immune responses 
and lead to better clinical responses. These expansion cohorts will allow 
for a better estimate that treatment-related grade 3 or 4 events, or delays 
in cystectomy >12 weeks, are observed at a frequency of less than 
<33%. It will also allow for an exploratory estimation of efficacy of 
atezolizumab in this setting, and for further characterization of the 
immunologic effects of atezolizumab in this patient population.
Cohort B: Atezolizumab + Tiragolumab
After completion of enrollment into Cohort A, and upon approval of Amendment 4.3 (October 19, 
2020) the study will begin accrual into Cohort B, where participants will receive combination 
neoadjuvant therapy with atezolizumab (1200mg IV on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle) and 
tiragolumab (600mg IV on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle) as neoadjuvant treatment for an intended 
total of three treatment cycles prior to an intended radical cystectomy. Similar to Cohort A, the 
safety and efficacy of administering up to 3 doses of atezolizumab in combination with 
tiragolumab preoperatively in patients scheduled for cystectomy will be examined. No adjuvant 
therapy will be offered as no study to date has shown benefit for adjuvant PD-1 therapy in 
urothelial cancer patients who had received prior immunotherapy.28 Recently Checkmate-274 
study had a press release indicating a DFS benefit for nivolumab over placebo for high-risk 
patients with urothelial cancer following radical cystectomy however none of these patients have 
had prior neoadjuvant immunotherapy.
●Safety Lead-in: As adding tiragolumab together with atezolizumab in 
patients with NSCLC generates only minimal additive toxicity, this study 
will start with an initial safety lead-in of 6 patients at which time enrollment 
will pause to assess the safety of this combination treatment. If dose 
limiting toxicities are met (certain AEs or surgery delay, as defined in 
Section 5.4) then fewer doses of tiragolumab will be evaluated (See 
Cohort B Safety Lead-in Schema).

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 23 of 121●Expansion: Once the intended treatment regimen is established following 
completion of the safety assessment, an additional 15 patients will be

regimen.
1.9 Correlative Studies
In addition to evaluating the change in immunologic infiltration in tumor tissues induced by study 
therapy, the safety, toxicity, and efficacy of neoadjuvant atezolizumab-based therapy, this study 
aims to more thoroughly characterize the immunologic response induced by treatment with 
study therapy.
More specifically, bladder tissue taken at the time of surgery and peripheral blood will be 
analyzed immunohistochemically and genomically in order to:
1.Characterize the tumor and immune cell subsets
2.Explore the location of tumor infiltration lymphocytes (e.g. within tumors, at tumor 
periphery)
3.Characterize T cell receptor diversity
4.Explore the correlation of tumor PD-L1 expression across different grades and stages of 
disease with response to therapy.
In addition, serum and blood will be analyzed to determine whether antigen-specific immune 
responses are modulated and to quantify and characterize circulating immune cell subsets.

3 Study Design
3.1 Characteristics
This is a single arm, open-label multiple-cohort Phase II study of atezolizumab-based 
neoadjuvant therapy in subjects with muscle-invasive bladder cancer appropriate for cystectomy 
and refusing or ineligible for neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This study has two 
cohorts (Cohort A and Cohort B) and will accrue each cohort sequentially (i.e., Cohort A will fully 
accrue, then Cohort B). Cohort A participants will receive neoadjuvant atezolizumab 
monotherapy and Cohort B participants will receive combination neoadjuvant treatment with 
atezolizumab and tiragolumab. As of October 2020, Cohort A has finished dose escalation and 
is in dose-expansion. 
Following the administration of all intended neoadjuvant treatment regimen, participants will 
undergo cystectomy to evaluate pathologic response to treatment and for immunologic 
characterization in the resected tissue. Surgery should be performed within 12 weeks from the 
start of neoadjuvant treatment. Any treatment-related delays that put the surgery outside of this 
window will be considered an adverse event.
Serum and urine will be obtained as well to characterize circulating immune responses. Patients 
will be followed clinically for up to 2 years to assess for disease recurrence.
While adjuvant Atezolizumab was initially offered to patients in Cohort A who had pT3/pT4 or 
pN+ disease, given the lack of efficacy of adjuvant atezolizumab observed in the IMvigor 010 
trial, no further adjuvant therapy will be offered to patients.
Cohort A (Atezolizumab monotherapy) 
●Multi-dose phase (fully accrued): Enrolled patients will be assigned sequentially to 
atezolizumab dose levels in cohorts of 6 patients per dose level. The starting dose level 
is 1200mg x 1 dose and will be escalated in subsequent cohorts to 1200mg q 3 weeks x 
2 doses, and finally 1200mg q 3 weeks x 3 doses.
●Expansion phase: After completion of the multi-dose phase, Cohort A expansion will 
open and up to 27 enrolled participants will receive atezolizumab 1200mg q 3 weeks x 3 
doses prior to cystectomy.
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 27 of 121Cohort B (Atezolizumab + tiragolumab)
After completion of Cohort A, Cohort B will open and enrolled patients will receive atezolizumab 
(1200mg IV on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle) and tiragolumab (600mg IV on Day 1 of a 21 day cycle) 
as neoadjuvant treatment for an intended total of three treatment cycles prior to an intended 
radical cystectomy. 
●Safety Lead-in (see schema below): 
oDose Level 1 (Atezolizumab 1200 mg x 3 cycles, Tiragolumab 600 mg x 3 
cycles): There will be an initial safety lead in of 6 patients treated with this 
regimen, at which time enrollment will pause to assess the safety of this 
combination treatment. As long as no more than 1 out of the initial 6 patients 
experience dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) or a delay in the time to radical 
cystectomy, the remaining patients will enroll at the same dose and regimen. 
▪If two or more patients out of the initial six experience DLTs within the 
first  cycle (3 weeks), accrual will be halted and the combination 
reevaluated.
▪If two or more patients out of the initial six experience DLTs within the 
first 2 cycles (6 weeks), accrual to this dose level will be halted and 
we will move to dose level 3.
▪If two or more patients out of the initial six experience DLTs or delay 
in the time to radical cystectomy, and no more than 1 patient 
experienced DLTs during the first 2 cycles (6 weeks), the next six 
patients will be treated at dose level 2
oDose Level 2 (Atezolizumab 1200 mg x 3 cycles, Tiragolumab 600 mg x 2 
cycles): As long as no more than 1 out of 6 patients experience DLTs or a 
delay in the time to radical cystectomy with this treatment, the remaining 
patients will enroll at the same dose and regimen. 
▪If two or more patients out of the six patients experience DLTs within 
the first cycle (3 weeks), accrual will be halted and the combination 
reevaluated.
▪If two or more patients out of the six experience DLTs or delay in the 
time to radical cystectomy, and no more than 1 patient experienced 
DLTs during the first cycle (3 weeks),  the next six patients will be 
treated at dose level 3 
oDose Level 3 (Atezolizumab 1200 mg x 3 cycles, Tiragolumab 600 mg x 1 
cycle): This will be the selected regimen if no more than 1 out of 6 patients 
experience DLTs or a delay in the time to radical cystectomy. However if 2 or 
more patients experience DLTs or a delay in the time to radical cystectomy 
with this combination regimen, then accrual will be halted and the 
combination reevaluated. 
●Expansion: Once the intended treatment regimen is established following completion of 
the safety assessment, an additional 15 patients will be enrolled at the same regimen for 
a total of 21 patients on that treatment regimen.

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 33 of 1213.5 Duration of Follow Up
Participants will be followed for 2 years after cystectomy, removal from study, or until death, 
whichever occurs first. Participants removed from study for unacceptable treatment related 
adverse event(s) will be followed until resolution or stabilization of all treatment related adverse 
events to Grade 2 or lower.
3.6 Primary Completion 
It is expected that the study will reach primary completion about 14-19 months from the time

another 3 months from enrollment of last patient to cystectomy.
3.7 Study Completion
It is expected that the study will reach full completion 41-46 months from the time Cohort B 
opens to accrual.
4 Study Drugs
4.1 Description, Supply and Storage 
4.1.1 Atezolizumab
Classification
Atezolizumab is a human monoclonal antibody based on a human IgG1 framework containing 
heavy chain VHIII and light chain VκI subgroup sequences. The recombinant antibody consists 
of two heavy chains (448 amino acid residues each) and two light chains (214 amino acid 
residues each) with inter- and intra-chain disulfide bonds that are typical of IgG1 antibodies.
Atezolizumab incorporates an amino acid substitution (asparagine to alanine) at position 298 in 
the CH2 domain of each heavy chain resulting in a non-glycosylated antibody that has minimal 
binding to Fcγ receptors and, consequently, prevents Fc-effector function and depletion of cells 
expressing PD-L1 at expected concentrations in humans. Therefore, atezolizumab lacks the N- 
linked oligosaccharides typically observed on other CHO-derived monoclonal antibodies.
Mechanism of Action
Atezolizumab targets programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) on antigen-presenting cells or tumor 
cells and prevents interaction with programmed death−1 (PD-1) receptor, which is an inhibitory 
receptor expressed on T cells. Atezolizumab also blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and 
B7.1. Interference of the PD-L1:PD-1 and PD-L1:B7.1 interactions may enhance the magnitude 
and quality of the tumor-specific T-cell response through increased T-cell priming, expansion, 
and/or effector function.
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism
Serum Atezolizumab concentrations exhibited a biphasic disposition with an initial rapid 
distribution phase followed by a slow elimination phase. Atezolizumab exhibited nonlinear 
pharmacokinetics at doses < 1 mg/kg (i.e., 0.03−0.3 mg/kg), likely due to target-mediated CL at 
lower concentrations. Atezolizumab exhibited linear pharmacokinetics at doses ≥ 1 mg/kg. At

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 34 of 121doses ≥ 1 mg/kg, the mean Cmax increased in a dose-proportional manner and was 26.0 μg/mL 
for the 1-mg/kg dose group and 486 μg/mL for the 20-mg/kg dose group. Similarly, at doses ≥ 1 
mg/kg, the group mean AUC0-∞ had a range of 340−6050 day × μg/mL for 1-mg/kg and 20- 
mg/kg dose group and was approximately dose proportional, as evidenced by similar CL across 
the dose range. The observed CL and Vss for Atezolizumab at doses ≥ 1 mg/kg are consistent 
with these of a typical IgG1 antibody in humans. The development of anti-therapeutic antibodies 
(ATAs) has been observed in patients in all dose cohorts and was associated with changes in 
pharmacokinetics for some patients in the lower dose cohorts (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg). Patients 
dosed at the 10-, 15-, and 20-mg/kg dose levels have maintained the expected target trough 
levels of drug despite the detection of ATAs. Accordingly, the development of detectable ATAs 
does not appear to have a clinically significant impact on pharmacokinetics for doses from 10 to 
20 mg/kg. To date, no relationship between the development of measurable ATAs and safety or 
efficacy has been observed.
The expected metabolic products of proteins and peptides, including IgG1 monoclonal 
antibodies such as atezolizumab, are small peptides and individual amino acids. Cytochrome 
P450 enzymes as well as conjugation/glucuronidation reactions are not involved in the 
metabolism of Atezolizumab.
Contraindications
Atezolizumab is contraindicated for patients with the following:
History of severe allergic anaphylactic reactions to chimeric, human or humanized 
antibodies, or fusion proteins
Known hypersensitivity to CHO cell products or any component of the atezolizumab 
formulation.
As with all investigational products, unknown side effects may occur. Patients should be 
monitored closely throughout their participation in clinical studies of Atezolizumab.
Availability
The atezolizumab drug product is provided in a single-use, 20-mL USP/Ph. Eur. Type 1 glass 
vial as a colorless to slightly yellow, sterile, preservative-free clear liquid solution intended for IV 
administration. The vial is designed to deliver 20 mL (1200 mg) of Atezolizumab solution but 
may contain more than the stated volume to enable delivery of the entire 20 mL volume. The  
Atezolizumab drug product is formulated as 60 mg/mL atezolizumab in 20 mM histidine acetate, 
120 mM sucrose, 0.04% polysorbate 20, pH 5.8.
Atezolizumab will be delivered in infusion bags with IV infusion lines with product contacting 
surfaces of polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyolefin and 0.2 μm in-line filters (filter membrane of 
polyethersulfone [PES]). No incompatibilities have been observed between v and PVC or 
polyolefin infusion materials (bags and infusion lines).
For further details, see the Atezolizumab Pharmacy Manual and IB. 
Storage and handling
Atezolizumab must be refrigerated at 2°C-8°C (36°F-46°F) upon receipt until use.  Atezolizumab 
vials should not be used beyond the expiration date provided by the manufacturer. No 
preservative is used in the Atezolizumab drug product; therefore, each vial is intended for single

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 35 of 121use only. Vial contents should not be frozen or shaken and should be protected from direct 
sunlight.
Side Effects
Potential risks associated with Atezolizumab described here are based on observed nonclinical 
toxicities and adverse events observed in ongoing clinical trial(s) of Atezolizumab, as well as 
clinical toxicities related to monoclonal antibodies targeting the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway. Adverse 
events that have occurred within 24 hours after infusion include: infusion reactions, 
hypertension, fatigue, decreased appetite and headache.
Therapy with Atezolizumab may increase the risk of immune-related adverse events (IRAEs), 
including rash, hypothyroidism, hepatitis/transaminitis and colitis. Subjects should therefore be 
carefully monitored for evidence of clinically significant systemic IRAEs (e.g., SLE−like 
diseases) or organ-specific IRAEs (e.g., rash, colitis, uveitis, hepatitis, or thyroid disease).
Suggested workup for suspected IRAEs includes evaluation of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, 
liver, skin, eye, and pituitary and adrenal glands. Specific management of IRAEs is provided 
later in the protocol.
In addition, specific management for the toxicities occurring in the following organ systems is 
provided in this protocol: gastrointestinal tract (diarrhea, colitis), pulmonary (pneumonitis), 
hepato-biliary (hepatitis, pancreatitis), and dermatologic (rash, pruritus, severe cutaneous 
adverse reactions (SCARs)).
4.1.2 Tiragolumab
Classification
Tiragolumab is a fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody. The recombinant antibody is produced 
in CHO cells, and consists of two heavy chains (456 amino acid residues each) and two light 
chains (220 amino acid residues each). There are two N-linked glycosylation sites (Asn306) in 
the Fc domain.
Mechanism of Action
Tiragolumab binds to TIGIT and prevents its interaction with Poliovirus receptor (PVR). The 
inhibitory immunoreceptor TIGIT has been shown to limit the effector function of tumor-
associated lymphocytes.
Pharmacokinetics and Metabolism
Preliminary population-PK analyses show that tiragolumab exposures increased approximately 
dose-proportionally following IV administration at doses ranging from 100 to 1200 mg Q3W as 
monotherapy or in combination with 1200 mg Q3W atezolizumab. Preliminary population-PK 
analysis estimated tiragolumab clearance at 0.28 L/day with a linear drug elimination half-life of 
approximately 15 days.
Contraindications
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 36 of 121Tiragolumab is contraindicated for patients with a history of severe allergic anaphylactic 
reactions to chimeric, human, humanized antibodies, or fusion proteins because of the potential 
for severe reactions.
Availability
The tiragolumab drug product will be supplied in single-use, 15-mL glass vials. The vials contain 
10 mL of tiragolumab drug product and are buffered in histidine solution containing polysorbate 
20, sucrose, L-methionine, and WFI. The approximate concentration of tiragolumab antibody in 
the vials is 60 mg/mL. 
Storage and handling
The recommended storage condition for the tiragolumab drug product is 2°C-8°C (36°F–46°F). 
Do not shake or freeze IV bags containing dose solution. Protect from direct sunlight (exposure 
to indoor ambient light is acceptable).
Tiragolumab must be prepared for dosing under appropriate aseptic conditions as it does not 
contain antimicrobial preservatives. The dose solution should be used immediately. If not used 
immediately, the total storage time of the dose solution prior to administration should not exceed 
24 hours to limit the risk of microbial growth in case of accidental contamination. 
Side Effects
IRRs have been reported in patients treated with tiragolumab, with or without atezolizumab.  
The majority of events were mild to moderate and manageable.      As an antagonist of TIGIT, 
tiragolumab is anticipated to enhance T-cell and NK cell proliferation, survival, and function. 
Therefore, tiragolumab may increase the risk of autoimmune inflammation (also described as 
immune-mediated AEs [imAEs]). In addition, due to the intact Fc-effector function of 
tiragolumab, lymphopenia via ADCC is a theoretical risk.      For information on the 
pharmacokinetics, metabolism, formulation and handling of tiragolumab, see the pharmacy 
manual and the Tiragolumab Investigator's Brochure.
4.2 Accountability Records for Study Drug
The Investigational Pharmacist at each site will manage drug accountability records.
4.3 Ordering Study Drugs
UCSF will obtain Atezolizumab and Tiragolumab directly from Genentech as study supply. Drug 
will be shipped directly to subsites if required to ensure drug stability.
5 Treatment Plan
5.1 Dosage and Administration
Cohort A: The starting dose level of atezolizumab for Cohort A was 1200 mg administered by 
IV infusion on an outpatient basis for one dose, and was escalated in subsequent cohorts to 
1200 mg administered by IV infusion every 3 weeks for a maximum of 3 neoadjuvant doses. 
Prior to Amendment 4.3 (October 19, 2020) subjects with adverse histology at the time of 
cystectomy (pT3, pT4, or N+) and no metastatic disease could elect to receive adjuvant 
MPDL3280A will receive 1200mg by IV infusion on an outpatient basis every 3 weeks for up to 
16 doses cumulative doses.
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 37 of 121Cohort B: The starting combination regimen will be atezolizumab 1200 mg administered by IV 
infusion on an outpatient basis every 3 weeks and tiragolumab 600 mg administered by IV 
infusion every 3 weeks for a total intended 3 neoadjuvant doses. As previously detailed, there 
will be a safety lead in of 6 initial patients at which time trial accrual will temporarily pause to 
assess the safety of combination treatment. 
Administration of atezolizumab and tiragolumab will be performed in a setting with emergency 
medical facilities and staff who are trained to monitor for and respond to medical emergencies.
Atezolizumab and Tiragolumab will be delivered in infusion bags with IV infusion lines with 
product contacting surfaces of polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyolefin and 0.2 μm in-line filters 
(filter membrane of polyethersulfone [PES]). No incompatibilities have been observed between 
atezolizumab and PVC or polyolefin infusion materials (bags and infusion lines). 
The compatibility of tiragolumab with diluents other than described is unknown. Tiragolumab 
must not be infused into the same line or cannula concomitantly with other drug infusions, 
including parenteral nutrition. Infusions of blood products and any electrolyte supplementation 
must not occur simultaneously with infusion of tiragolumab. 
The initial dose of atezolizumab will be delivered over 60 (± 15) minutes. If the first infusion is 
tolerated without infusion-associated adverse events, the second infusion may be delivered over 
30 (± 10) minutes. If the 30-minute infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions (for 
subjects receiving more than 2 doses) may be delivered over 30 (± 10) minutes.
For the first infusion, the patient’s vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and 
temperature) should be determined within 60 minutes before, during (every 15 [±  5] minutes), 
and 30 (± 10) minutes after the infusion. For subsequent infusions, vital signs will be collected 
within 60 minutes before infusion, and during or after the infusion if clinically indicated or if 
symptoms occurred in the prior infusion. Patients will be informed about the possibility of 
delayed post-infusion symptoms and instructed to contact their study physician if they develop 
such symptoms.
No premedication will be allowed for the first dose of atezolizumab. Premedication may be 
administered for Cycles ≥ 2 at the discretion of the treating physician after consultation with the 
Study Chair.
Tiragolumab dose will be administered following the dose of atezolizumab and will be delivered 
over 60 (± 15) minutes. If the first infusion is tolerated without infusion-associated adverse 
events, the second infusion may be delivered over 30 (± 10) minutes. If the 30-minute infusion is 
well tolerated, all subsequent infusions (for subjects receiving more than 2 doses) may be 
delivered over 30 (± 10) minutes.
For the first infusion, the patient’s vital signs (heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and

5.1.1 Other Modalities or Procedures
A radical cystectomy per institutional standard of care is planned for all patients enrolling in this 
study. No other procedures following initiation of systemic treatment (e.g., TURBT) are required 
for subjects while on study. Cystectomy may be performed beginning 3 weeks after the last 
planned dose of study therapy is administered. See study calendar (Section 6.10) for schedule 
of evaluations.
5.2 Cohort A Multi-dose Schedule
Three successive cohorts were enrolled to evaluate immunologic impact of escalating 
neoadjuvant doses of atezolizumab prior to cystectomy as outlined in the table below. A fixed 
dose of atezolizumab 1200mg was given with each cycle. For individual subjects there was no 
dose modifications above or reductions below the assigned dose allowed. 
Table 5.2 Cohort A Multi-Dose Cohort Schedule
Dose Level Dose of Atezolizumab Number of Patients Accrued 
Before Accrual of Next Cohort
1 1200 mg x 1 dose 6
2 1200 mg q3 weeks x 2 doses 6
3 1200 mg q3 weeks x 3 doses 6
Multi-dose cohort accrual then proceeded according to the following: Dosing began in the first 
cohort (Dosing Level 1) with atezolizumab 1200mg IV x 1 dose. Beginning with this starting 
dose level, six patients were treated at each cumulative dose level. Accrual to the next higher

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 39 of 121dose cohort began after 6 subjects in the lower cohort completed treatment and underwent 
cystectomy.
18 patients were treated in this multi-dose phase. 
Cohort A Dose-expansion occurred at dose level 3 given no unacceptable treatment-related 
toxicity (as defined in Section 5.4) was observed. The rationale for expansion at this dose level 
is discussed in Section 1.8.
5.3 Cohort B Safety Lead-in Schedule
The Cohort B safety lead-in is described in section 3.1. Dosing for the Cohort B safety lead-in is 
detailed below. Once the intended treatment regimen is established following completion of the 
safety assessment, an additional 15 patients will be enrolled at the same regimen for a total of 
21 patients on that treatment regimen.
Table 5.3 Cohort B Safety Lead-in Dosing
Dose Level Atezolizumab Tiragolumab
1 1200 mg q3 weeks x 3 doses 600mg x 3 doses
2 1200 mg q3 weeks x 3 doses 600mg x 2 doses
3 1200 mg q3 weeks x 3 doses 600mg x 1 dose
5.4 Dose Limiting Toxicities (DLTs)
Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) is an unacceptable treatment-related toxicity that occurs between 
time of first dose and time of cystectomy, defined as:
●any Grade 4 toxicity, or
●any recurrent Grade 3 toxicity, or
●any Grade 3 toxicity persisting more than 2 weeks, or
●any toxicity that results in delay of cystectomy beyond 12 weeks from the 
first dose of study drug
5.5 Interim Safety Analysis
A stopping rule for safety will halt accrual to the study and prompt reevaluation of the treatment 
regimen if unacceptable treatment-related toxicity (defined as any Grade 4 toxicity, any 
recurrent Grade 3 toxicity, or any Grade 3 toxicity persisting more than 2 weeks), or treatment-
related delay in cystectomy beyond 12 weeks (12 week window starts at time of first dose to 
time of cystectomy), is observed at a frequency of ≥ 33.3%.      
Because of the known excellent safety profile of atezolizumab, this safety review will occur after 
all 6 subjects have been accrued to each individual dosing cohort in the Cohort A multi-dose 
phase and Cohort B safety lead-in and treated with at least one dose of study treatment, as well 
as on an ongoing basis should serious treatment-related toxicities or treatment-related delays in 
cystectomy be observed at any point in the study.

Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 40 of 1215.6 Dose Modifications and Dosing Delays
There will be no dose reduction for atezolizumab or tiragolumab for individual subjects in this 
study. Treatment delays are allowed for subjects who experience toxicity, as long as the 
following treatment occurs within the 12 week window between the first dose of study therapy 
and cystectomy. If any toxicity will delay cystectomy beyond 12 weeks from the time that patient 
begins study therapy, then no further study therapy should be given and the subject should 
proceed to cystectomy.
Dose interruptions for reason(s) other than toxicity, such as surgical procedures, may be 
allowed with Study Chair approval. The acceptable length of interruption will depend on 
agreement between the investigator and the Study Chair and should conform with guidelines for 
delay of cystectomy above.
Treatment or visit delays for public holidays or weather conditions do not constitute a DLT or 
protocol violation.
5.7 Monitoring and Toxicity Management
5.7.1 Eligibility
Eligibility criteria were selected to guard the safety of patients in this trial. Results from the 
nonclinical toxicology studies with atezolizumab and tiragolumab, as well as the 
nonclinical/clinical data from other PD-L1/PD-1 inhibitors, were taken into account. Specifically, 
patients at risk for study- emergent autoimmune conditions or with a prior diagnosis of 
autoimmune disease, patients with evidence of acute infections, and patients who have 
received a live-attenuated viral vaccine within 4 weeks before Day 1 are excluded from the 
study.
5.7.2 Monitoring
Each patient receiving atezolizumab, with or without tiragolumab, will be evaluable for safety. 
The safety parameters include but are not limited to all laboratory tests and hematological 
abnormalities, physical findings, and spontaneous reports of adverse events reported to the 
investigator by patients. Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all 
serious and non-serious adverse events. For Cohort A, toxicity will be assessed according to 
CTCAE v4.0 and for Cohort B, toxicity will be assessed according to the CTCAE v5.0. 
Each patient will be assessed periodically for the development of any toxicity as outlined in 
Section 6-Study Schedule, Procedures and Observations. General safety assessments will 
include serial interval histories, physical examinations, and specific laboratory studies, including 
serum chemistries and blood counts (see section 6 for the list and timing of study assessments). 
Laboratory values must be reviewed prior to each infusion.
During the study, patients will be closely monitored for the development of any signs or 
symptoms of autoimmune conditions and infection.
All serious adverse events and protocol-defined events of special interest (see Section 7.5.2.7) 
will be reported in an expedited fashion. In addition, observed adverse events will be monitored 
on a regular basis.
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 41 of 121Patients will be followed for safety for 30 days following their last dose of study treatment and 
for 2 years of follow up after cystectomy, or until they receive another anti-cancer therapy, 
whichever comes first. 
Patients who have an ongoing study treatment-related adverse event upon study completion or 
at discontinuation from the study will be followed until the event has resolved to baseline grade, 
the event is assessed by the investigator as stable, new anti-cancer treatment is initiated, the 
patient is lost to follow-up, the patient withdraws consent, or it has been determined that study 
treatment or participation is not the cause of the adverse event.
Interim Analyses for Safety are outlined in Section 5.5.
5.7.3 Management of General and Immune Related Adverse Events (irAEs)
Toxicities associated or possibly associated with atezolizumab or tiragolumab treatment should 
be managed according to standard medical practice. Additional tests, such as autoimmune 
serology or biopsies, should be used to determine a possible immunogenic etiology.
Although most irAEs observed with immunomodulatory agents have been mild and self-limiting, 
such events should be recognized early and treated promptly to avoid potential major 
complications. Discontinuation of atezolizumab or tiragolumab may not have an immediate 
therapeutic effect, and there is no available antidote for either drug. In severe cases, immune-
related toxicities may be acutely managed with topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, 
mycophenolate,      TNF-α inhibitors, or other immunosuppressants.
The primary approach to Grade 1-2 irAEs is supportive and symptomatic care; for higher grade 
irAEs, steroids by mouth or parenterally are given, and either delaying a dose or stopping 
therapy is appropriate. Recurrent Grade 2 irAEs may also mandate delaying a dose of 
atezolizumab and tiragolumab or the use of steroids. If the patient is being managed with 
corticosteroids, treatment should not be restarted until the steroids have been tapered 
off. Consideration for benefit/risk balance should be made by the investigator, with 
consideration of the totality of information as it pertains to the nature of the toxicity and the 
degree of clinical benefit a given patient may be experiencing prior to further administration of 
atezolizumab and tiragolumab. Atezolizumab and tiragolumab should be permanently 
discontinued in patients with life-threatening immune-related adverse events.
5.7.4 Management of Atezolizumab and Tiragolumab - Specific Adverse Events
Toxicities associated or possibly associated with atezolizumab and tiragolumab treatment 
should be managed according to standard medical practice. Additional tests, such as 
autoimmune serology or biopsies, should be used to evaluate for a possible immunogenic 
etiology.
Because of the expected pharmacologic activity of tiragolumab, the adverse event management 
guidelines described here, including those for continuing, withholding, resuming, and 
discontinuing atezolizumab, as outlined below, are applicable to tiragolumab as well as 
atezolizumab where noted.
Although most immune-related AEs observed with immunomodulatory agents have been mild 
and self-limiting, such events should be recognized early and treated promptly to avoid potential 
major complications. Discontinuation of atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab may not have an 
immediate therapeutic effect, and in severe cases, immune-related toxicities may require acute

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 42 of 121management with topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive 
agents.
The investigator should consider the benefit-risk balance a given patient may be experiencing 
prior to further administration of atezolizumab. In patients who have met the criteria for 
permanent discontinuation, resumption of atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab may be considered 
if the patient is deriving benefit and has fully recovered from the immune-related event. Patients 
can be rechallenged with atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab only after approval has been 
documented by both the investigator (or an appropriate delegate) and the Medical Monitor.
5.7.4.1 Pulmonary Events
Immune-mediated pulmonary events are a potential risk with tiragolumab.
Dyspnea, cough, fatigue, hypoxia, pneumonitis, and pulmonary infiltrates have been associated 
with the administration of atezolizumab. Patients will be assessed for pulmonary signs and 
symptoms throughout the study and will also have CT scans of the chest performed at every 
tumor assessment.
All pulmonary events should be thoroughly evaluated for other commonly reported etiologies 
such as pneumonia or other infection, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, pulmonary embolism, heart 
failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or pulmonary hypertension. Management 
guidelines for pulmonary events are provided in the table below.

Note: Because of the expected pharmacologic activity of tiragolumab, guidelines for continuing, 
withholding, resuming, and discontinuing atezolizumab are also applicable to tiragolumab. 
a Tiragolumab and Atezolizumab may be withheld for a longer period of time (i.e., 
> 12 weeks after event onset) to allow for corticosteroids (if initiated) to be 
reduced to  ≤ 10 mg/day oral prednisone or equivalent. Protocol defined 
windows for treatment discontinuation may differ and should be followed 
accordingly.
b If corticosteroids have been initiated, they must be tapered over ≥  1 month to ≤ 10 mg/day oral 
prednisone or equivalent before tiragolumab and atezolizumab can be resumed.
c Resumption of atezolizumab may be considered in patients who are deriving 
benefit and have fully recovered from the immune-related event. Patients can 
be re-challenged with tiragolumab and atezolizumab only after approval has 
been documented by both the investigator (or an appropriate delegate) and the 
Medical Monitor.
5.7.4.2 Hepatic Events
Immune-mediated hepatic events are a potential risk with tiragolumab.  
Immune-related hepatitis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab. Eligible 
patients must have adequate liver function, as manifested by measurements of total bilirubin 
and hepatic transaminases, and liver function will be monitored throughout study treatment.
Management guidelines for hepatic events are provided in the table below.
Patients with right upper-quadrant abdominal pain and/or unexplained nausea or vomiting 
should have LFTs performed immediately and reviewed before administration of the next dose 
of study drug.
For patients with elevated LFTs, concurrent medication, viral hepatitis, and toxic or neoplastic 
etiologies should be considered and addressed, as appropriate.

Immune-mediated gastrointestinal events are a potential risk with tiragolumab. 
Immune-related colitis has been associated with the administration of atezolizumab. 
Management guidelines for diarrhea or colitis are provided in the table below.
All events of diarrhea or colitis should be thoroughly evaluated for other more common 
etiologies. For events of significant duration or magnitude or associated with signs of
systemic inflammation or acute-phase reactants (e.g., increased CRP, platelet count, or 
bandemia): Perform sigmoidoscopy (or colonoscopy, if appropriate) with colonic biopsy, with 3 
to 5 specimens for standard paraffin block to check for inflammation and lymphocytic infiltrates 
to confirm colitis diagnosis.

5.7.4.4 Endocrine Events
Immune-related endocrine events are a potential risk with tiragolumab. 
Thyroid disorders, adrenal insufficiency, diabetes mellitus and pituitary disorders have been 
associated with the administration of atezolizumab. Management guidelines for endocrine 
events are provided in the table below.
Patients with unexplained symptoms such as headache, fatigue, myalgias, impotence, 
constipation, or mental status changes should be investigated for the presence of thyroid, 
pituitary, or adrenal endocrinopathies. The patient should be referred to an endocrinologist if an 
endocrinopathy is suspected. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free T3 and T4 levels 
should be measured to determine whether thyroid abnormalities are present. Pituitary hormone 
levels and function tests (e.g. TSH, growth hormone, luteinizing hormone, follicle-stimulating 
hormone, testosterone, prolactin, adrenocorticotropic hormone [ACTH] levels and ACTH 
stimulation test) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (with detailed pituitary 
sections) may help to differentiate primary pituitary insufficiency from primary adrenal 
insufficiency.

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 50 of 1215.7.4.6 Immune-Related Myocarditis
Immune-related myocarditis is a potential risk with tiragolumab and has been associated with 
the administration of atezolizumab.
Immune-related myocarditis should be suspected in any patient
presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of myocarditis, including, but not limited to, 
dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, fatigue, decreased exercise tolerance, or syncope.
Immune-related myocarditis needs to be distinguished from myocarditis resulting from infection 
(commonly viral, e.g. in a patient who reports a recent history of gastrointestinal illness), 
ischemic events, underlying arrhythmias, exacerbation of pre-existing cardiac conditions, or 
progression of malignancy.
All patients with possible myocarditis should be urgently evaluated by performing cardiac 
enzyme assessment, an ECG, a chest X-ray, an echocardiogram, and a cardiac MRI as 
appropriate per institutional guidelines. A cardiologist should be consulted. An endomyocardial 
biopsy may be considered to enable a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment, if clinically 
indicated.
Patients with signs and symptoms of myocarditis, in the absence of an identified alternate 
etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in the table below.

5.7.4.7 Infusion Related Reactions 
No premedication is indicated for the administration of Cycle 1 of tiragolumab and atezolizumab. 
However, patients who experience an infusion-related reaction (IRR) with Cycle 1 tiragolumab 
and atezolizumab may receive premedication with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or 
analgesics (e.g., acetaminophen) for subsequent infusions. Metamizole (dipyrone) is prohibited 
in treating atezolizumab-associated IRRs because of its potential for causing agranulocytosis.
IRRs are known to occur with the administration of monoclonal antibodies and have been 
reported with tiragolumab and atezolizumab. These reactions, which are thought to be due to 
release of cytokines and/or other chemical mediators, occur within 24 hours of tiragolumab and 
atezolizumab administration and are generally mild to moderate in severity.
Guidelines for medical management of IRRs during Cycle 1 are provided in the table below.  For 
subsequent cycles, IRRs should be managed according to institutional guidelines.
Management Guidelines for Infusion-Related Reactions
Event Management
IRR, Grade 1 Reduce infusion rate to half the rate being given at the time of

After the event has resolved, the investigator should wait for 
30 minutes while delivering the infusion at the reduced rate.
If the infusion is tolerated at the reduced rate for 30 minutes after 
symptoms have resolved, the infusion rate may be increased to 
the original rate.
IRR, Grade 2 Interrupt infusion.
Administer aggressive symptomatic treatment (e.g., oral or IV 
antihistamine, antipyretic medication, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, 
bronchodilators, oxygen, IV fluids).
After symptoms have resolved to baseline, resume infusion at half 
the rate being given at the time of event onset.
For subsequent infusions, consider administration of oral 
premedication with antihistamines, antipyretic medications, and/or 
analgesics and monitor closely for IRRs.
IRR, Grade 3 or 4 Stop infusion.
Administer aggressive symptomatic treatment (e.g., oral or IV 
antihistamine, antipyretic medication, glucocorticoids, epinephrine, 
bronchodilators, oxygen, IV fluids).
Permanently discontinue tiragolumab or atezolizumab and contact 
Medical Monitor. a
IRR  infusion-related reaction.
aResumption of tiragolumab or atezolizumab may be considered in patients who are 
deriving benefit and have fully recovered from the event.  Patients can be re-challenged 
with tiragolumab or atezolizumab only after approval has been documented by both the 
investigator (or an appropriate delegate) and the Medical Monitor.
5.7.4.8 Cytokine Release Syndrome
No premedication is indicated for the administration of Cycle 1 of tiragolumab or atezolizumab.  
However, patients who experience cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) with tiragolumab or 
atezolizumab may receive premedication with antihistamines, anti pyretics, and/or analgesics 
(e.g., acetaminophen) for subsequent infusions.
CRS is defined as a supraphysiologic response following administration of any immune therapy 
that results in activation or engagement of endogenous or infused T cells and/or other immune 
effector cells. Symptoms can be progressive, always include fever at the onset, and may include 
hypotension, capillary leak (hypoxia), and end-organ dysfunction29. CRS has been well 
documented with chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapies and bispecific T-cell engager 
antibody therapies but has also been reported with immunotherapies that target PD-1 or PD-
L130, 31, including atezolizumab.
Guidelines for medical management of CRS are provided below.
Severe COVID-19 appears to be associated with a CRS involving the inflammatory cytokines 
interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, IL-2, and IFN- (Merad and Martin 2020).  If a patient develops 
suspected CRS during the study, a differential diagnosis should include COVID-19, which 
should be confirmed or refuted through assessment of exposure history, appropriate laboratory

Note: Because of the expected pharmacologic activity of tiragolumab, guidelines for 
continuing, withholding, resuming, and discontinuing atezolizumab are also applicable to 
tiragolumab.
a.Grading system for management guidelines is based on ASTCT consensus 
grading for CRS. NCI CTCAE (version as specified in the protocol) should be 
used when reporting severity of IRRs, CRS, or organ toxicities associated with 
CRS on the Adverse Event eCRF. Organ toxicities associated with CRS should 
not influence overall CRS grading.
b.Fever is defined as temperature ≥38°C not attributable to any other cause. In 
patients who develop CRS and then receive anti-pyretic, anti-cytokine, or 
corticosteroid therapy, fever is no longer required when subsequently 
determining event severity (grade). In this case, the grade is driven by the 
presence of hypotension and/or hypoxia.
c.Symptomatic treatment may include oral or IV antihistamines, anti-pyretics, 
analgesics, bronchodilators, and/or oxygen. For bronchospasm, urticaria, or

practice.
d.Low flow is defined as oxygen delivered at ≤ 6 L/min, and high flow is defined 
as oxygen delivered at > 6 L/min.
e.Resumption of tiragolumab and atezolizumab may be considered in patients 
who are deriving benefit and have fully recovered from the event. Patients can 
be re-challenged with atezolizumab only after approval has been documented 
by both the investigator (or an appropriate delegate) and the Medical Monitor. 
For subsequent infusions, administer oral premedication with antihistamines, 
anti-pyretics, and/or analgesics, and monitor closely for IRRs and/or CRS. 
Premedication with corticosteroids and extending the infusion time may also 
be considered after consulting the Medical Monitor and considering the 
benefit-risk ratio.
f.Refer to Riegler et al.32 for information on experimental treatments for CRS.
5.7.4.9 Pancreatic Events
Immune-related pancreatic events are a potential risk with tiragolumab.
Symptoms of abdominal pain associated with elevations of amylase and lipase, suggestive of 
pancreatitis, have been associated with the administration of atezolizumab. The differential 
diagnosis of acute abdominal pain should include pancreatitis.
Appropriate work-up should include an evaluation for ductal obstruction, as well as serum 
amylase and lipase tests. Management guidelines for pancreatic events, including pancreatitis, 
are provided in the table below.

limited to, headache, neck pain, confusion, seizure, motor or sensory dysfunction, and altered or 
depressed level of consciousness.
Encephalopathy from metabolic or electrolyte imbalances needs to be distinguished from 
potential meningoencephalitis resulting from infection (bacterial, viral, or fungal) or progression 
of malignancy, or secondary to a paraneoplastic process.
All patients being considered for meningoencephalitis should be urgently evaluated with a CT 
scan and/or MRI scan of the brain to evaluate for metastasis, inflammation, or edema. If 
deemed safe by the treating physician, a lumbar puncture should be performed and a 
neurologist should be consulted.
Patients with signs and symptoms of meningoencephalitis, in the absence of an identified 
alternate etiology, should be treated according to the guidelines in the table below.

5.7.4.15 Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and Macrophage Activation 
Syndrome
Immune-mediated reactions may involve any organ system and may lead to hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) and macrophage activation syndrome (MAS). 
Clinical and laboratory features of severe CRS overlap with HLH, and HLH should be considered 
when CRS presentation is atypical or prolonged. 
Patients with suspected HLH should be diagnosed according to published criteria by McClain and 
Eckstein (2014).  A patient should be classified as having HLH if five of the following eight criteria 
are met:
Fever ≥ 38.5°C
Splenomegaly
Peripheral blood cytopenia consisting of at least two of the following:
o Hemoglobin < 90 g/L (9 g/dL) (< 100 g/L [< 10 g/dL] for infants < 4 weeks old)
o Platelet count < 100 x 109/L (< 100,000/mL)
oANC < 1.0  109/L (< 1000/mL)
oFasting triglycerides > 2.992 mmol/L (265 mg/dL) and/or fibrinogen < 1.5 g/L (< 
150 mg/dL)
oHemophagocytosis in bone marrow, spleen, lymph node, or liver
oLow or absent natural killer cell activity
oFerritin > 500 mg/L ( > 500 ng/mL)
oSoluble interleukin-2 receptor (soluble CD25) elevated  2 standard deviations 
above age-adjusted laboratory-specific norms
Patients with suspected MAS should be diagnosed according to published criteria for systemic 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis by Ravelli et al. (2016).  A febrile patient should be classified as 
having MAS if the following criteria are met:
o Ferritin > 684 mg/L (684 ng/mL)
oAt least two of the following:

dyspnea, hypotension, wheezing, bronchospasm, tachycardia, reduced oxygen saturation, or 
respiratory distress should be managed with supportive therapies as clinically indicated (e.g., 
supplemental oxygen and β 2-adrenergic agonists; see Appendix 5).
Systemic corticosteroids and TNF-α inhibitors may attenuate potential beneficial immunologic 
effects of treatment with atezolizumab and tiragolumab but may be administered at the 
discretion of the treating physician after consultation with the Study Chair. If feasible, 
alternatives to corticosteroids should be considered. Premedication may be administered for 
Cycles ≥ 2 at the discretion of the treating physician after consultation with the Study Chair.
The use of inhaled corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids (e.g., fludrocortisone) for patients with 
orthostatic hypotension, adrenocortical insufficiency, or for obstructive lung disease is allowed.
Megestrol administered as an appetite stimulant is acceptable while the patient is enrolled in the 
study.
Influenza vaccination should be given during influenza season only (approximately September 
to March). Patients must not receive live, attenuated influenza vaccine (e.g., FluMist) within 4 
weeks prior to Cycle 1, Day 1 or at any time during the study but may receive inactivated 
vaccine.
Patients who use hormonal therapy with gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists or 
antagonists for prostate cancer, oral contraceptives, hormone-replacement therapy, prophylactic 
or therapeutic anticoagulation therapy (such as low molecular weight heparin or warfarin at a 
stable dose level), or other allowed maintenance therapy (see section 3.3 Eligibility Criteria) 
should continue their use.
Males and females of reproductive potential should use highly effective means of contraception.
All concomitant medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded on the 
appropriate eCRF.
5.9 Excluded Therapy
Any concomitant therapy intended for the treatment of cancer, whether health 
authority−approved or experimental, is prohibited. This includes but is not limited to the 
following:
●Chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, 
investigational agents, or herbal therapy (except for maintenance 
therapies outlined in section 5.8).
●Traditional herbal medicines should not be administered because the 
ingredients of many herbal medicines are not fully studied and their use 
may result in unanticipated drug-drug interactions that may cause or 
confound assessment of toxicity
●Patients who are receiving a receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B 
ligand (RANK- ligand) inhibitor (denosumab) prior to enrollment must be 
willing and eligible to receive a bisphosphonate instead while on study;

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 68 of 121denosumab could potentially alter the activity and the safety of the study 
drugs.
●Initiation or increased dose of granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (e.g. 
granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte/macrophage colony-
stimulating factor, and/or pegfilgrastim) is strongly discouraged.
●Patients are not allowed to receive immunostimulatory agents, including 
but not limited to interferon (IFN)-α , IFN-γ, IL-2, or ipilumumab during the 
entire study. These agents, in combination with the study drugs, could 
potentially increase the risk for autoimmune conditions.
●Patients should also not receive immunosuppressive medications, 
including but not limited to cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, 
methotrexate, and thalidomide. These agents could potentially alter the 
activity and the safety of the study drugs. Systemic corticosteroids and 
anti−TNF-α agents may attenuate potential beneficial immunologic effects 
of treatment with the study drugs but may be administered at the 
discretion of the treating physician after consultation with the Study Chair. 
If feasible, alternatives to these agents should be considered.
●In addition, all patients (including those who discontinue the study early) 
should not receive any other immunostimulatory agents for 10 weeks 
after the last dose of the study drugs.
●Patients who receive local therapy directed at the bladder (i.e., repeat 
TURBT, radiation therapy) after study treatment initiation but prior to 
cystectomy will be considered ineligible for response evaluation, but will 
remain eligible for safety and correlative evaluation. Such cases must be 
discussed with and approved by the Study Chair.
6 Study Schedule, Procedures and Observations
The study-specific assessments are detailed in this section. Screening assessments must be 
performed within 28 days prior to the first dose of investigational product. Any results falling 
outside of the reference ranges may be repeated at the discretion of the investigator. All on- 
study visit procedures are allowed a window of ± 3 days unless otherwise noted. Treatment or 
visit delays for public holidays or weather conditions do not constitute a protocol violation.
Patients will be closely monitored for safety and tolerability throughout the study. All 
assessments must be performed and documented for each patient.
Patients should be assessed for toxicity prior to each dose; dosing will occur only if the clinical 
assessment and local laboratory test values are acceptable.
The following apply to both screening assessments as well as to on study visits:
6.1 Informed Consent Forms and Screening Log
A written, signed, informed consent form (ICF) and a Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization must be obtained before any study-specific 
assessments are initiated. A copy of the signed ICF will be given to the subject and a copy will 
be filed in the medical record. The original will be kept on file with the study records. Informed 
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 69 of 121Consent Forms for enrolled patients and for patients who are not subsequently enrolled will be 
maintained at the study site.
All patients who are consented will be registered in OnCore®, the UCSF Helen Diller Family 
Comprehensive Cancer Center Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS). The system is 
password protected and meets HIPAA requirements.
Each participating site is responsible for OnCore® registration of study participants consented at 
the site.
All screening evaluations must be completed and reviewed to confirm that patients meet all 
eligibility criteria before enrollment. The investigator will maintain a screening log to record 
details of all patients screened and to confirm eligibility or record reasons for screening failure, 
as applicable.
6.2 Medical History and Demographic Data
Medical history includes clinically significant diseases, surgeries, cancer history (including prior 
cancer therapies and procedures), reproductive status, smoking history, and all medications 
(e.g., prescription drugs, over-the-counter drugs, herbal or homeopathic remedies, nutritional 
supplements) used by the patient within 7 days prior to the screening visit. A history of pleural or 
pericardial effusion or of ascites requiring intervention should be entered in the medical history.
Demographic data will include age, ECOG performance status, sex, and self-reported 
race/ethnicity.
Cancer history will include an assessment of prior treatment with BCG.
6.3 Physical Examinations
A complete physical examination should include an evaluation of the head, eyes, ears, nose, 
and throat and the cardiovascular, dermatological, musculoskeletal, respiratory, gastrointestinal, 
and neurological systems. Any abnormality identified at baseline should be recorded on the 
General Medical History and Baseline Conditions eCRF. Height (baseline only) and weight 
should be measured and recorded in the eCRF.
6.4 Vital Signs and Weight
Vital signs will include measurements of pulse rate, respiratory rate, systolic and diastolic blood 
pressures while the patient is in a seated position, weight, oxygen saturation, and temperature. 
Patient height should be recorded once during the study either in the screening period or on 
cycle 1 day 1 prior to the first study treatment.
For the first infusion, the patient’s vital signs (pulse rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, and 
temperature) should be determined within 60 minutes before, during (every 15 [±  5] minutes), 
and 30 (± 10) minutes. For subsequent infusions, vital signs will be collected within 60 minutes 
before infusion and at the end of the infusion. Patients will be informed about the possibility of 
delayed post-infusion symptoms and instructed to contact their study physician if they develop 
such symptoms.
Blood oxygen saturation will be measured at timepoints indicated in the study calendar using 
pulse oximetry.

Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 70 of 1216.5 Tumor Evaluation Methods
All subjects must have undergone cystoscopy or TURBT prior to study screening to document 
the presence of urothelial carcinoma.
Screening assessments must include CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis (with oral/IV 
contrast unless contraindicated) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen, 
and pelvis.
Screening bone imaging with either a technetium bone scan or a sodium-fluoride PET/CT is 
required only for subjects with an elevated alkaline phosphatase or symptoms to suggest bony 
metastasis. If bony metastases are detected at screening then the subject will be ineligible for 
study participation. Further bone-specific imaging should be performed as clinically indicated.
Imaging of the brain, head, and/or neck is not required for study entry but should also be 
performed if clinically indicated. If a CT scan for tumor assessment is performed using an FDG 
positron emission tomography (PET) /CT scanner, the CT acquisition must be consistent with 
the standards for a full-contrast diagnostic CT scan. At the investigator’s discretion, other 
methods of assessment of measurable disease as per RECIST v1.1 may be used.
Results of standard of care tests or examinations performed prior to obtaining Informed Consent 
and ≤28 days prior to study entry may be used for the purposes of Screening rather than 
repeating such tests. Radiographic imaging assessments performed up to 45 days prior to study 
entry (i.e., available) may be used for the purposes of Screening.
For subsequent tumor assessments, procedures for tumor assessment should be performed as 
per the study calendar (see section 6.10) and clinically indicated. The same radiographic 
procedure used to assess disease sites at screening should be used throughout the study (e.g., 
the same contrast protocol for CT scans). All known sites of disease (i.e., local lymph nodes) 
must be documented at screening and reassessed at each subsequent tumor evaluation. 
Relapse will be assessed by the investigator using RECIST v1.1 and modified RECIST criteria. 
The same evaluator should perform assessments if possible to ensure internal consistency 
across visits.
At the investigator’s discretion, CT scans or bone-specific imaging should be repeated at any 
time if recurrent disease is suspected.
6.6 Laboratory, Biomarker, and Other Biological Samples
“Local” laboratory tests may be performed either at a local certified laboratory or at the study 
site. “Central” laboratory tests should be drawn at the study site and may be analyzed at the 
coordinating center or sent to Roche.

tumor tissue and blood samples for the assessment of atezolizumab and tiragolumab 
biomarkers, ATA assays, and auto-antibody testing. Instruction manuals and supply kits will be 
provided for all central laboratory assessments.
The following assessments will be performed at a central laboratory or Genentech:
●Anti-Therapeutic Antibody (ATA) assays and atezolizumab and 
tiragolumab levels (only in case of clinical suspicion of serious acute 
immune or inflammatory toxicity, related to atezolizumab and/or

genes associated with tumor immune biology as well as genomic 
mutations.
●Biomarker and immunologic assays in blood samples
oBlood samples will be obtained for biomarker evaluation from all 
eligible patients at screening, before treatment, on treatment, at 
the treatment discontinuation visit, and in the follow-up period. 
Samples will be processed to obtain blood cells (and their 
derivatives), plasma, and serum for the determination of changes 
in surrogate biomarkers and immunologic assays that may be 
altered in UC or biomarkers that are related to UC and tumor 
immune biology (including but not limited to IFN-gamma and other 
exploratory biomarkers).
●Biomarker immunologic assays in urine samples
oUrine samples will be obtained for biomarker evaluation from all 
eligible patients before study treatment, on treatment, and at the 
treatment discontinuation visit. Samples will be processed to 
obtain tumor cells (and their derivatives) and immune cells, for the 
determination of changes in surrogate biomarkers that may be 
altered in UC or biomarkers that are related to UC and tumor 
immune biology (including but not limited to IFN-gamma and other 
exploratory biomarkers).
Any remaining samples collected for biomarker assays, may be used for exploratory biomarker 
profiling and identification purposes as appropriate. In addition, exploratory biomarkers 
(including but not limited to markers related to immune or UBC biology) may be evaluated in 
tissue samples.
●Archival and fresh tumor tissue sample
oRepresentative tumor specimens in paraffin blocks (preferred) or 
at least 15 unstained slides, with an associated pathology report, 
should be submitted prior to study enrollment.
oTumor tissue should be of good quality based on total and viable 
tumor content (sites will be informed if the quality of the submitted 
specimen is inadequate to determine tumor PD-L1 status). Fine-
needle aspiration, brushing, cell pellets, and lavage samples are 
not acceptable. For any core needle biopsy specimens, at least 
three cores should be submitted for evaluation.

available.
oAny fresh and/or paraffin embedded TURBT specimens (prior to 
study therapy or while on study therapy) or cystectomy specimens 
(after study therapy) will be made available for assessment of 
tumor response, and characterization of PD-1 and PD-L1 
expression and of immunologic infiltrate.
oFor archival samples, the remaining tumor tissue block for all 
patients enrolled will be returned to the site upon request or 18 
months after final closure of the study database, whichever is 
sooner. Tissue samples from patients who are not eligible to enroll 
in the study will be returned no later than 4 weeks after eligibility 
determination.
●Tumor biopsy at the time of initial radiographic recurrence
oAll patients will undergo a mandatory tumor biopsy sample 
collection, if clinically feasible as determined by the study 
investigator in consenting patients, at the first evidence of 
radiographic disease recurrence. Subjects may opt-out of this 
biopsy.
oAcceptable samples include core needle biopsies for deep tumor 
tissue or lymph nodes or excisional, incisional, punch, or forceps 
biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions. For 
core needle biopsy specimens, at least three cores should be 
submitted for evaluation. A fine needle aspirate is not acceptable.
●Use and storage of remaining samples from study-related procedures
oThe remainder of samples obtained for study-related procedures 
will be destroyed no later than 5 years after the end of the study or 
earlier depending on local regulations.
Please refer to the laboratory manual for additional details on laboratory assessments and 
sample handling.
6.7 Cardiac Tests: Electrocardiograms (ECGs)
Twelve-lead ECG is required at screening and as clinically indicated. ECGs should be obtained 
on the same machine whenever possible. Lead placement should be as consistent as possible. 
ECG recordings should be performed after the patient has been resting in a supine position.
For safety monitoring purposes, the investigator must review, sign, and date all ECG tracings. 
Paper copies of ECG tracings will be kept as part of the patient's permanent study file at the 
site. Any morphologic waveform changes or other ECG abnormalities must be documented on 
the eCRF.
6.8 Anti-Therapeutic Antibody and atezolizumab and tiragolumab Testing
Atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab may elicit an immune response. Patients with signs of any 
potential immune response to atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab will be closely monitored.

Following early discontinuation all patients will be followed for 2 year relapse free survival and 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy. Survival and subsequent anti-cancer therapy follow-up 
information will be collected via telephone calls, patient medical records, and/or clinic visits 
approximately every 3 months until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or study 
termination by the Sponsor, for up to 2 years after cystectomy. Subjects will not be followed for 
overall survival.
6.9.7 Discontinuation of Therapy
Patients have the right to voluntarily withdraw from the study at any time for any reason. In 
addition, the investigator has the right to withdraw a patient from the study at any time. Reasons 
for withdrawal from the study may include but are not limited to the following:
●Patient withdrawal of consent at any time
●Any medical condition or adverse event that the investigator or Sponsor 
determines may jeopardize the patient’s safety if he or she continues in 
the study
●Investigator or Sponsor determines it is in the best interest of the patient
●Patient non-compliance
●Any significant uncertainty on the part of the Investigator that continued 
participation is prudent.
Every effort should be made to obtain information on patients who withdraw from the study. The 
primary reason for withdrawal from the study should be documented on the appropriate eCRF. 
However, patients will not be followed for any reason after consent has been withdrawn.
Patients who withdraw from the study after a dose of study therapy has been administered will 
not be replaced.
6.9.8 Study Treatment Discontinuation
Patients must discontinue study treatment if they experience any of the following:
●Symptomatic deterioration (i.e., uncontrollable pain secondary to disease) 
attributed to disease progression as determined by the investigator after 
integrated assessment of radiographic data, biopsy results, and clinical 
status.
●Intolerable toxicity related to atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab, including 
development of an immune-related adverse event (irAE) determined by 
the investigator to be unacceptable given the individual patient’s potential 
response to therapy and severity of the event
●Any medical condition that may jeopardize the patient’s safety if he or she 
continues on study treatment

Note: Assessments scheduled on the days of study treatment infusions should be performed before the infusion unless 
otherwise noted.
a. Examinations performed as standard of care prior to obtaining informed consent and within 28 days of Cycle 1, Day 
1 may be used rather than repeating tests, and within 45 days for radiographic imaging. If patients are declining 
cisplatin-based chemotherapy the reason must be documented.
b. All patients will return within 30 days for a follow up visit, including those who discontinue study therapy early.
c. See Section 5.8.
d. After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug, only serious adverse events caused by a 
protocol-mandated intervention should be reported. After initiation of study drug, all adverse events will be reported 
until 30 days after the last dose of study treatment. After this period, investigators should report any deaths, serious 
adverse events, or other adverse events of concern that are believed to be related to prior treatment with study drug. The 
investigator should follow each adverse event until the event has resolved to baseline grade or better, the event is 
assessed as stable by the investigator, the patient is lost to follow up, or the patient withdraws consent. Every effort 
should be made to follow all serious adverse events considered to be related to study drug or trial-related procedures 
until a final outcome can be reported.
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 84 of 121e. Only tumor tissue from initial TURBT and cystectomy are required per protocol. Tumor tissue from TURBT should be 
of good quality based on total and viable tumor content (sites will be informed if the quality of the submitted specimen 
is inadequate to determine tumor PD-L1 status). Fine-needle aspiration, brushing, and cytologic cell pellets are not 
acceptable. For core needle biopsy specimens, at least three cores should be submitted for evaluation. Ideally, a tumor 
specimen obtained after completion of the most recent therapy should be submitted. Any archival tumor specimen, if 
available, should also be submitted. Repeat TURBT or other tumor biopsies are not required after the start of 
therapy, prior to cystectomy, however if done at any point per local standard of care then all tissue available 
should be acquired.
f. For both atezolizumab and tiragolumab, the initial dose of study drug will be delivered over 60 (± 15) minutes. If the 
first infusion is tolerated without infusion-associated adverse events, the second infusion may be delivered over 30 (± 
10) minutes. If the 30-minute infusion is well tolerated, all subsequent infusions may be delivered over 30 (± 10) 
minutes. 
g. Tiragolumab dose will be administered following the dose of atezolizumab. If one agent (either atezolizumab or 
tiragolumab is held then both study drugs should be held.
h. ECOG performance status, physical examination, and local laboratory assessments (CBC, serum chemistries, urinalysis) 
may be obtained ≤ 96 hours before the scheduled visit. Laboratory procedures measured within 14 days of beginning 
treatment do not need to be repeated on Cycle 1 Day 1.
i. Vital signs include heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressures, temperature, weight, and oxygen saturation. Height 
should be recorded once during screening or prior to cycle 1 day 1. For first infusion of study treatment, the patient’s 
vital signs should be determined within 60 minutes before, during (every 15 [± 5] minutes), and 30 (± 10) minutes after 
the infusion. For subsequent infusions, vital signs will be collected within 60 minutes before infusion and at the end of 
the infusion. Patients will be informed about the possibility of delayed post-infusion symptoms and instructed to contact 
their study physician if they develop such symptoms.
j. All measurable and evaluable lesions should be assessed and documented at the screening visit. The same radiographic 
procedure should be used throughout the study for each patient. Available results must be reviewed by the investigator 
before dosing at the next cycle. Pathologic review of tumor response should occur at the first follow up visit after 
cystectomy. Patients will undergo assessments for tumor recurrence every 12 weeks (+/- 2 weeks) for the first 2 years 
following cystectomy. Patients who discontinue from the initial treatment stage for reasons other than disease 
progression (e.g. toxicity) will continue scheduled tumor assessments until disease recurrence, withdrawal of consent, or 
death. Patients who start a new anti-cancer therapy in the absence of disease recurrence (e.g. adjuvant therapy) should 
be followed according to the protocol schedule unless they withdraw consent. Investigators may perform additional 
scans or more frequent assessments if clinically indicated.
k. Tumor biopsy at recurrence, preferably at the time of radiographic progression. Patients may opt out of this biopsy. 
Acceptable samples include core needle biopsies for deep tumor tissue or lymph nodes or excisional, incisional, punch, 
or forceps biopsies for cutaneous, subcutaneous, or mucosal lesions. For core needle biopsy specimens, at least three 
cores should be submitted for evaluation.
l. Survival follow-up information will be collected via telephone calls, patient medical records, and/or clinic visits 
approximately every 3 months until death, loss to follow-up, withdrawal of consent, or study termination by Sponsor. 
All patients will be followed for survival and new anti-cancer therapy information unless the patient requests to be 
withdrawn from follow-up; this request must be documented in the source documents and signed by the investigator. If 
the patient withdraws from study treatment but not from follow-up, the study staff may use a public information source 
(e.g., county records) to obtain information about survival status only.
m. Hematology consists of CBC, including RBC count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, WBC count with automated differential 
(neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, monocytes, basophils, and other cells), and platelet count. A manual differential 
can be done if clinically indicated. 
n. Serum chemistry includes sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, BUN, creatinine, glucose, calcium, magnesium, 
phosphorus, total bilirubin, ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase, total protein, albumin and LDH
o. Specific gravity, pH, glucose, protein, ketones, and hemoglobin.
p. Serum pregnancy test (for women of childbearing potential, including women who have had a tubal ligation) must be 
performed and documented as negative within 14 days prior to Day 1.
q. HIV testing to be performed in accordance with national and/or institutional guidelines. Hepatitis B surface antigen, 
anti-HBc antibody and anti-HBs antibody should be collected during screening. In patients who have positive serology 
for the anti-HBc antibody, HBV DNA should be collected prior to Cycle 1, Day 1.
r. Serum will be banked and frozen during screening, however these assays will only be run to establish baseline values if, 
at a later point in the study, there is clinical suspicion of acute immune-related toxicity related to study drug.
s. Perform Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral capsid antigen IgM test at screening (See Section 3.3.2 Exclusion Criteria)
t. Perform creatine kinase (CK) testi
ng at screening, and as clinically indicated as determined by the Investigator
u. See Appendix 4 for details
v. ECG recordings will be obtained during screening and as clinically indicated at other timepoints. Patients should be 
resting and in a supine position prior to ECG collection.

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 86 of 1217 Reporting and Documentation of Results
7.1 Evaluation of Efficacy
7.1.1 Pathologic Response
Treatment efficacy will be determined by the pathologic determination of tumor response at the 
time of cystectomy. This will include determination of tumor response in the bladder as well as 
in any resected lymph nodes.
Pathologic determination should be in accord with collaborative guidelines33 and should 
specifically proceed as follows:
For all cystectomy specimens the pathologist will cut the tissue at roughly 0.5cm intervals to 
look for a tumor mass. If no tumor mass is seen on gross examination then representative 
sections should be put in. If cystoscopic abnormalities are noted by the treating Urologist, then 
the treating Urologist will indicate location of cystoscopic abnormalities (up to 4 different ones) 
on the pathology requisition, and that pathologists will “block in” each of these areas (up to 4 
different areas) during pathologic evaluation of the bladder to cover at least 1 cm square area of 
each indicated location. This is in addition to any grossly-recognized residual tumor foci that are 
seen when opening the bladder for pathologic evaluation.
It is similarly recommended that prior surgical sites or mucosal ulcerations be sampled in their 
entirety for residual tumor and adequate mapping performed. Furthermore, areas that appear 
red and regions of mucosal induration should be sampled to rule out CIS. There is no need for 
complete embedding of the entire bladder wall. Communication between the urologic surgeon 
and pathologist is key in cases where prior surgical sites, mucosal ulcerations, or alterations are 
not evident to ensure that appropriate tissue sampling occurs.
The following definitions apply to determination of pathologic responses:
Evaluable for pathologic complete response
Only those patients who have received at least one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease 
evaluated pathologically at the time of resection will be considered evaluable for pathologic 
response. These patients will have their response classified according to the pathologic 
complete response definitions below:
●Pathologic complete response (pCR): Defined as the presence of pT0 
disease. Similarly there must be no evidence of tumor in all resected 
lymph nodes (N0).
●Near pathologic complete response (near pCR): Defined as the 
presence of Ta or Tis disease (or both) in the resection specimen, without 
evidence of any higher stage disease elsewhere or evidence of tumor in 
all resected lymph nodes (N0).
All patients will be followed for 2 years post-cystectomy to evaluate for tumor recurrence.
7.1.2 Antitumor Effect – Solid Tumors
Response and progression in this study will be evaluated using the new international criteria 
proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee [JNCI 
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 87 of 12192(3):205-216, 2000]. Changes in only the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of 
the tumor lesions are used in the RECIST v1.1 criteria.
7.1.2.1 Definitions
Evaluable for toxicity
All patients will be evaluable for toxicity from the time of their first treatment with the study drug.
Evaluable for objective response
Only those patients who have measurable disease present at baseline, have received at least 
one cycle of therapy, and have had their disease re-evaluated prior to resection will be 
considered evaluable for response. These patients will have their response classified according 
to the definitions stated below. (Note: Patients who exhibit objective disease progression prior to 
the end of Cycle 1 will also be considered evaluable.)
7.1.2.2 Disease Parameters
Measurable disease
Measurable disease is defined as lesions (or tumors) that can be accurately measured in at 
least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) with a minimum size of 10mm by CT 
scan (irrespective of scanner type) and MRI (no less than double the slice thickness and a 
minimum of 10mm), 10mm caliper measurement by clinical exam (when superficial), and/or 
20mm by chest X-ray (if clearly defined and surrounded by aerated lung).
All tumor measurements will be recorded in millimeters or decimal fractions of centimeters. 
Previously irradiated lesions are considered non-measurable except in cases of documented 
progression of the lesion since the completion of radiation therapy.
Target lesions
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 lesions total (and a maximum of two lesions per 
organ) representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded 
and measured at baseline. Target lesions will be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with 
the longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by 
imaging techniques or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD.  The baseline sum LD will be used as 
reference by which to characterize the objective tumor response.
Non-target lesions
All other lesions (or sites of disease) including any measurable lesions over and above the 5 
target lesions should be identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at 
baseline. It is possible to record multiple non-target lesions involving the same organ as a single 
item on the case record form (e.g. “multiple enlarged pelvic lymph nodes” or “multiple liver 
metastases”).  Bone lesions may be measurable if ≥ 1 cm on MRI. Measurements of these 
lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each will be noted throughout follow-
up.
Non-measurable disease (Tumor Markers)
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 88 of 121Non-measurable disease is all other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions 
(longest diameter < 20 mm with conventional techniques or < 10 mm using spiral CT scan). 
Leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural or pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, 
lymphangitic involvement of skin or lung, abdominal masses/abdominal organomegaly identified 
by physical exam that is not measurable by reproducible imaging techniques are all non- 
measurable. (e.g. PSA, CA-125, CA19-9, CEA)
7.1.2.3 Methods for Evaluation of Measurable Disease
All measurements will be taken and recorded in metric notation using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations will be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 28 days before the beginning of the treatment.
The same method of assessment (for example CT or MRI) and the same technique will be used 
to characterize each identified and reported lesion at baseline and during follow-up. Imaging- 
based evaluation is preferred to evaluation by clinical examination when both methods have 
been used to assess the antitumor effect of a treatment.
7.1.2.4 Response Criteria
Evaluation of Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR)
Disappearance of all target lesions, determined by two separate observations conducted not 
less than 4 weeks apart. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must 
have reduction in short axis to <10 mm (the sum may not be “0” if there are target nodes).
There can be no appearance of new lesions.
Partial Response (PR)
At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter (LD) of target lesions, taking as 
reference the baseline sum LD. There can be no appearance of new lesions.
Progressive Disease (PD)
At least a 20% increase in the sum of the SLD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest 
sum SLD recorded since the treatment started and minimum 5 mm increase over the nadir, or 
the appearance of one or more new lesions.
Stable Disease (SD)
Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as 
reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started.
Evaluation of Non-Target Lesions
Complete Response (CR)
Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor marker level. All lymph 
nodes must be non-pathological in size (< 10 mm short axis).
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 89 of 121Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD)
Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) and/or maintenance of tumor marker level 
above the normal limits.
Progressive Disease (PD)
Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target 
lesions.
Evaluation of Best Overall Response
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started). The patient's best response assignment 
will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation criteria.

Duration of Response
Duration of overall response
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for 
CR or PR (whichever is first recorded) until the first date that recurrent or progressive disease is 
objectively documented (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest 
measurements recorded since the treatment started).
The duration of overall CR is measured from the time measurement criteria are first met for CR 
until the first date that recurrent disease is objectively documented.
Duration of stable disease
Stable disease is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for progression are 
met, taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.

Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 90 of 121Progression-free survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time 
of progression.
Disease-Free Survival
Disease-free survival (DFS) is defined as the duration of time from start of treatment to time of 
documented disease recurrence.
7.2 Evaluation of Safety
Analyses will be performed for all patients having received at least one dose of study drug. The 
study will use CTCAE v4.0 for Cohort A and will use CTCAE v5.0 for Cohort B for reporting of 
non-hematologic adverse events and modified criteria for hematologic adverse events, see 
section 5.7.
7.2.1 Specification of Safety Variables
Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and reporting adverse events (AEs) and serious 
adverse events (SAEs) that are considered related to study drug, all events of death, and any 
study specific issue of concern.
The Principal Investigator at the UCSF Coordinating Center will hold the role of Study Chair. 
The Study Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of the study and for monitoring its safety 
and progress at all participating sites.
7.2.2 Definitions of Adverse Events
7.2.2.1 Adverse Event
An adverse event (also known as an adverse experience) is defined as any untoward medical 
occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether or not considered drug 
related. More specifically, an adverse event (can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (e.g., 
an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) or other protocol-imposed intervention without any 
judgment about causality. An adverse event can arise from any use of the drug (e.g., off-label 
use, use in combination with another drug) and from any route of administration, formulation, or 
dose, including an overdose.
This includes the following:
●AEs not previously observed in the subject that emerge during the 
protocol-specified AE reporting period, including signs or symptoms 
associated with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder that were not 
present prior to the AE reporting period.
●Complications that occur as a result of protocol-mandated interventions 
(e.g., invasive procedures such as cardiac catheterizations).
●If applicable, AEs that occur prior to assignment of study treatment 
associated with medication washout, no treatment run-in, or other 
protocol-mandated intervention.
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 91 of 121●Preexisting medical conditions (other than the condition being studied) 
judged by the investigator to have worsened in severity or frequency or 
changed in character during the protocol-specified AE reporting period.
7.2.2.2 Adverse reaction
An adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event caused by the use of a drug. Adverse 
reactions are a subset of all suspected adverse reactions for which there is reason to conclude 
that the drug caused the event.
7.2.2.3 Suspected
A suspected adverse reaction is defined as any adverse event for which there is a reasonable 
possibility that the drug caused the adverse event. For the purposes of IND safety reporting, 
“reasonable possibility” indicates that there is evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between the drug and the adverse event. A suspected adverse reaction implies a lesser degree 
of certainty about causality than an adverse reaction.
To ensure consistency of AE and SAE causality assessments, investigators should apply the 
following general guideline:
Yes (definite, probably, possible, unlikely)
 
There is a plausible temporal relationship between the onset of the AE and administration of 
the {study drug}, and the AE cannot be readily explained by the subject’s clinical state, 
intercurrent illness, or concomitant therapies; and/or the AE follows a known pattern of 
response to the {study drug} or with similar treatments; and/or the AE abates or resolves upon 
discontinuation of the {study drug} or dose reduction and, if applicable, reappears upon re- 
challenge.
 
No (unrelated)
 
Evidence exists that the AE has an etiology other than the {study drug} (e.g., preexisting 
medical condition, underlying disease, intercurrent illness, or concomitant medication); and/or 
the AE has no plausible temporal relationship to {study drug} administration (e.g., cancer 
diagnosed 2 days after first dose of study drug).
 
For patients receiving combination therapy, causality will be assessed individually for each 
protocol-mandated therapy.     
7.2.2.4 Unexpected
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered unexpected if it is not listed in 
the investigator brochure or package insert(s), or is not listed at the specificity or severity that 
has been observed, or, if an investigator brochure is not required or available, is not consistent 
with the risk information described in the general investigational plan or elsewhere in the current 
application.
“Unexpected,” as used in this definition, also refers to adverse events or suspected adverse 
reactions that are mentioned in the investigator brochure as occurring with a class of drugs or 
as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but are not specifically 
mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation.
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 92 of 121Adverse events that would be anticipated to occur as part of the disease process are 
considered unexpected for the purposes of reporting because they would not be listed in the 
investigator brochure. For example, a certain number of non-acute deaths in a cancer trial 
would be anticipated as an outcome of the underlying disease, but such deaths would generally 
not be listed as a suspected adverse reaction in the investigator brochure.
Some adverse events are listed in the Investigator Brochure as occurring with the same class of 
drugs, or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, even though they have 
not been observed with the drug under investigation. Such events would be considered 
unexpected until they have been observed with the drug under investigation. For example, 
although angioedema is anticipated to occur in some patients exposed to drugs in the ACE 
inhibitor class and angioedema would be described in the investigator brochure as a class 
effect, the first case of angioedema observed with the drug under investigation should be 
considered unexpected for reporting purposes.
7.2.2.5 Serious
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if, in the view of either 
the investigator or sponsor, it results in any of the following outcomes:
●Death
●Life-threatening adverse event, its occurrence places the patient or 
subject at immediate risk of death. It does not include an adverse event 
or suspected adverse reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe 
form, might have caused death
●Inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
●A persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of 
the ability to conduct normal life function
●Congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother 
exposed to the IMP.
●Significant medical event by the investigator based on medical judgment 
(e.g., may jeopardize the subject or may require medical/surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above).
     
7.3 Methods and Timing for Assessing AND Recording Safety variables
The investigator is responsible for ensuring that all AEs and SAEs that are observed or reported 
during the study, are collected and reported to the FDA, appropriate IRB(s), and Genentech, 
Inc. in accordance with CFR 312.32 (IND Safety Reports). 
7.4 Adverse Event Reporting Period
The study period during which all AEs and SAEs must be reported begins after informed 
consent is obtained and initiation of any study procedures and ends 30 days following the last 
administration of study treatment or study discontinuation/termination, whichever is earlier. After 
this period, investigators should only report SAEs that are attributed to prior study treatment.

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 93 of 1217.5 Procedures for Eliciting, Recording, and Reporting Adverse Events
7.5.1 Eliciting Adverse Events
A consistent methodology for eliciting AEs at all subject evaluation timepoints should be 
adopted. Examples of non-directive questions include:
●“How have you felt since your last clinical visit?”
●“Have you had any new or changed health problems since you were last 
here?”
7.5.2 Specific Instructions for Recording Adverse Events
Investigators should use correct medical terminology/concepts when reporting AEs or SAEs. 
Avoid colloquialisms and abbreviations.
7.5.2.1 Diagnosis vs. Signs and Symptoms
If known at the time of reporting, a diagnosis should be reported rather than individual signs and 
symptoms (e.g., record only liver failure or hepatitis rather than jaundice, asterixis, and elevated 
transaminases). However, if a constellation of signs and/or symptoms cannot be medically 
characterized as a single diagnosis or syndrome at the time of reporting, it is ok to report the 
information that is currently available. If a diagnosis is subsequently established, it should be 
reported as follow-up information.
7.5.2.2 Deaths
All deaths that occur during the protocol-specified AE reporting period (see Section 7.3.3), 
regardless of attribution, will be reported to the appropriate parties. When recording a death, the 
event or condition that caused or contributed to the fatal outcome should be reported as the 
single medical concept. If the cause of death is unknown and cannot be ascertained at the time 
of reporting, report “Unexplained Death”.
7.5.2.3 Preexisting Medical Conditions
A preexisting medical condition is one that is present at the start of the study. Such conditions 
should be reported as medical and surgical history. A preexisting medical condition should be
re-assessed throughout the trial and reported as an AE or SAE only if the frequency, severity, or 
character of the condition worsens during the study. When reporting such events, it is important 
to convey the concept that the preexisting condition has changed by including applicable 
descriptors (e.g., “more frequent headaches”).
7.5.2.4 Hospitalizations for Medical or Surgical Procedures
Any AE that results in hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization should be documented and 
reported as an SAE. If a subject is hospitalized to undergo a medical or surgical procedure as a 
result of an AE, the event responsible for the procedure, not the procedure itself, should be 
reported as the SAE. For example, if a subject is hospitalized to undergo coronary bypass 
surgery, record the heart condition that necessitated the bypass as the SAE.
Hospitalizations for the following reasons do not require reporting:

Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 94 of 121●Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for diagnostic or elective 
surgical procedures for preexisting conditions
●Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization required to allow efficacy 
measurement for the study or
●Hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization for scheduled therapy of the 
target disease of the study.
7.5.2.5 Pregnancy
If a female subject or a female partner of a male subject becomes pregnant while receiving 
investigational therapy or within 5 months      of the last dose of study drug, a report should be 
completed and expeditiously submitted to the Genentech, Inc. Follow-up to obtain the outcome 
of the pregnancy should also occur. Abortion, whether accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous, 
should always be classified as serious, and expeditiously reported as an SAE. Similarly, any 
congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female subject exposed to atezolizumab 
and/or tiragolumab should be reported as an SAE.
7.5.2.6 Post-Study Adverse Events
The investigator should expeditiously report any SAE occurring after a subject has completed or 
discontinued study participation if attributed to prior atezolizumab and/or tiragolumab exposure. 
If the investigator should become aware of the development of cancer or a congenital anomaly 
in a subsequently conceived offspring of a female subject who participated in the study, this 
should be reported as an SAE.
7.5.2.7 Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)
AEs of Special Interest (AESIs): AEs of Special Interest are a subset of Events to Monitor 
(EtMs) of scientific and medical concern specific to the product, for which ongoing monitoring 
and rapid communication by the Investigator to the Sponsor is required. Such an event might 
require further investigation in order to characterize and understand it. Depending on the nature 
of the event, rapid communication by the trial Sponsor to other parties (e.g., Regulatory 
Authorities) may also be warranted      
Adverse events of special interest for this study include the following:
●Cases of potential drug-induced liver injury that include an elevated ALT 
or AST in combination with either elevated bilirubin or clinical jaundice, as 
defined by Hy's Law 
o Treatment-emergent ALT or AST  3  ULN in combination with total 
bilirubin  2  ULN
o Treatment-emergent ALT or AST  3  ULN in combination with 
clinical jaundice 
●Suspected transmission of an infectious agent by the study treatment, 
defined as: Any organism, virus, or infectious particle (e.g., prion protein 
transmitting transmissible spongiform encephalopathy), pathogenic or 
non-pathogenic, is considered an infectious agent. A transmission of an 
infectious agent may be suspected from clinical symptoms or laboratory 
findings that indicate an infection in a patient exposed to a medicinal

●Events suggestive of hypersensitivity, cytokine release, influenza like 
illness, SIRS, or infusion reaction syndromes, hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), and macrophage activating syndrome (MAS)
●Nephritis
●Ocular toxicities (e.g., uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis)
●Myositis
●Myopathies, including rhabdomyolysis
●Grade ≥ 2 cardiac disorders (e.g., atrial fibrillation, myocarditis, 
pericarditis)
●Vasculitis
●Autoimmune hemolytic anemia
●Severe cutaneous reactions (e.g., Stevens-Johnson syndrome, dermatitis 
bullous, or toxic epidermal necrolysis)
7.5.2.8 Other Special Situations Reports
The following other Special Situations Reports should be collected even in the absence of an 
Adverse Event and transmitted to Genentech:
Data related to the Product usage during breastfeeding
●Data related to overdose, abuse, misuse or medication error (including potentially 
exposed or intercepted medication errors)
●In addition, reasonable attempts should be made to obtain and submit the age or 
age group of the patient, in order to be able to identify potential safety signals 
specific to a particular population
●Product complaints
• A Product Complaint is defined as any written or oral information received from 
a complainant that alleges deficiencies related to identity, quality, safety, 
strength, purity, reliability, durability, effectiveness, or performance of a product 
after it has been released and distributed to the commercial market or clinical 
trial.

Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 96 of 1217.5.2.9 Recording of an Adverse Event
Adverse Events will be recorded as described in the Data Safety Monitoring Plan (Appendix 2)
7.6 Follow-up of Adverse Events
All adverse events will be followed with appropriate medical management until resolved. 
Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution or 
stabilization of the adverse event. For selected adverse events for which administration of the 
investigational drug was stopped, a re-challenge of the subject with the investigational drug may 
be conducted if considered both safe and ethical by the Investigator.
7.7 Reporting Requirements for Pregnancies
7.7.1 Pregnancies in Female Patients
Female patients of childbearing potential will be instructed to immediately inform the investigator 
if they become pregnant during the study or within 5 months      after the last dose of study drug. 
A Pregnancy Report eCRF should be completed by the investigator immediately (i.e., no more 
than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy) and submitted to Genentech. A pregnancy report 
will automatically be generated and sent to Safety Risk Management. Pregnancy should not be 
recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF. The Sponsor-Investigator should discontinue study drug 
and counsel the patient, discussing the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the 
fetus. Monitoring of the patient should continue until conclusion of the pregnancy. Any serious 
adverse events associated with the pregnancy (e.g., an event in the fetus, an event in the 
mother during or after the pregnancy, or a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the child) should 
be reported on the Adverse Event eCRF.
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, a Pregnancy Report worksheet and Pregnancy 
Fax Coversheet should be completed and faxed to Safety Risk Management or its designee 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy), using the fax numbers 
provided in Section 7.9.4).
7.7.2 Pregnancies in Female Partners of Male Patients
Male patients will be instructed through the Informed Consent Form to immediately inform the 
investigator if their partner becomes pregnant during the study or within 5 months      after the 
last dose of study drug. A Pregnancy Report eCRF should be completed by the investigator 
immediately (i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the pregnancy) and submitted via the 
EDC system. Attempts should be made to collect and report details of the course and outcome 
of any pregnancy in the partner of a male patient exposed to study drug. The pregnant partner 
will need to sign an Authorization for Use and Disclosure of Pregnancy Health Information to 
allow for follow-up on her pregnancy. Once the authorization has been signed, the investigator 
will update the Pregnancy Report eCRF with additional information on the course and outcome 
of the pregnancy. An investigator who is contacted by the male patient or his pregnant partner 
may provide information on the risks of the pregnancy and the possible effects on the fetus to 
support an informed decision in cooperation with the treating physician and/or obstetrician.
In the event that the EDC system is unavailable, follow reporting instructions provided in Section 
7.7.1.

Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 97 of 1217.7.3 Congenital Anomalies/Birth Defects and Abortions
Any congenital anomaly/birth defect in a child born to a female patient exposed to study drug or 
the female partner of a male patient exposed to study drug should be classified as a serious 
adverse event, recorded on the Adverse Event eCRF, and reported to Genentech immediately 
(i.e., no more than 24 hours after learning of the event; see above). Abortion, whether 
accidental, therapeutic, or spontaneous should be reported in the same fashion (because 
Genentech considers spontaneous abortions to be medically significant events).
7.8 Adverse Events Monitoring
Refer to the Data Safety Monitoring Plan, located in Appendix 2
7.9 Expedited Reporting
7.9.1 Reporting to the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee
If a death occurs during the treatment phase of the study or within 30 days after the last 
administration of the study drug(s) and it is determined to be related either to the study drug(s) 
or to a study procedure, the Investigator or his/her designee must notify the DSMC Chair (or 
qualified alternate) within 1 business day of knowledge of the event. The contact may be by 
phone or e-mail.
7.9.2 Reporting to UCSF Institutional Review Board
The UCSF PI must report events to the UCSF IRB according to institutional guidelines.
UCSF IRB website for guidance in reporting adverse events: https://irb.ucsf.edu/adverse-event
The PI at each participating site is responsible for reporting events to the IRB of record 
according to IRB guidelines.
The sponsor (UCSF) will be responsible for the distribution of safety information to participating 
investigators, where relevant, in accordance with local regulations.
7.9.3 Expedited Reporting to the Food and Drug Administration
If the study is being conducted under an IND, the Sponsor-Investigator is responsible for 
determining whether or not the suspected adverse reaction meets the criteria for expedited 
reporting in accordance with Federal Regulations (21 CFR §312.32).
The Investigator must report in an IND safety report any suspected adverse reaction that is both 
serious and unexpected. The Sponsor-Investigator needs to ensure that the event meets all 
three definitions:
●Suspected adverse reaction
●Unexpected
●Serious
If the adverse event does not meet all three of the definitions, it should not be submitted as an 
expedited IND safety report.
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 98 of 121The timeline for submitting an IND safety report to FDA is no later than 15 calendar days after 
the Investigator determines that the suspected adverse reaction qualifies for reporting (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(1)).
Any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction will be reported to FDA no 
later than 7 calendar days after the Investigator’s initial receipt of the information (21 CFR 
312.32(c)(2)).
Any relevant additional information that pertains to a previously submitted IND safety report will 
be submitted to FDA as a Follow-up IND Safety Report without delay, as soon as the 
information is available (21 CFR 312.32(d)(2)).
7.9.4 Expedited Reporting to Genentech
Investigators will be responsible for collecting all protocol-defined Adverse Events (AEs)/Serious 
Adverse Events (SAEs), pregnancy reports (including pregnancy occurring in female partner of 
a male study subject), other Special Situation reports, AESIs and Product Complaints with an 
AE where the patient has been exposed to Genentech Product.      The completed Medwatch      
report should be sent via fax or email       to Genentech Drug Safety at:
Fax:

●Relevant follow-up information should be submitted to Genentech Drug Safety as soon 
as it becomes available.
●                    All Non-serious Adverse Events originating from the Study will be 
forwarded in a quarterly report Genentech.
7.9.5 Case Transmission Verification of Single Case Reports
The Sponsor agrees to conduct the Case Transmission verification to ensure that all single case 
reports have been adequately received by Genentech via Sponsor-Investigator emailing 
Genentech a monthly line-listing documenting single case reports sent by Sponsor-Investigator 
to Genentech in the preceding time period. 
The monthly line-listing will be exchanged within seven (7) calendar days of the end of the 
agreed time period. Confirmation of receipt should be received within the time period mutually 
agreed upon.               
If discrepancies are identified, the Sponsor and Genentech will cooperate in resolving the 
discrepancies. The responsible individuals for each party shall handle the matter on a case-by-
case basis until satisfactory resolution.  The sponsor shall receive reconciliation guidance 
documents within the ‘Activation Package’.

requesting Party will bear the cost of the audit.
8 Statistical Considerations and Evaluation of Results
8.1 Determination of Sample Size and Power Calculation
Cohort A 
Multi-dose phase : With 6 patients in each cohort, there will be 80% of power to detect the 
effect size of 1.5 at significance level of 0.1. For the lowest dose level, a 2-fold increase from 
pre-treatment to post- treatment is expected, if at the higher dose level, there is more than 3-fold 
increase, assuming the standard deviation equals 1, then there will be 80% power to detect 
significant treatment effect on the intratumoral immune response.
Expansion phase: Data from a study of intravesical valrubicin chemotherapy in BCG refractory 
patients34 demonstrated that a 21% CR rate is achievable at 6 months. Assuming a 5% (null) 
CR rate for untreated patients at 6 months, 15 patients would be required to observe an 
improvement to a 36% CR rate at 6 months in response to-PD-L1 therapy (effect size = 0.642), 
at a significance level of 0.1 with 80% power.
Cohort B 
A pT0 rate at cystectomy was observed for ~30% of patients treated with immune checkpoint 
inhibitors monotherapy based on published Phase II clinical trials. In order to observe an 
improvement from a 30% CR rate (null hypothesis) to 60% CR rate (alternative hypothesis) with 
the combination of atezolizumab and tiragolumab a total of 21 patients are required in Cohort B 
assuming a significance level of 0.05 and 80% power.
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 102 of 121Using these assumptions, following a lead in safety phase of 6 patients at a combination 
regimen that is deemed to be safe based on the criteria outlined above, a further 15 patients will 
be enrolled at the same regimen. This will make a total of 21 patients to be treated in Cohort B 
with the intended regimen.
8.2 Interim Analyses and Stopping Rules
A stopping rule for safety will halt accrual to the study and prompt reevaluation of the regimen if 
unacceptable treatment-related toxicity (defined as any Grade 4 toxicity, any recurrent Grade 3 
toxicity, or any Grade 3 toxicity persisting more than 2 weeks), or treatment-related delay in 
cystectomy beyond 12 weeks (including both the treatment period and any delay due to an 
adverse event), is observed at a frequency of ≥33.3% 
No formal interim stopping rule for efficacy will be performed. This is due to the fact that immune 
therapies may require weeks to months to have efficacy, and therefore the true antitumor 
activity of atezolizumab and tiragolumab may not be apparent at the time of cystectomy. Rather, 
durable immune responses may be generated against the tumor and may prevent post-
cystectomy recurrence; this effect may not be detectable for months to years after study drug 
administration.
Furthermore, given the relatively small sample size of this study an interim stopping rule for 
futility based on longer-term clinical endpoints (i.e. relapse-free survival) is not considered 
feasible or warranted.
8.3 Analysis Plans
8.3.1 Analysis Population
All patients who receive any part of a dose of any study drug will be analyzed for safety and 
efficacy. Subjects who discontinue from study participation prior to receiving any dose of study 
therapy may be replaced after discussion with the Study Chair. Subjects who have received any 
dose of study therapy will not be replaced.
Demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized. In general, frequency distribution 
and percentage will be used to summarize categorical measurements, while mean with 
standard deviation and median with range will be used to describe symmetric and skewed 
continuous measurements, respectively. Univariate analysis among variables will be assessed 
using the two-sample t-test, Wilcoxon-rank-sum test, Chi- square test, as appropriate.
8.3.2 Analysis of Primary Endpoints
The immunologic effect of activity study therapy within bladder tissue will be measured by a 
change in the CD3+ T cell count/µm2 between the pretreatment biopsy and the cystectomy 
tissue following study therapy administrations. Immunohistochemistry will be performed in the 
Fong lab at UCSF per established SOPs. Based on prior experience tissue will be designated 
into 3 distinct compartments: benign epithelium, tumor centers, and tumor interfaces. Tumor 
interfaces will be defined as fields where malignant and benign epithelium are present. 
Automatic cell counts for single- and double-stained cells will be determined for each field with 
color-specific algorithms.
The cell count for each compartment will be reported as the mean for each of the five 
quantitated fields. Cells of interest will include CD3+ T cells, CD3+ Ki67+ proliferative T cells, 
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 103 of 121CD4+ FoxP3- helper T cells, CD4+ FoxP3+ regulatory T cells, CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, as well as 
PD-1 expression on the different lymphocytes. In collaboration with Genentech, PD-L1 
expression on both tumor and immune cells within the microenvironment will be assessed.
For each cohort, the change of T cell counts from pre-treatment to post-treatment will be 
calculated for each compartment as log2 of the ratio of post-treatment vs. pre-treatment counts. 
If different regimens are used (for example atezolizumab x 3 doses and tiragolumab x 2 doses) 
two-sample Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used to compare the difference of the change from 
pretreatment to post-treatment between cohorts to assess if the intratumoral immune response 
associated with increasing numbers of  treatments. No multiple comparison adjustments will be 
performed.
8.3.2.1 pT0 rate
Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of pathologic T0 rate at the time of cystectomy as 
defined in Section 7.1.1 will be obtained for subjects treated with atezolizumab and tiragolumab. 
Pathologic T0 rate at the time of cystectomy will be compared with the null hypothesis rate (see 
Section 8.1) separately by using one-sample proportion test.
8.3.2.2 Safety
Adverse events occurring prior to surgery will be summarized by maximum toxicity grade for all 
patients treated with the particular regimen. The toxicity grade for laboratory data will be 
calculated using NCI CTCAE-v4.0 for the (already accrued) Cohort A and using CTCAE-v5.0 for 
Cohort B, and the lab data will be summarized according to the subjects’ baseline grade and 
maximum grade for each cycle of therapy. The percentage of subjects requiring a treatment- 
related delay in surgery beyond 12 weeks from study start will be summarized using descriptive 
statistics. All treatment related adverse events that lead to delay in cystectomy will be graded 
using NCI CTAE-v4.0 or 5.0 as discussed above and will be recorded.
8.3.3 Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
8.3.3.1 Near complete pathologic response rate, 2 year relapse-free survival, 2 year 
overall survival
Point estimates and 95% confidence intervals of the near complete pathologic response rate, 
defined as the presence of only pTa or pTis in patients with T2 of greater disease at baseline, 
the 2 year RFS rate defined from study start until recurrence of disease or death from any 
cause, and the 2 year overall survival (OS) rate defined from study start until death from any 
cause, will be obtained for patients enrolled in the study, and compared with the null hypothesis 
rate (see Section 8.1) separately by using one-sample proportion test. RFS and OS will be 
obtained by Kaplan Meier method for the ITT population.
8.3.3.2 PD-1/PD-L1 expression and response
For each dose level as well as for each individual expansion cohort, Fisher’s exact test will be 
used to test the association of baseline tumor and T-cell PD-L1/PD-1 immunohistochemical 
expression with disease response.
8.3.4 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints: Tissue based endpoints
Note: Tissue will be used for multiple different exploratory assays. In the event that there is 
insufficient tissue to perform all assays for an individual subject, the tissue should be prioritized 
 UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center
Version date: 03-29-2021 Protocol CC#: 14524
Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 104 of 121for assays as follows, in which the first assay described is the highest priority. Also note that 
PD-L1 immunohistochemistry and immune cell mRNA signature assays will be performed at 
Genentech, while all other assays will be performed at UCSF.
8.3.4.1 Tumor PD-L1 assessment
PD-L1 protein expression on tumor tissue from pre-treatment biopsies, cystectomy specimens, 
and any other tumor biospecimens obtained will be evaluated immunohistochemically and 
scored on a scale of 0, 1, 2, or 3. This scoring will be used for the determination of relationships 
between tumor PD-L1 expression and clinical responses described above.
8.3.4.2 Tissue immune subset quantification and localization
For all subjects, immune cell subsets and localization will be summarized by changes from 
baseline to after treatment using descriptive statistics.
8.3.4.3 Immune cell mRNA signatures of response
To identify individual genes whose expression levels at pre-treatment are associated with pCR, 
we will apply two-sample t tests to compare responders and non-responders. Adjusted P values 
controlling for false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg method) will be derived. In addition, 
to assess association of pre-specified immune gene signature with response, the median 
expression level of the component genes will be used to represent the signature and two- 
sample t tests will be used. For genes or signatures that emerge as significantly associated with 
response, logistic regression models will be used to assess their independent association with 
response after adjusting for known clinical prognostic factors. To identify pharmacodynamic 
markers, paired t-test will be carried out to examine immune gene expression differences 
between pre-treatment and at-cystectomy samples. Additionally, association of gene expression 
levels at time of cystectomy with long term efficacy outcomes, such as PFS and DFS, will be 
explored using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Hierarchical clustering 
superimposed with response status, relevant baseline or prognostic characteristics or 
experimental factors will be performed using Spearman correlation and complete linkage to 
visualize the discriminating power of the immune gene expression and the correlative structure 
among the genes and the samples.
8.3.4.4 T cell receptor (TCR) deep sequencing
For each individual dose level, and for each dose-expansion cohort the change in tumor- 
infiltrating TCR between pre-treatment and post-cystectomy after treatment will be assessed by 
calculating the number of unique clonotypes comprising the top 25th percentile of cumulative 
reads after sorting by clone abundance. Repertoire change between sequencing experiments 
will be measured using Morisita’s distance. 
8.3.4.5 Genomic signatures of response
It is hypothesized that tumors with highly mutated or copy-aberrant genomes will either 
overexpress native proteins or express novel mutant proteins, both of which may be recognized 
by the immune system and serve as tumor-specific antigens. Therefore the effect of genomic 
mutations on the immune landscape will be investigated in each of the expansion cohorts in this 
study as follows.

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 105 of 121Tumor DNA will be isolated from pre-treatment tissue and from post-cystectomy specimens, and 
will be analyzed for copy number using the Human Genome CGH 244K Microarray (Agilent, 
Santa Clara, CA) and/or by next-generation sequencing. Results will be analyzed with DNA 
Analytics software (Agilent) and with the assistance of the UCSF Genome Core and the UCSF 
Biostatistics core. For copy number paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be applied to test 
difference of tumor gene copy number between pre and post treatment. Two-sample Wilcoxon 
signed-rank test will be used to test the gene copy number between tumor responders and non- 
responders for pre-treatment, post-treatment and changes before and after the treatment, 
separately. Multiple testing adjustment will be done by controlling false positive rate. Next- 
generation sequencing will take place using appropriate methods and biostatistical analyses.
Annotation will be based on NCBI and UCSC databases. Chi-square test will be applied to 
obtain the significant variants associated with the clinical response.
8.3.5 Analysis of Exploratory Endpoints: Immune endpoints
8.3.5.1 Immune cell activation
For each cohort individually, and for each individual expansion cohort, flow cytometry of 
circulating immune cell subsets will also be performed on pre-treatment blood and again after 
cystectomy. Established flow cytometry panels will examine T cell activation. Immune cell 
quantification will be summarized by changes from baseline to after treatment using descriptive 
statistics. Furthermore, paired Wilcox on signed-rank test will be applied to test the pre-post 
treatment changes. When available, immune cells digested from resected tumor tissues will also 
be assessed by flow cytometry.
8.3.5.2 Circulating antibody detection and characterization
Spotted antigen arrays will be used to detect circulating antibodies will be performed on sera 
derived from the pretreatment and post-cystectomy timepoints. After standard preprocessing of 
the protein array data, Cluster and Treeview software will be used for unsupervised clustering of 
the data with Pearson correlation and complete linkage. For each array, an antigen is identified 
as being detected if its value is above the median. To determine the number of up- and 
downmodulated antibodies, the difference in log2 intensity values of pretreatment and post- 
treatment samples will be taken for each patient to identify antigens that are detected 
differentially due to treatment. Number of antibodies with at least 2- or 4-fold difference between 
pretreatment and post-treatment samples will be compared between clinical responders and 
nonresponders by performing two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test.

10 Protection of Human Subjects
10.1 Protection from Unnecessary Harm
Each clinical site is responsible for protecting all subjects involved in human experimentation. 
This is accomplished through the IRB mechanism and the process of informed consent. The 
IRB reviews all proposed studies involving human experimentation and ensures that the 
subject’s rights and welfare are protected and that the potential benefits and/or the importance 
of the knowledge to be gained outweigh the risks to the individual. The IRB also reviews the 
informed consent document associated with each study in order to ensure that the consent 
document accurately and clearly communicates the nature of the research to be done and its 
associated risks and benefits.
10.2 Protection of Privacy
Patients will be informed of the extent to which their confidential health information generated 
from this study may be used for research purposes. Following this discussion, they will be asked 
to sign the HIPAA form and informed consent documents. The original signed document will 
become part of the patient’s medical records, and each patient will receive a copy of the signed 
document. The use and disclosure of protected health information will be limited to the 
individuals described in the informed consent document.

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 114 of 121Appendix 2 Data and Safety Monitoring Plan: Multicenter Phase 2 or 3 Trial with 
Safety Lead-In
1.Oversight and Monitoring Plan 
The UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (HDFCCC) Data and Safety 
Monitoring Committee (DSMC) is responsible for auditing data quality and participant safety for 
all HDFCCC institutional clinical studies.  A summary of DSMC activities for this study includes: 
●Review of all participant data in safety lead-in phase. 
●Approval to enroll past safety lead-in phase by DSMC Chair or Vice Chair. 
●Semiannual auditing after safety lead-in phase (depending on accrual). 
●Review of serious adverse events. 
●Minimum of a biennial regulatory auditing visit. 
 
2. Monitoring and Reporting Guidelines 
The Principal Investigator at the UCSF Coordinating Center will hold the role of Study Chair.  The 
Study Chair is responsible for the overall conduct of the trial and for auditing its safety and 
progress at all participating sites.  The Study Chair will conduct continuous review of data and 
participant safety at monthly UCSF Site Committee meetings.  The discussions are documented 
in the UCSF Site Committee meeting minutes. 
All institutional Phase II or III therapeutic studies with a lead-in are designated with a high-risk 
assessment during the safety lead-in phase and a moderate risk assessment. During the safety 
lead-in phase, the DSMC will audit all visits through the first cycle of treatment for all participants 
enrolled in this phase of the trial. 
After the completion of enrollment in the safety lead-in phase, the Study Chair will submit a report 
to the DSMC Chair outlining all AEs, SAEs, and DLTs (as defined in the protocol) with a request 
to proceed onto the next phase of the trial.  Within two business days of receipt, the DSMC Chair 
or designee will review the report and issue written authorization to proceed or a request for more 
information. The report is then reviewed at the subsequent DSMC meeting. 
After DSMC authorization to enroll beyond the safety lead-in phase is granted, study data is 
audited by a DSMC Monitor/Auditor on a semiannual basis with a random selection of twenty 
percent of the participants (or at least three participants if the calculated value is less than three). 
The DSMC Monitor/Auditor will audit a maximum of 5 cycles of treatment in the participants 
selected for review or until the selected participants discontinue study participation or the trial is 
closed with the IRB. Additionally, the assigned DSMC Monitor/Auditor will review no more than 
10 total participant charts during the course of auditing this trial.  DSMC Monitor/Auditors will send 
a follow-up report to the study team within 20 business days after the auditing visit is complete for 
the PI and the study team to resolve all action items from this report within 20 business days. An 
abbreviated regulatory review (i.e., reviewing protocol and consent versions, SAEs, PVs, DOA 
logs, 1572 forms, etc.) will occur at each participant monitoring review; however, a full regulatory 
review will occur on a biennially basis by the DSMC for regulatory compliance. 
The participating site’s source documents are audited remotely via either review of redacted 
source documents downloaded by the site into the CRA console of OnCore and/or via access to 
the site’s electronic medical records.  The DSMC Monitor/Auditor will audit no more than three 
participant charts at each participating site during the course of auditing this trial.

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 115 of 121Auditing of all enrolled participants in these trials will be complete after 20% of enrolled 
participants have been audited through five cycles of treatment.  However, regulatory reviews of 
the trial, safety reviews (i.e., Serious Adverse Event (SAE) reviews and Protocol Violation (PV) 
reviews), and audit/inspection preparation (as applicable) will continue until the trial is closed by 
the IRB.   
Multicenter communication  
The UCSF Coordinating Center includes the UCSF PI (Study Chair) and the UCSF study team. 
The UCSF Coordinating Center provides administration, data management, and organizational 
support for the participating sites in the conduct of a multicenter clinical trial.  The UCSF 
Coordinating Center will also coordinate monthly conference calls with the participating sites. The 
following issues will be discussed as appropriate: 
●Enrollment information. 
●Adverse events (i.e., new adverse events and updates on unresolved adverse events 
and new safety information). 
●Protocol Violations. 
●Other issues affecting the conduct of the study. 
 
Adverse events reporting to the DSMC will include reports from both the UCSF Coordinating 
Center, as well as the participating sites. The data (i.e., copies of source documents) from the 
participating sites will be downloaded into the PC console of OnCore prior to the remote 
monitoring visits in order for the DSMC to monitor the participating site’s compliance with the 
protocol and applicable FDA regulations. 
 
3. Review and Oversight Requirements 
3.1 Adverse Event Monitoring 
All Grade 3-5 adverse events (AEs), whether or not considered to be expected or unexpected 
and whether or not considered to be associated with the investigational agent(s) 
or study procedure, will be entered into OnCore®, UCSF’s Clinical Trial Management System.  
Adverse events are graded according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
(CTCAE) as developed and revised by the Common Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) of the 
National Cancer Institute.  Adverse events are further given an assignment of attribution or 
relationship to the investigational agent(s) or study procedure.  Attribution categories are: 
●Definite – The adverse event is clearly related to the investigational agent(s) or study 
procedure. 
●Probable – The adverse event is likely related to the investigational agent(s) or study 
procedure. 
●Possible – The adverse event may be related to the investigational agent(s) or study 
procedure. 
●Unrelated – the adverse event is clearly not related to the investigational agent(s) or study 
procedure. 
All Grade 3-5 adverse events entered into OnCore® will be reviewed on a monthly basis at the 
UCSF Site Committee meetings.  All adverse events entered into OnCore® will be reviewed on 
a monthly basis at the UCSF Coordinating Center Site Committee meetings.  All grade 3-5 
adverse events must be reported to the UCSF Coordinating Center by the participating sites 
within 10 business days of becoming aware of the event or during the next scheduled monthly 
conference call, whichever is sooner.  The UCSF Site Committee will review and discuss the 
selected toxicity, the toxicity grade, and the attribution assignment from the UCSF Coordinating 
Center and the participating sites.

Phase II – atezolizumab and tiragolumab  Page 116 of 1213.2 Serious Adverse Event Reporting 
By definition, an adverse event is defined as a serious adverse event (SAE) according to the 
following criteria: 
●Death. 
●Life-threatening (i.e. results in an immediate risk of death). 
●Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. 
●Permanent or significant disability/incapacity. 
●Gives rise to a congenital anomaly/birth defect, or cancer, or any experience that suggests a 
significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution that may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above. 
●Event occurring in a gene therapy study. 
●Event that changes the risk/benefit ratio of a study. 
●Any other event the Principal Investigator judges to be serious or which would suggest a 
significant hazard, contraindication, side effect, or precaution. 
 
Serious adverse event reporting will be in accordance with all IRB regulations. For trials 
conducted under an investigational new drug (IND) application, the SAE will be reported in 
accordance with Code of Federal Regulation Title 21 Part 312.32 and will be reported on a Med 
Watch form. 
UCSF IRB website for guidance in reporting serious adverse events: 
https://irb.ucsf.edu/adverse-event  
 
Med Watch forms and information: 
www.fda.gov/medwatch/getforms.htm 
 
All serious adverse events are entered into OnCore®, as well as submitted to the IRB (per IRB 
guidelines) via iRIS®.  All SAEs, whether expected or unexpected, must be reported to the UCSF 
Coordinating Center within one business days of becoming aware of the event.  The SAEs are 
reviewed and audited by the UCSF Data and Safety Monitoring Committee on an ongoing basis 
and discussed at DSMC meetings, which take place every six weeks. The date the SAE was 
sent to all required reporting agencies will be documented in OnCore®. 
If a death occurs during the treatment phase of the study or within 30 days after the last 
administration of the study drug(s) and is determined to be possibly, probably, or definitely related 
either to the investigational drug or any research related procedure, then the Study Chair at the 
UCSF Coordinating Center or the assigned designee must be notified within 1 business day from 
the participating site(s) and the Study Chair must then notify the DSMC Chair (or Vice Chair) and 
the DSMC Director within 1 business day of this notification. 
 
3.3 Review of Adverse Event Rates 
If an increase in the frequency of Grade 3 or 4 adverse events (above the rate reported in the 
Investigator Brochure or package insert) is noted in the study, the Study Chair at the UCSF 
Coordinating Center is responsible for notifying the DSMC Chair (or Vice Chair) and the DSMC 
Director at the time the increased rate is identified via a report. The report will indicate if the 
incidence of adverse events observed in the study is above the range stated in 
the Investigator’s Brochure or package insert. 
If at any time the Study Chair stops enrollment or stops the study due to safety issues, the DSMC 
Chair (or Vice Chair) and the DSMC Director must be notified within one business day and the 
IRB must be notified within their reporting guidelines.

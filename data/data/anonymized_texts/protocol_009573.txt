5. Cohort Identification  
 
Note. The feasibility counts were run on Optum® Clinformatics® version of Dec 23, 2021, for the study period between Dec 6, 2017, 
to Jun 30, 2021. The primary analysis will be run by implementing the protocol on refreshed data that includes data up to March 
30, 2022. Therefore, the cohorts for the primary analyses are expected to be larger than those of the initial feasibility analyses 
presented in this protocol. 
 
5.1 Cohort Summary 
This study will involve a new user, parallel group, propensity score-matched, retrospective cohort design comparing injectable 
subcutaneous semaglutide (once weekly) to standard of care, i.e., dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), sodium-glucose 
cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), other glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) - except for semaglutide oral and 
injection -, or 2nd generation sulfonylureas (SU). Treatments in both arms are administered in combination with metformin. 
Patients will be required to have continuous enrollment during a baseline period of 180 days before initiation of semaglutide or 
standard of care. The analyses will be restricted to individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are on treatment with 
metformin, defined as the presence of at least 1 prescription for metformin within 120 days (90 days + 30 days of grace period) 
before and including cohort entry.  The information for emulating the trial implementation is collected from clinicaltrial.gov, 
version submitted on September 7, 2022 ( [STUDY_ID_REMOVED] ), and questions to the trialists (responses received on September 26, 
2022). 
 
5.2 Important steps for cohort formation 
New use of semaglutide injection (exposure) is defined as no use of the exposure drug within 180 days prior to index date. New 
use of standard of care (comparator) is defined as no use of the DPP-4i, SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA (except semaglutide) or 2nd generation 
SU within 180 days prior to index date. Eligible patients are required to be new users with respect to both exposure and 
comparator groups, defined as no use of both exposure and comparator drugs within at least 180 days prior to index date.  
 
5.2.1 Data Source 
Optum® Clinformatics® Data Mart Database (CDM): Dec 6, 2017 – Jun 30, 2021  
The study will be conducted in the de-identified Optum® CDM because this database is linked with national lab test 
provider chains. Thus, the results for outpatient laboratory tests (including test results of HbA1c) are available for a subset 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making 
 
 4of approximately 45% beneficiaries. 
 
5.2.2 Eligible cohort entry dates 
Semaglutide injection, for subcutaneous use, was first approved by FDA to improve glycemic control in adults with type 2 
diabetes mellitus on Dec 5, 2017 (the approval of the comparator drugs for the same indication was antecedent to 2017). 
Thus, the initial eligible cohort entry date is the first date after the FDA approval available in the data.  
Although the primary analysis of the trial used an “intention-to-treat” (ITT) approach - as implied on clinicaltrial.gov and 
confirmed by the trialists -, we conducted a secondary analysis using an “as-treated” (AT) approach because of the nature 
of the real-world data (please refer to paragraph 6.3.2 for further details). Based on this decision we created two study 
cohorts which differ by the last eligible date of cohort entry: 
- COHORT ITT  - The last eligible date for the cohort that will be analyzed with an “intent to treat” approach is Aug 31, 
2020, ten months before the end of all available data in Optum® CDM. Since the effects of semaglutide, DPP-4i, 
SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA (except semaglutide) and 2nd generation SU on the outcome will be estimated between 275 and 455 
days after cohort entry, this will allow all eligible patients to contribute to the outcome (see Section 6.3). 
- COHORT AT  - The last eligible date for the cohort that will be analyzed with an “as-treated” approach is Feb 28, 2021, 
four months before the end of all available data in Optum® CDM. Since the effects of semaglutide, DPP-4i, SGLT2i, 
GLP-1 RA (except semaglutide) and 2nd generation SU on the outcome will be estimated between 91 and 212 days 
after cohort entry, this will allow all eligible patients to contribute to the outcome (see Section 6.3). 
-  
 
5.2.3 Specify inclusion/exclusion criteria for cohort entry and define the index date 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria were adapted from the trial as closely as possible. Definitions for all inclusion/exclusion 
are provided in Appendix A and are summarized in the flowcharts below. 
 
Note. Patients who do not start the follow up or are censored between cohort entry and the beginning of the outcome 
assessment window (i.e., COHORT AT : 0-90 days after cohort entry,  COHORT ITT : 0-274 days after cohort entry) for the 
reasons reported in the Section 6.3.2 will not contribute to the baseline characteristics of the unmatched or matched 
cohorts. Further details on the number of patients who are excluded from the study cohort are reported in Section 7.

6. Variables  
 
6.1 Exposure-related variables:  
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making 
 
 6 
Study drug:  
New initiation of injectable subcutaneous semaglutide (once weekly), a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. New initiation 
is defined as no use of semaglutide within 180 days before treatment initiation (washout period). New users of semaglutide are 
not allowed to receive DPP-4i, SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA (except semaglutide) or 2nd generation SU within 180 days prior to treatment 
initiation. Concurrent use of metformin is required. 
 
Comparator agent: 
New initiation of “standard of care” (oral). New initiation is defined as no use of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA (except semaglutide) 
or 2nd generation SU within 180 days before treatment initiation (washout period).  New users of DPP-4i, SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA 
(except semaglutide) or 2nd generation SU are not allowed to receive semaglutide within 180 days prior to treatment initiation. 
Concurrent use of metformin is required. In the pragmatic trial, “standard of care” was defined as commercially available 
antidiabetic medication other than semaglutide. In sensitivity analyses we will compare semaglutide with each of the drug 
classes included in the standard of care separately. 
 
6.2 Preliminary Covariates: 
 Age 
 Gender 
 Combined Comorbidity Index (CCI), measured over the baseline covariate assessment period, defined as 180 days prior to 
and including index date. 
 
Covariates listed above represent only a small subset of covariates that will ultimately be controlled for in the design and 
analysis. We use the covariates above only for initial feasibility analyses to judge whether there is likely to be sufficient overlap 
between treatment groups to proceed with the study. Remaining covariates are defined only after the study has passed the 
initial feasibility analysis and the initial power assessment and are listed in Table 1 ( Appendix B ).  
 
6.3 Outcome variables and study follow-up:  
 
6.3.1 Outcome variables 
 
Effectiveness outcome variables of interest (definitions provided in Appendix A ): 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making 
 
 7 
 Primary outcome:  
o Proportion of patients who achieve an HbA1c of less than 7.0% (53.0 mmol/mol) at the HbA1c test closest to 365 
days (allowable range: 275 to 455 days) after treatment initiation (ITT analysis, see paragraph 6.3.2.2). 
 Secondary outcome :  
o Proportion of participants who will achieve an HbA1c of less than 7.0% (53.0 mmol/mol) at the HbA1c test closest 
to 26 weeks (allowable range: 12 weeks to 30 weeks) after treatment initiation (AT analysis, see paragraph 6.3.2.1)  
o Changes in HbA1c from baseline to 26 weeks (AT analysis, see paragraph 6.3.2.1) or to 52 weeks (ITT analysis, see 
paragraph 6.3.2.2) after treatment initiation. 
o Number of hypoglycemic episodes leading to an inpatient admission or emergency room encounter (AT analysis, 
see paragraph 6.3.2.1) 
 
Note. In the emulation, as well as in the pragmatic trial, the HbA1c at baseline  is defined as the last recorded HbA1c value measured 
within 91 days before and including cohort entry date. The HbA1c at the end of follow-up  is defined as the recorded HbA1c value 
closest to 365 days and measured between 275 and 455 days (1 year +/- 90 days) after cohort entry for the ITT analysis and the 
recorded HbA1c value closest to 182 days (26 weeks) and measured between 91 and 212 days (12-30 weeks) after cohort entry for 
the AT analysis.  
 
 
6.3.2 Primary analysis and study follow-up 
Based on the information reported on clinicaltrial.gov and the answers received after contacting the SEPRA trialists, we learnt 
that dedicated study visits are programmed at randomization, at year 1, and at year 2 post-randomization. The study will also 
capture data collected at the sites during routine diabetic care visits, i.e., office visits and other patient contacts that occur as 
part of routine clinical practice. Routine diabetic care visits will occur per study physician’s routine clinical practice, therefore the 
number of visits and data available may differ from site to site and patient to patient. The outcome (HbA1c value) at baseline is 
defined as an HbA1c value recorded ≤ 90 days prior to randomization visit (week 0). The dedicated visit at 1 year is performed by 
the trialists at 52 (± 10) weeks) after randomization. If endpoint data at year 1 is missing or outside of 52 ± 10 weeks, then the 
routine diabetic care data closest to 52 weeks post-randomization ±10 weeks will be used. If no routine diabetic care data are 
available 52 (± 10) weeks post-randomization, then year 1 endpoint data will be considered missing and imputed, if applicable. 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making 
 
 8Because of anticipated shorter follow-up time in our data, we will not replicate the results of the trial at 2 years post-
randomization. 
Our RWE study will use an ITT analysis that disregards changes in treatment over the course of 1 year follow up as the primary 
analysis. However, to address potential differences in adherence due to measures or initiatives applied by the researchers of the 
SEPRA trial (e.g., routine calls, incentives etc.) and the high discontinuation rates in clinical practice, our emulation will include a 
secondary analysis focused on “as-treated” (AT) analysis which censors patients when they discontinue or switch treatments. In 
both ITT and AT analyses, the treatment drug will be defined as the index drug assigned on the day of cohort entry. Both 
analyses will use 1:1 nearest-neighbor matching on the propensity score to adjust for confounding with a matching caliper of 
0.01. 
6.3.2.1 ITT analysis 
In the ITT analysis patients will be followed between 275 and 455 days after cohort entry (1 year +/- 3 months). The outcome 
assessment window will start 275 days after cohort entry date and will continue until the earliest date of the following events:  
 Occurrence of the outcome of interest (HbA1c value measured closest to 365 days after cohort entry), 
 End of continuous registration in the database (disenrollment or end of available data), 
 End of the study period, 
 Death, 
 Nursing home admission. 
 
6.3.2.2 AT analysis 
In the AT analysis patients will be followed between 91 and 212 days after cohort entry. The outcome assessment window will 
start 91 days after cohort entry date and will continue until the earliest date of the following events:  
 Occurrence of the outcome of interest (HbA1c value closest to 182 days, measured between 91 and 212 days after cohort 
entry), 
 End of continuous registration in the database (disenrollment or end of available data), 
 End of the study period, 
 Death, 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making 
 
 9 Index drug discontinuation (discontinuation is defined by a gap of more than 60 days following the last days supply, episodes 
of treatment less than 60 days apart are bridged and treated as continuously exposed during the gap), 
 Crossover or addition of drug from the other treatment group, 
 Switching between the drug classes of the comparator group (i.e., DPP-4i to SGLT2i or SU or GLP-1 RA except semaglutide, 
SGLT2i to DPP-4i or SU or GLP-1 RA except semaglutide, SU to DPP-4i or SGLT2i or GLP-1 RA except semaglutide) 
 Addition of any other anti-diabetic medications, 
 Nursing home admission (nursing home admissions are considered a censoring event because the data sources utilized 
typically provide little to no data on drug utilization after admission. For the same reason we will exclude nursing home 
residents from our cohorts). 
 
6.3.2.3 ITT analysis 
In the ITT analysis patients will be followed between 275 and 455 days after cohort entry (1 year +/- 3 months). The outcome 
assessment window will start 275 days after cohort entry date and will continue until the earliest date of the following events:  
 Occurrence of the outcome of interest (HbA1c value measured closest to 365 days after cohort entry), 
 End of continuous registration in the database (disenrollment or end of available data), 
 End of the study period, 
 Death, 
 Nursing home admission. 
 
6.3.3 Sensitivity analyses:  
 Evaluate primary and secondary outcomes using fine stratification on the propensity score instead of 1:1 matching to 
boost power 
 Evaluate primary and secondary outcomes using each of the 3 drug classes included in the standard of care definition as 
the comparator (DPP-4i, SGLT2i, GLP-1 RA except semaglutide, or 2nd generation SU) to better understand class effects 
 
Note. To decrease the incidence of missing values of the outcome, we required that the eligible patients had at least 2 HbA1c 
measurements recorded within 280 days before and including cohort entry. This increases the probability of including in the final 
cohort patients who are adherent to a routinely HbA1c testing and, consequently, will decrease the frequency of missing values of the 
Effectiveness research with Real World Data to support FDA’s regulatory decision making 
 
 10 outcome. After assessing the diagnostics for different techniques to handle missing values (i.e., complete case analysis, multiple 
imputation, and IPCW) of the outcome, we decided to apply the multiple imputation technique to the primary analysis and test the 
robustness of the results with a sensitivity analysis applying the complete case analysis technique.

Without the SEPRA protocol, we were unable to ascertain the assumptions of the trial’s power calculation. However, we assume that 
our power is similar to the power in the trial because we anticipate that the refreshed Optum Clinformatics data on which we will run 
our primary analysis will result in cohorts that exceed the target number of participants in each arm of the trial (see Table below).”

In order to complete the initial power analysis, the dummy outcome of a 90-day gap in database enrollment will be used. This 
outcome is used to ensure that no information on the comparative risks of the outcomes of interest are available at this stage. 
Complete a 1:1 PS-matched comparative analysis using this outcome. PS should include only 3 covariates: age, gender and combined 
comorbidity index.  
 
 Stop analyses until feasibility and power are reviewed by primary investigators and FDA. Reviewers evaluate the results of the 
analyses described above in Sections 7 and 8, including numbers of patients, patient characteristics, follow-up time, and reasons 
for censoring by treatment group, as well as overall rates of outcomes and study power. These parameters are re-evaluated and 
reported in the subsequent sections, after incorporating feedback and refining the protocol.

After review of initial feasibility and power analyses, complete creation of the remaining covariates from Section 6.2. Again, using the 
dummy outcome of a 90-day gap in database enrollment, complete a 1:1 PS-matched analysis. The PS should include the complete 
list of covariates. In the feasibility analysis, calendar time is included in the PS model as continuous variable, using quarters as unit of

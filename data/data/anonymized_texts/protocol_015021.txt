STUDY SITES:  Up to 6  sites in the United States (US).  
STUDY OBJECTIVES:  
Primary  
• To assess pain control following HTX -011 as part of a scheduled non -opioid multimodal analgesic 
(MMA) regimen in subjects undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) . 
Secondary  
• To assess total opioid use following HTX -011 as part of a scheduled non -opioid MMA  regimen in 
this study population.  
• To assess the proportion of subjects who are opioid -free after receiving HTX -011 as part of a 
scheduled non -opioid MMA regimen in this study population.  
• To assess the safety and tolerability of HTX -011 in a multimodal setting in this study population.  
• To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK)  parameters  of bupivacaine and meloxicam in this study 
population . 
BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY: Up to 70% of patients have moderate to 
severe pain after surgery, and as a  result, many receive opioids. Poorly managed pain and opioid -related 
adverse reactions resulting in worse patient outcomes and increased hospital costs . Opioid use also 
increases the risk of long -term use and abuse. Therefore, there is a significant unmet  need for a more 
effective non -opioid analgesic that provides sustained pain relief and reduces or eliminates the need for 
opioids, especially in the first 72  hours following surgery.  
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. (Heron) has developed HTX -011 for application i nto the surgical site to reduce 
postoperative pain for 72 hours and the need for opioid analgesics. HTX -011 is a novel , non-opioid, 
fixed -dose, extended -release anesthetic contain ing bupivacaine and low -dose meloxicam formulated in a 
proprietary polymer th at enables extended release of the products simultaneously for approximately 
3 days. Bupivacaine is an amide -type local anesthetic and meloxicam is a nonsteroidal anti -inflammatory 
drug (NSAID). HTX -011 is administered as a single dose. In a prior Phase 2b  study in TKA (Study 209), 
HTX -011 400 mg/12 mg with or without ropivacaine injected into the posterior capsule significantly 
reduced pain over 48  hours and 72 hours compared with saline placebo despite the absence of a 
background scheduled MMA regimen . Although almost all subjects required opioid rescue during the 
72-hour postoperative period, HTX -011 re duced total opioid consumption.  
This Phase  3b study will evaluate if HTX -011 administered as the foundation of a scheduled non -opioid 
MMA regimen can further improve pain control and lead to greater reduc tion or eliminat e the need for 
opioids  following primary unilateral TKA . Multimodal analgesia for the treatment of postoperative pain is

Confidential  5 recommended in the American Pain Society guidelines. The analgesic r egimen in Cohorts 1 to 3 in this 
study, acetaminophen and celecoxib, was selected based on published literature. Acetaminophen and 
celecoxib have different mechanisms of action and may therefore increase effectiveness without 
increasing risk.  The study wil l also evaluate the contribution of bupivacaine HCl injection into the 
posterior capsule on the r eduction of postoperative pain  in Cohort 3 . 
An additional fourth cohort has been added to test the hypoth esis that the postoperative non specific 
cyclooxygenase  (COX) inhibition of ibuprofen will contribute more to postoperative analgesia and 
therefore work better with HTX -011, as opposed to the COX -2 specific inhibition gained from celecoxib, 
which contributes more to an anti -inflammatory effect and therefore ma y be duplicative to the impact of 
the local meloxicam applied as part of HTX -011. 
METHODOLOGY:  This is a Phase  3b, open -label , multicohort  study in which all subjects will receive 
HTX -011 as part of a scheduled non -opioid MMA regimen.   
Study Overview  
Subjects will be screened within 28 days prior to the planned surgery date and eligibility will be 
confirmed on the day of surgery. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study 
and will undergo primary unilateral TKA under bupiv acaine spinal anesthesia  (≤20 mg) .  
All subjects will receive HTX -011 as part of a non -opioid MMA regimen consisting of acetaminophen, an 
NSAID, and a gabapentanoid prior to surgery, a single dose of HTX -011 during surgery, and scheduled 
acetaminophen and an NSAID for 7 days following surgery. Up to 115 subjects will be dosed in 
4 sequential cohorts:   
• Cohort 1: Approximately 50 subjects will be administered  a single dose of HTX -011 400  mg/12  mg 
via periarticular application into th e surgical site during su rgery.  
• Cohort 2: Approximately 15 subjects will be administered a single dose of HTX -011 400  mg/12  mg 
via periarticular application into the surgical site during surgery. Drain s will be prohibited.  
• Cohort 3: Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized into 2  groups. In Group A, subjects will be 
administered a single dose of HTX -011 300  mg/9  mg via periarticular application into the surgical 
site during surgery. In Group B, subjects will be administered a single dose of HTX -011 
300 mg/9  mg via periarticu lar application into the surgical site and 10 0 mg bupivacaine HCl injected 
into the posterior capsule during surg ery. Drains will be prohibited.  
• Cohort 4: Up to a pproximately 20 subjects will be administered a single dose of HTX -011 
400 mg/12  mg via periar ticular application into the surgical site during surgery.  
On the day of surgery (Day  1), subjects will be administered oral (PO) acetaminophen 1  g, PO celecoxib 
200 mg, and PO pregabalin 300 mg just before being taken to the operating room. During surgery, a 
single dose of HTX -011 will be administered via periarticular application into the surgical site  in all study 
cohorts . Bupivacaine HCl will be administered into the posterior capsule in Group B  of Cohort 3 . The use 
of intravenous (IV) fentanyl u p to 4  μg/kg will be permitted during surgery for intraoperative pain 
control.  Subjects will remain in the hospital/research facility for 72  hours from the start of study drug 
administration to undergo postoperative efficacy, safety, and PK assessments.  
Subjects will receive a scheduled non -opioid MMA regimen over the 72 -hour postoperative period 
consisting of PO acetaminophen 1 g every 8 hours and PO celecoxib 200 mg every 12  hours  (Cohorts 1 , 
2, and  3) or PO acetaminophen 1 g every 8 hours and PO ibuprof en 600 mg every 6  hours (Cohort 4) .  
After the 72 -hour assessments have been completed, subjects may be discharged. Subject s in all cohorts 
will continue a scheduled MMA regimen for 4 days after discharge consisting of PO ibuprofen alternating 
with PO acetaminophen. Thereafter, subjects may continue acetaminophen and/or ibuprofen as needed. 
Subjects will return to the study site on Days 11 an d 29 for follow -up assessments.

TKA Study of HTX -011 i n an MMA Regimen  
Confidential  6 Inpatient Postoperative Rescue Medication  
During the 72 -hour postoperative perio d, subjects should only receive rescue medication upon request for 
pain control. Rescue medication should not be given for pain prophylaxis, but only for treating 
postoperative pain. Prior to the administration of the first dose of rescue medication, if th e subject has not 
already had at least 1 postoperative pain score assessed, then pain intensity  scores using the visual 
analog ue scale (VAS) and numeric rating scale (NRS) must be obtained.  
Postoperative rescue medication will consist only of any 1 or more  of the following opioid medications, 
as needed:  PO immediate -release oxycodone (≤10  mg within a 4 -hour period), IV morphine (2.5 mg to 
5 mg within a 4 -hour period), and/or IV hydromorphone (0.5 mg to 1.0 mg within a 4 -hour period). 
Combination products co ntaining an opioid and non -opioid are not allowed. With the exception of the 
protocol -specified MMA medications , no other analgesic agents , including other NSAIDs, are permitted 
during the 72 -hour postoperative period. Note: Acetaminophen is not to be given as a rescue medication 
as it is part of the postoperative scheduled MMA regimen.  
Opioid Prescriptions at and After Discharge  
If a subject did not receive any opioids or received < 10 mg of ox ycodone within 12 hours prior to 
discharge, the subject should not receive an opioid prescription at discharge. If a subject received ≥ 10 mg 
of oxycodone within 12 hours prior to discharge, the Investigator may provide the subject with a 
prescription for immediate -release PO oxycodone tablets : no more than thirty 5 mg immediate -release 
oxycodone, take 1  to 2 pills ( 5 mg to 10 mg ) every 4 hours as needed . The prescription must indicate that 
substitutions with any other opioid -containing product are not permi tted, including combination 
opioid/non -opioid products.  
Sites will record if subjects are discharged with an opioid prescription and information about the opioid 
prescription . All subjects (whether or not they were discharged with an opioid prescription) w ill be 
provided a daily diary to record any opioid medication use from discharge through the Day  11 Visit. Sites 
will record all site - or subject -initiated contact between discharge and the Day 11 Visit and if any contact 
resulted in issuing an opioid pres cription.  
Postoperative Analgesia After Discharge  
Upon discharge, subjects will be instructed to manage their pain while awake over the next 4 days with 
the following scheduled MMA regimen: PO ibuprofen 600 mg every 6  hours, alternating with PO 
acetaminophen 1  g every 6  hours, so that an analgesic is taken approximately every 3  hours. Thereafter, 
subjects may continue one o r both of the MMA medications as needed, but should not exceed ibuprofen 
600 mg every 6 hours or acetaminophen 1  g every 6 ho urs (maximum ibuprofen dose of 2.4 g/day and 
maximum acetaminophen dose of 4 g/day).  
Other Scheduled Study Medications  
All subjects will also receive IV tranexamic acid (TXA) and PO acetylsalicylic acid for antifibrinolysis 
and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis , respectively . TXA 1g IV will be administered within 
approximately 4 hours prior to the start of surgery and a second dose will be administered up to 
approximately 8 hours later. Subjects will receive acetylsalicylic acid 325 mg PO twice a day ( BID) 
following surgery until discharge.  
Prohibited Medications  
Other than the protocol -required study medications , any drug formulation containing bupivacaine or 
meloxicam is prohibited before surgery (within 5 days for bupivacaine and within 10 days for 
meloxicam), during surgery, and following surgery through Day 11 Visit. Refer to exclusion criteria 4 
through 1 3 for medications that are prohibited during the study.

INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT, DOSE, AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
HTX -011 is a fixed -dose, extended -release  anesthetic that contains bupivacaine and low -dose meloxicam. 
Bupivacaine is an amide -type local anesthetic and meloxicam is an NSAID.  
. 
HTX -011 will be supplied by the Sponsor as a clear, pale yellow to yellow, viscous liquid in single -dose 
20 mL glass  vials.  
All subjects will receive a single dose of HTX -011. Subjects in Cohorts 1, 2, and 4 will receive 
400 mg/12 mg  (bupivacaine /meloxicam doses) . Subjects in Cohort  3 will receive 300  mg/9 mg .  
HTX -011 will be administered intraoperatively by periarticular application into the surgical site with a 
Luer lock applicator (without a needle) distributed to 3 areas : (1) the posterior capsule  (except Group B of 
Cohort 3) , (2) the anteromedial tissues and periosteum, and (3) the anterolateral tissues a nd periosteum . 
REFERENCE THERAPY, DOSE, AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION: None.  
ADDITIONAL STUDY MEDICATION, DO SE, AND MODE OF ADMINISTRATION:  
Additional study medication includes bupivacaine HCl , scheduled non -opioid MMA, and antifibrinolysis 
and DVT prophyla xis. Study sites will supply the additional study medication.  
Bupivacaine HCl  
All subjects will be administered bupivacaine HCl 0.5% or 0.75%, per institutional practice, as part of the 
spinal anesthesia during surgery. The dose of bupivacaine should not exceed a maximum of 20 mg 
(ie, maximum of 4 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% or maximum of 2.6 mL of bupivacaine 0.75%).  
Subjects in Group B of Cohort 3 will be administered 100 mg of bupivacaine HCl 0.25% or 0.5% as a 
40 mL injection into the p osterior capsule duri ng surgery just prior to placement of the prosthesis

walker  for balance. All subjects will be encouraged to ambulate as early as possible during the 
72-hour postoperative period.  
• Ability to participate in sche duled rehabilitation  sessions.  
• Whether the subject is discharged home or to a skilled nursing facility.  
• Opioid prescription at discharge.  
• Site- or subject -initiated postdischarge contact through the Day 11 Visit.  
• Opioid prescription after discharge through  the Day 11 Visit.  
• Subject daily diary to record whether opioids were taken from discharge through the Day  11 Visit.  
Safety Assessments  
• AEs from the time the subject signs th e ICF through the Day 29 Visit.  
• Physical examination.

STATISTICAL METHODS:   
Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of 115 subjects was selected empirically without formal statistical assumptions.  
Efficacy Analyses  
All efficacy analyses will be carried out on the Safety Population. All efficacy data will be listed and 
summarized  by cohort and by treatment group . 
Handling of Missing Data  
For any missing pain scores observed in subjects who complete the 72 -hour observation period, VAS and 
NRS -R scores will be imputed via last observation carried forward  (LOCF ), in which the most recent 
postdo se value is used for a subsequent missing value. For subjects who do not have a postdose value 
prior to their first missing value, the median of the postdose values at the relevant timepoint from subjects 
with observed data will be used. In subjects who wi thdraw from the study prior to the end of 72 -hour 
observation period, missing VAS and NRS scores through 72 hours that were to be collected following 
withdrawal will be imputed via worst observation carried forward ( WOCF ), in which the worst (highest) 
VAS and NRS -R scores observed prior to withdrawal will be used for post -withdrawal values through 
72 hours. Analyses that adjust for the effect of opioid rescue medication will perform windowed worst 
observation carried forward (wWOCF) following LOCF/WOCF (ie,  perform LOCF/WOCF first, then 
apply wWOCF). The number and percentage of missing pain intensity scores will be summarized.  
Safety Analyses  
All safety data will be listed and summarized by cohort and by treatment group. TEAEs will be coded and 
tabulated by  System Organ Class and Preferred Term. Incidence of TEAEs, SAEs, and ORAEs will be 
summarized. Associated laboratory parameters , such as hepatic profile, renal function, and hematology 
values , will be grouped and presented together in summary tables. Individual subject values will be listed 
and values outside of the standard reference range will be flagged. Changes in vital sign  parameters will 
be summarized.  
PK Analyses  
Plasma bupivacaine and meloxicam concentrations will be determined using validated liquid 
chromatography tandem -mass spectrometry assays. Concentrations will be calculated by interpolation 
from a calibration curve. PK parameters for bupivacaine and meloxicam will be calculated u sing 
noncompartmental analysis , as appropriate . Additional exploratory analyses may be performed, as 
appropriate, to facilitate cross -study comparisons and to fully characterize the concentration -time profiles 
of each analyte or other study drug components . 
In Coho rt 4, concentrations of alpha -1-acid glycoprotein will be summarized using descriptive statistics. 
As an exploratory analysis, ex-vivo protein binding of bupivacaine will be determined using equilibrium 
dialysis. PK parameters for free bupivacaine  will be calculated using noncompartmental analysis, as 
appropriate.  
Interim Analysis  
No formal interim analyses are planned.

TKA Study of HTX -011 in an MMA R egimen  
Confidential  15 Notes: The start of HTX -011 administration will  be considered Time 0 for all efficacy, safety, and PK assessments. For assessments at timepoints when the subject is asleep, an 
attempt should be made to wake the subject. If there is no response, the assessments at these timepoints may be recorded as “ Not Done.” Assessments that can be done without 
waking the subject (eg, blood collection for PK) should be completed.  When PK and pain intensity assessments coincide, the pain intensity assessments should be conducted 
before the blood draw. See Section  6 for more information on study assessments and procedures.  
a Subjects who withdraw from the study early will be asked to complete ET procedures base d on the timing of their withdrawal.  
b The urine drug screen and urine pregnancy test should be performed first. Results should be confirmed negative prior to performing any additional assessments and prior to 
initiation of surgery. Subjects with a positiv e drug screen who are taking an allowed, prescribed medication that is known to result in a positive drug test may be eligibl e for 
participation in the study.  Subjects who fail the drug test may be rescreened at the discretion of the Investigator.  
c Includ es height, weight, and body mass index calculation.  
d Only if subject withdraws prior to 72  hours.  
e If signs and symptoms of suspected LAST are observed, unscheduled vital sign measurements, 12 -lead ECGs, and blood sample collection for PK (all cohorts) and alpha -1-acid 
glycoprotein analysis (Cohort 4  only) must be promptly performed.  
f Only if subject withdraws prior to the Day 11 Visit.  
g TXA 1 g IV will be administered within approximately 4 hours prior to the start of surgery. A second dose will be administere d up to approximately 8 hours after the initial 
dose.  
h Administer PO acetaminophen 1 g, PO celecoxib 200 mg, and PO pregabalin 30 0 mg just before the subject is taken to the operating room.  
I From study drug administration until hospital discharge, subjects should receive acetylsalicylic acid 325  mg PO twice a day.  
j The first dose of the MMA regimen will be administered once the su bject is able to tolerate PO intake. For the first 3 days, the scheduled MMA regimen will consist of PO 
acetaminophen 1 g every 8 hours and PO celecoxib 200 mg every 12  hours  (Cohorts 1, 2, and 3) or PO acetaminophen 1 g every 8 hours and PO ibuprofen 600 mg every 6 hours 
(Cohort 4) . For the next 4 days, the scheduled MMA regimen for all cohorts will consist of PO ibuprofen 600 mg every 6  hours, alternating with PO acetaminophen 1 g every 
6 hours (maximum ibuprofen dose of 2.4 g/day and maximum acetaminophe n dose of 4 g/day), so that an analgesic is taken approximately every 3 hours while the subject is 
awake.  
k Prior to the administration of the first dose of opioid rescue medication, if the subject has not already had at least 1 post operative pain score as sessed, then VAS and NRS -R 
scores must be obtained.  
l Defined as the ability to walk at least 20 feet with optional use of a 4 -legged walker for balance. All subjects will be encouraged to ambulate as early as possible during the 
72-hour postoperative peri od. The date and time of first ambulation must be recorded.  
m Subjects will participate in rehabilitation on the evening of Day 1, and in the morning and evening of Days 2 and 3.  
n This study instrument assesses a subject’s potential readiness to be discha rged and should be repeated at all scheduled timepoints. It is not meant to be used to decide whether or 
not to discharge a subject from the study.  
o Preoperative blood samples must be collected before administering the spinal anesthesia.  
p All subjects (whether or not they were discharged with an opioid prescription) must be provided a daily diary at discharge to record opioi d use through the Day 11 Visit.  
q Subjects will complete a daily diary to record if they take any opioid medication from discharge through Day 11 Visit.  
r Subject diary results will be reviewed at the Day 11 Visit. If a subject recorded “yes” for taking an opioid, sites must reco rd the medication on concomitant medication eCRF.  
s Record all medications taken from the time the subject  signs the ICF through the Day 29 Visit.  
t Record all AEs from the time the subject signs the ICF through the Day 29 Visit.

TKA Study of HTX -011 in an MM A Regimen  
Confidential  24 1. INTRODUCTION  
1.1. Background Information and Study Rationale  
Up to 70% of patients have moderate to severe pain after surgery, and the most severe pain 
occurs within the first 72 hours (Apfelbaum 2003 ; Gan 2014 ; Lynch 1997 ; Meissner 2015 ; 
Misiolek 2014 ; Singla 2014 ; Svensson 2000 ). Administering a local anesthetic (eg, bupivacaine, 
ropivacaine, or levobupivacaine) perioperatively is a relatively simple and safe means of 
providing postoperative pain relief. A major limitation of most currently available local 
anesthetics is that th eir duration of effect is only 6 to 12 hours (Kehlet 2011 ). Consequently, 
many patients are given opioids to manage pain. The requirement for opioids postoperatively is a 
serious manifestation of ineffective pain control . Exposur e to opioids can lead to opioid -related 
adverse reactions resulting in worse patient outcomes and increased hospital costs (Cashman 
2004 ; Chan 2013 ; Coley 2002 ; Jarzyna 2011 ; Kessler 2013 ; Lee 2015 ; Lee 2016 ; Oderda 2013 ; 
Ramachandran 2011 ; Shirakami 2005 ; Stephens 2003 ; Wheeler 2002 ). Patients can quickly 
transition from acute opioid use to chronic use. Orthopedic surgery can be a point of first 
exposure to opioids for patients as it has one of the highest rates of opioid prescribing  (Morris 
2015 ). Reduced exposure to opioids and better pain management is associated with improved 
patient outcomes as well as reduced risk for the development of persistent pain and chronic 
opioid use and abuse  (Barnett 2017 ). Therefore, there is a significant unmet need for a more 
effective non -opioid analgesic that provides sustained pain relief and reduces or elimin ates the 
need for opioids, especially in the fi rst 72  hours following surgery.  
Heron Therapeutics, Inc. (Heron) has developed  HTX -011 for application into the surgical site to 
reduce postoperative pain for up to 72 hours and the need for opioid analgesics.   
 
 
 Bupivacaine and meloxicam are approved i n the United States ( US), Europe, 
and other regions and have a long history of clinical use.  Unlike other local anesthetics, 
HTX -011 is not injected; it is applied without a needle to coat the pain -generating tissues in the 
surgical site. After single -dose administration, the polymer enables extended release of 
bupivacaine and meloxicam simultaneously for approximately 3 days. Low -dose meloxicam in 
HTX -011 does not provide analgesic activity on its own (Viscusi 2017 ). Rather, meloxicam 
reduces the local inflammation caused by surg ery and normalizes the local pH , which enhances 
penetration of bupivacaine into the nerves, thereby potentiating bupivacaine’s analgesic effect 
(Dasta 2018 ). 
In a prior adequate and well -controlled Phase  2b study in total knee arthroplasty (TKA; 
Study  209), HTX -011 400  mg/12 mg (bupivacaine/meloxicam doses) with or without 
ropivacaine injected into the posterior capsule significantly re duced pain over 48  hours and 
72 hours compared with saline placebo despite the absence of a background scheduled 
multimodal analgesic (MMA) regimen  and with only opioid rescue medication options . 
Although almost all subjects requi red opioid rescue during the 72 -hour postoperative period, 
subjects who received HTX -011 demo nstrated lower opio id consumption through 72  hours  than 
subjects who received saline placebo or bupivacaine HCl . This Phase  3b study will evaluate if 
HTX -011 administered as the foundation of a scheduled non -opioid MMA regimen can further 

Protocol No: HTX -011-306, Version 6  Heron Therapeutics, Inc.  
TKA Study of HTX -011 in an MM A Regimen  
Confidential  25 improve pain cont rol and lead to a greater reduction or eliminate the need for opioids  following 
primary unilateral TKA . The study will also evaluate the contribution of bupivacaine HCl 
injection into the posterior capsule on the reduction of postoperative pain . 
1.2. Rationale for Study Design, Doses, and Control Groups  
This is an open -label multicohort  study. Cohorts 1 , 2, and 4  will evaluate  HTX -011 400  mg/12 
mg via periarticular application into the surgical site . This dose and administration technique 
were evaluated in the p rior Phase  2b TKA study (Study 209). Drains are no longer commonly 
used; therefore , Cohort 2 will prohibit the use of drains  to evaluate the impact, if any, on 
postoperative analgesia . 
Cohort 3  will evaluate HTX -011 300 mg/9 mg with or  without bupivacaine HCl 10 0 mg, a local 
anesthetic commonly used in TKA . The use of drains will also be prohibited in Cohort 3 . 
HTX -011 will be administered via periarticular application into the surgical site. Bupivacaine 
HCl will be injected into the posterior capsule to se e if anesthetizing that area contributes to the 
reduction of initial postoperative pain. The 100 mg dose of bupivacaine HCl injection was 
selected as this dose has been used in combination with liposomal bupivacaine in TKA (Dysart 
2016 ). As such, HTX -011 300 mg/9  mg was selected to use with 100  mg bupivacaine HCl to 
compare the efficacy of this cohort with Cohort 1 where HTX -011 400 mg/12 mg will be 
administered into the surgical site.   
All subjects will follow a scheduled non -opioid MMA regimen. Multimodal analge sia for the 
treatment of postoperative pain is recommended in the American Pain Society guidelines (Chou 
2016 ) and is supported by literature suggesting that using both acetaminophen a nd nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs  (NSAIDs) , which ha ve different mechanisms of action, can increase 
effectiveness without increasing risk (Ong 2010 ). The scheduled MMA regimen  selected for 
Cohorts 1, 2, and 3 (acetaminophen, celecoxib, and pregabalin before surgery and 
acetaminophen and celecoxib for the first 72 hours after surgery) is the same as  the PILLAR 
study , a randomized , controlled study that evaluated liposomal bupivacaine administered with a 
standardi zed MMA regimen  in TKA  (Dysart 2016 ; Mont 2018 ). The scheduled MMA regimen 
for C ohort 4 will be similar to Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, but includes ibuprofen instead of celecoxib 
during the first 72 hours after surgery. The hypothesis is that th e postoperative non -specific 
cyclooxygenase ( COX ) inhibition of ibuprofen will contribute more to postoperative analgesia 
and therefore work better wit h HTX -011, as opposed to the COX -2-specific inhibition gained 
from celecoxib, which contributes more to an anti -inflammatory effect and therefore may be 
duplicative to the impact of the local meloxicam a pplied as part of HTX -011. 
Pain will be assessed using 2 different val idated pain rating scales, the v isual analogue scale 
(VAS) and the numeric rating scale (NRS) (Breivik 2008 ; Haefeli 2006 ). The primary efficacy 
endpoint for this s tudy, area under the curve (AUC) of the VAS pain inte nsity scores from 
12 through 48  hours (AUC 12-48), is consistent with the study goal to assess pain control and is the 
same as the primary endpoint reported for the PILLAR study (Mont 2018 ). The primary endpoint 
is also consistent with Draft Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) Guidance for Industry on 
Analgesic Indications: Developing Drug and Biological Products (February 2014), which states 
that “pain intensity is the fundamental measure that defines the efficacy of an analgesic drug.”  
Safety assessments in this study are considered standard for clinical studies and this surgical 
model. Evaluations will include adverse event ( AE) and serious adverse event ( SAE ) recording, 
Protocol No: HTX -011-306, Version 6  Heron Therapeutics, Inc.

Confidential  26 hematology and serum chemistry, vital signs, physical examinations, and wound healing 
assessments.  
The pharmacokinetic ( PK) timepoints for this study were selected to characterize systemic 
exposu re of bupivacaine and meloxicam to confirm that exposures are consistent with historical 
values obtained in Study 209.  In addition, in Cohort 4 scheduled blood draws will also be 
performed to evaluate the impact of surgery on alpha -1-acid glycoprotein conc entrations, which 
impact s the free fraction of bupivacaine. If potential signs and symptoms of local anesthetic 
systemic toxicity (LAST) are observed, a blood sample for PK and alpha -1-acid glycoprotein 
analysis will also be collected . 
1.3. Potential Risks and Benefits  
1.3.1.  HTX -011 
As of 27 September 2019 , a total of 1,362  adult subjects ( 1,352  undergoing surgery and 
10 healthy volunteers) ha ve received HTX -011 as a single dose ranging from 30 mg/0.9 mg to 
600 mg/18 mg across 12 clinical studies . 
1.3.1.1.  Safety  
Safety data from 504 subjects who received HTX -011 via instillation into the surgical site in two 
Phase 3 studies (Study  301 in bunionectomy and Study  302 in herniorrhaphy) and two Phase 2b 
studies (Study 209  in TKA  and Study  211 in augmentation mammoplast y) were pooled for 
analysis. Results from these studies revealed that the safety profile of a single dose of HTX -011 
was similar to the well -established safety profile of bupivacaine HCl . The types of 
treatment -emergent adverse event s (TEAE s) reported for HTX -011 were generally similar across 
studies; t he most common TEAEs were nausea, constipation, dizziness, vomiting, and headache. 
These TEAEs were also the most common TEAEs in the saline placebo and bupivacaine HCl 
groups. Of these 5 most common TEAEs, t hose with an incidence higher in the HTX -011 group 
than in the saline placebo group were constipation (17.3% vs 14.6%), vomiting (16.9% vs 
15.0%), and headache (11.7% vs 8.9%). T he majority of TEAEs were mild or moderate in 
severity. The incidence of sever e TEAEs was low and similar across all treatment groups . 
There were no clinically meaningful differences in laboratory results, vital sign measurements, or 
electrocardiogram (ECG) findings. There was no evidence of LAST based on a comprehensive 
review of p otential LAST -related TEAEs, LAST assessment questionnaire responses, 
bupivacaine plasma concentrations , 12-lead ECG/Holter monitoring findings, and vital sign 
results . Finally, bone healing and wound healing  were not affected by HTX -011.

TKA Study of HTX -011 in an MM A Regimen  
Confidential  27 Serious Adverse Events  
As of 23 October 2019, no deaths were reported for subjects who received HTX -011. The 
incidence of SAEs in subjects who received HTX -011 was low (1.5%) and was similar to saline 
placebo (1.2%) and bupivacaine HCl (2.2%).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1.3.1.2.  Efficacy  
In Phase 3 studies in bunionectomy and herniorrhaphy, a single dose of HTX -011 (60 mg/1.8 mg 
and 300 mg/9 mg, respectively) significantly reduced pain and opioid consumption through 
72 hours compared with both bupivacaine HCl and sa line placebo. The efficacy of HTX -011 has 
also been demonstrated in Phase 2 studies in subjects undergoing TKA , augmentation 
mammoplasty, and abdominoplasty at HTX -011 doses up to 400  mg/12 mg. The efficacy of 
HTX -011 was also evaluated when administered a s the foundation of a non -opioid MMA  
regimen. In completed studies in bunionectomy and herniorrhaphy, the regimens resulted in 
further reduction of pain and opioid consumption.  
1.3.1.3.  Potential Risks  Associated With HTX -011 
An identified risk for HTX -011 is incision site erythema, which was observed primarily in 
bunionectomy. Most events were self -limiting, mild or moderate in severity, and resolved 
without intervention or sequelae.  Use of HTX -011 in subjects with allergies to or 
hypersensitivity to bupivacai ne, meloxicam, or any of the components of HTX -011 is 
contraindicated.  For more information on HTX -011, refer to the HTX -011 Investigator’s 
Brochure. For more information on the active ingredients, bupivacaine and meloxicam, refer to 
the local product labe ls. 
1.3.1.3.1.  Potential Risks Associated With Bupivacaine  
Potential risks for bupivacaine include dose -related central nervous system and cardiovascular 
(CV) system toxicity , including, but not limited to, perioral tingling, metallic taste, visual and 
auditory distu rbances, muscle twitching, seizure, acidosis, shortness of breath, bradycardia, 
hypotension, hypoxia , and cardiac arrest.  Cases of methemoglobinemia have been reported in 
association with local anesthetic use  (MARCAINE USPI 2018 ). Although all patients receiving a 
local anesthetic are at risk for methemoglob inemia, patients with glucose -6-phosphate 
dehydrogenase deficiency, congenital or idiopathic methemoglobinemia, c ardiac or pulmonary 
compromise, and concurrent exposure to oxidizing agents or their metabolites are more 
susceptible to developing clinical manifestations of the condition. Patients with a known history 
of glucose -6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency or w ith congenital or idiopathic 

Protocol No: HTX -011-306, Version 6  Heron Therapeutics, Inc.  
TKA Study of HTX -011 in an MM A Regimen  
Confidential  28 methemoglobinemia are excluded from this study. Close monitoring for symptoms and signs of 
methemoglobinemia is recommended.  
1.3.1.3.2.  Potential Risks Associated With Meloxicam  
Potential risks for meloxicam include the common AEs (≥5% an d greater than placebo) of 
diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infections, dyspepsia, and influenza -like symptoms (MOBIC 
USPI 2018 ). Other potenti al risks include CV adverse reactions, gastrointestinal bleeding, and 
abnormal liver tests . NSAIDs may cause an increased risk of serious CV thrombotic events, 
myocardial infarction, and stroke, which can be fatal. Patients with known CV disease or risk 
factors for CV disease may be at greater risk. NSAIDs may also cause an increased risk of 
serious gastrointestinal AEs including inflammation, bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of the 
esophagus, stomach , or intestines, which can be fatal. Patients with a prior history of peptic ulcer 
disease and/or gastrointestinal bleeding who use NSAIDs have a greater than 10 -fold increased 
risk for developing a gastrointestinal bleed compared to patients without these risk factors. 
Elderly patients are at greater risk  for serious gastrointestinal events. Elevations of one or more 
liver tests may occur in patients taking NSAIDs, including meloxicam. Exacerbation of asthma 
related to aspirin sensitivity, reduction in renal blood flow, and renal toxicity are reported risk s 
after exposure to NSAIDs. Serious skin AEs such as exfoliative dermatitis, Stevens -Johnson 
Syndrome, and toxic epidermal necrolysis, which can be fatal, can occur without warning. It is 
unclear how applicable these potential risks are for meloxicam when given as single dose via 
instillation into the surgical site (a novel administration method for meloxicam) for postoperative 
pain as part of a fixed -dose combination (eg, HTX -011).  
1.3.2.  Other Scheduled Study Medications  
Common , as well as uncommon but severe , adverse drug reactions that are associated with the 
other study medications are listed below. The Investigator should refer to the respective package 
inserts for detailed information  on risks associated with the scheduled study medications 
(bupivacaine , pregabalin, celecoxib, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, fentanyl, tranexamic acid 
[TXA ], acetylsalicylic acid) and any other approved medications that may be administered while 
a subject participates in this study (eg, anesthetic s, antibiotics).  
1.3.2.1.  Bupivacaine  
Poten tial risks associated with bupivacaine are addressed in  Section  1.3.1.3.1 . 
1.3.2.1.1.  Pregabalin  
Common adverse drug reactions  with pregabalin include  dizziness,  sleepiness, dry mouth, 
swelling of hands and feet, blurred vision, weight gain , and trouble concentrating . An u ncommon 
but severe adverse drug reactions, reported in a  small number of people, was suicidal thoughts.  
1.3.2.1.2.  Celecoxib  
Common adverse drug reactions  with celecoxib include headache, upper respiratory tract 
infections, dyspepsia, and diarrhea.  Uncommon but se vere adverse drug reactions include 
gastrointestinal ulceration, bleeding, and perforation. Other uncommon but serious adverse 
reactions which occ ur in <0.1% of subjects include syncope, congestive heart failure, ventricular

1.3.2.1.3.  Acetaminophen  
Common adverse drug reactions with acetaminophen include nausea, vomiting, headache , and 
insomnia. An u ncommon but severe adverse drug reaction  may include  severe  skin rash  and liver 
failure.  
1.3.2.1.4.  Ibuprofen  
Common adverse  drug reactions with ibuprofen are  gastrointestinal (nausea, epigastric pain, 
heartburn,  diarrhea, abdominal distress cramps or pain, nausea and vomiting, indigestion, 
constipation,  bloating and flatulence , decreased appetite ), dizziness, headache, nervous ness, 
tinnitus, rash, prurit us, fluid retention, and elevated liver function tests.  Less common but severe 
adverse drug reactions which can be fatal include myocardial infarction  and stroke, serious 
gastrointestinal bleeding, ulceration, and perforation of  the stomach or intestines,  serious allergic 
reactions , new or worsening of high blood pressure , congestive heart failure and edema , renal 
toxicity including papillary necrosis , and serious skin reactions  (such as exfoliative dermatitis, 
Stevens -Johnson syndrome, and tox ic epidermal necrolysis ). 
1.3.2.1.5.  Tranexamic Acid  
Common adverse drug reactions with TXA  include visual abnormalities, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, allergic dermatitis, and thromboembolic events. An uncommon but severe adverse drug 
reaction, h ypote nsion , has been reported when the intravenous ( IV) injection rate is too rapid . 
1.3.2.1.6.  Acetylsalicylic Acid  
Common adverse drug reactions  of aspirin include vomiting, stomach pain, heartburn, 
drowsiness, and nausea. Uncommon  but severe  risks include stomach ulcers, stomach bleeding, 
and worsening asthma.  
1.3.2.1.7.  Opioid Medication s 
Common adverse drug reactions  associated with opioids  include nausea, constipation, vomiting, 
headache, itchiness , dizziness, drowsiness, excessive sweating , and impa ired concentration and 
reaction abilities. Drinking alcohol may further decrease mental functions and increase the risk 
of liver damage. Uncommon but severe adverse drug reactions  include  hypoxia, respiratory 
arrest, cardiac arrest, hypotension, and/or sho ck. Opioids have the risk of addiction, abuse, and 
misuse, which can lead to overdose and death.

3.1. Description of the Study Design  
3.1.1.  Overall Study Design  
This is a Phase  3b, open -label , multicohort  study in which subjects undergoing a primary 
unilateral TKA will receive HTX -011 as part of a schedu led non -opioid MMA regimen. Subjects 
will be screened within 28 days prior to the planned surgery date and eligibility will be 
confirmed on the day of surgery. Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled and 
will undergo primary unilateral TKA under bupivacaine spinal anesthesia  (≤20 mg) . All subjects 
will receive HTX -011 as part of a non -opioid MMA regimen consisting of acetaminophen, an 
NSAID, and a gabapentanoid prior to surgery, a single dose of HTX -011 during surgery, and 
scheduled acetaminophen and an NSAID for 7 days following surger y. Up to 115 subjects will 
be dosed in 4  sequential cohorts:  
• Cohort 1: Approximately 50 subjects will be administered a single dose of HTX -011 
400 mg/12  mg via periarticular application into th e surgical site during surgery.  
• Cohort 2: Approximately 15 subj ects will be administered a single dose of HTX -011 
400 mg/12  mg via periarticular application into the surgical site during surgery. 
Drain s will be prohibited.  
• Cohort 3: Approximately 30 subjects will be randomized into 2  groups. In Group A, 
subjects will be administered a single dose of HTX -011 300  mg/9  mg via periarticular 
application into the surgical site during surgery. In Group B, subjects will be 
administered a single dose of HTX -011 300  mg/9  mg via periarticular application into 
the surgical site an d 100 mg bupivacaine HCl injected into the posterior capsule 
during surgery. Drains will be prohibited.  
• Cohort 4: Up to approximately 2 0 subjects will be administered a single dose of 
HTX -011 400  mg/12  mg via periarticular application into the surgical sit e during 
surgery.  
On the day of surgery (Day  1), subjects will be administered oral (PO) acetaminophen 1  g, 
PO celecoxib 200  mg, and PO pregabalin 300 mg just before being taken to the operating room. 
During surgery, a single dose of HTX -011 will be admini stered via periarticular application into 
the surgical site  in all study cohorts , as described in Section  5.1.5 . Bupivacaine HCl will be 
administered int o the posterior capsule in Group B  of Cohort 3 . The use of IV fentanyl up to 
4 μg/kg will be permitted during surgery for intraoperative pain control. Subjects will receive 
antifibrinolysis and deep vein thrombosis ( DVT ) prophylaxis medications as described in 
Section  3.1.3 . 
Subjects will remain in the hospital/research facility for 72  hours from the start of study drug 
administration to undergo postoperative efficacy, safety, and PK assessments. The study staff 
will follow standard  safety precautions to prevent postoperative falls. Subjects will receive a 
scheduled non -opioid MMA regimen over the 72 -hour postoperative per iod consisting of PO 
acetaminophen 1 g every 8 hours and PO celecoxib 200 mg every 12  hours  (Cohorts 1 , 2, and  3)

TKA Study of HTX -011 in an MM A Regimen  
Confidential  32 or PO acetaminophen 1 g every 8 hours and PO ibuprofen 600 mg every 6  hours (Cohort 4) . The 
first dose of the MMA regimen will be administered  once the subject is able to tolerate PO 
intake.  
After the 72 -hour assessments have been completed, subjects may be discharged. Subjects will 
be discharged with instructions to  follow a scheduled MMA regimen for 4 days after discharge 
consisting of PO ibuprofen alternating with PO acetaminophen  (all cohorts) , as described in  
Section  3.1.2.3 . Thereafter, subjects may continue acetaminophen and/or ibupr ofen as needed . 
Subjects will return to the study site on Days 11 and 29 for follow -up assessments.  
3.1.2.  Postoperative Analgesia Medications  
3.1.2.1.  Inpatient Postoperative Rescue Medication  
During the 72 -hour postoperative period, subjects should only receive rescue m edication upon 
request for pain control. Rescue medication should not be given for pain prophylaxis, but only 
for treating postoperative pain. Prior to the administration of the first dose of rescue medication, 
if the subject has not already had at least 1  postoperative pain score assessed, then pain intensity  
scores using the VAS and NRS must be obtained.  
Postoperative rescue medication will consist only of any 1 or more of the following opioid 
medications, as needed:  PO immediate -release oxycodone (≤10  mg within a 4 -hour period), 
IV morphine (2.5 mg to 5 mg within a 4 -hour period), and/or IV hydromorphone (0.5 mg to 
1.0 mg within a 4 -hour period). Combination products containing an opioid and non -opioid are 
not allowed. With the exception of the protocol -specified MMA medications , no other analgesic 
agents , including other NSAIDs, are permitted during the 72 -hour postoperative period. Note: 
Acetaminophen is not to be given as a rescue medication as it is part of the postoperative 
scheduled MMA regimen.  
3.1.2.2.  Opio id Prescriptions at and After Discharge  
If a subject did not receive any opioids or received < 10 mg of oxycodone  within 12 hours prior 
to discharge, the subject should not receive an opioid prescription at discharge. If a subject 
received ≥ 10 mg of oxycodo ne within 12 hours prior to discharge, the Investigator may provide 
the subject with a prescription for immediate -release PO oxycodone tablets : no more than thirty  
5 mg immediate -release oxycodone, take 1  to 2 pills PO (5 mg to 10 mg) every 4  hours as 
needed . The prescription must indicate that substitutions with any other opioid -containing 
product are not permitted, including combination opioid/non -opioid products.  
Sites will record if subjects are discharged with an opioid prescription and information  about the 
opioid prescription . All subjects (whether or not they were discharged with an opioid 
prescription) will be provided a daily diary to record any opioid medication use from discharge 
through the Day  11 Visit. Sites will record all site - or subjec t-initiated contact between discharge 
and the Day 11 Visit and if any contact resulted in issuing an opioid prescription.  
3.1.2.3.  Postoperative Analgesia After Discharge  
Upon discharge, subjects will be instructed to manage their p ain while awake over the next 
4 days with the following scheduled MMA regimen: PO ibuprofen 600 mg every 6  hours, 
alternating with PO acetaminophen 1  g every 6  hours, so that an analgesic is taken approximately

Confidential  33 every 3  hours. Thereafter, subjects may continue one o r both of the MMA medica tions as 
needed, but should not exceed ibuprofen 600  mg every 6 hours or acetaminophen 1  g every 
6 hours ( maximum ibuprofen dose of 2.4 g/day and maximum acetaminophen dose of 4  g/day ). 
3.1.3.  Antifibrinolysis and Deep Vein Thrombosis Prophylaxis  
All subjects wil l receive IV TXA and PO acetylsalicylic acid for antifibrinolysis and DVT 
prophylaxis , respectively,  consistent with clinical practice for TKA . TXA 1g IV will be 
administered within approximately 4 hours prior to the start of surgery and a second dose will be 
administered up to approximately 8  hours later  (Themi stoklis 2017 ). Subjects will r eceive 
acetylsalicylic acid 325  mg PO twice a day (BID) following surgery until discharge. Surgeons 
may also use additional DVT prophylaxis as per their standard of care.  
3.1.4.  Postopera tive Assessments  
Efficacy assessments will include pain intensity assessments using the VAS and the NRS; the 
use of opioid re scue medication; discharge readiness  and discharge information ; Patient Global 
Assessment  (PGA ) of pain control; the subject’s assessment of overall benefit of analgesia  score  
(OBAS) ; the subject’s satisfaction with their scheduled non -opioid MMA regimen; and 
ambulation and rehabilitation  assessments . 
Safety assessments will include AE recording , physical examinations, vital signs , clinical safety 
laboratory tests (hematology and serum chemistry), and wound healing assessment s. 
Blood samples will be collected for bupivacaine and meloxicam PK analysis  (all cohorts) and for  
alpha -1-acid glycoprotein (Cohort 4 only) . Blood samples ma y be used to evaluate other study 
drug components.

subject may receive study drug prior to randomization.  
4.2.1.  Procedures for Handling Subjects Who Do Not Meet  the Study Eligibility 
Criteria  
Subjects who fail to meet the eligibility criteria should not, under any circumstances, receive 
study drug. In the event a subject does not meet the eligibility criteria, but receives study drug, 
the Investigator should info rm the Sponsor immediately. The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor and the 
Investigator will discuss whether to allow the subject to continue on study.  
4.3. Blinding  
Not applicable becau se this is an open -label study.  
4.4. Subject Withdrawal and Replacement  
4.4.1.  Subject Withdrawal  
Subjects are free to withdraw from the study at any time without prejudice to further treatment. 
A subject may also be withdrawn from the study by the Investigator or the Sponsor at any time if 
either determines that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continue participation.  
Possible reasons for early withdrawal include the following:  
• AE. 
• Withdrawal by subject . 
• Death . 
• Lost to follow up . 
• Pregnancy.  
• Investigator’s decision . 
• Sponsor’s decision . 
• Failure to meet enrollment criteria at Day 1 . 
The date and the primary reason for early withdrawal will be recorded on the electronic case 
report form (eCRF). At the time of withdrawal from the study, every attempt should be made to 
complete the Early Termination Visit assessments  (Section  7.4). 
4.4.2.  Subject Replacement

All s ubjects will receive a single dose of study drug intr aoperatively while undergoing TKA . 
Study drug is defined as HTX -011 (investigational product). HTX -011 will be supplied by the 
Sponsor.  
Subjects in Group B of Cohort 3 will also be administered bupivacaine HCl via injection  into the 
posterior capsule during surgery. Bupivacaine HCl will be supplied by study sites.  
5.1. Study Drug (HTX -011) 
5.1.1.  Description of  Investigation al Product  
HTX -011 is a clear, pale yellow to yellow, viscous  liquid  supplied in single-dose, 20 mL glass 
vials. The vials serve only as a closed container for the drug product. For administration of study 
drug, the formulation in the vials will be aseptically transferred to sterile syringes  as described in 
the Pharmacy  Manual . 
5.1.2.  Manufacturi ng, Packaging, and Labeling  
HTX -011 will be manufactured according to Good Manufacturing Practices.  
HTX -011 will be packaged and labeled by the Sponsor or designee and will be packed and 
dispatched to comply with shipping and storage conditions. HTX -011 labeling will comply with 
all applicable national and local laws and regulations.  
5.1.3.  Study Drug Storage  
At the study site, H TX-011 should be stored at a controlled room temperature of 20 °C to 25°C 
(with excursions permitted from 15 °C to 30°C). To protect from light, HTX -011 should be 
stored in the original packaging until time of use. The study drug storage area should be locked 
with restricted access. A temperature log must be maintained to monitor the storage area’s 
temperature.  
5.1.4.  Study Drug Preparation  
HTX -011 will be prepared at the study site . HTX -011 cannot be mixed with water, saline, or 
other local anesthetics because the product will become very viscous and difficult to administer.  
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details on the study drug  preparation.  
5.1.5.  Study Drug Administration  
HTX -011 will be administered by periarticular application into the surgical site with a Luer  lock 
applicator (without a needle) to the following 3 areas : 
1. Posterior capsule  (except Group B of Cohort 3) . 
2. Anteromedial t issues and periosteum . 
3. Antero lateral tissues and periosteum.  
Protocol No: HTX -011-306, Version 6  Heron Therapeutics, Inc.

Confidential  41 The goal of this method of application is even distribution of the drug throughout the entire joint 
lining containing sensory nerve fibers including cap sule, synovium, and periosteum.  
Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details on the study drug administration.  
5.1.6.  Study Drug Compliance  
Because HTX -011 is being administered as a component of the surgical procedure, a lack of 
treatment compliance is not expected.  
5.1.7.  Study Drug Accountability  
HTX -011 provid ed for this study will be used only as directed in the study protocol . In 
accordance with Good Clinical Practice (GCP), Investigators are required to maintain accurate 
and up -to-date records of all HTX -011 to permit reconciliation . The Investigator or desi gnee 
must maintain adequate records of distribution, including the date received, number and units 
received, lot numbers , dispensing , and return or destruction of all HTX -011 (ie, accountability or 
dispensing logs).  
All HTX -011 records must be readily avai lable for inspection by the site’s Clinical Monitor 
and/or auditor . The Clinical Monitor is responsible for verifying the accuracy of the HTX -011 
records at the study site . All returns, disposal, or destruction must be approved by the Sponsor in 
writing.  
5.2. Injection of Bupivacaine HCl in to the Posterior Capsule  (Group B of 
Cohort 3 Only)  
Bupivacaine HCl 10 0 mg 0.25% or 0.5% will be administered as a 40 mL injection into the 
posterior capsule just prior to placement of the prosthesis (ie, 40 mL of 0.25% or 20 mL of 0.5% 
diluted with 20 mL of 0.9% Normal Saline for a total of 40 mL) . Bupivacaine HCl should be 
injecte d evenly with at least 10  to 15  injection points. Refer to the Pharmacy Manual for details 
on administration.  
5.3. Additional Scheduled  Concomitant Medic ations  
Anesthesia: Bupivacaine 0.5% or 0.75%, per institutional practice, will be administered as part 
of the spinal anesthesia during surgery. The dose of bupivacaine should not exceed a maximum 
of 20 mg (ie, maximum of 4 mL of bupivacaine 0.5% or maximum  of 2.6  mL of bupivacaine 
0.75%).  
Scheduled MMA Regimen: Just before being taken to the operating room,  all subjects will 
receive PO acetaminophen 1  g, PO celecoxib 200 mg, and PO pregabalin 300 mg. For the first 
3 days after surgery, all subjects will rec eive PO acetaminophen 1 g every 8  hours and PO 
celecoxib 200 mg every 12 hours  (Cohorts 1, 2, and 3) or PO acetaminophen 1 g every 8 hours 
and PO ibuprofen 600 mg every 6  hours (Cohort 4) . For the next 4 days, the MMA regimen for 
all cohorts will consist o f PO ibuprofen 600 mg every 6  hours alternating with PO 
acetaminophen 1  g every 6  hours ( maximum ibuprofen dose of 2.4 g/day and maximum 
acetaminophen dose of 4 g/day)  while the subject is awake, so that an analgesic is taken 
approximately every 3  hours.

Confidential  44 After 7 days of the schedule non -opioid MMA regimen, subjects may continue one o r both of the 
MMA medications as needed, but should not exceed ibuprofen 600  mg e very 6 hours or 
acetaminophen 1  g every 6 hours ( maximum ibuprofen dose of 2.4 g/day and maximum 
acetaminophen dose of 4 g/day ). 
6.2.2.  Prohibited Therapy  
6.2.2.1.  Medications Prohibited Prior to Surgery  
Any drug formulation containing bupivacaine or meloxicam is prohibited before surgery (within 
5 days for bupivacaine and within 10 days for meloxicam). Refer to exclusion criteria 4 through 
13 for medications that are prohibited prior to the scheduled surgery ( Section  4.1.2 ). 
6.2.2.2.  Medications Prohibited During Surgery  
Intraoperative administration of opioids or any other analgesics (including ketamine) , local 
anesthetics, or anti -inflammatory agents except as specified by the protocol (ie, HTX -011, 
bupivacaine , fentanyl) is prohibited, unless needed to treat an AE that occurs after signing the 
ICF, for pretreatment prior to a needle placement,  or to dec rease venous irritation (eg,  caused by 
propofol, in which case no more than a single administration of lidocaine 1% 20  mg IV may be 
administered) . 
6.2.2.3.  Medications Prohibited During the Postoperative Period  
With the exception of the scheduled non -opioid MMA reg imen ( Section  5.2) and permitted 
opioid rescue medications ( Section  6.2.1 ), no other analgesic agents, including pregabalin and 
other NSAIDs, are permitted through Day 11.  
6.3. Efficacy Assessments  
6.3.1.  Pain Intensity Assessment s 
Subjects will be asked to evaluate their current pain level at scheduled timepoints a fter surgery. 
The subject should be in the resting position (either seated comfortably or lying down) for at 
least 5 minutes prior to obtaining the pain scores. Pain intensity scores will be assessed using 
2 different pain scales: VAS and NRS (Breivik 2008 ; Haefeli 2006 ). Subjects will receive 
training by the si te on how to provide pain intensity assessments.  
The VAS consists of a straight 10 -cm line that represents pain ranging from “no pain” to “pain as 
bad as it could be” ( see Appendix  C). Subjects will be asked to mark their current pain level on 
the line. The distance between “no pain at all” and the subject’s mark defines the subject’s pain.  
The NRS is an 11 -point scale (0  to 10) where 0  represents “no pain” and 10  represents “worst 
pain imaginable” ( see Appendix  D). Subjects will be asked to rate their cu rrent pain level on this 
scale.

Confidential  45 6.3.2.  Use of Opioid  Medications  
6.3.2.1.  Opioid Rescue Medication Prior to Discharge  
The name, dose, and route as well as the date and time of administration of any opioid  rescue 
medication must be recorded in the subject’s eCRF during the 72 -hour postoperative period . 
More information on opioid  rescue medications permitted is provided in Section 3.1.2 . 
6.3.3.  Opioid Medication After Discharge  
All subjects (whether or not they were discharged with an opioid prescription) will be provided a 
daily diary to record any opioid medication use from discharge through the Day  11 Visit.  
Sites will also record all site or subject -initiated contact between discharge and the Day 11 Visit 
and if a ny resulted in issuing an opioid prescription.  
6.3.4.  Discharge Readiness  
Discharge readiness will be assessed using the MPADSS criteria, which considers a number of 
clinical variables: vital signs, ambulation, nausea/vomiting, pain, and surgical bleeding (Chung 
1995 ). This study instr ument assesses a subject’s potential readiness to be discharged and should 
be repeated at all scheduled timepoints. It is not meant to be used to decide whether or not to 
discharge a subject from the study. Subjects are required to remain in the hospital/r esearch 
facility for 72 hours. See Appendix  E for the MPADSS criteria.  
6.3.5.  Patient Global Assessment of Pain Control  
Subjects will be asked to evaluate their  pain control over the preceding 24 hours using a 4 -point 
PGA scale where 0  represents “poor” and 3  represents “excellent” (Rothman 2009 ). See 
Appendix  F for the PGA scale . 
6.3.6.  Overall Benefit of Analgesia Assessment  
Subjects will be questioned about their overall benefit of analgesia using a 7-item, 
multidimensional, quality assessment questionnaire  (Lehmann 2010 ). The 7 items address pain, 
vomiting, itching, sweating, freezing, dizziness, and overall satisfaction with postoperative pain 
and make up the OBAS. See Appendix  G for the OBAS scale.  
6.3.7.  Treatment Satisfaction  
Subjects will be asked to evaluate their satisfaction with their scheduled non -opioid MMA 
regimen for the treatment of their TKA -related pain using the TSQM -9 (Bharmal 2009 ). Subjects 
will answer 9 questions related to effectiveness, convenience, and global satisfacti on (see 
Appendix  H). 
6.3.8.  Ambulation and Rehabilitation  
Sites will assess the subject’s time to ambulate. Ambulation is defined as the ability walk at least 
20 feet with optional use of a 4-legged walker  for balance. All subjects will be encouraged to 
ambulate as early as possible during the 72 -hour postoperative period.  The date and time of first 
ambulation must be recorded.

Confidential  46 Sites will also assess the subject’s ability to participate in scheduled rehabilitation  sessions on the 
evening of Day 1 and in the morning and evening of Days 2 and 3  according to institution’s 
guidelines . 
6.3.9.  Discharge Information  
Sites will record when subj ects are discharged and if subjects are discharged home or to a skilled 
nursing facility.  
Sites will also record if subjects are discharged with an opioid prescription and information about 
the opioid prescription . See Section  3.1.2.2  for guidance on providing an opioid prescription at 
discharge.  
6.4. Safety Assessments  
6.4.1.  Adverse Events  
All AEs , regardless of causality or seriousness , will be recorded from the time the subject signs 
the ICF  through the Day 29 Visit . Additional safety information is provided in  Section  8. 
6.4.2.  Physical Examination s 
Scheduled physical examinations will include an evaluation of the following: head, eyes, ears, 
nose, and throat as well as CV, respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurologic al, dermatological, and 
musculoskeletal systems.  
Baseline height and weight measurements will be conducted  and BMI calculated ( Appendix  B). 
Unschedul ed physical examinations may also be performed (the extent of which is to be 
determined by the Investigator) at any time during the study if indicated by a change in the 
subject’s medical history or condition.  
Any abnormal physical examination finding deem ed clinically significant by the Investigator 
must be recorded as an AE.  
6.4.3.  Vital Signs  
Vital sign measurements will include blood pressure, resting heart rate, respiration rate, and body 
temperature. Subjects should be in a supine position (includes sitting in a recliner chair) for at 
least 5  minutes before measuring vital signs.  
Any abnormal vital sign result deem ed clinically significant by the Investigator must be recorded 
as an AE.  
6.4.4.  12-Lead Electrocardiograms  
Standard digital 12 -lead ECGs will be performed  in triplicate  during Screening . Subjects should 
be in a supine position (includes sitting in a recliner chai r) for at least 5  minutes before the initial 
ECG recording. The mean of the 3  ECG  recording s will be used as the baseline result.

Surgical w ound healing will be assessed using the Southampton Wound Scoring System  
(Appendix  I). Surgical wound healing will be evaluated by the Investi gator or other medically 
qualified clinical site personnel; every attempt should be made by the site to use the same 
assessor for individual subject assessments.  
Only an abnormal wound healing finding deemed clinically significant by the Investigator must 
be recorded as an AE and should be followed to resolution.  
6.4.6.  Clinical Laboratory Tests  
Blood and urine samples will be collected for diagnostic screening tests and for safety laboratory 
tests (hematology and serum chemistry). A list of clinical laboratory tests and parameters  is 
provided in Table  1. 
Scheduled hematology and serum chemistry tests will be performed by a central laboratory. 
Urine samples collected during the S creening period for pregnancy and drug screening will be 
tested at the study site using kits provided by the central laboratory . 
Laboratory results will be reviewed by the Investigator. Laboratory values outs ide of the normal 
reference range will be evaluated for clinical significance.  Only an abnormal laboratory value 
deemed clinically significant by the Investigator must be recorded as an AE.  Results for any 
unscheduled local laboratory tests deemed abnormal  and clinically significant must be recorded 
on an eCRF.

If signs and symptoms of suspected LAST are observed, the following assessments must be 
promptly perform ed: vital sign measurements, 12 -lead ECGs, and blood sample collection to 
measure bupivacaine plasma concentrations  (all cohorts) and alpha -1-acid glycoprotein 
concentrations (Cohort 4 only) . 
6.5. Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Blood samples for bupivacaine and meloxicam PK analysis will be collected from all subjects.  
Blood samples for  alpha -1-acid glycoprotein analysis will be collected from subjects in Cohort 4.  
Blood samples may also be used to evaluate other study drug components.  
Blood samples may be drawn using a properly maintained indwelling cannula. Samples for 
bupivacaine and meloxicam PK analysis will be sent to a bioanalytical  laboratory for analysis.  In 
Cohort 4, ex vivo protein binding of bupivacaine will be determined to support PK analysis of 
free bupivacaine. Samples for alpha -1-acid glycoprotein , which impacts the free fraction of 
bupivacaine, will be sent to a central laboratory for analysis. Detailed instructions on sample 
collection, processing, storage, and shipping procedures are provided in the Laboratory Manual.

This section lists the study procedures and assessments that will be performed at scheduled 
timepoints during the study. Information on study procedures and assessments is provided in 
Section 6. 
Unless there is a safety concern, every effort should be made to avoid protocol deviations. For 
assessments at timepoints when the subject is asleep, an attempt should be made to wake the 
subject. If there is  no response, the assessments at these timepoints may be recorded as “Not 
Done.” Assessments that can be done without waking the subject (eg, blood collection for PK) 
should be completed. Additional visits and/or assessments are permitted if clinically ind icated in 
the opinion of the Investigator.  
When the following assessments are scheduled at the same timepoint, it is recommended that 
they be performed in this order:  
• Pain intensity assessment  (VAS and NRS -R). 
• PGA of pain control assessment.  
• Vital sign  measurement s. 
• 12-lead ECG  recording  (in triplicate) . 
• Blood sample collection.  
• Physical examination.  
• Wound healing assessment.  
7.1. Screening Period ( Within 28 Days Before Surgery ) 
After providing written informed consent, potential study subjects will undergo Screening 
procedures to confirm eligibility to participate in the study. Screening procedures must be 
performed within 28  days prior to surgery. The Investigator must evaluate the subject’s medical 
history and the results of all Screening assessments to de termine study eligibility.  
Results of the following tests should be confirmed as negative prior to performing any additional 
assessments:  
• Urine drug screen  test (all subjects): A subject who fails the drug test may be 
rescreened at the discretion of the In vestigator  after discussion with the Study 
Medical Monitor . Subjects with a positive drug screen who are taking an allowed, 
prescribed medication that is known to result in a positive drug test (eg, amphetamine 
and dextroamphetamine for attention -deficit/hyperactivity disorder, benzodiazepine 
for anxiety disorder ) may be eligible for participation in the study . 
• Urine pregnancy test ( female subjects of child -bearing potential only) .

Subjects will undergo a primary unilateral TKA under bupivacaine spinal anesthesia . Sites 
should follow intraoperative safety monitoring in accordance with ASA Standards for Basic 
Anest hetic Monitoring (American Society of Anesthesiologists 2015 ). The use of drains is 
prohibited in Cohorts 2 and 3. The start and stop time of surgery and additional surgical details 
should be recorded in the eCRF.  The start time of the skin incision will be considered the start of 
surgery.  Placement of the last suture will be considered the end of surgery.  
Subjects will be administered study drug (HTX -011; all cohorts) and bupivacaine HCl (Group B  
of Cohort 3 only) unless they experience a clinically significant event during surgery 
(eg, excessive bleeding, hemodynamic instability) that would render the subject medically 
unstable or complicate  their postoperative course. Study drug and bupivacaine HCl will be 
applied  into the surgical site  prior to wound closure . More information on the administration 
technique s are provided in Section  5.1.5  and Section  5.2, respectively . 
The start and stop times of study drug dosing will be recorded in the eCRF. Details of 
administration will be recorded on a worksheet, which will be used in the dictation of the  
surgical notes and will become part of the source document. Note:  The start of study drug 
administration will be considered Time 0 for all effica cy, safety, and PK assessments.  
Concomitant medications used during surgery will be recorded (note that IV flu ids and oxygen 
are not required to be recorded unless being used to treat an AE). AEs will also be recorded.  
After immediate postoperative recovery, subjects will be transferred to the postanesthesia care 
unit.

Confidential  56 8. SAFETY MONITORING AN D REPORTING  
Investigators are responsible for the detection and documentation of AEs, SAEs, unanticipated 
problems, and pregnancies, as detailed in this protocol.  
Investigator s must review the HTX -011 Investigator’s Brochure so as to be aware of the 
safety -related events that may be anticipated with its use. Investigators will also be versed in the 
latest standard of care guidelines.  
8.1. Definition of Safety Parameters  
8.1.1.  Definition o f an Adverse Event  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in 
humans, whether or not considered drug related.  
An AE may be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), 
symptom , or disease temporally associated with the use of a study drug, whether or not 
considered causally associated with the use of the study drug. Any abnormal physical 
examination finding, laboratory value, vital sign result, ECG finding, or wound healing 
assessment finding deemed clinically significant by the Investigator must be reported as an AE. 
A clinical diagnosis, rather than a change in a laboratory analyte or other assessment, should be 
recorded (eg, anemia rather than low hemoglobin value).  
Examples of AEs include the following:  
• Significant or unexpected worsening or exacerbation of the condition or indication 
under study.  
• Exacerbation of a chronic or intermittent pre -existing condition, including either an 
increase in frequency or intensity of the co ndition (eg, abnormal physical examination 
finding).  
• Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected interaction.  
• Signs, symptoms, or clinical sequelae of a suspected overdose of the study drug or a 
concurrent medication (overdose per se should not be  reported as an AE or SAE, 
unless nonserious or serious sequelae occur).  
• The following abnormal laboratory results:  
− Any laboratory abnormality suggestive of a new disease/organ toxicity or a 
worsening of a pre -existing condition.  
− Any laboratory abnormality  that required the subject to have investigational 
product interrupted or discontinued.  
− Any laboratory abnormality that required the subject to receive specific treatment 
for the lab oratory  abnormality.  
− Any laboratory abnormality that required additional diagnostic intervention, 
and/or follow -up visits  (excluding repeat testing to confirm the abnormality) . 
Protocol No: HTX -011-306, Version 6  Heron Therapeutics, Inc.  
TKA Study of HTX -011 in an MM A Regimen  
Confidential  57 The following examples are not considered AEs:  
• Medical or surgical procedure (eg, endoscopy, appendectomy), although the condition 
that leads to the procedure is an AE.  
• Anticipated day -to-day fluctuations of pre -existing disease(s) or condition(s) 
(including laboratory values) present or detected at the start of the study that do not 
worsen.  
• The di sease or disorder being studied;  or expected progressio n, signs, or symptoms of 
the disease or disorder being studied, unless they become more severe or occur with a 
greater frequency than expected for the subject’s condition.  
• Transient paresthesia that is considered to be clinically normal (would be expected to 
occur as a long -acting local anesthetic wears off).  
8.1.2.  Definition of a Serious Adverse Event  
An AE or suspected adverse reaction is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, it results in  any of the following outcomes:  
• Death. 
• A life -threatening AE (ie, an AE that presented an immediate risk of death from the 
event as it occurred . This criterion is not intended to include an AE that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.)  
• Inpatient hospitalization o r prolongation of existing hospitalization.  
• A persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct 
normal life functions.  
• A congenital anomaly/birth defect.  
• Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -threatening, or require 
hospitalization may be considered serious when, based upon appropriate medical 
judgment, they may jeopardize the patient or subject and may require medical or 
surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this defin ition. 
Examples of such medical events include allergic bronchospasm requiring intensive 
treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or dr ug 
abuse.  
The following events do not meet the definition of an SAE:  hospitalization for elective treatment 
of a pre -existing condition that does not worsen from baseline, hospitalization for a standard 
procedure for study drug administration and routine m onitoring of the studied indication not 
associated with any deterioration in condition, social or convenience admission to a hospital, 
prolongation of a hospitalization for social or convenience reasons not associated with the 
occurrence of an AE, or hospi talization or an emergency room visit that lasts less than 24  hours  
and does not meet the criteria of an important medical or a life -threatening event . 
According to 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 812.3(s), an unanticipated adverse device 
effect means  any serious adverse effect on health or safety or any life -threatening problem or 
Protocol No: HTX -011-306, Version 6  Heron Therapeutics, Inc.  
TKA Study of HTX -011 in an MM A Regimen  
Confidential  58 death caused by, or associated with, a device, if that effect, problem, or death was not previously 
identified in nature, severity, or degree of incidence in the investigati onal plan or application 
(including a supplementary plan or application), or any other unanticipated serious problem 
associated with a device that relates to the rights, safety, or welfare of subjects . 
8.1.3.  Definition of Unanticipated Problems  
Unanticipated pro blems  are incidents, experiences, or outcomes that meet all of the following 
criteria:  
• Unexpected in terms of nature, severity, or frequency given (a) the research 
procedures that are described in the protocol -related documents, such as the research 
protoc ol and informed consent document approved by the Ethic s Committee (EC; 
includes Institutional  Review Boards [IRBs], Independent Ethics Committees [IECs], 
and Research Ethics Boards [REBs]) and (b) the characteristics of the participant 
population being stu died.  
• Related or possibly related to participation in the research (“possibly related” means 
there is a reasonable possibility that the incident, experience, or outcome may have 
been caused by the procedures involved in the research).  
• Suggest that the rese arch places subjects or others at a greater risk of harm (including 
physical, psychological, economic, or social harm) than was previously known or 
recognized.  
An unanticipated adverse device effect is defined in Section 8.1.2 . 
8.2. Classification of Adverse Events  
8.2.1.  Severity of Adverse Events  
The Investigator will assess the severity of each AE based on his/her clinical judgment using one 
of the following categories:  
• Mild: Event is easily tolerated by the subject, causes minimal discomfort, and does 
not inte rfere with everyday activities.  
• Moderate:  Event results in a low level of inconvenience or concern with the 
therapeutic measures . Moderate events may cause some  interf erence with 
functioning.  
• Severe:  Event interrupts a participant’s usual daily activity and may require systemic 
drug therapy or other treatment . Severe events are usually potentially life -threatening 
or incapacitating.  
8.2.2.  Relationship to Study Drug  
The Invest igator will assess the relationship of each AE to study drug (HTX -011) based on 
his/her clinical judgment . The Investigator’s assessment of an AE’s relationship to study drug is 
part of the documentation process, but it is not a factor in determining what is or is not reported 
in the study . If there is any doubt as to whether a clinical observation is an AE, the event should 
Protocol No: HTX -011-306, Version 6  Heron Therapeutics, Inc.  
TKA Study of HTX -011 in an MM A Regimen  
Confidential  59 be reported . The Sponsor’s assessment of relationship may differ from the Investigator’s 
assessment.  
Relationship to study drug will b e assessed according to the following guidelines:  
• Possibly related:  The AE is known to occur with the study drug, there is a reasonable 
possibility that the study drug  caused the AE, or there is a temporal relationship 
between the study drug and event . Reasonable possibility means that there is evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship between the study drug and the AE.  
• Unlikely related:  There is not a reasonable possibility that the administration of the 
study drug caused the event, there is no temporal  relationship between the study drug 
and event onset, or an alternate etiology has been established.  
Even in situations in which minimal information is available for initially reporting an SAE, it is 
important that the Investigator always make an assessmen t of causality for every event before 
entering the information into the eCRF  or completing the SAE reporting form, in the event 
electronic data capture (EDC) is not available . The causality assessment is one of the criteria 
used when determining regulatory  reporting requirements . The Investigator may change his or 
her opinion of causality in light of follow -up information and amend the SAE information 
accordingly  in the eCRF  or the SAE reporting form, as applicable.  
8.3. Time Period and Frequency for Event Assessment and Follow Up  
8.3.1.  Adverse Event and Serious Adverse Event Monitoring  
All AEs regardless of causality or seriousness will be recorded from the time the subject signs 
the ICF through the Day 29 Visit . Note: the start time of all AEs during the 72 -hour 
postoperative period must also be record ed. 
For subjects who received study drug, if an Investigator becomes aware of an SAE that occurs 
after the subject’s last study visit and the Investigator considers the event to be possibly related 
to the study drug , the Investigator needs to report the SAE to the Sponsor as described in 
Section  8.4.1 . 
8.3.2.  Follow -Up of Events  
After the occurrence of an AE or SAE, the Investigator is required to follow each subject 
proactively and provide further information on the subject’s condition . All AEs and SAEs 
documented at a previous visit or contact and designated as ongoing will be reviewed at 
subsequent visits or contac ts. 
Nonserious AEs will be followed after the last scheduled study visit until the event resolves, the 
condition stabilizes, or until the event is otherwise explained or judged by the Investigator to be 
no longer clinically significant (unless the subject is lost to follow -up or withdraws consent).  
Protocol No: HTX -011-306, Version 6  Heron Therapeutics, Inc.  
TKA Study of HTX -011 in an MM A Regimen  
Confidential  60 The Investigator will assess the outcome of each AE using the following categories:  
• Recovered/ Resolved:  The event resolved or the subject recovered without sequelae . 
An event (either serious or nonserious) occurred and had an endpoint, and the subject 
experienced no restrictions . Examples include stent placement for coronary artery 
disease (a device implanted is not a sequela), an appendectomy (a scar is not a 
sequela), a postoperative wound infection, or an  upper respiratory tract infection.  
• Recovered/ Resolved with sequelae:  The event has at least one secondary outcome 
that may result in permanent disability, functional limitation, or both . Such sequelae 
are usually limited to SAEs . Examples include hip repl acement resulting in foot drop 
(foot drop is not the intended outcome but is a risk of surgery), stroke resulting in 
paralysis, or emboli formation after a bacterial infection resulting in a renal infarct 
and loss of renal function.  
• Recovering/Resolving : The event is improving.  
• Not recovered/ Not resolved:  At the end of the study, a nonserious event either has 
not changed in intensity or may not have recovered to baseline values, and the 
outcome is unknown . Examples include headache, low -grade fever, or naus ea. 
• Unknown:  The subject has withdrawn from the study prematurely or is lost to 
follow -up, and the status of the event is unknown.  
• Fatal  
SAEs will be followed until the event resolves  (ie, when the event no longer meets any of the 
seriousness criteria) , the condition stabilizes, or the event is otherwise explained or judged by the 
Investigator to be no longer clinically significant (unless the subject is lost to follow -up or 
withdraws consent) . The Investigator will ensure that follow -up information provide d to the 
Sponsor includes results of any additional laboratory tests or investigations, histopathologic 
examinations, or consultations with other healthcare professionals that serve to clarify the nature 
of the event, the cause of the event, or both . New o r updated information will be recorded as 
outlined in Section  8.4.1 . 
8.4. Reporting Procedures  
8.4.1.  Reporting Serious Adverse Events to the Sponsor  
If the In vestigator determines that an event that occurs during the course of this study meets the 
protocol definition of an SAE due to any cause, regardless of relationship to study drug, he/she 
must notify the Sponsor by entering the SAE information into the eCRF  within 24 hours of the 
Investigator becoming aware of the SAE . 
If EDC is not available, the Investigator must complete an SAE reporting form and email it to the 
Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the SAE . The Investigator 
must a lso enter the SAE information into the eCRF as soon as possible thereafter.  
Email Address:  Heron_PV@ubc.com  
Protocol No: HTX -011-306, Version 6  Heron Therapeutics, Inc.  
TKA Study of HTX -011 in an MM A Regimen  
Confidential  61 In the initial email, the Investigator must provide to the Sponsor the following eCRF  pages, 
completed to the greatest extent possible:  
• AE record . 
• Medical history . 
• Prior and concomitant medications . 
Also, the following documents are to be forwarded:  any laboratory results, diagnostic test results, 
or medical reports relevant to the SAE.  
EDC is the primary method for notification of SAE information . In rare circumstances and in the 
absence of email capacity, notification by fax or telephone is acceptable, with a copy of the SAE 
reporting form sent by overnight mail . Initial notification via telephone does not replace the need 
for the Investigator to co mplete the SAE information in the eCRF within the time frames 
outlined.  
If the Investigator does not have all information regarding an SAE, he/she must not wait to 
receive additional information before notifying the Sponsor of the event . The SAE must be 
updated when additional information is received . Follow -up information received on all SAEs 
must be forwarded to the Sponsor using the same timelines as for an initial report.  
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor by reporting any unanticipated adverse de vice effect 
within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the effect . 
8.4.2.  Reporting Unanticipated Problems to the Sponsor  
If the Investigator determines that an event meets the protocol definition of an unanticipated 
problem,  he/she must notify the Spo nsor by completing an Unanticipated Problem Form and 
emailing it to the Sponsor within 24 hours of the Investigator becoming aware of the 
problem . 
Email Address:  Heron_PV@ubc.com  
The following information will be included with unanticipated problem reporting:  
• Protocol identifying information: protocol title, protocol number, and Investigator’s 
name.  
• A detailed description of the event, incident, experience, or outcome.  
• An explanation of the basis for determining that the event, incident, experience, or 
outcome represents an unanticipated problem . 
It is the Investigator’s responsibility to report any unanticipated problem s to the Sponsor  and 
their EC, as  required by local regulations.  
8.4.3.  Regulatory Reporting Requirements  
The Investigator must promptly report all SAEs and unanticipated adverse device effects to the 
Sponsor in accordance with the procedures detailed in Section 8.4.1 . The Sponsor has a legal 
responsibility to notify, as appropriate, both the local regulatory authority and other regulatory 
agencies about the safety of a product under clinical investigation . Prompt notification of SAEs

TKA Study of HTX -011 in an MM A Regimen  
Confidential  62 by the Investigator to the appropriate project contact for SAE receipt is essential so that serious 
suspected adverse reactions that are either unexpected or observed with increasing occurrence be 
reported and legal obligations and ethical responsibilities regarding the safet y of other subjects 
are met.  
Investigator letters are prepared according to Sponsor policy and are forwarded to the 
Investigators as necessary . An Investigator letter is prepared for any suspected adverse reaction 
that is attributable to study drug, seriou s, and unexpected . The purpose of the Investigator letter 
is to fulfill specific regulatory and GCP requirements regarding the product under investigation.  
The Investigator, or responsible person according to local requirements, must comply with 
requiremen ts related to the reporting of SAEs to the EC.  
The Sponsor is responsible for informing ECs, Investigators, and regulatory authorities of any 
finding that could adversely affect the safety of subjects or affect the conduct of the study . 
Events will be repo rted to regulatory authorities in accordance with expedited and period 
reporting requirements . 
8.4.4.  Pregnancy Reporting  
Pregnancy is not considered to be an AE; however, a ny subject who becomes pregnant during 
the study must be withdrawn from the study immediat ely. Female subjects who become pregnant 
within 28 days after receiving study drug should also notify the Investigator . The Investigator 
must attempt to follow the pregnancy to term or termination in order to report on outcome and 
health status of mother a nd child.  
The Investigator must notify the Sponsor of any pregnancy by completing a Pregnancy Form  and 
emailing it to the Sponsor  within 24 hours after the Investigator becomes aware of the 
pregnancy . 
Email Address:  Heron_PV@ubc.com  
8.5. Safety Oversight  
An internal  Product Safety and Risk Management Committee will monitor safety data on a 
periodic basis throughout the study, including regular review of AEs  (including SAEs) , 
laboratory results, and other  safety assessments . 
The criteria for suspending  the st udy are provided in in Section  13.5.

9.1. Contraception  
Female subjects of childbearing potential must use an acceptable form of contraception in the 
event of sexual activity from the Screening Visit until 30 days after study drug administration. 
Acceptable forms of contraception include double -barrier contraception or an insertable, 
injectable, transdermal, or combination PO contraceptive approved by the US FDA. Subjects 
practicing abstinence must agree to use double -barrier contraception in the event of sexual 
activity.  
Note: This does not apply to women in only a same -sex relationship or women in a monogamous 
relationship wi th a surgically sterile partner.  
9.2. Continuous Passive Motion  Machines  
Continuous passive motion machines are not required in this study; however, if they are to be 
used, they are not allowed within the first 12 hours after study drug administration.

Confidential  64 10. STATISTI CAL CONSIDERATIONS  
10.1. General Considerations  
All efficacy and safety data will be listed by subject. Unless otherwise specified, baseline is 
defined as the last observed measurement, whether scheduled or unscheduled, prior to study drug 
administration. Contin uous variables will be summarized using the number of subjects with data 
(n), mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum. Selected continuous variable summaries will 
also include the SE. Categorical variables will be summarized using frequency counts and 
perce ntages.  
10.2. Determination of Sample Size  
The sample size of 115 subjects was selected empirically without formal statistical assumptions.  
10.3. Analysis Populations  
Safety Population : All subjects who receive study drug will be included in the Safety Population. 
This population will be used for all summaries of efficacy and saf ety data.  
PK  Population : All subjects who receive at least 1 dose of study drug and have sufficient data to 
calculate PK parameters will be included in the PK Population. Any subject with a study drug 
predose concentration exceeding 5% of the C max for that individual will be excluded from the PK 
Population  for that analyte . 
10.4. Statistical Analysis Methods  
10.4.1.  Disposition and Demographics  
The number and percentage of subjects in each analysis population will be summarized. Subject 
disposition, including the number of subjects screened, dosed, completing the 72 -hour 
postoperative observation period, completing the study, and not completing the study by reason 
for withdrawal will be summarized fo r the Safety Population. Subject demographics and baseline 
characteristics will be summarized for the Safety Population and will include age, age category, 
sex, race, ethnicity, height, weight, and BMI.  
10.4.2.  Efficacy Analysis  
All efficacy data will be listed an d summarized  by cohort and treatment group . All opiate 
dosages and formulations will have the MME calculated (Opioid Morphine Equivalent 
Conversion Factors, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, May 2014). 
During the 72 -hour postoperativ e period, s ubjects who do not use a specific opioid rescue 
medication during a period of interest will have the specific opioid dose set to 0 for that period 
and w ill be characterized as “opioid -free” for that time interval.  
10.4.2.1.  Handling of Missing Data  
Due to  the required 72 -hour inpatient postoperative  observation period, the amount of missing 
data is expected to be very low. For any missing data observed through 72 hours in subjects who 
Protocol No: HTX -011-306, Version 6  Heron Therapeutics, Inc.  
TKA Study of HTX -011 in an MM A Regimen  
Confidential  65 complete the 72 -hour postoperative observation period , VAS and NRS -R scores will be imputed 
via last observation carried forward (LOCF), in which the most recent postdose value is used for 
a subsequent missing value. For subjects who do not have a postdose value prior to their first 
missing value, the median of the postdose va lues at the relevant timepoint from subjects with 
observed data will be used. Predose values will not be carried forward to postdose timepoints. In 
subjects who withdraw from the study prior to the end of 72 -hour observation period , missing 
pain intensity scores through 72 hours that were to be collected following withdrawal will be 
imputed via worst observation carried forward (WOCF), in which the worst (highest) pain 
intensity score observed prior to withdrawal will be used for postwithdrawal values throu gh 
72 hours. Analyses that adjust for the effect of opioid rescue medication will perform windowed 
worst observation carried forward (wWOCF) following LOCF/WOCF (ie, perform 
LOCF/WOCF first, then apply wWOCF). The number and percentage of missing pain inte nsity 
scores will be summarized.  
10.4.3.  Safety Analysis  
All safety data will be listed and summarized by cohort and treatment group. AEs that occur 
between the time the subject signs the ICF and the start of study drug administration will be 
considered pretreatme nt AEs. AEs that start during or after study drug administration, or AEs 
with an onset prior to study drug administration that worsen after study drug administration will 
be considered TEAEs. All TEAEs will be coded and tabulated by System O rgan Class and 
Preferred Term. The i ncidence of TEAEs , SAEs , and ORAEs  will be summarized. TEAEs 
leading to study withdrawal, if any, will be listed separately.  
Associated laboratory parameters , such as hepatic profile, renal function, and hematology values , 
will be grouped and presented together in summary tables. For each laboratory test, individual 
subject values will be listed and values outside of the standard reference range will be flagged. 
Shift tables will be produced showin g the frequency of shifts from b aseline to the lowest and to 
the highest on -study value in and out of the normal range as well as by visit. Laboratory 
parameters will also be summarized by visit.  
The change from baseline to each visit for vital sign variables will be summarized. Ab normal 
vital sign values will be flagged and listed.  
Wound healing assessment results will be summarized at each timepoint.  
10.4.4.  Pharmacokinetic Analysis  
Plasma bupivacaine and meloxicam concentrations will be determined using validated liquid 
chromatography ta ndem -mass spectrometry assays. Concentrations will be calculated by 
interpolation from a calibration curve. PK parameters for bupivacaine and meloxicam will be 
calculated using noncompartmental analysis , as appropriate. Additional exploratory analyses 
may be performed, as appropriate, to facilitate cross -study comparisons and to fully characterize 
the concentration -time profiles of each analyte  or other study drug components .  
In Coho rt 4, concentrations of alpha -1-acid glycoprotein will be summarized using  descriptive 
statistics. As an exploratory analysis, ex vivo protein binding of bupivacaine will be determined 
using equilibrium dialysis. PK parameters for free bupivacaine will be calculated using 
noncompartmental analysis, as appropriate.

12.1. Regulatory Authority Approval  
The Sponsor will obtain approval to conduct the study from the appropriate regulatory agency in 
accordance with any applicable country -specific regulatory requirements before any site may 
initiate the study in that country.  
12.2. Ethical Conduct of the Study  
This study will be conducted in compliance with the protocol and all applicabl e regulatory 
requirements in accordance with ICH/GCP and in general conformity with the most recent 
version of the Declaration of Helsinki.  
12.3. Ethics Committee Approval  
The Investigator or the Sponsor is responsible for submitting the following documents to t he ECs 
for review and, if applicable, approval: study protocol, ICF(s), I nvestigator’s Brochure , 
recruitment materials, information about study compensation to subjects, and any information for 
presentation to potenti al subjects by ECs.  
The Investigator is  responsible for providing the Sponsor with the written EC approval prior to 
commencing the study (ie, before shipment of study drug to the site) . All amendments to the 
protocol require review and approval by the EC before the changes to the study are impl emented . 
All changes to the ICF will be approved by the EC; a determination will be made regarding 
whether previously  consented participants need to be reconsented . If any other information 
previously approved by the EC for presentation to potential subjec ts is amended during the 
study, the Investigator is also responsible for ensuring EC review and reapproval.  
Study sites must adhere to all requirements stipulated by their respective ECs . This may include, 
but not be limited to, notifying the EC of serious  and unexpected AEs or other local safety 
reporting requirements, submitting a final status report, or providing a synopsis of the study 
report upon study completion.  
12.4. Informed Consent Process  
Note:  All references to “subject” in this section refer to the study subject or his/her legally 
authorized representative.  
The Sponsor (or its designee) will provide Investigators with an ICF  for this study . Investigators 
may adapt the information to suit the needs of their institution, if necessary (although it must 
reflect the required elements of informed consent specified in 21 CFR Part  50.25) . The final ICF 
must be accepted by the Sponsor and approved by the EC . Investigators must provide the 
Sponsor with an unsigned copy of the final ICF before and after it is ap proved by the EC . If any 
new information becomes available that might affect subjects’ willingness to participate in the 
study, or if any amendments to the protocol require changes to the  ICF, the Sponsor will provide 
Investigators with a revised ICF.

TKA Study of HTX -011 in an MM A Regimen  
Confidential  69 Prior to participating in any study -related procedure, each subject must sign and date an 
EC-approved ICF written in a language the subject can understand . The ICF should be as 
nontechnical as practical and understandable to the subject . The ICF must provide t he subject 
with all the information necessary to make an informed decision about their participation in the 
study, including the nature and intended purpose of the study, possible benefits, possible risks, 
disclosures of the subject’s personal and personal  health information for purposes of conducting 
the study . The ICF details the requirements of the participant and the fact that he/she is free to 
withdraw at any time without giving a reason and without prejudice to his/her further medical 
care. Before inf ormed consent is obtained, the subject should be given ample time and 
opportunity to inquire about the details of the study . All questions must be answered to the 
satisfaction of the subject.  
Once signed, the original ICF will be stored in the Investigator ’s site file and made available for 
review by the Sponsor . Documentation of the informed consent discussion must be noted in the 
subject’s case history . All subjects will receive a copy of their signed and dated ICF.  
If the ICF is revised during the study and requires the subject to be r econsented, informed 
consent will be obtained in the same manner as for the original ICF.  
12.5. Confidentiality

any unauthorized third party without prior written approval of the Sponsor . These restrictions do 
not apply to the following: 1) information that becomes publicly available through no fault of the 
Investigator or site staff, 2) information  that must be disclosed in confidence to an EC solely for 
the evaluation of the study results, 3)  information that must be disclosed in order to provide 
appropriate medical care to a study subject, or 4) study results that may be published as 
described in Section  13.6. If a written contract for the conduct of the study is executed and that 
contract includes confidentiality provisions inconsistent with  this statement , that contract’s 
confidentiality provisions shall apply rather than this statement; provided, however, that the 
confidentiality provisions in any written contract shall not be less restrictive than this statement.  
The Investigator agrees to  comply with all applicable national , state, and local laws and 
regulations relating to the privacy of subjects’ health information . The Investigator shall ensure 
that study subjects authorize the use and disclosure of protected health information in accor dance 
with the privacy regulations of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (H IPAA) 
and in a form satisfactory to the Sponsor.  
The subject’s contact information will be securely stored at each clinical site for internal use 
during the stu dy. Throughout the study, a subject’s source data will only be linked to the 
Sponsor’s clinical study database or documentation via a unique identification number . Copies of 
any subject source documents that are provided to the Sponsor must have certain pe rsonally 
identifiable information removed (ie, subject name, address, and other identifier fields not 
collected in the subject’s eCRF ). At the end of the study, all records will continue to be kept in a

13.1. Clinical Monitoring  
The Sponsor (or its designee) is responsible for ensuring the proper conduct of the study . This 
includes ensuring the subjects’ rights and well -being are protected, the conduct of the study is 
within compliance of an approved protocol and GCPs, and the integrity of the data are accurate, 
complete , and verifiable from source documentation . At regular intervals during the study, the 
Sponsor’s study monitors will contact the study site via site visits, telephone calls, emails, and 
letters in order to review study progress and the eCRF completion and to address any concerns or 
questions regarding the study conduct . During mon itoring visits, the following aspects of study 
conduct will be carefully reviewed:  subjects’ informed consent documents, subject recruitment 
procedures, subjects’ compliance with the study procedures, source -data verification, drug 
accountability, use of c oncomitant therapy by subjects, AE and SAE documentation and 
reporting, and the quality of data.  
13.2. Source Documents and Record Retention  
Each study site will maintain study documents and records as specified in ICH E6, Section 8 
(Essential Documents for the Conduct of a Clinical Trial)  and as required by regulatory and 
institutional requirements . These include, but are not limited to the following:  the study protocol, 
eCRF, delegation of authority log, pharmacy dispensing records, drug accountability logs, AE  
reports, subject source data (original or certified copies), correspondence with health authorities 
and ECs, ICFs, monitoring visit logs, laboratory certification or quality control procedures, and 
laboratory reference ranges . Access to study documents an d records will be strictly controlled 
(Section  12.5). 
Study records must be retained for at least 2 years after the last approval of a marketing 
application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing 
applications in an ICH region or until at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal 
discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product . However, these  
documents should be retained for a longer period if required by applicable regulatory 
requirements or if agreed to in the Clinical Trial Agreement . It is the responsibility of the 
Sponsor to inform the site as to when these documents no longer need to be retained.  
13.3. Management of Protocol Amendments and Deviations  
13.3.1.  Protocol Modification  
The protocol cannot be modified except in a formal protocol amendment by the Sponsor.  
13.3.2.  Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is a change, divergence, or departure from the study design or procedures 
defined in this protocol. The Investigator will notify the EC of any protocol deviations as 
required by EC guidelines and site requirements. Protocol deviations will be documented at t he 
site and in the Sponsor files. The Sponsor is responsible for notifying the regulatory authorities 
of any protocol deviations, if required.

Investigators are required to inform the Sponsor of all disclosable financial interests or 
arrangements (including those of their spouse and dependent children), prior to study initiation at 
the site, at study completion, and 1 year after study completion in accordance with 21 CFR 
Part 54. In addition, the Investigator or subinvestigators must pr omptly notify the Sponsor if 
there are any reportable changes that occur dur ing the above described period.  
Disclosable financial interests or arrangements, or the absence thereof will be recorded on the 
Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators Form . 
Any Investigator(s) added as investigational staff to the FDA 1572 form must complete the 
Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators Form at the start of his/her participation in the 
study . The Financial Disclosure for Clinical Investigators Form for any Investigator(s) leaving 
the study prior to completion will also be obtained.  
13.5. Criteria  For Suspending the Study  
If the Sponsor, Investigator, or officials from regulatory agencies discover conditions arising 
during the study that indicate that the s tudy should be halted or that a study site should be closed, 
this action may be taken after appropriate consultation between the Sponsor and Investigator(s). 
Reasons for suspending the study to assess whether terminating the study early , modifying the 
study, or closing a site  is warranted include, but are not limited to, the following:  
• A single death or 3  non-fatal SAEs that are determined by the Sponsor to be possibly 
related to study drug or any scheduled study medication for which a clear alternative 
cause is not readily apparent.  
• Discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the subjects.  
• Failure of the Investigator to comply with the protocol, GCP regulations and 
guidelines, or local requirements.  
• Insufficient adherence to protocol re quirements or an unacceptably high rate of 
missing, erroneous, or improperly collected data.  
• Insufficiently complete and/or evaluable data.  
• Inadequate recruitment of subjects by the Investigator.  
• Sponsor decision.  
If the study is terminated early by the Sp onsor, written notification documenting the reason for 
study termination will be provided to the Investigator and regulatory authorities. The Investigator 
will promptly inform the EC and provide the reason(s) for study termination.

Analysis Plan
 
Project Name:  Increasing vaccine uptake among veterans at the
 
Atlanta VA Health Care System
 
Project Code: 1803
 
Date Finalized: April 17, 2019
 
 
This document serves as a basis for distinguishing between planned (confirmatory) analysis and any
 
unplanned (exploratory) analysis that might be conducted on project data. This is crucial to ensuring that
 
results of statistical tests will be properly interpreted and reported. In order that the Analysis Plan fulfill this
 
purpose, it is essential that it be finalized and date-stamped before we begin looking at the data — ideally,
 
before we take possession of the data. Once this plan is finalized, a date is entered above, and the document
 
is posted publicly on our team website.
 
 
 
Project Description
 
The Office of Evaluation Sciences is collaborating with Emory University and the Atlanta VA
 
Health Care System to increase immunizations among veterans. The intervention targets primary
 
care providers (physicians, physician assistants and nurse practitioners) - and ultimately patients -
 
through the VA electronic health record (EHR) system. It includes a bundled vaccination reminder,
 
an immunization dashboard that relays a patient's vaccination status at a glance, and talking
 
points to assist clinicians in their dialogues with patients.
 
 
 
Data and Data Structure
 
This section describes variables that will be analyzed, as well as changes that will be made to the
 
raw data with respect to data structure and variables.
 
Our collaborators at Atlanta VA Health Care System will extract outcome data from the VA VistA
 
database (via SQL query) . The data will be at the appointment level, including all appointments
 
during a defined observation period where patients saw providers who were included in our initial
 
randomization. For each appointment the data will include at least the following:
 
 
●
Patient SID (a unique identifier, but not linkable to personal identity without VA
 
crosswalk)
 
●
Date of appointment
 
●
Provider SID, name, and title - this refers to the physician who saw the patient at this
 
appointment (not necessarily the physician to whom the patient is generally assigned for
 
primary care)
 
●
Assigned provider SID and name - this refers to the physician to whom the patient is
 
assigned for primary care (not necessary the physician who saw the patient at this
 
appointment)
 
●
Nurse SID, name, and title - this refers to the nurse who did intake at the appointment

●
Patient-aligned care team (PACT) to which the patient is assigned - this is a cluster of
 
providers, typically including one doctor and multiple nurses, who work together to
 
provide care to assigned patients
 
●
Location/clinic/PACT where the appointment took place
 
●
Patient characteristics including age, gender, rurality, and race/ethnicity
 
●
For each vaccine of interest (see below), the date when the patient last received this
 
vaccine
 
●
For each vaccine of interest, whether the patient last received it elsewhere (from a
 
provider or source outside of VA)
 
●
For each vaccine of interest, any indicators of whether the patient declined/refused the
 
vaccine
 
●
For each vaccine of interest, any indicators of whether the vaccine was contraindicated for
 
the patient
 
Note we will not receive any personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health
 
information (PHI)  as part of this collaboration.
 
Outcome Variables to Be Analyzed:
 
The vaccines of interest are:
 
●
Receipt of influenza vaccine
 
●
Receipt of pneumococcal (PCV13 or PPSV23) vaccine
 
●
Receipt of Tdap/Td vaccine
 
 
Our two primary outcomes will be defined at the patient level:
 
●
receipt of one or more of these vaccines during the observation period, conditional on the
 
patient being due for at least one of these vaccines at any appointment during the
 
observation period
 
●
receipt of the influenza vaccine during the observation period, conditional on the patient
 
being due for the influenza vaccine at any appointment during the observation period
 
We specify a separate outcome for the influenza vaccine because it is due with much greater
 
frequency than the others (most individuals are candidates for the vaccine every year) and
 
because there is reason to believe there are unique behavioral barriers to influenza vaccine
 
uptake.
 
Depending on availability of specific data elements/variables, secondary or exploratory outcomes
 
may include:
 
 
●
Should these data be available, will determine rates of hospitalizations, ER visits or disease
 
diagnoses related to flu, pneumonia, tetanus, diphtheria by treatment and control
 
conditions
 
 
●
Receipt of individual vaccines (PCV13, PPSV23, Tdap, Td)

Transformations of Variables:
 
For each vaccine, the data will include when it was last received, but will not explicitly indicate
 
whether the patient was due for the vaccine at the time of the appointment. OES will calculate
 
whether each vaccine was due at the time of the appointment based on date of last receipt as
 
recorded in the VA data and, as appropriate, other criteria such as patient age. The data will
 
contain specific flags for whether each vaccine was contraindicated for the patient, and these will
 
also be used. Finally, the data will contain flags for whether the patient reported receiving the
 
vaccine elsewhere; we will use these flags in one version of our analysis but not the other, to allow
 
for the possibility that patient reports about having received the vaccine elsewhere are not always
 
reliable and might be, for example, polite ways of declining a vaccine.
 
All algorithms used for calculating new variables from existing ones will be reviewed by VA
 
partners or checked against VA specifications to ensure they are correct and consistent with VA
 
methods (including the logic used in CPRS to determine whether each vaccine reminder should
 
appear).
 
After it is determined whether each vaccine was due at each appointment, appointments will be
 
collapsed to the patient level. The patient will be scored for whether they were due for each
 
vaccine at any appointment during the observation period, whether they were due for any of the
 
vaccines of interest at any appointment, whether they received each vaccine, and whether they
 
received any of the vaccines of interest.
 
Imported Variables:
 
To reduce spillover, we have randomly assigned providers in clusters to treatment conditions. In
 
particular, we defined 97 clusters — most of which were PACTs, but some of which were
 
combinations of PACTs that had some overlap in staffing (e.g., two PACTs for which a single nurse
 
served as Clinical Associate). Codes for these 97 clusters will be merged into the data (using
 
provider name as a matching variable). Treatment assignment will be merged in if needed, though
 
we expect this will already be available on the datafile generated by Atlanta VA.
 
 
Data Exclusion:
 
We expect it is possible that, at some appointments, a patient sees a nurse in a treatment cluster
 
and a doctor in a control cluster (or vice versa). This might happen, for example, if a nurse in one
 
cluster covers for a nurse in another cluster. We do not know if or how often this happens, but we
 
will check for it in the data. If we do find such cases of within-appointment spillover, and assuming

they are sufficiently rare, we will exclude them from analysis. (See below for exploratory analyses
 
we might conduct if such cases are more frequent than we expect.)
 
Between-appointment spillover is also possible. That is, it is possible that an individual patient will
 
have multiple appointments during the observation period with providers in different conditions.
 
Our primary approach will again be to exclude such cases, though may include other versions of
 
this analysis if such cases are more frequent than expected.
 
Treatment of Missing Data:
 
We expect no true missing values. On the vaccine receipt and other medical indicator variables,
 
missing values will be interpreted as absence of a shot or other event or condition.
 
Statistical Models & Hypothesis Tests
 
This section describes the statistical models and hypothesis tests that will make up the
 
analysis — including any follow-ups on effects in the main statistical model and any
 
exploratory analyses that can be anticipated prior to analysis.

Treatment Effects
 
We will estimate the causal effect of the treatment (more specifically, intent to treat) using a
 
difference of means calculated using an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression of a binary
 
variable coding vaccine receipt on treatment assignment, with weights to reflect unequal-sized
 
clusters. (Cluster size will be determined by the number of appointments held by each cluster of
 
providers during the observation period.) The primary question of interest is: Were the modified
 
reminders effective in increasing take-up of the vaccines of interest (and of the  influenza vaccine,
 
in particular)?
 
In our basic OLS specification, we will regress the vaccine receipt indicators on
 
 
●
an indicator variable for assignment to treatment, and

https://oes.gsa.gov
 
 
 
 
5 of 6
 
●
patient-, provider-, and appointment-level covariates as available in the data (as described
 
above).
 
The purpose of including the covariates is to enhance the precision of our estimate of treatment
 
effect by adjusting for pre-treatment differences in patient characteristics, provider
 
characteristics, or characteristics associated with the appointment. (Of course, provider and
 
appointment characteristics will have to be rolled up to the patient level in cases where the
 
patient saw had multiple appointment, potentially with multiple different providers, during the
 
observation period.)
 
In addition to the OLS specification, we will run an analogous logistic regression. We do this in
 
anticipation of publishing in outlets for which logistic regression is the norm. We will use
 
Freedman’s (2008) plug-in estimator in order to report differences in log-odds among treatment
 
conditions.
 If the OLS and logistic regressions yield substantively different results, the OLS
 
1
results will take precedence.
 
 
In our primary analysis, we will estimate cluster-corrected HC2 standard errors.
 
 
Inference Criteria, Including Any Adjustments for Multiple Comparisons:
 
 
We will use standard inference criteria.  We will use two-tailed tests and three threshold 
​
p
​
-values:
 
1%, 5%, and 10%.
 
We will not perform any adjustment for multiple comparisons when analyzing our primary
 
outcomes, since we expect the two outcomes (receipt of any shot and receipt of the influenza
 
vaccine) to be highly correlated with one another. We may apply some adjustment for multiple
 
comparisons in any exploratory analyses, depending on the form these analyses take.
 
Limitations:
 
We anticipate the following limitations.
 
●
Patients can get vaccinations (especially influenza vaccinations) from other sources, and
 
these are sometimes but not always recorded in VA’s electronic health records. This will
 
constitute unavoidable measurement error; in particular, some appointments will be
 
included as opportunities for vaccination when in fact no vaccination was needed.
 
●
Though we have tried to minimize spillover by clustering nurses and doctors in random
 
assignment, there are still some forms of spillover that might occur:
 
○
Providers could talk with one another, so those in the control condition might hear
 
something about the talking points and other aspects of the redesigned CPRS
 
reminders from providers in the treatment condition.
 
○
It is possible that nurses sometimes work across PACTs (for example, one nurse
 
filling in for another), and this could result in cases where the patient sees a nurse

in one condition and a doctor in the other. We describe above how we will handle
 
such cases.
 
 
 
Exploratory Analysis:
 
We have specified our primary analysis to exclude any appointments where a patient sees a nurse
 
in one experimental condition and a doctor in the other. We designed our randomization to
 
minimize this sort of spillover — in particular, by clustering providers who work together in PACTs
 
— but if we discover that it happens more frequently than expected, we will conduct an
 
exploratory analysis that incorporates separate predictors for nurse (treatment versus control)
 
and doctor (treatment versus control).
 
 
We may conduct exploratory analyses of possible treatment effects on receipt of the individual
 
vaccines of interest. Even if statistical power is low for these individual vaccines (which we
 
expect), we may conduct exploratory analysis using a Bayesian approach.
 
We plan to explore potential heterogeneity of treatment effects for different subgroups of
 
patients (e.g., by age, gender, race/ethnicity). We will do this by OLS regression on these
 
subgroups.

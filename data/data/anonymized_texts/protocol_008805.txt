Study Title  
Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy 2 (TACT2).  
A randomized, double -blind , controlled factorial clinical trial of edetate disodium -based 
chelation and high -dose oral vitamins and minerals to prevent recurrent cardiac events 
in diabetic patients  with a prior myocardial infarction (MI).  
Objectives  
TACT2 is being carried out to re plicate TACT , which found a reduction of recurrent 
cardiovascular events in post -MI diabetic patients  receiving edetate disodium -based 
chelation therapy.   
 
The primary obje ctive of TACT2, therefore, is to determine if the chelation -based 
strategy increases  the time to the first occurrence of any of the components of the 
TACT2 primary endpoint: all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary 
revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina compared to the placebo 
chelation strategy.  
 
The secondary objectives of TACT2 are to determine:  
  
1. if the chelation -based strategy reduces the overall rate of occurrence of the 
events which define the primary TACT2 endpoint : all-cause mortality, myocardial 
infarction, stroke, coronary revascularizatio n, or hospitalization for unstable 
angina events compared to placebo chelation strategy.  
2. if the chelation -based strategy increases the time to the first occurrence of a 
composite endpoint: cardiovascular mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, or 
stroke compared to placebo chelation strategy.  
3. if the chelation -based strategy increases the time to all -cause mortality compared 
to placebo chelation strategy.  
  
Design and Outcomes   
TACT2 is a 2x2 factorial trial testing 40  weekly edetate disodium -based che lation 
infusions and twice -daily high -dose oral multivitamins and multiminerals (OMVM) in a 
placebo -controlled design.   
 
The primary endpoint is a composite of all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
coronary revascularization, or hospitalizati on for unstable angina . All randomized 
patients  will be followed until the end of the trial.  
 
The secondary endpoints for TACT2 include the following:  
 
Total number of CV events:  This endpoint will include all CV events from 
randomization to the end of the study.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  5 All-cause mortality:  All-cause mortality is a secondary endpoint for the trial, based 
upon its importance and the observed 43% relative risk mortality reduction by chelation 
alone ( P=0.011) in the diabetic subgroup of TACT . 
 
Composite of cardiov ascular mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, or stroke:  
This composite secondary endpoint captures serious, irreversible, ischemic events. 
Chelation treatment led to a 40% relative reduction in risk ( P=0.017) in this endpoint in 
the diabetic subgrou p of TACT . 
 
Exploratory analyses, defined as those seeking to confirm a signal of benefit observed 
in TACT , or to develop mechanistic hypotheses for benefits of chelation expected in 
TACT2, include:  
i. Analysis of the primary endpoint in patients  receiving OM VM compared with oral 
placebo  
ii. Analysis of the primary endpoint in patients  receiving active chelation + active 
OMVM, compared with placebo chelation + placebo OMVM  
iii. Analysis of markers of severity of diabetes (fasting glucose, HbA1c, 
microalbuminuria) throughout the infusion regimen  
iv. Analysis of lead and cadmium levels at multiple times during the infusion regimen  
v. Collection of  biospecimen s for the constitution of a  biorepository to permit future 
analyses yet to be conceived  
Sample Size and Population  
TACT2 has enrolled 1000 diabetic patients  50 years of age or older with a prior MI and 
a serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or less.  Patients  will be randomly allocated (1:1:1:1) to 
4 factorial groups, each with approximately 250 patients . TACT2 will use a simple 
randomization scheme. The four treatment groups are:  
 
1. Active chelation + active OMVM  
2. Active chelation + placebo OMVM  
3. Placebo chelation + active OMVM  
4. Placebo chelation + placebo OMVM  
 
The study is targeting a population consisting of 40% women  and 18% minority 
subjects.  
 
  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  6 1. STUDY OBJECTIVES  
TACT2 is being carried out to replicate TACT , which found a reduction  of recurrent 
cardiovascular events in post -MI diabetic patients  receiving edetate disodium -based 
chelation therapy.   
1.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective of TACT2, therefore, is to determine if the chelation -based 
strategy increases the time to the first occurrence of any of the components of the 
TACT2 primary endpoint: all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary 
revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina compared to the placebo 
chelation strategy.  
1.2 Secondary Objectives  
The secondary objectives of TACT2 are to determine:  
  
1. if the chelation -based strategy reduces the overall rate of occur rence of the events 
which define the primary TACT2 endpoint: all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina events 
compared to placebo chelation strategy.  
2. if the chelation -based strat egy increases the time to the first occurrence of a 
combined secondary endpoint: cardiovascular mortality,  myocardial infarction, or 
stroke compared to placebo chelation strategy.  
3. if the chelation -based strategy increases the time to all -cause mortality compared to 
placebo chelation strategy.  
 
Exploratory analyses, defined as those seeking to confirm a signal of benefit observed 
in TACT , or to develop mechanistic hypotheses for benefits of chelation expected in 
TACT2, include:  
i. Analysis of the primary endp oint in patients  receiving OMVM compared with oral 
placebo  
ii. Analysis of the primary endpoint in patients  receiving active chelation + active 
OMVM, compared with placebo chelation + placebo OMVM  
iii. Analysis of markers of severity of diabetes (fasting glucose, H bA1c, 
microalbuminuria) throughout the infusion regimen  
iv. Analys es of lead and cadmium in blood and urine to:   
a. Compare the change in metal internal dose (blood lead and urine 
cadmium) in TACT2 participants, from infusion 1  to infusion 40 (or 1 year) 
in the active versus placebo infusion arms.  
b. Evaluate whether higher screening  metal internal dose (blood lead and 
urine cadmium) and the extent of depletion of those stores identify 
patients  more likely to benefit from chelation .  
v. Collection of biospecimens  for the constitution of a biorepository  to support future 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  7 mechanistic work.  Samples of blood (plasma and buffy coat) and urine will be 
stored at -80ºC in a secured biorepository to ensure their availability for the 
evaluation of future hypotheses that will be guided by the results of the trial.  
The above metal collections and biorepository will serve to support analyses to 
determine whether post -infusion urine metal measurements, alone and in comparison to 
the corresponding pre -infusion measurements, have clinical significance for predicting 
outcomes and clinical benefit of chelation; and whether the suite of additional metal 
levels measured in blood and urine by inductively coupled plasma mass multi -element 
analytic technique, some of which are not chelated by edetate disodium, have clinical 
(prognostic) significance in preliminary testing  
2. BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE  
2.1 Background on Condition, Disease, or Other Primary Study Focus  
Chelation treatment was first reported to have clinical benefits in symptomatic CAD 
patients  in 1956  and 1961 .1-2 In the early 1960s, however, following a reappraisal by 
Kitchell,3 only alternative medicine practitioners continued to use chelation for 
prevention of complications of atherosclerosis based on their positive anecdotal 
experiences.4-6 Ultimately, academic authors published 3 small studies7-9 with an 
aggregate of <300 patients  and concluded that there was no benefit from chelation for 
surrogate e ndpoints such as time to claudication or angina. Yet these studies were too 
small and of too short a duration to exclude a small or moderate effect on clinical 
endpoints.10 Despite recommendations against the practice of chelation by numerous 
professional medical associations ,11 patients  continued to seek, and some practitioners 
to administer, chelation therapy for a variety of medical conditions.5  
 
The National Institutes of Health (NIH) funded TACT  in 2002 . The design was a 2 X2 
factorial, randomly allocating patients  to intravenous edetate disodium -based chelation 
or placebo, and high -dose oral multivitamins and multiminerals or oral placebo.  
Standard chelation practice in the community also included the addition of oral 
supple ments to the intravenous treatments; hence the factorial design.12 There  were 
1708 post -MI patients  enrolled in 134 sites and 55,222 infusions administered  as part of 
TACT . 
 
In guideline -treated post -MI patients , chelation alone led to an 18% reduction in a 
combined cardiovascular endpoint ( HR 0.82 (0.69, 0.99) P=0.035, 7 -year NNT=18) .13 
Patients  with diabetes had dramatic benefit from IV chelation (HR 0.59, (0.44 , 0.79 ), 
P=0.0002, 5 -year NNT=6.5).14 An analysis of the factorial groups demonstrated that the 
strategy of intravenous chelation plus OMVM yielded a 26% reduction over double 
placebo ( HR 0.74 (0.57 , 0.95 ), P=0.016, 5 -year NNT=12).15 The effect size and the 
potential for an impact on public health and health care financing were the primary 
reasons for the Investigators’ desire to move forward with TACT2, in this case focusing 
on the patients  in whom the greatest benefit had been observed (Table 1). The 
investigators also felt that inclusion of an exploratory  mechanistic component to the 
clinical trial would be desirable. TACT2, therefore, if positive, will be a confirmatory 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  8 second trial of edetate disodium -based chelation for patients  with established coronary 
disease, and should provide  the groundwork for mechanistic hypotheses – that 
ubiquitous pro -oxidant toxic metals, especially  lead and cadmium, are associated with 
recurrent coronary events.16-20 
 
Table 1.  Summary of Results from TACT 
* Post -MI, age ≥ 50 years, creatinine ≤ 2.0; ** time -to-event. Primary endpoint:  time to death, MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, 
and hospitalization for angina ; MVM: Multivitamins & Multiminerals; NNT: number needed to treat to prevent an event.  
 
The OMVM versus placebo comparison demonstrated an 11% relative reduction in risk 
that was not statistically significant.15 Yet, as can be seen above, there appears to be a 
numerical, but not statistically significant, signal of benefit from OMVM , reducing the 
hazard ratio by about 10% each time OMVM is added to the chelation infusion. The 
TACT  vitamins included higher doses of the individual OMVM components than 
previously used in other trials, and the non -significant signal of potential benefit 
challenges current opinions on vitamin use for cardiovascular disease.  Thus, the TACT2 
protocol  replicates the 2x2 factorial design initially used in TACT .  
One of the two factors in the 2x2 factorial design – OMVM – is not incorporated in a 
primary or a secondary ob jective of the trial, and appears  only in exploratory analyses . 
The reasons for this are as follows:  
1. A factorial design w ill allow us to discern whether there is replication of the effect 
of OMVM on clinical events.  
2. If there is an effect, the complex chelation strategy with 38 components will likely 
be linked, to the benefit of intravenous chelation, and new lines of research into 
the vascular effects of ultra -high dose oral anti -oxidant mixtures given new life. 
This will apply even if the effect is numerical and qualitative, and not necessarily 
statistically significant.  Observing the same signal of benefit in 2 studies would be 
very important.  
3. The most likely result, given the weight o f prior vitamin research, is tha t there will 
be no effect of OMVM.  If this is true, then the 28 oral components can be 
unlinked from the chelation strategy.  This will improve  patient  compliance and, 
for the cardiology community, reduce barriers to acceptance and implementation.  
4. There will be no statistical cost (assuming additive treatment effects) to the 
chelation vs placebo infusion comparison, which in TACT (diabetes) had a HR of 
0.59. The proposed sample  size will provide 85% power to detect a HR of 0.70 
for the primary endpo int, and 95% power to detect a HR of 0.65, both 
conservative estimates based on TACT results. In summary, if vitamins are not 
an essential part of the effectiveness of the TACT regimen, being able to clarify Population*:  Endpoint**  Treatment comparison  Event rate  relative

TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  9 this in TACT2 will allow FDA to consider the approval of chelation alone and will 
make the treatment significantly easier to administer clinic ally. At the same time, 
if the relationships in the factorial comparisons of TACT can be reproduced in 
TACT2 for both chelation and vitamins, we will have opened up two major new 
research areas rather than just one.  
2.2 Study Rationale  
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of premature morbidity and mortality 
in the United States, including in patients with diabetes. In 2012 there were 29.1 million 
diabetic patients in the US, including 27% of people age 65 or older.21 Of these, 6.4 
million had  coronary artery disease (CAD) and could potentially be eligible for the 
therapy to be tested in this application. Despite medical research advances that have 
identified effective medical therapy to reduce coronary events in diabetes, 68% of the 
223,000 di abetic patients who died in 2012 had heart disease as either the principal or 
contributing cause.  Compared with non -Hispanic whites, the risk of diagnosed diabetes 
is 70% higher among African Americans and 80% higher among Hispanics.21 Although 
we do not f ully understand the mechanism of chelation benefit and how it possibly 
relates to risk of diabetic patients , the chelation strategy diabetic patients  had their risk 
of major adverse cardiovascular events reduced to the level of those patients  who did 
not h ave diabetes. Chelation, in other words, appeared to lower the risk of diabetes for 
cardiovascular events to the non -diabetic post -MI patient  level. This finding alone has 
potentially major public health implications. From an economic perspective, diabetes  is 
a costly disease that consumes a large proportion of the national health care budget. In 
the US, 1 in 5 health care dollars is spent treating people with diabetes. The annual 
expenditure exceeds $245 billion (B), including $176B in direct costs and $69 B in 
indirect costs (disability, work loss, premature mortality).22 TACT2, if positive, w ill likely 
have major public health and scientific impact.  
 
Possible Benefit of Chelation Therapy  
The epidemiologic evidence that many metals are toxic and promote car diovascular 
disease is robust, particularly for lead and cadmium,16-20, 23-24 metals chelated by the 
edetates .25-26 One possible hypothesis, whic h is an exploratory analysis within the 
present trial, is that edetate disodium -based chelation  depletes body stores of 
ubiquitous toxic metal pollutants, lead and cadmium in particular, acquired from the 
environment over many years and that depletion of toxicants leads to improved 
outcomes.  
 
EDTA Pharmacology  
The present trial requires  intravenous administration of the test article, edetate 
disodium.  This is supported by extensive literature demonstrating poor absorption from 
the gastrointestinal tract. Only 5 -10% of an oral dose is absorbed in the body, 91% of an 
oral dose is recoverable from the feces, and 4% is recoverable from the urine .27 In 
blood, the drug is found i n the plasma compartment. EDTA does not appear to 
penetrate cells; it is distributed primarily in the extracellular fluid with only about 5% of 
the plasma concentration found in the spinal fluid. The half - life of EDTA is 20 to 60 
minutes. EDTA is excreted  primarily by the kidneys, with about 50% excreted in one 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  10 hour and over 95% within 24 hours.27 Calcium and other chelates are excreted in the 
urine bound to the EDTA. Almost none of the compound is metabolized.  
 
The biological effects of EDTA are due to t he formation of chelates with divalent and 
trivalent metals. The stability of the metal -EDTA complex is directly related to its pH – 
the higher the pH, the more stable the chelate. Intravenous infusions of edetate 
disodium result in the chelation of ionize d calcium.28 Transient but mild reduction of 
serum calcium can be observed following the slow intravenous infusion of EDTA, and 
was observed in TACT  (below). 1gm of EDTA can effectively bind approximately 120  
mg of calcium. Among metals normally found as trace metals and metals present 
pathologically, EDTA has been demonstrated to bind and promote the excretion of 
cadmium, lead, zinc, copper, iron, manganese, and vanadium.29-30 Virtuall y all of the 
metals chelated by EDTA are excreted in the urine within 24 hours.26 In the case of 
calcium, 28% is excreted during the infusion, 60% in the 6 hours following the infusion, 
and the remainder between 6 and 12 hours  after.31 Among the essential metals 
chelated by disodium EDTA are copper and iron. Both of these metals have an 
important role in oxidative state and generally exist in an intracellular compartment or 
protein -bound. However, there is an important, non -protein boun d component that may 
be chelated by EDTA salts. EDTA salts may promote the excretion of up to 10 mg/day 
of iron and increase urinary copper by almost 140%.32 The oral supplement regimen in 
TACT2 repletes copper.  Iron was not substantially diminished by EDT A in TACT , and  
will be measured during the TACT2 infusion regimen.  
 
Preliminary data on metal excretion following a TACT2 infusion  
A preliminary study measured metal excretion after one infusion of placebo, and one of 
active chelation. Twenty  male participants (mean age 66, range 51 to 81) were recruited 
using the same criteria as in TACT  (post -MI, age >50, creatinine ≤ 2.0 mg/dL). Urinary 
concentrations of 20 toxic metals (Al, Sb, As, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Cs, Gd, Hg, Pb, Ni, Pd, Pt, 
Te, Tl, Th, Sn , W, U) normalized to creatinine excretion were measured at baseline , for 
6 hours following a placebo infusion of 500 mL normal saline and 1.2% dextrose, and 
for 6 hours following a 3 gram edetate disodium -based infusion as used in TACT . 
 
Following an ede tate 
disodium -based TACT  
infusion, there was a striking 
increase in the urinary 
excretion of lead (mean 
3,926% increase, P<0.001; 
Figure A), cadmium (739% 
increase, P<0.001; Figure B), 
and nickel (131% increase, 
P<0.001). There was also a 
modest increase i n the urinary 
excretion of tin and thallium 
(30-40%; P<0.05). These 
preliminary data25 show that 

TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  11 an edetate disodium -based infusion, identical to that used in TACT  and proposed for 
TACT2, markedly increased excretion of lead and cadmium. Whether enhanced 
excretion of metals following repeated chelation infusions leads to a reduction in blood 
lead or pre -infusion urine cadmium (reflecting total body stores of each) is unknown, but 
will be identified by TACT2.  
 
FDA safety information and labeling on edetate disodium  
Edetate disodium is an old drug for which no clear modern indication exists.  Its current 
approval, as listed on the FDA website ,33 is for medical conditions for which more 
modern, better treatments exist:  
 
“Edetate disodium is approved by the FDA for use in selected patients with high 
blood calcium levels (hypercalcemia) as well as for use among patients with heart 
rhythm problems due to intoxication with the drug, digitalis. ” 33  
 
Edetate disodium has a long safety record , which was reviewed by FDA in 2007.  
Between 1971 and 2007, a time period during which hundreds of thousands of doses of 
edetate disodium were  likely used , there were 11 deaths reported to FDA associated 
with the use of edetate disodium.  According to FDA, 7  of 11 deaths resulted from 
confusion of edetate disodium with another drug, and hence its misadministration, either 
with too high a dose or more commonly as an IV push rather than a slow infusion.  Thus, 
in a period spanning 36 years, there were 4 deaths a ssociated with edetate disodium, in 
which edetate disodium was not misu sed by being confused with a different drug . This 
is consistent with the safety data for TACT  presented below.  
 
Safety of EDTA chelation as reported in TACT  
We amassed a substantial body of safety data in TACT . EDTA was associated with few 
side effects and there were no differences in serious adverse events compared with 
placebo .13,14,34 Some of t he safety specifics are summarized below.  
 
 Calcium.  Hypocalcemia, defined as a calcium level less than 8.5 mg/dL prior to 
an infusion, was reported in 52 chelation patients (6.2%) and 30 placebo patients 
(3.5%) ( P=0.008). One patient, non -diabetic, had symptomatic hypocalcemia 
associated with muscle cramping that led to an emergency department visit. With 
regards to bone health, there were 2 fractures in the patients receiving the full 
chelation strategy and 2 fractu res in those receiving double placebo ( P=1.00). 
Although no safety signal pertaining to bone health was found in TACT , the effect 
of chelation on calcium makes it appropriate to measure calcium during the 
infusion period, as well as designate fractures as an event of interest and 
specifically query for it at regular intervals in the clinic visits and the telephone 
follow -up.  
 Kidney. An abnormal creatinine during the infusion phase was reported in fewer 
3/839 (0.4%) placebo patients than chelation 9/868 (1% ) patients ( P=0.093). 
Because EDTA is renally excreted, creatinine will be followed during the infusion 
period.  Vitamin C in high doses has been associated with oxalate kidney stones, 
and this was a rare complication in TACT . 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  12  Liver . There were no significa nt differences in liver enzyme abnormalities in the 
chelation compared with the placebo group.  Liver function will therefore not be 
monitored after the screening  study.  
 Hematology . There were no significant differences in abnormalities of 
hematologic parameters (white blood cells, hematocrit, and platelet count) in 
EDTA compared with placebo groups. Complete blood counts will be assessed 
at screening , infusion 20, and at the end of  the infusion period or 1 year.  
 Hypoglycemia . There was 1 episode of hypoglycemia reported in TACT , not 
clearly caused by the infusion.  Because diabetic patients in TACT2 may possibly 
have hypoglycemic events  due to the treatment of their diabetes , we hav e 
retained this potential adverse event in the ICF.  
 Death . There were 2 deaths attributed by the blinded Medical Monitor as 
possibly or probably due to study therapy: 1 in the edetate disodium group and 1 
in the placebo group.  This potential adverse effect  has been retained in the ICF.  
 
Safety – chelation infusions in the population with diabetes:  In the patients  with 
diabetes, chelation was as safe as in the non -diabetic population. There were 95 
serious adverse events (non –endpoint events) in the population with diabetes mellitus 
(56 chelation placebo and 39 chelation active).  
 
Safety – Oral multivitamins and mu ltiminerals:  Serious adverse events occurred in 
124 (15%) vitamin recipients and 103 (12%) placebo recipients (difference, 3 
percentage points [95%CI=0.7 to 5.7 percentage points]). Adverse events included 12 
(1.4%) incident neoplasms in the vitamin group and 11 (1.3%) in the placebo group 
(difference, 0.1 percentage point [95%CI= 0.8 to 1.3 percentage points]). No evidence 
suggested harm from vitamin therapy in any category of adverse events.  
3. STUDY DESIGN  
TACT2, like TACT , is a 2X2 double -blind, placeb o-controlled multicenter international 
(US and Canada) factorial trial testing 40 -weekly edetate disodium -based chelation 
infusions and twice daily OMVM.  On December 31, 2020, TACT2 completed enrollment.  
The study  enroll ed 1000 diabetic patients  50 years of age or older with a prior MI and a 
serum creatinine of 2.0 mg/dL or less. The factorial design was selected for TACT2 
because it replicates the TACT  design and it provides the most information about the 
independent contributions of the chelati on and OMVM factors.  Patients  will be randomly 
allocated (1:1:1:1) to 4 factorial groups:  
 
1. Active chelation + active OMVM  
2. Active chelation + placebo OMVM  
3. Placebo chelation + active OMVM  
4. Placebo chelation + placebo OMVM  
 
Patients  will be followed for clinic al events until the beginning of the analysis phase, 3 
months before the end of the 5 -year trial. During the infusion period,  patients  will have  
frequent clinical and laboratory monitoring to determine whether a clinical endpoint has 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  13 been reached, to assess study safety, and to obtain biosamples for the exploratory 
analyses of metal excretion, and to establish the biorepository.  Starting 6 mon ths after 
randomization, patient s will be followed by telephone from the DCRI Call Center.  The 
combination of e arly clinic visits and samples , combined with later telephone follow -up 
will permit the ascertainment of clinical and laboratory goals in TACT2, as listed below 
and in greater detail in Section 6.1 . 
 
The primary objective of TACT2  is to determine if the chelation -based strategy 
increases the time to the first occurrence of any of the components of the TACT2 
primary endpoint: all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary 
revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina compared to t he placebo 
chelation strategy.  
 
The secondary objectives of TACT2 are to determine:  
  
1. if the chelation -based strategy reduces the overall rate of occurrence of the 
events which define the primary TACT2 endpoint : all-cause mortality, myocardial 
infarction,  stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable 
angina events compared to placebo chelation strategy.  
2. to determine if the chelation -based strategy increases the time to the first 
occurrence of a combined secondary endpoint: cardiovasc ular mortality, recurrent 
myocardial infarction, or stroke compared to placebo chelation strategy.  
3. to determine if the chelation -based strategy increases the time to all -cause 
mortality compared to placebo chelation strategy.  
 
Additional analyses, defined as those seeking to confirm a signal of benefit observed in 
TACT , or to develop mechanistic hypotheses for benefits of chelation expected in 
TACT2, include:  
i. Analysis of the primary endpoint in patients  receiving OMVM compared w ith oral 
placebo  to determine whether the signal of OMVM benefit is reproduced  
ii. Analysis of the primary endpoint in patients  receiving active chelation + active 
OMVM, compared with placebo chelation + placebo OMVM  to determine if 
combination therapy has a greater effect size, as observed in TACT  
iii. Analysis of markers of diabetes (fasting glucose, HbA1c, microalbuminuria) 
throughout the infusion regimen  to determine whether changes in diabetes 
control or microvascular  effects may be associated with the TACT2 results  
iv. Analysis of lead and cadmium levels collected at multiple times during the 
infusion regimen to assess whether toxic metal removal is associated with the 
TACT2 results  
v. Collection of a specimen biorepository to permit future analyses yet to be 
conceived  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  14 4. SELECTION AND ENROLLMENT OF PARTICIPANTS  
4.1 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria  
All TACT2 participants must meet of the following inclusion criteria shown in Table 2.

INCLUSION CRITERIA (all must be present)  EXCLUSION CRITERIA (none may be present)  
1. Age  50 years  
2. History of diabetes, defined as medical 
record evidence or patient report of 
currently using insulin or oral 
hypoglycemic agents, or with a history 
of fasting blood glucose measurement

requires a call to the CCC for 
case review.  
 1. Baseline serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL.  
2. HbA 1C >11%.  
3. Myocardial infarction within 6 weeks of 
randomization.

skin cancer) that will limit patient survival 
over the duration of the trial.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  15  
4.2 Study Enrollment Procedures   
TACT2 will enroll a population of stable, post -MI diabetic patients . The majority of 
patients , therefore, will be approached in the outpatient area, including:  
 
i. Cardiology  practices of investigators, colleagues, or referral sources  
ii. Endocrinology practices of investigators, colleagues, or referral sources  
iii. Cardiac rehabilitation services (particularly in Canada)  
iv. Potential participants contacting clinical sites in response to IRB -approved 
advertisements  
v. Potential participants contacting clinical sites as a res ult of interviews, lectures, 
and social media  
 
Enrollment of Women and Racial and Ethnic Minorities  
The TACT2 investigators are committed to recruitment of a representative sample of 
women and minority subjects  as required by NIH , and we understand that fa ilure to do 
so will decrease the validity and generalizability of study results. TACT2 is well 
positioned to achieve its goals of enrolling subjects representative of the US population. 
We are selecting patients  for study that are age 50 or older, which ha s the corollary 
benefit of achieving a more equivalent distribution of men and women for whom 
coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death. Moreover, we anticipate 
randomizing patients  who predominantly have Type 2 diabetes (T2D). Compared w ith 
non-Hispanic whites, the risk of diagnosed diabetes is 70% higher among African 
Americans and 80% higher among Hispanics, which also has the corollary effect of 
helping us to achieve a sample that is sufficiently representative of these minority 
popula tions. TACT2 will target enrollment of at least 40% women and 18% minority 
subjects, which is in line with the demographics of prevalent myocardial infarction (MI) 
in the US population and the realities of enrolling women and minorities, as shown by 
our re view of the literature.  
 
Targeted Enrollment of Women  
We are committed to enrolling sufficient numbers of women so that the results of 
TACT2, if positive, will be plausibly applicable to women. The target proportion of 
women to be enrolled in TACT2 is lowe r than the overall proportion of women in 
estimates from the 2010 US Census (51%) ,36 but it is consistent with current estimates 
of the proportion of prevalent MI among women, especially those with diabetes. Based 
upon cardiovascular disease (CVD) surveillance from 1994 -1997 in the NHLBI 
Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) Study, one of the largest NHLBI population 
cohort studies and CVD surveillance programs, 32% (n=4,253) of 13,068 
hospitalizations for MI occurred in women.37 More recent da ta from the 2014 Heart 16. Any factor that suggests that the potential 
participant will not be a ble to adhere to the 
protocol.  
17. Women of child -bearing potential including 
those with plans for post -menopausal in vitro 
fertilization or other reproductive technology.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  16 Disease and Stroke Statistics update from the American Heart Association (AHA) 
reported a similar proportion of prevalent MI in women (34%).38-39 Gore et al.,40 based 
on the National Registry of Myocardial Infarction (NRMI), reported  that 44.8% of incident 
MIs in diabetics occurred in women, with an 8.4% in -hospital mortality that was slightly 
higher than that of men.  Perhaps more to the point of the attainable, the FREEDOM 
Trial41 reported its results in 2012.  This was an NIH study o f revascularization strategies 
in diabetic patients  with multivessel coronary disease. There were 1900 patients  
enrolled, and 29% were women (Similar to ARIC, above).  The TACT2 leadership has 
carefully considered the population goal as reported by Gore, an d the attainable goal 
from FREEDOM.  While we believe we can improve on FREEDOM, we do not 
realistically believe we can enroll a population fully reflective of Gore et al.  Thus, our 
goal of enrolling at least 40% women in the TACT2 trial is justified.37-41 
 
Targeted Enrollment of Minorities  
Our goal for enrollment of minorities is more reflective of the Gore data, which reported 
18.2% minorities in the NRMI diabetes dataset.  This proportion included 9% black and 
3.4% Hispanics. Overall, the TACT2 enrollment target of 18% for minority patients  is 
justified based on these data and is in accord with published data on the proportion of 
minority patients  with prevalent MI used by the AHA, ACC -NCDR and VAMC.37-43  
 
Additional Strategies to Enroll and Retain Women and Minorities  
Current informal surveys of patients  undergoing chelation have already led to 
suggestions for sites to consider infusions of multiple patients  simultaneously in a 
socially compatible group setting, to consider gender -based infusion groups, p articularly 
for women patients , and to consider extended hours or weekend infusions.  
 
Strategies will be added or modified throughout the study, as formal surveys of patients  
are performed, and sites apply or discard different approaches.  These plans will form 
part of a living document external to this Protocol, entitled “Plans to Identify, Recruit, 
Enroll, and Retain Women & Minorities.”   
5. STUDY INTERVENTIONS  
5.1 Interventions, Administration, and Duration   
Chelation/placebo infusions:  The active infusi on contain s up to 3 g of Na 2EDTA 
adjusted based on eGFR, 2 g of magnesium chloride, 100 mg of procaine HCL, 2500 U 
of heparin, 7 g of ascorbate, 2 mEq KCl, 840 mg sodium bicarbonate, 250 mg 
pantothenic acid, 100 mg of thiamine, 100 mg of pyridoxine, and sterile water to 
complete 500 mL.  Placebo infusions consist  of 500 ml normal saline with 1.2% 
dextrose. Infusions are administered weekly for 40 weeks.12 More detail s can be found  
in the Manual of Procedures  (MOP ). 
The dose of edetate disodium in the infusion solution will be adjusted based o nf 
estimated creatinine clearance and ideal body weight (IBW), but in no case will ever 
exceed 3 grams per infusion (3000mg):  
EDTA dose (mg)  = [50mg x (IBW x 1.33) x min (100, creatinine clearance)]  ÷100  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  17  
The IBW is calculated based on the Devine formula:44 
 For men the weight is computed as 50 kg plus 2.3 kg for each inch of height 
over 5 feet (or 60 inches).  
 For women the weight is computed as 45.5 kg plus 2.3 kg for each inch of 
height over 5 feet (or 60 inch es). 
 Actual body weight is used whenever it is less than computed ideal body 
weight.  
 
Correction for creatinine clearance should only be done if creatinine clearance is 
less than 100.   
 
Creatinine clearance will be computed by using a modified version of t he Cockcroft -Gault 
equation:  
 
Creatinine Clearance (ml/min) =     (140 - age) x (IBW X 1.33)     
(72 x Cr)  
 
Creatinine Clearance = computed renal glomerular filtration rate in ml/min  
Age = patient ’s age  
IBW = computed weight in Kg  
Cr = serum creatinine in  mg/dL  
For women, multiply the above result by 0.85  
EDTA dose is automatically adjusted by the electronic data capture system based on 
the most recently calculated creatinine clearance value. If a prescription change for 
EDTA is required, the pharmacy is automatically notified by the electronic data capture 
system. The pharmacy will adjust the EDTA for the patient ’s next scheduled infusion.  
 
Serum calcium is corrected by albumin level to generate a corrected calcium value that 
is an estimation of ionized calcium45 as follows:  
 
corrected calcium = serum calcium + (0.8 x [normal serum albumin - patient ’s 
albumin])  
 
calcium= mg/dL  
albumin= g/dL  
 
 When corrected calcium is greater than 8.5 mg/100mL, the infusion is 
administered over 3 hours.  
 When corrected calcium is between 8 and 8.5, the infusion is administered over 4 
hours.  
 When corrected calcium is less than 8, the next infusion is not administered and 
serum calcium is rechecked at least 1 week later.  When corrected calcium is 
within acc eptable range, infusions continue. This usually leads to a 2 week delay 
in infusions.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  18  
OMVM/placebo : The OMVM consists of 3 caplets, twice daily for a total intake of 
vitamin A 25000 IU, vitamin C 1200 mg, vitamin D3 100 IU, vitamin E 400 IU, vitamin 
K1 60  μg, thiamin 100 mg, niacin 200 mg, vitamin B6 50 mg, folate 800 μg, vitamin B12 
100 μg, biotin 300 μg, pantothenic acid 400 mg, calcium 500 mg, iodine 150 μg, 
magnesium 500 mg, zinc 20 mg, selenium 200 μg, copper 2 mg, manganese 20 mg, 
chromium 200 μg, mo lybdenum 150 μg, potassium 99 mg, choline 150 mg, inositol 50 
mg, para -aminobenzoic acid 50 mg, boron 2 mg, vanadium 3 5 μg, citrus bioflavonoids 
100 mg12. Placebo caplets consist of microcrystalline cellulose, stearic acid, 
croscarmellose sodium, silica  and magnesium stearate.  OPADRY® II complete film 
white coating, magnesium stearate and vanilla flavor  are used to coat both active and 
placebo pills . These caplets are  taken for the entire duration of the study.  
 
Low-dose vitamins : The low -dose supplement s are taken by all patients  to prevent 
any deficiency syndromes from chelation of essential minerals or vitamins.  They 
consist of: vitamin B6, chromium, copper, manganese, and zinc. As was done in TACT , 
all patients  will receive a low -dose regimen consisti ng of a single pill to be taken during 
the infusion regimen, stopping at 1 year  at the  latest.  The low -dose regimen consists 
of: vitamin B6 25 mg, zinc 25 mg, copper 2 mg, manganese 15 mg, and chromium 50 
μg. 
5.2 Handling of Study Interventions   
Infusion Encounter  
The clinical unit will administer infusions.  Infusions will be received in a refrigerated 
individual overnight mailer that will contain an IV bag and 2 syringes, each labeled for 
the individual patient . Typically, the infusion kit is received the  day before the infusion is 
scheduled, and is good for 72 hours if unmixed.  Once mixed, the refrigerated infusion 
will be good for 24 hours only.  The specifics will be covered in detail in the MOP . 
 
Each infusion encounter will be preceded by a brief interval history with specific 
emphasis on cardiac symptoms and clinical events, including hospitalizations . Vital 
signs will be measured before and after the infusion prior to discharge from the infusion 
site. A brief cardiopulmonary exam will be recorded  at screening  and at the end of each  
infusion . If there is weight gain of 3 lbs or more since the last infusion, or 5 lbs or more 
since the screening  evaluation, the patient  will be evaluated for heart failure. A trained 
study coordinator or infusion nurse  may perform this examination.  If there is heart 
failure, the infusion will be delayed until the patient  is treated. Symptoms occurring 
during the infusions will be elicited and recorded on the eCRF. Patients  will take their 
diabetes medications as schedul ed unless a blood draw is scheduled. In that case, 
patients  will arrive after an overnight fast and the diabetes medications will be held until 
the morning blood draw prior to the beginning of the infusion. Patients  may consume 
food and drink during the in fusion .  
 
Infusion Schedule  
Infusions will be administered on a weekly basis for 40 weeks through a peripheral 
intravenous line over at least 3 hours.  Due to vacations, travels, weather, and illness, 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  19 the infusion regimen can be extended but is expected to  be completed by 1 year.  
Clinical sites, however, will be instructed that if a patient  has not completed the 
infusions by 1 year, they should continue  trying to get the patient  to clinic until the 40th 
infusion is complete.  The total number of infusions is  key, not the weekly schedule on 1 -
year completion.  The overall goal of the treatment schedule is to deliver all 40 
infusions; no matter how long it takes.  The DCRI Call Center will follow patients  for 
clinical events, but not for  infusion scheduling or other site-centered events beginning 6 
and 12 months  after randomization , and at 4 month intervals subsequently until the 
study ends.   
 
Distribution of Vitamins  
The TACT2 Central Pharmacy will be responsible for distributing the vitamins every  four 
months  to the individual patients . The study vitamins will be mailed directly to the 
subject’s home.  In order to better preserve the blind and improve vitamin compliance , 
the study vitamin s will be packaged in one month bottles and in individual  dose packs . 
Vitamin compliance will be estimated  by the site personnel and the DCRI Call Center at 
specific intervals and  entered  into the Electronic Data Capture ( EDC ) system . The 
details will be covered in the MOP . 
 
Managing Patient  Safety During the Infusion Encoun ter 
Blood samples for safety will be collected during infusion visits as seen in the schedule 
below.  
 
Hypoglycemia  – Among 839 chelation -treated patients  in TACT  receiving 27,382 
infusions, there was 1 episode of hypoglycemia. However, given that all patients  in 
TACT2 have diabetes, all sites will be instructed in how to suspect , diagnose, and treat 
hypoglycemia.  Patients with diabetes are more likely to have hypo and hyperglycemia 
based on the nature of their disease and its treatment.  There is no exp ectation that 
patients with diabetes are prone to hypoglycemia from active or placebo treatment.  
 
Some pa tients using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) may have incorrect readings  
due to the contents of the active/placebo infusion . This could result in either not giving 
insulin when it is needed or giving too much insulin. To avoid insulin -dosing errors due an 
incorrect CGM reading, patient s will be directed do the following:  
 
 Do not depend on the results of CGMs  for insulin dosing  while receiving an infusion 
and for up to 12 hours post infusion; finger  stick measurements are recommended in 
that timeframe.  
 
 Users of a closed loop insulin pump system should set the pump to manual mode for 
24 hours starting at the time of the infusion , and use finger  stick measurements in 
that timeframe . 
 
Hypocalcemia  – All sites will have training in how to recognize symptoms of 
hypocalcemia, and additionally have available calcium chloride or calcium gluconate for 
intravenous administration. Should hypocalcemia be suspected during an infusion,  the 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  20 infusion will be stopped, and the patient  will have blood drawn and be treated. The CCC 
should be called for a joint evaluat ion (with the site coordinator and site PI or designee)  
of the symptoms and result  of the serum calcium drawn during the event before 
scheduling the next infusion. Symptomatic hypocalcemia requiring an ER visit was 
observed only once in TACT .  
 
Fluid overload  – Patients  are excluded from TACT2 if they are thought likely to be 
intolerant  to 500 mL fluid infusions weekly or had a heart failure hospitalization within 
the past 6 months.  
 
When a patient gains more than 5 lbs from their screening weight or more than 3 lbs 
from their last visit , the site investigator or designee should evaluate the patient  for heart 
failure. If, in the opinion of the site investigator  or designee , the patient  has heart failure, 
the infusion will not be started and the patient  will be treated or referred for treatment. 
Heart failure throughout the trial w ill be considered an event of special interest and 
carefully tracked and compared between groups.  
 
Recommended Safety Materials  
Clinical Sites should ensure the following safety materials are available during 
administration of infusions:  
 
 Snacks or juice for empiric treatment of hypoglycemia  
 Intravenous dextrose 50%  
 Intravenous calcium gluconate or chloride  
 Glucometer for measuring glucose levels  
5.3 Concomitant Interventions   
TACT2 will be conducted at a variety of clinical sites and there may be a range  of 
medical therapies employed for secondary prevention.  Specific medications for post -MI 
and diabetes will be recorded, as will injectable bisphosphonates for osteoporosis . 
TACT 2 encourage s the use of the latest, evidence -based care for diabetes and post -MI 
secondary prevention . To this end, the prevalent guidelines will be summarized in study 
material and made available to the sites. Patients  will be encouraged to have an 
endocrinologist involved in their diabetes care. The Diabetes Science Consultant wil l 
evaluate summary data on HbA1c. The CCC will evaluate post -MI guideline compliance  
based on reports produced by the DCC . Sites will receive a quarterly report regarding 
the proportion of patients  receiving guideline -based post -MI care, and HbA1c.  Those 
placing in the lowest quartile will be notified by the CCC, and assisted in improving their 
compliance with evidence -based post -MI treatment  and diabetes treatment .  
5.3.1  Optimal Concomitant Interventions  
All post -MI evidence -based medications, specifically anti -platelets, statins, beta -
blockers, ACE inhibitors or ARBs, and aldosterone blockers are encouraged , if indicated 
based on clinical need as assessed by the patient ’s physician . All necessary 
cardiovascular procedures are allowed.  All conve ntional diabetes management is 
permitted  with a focus on optimal glucose control while avoiding episodes of 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  21 hypoglycemia.  Recommended medical treatment for secondary cardiovascular 
prevention and diabetes management will form part of a living document outs ide the 
study protocol, that will be updated annually  (Suggested Management of TACT2 
Patients ) and circulated to sites.  
 
5.3.2 Prohibited Interventions  Following randomization  
i. Effective , FDA -approved,  oral chelation at any time during  the course of the trial.  
ii. Intravenous chelation , outside of the TACT2 intervention , at any time during the 
course of the trial.   
iii. Over -the-counter vitamins having any of the same components as do the TACT2 
vitamins . In patients who are unwilling to discontinue outpatient vitamins, or 
whose participation in the infusion regimen is dependent on their continuing to 
take out of protocol oral vitamins, the CCC may grant a waiver based on 
discussion with site staff.  
iv. Injecta ble vitamins such as the  Myers’ cocktail unless medically necessary (i.e. 
pernicious anemia).  In patients whose participation in the infusion regimen is 
dependent upon their permission to receive a Myers’ cocktail no more than once 
monthly, the CCC may gra nt a waiver based on discussion  with site staff.  
 
Exception:  Vitamin D 3 prescribed f or bone health , along with calcium , may be taken and 
will be recorded in the eCRF.  
5.4 Adherence Assessment  
Assessing infusion adherence : the site coordinators will enter in the eCRF if the infusion 
was completed.  In cases where the infusion was started and not completed, the site 
coordinator will estimate whether more or less than ½ of the infusion was infused.  
 
Assessing OMVM adherence : During the study , OMVM will be delivered every 4 months 
in bottles .  Each dose pack will have 6 OMVM/placebo pills inside. Each bottle  will have 
30 dose packs.  At designated  intervals during the study , the patient ’s compliance will be 
assessed.   
 
Assessing low -dose vitami n adherence : The low -dose regimen is to be taken during the 
infusion phase only . The subjects  should take one  low-dose  pill daily.  When patients  are 
non-compliant with this regimen they will be advised by site staff regarding its 
importance .

TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  23  
6.1.2  Laboratory Procedures  
The TACT2 laboratory procedures include safety monitoring, diabetes monitoring labs, 
and additional  labs (metals and biorepository). Abnormalities in the safety lab  results 
collected will be comp iled and reported to the DSMB. Biosample processing, analysis , 
storage, and data management details are covered in the separate MOP for each 
laboratory.  
 
In brief, there are 2 types of blood and urine specimens that will be sent for analysis:  
 
1. Safety labs will be sent to study central laboratory . 
2. Blood and urine for metals analyses and for preparation and storage will be 
sent to the TACT2 Biorepository. The Biorepository will be responsible for 
processing and storage of samples during the study and intermittent batch 
transfer of urine and blood samples  to the anal ysis laboratory .  
 
Safety Laboratory collection at the Clinical Site  
Blood and urine samples will be colle cted at screening, infusion 5, 10, 20, 30 and 40.  
See Schedule of Evaluations in Section 6.1 for specific laboratory tests.  The study 
central laborato ry will provide the supplies for collection and packaging for pick -up. This 
is explained in greater detail in the MOP . 
 
Biorepository blood and urine  sample collection  at the Clinical Site  
Blood and urine  samp les will be collected at infusion 1, 5, 20 and 40 to measure metal 
levels and for long term storage . The biorepository will ship the collection kits to the 
clinical sites. This is explained in greater detail in the MOP . 
6.2 Description of Evaluations   
6.2.1  Screening Evaluation  
Consenting Procedure  
Patients  agreeing to participate will be asked to provide informed consent , medical 
record release form, and the pharmacy agent designation  form which permits the 
pharmacy to ship the study infusion to sites rather than to the patient.  Patients will also 
agree to follow -up by the DCRI Call Center beginning six months after randomization.  If 
a site closes prior to study end, the randomized subjects will be asked to re -consent 
using an addendum for DCRI Call Center continuation of follow -up calls.  Study 
personnel obtaining consent are specifically trained to explain the study, answer 
questions and ascertain that the patient  understands the key elements of the research .  
 
The original informed consent , pharmacy agent designation  and medical release forms 
will be maintained as a hardcopy  at the site in the study file.  Copies of the signed forms 
will be given to the patient , and a scanned  copy of the informed consent and medical 
release form will be emailed or faxed to the DCRI Call Center . The pharmacy agent 
designation form will be emailed to the central pharmacy.  The site will document the 
version and date of the signed consent in the eCRF . 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  24 Screening  assessment, enrollment, and randomization  
Screening  Visit  
After providing informed  consent,  the site will enter the patient  in the EDC system where 
a unique identifier will be assigned.  The patient  will have the medical history reviewed 
by study staff, and blood and urine sample s will be drawn.  Eligibility will be based on the 
following : 
 All inclusion criteria are met  
 No exclusion criterion is present   
Data collected will include relevant cardiac history, particularly of the qualifying MI 
(anterior or non -anterior), whether patients  have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, 
complications of diabetes, and treatment of diabetes. Sites are encouraged to discuss 
any questions about qualifying criteria with the CCC.  Medication data will include post -
MI evidence -based medications and treatments for diabetes. Laboratory test results will 
be enter ed to characterize the patient  population, in particular with regards to diabetes 
control, renal function, and safety parameters to be followed during follow -up.  
Randomization and scheduling first infusion  
A simple randomization scheme reflecting an equal  allocation ratio to the four different 
treatment groups (1 active chelation / active OMVM: 1 active chelation / placebo 
OMVM: 1 placebo chelation / active OMVM: 1 placebo chelation / placebo OMVM) will 
maximize the power for detecting treatment difference s at the time of the interim and 
final analyses . 
 
Patients who are confirmed eligible to participate in TACT2 will be notified  by the site 
study personnel . The patient  will be randomly assigned to a blinded treatment group by 
the EDC system (this is the randomization  date),  and the first infusion visit will be 
scheduled . The allowable range of time during which all screening activity  (defined by 
date of consent)  must be completed is 30 days . After 30 days, if randomization has not 
taken place, screening labs must be re -drawn.  The first infusion, should occur within 2 
weeks of randomization.   
6.2.2  First infusion visit  
This visit will involve collection  of urine and blood for metals and biorepository . The 
biorepository will provide specific labels identifying patient  number, infusion number, 
sample type, including kits with metal -free urine and metal -free blood collection 
containers. More  detail about blood and urine collection and shipping will be found in 
the MOP . 
6.2.3 Subsequent Infusion  Visits  (2-40) 
The detailed schedule and activities of the follow -up visits are covered in Section 6.1 
(Table 2).  Within the infusion period in Year 1, most visits are associated with an 
infusion number, and do not have a traditional time -window for performance.   
 
 
 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  25 During the infusion year, the only time -dependent visit landmarks in TACT2 are:  
 
1. The first infusion, which should occur within 2 weeks of randomization.  
2. In non -adherent patients who have stopped receiving infusi ons, safety labs will 
not be checked.  However, the study site will make all possible efforts to bring 
these patients in for blood and urine metal  collection  as well as scheduled fasting 
glucose, HbA1c, and microalbumin.  During these specimen visits, patients will 
also complete a clinical visit including history, and a brief exam.  Subjects no 
longer receiving infusions are expected to return at week 5, 20, and 40 post -
randomization for these visits . For patients who have stopped receiving infusions, 
a urine / blood sample within 4 months of the last infusion is informative 
regarding their metal levels at the time the patient stopped infusions. The CCC 
should be consulted for all non -adherent patients. The management of the non -
adherent patient will be c overed in detail in the MOP . 
 
The data collected in each call is covere d in the Table in Section 6.1.  
 
6.2.4 Blinding  
Blinding  
The shipped and refrigerated infusion pack age will contain an ascorbic acid syringe (or 
ascorbic acid placebo if the patient  is assigned to the placebo arm), one syringe with 
EDTA (or EDTA placebo if the patient  is assigned to the placebo arm), and a bag for 
intravenous infusion with all the other components mixed (or a bag containing only 
normal saline if the patient  is assign ed to the placebo arm).  EDTA in solution is clear 
and of a viscosity indistinguishable by clinical staff from that of water.  Thus, the 
placebo -EDTA syringe will contain normal saline. The ascorbic acid solution is generally 
a pale yellow color, which, upon  mixing (14  ml of ascorbic acid solution in 500  ml) 
becomes indistinguishable from the clear saline placebo solution.  In addition, ascorbic 
acid, in the concentration provided by the manufacturer, is viscous and provides 
resistance to transfer into the inf usion bag through a 21 -gauge needle.  A colored but 
translucent syringe will mask the color of the active ascorbate  syringe. Regarding 
blinding procedures for the vitamin and mineral supplements, placebo and active 
treatment groups will take identical -appea ring pills and capsules.  The above blinding 
was proven successful in TACT . 
Procedure for Unmasking  
Unblinding is rarely justified or necessary.  If the clinical site wishes to unmask for an 
adverse event, however, the clinical site will contact the CCC PI to discuss the clinical 
details of the case. Following these discussions, if the participant’s physician still 
desires unmasking, the CCC PI will contact the DCC Co-PI to request unmasking . The 
treatment assignment  will be made available to the treating physician.  The CCC PI will 
remain blinded, and a request will be made to the treating physician to maintain the 
patient  blind. These requests will be submitted and handled on a case -by-case basis , 
but will be entered  into the eCRF.  
  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  26 Resource Utilization Assessments  
Health care resource use will be collected on the clinical trial eCRF covering the period 
from the first infusion through end of follow -up. For all hospitalizations, length of stay by 
intensity of care (e.g., number of step down, intensive care nights) will be recorded 
along with major procedures. Discharge disposition for each acute care stay (e.g., 
home, skilled nursing, rehabilitation, nursing home, death) will be documented. In 
addition, dates of car e at non -acute care facilities (e.g., skilled nursing, rehabilitation, 
long-term care) will also be collected to the end of the study follow -up. The dates of 
significant out patient  diagnostic and therapeutic procedures will be recorded.  
 
6.2.5 Completion/ Final Evaluation  
All of these assessments will be discussed in detail in site training and will be an 
important part of the MOP . 
7. SAFETY ASSESSMENTS  
Institutional Review Boards (IRB s) 
All TACT2 sites will submit the study protocol, informed consent form, and other study 
documents to their corresponding IRB for approval. Any amendments to the protocol, 
other than minor administrative changes, must be approved by the TACT2 DSMB and 
each I RB before they are implemented.   
7.1 Specification of Safety Parameters  
TACT  amassed a substantial body of safety data. Edetate disodium was associated 
with few side effects and there were no differences in serious adverse events compared 
with placebo .13,14,34 The safety specifics are summarized below.  
 
 Calcium . Hypocalcemia, defined as a calcium level less than 8.5 mg/dL prior to 
an infusion, was reported in 52 chelation patients (6.2%) and 30 placebo patients 
(3.5%) ( P=0.008). One patient, non -diabetic , had symptomatic hypocalcemia 
associated with muscle cramping that led to an emergency department visit. With 
regards to bone health, there were 2 fractures in the patients receiving the full 
chelation strategy and 2 fractures in those receiving double pl acebo ( P=1.00). 
Although no safety signal pertaining to bone health was found in TACT , the effect 
of chelation on calcium makes it appropriate to measure calcium during the 
infusion period, as well as designate fractures as an event of interest and 
specifi cally query for it at regular intervals in the clinic visits and the telephone 
follow -up in TACT2.  
 Kidney . An abnormal creatinine during the infusion phase was reported in 3/839 
(0.4%)  chelation  patients and 9/868 (1%) placebo patients ( P=0.093). Because 
EDTA is renally excreted, creatinine will be followed during the infusion period.  
 Liver . There were no differences in liver enzyme abnormalities in the chelation 
compared with the placebo group.  Liver function will therefore not be monitored 
after the screening  study.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  27  Hematology . There were no significant differences in abnormalities of 
hematologic parameters (white blood cells, hematocrit, and platelet count) in 
EDTA compared with placebo groups. Complete blood counts will be assessed 
at screening , infusio n 20, and at infusion 40 or 1 year , whichever is earlier .  
 
Safety in the projected TACT2 population of post -MI diabetic patients : In the 
patients  with diabetes, chelation was as safe as in the non -diabetic population. There 
were 95 serious adverse events (non–endpoint events) in the population with diabetes 
mellitus (56 chelation placebo and 39 chelation active).  
 
Safety – Oral multivitamins and multiminerals:  Serious adverse events occurred in 
124 (15%) vitamin recipients and 103 (12%) placebo recipients (difference, 3 
percentage points [95%CI=0.7 to 5.7 percentage points]). Adverse events included 12 
(1.4%) incident neoplasms in the vitamin group and 11 (1.3%)  in the placebo group 
(difference, 0.1 percentage point [95%CI=0.8 to 1.3 percentage points]). No evidence 
suggested harm from vitamin therapy in any category of adverse events.  
 
Routine safety labs : Study staff will review all laboratory values, includin g safety labs 
and diabetes monitoring labs.  Patients  and their physicians will be informed when 
laboratory values are abnormal if, in the judgment of the research team, a change in 
medical therapy is warranted, or the abnormal laboratory value has diagnost ic value of 
clinical importance.  These procedures are  covered in detail in the MOP . 
7.2 Methods and Timing for Assessing, Recording, and Analyzing Safety 
Parameters  
Safety Labs and the TACT2 infusion regimen . 
The timing of safety labs is covered in section  6.1 (Schedule of  Evaluation s) 
 
Renal function.  Edetate disodium is excreted by the kidneys , and the dose of edetate 
disodium administered  is adjusted  based on estimated creatinine clearance .46 There 
was no difference in renal function between groups at the end  of 30 infusions in TACT . 
In TACT2, each assessment of serum creatinine will potentially lead to a change in total 
edetate disodium dose f or the next series of infusions, with the following 2 “trigger 
points .” 
 
1. If estimated creatinine clearance is r educed by 25% or more  compared with 
baseline, there will be a “lab delay” transmitted to the site and to the CCC and 
DCC.  The site will be contacted and asked to review wh ether there have been 
medication or over -the-counter supplement changes as well as  changes in 
clinical status that might account for a reduction in renal function, and the lab will 
be repeated.  The dose of edetate disodium will be recalculated before re -
administration.  This will be entered in the EDC system.  
2. If cre atinine doubles or exceeds 2.5 mg/dL, whichever is lower, the site will be 
contacted and asked to review whether there have been medication or over -the-
counter supplement changes as well as changes in clinical status that might 
account for a reduction in r enal function, and the lab will be repeated. Infusions 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  28 will be resumed when  creatinine is <2.0 mg/dL  and the edetate disodium dose 
recalculated at that time . This will be entered in the EDC system.  
 
Calcium levels.  Edetate disodium chelates ionized calcium  and can lead to 
hypocalcemia.  In TACT , however, there was only one  episode of symptomatic 
hypocalcemia leading to an Emergency Room visit.  Calcium levels will be monitored, 
and if corrected calcium is between 8.0 mg/dL and 8.5 mg/dL, infusions will be 
administered over 4 hours, instead of 3 hours.  If corrected calcium is below 8.0 mg/dL, 
there will be a lab delay, and infusions will be held until calcium is 8.0 mg/dL or higher, 
based on bi-weekly blood draws.  This information will be entered in the EDC system.  
 
Metals labs  
The handling of the trace metals analyses and biorepository will be available in the 
MOP for each of these study units.  If the lead or cadmium levels measured by the Trace 
Metals Laboratory are outside the upper boundaries for American  Conference of 
Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH)47 (after a repeated measurement at the 
Trace Metals Laboratory) the clinical site and the CCC will be notified . In most cases, 
this will require repeating the levels in a commercial lab.  If levels a re still high, the 
participant will be recommended to contact their local public health department who will 
follow standard procedures for the evaluation of metal exposures. Because removal 
from exposure is the primary treatment, this should not interrupt the TACT2 infusions.  
The study sample is unlikely to have any such values.  
 
Clinical Assessments  
In TACT , the principal concern  that emerged related to the weekly infusions of 500 ml of 
fluid and the potential precipitation of heart failure (HF).  Patients  are not eligible for 
TACT2 if they have had a hospitalization for heart failure in the 6 months preceding 
initial eligibility assessment.  Nonetheless, like in TACT , in order to reduce ongoing 
patient  risk, weight will be monitored at each infusion.  If the re is weight gain of 3 lbs or 
more since the last infusion, or 5 lbs or more since the screening evaluation, the patient  
will be evaluated for heart failure. A trained study  coordinator or infusion nurse may 
perform this examination.  If there is HF present, this will be entered into the EDC, the 
infusion delayed for 1 week, and a suitable treatment regimen developed with the 
patient ’s clinical physician.  
 
7.3 Adverse Events  and Serious Adverse Events  
Adverse Event (AE)  
An adverse even t is any undesired, noxious or pathological change in a patient  as 
indicated by signs, symptoms, or laboratory changes that occur in association with the 
use of trial intervention/medication, whether or not considered drug or biologic related.  
This definition includes intercurrent illness or injuries, exacerbation of existing 
conditions, psychological events, psychosocial events, associated temporally 
associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product or study intervention. Pre-existing 
conditi ons, which worsen during a study, are considered adverse events and can 
become serious if they fulfil one of the seriousness criteria described below.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  29  
Note: Diseases, signs, symptoms, and/or laboratory abnormalities already existing at 
study admission ar e not considered adverse events when observed during the trial 
unless they represent an exacerbation in intensity or frequency. (Definition modified 
from ICH -E2B)  
 
Assessment of Adverse Event Intensity  
The intensity of an adverse event is an estimate of the relative severity of the 
experience made by the investigator based on his or her total clinical experience and 
familiarity with the literature.  The maximal intensity reported during the evaluation period 
should be recorded.  The intensity of adverse eve nts will be characterized as mild, 
moderate or severe as follows:  
 
Mild Events are usually transient, require no special treatment, and do 
not interfere with the patient ’s daily activities.  
Moderate  Events usually introduce a low level of inconvenience  or concern to 
the patient  and may interfere with daily activities, but are usually 
ameliorated by simple therapeutic measures.  
Severe  Events interrupt a patient ’s usual daily activity and generally require 
systemic drug therapy or other treatment.  
 
Asse ssment of Causal Relationship  
A medically -qualified investigator must assess the relationship of any AE to the use of 
study drug, based on available information, using the following guidelines:  
 
1. Related – There is a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may have 
been caused by the study intervention  
2. Not Related  – There is not a reasonable possibility that the adverse event may 
have been caused by the study intervention  
 
Adverse event collection and recording procedures must be designed to meet DSMB 
review and regulatory submission requirements, and ensure drug safety . 
 
Expectedness  
The expectedness of an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction shall be 
determined according to the most current investigator’s brochure or product label. 
“Expected” is defined as an adverse drug experience, the specificity and severity of 
which is consistent with the current investigator brochure or the risk information in the 
investigational plan. This term relates only to the drug, not the patient ’s underlying 
condi tion. Any AE that is not identified in nature, severity, or specificity in the current 
study drug reference document(s) (e.g., investigator’s brochure) is considered 
unexpected. Events that are mentioned in the investigator's brochure as occurring with 
a class of drugs or as anticipated from the pharmacological properties of the drug, but 
not specifically mentioned as occurring with the particular drug under investigation are 
considered unexpected.  For example: Hepatic necrosis would be unexpected if the 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  30 investigational brochure or plan only referred to elevated hepatic enzymes or hepatitis. 
(Adapted from 21 CFR Part 312. 32)  
 
Serious Adverse Event (SAE)  
An adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered serious if it results in any 
of the followi ng outcomes:  
 
1. Death  
2. Life-threatening  
3. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity,  
4. Requires or prolongs hospitalization  
5. Congenital anomaly/birth defect   
6. Important medical events that may not result  in death, be life -threatening, or 
require hospitalizati on may be considered serious  adverse events when, 
based upon appropriate medical judgment, they may  jeopardize the patient 
and may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one  of the 
outcomes listed in this definition. (Source CFR: 21 CFR 312.32 ) 
 
Laboratory Test Abnormalities  
For laboratory test abnormalities that meet the definition of an SAE, that required the 
subject to have the investigational product discontinued or interrupted or required the 
subject to receive specific corrective therapy, the clinical diagnosis rather than the 
laboratory term will be used by the reporting investigator (e.g., anemia versus low 
hemoglobin value).  
 
Life-Threatening  
Life-threatening refers to any adverse event that places the patient  at immediate risk of 
death from the reaction as it occurred.  It does not include a reaction that, had it 
occurred in a more severe form, might have caused death.  (Source CFR: 21 CFR 
312.32)  
 
Requires or Prolongs Hospitalization  
A patient  must be admitted to the hospital for a period greater than 24 hours, for the 
hospitalization to be considered a serious adverse event.  Elective hospital admissions, 
scheduled prior to the study, are not considered serious adverse events unless the 
hospita lization is prolonged.  Planned admissions (as part of a study), hospitalizations 
for less than 24 hours, hospitalization for an elective procedure, and Emergency 
Room/Department visits are not considered serious adverse events.  Exception: Any 
disposition o f the patient  to the hospital or emergency room within 24 hours following 
study drug (infusion) therapy.  
7.4 Reporting Procedures  
The SAE reporting flow chart will be included in the MOP . 
 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  31 Protocol Specific Exceptions to SAE Reporting  
Specified outcome eve nts in the study will be recorded in their respective appropriate 
modules of the eCRF. These events and specific corresponding symptoms will NOT 
require reporting as serious adverse events on the SAE eCRF. Specifically, the events 
covered in this exception  are as follows:  
 
1. Myocardial infarction  
2. Stroke  
3. Coronary revascularization  
4. Hospitalization for unstable angina  
 
Serious Adverse Event Reporting   
The site investigator is responsible for monitoring the safety of participants enrolled into 
the study. All SAEs  must be reported from the time of randomization through 30 days 
post final infusion, using the electronic data capture system.  Non-serious adverse 
events will not be collected on the eCRF. All SAEs whether or not deemed drug -related 
or expected must be re ported by the investigator or qualified designee within 24 hours 
of first becoming aware of the event. The investigator or qualified designee will enter the 
required information regarding the SAE into the appropriate module of the eCRF. If the 
eCRF system is temporarily unavailable, the event, including the investigator -
determined causality to study drug will be reported via the back -up paper SAE form to 
DCRI Safety Surveillance at 1 -866-668-7138. Upon return of the availability of EDC 
system, the SAE infor mation must be entered into the eCRF.  
 
Adverse events that are serious and drug (infusion) therapy related or result in death 
will be reviewed by the DCRI Safety Surveillance Department Medical Monitor to assess 
medical clarity and unexpectedness.  DCRI Saf ety Surveillance will review all SAE data 
including all deaths, within 1 -2 business days to:  
 
1. Ascertain seriousness  
2. Ascertain drug (infusion) therapy causal relationship  
3. Verify that all data are complete  
4. Follow -up with the site for incomplete data and/or data clarification.  
 
This will include, but will not be limited to , ensuring that serious criteria have been met 
and the SAE data received are reviewed, entered and coded using the MedDRA coding 
dictionary.  
 
DCRI Safety Surveillance will notify the study sponsors (NIH and TACT2 Principal 
Investigators from Mount Sinai and Duke Clinical Research Institute), and Data Safety 
Monitoring Board Chairman (DSMB)) in a blinded fashion, within 1 business day of 
receipt of the initial notification of the SAE, of:  
 All serious adverse events that are drug (infusion) therapy related – defined as 
taking place within 24 hours of an infusion, and attributed to the infusion by the 
site PI or by DCRI Medical Monitor, and/or  
 All SAEs resulting in death  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  32  
The DCRI Safety Surve illance will provide the DCRI Regulatory Services with the event 
specific forms necessary to report the expedited adverse event according to country 
specific regulatory guidelines. This will include all deaths assessed by the DCRI Medical 
Monitor as warran ting expedited reporting to the regulatory authorities and all adverse 
events that are serious, unexpected and drug (infusion) therapy related (as assessed by 
the site investigator, DCRI Medical Monitor and TACT2 study leadership).  
 
Procedures for Enhance d Reporting of Specific Adverse Events  
DCRI Safety Surveillance will also report specific adverse and/or serious adverse 
events, not otherwise eligible for expedited SAE reporting as in Section 7.2, within 2 
business days to the DSMB or its designee, and t he NIH Program Officers. The adverse 
events for enhanced scrutiny include:  
 
1. Heart failure hospitalization during the entire infusion phase of the patient’s 
participation in the study, not otherwise subjected to expedited SAE reporting.  
2. Any disposition of the patient to the hospital or emergency room within 24 
hours following study drug (infusion) therapy, not otherwise subject to 
expedited SAE reporting.   
 
These events would not be eligible for expedited SAE reporting if the causality criterion 
were not me t. Notification of these events will be made electronically . 
7.5 Follow -up for Serious Adverse Events  
All reported SAEs will be followed until resolution, stabilization or until 60 days after the 
last patient  enrolled in the trial completes the study drug (infusion) therapy. At the time 
of database lock, unresolved SAEs may be closed (final outcome assigned as 
“unresolved”) per the discretion of the DCRI Medical Monitor and/or the DCC PI. The 
site investigator will be responsible for reporting adverse event s and unanticipated 
problems involving risks to subjects to their local IRBs/IECs in accordance with local 
regulations.  
7.6 Safety Monitoring   
Data and Safety Monitoring Board  
TACT2 will have an independent DSMB appointed by and reporting to NIH. The DSMB 
will be expected to meet with the study leadership at least 2 times per year to review 
study progress and overall safety. For ethical reasons, an interim examination of key 
safety and endpoint data will be performed during the course of the trial. A separa te 
DSMB charter outlining the operating guidelines for the committee and the protocol for 
evaluation of data will be created prior to study enrollment and agreed upon during the 
initial meeting of the DSMB.  
 
 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  33 8. INTERVENTION INTE RRUPTION   
Reasons for Withdrawal/  Interruption  
There may be reasons for subject withdrawal and/or interruption of the study infusions 
and/or OMVM.  
 
Some possible reasons are:  
 
 Died 
 Lost to follow -up  
 Informed consent withdrawal   
 
Subject adherence and retention strategies will be included in the site personnel 
training. Site personnel will be encouraged to have weekly communications with 
enrolled subjects as a means of continued participation. The site investigator should 
make every attempt to accommodate the subject to continue  the therapy where feasible 
and encourage subject to allow follow -up by the DCRI Call Center.  
  
Withdrawal Procedures  
Site study personnel must immediately communicate , with the CCC PI, all information 
from subjects that express desire to stop study treatment (either infusions or OMVM) , 
follow -up or  withdrawing informed consent.  When all attempts by the site study 
personnel to accommodate the subject are unsuccessful, the final disposition of a 
subject withdrawal from study treatment and /or follow -up will require  approval by the 
CCC PI . See the MOP for details.  
9. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
9.1 General Design Issues   
Analysis of the TACT2 2x2 factorial trial will be based  on intention to treat (ITT). That is, 
participants will be analyzed (and endpoints attributed) according to the treatment 
strategy to which participants are randomized, regardless of subsequent additional post -
randomization treatment and medical care. Sta tistical comparisons will be performed 
using two -sided significance tests. Treatment dropouts and consent withdrawals will be 
tracked by verifiable means within the eCRF at each follow -up interval. Baseline  
demographic and clinical variables will be summar ized for each randomized arm of the 
study. Descriptive summaries of the distribution of continuous variables will be 
presented in terms of percentiles (e.g., median, 25th and 75th percentiles) along with 
means and standard deviations.  Categorical variables  will be summarized in terms of 
frequencies and percentages.  
9.2 Sample Size and Randomization  
Participants will be randomized in a 1:1:1:1 allocation ratio using simple randomization.  
The study was originally designed  to enroll a total of 1200 participant s with a minimum 
follow -up of 12 months.  The DSMB conducted a blinded review of enrollment aggregate 
event rates , and projected event rates  in July 2019 . Following this blinded review, the 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  34 DSMB  recommended a reduc tion in t he target sample size to 1100 part icipants and an 
increase  in the m inimum follow -up from 1 year to approximately  2.5 years.  Due to 
slowed enrollment related to the COVID -19 pandemic, in the fall of 2020, the DSMB and 
the NIH leadership agreed to a proposal to complete enrollment by 12/31/2020 with an 
allowance to follow the study participants until there are enough primary endpoint 
events to maintain 85+% power.  
 
Several design factors and research objectives have been considered in developing an 
appropriate sample size for the TACT2  study. First, patient  enrollment and follow -up has 
been determined so there would be a sufficient number of endpoints to provide a high 
degree of confidence for testing the primary hypothesis. Second, the statistical power 
for secondary endpoints has been  considered. Finally, the sample size has been 
determined to provide a reasonable level of confidence for detecting clinically important 
differences in outcome between treatment strategies even if current projections of event 
rates and hypothesized differe nces in clinical outcomes between the treatment groups 
prove to be optimistic.  
 
Table 3 shows the required number of endpoint events to have 80% to 90% power with 
hazard ratios varying from 0.50 to 0.75. The two factors (EDTA chelation and OMVM) 
are assume d to be additive for the sample size calculations. Based on TACT  we 
anticipate  a hazard ratio of 0.70 (active chelation vs. placebo chelation) to determine the 
sample size requirements. This hazard ratio assum ption is very conservative compared 
to the observed effect in TACT . Assuming a two -sided 0.05 type I error rate and 
approximately 5% consent withdrawal or loss -to-follow -up per year, the final sample 
size of 1000 participants  will provide approximately 85%  power to detect a hazard ratio 
of 0.70 for the primary endpoint of time to all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina comparing 
active chelation vs. placebo chelation.

Calculations performed using nQuery 7.0 and assume a 0.05 type I error rate (two-sided) with 1:1 
randomization.  
 
For other exploratory endpoints, we outline a general power justification for 
comparisons to be made among the four arms of the 2 x2 factorial design.  We anticipate 
that roughly 1000 participants will have blood and urin e samples available from baseline  
and one or more follow -up time points.  A sample size of 250 participants per group will 
provide 80% or greater power for any between group differences greater than ¼ of a 
standard deviation.  These calculations are based on  a two -sample t -test and assume a 
two-sided type I error rate of 0.05 . 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  35 9.3  Definition of ITT Population  
The ITT population will correspond to all randomized participants. The primary and 
secondary analyses will follow the ITT principle.  
9.4 Interim Analy ses and Stopping Rules  
For ethical reasons, interim examinations of key safety and process data will be 
performed at regular intervals during the course of the trial. It is anticipated that the 
DSMB will meet at 6 -month intervals to review the accumulating  data. Prior to 
performing interim analyses, aggregate event rates will be assessed  to compare 
predicted vs . actual event rates.  The DCC will create regular reports to track patient  
enrollment reports, rates of adherence with the assigned treatment strateg y, and 
frequency of protocol violations. Prior to each meeting, the data coordinating center will 
conduct any requested statistical analyses and prepare a summary report along with the 
following information: patient  enrollment reports, rates of adherence w ith the assigned 
treatment, and description of SAEs (statistical comparisons of the randomized arms with 
respect to these SAEs will use chi -square or other appropriate 2 -sample or >2 -sample 
methods). Safety data will be reported by all 4 treatment groups a s well as active 
chelation vs. placebo chelation and active OMVM vs. placebo OMVM.  The DSMB will 
review data partially masked by study group (such as X vs. Y and not active chelation 
vs. placebo chelation).   
 
Safety reports will be prepared for the DSMB ap proximately once every 3 months.  
Futility and efficacy monitoring will focus solely on the active chelation vs. placebo  
chelation  comparison.  The DSMB will review the active OMVM vs. placebo  OMVM  data 
for safety purposes only.  
 
For futility monitoring, TAC T2 will employ a modification of the inefficacy monitoring 
guideline of Freidlin, Korn, and Gray48 to stop the trial if the chelation strategy is not 
beneficial. We plan to use a conservative boundary, denoted as LIB0, along with a harm 
look at 25% of ex pected information. This approach will include 4 interim looks 
scheduled at roughly 25%, 40%, 60%, and 80%  of expected information . With the 
proposed design, a total of roughly 280 primary endpoint events are expected and the 
first interim review for futil ity and efficacy will be scheduled after approximately 70 
primary endpoint events have been observed. The harm look at 25% of expected 
information would suggest stopping the trial i f the data suggest s harm for the chelation 
strategy vs. the placebo chelati on with p-value s <0.05  for both the primary outcome and 
the all -cause mortality endpoint.  For the interim reviews at 40%, 60%, and 80%, the 
inefficacy guideline  suggest s stopping the trial if the chelation infusion strategy has a 
hazard ratio > 1.0 compare d to placebo for both the primary outcome and the all -cause 
mortality endpoint.  This inefficacy monitoring approach will result in a trivial loss of 
power and requires no sample size adjustment.  
 
The method of Haybittle and Peto49,50 will be proposed a s the primary guide for 
interpreting interim efficacy analyses. The timing of the interim efficacy analyses will 
correspond to the futility monitoring reviews  (i.e. at roughly 25%, 40%, 60%, and 80% of 
expected information) . The proposed efficacy monitorin g guideline requires large critical 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  36 values (Z=3, p≤0.001) for every assessment until the planned final analysis.  The TACT2 
investigators suggest that  both the primary outcome and the all -cause mortality 
outcome are  evaluated at the interim reviews with a focus on the comparison of active 
chelation vs. placebo.   
 
The CCC PI, DCC PIs, CCC staff, clinical study Co -PIs, site investigators, NIH Program 
Staff and study participants will remain blinded until database lock.  Limited staff will be 
unblinded to handle  randomization codes, deliver  the interventions to sites , and prepare 
DSMB reports . The statistical staff responsible for p reparing DSMB reports will not 
directly interact with the clinical team that delivers care to the study participants or the 
CEC that determines clinical events.  
 9.5 Outcomes   
9.5.1  Primary Outcome   
The primary outcome is the time to the first occurrence of all -cause mortality, 
myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable 
angina.  
9.5.2  Secondary Outcomes   
The three secondary outcomes of TACT2 are:  
  
 the overall rate of events due to all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina events  
  
 the time to the first occurrence of cardiovascular mortality, recurrent myocardial 
infarction, or stroke  
 
 the time to all -cause mortality  
 
The TACT2 CEC will review all primary and secondary endpoints .  
9.6 Data Analyses   
Primary Endpoint Analysis  
The primary objective of TACT2  is to determine if the chelation -based strategy 
increases the time to composite of all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina compared to the 
placebo chelation strategy. The stati stical comparison will be based on the time from 
randomization to the first occurrence of all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, 
coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina. The Cox proportional 
hazards regression model will be used to assess outcome differences between the 
treatments. An initial Cox model will include indicator variables for the active chelation 
and active OMVM groups, an interaction term for the active chelation and active OMVM, 
age, sex, and use of insulin. If the interaction term for the active chelation and active 
OMVM is not statistically significant at the two -sided 0. 05 level, the primary analysis will 
be based on a Cox model which includes indicator variables for the active chelation and 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  37 active  OMVM groups, age, sex, and use of insulin. The chelation treatment effect will be 
summarized using hazard ratios and associated 95% confidence intervals. In addition to 
the statistical hypothesis testing, Kaplan -Meier51 survival estimates will be construc ted 
based on the time from randomization to the first primary event occurrence.  
 
The OMVM treatment effect from the Cox model will be estimated using the Cox model 
described above.  Given the results of TACT  and the focus on chelation therapy, the 
interpret ation of the OMVM treatment effect will be considered exploratory.  
Assessment of the proportional hazards assumption will be evaluated using visual 
analysis (of the survival and log  {-log (survival)} functions), as well as tools within the 
“proportionality  test” statement of Proc Phreg in SAS.  
 
Secondary Endpoint Analysis  
The analyses for the time -to-event secondary endpoints will be similar to those outlined 
for the primary endpoint using the time from randomization through the first occurrence 
of any component of a specific secondary endpoint (or censoring) as the response 
variable, and assessing group differences using the Cox proportional hazards model. 
The effect of the chelation treatment strategy vs. placebo chelation on these time -to-
event second ary endpoints will be summarized using hazard ratios (with associated 
confidence intervals) computed from the Cox model. Kaplan -Meier curves will be 
constructed to display the cumulative event rates of the treatment groups.   
To test the individual treatmen t strategies against the placebo chelation – placebo 
OMVM group, we will add three indicator variables to the Cox proportional hazards 
model described above.  
 
Recurrent event analyses encompassing the overall event rate of endpoints for 
each patient .  
The components of this endpoint will include all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, 
stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina events. We 
plan to analyze this endpoint using two statistical techniques. The two approaches are: 
  
a) A generalization of the Cox model to handle recurrent events, developed by 
Anderson & Gill, with robust standard errors to account for heterogeneity.52,53 
b) A marginal modeling approach developed by Wie, Lin, and Weissfeld.54 
 
The Anderson -Gill approa ch will be considered the primary analysis for the total number 
of all -cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary revascularization, or 
hospitalization for unstable angina events endpoint.  
 
Exploratory Endpoints  
The comparison of costs will test mean direct medical costs incurred during the study 
(index infusion through end of follow -up). To account for staggered entry and 
incomplete follow -up, costs will be adjusted using the approach of Bang and Tsiatis.55 
Statistical comparisons will be ma de using a normal approximation with standard errors 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  38 estimated using the bootstrap approach. The probability of differences in cost greater 
than thresholds of policy interest (such as $1000, $2000, or $5000) will be calculated. 
Differences in cost by treat ment group will be interpreted in the context of the trial 
clinical results, looking for both consistency and plausibility. Follow -up costs will be 
presented both overall and by category (e.g., in patient  readmission, out patient  
procedures, concomitant medi cations, non -acute institutional care). Cumulative costs 
over the study period between treatment groups will be compared. Descriptive 
comparisons of cost according to clinical variables defining subgroups of interest will 
also be performed.  
 
The analyses f or toxic metals in blood and urine in the TACT2 population will proceed in 
three phases. First, we will evaluate if the chelation regimen has the effect on metal 
internal dose that we have postulated. To do this, we will compare  body metal levels 
(lead in blood , pre-chelation urine lead and cadmium, and post -chelation urine lead and 
cadmium, in separate analyses) between active and placebo chelation  groups at 
baseline  and over the treatment phase of TACT2. Second, we will relate  those levels to 
changes in the primary clinical endpoint (a composite of death from any cause, 
recurrent MI, stroke, coronary revascularization, or hospitalization for unstable angina) 
caused by chelation therapy relative to placebo. Finally, we will perf orm the exploratory 
analyses described below.  
 
Over the 1 -year period, we hypothesize there will be no change in metal levels in the 
placebo chelation group and significant reductions in the active chelation group. We 
also postulate these patterns of chan ge in metal levels will explain, in a statistical sense, 
the clinical benefits we expect to see in TACT2 (the way LDL -cholesterol level lowering 
“explains” the benefits of statin therapy) using three complementary analytic 
approaches: 1] prespecified subgr oup analyses ( patients  in the highest tertile of blood 
lead, urine cadmium , and post -chelation urine lead and cadmium at infusion 1,  will show 
significantly larger treatment benefits (chelation vs. placebo) than patients  with lower 
baseline  levels), 2] lan dmark analyses ( patients  in the chelation arm with lower metal 
levels after 40 infusions/1 year of chelation will show significantly larger clinical benefits 
than patients  with higher levels), and 3] we will apply causal inference modeling to 
evaluate whet her the pattern of metal changes (lead in blood and cadmium in urine) in 
the chelation arm over the treatment period of TACT2 statistically “explains” the 
variation in clinical outcomes responsible for the hypothesized superiority of the 
chelation strategy .  
 
We will also do exploratory analyses to examine the clinical implications of different 
patterns of metal removal over time on the benefits of chelation therapy (can metal 
levels be used as a biomarker to guide the number of chelation sessions needed to  
maximize clinical benefit from this therapy?) and to examine the effects of the oral 
multivitamin/mineral treatment regimen versus placebo vitamins on metal levels and on 
the effectiveness of chelation in reducing those levels (does the TACT2 vitamin regi men 
augment the ability of the chelation regimen to remove metals, or might there be a 
different mechanism of action altogether?). The latter case could be inferred if there 
were clinical benefits of OMVM, but no changes in lead and cadmium levels.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  39  
Subgroup Analyses  
To examine the heterogeneity of the treatment effect, subgroup analyses for the primary 
and secondary endpoints will be performed in order to explore whether the treatment 
effect is consistent across subgroups. Subgroup analyses to evalua te variation in the 
effect of treatments will be performed using interaction terms within the Cox proportional 
hazards model. For binary variables, we will include the subgroup factor as a 
stratification variable within the Cox regression model. This model  structure will 
decrease the reliance on the proportional hazards assumption. Additionally, treatment 
effects within each categorical subgroup will be examined separately using Cox 
proportional hazards models. Event rates by treatment and HRs with 95% conf idence 
intervals will be reported for each subgroup. Forest plots will be generated displaying 
the estimated hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals for each subgroup. For 
subgroups defined using continuous variables, the analysis based on the continuou s 
form will be considered primary but for display purposes these variables can also be 
categorized.  
 
We have pre -specified sex, minorities, age greater than 70, myocardial infarction 
location (anterior MI or not), type of diabetes (1 or 2), insulin treatment of diabetes, use 
of statin therapy at baseline  (for the OMVM analyses only), known peripheral artery 
disease at baseline  as key subgroups of interest. There are also pre -specified analyses 
by tertiles of lead and cadmium as indicated abov e. The examination of these pre -
specified subgroups will include formal tests of interaction within the Cox regression 
model.  
10. DATA COLLECTION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE  
10.1 Data Collection Forms   
A validated Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system will be used for this study.  The 
majority of the study data will be transcribed by study personnel from the source 
documents onto an eCRF and transmitted in a secure manner to the DCC.  All data 
relating to th e study must be recorded in eCRFs developed by DCRI and approved by 
the study sponsor.  Data must be entered into eCRFs in English. The investigator’s 
electronic signature, a compliant platform (21 CFR Part 11) is recorded in the database 
as verification th at all data are complete and accurate.   
10.2 Data Management   
Data will be processed using a validated computer system conforming to regulatory 
requirements.  
 
Computerized data will be accessible only by password, and a centralized monitoring 
system will r ecord and report all access to data. The DCRI computer network is 
protected by a firewall. Electronic CRFs (eCRFs) will be identified by study number only, 
to ensure participant anonymity. No participant identifiers will be used in the 
presentation of data . Except when required by law, participants will not be identified by 
name, personal identification number (e.g. , social security number  in US and  Canada, 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  40 address, telephone number ) or any other direct personal identifier in study records. This 
information will be retained by each individual center and will not be disclosed to the 
Clinical or Data Coordinating Center except as needed for centralized clinical, quality of 
life and econ omic follow -up of the participants. Participants will be informed that the 
study physician and his/her study team will report the results of study -related tests to 
the Clinical and Data Coordinating Center and to the NIH. Participants will be informed 
that their records may be reviewed in order to meet federal, state or regional/local 
regulations. Reviewers may include the CCC/DCC monitors, IRBs/ECs, the NIH, other 
government regulators as dictated by local law, or their delegates.  
 
Records of patients , sou rce documents, monitoring visit logs, eCRFs, inventory  of study 
product, regulatory documents, and other sponsor correspondence pertaining to the 
study must be kept in the appropriate study files at the site. Source documents include 
all recordings and obs ervations or notations of clinical activities and all reports and 
records necessary for the evaluation and reconstruction of the clinical study. These 
records will be retained in a secure file for the period required by the institution or site 
policy.  Prior to transfer or destruction of these records, the DC C must be notified in 
writing and be given the opportunity to further store such records.  
 
10.3 Quality Assurance  
Greater detail will be found in the MOP  for the TACT2 and the individual Manuals for the  
Metals Lab and Biorepository.  Steps to be taken to ensure the accuracy and reliability of 
data include:  
  
 the selection of qualified investigators and appropriate study centers . 
 
 review of protocol procedures with the investigator and associated personnel  
before the study .

protocol procedures.  
 
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  42  tracking recruitment of patients entered  updating relevant trial information on the 
trial web site . 
10.4 Medical Information Coding  
For medical information, th e following thesauri will be used:  
 
 Latest version of MedDRA for adverse events, and  
 World Health Organization Drug Dictionary for concomitant medications.  
11. PARTICIPANT  RIGHTS AND CONFIDENTIALITY   
11.1 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Review   
All TACT2 sites will submit the study protocol, informed consent form, and other study 
documents to their corresponding IRB for approval. Any amendments to the protocol, 
other than minor administrative changes, must be approved by each IRB before they 
are implemente d.  
 
11.2 Informed Consent Forms  
TACT2 sites will obtain informed consent from each study participant prior to 
randomization.  Trained personnel as listed in the Delegation of Authority log will obtain 
consent.  In all cases in which the patient  does not have an understanding of English, 
sites will obtain an IRB approved  translation of the study consent  to present to the 
patient . Patient s will have ample opportunity to review the consent form, ask questions, 
and make an informed decision on risks  and benefits.  
11.3 Participant Confidentiality   
Overall policy:  Any data, specimens, forms, reports, video recordings, and other records 
that leave the site will be identified only by a participant identification number 
(Participant ID, PID) to maintain confidentiality. All records will be kept in a locked file 
cabinet. All computer entry and networking programs will be done using PIDs only. 
Information will not be released without written permission of the participant, except as 
necessary for monitoring by IRB, the FDA, the NCCIH, and the OHRP.  
 
Exceptions to the policy:  
1. The Study Pharmacy, following standard regulatory procedures, will deliver a -
specific prescription for each study infusion.  As such, they will know PHI for each 
patient.  The PHI for each  patient will be kept in a secured pharmacy computer, 
behind a firewall, and will be known to a minimum number of pharmacy 
personnel.  
2. The DCRI Call Center will make the initial  patient follow -up by phone.  As such, 
they will need to know PHI including patie nt name, next -of-kin, etc.  Again, this 
information will be kept secured in the DCRI Call Center.  
TACT2 Protocol  May 6, 2021  43 11.4 Study Discontinuation  
Procedures for study discontinuation will be detailed in the TACT2 MOP .

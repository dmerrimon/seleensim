Study Title  A Randomized, Double -blind, Placebo -controlled, 3  Dose Level, Parallel -group 
Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Plecanatide in Adolescents 12 to < 18 Years of 
Age with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation  (CIC)  
Sponsor  Synergy Pharmaceutical Inc.  
Sponsor Study No.  SP304202 -13 
Phase  2b 
Study Centers  The study will be conducted at approximately 40 clinical sites in the United States   
Objectives  Primary objective :  
To evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 different doses of oral plecanatide taken once daily for 8  weeks as treatment for CIC in adolescents 12 to less than 18 years 
of age  
Secondary objectives : 
• To identify the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of plecanatide in this patient population (to the extent possible since plecanatide is not expe cted to be 
absorbed)  
• To evaluate the effect of 3 selected dose levels of plecanatide on stool consistency and relief of CIC -related symptoms in adolescents 12 to less than 18 
years of age  
• To assess the effect of 3 selected dose levels of plecanatide on th e frequency of 
complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs)  
Study Design  This is a randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter, parallel- group 
study of the efficacy and safety of 3 dose levels of plecanatide (0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg) 
in adolescent patients 12 to less than 18  years of age with CIC. Patient 
randomization will focus on the balanced enrollment of males and females across 
the 4  treatment groups.  
This Phase 2b study will comprise a 28 -day bowel habit Screening/Baseline Period, 
an 8-week Treatment Period, and a 2 -week Posttreatment Follow -up Period. Patients 
will visit the clinic 5  times during the study.  
Screening/Baseline Period: Patients’ legally authorized representatives (e.g. , parent  
or guardian) will provide informed paren tal permission and patients will provide 
written assent before they undergo any protocol -specified procedures or 
assessments. At the Screening visit, patients will undergo a review of medical 
history, a review of prior and concomitant medications, a brief dietary history, and 
physical examination. During the 28 -day Screening/Baseline Period prior to 
randomization, patients will record - through an electronic diary  - daily assessments 
of bowel movements (BMs), stool consistency (using the Bristol Stool Form Scale 
[BSFS]), abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, abdominal bloating, straining and pain when passing stools, fecal incontinence, excessive flatulence, and feel ing of 
incomplete evacuation following bowel movement. Data from the electronic diary 
will be used to confirm study eligibility immediately prior to the randomization 
visit, as well as to characterize the patient’s baseline chronic constipation status with  
which the change from Baseline across and at the end of the 8- week treatment 
period will be compared.  
Treatment Period : Patients who meet all entry criteria will be randomly assigned to 
1 of 4 treatment groups (3 active, 1 placebo) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio on Day 1 of the 
Treatment Period. Randomization will be stratified to ensure gender balance across 
treatment groups. Patients will take an oral dose of the study drug once daily for 
8 weeks and continue to complete their daily electronic diaries with recording  of 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 5 of 79 May 18, 2017  BMs, rescue medication use for constipation, abdominal pain, and other symptoms. 
At Weeks 1, 4, and 8 of the Treatment Period, patients will return to the clinic to 
undergo safety and efficacy  assessments.  
Posttreatment Follow -up Period: For 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug, 
patients will continue to complete their daily electronic diaries. Patients will then return to the clinic for a final Follow -up visit at the end of Week 10.  
The planned duration of participation in this study will be appro ximately 14 weeks 
from signing of informed consent/assent through posttreatment.  
Study Drug  Plecanatide 0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg tablets and matching placebo for oral administration  
Treatment  Following a 28- day Screening Baseline Period, patients will be randomly assigned 
to 1 of 3 plecanatide doses (0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg) or to matching placebo. Study drug 
will be provided as a 4- week supply of tablets in blister packs. It will be distributed 
on Day 1 and replenished at Week 4. Patients will take the assign ed dose of study 
drug each morning approximately at the same time for 8 weeks.  
Dulcolax® will be provided as a rescue laxative that can be used if a patient has not 
had a bowel movement for at least 72 hours. Patients will be advised that it is preferred that they NOT take rescue medication for the period from 24 hours before to 72 hours after Day 1 of dosing.  
Number of Patients and 
Population  Approximately 120 adolescents with CIC will be randomized (~30 in each treatment 
group) into the study.  Eligibility for study enrollment (2 or fewer  SBMs per week, 
adequate diary entry compliance and proper use of rescue medication) will be 
confirmed by electronic diary entries made during each week of the two-week 
baseline diary assessment.  
Key Inclusion Criteria  Male or female adolescents 12 to less than 18 years of age diagnosed with CIC based on the Rome III criteria for child/adolescent functional constipation.  
Key Exclusion Criteria 
(abbreviated)  • Medical history or  condition s that may be  affecting GI motility or defecation  
• Lack of willingnes s to use Dulcolax® as the only laxative.  
• Non-compliance with eDiary and rescue medication use.  
Criteria for Evaluation of 
Efficacy and Safety  Efficacy endpoints  
The primary efficacy endpoint is:   
Proportion of responders for the last 2 weeks of the Treatment  Period (responder = a 
child who experiences >3 SBMs per week for  each of the last two weeks of the 
treatment period) compared to  placebo and across treatment groups .   
The key secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
• Change from Baseline in stool consistency (as assessed by BSFS)  
• Change from Baseline in frequency of SBMs  
• Change from Baseline in frequency of CSBMs  
Additional efficacy endpoints are:   
• Change  from Baseline in CIC -related symptoms ( abdominal pain , abdominal 
bloating, abdominal discomfort, straining  with a bowel movement and pain 
with defecation)  
• Frequency/ severity of excessive flatulence  
• Frequency of fecal incontinence 
• Patient Reported Global Assessments  (PGA, PAC -SYM and PAC -QOL)  
 
Pharmacokinetic endpoints  
Single dose and steady state of plasma plecanatide (population modeling):  
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 6 of 79 May 18, 2017  • Plasma concentration of plecanatide (Note:  measurable plecanatide levels 
have not been observed in the adult population)  
• PK parameters, including C max, Tmax, and C min (only if a sufficient number of 
plecanatide levels can be measured to allow computation of these parameters)  
Safety endpoints  
• Frequency of treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs)  
• Significant shifts from Baseline values in laboratory analytes and vital signs  
Statistical Methods  Analysis Populations  
Analysis populations include the Safety population, the Intent -to-treat (ITT)  
population, and the Per -Protocol (PP) population. The Safety population will include 
all patients who were randomly assigned to a treatment group and received at least 1 
dose of study drug. The ITT population will include all patients who were 
randomized to receive study drug. The PP population will be used for sensitivity 
analyses, and will consist of all patients in the ITT  populat ion without any 
significant protocol violations. The ITT population will be the primary population for efficacy analyses.  
 
Patient Characteristics and Disposition  
Demographic characteristics (including age, gender, race, weight, height, and body mass index) and characteristics of patients’ CIC history will be summarized by 
descriptive statistics for each treatment group.  
Efficacy Analyses  
Primary Efficacy Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of responders for the last 2 weeks of 
the Treatment Period (responder = a child who experiences >3 SBMs per week for 
each of the last two weeks of the treatment period) compared to placebo and across treatment groups.   The change from baseline in mean weekly SBM rate will be 
analyzed using a linear mixed -
effects model with fixed effects for gender 
(stratification variable), treatment, week, and the corresponding baseline value; a random intercept for patient will also be specified.  The least squares (LS) mean change from baseline will be presented, by treatment group, and the difference in LS 
means for each plecanatide treatment group compared to placebo will be presented, 
with 95% confidence intervals and corresponding statistical p -values.
 
 
Secondary Efficacy Analysis  
The secondary efficacy endpo ints are:  
• Change from baseline in weekly average stool consistency (BSFS) score over the 8 -week treatment period, and by study week  
• Change from baseline in the weekly rate of SBMs, by study week  
• Change from baseline in the weekly rate of CSBMs over the 8-week treatment 
period, and by study week 
The mean in each period and the change from baseline will be summarized in each treatment group. Differences between treatment groups will be analyzed with an analysis of covariance, including fixed effects for gender (stratification variable) and treatmen t and corresponding baseline value as a covariate. A least squares mean 
with 95%  confidence intervals will be presented for the difference between each 
plecanatide group and placebo.  
 
Pharmacokinetic Analyses  
Plasma plecanatide (and its major metabolite S P-338) concentrations will be 
assessed  for all patients pre -dose on Day 1, and  at Week 4 and Week  8 visits. 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 7 of 79 May 18, 2017  Intensive PK sampling (30, 60, 90 and 120 min post -dose on Day 1) will be done in 
a subset of approximately 40 patients at selected sites. Descriptive PK parameters 
will be presented and to the extent possible will be analyzed.   
Safety Analyses  
The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities ( Version 1 4.1 or higher) will be 
used to classify all AEs with respect to system organ class and preferred ter m. 
Adverse events, changes in clinical laboratory parameters, and vital signs will be analyzed descriptively. Shifts in key laboratory parameters will be summarized from Baseline to the end of the study. Similarly, shifts in toxicity of key laboratory 
parameters and proportion of patients with abnormal clinical and vital sign results 
will be summarized.

This is a n exploratory, randomized, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter, parallel -group 
study of the efficacy and safet y of 3 dose levels of plecanatide (0.5, 1.0, or 1.5 mg) in adolescent 
patients 12 to less than 18 years of age with CIC. Approximately 120 patients will be enrolled at 
approximately 40 study sites in the United States. Patient randomization will focus on the balanced enrollment of males and females across the 4 treatment groups.  
The overall study plan is presented in Figure  1.

After written informed consent /assent is obtained at Visit 1 , patients will be screened for study 
eligibility . Qualifying patients will be instructed on the use of an electronic diary that will serve 
to record information on their daily bowel habits, rescue medication use and symptoms 
associated with CIC . 
 Patient  will begin  diary  entries  following Visit 1 and continue daily  diary  entries  for the 
remainder  of the study.  The information  recorded  by the patient  in the diary  during the 2 
weeks  just prior to Visit  2 will confirm study  eligibility,  confirm  diary  compliance and 
establish  baseline  values  for primary  and secondary  efficacy  endpoints. The interval between 
Visit 1 (Screening) and Visit 2 (Randomization) should ideally be 28 days to ensure 2 weeks of ‘diary practice’ experience and 2 weeks  for baseline diary recording. A m inimum of 1 week of 
‘diary practice’ is required prior to the 2- week baseline diary recording.  
 At Visit 2 (Day 1 of Treatment Period), patients who meet all study entry criteria will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups (3 active, 1 placebo) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The patients will take their first dose of study drug at the clinical  site, and continue to take a 
single  oral dose daily  for 8 weeks.  Supplies  of the study  drug will be replenished  at the  Week  
4 Visit. At Weeks  4 and 8, patients  will return  to the clinic  to undergo  safety  and efficacy  
assessments.  
 For 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug, patients will continue to complete their daily electronic diaries. Patients will return to the clinic for a final Follow -up visit at the end of    
Week 10.  The planned duration of participation in this study will be approximately 14 weeks (98 days) from signing of informed consent/assent through posttreatment.  TREATMENT PERIOD

Final Version 4.0 Page 17 of 79 May 18, 2017  2 INTRODUCTION 
2.1 BACKGROUND  AND RATIONALE  
2.1.1 Chronic Idiopathic Constipation in Adults  
Idiopathic or functional constipation is a common disorder, affecting approximately 15% of the 
adult population of the United States (US), depending on demographic factors and the definitions used (Higgins, 2004). Internationally, similar prevalence rates have been reported in most geographic areas ( Suares, 2011; Pare, 2001; Peppas, 2008). Constipation is a symptom of many 
diseases and is a collective term used to imply infrequent stools, incomplete bowel movements (BMs), straining, bloating, and hard lumpy stool (Cash, 2007).  Treatment for constipation is usually based on increased dietary fiber and supplementation with bulking agents; exercise; and habit training.  However, often only partial relief is obtained, and many patients use non-bulking laxatives on a regular basis without medical supervision.  Chronic use of laxatives is often inappropriate, and may lead to side effects, such as dependency and progressive tolerance, electrolyte imbalance, and, for the anthraquinones, melanosis coli.  In addition, stimulant laxatives may damage the myenteric plexus, resulting in catha rtic colon.  Laxatives available 
over the counter are, in general, approved for episodic and not chronic use. 
2.1.2 Chronic Idiopathic Constipation in Children  
Although a lack of a uniform and consistent definition (or definitions) for “chronic constipation” 
make it difficult to estimate the prevalence of constipation, several published reports confirm that it is a prevalent condition worldwide in children as well as adults. It is important to recognize that while clinical trial populations are generally defin ed using Rome Criteria ( Appendix A), it 
is not as common to apply them in clinical practice and therefore they are not used uniformly as the basis for epidemiology studies of chronic constipation across adult populations or studies among the various pediatric age groups.  A recent comprehensive review of the published literature on the epidemiology of pediatric constipation concludes that the median value of reported prevalence rates among 19 published 
articles was in a range from 0.7 % to 29.6%, with a median of 12% (Mugie, 2011). No consistent 
gender differences for constipation in children have been noted. However, similar to adults, high body mass index (BMI) and low socioeconomic status appear to be associated with a higher prevalence of constipation in the pediatric population. A positive family history has been found in 28% to 50% of children with constipation and a higher incidence has been reported in 
monozygot ic than in dizygotic twins. Approximately 40% of children with functional 
constipation develop symptoms during the first year of life (Davidson, 1963; Benninga, 1993) while 16% of parents of 22- month old children report constipation in their child (Cash, 2007). 
Peak incidence occurs at the time of toilet training (2 -4 years of age), with an increased 
prevalence in boys.  
 Constipation in children is recognized as having a significant impact on the overall health care system, with constipation representing 3% to 5% of general pediatric outpatient visits and up to 
25% of pediatric gastroenterology consultations (Partin, 1992; Caplan, 2005).  Two drugs are approved in the US for treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation in adults - 
linaclotide and lubiprostone. There is still unmet need for treatment of constipation in children.

Final Version 4.0 Page 18 of 79 May 18, 2017  Plecanatide as a member of the guanylate cyclase (GC -C) agonist class of oral therapeutic agents 
is expected to improve the current therapy for CIC. 
2.1.3 Plecanatide Mechanism of Action and Pharmacology 
Plecanatide (SP -304) is a peptide discovered and synthesized by Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc. 
(here inafter referred to as Synergy).  
Plecanatide binds to the GC -C receptor expressed on epithelial cells that line the inte stinal 
lumen.  This binding of drug to the GC -C receptor stimulates the intracellular production of 
cyclic guanosine monophosphate, resulting in decreased Na+ reabsorption through Na+/H+ 
exchange and activation of Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) 
(Sindic, 2006). Activation of CFTR in turn enhances transepithelial efflux of chloride and 
bicarbonate ions and as a consequence fluid secretion into the intestinal lumen is stimulated.  This fluid secretion is expected to facilitate BMs.  Nonclinical data (in human colon carcinoma 
T84 cells and in animals) suggested potential therapeutic utility of orally dosed plecanatide in the treatment of CIC.  
2.1.4 Clinical Experience in Adults  
In clinical trials completed to date, plecanatide has been found to be safe and well -tolerated.  
Plecanatide has been shown to increase the frequency of bowel movements (BMs) in patients with Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC); effects on stool consistency and reduction of the time to first bowel movement were also seen.  
 SP304101- 08 was a Phase  1 single -dose escalation study in 71 healthy adult subjects receiving 
doses of 0.1, 0.3, 0.9, 2.7, 5.4, 8.1, 16.2, 24.3, or 48.6 mg plecanatide (n=53) or placebo (n=18) (IB for Plecanatide).  The study reported no systemic absorption at any dose and no serious adverse events (SAEs) or withdrawals due to adverse events ( AEs).  Diarrhea was the most 
common AE in the study, reported by 8 of 53 (15.1%) plecanatide subjects and 3  of 18 (16.7%) 
placebo subjects.  The occurrence of diarrhea did not appear to be dose related.  Other AEs occurring in 2 or more subjects included abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting (Shailubhai, 2009).  SP304201- 09 was a Phase 2a 14-day, repeat -dose, placebo -controlled, oral dose -escalation study 
to determine the safety of plecanatide in adult patients with CIC (Shailubhai, ACG 2010 Poster). Seventy -eight patients were enrolled in this study and randomized to r eceive 1 of 4 plecanatide 
doses   (0.3 mg, 1.0 mg, 3.0 mg, or 9.0 mg) or placebo.  Each dose cohort consisted of 20 patients 
(15 active; 5 placebo).  After each cohort was completed, a safety review was conducted prior to initiating the next dose cohort.  No SAEs or withdrawals  due to AEs occurred for any of the 
patients who received plecanatide during this study.  None of the 58 patients treated with plecanatide in this study had diarrhea.  The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity and transient in nature.  SP304-20210 was a large, 12- week, double -blind, placebo- controlled, multicenter, dose -ranging 
study in adult patients with CIC  (study data on file). A total of 951 patients were randomized at 
113 clinical sites in the US.  Randomization was 1:1:1:1 to plecanatide (0.3, 1.0, or 3.0 mg) or 
placebo.  In this study, 948 patients received study drug (712 plecanatide) and 946 patients had at least 1 study assessment and were included in the modified Intent -to-Treat (ITT) population.  In 
the high- dose group (3.0 mg, n=237), the proportion of patients who were overall responders 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 19 of 79 May 18, 2017  (19%) was statistically significantly greater than in patients treated with placebo (10.7%) 
(p=0.009).  Among secondary endpoints for Protocol SP304- 20210, there were statistically significant 
chang es from baseline (as compared to placebo) in the frequency of complete spontaneous bowel 
movements ( CSBMs ), stool consistency (higher Bristol Stool Form Scale [BSFS] score), and 
straining that were dose -related, with the greatest change and degree of statistical significance at 
the 3.0- mg dose group.  The median times to first SBM were statistically significantly shorter for 
all doses of plecanatide compared to placebo (27.3 hours) with the shortest median time to first spontaneous bowel movement ( SBM ) of 1 2.5 hours at the 3.0- mg dose.  In addition, the 
proportion of patients who had a SBM in the first 24 hours was 41.5% with placebo as compared to 55.7% (0.3 mg), 53.8% (1.0 mg), and 67.5% (3.0 mg) in plecanatide -treated patients.  
Statistically significantl y different (from placebo) changes in patient global assessments and the 
PAC -SYM
© and PAC -QOL© scales were also observed over the 12 weeks of treatment at the 
1.0- and 3.0- mg doses.  In general, plecanatide was safe and well tolerated.  
 Diarrhea was the mo st common AE, which increased with increasing dose to an incidence of 
9.7% in the 3.0- mg dose group.  Of the cases of diarrhea in patients treated with plecanatide, 
0.7% overall were considered severe and in patients receiving 3.0 mg, only one case (0.4%) was 
considered severe.  The other most common treatment -emergent AEs (TEAEs) occurring in at 
least 2% of patients were headache, abdominal pain, nausea, abdominal distension, urinary tract infection, flatulence, and upper respiratory infection.  Serious AEs were uncommon, occurring in only 9 study patients, and none were considered to be related to study drug.  Overall, approximately 5.5% of patients on 3.0 mg of plecanatide withdrew due to AEs compared to 3.4% on placebo.  Three percent of patients at the 3.0-mg dose withdrew participation due to diarrhea 
compared to 0.4% on placebo.  There were no clinically significant changes in laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), or vital signs.  Further details on plecanatide can be found in the investigator’s  brochure (IB).  
 The most recently completed clinical trials in population of patients with CIC were two Phase 3 studies SP304203- 00 and SP304203- 03.  The objectives of these double- blind, placebo -
controlled, parallel -group studies were to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 mg and 6 mg 
doses of plecanatide administered once daily for 12 weeks in a population of patients with CIC – 
male and female patients ages 18 to 80 years. Overall, safety findings were consistent with earlier observations from previous studies and indicate that 12 weeks of plecanatide administration at doses up to 6 mg are generally well tolerated by patients with CIC.  
 In the SP304203-00 study , a total of 1394 patients were randomized, and 1389 patient s received 
at least one dose of study drug at 164 clinical sites in the US and Canada. The two doses of plecanatide (3 mg and 6 mg) that were evaluated over 12 weeks of treatment in CIC patients in this study were generally well tolerated and provided safety observations similar to those associated with exposure to placebo. The percentage of patients (34.3%) in the plecanatide groups reporting at least one TEAE was not substantially different from the percentage of patients in the placebo group (32.8%).   Overall, 469 of the 1389 (33.8%) patients in the Safety Population reported at least one TEAE. A 
total of 818 TEAEs were reported across all treatment groups. Of the 469 patients, 150 patients (32.8%) were in the placebo group, 168 patients (35.4%) were in the 3 -mg plecanatide group, 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 20 of 79 May 18, 2017  and 151 patients (33.0%) were in the 6- mg plecanatide group. The highest rate of patients 
reporting a TEAE (35.4%) and the largest number of reported TEAEs (290) occurred in the 3-mg 
plecanatide group. The percentage of patients  in the plecanatide groups reporting at least one 
TEAE, however, was not substantially different from the percentage of patients in the placebo group.   Treatment -emergent AEs experienced by ≥ 2.0% of patients (in any treatment group) included 
diarrhea (5. 9%, 5.5% − 3-mg and 6 -mg plecanatide groups, respectively); nasopharyngitis (2.4% 
− 6 mg plecanatide); sinusitis (2.1% − 3 mg plecanatide); and in the placebo group, urinary tract 
infection (2.2%), and back pain and headache (2.0% each). Diarrhea (59 [4.2%]) and nasopharyngitis (23 [1.7%]) were reported by the highest percentage of patients overall.   In the SP304203-03 study , a total of 1410 patients were randomized and 1402 patients received 
at least one dose of study drug at 162 clinical sites in the US.  The two doses of plecanatide (3 mg 
and 6 mg) that were evaluated over 12 weeks of treatment in CIC patients in this study were generally well tolerated and provided safety observations similar to those associated with exposure to placebo. The percentage of patients (26.5%) in the plecanatide groups reporting at 
least one TEAE was not substantially different from the percentage of patients in the placebo group (24.7%).  
 Overall, safety findings were consistent with earlier observations from  previous studies and from 
the other phase 3 study of identical design and indicate that 12 weeks of plecanatide administration at doses up to 6 mg are generally well tolerated by patients with CIC.  
Overall, 372 of the 1402 (26.5%) patients in the Safety Population reported at least one TEAE. A total of 618 TEAEs were reported across all treatment groups. Of the 372 patients, 115 patients (24.7%) were in the placebo group, 120 patients (25.7%) were in the 3 -mg plecanatide group, 
and 137 patients (29,2%) were in the 6- mg plecanatide group. The highest rate of patients 
reporting a TEAE (29.2%) and the largest number of reported TEAEs (226) occurred in the 6-mg plecanatide group. The percentage of patients in the plecanatide groups reporting at least one TEAE, however, was not substantially different from the percentage of patients in the placebo 
group.   Treatment -emergent AEs experienced by ≥ 2.0% of patients (in any treatment group) included 
diarrhea (3.2%, 4.5% − 3-mg and 6- mg plecanatide groups, respectivel y) and headache (2.1 % − 
3 mg and 6 mg plecanatide groups each). The percentage of patients who reported diarrhea appeared to correlate with dose of plecanatide treatment.  
 
2.2 O
BJECTIVES  
2.2.1 Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 different doses of oral 
plecanatide taken once daily for 8 weeks as treatment for CIC in adolescents 12 to less than 18 years of age.  
2.2.2 Secondary Objectives  
Secondary objectives are:  
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 21 of 79 May 18, 2017  • To estimate  the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of plecanatide in this patient population (to 
the extent possible, since plecanatide is not expected to be absorbed) 
• To evaluate the effect of 3 selected dose levels of plecanatide on stool consistency and relief 
of CIC -related symptoms in adolescents 12 to less than 18 years of age  
• To assess the effect of 3 selected dose levels of plecanatide on the frequency of complete spontaneous bowel movements (CSBMs)  
2.2.3 Rational e for Dose Select ion 
Safety and efficacy data with plecanatide in adult CIC clinical trials performed to d ate has 
defined a safe and effective dose roughly in the range of 0.05 mg/kg to 0.1 mg/kg. Data suggest that children aged 4 years through 16 years appear to have a GC -C receptor density more 
reflective of a “mature” intestine (Cohen, 1988). Although safety of a particular dose cannot be taken for granted, it is more likely that children in this age group will respond to a GC -C agonist 
similarly to adult patients. Thus, the expectation is that ≤ 0.05 mg/kg should represent safe and effective doses for treat ment of CIC in adolescents  ages 12 to 17 years under study in this 
protocol. There are few data that might shed light on potential physiological differences between adults and children in terms of pharmacological dose-responsiveness to GC-C agonists.   Based on considerable PK experience in the adult population it is known that plecanatide is essentially unabsorbed from the human GI tract in the dose range proven effective for the treatment of adult CIC. There is no expectation that pediatric patients will differ in this respect. Therefore, the doses selected for an adolescent population are anticipated to be safe and well tolerated.  
 
2.3 RISK-BENEFIT ASSESSMENT  
The most common TEAEs in adult patients treated with plecanatide have been diarrhea and other gastrointestinal (GI) -related symptoms such as abdominal cramps, gas, and bloating I nvestigator 
Brochure  (IB) Ed. 8.0 for Plecanatide, 1/2016. It is expected that the plecanatide sa fety profile 
observed in the 12  to < 18-year old pediatric population will be similar to that observed in adult 
patients with CIC.  
 The amount of blood to be drawn during the course of this study (approximately 57 mL for the 
majority of patients, and 81 mL for patients participating in the intensive PK analysis ) is not 
considered to be a risk to adolescent patients  qualified for enrollment in this study .

Clinically important changes in laboratory tests, vital signs , and ECGs will be presented.  
 
2.5 JUSTIFICATION OF THE STUDY DESIGN  
This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, Phase 2b study evaluating 
plecanatide 8-week treatment in adolescent patients with CIC.  
 Randomization and double -blind components of the study design are used to minimize bias in 
treatment group assignment and investigator/study personnel/patient bias, respectively, during the study. The fixed dose and time on study drug are the most objective ways to assess the therapeutic effect and safety of an investigational agent relative to placebo. The treatment period 
is 8 weeks, which is sufficient time to test the durability of response. 
2.6 P
LANNED SAMPLE SIZE AND NUMBER OF STUDY CENTERS  
Approximately 120 patients (~ 30 patients per treatment group) will be recruited for this study at 
approximately 40 clinical sites in the USA. The patients will be enrolled in this multi- center 
outpatient study by gastroenterologists, internists , and general medicine practitioners who have 
been qualified as Investigat ors.

®, bisacodyl) for more than 2 days during either of the 
two weeks of the 2- week baseline diary assessment.  
19. ≥ 3 SBM per week for either week of the 2- week baseline diary assessment.   
3.3 PREVIOUS AND CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Any medication the patient takes other than the study drug, including herbal and other non-traditional remedies, is considered a concomitant medication.  The following information must 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 26 of 79 May 18, 2017  be recorded in the eCRF for each concomitant medication:  generic name,  route of 
administration, start date, stop date, dosage, and indication.  Any changes in the dose or regimen 
of a concomitant medication must also be recorded in the eCRF.  At the Screening visit, patients will be asked what medications they have taken dur ing the last 30 
days.  At each subsequent study visit, patients will be asked what concomitant medications they are currently taking.  Use of rescue medication will be recorded daily in the BM Diary and should not be included under concomitant medications. 
3.3.1 Permitted Concomitant Medications  
Rescue Medication (RM) – Dulcolax
®  
 
Dulcolax® 5 mg tablets will be dispensed to patients at Visit 1, and re -supplied at the study visits 
as needed. From Visit 1 and for the duration of the trial, only protocol supplied Dulcolax® is to 
be used as the “rescue medication” (laxative) - no other laxatives  are allowed. As per Dulcolax® 
package insert (directions for use), Dulcolax® “may be taken 1 to 2 tablets as a single dose per 
day”.  
 Patients are instructed to take rescue medication only if it has been at least 72 hours since their last bowel movement . A patient is therefore expected to have no more than two days of 
RM use in any given week.   Rescue medication usage will be recorded daily via the electronic diary. Sites will review rescue medication use with patients during their study visits and have the option to discontinue participation of patients who do not adhere to rescue medication guidelines. Patients are advised NOT to take rescue medication for the period from 24 hours before to 72 hours after Day  1 of dosing.  This avoids confounding the dat a collected in the first week of 
study drug administration and allows for accurate determination of the time to first BM.    
Dulcolax
® will be distributed to sites by Sharp Corporation.  Sites may order additional bulk 
supplies of rescue medication by submitting a Dulcolax® Request Form. Supplies of Dulcolax® 
will not be reconciled at the completion of the study.  Sites must track invent ory of rescue 
medication supplies for the purpose of ensuring adequate quantities for re -supplying patients as 
needed.  The site’s supply of rescue medication will not be managed nor automatically re -
supplied. 
3.3.2 Prohibited Prior and Concomitant Medications a nd Supplements  
The following medications, laxatives, and supplements are prohibited within 15 days  prior to 
the Screening visit and for the duration of the study, unless otherwise indicated: 
• Oral anticholinergic agents (topical and inhaled anticholinergics  are allowed)  
• Drugs with activity at the 5 -HT4, 5-HT3, and 5-HT2b receptors 
• Antidiarrheal agents including Pepto Bismol™, kaolin, and opiates 
• Drugs known to cause diarrhea such as orlistat, acarbose, misoprostol, and colchicine 
• Bile acid sequestrants (cholestyramine and colestipol)  
• Amitiza® (lubiprostone) 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 27 of 79 May 18, 2017  • Linzess®/Constella® (linaclotide)  
• Resolor® (prucalopride)Antibiotics, including rifaximin, and opioids, including tramadol or 
opiate antidiarrheals (diphenoxylate, and loperamide) are generally prohibited.  However, 
short-term (<15 days) use of opioids or antibiotics for the treatment of AEs or intercurrent illness may be administered during the Screening Period prior to Visit 2 (Day 1) or after randomization in the study as long as they are reported.  If a patient needs to be started on an antibiotic or a narcotic during the screening period, the patient’s  Visit 2 may be delayed to 
allow  for discontinuation of these medications at least 3 days before randomization. 
 
Prohibited drugs when required and used to treat TEAEs are allowed.  
The following drugs are allowed only if the patient has been on a stable dose for the 8 weeks  
prior to the Screening/Baseline Period and the patient  agrees to remain on this dose for the 
duration of the study. 
• Anticonvulsants 
• Antidepressants  
• Calcium channel blockers 
• Proton pump inhibitors and H 2 antagonists 
• Antihistamines that have primarily anti H1 activity (eg, cetirizine, loratadine, and 
chlorpheniramine) 
• Bulking agents (eg, psyllium [Metamucil®] methylcellulose [Citrucel®], calcium 
polycarbophil) 
Thyroid hormone supplementation: levothyroxine (T4) or natural desiccated thyroid hormone or 
liothyronine (T3) are allowed only if the patient has been on a stable dose for the 30 days prior to the 2 -week Screening/Baseline Period an d remains on this dose for the duration of participation 
in the study.  Prohibited Laxatives 
All laxatives (except for rescue medication as described in the following list) will be prohibited 
from the Screening Visit (Visit 1) and onward for the duration of the study (including 2  weeks 
posttreatment).  This includes the following: 
• Lactulose 
• Stimulant laxatives, including senna (Ex -Lax
®) and sennosides (eg, Senokot®), cascara 
sagrada, anthraquinones, castor oil, aloe, or other 
• Osmotic laxatives (eg, polyethy lene glycol 3350 [MiraLAX®], magnesium hydroxide [Milk 
of Magnesia®], magnesium sulfate [Epsom Salts®] sodium biphosphate [Phospho-Soda®], 
saline laxatives [magnesium citrate], glycerine suppositories, glucitol [Sorbitol®] lactulose)

diphenylmethane laxatives (phenolphthalein). Note:  See rescue medication exception in 
Section  3.3.1 
• Stool softeners (docusate sodium, eg, Colace®) 
 
3.4 DIETARY INTAKE  
A stable dietary intake should be maintained including high fiber diet, fiber supplements, 
vitamins and minerals, probiotics, fish oil, during the study.  Patients must have been on a stable 
dietary regimen for at least 30 days before Visit 1, and are expected to remain on that diet, including all supplements, for the duration of the study. 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 29 of 79 May 18, 2017  4 VARIABLES AND METHODS OF ASSESSMENT 
4.1 DEMOGRAPHICS AND BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS  
4.1.1 Patient Demography 
Patient demography consists of: 
• Age at screening (date of birth)  
• Race  
• Ethnicity  
• Sex (Gender)  
• Height (m), without shoes  
• Weight (kg) and BMI 
BMI will be calculated by measuring the patient’s height (without patient wearing shoes) and 
weight and using these measurements (in meters and kilograms) in the formula:  BMI (kg/m²) = 
weight (kg ) ÷ height² (m²) 
4.1.2 Disease and Medical History  
A complete medical history, including history of GI diseases, should be recorded for all patients.  
Source documentation for diagnoses, previous treatments and interventions, where available, should be included in the patient’s medical record to facilitate source documentation verification.  Confirmation of diagnosis of CIC is required as part of evaluation for this study; if not previously documented in the patient’s medical history, the diagnosis must be included in the patient’s medical record for the purpose of source document verification. 
4.1.3 Previous Medications and Diet  
At the Screening Visit (Visit 1), the clinical site will ensure the patient is not or has not been on 
prohibited medications, supplements or investigational agents during the specified time (see 
Section  3.3.2).  If the patient has used a prohibited medication within the pro scribed time period 
prior to Visit 1, the site needs to assure that the required washout period for the medication is complete d before commencement of the 2 -week baseline diary assessments. Previous 
medications will be documented as described in Section  
3.3. 
 The diet history of each patient will be reviewed at Screening (Visit 1) to determine if the patient has been on a stable diet for the last 30 days, and whether the patient  agrees to remain on that 
diet for the duration of the study.     
4.2 E
FFICACY VARIABLES  
4.2.1 Data  Collected  via the Electronic Diary  
At the Screening Visit (Visit 1), patients will be instructed on the use of the electronic diary and 
the importance of daily diary reports. Episodic or “real time” calls should be made a t the time of 
each bowel movement or use of rescue medication during the course of the day. End of Day calls 
should be made only once per day (between 7 pm to 11:59 pm each day). Patients will begin  
using the electronic diary following training at Visit 1 and will continue using it through 
the Posttreatment Period .  
  
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 30 of 79 May 18, 2017  The electronic diary will be activated at the Screening Visit (Visit 1) in order for the patient to 
become familiar with its daily use to record their BMs, rescue medication intake and constip ation 
symptoms.  Note that any data entered prior to the beginning of the 2 -week baseline diary 
assessment will be utilized for assessment of compliance only and will not be saved. The electronic diary is designed for:  
 
• Episodic reporting  of each bowel movement (BM) and rescue medication (RM) use in 
“real -time” as they occur throughout a 24 -hour period (Patients may report BMs and RM use 
as often as necessary);  
• End-of-Day daily reporting constipation- related symptoms (and BM/RM if not already 
reported as an  ‘episodic report’) at a specific time each evening.   Patients who have not 
completed the prompted evening call will receive an automated reminder (via phone) each 
evening . 
 
To remain eligible for the study, patients must complete at least 5 of the 7 days of electronic End-of-Day diary entries for each of the 2 weeks of Baseline diary period.  
 Compliance with diary entries should be a focus for patient education at all study visits.  
 The following endpoints will be assessed using data collected via the electronic diary : 
 Frequency and Completeness of Bowel Movements  
Patie nts will be asked to report in “real time”  the numbers of BMs they experienced each day, 
the time of each BM, and the completeness of evacuation in the daily BM Diary.  Frequency of BMs is one aspect of the primary endpoint for evaluation of study drug efficacy.  
 Stool Consistency—Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS)  
Patients will be asked to rate their stool consistency according to the BSFS (see Appendix  C), 
which will be provided to them in the form of a lamin ated card (and will appear on the 
appropriate electronic hand -held device  screen ) at the Screening Visit (Visit 1), and may be 
referred to as often as necessary throughout the  Screening, Treatment and Postt reatment Periods.  
The BSFS is a validated measure of stool consistency commonly used in clinical trials.  
 Use of Rescue Medication (RM)   
As part of the daily diary, the patient will be questioned concerning the use of provided rescue medication (Dulcolax
®), including time of use, frequency of use, and amount of rescue 
medication used.  Use of rescue medication will determine whether a BM was spontaneous, but only this aspect of rescue medication use is part of the primary endpoint.  Constipation-related Symptoms 
The patient will also record in the electronic diary the frequency and severity of several CIC -
related gastrointestinal symptoms . These symptoms include abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, 
abdominal discomfort, straining during bowel movement and pain with defecation.  Patients will 
be asked to rate their symptoms on an 11-point Numeric Rating Scale from 0 (NO) to 10 
(WORST POSSIBLE)  (See Appendi x D).

Final Version 4.0 Page 31 of 79 May 18, 2017  4.2.2 Variables Assessed by Questionnaires Administered at the Study Site  
NOTE:  S tandard def initions  for flatulence and  fecal incontinence will be included in the 
study procedure manual   
Excessive Flatulence  
Excessive flatulence ( NOTE:  the term “excessive” is meant  to be interpreted by each patien t in 
terms of what he/she perceives as “more than normal” either for him or herself or as compa red to 
his peers/friends ) will be assessed via the IWRS at each study visit.  Patients will be asked to rate 
their “excessive flatulence” using the IWRS on a scale from 0 to 4, where 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = 
moderate, 3 = severe, and 4 = very severe.  
Fecal Incontinence  
The following question will be asked at ea ch study visit using th e IWRS a s follows: 
Visit 1 : 
Have you ever experienced fecal incontinence?   YES  NO 
If YES, Approximately how many episodes of fecal incontinence did you experience over the 
last two weeks?  
0                1                2                  3                    more than 3 
 
Visits 2 through 5: 
Approximately how many episodes of fecal incontinence did you experience over the last two 
weeks?  
0                1                2                  3                    more than 3 
 Three standardized patient questionnaires (see Appendix  E) will also be administered during the 
scheduled study site visits to assess the severity of constipation and impact of the disease on the 
patient’s quality of life.  
 Patient Assessment of Constipation—Symptoms (PAC -SYM)  
The PAC -SYM is a previously validated questionnaire  which is made up of 12 questions 
addressing specific symptoms of constipation.  The patient will be asked to rate each symptom on a scale of 0  (“absent”) to 4 (“very severe”).  
Patient Assessment of Constipation —Quality of Life (PAC -QOL)  
The PAC -QOL is a previously validated questionnaire is made up of 28 questions which assess 
how the patient has been impacted by constipation over the specified period.  The questions measur e worries and concerns, physical discomfort, psychosocial discomfort, satisfaction, and 
overall effects on the patient’s quality of life.  Patients will be asked to give their response on a scale of 0 (“not at all” or “none of the time”) to 4 (“extremely” or “all of the time”).

4.3 SAFETY VARIABLES  
4.3.1 Collection of Adverse Events  
It is the responsibility of the Investigator to ensure that all AEs are collected.  This includes both 
serious and non- serious AEs derived by spontaneous, unsolicited reports of patients, by 
observation, and by routine open questionings e.g., “How have you felt since I last saw you?”  
NOTE:  Specific GI symptoms are recorded daily in the GI symptom diary (abdominal bloating, 
abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort , straining with a bowel movement and pain with 
defecation ) in response to standardized questions. The frequency and severity ratings recorded 
for these symptoms  are both an efficacy and safety record and therefore these events should 
generally NOT be recorded elsewhere as adverse events.  
For Definitions, Assessments of AEs, Causality, Severity, Recording and Reporting of Adverse Events and Follow Up, see Section  7. 
4.3.2 Laboratory Variables 
Laboratory assessments will be performed by a central laboratory, as identified in the  List of 
Study Personnel.  Please see the Laboratory Manual for detailed instructions regarding the 
collection, processing, and handling of laboratory samples. 
The laboratory variables presented in Table 1 will be assessed in accordance with the Schedule 
of Assessments ( Table 2).  Routine laboratory tests (serum chemistry [including electrolytes], 
hematology, and urinalysis) will be performed at each study  visit, from Screening to 
Postt reatment.  A 6- to 12- hour fast is advised for Visit 1 and is highly recommended prior to all 
visits when blood sampling is scheduled. The timing of other safety tests (e.g., pregnancy tests 
and drug screen) is presented in the Schedule of Assessments ( Table 2).  
   
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 33 of 79 May 18, 2017  Table  1 Laboratory Assessments  
Hematology:  Erythrocytes, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), 
neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, platelets, leukocytes, 
hemoglobin, and hematocrit  
Urinalysis:  Specific gravity, pH, protein, glucose, ketones, blood, and microscopic examination of 
sediment  
Serum chemistry:  Alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, total 
bilirubin, direct bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, total protein, albumin, uric acid, glucose , and 
cholesterol.  
Hormone:  TSH at screening to determine eligibility (T3 and  free T4 if TSH is out of range)  
Electrolytes:  Sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, phosphorus, calcium  
Pregnancy test:  Urine pregnancy tests via dip sticks (performed on -site) 
Immunogenicity : Anti-plecanatide antibody serum assessment  
PK: Plecanatide (and SP -338) plasma assessment  
Urine screen for 
select opioids :  Methadone, morphine,  and oxycodone.  
At Screening, any laboratory abnormality considered clinically significant by the Investigator or 
the Medical Monitor will render the patient ineligible for study enrollment.  
Approximately 2.0 mL of blood will be drawn for each hematology sample and approximately 
5.0 mL of blood will be drawn for each serum chemistry sample.  The volume of blood that will 
be required for these laboratory tests  during the duration of the study, not including possible 
repeat tests, will be approximately 28  mL. 
4.3.3 Immunogenicity and Pharmacokinetic (PK) Assessments  
Approximately 3.5 mL of blood for immunogenicity testing – measurement of serum 
concentration of anti-plecanatide antibodies, will be collected (and banked) from all patients, as 
specified in the Schedule of Assessments. The total volume of blood required for 
immunogenicity testing during the study will be approximately 11  mL.  
Blood samples (6 mL each) for measurement of plecanatide and SP -338 concentration will be 
collected from all patients on Day 1 of the Treatment Period (15 min prior to dosing) and at the 
Week 4 and Week 8 visits. Intensive sampling for formal  PK analysis will be conducted in a 
subgroup of approximately 40 patients (10 patients per each treatment group) who consent to the additional blood sampling at 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes following study drug administration on 
Day 1 of treatment.  The actual sampling times will be recorded on the eCRF for each PK 
sample. The total blood volume collected for PK analysis will be about 18 mL for the majority of 
patients, and 42 mL for patients participating in the intensive PK analysis. Only samples from patients randomized to active treatment will be analyzed.  
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 34 of 79 May 18, 2017  Orally delivered plecanatide is not absorbed in the adult population nor is it expected to be 
absorbed in the 12 to <18- year-old age group.  However, should any measurable levels of 
plecanatide or its primary metabolite (SP -338) be observed, to the extent possible, 
pharmacokinetic parameter estimates (C max, C min, tmax) will be undertaken.  Nominal sampling 
time will be used for all parameter estimation.  
In order to maintain the double -blind status of the study, results of the pharmacokinet ic assay 
will be blinded to the investigators , to the sponsor, and monitors during the course of the study.  
The procedure for the collection, handling, storage, and shipment of the samples for PK and 
immunogenicity analysis are specified in  the site reference laboratory manual.  
4.3.4 Vital Signs  
The following vital signs will be assessed in accordance with the Schedule of Assessments (Table 2).  Measurements should be performed after the patient has been seated for at least 
5 minutes.  A clinically significant abnormality at screening may result in the patient being 
excluded from the study. 
• Blood pressure (systolic and diastolic; mmHg)  
• Heart rate (beats per minute)  
• Oral body temperature (°C)  
• Respiration rate (breaths per minute)  
4.3.5 Electrocardiograms  
Standard 12- lead ECGs will be performed in accordance with the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2).  A clinically significant abnormality at Screening, as determined by the PI, will result 
in the patient being excluded from the study. 
4.3.6 Physical Examinations 
Physical examinations (PEs) will be performed in accordance with the Schedule of Assessments 
(Table 2).  A clinically significant abnormality at Screening may result in the patient being 
excluded from the study. The PE will be based on the following body systems:  general appearance, head (ear, eyes, nose, 
and throat), cardiovascular, respiratory system, abdomen, musculoskeletal, neurological, lymph nodes, and skin.   
Neither a urogenital exam nor a digital rectal examination is required for the study but should 
take place at Screening if the Investigator feels that there may be a confounding factor for 
constipation symptoms e.g., anal pathology, or a rectocele in a female patient.  
NOTE:  The presence of other alarm symptoms (lower GI bleeding, iron- deficiency anemia, 
unexplained clinically -significant weight loss and systemic signs of infection or colitis) preclude 
patient eligibility for this trial, unless the PI has adequately assessed each alarm symptom and 
has discussed their medical relevance with the Medical Monitor, including the potential need for 
colonoscopic evaluation of the symptoms.

Final Version 4.0 Page 35 of 79 May 18, 2017  Height will be measured at the Screening Visit only .  Weight will be measured as part of all 
physical examinations; the same calibrated scale should be used for each measurement .  BMI 
calculation will use the height and weight recorded at Visit 1 (Screening Visit).      
4.3.7 Concomitant Medications and Diet  
Conc omitant medications or supplements will be reviewed and documented at each study visit to 
ensure prohibited/restricted substances are not being taken. Concomitant medication will be 
documented as described in Section 3.3. 
Drugs required to be at a stable dose prior to screening including thyroid hormone replacement 
(30-day stabilization) should not be initiated or dose adjusted during the study.   
Diet will be reviewed at each study visit to ensure that each patient is maintaining an acceptable and stable diet throughout the study.  Any change in diet considered clinically significant by the Investigator will be documented in the eCRF.   
4.3.8 Rescue Medi cation 
Use of rescue medication will be reported in the electronic diary.  Patients will be instructed to 
take rescue medication only if 72 hours have elapsed since their last BM and reminded of this instruction at each visit.

Final Version 4.0 Page 38 of 79 May 18, 2017  5.2 PROCEDURES BY VISIT 
5.2.1 Visit 1: Screening (Day -28) 
Patients are often pre -screened for the study. Pre -screening information is generally obtained 
through customary practice of routine medical intake for the patients. Of note, patients who have 
completed pre -screening are not pre -qualified for participation in the study, therefore the site is 
still responsible for completing all required screening assessments in accordance with  the study 
protocol. 
The patient must be screened, ideally, within 28 days before the randomization visit in the study.  
A 3-day window is allowed to complete the Day 1 visit.  The last 14 days prior to randomization 
will be used as the patient’s baseline electronic diary assessment.  
The following will be completed at the Screening Visit:  
• Obtain informed consent/assent.  The patient must provide written assent and parent or 
caregiver must provide written informed consent.  
• Assign a unique patient number.  Unique patient numbers will begin with the clinical site 
number, eg, 001 followed by a 3- digit number.  Unique patient numbers will be assigned 
sequentially by clinical site personnel accessing the EDC system.  This unique patient 
number will be kept for the duration of the study.  Patients who discontinue from the study 
before randomization will retain their unique patient number (ie, numbers from screen fail 
patients will NO T be reassigned). 
• Assess willingness and ability to maintain a stable diet and fiber supplements (if applicable) 
for the study period and to comply with not using laxatives with the exception of the rescue 
medication provided as part of the study. 
• Determine eligibility, based on Rome  III criteria for child/adolescent functional constipation 
(Appendix  A) 
• Verify inclusion/exclusion criteria.  
• Collect demographic information.  
• Record medical history, including GI and bowel habit history. 
• Record prior and concomitant medications and dietary history. 
• Perform a physical examination, including measurement of body weight and height.  
• Measure vital signs (seated blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, and body temperature). 
• Perform  urine screen for opioids (see Section 4.3.2 for details).  
• Perform a urine pregnancy test for female patients (a negative result must be confirmed at 
Screening and on Day 1 prior to randomization). 
• Collect blood and urine samples for safety laboratory tests (serum chemistry, including 
thyroid -stimulating hormone [TSH], hematology, and urinalysis). 
• Perform 12 -lead ECG in the semi-recumbent position. 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 39 of 79 May 18, 2017  • Have the patient complete the Excessive Flatule nce and Fecal Incontinence questionnaires 
(Per Study Procedure Manual). 
• Train patients how to use the electronic diary to record their responses about BM and CIC -
related symptoms and activate the diary.  
• Distribute a laminated card with the BSFS to patients  and explain how to use it to record 
stool consistency in their daily electronic diaries.    
• Ensure patients understand the importance of entering data in their diaries on daily basis for 
all questions. 
• Dispense rescue medication to patients and instruct them on the appropriate use. 
Patients who fail to qualify for randomization during the Screening Period will be considered 
Screen Failures and the reason for failure will be documented.  
Patients who screen -failed may be allowed to re -screen under certain circumstances upon review  
and approval by the Medical Monitor. 
5.2.2 Visit  2:  Randomization / Day  1 of Treatment Period  
Study eligibility must be confirmed prior to randomization, including the following: 
• Confirm that patient has used only study -supplied rescue  medication laxative (Dulcolax®) 
since Visit 1  
• Urine drug screen (see Section  4.3.2 for details)  
• Urine pregnancy test, if applicable 
• Update medical history and concomitant medications, as necessary 
The last 14 days of daily diary entries prior to randomization will be used for determination of 
baseline data.  Only patients who meet the protocol criteria for confirmation of CIC and 
demonstrate diary and RM compliance are eligible for randomization.  This eligibility 
determination will include: 
• A review of the baseline diary en tries to ensure patients have completed at least 5 of the 7 
days of diary entries in each of the 2 weeks of baseline assessments  
• A review of the BM frequency data to ensure < 3 SBMs in each of the 2 weeks of the 
baseline diary assessment period  
• A review o f rescue medication use to ensure patients have not used RM for more than 2 days 
in each baseline week  
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 40 of 79 May 18, 2017  The eligibility determination based on these criteria will be programmed into the IWRS and the

Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 42 of 79 May 18, 2017  5.2.6 Early Withdrawal Visit  (EW) 
Patients are free to withdraw from participation in the study at any time.  Investigators may 
choose to discontinue a patient’s participation in the study if they believe it is in the patient’s best interest clinically.  If a patient’s post- randomization compliance is of concern, contact the 
medical monitor to discuss.  If the patient has an intervening illness that requires discontinuation of study participation, the patient and Investigator will follow procedures for early withdrawal.  The following are examples of AEs that qualify for Ear ly Withdrawal (EW): 
• A positive pregnancy test will require discontinuation from the study (see Section  7.7).  
• Changes in laboratory values, PE findings , or other assessments considered by the 
Investigator (or designee) to be clinically significant will require discontinuation from the 
study. 
• Clinically significant TEAEs , including clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities or 
SAEs regardless of relatedness to study treatment that  cause the patient, investigator , or 
Sponsor to feel it is not in the patient’s best interest to continue. 
 
A patient may also be withdrawn from study drug/study by the Sponsor, regulatory authorities, 
or the institutional review board (IRB).  Patients will also be withdrawn if the entire study is 
terminated prematurely as described in Section  9.10. 
Patients who discontinue early from the study should, if possible, have an E arly Withdrawal  
Visit.  The Investigator must make every effort (with proper documentation) to have the patient complete this final visit.  This visit should take place as soon as possible (and within 5 days) 
after the patient stops taking study drug.  
The following proce dures will be performe d at the Early Withdrawal Visit: 
• Collect/record unused study drug from the supply dispensed at the previous visit 
• Review the electronic diary compliance repo rts and  re-emphasize the need for diary 
compliance, as necessary  
• Have the pat ient complete the PRO questionnaires ( see Study Procedure Manual)  
• Assess/record changes in concomitant medications and diet  
• Physical examination (including body weight) and vital signs (seated blood pressure, heart rate, respiration , and body temperature) 
• 12-lead ECG (semi -recumbent)  
• Safety laboratory assessments (hematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis)  
• Perform u rine pregnancy test, if applicable  
• Collect blood samples for plecanatide/SP -338 and immunogenicity assessments  
• Assess adverse events.  
• Distribute a dditional rescue medication (Dulcolax
® tablets), if needed  
In all cases, a single,  primary reason for withdrawal must be recorded on the eCRF . 
The End of Study assessments should be performed 2 weeks following the last study drug administration.   Patients withdrawn after randomization will not be replaced.

Final Version 4.0 Page 43 of 79 May 18, 2017  6 STUDY DRUG  
6.1 IDENTITY  OF PLECANATIDE AND PLACEBO  
Plecanatide is a synthetic hexadecapeptide that is an analog (identical , with the exception of a 
single amino acid) of uroguanylin, a natural hormone. The chemical name, molecular formula, 
molecular weight, and amino acid sequence of plecanatide can be found in the IB provided to each clinical site.   
The drug product is a tablet comprised of plecanatide, microcrystalline cellulose, and magnesium stearate.  Matching placebo composition is identical but does not contain plecanatide.  Both 
plecanatide and placebo tablets are manufactured by UPM Pharmaceuticals (Bristol, TN) and packaged by Sharp Packaging Solutions (Allentown, PA).  Study supplies will be retested as 
required by the sponsor. 
6.2 A
DMINISTRATION  
Study drug will be administered for 8 consecutive weeks according to the randomization scheme 
displayed in Table 3 . Each patient will take one tablet orally (by mouth) daily  preferably at the 
same time each day —in the morning —with approximately 240 mL (~8 oz.) of liquid, with or 
without food. 
No dose adjustments will be allowed on this study. 
Table 3 Treatment Arms  
Table 3: Treatment Arms  
Treatment Arm  Treatment  Number of Patients  
1 0.5 mg plecanatide 30 
2 1.0 mg plecanatide 30 
3 1.5 mg plecanatide 30 
4 Matching placebo  30 
  
Overdose  
Plecanatide has minimal systemic absorption, therefore standard treatment measures for the 
symptomatology being exhibited should be provided.  Notable, plecanatide was generally well -
tolerated after single doses up to 48.6 mg and multiple doses up to 9.0 mg for 12 weeks in prior 
studies. 
Individual Patient Stopping Criteria  
Adverse events due to study drug that affect individual patient safety may necessitate dose 
interruptions or early discontinuation as described in this section.   
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 44 of 79 May 18, 2017  Plecanatide therapy in adults with CIC has caused diarrhea in 5% of patients with severe diarrhea 
occurring in 0.6% of patients.  Severe diarrhea may cause dehydration.  Pediatric patients may be 
at increased risk for diarrhea and dehydration with plecanatide therapy.  
In general , study drug dosing should not be modified for mild diarrhea (Grade 1: increase of <4 
stools per day over baseline) or mild dehydration (Grade 1: dry mucous membranes, diminished skin turgor)  (Guidance for Industry, FDA, 2007).  If study drug is not well tolerated by an 
individual patient, treatment will be permanently discontinued for that patient.   
The following guidelines should be used in the case of moderate or severe diarrhea or dehydration: 
Table 4 Individual Patient Stopping Criteria  
 
Worst Observed Toxicity Grade  
(Guidance fo r Industry, FDA, 2007 ) Dose Modification for Study Drug  
Diarrhea   
Grade 2: Increase of 4 -6 stools per day over 
baseline  No intervention required  
Grade 3: Increase of ≥7 stools per day over 
baseline,  incontinence, hospitalization 
indicated  Interrupt study drug for <7 days until resolved 
to less than Grade 2 severity. If diarrhea was 
study drug -related, permanently discontinue 
study drug.  If diarrhea was not study drug -
related, eg, viral gastroenteritis, then consider resuming treatment afte
r consultation with 
Sponsor’s Medical Monitor  
Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences, 
urgent intervention indicated  Permanently discontinue study drug  
Dehydration   
Grade 2: IV fluids indicated <24 hour  Interrupt study drug for <7 days until resolved 
to less than Grade 2 severity. If dehydration 
was study drug- related, permanently 
discontinue study drug.  If dehydration was 
not study drug- related, consider resuming 
treatment after consultation with Sponsor’s 
Medical Monitor  
Grade 3: IV fluids or hospitalization indicated  Permanently discontinue study drug  
Grade 4: Life -threatening consequences, 
urgent intervention indicated  Permanently discontinue study drug  
 
Study Stopping Criteria  
Dosing of all patients in the study will be interrupted for at least one week if ≥2 patients 
receiving study drug develop drug -related Grade 3 diarrhea and/or dehydration or if one patient 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 45 of 79 May 18, 2017  develops drug- related Grade 4 diarrhea and/or dehydration.  This will allow the Sponsor  to 
assess whether the trial should be stopped or modified. 
6.3 PACKAGING , LABELING AND STORAGE  
All study centers will be provided with adequate supplies of study medication —plecanatide 
tablets at 3 dose strengths ( see Table 3 ) and identically appearing placebo tablets, by Sharp 
Corporation.   
6.3.1 Packaging 
Each investigational drug kit will contain a 4 -week supply in blister packaging —a total of 32 
tablets, including 4 extra tablets to allow for a 3 -day window extension for a study  visit. 
Individually blister packaged tablets will be provided in four connected strips (each per 1 week) 
as a 4 -panel key -pack that folds into a carton. The two bottom panels fold up into the two top 
panels, nesting blister cavities. Instructions for rele asing a tablet from the blister dome are 
printed on the outside of the carton. 
At each dispensing visit, each patient will be given a numbered drug kit corresponding to the 
treatment group into which the patient was randomized. At the randomization visit ( Day 1 of the 
Treatment Period), the eligible patient will receive one drug kit for the first 4 weeks of dosing (weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4).  At the Week 4 Visit, the patient will receive a new drug kit for their weeks 5, 6, 7 and 8 of dosing.  Patients are instr ucted to bring their kits at the following study visit to 
allow for determination of compliance and reconciliation of supplies.  
Save all empty packaging or packaging containing unused tablets for final disposition by the 
sponsor or contract pharmacy . 
6.3.2 Label 
Each of the investigational drug kits will have a unique label containing the following information:  protocol number, drug kit number, contents, directions for use, storage conditions, 
Sponsor name, address  and the statements:  “Caution:  New Drug - Limited by Federal Law to 
Investigational use.  Investigational Drug – To be used by Qualified Investigator Only.  For 
Clinical Trial Use Only. Keep Out of Reach of Children under the age of 12”.  
The label will include the following fields to be completed by  site personnel:  Investigator name 
and phone number, patient number and treatment weeks.  When dispensing a kit to a patient, 
complete and remove the tear off portion of the label and keep this in the source documents. At each monitoring visit, the source  document records will be verified against the IWRS 
assignment.  
There will also be a smaller label on the carton spine that identifies the study number and drug kit number and Sponsor. 
6.3.3 Storage 
The Investigator, or qualified designee, is responsible for the  proper storage of the study 
medications according to the Sponsor’s recommendations and all applicable federal/state 
regulatory guidelines.  At the clinical site, plecanatide should be stored at controlled room 
temperature 20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F) in a secure area with Min / Max Temperature Recording 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 46 of 79 May 18, 2017  with restricted access .  Deviations from Sponsors recommendations / guidelines should be 
reported, as directed in the Site Level Temperature Excurs ion Reporting Form. 
Patients will be instructed to store their study drug at  room temperature defined for this study as 
20 to 25°C (68 to 77°F). 
The Investigator must agree not to dispense or store the investigational drug at any location other 
than that listed on the Form FDA 1572. 
6.4 BLINDING AND BREAKING THE BLIND  
The study will be performed in a double -blind manner.  All study drugs will be supplied in 
identical blister packs and tablets will be similar in color, smell, taste, and appearance, thereby 
assur ing double-blind conditions. 
In the event of a need to break the blind, the Investigator at the clinical site will have the ability to break the treatment code using the IWRS.  The blind should only be broken following discussion on a case -by-case basis, w ith the Sponsor/Medical Monitor (except in a medical 
emergency ). The Sponsor’s Medical Monitor will also be granted emergency code -break 
privileges using the IWRS.  All telephone calls resulting in an un- blinding event will be 
documented.  The Sponsor and CRO, as applicable, will specify who in each company is able to review unblinded treatment in a blinded trial. 
In the event of a treatment code -break, the time, date, reason, name , and signature of the person 
responsible for breaking the code must be fully  documented in the patient’s source documents 
and any associated AE recorded.  The breaking of the blind will result in the withdrawal of the 
patient from study participation, and the patient should follow the procedures detailed for Early Withdrawal Visit study assessment (see Section  5.2.6).  
The overall randomization code for the study will be broken at study completion.  This will occur once all final clinical data have been entered into the database, data queries have been resolved, and the assignment of patients to the analysis sets has been completed.  
6.5 D
RUG ACCOUNTABILITY  
Acknowledgement of receipt of drug shipments and distribution of all investigational drug kits will be recorded using the IWRS.  The drug inventory log can be generated from IWRS at the 
site level as a standard report.  
In addition, accurate records of study drug dispensed to patients will be kept by the Investigator, or qualified designee, specifying the kit number, the patient number assigned, and the amount dispensed to each patient and the date dispensed.  This information will be available in the IWRS and the drug accountability log for the overall study.  At each visit after Visit  X, the patient is 
asked to return their previously dispensed drug kit and the number of remaining tablets is entered into the eCRF for drug accountability. 
A blinded drug accountability log can also be generated from IWRS and must be available for 
inspection at each monitoring visit and at the completion of the study.  At the completion of the 
study, the Investigator will provide copies of this accountability log to the Sponsor. 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 47 of 79 May 18, 2017  The Investigator is responsible for assuring the retrieval of all study supplies from patients.  At 
the completion of the study, all unused investigational drug kits will be returned to a third party in accordance with the Sponsor’s (or designee’s) written instructions.  The Investigator must verify that all unused or partially used study drug supplies have been returned by the patient and that no remain ing supplies are in the Investigator’s possession. 
6.6 C
OMPLIANCE  
Patients will be advised as to how to take their daily medication and will return all unused study 
drug to the clinical site at each visit during the Treatment Period.  The number of remaining 
tablets will be counted and entered into the appropriate eCRF page for that patient.  Patients 
unwilling or unable to maintain compliance with study drug administration or procedures may be 
discontinued from the study at the discretion of the investigator in conjunction with the medical monitor.

Final Version 4.0 Page 48 of 79 May 18, 2017  7 ASSESSMENT, REPORTING, RECORDING AND FOLLOW UP OF 
ADVERSE EVENTS 
7.1 DEFINITION  
An AE is any untoward medical occurrence associated with the use of a drug in humans, whether 
or not considered to be drug related.  An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of an investigational product or study procedure whether or not considered related to the product or procedure.  
NOTE:  Specific gastrointestinal symptoms related to CIC are recorded daily in the electronic Diary in response to standardized questions, and are BOTH efficacy AND safety response variables.  These symptoms are abdominal bloating, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, 
straining with bowel movement and pain with defecation.  The diary is a “real -time” patient 
reported outcome record that is based on “within 24 hours” patient recall.  Because these symptoms are considered adequately recorded in the CIC S ymptom Diary, they should generally 
not also be reported in the adverse event database that relies on a much longer patient recall period.    In order to prevent double -recording of a single specific event, the daily CIC Symptom 
Diary record is considered the highest quality record of an event and should therefore be the only record of the same event.  
All AEs, including intercurrent illnesses and regardless of the source of identification (e.g., physical examination, laboratory assessment, electrocardiogram  (ECG), reported by patient), 
occurring during the study will be documented in the eCRF.  Concomitant illnesses that existed before entry into the study will not be considered AEs unless they worsen during the treatment period. 
Adverse events occurring fro m the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF) up to the 
intake of the first dose of study medication will be classified as pre -existing conditions for the 
study and therefore will be recorded in the Medical History page of the electronic case repor t 
form (eCRF).  Serious adverse events (as defined below) occurring after the signing of informed 
consent but before randomization (i.e., during screening) will be collected and reported as such.  A treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that begins or worsens in 
frequency and/or severity after at least one dose of study drug has been administered.  
Minor fluctuations in laboratory values for standard monitoring (abnormal values) that the investigator does not consider clinically significant or related to study drug will not be recorded as AEs.  However, if the laboratory abnormality is associated with a diagnosis, then the AE term for that diagnosis will be reported. 
7.2 E
VENT OF SPECIAL INTEREST – DIARRHEA  
An increase in the frequency of BMs and loosening of the stool consistency from baseline are 
expected pharmacodynamic effects of plecanatide.  These same attributes (increased stool frequency and looser stool consistency) are often used to define “diarrhea’; however, in light of significant inter -patient variability in bowel habit “phenotype” and wide differences in the 
perception of a “normal” bowel habit there is no standard definition of “diarrhea” for this patient population.  An increase in frequency or consistency for one person is a welcome event while for another patient it might be bothersome “diarrhea”.  In all cases, as mentioned in the NOTE 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 49 of 79 May 18, 2017  above, the frequency and consistency of each bowel movement is recorded in the electronic 
diary. However, t his objective record often does not go far enough to characterize any change in 
bowel frequency or consistency as clinically important or impactful for the patient (whether beneficial or harmful).  
One mechanism to introduce a level of consistency across pa tients, sites and the trial is to code 
an event as diarrhea only if it is characterized by a specific patient -reported and clinically 
relevant attribute such as “bothersomeness”.  Therefore, for this trial, for any event associated with a significant incre ase from baseline in BM frequency and/or loosening of BM consistency -  
that would otherwise be coded as diarrhea - the site is instructed to record it as an AE only if the 
patient reports that it was bothersome (as defined by each patient ). 
7.3 A
SSESSMENT OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
Each AE will be assessed by the Investigator with regard to the following categories.  
7.3.1 Seriousness  
An SAE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose is one of the following: 
• Results in death  
• Is life threatening (an adverse event or suspected adverse reaction is considered “life 
threatening” if, in the view of either the investigator or sponsor, its occurrence places the 
patient or subject at immediate risk of death.  It does not include an adverse event or suspected adverse  reaction that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death)  
• Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization  
• Results in a persistent or significant incapacity or substantial disruption of the ability to conduct normal life functions 
• Is a congenital anomaly or birth defect  
• Is a medically important event (examples of such medical events include allergic 
bronchospasm requiring intensive treatment in an emergency room or at home, blood 
dyscrasias or convulsions that do not result in inpatient hospitalization, or the development of drug dependency or drug abuse) 
 
The FDA has recently defined additional “Medically Important Events” that should also be 
reported as SAEs (Guidance for Industry, FDA, July 2009).  Th ese include cases where:  
• Aminotransferases (ALT or AST) are > 3 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) with an associated elevation of total bilirubin > 2 times ULN without evidence of hemolysis or with alkaline phosphatase < 2 times ULN or not available, o r 
• ALT or AST activity that is > 5 times ULN  
All subjects with the above abnormalities should return as soon as possible or within 48 hours to the site for further evaluation of the abnormalities, including repeat ALT and AST measurements; total and direct bilirubin; alkaline phosphatase; and related laboratory 
assessments of albumin, PT and PTT, creatinine kinase, and GGTP or 5’nucleotidase.  Hepatitis A, B, and C, hemolysis, and biliary obstruction should be ruled out.  A detailed medical and drug 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 50 of 79 May 18, 2017  use history should be taken to exclude all potential causes.  All such laboratory tests should be 
performed locally if they are not listed in Section  4.3.2; Table 1 . 
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether a case is serious and whether expedited reporting is appropriate as in the exampl e above for “ Medically Important 
Event .”  The medical monitor should be consulted. 
7.3.2 Intensity (Severity)  
Investigators should assess the severity of AEs according to the following general categorical 
descriptors: 
Mild:  Asymptomatic or mild symptoms; clinical or diagnostic observations only; 
intervention not indicated 
Moderate:  Minimal, local, or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age 
appropriate instrumental activities of daily living (ADL) (instrumental ADL 
includes preparing meals, shopping for groceries or clothes, using the 
telephone, managing money, etc.) 
Severe:  Medically significant but not immediately life -threatening; hospitalization 
or prolongation of hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -care 
ADL (self -care AD L includes bathing, dressing and undressing, feeding 
self, using the toilet, taking medications, and not bedridden) 
It is important to distinguish between serious and severe AEs.  Severity is a measure of intensity, 
whereas seriousness is a regulatory def inition  as per Section 7.3.1.  An AE of severe intensity 
may not necessarily be considered serious (by definition) or a mild AE (mild stroke) may be considered an SAE. 
7.3.3 Causality 
The investigator will assess the causality/relationship between the study drug, or study 
procedure, and the AE and record that assessment in the eCRF.  
The causal relationship of the AE to study drug will be described in terms of: 
Reasonable Possibility:  There is evidence to suggest a caus al relationship between 
the drug and the AE (e.g., the AE is uncommon and known 
to be strongly associated with drug exposure or is uncommon 
in the study population but not commonly associated with 
drug exposure)  
No Reasonable Possibility:  There is no evidence to suggest a causal relationship between 
the drug and the AE  
The study conduct relatedness for AEs and SAEs will also be assessed and documented.  The 
most likely cause of an AE or SAE (e.g., disease under treatment, concomitant disease, 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 51 of 79 May 18, 2017  concomit ant medication, other) will be indicated in the eCRF system with details of the 
concomitant disease or medication or other cause.  
7.4 RECORDING ADVERSE EVENTS  
Adverse event assessment and reporting will extend from signing of ICF until completion of the 
final visit (End of the Posttreatment Period).  Adverse events occurring from the time of ICF 
signing up to the intake of the first dose of study medication will be classified as pre -existing 
conditions for this study and therefore will be recorded in the Medica l History page of the eCRF. 
If, however, an event is considered a Serious Adverse Event (as defined below), and occurs after the signing of informed consent but before randomization (i.e., during screening), this will be collected and reported as non -treatment -emergent Serious Adverse Events, and will be recorded 
in the Adverse Event page of the eCRF. Events that occur from time of first dose of study drug until completion of the final study visit will be considered Treatment- Emergent Adverse Events, 
and recorded on the AE page of the eCRF. Adverse events occurring after the end of the study should be reported to the Sponsor by the Investigator only if the event meets at least one  
seriousness criterion and the Investigator considers the causal relationship to the study drug as ‘reasonably possible’.  
All AE reports should contain a brief description of the event, date of onset, date  of resolution, intensity, treatment required, relationship to study drug, action taken with the study drug, outcome, and whethe r the event is classified as serious.  
All AEs experienced by patients who are randomized to treatment, regardless of the relationship to study drug, will be recorded in the eCRF.  For patients who are screen failures, only SAEs (if any) will be reported  on the AE page of the eCRF.  
7.5  REPORTING SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS  
All SAEs that occur during the study, as defined by the protocol, must be reported by the Investigator to the designated SAE Safety Contact by submitting ( faxing or emailing) the SAE 
Form within 24 hours  from the point in time when the Investigator becomes aware of the SAE. 
In addition, all SAEs including any deaths, which occur up to and including 30 days after the administration of the last dose of the study medication, must be reported to the designated Safety Contact within 24 hours.    
All SAEs will be collected and reported from signing of informed consent/assent until the end of the study.  All SAEs that occur from signing of the ICF/assent to 30 days after the last dose of 
study medication m ust be reported whether or not considered causally related to the study 
medication.  Any SAE that occurs beyond 30 days after last dose of study medication must be 
reported to the designated safety contact only if the event is  considered (in the opinion of  the 
Investigator) causally related to the study drug.  
SAE forms will be provided to each clinical site.  The information collected will include a minimum of the following: protocol number, Investigator information, patient number, event term, a narrative description of the event including its start date, and an assessment by the 
Investigator as to the intensity and possible relatedness to study medication.  A sample of the SAE form can be found in the study manual. The Medical Monitor or Synergy may reques t 
follow up information regarding the SAE. 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 52 of 79 May 18, 2017  The Investigator will prepare or directly oversee preparation of each SAE report and the Medical 
Monitor will evaluate and confirm the seriousness and the causal relationship of the event to study treatment. In ad dition, the Investigator and Medical Monitor will evaluate the expectedness 
according to the reference document (Investigator Brochure).  Based on the Medical Monitor’s and Sponsor’s assessment of the event, a decision will be made concerning the need for further 
action.  
The initial SAE Report Form must be faxed  or emailed  by the Investigator to the 
designated Safety Contact (below) within 24 hours  of becoming aware of the event:  
 
 
SAE REPORTING SAFETY CONTACT INFORMATION 
Chiltern Safety and Pharmacovigilance  
 
• PV fax number:  888-726-8416 
 
• PV email:   Global.SAEInbox@chiltern.com  
 
• PV Hotline: 888-723-2445    
 
 
For any questions related to the reporting of an SAE, sites should call the PV Hotline and include 
the following information: Sponsor (Synergy Pharmaceuticals), protocol number (SP304202-13), and contact information. 
The minimum information required for an initial report is: 
- Name of person sending the report (i.e., name and address of Investigator)  
- Patient identification (site number, patient number, initials, NOT patient name)  
- Protocol number 
- Description of SAE 
- Causality assessment, if possible  
However, as far as possible all points on the SAE form should be covered in the initial report, or 
the completed SAE form itself must be faxed to the designated Safety Contact. In addition, the event must be documented in the eCRF. 
After receipt of the initial report, the Safety Contact and safety center will review the information 
and, if necessary, contact the Investigator, to obtain further information for assessment of the event.  Acknowledgement of receipt of the SAE report  will be sent to the site within 24 hrs .  In 
the event acknowledgement is not received, the site should contact Chiltern Safety . 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 53 of 79 May 18, 2017  All SAEs must be reported by the Investigator to their IRB/IEC in writing, as well as appropriate 
regulatory authorities, as required by law. The designated Chiltern Safety Contact will be responsible for all information processing and rep orting according to local legal requirements.  
7.6 F
OLLOW -UP OF ADVERSE EVENTS  
All AEs experienced by a patient, irrespective of the suspected causality, will be monitored until the AE (including abnormal laboratory values) has resolved or has returned to baseline or stabilized at a level acceptable to the investigator and medical monitor; until there is a satisfactory explanation for the changes observed; until the patient is lost to follow -up; or until 
the patient has died.   The recording of a stop date is required for all reported adverse events.  
The handling of a missing AE stop date when a patient is lost to follow -up or when an adverse 
event is considered stable but ongoing at the end of study visit will be outlined prior to database lock. 
7.7 P
REGNANCY  
Femal e patients enrolled in the study should make e very effort to avoid becoming pregnant 
during their participation in  the study.  Female patients should be reminded at every visit to use 
appropriate birth control methods.  However, if a female patient should become pregnant during 
the study (i.e., from the date the ICF was signed until the patient’s last visit), the investigator (or authorized delegate) should notify the designated safety contact and Synergy Pharmaceuticals, Inc., on the initial Pregnancy Report form within 24 hours of the investigator (or authorized delegate) first becoming aware of the pregnancy.  Pregnancy itself is not an AE, unless there is suspicion that the investigational product may have interfered with the effectiveness of a contracep tive medication.  Pregnancy reports, however, are tracked and reported in the safety 
(SAE) database but will be reported separately from SAEs.  Pregnancy occurring in the patient between the date of the ICF  was signed  until 30 days after the last dose of study medication will 
fall under the expedited reporting procedure for serious adverse events.  The pregnant patient 
will be immediately discontinued from the study, but will be followed for the duration of the pregnancy.  Details of the outcome of the pregnancy (e.g., full term normal delivery, stillbirth, congenital anomalies, or miscarriage) will be collected and reported by the site.  
All reports of congenital abnormalities/birth defects are SAEs.  Spontaneous miscarriages should also be reported and handled as SAEs.  However, elective abortion without complications should not be handled as SAEs. 
All outcomes of pregnancy, if known, must be reported by the Investigator to the M edical 
Monitor or designated safety contact on the pregnancy outcome report form within 30 days after 
he/she has gained knowledge of the facts. See Section 11, Appendix B for additional details on 
pregnancy reporting requirements.  
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 54 of 79 May 18, 2017  8 STATISTICAL METHODS 
The objectives of the study are to assess the safety and efficacy of plecanatide 0.5, 1.0 , and 1.5 
mg dosed daily, compared with placebo. 
 
Before database lock and un -blinding, a formal statistical analysis plan (SAP) will be written and 
will include details of all statistical methods to be used to analyze the efficacy and safety data. 
The SAP will supersede the protocol with respect to the a nalyses specified, although the primary 
analysis described in this section will remain unchanged.  
 
8.1 RANDOMIZATION AND TREATMENT ASSIGNMENT  
This is a double -blind, placebo- controlled study with four treatment arms that will be conducted 
at approximately 40 clinical sites. Approximately 120 patients will be randomized to receive 
plecanatide 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 mg , or the placebo equivalent , in a 1:1:1:1 ratio using an Interactive 
Web -based Response System (IWRS).  
 
Central , block randomization will be performed with stratification by gender.  
 
8.2 SAMPLE SIZE AND POWER CONSIDERATIONS  
Based on data from two phase 3 trials conducted by the sponsor in adults with CIC, assume a 
mean change from baseline in weekly SBM rate for placebo -treated subjects of 1.2 with a 
standard deviation of 2.6; similarly, for plecanatide -treated subjects, assume a mean change from 
baseline of 3.1 with a standard deviation of 4.0.  Then, a t-test for the difference in means of two 
independent samples with unequal variances, at a two- sided level of significance of 0.05 and 
80% power to detect the assumed difference in means, would require 51 subjects per treatment 
group.  Since study SP304202- 13 is being conducted in adolescents with CIC, and the primary 
analysis of the primary endpoint will be an ANCOVA using a linear mixed -effects model, the 
sponsor believes that 30 subjects per treatment group (placebo and 3 dose levels of  plecanatide), 
yielding a planned target enrollment of a total of 120 subjects, will prove sufficient for achieving 
the primary objective of this phase 2 study.  8.3 A
NALYSIS POPULATIONS  
The following populations will be assessed: 
 
Safety Population : All rando mized patients who receive at least one dose of the study drug.  
Patients will be analyzed according to the treatment received.  All safety analyses will be based on the Safety Population. 
Intent -to-Treat (ITT) 
Population : All patients randomized to study  treatment .  Patients will be analyzed 
according to the treatment to which they are randomized.  The ITT 
Population is the main population for assessments of efficacy.  
Per Protocol (PP) 
Population: All patients in the ITT population who complete the  8-week Treatment 
Period or discontinue from study treatment due to adverse event(s) or 
lack of efficacy , with the exception of major protocol violators.  Criteria 
to identify the PP population will be detailed in the SAP.  Decisions 
regarding exclusion fr om the PP Population will be made prior to 
unblinding the database. 
Efficacy  analyses will be based on the ITT Population.  Efficacy analyses will be repeated for the  
PP Population to assess the sensitivity of the analyse s to the choice of analysis set.  
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 55 of 79 May 18, 2017  Deviations from the study protocol, including violations of inclusion/exclusion criteria , will be 
assessed as “minor” or “major” in cooperation with the Sponsor.  Major deviations from the 
protocol will lead to the exclusion of a patient from the PP Population and will be determined  
prior to unblinding the study database.  
8.4 G
ENERAL CONSIDERATIONS  
Categorical variables will be summarized by the number and percentage of patients in each 
category level.  Continuous variables will be summarized by number of observations, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum values.  Where data are collected 
over time, both the observed data and change from Baseline will be summarized at each t ime 
point.  Summaries will be presented by treatment group (placebo, and plecanatide 0.5 mg, 1.0 mg , and 
1.5 mg), and combined active doses.  All data collected in the eCRF will be presented in listings . 
 All statistical tests will be two -sided at the 5% l evel of significance, unless stated  otherwise. 
 No interim analyses are planned.  
 
8.4.1 Missing Data Conventions 
In general, data will not be imputed for safety analys es. 
 
The weekly SBM ( CSBM) rate is the sum of the SBMs ( CSBMs) recorded for the days in the 
week for which a BM response is recorded in the daily diary.  Note that this is equivalent to a 
“worst case” analysis in that the SBM ( CSBM) rate for the  week is the sum of the SBMs 
(CSBMs) recorded for the days in the week for which BMs were reported, plus 0 SBMs (0 
CSBMs) for each day in the week for which the BM response is missing.  In any week in which 
no BM response is recorded, the weekly SBM ( CSBM) rate will be set to 0 in any summary or 
linear mixed -effects model  analysis  involving the weekly SBM ( CSBM) rate.  In particular, for a 
randomized patient who withdraws from study participation prior to the end of the study, the patient is considered to h ave a weekly SBM ( CSBM) rate equal to 0 for any weeks remaining in 
the planned duration of the study for which the patient has no BM responses recorded.  The weekly average CIC-related abdominal pain score is the average of the non- missing, 
abdominal pain scores recorded in that week, i.e., the weekly average is the sum of the abdominal pain score s recorded in the diary  in the given week, divided by the number of pain 
scores recorded in the week .  In any week in which a patient has no diary days for which an 
abdominal pain score is recorded, the weekly average abdominal pain score will be set to 
missing.  In any linear mixed -effects model analysis involving the weekly average abdominal 
pain score, if the average score is set to missing in a given week, it will be left as missing in the 
linear model.  In particular, for a randomized patient who withdraws from study participation 
prior to the end of the study, the weekly average abdominal pain score will be set to missing for 
any weeks remaining in the planned duration of the study for which the patient has no abdominal pain data.  
 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 56 of 79 May 18, 2017  In any analysis involving abdominal bloating, abdominal discomfort, straining during a bowel 
movement or pain with defecation, the determination of weekly averages will follow the same 
methodology as described above for the abdominal pain score.  That is, the weekly average item 
score is the sum of the non- missing scores recorded during the week, divided by the total number 
of non- missing scores recorded.  In any week in which a patient has no non- missing item score 
recorded, the weekly average score will b e set to missing in any summary or linear mixed -effects 
model analysis involving the weekly average item score.  
 In any analysis involving stool consistency  (BSFS scores), the determination of weekly averages 
will follow the same methodology as presented above for abdominal pain.  However, since stool 
consistency cannot be assessed if the patient does not have at least one SBM during the week in question (i.e., stool consistency is based on SBMs only), the weekly average will also be set to missing if no SB Ms are recorded for any days in the week.  Also, it is possible that a patient has 
no baseline weekly average stool consistency score because of the SBM criterion; in that case the patient will be excluded from any change from baseline analyses of stool co nsistency. 
 For the exploratory  Responder analyses, in any given week, a patient must have at least 4 
compliant diary days in that week.  A compliant diary day mean s that the patient has responded 
to the BM and rescue medication use questions in the daily diary for that day.  Patients who have fewer than 4 compliant diary days in a given week will be considered “non- responders” for that 
week.  Note that this implies that for any week for which a pati ent has no BM or rescue 
medication use data, the patient is considered a non- responder; in particular, for a randomized 
patient who withdraws from study participation prior to the end of the study, the patient is considered a non- responder for any weeks remaining in the planned duration of the study for 
which the pati ent has no BM or rescue medication use data.  
 
8.4.2 Diary Data Visit Windows  
The daily electronic diary entries reported during the Treatment Period will be classified into 8 weeks as follows:  
 
Day 1 -7 = Week  1 
Day 8 -14 = Week 2  
Day 15 -21 = Week 3  
Day 22-28 = Week 4 
Day 29 -35 = Week 5  
Day 36 -42 = Week 6  
Day 43 -49 = Week 7  
Day 50 -56 = Week 8 
 
Non-diary data, such as vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments , and ECGs, will be displayed 
and analyzed according to the nominal visit date on the eCRF.  Assessments taken outside of 
protocol allowable windows for nominal visits will be displayed according to the slotting scheme 
presented in the SAP for unscheduled or out- of-window visits. 
 
8.4.3 Baseline Definition  
For each safety parameter, the most recent  valid assessment recorded before randomization will 
be used as the baseline for all analyses of that safety parameter.  
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 57 of 79 May 18, 2017  For efficacy parameters, the baseline values will be derived from data collected in the 2 -week 
electronic diary assessment at the end of the Screening Period (baseline).   The last 14 days of 
diary entries prior to Day 1 will be the default standard for derivation of these values. 
 The baseline SBM (CSBM ) weekly rate will be the weekly average number of SBMs (CSBMs ) 
recorded during the 2- week baseline assessment  period.  Baseline stool consistency, severity of 
straining  during a BM,  and abdominal symptoms will be calculated as follows: for each week of 
the baseline assessment, the weekly average is the sum of the non -missing scores recorded 
during the week divided by the total number of non- missing scores recorded  during that week ; 
the baseline is then equal to one- half of the sum of the two weekly average scores. . 
  
8.5 D
ISPOSITION OF PATIENTS  
Patient disposition and reasons for discontinuation from the Treatment Period of the study will 
be summarized by treatment group for all randomized patients. 
 
8.6 TREATMENT COMPLIANCE  
Dosing compliance will be defined by the dosing compliance ratio: the number of doses actually 
taken by the patient divided by the number of doses that were expected to be taken during the same period multiplied by 100.  Treatment compliance is defined as taking equal to or greater than 80% of the drug dosage prescribed.  Otherwise, the patient will be considered noncompliant with study  treatment.  Rates of treatment compliance as defined above will be compared between 
treatment groups using the Chi- square test.  
 Patient compliance with making daily electronic diary entries is monitored by the IWRS  system ; 
patients non- compliant in making daily diary entries will be withdrawn from the study . 
 
8.7 D
EMOGRAPHICS , MEDICAL HISTORY , BASELINE CHARACTERISTICS , AND 
CONCOMITANT MEDICATIONS  
Demographic data and other baseline characteristics, medical history, and concomitant 
medication s will be summarized by means of descriptive statistics.  Where applicable, 
comparisons among treatment groups will be performed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model for continuous variables and a Cochran- Mantel -Haenszel (CMH) test for categorical 
variables  
8.8 E
FFICACY ANALYSES  
8.8.1 Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of responders for the last 2 weeks of the Treatment 
Period (responder = a child who experiences >3 SBMs per week for each of the last two weeks of the 
treatment period) compared to placebo and across treatment groups.   
8.8.1.1 Analysis of the Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The weekly SBM rate  for each patient will be computed, as described in Section 8.4.1, for each 
week of the 8 -week treatment period.  The change from baseline in mean weekly SBM rate will 
be analyzed using a linear mixed -effects model with fixed effects for gender (stratification

the 8 -week Treatment Period , and by Study Week 
The weekly average stool consistency (BSFS) score for each patient will be computed, as 
described in Section 8.4.1, for each week of the 8- week treatment period.   The change from 
baseline in mean weekly average BSFS score over the 8 -week treatment period will be analyzed 
using a linear mixed -effects model with fixed effects for gender  (stratification v ariable), 
treatment, week,  and the corresponding baseline value; a random intercept for patient will also be 
specified.  The least squares (LS) mean change from baseline will be presented, by treatment 
group, and the difference in LS means for each plecanatide treatment group compared to placebo will be presented, with 95% confidence interval s and corresponding statistical p-value s. 
 As a supplement to the above analysis , the weekly average stool consistency (BSFS) score for 
each patient w ill be computed, as described in Section 8.4.1, for each week of the 8 -week 
treatment period and for the two weeks of the follow -up period.  A  summary, by treatment 
group, of the mean weekly average BSFS score, and change from baseline in mean weekly 
average BSFS score, for each of the 10 study weeks will be presented.  The change from baseline in mean weekly average BSFS scores will be analyzed using a linear mixed -effects model with 
fixed effects for gender (stratification variable), treatment, week, the interaction of treatment and week , and the corresponding baseline value; a random intercept for patient will also be specified.  
The least squares (LS) mean change from baseline will be presented, by treatment group, and the 
difference in  LS means for each plecanatide treatment group compared to placebo will be 
presented, with 95% confidence interval  and corresponding statistical p-value, for each week  of 
the 8 -week treatment period  and for the two follow-up weeks. 
 
8.8.2.2 Change from Baseline in  the Weekly Rate of SBMs, by Study Week 
The weekly SBM rate for each patient will be computed, as described in Section 8.4.1, for each 
week of the 8 -week treatment period and for the two weeks of the follow -up period.  A 
summary, by treatment group, of the mean weekly SBM rate, and change from baseline in mean week ly SBM rate, for each of the 10 study weeks will be presented.  The change from baseline in 
mean weekly SBM rate will be analyzed using a linear mixed -effects model with fixed effects 
for gender (stratification variable), treatment, week, the interaction of treatment and week , and 
the corresponding baseline value; a random intercept for patient will also be specified.  The least 
squares (LS) mean change from baseline will be presented, by treatment group, and the

8.8.3 Additional Efficacy Endpoints  
 
Additional efficacy endpoints related to CIC symptoms are:  
 
• Change from baseline in abdominal pain, by study week 
• Change from baseline in abdominal bloating, by study week 
• Change from baseline in abdominal discomfort, by study week 
• Change from baseline in straining during a BM , by study week   
• Change from baseline in pain with defecation, by study week 
 
8.8.3.1 Analysis of the Additional Efficacy Endpoints  
The weekly average of each additional efficacy endpoint score (abdominal pain, abdominal bloating, abdominal discomfort, straining during a bowel movement, or pain with defecation) for each patient will be computed, as described in Section 8.4.1, for each week of the 8 -week 
treatment period and for the two weeks of the follow -up period.  A summary, by treatment 
group, of the mean weekly average symptom score, and change from baseline in mean weekly average symptom score, for each of the 10 study weeks will be presented.  The change from baseline in mean weekly average symptom score  will be analyzed using a linear mixed -effects 
model with fixed effects for gender (str atification variable), treatment, week, the interaction of 
treatment and week , and the corresponding baseline value; a random intercept for patient will 
also be specified.  For each abdominal symptom score, t he least squares (LS) mean change from

Final Version 4.0 Page 60 of 79 May 18, 2017   baseline will be presented, and the difference in LS means for each plecanatide treatment group 
compared to placebo will be presented, with 95% confidence interval  and corresponding 
statistical p-value, for each week  of the 8- week treatment period  and for  the two follow -up 
weeks.  
 
8.8.4 Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
The following exploratory efficacy endpoints will be assessed: 
• 4/8 Week SBM 3 + 1 Responder  
• 6/8 Week SBM 3 + 1 Responder  
• 4/8 Week CSBM 3 + 1 Responder 
• 6/8 Week CSBM 3 + 1 Responder 
 
8.8.4.1 Analysis of Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
A weekly SBM (CSBM) 3 + 1 Responder is a patient who has at least 3 SBMs (CSBMs) in a 
given week and an increase of at least 1 SBM (CSBM) from baseline during that week.  A 4/8 
Week SBM (CSBM) 3 + 1 Responder me ets these criteria for at  least 4 of the 8 weeks of the 
treatment p eriod ; a 6/8 Week SBM (CSBM) 3 + 1 Responder meets these criteria for at least 6 of 
the 8 weeks of the treatment period.  
 
The responder rate for each of the four exploratory  efficacy endpoint s will be analyzed .  In each 
of these  responder analyses, for each plecanatide group, the proportion of responders will be 
compared to the proportion of responders in the placebo group using the CMH test stratified by 
gender.  The number and percentage of responders  for each treatment group (and 95% 
confidence intervals), the difference in responder rates between each plecanatide group and the placebo group (and 95% confidence intervals), and the two- sided p-value associated with the 
CMH test will be presented.  
 
8.8.5 Patient Reported Outcomes  
PRO questionnaire data for fecal incontinence, excessive flatulence, PGA, PAC —SYM, and 
PAC —QOL will be included in the patient listings.  Summary analyses of these data will also be 
provided as described in the SAP. 
 
8.8.6 Adjustments for M ultiple C omparisons 
Since this is a Phase 2 clinical trial for exploratory purposes, no adjustments for multiple 
comparisons will be undertaken. 
8.9 PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSIS  
Plasma concentrations of Plecanatide and its major metabolite (SP -338) will be listed by patient 
and summarized by treatment group.

Evaluation of the safety  of once daily plecanatide over 8 weeks of dosing will be based on the 
occurrence of TEAEs, vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments , and ECGs and as compared 
with those noted in the placebo group. 
 The safety analyses will use the Safety Population defined in Section  8.3. 
 The frequency of SAEs, AEs leading to withdrawal  from study participation , and TEAEs will be 
included in the primary safety tables.  
 Adverse events will be coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) 
classifications with reference to system organ classes (SOCs) and preferred terms.  Only TEAEs 
will be included in summary tables.   Summaries of TEAEs will be presented by SOC and 
preferred term, by treatment.  Summaries will include the frequency of TEAEs, SAEs, and AEs 
leading to withdrawal from study participation, by dose as well as by intensity and relationship to 
study drug. Out of range laboratory tests, ECGs , and vital signs of potential clinical importance will also be 
summarized ; a listing of patients with at least one out of range value will be presented by visit 
for that test.  
 Laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis), vital signs, and ECG will be summarized as changes from baseline.  Laboratory shift tables will also be produced, where 
applicable.  Listings of laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECGs will also be provided.  Physical examination and medical history listings will be provided but not summarized . 
 Concomitant medications will be auto -encoded using  the WHODD coding system with reference

Final Version 4.0 Page 62 of 79 May 18, 2017  9 ETHICAL, LEGAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE ASPECTS 
9.1 DATA QUALITY ASSURANCE  
The sponsor or sponsor’s designee will inform the investigator of the responsibilities and 
procedures for ensuring adequate and correct documentation. 
The investigator is required to prepare and maintain adequate and accurate case histories 
designed to record all observations and other data pertinent to the study for each study participant.  All information recorded in the eCRF for this study must be consistent with the 
patients’ source documentation (i.e., medical records and charts). 
9.1.1 Database Management and Quality Control 
All data will be captured electronically at each clinical site using  eCRFs and the interactive web 
response system (IWRS).  Patient diary and questionnaire data will be collected using the  IWRS .   
Once the eCRF clinical data have been submitted, corrections to the data fields will be captured 
in an audit trail.  The reason for change, the name of the person who performed the change, 
together with the time and date will be logged to provide an audit trail.  
Computerized data check programs and manual checks will identify any clinical data discrepancies for resolution.  If additional corrections are needed, the responsible monitor or data manger will raise a query in the electronic data capture (EDC) application.  The appropriate staff at the clinical site will answer queries sent to the investigator.  The name of the staff member responding to the query, and time and date stamp, will be captured to provide an audit trail.  Once all source data verification is complete and all queries are closed, the monitor will freeze the eCRF page.  
The specific procedures to be used for data entry and query resolution using the EDC and/or 
IWRS will be provided to study sites in training manuals and/or guidelines.  In addition, clinical site personnel will receive training on the EDC system, including the eCRF, and the IWRS systems.  
9.2 E
LECTRONIC CASE REPORT FORMS AND SOURCE DOCUMENTATION  
All data obtained during this study should be entered into the EDC system promptly, or entered by the patient or site in the IWRS interface.  All source documents from which eCRF entries are derived should be placed in the patient’s medical records/charts.  Reports/documents for which source documents are usually available include laboratory assessments and ECG recordings.  
The original eCRF entries for each patient may be checked against source documents at the clinical site by the site monitor.  Instances of missing or un -interpretable data will be discussed 
with the investigator for resolution.  
9.2.1 Data Collection 
The investigators (and appropriately authorized staff) will be given access to an online web-based EDC sy stem that is 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Part 11 compliant.  This system 
is specifically designed for the collection of the clinical data in electronic format.  Access and rights to the EDC system will be carefully controlled and configured according to each 
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 63 of 79 May 18, 2017  individual’s role throughout the study.  In general, only the investigator and authorized staff will 
be able to enter data and make corrections in the eCRFs.  
The eCRF should be completed for each patient included in the study and should reflect the latest 
observations on the patient’s participating in the study.  Therefore, the eCRFs are to be completed as soon as possible during or immediately after the patient’s visit or assessment.  The 
expectation is that study sites will complete data entry  within 48 hours of a patient visit .  
The investigator must ensure that all data entries in the eCRF are accurate and correct.  If some assessments cannot be done, or if certain information is unavailable, not applicable, or unknown, the investigator shoul d indicate this in the eCRF.  
Computerized data -check programs and manual checks will identify any clinical data 
discrepancies for resolution.  Corresponding queries will be loaded into the system and the clinical site will be informed about new issues to b e resolved online.  All discrepancies will be 
resolved online directly by the investigator or by authorized staff.  Data managers and clinical site monitors will be available to assist sites in resolving queries.  Offline edit checks will be done to examine relationships over time and across panels to facilitate quality data.  
After completion of data entry and cleaning, the investigator will be required to electronically sign off on the clinical data collected in the eCRF.  
Data concerning all study drug dis pensed to the patient will be tracked in the IWRS system. 
Study drug return will be tracked in the eCRF.  
9.3 A
CCESS TO SOURCE DATA 
During the study, a monitor will make clinical site visits to review protocol compliance, compare eCRF entries and individual patient medical records, assess drug accountability, and ensure that the study is being conducted according to pertinent regulatory requirements.  eCRF entries will be verified using source documentation.  The review of medical records will be performed in a manner to ensure that patient confidentiality is maintained.  
Checking of the eCRF entries for completeness and clarity, and cross -checking with source 
documents, will be required to monitor the progress of the study.  Moreover, regulatory authorities, IRBs , and/or the sponsor’s clinical quality assurance group (or designee) may wish to 
carry out such source data checks and/or on- site audit inspections.  Direct access to source data 
will be required for these inspections and audits; they will be carried out giving due consideration to data protection and medical confidentiality.  The investigator and authorized site staff will assure that auditors or monitors and the sponsor have full access to study data and files and the necessary support of site personnel at all times.  
9.4 D
ATA CODING 
Previous and concomitant medications will be coded using the World Health Organization 
(WHO) Drug Dictionary (WHODD), which employs the anatomical therapeutic chemical (ATC) 
classification system.  Medical history/current medical conditions and AEs will be coded using 
the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) terminology.  
Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Clinical Study Protocol  
Protocol SP304202- 13 CONFIDENTIAL  
Final Version 4.0 Page 64 of 79 May 18, 2017  The versions of the coding dictionaries used will be provided in the statistical analysis plan and 
the clinical study report.  
9.5 ARCHIVING STUDY RECORDS  
According to International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines, essential documents 
should be retained for a minimum of 2 years after the last approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region, or at least 2 years have elapsed since the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.  Ten years is the recommended storage duration to ensure compliance with ICH requirements.  However, these documents should be retained for a longer 
period if required by applicable legal requirements. 
9.6 G
OOD CLINICAL PRACTICE  
The procedures set out in the study protocol are designed to ensure that the sponsor and 
investigator abide by the princip les of the Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the ICH.  The 
study also will be carried out in keeping with local legal requirements  (Appendix F). 
9.7 INFORMED CONSEN T 
Before each patient is admitted to the study, informed consent will be obtained from the patient 
(or his/her legally authorized representative) according to the regulatory and legal requirements.  The informed consent form (ICF) must be dated and retained by the investigator as part of the 
study records.  The investigator will not undertake any investigation specifically required only for the clinical study until valid consent has been obtained.  The date of the consent must also be documented in t he EDC system.  
If a protocol amendment is required, the ICF may need to be revised to reflect the changes to the protocol.  If the ICF is revised, it must be reviewed and approved by the appropriate IRB, and signed by all patients subsequently screened for  the study as well as those currently enrolled in 
the study. 
9.8 P
ROTOCOL APPROVAL AND AMENDMENT  
Before the start of the study, the study protocol and/or other relevant documents will be approved 
by the IRB in accordance with local legal requirements.  The sponsor must ensure that all ethical and legal requirements have been met before the first patient is screened in the study.  
The protocol is to be followed exactly.  To alter the protocol, amendments must be written, receive approval from the appropriate personnel at Synergy Pharmaceuticals, and receive IRB approval prior to implementation (if appropriate).  Following approval, the protocol amendment(s) will be submitted to the Investigational New Drug (IND) application under which the study is being conducted. 
Administrative changes (not affecting the patient benefit/risk ratio) may be made without the 
need for a formal amendment but must be submitted to the applicable IRB/ethics committee.  All amendments will be distributed to all protocol recipients, with a ppropriate instructions.

Final Version 4.0 Page 65 of 79 May 18, 2017  9.9 DURATION OF THE STUDY  
For an individual patient, the planned duration of the study will be 98 days (including 28 days for 
screening, 56  days of treatment and 14 days of follow-up.  
9.10 PREMATURE TERMINATION OF THE STUDY  
If the investigator, the sponsor, or the medical monitor becomes aware of conditions or events 
that suggest a possible hazard to patients if the study continues, the study may be terminated after appropriate consultation between the relevant parties.  The study may also be terminated early at the sponsor’s discretion in the absence of such a finding. 
Conditions that may warrant termination include, but are not limited to: 
• The discovery of an unexpected, significant, or unacceptable risk to the patients enrolled in  
the study 
• Failure to enroll patients at an acceptable rate  
• A decision on the part of the sponsor to suspend or discontinue development of the study 
drug 
9.11 C
ONFIDENTIALITY  
All study findings and documents will be regarded as confidential.  The investigator a nd 
members of his/her research team must not disclose such information without prior written approval from the sponsor. 
The anonymity of participating patients must be maintained.  Patients will be identified in eCRFs 
and other documents submitted to the sponsor and CRO by their patient number, initials, and/or birth date, not by name. 
9.12 O
THER ETHICAL AND REGULATORY ISSUES  
If a significant safety issue is identified, either from an individual case report or review of 
aggregate data, then the sponsor will issue prompt notification to all parties – regulatory 
authorities, investigators, and IRBs. 
A significant safety issue is one that has a significant impact on the course of the clinical study or 
program (including the potential for suspension of the development program or amendments to protocols) or warrants an immediate update of informed consent form. 
9.13 L
IABILITY AND INSURANCE  
The sponsor will take out reasonable third- party liability insurance coverage in accordance with 
all local legal requirements.  The civil liability of the investigator, the persons instructed by him 
or her, and the hospital, practice, or institute in which they are employed and the liability of the sponsor with respect to medical costs for physical injury and other damage that may arise as  a 
result of the carrying out of this study are governed by applicable law(s). 
The sponsor will arrange for patients participating in this study to be insured against medical 
costs for physical injury caused by the pharmaceutical products being tested or b y medical steps 
taken in the course of the study.

Final Version 4.0 Page 71 of 79 May 18, 2017  B. PREGNANCY REPORTING  
If a female patient should become p regnant during the course of the study (i.e., from the date the 
informed consent was signed until the patient’s last visit), the Investigator (or authorized 
delegate) should notify the designated Safety Contact within 24 hours of the Investigator (or authorized delegate) first becoming aware of the pregnancy.  The notification of pregnancy should be submitted using the initial Pregnancy Report Form.  The initial Pregnancy Report Form should be completed with study patient’s details (eg, patient number, initials, date of birth, and investigational product information.).  Whenever possible, the initial notification of pregnancy should include detailed information on the pregnancy, including last menstrual period and/or expected date of delivery.  If pregnancy is to be terminated, the anticipated date of 
termination should be provided.  If a maternal AE is reported during the initial notification of pregnancy, the details of the AE should also be described in the narrative field of the initial Pregnancy Report F orm. 
 The Sponsor, Medical Monitor, or designated Safety Representative will request permission to follow the patient’s progress with the doctor medically responsible for the pregnancy.  If additional information on the progress of the pregnancy and/or any  maternal AE is received 
“spontaneously” by the clinical site, the Investigator (or authorized delegate) should submit a follow- up Pregnancy Report Form to the Sponsor within 24 hours of becoming aware of the 
information.  If additional information on the outcome of the pregnancy and/or the details of the birth/delivery is received “spontaneously” by the clinical site, the Investigator (or authorized delegate) should also submit a pregnancy outcome report form to the designated Safety Contact within 24 hour s 
of becoming aware of the information.  If the outcome of the pregnancy is reported as premature birth, or as elective termination due to a medical reason or as spontaneous or accidental miscarriage, the details of the outcome should be described in the narrative section of the outcome Pregnancy Report Form.  The pregnancy outcome will generally be reported as a follow- up report.  Details of birth/delivery, including date of birth, weight, and sex of the 
fetus/newborn should also be described in the narrat ive field of the Pregnancy Report Form.  
 Complete a new SAE Report Form if the delivery outcome meets the criteria for a SAE (e.g., congenital anomaly/birth defect, still birth, some other sickness, etc.).  The SAE Report Form should be completed with study patient’s details (e.g., patient number, initials, date of birth, investigational product information, etc.) and the details of the fetal SAE should be described in the narrative field of the SAE Report Form.

 1.0 STUDY PURPOSES AND OBJECTIVES  
 
This study is designed to obtain positron emission tomography  with x -ray computed tomography 
(PET/CT) scan data according to the Specific Aims of Small Business Innovation Research 
(SBIR) grant 2R44CA257522 from the National Cancer Institute (PI=Kadrmas; consortium 
between MultiFunctional Imaging LLC and HCI).  PET/CT exams will be acquired for three pairs 
of radiopharmaceutical s:  FDG + Cu64 -DOTATATE  and FDG + Ga68 -DOTATATE  in patients 
with known or suspected neuroendocrine tumors; and FDG + Ga68 -PSMA -11 in patients with 
known or suspected prostate cancer .  All of these radiopharmaceuticals are FDA approved, and 
each radiopharmaceutical will be used  according to its approved indications for use.   The study  
data will be used by the sponsor company, MultiFunctional Imaging LLC (MFI)  according to the 
aims of the grant  to develop  new techniques and algorithms for simultaneous dual -tracer  PET 
imaging of these tracer  pairs.   The overall objective is to obtain scan data for develop ing 
new techniques and algorithms for simultaneous  dual-tracer  imaging of these tracer 
pairs with PET . 
 
The PET scans will be acquired using specially -designed “multi -timepoint” scanning sequences 
that acquire more images than would be obtained in routine standard of care PET/CT scans.  
The study will be performed over  three Arms.  Each Arm will acquire  separate, single -tracer 
scan s of two  tracer s on separate days  in each subject , and the 2nd tracer used for each Arm will 
differ as follows : 
• Arm 1 = FDG and Cu64 -DOTATATE PET/CT exams  in 15 subjects with known or 
suspected neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) ; 
• Arm 2 = FDG and Ga68 -DOTATATE PET/CT exams  in 15 subjects with known or 
suspected NETs ; and 
• Arm 3 = FDG and Ga68 -PSMA PET/CT exams in 20 subjects with  known or suspected  
prostate cancer with  suspected  metastasis or recurrence . 
 
The PET/CT exams will be acquired at HCI, and the  visual and semi -quantitative  image 
assessments described in Section 5.0 will also be performed at HCI.  The resulting images and 
assessment results will be de -identified and delivered to MFI, where the images will be analyzed 
and used for the Specific Aims of the research grant, including the analyses described in 
Section 6.0.  Here, t he separate -scan images o btained in  each Arm will be combined to 
“synthesize” corresponding simultaneous dual -tracer images —enabling development and 
testing of various simultaneous dual -tracer processing algorithms , where the original single -
tracer images provide “gold standard” references for recovering individual -tracer images from 
the combined dual -tracer ones.  This is a well -established approach for developing rapid dual -
tracer PET techniques  [1-13], and in essence it allows for the data to act as their own controls.  
 
This study  is funded by National Cancer Institute  grant 2R44CA257522 , and it will be performed 
as part of a consortium agreement between MFI and the University of Utah  under that grant .  
The overall goal  is to develop techniques and algorithms for simultaneous dual -tracer imaging of 
these tracer pairs.  This requires sets of dual -tracer PET data acquired using specially -designed  
multi -timepoint  acquisition protocols that facilitate the development and study of simultaneous 
Current Version:  6-17-2023  
 
Page 7 of 37 
 dual-tracer PET imaging techniques.  New algorithms for processing dual -tracer PET images 
will be developed and tested using these data.  These algorithms are not part of any medical 
device , and the approach of using multi -timepoint dual -tracer PET scanning is novel and 
requires the development of new algorithms to process these data and recover individual -tracer 
PET images.  
 
It is important to note that th e primary goal is to develop new technologies , not to investigate the 
clinical value of the PET tracers being used.  I ndeed, all four PET tracers are FDA approved 
and will be used within  their approved indications for use.   Also note that this study is not an 
NIH-defined clinical trial .  This distinction is clearly identified in the R44 grant application (PHS 
Human Subjects section; Clinical Trial Questionnaire :  the study is not “designed to evaluate the 
effect of the intervention on the participates ” and does not “evaluate a health -related biomedical 
outcome”).   I.e., the study is not designed to evaluate the efficacy of the PET tracers being 
used.   Instead, t he study is designed to develop new dual -tracer PET imaging techniques and 
evaluate whether or not  individual -tracer PET images can be recovered from simultaneous dual -
tracer PET scan s. 
 
1.1.  Primary Objective  
The primary objective is to obtain PET/CT imaging data suitable for developing new 
simultaneous dual-tracer PET techniques and processing algorithms for dual-tracer imaging  of 
FDG + Cu64 -DOTATATE, FDG + Ga68 -DOT ATATE, and FDG + Ga68 -PSMA -11 PET/CT . 
 
1.2.  Secondary Objective  
The data obtained may also provide insight into the combined value of dual -tracer PET/CT 
imag es with these tracers.  The secondary objective of the study is to  preliminarily  assess the 
combined value of dual -tracer imag es with these tracers  as compared to single -tracer imag es.  
The relative uptake of each tracer in tumors will be assessed to determine the potential for 
improved detection sensitivity and specificity for dual -tracer imaging as compared to single -
tracer imaging.  This secondary objective is exploratory  in nature, and may result in preliminary 
data suitable for designing subsequent hypothesis -driven research studies  in this area.  
 
 
2.0 BACKGROUND  
2.1.  Dual -Tracer PET Technologies and MFI  
MultiFunctional Imaging LLC ( MFI) is a University of Utah spinoff company that is investigating  
technologies patented at the University for rapidly imaging multiple PET tracers in a single scan .  
Under research  grant 2R44CA257522, MFI is investigating novel techniques for simultaneously 
imaging several tracer pairs.  These include simultaneous imaging  of FDG + Cu64 -DOTATATE 
and FDG+ Ga68 -DOTATATE for NETs, and of FDG + Ga68 -PSMA for prostate cancer.   The 
rationale for imaging these tracer combinations is provided below.  The proof -of-concept for the 
new simultaneous dual -tracer PET techniques was established under a previous Phase I grant .  
The current  Phase II grant will study the new simultaneous dual -tracer PET techniques  in depth , 
Current Version:  6-17-2023  
 
Page 8 of 37 
 develop new algorithms for processing simultaneous dual-tracer PET images, and evaluate how 
well these algorithms can recover individual -tracer images from simultaneous dual -tracer PET 
datasets.  
 
The clinical research study described by this  protocol is designed to obtain dual -tracer PET/CT 
imaging data with each tracer pair according to the Specific Aims  of the  grant, providing the 
imaging data needed to develop new simultaneous dual -tracer imaging techniques and 
processing algorithms  for these tracer pairs.  The study design  uses established 
physics/engineering principles, and it  is based on  two decades of research and development in 
dual-tracer PET by the investigators . 
 
2.2.  Theranostic Tracers and Dual -Tracer PET/CT  
 
2.2.1.  Value of Imaging Two Tracers  
While FDG remains the primary workhorse tracer for general PET cancer imaging, a number of 
other PET tracers have recently received FDA approval and are experiencing increased 
utilization.  Of particular importance are theranostic  radiopharmaceuti cals (e.g. PSMA, 
DOTATATE) , which are  PET tracers with therapeutic analogs that can predict radiotherapeutic 
efficacy.  Since d ifferent PET tracers reveal different aspects of tumor function , concurrently 
imaging multiple  PET tracers in each patient provides more complete diagnostic information 
imaging just single tracers .  Such multi -tracer imaging can greatly improve the utility of PET for 
diagnosing and characterizing a variety of malignant tumors; it can improve staging and grading; 
and moreover it can provide  improved image -guided  selecti on of  the most effective targeted 
therapies in individual patients when using combinations that include theranostic tracers.  
 
2.2.2.  Dual-Tracer Imaging of FDG + Theranostic Tracers  
Several theranostic PET tracers have recently received FDA approval, including Cu64 
DOTATATE (Detectnet ™) and Ga68 DOTATATE (NETSPOT ™) for localization of somatostatin 
receptor positive neuroendocrine tumors (NETs)  [14-53], and Ga68 PSMA for  imaging PSMA -
positive lesions in men with prostate cancer  [54-84].  Uptake of these theranostic tracers can 
predict response to targeted radionuclide therapy with Lu177 -DOTATATE or Lu177 -PSMA, 
respectively, and PET imaging with these tracers may be prerequisite before starting such 
therapies.  However, diagnostic performance of these tracers varies with tumor grade .  
DOTATATE and PSMA provide high sensitivity for well -differentiated tumors , but they also 
experience low uptake in poorly -differentiated tumors.  FDG, on the other hand, provides higher 
sensitivity for poorly -differentiated tumors  and enhanced grading information .  Combined dual -
tracer imaging could improve sensitivity and staging over either tracer alone.  It could enable 
improved grading by comparing the relative uptake of the two tracers (well -differentiated tumors 
will have high DOTATATE/PSMA uptake and low FDG update; and vice versa  for poorly -
differentiated, high -grade tumors) .  In addition, it could provide a more powerful means of 
predicting response to targeted radionuclide therapy , with uptake of the theranostic tracer 
predictive of response, but uptake of FDG being contraindicative.

 2.2.3.  FDG, DOTATATE, and Neuroendocrine Tumors  
Neuroendocrine tumors, including gastrointestinal NET, pancreatic NET, pulmonary carcinoids, 
and other rare NET, have an annual incidence of about 5 per 100,000 in the US.  Symptoms 
can be vague, diagnosis is often made at an advanced stage, and selecting the optimal 
treatment strategy is challenging.  Patients with high uptake of DOTATATE (or other SSTR PET 
tracers) typically have a more indolent tumor and are more amendable to treatment with Lu177 
DOTATATE (Lutathera ™), while those with high FDG uptake are more aggressive and are best 
treated by other methods.  Combined imaging of FDG and SSTR tracer avidity has previously 
been proposed for optimal characterization of NETs [34].  Current approaches use biopsies of 
the initial tumor to assess differentiation status of tumor cells, and then subsequently prescribe 
either DOTATATE or FDG imaging for well -differentiated and poorly -differentiated tumors, 
respectively.  However, biopsies provide limited sampling, different groups of cells may exhibit 
different levels of differentiation, and tumors may initially present as well -differentiated but 
undergo transformation into higher grade over time with the development of treatment 
resistance [85].  NETs may also exhibit different degrees of differentiation simultaneously  in the 
same patient.  Combined imaging of FDG+DOTATATE can provide high sensitivity for both 
well- and poorly -differentiated NETs, improve staging and grading, and provide more accurate 
prognosis, and predicting effectiveness of targeted radionuclide therapy [26, 32, 86, 87] .  Chan 
et al.  [35] state “it is clear that the time has come to think about FDG and SSRI in metastatic 
NET not as competitors but as complementary imaging modalities”.   Proposed dual -tracer 
“NETPET scores” [34] and three -scale combined grading system [17] also highlight the need for 
combined dual-tracer FDG+DOTATATE of NETs.  
 
There are currently 3 DOTA -conjugated peptide PET tracers with FDA approval for localization 
of somatostatin receptor positive NETs:  Cu64 -DOTATATE, Ga68 -DOTATATE, and Ga68 -
DOTATOC [16, 20, 26, 27, 38, 48, 49, 88 -93].  Each experiences similar uptake and distribution 
in the body, but have different radioisotopes:  Cu64 (T 1/2=12.70h, cyclotron -produced, centrally 
distributed [94, 95] ) vs. Ga68 (T 1/2=67.71m, generator -produced  locally ).  We include both Cu64 
DOTATATE ( Arm 1) and Ga68 DOTATATE ( Arm 2) in this study.  
 
2.2.4.  FDG, PSMA, and Prostate Cancer  
An a nalogous situation exists for FDG  + PSMA imaging  of prostate cancer .  Prostate cancer is 
the 2nd most common cancer in American men, with 248,530 new cases and 34,130 deaths in 
2021 [cancer.org].  PSMA PET offers high sensitivity in well -differentiated tumors, and PSMA 
uptake is predictive of response to Lu177 -PSMA therapy.  Conversely, high FDG uptake in a 
tumor site indicates high -grade poorly -differentiated tumor, and suggests that Lu177 -PSMA 
therapy may not be effective [96].  Again, dual -tracer FDG+PSMA imaging would provide higher 
sensitivity over all tumor grades and better staging than either tracer alone; it would provide 
enhanced grading using relative FDG:PSMA tracer uptake ratios; and it would provide improved 
prediction of response for Lu177 -PSMA over all tumor sites . 
 
Ga68 -labeled PSMA -11 (PSMA) received FDA approval in Dec. 2020 , and will be used for this 
study.  A closely -related tracer, F18 -PSMA, is also FDA approved; however, as an F18 -labeled 
tracer , it has the radioactive half -life as FDG and  would require different signal -separation 
approaches for dual -tracer imaging with FDG .  As such is not included in this  study .

 2.2.5.  Challenges of Dual -Tracer Imaging  
Currently, obtaining FDG & DOTATATE or FDG & PSMA PET images in a given patient 
requires that separate scans be performed on separate days  to allow for radioactive decay of 
the first tracer before imaging the second .  This requires the patient to go to the imaging center 
twice (particularly burdensome for patients who must travel to reach the clinic), repeat pre -scan 
procedures, and undergo separate PET exams —each with its own CT component and 
associated radiation exposure.   The time, logistical challenges, expense, and undue patient 
burden associated with bringing a patient back for separate PET scans on separate days  has 
generally blocked patients from receiving both FDG and DOTATATE or PSMA PET/CT scans —
especially considering that they also typically undergo other diagnostic procedures in the short 
time window before starting treatment.  
 
The ability to image both tracers  simultaneously  in a single  PET/CT exam would greatly improve 
the patient experience, require only a single trip to the imaging center, simplify scheduling 
demands, and reduce overhead.  It would also reduce technologist workload:  the patient would 
only need to be positioned once; only one CT scan would be needed for PET attenuation 
correction (thereby reducing radiation exposure to the patient).  In addition, the images would be 
‘natively’ co -registered since the patient remains ~motionless on the imaging table for all scans 
(frame -by-frame image co -registration may still be required in the event of patient motion while 
scanning).  Simultaneous dual -tracer imaging would also benefit the imaging clinic by greatly 
increasing throughput and improving utilization of the PET/CT scanner resource.  
 
2.2.6.  Simultaneous Dual -Tracer Imaging Technique  
These obstacles can be overcome by simultaneous dual -tracer imaging, where two tracers are 
administered to the patient and imaged in a single scan.  The resultant dual -tracer images 
would  then be processed to recover separate (corrected) images of each tracer.   MFI has 
previously studied  patented techniques for rapid sequential  dual-tracer PET imaging.  Under the 
prior Phase I project , a number of  scanning approaches  were studied for FDG+DOTATATE and 
FDG+PSMA imaging , ranging from a simultaneous multi -timepoint scans to sequential back -to-
back dynamic scans with each tracer, and evaluated the feasibility and tradeoffs of each.  It was 
found that these tracer pairs  could potentially be accurately and robustly recovered from 
simultaneous  multi -timepoint imaging as shown in Fig. 1.  Here T1 -T3 represent multi -timepoint 
“whole -body” (typically eyes -to-thighs) passes, providing images  at 3 timepoints.  Proprietary 
“signal -separation” algorithms at MFI utilize differences in radioactive decay and late tracer 
kinetics between tracers in order to process the dual -tracer images and recover separate 
(corrected) images of each tracer.   Notably, the imaging characteristics of Cu64 DOTATATE, 
Ga68 DOTATATE, and PSMA with respect to  simultaneous imaging with FDG are very similar, 
and the same  signal -separation algorithms and processing can be used.  As such, it is 
efficacious to include all three of these tracer pairs in this study.  
 
If successful, this research will demonstrate the first -ever technique for simultaneous (not 
sequential) dual -tracer PET imaging of tracer pairs that are being used clinically.

and Use  
Ga68 PSMA -11 Contraindications and Use in Specific Populations  
• Contraindications:  None.  
• Pregnancy, Lactation:  PSMA is not indicated for use in females.  
• Pediatric Use:  PSMA is not indicated for use in the pediatric population.  
• Geriatric Use:  The efficacy in safety profiles of PSMA appear similar in adult and geriatric 
patients with prostate cancer, although the number of adult patients in the trials was not large 
enough to allow definitive comparison.  
 
PSMA  Warnings and Precautions  
• Radiation risks:  Ensure safe handling to protect patients and healthcare workers from 
unintentional radiation exposure.  
• Risk for Misdiagnosis:  Ga68 PSMA -11 uptake can be seen in a variety of tumor types and in 
non-malignant processes.  Image interpretation errors can occur with Ga68 PSMA -11. 
 
PSMA  Adverse Reactions  
The most commonly reported adverse reactions include nausea, diarrhea, and dizziness.  
 
3.2.  Human Radiation Dosimetry  
The following sections summarize human radiation dosimetry for the PET/CT scans with each 
tracer.  Note that the study will be performed in three Arms , and the subjects in each Arm will 
receive a total of two PET /CT exams performed on separate days.  
 
3.2.1.  Human Radiation Dosimetry of F18 Fluorodeoxyglucose  
The amount of injected F18 FDG activity used in this protocol will be  555 MBq ( 15 mCi) , which 
is the standard institutional dose .  The radiation dosimetry estimates for F18 FDG are based on 
Publication 106 issued by The International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP ) 
[International Commission on Radiological Protection ; Radiation dose to patients from 
radiopharmaceuticals ; Addendum 4 to ICRP Publication 53 ; ICRP Publication 106 ; Feb 24, 
2014.] .  The greatest organ absorbed doses for a  555 MBq ( 15 mCi)  injection of F18 FDG are 
the bladder ( 72 mGy ) and the heart ( 37 mGy) , while the effective dose is  11 mSv.  Organ 
dosimetry and effective dose for FDG  is provided in Table s 1-3. 
 
3.2.2.  Human Radiation Dosimetry of Cu64 -DOTATATE  
The amount of injected Cu64 -DOTATATE activity used in this protocol is based on the 
recommended dose of 148 MBq (4 mCi) in the FDA product label.  Radiation dosimetry 
estimates for Cu64 -DOTATATE  are likewise based on the FDA product label , and are provided 
in Table 1.  The greatest organ absorbed doses for a 148 MBq (4 mCi) injection of Cu64-
DOTATATE are the liver (24 mGy), kidneys (21 mGy), adrenals (20 mGy), while the effective

Page 14 of 37 
 dose  is 4.7 mSv .  Organ dosimetry and effective dose for Cu64 DOTATATE  is provided in Table 
1. 
 
3.2.3.  Human Radiation Dosimetry of Ga68 -DOTATATE  
The amount of injected Ga68 -DOTATATE activity used in this protocol is based on the 
institutional dose of  185 MBq (5 mCi) , which is within recommended range of the FDA product 
label .  Radiation dosimetry estimates for Ga68 -DOTATATE  are likewise based on FDA product 
label .  The greatest organ absorbed doses for a 185 MBq (5 mCi) injection of Ga68 -DOTATATE 
are the  spleen ( 20 mGy), bladder (1 8 mGy), kidneys (1 7 mGy), and adrenals ( 16 mGy)  while the 
effective dose is 3.9 mSv .  Organ dosimetry and effective dose for Ga68 -DOTATATE  is 
provided in Table 2. 
 
3.2.4.  Human Radiation Dosimetry of Ga68 -PSMA -11 
The amount of injected Ga68 -PSMA -11 activity used in this protocol is based on the maximum 
recommended dose in the tracer label, and will be  259 MBq ( 7 mCi ).  Radiation dosimetry 
estimates for Ga68 -PSMA -11 are likewise based on the FDA product label , and are provided in 
Table s 3.  The greatest organ absorbed doses for a 259 MBq ( 7 mCi)  injection of Ga68 -PSMA -
11 are the kidneys (69 mGy), and bladder (18 mGy) , and the effective dose is 4.4 mSv . 
 
3.2.5.  Human Radiation Dosimetry for CT Scans  
CT scans are  performed as part of PET/CT scans  for both  PET attenuation correction and 
anatomic localization.  Each PET/CT exam performed in this study will include a CT scan.  
Since the subjects undergo 2 separate PET/CT exams, they will receive a total of 2 CT scans.  
 
The study will be performed on  research PET/CT scanners in the Molecular Imaging Suite at 
HCI.  The previous  scanner was a GE Discovery 710 PET/CT scanner  and was used for 
dosimetry calcuclations .  This scanner w as replaced with a United Imaging uMI 780 PET/CT 
scanner  and a uMI Panorama PET/CT .  While this does not affect the dosimetry for the PET 
tracers, it may affect dosimetry for CT scans.  The CT parameters for both new scanner s have 
been adapted  to achieve comparable dosimetry to  those specified for the current GE D710 
scanner .  A helical CT scan will be acquired from the top of the head through the knees with 
moderate dose technique for both anatomical localization and attenuation correction. The  
original GE  CT acquisition parameters for large patients receiving the greatest exposure w ere 
be 140 kVp, 0.5s rotation speed, 250 mA tube current, 64 x 1.25 mm collimation, and a pitch of 
1.35 for the helical scan. Note that smaller patients will utilize 120 kVp but dosimetry estimates 
are based on larger patients at 140 kVp. Automatic tube current modulation is used for all CT 
exams but for the purpose of estimating maximum risk, a maximum fixed tube current of 250 
mA is used for all calculations in order to provide a conservative estimate of maximum risk. In 
order to estimate the absorbed doses of individual organs and the resulting effective dose, the 
ImPACT Scan CT Patient Dosimetry Calculator (Version 1.0.4) was used with the specific 
acquisition parameters used in this protocol and the NRPB Monte Carlo dose data sets for the 
GE Lightspeed VCT scanner produced in report SR250 dosimetry tables.3 -5 A correction factor 
has been applied to account for the difference in the CT Dose index (CTDIvol) derived from 
ImPACT Calculator and that reported on the GE scanner. Note that the topogram contributes a 
negligible radiation exposure to the helical CT exam and was not included in the dose

Page 15 of 37 
 estimates. The greatest organ absorbed doses for a single helical body CT scan using the 
aforementioned acquisition parameters are bone surfaces (28 mGy) and thyroid (27 mGy), while 
the effective dose is 17 mSv (Table s 1-3). 
 
3.2.6.  Cumulative Dosimetry for PET/CT Exams in  Each Arm  
Table s 1-3 lists the individual scan dosimetry and cumulative radiation dosimetry for all PET/CT 
exams for each study Arm of the project.  Each subject will undergo two single -tracer PET/CT

DOTATATE on separate days.   A moderate dose CT scan will be performed for attenuation 
correction and anatomical localization as part of each single tracer PET/CT exam  (2 CTs total) .  
The greatest cumulative organ absorbed doses for the study are the bladder  (113 mGy) , heart 
(75 mGy) , and liver (69 mGy) , while the effective dose is 49 mSv (Table 1) .

Arm 2 (15 subjects) will receive 2 single -tracer PET/CT exams – F18 FDG and Ga68 -
DOTATATE on separate days.   A moderate dose CT scan will be performed for attenuation 
correction and anatomical localization as part of each single tracer PET/CT exam  (2 CTs total) .  
The greatest cumulative organ absorbed doses for the study are the bladder  (125 mGy) , heart 
(76 mGy) , and bone surfaces (66 mGy) , while the effective dose is 48 mSv (Table 2) .

Arm 3 (20 subjects)  will receive 2 single -tracer PET/CT exams – F18 FDG and Ga68 -PSMA -11 
on separate days.  A moderate dose CT scan will be performed for attenuation correction and 
anatomical localization as part of each single tracer PET/CT exam  (2 CTs total) .  The greatest 
cumulative organ absorbed doses for the study are the kidneys  (141 mGy) , bladder (133 mGy) ,

 Study Schema  
ScreeningAssign to 
Study ArmsSingle-Tracer
PET/CT Exam #2Single-Tracer
PET/CT Exam #1
 
The PET/CT exams may be performed in either order:  FDG first or second, 
according to scheduling considerations and at the Investigator’s discretion.  
 
4.4.1.  Initial Visit Prior to PET Imaging  
Upon enrollment in the study, the patient will be evaluated by one of the HCI oncologists with 
verification of informed consent.  The following additional patient data will be obtained: 
histological diagnosis (when available following biopsy or surgery), age, gender, and other 
treatment modalities used.   Clinical (non -research related)  PET/CT  imaging studies as acquired  
according to standard of care  will be retrieved and loaded into the research database.  
 
4.4.2.  Research PET/CT Exams  
Patients will receive two research PET/CT exams with two PET tracers:  FDG + Cu64 -
DOTATATE  (Arm 1) , FDG + Ga68 -DOTATATE  (Arm 2) , or FDG + Ga68 -PSMA -11 (Arm 3) .  
The cost of these exams will be covered by the study.  The order of the scans with each tracer 
is not important and will be determined according to scheduling considerations .  Female 
patients who are not postmenopausal for a minimum of one year, or surgically sterile, must have 
a serum pregnancy test performed within 48 hours prior to each research PET/CT exam  (Arms 
1-2 only; no females will be enrolled in Arm 3) . 
 
4.4.3.  Restrictions in 24 Hour Period  Prior to PET/CT Exams  
• FDG Scans:  Patients will be asked to minimize physical activity 24 hours prior to scans with 
FDG.  They will also be required to fast for 6 hours prior to the FDG injection.   Patients can take 
all required medications with water.  
• DOTATATE and PSMA Scans:  There are no dietary restrictions for patients prior to receiving 
PET/CT scans with these tracers.  
 
4.4.4.  Day of Study:  Single -Tracer FDG PET/CT Exam  (all Arms)  
FDG PET Tracer Administration:  
The patient will be taken to the tracer uptake room , seated comfortably,  and have the 
appropriate IV access placed for tracer administration.   The PET technologist will administe r 
approximately  15 mCi of FDG intravenously, and the patient will remain resting during the tracer 
uptake period ( 90 min. until start of PET scanning).  The patient will be encouraged to hydrate 
and void their bladder.  After the uptake period, the patient will be moved to the PET/CT 
scanner.  
 
 
Current Version:  6-17-2023  
 
Page 22 of 37 
 Topogram and CT Scan:  
Patients will be position on the scanner bed, and will be instructed to remain motionless for the 
duration of the scan.  A CT topogram will be obtained, and the PET imaging field -of-view (FOV) 
selected.   The scanner bed position will be recorded.   A CT scan for PET attenuation correction 
and anatomic localization will then be performed . 
Multi -Timepoint PET Scan:  
The PET scan will then be acquired , acquiring 5 back -to-back “whole -body” (eyes -to-thighs, or 
similar) scans, providing 5 sequential PET images.  Each pass will take approx. 10 min., for a 
total scan time of approx. 50 min.  
Patient Positioning:  
The patient position, bed position, and PET scan FOV will be recorded from the first PET/CT 
exam.  These data will be used to re -position the patient , bed, and FOV for the second PET/CT 
to match those for the first exam, as possible.  
 
4.4.5.  Day of Study:  Single -Tracer Cu64 -DOTATATE PET/CT Exam (Arm 1)  
There are no dietary restrictions for patients prior to the Cu64 -DOTATATE PET/CT exam.  
Patients will be injected with approximately 4 mCi Cu64 -DOTATATE, and the tracer uptake time 
before initiation of PET scanning will be 75 min.  All other aspects of the imaging will be identical 
to that for the FDG PET/CT scan.  
 
4.4.6.  Day of Study:  Single -Tracer Ga68 -DOTATATE PET/CT Exam (Arm 2) 
There are no dietary restrictions for patients prior to the Ga68 -DOTATATE PET/CT exam.  
Patients will be injected with approximately  5 mCi  Ga68 -DOTATATE, and the tracer uptake time 
before initiation of PET scanning will be 75 min.  All other aspects of the imaging will be identical 
to that for the FDG PET/CT scan.  
 
4.4.7.  Day of Study:  Single -Tracer PSMA PET/CT Exam (Arm 3)  
There are no dietary restrictions for patients prior to the PSMA PET/CT exam.  Patients will be 
injected with  approximately  7 mCi  Ga68 -PSMA -11, and the tracer uptake time before initiation 
of PET scanning will be 80 min.  All other aspects of the imaging will be identical to that for the 
FDG PET/CT scan.  
 
4.4.8.  After Study Procedures  
All images will be reconstructed and processed using the same parameters in order to ensure 
that there are no differences in processing.  The PET/CT images will transferred to  the research 
DICOM database , and d e-identified copie s will be delivered to MultiFunctional Imaging  LLC for 
processing and analysis  according to the Specific Aims of the grant R44CA257522 -02.

 5.0 METHODS FOR ASSESSMENT  OF PET IMAG ES 
 
The PET images for each tracer will be evaluated using qualitative visual assessment and semi -
quantitative analysis techniques that have previously been used by us and other groups, and 
represent the standard and accepted means of evaluating static PET images.  These 
assessments will be performed by investigators at HCI, and are described below.  
 
5.1.  Qualitative Visual Assessment s 
 
Visual assessment  of the images for each tracer  will be used to qualitatively assess for 
abnormal focal tracer uptake throughout the imaged body .  Images  will be reviewed in an 
unblinded manner to assess whether additional lesions are found when comparing with prior 
imaging.   The coordinates of abnormal foci of uptake will be recorded and semi -quantitative 
assessments of these lesions will be computed as described below.  
 
5.2.  Semi -Quantitative Assessment s 
 
Tracer  uptake in each lesion  identified in the qualitative visual analysis  will be quantified  by 
calculating body -weight -corrected Standardized Uptake Values (SUV bw) as follows:  
 
 
  
where   
  radioactive concentration  (mCi /mL) 
  
  body weight  BW (g)  
 
Corrections for lean body mass will also be performed to calculate the SUVlean as follows:  
  
 SUVlean = (LBM/BW) X SUVbw  
 
where  SUVbw = the SUV measurements using body -weight corrections  
  LBM = the lean body mass estimated from the Janahasastian Formula  [98] 
 
A region -of-interest (ROI) will be drawn over the lesions (on all image  slices with abnormal 
uptake).  The mean value in each ROI will be computed to obtain the  SUV mean for each tracer, 
and the maximum value in each ROI will be computed to obtain the SUV max for each tracer.  
 
The location, ROI, SUV mean, and SUV max for each lesion will be recorded and used for data 
analysis.

6.0 DATA ANALYSIS AND STATISTICS  
 
The d e-identified images with marked lesion location s will be provided to MFI for further analysis 
according to the aims of grant 2R44CA257522.  The imaging data will be used to develop  dual-
tracer PET scanning protocols and new processing algorithms for imaging FDG + Cu64 -
DOTATATE, FDG + Ga68 -DOTATE, and FDG + Ga68 -PSMA -11.  Since a dual -tracer PET 
image is essentially the sum of two single -tracer PET images, this research will make use of the 
synthesized dual -tracer evaluation technique summarized below . 
 
6.1.  Synthesized Dual -Tracer Evaluation Technique  
One challenge of evaluating rapid multi -tracer PET techniques is the need to know the ground 
truth when evaluating results.  For example, one possible study design would be to obtain 
separate, single -tracer scans with each tracer on separate days, and then to obtain 
simultaneous dual -tracer scans on a 3rd day —all in the same patient.  Here the separate -scan 
images of each tracer could be used as the standard for evaluating images of each tracer 
recovered from the dual -tracer scans.  However, such an approach would pose many problems, 
in particular:  (1) high cost, scheduling challenges, and patient compliance issues for performing 
3 different PET/CT exams on 3 different days; (2) increased radiation exposure from 3 PET/CT 
exams (3 CTs and 4 total PET tracer administrations); (3) test -retest variability for PET is on the 
order of 10 -15% [99-101]—differences that can be larger than the errors in recovered dual -
tracer images  and thus limit the value of the study ; and (4) it would only allow for a single dual -
tracer scanning protocol to be studied (rather than allowing for various scanning protocols to be 
studied and compared) . 
 
A better and widely -accepted approach, used by our group and others [2-8, 10 -13] is to acquire 
separate, single -tracer PET scans with each tracer and then retroactively combine the images 
to “synthesize” dual -tracer images which are ~identical to the images that would have been 
obtained from actual dual -tracer scanning.  When more than one PET tracer is present during a 
scan, the resulting image represents the sum of all tracer present.  As such, the images from 
separate, single -tracer PET scans can be added together to create “synthesized”  multi -tracer 
PET images.  Aside from small differences in scanner deadtime and random coincidence rates 
(which are well -understood and accurately corrected by the PET scanner), such synthesized 
dual-tracer images accurately mimic actual multi -tracer PET images, which characteristics that 
closely match what would have been obtained from actual multi -tracer scanning.  
 
The advantage of this approach is that the actual single -tracer components of the resulting dual -
tracer images are known exactly — and they can be used to evaluate the accuracy of individual -
tracer images recovered from the multi -tracer images.  In effect, the data become their own 
controls  when using this approach.

 6.2.  Dual - vs. Single -Tracer Performance Assessment s 
 
The PET images for each tracer pair will be co -registered and combined to synthesize 
corresponding dual -tracer images.   Dual-tracer processing algorithms, based on modeling 
differences in radioactive decay rates and kinetic distributions for each tracer, will be developed 
that take simultaneous dual -tracer PET images as input and out separate, recovered images of 
each individual tracer.  The performance of the dual -tracer scanning approach and processing 
algorithms will be evaluated by comparing  output images for each tracer to the corresponding 
original single -tracer images for that tracer.  A number of analyses will be performed on these 
data.  
 
In the following paragraphs, “recovered” is used to denote measures ( image pix el values, SUVs) 
for individual -tracer images recovered from the dual -tracer images, and “true” is used to denote 
the corresponding value from the original constituent single -tracer image.   This analysis 
evaluates how accurately the simultaneous dual -tracer imaging technique can recover individual 
images of each tracer, as compared to the images from conventional single -tracer scans . 
 
6.2.1.  Qualitative Visual Assessments  
The images of each tracer recovered from the dual -tracer images as processed and output by 
the new dual -tracer processing algorithms  will be visually assessed side -by-side with the 
original “true” single -tracer images.  Tracer uptake throughout the body will be visually assessed 
for the presence of any artifacts, and regions of abnormal focal tracer uptake will be identified 
and compared for differences between the recovered and “true” images for each tracer.  Any 
artifacts or differences in visual lesions will be marked and documented, and any such 
differences will be evaluated for any potential effect on the clinical interpretation of the images.  
All lesions identified will be marked, and quantitative analyses for each will be performed as 
described below.  
 
6.2.2.  Quantitative Performance Measures  
Pixelwise  Linear Regression  Analysis:   The overall accuracy of image pixels for each tracer 
will be measured by performing linear regression analysis for recovered vs. true image pixel 
values over all image pixels.  This will be computed for each tracer for each patient.  The 
regression slope, intercept, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient will be used as measures of 
bias between the recovered and true image pixels.  
 
Linear Regression Analysis of ROIs:   The accuracy of ROI values for lesions and normal 
background tissues will also be measured using linear regression analysis of the recovered vs. 
true values.  The regression slope, intercept, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient will be used 
as measures of bias between the recovered and true ROI values.  
 
6.2.3.  Quantitative Performance Targets  
The following quantitative performance targets have been set in order to conclude that the new 
simultaneous dual -tracer techniques provide images of each tracer that are equivalent to 
images that would be obtained from separate, single -tracer scans of each tracer : 
(1) dual -vs.-single  correlation coefficients  0.95 for both image voxels and lesion SUVs ; 
Current Version:  6-17-2023  
 
Page 26 of 37 
 (2) bias, as measured by the linear regression slope, to be within 5% of 1.0 (0.95  slope  
1.05);  
(3) bias, as measured by the linear regression intercept , to be within 5%  (of mean voxel or SUV 
value)  of zero; and  
(4) tumor and background tissue SUVs  for dual -tracer  images within 0.05 of those  for the 
separate -scan standard image s (to 95% power).  
These analyses will be repeated for all 3 tracer pairs.  
 
6.3.  Justification of Sample Size  
The following sample  size calculations are based on testing the hypothesis that differences in 
SUV mean for lesions and normal tissue regions  in images recovered from dual -tracer scanning 
for each tracer are less than 5% different than those from the single -tracer “standard” images, 
using a 2 sided t-test with alpha = 0.05 and desired power = 0.95 .  We also assume a standard 
deviation of 10% for SUV mean measurements (based on PET test -retest variability).  This gives a 
required sample size of N = 104 .  Assuming 5 -7 regions/ lesions  per subject, this gives 15 -20 
subjects needed to obtain the desired statistical power, which supports our design of 15 -20 
patients each for each study Arm . 
 
The study design and data analysis techniques were reviewed and approved by the NIH study 
section for grant 2R44CA257522, and no issues or concerns were noted.  
 
7.0 REGULATORY AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS  
7.1.  Human Subject Protections  
The study will be conducted in accordance with the appropriate FDA, IRB, ICH GCP, and other 
federal and local regulatory requirements, as applicable. Informed consent will be obtained from 
all research participants prior to performing any study procedures using the most recent IRB -
approved version. All patients must be at least 18 years of age to participate.  
 
7.2.  Institutional Review  
Before study initiation, the investigator must have written and dated approval/favorable opinion 
from the IRB for the protocol, consent form, subject recruitment materials (e .g., advertisements), 
and any other applicable patient -facing documents.   The investigator or designee should 
provide the IRB with reports, updates and other information ( e.g., expedited safety reports, 
amendments, and administrative letters) according to regulatory requirements or institution 
procedures . 
 
7.3.  Data and Safety Monitoring Plan  
As this study will be using FDA -approved radiopharmaceuticals , monitoring by the Huntsman 
Cancer Institute Data Safety and Monitoring Committee is not required. This study will be 
reported and monitored by the Principal Investigator using the ERICA and OnCore.  Any serious 
adverse events that occur during the study will be reported to the IRB. The PI will review data 
Current Version:  6-17-2023  
 
Page 27 of 37 
 and documentation on a monthly basis with the clinical research manager and data research 
coordinator.  
 
7.4.  Protocol Amendments  
Any amendments or administrative changes in the research protocol during the period, for which 
the IRB approval has already been given, will not be initiated without submission of an 
amendment for IRB review and approval.  
These requirements for approval will in no way prevent any immediate action from being taken 
by the investigator in the interests of preserving the safety of all patients included in the trial.  
 
7.5.  Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation (or violation) is any departure from the defined procedures and treatment 
plans as outlined in the protocol version submitted and previously approved by the IRB.  
Protocol deviations have the potential to place participants at risk and can also undermine the 
scientific integrity of the study thus jeopardizing the justification for the research.  Protocol 
deviations are unplanned and unintentional events.  
Because some protocol deviations pose no conceivable threat to participant safety or scientific 
integrity, reporting is left to the discretion of the PI within the context of the guidelines below.  
The IRB requires the prompt reporting  of protocol deviations which are:  
• Exceptions to eligibility criteria.  
• Intended to eliminate apparent immediate hazard to a research participant or  
• Harmful (caused harm to participants or others, or place them at increased risk of harm – 
including physical, psychological, economic, or social harm), or  
• Possible serious or continued noncompliance.

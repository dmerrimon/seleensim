PROTOCOL SYNOPSIS  
Protocol Title:  Blood Loss in Arthroplasty with Oral Versus IV Tranexamic Acid  
Protocol Number:  2019_ 0882  
Protocol Date:  3/8/2022  
Sponsor:  Department of Anesthesiology  
Principal Investigator:  Stavros Memtsoudis, MD PhD  
Objective:  Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic medication used to 
reduce bleeding in a variety of medical settings. The use of TXA 
in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee arthroplasty (TKA) 
has resulted in dramatic decreases in operative blood loss and 
transfusion rates, revolutionizing the field of arthroplasty. The 
use of TXA, now common, has made aut ologous blood donation 
programs largely obsolete. Additionally, it has made 
perioperative blood transfusion uncommon. While AAOS 
guidelines suggest that all three available preparations of TXA 
(oral, IV, topical) are effective, preferred route of dosing va ries 
by provider and institution. These preferences are based on 
habit, understanding of pharmacodynamics, and logistical issues 
regarding effective dosing. Oral TXA is the cheapest option, but 
some surgeons prefer IV dosing due to concerns regarding 
efficacy and controlled dosing. In this study, we seek to compare 
the efficacy of a single pre -operative oral dose of TXA to a 
single pre -operative IV dose of TXA.  
Study Design:  Randomized controlled clinical trial  
Enrollment:  400 
Subject Criteria:  
 1. Patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA) through a 
posterior approach  
2. Patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA)  
3. Patients between the ages of 18 -80

1.0 INTRODUCTION  
 
 The interventions to be studied are oral and IV tranexamic acid. The conditions to be 
studied are blood loss and transfusion rat e. 
 
 Tranexamic acid (TXA) is an antifibrinolytic medication used to reduce bleeding in a 
variety of medical settings. The use of TXA in total hip arthroplasty (THA) and total knee 
arthroplasty (TKA) has resulted in dramatic decreases in ope rative blood loss and 
transfusion rates, revolutionizing the field of arthroplasty. The use of TXA, now common, 
has made autologous blood donation programs largely obsolete. Additionally, it has made 
perioperative blood transfusion uncommon. While AAOS gui delines suggest that all three 
available preparations of TXA (oral, IV, topical) are effective, preferred route of dosing varies 
by provider and institution. These preferences are based on habit, understanding of 
pharmacodynamics, and logistical issues reg arding effective dosing. Oral TXA is the 
cheapest option, but some surgeons prefer IV dosing due to concerns regarding efficacy 
and controlled dosing. In this study, we seek to compare the efficacy of a single pre -
operative oral dose of TXA to a single pre -operative IV dose of TXA.  
 
 The standard oral TXA dose is 2g and costs about $2 per dose. The standard IV 
TXA dose is 1g and costs about $4 per dose (plus the cost of extra equipment such as 
syringes). Some surgeons prefer IV over oral TXA because it has rapid onset and the 
dosing can be easily timed with regard to incision. Oral TXA, on the other hand, would have 
to be taken at some time prior to surgery since its peak plasma concentration is achieved 3 
hours after administration (Pilbrant, PMID 73082 75). With oral dosing, operating room 
delays could potentially mean that the peak effect of oral TXA would not coincide with 
surgery. The benefits of giving oral rather than IV TXA include a significant cost savings and 
not having to administer an IV medic ation. A recent meta -analysis (Wang, PMID 30200167) 
showed similar blood loss and transfusion rate in patients given oral TXA vs IV TXA.  
 
 Data and guidelines suggest no functional difference between oral and IV TXA use 
(Della Valle PMID 29805106). Prior w ork has investigated oral and IV TXA head -tohead 
(Kayupov PMID 28244907, Fillingham, PMID 27113948), finding equivalent reductions in 
blood loss but with great cost savings for oral TXA. This study will attempt to corroborate 
these findings. However, it wi ll also function as a feasibility study in investigating whether 
oral TXA can effectively be administered consistently in a pre -operative setting.

2.0 OBJECTIVE (S) OF CLINICAL STUDY   
  
Primary questions  
1. Does oral TXA dosing in THA/TKA result in more blood loss compared to IV TXA dosing? 
2. Does oral TXA dosing in THA/TKA result in more transfusions compared to IV TXA 
dosing?  
Secondary question  
3. Does oral TXA dosing in THA/TKA result in longer lengt h-of-stay (LOS) after THA/TKA 
compared to IV TXA dosing?  
If we further establish that oral TXA can effectively be administered prior to surgery with 
comparable results to IV TXA, it could potentially shift use away from IV toward oral dosing. 
This would cr eate an enormous cost savings for our hospital (estimated between $100,000 
and $200,000) and might make perioperative workflows function more smoothly, as well.

6.1 Intraoperative  Protocol  
 
Two blocked, 1:1 patient randomization schedules  (one for THA and one for TKA 
patients) will be created using SASsoftware by a biostatistician not otherwise involved 
in the trial. Randomization cards will be sealed in opaque  envelopes and given to the 
anesthesiologist once the patient consents.  
 
A total  of 400 patients will be enrolled, 200 THA patients and 200 TKA patients.  
 
200 THA (posterior approach) patients will be randomized to receive either:  
Oral TXA (1950mg) in holding area (N=100)  
IV TXA 1g upon transfer to OR (N=100)

will calculate CBL according to all 4 methods described by Gao and plan to use the Hb -
balance equations, since it is thought to be most reliable. We will compare the 4 CBL 
calculations as well as EBL to assess the validity of our CBL calculat ions

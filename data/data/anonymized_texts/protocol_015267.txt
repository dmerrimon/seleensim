 Brief description of the Research Project  
Standing and walking are almost always completed in unison with other cognitive tasks such as talking, 
reading or making decisions. The ability to perform this important type of “dual tasking” is critical to 
daily activities and dependent upon one’s capaci ty to effectively activate appropriate brain networks 
that include the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC). Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) 
is a safe, noninvasive technology that can selectively modulate brain excitability (i.e., the  likelihood of 
activation) by passing low -level currents between electrodes placed upon the scalp. We have 
demonstrated through a series of studies that a single, 20 -minute exposure of ‘conventional’ tDCS 
targeting the left dlPFC —administered via two large  sponge electrodes —reduces dual task costs to 
metrics of standing postural control and gait, when tested immediately following stimulation. Still, we 
and others have also observed relatively high between -subject variability in the effects of this 
conventio nal bipolar form of tDCS. We contend that this variability in effectiveness arises in part from 
relatively diffuse and unspecific current flow when using large sponge electrodes, in combination with 
individual variability in head and brain anatomy that sig nificantly alters current flow and the generated 
electric field in the target brain region. In this project, we will 1) apply recent advances in tDCS modeling 
and administration to model the electric fields generated by conventional  tDCS in older adults us ing 
their individual structural brain MRIs , and 2) develop and test an multi -channel tDCS montage designed 
to optimize current flow to the left dlPFC (i.e., ‘optimized’ tDCS) . Our Specific Aim is to examine the 
immediate after -effects of conventional  tDCS,  optimized  tDCS, and sham stimulation on dual task 
standing and walking in older adults. Our study population will be older men and women without overt 
disease or illness, yet with poor baseline dual task performance defined as a dual task cost (i.e., 
redu ction) to gait speed of at least 10%  induced by simultaneously performing a serial subtraction task 
when walking. We hypothesize that across participants, the effect of conventional  tDCS on dual task 
standing and walking performance will correlate with a specific component of the electric field 
generated over the left dlPFC target. We also hypothesize that optimized  tDCS will induce A) greater 
effects on dual task standing and walking performance as compared to conventional  tDCS and sham 
stimulation, and B ) these effects will be more consistent across individuals as compared to conventional  
tDCS. This project will provide important insights into tDCS “dosage” that will enable us and many other 
researchers to better understand, control, and optimize this for m of noninvasive brain stimulation to 
individual head and brain anatomy. It is also expected to demonstrate that optimized  tDCS, as compared 
to the conventional approach, significantly improves the size and consistency of observed benefits to 
dual task sta nding and walking in vulnerable older adults . 
 
 
Background and rationale for the research  
 
Dual tasking is essential to mobility and dependent upon cognitive -motor brain networks. Standing and 
walking are almost always completed in unison with cognitive tasks such as talking or making decisions. 
Such dual tasking disrupts standing and walking in older adults,1-10 and those with relatively high dual 
task costs report worse functional capacity11,12 and perform worse on tests of mobility13 and executive 
func tion.14-16 Moreover, older adults —even in the absence of overt neurological disease —who walk >18 -
20% slower when performing a serial subtraction cognitive task, as compared to walking quietly, are 
more likely to fall9,16 and suffer cognitive decline17 in the future.  
 
Observed dual tasks costs suggest that some older adults are unable to effectively activate the brain 
networks required to maintain performance in both tasks.18-20 fMRI, EEG and functional near -infrared 
spectroscopy (fNIRS) studies indicate tha t standing and walking, especially when dual tasking, activate 
3 
 the prefrontal cortices.21-31 Studies using fNIRS during standing and walking indicate that when 
compared to normal conditions, walking while performing verbalized serial subtractions increases  
prefrontal cortex activation,21-27 particularly within the left hemisphere.29-32 Moreover, older adults who 
exhibit greater increases in left prefrontal activation when dual tasking tend to exhibit lower dual task 
costs.30,31 
 
fMRI evidence indicates that  performing two non -motor cognitive tasks together —as compared to 
performing them separately —activates additional brain regions specifically within the left dlPFC.33,34 
Moreover, the left dlPFC is particularly activated during performance of cognitive task s that require both 
working memory and verbal processing.35-39 We thus contend that while the control of standing and 
walking likely calls upon the bilateral dlPFC and its connected neural networks, the left dlPFC is 
important to one’s ability to safely st and and walk while completing cognitive tasks that require 
verbalization —an ability central to daily living activities.  
 
tDCS holds promise for improved dual tasking in older adults.  tDCS induces low amplitude current flow 
between electrodes placed upon th e scalp.40,41 Generated electric fields polarize neuronal populations 
and modulate cortical excitability.42,43 While the effects of tDCS on cortical excitability depend upon 
electrode size, polarity and placement, as well as current amplitude and duration,40 20 minutes of 
anodal (i.e., excitatory) tDCS increases excitability within target regions for up to 4 hours.44,45 
Conventional , bipolar tDCS using sponges to target the left dlPFC by placing the anode over the F3 
region of the 10 -20 EEG placement system  and the cathode over the contralateral supraorbital margin. 
It has been shown to improve performance in cognitive tasks requiring attention,46 working memory47-50 
decision making,51 and non -motor cognitive dual tasking52,53 in younger and/or older adults,  when tested 
immediately following stimulation. Our team has published a series of studies indicating that this form 
of tDCS improves metrics of dual task standing and walking in cohorts of healthy younger adults,54 
healthy older adults,55 and in older adu lts with functional limitations and “at -risk” dual task costs56. 
 
This project will combine brain imaging, advanced current flow modeling and state -of-the-art 
instrumentation to understand and optimize tDCS as a therapeutic strategy.  Despite benefits to du al 
tasking at the group level, we have observed that the effects of tDCS tend to vary considerably across 
older adults —and observation ubiquitous to tDCS research to date.40,57 -59 We contend that a significant 
portion of this variability stems from an inab ility to ensure that, due to interpersonal differences and the 
use of large sponge electrodes, the desired electrical fields actually reach the desired brain locations in a 
controlled manner.60-62 Moreover, this concern is amplified for older adults, as th ere is high inter -
individual variance in skin, skull, brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) anatomy, and each of these factors 
influence current flow.  
 
In this project we will establish the relationship between the electric field generated by conventional , 
sponge -based tDCS and its effect on dual task performance. In doing so, we will provide first -of-it-kind 
insight into the degree of inter -subject variability in generated electric field in older adults, as well as the 
component(s) of this field that underli e observed functional benefits. We have hypothesized, based 
upon the evidence described above, that 1) when using conventional  tDCS, the average nE over the left 
dlPFC ‘drives’ observed dual tasking improvements, and therefore, 2) multichannel tDCS that op timizes 
flow to this region will maximize benefit and reduce variance. If these hypotheses are supported, our 
project will establish a methodology and analytical pipeline to understand, control, and optimize tDCS 
dosage —a discovery with significant applica tions to our work and that of the entire field of noninvasive 
brain stimulation. If our hypotheses are not supported, our electric field mapping approach will 
nevertheless produce an invaluable dataset from which voxel -based and other computational and 
4 
 statistical approaches may be used to test additional hypotheses to advance our understanding and 
optimization of tDCS.

Previous Studies  leading up to and supporting the proposed research  
 
Single sessions of convention al tDCS targeting the left dlPFC reduce dual task costs and improve 
mobility: In multiple separate but related studies, we studied healthy younger adults (22±2yrs),71 
healthy  older adults (69±5yrs),55 and older adults with slow gait and executive dysfunction 
(81±10yrs).56All participants completed two visits. On each visit, standing and walking were 
assessed with and without simultaneous performance of a serial subtraction tas k, before and 
after a 20 -minute session of convention al tDCS targeting the left dlPFC on one visit, and sham 
stimulation on the other visit, in random order. In all three cohorts, stimulation did not alter 
standing posture or gait under single task conditi ons. However, during dual tasking, tDCS reduced 
postural sway speed and area when standing, and increased gait speed when walking (p<0.01). 
Thus, only tDCS reduced the dual task cost (i.e., percent change from single to dual tasking) to 
these outcomes (swa y speed: p<0.1; sway elliptical area: p<0.02; gait speed: p<0.01). Together, 
these data give us confidence that convention al tDCS designed to increase left dlPFC excitability 
enhances dual task performance across individuals who range widely in both age an d functional 
capacity.  
 
The immediate after -effects of convention al tDCS on dual task walking performance are 
beneficial yet relatively variable across older adults with high baseline dual task costs to gait 
speed. We extracted data from all older adult pa rticipants described in the previous section who 
had “at -risk” baseline dual task costs to gait speed of >20% despite no overt disease or illness 
(n=20; 12 women; dual task cost μ±σ=26±13%; age=75±6 years). Convention al tDCS targeting the 
left dlPFC reduce d the dual task cost to gait speed in all but one participant, and at the group 
level, significantly reduced this outcome as compared to sham stimulation (p=0.002). While the 
mean absolute pre -to-post change in dual task cost from pre -to-post tDCS was 12 p ercentage 
points, the standard deviation of change was 10 with a range of 35. These data demonstrate that 
1) we can recruit older adults with poor dual task performance, 2) convention al tDCS holds 
promise to improve dual task performance in these vulnerable individuals, and 3) the effects of 
tDCS, while beneficial, are quite variable across individuals.  
 
The degree to which convention al tDCS is “on -target” correlates with dual task improvements, 
yet varies across participants. We completed a pilot RCT in which 20 older adults with slow gait 
and mild -to-moderate executive dysfunction, yet who were without overt disease or illness, were 
randomized to a 2 - week, 10 -session convention al tDCS intervention targeting the left dlPFC 
([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]).56 tDCS, c ompared to sham, reduced dual task costs to gait speed and postural 
sway speed, and improved cognition as assessed by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), 
at a two -week follow -up (p<0.05). Twelve participants also completed a baseline structural brain  
MRI. Six of these were then randomized to tDCS. We used Stimweaver with each MRI to model 
generated electric fields based upon the electrode placement and flow parameters used for the 
intervention. The normal component of the electric field (nE) averaged over the left dlPFC varied 
considerably, and, correlated closely with reduced dual task costs to gait speed at follow -up 
(r2=0.80, p<0.05). In contrast, the nE over the right dlPFC did not correlate with dual task changes 
(not shown). These data give us co nfidence that the left dlPFC is an important target for dual task 
performance, and optimizing  tDCS will likely maximize its effectiveness and reduce inter -subject 
variability.  
11 
  
Research Importance  and how it will contribute to existing knowledge  
This proj ect is significant because it will combine brain imaging, advanced current flow modeling and 
state -of-the-art instrumentation to understand and optimize tDCS as a therapeutic strategy. In this 
project we will establish the relationship between the electric  field generated by convention al, sponge -
based tDCS and its effect on dual task performance. In doing so, we will provide first -of-it-kind insight 
into the degree of inter -subject variability in generated electric field in older adults, as well as the 
comp onent(s) of this field that underlie observed functional benefits.  
 
We propose to test a noninvasive and safe intervention, namely tDCS, to improve dual task 
performance —an important factor on the causal pathway to functional decline in older adults. Our 
approach is innovative in several ways.  
 
We will use advanced tDCS technology to deliver optimized  interventions.  Our collaborator, Dr. Ruffini, 
has developed a method called Stimweaver to optimize multichannel tDCS montages.63,64 This method 
calculates tD CS electric fields (including components normal and tangential to the cortical boundaries) 
using a multi -layer finite element model of a realistic head derived from individual’s structural MRI. 
Here, we will use Stimweaver to  model and study the electric fields generated by convention al tDCS  and 
optimized tDCS. . 
 
In addition to sponge -based sham, we will employ an optimized sham protocol to maximize blinding and 
minimize staff bias to intervention.  The proposed project will compare —using a within -subject design — 
convention al tDCS delivered via sponges with optimized  tDCS delivered via an array of eight gel 
electrodes. Each participant will thus also be exposed to two different sham interventions. First, we will 
implement a convention al sponge -based sham pr otocol in which tDCS will be delivered for a short 
period of time before it is “ramped” down to zero for the remainder of the session57. This “inactive” 
sham was adopted because cutaneous sensations associated with tDCS diminish quickly.69,70 Second, we 
will implement a n optimized  gel-electrode -based “active” sham in which the Stimweaver optimization 
algorithm will be used with the objective of creating a null electric field on the target (left dlPFC) with 
the constraint that some electrodes deliver low -level currents that still induce cutaneous sensations. 
This method creates similar cutaneous sensations and skin redness as tDCS so that putative peripheral 
effects are present in both. Our group has used this method successfully for double blinding and it ha s 
produced no behavioral effects.66 
Study Objectives, Aims and Hypotheses  
We propose a randomized, double -blinded, ‘within -subject’ study design to test the effects of optimized  
and convention al tDCS. We will obtain complete datasets on 30 women and men aged 65 -85 years who 
exhibit “at  risk” dual task costs to gait speed (i.e., > 10%  reduction), yet without dementia or other overt 
neurological or musculoskeletal disease. Anatomical and functional  MRIs of the head will be o ptional.  
Participants will  complete four visits separated by one week, during which they will receive one of four 
20-minute interventions in random order: convention al tDCS and sham stimulation using sponge 
electrodes, and optim ized tDCS and an “active” sham stimulation using gel electrodes (further described 
below). Dual tasking will be tested before stimulation, after stimulation, and again one hour 
later.   Primary outcomes will be dual task cost to gait speed when walking, and  postural sway speed 
when standing. Secondary outcomes will include single and dual task metrics of standing and walking 
separately, as well as cognitive task performance within the dual task paradigm.   
 
12 
 Specific Aim: To conduct a “within -subject” cross -over study to determine the acute effects of single 
sessions of optimized  tDCS, convention al tDCS, and sham stimulation on dual task standing and walking 
in 30 older adults who are free of overt disease yet who present with poor baseline dual task 
performance.  
 
Hypothesis 1: Across participants, the effect of convention al tDCS on dual task standing and walking 
performance will significantly correlate with the average of the nE component over the left dlPFC.  
 
Hypothesis 2: Optimized  tDCS will induce A) greater improvements on dual task standing and walking 
performance as compared to convention al tDCS and both sham conditions, and B) these effects will be 
more consistent across individuals as compared to convention al tDCS.  
Study Design  
We will conduct a “within -subject,” double -blinded, randomized controlled study comparing the 
after -effects of single sessions of convention al tDCS, optimized  tDCS, and two different sham 
conditions on dual task performance in men and women aged 65 -85 years with poor baseline dual 
task performance. Participants will  have the option to  complete a structural and functional  brain 
MRI. They will complete four visits during which they will receive one of the four interventions in 
random order. Visits will be separated by on e week to ensure washout of tDCS effects on brain 
physiology. Dual tasking will be tested before tDCS, after tDCS and again one hour later.  
Study Duration (total)   
One year  
Study Duration for participants  
Up to 8 weeks  
 
Participant Selection  
Participants  will be recruited from the Boston area community, senior housing facilities in urban and 
suburban areas, research recruitment repositories including the "Mobility and Brain Function" 
repository, multiple clinics at the BIDMC, and advertisements within reg ional media outlets and website 
posting (IFAR and clinicaltrials.gov ).  
We aim to obtain complete datasets in 30 participants. We expect to enroll 36 individuals to achieve this 
aim.  
Inclusion criteria  
 Men and women aged 65 -85 years;  
 Poor dual task performance, defined as a preferred gait speed that is > 10%  slower when walking 
and simultaneously performing verbalized serial subtractions (i.e., dual tasking), as compared to 
walking normally (i.e. single tasking).  
Exclusion criteria  
 Unwillingness to c ooperate or participate in the study protocol;  
 An inability to walk or stand for 30 continuous seconds without an assistive device;  
 A diagnosis of a gait disorder, Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, multiple 
13 
 sclerosis, previous stroke or  other neurodegenerative disorder,  
 Self-report of acute illness, injury or other unstable medical condition;  
 Any report of severe lower -extremity arthritis or pain, physician -diagnosis of peripheral 
neuropathy, or other peripheral neuromuscular disease tha t may confound the effects of tDCS 
on gait or postural control;  
 Use of antipsychotics, anti -seizure, benzodiazepines, or other neuroactive medications;  
 Severe depression defined by a Geriatric Depression Scale score greater than 11;  
 Any report or physician -diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or other psychiatric illness;  
 
Participant Recruitment  
We have full confidence that we can enroll 36 participants and obtain at least 30 compete datasets on 
individuals that meet the stated inclusion and exclu sion criteria. We anticipate needing to conduct 
approximately 180 phone screens and 108 in -person screens, as our past experiences recruiting similar 
cohorts suggest a third of these individuals will be interested, eligible and enrolled in the study. We wi ll 
aim to recruit a cohort of older men and women that is representative of the older population living in 
the greater Boston Metropolitan area. We will do so by taking advantage of extensive research 
recruitment repositories, our close connections with cl inical programs and large housing facilities within 
both urban and suburban areas, and advertisements within regional media outlets. We will implement 
several strategies to minimize burden and maximize retention and compliance: we will develop personal 
relationships between participants and study staff, schedule appointments at convenient times, give 
reminders for each visit, provide food and beverages when appropriate, and compensate participants 
for their time. IFAR has dedicated on -site parking for study  participants.  
Obtaining Informed Consent  
Interested individuals will be asked to provide verbal consent to complete initial eligibility screen during 
a phone conversation with study personnel. Potentially eligible participants will then schedule an in-
person screening procedure. Potential participants may be emailed or snail -mailed (per request, and 
according to their preference) a copy of the informed consent for them to review at their own pace prior 
to the in -person screening. Written informed con sent will be obtained by study personnel at the 
beginning of this in -person screening procedure.  
Withdrawal of Participants  
If during the course of their study enrollment, a participant develops a new medical condition that 
would make participation in the study contraindicated, as determined by a study physician (Dr. Lipsitz), 
the participant will be informed of this and withdrawn from the study. All data collected prior to 
withdrawal will be maintained in the study data set.  
Study Procedures  
Visit 1—screening: baseline functional characterization: Individuals deemed potentially eligible via 
phone screening will complete an in -person screen. They will read and sign an informed consent form 
approved by the Hebrew SeniorLife IRB. A medical history ques tionnaire will be completed and 
medications, blood pressure, height, body mass and years of education will be recorded. A brief dual 
task assessment will be conducted in which participants complete two, 30 -second trials of walking at 
preferred speed: one n ormally (i.e., single task) and another while performing verbalized serial 
subtractions of 3s from 500 (i.e., dual task). Participants will be eligible if their average gait speed is 
≥10%  slower when dual tasking than single tasking. Individuals who meet a ll eligibility criteria will be 
14 
 enrolled.  
 
Enrolled participants  will then complete several tests to characterize relevant aspects of cognition, 
mobility, mood, and physical activity, as follows.  
 
Cognition  will be assessed with a 60 -65min battery of tests  that are correlated with dual tasking 
(1,6,15,72,73), functional capacity (6,72), and/or falls (16,73). All tests have excellent psychometric 
properties and normative data covering the range of demographic characteristics of our proposed 
sample, with mini mal ceiling and floor effects. Cognitive tests  will include  
 Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) of global cognitive function (74,75)  
 Trail Making Test (A and B) of executive function (i.e., speeded visual search, vigilance and set -
shifting) (76)  
 WAIS -IV Digit Span (Forwards, Backwards) test of working memory (77)  
 WAIS -IV Coding test of sustained attention and motor speed (78)   
 Category and Phonemic Fluency tests of semantic knowledge and word retrieval (79)  
 Hopkins Verbal Learning Test – Revised (HVLT -R) of verbal episodic memory (80)  
 Gradual -Onset Continuous Performance Task (gradCPT) - a highly valid and reliable computer 
test to examine one’s sustained attention. We propose to add the gradCPT in our existing 
protocol to help understanding the interplay b etween attention and gait in older adults.   
 
Mobility  will be assessed with the following tests:   
 the timed up -and-go (TUG (81) which requires the participant to stand up from a chair, walk 
three meters, turn around, walk back and sit down. The average time to complete two trials will 
be recorded. This test has high test -retest reliability and discriminant validity in older adults 
(82,83)  
 Short physical performance battery (SPPB) - includes measures of standing balance, four -meter 
walking speed, and abil ity and time to rise from a chair five times.  
Self-report of mood, pain, physical activity and function  will be assessed as each influences clinical 
tests of physical and cognitive function:   
 Mood will be assessed with the  Center of Epidemiology Studies -Depression Scale Revised (CESD -
R) scale (86) which has been used extensively in epidemiology studies and consists of 20 
questions regarding feelings of depression, loneliness, energy level, and fear. The CESD -R has 
high internal consistency (r=0.90) and a te st-retest reliability of 0.51 (87).  
 Self-reported physical activity will be assessed with the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly 
(PASE) (88).  
 Cognitive Reserve Questionnaire - a metric of education and intellectual activities pursued 
throughout one's lifetime.  
 Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) - used to measure location and severity of bodily pain, as well as the 
impact of pain on general well -being.  
 Falls Questionnaire - used to track the number of falls participants have had in the past 6 
months.  
 Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) - a measure of depression in older adults.  
 
Visit 2  (optional) —Functional and Structural MRI: Baseline MRIs will enable current flow modeling, 
which considers silent infarcts, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), and functional conn ectivity. T1, 
T2, T2 - weighted fluid -attenuated inversion recovery (T2 FLAIR), and resting -state functional scans will 
be completed on a 3T GE system with a quadrature head coil at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical 
Center. Two T1 datasets will be acquired : one with fat -suppression to optimize brain and CSF 
15 
 segmentation and another one without it to optimize skull and skin segmentation. Field -of-view will 
encompass all the head with coverage up to C1/2 vertebrae and without head cropping. Silent brain 
infarc ts will be identified as focal lesions appearing hyperintense on T2 and hypo -intense on T2 FLAIR 
scans. White matter lesions will be identified as periventricular and subcortical regions appearing hyper -
intense on T2 FLAIR. Lesion diameters/volumes will be  calculated using an in -house AFNI and FreeSurfer 
combination pipeline and the Lesion Segmentation Tool for SPM,89 with manual edits as necessary. All 
volumes will be normalized as a percentage of the total brain parenchyma volume. Parameters: T1: 362 
s, TR/TE=2530/3.32 ms, flip angle=7o, 1 mm3 isotropic resolution, matrix= 256X256; T2: 283 s, TR/TE= 
3200/284 ms, 1 mm3 isotropic resolution, matrix=256X256; T2 FLAIR: 422 s, TR/TE=6000/388 ms, flip 
angle=120o, thickness=1.0 mm, 0.49x0.49 mm in -plane resolutio n, matrix=512X512.  
 
Visit 3 -6—Effects of tDCS on dual task performance: These visits will be separated by one week. Each 
participant will complete each of their assessments at approximately the same time of day. On each 
visit, participants will randomly re ceive one of four different 20 -minute tDCS interventions. They will 
complete a dual task paradigm before tDCS and immediately after tDCS.  
 
tDCS : Each participant will be exposed to a single session of convention al tDCS, optimized tDCS, and two 
shams, delivered using the Startim -8™ device and software (Neuroelectrics Corp, Cambridge MA). This 
system enables custom amounts of current to be delivered via convention al 25 cm2 sponges or through 
an array of up to eight Pi™ (3 cm2) gel Ag /AgCl electrodes placed on the scalp according to the 10 -20 
EEG convention. This system also enables blinding of study personnel and participants to the type of 
stimulation being administered. Staff and participants will complete a blinding questionnaire a fter each 
session. Participants will complete a short side effects questionnaire at the beginning and end of every 
session,90 on which they will be asked to state whether they received tDCS or sham intervention on that 
visit, and their confidence in this b elief.  
 
Conventional tDCS : The anode will be placed over F3 and the cathode over the contralateral supraorbital 
margin (Figure 5). At the beginning of stimulation, the current will be increased manually from 0.1 mA, 
in 0.1 mA increments over 60 seconds, up  to a maximum of 1.8 mA. Participants will be instructed to 
notify study personnel if and when they feel any uncomfortable sensation. The ramp -up will be stopped 
at this point and for the remainder of the session tDCS will be delivered at an intensity of 0 .1 mA below 
the highest level reached. At the end of each session, current will be automatically ramped down to 0.0 
mA over a 60 second period. The same ramp -up/ramp -down procedures will be used across the other 
active conditions.  
 
Conventional  sham : A conventional  sham will be used to maximize blinding of conventional  sponge -
based stimulation. The same sponge placement, ramp -up procedure, and session duration described 
above will be used; however, current will be automatically ramped down 60 seconds after ramp -up.91 
 
Optimized  tDCS : This intervention will utilize eight gel electrodes with placement and current 
parameters  optimized  to the cohort , with the goal of generating an average nE over the dlPFC of the 
same size as the one delivered by a conventional  montage using sponges in an average subject at 1.5 mA 
of current (we will use prior data from older adults to define this average target).. The direct current 
delivered by any one electrode will however never exceed 2.0 mA; the total amount of current fro m all 
electrodes will not exceed 4 mA. Each 20 - minute session will begin and end with a 60 -second ramp 
up/down of current amplitude to maximize comfort.  
 
Optimized  sham : An active sham will be used in which very low -level currents (0.5 mA max) are 
16 
 transfe rred between the same electrodes used in the active condition throughout the entire 20 -minute 
session. This intervention will be optimized to deliver currents designed to not significantly influence 
their cortical tissue, but still mimic the cutaneous sens ations induced by tDCS. We have shown that this 
active sham effectively blinds participants and operators to stimulation condition and does not affect 
functional outcomes.66 
 
Pre/post tDCS assessments:  Participants will complete a dual task paradigm before, immediately after, 
and one hour after tDCS administration. Procedures will follow published recommendations 6,92,93 that 
produce excellent test -retest reliability.94-99 We have used this paradigm wit hin our research and 
laboratory for over ten years. Participants will complete two, 60 -second trials in each of six conditions:  
 Condition 1: Single task: seated cognitive task (see below for description).  
 Condition 2: Single task: standing.  
 Condition 3: Single task: walking.  
 Condition 4: Dual task: standing with cognitive task.  
 Condition 5: Dual task: walking with cognitive task.  
 Condition 6: Single task: fast walking  
 
Standing trials will be completed on a force plate (Kistler, Inc) to record postural sw ay (i.e., center of 
pressure) fluctuations. Participants will stand barefoot with arms at side and feet shoulder width apart. 
The feet will be traced on the first trial and this tracing will be used to ensure consistent placement 
throughout the study. Part icipants will focus on an “X” marked on a wall and will be reminded to avoid 
extraneous movements. Walking trials will be completed around a 25m indoor track. Prior to testing, 
participants will be outfitted with wireless biosensors, each containing a tria xial accelerometer, 
goniometer and magnetometer, on the sternum, low back, wrists and ankles to record gait kinematics 
(Mobility Lab™, APDM Inc). Participants will walk at their preferred, comfortable pace prior to each 
walking trial. For the fast walking trials, participants will walk as fast as they can walk safely. The 
cognitive task will be verbalized serial subtractions of 3’s from a random three -digit number between 
200 and 999 (e.g., 500, 497, 494, etc.). Participant responses during each trial will be recorded. We have 
chosen this task because: 1) it activates a distributed cortical network including the left dlPFC,100 2) is 
the most widely used dual task paradigm 6,101 and induces meaningful dual task costs to postural sway 
when standing and gait ki nematics when walking in older adults,1,55,102,103 3) has been used by our team 
and will thus enable comparison of current results to those from past studies, and 4) is reliable and 
minimally influenced by learning after familiarization.99 No instructions will be given regarding task 
prioritization. This approach has been chosen to most closely mimic real -life situations.6,93,101 Trial order 
will be randomized for each assessment and at least 1min of rest will be provided in between trials.  
 
Participant Pri vacy  
The following are the planned procedures for effectively protecting against and minimizing loss of 
participant privacy:  
1. Phone screenings will be conducted in a private office space.  
2. Study visits will be conducted in private rooms located within labor atory.  
3. Each participant will be given a unique study identification number and data will not include any 
of the participant's PHI. 4. All participant -identifying information will be stored and managed on 
a secured database server. The information will be p assword protected.  
4. Participant confidentiality will be maintained in accordance with HIPAA regulations.  
5. Only the PI and study personnel approved by the IRB and authorized to view PHI will have access 
to the information.  
17 
 6. PHI will not be used during discussi on, presentation or publication of any research data.  
7. Files containing PHI data collected for recruitment and screening purposes will be kept in locked, 
secured filing cabinets accessible only to designated study personnel (research assistants and 
investig ators).

Uses of Device  
18 
 Starstim  
The Principal Investigator (Dr. Brad Manor) has utilized each of the proposed devices extensively in 
numerous research studies.  
 
StarStim  is a transcranial  current  stimulation  device.  The device  is powered  by a 9 volt battery. 
Transcranial Current stimulation (tCS) is a neurophysiological technique capable of modulating the 
excitability of  the neuronal tissue of the central and peripheral nervous  system through the 
application, for a finite time length, of an electrical field. This electric field is generated by the 
application of weak electrical currents through the scalp and into the brain. It has been 
demonstrated that the technique is safe and  potentially beneficial if used within the known 
bounds of current intensity, density and duration.  
tDCS has been widely used during the last decade demonstrating non -significant risk to 
participants (Brunoni, Fregni, & Pagano, 2011). In a comprehensive review of studies 
published from 1998 to 2008 that was authored by an international panel of experts, it 
was concluded that "extensive animal and human evidence and theoretical knowledge 
indicate that the currently used tDCS protocols are safe" (Nitsche et  al., 2008). Side effects 
associated with tDCS according to the most recent data available (Brunoni, Fregni, & 
Pagano, 2011; Nitsche et al., 2008; Antal et al, 2007; Moliadze, Antal, & Paulus, 2010; 
Brignani, Ruzzoli, Mauri, & Miniussi, 2013)  are: 
1. Sensatio ns reported by subjects under the electrodes: (These sensations can sometimes  
continue  throughout  and for a brief  period  following  completion  of the tDCS  but usually resolve 
shortly after the initiation of  tDCS)  
 Mild tingling  (20-70%)  
 Light itching  (30-40%)  
 Slight burning (10 -22%)  
 Discomfort or mild pain  (10-18%)  
2. Other  effects  that can occur  both  during  and after  tDCS  include:  
 Mild fatigue  (15%)  
 Skin redness (20%)  
 Headache (10 -15%)  
 Difficulties in concentration (11%)  
3. Additionally  the following  rare side effects  have  been  described:  
 Nausea  (<1%)  
 Nervousness (<1%)  
4. Although  it has never  been  reported  in tDCS,  seizures  are a theoretical  risk. Individuals with a 
history of seizures and/or a diagnosis of epilepsy will therefore be excluded from this  study

The device will be used to record EEG and apply transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to 
the participant's scalp via gel electrodes. The device will be ope rated by study personnel who 
have obtained certification for administration of tDCS.  
 
The device  will be stored  in a locked  cabinet  within  the Clinical  Research  Laboratory  at the Hebrew 
Rehabilitation Center. Dr. Brad Manor will monitor device usage by stu dy personnel.  
 
Mobility lab  
The Mobility Lab system allows the user to wirelessly record human movement from multiple 
synchronized monitors. There are no adverse effects associated with this passive recording system.  
 
The device is secured to the participant's wrists, ankles, sternum and waist with elastic 
straps. The device records multiple characteristics of movement during trials of standing 
and walking. The device will be used to collect movement data during multipl e trials of 
standing and walking (approximately 60 minutes in total) on 4 separate study visits. The 
device is connected to a computer software program. This program configures  the device 
and completes a performance assessment at the beginning of each tria l of data collection.  
 
Uses of Non -Ionizing Agents  
MRI 
MRI consisting of structural and functional scans. A structural MRI scan provides anatomical 
information of the brain, while the functional MRI provides information about the activity of the 
brain. The se types of scans are a part of routine MRI procedures.  
 
Baseline structural MRIs will  enable current flow  modeling, as well as detection of silent 
infarcts  and white matter hyper  intensities  (WMHs), and the BOLD fMRI will enable  
characterizing the brain functional  network at resting  state. T1, T2, and T2 -weighted fluid -
attenuated inversion recovery (T2 FLAIR)scans will be completed on a  3T GE system  with a 
quadrature head coil at  the Beth Israel  Deaconess Medical Center, located  near the Clinical 
20 
 Research  Lab. Two T1 datasets  will be acquired: one with fat -suppression  to optimize brain 
and CSF  segmentation and  another one without it to  optimize skull and skin segmentation. 
Field -of-view  will encompass all the head  with coverage up to C1/2 vertebrae. Silent  brain 
infarcts will be  identified as focal lesions appearing  hyper -intense on T2 and hypo -intense  on 
T2 FLAIR scans. White matter  lesions will be identified as periventricular  and subcortical 
regions appearing  hyper -intense on T2 FLAIR.  Lesion diameters a nd volumes will be 
automatically calculated  using an in -house AFNI and Free Surfer  combination  pipeline and the 
Lesion  Segmentation Tool for SPM  with manual edits as necessary.  All volumes will be  
normalized as a percentage of the total brain parenchyma vo lume.   
 
Parameters : T1: 362 s,TR/TE=2530/3.32 ms, flip angle=7°,1 mm3  isotropic resolution,matrix= 
256X256; T2: 283 s,TR/TE= 3200/284 ms, 1mm^2isotropic resolution,matrix=256X256; T2 
FLAIR:422 s, TR/TE=6000/388 ms, flip angle=120°, thickness=1.0  mm, 0.49x0.49 mmin -plane 
resolution, matrix=512X512. BOLD MRI will  utilize a standard echo -planar imaging sequence 
with the following parameters:repetitiontime/echo time (TR/TE)= 1050/34.8ms; 65° flip 
angle;230×230mm field of view (FOV) with a104×104 acquisiti on matrix;thickness/gap 
(THK)=4mm/1mm with 2x2mm^2 in -plane resolution. Anatomical  MRI will be acquiredafter 
the BOLD sequences with the T2 -weighted  FLAIR sequence(TR/TE/TI =  6000/279/2100ms, 
1.0mm isotropicres, 256x256mm, 160 slices/slab)  and a 3D magneti zation preparedrapid 
gradient echo (MP -RAGE) sequence (TR/TE/TI  = 7.8/3.1/600ms; 1.0mm slicethickness, 52 
slices; bandwidth = 122Hzper pixel; 10° flip angle; 240x240mm FOV  with 256x192acquisition 
matrix).  
 
There will be one  optional MRI  visit, approximately 50 minutes in duration.  
 
Data Management  
All data collected for analysis will be de -identified and assigned a unique study number. Data 
collection forms will be kept in a locked file cabinet in the office of the PI at Hebrew SeniorLife. 
Data will be entered and stored on a password -protected secure server at Hebrew SeniorLife.  
 
The Institute for Aging Research primarily employs the REDCap system to facilitate data 
management operations. REDCap is a full -featured clinical trial s data management system (DMS) 
accessible to data entry and data analysis workstations using secure Web technologies. The 
REDCap product is developed and maintained by Vanderbilt University in cooperation with REDCap 
Consortium members, including Hebrew Se niorLife. HSL hosts and maintains a dedicated instance 
of REDCap for use across our research enterprise. Each research study is provided separate project 
workspace in which all of the study data are stored in a MySQL relational database on the private 
corp orate network behind several firewalls and located physically within the HSL data center.  
 
Data collected will be stripped of identifiers. Data will be assigned a code number and no personal 
identifying information will be associated with study data in any  format, including electronically. 
Only the investigators will know information about a particular subject. Identifying information 
about a subject will be stored in locked computer files and cabinets and will not be used during the 
discussion, presentatio n, or publication of any research data.  
 
Data will be kept on a secure, password protected Hebrew SeniorLife server in a REDCap Database. 
Only study members at the Hebrew SeniorLife site will have access to the REDCap database. All 
21 
 hard copy forms will be kept in a locked filing cabinet that only study members will be able to 
access.  
 
We will follow the current Hebrew SeniorLife Record Management, Retention, Disposition and 
Destruction Guidelines for this study. Identifiers will be kept for 7 years followin g the completion 
of the study. At this time destruction of materials containing identifiers and keys will be 
completed.  
 
We will receive the coded participant data from MRI scan at BIDMC. The MRI data will allow for 
participant  MRI to  be import ed into the Stimweaver software.  
 
Foreseeable Risks, Potential Benefits, Compensation, and Cost to Participants  
Potential me dical risks of study procedures:  
TESTS OF WALKING AND PHYSICAL FUNCTION: The proposed walking tests have been adapted from the 
large -scale, population -based MOBILIZE Boston study (PI: L. Lipsitz) and multiple completed and ongoing 
clinical studies within the Clinical Research Laboratory at IFAR. They have been designed to be safe for 
individuals of varying risk and conditioning levels includin g older adult fallers. The physical activity 
associated with these tests is of low to moderate intensity. Potential risks include strains, sprains, 
muscle soreness, and light -headedness. In rare instances, more serious side effects such as an injurious 
fall may occur. For all functional tests, a trained "spotter" will stand behind or close to the subject to 
provide stabilizing assistance if necessary. Subjects will be instructed to stop performing or skip any test 
that makes them feel uncomfortable. Adequat e rest will be given in between each test, and any 
reusable equipment will be cleaned with disinfectant after each use.  
 
MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (MRI): Participants will have the option to  participate in one brain 
MRI. They will rest in a horizontal pos ition on the imaging table that slides into a magnetic field. All 
studies performed under this protocol will not exceed the FDA guidelines for magnetic resonance in any 
way. Therefore, the risks assumed by the participant are the same as in any noninvasive  protocol 
involving whole body MRI. The presence of metal objects could cause a burn injury, but by following 
strict MRI exclusion guidelines, this risk will be minimized. Participants may feel claustrophobic or 
anxious during the procedure and they may ex perience musculoskeletal or back discomfort lying on the 
scanner table. The MRI makes loud banging noises as it takes images. Under some circumstances nerve 
stimulation may occur, which may be experienced as a mild twitching reaction in limbs and/or lower 
back muscles. Such effects are rare and scan settings are kept well below the levels where such effects 
are known to occur. MR imaging also requires the use of radio waves that can cause a mild warming 
similar to exposure to hot weather. Body temperature m ay increase but by less than two degrees 
Fahrenheit. Participants will be instructed to inform MRI personnel should they experience discomfort 
due to warming and the procedure will be stopped.  
 
We may need to contact a participant’s health care provider to  ask him/her for documentation 
related to whether it is safe for the participant to have an MRI of their brain. For example, if they 
have had cataract surgery, we would need to verify the name, make, and model of the lens that 
was implanted. This is for sa fety purpo ses. If we need to contact a participant’s  health care 
provider,  we will ask the participant for their  written permission to do so.  
 
TRANSCRANIAL DIRECT CURRENT STIMULATION (tDCS): tDCS has been widely used during the last 
decade demonstrating no n-significant risk to participants. Expected side effects include:  
22 
  
1) Sensations reported by subjects under the electrodes: (These sensations can sometimes continue 
throughout and for a brief period following completion of the tDCS but usually resolve sho rtly after the 
initiation of tDCS)  
 Mild tingling (20 -70%)  
 Light itching (30 -40%)  
 Slight burning (10 -22%)  
 Discomfort or mild pain (10 -18%)  
2) Other effects that can occur both during and after tDCS include:  
 Mild fatigue (15%)  
 Skin redness (20%)  
 Headache (10-15%)  
 Difficulties in concentration (11%)  
3) Additionally the following rare side effects have been described:  
 Nausea (<1%)  
 Nervousness (<1%)  
 Although it has never been reported in tDCS, seizures are a theoretical risk. Individuals with a 
history of sei zures and/or a diagnosis of epilepsy will therefore be excluded from this study.  
  
Potential psychosocial (non -medical) risks of study procedures:  
TESTS OF MENTAL FUNCTION: Risks associated with answering these cognitive test questions are 
minimal, but participants may experience mental fatigue and/or anxiety during this form of testing.  
 
INCONVENIENCES: We will minimize the risk to subjects in this study by excluding those with conditions 
listed in the exclusion criteria. The proposed protocol requires multiple visits and therefore considerable 
participant burden with respect to time and effort. Our study team has a strong track record of 
successful clinical research requiring similar participation, and retention has been high in these 
projects.118,205 The Clinical Research Laboratory at IFAR is located next to a cafeteria and equipped with 
comfortable seating, a TV, movies, books and magazines to keep individuals occupied during resting 
periods. Several additional strategies will be employed to minimize participant burden and maximize 
adherence to the protocol. We will:  
 Develop a personal relationship between participants and members of the staff by matching 
research assistants with individual participants.  
 Schedule appointments at convenient times with f amiliar staff.  
 Explain to participants all aspects of their participation and follow up. We will demonstrate and 
practice study procedures before beginning data collection.  
 Provide reminders of all appointments and follow -up phone calls. Include personal n otes in the 
participant’s data file to remember events in the life of the participant; these can be 
commented on at the next visit (e.g., birthday, birth of a grandchild).  
 Provide snacks during all visits.  
 Provide transportation for all visits, if required  
 Provide valet or dedicated, on -site parking spaces.  
 Compensate participants for visits.  
 
Potential benefits to individual participants as a result of participating in the study:  
23 
 Participants may not receive any significant health benefit from participation, although some may 
benefit from knowledge of their health status, as well as potential therapeutic effects of tDCS.  
Participants will be provided up to a $300  stipend to help c over the costs of their time spent completing 
study procedures.  Specifically, they will receive the following amounts for each visit completed:  
 
Visit 1 A - In-person screening $25  
Visit 1B - Baseline assessment $25  
Visit 2 – Optional MRI visit - $50 
Visits  3- 6: Brain stimulation and Dual tasking assessment visits – one visit per week over 4 weeks; $ 50 
for each visit = total of $ 200 
 
Participants will receive a check in the mail within eight weeks of study participation.  
Potential benefits to study populati on, community or society:  
We believe that the potential benefits of understand and optimizing tDCS as a noninvasive intervention 
to improve dual task standing and walking in older adults outweigh the above -outlined potential risks to 
participants, which ar e expected to be minor, transient and relatively rare.  
Provisions for medical care and available compensation in the event of injury:  
Any subject who suffers an adverse event during the conduct of study protocols at Hebrew SeniorLife 
will be given immediat e medical care at the Hebrew SeniorLife by the medical investigators, and, if the 
event meets the definition of a serious adverse event, the participant will be removed from the study, 
and will be referred to their primary care physician for ongoing care. The treating provider will bill the 
insurance company or other third parties, if appropriate, for the care a participant receives for any 
injury. We will try to have these costs paid for, but the participant may be responsible for some of them. 
For example , they may be responsible for payment of any deductibles and co -payments required by the 
insurer. There are no plans to provide any compensation for an injury beyond what is described above, 
should one occur.  
 
If the event does not meet the criteria of a s erious adverse event, and the participant is willing and able 
to continue, he/she will be able to continue and complete the study.  
Definitions of Adverse Events and Serious Adverse events for the study  
An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in  a participant, whether or not is is causally 
related to the study. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including 
an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom or disease temporally associated with the study. 
Adve rse events will be recorded on the appropriate case report forms and source documents. The 
investigator and/or trained staff member will evaluate all adverse events as to their severity and relation 
to the test article. The severity of adverse events will be graded as follows:  
 Mild: Awareness of a sign or symptom but easily tolerated.  
 Moderate: Discomfort sufficient to cause interference with usual activity or to affect clinical 
status.  
 Severe: Incapacitating with inability to do usual activity or to signif icantly affect clinical status.  
 Life Threatening: The participant was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event as it 
occurred.  
24 
  
The Investigator will also assess the relationship of any adverse event to study, based upon available 
information, using the following guidelines:  
 0 = Unlikely: No temporal association, or the cause of the event has been identified.  
 1 = Possible: Temporal association, but other etiologies are likely to be the cause; however, 
involvement of the study procedures cannot b e excluded.  
 2 = Probable: Temporal association, other etiologies are possible, but not likely.  
A serious adverse event is any experience that results in any of the following outcomes: death, is 
life threatening, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of  hospitalization, a persistent or 
significant disability/incapacity. Important medical events that may not result in death, be life -
threatening, or require hospitalization may be considered a serious adverse event when, based 
upon appropriate medical judgm ent, they may jeopardize the patient or participant and may 
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed in this definition.  
Unanticipated problems and adverse events will be reported according to the Hebrew SeniorLife's 
IRB written guidelines for interventional studies. Serious adverse events will be reported to the 
Hebrew SeniorLife’s IRB within 24hrs by fax or email, with a written report submitted within 5 
business days of learning of the event, and submission of the in cident via the eIRB system within 
one week of learning of the event. This form will record any adverse symptoms and/or study 
protocol deviations.  
 
All adverse events/study incidents will be reported to the HSL IRB, according to policy, within 5 
business da ys of learning of the event, and to submit the incident via the eIRB system within one 
week of learning of the event.  
 
Data Safety Monitoring Board  
Only those listed on the approved IRB protocol will have access to subject data. Subject data will be 
coded  and locked in a file cabinet in a locked office. Identifying information will not be used during 
discussion, presentation or research publication. The criteria for discontinuing a participant's 
participation include the participant's request, as well as a ny unexpected life -threatening or 
potentially disabling event, including syncope, an injurious non -accidental fall, hemodynamic 
collapse, stroke, transient ischemic attack, dysrhythmia, renal insufficiency, angina, myocardial 
infarction, anaphylaxis, acute  hemorrhage, or hospitalization for acute illness. Any adverse events 
that take place during testing will be reported by the PI (Dr. Brad Manor) to Dr. Lewis Lipsitz, 
Director of Institute for Aging Research, Professor of Medicine at HMS and Chief of Geron tology at 
BIDMC and recorded in the database. Drs. Manor and Lipsitz will have primary responsibility for 
monitoring participant safety in the trial. The investigators will be responsible for reviewing each 
adverse event in a timely fashion, and reporting all incidents to the DSMB in accordance with the 
established DSMB charter, and preparing a summary report. Any adverse events will be reported to 
the Hebrew SeniorLife IRB according to written guidelines.  
 
 
Dissemination of Results  
Results will be dissemi nated through publications in peer -reviewed medical journals, presentations at 
national meetings, and announcements on the HSL website and other public media.  
25 
 To comply with the dissemination of NIH -funded clinical trial information, we will register this clinical 
trial at ClinicalTrials.gov. We will ensure that results information is submitted to ClinicalTrials.gov as 
outlined in the policy, and according to the specific timelines stated in the policy. We also will ensure 
that informed consent documents fo r this clinical trial will include a specific statement relating to 
posting of clinical trial information at ClinicalTrials.gov. Hebrew SeniorLife’s Institute for Aging Research 
has an internal policy in place to ensure that clinical trials registration an d results reporting occur in 
compliance with policy requirements.

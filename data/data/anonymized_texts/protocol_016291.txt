Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 Numb er of Subjects to be Enrolled/ Randomized:    
Approximately 80 subjects were planned to be enrolled to reach 66 evaluable AR+ subjects.  
103 subjects were actually enrolled in the study . 
Study Design  Overview:    
This is a multinational, multicenter, open -label, single -arm, 2-stage, Phase 2 study evaluating the 
efficacy, safety, and tolerability of enzalutamide with trastuzumab. A Simon’s 2-stage design is 
implemented to allow for early termination if < 3 of 21 evaluable AR+ subjects show clinical 
benefit [confirmed complete r esponse (CR), partial response (PR) according to Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria or prolonged stable disease (SD) 
≥ 24weeks] at the analysis of the first stage. If ≥ 3 of 21 evaluable AR+ subjects show clinical 
benefit, t hen a second stage will continue to enroll a total of 66 evaluable AR+ subjects.  
Subjects will enter the screening period up to 28 days prior to treatment start. Subjects will be 
allowed to prescreen under a separate consent form to enable testing of arch ival tissue for AR 
expression before initiation of other screening activities. After completion of screening 
assessments, eligible subjects will enter into the treatment phase to receive enzalutamide with 
trastuzumab. Study visits will take place every 3 w eeks until week 16, then at weeks, 25, 34, 40, 
and 49, and then every 12 weeks thereafter until the subject meets discontinuation criteria or the 
study ends. Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks up to week 49, and then every 
12 weeks thereafte r. Subjects will continue on treatment until disease progression, unacceptable 
toxicity, or any other discontinuation criteria are met.  
Upon discontinuation of study drug, subjects will enter the follow -up period. An end of treatment 
visit will be perform ed within 7 days of the last dose of enzalutamide. The Follow -up Visit will be 
performed approximately 30 days after the last dose of enzalutamide or before initiation of 
subsequent treatment (whichever is first); this visit may be conducted by phone call if the subject is 
unable to return to the clinic. The treatment emergent period will be defined as the period of time 
from the first dose date of study drug to 30 days after the last dose date of study drug or the start of 
subsequent treatment (whichever o ccurs first). All adverse events (AEs) that occur during the 
collection period are to be followed until resolved or judged to be no longer clinically significant, 
or until they become chronic to the extent that they can be fully characterized.  
If the study  is terminated early for reasons other than safety, and the subject is receiving clinical 
benefit per Investigator ’s judgment, the subject may continue on study medication until they have 
disease progression as defined per RECIST.  
Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:    
Inclusion:  
1. The subject has consented and signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent Ethics 
Committee (IEC) approved written Informed Consent and privacy language as per national

prior to any study -related procedures (including withdrawal of prohibited medication, if 
applicable).  
2. The subject is a female ≥ 18 years of age . 
3. The subject has histologically or cytologically proven adenocarcinoma of the breast that is 
HER2+ defined as a score of 3+ for staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC), or IHC 2+ with

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 Inclusion continued  
4. The subject has AR+ breast cancer, which is defined as any tumor cells with nuclear AR 
staining by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Enrollment may be based on the local pathologist’s 
findings; however, tissue will be sent to a central pathology laboratory for assessment. NOTE: 
If a subject is enrolled in the study based on local pathologist results, but subsequent central 
assessment cannot confirm AR+ disease, the subject may remain in the study.    
5. The subject has metastatic di sease or has locally advanced disease that is not amendable to 
curative treatment.  
6. The subject has measurable disease or nonmeasurable, evaluable disease per RECIST 1.1 
(NOTE:  pleural effusions, ascites or other third fluid space are not evaluable disease s per 
RECIST 1.1).  
7. The subject has received at least 1 line of therapy in the metastatic or locally advanced disease 
setting:    
● A line of therapy is defined as a course of treatment at the end of which there was 
disease progression, toxicity, or in the Investigator’s opinion, maximum benefit has 
been achieved. If the subject discontinued therapy due to any other reason but 
progress ed without receiving other treatment, this would be considered a line of 
therapy.  
● The subject has been documented to have progressed by determination of the 
Investigator on a regimen containing an anti -HER2 agent (includes trastuzumab 
emtansine in countri es where it is not approved) as t he most recent regimen or the most 
recent anti -HER2 regimen was discontinued for any toxicity, with the exception of a 
cardiotoxicity.  
● Subjects who received < 28 days of therapy in the most recent regimen may be eligible 
upon approval from the medical monitor.     
● The subject progressed on a trastuzumab containing regimen. If progression occurred 
within 12 months after completing trastuzumab -containing adjuvant treatment, this 
counts as having received trastuzumab but not a s a line of therapy.  
8. The subject has adequately recovered from toxicities due to  prior therapy.  
9. The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1 at 
Screening and Day 1.  
10. The subject has available at the site a representative, formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded, 
tumor specimen that enabled the definitive diagnosis of breast cancer with adequate viable 
tumor cells in a tissue block (preferred) or ≥ 10 (20 preferred) freshly cut, unstained, serial 
slides and the ass ociated pathology report:  
● Archival tissue from the most recent biopsy available is preferred.  
● For subjects who are known AR+ per local pathology report, a fresh biopsy can be 
done per Investigator’s discretion, to obtain tissue for central AR confirmation if the 
archival specimen is insufficient or unavailable .  
● Cytological or fine -needle aspiration samples are not acceptable.  
11. The subject has an estimated life expectancy of at least 6  months at Day 1, in the opinion of 
the Investigator.

Endpoints for Evaluation:   
Primary  
CBR defined as the proportion of evaluable subjects with best objective response of confirmed CR 
or PR per RECIST 1.1 criteria, or prolonged SD ( ≥ 24 weeks).  
Secondary  
Efficacy Endpoints:  
● ORR (CR+PR) at 24 weeks according to RECIST 1.1 criteria.  
● BORR according to RECIST 1.1.  
● PFS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of enzalutamide (Study Day 1) until the 
date of disease progression per RECIST 1.1or death from any cause on study, whichever 
occurs first.  
● TTP is defined as the time fr om the first date of enzalutamide treatment until the date of 
disease progression per RECIST 1.1.  
● DOR is defined as the time from the date first documentation of response (CR or PR) until the 
date of disease progression per RECIST 1.1.  
● TTR is defined as t he time from the first date of enzalutamide treatment to initial CR or PR.  
Safety Endpoints:  
Safety will be assessed on an ongoing basis by physical examination, measurement of vital signs,

Statistical Methods:  
Sample Size Justification:  
The sample size is sufficient to determine the absence or presence of an efficacy signal. The sample 
sizes for the first and second stage were determined using Simon’s 2-stage design. The null 
hypothesis that the true CBR is 10% will be tested against a 1-sided alternative at a 5% significance 
level. In the first stage, 21 evaluable AR+ subjects will be evaluated; the study will stop if < 3 
evaluable subjects show confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1, or prolonged SD (≥  24 weeks). 
Otherwise, the study will con tinue to enroll up to 66 evaluable AR+ subjects. This design has a 
statistical power of 90% when the true CBR is 25%. To illustrate the precision with a total of 66 
subjects: if the observed CBR is 40%, then the 90% confidence interval will be within the 3 0% to 
50% range.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 Taking into account an anticipated number of nonevaluable subjects, approximately 80 subjects 
were planned to be enrolled to achieve a data set with at least 66 evaluable AR+ subjects.   
 
Efficacy:   
The Efficacy Evaluable Set (EES) is a s ubset of the FAS defined as all enrolled subjects who have 
centrally assessed AR+ (defined as >  10% of tumor cells with nuclear expression), received at least 
1 dose of study drug, and have at least 1 available post baseline tumor assessment.  
The primary analyses will be done in the EES, while all efficacy analyses will be done in both the 
EES and Full Analysis Set (FAS). If more than 5 subjects are enrolled into the study but had less 
than 10% of tumor cells with nuclear expression, and received at least 1 dose of study drug, the 
efficacy analyses will also be conducted in this subset of FAS.  Further details will be presented in 
the statistical analysis plan. Subjects whose disease is not confirmed to be AR+ upon central 
review may stay on study; however, they will not contribute to the primary and secondary efficacy 
analyses.  
All variables will be presented as descriptive statistics. CBR, ORR, and BORR will be summarized 
including 95% 2-sided confidence intervals.  
Kaplan -Meier methods will be used to estim ate PFS, TTP, TTR, and DOR.  
Pharmacokinetics:   
PK analyses will be conducted using the pharmacokinetic analysis set (PKAS). The PKAS is 
defined as the subset of the safety analysis set (SAF) population for which at least 1 quantifiable 
enzalutamide N -desmethyl enzalutamide, or trastuzumab concentration value after Week 4 is 
available.  
The enzalutamide, N -desmethyl enzalutamide, and trastuzumab concentration -time data will be 
summarized by descriptive statistics at each vis it. Additional model -based analyses may be 
performed but will be reported separately.  
Pharmacodynamics:  
Pharmacodynamic:  
Circulating hormones and protein markers will be expressed as the change in absolute value and 
percent change from baseline at each visit and presented using descriptive statistics.  
Additional model -based analyses to explore PK -PD relationships may be performed.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Safety:  
Safety analyses will be conducted using the Safety Analysis Set (S AF). The SAF is defined as all 
subjects who have received at least partial or full dose of study drug. The treatment emergent 
period will be defined as the period of time from the first dose date of study drug to 30 days after 
the last dose date of study d rug or the start of subsequent treatment (whichever is first). Safety will 
be assessed through descriptive statistics for the frequency of AEs by system organ class (SOC), 
preferred term (PT), and National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for A dverse

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2  
The severity of all AEs is to be evaluated by the Investigator based on the NCI CTCAE, version 
4.03. All AEs will be coded to preferred term and system organ class using Medical Dictionary for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The number and percentage of subjects with treatment emergent 
adverse events will be presented by MedDRA system organ class and preferred t erm, relationship 
to study treatment, and NCI CTCAE grade. A subject reporting the same AE more than once is 
counted once and at the maximum severity or strongest relationship to study drug treatment, when 
calculating incidence.   
Laboratory data consist of  hematology, chemistry, coagulation, and urine dipstick laboratory test 
results. Where applicable, NCI CTCAE version 4.03 will be used to categorize toxicity grades for 
the laboratory parameters. Laboratory shift tables compared to baseline results for eac h subsequent 
visit will be produced. For each laboratory parameter, the baseline laboratory value is defined as 
the last laboratory value collected on or prior to the first dose date of enzalutamide.  
Interim Analyses:  
Recruitment will continue if there are 3 or more subjects with clinical benefit in the first 21 
evaluable AR+ subjects from the evaluable set.  If there are less than 3 subjects who demonstrate 
confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1, or prolonged SD ≥ 24 weeks (using all available data), 
recruitm ent will be stopped.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 1 INTRODUCTION  
1.1 Background  
Breast cancer is one of the most frequently diagnosed malignancies and the second most 
common cause of cancer deaths in  women, despite improvements in screening and treatment 
regimens. According to the American Cancer Society, about 1.4 million women are 
diagnosed with breast cancer annually worldwide and about 458,400 will die from the 
disease [American Cancer Society, 20 11]. In the United States, approximately 1 in 8 women 
(12%) will develop invasive breast cancer over their lifetimes, and about 39,510 women 
annually wi ll die from the disease [Siegel et al,  2011].   
Breast cancer is genetically heterogeneous and biological ly diverse and it is no longer 
considered a single disease. The long recognized clinical and phenotypic differences have 
been shown to correlate with differences at the gene expression level [S ørlie et al, 2004; 
Perou  et al, 2000]. Five distinct breast can cer molecular subtypes are defined by hierarchical 
cluster analyses of array gene expression data; they include luminal A, luminal B, human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) amplified, basal -like and normal -like [ Goldhirsch 
et al,  2011].  
Approximat ely 20% of all breast cancers have gene amplification or overexpression (or both) 
of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), a tyrosine kinase transmembrane 
receptor, resulting in a more aggressive phenotype and a poor prognosis. Treatment with th e 
anti-HER2 humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab in addition to chemotherapy, as 
compared with chemotherapy alone, significantly improves progression -free and overall 
survival among patients with HER2 -positive metastatic breast cancer.  Trastuzumab bin ds to 
subdomain intravenous ( IV) infusion  of the HER2 extracellular domain and exerts its 
antitumor effects by blocking HER2 cleavage, stimulating antibody -dependent, cell -mediated 
cytotoxicity and inhibiting ligand -independent, HER2 -mediated mitogenic signaling. 
However, in most patients with HE R2-positive metastatic breast cancer, the disease 
progresses, highlighting the need for new targeted therapie s for advanced disease [Baselga et 
al, 2012]  
Expression of the androgen receptor (AR) has been observed in the majority of breast cancer 
specimens.  In studies evaluating over 3,000 breast tumor specimens, AR expression was 
observed in 77% of invasive breast tumors and its expression was observed across al l 
molecular phenotypes [Collins et al,  2011; Goldhirsch et al, 2011; Niemeier et al,  2010]. In 
invasive carcinomas, AR expression was identified in 89% of luminal A, 66% of luminal B, 
54% of HER2 amplified, 31% of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and 35% of 
unclassified breast cancers [Coll ins et al, 2011; Niemeier et al,  2010]. The role of AR 
signaling in patients with AR -positive (AR+) breast cancer remains to be elucidated through 
well conducted studies using selective and potent AR signaling inhibitors.  
AR expression has been identified in over 50% of patients with HER2 positive/hormon e 
recepto r negative disease [Hu et al, 2011; Park et al,  2010]. An evaluation of published 
microarray data from 3 patient sets demonstrated that AR gene expression levels correlated

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 with HER2 amplificati on/ overexpression [Ni et al,  2011]. This is consistent with 
immunohistochemistry (IHC) observations of AR expression correlating wit h HER2 
overexpression [Niemeier et al, 2010; Park et al, 2010; Agoff et al,  2003]. Prolonged AR 
stimulation in an AR+ cell line where ER is absent and HER2 is expressed but not amplifie d 
(MDA -MB-453) resulted in activation of HER2/HER3 signaling. Bicalutamide reversed this 
activation via reduction of total and phosphorylated HER3 protein and inhibited growth.  The 
combination of lapatinib (a tyrosine kinase inhibitor with activity agains t HER1 and HER2) 
and bicalutamide was more active than either agent alone [Brown, 2011]. In vivo, 
dihydro -testosterone (DHT) enhanced tumor growth while bicalutamide caused tumor 
regression [Ni et al,  2011].  A similar mechanism of action may be occurring in AR+/ER - 
cell lines where HER2 is amplified.  In BT474 cells (AR+/ER -/HER2+amplified), DHT 
treatment increases both total and phospho -HER3 protein [Richer AACR Advances in Breast 
Cancer meeting, 03 Oct, 2013].  In addition, the combination of enzalutamid e and 
trastuzumab can reverse HER3 activation better than either agent alone and reduce cell 
growth [Richer AACR Advances in Breast Cancer meeting, 03 Oct, 2013]  
Clinical evaluation s of agents that interfere with HER2/HER3 crosstalk in patients with 
HER2 a mplified breast cancer have yie lded promising results [Baselga et al,  2012]. The 
combination of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel, as compared with placebo plus 
trastuzumab plus docetaxel, when used as first -line treatment for HER2 -positive metast atic 
breast cancer, significantly prolonged progression -free survival, with no increase in cardiac 
toxic effects. The median progression -free survival was 12.4 months in the control group, as 
compared with 18.5  months in the pertuzumab group. The interim a nalysis of overall survival 
showed a strong trend in favor of pertuzumab plus trastuzumab plus docetaxel.  Median 
overall survival was 37.6 months in the placebo group but had not been reached  in the 
pertuzumab group [Swain et al,  2013]. Taken together, th ese data warrant further clinical 
investigation of a possible link between AR and growth factor pathways in AR+/HER2+ 
breast cancer. The primary pharmacodynamic (PD) effect of enzalutamide is inhibition of the 
AR signaling pathway. Medivation and APGD are in a partnership to co -develop 
enzalutamide for the treatment of breast cancer.  
1.2 Nonclinical and Clinical Data  
1.2.1 Nonclinical Studies  
1.2.1.1  Pharmacology  
The primary PD effect of enzalutamide is inhibition of the AR signaling pathway. Primary 
PD has been defined in experiments that demonstrated inhibition of AR binding, inhibition of 
AR nuclear translocation, inhibition of AR chromatin association, inhibition of AR -
dependent transcription and cancer cell proliferation, induction of cell death and tumor 
regression, an d lack of agonist activity. On the whole, nonclinical data on the primary PD of 
enzalutamide show s that it is a potent AR inhibitor, and further that it is distinct from other 
anti-androgens in affecting multiple points in the AR signaling pathway.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 A major human metabolite of enzalutamide, N -desmethyl enzalutamide, demonstrated key 
primary PD of similar potency to the parent molecule.  
Two luminal AR+ and ER+ breast cancer cell lines, MCF7 and BCK4, were shown to 
proliferate in response to AR stimula tion with DHT. Enzalutamide inhibited DHT -mediated 
cell growth in both cell lines. Enzalutamide also inhibited estradiol -mediated cell growth of 
MCF7 and BCK4 cells. In contrast, bicalutamide did not inhibit estradiol -mediated cell 
growth of MCF7 cells. Co nsistent with the inhibitory effect on estradiol -induced cell growth, 
enzalutamide also blocked estradiol -stimulated expression of 3 genes: Stromal Cell -Derived 
Factor -1 (SDF -1), the progesterone receptor (PgR), and the AR. As enzalutamide does not 
block b inding of estradiol to the ER, these data suggest that AR and ER crosstalk, and AR 
signaling inhibition with enzalutamide has a dominant negative role on ER signaling. In 
AR+, ER -negative (ER -) breast cancer cells (MDA -kb2), enzalutamide inhibits DHT -induc ed 
viability at 10 μM.  
The effect of enzalutamide on several Her2 -amplified cell lines was evaluated in vitro. In 
some cases, DHT could enhance the growth of these cell lines. In the cell lines tested, either 
enzalutamide or trastuzumab inhibited cell gro wth in t he presence or absence of DHT. In the 
cases where DHT was present, enzalutamide reduced cell number below nonDHT -treated 
levels. A similar observation was made with trastuzumab.  When cells were treated with both 
agents, a further reduction in cell  number was observed. The results are summarized in the 
table below.

Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for more information.  
1.2.1.2  Pharmacokinetics  
Following oral administration in animals, enzalutamide is eliminated slowly from plasma 
with a long t 1/2 across species. In vitro stu dies show that enzalutamide is metabolized by 
human recombinant cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoenzymes CYP2C8 and CYP3A4/5. 
Enzalutamide and/or its major human metabolites caused direct in vitro inhibition of multiple 
CYP enzymes including CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 , CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5; 
however, subsequent clinical data showed that enzalutamide is an inducer of CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 and had no clinically meaningful effect on CYP2C8 (see 
Section  1.2.2.1 ). In vitro, enzalutamide caused time -dependent inhibition of CYP1A2. Based

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 on in vitro data, enzalutamide is a potential inducer of CYP3A4 and is not expected to induce 
CYP1A2 at therapeutically relevant concentrations.  
In vitro data show that enzalutamide and its active metabolite N -desmethyl enzalutamide are 
potential inhibitors, but not substrates, of the efflux transporter P -glycoprotein (P -gp).  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for  more information.  
1.2.1.3  Toxicology  
The species included in the toxicity program were mice, rats, dogs and cynomolgus monkeys.  
Electrocardiogram (ECG) and cardiovascular assessments in a toxicity study in dogs showed 
no treatment related effects. In vivo and i n vitro safety pharmacology studies also 
demonstrated the absence of cardiovascular enzalutamide -related effects.  
Enzalutamide was non mutagenic in bacteria, nonclastogenic in mammalian cells and non 
genotoxic in vivo in mice. The 2 major human metabolites  (N-desmethyl enzalutamide and 
an inactive carboxylic acid derivative) and a minor metabolite (M6) were negative for 
mutagenicity in the bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames).  
Overall, enzalutamide was generally well tolerated in pivotal nonclinical stud ies with rats and 
dogs with the most prominent effects occurring in reproductive and hormone -sensitive 
tissues.  
Please refer to the Investigator’s Brochure for more information.  
1.2.2 Clinical Studies  
1.2.2.1  Pharmacokinetics  
The pharmacokinetics (PK)  of oral enzalutamide is being investigated in a Phase 1 study in 
women with advanced breast cancer (MDV3100 -08, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). Preliminary data 
demonstrate similar PK of enzalutamide and N -desmethyl enzalutamide in women relative to 
men with CRPC.  
The PK and metabolism of enzalutamide have been evaluated in more than 2500 patients 
with prostate cancer and in more than 200 volunteers, including healthy male subjects and  
subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Individual daily doses have ranged fro m 
30 to 600  mg.  
Oral absorption of enzalutamide, whether administered as single or multiple doses, is rapid 
and independent of dose. Peak concentration of enzalutamide is generally achieved 1 to 
2 hours post dose in both patients and healthy subjects. Enz alutamide is well absorbed 
(estimated bioavailability based on mass balance data ≥ 84.2%). The mean t 1/2 is 5.8 days, 
and does not appear to be affected by dose. With daily administration, it takes approximately 
1 month to reach steady state. The accumulat ion ratio is 8.3 -fold. At steady state, 
enzalutamide shows approximately dose proportional PK over the range of 30  to 600 mg/day.  
A mass balance and biotransformation study in healthy male volunteers showed that 
enzalutamide is primarily eliminated by hepa tic metabolism.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 A food -effects study showed that food does not have a clinically relevant effect on AUC of 
enzalutamide or N -desmethyl enzalutamide; therefore, enzalutamide can be taken with or 
without food.  
A hepatic impairment study showed that the comp osite area under the curve (AUC) of 
enzalutamide plus N -desmethyl enzalutamide after single -dose enzalutamide was similar in 
subjects with baseline mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child -Pugh Class A and B, 
respectively) relative to subjects with norma l hepatic function, and no starting dose 
adjustment is needed.  
A clinical drug -drug interaction study showed that enzalutamide can affect exposures to other 
co-medications. At steady state, enzalutamide did not have a clinically significant effect on 
expo sure to pioglitazone (CYP2C8 substrate). Steady -state enzalutamide reduced the AUC of 
midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate), S -warfarin (CYP2C9 substrate) and omeprazole (CYP2C19 
substrate) by 86%, 56% and 70%, respectively. Therefore, enzalutamide is a strong CYP3 A4 
inducer and a moderate CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 inducer. Substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9 
and CYP2C19 with a narrow therapeutic index are to be avoided, as enzalutamide may 
decrease plasma exposure of these drugs.  
Another clinical drug -drug interaction study sho wed that concomitant medications can affect 
exposure to enzalutamide. Coadministration of gemfibrozil (a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor) 
increased the composite AUC of enzalutamide plus N -desmethyl enzalutamide by 2.2 -fold; 
therefore, strong CYP2C8 inhibitors are  to be avoided. If coadministration with a strong 
CYP2C8 inhibitor is necessary, the dose of enzalutamide is to be reduced to 80  mg once 
daily. Coadministration of itraconazole (strong CYP3A4 inhibitor) increased the composite 
AUC of enzalutamide plus N -desmethyl enzalutamide by 1.3 -fold; as this small change is not 
clinically meaningful, no starting dose adjustment is needed when coadministering 
enzalutamide with CYP3A4 inhibitors.  
Strong or moderate inducers of CYP3A4 or CYP2C8 are to be avoided as they can alter the 
plasma exposure to enzalutamide plus N -desmethyl enzalutamide.  
1.3 Summary of Key Safety Information for Study Drugs  
1.3.1 Enzalutamide  
To date, limited safety data are available from the ongoing Phase 1 study of enzalutamide in 
women with breast cance r (MDV3100 -08, [STUDY_ID_REMOVED]). The dose -escalation portion of the 
study evaluated 80 and 160 mg/day, and 160 mg/day was determined to be the recommended 
Phase 2 dose. The dose -expansion portion of this study is evaluating enzalutamide at 
160 mg/day as a sing le agent in women with AR+ breast cancer, and enzalutamide at 
160 mg/day in combination with either anastrozole or exemestane in women with ER+ breast 
cancer. Preliminary data suggest a similar safety profile to that observed in men.  In addition, 
enzaluta mide is being evaluated in a Phase 2, single -arm, open -label study in AR+ TNBC 
patients, MDV3100 -11 ([STUDY_ID_REMOVED]), and in a Phase 2, randomized, double -blind, 
placebo -controlled study in combination with exemestane in ER+/PgR+ HER2 -normal breast 
cancer pat ients, MDV3100 -12.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 As of 28  Feb 2015, over 3000 patients with prostate cancer, over 300 women with breast 
cancer and over 250 subjects with no known cancer, including healthy male subjects and 
subjects with hepatic impairment, have received at least 1 dos e of enzalutamide in completed 
and ongoing clinical studies.  
Enzalutamide 160  mg daily was generally well -tolerated in subjects with CRPC. The adverse 
events ( AEs) occurring in at least 5% of the enzalutamide group and at an incidence at least 
2% greater than in the placebo group included fatigue (37% vs. 30%), arthralgia (21% vs. 
17%), diarrhea (20% vs. 18%), hot flush (20% vs. 10%), peripheral edema (16% vs. 13%), 
musculoskeletal pain (14% vs. 12%), headache (12% v 6%), muscular weakness (9% vs. 
7%), ins omnia (9% vs. 6%), hematuria (7% vs. 5%), hypertension (6% vs. 3%) and 
pollakiuria (5% vs. 3%).  
Other AEs reported less commonly than 5% but that may be associated with enzalutamide 
treatment after careful assessment of the AEs include: falls (4.5% vs. 1.3 %), nonpathologic 
facture (4.0% vs. 0.8%), dry skin (3.6% vs. 1.3%) and pruritus (3.3% vs. 1.3%). A possible 
cognitive effect of enzalutamide was observed with a greater proportion of patients in the 
enzalutamide -treated group (4.5% vs. 1.8%) reporting the  following AE terms: memory 
impairment, cognitive disorder, amnesia, disturbance of attention and dementia. In addition, 
event terms related to hallucination (visual hallucination, tactile hallucination, hallucination) 
were reported more frequently in the enzalutamide -treated group (1.6% vs. 0.3%).  
In clinical studies, seizure was identified as a risk associated with enzalutamide treatment. In 
the controlled clinical study CRPC2, seizures occurred in 0.9% (7/800) of patients receiving 
enzalutamide 160  mg da ily, whereas no seizures occurred in patients treated with placebo. 
Confounding factors may have contributed to the occurrence of seizures in several of these 
cases. Dose appears to be an important predictor of seizure, with a greater risk of seizure at 
daily doses higher than 160  mg. In a dose escalation study involving 140 patients, no patients 
experienced seizures at or below daily doses of 240  mg, whereas 3 seizures were reported, 
1 each at 360, 480 and 600 mg/day. Caution should be used in administerin g enzalutamide to 
patients with a history of seizures or other predisposing factors including, but not limited to, 
underlying brain injury, stroke, primary brain tumors or brain metastases or alcoholism. In 
addition, the risk of seizure may be increased in  patients receiving concomitant medications 
that may lower the seizure threshold. Enzalutamide should be permanently discontinued in 
patients who have a seizure while on treatment.  
Enzalutamide should not be administered to any patient who has shown a hype rsensitivity 
reaction to the active pharmaceutical ingredient or any of the enzalutamide capsule 
components, including Labrasol, butylated hydroxyanisole and butylated hydroxytoluene.  
Concomitant administration of enzalutamide with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors , strong or 
moderate CYP2C8 inducers, strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided. 
Concomitant use of enzalutamide with narrow therapeutic index drugs that are metabolized 
by CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 should be avoided. Subjects should avoid use  of any 
herbal medications or dietary supplements including products containing Hypericum 
perforatum (e.g., St. John’s Wort).

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 Food has no clinically significant effect on the extent of absorption. Enzalutamide may be 
taken with or without food.  
1.3.2 Trastuzumab  
Signs and symptoms of cardiotoxicity and cardiac dysfunction have been observed in patients 
treated with Trastuzumab, especially when used concurrently with anthracyclines.  
Please refer to local prescribing information for key safety information.  
1.4 Risk -Benefit Assessment  
Although new therapies are available for patients with metastatic HER2+ breast cancer, this 
still remains an unmet medical need as patients will eventually pr ogress on their treatments 
[Lin et al,  2004].  
Enzalutamide given at 160 mg/day has  been evaluated and found to be well tolerated in a 
Phase 3 study in men with prostate cancer. It is the dose approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and European Medicinal Agency (EMA) for use in men with 
castration -resistant prostate cancer af ter chemotherapy.  
A Phase 1 dose escalation study in women with Stage IV and locally advanced unresectable 
breast cancer is ongoing. The dose of 160  mg daily has been found tolerable according to the 
protocol dose escalation criteria. To date, enzalutamid e has been generally safe and well 
tolerated in breast cancer subjects.  
This Phase 2 study represents a proof -of-concept study in women with HER2+/AR+ breast 
cancer. The patient population selected for this study is a standard population for the 
assessment  of safety, tolerability, PK and anti -tumor activity in a Phase 2 breast cancer 
setting.  
Restricting the HER2+ population to AR+ patients is to minimize exposure to potential 
toxicities in patients least likely to benefit from enzalutamide. Moreover, this  study will 
enroll subjects who would be receiving a HER2 -targeting agent (e.g., trastuzumab 
monotherapy) as part of their standard of care treatment.  
2 STUDY OBJECTIVE(S), DESIGN, AND ENDPOINT S 
2.1 Study Objectives

2.2 Study Design and Dose Rationale  
2.2.1 Study Design  
This is a multinational, multicenter, open -label, single -arm, 2-stage, Phase  2 study evaluating 
the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of enzalutamide with trastuzumab . The study population 
includes female subjects with HER2+ and AR+ metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer 
who have progressed on at least 1 prior line of anti -HER2 therapy in the metastatic or 
advanced setting. Subjects may be either ER/PgR positive or negative according to the local 
assessment for hormone receptor diagnostics. A line of therapy is defined as a course of 
treatment at the end of which there was d isease progression, toxicity, or in the Investigator’s 
opinion, maximum benefit has been achieved. Approximately 55 centers in North America 
and Europe will conduct the study. Approximately 80 subjects w ere planned to be enrolled to 
reach 66  evaluable AR+ subjects.  103 subjects were actually enrolled in the study.  
A Simon’s 2-stage design is implemented to allow for early termination if < 3 of 21  evaluable 
AR+ subjects show  clinical benefit [confirmed complete response (CR), partial response (PR) 
according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1, criteria or 
prolonged stable disease (SD) ≥ 24 weeks] at the analysis of the first stage. If ≥  3 of 
21 evaluable AR+ subjects show clinical benefit, then a second stage will continue to enroll a  
total of 66 evaluable AR+ subjects.  
Subjects will enter the screening period up to 28 days prior to treatment start. Subjects will be 
allowed to prescreen under a separate consent form to enable testing of archival tissue for AR 
expression before initiati on of other screening activities. After completion of screening 
assessments, eligible subjects will enter into the treatment phase to receive enzalutamide with 
trastuzumab. Study visits will take place every 3 weeks until week 16, then at weeks 25, 34,

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 40, and 49, and then every 12 weeks thereafter until the subject meets discontinuation criteria 
or the study ends.  Tumor assessments will be performed every 8 weeks through week 49, 
and then every 12 weeks thereafter. Subjects will continue on treatment unti l disease 
progression, unacceptable toxicity , or any other discontinuation criteria are met. Upon 
discontinuation of study drug, subjects will enter the follow -up period. An end of treatment 
visit will be performed within 7 days of the last dose of enzalut amide. The Follow -up Visit 
will be performed 30 days after the last dose of enzalutamide or before initiation of 
subsequent treatment (whichever occurs first); this visit may be conducted by phone call if 
the subject is unable to return to the clinic. The treatment emergent period will be defined as 
the period of time from the first dose date of study drug to 30 days after the last dose date of 
study drug or the start of subsequent treatment (whichever occurs first). All AEs that occur 
during the collection  period are to be followed up until resolved or judged to be no longer 
clinically significant, or until they become chronic to the extent that they can be fully 
characterized.  
If the study is terminated early for reasons other than safety, and the subject is receiving 
clinical benefit per Investigator ’s judgment, the subject may continue on study medication 
until they have disease progression as defined per RECIST.  
2.2.2 Dose Rationale  
Enzalutamide given at 160 mg/day has been approved by the FDA and EMA for use in men 
with castration -resistant prostate cancer after docetaxel chemotherapy.  
A Phase 1 dose escalation study in women with breast cancer (MDV3100 -08) has identified 
the 160 mg/day dose as the recommended dose in women.  
Trastuzumab will be given per loca l guidelines. Trastuzumab given as an 8mg/kg loading 
dose followed by 6 mg/kg every 21 days has been evaluated in numerous studies and remains 
standard of care treatment after first line therapy for advanced metastatic or locally advanced 
disease [NCCN, 20 12; Cardoso et al, 2012]. Trastuzumab given every 21 days is preferred 
over the weekly schedule for subject convenience with similar safety and efficacy observed 
[Leyland -Jones et al,  2003].  
2.3 Endpoints

3.1 Selection of Study Population  
Subjects will be selected based on Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria listed. Waivers to eligibility 
criteria will not be allowed.  
3.2 Inclusion Criteria  
Subject is eligible for the study if all of the following apply:  
1. The subject has consented and signed  an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Independent 
Ethics Committee (IEC) approved written Informed Consent and privacy language as per 
national regulations (e.g., Hea lth Insurance Portability and Accountability Act [HIPAA] 
for U.S. sites) prior to any study -related procedures (including withdrawal of prohibited 
medication, if applicable).  
2. The subject is a female ≥ 18 years of age.  
3. The subject has histologically or cyto logically proven adenocarcinoma of the breast that 
is HER2+ defined as a score of 3+ for staining by IHC, or IHC 2+ with HER2 gene 
amplification as determined by a locally approved in situ hybridization (ISH) assay , or 
(for patients without IHC data) HER2 gene amplification.  
4. The subject has AR+ breast cancer, which is defined as any tumor cells with nuclear AR 
staining by IHC. Enrollment may be based on the local pathologist’s findings; however, 
tissue will be sent to a central pathology laboratory for asse ssment. NOTE: If a subject is 
enrolled in the study based on local pathologist results, but subsequent central 
assessment cannot confirm AR+ disease, the subject may remain in the study.  
5. The subject has metastatic disease or has locally advanced disease th at is not amendable 
to curative treatment.  
6. The subject has measurable disease or nonmeasurable, evaluable disease  per RECIST 1.1 
(NOTE:  pleural effusions, ascites or other third fluid space are not evaluable diseases per 
RECIST 1.1).  
7. The subject has recei ved at least 1 line of therapy in the metastatic or locally advanced 
disease setting:  
● A line of therapy is defined as a course of treatment at the end of which there was 
disease progression, toxicity, or in the Investigator’s opinion, maximum benefit has 
been achieved. If the subject discontinued therapy due to any other reason but 
progressed without receiving other treatment, this would be considered a line of 
therapy.  
● The subject has been documented to have progressed by determination of the 
Investigator on a regimen containing an anti -HER2 agent (includes trastuzumab 
emtansine in countries where it is not approved) as the most recent regimen or the 
most recent anti -HER2  regimen was discontinued for any toxicity, with the 
exception of a cardiotoxicity.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 ● Subjects who received <  28 days of therapy in the most recent regimen may be 
eligible upon approval from the medical monitor.  
● The subject has progressed on a trastuzumab containing regimen. If progression 
occurred within 12 months after completing trastuzumab -containing adjuvant 
treatment, this counts as having received trastuzumab but not as a line of therapy.  
8. The subject has a dequately recovered from toxicities due to  prior therapy.  
9. The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance (ECOG) status ≤ 1 
at Screening and Day 1.  
10. The subject has available at the site a representative, formalin -fixed, paraffin -embedded , 
tumor specimen that enabled the definitive diagnosis of breast cancer with adequate 
viable tumor cells in a tissue block (preferred) or ≥ 10 (20 preferred) freshly cut, 
unstained, serial slides and the associated pathology report:  
● Archival tissue from th e most recent biopsy available is preferred.  
● For subjects who are known AR+ per local pathology report, a fresh biopsy can be

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 5 TREATMENTS AND EVALU ATION  
5.1 Dosing and Administration of Study Drug(s) and Other Medication(s)  
5.1.1 Dose/Dose Regimen and Administration Period  
5.1.1.1  Enzalutamide  
Enzalutamide will be given as 160 mg/day (4 x 40  mg capsules) each day by mouth until any 
of the discontinuation criteria are met. Enzalutamide may be administered with or without 
food, and should be given around the same  time each day.  
Enzalutamide will be self -administered at home by the subject, except for visit days where 
PK samples are collected. On visit days with PK sampling, enzalutamide will be 
administered in clinic after the PK sample is collected. Subjects will  keep a diary to record 
the date and time of enzalutamide dose on the 2 days before PK visit days.  
Subjects should not make up missed or vomited doses; dosing should resume on the next 
calendar day unless otherwise instructed.  For the purposes of this st udy, a “missed dose” is 
considered a dose not administered within 4  hours of the regular dosing time.  
5.1.1.2  Trastuzumab  
Trastuzumab should be administered as approved per local guidelines (IV infusion or 
subcutaneous injection).  
Trastuzumab for infusion is typic ally given at a dose of 6 mg/kg every 21 days. For subjects 
whose last dose of anti -HER2 antibody was greater than 21 days prior to Day 1 (or for 
subjects who were on weekly trastuzumab for ≤ 2 weeks), a loading dose of 8 mg/kg will be 
administered on Day 1, followed by 6 mg/kg every 21 days thereafter until any of the 
discontinuation criteria are met.  
Trastuzumab is given as an IV infusion over 30 -90 minutes. For a loading dose, a 90 minute 
IV infusion is given or per local label. Premedication per institu tional guidelines is permitted.  
If trastuzumab is given via sub -cutaneous injection, local guidelines should be followed.  
Refer to the package insert for specific preparation instructions.  
5.1.2 Increase or Reduction in Dose of the Study Drug(s)  
5.1.2.1  Enzalutamide  
Enzalutamide treatment may be interrupted for subjects who experience a Grade ≥3 toxicity 
that is attributed to enzalutamide and cannot be ameliorated with adequate medical 
interven tion. Enzalutamide may be resumed at the original dose (160 mg/day) or at a re duced 
dose (80 mg/day or 120 mg/day), per Investigator ’s discretion. Treatment interruption for 
> 2 weeks must be discussed with the Medical Monitor. If the treatment interruption occurs for 
4 weeks, the Medical Monitor must be contacted again for approval .  Interruption of 
enzalutamide dosing for more than 4 weeks must be approved by the Medical Monitor, 
otherwise the subject will be discontinued. A dose adjustment should also be considered in 
subjects with Grade 2 toxicities that interfere with quality of  life.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 If coadministration with a strong CYP2C8 inhibitor is necessary, reduce the dose of 
enzalutamide to 80  mg once daily. If coadministration with the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor is 
discontinued, the enzalutamide dose should be returned to the dose used pri or to initiation of 
the CYP2C8 inhibitor, or to 160  mg once daily if the subject was on the CYP2C8 inhibitor at 
the start of study treatment.  
5.1.2.2  Trastuzumab  
5.1.2.2.1  Dose Modification for Infusion Reaction  
Infusion reactions will be managed according to the institutio n standard.  
5.1.2.2.2  Dose Modification for Cardiomyopathy  
Trastuzumab will be withheld for at least 4 weeks if either of the following occurs:  
≥ 16 % absolute decrease in LVEF from baseline value  
LVEF below institutional limit of normal and ≥ 10% absolute decrease in LVEF from 
baseline value  
Trastuzumab may be resumed if, within 4 to 8 weeks, the LVEF returns to normal limit and 
the absolute decrease from baseline is ≤ 15%. Trastuzumab should be discontinued for a 
persistent (> 8 weeks) LVEF decline or for suspensio n of dosing on more than 3 occasions 
for cardiomyopathy and the subject should be withdrawn from the study.  
5.1.2.2.3  Dose Modification for All Other Toxicities  
If a subject experiences an intolerable side effect, trastuzumab dosing may be held for up to 
4 weeks or until symptoms improve. If the treatment interruption will occur for more than 
4 weeks, the Medical Monitor must be contacted for approval.  Interruption of trastuzumab 
dosing for more than 4 weeks for toxicity (other than for cardiomyopathy, see 
Section  5.1.2.2.2 ) must be approved by the Medical Monitor, otherwise the subject will be 
discontinued.  
5.1.3 Previous and Concomitant Treatment  (Medication and Nonmedication 
Therapy ) 
Medications taken within 14  days before the Screening visit up to the Study 30 -Day 
Follow -up visit will be documented on the appropriate case report form as concomitant 
medication.  
All concomitant medication(s) must be reported on th e appropriate case report form. Prior 
and concomitant medications include all vitamins, herbal remedies, over the counter, and 
prescription medications.  
Concomitant administration of bisphosphonates or bone -targeting agents are acceptable if the 
subject i s on a stable regimen (per Investigator judgement) prior to Day 1. The Investigator 
should consult with Medical Monitor if new use of bone -targeting agents is deemed 
necessary during the study.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 Concomitant administration of enzalutamide with strong CYP2C8 inhibitors, strong or 
moderate CYP2C8 inducers, strong or moderate CYP3A4 inducers should be avoided. Please 
see Section 5.1.2.1  for enzalutamide do se modifications when taking concomitant CYP2C8 
inhibitors. Concomitant use of enzalutamide with narrow therapeutic index drugs that are 
metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 should be avoided. If enzalutamide is 
coadministered with warfarin (CYP2C9 s ubstrate), additional international normalized ratio 
(INR) monitoring is to be conducted.  
Subjects should avoid use of any herbal medications or dietary supplements including 
products containing Hypericum perforatum  (e.g., St. John’s Wort).  
The following medications or therapies are prohibited during the receipt of study drug:  
● Medications, including herbal therapies, with an antitumor effect (medications used to 
induce menopause in women of child -bearing potential are permitted).  
● Any investigati onal agent  
● AR antagonists (e.g., bicalutamide, flutamide, nilutamide)  
● 5-α reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride, dutasteride)  
● Systemic androgens and estrogens (vaginal estrogen creams are allowed)  
● Megestrol acetate for appetite stimulation may be used at  Investigator ’s discretion  
5.1.4 Treatment Compliance  
Study subjects should be counseled on the need to meet 100% compliance with study drug.  
Investigator or designee should ensure that study subjects meet this goal throughout the study 
period.  
Treatment comp liance should be monitored closely ; sites will perform accountability of 
enzalutamide doses dispensed and returned, and deviations in overall compliance <  80% 
should be reported to the Sponsor.  Greater than 1 consecutive missed cycle of Trastuzamab 
for re asons other than an adverse reaction should be reported to the Sponsor.  
5.1.5 Restrictions  During the Study  
Subjects of childbearing potential must use 2 acceptable methods of birth control starting at 
Screening and through 6 months after the final study drug administration.  
The 2 acceptable methods of birth control are as follows, or per local guidelines where these 
require additional description of contraceptive methods:  
● A barrier method (e.g., condom by a male partner) is required; AND  
● One of the following i s required:  
o Placement of an IUD or intrauterine system IUS;  
o Additional barrier method including occlusive cap (diaphragm or cervical/vault 
caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository;

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 5.2 Demographics and Baseline Characteristics  
5.2.1 Demographics  
Demographic information will be collected for all subjects and will include initials, ag e or 
date of birth, sex, race, and ethnicity, as local regulations allow.  
5.2.2 Medical History  
Medical history includes all significant medical conditions that have occurred or are currently 
ongoing. The condition, onset date, and recovery date will be collecte d. National Cancer 
Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) grade will be 
collected for conditions that are ongoing at the time of consent.  
5.2.3 Diagnosis of the Target Disease, Severity, and Duration of Disease  
Breast cancer diagnos is and studies related to breast cancer classification will be collected 
and will include date of diagnosis, histopathology, HER2+ status and testing method, ER and 
PgR status, details on prior therapies, and response to prior therapies.  
5.2.4 Androgen Receptor,  Estrogen Receptor and Progesterone Receptor  Status  
Subjects should have known ER and PgR status prior to screening for the study.  Results for 
AR expression will be required for eligibility assessment. Enrollment may be based on the 
local pathologist’s fi ndings; however, tissue will be sent to a central pathology laboratory for 
confirmation. AR+ breast cancer for eligibility is defined as any tumor cell(s) with nuclear 
AR staining. If a subject is enrolled in the study based on local pathologist results, b ut 
subsequent central assessment cannot confirm AR+ disease, the subject may remain in the 
study per Investigator judgment.  If sufficient tissue is available, expression levels of nuclear 
ER and PgR in tumor cells using standard assays will also be assess ed.  
A formalin -fixed paraffin -embedded tumor tissue block from the most recent biopsy 
available is preferred. If the archival specimen is insufficient or unavailable and the subject is 
known to be AR+ by local pathology report, a fresh biopsy can be done to obtain tissue for 
central AR confirmation. Tissue used for central confirmation will be shipped to and 
analyzed by a Sponsor -designated analytical laboratory. The laboratory will prepare slides for 
analysis, and then return the block to the Investigator . Tissue processing, storage, and 
shipment instructions are provided in the lab manual. If a tissue block is unavailable, then a 
minimum of 10 (preferably 20) unstained slides freshly prepared by the Institution will be 
sent to the Sponsor -designated analy tical laboratory. The slides will not be returned.  
Prescreening AR Assessment  
Subjects with HER2+ breast cancer may be approached before screening for consent to 
submit archival tissue to test for AR expression. A separate prescreening consent will be 
available to enable testing of archival tissue for AR expression before initiating other 
screening activities. Patients must sign the separate prescreening consent form if archival 
tissue is to be analyzed before the protocol screening period (i.e., 28 day s before day 1).

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 Subjects will not be allowed to undergo a biopsy for the sole purpose of determining 
eligibility for this study.  For subjects who are known AR+ per local pathology report, a fresh 
biopsy can only be done, per Investigator ’s discretion, to  obtain tissue for central AR 
confirmation if the archival specimen is insufficient or unavailable.   
Furthermore, patients must be informed that analysis of tissue will not guarantee eligibility 
for this study, as patients found to have AR+ disease must m eet all other eligibility criteria at 
the time of enrollment.   
5.3 Efficacy Assessment  
5.3.1 Radiographic Disease Assessment  
Disease assessment will be based on REC IST v.1.1 criteria [Eisenhauer et al,  2009]. Disease 
assessment will be performed by the Investigator. Radiographic imaging technique will be 
dependent on the location and degree of disease, and must be performed using either diagnostic 
computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imagin g (MRI), and/or bone scan or 
skeletal survey. Imaging may be performed at any time to confirm suspected progression of 
disease. Assessment will include tumor measurements for target lesions, nontarget lesions, and 
assessment for any new lesions. An overall  assessment will be characterized for each time 
point evaluation. At the end of study for that subject, the overall best response to the study 
regimen will be characterized. Refer to Appendix 12.6 RECIST Criteria for more detail.  
5.3.2 Disease Assessment Methods  
Baseline evaluations (with the exception of bone imaging) will be performed within 4 weeks 
prior to day 1.  Results from CT/MRI assessments perfo rmed prior to consent and within 
28 days of day 1 may be used for screening if available. All patients should have bone 
imaging to assess metastasis to the bone within 6 months prior to the Day 1 visit. 
Postbaseline evaluations including chest/abdominal/pe lvic imaging will be performed every 
8 weeks through 49, and then every 12 weeks thereafter. If a definitive new lesion is 
identified, remaining imaging is not required (for example, a CT of the chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis is not required if a new lesion is  identified in the brain).  
PR and CR require confirmation with equivalent or improved assessment no less than 
4 weeks after the date of scan that PR or CR was first observed.  
5.3.2.1  Chest/Abdominal/Pelvic Imaging and Other Measurements  
Diagnostic CT, MRI, clinic al measurement by caliper, and cytology/histology may be used to 
assess disease. CT/MRI of the chest/abdomen/pelvis as well as any other anatomical region 
appropriate for that subject’s disease will be performed. CT or MRI with contrast should be used 
unless contraindicated. The same method of assessment should be used throughout the study.  
NOTE: PET scans may not be used to assess response or progression; if PET -CT was 
performed, the CT component may be used if CT was obtained per RECIST  1.1 guidelines fo r 
gap thickness.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 5.3.2.2  Brain Imaging  
Brain imaging is required at Screening for all subjects to rule out central nervous system 
disease. A brain MRI with contrast enhancement is required unless it cannot be performed 
within 2 weeks prior to Day 1 due to feasibi lity or subject -specific contraindications. A  head 
CT may be performed in these situations after discussion with the medical monitor or 
designee. Results from brain imaging performed prior to consent and within 28 days of Day 1 
may be used for screening if  available. Additional imaging to rule out CNS metastases should 
be performed as clinically indicated.  
5.3.2.3  Bone Imaging  
All subjects should have bone imaging to assess metastasis to the bone within 6 months prior 
to the Day 1 visit.  Thereafter, subjects without bone metastasis will have bone scans only if 
clinically indicated. Subjects with suspected bone -only, measurable lesions must have bone 
lesions assessed by CT with bone windows or by MRI within 12 weeks before Day 1. 
Thereafter , measureable lytic lesions should be followed as target lesions according to 
RECIST 1.1 using the same method. Subjects with suspected bone -only, nonmeasurable 
disease should have had a bone assessment (e.g., scintigraphy or skeletal survey) performed 
within 12 weeks before Day 1. Thereafter, imaging of nonmeasurable, evaluable disease 
should be performed as clinically indicated, with a required assessment at Week 24.   
5.3.2.4  Cutaneous and Subcutaneous Lesions  
Cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions should be assesse d by physical examination with digital 
photographs that must include a metric ruler in the image. Photographs should be obtained in 
such a manner to protect subject privacy.  
5.4 Safety Assessment  
5.4.1 Height and Weight  
Height and weight will be measured using stand ard Institution practice and equipment.  
5.4.2 Vital Signs  
Vital signs will include systolic and diastolic blood pressure measured with standard 
sphygmo -manometer (mmHg), radial pulse (beats/min), and temperature (per institution 
standards). All vital signs will  be measured with the subject in the sitting or supine position.  
5.4.3 Adverse Events  
See Section 5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects for informa tion regarding AE 
collection and data handling.  
5.4.3.1  Adverse Events of Possible Hepatic Origin  
See Appendix 12.2 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment for detailed information on liver 
abnormalities, monitoring and assessment, if  the AE for a subject enrolled in a study and 
receiving study drug is accompanied by increases in liver function testing (LFT) (e.g., AST, 
ALT, bilirubin, etc.) or is suspected t o be due to hepatic dysfunction .

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 5.4.4 Laboratory Assessments  
Routine laboratory assessments for hematology, chemistry, coagulation, urinalysis, and urine 
pregnancy test will be collected and analyzed at the Institution’s local laboratory. The local 
laboratory must be accredited to perform the protocol required tests and a certificate of 
accreditation and laboratory normal ranges must be provided to the Sponsor. Please refer to 
Appendix 12.7 Laboratory Assessments for a listing of analytes to be assessed.  
5.4.5 Physical Examination  
Standard, full physical examinations will be performed at Screening and Day 1  per 
Investigator’s standard  practice.   
After Day 1, a brief symptom directed physical examination may be performed.  
New or worsening clinically significant findings on physical exam will be recorded as AEs if 
they meet the criteria in Section 5.5.1  Definition of Adverse Events.  
5.4.6 Electrocardiogram (ECG)  
A 12 -lead ECG will be performed on all subjects at the Institution and interpreted by the 
Institution’s medically trained staff. Parameters that include heart rate, PR interval, RR 
interval, QRS interval, QT interval will be collected. Abnormalities and clinical significance as 
judged by the Investigator will be reported as well. It is recommended that ECG reports are 
printed  in duplicate and photocopied to prevent fading.  
ECG should be obtained after the subject has rested quietly and is awake in a fully supine 
position or semi -recumbent, if supine not tolerated) for 10 minutes.  
All on -treatment ECGs will be obtained prior to  drug administration. Whenever a study 
procedure coincides with the scheduled time point for an ECG, the study activities are ideally 
undertaken in a fixed sequence: ECG first, vital signs (blood pressure and heart rate) second, 
and any type of blood draws  as the last assessment.  
5.4.7 Echocardiogram/MUGA  
Echocardiogram/MPS/MUGA will be used to measure LVEF. The same method used at 
baseline for each subject must be used throughout the study.  
5.4.8 Performance Status  
The ECOG scale [ Oken  et al,  1982 ] will be used to ass ess performance status.  Refer to 
Appendix 12.5 ECOG Performance Status Scale.  
5.5 Adverse Events and Other Safety Aspects  
5.5.1 Definition of Adverse Events  (AEs)  
An AE is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a study drug 
or has undergone study procedures and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship 
with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unintended sign (inc luding an abnormal

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal 
(investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product.  
AEs are events that begin or worsen from the time o f informed consent through the 30 Day 
Follow -up period. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) are events that begin or 
worsen from the date of first study drug administration through the 30 Day Follow -up period 
or start of subsequent treatment of an an ti-neoplastic, whichever occurs first.  
An abnormality identified during a medical test (e.g., laboratory parameter, vital sign, ECG 
data, physical exam) should be defined as an AE only if the abnormality meets one of the 
following criteria:  
● Induces clinica l signs or symptoms  
● Requires active intervention  
● Requires interruption or discontinuation of study medication  
● The abnormality or investigational value is clinically significant in the opinion of the 
Investigator.  
In the case of clinically disease progression, individual signs and symptoms that are secondary 
to disease progression will be collected as AEs.  If disease progression is the cause of death, 
then “breast cancer progression” should be listed as the AE term  with outcome as fatal.  
5.5.2 Definition of Serious Adverse Events  
An AE is considered “serious” if, in the view of either the Investigator or Sponsor, it results 
in any of the following outcomes:   
● Results in death  
● Is life threatening (an AE is considered “life -threatening” if, in the view of either the 
Investigator or Sponsor, its occurrence places the subject at immediate risk of death. It 
does not include an AE that, had it occurred in a more severe form, might have caused 
death)  
● Results i n persistent or significant disability/incapacity or substantial disruption of the 
ability to conduct normal life functions  
● Results in congenital anomaly, or birth defect  
● Requires inpatient hospitalization or leads to prolongation of hospitalization 
(hosp italization for treatment/observation/examination caused by AE is to be considered 
as serious)  
● Other medically important events  
Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting 
is appropriate in other situations,  such as important medical events that may not be 
immediately life -threatening or result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the 
subject or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
definition above. These event s, including those that may result in disability/incapacity, 
should also usually be considered serious. Examples of such events are intensive treatment in 
an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or convulsions 
that do not r esult in hospitalization; or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 Safety events of interest on the medicinal products administered to the subject as part of the 
study (e.g., study drug, comparator, background therapy) that may require expedited 
reporting and/or safety evaluation include, but are not limited to:  
● Overdose of the medicinal product(s)  
● Suspected abuse/misuse of the medicinal product(s)  
● Inadvertent or accidental exposure to the medicinal product(s)  
● Medication error involving the medicin al product(s) (with or without subject/patient 
exposure to the Sponsor medicinal product, e.g., name confusion)  
All of the events of interest noted above should be recorded on the electronic case report 
form ([e]CRF). Any situation involving these events o f interest that also meets the criteria for 
an SAE should be recorded on the AE page of the (e)CRF and marked ‘serious’ and the SAE 
worksheet.  
The Sponsor has a list of events that they classify as “always serious” events. If an  
AE is reported that is cons idered to be an event per this classification as  
“always serious ,” additional information on the event may be requested.  
5.5.3 Criteria for Causal Relationship to the Study Drug  
Causal relationship will be assessed for enzalutamide and trastuzumab. Separate asse ssments 
for each agent will be obtained.  
AEs that fall under either "Possible" or "Probable" should be defined as " AEs whose 
relationship to the study drugs could not be ruled out" . 
Causal 
relationship to the 
study drug  Criteria for causal relationship  
Not Related  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
temporal relationship to drug administration which makes a causal 
relationship improbable, and/or in which other drugs, chemicals or 
underlying disease provide plausible explanatio ns. 
Possible  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, but which 
could also be explained by concurrent disease or other drugs or 
chemicals. Information on drug withdrawal may be  lacking or 
unclear.  
Probable  A clinical event, including laboratory test abnormality, with a 
reasonable time sequence to administration of the drug, unlikely to 
be attributed to concurrent disease or other drugs or chemicals, and 
which follows a clinically reasonable response on re - administration 
(rechallenge) or withdrawal (dechallenge).

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 5.5.4 Criteria  for Defining the Severity of an Adverse Event  
AEs, including abnormal clinical laboratory values, will be graded usi ng the NCI CTCAE 
(Version 4.03)  [CTEP, 2010]. For terms not specified within NCI CTCAE, the following 
guidelines should be used to determine grade:  
Grade  Assessment Standard  
1 Mild; Asymptomatic, or mild symptoms, clinical or diagnostic observations 
noted; intervention not indicated.  
2 Moderate; Local or noninvasive intervention indicated; limiting age -appropriate 
instrumental activities of daily living.  
3 Severe or medically significant but not immediately life threatening, 
hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization indicated; disabling; limiting self -
care activities of daily living.  
4 Life threatening consequences, urgent intervention indicated  
5 Death related to AE  
5.5.5 Reporting  of Serious Adverse Events  
In the case of a n SAE, the Investigator must contact the Sponsor by telephone or fax 
immediately (within 24 hours of awareness).  
The Investigator should complete and submit an SAE Worksheet containing all information 
that is required by the Regulatory Authorities to the Sp onsor by fax immediately (within 
24 hours of awareness).  If the faxing of an SAE Worksheet  is not possible or is not possible 
within 24 hours, the local drug safety contact should be informed by phone.   
For contact details, see Section II Contact Details of Key Sponsor's Personnel.  
If there are any questions, or if clarification is needed regarding the SAE, please contact the 
Sponsor's Medical Monitor/Exper t or his/her designee (see Section II Contact Details of Key 
Sponsor’s Personnel).  
Follow -up information for the event should be sent promptly (within 7 days of the initial 
notification).  
Full details of the SAE should be recorded on the medical records and on the (e)CRF.  
The following minimum information is required:  
● ISN/Study number,  
● Subject number, sex and age,  
● The date of report,  
● A description of the SAE (event, seriousness of the event), and  
● Causal relationship to the study drug.  
The Sponsor or Sponsor's designee will submit expedited safety reports (i.e. , Investigational 
New Drug (IND) Safety Reports) to the regulatory agencies (i.e. , FDA) as necessa ry, and will 
inform the Investigators of such regulatory reports. Investigators must submit safety reports

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 as required by their IRB/IEC  within timelines set by regional regulations (i.e. , EU, electronic 
common technical document [eCTD ], FDA). Documentation  of the submission to and receipt 
by the IRB/IEC of expedited safety reports should be retained by the site.  
The Sponsor will notify all Investigators responsible for ongoing clinical studies with the 
study drug of all SAEs which require submission p er loc al requirements IRB/IEC/ head of the 
study site.  
The Investigator should provide written documentation of IRB/IEC notification for each 
report to the Sponsor.  
You may contact the Sponsor's Medical Monitor/Expert for any other problem related to the 
safety, welfare, or rights of the subject.  
5.5.6 Follow -up of Adverse Events  
All AEs occurring during the study (through the 30 Day Follow -up period or start of 
subsequent treatment of an anti -neoplastic, whichever occurs first) are to be followed until 
resolved or judg ed to be no longer clinically significant, or until they become chronic to the 
extent that they can be fully characterized.  
If during AE follow -up, the AE progresse s to an "SAE ," or if a subject experiences a new 
SAE , the Investigator must  immediately report the information  to the Sponsor .  
Please refer to Appendix 12.2 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment  for detailed 
instructions on Drug Indu ced Liver Injury (DILI).  
5.5.7 Monitoring of Common Serious Adverse Events  
Common SAEs  are SAEs commonly anticipated to occur in the study population independent 
of drug exposure.  SAEs classified as “common” are provided in Appendix 12.3 Common 
Serious Adverse Events  for your reference.  The list does NOT change your reporting 
obligations or prevent the need to report an AE meeting the definition of an SAE as detailed 
above.   
The purpose of this list is to alert you that some events reported as SAEs may not require 
expedited reporting by the Sponsor to the regulatory authorities based on the classification of 
“common SAEs ” as specified in Appendix  12.3 Common Serious Adverse Events . The 
Sponsor will monitor these events throughout the course of the study for any change in 
frequency.  Any changes to this list will be communicated to the participating investigational 
sites. Investigators must report individual occurrences of these events as stated in 
Section  5.5.5  Reporting of Serious Adverse Events.   
5.5.8 Procedure  in Case of Pregnancy  
If a subject becomes pregnant during the study dosing period, study medication should be 
discontinued.  If a subject becomes pregnant during the study dosing period or with in 
6 months from the discontinuation of dosing, the Investigator should report the information to 
the Sponsor  as if it is an SAE . The expected date of delivery or expected date of the end of

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 the pregnancy, last menstruation, estimated conception date, preg nancy result and neonatal 
data etc., should be included in this information.  
The Investigator will follow the medical status of the mother, as well as the fetus, as if the 
pregnancy is an SAE and will report the outcome to the Sponsor.  
The Investigator sho uld report the outcome of the pregnancy (independent of outcome, e.g., 
full term delivery, preterm delivery, spontaneous abortion, induced abortion, stillbirth, death 
of newborn, congenital anomaly (including anomaly in a miscarried fetus), in accordance 
with the same reporting procedure as for SAEs. The date of outcome of the pregnancy, 
gestational age, date of birth and neonatal data, etc., should be included in this information. 
Additional information regarding the outcome of a pregnancy (which is catego rized as an 
SAE) is mentioned below.  
● "Spontaneous abortion " includes miscarriage, abortion and missed abortion  
● Death of an infant within 1 month after birth should be reported as an SAE  regardless of 
its relationship with the study drug  
● If an infant dies m ore than 1 month after the birth, it should be reported if a relationship 
between the death and intrauterine exposure to the study drug is judged as "possible " by 
the Investigator  
● In the case of a delivery of a living newborn, the "normality " of the infant  is evaluated at 
the birth  
● Unless a congenital anomaly are identified prior to spontaneous abortion or miscarriage, 
the embryo or fetus should be assessed for congenital defects by visual examination  
5.5.9 Emergency  Procedures and Management of Overdose  
If an overdose of enzalutamide occurs, the Medical Monitor must be contacted. An overdose 
is defined as at least 2 daily doses of study drug taken on the same calendar day. In the event 
of an overdose, stop treatment with study drug and initiate general supporti ve measures 
taking into consideration the enzalutamide t 1/2 of 5.8 days. The medical monitor must be 
contacted in the event of a study drug overdose.  
Neither the effects of overdose of enzalutamide nor an antidote to overdose are known. 
Subjects may be at increased risk of seizures following an overdose of enzalutamide.  
In the event of suspected trastuzumab overdose, refer to the approved Package Insert, 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC), or local product information supplied by the 
manufacturer.  
5.5.10  Supply of New Information Affecting the Conduct of the Study  
When new information becomes available that is necessary for conducting the clinical study 
properly, the Sponsor will inform all Investigators involved in the clinical study as well as the 
regulator y authorities. Investigators should inform the IRB/IEC of such information when 
needed.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 5.5.11  Urgent Safety Measures  
An Urgent Safety Measure (USM) i s an intervention, which is not defined by the protocol 
and can be put in place with immediate effect without n eeding to gain prior approval by the 
sponsor, relevant Competent Authorities, IRB/IEC, where applicable, in order to protect 
study participants from any immediate hazard to their health and/or safety. Either the 
Investigator or the sponsor can initiate an USM. The cause of an USM can be safety, product 
or procedure related.  
5.5.12  Reporting Urgent Safety Measures  
In the event of a potential USM, the Investigator must contact the Astellas Study Physician 
(within 24 h ours of awareness).  Full details of the potenti al USM are to be recorded in the 
subject’s medical records.  The sponsor may request additional information related to the 
event to support their evaluation.  
If the event is confirmed to be an USM the sponsor will take appropriate action to ensure the 
safety and welfare of the patients. These actions may include but are not limited to a change 
in study procedures or study treatment, halting further enrollment in the trial, or stopping the 
study in its entirety. The sponsor or sponsor's designee will notify  Competent Authorities and 
concerned Ethics Committee within the timelines required per current local regulations, and 
will inform the Investigators as required. When required, Investigators must notify their 
IRB/IEC within timelines set by regional regula tions.  
5.6 Test Drug Concentration  
5.6.1 Pharmacokinetic Assessments  
Plasma samples will be analyzed to determine enzalutamide and N -desmethyl enzalutamide 
concentrations and serum samples will be analyzed to determine trastuzumab concentrations 
in all subjects trea ted in the study. PK samples will be obtained before enzalutamide and 
trastuzumab dosing in the clinic. Blood samples will be collected from a vein or port that is 
not used for drug infusions. Blood sampling, processing, storage and shipment instructions 
are provided in a lab manual. Samples will be shipped to and analyzed by a Sponsor 
designated analytical laboratory.  
Subjects will keep a diary to record date and time of enzalutamide doses before PK visit days.  
The date and time that the subject took the  previous 2 doses of study drug must be recorded 
at each PK sample collection visit. The PK sample will be collected even if the subject 
inadvertently took her daily dose of study drug earlier the same day.  When this occurs, the 
dose that was taken on the  same day will be recorded as one of the previous doses, and the 
subject will take no additional study drug that day.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 samples will be transferred to the analytical laboratory. Samples will be analyzed using 
appropriate validated methods. The extract ed deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) will be stored at 
the analytical laboratory. A  pharmacogenomics (PGx) analysis plan may be prepared, if 
necessary, and exploratory analysis will be carried out before the completion of the study. PGx 
samples will be disposed after the completion of the study . Genetic information which has an 
established relevance to an individual for prescription of approved medicines can be disclosed 
to subjects upon their request .  
5.7.3 Blood Sample for Future Pharmacogen omic Analysis  (Retrospect ive 
Pharmacogenomic  Analysis)  
PGx research may be conducted in the future to analyze  or determine  genes of relevance to 
clinical response, PK, and toxicity/safety issues. After enrollment (see Schedule of 
Assessments), a 5 mL sample of whole blood for poss ible retrospective PGx analysis  will be 
collected using a vacutainer tube containing EDTA. After collection, gently invert the blood 
sample 8 to 10 times. The blood collection tube may either be stored upright at 4°C for up to 
5 days prior to shipment or s tored frozen at -20°C or below at the site for extended storage. 
Samples will be shipped to a Sponsor designated banking contract research organization 
(CRO).  
Labels should uniquely identify each sample and contain at least:  
● Protocol number ( 9785 -CL-1121 ), 
● Subject number, and  
● Purpose and biological matrix (i.e., “biobanking ,” “whole blood”).  
Details on sample collection, labeling, storage and shipment procedures will be provided in a 
separate laboratory manual.  
The results of the Retrospective PGx analysis will not be provided to any Investigators or 
subjects, nor can the results be requested at a later date.  
See Appendix 12.4, Retrospective Pharmacoge nomic  Sub-study  for further details on the 
banking procedures . 
5.8 Total Amount of Blood  
The total amount of blood for each subject will vary depending on the course of their disease, 
how long they stay on treatment, and local laboratory requirements. At any time during the 
study, if any laboratory abnormalities are found for a subject, additi onal blood may be drawn 
for monitoring.  
The maximum amount of blood estimated for collection over any 1 month period is from 
Screening through the Week 4 visit where approximately 65 mL may be drawn. The maximum 
amount of blood estimated over any approxima te 3 month period is from Day 1 through 
Week  13 where approximately 106 mL may be drawn.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 6.3 Discontinuation of the Study  
The Sponsor may terminate this study prematurely, either in its entirety or at any study site, 
for reasonable cause provided that written notice is submitted in advance of the intended 
termination . Advance notice is not required if the study is stopped due to safety concerns.  If 
the Sponsor terminates the study for safety reasons, the Sponsor will immediately notify the 
Investigator and subsequently provide written instructions for study termination . 
7 STATISTICAL METHODOL OGY  
The statistical analysis will be coordinated by the responsible biostatistician of APGD. A 
Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be written to provide details of the analysis, along with 
specifications for tables, listings and figu res to be produced. The SAP will be drafted before 
first subject enrolled and finalized before the database soft lock. Any changes from the 
analyses planned in SAP will be justified in the Clinical Study Report (CSR).  
Prior to Database Lock, a Final Review  of Data and Tables, Listings and Figures (TLFs) 
Meeting will be held to allow a review of the clinical trial data and to verify the data that will 
be used for analysis set classification. If required, consequences for the statistical analysis 
will be disc ussed and documented. A meeting to determine analysis set classifications may 
also be held prior to database lock.  
In general, all data will be summarized with descriptive statistics (number of subjects, mean, 
median, standard deviation, minimum, and maxim um) for continuous endpoints, and 
frequency and percentage for categorical endpoints.  
7.1 Sample Size  
The sample size is sufficient to determine the absence or presence of an efficacy signal. The 
sample sizes for the first and second stage were determined usin g Simon’s 2-stage design. 
The null hypothesis that the true CBR is 10% will be tested against a 1-sided alternative at a 
5% significance level. In the first stage, 21 evaluable AR+ subjects will be evaluated; the 
study will stop if < 3 evaluable subjects s how confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1, or 
prolonged SD (≥ 24 weeks). Otherwise, the study will continue to enroll up to 66 evaluable 
AR+ subjects. This design has a statistical power of 90% when the true CBR is 25% (East 
version 5.4, Cytel Inc). To illustr ate the precision with a total of 66 subjects: if the observed 
CBR is 40%, then the 90% confidence interval will be within the 30% to 50% range.  
Taking into account the number of nonevaluable subjects, approximately 80 subjects w ere 
planned to be enrolled  to get 66 evaluable AR+ subjects.   
7.2 Analysis Set  
Detailed criteria for analysis sets will be laid out in Classification Specifications and the 
allocation of subjects to analysis sets will be determined prior to database hard -lock.  
The All Enrolled Subject s (AES) consists of all subjects who are found to be eligible for 
treatment and enrolled using the IRT at the day 1 visit.

PPS is not defined for this study and separate analyses will not be performed on a PPS . 
7.2.4 Safety Analysis Set (SAF)  
For the statistical summary of the safety data, the safety analysis set (SAF) will be used. The 
SAF is defined as all subjects who have received at least partial or full dose of study drug.  
7.2.5 Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set (PKAS)  
The pharmacokinetic analysis set (PKAS) consists of the subset of the SAF population for 
which at least 1 quantifiable enzalutamide, N -desmethyl enzalutamide, or trastuzumab 
concentration value after Week 4 is available. Additional subjects may be excluded f rom the 
PKAS at the discretion of the pharmacokineticist. Any formal definitions for exclusion of 
subjects or time -points from the PKAS will be documented.  
7.2.6 Pharmacodynamic Analysis Set (PDAS)  
The pharmacodynamic analysis set (PDAS) will include the subjec ts from the SAF 
population for whom sufficient PD measurements (a baseline and at least 1 postbaseline 
sample after Week 4) were collected. The PDAS will be used for all analyses of PD data.  
7.3 Demographics and Other Baseline Characteristics  
Demographics  and other baseline characteristics will be summarized for the SAF. Descriptive 
statistics will include number of subjects, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median and 
maximum for continuous endpoints, and frequency and percentage for categorical endpoin ts.  
7.4 Analysis of Efficacy  
The primary analyses will be done in the EES, while all efficacy analyses will be done in 
both the EES and FAS. If more than 5 subjects are enrolled into the study but had less than 
10% of tumor cells with nuclear expression, and  received at least 1 dose of study drug, the 
efficacy analyses will also be conducted in this subset of FAS.  Further details will be 
presented in the statistical analysis plan.  
The totality of evidence from all primary  and secondary efficacy variables on the E ES will be 
used to evaluate the biologic activity of enzalutamide in combination with trastuzumab.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 Subjects whose disease is not confirmed to be AR+ upon central review may stay on study; 
however, they will not contribute to the primary and secondary efficacy analyses.  
7.4.1 Analysis of Primary Endpoint  
7.4.1.1  Primary Analysis  
The primary efficacy endpoint, (confirmed CR or PR according to RECIST 1.1 criteria or SD 
≥ 24 weeks) will be presented using descriptive statistics and will be summarized including 
95% 2-sided exact confidence intervals.  
7.4.1.2  Secondary Analysis

7.4.3 Analysis of Exploratory  Endpoints  
All variables will be presented as descriptive statistics.  
7.5 Analysis of Safety  
Safety analyses will be conducted using the SAF. The SAF is defined as all subjects who 
have initiated at least 1 or partial dose of study drug. The treatment emerge nt period will be 
defined as the period of time from the first dose date of study drug to 30 days after the last 
dose date of study drug or the start of subsequent treatment (whichever is first). Safety will be 
assessed through descriptive statistics for t he frequency of AEs by system organ class (SOC), 
preferred term (PT), and NCI CTCAE grade, the frequency of treatment discontinuations due 
to AEs, vital signs, ECG, LVEF, and laboratory evaluations.  
7.5.1 Adverse Events  
The severity of all AEs is to be evaluate d by the Investigator based on the NCI CTCAE, 
version 4.03. All AEs will be coded to preferred term and system organ class using Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The number and percentage of subjects 
with TEAEs  will be presented by Me dDRA system organ class and preferred term, 
relationship to study treatment, and NCI CTCAE grade. A subject reporting the same AE 
more than once is counted once and at the maximum severity or strongest relationship to 
study drug treatment, when calculating  incidence.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 7.5.2 Laboratory Assessments  
Laboratory data consist of hematology, chemistry, coagulation, and urine dipstick laboratory 
test results. Where applicable, NCI CTCAE version 4.03 will be used to categorize toxicity 
grades for the laboratory parameters . Laboratory shift tables compared to baseline results for 
each subsequent visit will be produced. For each laboratory parameter, the baseline 
laboratory value is defined as the last laboratory value collected on or prior to the first dose 
date of enzaluta mide.  
7.5.3 Vital Signs  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize vital sign results and changes from baseline 
by time point. Vital signs data will be displayed in listings.  
7.5.4 ECGs  
The 12 -lead ECG results will be summarized by time point.  
7.5.5 LVEF  
Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize vital sign LVEF and changes from baseline 
by time point.  
7.6 Analysis of Pharmacokinetics  
PK analyses will be conducted using the PKAS.  
The enzalutamide, N -desmethyl enzalutamide, and trastuzumab concentration -time data wi ll 
be summarized by descriptive statistics at each visit. Additional model -based analyses may 
be performed and will be described in a separate population PK analysis plan.  
7.6.1 Estimation of Pharmacokinetic Parameters  
Enzalutamide and N -desmethyl enzalutamide concentration -time data may be incorporated in 
a population PK model.  The analysis plan and results would be reported separately from the 
clinical study report. Similar analysis may be done on the trastuzumab levels, which will be 
reported separately too.  
7.6.2 Concentration -Response Relationship Analysis  
An exploratory population PK -PD analysis may be performed to investigate the relationship 
of enzalutamide and N -desmethyl enzalutamide exposure on circulating hormone 
concentrations, efficacy measures, and possibly safety endpoints. The details of the analysis 
would be provided in a separate population PK -PD analysis plan and the results will be 
reported separately from the clinical study report.

7.8 Protocol Deviations and Other Analyses  
Protocol deviations as defined in Section 8.1.6  Protocol Deviations wil l be summarized for 
all enrolled subjects by site. A data listing will be provided by site and subject.  
The protocol deviation criteria will be uniquely identified in the summary table and listing. 
The unique identifiers will be as follows:  
PD1 - Entered i nto the study even though they did not satisfy entry criteria,  
PD2 - Developed withdrawal criteria during the study and was not withdrawn,  
PD3 - Received wrong treatment or incorrect dose,  
PD4 - Received excluded concomitant treatment.  
7.9 Interim Analysis (a nd Early Discontinuation of the Clinical Study)  
Recruitment will continue if there are 3 or more subjects with clinical benefit in the first 
21 evaluable AR+ subjects from the evaluable set. If there are less than 3 subjects who 
demonstrate a confirmed CR or PR per RECIST 1.1, or prolonged SD of ≥ 24 weeks (using 
all available data), recruitment will be stopped.  If the study is terminated early for reasons 
other than safety, and the subject is receiving clinical benefit per Investigator ’s judgment, the 
subject may continue on study medication until they have disease progression as defined per 
RECIST.  
Tumor response will be monitored continuously throughout Stage 1, therefore it is expected 
that the decision to expand enrollment using the CBR after 24 weeks  will be made before the 
21st subject is evaluated.   
7.10 Handling of Missing Data, Outliers, Visit Windows, and Other 
Information  
As a general principle, no imputation of missing data will be done. Exceptions are the start and 
stop dates of AEs and concomitant  medication. The imputed dates will be used to allocate the 
concomitant medication and AEs to a treatment period, in addition to determining whether an 
AE is/is not treatment emergent. Listings of the AEs and concomitant medications will present 
the actual  partial dates; imputed dates will not be shown.

The Investigator and the study site must accept monitoring and auditing by the Sponsor or 
delegated CRO as well a s inspections from the IRB /IEC  and relevant regulatory authorities. 
In these instances, they must provide all study -related records, such as source documents 
(refer to  Section 8.1.2  "Specification of Source Documents") when they are requested by the 
Sponsor monitors and auditors, the IRB /IEC , or regulatory authorities. The confidentiality of 
the subject's identities shall be well protected consistent  with local and national regulations 
when the source documents are subject to direct access.  
8.1.5 Data Management  
Data Management will be coordinated by the Global Data Science department of the Sponsor 
in accordance with the standard operating procedures (SOPs ) for data management. All study 
specific processes and definitions will be documented  by Data Management. (e)CRF 
completion will be described in the (e)CRF instructions. Coding of medical terms and 
medications will be performed using MedDRA and World Heal th Organization (WHO) Drug 
Dictionary respectively.  
8.1.6 Protocol Deviations  
A protocol deviation is generally an unplanned excursion from the protocol that is not 
implemented  or intended as a systematic change. The Investigator  is responsible for ensuring 
the study is conducted in accordance with the procedures and evaluations described in this 
protocol and must protect the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects. The Investigator  should 
not implement any deviation from, or chan ges of, the protocol, unless it is necessary to 
eliminate an immediate hazard to trial subjects.   
A protocol  waiver is a documented prospective approval of a request from an Investigator to 
deviate from the protocol.  Protocol waivers are strictly prohibi ted. 
For the purposes of this protocol, deviations requiring notification to Sponsor are defined as 
any subject who:  
● Entered into the study even though they did not satisfy entry criteria.  
● Developed withdrawal criteria during the study and not withdrawn  
● Received wro ng treatment or incorrect dose.  
● Received ex cluded concomitant treatment.  
When one of the above deviations from the protocol  is identified for an individual subject, 
the Investigator or designee must ensure the Sponsor is notified. The Sponsor w ill follow -up 
with the Investigator, as applicable, to assess the deviation and the poss ible impact to the 
safety and/ or efficacy of the subject to determine subject continuation in the study.  
If a deviation  impacts the safety of a subject, the Investigato r must contact the Sponsor 
immediately.  
The Investigator will also assure that deviations meeting IRB/IEC and applicable regulatory 
authorities’ criteria are documented and communicated appropriately. All documentation and

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 12.2 Liver Safety Monitoring and Assessment  
Any subject enrolled in a clinical study with active drug therapy and reveals an increase of 
serum aminotransferases (AT) to > 3 × ULN (to > 5 × ULN in subjects with liver metastases), 
or bilirubin > 2 × ULN, should undergo detailed testing for liver enzymes (including at least 
ALT, AST, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and total bilirubin [ TBL]). Testing  should be repeated 
within 48 -72 hours of notification of the test results. For studies for which a central laboratory is 
used, alerts will be generated by the central lab regarding moderate and severe liver abnormality 
to inform the Investigator, study mo nitor and study team. Subjects should be asked if they have 
any symptoms suggestive of hepatobiliary dysfunction.  
Definition of Liver Abnormalities  
Confirmed abnormalities will be characterized as moderate and severe where ULN:  
 ALT or AST   Total Bilirubin  
Moderate  > 3 x ULN (in patients without liver 
metastases), > 5 x ULN (in patients with liver 
metastases)  or > 2 x ULN  
Severe*  > 3 x ULN  and > 2 x ULN  
In addition, the subject should be considered to have severe hepatic abnormalities for any of 
the following:  
● ALT or AST > 8 × ULN  
● ALT  or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks (in the absence of liver metastases)  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and INR > 1.5 (If INR testing is applicable/evaluated)  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).  
The Investigator may determine that abnormal liver function results, other than as described 
above, may qualify as moder ate or severe abnormalities and require additional monitoring and 
follow -up. 
Follow -up Procedures  
Confirmed moderate and severe abnormalities in hepatic functions should be thoroughly 
characterized by obtaining appropriate expert consultations, detailed pe rtinent history, physical 
examination and laboratory tests. The site should complete the Liver Abnormality Case Report 
Form (LA -CRF) that has been developed globally and can be activated for any study or 
appropriate document. Subjects with confirmed abnorm al liver function testing should be 
followed as described below.  
Confirmed moderately abnormal LFTs should be repeated 2  to 3 times weekly then weekly or 
less if abnormalities stabilize or the study drug has been discontinued and the subject is 
asymptomat ic. 
Severe hepatic liver function abnormalities as defined above, in the absence of another etiology 
may be considered an important medical event and may be reported as a n SAE. The Sponsor

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 should be contacted and informed of all subjects for whom severe he patic liver function 
abnormalities possibly attributable to study drug are observed.  
To further assess abnormal hepatic laboratory findings, the Investigator is expected to:  
● Obtain a more detailed history of symptoms and prior or concurrent diseases. 
Sympt oms and new onset -diseases should be recorded as ‘ AEs’ on the AE page of 
(e)CRF. Illnesses and conditions such as hypotensive events, and decompensated 
cardiac disease that may lead to secondary liver abnormalities should be noted. 
Nonalcoholic steatohepat itis (NASH) is seen in obese hyperlipoproteinemic, and/or 
diabetic patients and may be associated with fluctuating aminotransferase levels. The 
Investigator should ensure that the medical history form captures any illness that 
predates study enrollment tha t may be relevant in assessing hepatic function.  
● Obtain a history of concomitant drug use (including nonprescription medication, 
complementary and alternative medications), alcohol use, recreational drug use, and 
special diets. Medications, including dose,  should be entered on the concomitant 
medication page of the (e)CRF. Information on alcohol, other substance use, and diet 
should be entered on the LA -CRF or an appropriate document.  
● Obtain a history of exposure to environmental chemical agents.  
● Based on t he subject’s history, other testing may be appropriate including:  
o acute viral hepatitis (A,B, C, D, E or other infectious agents)  
o ultrasound or other imaging to assess biliary tract disease  
o other laboratory tests including INR, direct bilirubin  
● Consider gastroenterology or hepatology consultations.  
● Submit results for any additional testing and possible etiology on the LA -CRF or an 
appropriate document.  
Study Discontinuation  
In the absence of an explanation for increased LFT’s, such as viral hepatitis, pre existing or 
acute liver disease, presence of liver metastases, or exposure to other agents associated with 
liver injury, the subject may be discontinued from the study. The Investigator may determine 
that it is not in the subject’s best interest to continu e study enrollment. Discontinuation of 
treatment should be considered if:  
● ALT or AST > 8 × ULN  
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN for more than 2 weeks (in subjects without liver metastases)  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN and TBL > 2 × ULN or INR > 1.5 (if INR testing is 
applicab le/evaluated)  
● ALT or AST > 5 × ULN and (TBL > 2 × ULN in patients with liver metastases)  
● ALT or AST > 3 × ULN with the appearance of fatigue, nausea, vomiting, right upper 
quadrant pain or tenderness, fever, rash and/or eosinophilia (> 5%).  
In addition, i f close monitoring for a subject with moderate or severe hepatic laboratory tests 
is not possible, drug should be discontinued.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 *Hy’s Law Definition -Drug -induced jaundice caused by hepatocellular injury, without a 
significant obstructive component, has a h igh rate of bad outcomes, from 10  to 50% 
mortality (or transplant).” The 2 “requirements” for Hy’s Law are:1. Evidence that a drug 
can cause hepatocellular -type injury, generally has shown by an increase in transaminase 
elevations higher 3 times the upper limit of normal (“2 x ULN elevations are too common in 
treated and untreated patients to be discriminating”). 2. Cases of increased bilirubin (at least 
2 x ULN) with concurrent transaminase elevations at least 3 x ULN and no evidence of 
intra- or extra -hepatic bilirubin obstruction (elevated alkaline ph osphatase)or Gilbert’s 
syndrome  [Temple R. Hy's law: predicting serious hepatotoxicity. Pharmacoepidemiol  Drug

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 12.4 Retrospective Pharmacogenomic  Sub-Study  
INTRODUCTION  
PGx research aims to provide information regarding how naturally occurring changes in a 
subject’s ge ne and/or expression based on genetic variation may impact what treatment options 
are best suited for the subject. Through investigation of PGx by technologies such as 
genotyping, gene sequencing, statistical genetics and Genome -Wide Association Studies 
(GWAS), the relationship between gene profiles and a drug’s kinetics, efficacy or toxicity may 
be better understood. As many diseases may be influenced by 1 or more genetic variations, 
PGx research may identify which genes are involved in determining the way  a subject may or 
may not respond to a drug.  
OBJECTIVES  
The PGx research that may be conducted in the future with acquired blood samples is 
exploratory. The objective of this research will be to analyze  or determine  genes of relevance 
to clinical response,  pharmacokinetics, and toxicity/safety issues.  
By analyzing genetic variations, it may be possible to predict an individual subject’s response 
to treatment in terms of efficacy and/or toxicity.  
SUBJECT PARTICIPATIO N 
Subjects who have consented to participa te in this study may participate in this PGx sub-
study. As part of this sub -study, subjects must provide separate written consent prior to 
providing any blood samples that may be used at a later time for genetic analysis.  
SAMPLE COLLECTION AND STORAGE  
Subjects who consent to participate in this sub -study will provide one 5 ml tube of whole blood 
per Astellas’ instructions. Each sample will be identified by the unique subject number (first 
code).  Samples will be shipped frozen to a designated banking CRO eit her directly from site or 
via a central laboratory as directed by Astellas.  
BANKING  CRO STORAGE AND SAMPLE CODING   
Once received at the banking CRO, the samples will be assigned a unique sample code (second 
code) and stored frozen. A table linking the subj ect number (first code) with the 
newly -assigned sample code (second code) will be  kept by the banking CRO. PGx analysis 
will be conducted using the second code only.  
PGx ANALYSIS  
Details on the potential PGx analysis cannot be established yet. Astellas may  initiate the PGx 
analysis i n case evidence suggests that genetic variants may be influencing  the drug’s kinetics, 
efficacy and/ or safety. Prior to initiating any analysis on the banked samples, the Astellas 
ethical committee (AREC) must approve the analys is plan.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 DISPOSAL OF PGx  SAMPLES/ DATA  
All PGx samples collected will be stored for a period of up to 15 years following study 
database hardlock. If there is no requirement for analysis, the whole blood sample will be 
destroyed after the planned storage per iod. The subject has the right to withdraw consent at any 
time. When a subject’s withdraw notification is received, the PGx sample will be destroyed. 
The results of any PGx analysis conducted on a sample prior to its withdrawal will be retained 
at Astellas  indefinitely . 
INFORMATION DISCLOSU RE TO THE SUBJECTS  
Exploratory PGx analysis may be conducted following the conclusion of the clinical study, if 
applicable. The results of the genetic analysis will not be provided to any Investigators or 
subjects, nor can the results be requested at a later date.  Any information that is obtained from 
the PGx analysis will be the property of Astellas.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 12.6 RECIST 1.1 Criteria  
The following is a summary of RECIST 1.1 criteria to be used for the s tudy. Refer to 
Eisenhauer et al,  2009 for further details.  
Baseline Evaluations  
Assessment must occur during the Screening period.  
● Measurable lesions at baseline: tumor lesions must be accurately measured in at least one 
dimension and have a minimum diameter of 10  mm by CT scan when slice thickness is 
5 mm or less OR twice the slice thickness of scan if slice thickness is greater than 5  mm. 
A lesion that is 10  mm by caliper measurement b y clinical exam may be considered 
measurable. Lymph nodes must have a minimum diameter of 15  mm in the short axis by 
CT scan when slice thickness is 5  mm or less.  
● Target Lesions: a maximum of 5 lesions and maximum of 2 lesions per organ 
representative of a ll organs can be recorded.  
● Nontarget lesions: all other lesions.  
Assessment methods:  
● CT, MRI: CT slice thickness should be 5  mm or less, however if it is greater than 5  mm, 
the minimum size of a measurable lesion at baseline is twice the slice thickness of  the 
baseline scans.  
● Clinical lesions: considered measurable at baseline if they are superficial and ≥ 10  mm in 
diameter. For cutaneous and subcutaneous lesions, digital photographs with a metric 
ruler in the image must be available. Photographs must be ob tained in such a manner to 
protect subject privacy.  
● Cytology, histology: may be used to determine if effusions are neoplastic in origin.  
Special consideration is to be given for bone lesion:  
● Bone scan, positron emission tomography (PET) scan or plain films  are not considered 
adequate imaging techniques to measure bone lesions. However, these techniques can be 
used to confirm the presence or disappearance of bone lesions.  
● Lytic bone lesions or mixed lytic -blastic lesions, with identifiable  soft tissue 
compon ents, that can be evaluated by cross sectional imaging techniques such as CT or 
MRI can be considered as measurable lesions if the soft tissue component  meets the 
definition of measurability above.  
● Blastic bone lesions are not measurable.  
Time Point Evalua tions  
Each lesion identified at baseline must be continually tracked at each time point evaluation. 
The longest diameter for that lesion will be measured at each time point evaluation (with the 
exception of lymph nodes for which the short axis will be used  in the sum of diameters). The 
sum of diameters will be recorded at each time point measurement. Lesions that become too 
small to measure must still have a numerical measurement provided. Lesions that disappear 
completely with no residual disease are to be  recorded as 0  mm. Lymph nodes identified as

10 Jan 2023  Astellas  Page 91 of 96 
Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 target lesions should always have the actual short axis measurement recorded (measured in the 
same anatomical plane as the baseline examination), even if the nodes regress to below 10  mm 
on study. If a lesion is  still present but cannot be measured, then a default of 5  mm is to be 
recorded. If a lesion is less than 5  mm but can be measured, then the actual measurement is to 
be recorded.  
Table  3 Evaluation of Target Lesions  
Response  Definit ions 
Complete Response (CR)  Disappearance of all target lesions. Pathologic lymph nodes must have 
reduction in short axis to < 10  mm. 
Partial Response (PR)  ≥ 30% decrease in sum of diameters from baseline sum of target lesions.  
Stable Disease (SD)  Neither PR nor PD.  
Progressive Disease (PD)  ≥ 20% increase in the sum of diameters from the smallest sum on study 
AND sum of diameters must be at least 5  mm increase from smallest sum 
on study.

Version 7.1 Incorporating Nons ubstantial Amendment 2 Best Overall Response  
Best overall response will be assessed at the end of study for a given subject and is the best 
response across all time points. PR and CR require confirmation with equivalent or improved 
assessment no less than 4 weeks after the date of scan that PR or CR was first observed. SD

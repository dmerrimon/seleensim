- 6 of 54 - 1. BACKGROUND AND STUDY OBJECTIVES  
 
Biliary duct carcinoma is a ra re but highly fatal malignancy.  Estimated incidence of bile duct and 
gallbladder cancer approached 10,000 cases in 2009, wi th nearly 3,400  estimated deaths 
according  to the American Cancer  Society.  
 
Cholangiocarcinoma is an epithelial cancer of the biliary duct system that may originate in the 
liver and extrahepatic bile ducts, which m ay terminate at the ampulla of Vater.  Based on 
anatom ical location, cholangiocarcinoma can be divided into 3 categories: (1) intrahepatic (20 -
25%), occurring in the bile ducts residing within the liver; (2) extrahepatic or perihilar  (also 
known as Klatski n tumour, 50%), occurring at the confluence of the right and left hepatic ducts; 
and (3) distal extrahepatic bile duct (20 -25%) , occurring beyond the liver .  More  than 90% of 
cholangiocarcinoma are adenocarcinomas, with different histological variants incl uding 
adenocarcinoma, papillary adenocarcinoma, intestinal -type adenocarcinoma, and mucinous 
adenocarcinoma.  
 
Conventional chemotherapy and radiation therapy have not been shown to be effective in 
prolonging long -term survival .  Although photodynamic thera py has been reported to be 
effective as a palliative treatment, it is not curative.  Radical surgery is the only potentially 
curative treatment modality .  However, in most cases, the tumors are well advanced at the time 
of diagnosis, which results in limit ed treatment options .  The impact of chemotherapy on survival 
remains controversial.  The overall survival for patients with cholangiocarcinoma  is ~6 months.  
 
Gemcitabine , with or without cisplatin , is the first line chemotherapy.  However, the outcomes of 
this therapy are limited.  After gemcitabine/cisplatin t herapy, there is essentially no  known 
effective chemo therapy.  The poor response of cholangiocarcinoma to  current therapy highlights 
the need  for a safe and effective therapy.  
 
CPI-613 is a novel anti -cancer agent ( Zachar et al. 2011).  CPI -613 s electively targets the altered 
form of mitochondrial energy metabolism in tumor cells, causing changes in mitochondrial 
enzyme activities and redox sta tus which lead s to apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy of tumor 
cells (Zachar et al. 2011) .  The activities of CPI -613 involve the catalytic and regulatory 
functions of the altered form of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex  (PDC)  and the α-
ketoglutarate dehy drogenase complex (KGDHC) found in tumor cells (Zachar et al. 2011).  CPI-
613 is also well -tolerated at doses up to 3,000 mg/m2, according to Phase 1 trial s in patients with 
solid tumors and hematologic malignancies.   Although it has not been investigated in patients 
with cholangiocarcinoma, CPI -613 has exhibited anti -cancer activities against a variety of 
advanced cancers including different types of solid tumors (Lee et al. 2011 & 2012; Senzer et al. 
2012) and hematologic malignancies (Pardee  et al, 2011 a and b, & 2012 ).  There fore, the anti -
cancer activities and safety of CPI -613 against advanced bile duct cancers  are investigated in this 
study . Interestingly , after the first two cycles of treatment,  the radiologic response by CAT scan 
or PET  scan did not correlate well with the clinical response for various tumor types , and 
patients ha d increased survival despite pseudo -progression  on their initial scan.  One of the 
reasons is that CPI-613 seems to be producing an inflammatory and necrotic local effect that can

Cancers

- 7 of 54 - be read as pseudo -progression on a standard CT. For this reason , we will allow patients to 
continue for an additional two cycles even if the first treatment scan shows  progres sion of 
disease by RECIST criteria. After 2 additional cycles, we expect to understand if the patient 
responded to therapy or not as the inflammatory/necrotic effect should have subsided.   Allowing 
2 additional treatment cycles with Disease P rogression acc ording to RECIST cannot take place if 
any of the following conditions occur:  
 
- the patient no longer meet s eligibility criteria set at the start of the protocol (see Section 3.)  
- worsening of biliary function when compared to baseline  
- the patient has s ymptomatic progression  
 
2. STUDY DESIGN  
 
2.1 Study Objective  
 
The objective of this study is t o evaluate the safety and efficacy of CPI -613 in patients 
with advanced unresectable bile duct cancers who have failed available therapies.   
 
2.2 Outcome Measures  
 
The p rimary outcome measure s are safety and anti -cancer activit ies (assessed based on 
Response Rate [RR]) . 
 
 The secondary outcome measure s are:

 Overall Survival (OS) . 
 
2.3 Open -Label Single -Arm Study Design  
 
This is an open -label study, and investigators and subjects are not blinded to the 
treatment. Also, the assignment of patients will not be randomized, since there is only a 
single arm in this study.

performed according the following time frames:  
 
Within 4 weeks:  tumor assessments based on contrast CT of chest, abdomen, and 
pelvis , and optional blood and serum samples . 
 
Within 2 weeks:  medical history, physical exam, vital signs, height, weight, 
ECG, ECOG, evaluation of symptoms and medic ations, clinical chemistry, 
hematology, coagulation, and troponin I.  
 
Within 1 week:  pregnancy test for women of child -bearing potential.  
 
5.1.2 Safety Assessment  
 
The safety of CPI -613 will be assessed from the first dose to 1 month after last 
dose of CP I-613.  The assessment will be based on:  
 
- evaluation of symptoms  
- vital signs  
- ECOG performance status and survival  
- clinical chemistry  
- renal function  
- hematology  
- coagulation  
- cardiac safety assessments via troponin I and ECG  
 
The specifics of the safety tests are described in Section 5.2.  All safety 
assessment tests are performed during screening (performed within 2 weeks prior 
to treatment with CPI -613 during Pre -Cycle 1), on Day 5 during Pre -Cycle 1, and 
prior to each treatm ent cycle with results available for review within 24 hrs before 
administration the anti -tumor agents.  Chemistries, hematology, and renal function 
will also be performed on Day s 1 and 4 of each treatment w eek during the first 2 
cycles .  ECOG performance st atus and survival will be assessed on Day 1 of each 
treatment week.  
 
 
5.1.3 Tumor Assessment  
 
Tumor response to treatment will assessed at baseline, and initially after the time 
frame encompassing the pre -cycle 1 treatment and the first three cycles  using

- 14 of 54 - contrast CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis  as well as serum levels of tumor 
marker CA -19-9 and performance status. Should the principal investigator 
determine that tumor progression has occurred the patient will be removed from 
the study. Should the principal investigator determine that the patient has stable 
disease or has had a favorable resp onse, those patients will continue treatment 
with CPI -613 for an additional three cycles (approximately three months). At that 
time, patients will then undergo re -imaging contrast CT, CA -19-9 and 
performance status.  
 
According to the Response Evaluation C riteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), the 
efficacy of treatment for solid  tumo rs is determined by the tumo r size. RECIST  
criteria are the golden standard to evaluate the tumor. In this study  RECIST 
criteria  will be used to evaluate response. H owever, the re is a pseudoprogression  
phenomenon described with the use of CPI -613 in Phase I solid tumor studies  
(Lee et al. 2012).  
 
It is felt that if CPI -613-induces necrosis of the tumor lesion there may be some 
radiographic evidence for increasing size. CPI -613 induces  tumor necrosis due to 
its mechanism of action – selectively targeting the altered form of mitochondrial 
energy metabolism in tumor cells, causing changes in mitochondrial enzyme 
activities and redox status, which leads to apoptosis, necrosis, and autophag y of 
tumor cells (2,3,7,17,18).  
 
For the purposes of this study, pseudoprogression will be defined and considered 
in patients who meet RECIST criteria of progression. It will be the treating 
physician’s discretion to continue treatment in this situation i f the patient is 
deemed to be getting clinical palliative benefit. In these patients, the study drug 
can be given for another two cycles  prior to  making definitive determination of 
progression or response .  
. 
Assessment of tumor response will be the respon sibility of the principal 
investigator and should be based on radiologic findings (i.e., contrast CT of the 
chest , abdomen, and pelvis,  and MRI  of the abdomen) , CA-19-9 and performance 
status.  
 
OS will be monitored bimonthly via telephone contact after treatment termination. 
(Note:  During the bimonthly post -study telephone contact, information related to 
cancer treatment received after the study will also be collected) . OS and PFS will 
be calculated from the first day of treatment. The duration of OS wi ll be measured 
until the date of death or censored at follow -up. The duration of response 
(evaluated by PFS) will be measured from the date a first objective response is 
documented until the first sign of progression assessed by MRI and CT.  
 
**NOTE:   Tumor  necrosis alone should not be criteria for determining

- 15 of 54 - progression.  
 
Safety and RR of CPI -613 are the primary endpoints, whereas PFS and OS are 
secondary endpoints.  
 
Pseudoprogression will be ruled out by allowing patients to receive the study drug 
for another 2 cycles after the first response assessment before making definitive 
assessment of progression or response.  However, patients will not be allowed to 
continue treatment with CPI -613 at  the time of “pseudo -progression” if any of the 
following criteria are met:  
 
a. The patient does not meet eligibility criteria set at the start of the protocol.  
b. Biliary function worsens.  
c. The patient has symptomatic progression . 
 
OS will be determined from the first dose of CPI -613 to death, assessed up to 3 
years after the first dose of CPI -613. Post-study s urvival , medical and cancer 
treatment information will be collected bimonthly via telephone contact after 
treatment termination.  
 
RR is defined as % of patients who experienced a Complete Response (CR) or 
Partial Response (PR) .  CR and PR are based on Response Evaluation Criteria in 
Solid Tumor (RECIST) Version 1.1 Eisenhauer et al. 2009). The best response 
recorded from the start of the t reatment until Disease Progression (DP) will be 
considered . 
 
PFS will be determined from the first dose of CPI -613 to DP or death due to any 
cause, assessed up to 3 years after the first dose of CPI -613. 
 
5.2 Specifics of Tests Performed During the Study  
 
Described below are the specifics of the tests performed in this study.  
 
5.2.1 ECOG Performance Status  
 
The ECOG Performance Status scales (Oken et al 1982) will be used to assess 
how a patient's disease is progressing and assess how the disease affects the daily 
living abilities of the patient.  These scales are listed in Table 5.2.1-1 (below).  
The higher the ECOG score, the worse the prognosis.

5.2.3 Analys es of Plasma CPI -613 Concentration s, Possibly Metabolite 
Concentrations, and Possibly Other Analyses  
 
Plasma samples for the determination of CPI -613 concentration s, possibly 
metabolite concentrations  and possibly other analyses  will be obtained before and 
at various times after dosing of CPI -613 on Day 1 of Pre -Cycle 1 & Day 1 of 
Cycle 1 at the following time points:  ~5 min before dosing, and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 
and 4 hrs post -dose of CPI -613. 
 
Blood (4 mL for each sample) should be obtained from a peripheral vein, and not 
from a central veno us catheter . The blood samples should be collected in 4 -mL 
lavender top collection tubes containing K2 -EDTA anticoagulant. The procedures 
for obtaining plasma samples are described in subsequent sections.  
 
The specific procedures for collecting the blood s amples are:  
Sample Collection:  
 
1. Collect 4 mL of blood into K2 -EDTA plasma tubes.  
2. Blood samples should be processed within 30 min utes of collection and 
kept on ice or in an ice block until processing.  
3. Turn the filled tube upside down and then retur n it to the upright position.  
Do this 8 -10 times.  Do not shake or vortex the tube.  You can also place 
the tubes on a mechanical shaker for 10 minutes to ensure full mixing.  
4. The samples are then immediately centrifuged (< 1300x g for 10 minutes). 
Ther e should be ~2 mL of plasma from each 4 mL blood sample.  
5. The plasma fraction should then be transferred in approximately equal 
fractions using a disposable pipette to two 1.8-mL Nunc cryovial 
(provided by Cornerstone) and immediately frozen. The total time from 
collection to freezing should not exceed 60 minutes.  The recommended 
temperature for sample storage is -80°C (or lower).  
 
Sample Tube Labeling  
 
Each sample vial should be marked with a unique identifier, to be provided by 
Cornerstone. The unique  identifier include the date and time of collection, 
dose, and subject number.  A separate document  (the “PK Sample Collection 
Log”) should then identify the number as it pertains to dosage, date, time of 
collection, etc.  
 
Sample Tube Shipment  
 
When all sa mples from each patient have been collected, they should be 
shipped to Cornerstone Pharmaceuticals, Inc., to the attention of Asela Boteju .

- 18 of 54 - Sample vials should be kept frozen during shipment through the use of dry 
ice.  Boxes should contain 30 -40% of the b ox volume in dry ice, or enough to 
keep the samples frozen for at least three days.  Dry ice pellets, as opposed to 
a single slab of dry ice, are preferred and should surround the sample.  
 
Samples should be shipped via priority overnight courier Monday, Tu esday or 
Wednesday to ensure arrival before the end of the business week.  Do not ship 
during a holiday week or when severe weather is expected that may delay the 
shipment either at the final destination or transfer points.  
 
Ensure that the total package w eight does not exceed 27.2 kg (60 pounds).

Spectroscopy (LC/MS/MS) method (Cornerstone Study # VLD -002).  
Individual and mean plasma concentrations of CPI -613 and possibly 
metabolites for each patient will be tabul ated at each time point and presented 
graphically. The following parameters will be estimated in all patients (as 
appropriate) from individual plasma concentration vs. time data:  
 
- the maximum observed concentration (C max) 
- area under the curve from time  zero until the last measurable concentration 
(AUC 0-t, calculated by the linear trapezoidal rule and extrapolated to 
infinity by acceptable methods)

5.2.4 Optional Sampling and “Banking” of Blood and Serum Samples  
 
Optional blood and serum  samples (10 mL and 8.5 mL, respectively) will be 
obtained and “banked” for possible testing of biomarkers, predictors of biological 
responses, toxicity, relationship between genotype and drug responses, etc. These 
samples will be obtained prior to treatmen t initiation (within 4 weeks prior to 1st 
dose), as well as prior to each restaging scan.  
 
Whole Blood Sample s 
 
 Samples (10 mL each) will be collected into a green top sodium heparin 
Vacutainer® tube.

6.1 Dose Levels, Dose Escalation, Sample Size and Justification of the Dose  
 
6.1.1 Dose Levels, Dose Escalation and Sample Size  
 
The dose levels to be used in assessing the safety and anti -cancer activities of 
CPI-613 in 10 patients with a dvanced bile duct cancers will be determined from a 
dose-escalation scheme using cohorts of patients with a dvanced bile duct cancers, 
as described below. The dose -escalation scheme is based on the number of 
patients exhibit ing dose-limiting toxicity (DLT), and DLT is defined as toxicity of 
Grade 3 or higher  attributed as probably or definitely related to CPI -613. The 
DLT determining period for all cohorts in the dose -escalation scheme is through  
the first cycle .

- 22 of 54 - Cohort 1:  The first 3 patients  will not be treated with the 5 daily doses of CPI -
613 during the pre-Cycle  1 week , and will only be treated with 3-weeks -on-1-
week -off treatment cycles (see Table 6 -1). T he dose of CPI-613 will be 2,300 
mg/m2 (which is approx imately  three -quarter s of the target dose). If no ne of 
these  3 patients develop a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT)  through Cycle 1 , the 
dose for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles will be 3,000 mg/m2 in all 
subsequent patient s in this trial .  However, if a DLT is observed in a patient 
(whether it is the 1st, 2nd or 3rd of the 3 intended patients), the number of patients 
in this cohort will be expanded to a maximum of 6 patients.  If no DLT is 
observed in another patient out of a maximum of 6 patients, the dose for the 3-
weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles will be 3,000 mg/m2 in all subsequent 
patients in this tri al. However, once DLT is observed in 2 patient s, no additional 
patients will be treated at 2,300 mg/m2 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment 
cycles from th at point  on, even though the total number of patients in this cohort 
is as few as 2. The dose level of 2,300 mg/m2, which induces a DLT in 2 or 
more patients , is considered to be above  the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)  for 
the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles . In this case, a ll subsequent patients 
in this  trial will be treated at 1,700 mg/m2 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off 
treatment cycles . 
 
Cohort 2:  In another 3 patients, the dose of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -
off treatment  cycle s will be as determined from Cohort 1. These patients will 
also be treated with the 5 daily doses of CPI -613 during the pre-Cycle  1 week .  
The dose of CPI-613 for the pre -Cycle 1 week will be 1,200 mg/m2/day, which 
has previously been established  to be the  weekly MTD (see Section 6.1.2).  If 
none of these 3 patients dev elop a DLT , the study can move onto Cohort 3 . 
 
However, if a DLT is observed in a patient (whether it is the 1st, 2nd or 3rd of the 
3 intended patients), the number of patients in this cohort will be expanded to a 
maximum of 6 patients. If no DLT is observed in another patient out of a 
maximum of 6 patients, the study will move onto Sub-Cohort 2 (see below) .  
However, i f a DLT is observed in 2 patient s, no additional patients will be 
treated at 1,200 mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 week  even though the total 
number of patients at this cohort is as few as 2. The dose level of 1,200 
mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 week , which induces a DLT in 2 or more 
patients , is considered to be above the MTD for the pre -Cycle 1 week . In this 
case, the dose of CPI -613 for the pre -Cycle 1 week in subsequent patients in this 
trial will be 600 mg/m2/day (or 3,000 mg/m2/week, equivalent to the MTD  
when given as a single dose) . 
 
Sub-Cohort 2:  Sub -Cohort 2 is activated only if 1 out of 6 patients exhibit s 
DLT in Cohort 2. There are 3 patients in this sub -cohort, the dose of CPI -613 
for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles will be as determined from 
Cohort 1. These patients will also be treated with the 5 daily doses of CPI -613

- 23 of 54 - during the pre -Cycle 1 week. The dose of CPI-613 for the pre -Cycle 1 week 
will be 1,700 mg/m2/day. If none of these 3 patients develop a DLT , the study 
can move onto Cohort 3 . However, if a DLT is observed in a patient (whether 
it is the first, second or third of the 3 intended patients), the number of patients 
in this cohort will be expanded to a maximum of 6 patients. If no DLT is 
observed in another patient out of a maximum of 6 patients, the study will 
move onto Cohort 3. However, i f a DLT is observed in 2 patients, no 
additional patients will be treated at 1,700 mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 
week  even though the total number of patients a t this sub-cohort is as few as 
2. The dose level of 1,700 mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 week , which 
induces a DLT in 2 or more patients, is considered to be above the MTD for 
the pre -Cycle 1 week.  In this case, the dose of CPI -613 for the pre -Cycle 1 
week in subsequent patients in this trial will be 6 00 mg/m2/day (or 3,000 
mg/m2/week, equivalent to the MTD when given as a single dose) . 
 
Cohort 3:  This cohort will be performed only if DLT is observed in Cohort 2, or 
DLT is observed in 1 or less patients in Sub -Cohort 2 .  There are 3 patients in 
this cohort, and the dose of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment 
cycle s will be as determined from Cohort 1.  The dose for the 5 daily IV 
infusions during the pre -Cycle 1 week will be 2,300 mg/m2/day.  If none of 
these 3 patients develop a DLT , the study can move onto Cohort 4 .  However, if 
a DLT is observed in a patient (whether it is the 1st, 2nd or 3rd of the 3 intended 
patient s), the number of patients in this cohort will be expanded to a maximum 
of 6 patients.  If no DLT is observed in another patient out of a maximum of 6 
patients, the study will move onto Cohort 4 .  However, i f a DLT is observed in 
2 patients, no additional patients will be treated at 2,3 00 mg/m2/day during the

as few as 2.  The dose level of 2,3 00 mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 week , 
which induces a DLT in 2 or more patients, i s considered to be above the MTD 
for the pre -Cycle 1 week.  In this case, the dose of CPI -613 for the pre -Cycle 1 
week in subsequent patients in this trial will be 1,700  mg/m2/day. 
 
Cohort 4:  This cohort will be performed only if DLT is observed in 1 or l ess 
patients in Cohort 3.  There are  3 patients in this cohort, and the dose of CPI -
613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles will be as determined from 
Cohort 1.  The dose for the 5 daily IV infusions during the pre -Cycle 1 week 
will be 3,000 mg/m2/day.  If none of these 3 patients develop a DLT , the study

patients, is considered to be above the MTD for the pre -Cycle 1 week.  In this 
case, the dose of CPI -613 for the pre -Cycle 1 week in subsequent patients in this 
trial will be 2,300 mg/m2/day 
 
Cohort 5:  This cohort is performed once the dose of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-
1-week -off treatment cycles has been determined from Co hort 1, and once the 
dose of CPI -613 for the pre -Cycle 1 week has been determined from Cohort 2 -
4.  There are 10 patients in this cohort.  These patients will be treated with CPI -
613 for 5 days during the pre -Cycle 1 week at doses as determined from 
Cohort s 2-4, and the dose of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment 
cycles will be as determ ined from Cohort 1.  
 
6.1.2  Justification of the Dose  
 
Based on Phase I trial s in patients with solid tumors and hematologic 
malignancies, 3 ,000 mg/m2 is the MTD , when CPI-613 is given as a single agent 
infused over 2 hours on Days 1 and 4 for 3 weeks of a 4 -week treatment cycle .  
CPI-613 did not induce any significant adverse effects at or below MTD . 
Additionally, CPI-613 at or below 3,000 mg exhibits anti -tumor activities in 
patients with various types of solid and hematologic malignancies (Pardee et al, 
2011a and b, & 2012; Lee et al. 2011 & 2012; Senzer et al 2012) . Because of the 
safety and efficacy  against other cancers , 3,000 mg/m2 is the target dose for thi s 
pilot study.  
 
In this study, patients will be treated with CPI -613 for 5 consecutive days during 
pre-Cycle 1, prior to being treated with CPI -613 given 2x weekly for 3 weeks. A 
sub-MTD (2,300 mg/m2, approx. three -quarter s of the MTD) will be used in the 
first 3 patients (in Cohort 1) who will be treated with the 4 -week treatment cycles 
and without treatment during the pre -Cycle 1 week to ensure safety, before 
initiating the dose escalation procedure to determine the  MTD. The maximum 
plasma concentration ( Cmax) of CPI -613 associated with the dose level of 2,300 
mg/m2 is ~90  μM, which is significantly lower tha n the C max of ~200 μM 
associated with 3,000 mg/m2. Therefore, 2,300 mg/m2 is expected to be a safe 
starting dose.  
 
After determining the dose to be used in 3 -weeks -on-1-week -off cycles, the safety 
of the dailyx5 treatment with CPI -613 during pre -Cycle 1 will be evaluated in a 
dose-escalated manner in Cohorts 2 -4.

- 25 of 54 - 6.2 Dosing Delay and Dose Modification of CPI -613 in the Event of Adverse 
 Events  
 
For adverse events unrelated to serum creatinine elevation or reduction in renal function 
but are possibly related to CPI -613, the occurrence of Grade 1 toxicity does not genera lly 
require dose modification for subsequent doses for that patient.  However, if Grade 2 
toxicity (other than alopecia and nausea) probably related to CPI -613 develops, treatment 
is to be withheld and can resume only after the Grade 2 toxicity has been re duced to 
Grade 1 or below, and the dose level for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced 
by 25% of the dose at which such Grade 2 toxicity occurs.  Grade 2 alopecia and nausea 
do not require withholding treatment or dose reduction.  If Grade 3 o r 4 toxicity probably 
related to CPI -613 develops, dosing of CPI -613 of that patient will be withheld and the 
patient shall be monitored for recovery from, and reversibility of, such Grade 3 or 4 
toxicity.  To resume treatment with CPI -613 for a patient wh o has had CPI -613-related 
Grade 3 or 4 toxicity, the Grade 3 or 4 toxicity must be reduced to Grade 1 or below, and 
the dose level for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced to 50% of the dose at 
which such Grade 3 or 4 toxicity occurs.  
 
For adv erse events related to creatinine elevation or reduction in renal function that are 
possibly related to CPI -613, dosing of the patient will be withheld even if the severity 
level is Grade 2 or above.  Treatment can resume only after the toxicity has been r educed 
to Grade 1.  The dose level for subsequent doses for that patient will be reduced by 15% 
if the severity level is of Grade 1, by 25% for Grade 2 toxicity, and by 50% for Grade 3 
or 4 toxicity.  
 
Furthermore, if the toxicity possibly related to CPI -613 is acute renal failure and the 
severity level is Grade 3 or 4, further patient enrollment will be temporarily suspended in 
order to enable assessment of the following aspects of the trial and implementation of 
corrective measures or protocol amendment,  and if necessary:  
 
- compliance of the study sites and investigators to the study protocol  
- evaluation of the appropriateness of the procedures for monitoring renal function  
 
6.3 Duration of Treatment for Each Patient at Each Cohort  
 
Twelve cycles of treat ment is recommended for patients who have a response, unless or 
until:  
 
- Patients exhibit  progression of disease  together with worsening of biliary 
function , no longer meeting eligibility  criteria , or exhibiting sy mptomatic 
progression; or patients exhibit progression of disease which was confirmed after 
1 additional treatment cycles  
- Unacceptable toxicity from CPI -613 
- Patient withdrawal of consent

ineligible for further investigational treatment  
- Non-compliance with investigational treatment, protocol -required evaluations or 
follow -up vi sits 
- Termination of the clinical trial by the sponsor  
 
When terminating treatment during this trial, the investigator should make every effort to 
contact the patient and to perform a final evaluation.  Also, the reason(s) for withdrawal 
from the study mu st be recorded.  
 
All patients will be followed until death.  
 
Additional treatment cycles beyond the recommended 12 cycles can be given if the 
investigator considers it beneficial to do so.  
 
7.0 STUDY DRUG  - CPI-613 
 
7.1 Description of CPI -613 Drug Product  
 
CPI-613 is provided in 10 -mL amber glass vials.  Each vial contains 10 mL of CPI -613 at 
a concentration 50 mg/mL , equivalent to 500 mg of CPI -613.  The drug product of CPI -
613 is a clear and colorless solution that is free of any particulate matter.   
 
7.2 Handling of CPI -613 
 
CPI-613 is an investigational drug and its toxicity in humans is not fully understood. All 
necessary precautions in handling potentially toxic chemicals must be strictly adhered to.  
Gloves and protective clothing must be worn when h andling CPI -613. Avoid contact by 
all modes of exposure. If the solution contacts the skin, it must be washed immediately 
and thoroughly with soap and water. If the solution comes in contact with mucous 
membranes, the membranes must be flushed thoroughly w ith water. Spills should be 
picked up with absorbent material and the area must be washed at least 3 times with ethyl 
alcohol followed by water.  
 
CPI-613 drug product is slightly photosensitive (Study# PHO -001).  Therefore, after 
removal of CPI -613 drug pr oduct from the amber vials, CPI -613 drug product should be 
protected from excessive light before administration to patients.

CCCWFU # 59212  
 
- 27 of 54 - 7.3 Storage of CPI -613 
 
CPI-613 should be stored under refrigeration, at 2˚ -8˚C (36˚ -46˚F), except when being 
prepared for administration.  
 
7.4 Intravenous ( IV) Infusion Sets, Syringes and IV Bags to be Used for 
 Administration of CPI -613 
 
CPI-613 must be administered IV by infusion, via an IV catheter with D5W running at a 
rate of about 125 -150 mL/hr.  To avoid local reaction s at and around the site of 
administration, CPI -613 should be administered via a central venous catheter.  
Subsequent sections describe the appropriate types of IV catheters, IV bags, syringes and 
clinical solutions that can be used in mixing and administe ring CPI -613 to patients.  
 
Leaching of Diethylhexyl Phthalate (DEHP) :  CPI -613 can cause leaching of DEHP from 
IV infusion sets and IV bags (Study COM -003). Therefore, DEHP -containing IV infusion 
sets, IV bags or syringes should not be used in mixing or administration of CPI -613.  
Examples of the IV sets, IV bags and syringes that do not contains DEHP and therefore 
can be used in the administration of CPI -613 are:  
 
Extension Set for Syringe Pump Use :  All extension sets from MED -RX do not contain 
DEHP.  
 
Syringes :  Kendall Monoject syringes, all  mono -ject syringes are DEHP free.  
 
IV Infusion Sets :  A compatibility study has been conducted showing that CPI -613 is 
compatible with 4 commonly used IV infusion sets (Study# COM -001).  Therefore, these 
4 types of IV infusion sets, and IV infusion sets that are made with the same materials, 
can be used to administer CPI -613.  These IV infusion sets are:  
 PVC material - ADDitIV Primary IV Set with Universal Spike, Backcheck Valve, 
2 Injection Sites, DEHP -Free and Lat ex-Free, 15 drops/mL, REF V14453, B Braun 
Medical Inc.  
 Latex material - Interlink System Secondary Medication Set, 10 drops/mL, 
2C7451, Baxter Healthcare Corporation  
 PVC material - SurshieldTM Safety Winged Infusion Set, 0.19 mL Volume, Latex -
Free, DEHP -Free, SV*S25BLS, Terumo Medical Products Hangzhou Co. Ltd.  
 Polyethylene material - Interlink System Paclitaxel Set by Baxter HealthCare, Non 
DEHP -free:  Polyethylene tubing with a 0.22 microfil ter Item # 2C7558 10 
drops/mL  
 
Syringes :  Compatibility studies (Studies# COM -001 and COM -002) have shown that 
CPI-613 drug product (50 mg/mL), and drug product diluted with D5W to various 
concentrations (1.6 -25 mg/mL) are compatible with various types of syringes, as listed 
below. Therefore, any of these types of syringes, and syringes that are made with the 
Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University

Cancers  
CCCWFU # 59212  
 
- 28 of 54 - same materials, can be used to administer CPI -613. Also, glass syringes can also be used, 
since glass (such as glass containers) is compatible with CP I-613 drug product.  
 Norm -Ject, polyethlyene barrel, polyethylene plunger, latex free (Henke Sass Wolf 
GMBH) syringes  
 Becton Dickinson syringes  
 Terumo syringes  
 Monoject syringes  
 Glass syringes  
 
7.5 Reconstitution and Administration of CPI -613 
 
CPI-613 must be diluted from 50 mg/mL to 12.5 mg/mL with 5% Dextrose Water or 
D5W (i.e., 1 portion of CPI -613 diluted with 3 portions of D5W) prior to administration.  
The diluted drug product should be visually inspected for clarity.  If haziness, precipitate 
or color ation (other than colorless) is observed, do not use the diluted drug product for 
dosing.  After dilution with sterile D5W, the solution is clear and has a pH of 8.4 -8.8.  
The diluted CPI -613 drug product has been found to be stable for 24 hrs at room 
temp erature and refrigeration temperature (Studies STA -010).  
 
CPI-613 must be administered IV, via an IV catheter that is free flowing and free of air in 
the dead space of the IV catheter, to minimize vascular irritation, inflammation and acute 
toxicity of CPI -613 (Study NCL -049). Accidental co -administration of extra air in the 
dead space of IV catheters during administration of CPI -613 has demonstrated the 
potential to induce acute toxicity of CPI -613 according to animal studies (Study NCL -
049).  Also, accide ntal leakage of CPI -613 into the perivascular space during IV 
administration, which prolongs exposure of perivascular tissue to CPI -613, can induce 
significant local inflammation according to animal studies (Studies NCL -027 and NCL -
030).  To avoid local re actions at and around the site of administration, CPI -613 must be 
administered via a central venous catheter.   
 
CPI-613 must not be administered as a bolus, but by infusion, at a rate of ~0.5 mL/min, 
via a central venous catheter with D5W running at a rat e of about 125 -150 mL/hr.  This is 
to minimize potential acute toxicity of CPI -613, according to animal studies (Study NCL -
049).  
 
The following precautions must be taken when administering CPI -613: 
 
A. Confirmation of the placement of the IV line to ensure  a lack of leakage of CPI -613 
into the perivascular space.  
B. Confirmation that the IV line is free flowing.  
C. Confirmation that the IV line is free of dead air space.  
D. Dilute CPI -613 drug product with D5W, as instructed in the study protocol.  
E. Admini ster CPI -613 by infusion, not as a bolus.  
F. After administration of CPI -613, flush the IV line with ~10 mL of D5W to remove

G. To avoid local reactions at and around the site of administration, CPI -613 should be 
administered via a centra l venous catheter.   
 
7.6 Request for CPI -613 
 
CPI-613 must be requested from Cornerstone by the Principal Investigator (or authorized 
designees).  CPI -613 may not be used outside the scope of this protocol, nor can it be 
transferred or licensed to any par ty not participating in this clinical study.  Cornerstone 
policy requires that CPI -613 be shipped directly to the institution where the patient is to 
be treated.  Cornerstone does not permit the transfer of CPI -613 between institutions 
(unless with prior w ritten approval from Cornerstone).  Requests must be submitted to

Records of inventory, dispensation and disposition (vials received, source and dates) 
must be maintained.  In addition, all doses dispensed should be accounted for by 
recording the date, study number and name, patient identification, patient initials, patient 
medical record number and balance forward.  These records must be maintained and kept 
at the study site, and will be reviewed by Cornerstone, or its designee, during periodic 
monitoring visits.  
 
7.8 Disposa l of CPI -613 
 
The following procedures are to be taken in disposal of CPI -613: 
 
- During the study, store the used CPI -613 vials (which must be separate from the 
unused CPI -613 vials) at room temperature in an access -limited area.  
Alternatively, destroy t he used CPI -613 vials according to institutional policy 
after documentation of the number of used CPI -613 vials and remaining volume 
in each used vial.  
- At the end of the study, deface the label (both used and unused vials) with a 
permanent marking pen.  
- For used CPI -613 vials (if not already destroyed according to institutional policy), 
after documentation of the number of used CPI -613 units and remaining volume 
in each container, the used containers should be destroyed at the site according to 
the insti tutional procedures for destroying toxic chemicals.  A certificate 
documenting the destruction of used vials must be kept on file.  
- All unused CPI -613 vials must be destroyed according to the policy of the 
institution.  The destruction of CPI -613, and the  quantity destroyed, must be 
documented.  A copy of the Certificate of Destruction should be sent to:

7.9 Calculation of the Amount of CPI -613 for Each Patient  
 
The amount of CPI -613 at each dose level is based on the BSA of the patient. The BSA 
values will be calculated b ased on the height and body weight taken during screening and 
this BSA value is used throughout the study. This is unless there is a >10% change in the 
body weight from baseline during the study. At that point, BSA should be revised based 
on the new body w eight and height. The new BSA values will be used from that point on

- 31 of 54 - for the remainder of the study, unless there is another >10% change in body weight which 
will require another revision of the BSA.  
 
7.10 Concomitant Medications and Prophylactic Treatment  
 
Patients cannot receive any standard or investigational treatment (except CPI -613) for 
their cancer, or any other investigational drugs for any indications, while on this study.  
All otherwise permitted concomitant medications (including trade and generi c names, 
dosage and dosing schedule) must be recorded.  
 
Prophylactic treatment for drug -related symptoms is not planned, or it will interfere with 
the assessment of the toxicity of the investigational product. However, following the 
evaluation of the causal relationship of the symptom(s) to the study drug and the 
information has been documented, the investigator may prescribe supportive treatment.  
Supportive treatment may include anti -emetic, anti -diarrhea, anti -pyretic, anti -allergic, 
anti-hypertensi ve medications, analgesics, antibiotics, allopurinol, and others such as 
blood products and bone marrow growth factors.  Patients may use erythropoietin for 
chronic anemia.  Also, the hemoglobin should be maintained ≥9 g/dL  or ≥90 g/L  during 
the course of the study.  The treating physician may utilize erythropoietic factors, or 
blood or platelet transfusions at their discretion.

8.3  WFUHS IRB AE Reporting Requirements  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others and adv erse 
events shall be promptly reported to the  IRB, according to institutional policy .  
Reporting to the IRB is required regardless of the funding source, study sponsor, 
or whether the event involves an investigational or marketed drug, biologic or 
device.  Reportable events are not limited to physical injury, but include 
psychological, economic and social harm.  Reportable events may arise as a result 
of drugs, biological agents, devices, procedures or other interventions, or as a 
result of questionnaires, surveys, observations or other interactions with research 
subjects.  
 
All members of the research team are responsible for the appropriate reporting to 
the IRB and other applicable parties of unanticipated problems involving risk to 
subjects or others.  The  Principal Investigator, however, is ultimately responsible 
for ensuring the prompt reporting of unanticipated problems involving risk to 
subjects or others to the IRB.  The Principal Investigator is also responsible for 
ensuring that all reported unantici pated risks to subjects and others which they 
receive are reviewed to determine whether the report represents a change in the 
risks and/or benefits to study participants, and whether any changes in the 
informed consent, protocol or other study -related docu ments are required.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at a 
site where the study has been approved by the WFUHS IRB (internal events) 
must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar days of the investigator or 
other members of the study team becoming aware of the event.  
 
Any unanticipated problems involving risks to subjects or others occurring at 
another site conducting the same study that has been approved by the WFUHS 
IRB (external events) must be reported to the WFUHS IRB within 7 calendar 
days of the investigator or other members of the study team becoming aware of 
the event.  
 
Any event, incident, experience, or outcome that alters the risk versus potential 
benefit of the research and as a result warrants a s ubstantive change in the 
research protocol or informed consent process/document in order to insure the

9.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
This is a pilot study with the primary goal to be able to determine init ial estimates of RR, and 
secondary goals to determine PFS  and OS . Data from this trial will also provide additional data 
concerning the safety profile of the CPI -613 therapy. Since there is some uncertainty about what 
dose to examine for the 10 patients in  this pilot  study we propose the following pre -defined dose 
escalation scheme in order to determine the appropriate dose to provide to 10 patients with 
advanced bile duct cancers. This scheme has been discussed/proposed by the FDA and it is very 
specific a nd is described below. The dose -escalation scheme is based on the number of patients 
exhibiting dose -limiting toxicity (DLT), and DLT is defined as toxicity of Grade 3 or higher.  
The DLT determining period for all cohorts in the dose -escalation scheme is through the first 
cycle. Note – this section is redundant with section 6.1 but is included for completeness.  
 
Cohort 1:  The first 3 patients will not be treated with the 5 daily doses of CPI -613 during the 
pre-Cycle 1 week, and will only be treated with 3 -weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles (see 
Table 6 -1). The dose of CPI-613 will be 2,300 mg/m2 (which is approximately three -quarters of 
the target dose). If none of these 3 patients develop a dose -limiting toxicity (DLT) through Cycle 
1, the dose for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles will be 3,000 mg/m2 in all 
subsequent patients in this trial . However, if a DLT is observed in a patient (whether it is the 1st, 
2nd or 3rd of the 3 intended patients), the number of patients in this cohort will be ex panded to a 
maximum of 6 patients. If no DLT is observed in another patient out of a maximum of 6 patients, 
the dose for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles will be 3,000 mg/m2 in all subsequent 
patients in this trial . However, once DLT is observed in 2 patients, no additional patients will be 
treated at 2,300 mg/m2 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles from that point on, even 
though the total number of patients in this cohort is as few as 2. The dose level of 2,300 mg/m2, 
which induces a D LT in 2 or more patients, is considered to be above the maximum tolerated 
dose (MTD) for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles . In this case, all subsequent patients 
in this trial will be treated at 1,700 mg/m2 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles . 
 
Cohort 2:  In another 3 patients, the dose of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment 
cycles will be as determined from Cohort 1. These patients will also be treated with the 5 daily 
doses of CPI -613 during the pre -Cycle 1 week.  The dose of CPI-613 for the pre -Cycle 1 week 
will be 1,200 mg/m2/day, which has previously been established to be the weekly MTD (see 
Section 6.1.2). If none of these 3 patients develop a DLT , the study can move onto Cohort 3 . 
 
However, if a DLT is observed in a pa tient (whether it is the 1st, 2nd or 3rd of the 3 intended 
patients), the number of patients in this cohort will be expanded to a maximum of 6 patients.  If 
no DLT is observed in another patient out of a maximum of 6 patients, the study will move onto 
Sub-Cohort 2 (see below) .  However, i f a DLT is observed in 2 patients, no additional patients 
will be treated at 1,200 mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 week  even though the total number of 
patients at this cohort is as few as 2.  The dose level of 1,200 mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 
week , which induces a DLT in 2 or more patients, is considered to be above the MTD for the

- 35 of 54 - pre-Cycle 1 week.  In this case, the dose of CPI -613 for the pre -Cycle 1 week in subsequent 
patients in this trial will be 6 00 mg/m2/day (or 3,000 mg/m2/week, equivalent to the MTD when 
given as a single dose) . 
 
Sub-Cohort 2:  Sub -Cohort 2 is activated only if 1 out of 6 patients exhibits DLT in Cohort 2.  
There are 3 patients in this sub -cohort, the dose of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week-off 
treatment cycles will be as determined from Cohort 1.  These patients will also be treated with 
the 5 daily doses of CPI -613 during the pre -Cycle 1 week.  The dose of CPI-613 for the pre -
Cycle 1 week will be 1,700 mg/m2/day.  If none of these 3 patie nts develop a DLT , the study can 
move onto Cohort 3 .  However, if a DLT is observed in a patient (whether it is the first, second 
or third of the 3 intended patients), the number of patients in this cohort will be expanded to a 
maximum of 6 patients.  If n o DLT is observed in another patient out of a maximum of 6 
patients, the study will move onto Cohort 3 .  However, i f a DLT is observed in 2 patients, no 
additional patients will be treated at 1,700 mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 week  even though 
the tota l number of patients at this sub -cohort is as few as 2.  The dose level of 1,700 mg/m2/day 
during the pre -Cycle 1 week , which induces a DLT in 2 or more patients, is considered to be 
above the MTD for the pre -Cycle 1 week.  In this case, the dose of CPI -613 for the pre -Cycle 1 
week in subsequent patients in this trial will be 6 00 mg/m2/day (or 3,000 mg/m2/week, 
equivalent to the MTD when given as a single dose) . 
 
Cohort 3:  This cohort will be performed only if DLT is observed in Cohort 2, or DLT is 
observed in 1 or less patients in Sub -Cohort 2.  There are 3 patients in this cohort, and the dose 
of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment cycles will be as determined from Cohort 1.  
The dose for the 5 daily IV infusions during the pre -Cycle 1 week will be 2,300 mg/m2/day.  If 
none of these 3 patients develop a DLT , the study can move onto Cohort 4 .  However, if a DLT 
is observed in a patient (whether it is t he 1st, 2nd or 3rd of the 3 intended patients), the number of 
patients in this cohort will be expanded to a maximum of 6 patients.  If no DLT is observed in 
another patient out of a maximum of 6 patients, the study will move onto Cohort 4 .  However, i f 
a DLT is observed in 2 patients, no additional patients will be treated at 2,3 00 mg/m2/day during 
the pre -Cycle 1 week  even though the total number of patients at this sub -cohort is as few as 2.  
The dose level of 2,3 00 mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 week , which induces a DLT in 2 or 
more patients, is considered to be above the MTD for the pre -Cycle 1 week.  In this case, the 
dose of CPI -613 for the pre -Cycle 1 week in subsequent patients in this trial will be 1,700  
mg/m2/day. 
 
Cohort 4:  This cohort will be performed only if DLT is observed in 1 or less patients in Cohort 
3.  There are 3 patients in this cohort, and the dose of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off 
treatment cycles will be as determined from Cohort 1.  The dose for the 5 daily IV infusions 
during the pre -Cycle 1 week will be 3,000 mg/m2/day.  If none of these 3 patients develop a 
DLT , the study can move onto Cohort 5 .  However, if a DLT is observed in a patient (whether it 
is the first, second or third of the 3 i ntended patients), the number of patients in this cohort will 
be expanded to a maximum of 6 patients.  If no DLT is observed in another patient out of a 
maximum of 6 patients, the study will move onto Cohort 5 .  However, i f a DLT is observed in 2 
patients,  no additional patients will be treated at 3,0 00 mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 week

- 36 of 54 - even though the total number of patients at this cohort is as few as 2.  The dose level of 3,0 00 
mg/m2/day during the pre -Cycle 1 week , which induces a DLT in 2 or more patients, is 
considered to be above the MTD for the pre -Cycle 1 week.  In this case, the dose of CPI -613 for 
the pre -Cycle 1 week in subsequent patients in this trial will be 2,300  mg/m2/day 
 
Cohort 5:  This cohort is performed once the dose of CPI -613 for  the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off 
treatment cycles has been determined from Cohort 1, and once the dose of CPI -613 for the pre -
Cycle 1 week has been determined from Cohort 2 -4.  There are 10 patients in this cohort.  These 
patients will be treated with CPI -613 fo r 5 days during the pre -Cycle 1 week at doses as 
determined from Cohorts 2 -4, and the dose of CPI -613 for the 3-weeks -on-1-week -off treatment 
cycles will be as determined from Cohort 1.  
As can be seen by the above scheme there are several possible scenario s that could occur in order 
to determine the dose for the 10 patients to be evaluated in the pilot trial. Once the above 
procedure is completed we will then enroll 10 patients at the determined dose.  
Accrual Rate  
We anticipate accruing one patient per mont h for this protocol. Since the dose escalation 
procedure described above may involve a variable number of patients (at least 6 but possibly 
more) we cannot be certain the entire length of accrual for this protocol.  However, we do 
anticipate that the total  number of patients in this protocol will be between 16 -40 (with 16 -22 
being the most likely range). Thus, we anticipate that we will reach the target sample size of 10 
patients treated at MTD  within two years. A minimum of 16 patients to a maximum of 40 
patients will be accrued to the study, with the first 6-30 being evaluated for toxicity  in a dose -
escalated manner  for determining the MTD , and the remaining 10 used in the analytic sample.  
 
Proposed Analyses  
The analyses for this protocol will be primari ly descriptive. With a sample size of 10 treated at 
MTD, we do not expect to see statistically significant effects for the outcomes of interest, 
however this data will provide useful preliminary data on the overall safety and efficacy of CPI -
613 and provid e useful data to predict the variability and likely effect sizes for these outcomes.   
 
For the time -to-event outcomes we will estimate survival curves for OS and PFS using Kaplan -
Meier techniques. In addition, we will estimate the 6 month and 1 -year OS an d PFS rates for 
these participants. For response rate we will present the proportion of patients who are CR, PR, 
SD or PD. In addition, we will estimate the proportion of responders as the percent of patients 
who are CR or PR. For this rate we will also in clude a 95% confidence interval.  
 
We will also examine toxicities for these 10 patients by looking at each toxicity identified earlier 
in the protocol by grade.   
 
Sample Size Considerations  
Since this is a pilot study we do not anticipate having statistic al power to detect specific effects , 
however with this sample size we will be able to estimate the response rate using a 2 -sided 95% 
confidence interval with an interval that will extend no more than 0.31 from the observed

- 47 of 54 - APPENDIX B  STRC SAE R EPORTING GUIDELINES  
 
Mandatory Safety and Toxicity Review Committee (STRC; Previously CROC)  
Serious Adverse Event (SAE) Notification Procedure  
 
Mandatory STRC SAE Reporting Requirements – Revised 6/05/2012  
This document describes STRC reporting and use of the electronic submission form 
that is submitted for unexpected grade 4 and any grade 5 (death during protocol 
intervention) SAEs on CCCWFU Institutional interventional trial patients . There 
are multiple en tities that require reporting of SAEs. Each entity has different rules for 
what is reported, and how it is reported.  
Rules used by other entities (Institutional Review Board (IRB), AdEERS, MedWatch, 
etc.) should NOT be u sed to evaluate whether an event sh ould be reported to STRC. 
Only the rules for reporting described in this document should be considered.  
As defined in the NCI summary IV reporting guidelines, CCCWFU Institutional studies 
covered by these reporting requirements are defined as: In-house, in ternally 
reviewed trials, including those collaborative studies conducted with industry 
sponsorship in which the center is a primary contributor to the design, 
implementation, and monitoring of the trial, or participation in a multi -site trial 
initiated by  an institutional investigator at another center.   Institutional trials are 
almost  always authored by a researcher here at CCCWFU. Institutional protocols are 
labeled NCI Code=”I” for Institutional on the protocol screen in ORIS. Cooperative group 
protocol s are not considered Institutional, but Research Base trials are classified as 
Institutional.  
The STRC  is responsible for reviewing SAEs for CCCWFU Institutional studies, as 
defined above. STRC currently requires that unexpected grade 4 and all grade 5 SAE s 
on these trials be reported to them for review. All Clinical Research Management (CRM) 
staff members assisting a PI in documenting and reporting an SAE that qualifies for 
STRC reporting are responsible for informing a clinical member of the STRC by phone , 
followed by informing the entire committee via the required email notification.  
THESE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS APPLY TO EVERYONE WORKING WITH 
CANCER CENTER INSTITUTIONAL PROTOCOLS.  
What is considered an SAE under this mandatory procedure?  
Any unexpected gr ade 4  event not including routinely experienced events per protocol 
(e.g. myelosuppression) and all grade 5 events  (death during protocol intervention) 
should be reported. The patient is considered “on -treatment” as defined in the protocol, 
which can exten d days/weeks/months past the last date of actual protocol intervention.

1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 Interventional Trials  
 
 
STRC reporting may not be appropriate for specific expected adverse events for protocols. 
In those situations the adverse events that will not require STRC reporting must be 
specified in the text  of the approved protocol.  
STRC notification responsibilities of the person handling the reporting/documenting 
of the SAE:  
1. Make a phone call to the appropriate clinical member of the STRC as listed below 
(page if necessary) —see note 2 below  
2. Submit the STRC  Notification Form WITHIN 24 HOURS of first knowledge of the 
event. This form is found at either the ORIS main menu page or by going to 
http://ccc.wfubmc.edu/oris/strc.aspx . 
This will ensure that all per sons that the event applies to will be notified; remember 
to file a copy of your confirmation. (Form instructions will walk you through the 
required fields, consult the help page for further instructions.)  
3. Ensure that you document that the appropriate pers ons on the STRC has been 
contacted.   ADVERSE EVENT

- 49 of 54 - 4. Follow up with/update the clinical member of STRC regarding any new 
developments or information obtained during the course of the SAE investigation 
and reporting process.  
Elements needed to complete the electronic STRC f orm:  
1. ORIS Patient ID (PID)  
2. Name of STRC Clinician notified/Date/Time/Comments.  
3. Grade of event.  
4. Is this related to protocol intervention or treatment?  
5. Is suspension of the protocol needed?  
6. Is any change to consent or protocol needed?  
7. Was the nature or sever ity of the event unexpected?  
8. Date of the event.  
9. Brief description of the event using approved CTC version terminology.  
10.  Date of last study dose before event.  
11. Relevant tests/labs.  
12. Most importantly make sure that the Investigator assigns attribution to the 
reported event (grade) using the appropriate CTCAE version for the protocol.  
 
The Clinical Members of STRC to Notify by Phone or Page:  
 
Bayard Powell, MD  – Director -at-Large, CCCWFU; Chair, PRC; Section Head, 
Hematology/Oncology  
Glenn Lesser, MD – Hematolo gy Oncology  
Kathryn Greven, MD  – Vice Chair – Radiation Oncology  
Marissa Howard -McNatt, MD  – General Surgery  
Definition of Unavailable:  As a general guideline if the first clinician that is contacted 
does not respond to the phone call or page within a re asonable amount of time, then 
initiate contact with their backup.  Give the back -up a reasonable amount of time to 
respond to a phone call or page before contacting another member. This is a general 
guideline.  You must use your best judgment as a clinical  research professional given 
the time of day, severity of the SAE, and other circumstances as to when it is 
appropriate to contact backup clinicians.  If the event occurs near the end of day, then 
leave messages (voice or email) as appropriate and proceed with submitting your STRC 
notification form.  The important criteria is that have taken reasonable steps to notify 
and document that you have initiated some type of contact to one or more of the clinical 
members of STRC.

- 50 of 54 - STRC CLINICAN RESPONSIBILITY:  
It is the responsibility of the STRC clinician to review all reported events, evaluate the 
events as they are reported; and communicate a response to the Investigator, event 
reporter and the members of STRC. The review will include but not be limited to the 
information reported; there may be times when additional information is needed in order 
for an assessment to be made further communication directly with the investigator may 
be warranted. STRC reserves the right to agree with the investigator’s assessment i f 
STRC does not agree with the investigator STRC reserves the right to suspend the trial 
pending further investigation.  
 
AMENDMENTS TO PREVIOUS REPORTS  
If you are not able to supply all pertinent information with the initial submission, once the 
additional information is available do not submit a new report . Go to the original email 
that was received by STRC and others “reply to all” and entitle your emai l “Amendment 
for (list date of event and patient ID) this will avoid duplications of the same event. List 
the additional information which you are reporting.

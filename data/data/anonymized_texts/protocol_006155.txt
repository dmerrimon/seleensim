2.1.
 
Brief
 
Summary
 
 
This
 
optimization
 
randomized
 
clinical
 
trial
 
(i.e.,
 
“optimization-RCT”)
 
will
 
examine
 
three
 
self-monitoring
 
strategies
 
for
 
weight
 
loss
 
--
 
tracking
 
dietary
 
intake,
 
tracking
 
steps,
 
and
 
tracking
 
body
 
weight
 
--
 
all
 
delivered
 
through
 
digital
 
health
 
tools.
 
The
 
purpose
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
is
 
to
 
evaluate
 
the
 
combination
 
of
 
these
 
strategies
 
that
 
maximizes
 
6-month
 
weight
 
loss
 
in
 
the
 
context
 
of
 
a
 
fully
 
digital
 
health
 
intervention
 
for
 
adults
 
with
 
overweight
 
or
 
obesity.
 
 
The
 
investigators
 
will
 
recruit
 
176
 
total
 
participants
 
to
 
the
 
trial.
 
Recruitment
 
will
 
occur
 
through
 
remote
 
channels.
 
Interested
 
individuals
 
will
 
be
 
directed
 
to
 
an
 
online
 
eligibility
 
screen;
 
those
 
who
 
are
 
eligible
 
will
 
then
 
be
 
invited
 
to
 
attend
 
an
 
initial
 
remote
 
baseline
 
session
 
with
 
study
 
staff
 
to
 
ensure
 
interest
 
and
 
eligibility
 
in
 
the
 
study.
 
The
 
weight
 
loss
 
intervention
 
will
 
last
 
6
 
months,
 
and
 
all
 
participants
 
will
 
receive
 
a
 
"core"
 
intervention
 
consisting
 
of
 
goal
 
setting,
 
behavioral
 
lessons,
 
and
 
action
 
plans
 
-
 
all
 
of
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
delivered
 
remotely.
 
Using
 
a
 
2x2x2
 
factorial
 
design,
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
randomized
 
to
 
receive
 
0-3
 
of
 
the
 
self-monitoring
 
strategies.
 
All
 
study
 
tasks
 
will
 
occur
 
remotely,
 
thus,
 
participants
 
never
 
need
 
to
 
come
 
in-person
 
for
 
any
 
intervention
 
or
 
assessment
 
tasks.
 
 
Investigators
 
will
 
use
 
the
 
Multiphase
 
Optimization
 
Strategy
 
(MOST)
 
framework
 
to
 
identify
 
the
 
most
 
effective
 
combination
 
of
 
self-monitoring
 
strategies.
 
The
 
factorial
 
design
 
will
 
allow
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
to
 
determine
 
the
 
unique
 
and
 
combined
 
impact
 
of
 
each
 
self-monitoring
 
component
 
on
 
outcomes.
 
The
 
primary
 
outcome
 
is
 
weight
 
change
 
from
 
baseline
 
to
 
6
 
months.
 
To
 
complement
 
the
 
main
 
trial,
 
the
 
research
 
team
 
will
 
also
 
randomize
 
half
 
of
 
participants
 
to

Background
 
and
 
Significance
 
2.4.1
 
Obesity
 
Obesity
 
is
 
a
 
significant
 
public
 
health
 
problem.
 
Obesity
 
has
 
become
 
a
 
pervasive
 
health
 
concern
 
in
 
the
 
United
 
States,
 
with
 
rates
 
of
 
42%
 
among
 
adults
1
 
and
 
another
 
30+%
 
with
 
overweight.
2
 
Excess
 
weight
 
heightens
 
risk
 
for
 
chronic
 
diseases,
3
 
including
 
type
 
2
 
diabetes,
 
and
 
can
 
magnify
 
psychological
 
distress
 
as
 
a
 
result
 
of
 
weight
 
stigma.
4
 
Behavioral
 
weight
 
loss
 
interventions
 
that
 
involve
 
frequent
 
in-person
 
meetings,
 
diet
 
and
 
exercise
 
goals,
 
and
 
behavioral
 
strategies
 
are
 
the
 
gold
 
standard
 
for
 
treating
 
overweight
 
and
 
obesity.
5
 
These
 
traditional
 
treatments
 
are
 
effective
 
in
 
producing
 
weig ht
 
loss
 
up
 
to
 
10%,
6
 
but
 
often
 
lack
 
scalability.
 
 
2.4.2
 
Digital
 
Interventions
 
Remotely-delivered
 
interventions
 
show
 
promise,
 
but
 
need
 
enhanced
 
efficacy.
 
Digital
 
health
 
interventions
 
that
 
deliver
 
treatment
 
remotely
 
seek
 
to
 
minimize
 
burden,
 
decrease
 
costs,
 
and
 
broaden
 
reach,
 
compared
 
to
 
in-person
 
interventions.
 
With
 
widespread
 
penetration
 
of
 
home
 
broadband,
 
regular
 
phones,
 
and
 
smartphones
 
among
 
U.S.
 
adults
 
(77%,
7
 
97%,
 
and
 
85%,
8
 
respectively),
 
digital
 
health
 
tools
 
are
 
increasingly
 
being
 
used
 
in
 
weight
 
loss
 
interventions,
 
with
 
promising
 
efficacy.
9-13
 
Compared
 
to
 
traditional
 
interventions
 
with
 
counseling,
 
fully
 
standalone
 
digital
 
interventions
 
offer
 
greater
 
scalability
 
given
 
lower
 
personnel
 
costs.
 
However,
 
weight
 
loss
 
tends
 
to
 
be
 
modest
14-15
;
 
thus,
 
more
 
work
 
is
 
needed
 
to
 
enhance
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
standalone
 
digital
 
approaches.
 
2.4.3
 
Self-Monitoring
 
Self-monitoring
 
via
 
digital
 
health
 
is
 
effective
 
at
 
facilitating
 
weight
 
loss.
 
Self-monitoring
 
is
 
a
 
well-established
 
method
 
of
 
facilitating
 
weight
 
loss
 
for
 
adults
 
with
 
overweight
 
or
 
obesity.
16-18
 
It
 
involves
 
tracking
 
a
 
behavior
 
(e.g.,
 
diet,
 
exercise)
 
or
 
behavio ral
 
outcome
 
(e.g.,
 
body
 
weight)
 
and
 
allows
 
individuals
 
to
 
pay
 
attention
 
to
 
their
 
behaviors
 
and
 
gain
 
feedback
 
on
 
how
 
specific
 
actions
 
impact
 
their
 
weight.

Theoretical
 
Framework
 
Self-regulation
 
theories,
 
including
 
Social
 
Cognitive
 
Theory
 
and
 
Control
 
Theory,
 
posit
 
that
 
behavior
 
change
 
occurs
 
through
 
comparison
 
of
 
one’s
 
behavior
 
to
 
one’s
 
goals
 
or
 
past
 
performance.
19-20
 
Self-monitoring
 
is
 
one
 
of
 
the
 
strongest
 
predictors
 
of
 
behavior
 
change
21
 
and
 
weight
 
loss
22
 
and
 
is
 
thought
 
to
 
work
 
by
 
increasing
 
self-regulatory
 
skills
 
and
 
self-efficacy
 
for
 
making
 
healthy
 
changes.
 
 
However,
 
self-monitoring
 
engagement
 
tends
 
to
 
decline
 
over
 
time
 
with
 
common
 
barriers
 
related
 
to
 
time
 
demands,
 
perceived
 
burden,
 
accessibility
 
challenges,
 
waning
 
novelty,
 
and
 
literacy/numeracy
 
constraints.
23,24
 
Fortunately,
 
there
 
are
 
ways
 
to
 
promote
 
self-monitoring
 
engagement
 
by
 
using
 
digital
 
rather
 
than
 
paper
 
based
 
methods
 
of
 
self-monitoring,
16
 
and
 
by
 
incorporati ng
 
theory-informed
 
and
 
empirically-supported
 
self-regulation
 
strategies
 
such
 
as
 
goal
 
setting,
 
tailored
 
feedback,
 
and
 
action
 
planning.
 
Meta-analyses
 
have
 
found
 
that
 
the
 
effects
 
of
 
self-monitoring
 
are
 
magnified
 
when
 
adding
 
these
 
strategies.
25-27
 
Advantages
 
of
 
using
 
digital
 
platforms
 
for
 
self-monitoring
 
include
 
immediate
 
personalized
 
feedback,
 
reduced
 
tracking
 
time
 
with
 
automated
 
monitoring
 
via
 
devices
 
like
 
fitness
 
trackers
 
and
 
e-scales,
 
and
 
high
 
portability
 
of
 
mHealth
 
tools,
 
which
 
increases
 
the
 
likelihood
 
of
 
use
 
while
 
reducing
 
retrospective
 
errors.
 
A
 
systematic
 
review
 
of
 
39
 
randomized
 
trials
 
examined
 
digital
 
self-monitoring
 
strategies
 
used
 
in
 
weight
 
loss
 
interventions
 
and
 
concluded
 
that
 
greater
 
self-monitoring
 
was
 
positively
 
associated
 
with
 
weight
 
loss
 
in
 
over
 
70%
 
of
 
the
 
reported
 
associations.
16
 
This
 
pattern
 
was
 
demonstrated
 
across
 
a
 
range
 
of
 
digital
 
health
 
modalities
 
and
 
self-monitored
 
behaviors.
 
In
 
sum,
 
self-monitoring
 
is
 
a
 
theory-informed
 
and
 
evidence-based
 
approach
 
for
 
weight
 
loss
 
that
 
can
 
be
 
delivered
 
via
 
digital
 
tools.

The
 
Multiphase
 
Optimization
 
Strategy
 
(MOST)
 
It
 
is
 
important
 
to
 
have
 
interventions
 
that
 
are
 
both
 
efficient
 
and
 
potent,
 
with
 
no
 
extraneous
 
components.
 
Factorial
 
designs
 
can
 
identify
 
active
 
ingredients
 
of
 
an

that
 
contribute
 
added

as
 
well
 
as
 
inactive
 
components
 
that
 
are
 
unnecessarily
 
burdensome
 
and
 
potentially
 
even
 
detrimental.
 
As
 
such,
 
a
 
factorial
 
design
 
can
 
be
 
used
 
to
 
address
 
which
 
combination
 
of
 
self-monitoring
 
strategies
 
maximizes
 
weight
 
loss,
 
and
 
whether
 
any
 
synergistic
 
or
 
antagonistic
 
effects
 
exist,
 
which
 
occur
 
when
 
the
 
combined
 
effect
 
of
 
two
 
or
 
more
 
intervention
 
components
 
is
 
more
 
or
 
less
 
favorable,
 
respectively,
 
than
 
would
 
be

based
 
solely
 
on
 
main

an
 
engineering-inspired

provides
 
an
 
opportunity
 
for
 
researchers
 
to

effective
 
and
 
efficient
 
multicomponent
 
behavioral
 
interventions.

three
 
phases:

Optimization,
 
and
 
Evaluation.
 
First,
 
the

selecting

components
 
to
 
test,
 
and
 
developing
 
a
 
conceptual
 
model.
 
Second,
 
the
 
Optimization
 
Phase
 
consists
 
of
 
conducting
 
a
 
fully
 
powered
 
optimization-RCT
 
to
 
rigorously
 
test
 
the
 
intervention
 
components’
 
unique
 
and
 
combined
 
effects
 
on
 
the
 
outcome
 
of
 
interest.
 
Third,
 
a
 
subsequent
 
Evaluation
 
Phase
 
involves
 
testing
 
the
 
newly
 
optimized
 
intervention
 
versus
 
a

in
 
a
 
traditional
 
two-arm

No

of
 
self-monitoring
 
strategies.
 
While
 
the
 
value
 
of
 
self-monitoring
 
has
 
been
 
demonstrated
 
repeatedly,
 
what
 
remains
 
unknown
 
is
 
which
 
self-monitoring
 
domains
 
actually
 
contribute
 
the
 
greatest
 
amount
 
to
 
weight
 
loss,
 
and
 
whether
 
any
 
combinations
 
diminish
 
weight

and
 
create
 
undue
 
burden.
 
Examining
 
the
 
unique

impact
 
of
 
three
 
popular
 
self-monitoring
 
strategies
 
(diet,

and
 
body
 
weight)
 
will
 
allow
 
an

All
 
study
 
procedures
 
will
 
occur
 
through
 
remote
 
means.
 
Recruitment
 
materials
 
will
 
direct
 
interested
 
individuals
 
to
 
an
 
online
 
screening
 
questionnaire
 
(via
 
REDCap)
 
that
 
describes
 
the
 
study
 
and
 
assesses
 
initial
 
eligibility.
 
As
 
part
 
of
 
an
 
embedded
 
experiment
 
called
 
a
 
Study-Within-A-Trial
 
(“SWAT”),
32
 
eligible
 
candidates
 
are
 
then
 
randomize d
 
1:1
 
to
 
either
 
receive
 
a
 
self-directed
 
orientation
 
session
 
or
 
not
 
receive
 
it.
 
Those
 
assigned
 
to
 
receive
 
it
 
will
 
be
 
prompted
 
to
 
complete
 
a
 
20-25
 
minute
 
web-based
 
orientation
 
session
 
consisting
 
of
 
video
 
content
 
and
 
interactive
 
activities
 
designed
 
to
 
set
 
expectations,
 
explain
 
the
 
study
 
rationale
 
and
 
details,
 
visualize
 
the
 
time
 
commitment,
 
and
 
ensure
 
the
 
trial
 
is
 
a
 
good
 
fit
 
for
 
their
 
interests.
 
At
 
the
 
end
 
of
 
the
 
orientation
 
session,
 
those
 
individuals
 
will
 
have
 
the
 
option
 
to
 
sign
 
up
 
for
 
a
 
baseline
 
visit
 
(see
 
preregistration
 
repository:
 
protocol
 
SWAT
 
211)
33
.
 
The
 
orientation
 
session
 
is
 
modeled
 
after
 
the
 
Methods-Motivational
 
Interviewing
 
approach,
34
 
which
 
was
 
developed
 
to
 
increase
 
clinical
 
trial
 
retention.
 
3.4.2
 
Baseline
 
Visit
 
and
 
Randomization
 
 
Individuals
 
not
 
randomized
 
to
 
receive
 
the
 
orientation
 
session
 
will
 
receive
 
an
 
email
 
invitation
 
to
 
sign
 
up
 
for
 
a
 
baseline
 
visit.
 
All
 
participants
 
will
 
attend
 
a
 
baseline
 
visit,
 
regardless
 
of
 
orientation
 
session
 
assignment.
 
At
 
this
 
baseline
 
visit
 
(~1-1.5
 
hours),
 
trained
 
study
 
staff
 
will
 
confirm
 
eligibility
 
and
 
describe
 
study
 
procedures.
 
If
 
individuals
 
are
 
interested
 
in
 
participating,
 
study
 
staff
 
will
 
obtain
 
informed
 
consent
 
to
 
assure
 
that
 
they
 
fully
 
understand
 
the
 
demands
 
and
 
purpose
 
of
 
the
 
study
 
before
 
enrolling.
 
Next,
 
study
 
staff
 
will
 
help
 
participants
 
create
 
a
 
Fitbit
 
account
 
and
 
download
 
the
 
Fitbit
 
app.
 
Study
 
staff
 
will
 
then
 
administer
 
a
 
web-based
 
dietary
 
recall,
 
an
 
oral
 
health
 
literacy
 
assessment,
 
and
 
a
 
web-based
 
baseline
 
survey.
 
Once
 
the
 
survey
 
is
 
completed,
 
study
 
staff
 
will
 
mail
 
all
 
participants
 
an
 
e-scale
 
to
 
obtain
 
baseline
 
weight
 
measurement.
 
Once
 
the
 
e-scale
 
is
 
delivered,
 
participants
 
will
 
receive
 
an
 
email
 
that
 
provides
 
information
 
on
 
syncing
 
their
 
e-scale
 
with
 
the
 
Fitbit
 
app,
 
and
 
will
 
be
 
prompted
 
to
 
weigh
 
themselves
 
the
 
following
 
morning
 
using
 
a
 
standardized
 
protocol.
 
Within
 
the
 
week
 
after
 
the
 
baseline
 
visit,
 
a
 
2nd
 
unannounced
 
web-based
 
dietary
 
recall
 
will
 
be
 
administered,
 
with
 
reminders
 
sent
 
if
 
it
 
is
 
not
 
completed.
 
Once
 
the
 
weight
 
assessment
 
is
 
completed,
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
randomized
 
to
 
1
 
of
 
8
 
experimental
 
conditions
 
via
 
an

we
 
will
 
randomize
 
participants

will
 
use
 
REDCap
 
to
 
implement
 
the

weight
 
collected
 
via
 
the

(after
 
consenting)
 
puts
 
them
 
out

Withdrawal/Termination
 
Criteria
 
If
 
after

period
 
the
 
participant
 
no
 
longer
 
meets
 
certain

criteria,
 
they
 
will
 
be
 
asked
 
to
 
withdraw
 
from
 
the
 
study.
 
This
 
includes
 
the
 
following:
 
if
 
a
 
participant
 
becomes
 
pregnant
 
during
 
the
 
study;
  
finding
 
out
 
that
 
certain
 
criteria
 
were
 
falsified
 
or
 
not
 
reported
 
(e.g.,
 
initial
 
age,
 
initial
 
BMI,
 
concurrent
 
enrollment
 
in
 
another
 
weight
 
management
 
intervention,
 
a
 
health
 
condition
 
that
 
contraindicates
 
weight
 
loss
 
or
 
requires
 
more
 
intensive
 
treatment),
 
or
  
investigator
 
discretion
 
for
 
safety
 
reasons.
 
 
Participants
 
who
 
become
 
pregnant
 
during
 
the

period
 
will
 
be
 
asked
 
to
 
leave
 
the

of
 
the
 
following
 
empirically-

:
 
Instead
 
of
 
designing
 
our

we
 
will
 
leverage
 
an
 
existing
 
state-of-the-art
 
commercial
 
app
 
from
 
Fitbit
 
that
 
is
 
freely
 
available
 
on
 
iPhone
 
and
 
Android
 
platforms.
 
At
 
baseline,
 
participants
 
will
 
install
 
the
 
app.
 
The
 
app
 
will
 
be
 
set
 
up
 
by
 
study
 
staff
 
so
 
that
 
it

38
 
Lessons
 
include

to
 
receive
 
this
 
component
 
will
 
be
 
instructed
 
to
 
self-monitor
 
their
 
step
 
count
 
daily
 
via
 
a
 
wrist-worn
 
activity
 
tracker
 
(Fitbit
 
Inspire
 
3).
 
In
 
conjunction
 
with
 
the
 
self-monitoring
 
goal,
 
a
 
tailored
 
daily
 
step
 
goal
 
will
 
be
 
given
 
(e.g.,
 
7,000
 
steps)
 
that
 
will
 
adapt
 
based
 
on
 
progress.
 
The
 
initial
 
week’s
 
step
 
goal
 
will
 
be
 
based
 
on
 
the
 
participant’s
 
baseline
 
scores
 
on
 
the
 
Godin
 
Leisure-Time
 
Exercise
 
Questionnaire
 
(GLTEQ)
 
leisure
 
score
 
index,
42-43
 
with
 
scores
 
ranging
 
from
 
0
 
to
 
13
 
(interpreted
 
as
 
insufficiently
 
active
)
 
assigned
 
to
 
a
 
goal
 
of
 
5000
 
steps
 
per
 
day,
 
scores
 
of
 
14
 
to
 
23
 
(
moderately
 
active
)
 
assigned
 
to
 
7000
 
steps
 
per
 
day,
 
and
 
scores
 
≥
 
24
 
(
active
)
 
assigned
 
to
 
10,000
 
steps
 
per
 
day.
 
Starting
 
in
 
the
 
second
 
week
 
of
 
the
 
intervention,
 
an
 
adaptive
 
step
 
goal
 
will
 
be
 
given
 
using
 
an
 
empirically
 
tested
 
algorithm
44-45
 
whereby
 
the
 
60th
 
percentile
 
of
 
the
 
past
 
week’s
 
daily
 
step
 
counts,
 
rounded
 
up
 
to
 
the
 
nearest
 
multiple
 
of
 
50,
 
is
 
assigned
 
as
 
the
 
subsequent
 
week’s
 
daily
 
step
 
goal.
 
For
 
example,
 
a
 
week
 
with
 
daily
 
steps
 
of
 
5000,
 
5100,
 
6000,
 
6500,
 
7000,
 
8200,
 
and
 
8500
 
would
 
result
 
in
 
a
 
daily
 
step
 
goal
 
of
 
6800
 
for
 
the
 
subsequent
 
week.
 
The
 
new
 
step
 
goal
 
will
 
appear
 
in
 
each
 
week’s
 
progress
 
report.
 
The
 
Fitbit
 
activity
 
tracker
 
will
 
be
 
synced
 
with
 
the
 
Fitbit
 
app
 
to
 
allow
 
participants
 
to
 
view
 
their
 
progress
 
towards
 
the
 
step
 
goal.
 
 
Self-monitoring
 
weight
 
(Yes
 
vs.
 
No)
:
 
Participants
 
randomized
 
to
 
receive
 
this
 
component
 
will
 
be
 
instructed
 
to
 
self-monitor
 
their
 
body
 
weight
 
daily
 
via
 
a
 
Bluetooth
 
enabled
 
e-scale
 
(the
 
Fitbit

These
 
participants
 
will
 
receive
 
a
 
weekly
 
weight
 
loss
 
goal
 
of
 
0.5
 
to
 
2.0
 
lbs.
 
(0.23
 
kg
 
to
 
0.91

that
 
is
 
required
 
to
 
achieve
 
10%

Outcomes
 
All
 
measures
 
collected
 
are
 
listed
 
in
 
Table
 
3
,
 
below.
 
 
3.8.1
 
Primary
 
Outcome
 
The
 
primary
 
outcome
 
is
 
weight
 
change
 
from
 
baseline
 
to
 
6
 
months
 
(in
 
kg),
 
which
 
will
 
be
 
assessed
 
objectively
 
via
 
e-scale
 
(Fitbit
 
Aria
 
Air)
 
that
 
will
 
be
 
mailed
 
to
 
participants.
 
At
 
each
 
assessment,
 
participants
 
will
 
receive
 
an
 
automated
 
email
 
in
 
the
 
morning
 
instructing
 
them
 
to
 
weigh
 
themselves
 
on
 
the
 
e-scale
 
and
 
follow
 
best-practices
46
:
 
place
 
the
 
scale
 
on
 
a
 
hard,
 
flat
 
surface;
 
remove
 
all
 
articles
 
of
 
clothing
 
and
 
accessories;
 
weigh
 
on
 
the
 
scale
 
in
 
the
 
morning
 
before
 
eating
 
or
 
drinking
 
and
 
after
 
emptying
 
their
 
bladder;
 
step
 
on
 
the
 
scale
 
and
 
record
 
the
 
value;
 
and
 
repeat
 
it
 
2
 
more
 
times
 
for
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
3
 
weight
 
measurements
 
per
 
time
 
point.
 
Weights
 
will
 
sync
 
from
 
the
 
e-scale
 
to
 
the
 
Fitbit
 
app
 
via
 
Bluetooth;
 
as
 
a
 
preventive
 
measure
 
in
 
case
 
of
 
syncing
 
errors,
 
participants
 
will
 
also
 
be
 
asked
 
to
 
input
 
their
 
weight
 
values
 
on
 
a
 
web-based
 
weight
 
check-in
 
form.
 
There
 
is
 
high
 
concordance
 
between
 
weights
 
measured
 
from
 
commercial
 
e-scales
 
and
 
those
 
from
 
scales
 
used
 
in
 
a
 
clinical
 
setting.
47-48
 
3.8.2
 
Secondary
 
and
 
Exploratory
 
Outcomes
 
Secondary
 
outcomes
 
include
 
the
 
following:
 
6-month
 
change
 
in
 
caloric
 
intake,
 
physical
 
activity,
 
BMI,
 
and
 
health-related
 
quality
 
of
 
life;
 
1-
 
and
 
3-month
 
weight
 
change;
 
and
 
the
 
proportion
 
of
 
participants
 
achieving
 
clinically
 
significant
 
weight
 
loss
 
(≥5%
 
at
 
6
 
months).
 
We
 
will
 
also
 
examine
 
additional
 
outcomes:
 
self-monitoring
 
engagement
 
rates
 
and
 
their
 
relation
 
to
 
6-month
 
weight
 
change;
 
6-month
 
changes
 
in
 
diet
 
quality;
 
6-month
 
changes
 
in
 
step
 
count
 
among
 
those
 
assigned
 
to
 
self-monitor
 
steps;
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
potential
 
moderators
 
on
 
6-month
 
weight
 
change
 
to
 
determine
 
for
 
whom
 
each
 
self-monitoring
 
strategy
 
works
 
best;
 
and
 
the
 
impact
 
of
 
the
 
orientation
 
session
 
on
 
6-month
 
retention.
 
In
 
exploratory
 
analyses,
 
6-month
 
weight
 
change
 
data
 
will
 
be
 
disaggregated
 
by
 
sex.
 
 
 
Caloric
 
intake
 
will
 
be
 
assessed
 
via
 
the
 
Automated
 
Self-Administered
 
24-hour
 
(ASA24)
 
Dietary
 
Assessment
 
Tool
 
(version
 
2022
 
and
 
2024-
 
beginning
 
in
 
April
 
2025),
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
free
 
web-based
 
tool
 
developed
 
by
 
the
 
National
 
Cancer
 
Institute.
49
 
Participants
 
will
 
be
 
asked
 
to
 
complete
 
a
 
total
 
of
 
four
 
24-hour
 
dietary
 
recalls,
 
including
 
two
 
at
 
baseline
 
and
 
two
 
at
 
6
 
months.
 
At
 
both
 
time
 
points,
 
we
 
will
 
request
 
one
 
weekday
 
recall
 
and
 
one
 
weekend
 
day
 
recall.
 
We
 
will
 
send
 
up
 
to
 
4
 
reminders
 
per
 
time
 
point.
 
We
 
will
 
exclude
 
from
 
our
 
analyses
 
any
 
recalls
 
with
 
outliers
 
of
 
daily
 
caloric
 
intake
 
reported
 
as
 
a
 
minimum
 
of
 
<800
 
kcal
 
for
 
everyone,
 
and
 
a
 
maximum
 
of
 
>4400
 
kcal
 
for
 
women
 
and
 
>5700
 
kcal
 
for
 
men,
 
in
 
accordance
 
with
 
ASA24
 
recommended
 
procedures.
50
 
To
 
compute
 
caloric
 
intake
 
at
 
each
 
time
 
point,
 
we
 
will
 
calculate
 
the
 
mean
 
of
 
the
 
weekday
 
recall
 
and
 
the
 
weekend-day
 
recall;
 
if
 
only
 
one
 
recall
 
is
 
available
 
at
 
a
 
given
 
time
 
point,
 
we
 
will
 
use
 
that
 
 
Spark
 
Trial
 
Protocol

18
 
value.
 
Diet
 
quality
 
will
 
be
 
assessed
 
using
 
the
 
Healthy-Eating
 
Index-2020,
51
 
calculated
 
from
 
ASA24
 
data.
 
Physical
 
activity
 
will
 
be
 
assessed
 
via
 
the
 
GLTEQ,
 
a
 
self-report
 
measure
 
that
 
assesses
 
the
 
past
 
week’s
 
frequency
 
of
 
different
 
types
 
of
 
exercise
 
(strenuous,
 
moderate,
 
and
 
mild
 
or
 
light)
 
that
 
were
 
engaged
 
in
 
for
 
more
 
than
 
15
 
minutes
 
during
 
one’s
 
free
 
time.
42-43
 
Strenuous
 
activities
 
are
 
described
 
as
 
those
 
where
 
one’s
 
“heart
 
beats
 
rapidly”
 
(e.g.,
 
running,
 
jogging,
 
or
 
swimming),
 
moderate
 
activities
 
are
 
described
 
as
 
“not
 
exhausting”
 
(e.g.,
 
fast
 
walking
 
or
 
tennis),
 
and
 
mild
 
activities
 
are
 
described
 
as
 
requiring
 
“minimal
 
effort”
 
(e.g.,
 
yoga
 
or
 
easy
 
walking).
 
A
 
leisure
 
score
 
index
 
will
 
be
 
created
 
using
 
the
 
following
 
formula:
 
(strenuous
 
×9)
 
+
 
(moderate
 
×5)
 
+
 
(light
 
×3),
 
with
 
higher
 
scores
 
indicating
 
more
 
frequent
 
exercise.
 
To
 
assess
 
weekly
 
moderate-to-vigorous
 
physical
 
activity
 
(MVPA),
 
a
 
composite
 
score
 
will
 
be
 
created
 
using
 
the
 
same
 
procedures
 
but
 
excluding
 
the
 
light
 
activities;
 
from
 
this
 
MVPA
 
score
 
index,
 
scores
 
of
 
≥
 
24
 
units
 
will
 
be
 
interpreted
 
as
 
active
 
and
 
scores
 
<
 
24
 
will
 
be
 
considered
 
insufficiently
 
active.
52
 
We
 
will
 
objectively
 
assess
 
step
 
count
 
using
 
the
 
Fitbit
 
Inspire
 
3
 
activity
 
tracker,
 
among
 
those
 
assigned
 
to
 
track
 
steps.
 
We
 
will
 
operationalize
 
the
 
week
 
1
 
step
 
count
 
as
 
the
 
average
 
of
 
the
 
first
 
7
 
days
 
of
 
the
 
intervention
 
and
 
6-month
 
step
 
count
 
as
 
the
 
average
 
of
 
the
 
last
 
7
 
days
 
(week
 
26),
 
so
 
long
 
as
 
≥
 
3
 
valid
 
days
 
(≥1000
 
steps/day)
 
per
 
week
 
are
 
reported.
53
 
 
 
Health-related
 
quality
 
of
 
life
 
(HRQoL)
 
will
 
be
 
assessed
 
using
 
the
 
36-item
 
Short
 
Form
 
Health
 
Survey
 
(SF-36),
54
 
with
 
scores
 
provided
 
for
 
both
 
the
 
physical
 
component
 
and
 
mental
 
component.
 
It
 
assesses
 
8
 
domains:
 
physical
 
functioning,
 
role-physical,
 
bodily
 
pain,
 
general
 
health,
 
vitality,
 
social
 
functioning,
 
role-emotional,
 
and
 
mental
 
health.
 
 
Self-monitoring
 
engagement
 
will
 
be
 
assessed
 
objectively
 
for
 
all
 
182
 
days
 
(6
 
months)
 
of
 
the
 
intervention
 
using
 
data
 
collected
 
from
 
the
 
Fitbit
 
digital
 
tools.
 
Engagement
 
will
 
be
 
operationalized
 
as
 
the
 
percent
 
of
 
days
 
in
 
the
 
intervention
 
that
 
participants
 
self-monitor
 
dietary
 
intake,
 
steps,
 
and
 
weight
 
(each
 
reported
 
separately).
 
For
 
self-monitoring
 
of
 
diet,
 
we
 
will
 
count
 
days
 
as
 
valid
 
if
 
they
 
have
 
≥
 
800
 
kcal
 
recorded,
 
which
 
is
 
a
 
common
 
threshold.
 
For
 
self-monitoring
 
of
 
steps,
 
we
 
will
 
count
 
days
 
as
 
valid
 
only
 
if
 
≥
 
1000
 
steps
 
are
 
recorded;
 
this
 
minimum
 
threshold
 
is
 
used
 
to
 
minimize
 
the
 
possibility
 
of
 
inaccurately
 
counting
 
days
 
with
 
high
 
amounts
 
of
 
non-wear
 
time.
55
 
We
 
will
 
also
 
assess
 
engagement
 
in
 
other
 
intervention
 
components,
 
including
 
the
 
percentage
 
of
 
action
 
plans
 
completed,
 
which
 
is
 
objectively
 
assessed
 
via
 
Qualtrics,
 
with
 
100%
 
indicating
 
completion
 
of
 
all
 
19
 
action
 
plans.
 
Via
 
self-report
 
at
 
6
 
months,
 
we
 
will
 
assess
 
which
 
of
 
the
 
19
 
lessons
 
were
 
read
 
and
 
the
 
frequency
 
with
 
which
 
progress
 
reports
 
were
 
reviewed,
 
with
 
options
 
of
 
weekly
,
 
less
 
than
 
1

Putative
 
moderators
 
will
 
be
 
assessed
 
via
 
self-report

measures
 
administered
 
at

including
 
demographic
 
(e.g.,

could
 
be
 
assigned.
 
Study
 
staff
 
will
 
not

to
 
treatment
 
assignment
 
due
 
to
 
logistical
 
limitations

In
 
the

will
 
verify
 
whether

If
 
a

Participant
 
Population
 
and
 
Screening
 
All
 
participants
 
will
 
be
 
adults
 
with
 
overweight/obesity
 
who
 
are
 
otherwise
 
healthy.
 
Individuals
 
who
 
are
 
pregnant
 
or
 
who
 
have
 
a
 
medical
 
condition
 
that
 
would
 
limit
 
participation
 
in
 
a
 
behavioral
 
weight
 
loss
 
intervention
 
or
 
be
 
better
 
suited
 
for
 
a
 
more

different
 
type
 
of
 
intervention
 
are
 
excluded
 
from
 
our
 
trial
 
(e.g.,
 
individuals
 
with
 
a
 
history
 
of
 
an
 
eating
 
disorder
 
or
 
cardiovascular
 
event,
 
uncontrolled
 
diabetes
 
mellitus
 
or
 
hypertension,
 
cancer,
 
dementia).
 
Risks
 
to
 
participants
 
are
 
anticipated
 
to
 
be
 
low
 
given
 
that
 
we
 
are
 
examining
 
evidence-based
 
intervention
 
strategies
 
and
 
promoting
 
weight
 
loss
 
through
 
lifestyle
 
change
 
(e.g.,
 
decrease
 
intake
 
of
 
unhealthy
 
foods,
 
increase
 
steps).
 
We
 
will
 
not
 
be
 
including
 
a
 
vulnerable
 
population
 
(e.g.,
 
children,
 
pregnant
 
women)
 
as
 
participants.
 
 
To
 
ensure
 
participant
 
safety
 
in
 
this
 
study,
 
a
 
set
 
of
 
screening
 
procedures
 
that
 
are
 
common
 
in
 
behavioral
 
weight

interventions,
 
such
 
as
 
ensuring
 
participants
 
are
 
safe
 
to
 
engage
 
in
 
moderate
 
intensity
 
physical
 
activity
 
and
 
ensuring
 
participants
 
do
 
not

a

condition
 
that
 
is

Study
 
staff
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
primary
 
source
 
of
 
contact
 
with
 
participants
 
(e.g.,
 
sending
 
intervention
 
materials
 
and
 
confirming
 
completion
 
of
 
assessments).
 
Study
 
staff
 
will
 
alert
 
the
 
PI
 
of
 
any
 
negative
 
participant
 
feedback.
 
Based
 
on
 
participant
 
feedback,
 
the
 
PI
 
will
 
revise
 
the
 
intervention
 
and
 
study
 
procedures
 
as
 
necessary
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
risks
 
of
 
injury

discomfort
 
are
 
minimized
 
and
 
will
 
seek
 
IRB
 
approval
 
before
 
doing
 
so.
 
Study
 
staff
 
will
 
flag
 
any
 
unexpectedly

after
 
the
 
trial’s
 
primary
 
completion
 
date.
 
Consent
 
documents
 
for
 
this
 
trial
 
will
 
include
 
a
 
specific
 
statement
 
relating
 
to
 
posting
 
of
 
clinical
 
trial
 
information
 
at
 
ClinicalTrials.gov.
 
 
The
 
Stanford
 
University
 
School
 
of
 
Medicine
 
has
 
an
 
internal
 
policy
 
in
 
place
 
to
 
ensure
 
that
 
clinical
 
trials
 
registration
 
and
 
results
 
reporting
 
occur
 
in
 
compliance
 
with
 
policy
 
requirements.
 
Specifically,
 
the
 
policy
 
states
 
that
 
the
 
PI
 
will
 
be
 
the
 
Responsible
 
Party
 
for
 
registering,
 
updating,
 
and
 
reporting
 
results
 
from
 
the
 
clinical
 
trial
 
in
 
a
 
timely
 
manner.
 
Registration
 
was
 
completed
 
via
 
the
 
Stanford
 
ClinicalTrials.gov
 
Protocol
 
Registration
 
System
 
(PRS).
 
 
 
Commensurate
 
with
 
current
 
requirements,
 
once
 
the
 
study
 
data
 
have
 
undergone
 
final
 
data
 
cleaning,
 
analysis,
 
and
 
planned
 
publications,
 
we
 
will
 
make
 
the
 
final
 
data
 
collected
 
as
 
part
 
of
 
the
 
proposed
 
research
 
available
 
in
 
electronic
 
form
 
to
 
researchers
 
who
 
request
 
them.
 
We
 
will
 
request
 
that
 
researchers
 
submit
 
a
 
data
 
request
 
in
 
writing
 
to
 
the
 
project
 
Principal
 
Investigator
 
so
 
that
 
the
 
requested
 
data
 
can
 
be
 
made
 
available
 
while
 
protecting
 
the
 
confidentiality
 
of
 
study
 
participants
 
and
 
ensuring
 
that
 
the
 
proposed
 
research
 
questions
 
do
 
not
 
overlap
 
with
 
planned
 
publication
 
development
 
by
 
the
 
project
 
research
 
team
 
or
 
other
 
groups.
 
The
 
requested
 
dataset
 
will
 
be
 
free
 
of
 
identifiers
 
that
 
would
 
permit
 
linkages
 
to
 
individual
 
research
 
participants
 
and
 
we
 
will
 
remove
 
protected
 
health
 
information
 
in
 
compliance
 
with
 
the
 
HIPAA
 
Privacy
 
Rule.
 
The
 
requestor
 
must
 
agree
 
to
 
maintain
 
the
 
privacy
 
and
 
confidentiality
 
of
 
the
 
data
 
and
 
must
 
indicate
 
how
 
they
 
plan
 
to
 
store
 
the
 
data
 
to
 
demonstrate
 
compliance
 
with
 
secure
 
computing.
 
NIH
 
guidelines,
 
institutional
 
policies,
 
IRB
 
rules,
 
and
 
regulatory
 
policies
 
will
 
be
 
taken
 
into
 
account.
 
Per
 
NIH
 
guidelines,
 
all
 
publications
 
that
 
emerge
 
from
 
this
 
award
 
will
 
be
 
publicly
 
available
 
via
 
PubMed
 
Central.
 
Study
 
results
 
will
 
be
 
shared
 
through
 
presentations
 
at
 
national
 
conferences
 
of
 
professional
 
organizations
 
(e.g.,
 
Society
 
of
 
Behavioral
 
Medicine;
 
The
 
Obesity
 
Society),
 
articles
 
in
 
peer-reviewed
 
journals,
 
and
 
postings
 
on
 
social
 
media
 
channels.

Access
 
to

The
 
principal
 
investigator
 
will
 
retain
 
access
 
to

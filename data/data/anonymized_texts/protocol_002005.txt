oxaliplatin in vitro  and i n vivo .   
1a. The magnitude of ERCC1 up regulation in response to oxaliplatin treatment will be 
c
orrelated with apoptotic and growth inhibitory response in a panel a 30 colon cancer cell 
lines previously screened for response to this agent in the Montefiore laboratory.   
1b. Directly test the link between up regulation of ERCC-1 and oxaliplatin response.  ERCC-1

to ox
aliplatin will also be determined.   
2b. Determine whether a specific ERCC-1 polymorphism is linked to objective response to 
oxaliplatin in vivo, and further, to determine whether a specific polymorphism is linked to the

2.0 BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE 
 
Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among both men and women, 
accounting for over 56,000 deaths annually [2].  For patients with advanced colon cancer, 
oxaliplatin (trans-L-1, 2-diamino cyclohexane oxalatoplatinum) has been approved for therapy as 
a
 front line agent [3].  The platinum drugs include the prototype cisplatin, and its analogs, 
carboplatin and oxaliplatin, and have been the mainstay of therapy for lung, ovarian, breast, 
cervical, head and neck, and testicular cancer.  These drugs exert their anti cancer activity by 
forming inter-, and intra- (DNA) strand platinum adducts thereby causing DNA damage and

ERCC-1 CRC study 5 inhibiting cell replication.  In spite of these advances, the benefits that patients derive remain 
dismal with response rates in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer in the range of 
15-20%, and median survival of 9 months at best [4].  For patients with metastatic colon cancer, 
with 
the incorporation of new agents, including oxaliplatin, the median survival has improved to 
24 months with response rates of 50-60% [5].   
DNA damaging agents depend on irreversibly damaging the cell’s DNA in order to exert an anti 
cancer effect.  Successful anti cancer therapy is limited by the cancer cell’s ability to bypass the 
lethal action and subsequent development of drug resistance.  In the case of the platinum 
compounds, the resistance of the cancer cell to the chemotherapy is multifactorial [6,7,8] and 
includes: reduction in drug entry and subsequent accumulation within the cell [6,8]; enhanced 
detoxification by the glutathione and metallothionein systems by sequestration of platinum and 
prevention of formation of DNA adducts [6,9,10,11]; altered patterns of platinum-DNA adduct 
formation [12,13]; prevention of DNA damage after the formation of the DNA-platinum adducts 
by either the ability to rapidly repair the DNA damage [3,4,5,11], or by development of tolerance 
to the DNA damage [12,13].  The repair of DNA damage is made possible by the nucleotide 
excision repair (NER) pathway.  Two major genes involved in this pathway are the excision 
repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC-1) and the ERCC-2 (xeroderma pigmentosa - 
XPD) gene.  It has been well established that expression levels of the ERCC-1 gene can 
significantly affect the ability of the drug to influence survival in patients with colon cancer [14].  
The NER reaction is carried out by a multienzyme complex and undergoes a stepwise process of 
recognition, incision, excision, repair synthesis and ligation [15,16].  The ERCC-1 protein forms 
a complex with the XPF product, which leads to development of endonuclease activity [15].  
This then excises DNA-platinum adduct at the 5’ end of the damaged strand [17,18].  Thus far, 
NER is the only known mechanism for the removal and subsequent repair of the damage 
produced by the platinum drugs [19].   
Studies on ovarian and colon cancer cell lines have demonstrated that there is up regulation of 
gene transcription with a rise in both mRNA and protein levels on exposure to cisplatin and 
oxaliplatin, respectively.  We therefore hypothesize that up regulation of ERCC gene expression 
in colorectal cancer cell lines is a reason for the different sensitivity patterns among the 30 colon 
cancer cell lines.  Studies have demonstrated that the extent of DNA damage repair as evidenced 
by the ERCC-1 expression levels is 30-50 times higher in resistant cells as compared to 
hypersensitive cells [20].  Other studies have also proven that in addition to colon cancer, the 
expression of the ERCC-1 gene also predicts for survival and cisplatin resistance in patients with 
lung [21], gastric [22] and ovarian [23] cancer.  Enhanced ERCC expression is directly linked to 
clinical response to cisplatin in ovarian cancer patients [23,24].  It has been clearly established 
that cells that are defective in this pathway are hypersensitive to the platinum [25,26], and those 
overactive in this pathway are resistant [8,27,28].  In a study involving 4 cancer cell lines, 
ovarian and an inherently cisplatin resistant colon (HT-29) cell lines were used.  ERCC-1 mRNA 
levels were measured after exposure to oxaliplatin for 20 hours and were higher than in the 
control, the A2780 (ovarian) cell line [29].  Another group studied the combination of irinotecan 
and oxaliplatin in HCT-8 cell lines and xenograft modes and observed that the ERCC- 1 
expression was upregulated on exposure to oxaliplatin.  Addition of irinotecan abrogated this 
effect, with the potential for synergy between the two drugs by the inhibition of DNA repair and 
increased cytotoxicity of the platinum [30]. 
Investigating ERCC-1 gene polymorphisms, DNA was collected from a clinical study evaluating 
the use of oxaliplatin in patients with advanced colorectal cancer and the C→T single nucleotide 
polymorphism in exon 118 was studied.  Patients with the C/C genotype had the most favorable 
survival.  The homozygous TT and the heterozygous CT patients had a relative risk of dying of

ERCC-1 CRC study 6 1.86 and 2.29 (p=0.021); respectively [31]; however there is no evidence that the polymorphism 
bears an association with response.  Similar findings have been observed in lung cancer [32,33].  
In a group of cisplatin treated patients, the C/C homozygous genotype was associated with a 
median survival of 486 days and was significantly (p=0.0058) greater than the T/T genotype with 
a median survival of 281 days.  We also propose to look at polymorphisms in these cell lines and 
establish the presence or absence of an association between the genetic polymorphisms, and the 
cellular sensitivity to the cytotoxicity of oxaliplatin.   
While there is extensive pre-clinical data suggesting the influence of ERCC-1 on platinum 
sensitivity, in vivo  data continues to be lacking.  The aim of this proposal is to study changes in 
ERCC-1 gene expression in PBMC and fresh tumor tissue, both before and after oxaliplatin 
therapy.  While it is critical to determine the expression pattern within the malignant cell, 
practically, it is difficult to obtain fresh tumor specimens, especially if one is interested in serial 
sampling to study changes in RNA over time, or on exposure to drugs or toxins.  Some studies 
have demonstrated that in certain circumstances, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
could serve as a reliable surrogate marker for cancer tissue.  Smoking induced carcinogen- DNA 
a
dducts were compared and levels from PBMC were found to be a reliable surrogate for levels in 
lung cancer specimens [34].  Patients with renal cancer were treated with the mTOR inhibitor 
CCI-779, and the gene expression profiles from their PBMC reliably identified the expression 
profile with a higher likelihood of a response [35].  Another mTOR inhibitor RAD 0001, was 
looked at in a syngeneic rat pancreatic tumor model, and it was found that long term monitoring 
of PBMC derived S6K1 activity levels could be used for assessing RAD 001 treatment schedules 
in patients with cancer [36].  The PBMC may reflect the events in the cancer cell and it is 
important to make this determination and derive a relationship between the gene expressions in 
the two sources of cells.  The study will look at ERCC-1 gene expression in PBMC and 
determine a correlation between the changes in the expression levels in the PBMC and fresh 
tumor tissue.  If it can be established that the PBMC serves as a surrogate marker for the events 
within the tumor cell, in the future all studies can be readily performed on the peripheral cells 
with confidence.   
Multiple reports have indicated that among patients with colorectal cancer, the survival of 
African Americans is lower than that for Caucasians.  Possible explanations for this disparity is 
lower socio-economic status, lack of screening, delayed diagnoses, and genetic differences that 
possibly render one population to derive less benefit from the available therapy [37,38,39].  
Retrospective data suggests that baseline ERCC-1 expression and the polymorphisms do impact 
on survival of colorectal cancer patients who are treated with oxaliplatin.  We therefore 
hypothesize that one factor accounting for the racial disparity in survival is attributable to 
differences in baseline expression or to a more frequent presence of polymorphism that is 
associated with a poorer survival.   
 
With the advent of modern micro array technology, it is possible to screen a cell line or tumor 
sample for thousands of genes at one time and using this technique, research groups have 
established specific gene expression profiles that predict for sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs [40].  
The laboratory of Drs. Leonard Augenlicht and John Mariadason has identified the gene 
expression profile in a panel of 30 colon cancer cell lines and that could determine sensitivity 
and resistance patterns to the cytotoxic effects of 5-fluorouracil and irinotecan [41].  They have 
found that the selection of 50 genes correlated with 5-FU responsiveness, but not a random set of 
50 genes.  Also found was that this gene expression was a better predictor of 5-FU response than 
the previous well-established predictors of response, namely, thymidylate synthase, thymidine 
phosphorylase, p53 and mismatch repair status.

ERCC-1 CRC study 7 3.0  PRELIMINARY DATA 
The cell biology department at the Albert Einstein Cancer Center has studied a panel of 30 colon 
cancer cell lines and determined a sensitivity pattern to various drugs used in the clinic as a 
therapeutic option for patients with advanced disease [55].  The laboratory of Dr. John 
Mariadason has studied a panel of 30 colon cancer cell lines and observed that there is a distinct 
susceptibility pattern with cells ranging from being highly susceptible (GI 50 of 0.5, 95% 
apoptosis) to highly resistant (GI 50 of 11, 10% apoptosis) to oxaliplatin [54].  This pattern is 
hereby displayed below [fig 1].  As is evident, cell lines have been arranged in order of 
increasing sensitivity to oxaliplatin from least sensitive to the most sensitive.  It is this cell lines 
model that will be used for this project to determine ERCC-1 gene expression profiling, to carry 
out the gene silencing experiments, and to determine germline polymorphisms.

6.0  TREATMENT PLAN AND STUDY DESIGN 
The 30 colon cancer cell lines panel that has been described in the preliminary data section of the 
protocol will be used.  Total ERCC-1 mRNA will be extracted using the RNeasy RNA extraction 
kit from Qiagen and converted to cDNA using an anchored oligo dT primer and reverse 
transcriptase.  Quantitative real time PCR will be used to quantify ERCC1 mRNA and results 
expressed relative to GAPDH levels.  Total cellular protein will be extracted and ERCC-1 
protein level quantified by Western Blotting using an anti ERCC-1 antibody.   
Forty patients (20 patients/year) will be enrolled to collect four tubes of 7 ml of blood for PBMC 
analysis.  This will be used to collect cells for ERCC expression.  mRNA will be measured by 
quantitative PCR [22,44] and protein by Western Blotting [45].  This tube of blood will be drawn 
before commencement of any chemotherapy (0 hours/baseline), at the end of infusion (2 hours) , 
and at 48 hours (this is typically when patients return to the infusion unit to discontinue the 5-FU 
infusional pump).  Another tube will be collected when the patient returns on the first day of the 
next cycle.  The PBMC samples will be processed within 60 minutes of collection.   
In addition, patients will be identified before a diagnostic procedure such as an endoscopy, or a 
CT guided biopsy.  The patients will be asked to sign a consent form before the diagnostic 
procedure that will allow the use their biopsy or resection specimens as a source of tissue.  The 
gastroenterologist performing the endoscopies will biopsy two specimens, of which one 
specimen will be formalin fixed and sent to pathology for the establishment of a diagnosis.  The 
second will be handed to me my designee and this will be immediately placed in dry ice in the 
operating/procedure room.  The sample will be transported out of the procedure room 
immediately and then placed in liquid nitrogen.  This tissue will be studied for ERCC-1 mRNA 
e
xpression.  For patients from whom we will be unable to obtain fresh tumor samples, only the 
formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue block will be used to estimate ERCC-1 protein content 
in a semi-quantitative manner using the immune-histochemistry (IHC) analysis using a 
c
ommercially available antibody to the protein [42].  The IHC staining will be performed using 
antibodies from biomeda, and analyses using standard techniques described previously [43].  
Appropriate positive and negative controls will be used.  The IHC will be graded as positive or 
negative and will be independently verified by a pathologist blinded to the identity of the sample.  
It is estimated that close to 22%, of patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer are 
able to undergo curative resection of the metastases after therapy with the FOLFOX regimen [5].  
The surgeon performing the liver resection will hand over a piece of the resected specimen to my 
designee or me and this will be handled in a manner described previously.  This will facilitate 
gene expression study over time after a 2-hour exposure to oxaliplatin.  Both, the fresh tissue and 
the PBMC will be analyzed for semi-quantitative ERCC-1 by IHC staining, and by quantitative 
mRNA and protein analyses.  Analyses to estimate the degree of correlation between the 
magnitude of change in the ERCC-1 gene expression in PBMC and the fresh tumor samples will 
be performed.

ERCC-1 CRC study 11 All patients will undergo serial radiological testing (CT scans) every 2 cycles (each cycle 
consisting of 4 weeks of therapy in case of FOLFOX or 3 weeks in case of XELOX).  The 
patients will be evaluated for response using the response evaluation criteria in solid tumors 
(RECIST) as described previously [46].   
 
Silencing of ERCC-1 
 
To directly determine the role of ERCC-1 in mediating cellular response to oxaliplatin in colon 
cancer cells, we will transfect 2 oxaliplatin-resistant cell lines with siRNAs that specifically 
target ERCC-1.  siRNAs will be purchased from Dharmacon, and transfected into cell lines using 
lipofectamine 2000 at a final siRNA concentration of 100 nM.  As a control, cells will also be 
transfected with a non-targeting siRNA.  The silencing efficiency of the siRNAs will be 
validated 24 hours post transfection by their ability to inhibit basal and oxaliplatin-induced 
ERCC-1 expression at the mRNA (QPCR) and protein level (western blot).  Once silencing 
efficiency has been confirmed, apoptotic response of ERCC-1-silenced colon cancer cells treated 
with 
1, 10 and 100 μM oxaliplatin for 72 hours will be compared to cells transfected with non-
targeting siRNA.  Apoptosis will be assessed by propidium iodide staining followed by FACS 
analysis.  Experiments will be performed in triplicate on 3 independent occasions.  In addition to 
apoptosis assays, we will further test the role of ERCC-1 silencing on oxaliplatin response by 
clonogenic assay.  Cells transfected with ERCC-1 or non-targeting siRNA will be treated with 1, 
10 or 100 mM oxaliplatin for 9 hours, following which time the drug will be removed, cells 
trypsinized, and reseeded in fresh medium at a density of 500 cells per well.  Colony formation 
will be monitored over the following 2 weeks and visualized by staining with crystal violet.   
From the panel of 30 colon cancer cell lines, genomic DNA will be extracted and studied for 
germline polymorphisms as described below.  Similarly, from the baseline PBMC from all 
patients, DNA will be extracted to determine germline polymorphisms.  The genomic DNA will 
be prepared from PBMC using the Puregene blood DNA kit (Gentra Inc.) following the 
manufacturer’s protocol.  The ERCC-1 C→T polymorphism will be detected using modified 
PCR-RFLP methods, using primer sequences described previously [33].  It is well established 
that certain germline polymorphisms in the ERCC-1 gene predicts for increased survival, 
however, no such association has been established with clinical response.  This proposal will 
determine an association between the presence of a particular polymorphism with changes in 
ERCC gene expression, and of the ERCC-1 gene polymorphisms with clinical response.   
 
To 
gain further insights into the mechanisms of oxaliplatin response and to identify novel 
molecular determinants for differential cellular response to this agent, we will undertake a non-
hypothesis driven microarray-based screening strategy.  Based on our preliminary data, we will 
select the 5 most oxaliplatin-sensitive (LS174T, SW403, RW7213, HCC2998, SW948) and 5 
most oxaliplatin-resistant cell lines (KM12, SW1116, LoVo, Caco-2, 16E) for further analysis 
(10 cell lines in total).  Each of these cell lines will be treated with 10 μM oxaliplatin for 24 
hours.  Total RNA will be isolated from treated and untreated cells using the RNeasy kit 
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA).  For microarray hybridizations, 50 μg of RNA from oxaliplatin treated 
cells will be labeled with Cy5 dUTP, and 50 μg of RNA from untreated cells labeled with Cy3 
dUTP.  Probe preparation, hybridization conditions, and array scanning procedure were as 
previously described and as routinely performed in our laboratory [47,48].  Labeled probes will 
be hybridized to 27,000 feature cDNA microarrays generated by the Albert Einstein College of 
Medicine microarray facility [49].  Images will be analyzed using Genepix Pro software (Axon 
Instruments, Union City, CA), and lowess normalized.  For each cell line, two independent 
oxaliplatin treatment experiments will be performed, and the mean value (ratio) for each gene 
computed.

ERCC-1 CRC study 12 Genes differentially expressed between oxaliplatin sensitive and resistance cell lines will be 
determined using a students t test, with a P value of <0.05 considered to be statistically 
significant.  To reduce the number of false positive discoveries, the mean value across the 5 
sensitive and 5 resistant cell lines will be computed, and genes that are differently expressed 2-
fold or greater between sensitive and resistant cell lines determined.  Genes that satisfy both of 
these criteria will be considered differentially expressed between oxaliplatin sensitive and 
resistant cell lines.  To gain mechanistic insights into differentially expressed gene lists, we 
routinely perform enrichment analyses to identify functionally related categories of genes 
enriched for differential expression.  For this analysis we will take advantage of our prior 
classification of all genes on the AECOM cDNA microarrays into 150 biologically related 
categories, including cell cycle progression mediators, apoptosis mediators, transcription factors 
and signaling mediators.  We will utilize a Fisher exact test to identify biologically related 
categories of genes enriched for altered expression in response to oxaliplatin treatment and 
differentially expressed between oxaliplatin sensitive and resistant cell lines.  Differentially 
expressed genes will be validated by RT-PCR and whether specific candidate genes play a direct 
role in oxaliplatin response tested by siRNA-mediated silencing experiments followed by 
reassessment of oxaliplatin response.   
 
The same biopsy material described in aim 1 that will be obtained from patients pre- and post-
oxaliplatin treatment will be used to determine the changes in gene expression induced by this 
agent in vivo.  RNA will be extracted from biopsies by homogenization of biopsy tissue in Trizol 
followed by further purification using an RNeasy column (Qiagen).  From previous studies we 
envision obtaining between 2-5 micrograms of total RNA from patient biopsies [50].  RNA will 
be linearly amplified by T7 bacteriophage RNA polymerase driven in vitro transcription 
(Arcturus, KIT 0201).  For colon cancer cell lines, this procedure typically yields approximately 
30 μg of polyU mRNA from 5 μg of total starting RNA.  5 μg of polyU/polyA mRNA from pre 
and post treatment specimens will be labeled with Cy5 dUTP and compared to 5 μg of Cy3 
dUTP-labeled reference RNA routinely utilized in the Augenlicht laboratory [55].  Comparison 
of the pre and post treatment samples to a reference RNA will enable additional analyses to be 
performed in the future, including the identification of genes / signatures whose basal level of 
expression may be predictive of oxaliplatin response.  Patient with good and bad response to 
oxaliplatin will be separated and genes differentially expressed in response to oxaliplatin 
identified as described in previously.  In addition, genes altered in expression in response to 
oxaliplatin treatment in vitro and in vivo will be identified.   
 
Oxaliplatin and other chemotherapy will be delivered as is standard of care.  However, doses 
may be modified per treating physician and patient tolerance

ERCC-1 CRC study 13 7.0 SUPPORTIVE THERAPY GUIDELINES 
 
Use of supportive therapy including antiemetic therapy will be at the discretion of the 
treating physician.  However, it is suggested that patients receive a 5-HT3 antagonist, 
decadron and lorazepam prior to oxaliplatin dosing.   
Use of colony stimulating factors (such as Procrit, Aranesp, Neupogen, Neulasta) is 
allowed and is at the discretion of the treating physician.   
For patients with bony metastases, use of bisphosphanate therapy is allowed and is at the 
discretion of the treating physician.   
 
8.0        M ONITORING OF PATIENTS 
 
Patients will be evaluated as is standard of care for a patient receiving oxaliplatin based 
therapy either alone or in combination with 5-FU (FOLFOX) or with capecitabine 
(Xeloda® - XELOX).  It is suggested that they at least be evaluated once every other 
week by the treating physician.   
 
All patients will have imaging studies for tumor evaluation at baseline and at the end of 
two cycles (each cycle consisting of 4 weeks with FOLFOX or 3 weeks of XELOX).

11.0 RESPONSE CRITERIA 
 
De
termination of response rate is a secondary objective of this study and any responses 
will be documented and reported. The RECIST criteria to determine treatment status 
(2000) will be followed.  
 
11.1 Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)  
 
Elig
ibility 
 
 
Measurable disease - the presence of at least one measurable lesion. If the measurable disease is 
restricted to a solitary lesion, its neoplastic nature should be confirmed by cytology/histology.  
 
Measurable lesions - lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension with 
longest diameter >20 mm using conventional techniques or >10 mm with spiral CT scan. 
 
Non-measurable lesions - all other lesions, including small lesions (longest diameter <20 mm 
with conventional techniques or <10 mm with spiral CT scan), i.e., bone lesions, leptomeningeal 
disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusion, inflammatory breast disease, lymphangitis 
cutis/pulmonis, cystic lesions, and also abdominal masses that are not confirmed and followed by 
imaging techniques; and. 
 
All measurements should be taken and recorded in metric notation, using a ruler or calipers. All 
baseline evaluations should be performed as closely as possible to the beginning of treatment and 
never more than 4 weeks before the beginning of the treatment. The same method of assessment 
and the same technique should be used to characterize each identified and reported lesion at 
baseline and during follow-up.  
Clinical lesions will only be considered measurable when they are superficial (e.g., skin nodules 
and palpable lymph nodes). For the case of skin lesions, documentation by color photography, 
including a ruler to estimate the size of the lesion is recommended.  
 
Methods of Measurement -  
 
CT and MRI are the best currently available and reproducible methods to measure target lesions 
selected for response assessment. Conventional CT and MRI should be performed with cuts of 
10 mm or less in slice thickness contiguously. Spiral CT should be performed using a 5 mm 
contiguous reconstruction algorithm.  
 
Baseline documentation of "Target" and "Non-Target" lesions 
 
All measurable lesions up to a maximum of five lesions per organ and 10 lesions in total, 
representative of all involved organs should be identified as target lesions and recorded and 
measured at baseline. Target lesions should be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the 
longest diameter) and their suitability for accurate repeated measurements (either by imaging 
techniques or clinically). A sum of the longest diameter (LD) for all target lesions will be 
calculated and reported as the baseline sum LD. The baseline sum LD will be used as reference 
by which to characterize the objective tumor. All other lesions (or sites of disease) should be 
identified as non-target lesions and should also be recorded at baseline. Measurements of these

ERCC-1 CRC study 17 lesions are not required, but the presence or absence of each should be noted throughout follow-
up. 
 
R
esponse Criteria 
 
Evaluation of target lesions 
1. Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions 
2. Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking 
as reference the baseline sum LD 
3. Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the LD of target lesions, 
taking as reference the smallest sum LD recorded since the treatment started or the appearance of 
one or more new lesions 
4. Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to 
qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum LD since the treatment started 
 
Evaluation of non-target lesions 
1.Com
plete Response (CR): Disappearance of all non-target lesions and normalization of tumor 
marker level 
2.Incomplete Response/Stable Disease (SD): Persistence of one or more non-target lesion(s) 
or/and maintenance of tumor marker level above the normal limits 
3.Progressive Disease (PD): Appearance of one or more new lesions and/or unequivocal 
progression of existing non-target lesion.  
 
(1) Although a clear progression of "non target" lesions only is exceptional, in such 
circumstances, the opinion of the treating physician should prevail and the progression status 
should be confirmed later on by the review panel (or study chair). 
 
Evaluation of best overall response 
 
The best overall response is the best response recorded from the start of the treatment until 
disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for PD the smallest measurements recorded 
since the treatment started). In general, the patient's best 
response assignment will depend on the achievement of both measurement and confirmation 
criteria  
 
Target lesions  Non-target lesions  Evaluation of NTL  Overall Response  
CR CR No CR 
CR Incomplete Resp./ SD  No PR 
PR Non-PD No PR 
SD Non-PD No SD 
PD Any Yes or No  PD 
Any PD Yes or No  PD 
Any Any Yes PD 
 
Patients with a global deterioration of health status requiring discontinuation of treatment 
without objective evidence of disease progression at that time should be classified as having 
"symptomatic deterioration". Every effort should be made to document the objective progression 
even after discontinuation of treatment.  
 
I
n some circumstances it may be difficult to distinguish residual disease from normal tissue. 
When the evaluation of complete response depends on this determination, it is recommended that

ERCC-1 CRC study 18 the residual lesion be investigated (fine needle aspirate/biopsy) to confirm the complete response 
status.  
 
Duration of overall response 
 
The duration of overall response is measured from the time measurement criteria are met for CR 
or PR (whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that recurrence or PD is objectively 
documented, taking as reference for PD the measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
 
Duration of stable disease 
 
SD is measured from the start of the treatment until the criteria for disease progression are met, 
taking as reference the smallest measurements recorded since the treatment started.  
 
 
11.2 Time to Disease Progression - From date of registration to date of progressive 
disease. 
 
11.3   Duration of Response - Time from documentation of complete or partial response 
to documentation of disease progression. 
 
11.4   Time to Death - From date of registration to date of death.

ERCC-1 CRC study 19 12.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS  
 
The main objective of the study is to determine extent of up regulation in the ERCC-1 gene 
expression on exposure to oxaliplatin in vivo .  Specifically, in comparing PBMC with pre and 
post exposure to oxaliplatin (end of infusion – 2 hour sample), we hypothesize that ERCC-1 
e
xpression will be significantly increased after exposure.  The baseline expression is relative to a 
standard protein, beta actin, and has been found to be 50%.  Samples will be analyzed for ERCC-
1 protein relative to beta-actin.  A level of < 50% will be coded as negative (-), and that of > 50% 
will be coded as positive (+).  A sample size of 40 pairs of observations (pre and post exposure) 
will give us 80% power to detect an odds ratio of 3.0 using a one-sided McNemar test with an 
alpha level of 0.025.  This odds ratio is equivalent to a difference between paired proportions of 
0.41 which assumes the proportion of samples with (+,-) pattern to be 0.20 and the proportion of 
(-,+)pattern to be 0.61.  The proportion of discordant pairs is assumed to be 0.81.  The study will 
accrue upto 80  patients to ensure enough yield for the 40 pairs of observations.   
 
Comparison of before and after treatment ERCC-1 expression level will be compared using 
McNemar test. Response rate will be summarized as percentage with associated 95% exact 
confidence intervals. Time- to-event outcomes will be summarized using KM estimator as 
appropriate. Other continuous outcomes will be summarized using descriptive summaries such as 
mean, median, inter-quartile range, as appropriate.

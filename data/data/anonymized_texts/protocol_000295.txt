Up to 3 sites
Study Period and Phase of Developm ent
The total study duration from the first subject enrolled to the last subject’s last visit/ last assessment will be 
approximately 17 weeks. This is a Phase 1 study.
ObjectivesPrimary Objective
The primary objective is to assess the effect of severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of 
lemborexant after a single dose administration.
Secondary Objectives
•To assess the effect of severe renal impairment on the PK of the unbound fraction of lemborexant.
•To assess the effect of severe renal impairment on the PK of metabolites (M4, M9, and M10) of 
lemborexant.
•To assess the safety and tolerability of lemborexant in subjects with norm al renal function or with severe 
impaired renal function.
Study DesignThis is a multicenter, single dose, open -label, parallel -group study in subjects with severe renal impairment 
andmatched (with regard to age [±10years], race, sex, and body mass index [BMI, ± 20%]) healthy control 
subjects.  The study will be conducted in 2 phases: Prerandomization Phase (containing the Screening Period 
and Baseline Period [Day -1]) and a Treatment Phase. The Screening Period will last up to 20 days, the 
Baseline Period will be 1 day, and the Treatment Period will be 11 days.  Subjects will remain in the clinic 
until approximately 7 days after dosing (will be discharged from clinic after the Day 8 PK blood draw ) and 
will return on Day 11 for end -of-study assessments/study discharge. 
Subjects will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups: Subjects with severe renal impairment will be Group 1, and 
subjects with norm al renal function demographically matched to subjects with severe impairm ent will be 
Group 2.  The number of subjects per group and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values used to 
assign each subject to a ren al function group are shown in the table below .

FINAL (V.2.0):02Apr2018Confidential Page 4of 64a:  Day -1 estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will determine the renal category group to which a 
subject is assigned. If the Day -1 eGFR value places the subject into a different renal category group from 
that calculated at screening, the value can be repeated once within 24 to 48 hours.  If eGFR variability 
across these scheduled and repeat time points indicates the subject does not consi stently meet the criteria 
for one renal category group, subject enrollment into a renal category group will be at the discretion of the 
Medical Monitor and investigator, in consultation with the sponsor.
The eGFR is determined by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula: (revised per 
Amendment 01)
eGFR (mL/min/1.73m2) = 175 x (serum creatinine)-1.154 x (age)-0.203 x (0.742 if female) x 
(1.212 ifAfrican American)
Group 1 subjects (severe renal impairment) will be enrolled first.  Group 2 subjects (normal renal function) 
will be matched according to age, race, sex, and BMI.
Subjects determined eligible for study participation will receive a single 10 mg oral dose of lemborexant on 
Day 1.  During the Treatment Period, plasma will be obtained over 11 days for the determination of 
lemborexant and metabolite concentrations M4, M9 and M10.  Standard safety assessments will be measured 
before, during, and at the conclusion of the study. 
Adjudication Committee (revised per Amendment 01)
An independent Adjudication Committee will be employed at intervals to review, in a blinded manner, AEs that 
could potentially be considered cataplexy or seizure. A set of preferred terms constituting a customized Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) query for cataplexy or seizure will be used toidentify events 
for adjudication (including cataplexy, muscle fatigue, muscular weakness, muscle tone disorder, hypotonia, 
drop attacks, slurred speech, diplopia, falls, convulsions [standardized MedD RA query (SMQ) narrow and 
broad], atypical migraine, loss of consciousness, decreased consciousness, myoclonus, syncope, transient global 
amnesia, lipothymia, [faintness] and transient ischemic attack). To assist in thepreparation of narratives about 
such events and to support the committee’s adjudication process, investigators and site staff will be instructed to 
query subjects who report any of the above events for supplemental information using a questionnaire for events 
potentially related to cataplexy and the serious adverse event (SAE) form for any of the above events considered 
serious.
Number of Subjects
A total of at least 16 subjects will be enrolled in each of the following 2 cohorts:
Group 1:  8 subjects w ith severe renal impairment
Group 2:  At least 8 healthy subjects (control) matched to subjects in Group 1

Assessments
Efficacy Assessments
Not applicable.
Pharm acokinetic Assessments
Blood samples (4 mL each) for PK assessments of lemborexant and its metabolites (M4, M9, and M10) w ill be 
collected at predose (0 hour), 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 and 240 hours 
postdose.  In addition, blood samples for protein binding (12 mL per time point) of lemborexant will be 
collected at 1 and 24 hours postdose matching the PK sample collection at those time points.
Safety Assessments
Safety will be assessed by monitoring and documenting adverse events (AEs), ECGs, vital signs, physical 
examinations, and clinical laboratory tests (urinalysis, hematology , and blood chemistry).
Bioanalytical MethodsTotal plasma concentrations of lemborexant and its metabolites (M4, M9, and M10) will be measured by 
validated liquid chrom atography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods.  The unbound 
concentrations of lemborexant will also be measured using a similar validated LC-MS/MS method follow ing
equilibrium dialysis.
Statistical Methods
Study Endpoints
The endpoints include the follow ing PK param eters derived by non-compartmental analysis using the plasma 
concentration -time data of lemborexant and its metabolites:
Cmax Maximum drug concentration
tmax Time to reach maximum drug concentration
AUC (0-t) Area under plasma concentration vs. time curve from time = 0 to time of last 
quantifiable concentration

The Cmax, AUC (0-t), and AUC (0-inf) of lemborexant will be the primary PK endpoints.  The rest of the 
parameters, including the PK parameters of the metabolites, will be secondary endpoints.
Analysis Sets
The Safety Analysis Set is the group of subjects who dosed with the test drug and had at least 1postdose 
safety assessment.
The Pharmacokinetic Analysis Set is the group of subjects who had sufficient PK data to derive at least 1PK 
parameter.
Efficacy Analyses
Not applicable.
Pharm acokinetic, Pharm acodynamic, Pharm acogenomic, and Other Biom arker Analyses
Pharm acokinetic Analyses
The Safety Analysis Set will be used for individual plasma concentration listings.  The PK Analysis Set will 
be used for summaries of plasma concentrat ions and for analyses, summaries, and listings of PK parameters.
The effect of renal impairment on the PK of lemborexant will be assessed using a linear model with renal 
impairm ent group as a factor.  Logarithmically transformed values of the primary PK parameters Cmax, 
AUC (0-t), and AUC (0-inf) will be utilized to estimate the geometric mean ratio (and two-sided 90% confidence 
intervals) of subjects with severe renal impairm ent versus subjects with normal renal function.  Similar 
statistical analyses will be conducted for the PK parameters of the metabolites and unbound lemborexant. 
Protein binding will be measured for metabolites without any derivation of PK parameters.  In addition, 
summary statistics for PK parameters in each renal function group w ill be tabulated.
If the 90% confidence intervals indicate that there is an effect of renal impairm ent on the primary PK 
parameters, relationships between the individual subject PK parameters (Cmax, AUC (0-t), AUC (0-inf), and CL/F, 
both free and total) and individ ual subject estimated renal function (eGFR estimated by the MDRD ) will be 
explored utilizing linear regression models with log-transformed PK parameters as the dependent variable and 
estimated renal function as the independent variable (revised per Amendment 01).  Point estimates and 95% 
CIs of the intercept and slope will be presented.  The relationship betw een each of the PK parameters and the 
estimated renal function will be also presented graphically.Safety Analyses
An evaluation of safety will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set.  Safety data that will be evaluated 
include AEs, clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and ECGs.
Treatment- emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized for each group.  Descriptive summary 
statistics (eg, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, maximum for continuous variables, and 
number and percentage for categorical variables) including shift tables of the laboratory and vital signs data.  
Changes from baseline for the clinical laboratory, vital signs, and ECG parameters will be evaluated for 
subjects with renal impairment and healthy controls by time point.

Pharm acokinetics in Patients with Renal Impairm ent, and should provide estimates to assess whether dose 
adjustment is required for subjects with renal impairment. 
Based on data from single dose studies of the 10 mg tablet (E2006 -A001 -004, E2006 -A001 -005, and 
E2006- A001 -008), the pooled betw een-subject standard deviation of logarithmically transformed AUC (0-inf)
values of  lemborexant is 0.391.  With a sample size of 8 subjects with severe renal im pairm entand 8 m atched 
controlsand 8 matched controls, the 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) for the geometric mean ratio for 
AUC (0-inf) would extend from 0.72 to 1.38 (for a mean ratio of 1.0).  Similar precision is expected for the 
2-sided 90% CI for the ratio for AUC (0-t).

provided evidence ofefficacy  at safe and well-tolerated doses. 
7.1.1 Lemborexant
The proposed study  is an open -label, parallel- group study  to evaluate the PK of lemborexant 
and its metabolites in subjects with normal renal function or with severe renal impairment.
7.1.1.1 Therapeutic Pathway
Lemborexant (E2006), a dual orexin receptor antagonist, is an Eisai in-house discovered and 
developed small molecule which inhibits orexin by binding competitively  to two subty pes of 
orexin receptors (or exin receptor 1 and 2). In individuals with insomnia, it is possible that the 
orexin system, which regulates sleep and wakefulness, is not functioning normall y. During 
normal periods of sleep, orexin system activity  is suppressed, suggesting it is possible to 
purposefull y counteract inappropriate wakefulness and facilitate the initiation and 
maintenance of sleep b y interfering with orexin neurotransmission. 
7.1.1.2 Clinical Experience W ith Lemborexant
To date, a total of 9 Phase 1 studies have been completed, with health y subjects treated with 
either single or multiple once daily  doses for 14 days, and subjects with insomnia disorder 
who were administered single doses of lemborexant.  In addition, a Phase 2 dose-finding 
study  in adult and elderly  subjects with insomnia disorder demonstrated efficacy  and safet y 
over a dose range from 1 mg to 25 mg to enable lemborexant to proceed into Phase 3 studies.  
Relevant to the currently  proposed study , the tolerability  data from the first human study  
suggest that single doses up to 200 mg have been generall y well tolerated in healthy  adult 
subjects.
Following single oral dose administration, lemborexant generally  exhibited linear PK within 
the dose range studied (1 mg to 200 mg), but at doses of 50 mg and above, the increase i n the 
maximum drug concentration (Cmax)was less than dose proportional.  Lemborexant exhibits 
approximate dose proportional (based on C maxand the area under the plasma concentration 
versus time curve [AUC ]) PK at steady  state on Day 14 following multiple dose 
administrations between 2.5 mg and 75 mg of lemborexant administered once daily .  Oral 
absorption of lemborexant was rapid with peak plasma concent ration around 1 to 3hours 
postdose. The terminal half-life was ~45 to 55 hours over a comparable dose range 
following single and multiple dose administration of lemborexant.  Accumulation of 
lemborexant following multiple dosing was lower than predicted by terminal half-life, with 
mean Cmax ranging from 1.21 to2.39 and an area under the concentration -time curve from 
zero time to 96 hours postdose ( AUC [0-96h]) of 1.67 to 3.26 over the dose range.  Based on the 
overall accumulation, the effective half-life of lemborexan t ranged from 16.9 to 39.3 hours
over the dose range.  Exposure (AUC (0-96h))of the main metabolites relative to lemborexant 
was 19.9% to 57.5% following multiple dosing at 25 mg for 14 days. Additionally  the 
lemborexant plasma concentration- time profiles were similar between healthy  volunteers 
admi nistered lemborexant in the morning compared to otherwise healthy  subjects with

dosing does not affect the PK. Mean plasma protein binding evaluated is 88.8% across the 
concentrations studied and exhibited no appreciable concentration dependence.
Results from the radiolabeled 14C-human mass balance study  indicate that E2006 is 
extensively  metabolized since less than 13% of the administered dose was recovered 
unchanged in feces only; urinary  excretion of unchanged E2006 was negligible.  The 
proposed metabolic pathway s of E2006 involve primarily  oxidation of dimethy lpyrimidine 
moiety  of E2006 to the M4, M9, and M10 metabolites. Less than 2% of the drug was 
excreted unchanged in the single ascending dose study .
7.2 Stud y Rationale
This study  is designed to evaluate the PK of lemborexant in subjects with renal impairment, 
since a subset of the target population in insomnia may have some degree of renal 
impairment and presence of comorbidities.  Subjects with impaired renal function may 
display  altered PK because of inhibition of this and other pathway s including hepatic and gut 
metabolism and transport ,even if the drug is not predom inantly  eliminated via the renal 
pathway . 
Pharmacokinetic studies in patients with impaired renal function are recommended by global 
regulatory  agencies for investigational products that are intended for chronic use and are 
substantially  eliminated renall y (ie, if the fraction of dose excreted unchanged in the urine is 
at least 30%) .Renal impairment studies are also recomm ended for investigational products 
which are detected in the bile, as renal impairment can inhibit some pathway s of hepatic and 
gut drug metabolism and transport.  The standard or full design of renal function studies is to 
include subjects with varying degrees of renal impairment, including mild, moderate and 
severe impairment, with corresponding matched healthy  subjects.  If renal elimination 
(excretion and renal metabolism) is a minor route of elimination of the drug, then a reduced 
study  design which includes only severe impairment and matched healthy  subjects is 
warranted for consideration.
Lemborexant is eliminated to a minor extent in the urine. The data from single ascending 
dose (SAD) studies show urinary  clearance component is negligible (≤2.6%) .  Additionally , 
data from a human mass balance study  supports that renal elimination is a minor pathway , as
only 26% of the total dose-related radioactivity  was recovered in urine.   None of the 
metabolites exceed 5% of the total administered dose eliminated in the urine.  Overall, these 
results indicate that a full PK study  design as outlined by United States Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency  (EMA) guida nces ( FDA, 2010; 
EMA, 2004) on studies with subjects with renal impairment is not warranted, and a reduced 
design can be applied. Therefore, the proposed study  will assess the effect of lemborexant only in subjects with 
severe renal function and demographically  matched healthy  subjects.  Ongoing Phase 3 
studies allow inclusion of moderate and mild subjects with renal impairment.  This study  will 
not examine the effect of end stage renal disease (ESRD) on lemborexant PK.  ESRD
subjects would need to be studied with or without dialy sis.  Based on the properties of the

support dosing recommendations for lemborexant in subjects with varying degrees of renal 
impairment.

matched health y control subjects.  The study  will be conducted in 2 phases : 
Prerandomization Phase (containing the Screening Period and Baseline Period [Day  -1]) and 
a Treatment Phase. The Screening Period will last up to 20days, the Baseline Period will be 
1 day, and the Treatment Phase will be 11 days.  Subjects will remain in the clinic until 
approximately  7 days after dosing (will be discharged from clinic after the Day 8 PK blood 
draw) and will return to the clinic on Day  11 for end -of-study  assessments/study  discharge. 
Subjects will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups:  Subjects with severe renal impairment will be 
Group 1, and subjects with normal renal function demographicall y matched to subjects with 
severe impairment will be Group 2.  The number of subjects per group, and estimated 
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values used to assign each subject to a renal function group, 
are shown in Table 1.

a:  Day -1 estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will determine the renal category group to which a 
subject is assigned. If the Day -1 eGFR value places the subject into a different renal category group from that 
calculated at screening, the value can be repeated once within 24 to 48 hours.  If eGFR variability across these 
scheduled and repeat time points indicates the subject does not consi stently meet the criteria for one renal 
category group, subject enrollment into a renal category group will be at the discretion of the Medical Monitor 
and investigator, in consultation with the sponsor.
The eGFR is d etermined by  the Modification of Diet i n Renal Disease (MDRD) formula:

Group 1 subjects (severe renal impairment) will be enrolled first. Group 2 subjects (normal 
renal function) will be matched according to age (± 10 y ears), race, sex, and body  mass index 
(BMI; ± 20%).
Subjects determined eligible for study  participation will receive a single 10 mg oral dose of 
lemborexant on Day 1.  During the Treatm ent Period, blood (plasma) samples will be 
obtained over 11 days for the determination of lemborexant and metabolite concentrations 
M4, M9, and M10.  Standard safety  assessments will be measured before, during, and at the

The Treatment Phase will consist of 1 study  period of 11 days.  The Treatment Phase
assessments and timing thereof are shown in Section 9.5.2.
9.2 Discussion of Study  Design, Including Choice of Control Groups
9.2.1 Study Design
This single dose, parallel- group study  aims to investigate the effects of severe renal 
impairment on the PK of lemborexant and its main metabolites ( M4, M9, and M10).  
Sixteen (16) subjects will be enrolled, and 8of these subjects will have severe renal 
impairment .  The other 8 subjects will be healthy  and will serve as thecontrol group . 
Health y subjects will be matched (1:1) with thesevere renal impairment subjects according 
toage (± 10years), race, sex, and BMI (± 20%) .  
The data from this study  would help guide specific dosing recommendations in insomnia 
disorder and ISWRD patients with impaired renal function and establish labeling 
recommendations for this new chemical entity .
9.2.2 Adjudication Committee (revised per Amendment 01)
An independent Adjudication Committee will be employ ed at intervals to review, in a
blinded manner, AEs that could potentially  be considered cataplex y or seizure. A set of 
preferred terms constituting a customized Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA) query  for cataplex y or seizure will be used to identify  events for adjudication 
(including cataplexy , muscle fatigue, muscular weakness, muscle tone disorder, hypotonia, 
drop attacks, slurred speech, diplopia, falls, convulsions [standardized MedDRA query 
(SMQ) narrow and broad], atypical migraine, loss of consciousness, decreased 
consciousness, myoclonus, syncope, transient global amnesia, lipothy mia, [faintness] and 
transient ischemic attack). To assist in the preparation of narratives about such events and to 
support the committee’s adju dication process, investigators and site staff will be instru cted to 
query  subjects who report any of the above events for supplemental information using a 
questionnaire for events potentially  related to cataplex y and the serious adverse event (SAE) 
form for an y of the a bove events considered serious.
9.3 Selection of S tudy  Population
A total of at least 16 subjects will be enrolled in each of the following 2 groups :
Group 1: 8 subjects with severe renal impairment
Group 2: At least 8 healthy  subjects (control) matched to subjects in Group 1

clinical test (eg, ECG or x-ray) that results in symptoms, a change in treatment, or 
discontinuation of study  drug
•Recurrence of an intermittent medical condition (eg, headache) not present pretreatment 
(Baseline)
•An abnormal laboratory  test result should be considered an AE if the identified laboratory  
abnormality  leads to any type of intervention, withdrawal of study  drug, or withholding 
of study  drug, whether prescribed in the protocol or not.
All AEs observed during the study  will be reported on the CRF.  All AEs, regardless of 
relationship to study  drug or procedure, should be collected beginning from the time the 
subject signs the study  ICF through the last visit in the Treatment Phase and for 28days after 
thesubject’s last dose.  Serious AEs will also be collected for 28 day s after the last dos e.
Abnormal laboratory  values should not be listed as separate AEs if they are considered to be 
part of the clinical syndrome that is being reported as an AE.  It is the responsibility  of the 
investigator to review all laboratory  findings in all subjects and determine if they constitute 
an AE.  Medical and scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether an isolated 
laboratory  abnormality should be classified as an AE.  Any laboratory  abnormality 
considered to constitute an AE should be reported on the Adverse Event CRF.
All AEs must be followed for 28 daysafter the subject’s last dose, or until resolution, 
whichever comes first.  All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely , 
to stabilization.
Every effort must be made by the investigator to categorize each AE according to its 
severity and its relationship to the study treatment.
Assessing Severity of A dverse Events
AEs will be graded on a 3-point scale (mild, moderate, severe) and reported in the detail 
indicated on the CRF.  The definitions are as follows:

Moderate Discomfort sufficient to reduce or affect normal dail y activit y
Severe Incapacitating, with inability to work or to perform normal daily  activity
The criteria for assessing severity  are different than those used for seriousness (see
Section 9.5.1.5.2 for the definition of an SAE).
Assessing Relationship to Study Treatment
Items to be considered when assessing the relationship of an AE to the study treatment are:
•Temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study  treatment
•The course of the event, especially  the effect of discontinuation of study  treatment or 
reintroduction of stud y treatment, as applicable
•Whether the event is known to be associated with the study  treatment or with other 
similar treatments
•The presence of risk factors in the study  subject known to increase the occurrence of the 
event
•The presence of nonstudy , treatment -related factors that are known to be associated with 
the occurrence of the event
Classific ation of Causality
The relationship of each AE to the study  drug will be recorded on the CRF in response to the 
following question:
Is there a reasonable possibility  that the study  drug caused the AE?
Yes (related) A causal relationship between the study  drug and the AE is a reasonable 
possibility .
No (not related) A causal relationship between the study  drug and the AE is not a 
reasonable possibility .
9.5.1.5.2 SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS AND EVENTS ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIAL SITUATIONS
A serious adverse event (SAE) is any untoward medical occurrence that at any  dose:
•Results in death
•Is life-threatening (ie, the subject was at immediate risk of death from the adverse event 
as it occurred; this does not include an event that, had it occurred in a more severe form 
or was all owed to continue, might have caused death)
•Requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization
•Results in persistent or significant disability /incapacity

Other important medical events that may not be immediately  life-threatening or result in 
death or hospitalization but, when based on appropriate medical judgment, may jeopardize 
the subject or may require intervention to prevent oneof the outcomes in the definition of 
SAE listed above should also be considered SAEs.  Medical and scientific judgment should 
be exercised in deciding whether expedited reporting is appropriate in such situations. 
In addition to the above, events associated with special situations include pregnancy  or 
exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding; AEs associated with study  drug overdose, 
misuse, abuse, or medication error.  These events associated with special situations are to be 
captured using the SAE procedures but are to be considered as SAEs onl y if they  meet one of 
the above criteria.  All AEs associated with special situations are to be reported on the CRF 
whether or not they meet the criteria for SAEs.  All SAEs must be followed to re solution or, if resolution is unlikely , to stabilization.
The following hospitalizations are not considered to be SAEs because there is no “adverse 
event” ( ie, there is no untoward medical occurrence) associated with the hospitalization:
•Hospitalizations f or respite care 
•Planned hospitalizations required b y the protocol
•Hospitalization planned before informed consent (where the condition requiring the 
hospitalization has not changed post study  drug administration)
•Hospitalization for administration of study drug or insertion of access for administration 
of study  drug
•Hospitalization for routine maintenance of a device (eg, battery  replacement) that was in 
place before stud y entry
If possible, a blood sample for PK analy sis should be drawn at the first report of an SAE or a 
severe unexpected AE and at its resolution.
9.5.1.5.3 LABORATORY MEASUREMENTS
Clinical laboratory  tests to be performed, including hematology , chemistry , and urinaly sis, 
are summarized inTable 2.  Subjects should be in a seated or supine position during blood 
collection and are to be fasting for at least 4 hours before blood is drawn for clinical 
laboratory  measurements.  The Schedule of Procedures/Assessments (Table 3)shows the 
visits and time points at which blood for clinical laboratory  tests and urine for urinal ysis will 
be collected in the study .

Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified laboratory . All blood and urine samples will be 
collected and sent to the central laboratory  on the day of collection unless otherwise 
instructed.
A laboratory  abnormality  may meet the criteria to qualify  as an AE as described in this 
protocol (seeSection 9.5.1.5.1) and the CRF Completion Guidelines.  In these instances, the 
AE corresponding to the laboratory abnormality  will be recorded on the Adverse Event CRF.
9.5.1.5.4 VITAL SIGNS AND WEIGHT MEASUREMENTS
Vital sign measurements ( ie, systolic and diastolic blood pressure [BP] [mmHg], pulse [beats 
per minute], respiratory  rate [per minute], body  temperature [in centig rade]), and weight (kg) 
will be obtained as designated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments (Table 3) by a 
validated method.  Blood pressure and pulse will be measured after the subject has been in 
supine position for 5 minutes.  All BP measu rements should be performed on the same arm, 
preferabl y by the same person.
When vital signs are to be obtained concurrently  with PK or other blood samples, the vital 
sign measurements will be performed prior to drawing blood samples in order to maximize 
the accuracy  of blood sampling times while minimizing the potential effects of blood 
drawing on recordings obtained during safet y assessments.

All SER IOUS ADVERSE EVENTS, regardless of their relationship to study  treatment, must 
be reported on a completed SAE form by email or fax as soon as possible but no later than 
24hours from the date the investigator becomes aware of the event.
Serious adverse events, regardless of causalit y assessment, must be collected through the last 
visit in the Treatment Phase and for 28 days after the subject’s last dose (revised per 
Amendment 01).  All SAEs must be followed to resolution or, if resolution is unlikely , to 
stabilization.  Any SAE judged by the investigator to be related to the study treatment or any 
protocol -required procedure should be reported to the sponsor regardless of the length of 
time that has passed since study  completion.
The detailed contact information for reporting of SAEs is provided in the Investigator 
Study File.
For urgent safety issues call: (24/7 number). 
For urgent safety issues, please ensure all appropriate medical care is administered to the 
subject and contact the appropriate study  team member listed in the I nvestigator Study  File.
It is very important that the SAE report form be filled out as completel y as possible at the 
time of the initial report.  This includes the investigator’s assessment of causality .
Any follow -up information received on SAEs should be forwarded within 24hours of its 
receipt.  If the follow -up information changes the investigator’s assessment of causality , this 
should also be noted on the follow -up SAE form.
Preliminary  SAE reports should be followed as soon as possible by detailed descriptions 
including copies of hospital case reports, autops y reports, and other documents requested by 
the sponsor.
The investigator must notify  his/her IRB/IEC of the occurrence of the SAE, in writing, if 
required b y their institution.  A cop y of this communication mu st be forwarded to the sponsor 
to be filed in the sponsor’s Trial Master File.

the last visit or within 28 days of last study  treatment or any exposure to study  drug through 
breastfeeding during study  treatment or within 28days of last study  treatment must be 
reported .
If an adverse outcome of a pregnancy  is suspected to be related to study  drug exposure, this 
should be reported regardless of the length of time that has passed since the exposure to study 
treatment.
A congenital anomal y, death during perinatal period, an induced abortion, or a spontaneous 
abortion are considered to be an SAE and should be reported in the same time frame and in 
the same format as all other SA Es (seeSection 9.5.4.1 ).
Pregnancies or exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding must be reported by fax or 
email as soon as possible but no later than 24hours from the date the investigator becomes 
aware of the pregnancy.  The contact information for the reporting of pregnancies and 
exposure to study  drug through breastfeeding is provided in the Investigator Study  File.  The

be noted as nonserious on the SAE form and the Adverse Event CRF.
9.5.4.4 Expedited Reporting
The sponsor must inform investigator and regulatory  authorities of reportable event s, in 
compliance with applicable regulatory  requirements, on an expedited basis ( ie, within 
specific time frames).  For this reason, it is imperative that sites provide complete SAE 
information in the manner described above.

guidance.  The format of these rep orts will be dictated by  local and regional requirements.
9.5.5 Completion/Discontinuation of Subjects
The investigator may withdraw the subject from the study  at any time for safet y or 
administrative reasons.  A subject may elect to discontinue the study  at anytime for any 
reason.  All subjects who discontinue the study  are to complete the study ’s early 
discontinuation procedures indicated in the Schedule of Procedures/Assessments (Table 3).
The investigator will promptly  explain to the subject involved that the study  will be 
discontinued for that subject and provide appropriate medical treatment and other necessary 
measures for the subject.  A subject who has ceased to return for visits will be followed up by  
mail, phone, or other means to gather information such as the reason for failure to return, the 
status of treatment compliance, the presence or absence of AEs, and clinical courses of signs 
and sy mptoms.
Subjects who discontinue early from the study will be discontinued for 1 of these primary 
reasons: AE(s), lost to follow -up, subject choice, withdrawal of consent, pregnancy , study  
terminated by  sponsor, or other.  In addition to t he primary  reason, the subject may  indicate 1 
or more of secondary  reasons for discontinuation.  Study disposition information will be 
collected on the Subject Disposition CRF.

This study  will be organized, performed, and reported in compliance with the protocol, 
SOPs, working practice documents, and applicable regulations and guidelines.  Site audits 
may be made periodically  by the sponsor’s or the CRO’s qualified compliance auditing team, 
which is an independent function from the stud y team responsible for conduct of the study .  
9.6.1 Data Collection
Data required by the protocol will be collected on the CRFs and entered into a validated data 
management system that is compliant with all regulatory  requirements.  As defined by ICH 
guidelines, the CRF is a printed, optical, or electronic document designed to record all of the 
protocol -required information to be reported to the sponsor on each study  subject.
Data collection on the CRF must follow the instructions described in the CRF Completion 
Guidelines.  The investigator has ultimate responsibility  for the collection and reporting of all 
clinical data entered on the CRF .  The investigator or designee as identified on Form FDA

Demographic and other baseline characteristics for the safety  anal ysis set will be summarized 
for each treatment group using descriptive statistics.  Continuous demographic and baseline 
variables include age, weight, height, BMI, eGFR and CLcr; categorical variables include 
sex, ethnicity  and race.
9.7.1.5 Prior and Concomitant Therapy
All investigator terms for medications recorded in the CRF will be coded to an 11-digit code 
using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary  (WHO DD, March 2017), drug code.  
Prior medications will be defined as medications that stopped before the dose of study  drug.  
Any medication (including OTC medications) or therap y administered to the subject during 
the study  (starting at the date of informed consent) will be recorded on the Prior and
Concomitant Medication CRF or Non-Pharmacological Procedures CRF. All medications 
will be presented in subject data listings.

9.7.1.7.1 PHARMACOKINETIC ANALYSES
The Safety  Analysis Set will be used for individual plasma concentration listings.  The PK 
Analy sis Set will be used for summaries of plasma concentrations and for analyses, 
summaries, and listings of PK parameters.
The effect of renal impairment on the PK of lemborexant will be assessed using a linear 
model with renal impairment group as a factor.  Logarithmically  transformed values of the 
primary  PK parameters Cmax, AUC (0-t), and AUC (0-inf)will be utilized to estimate the 
geometric mean ratio (and two-sided 90% confidence intervals [CIs]) of subjects with severe 
renal impairment versus subjects with normal renal function.  Similar statistical analy ses will 
be conducted for the PK paramete rs of the metabolites and unbound lemborexant. Protein 
binding will be conducted for metabolites without any assessment of PK parameters.  In 
addition, summary  statistics for PK parameters in each renal function group will be tabulated.
If the 90% confidence intervals indicate that there is an effect of renal impairment on the 
primary  PK parameters, relationships between the individual subject PK parameters (Cmax, 
AUC(0 -t), AUC(0 -inf), and CL/F, both free and total) and individual subject estimated renal 
function (eGFR estimated by the MDRD) will be explored utilizing linear regression models 
with log-transformed PK parameters as the dependent variable and estimated renal function 
as the independent variable. (revised per Amendment 01) Point estimates and 95% CI s of the

9.7.1.8 Safety Analyses
An evaluation of safety  will be performed on the Safet y Anal ysis Set.  Safety  data that will 
be evaluated include AEs, clinical laboratory  results, vital signs, and ECGs.
Treatment -emergent adverse events (TEAEs) will be summarized for each group.  
Descriptive summary  statistics (eg, mean, standard deviation [SD], median, minimum, 
maximum for continuous variables, and number and percentage for categorical variables) 
including shift tables of the laboratory andvital signsdata.  Changes from baseline for the 
clinical laboratory , vital signs, and ECG parameters will be evaluated for subjects with renal 
impairment and healt hy controls by  time point.
9.7.1.8.1 EXTENT OF EXPOSURE
All subjects enrolled in the study  will receive a single 10 mg dose (1 ×10 mg lemborexant 
tablet) in the morning after an overnight fast.
9.7.1.8.2 ADVERSE EVENTS
The AE verbatim descriptions (investigator terms from the CRF) will be classified into 
standardized medical terminology  using the Medical Dictionary  for Regulatory  Activities 
(MedDRA).  Adverse events will be coded to the MedDRA (Version 20.1 or higher) lower 
level term (LLT) closest to the verbatim term.  The linked MedDRA preferred term (PT) and 
primary  system organ class (SOC) are also captured in the database.
A treatment -emergent adverse event (TEAE) is defined as an AE that emerges during 
treatment, having been absent at pretreatment (Baseline) or 
•Reemerges during treatment, having been present at pretreatment (Baseline) but stopped
before treatment, or 
•Worsens in severity  during treatment relative to the pretreatment state, when the AE is
continuous.
Only  those AEs that were treatment emergent will be included in summary tables.  All AEs, 
treatment emergent or otherwise, will be presented in subject data listings.
The TEAEs will be summarized by group.  The incidence of TEAEs will be reported as the 
number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs by SOC and PT.  A  subject will be counted 
only once within a SOC and PT, even if the subject experienced more than 1 TEAE within a

9.7.1.8.3 LABORATORY VALUES
Laboratory  results will be summarized using S ystème International (SI) units, as appropriate.  
For all quantitative parameters listed in Section 9.5.1.5.3, the actual value and the change 
from baseline to each postbaseline visit and to the end of treatment (defined as the last 
on-treatment value) will be summarized by visit and group using descriptive statistics.  
Qualitative parameters listed in Section9.5.1.5.3 will be summarized using frequencies 
(number and percentage of subjects), and changes from baseline to each postbaseline visit 
and toend of treatment will be reported using shift tables.  Percentages will be based on the 
number of subjects with both nonmissing baseline and relevant postbaseline results.
Laboratory  test results will be assigned a low/normal/high (LNH) classification according to 
whether the value was below (L), within (N), or above (H) the laboratory  parameter’s 
reference range.  Within-group comparisons for each laboratory  parameter will be based on 
3-by-3 tables (shift tables) that compare the baseline LNH classificati on to the LNH 
classification at each postbaseline visit and at the end of treatment.  Clinical laboratory  results post baseline will be evaluated for markedl y abnormal values.
Appendix 1,presents the Sponsor’s Grading for Laborat ory Values that will be used to 
identify  subjects with markedly  abnormal laboratory  values.

PROCEDURES)
Any change to the protocol requires a written protocol amendment or administrative change 
that must be approved by the sponsor before implementation.  Amendments specificall y 
affecting the safety  of subjects, the scope of the investigation, or the scientif ic quality  of the 
study  require additional approval by  the applicable I RBs/IECs.  These requirements should in 
no way  prevent any  immediate action from being taken by  the investigator, or by  the sponsor, 
in the interest of preserving the safety  of all subj ects included in the study .  If the investigator 
determines that an immediate change to or deviation from the protocol is necessary  for safety  
reasons to eliminate an immediate hazard to the subjects, the sponsor’s medical monitor and 
the IRB/IEC for the s ite must be notified immediately .  The sponsor must notify  the health or 
regulatory  authority as required per local regulations.
Protocol amendments that affect only administrative aspects of the study may not require 
submission to health or regulatory  authority  or the IRB/IEC, but the health or regulatory  
authority  and IRB/IEC should be kept informed of such changes as required by local 
regulations.  In these cases, the sponsor may be required to send a letter to the IRB/IEC and 
the Competent Authorities d etailing such changes.
11.1 Adherence to the Protocol
The investigator will conduct the study  in strict accordance with the protocol (refer to ICH 
E6, Section 4.5).
11.2 Monitoring Procedures
The sponsor’s/CRO’s CRA will maintain contact with the investigator and designated staff 
by telephone, letter, or email between study  visits.  Monitoring visits to each site will be 
conducted by the assigned CRA as described in the monitoring plan.  The investigator will 
allow the CRA to inspect the clinical, laboratory, and pharmacy  facilities to assure 
compliance with GCP and local regulatory  requirements.  The CRFs and subject’s 
corresponding original medical records (source documents) are to be fully available for 
review by the sponsor’s representatives at regular intervals. These reviews verify  adherence 
to study  protocol and data accuracy  in accordance with local regulations.  All records at the 
site are subject to inspection by  the local auditing agency  and IRB/IEC review.
In accordance with ICH E6, Section 1.52, source documents include, but are not limited to 
the following:
•Clinic, office, or hospital charts
•Copies or transcribed health care provider notes which have been certified for accuracy  
after production
•Recorded data from automated instruments such as IxRS, x-rays, and other imaging 
reports, (eg, sonograms, CT scans, magnetic resonance images, radioactive images,

11.3 Recording of Data
A CRF is required and must be completed for each subject by qualified and authorized 
personnel.  All data on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source document, except 
when a section of the CRF itself is used as source document.  Any c orrection to entries made 
on the CRF must be documented in a valid audit trail where the correction is dated, the 
individual making the correct is identified, the reason for the change is stated, and the 
original data are not obscured.  Only data required by the protocol for the purposes of the 
study  should be collected.
The investigator must sign each CRF.  The investigator will report the CRFs to the sponsor 
and retain a cop y of the CR Fs.
11.4 Identification of Source Data
All data to be recorded on the CRF must reflect the corresponding source documents .
11.5 Retention of Records
The circumstances of completion or termination of the study  notwithstanding, the 
investigator is responsible for retaining all study  documents, including but not limited to the 
protocol, copies of CRFs, the Investigator's Brochure, and regulatory  agency  registration 
documents (eg, Form FDA 1572, ICFs, and IRB/IEC correspondence).  The site should plan 
to retain study  documents, as directed by the sponsor, for at least 2 years after the last 
approval of a marketing application in an ICH region and until there are no pending or 
contemplated marketing applications in an ICH region or at least 3 years have elapsed since 
the formal discontinuation of clinical development of the investigational product.
It is requested that at the completion of the required retention period, or should the 
investigator retire or relocate, the investigator contact the sponsor, allowing the sponsor the 
option of permanentl y retaining the stud y records.

investigator (or a designated pharmacist) must maintain an accurate record of the shipment 
and dispensing of the study  drug in a drug accountability  ledger, a copy of which must be 
given to the sponsor at the end of the study .  An accurate record of the date and amount of 
study  drug dispensed to each subject must be available for inspection at any time.  The CRA 
will visit the site and review these documents along with all other study  conduct documents 
at appropriate intervals once study  drug has been received by  the site.
All drug supplies are to be used only for this study  and not for any other purpose.  The 
investigator (or site personnel) must not destroy  any drug labels or any partly  used or unused 
drug supply  before approval to do so by the sponsor.  At the conclusion of the study  and as 
appropriate during the study , the investigator (or a designated pharmacist) will return all used 
and unused drug containers, drug labels, and a copy  of the completed drug disposition form 
to the sponsor’s CRA or designee ,when approval is given by  the sponsor, the investigator (or 
a designated pharmacist) will destroy  supplies and containers at the site.

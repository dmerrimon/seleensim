Investigator:
Trial site(s): Multinational, multicenter trial in approximately 80 clinical sites across 
approximately 15 countries . Since this is an extension to Trial 1297.2, the actual 
number of sites and countries will be determined by the sites participating in Trial 
1297.2 that have patients eligible for Trial 1297.3.
Clinical phase: IIIb
Objective(s): The objective of this trial is to provide long -term safety, efficacy, 
pharmacokinetics ( PK),and immunogenicity data on BI 695501 administered via 
prefilled syringe in patients with RA who have completed T rial 1297.2.
Methodology: BI 695501 is a proposed biosimilar toadalimumab (Humira®). Humira h as 
received regulatory approval for RA in the United States (US), the European 
Union (EU) and many other countries.
This is an open -label trial of BI 695501 w ith a 48 -week tre atment period in 
patients with RAcontinuing to receive methotrexate (MTX) w ithin th e dose range 
of the 1297.2 trial for at least 12 w eeks. After Week 12, the MTX dose w ill be at 
the Investigator’s discretion .
Each patient who meets allthe inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria 
will self-administer 40 mg of BI 695501 ever y 2 weeks.
Thetrial is designed to generate data on long -term safety, efficacy, PK, and 
immunogenicity with BI 695501 in patients who have completed Trial 1297.2.  
This w ill include :
patients who were previously treated w ith BI 695501 in Trial 1297.2 for 
48weeks, 
patients who were previously treated w ith US-licensed Humira®for 24 weeks 
followed by BI 695501 for 24 weeks in Trial 1297.2 ,
patients who were previously treated w ith US-licensed Humira®in 
Trial1297 .2for 48 w eeks

PK Analysis
A population PK analysis with sparse blood sampling throughout the treatment 
period and at follow -up will be carried out to assess the PK of BI 695501. The PK 
analysis might involve combining data with data from other BI 695501 studies. If 
relevant, a relationship will be investigated betw een selected safety and efficacy 
parameters including the development of ADA/nADA.
Statistical m ethods: Descriptive statistics for safety, efficacy, and other endpoints will be provided . 
Analyses will be based on data obtained in the current 1297.3 trial, and 
comparisons will be made depending on the treatment assignment in Trial 1297.2. 
Theresults will also be analyzed overall, according to the single open -label 
treatment in 1297.3.

1. The Screening visit will be the Week 48 visit in Trial 1297.2 and the same visit window applies (±3 days). Informed consent for this extensio n trial must be obtained prior to 
conducting t he Week 48 assessments in Trial 1297.2, in order for those assessments to serve as the screening assessments in this extension trial. VAS assessments and 
completion of the HAQ-DI and SF -36 v2 questionnaires mus t be done prior to any visit procedures at this day. Patient questionnaires completed for the 1297.2 trial will be 
used as baseline questionnaires for the 1297.3 trial. Trial medication should be administered after completion of all assessments at the Scre ening visit; this will be the last 
administration of trial medication in Trial 1297.2.

2. The W eek 6, Week 1 8, Week 32, and Week 40 visits will be trial medication administration only visits , however the patient may choose to administer the trial medication at 
home and collect dispensed medication at a later date . At each visit, the Investigator/designee will dispense sufficient trial medication so that patients can continue to 
self-administer trial medication at home until the next site visit.
3. Patients who d iscontinue the trial early will, at discontinuation, have an End of Treatment (EoT) Visit equivalent to the Week 48 assessments ; patients who discontinue early 
will also return for a safety follow -up visit 10 weeks after the last dose of BI 695501. Every e ffort should be made for all patients who complete the total 48-week treatment 
period to return for a safety follow-up visit at Week 58. 
4. Patients will be assessed at screening if they are willing and able, per investigator judgment, to self -administer the trial medication.
5. Patients must have a negative tuberculosis ( TB)test, including a QuantiFERON TB Gold test. A TB test can be performed at any time during the trial if the Investigator
considers it clinically necessary.
6. Females only; a urine pregnancy te stwill be performed at Screening, on Day 1 (Baseline), and all subsequent visits (does not include trial medication only visits).
7. Includes measurement of blood pressure, respiratory rate and pulse rate (all sitting after 5 minutes rest). The patient’s bod y temperature will also be recorded. 
8. Findings of alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase >3 times the upper limit of normal or hemoglobin <8.0 g/dL at baseline are criteria for exclusion.
9. Two consecutive recordings need to be taken.
10. Adverse events will be collected from the time of informed consent. Adverse events continuing at the EoT Visit must be followed to resolution or follow up a s agreed by the 
Investigator and medical monitor. For patients who complete the trial or who discont inue the trial early, A Es will be captured for 10 weeks after the EoT visit. 
11. Questionnaires will be completed at the site by the patient before any investigations or discussions about their disease with the clinic staff.
12. Pharmacokinetic ( PK)and anti-drug antibody ( ADA )samples (including neutralizing ADA samples) should be taken at each visit designated with an “X”, and can be taken 
at any time during the visit (PK and ADA/neutralizing ADA sampl
es will be taken at the same time point). For all PK samples, the day and time of sampling must be 
accurately recorded. All dosing dates and times must be accurately entered in the patient diary. See also Table 5.4: 1 for PK sampling time points.
13. At the Screening visit, the administration of BI 695501 will be performed by a suitably qualified, designated trial personnel at the site and patients will be trained on 
self-administration. This will be the last administration of trial medication in Trial 1297.2.
14. The first dose of trial medication in the extension trial will be administered at the Baseline visit, which is approximately 2 weeks after the Screening visit (the Week 48 visit 
of Trial 1297.2). The patients will self -inject BI 695501 with the support of the suitably qualified, designated t rial personnel.
15. For all subsequent injections. Patients will self-inject the trial medication every 2 weeks until trial completion or early withdrawal.
16. 1 to 5 syringes will be dispensed to the patient at each visit.

1. INTRODUCTION
1.1 MEDICAL BACKGROUND
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic s ystemic inflammatory  disorder characterized b y 
synovial inflammation in the joints and consequently , progressive joint destruction. 
Depending on the severity  of the disease, s ystemic manifestations may  occur including lung, 
cardiovascular, hematologic and ocular effects. If left untreated, RA may  lead to severe 
functional disabilities, and therefore a considerable reducti on in qualit y of life for the patient 
(R11-4384 , R11 - 4383 ). The prevalence of RA varies with factors such as gender, race and 
smoking status and is approximately  0.5% to 1% ( R07-0637 ). 
The cy tokine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- alpha is involved in inflammatory  and immune 
responses. Elevated levels of TNF -alpha are found in the sy novial fluid of RA patients, 
including juvenile idiopathic arthritis and psoriatic arthritis patien ts and it has been 
demonstrated that TNF- alpha (hereafter also referred to as TNF) play s a crucial role in both 
the pathologic inflammation and the joint destruction characteristic of these diseases. Thus, 
TNF targeted therapy plays an important role in RA through a reduction in the TNF -mediated 
downstream effects on other cell t ypes involved in the inflammatory response.
There are five anti- TNF drugs that have been approved by  the United States (US) Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency  (EMA) to treat moderate to 
severe RA that has not responded to one or more of the traditional disease -modify ing 
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These currently approved therapies include: adalimumab, 
etanercept, infliximab, certolizumab pego l, and golimumab. Efficacy  has been demonstrated 
in all five therapies, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), by  greater American College 
of Rheumatology  20%/50%/70% (ACR20/50/70) responses, an improvement in Disease 
Activity  Score in 28joints (DAS28), less radiographic progression, and an improvement in 
quality  of life (Health Assessment Questionnaire –Disability  Index [HAQ -DI], 36-item Short 
Form Health Survey  version 2 [SF -36 v2]) ( R12-2515 ).
1.2 DRUG PROFILE
BI 695501 is a monoclonal antibody  being developed as a proposed biosimilar to the 
TNF -alpha blocker, adalimumab (US -licensed Humira®and EU -approved Humira®). 
Adalimumab is a recombinant human monoclonal immunoglobulin (Ig) G1 antibody  specific 
to human TNF -alpha. It has human- derived heavy  and light chain variable regions and human 
IgG1:k constant regions and is produced in a mammalian expression sy stem ( R15-
0739 and 
R15-3225 ).  
Humira®binds specifically  to TNF -alpha (and not TNF -beta) and blocks its interaction with 
the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. Humira®has also been shown to ly se cells 
expressing surface TNF in vitro in the presence of complement and modulate biological 
responses that are induced or regulated b y TNF, including changes in adhesion molecules 
responsible for leukocy te migration (endothelial leukocy te adhesion molecule -1, vascular cell 
adhesion molecule -1, and intercellular adhesion molecule -1) (R15-0739 ).

After subcutaneous (SC) administration of a single 40 mg dose in healthy  adult subjects, peak 
serum concentrations of Humira®are reached approximately  5 day s after administration. The 
average absolute bioavailability  of Humira®estimated from three studies following a single 
40mg SC dose was 64%. Following SC administration of 40 mg of Humira®every  second 
week in adult RA patients, the mean stead y-state trough concentrations were approximately  
5μg/mL  (without concomitant MTX) and 8 to 9 μg/mL  (with concom itant MTX), 
respectivel y. The serum Humira®trough levels at steady -state increased roughl y 
proportionally  with dose following 20, 40 and 80 mg SC dosing every  other week and every  
week ( R15-0739 andR15-3225 ).
Population pharmacokinetic (PPK) anal yses showed a trend toward higher apparent clearance 
of Humira®with increasing bod y weight. After adjustment for weight differences, gender and 
age appeared to have a minimal effect on Humira®clearance ( R15-0739and R15- 3225). 
Humira®was evaluated in over 3000 patients in all RA trials that were performed prior to 
approval, with some patients treated for up to 60 months duration. I n the EMA label, five 
randomized, double -blind and well -controlled studies were reported for Humira®, whi ch 
assessed the efficacy  and safet y of Humira®for the treatment of RA ( R15-
3225). 
In two of the five studies, long
-term administration of Humira®was evaluated; patients 
received Humira®for ≥52 weeks. 
In one study , 114 patients were enrolled to the open -label stud y and continued to receive 
Humira®40 mg every  other week for 60 months. Of these patients 86, 72 and 41 patients had 
ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 responses , respectively , at Month 60 ( R15-3225).
In a trial of 799 MTX -naïve, adult patients with mo
derate to severe active early RA, 42.9% of 
patients who received Humira®/MTX combination therapy  achieved clinical remission 
(DAS28 <2.6) at Week 52 compared to 20.6% and 23.4% of patients receiving MTX 
monotherap y and Humira®monotherapy , respectively . Humira®/MTX combination therapy  
was clinicall y and statistically superior to MTX (p<0.001) and Humira®monotherapy  
(p<0.001) in achieving a low disease state ( R15-0739 and R15-3225). 
In addition, it has been shown that individual components of the American College of 
Rheumatology  (ACR) response criteria (number of tender and swollen joints, phy sician and 
patient assessment of disease activity  and pain, and disability  index scores) improved at 24 or 
26 weeks compared to placebo ( R15-0739 and R15-
3225). 
Hum ira®treatment in RA patients has been associated with a decrease in levels of acute 
phase reactants of inflammation, C- reactive protein (CRP) and ery throcy te sedimentation rate 
(ESR), and serum cy tokines (interleukin
-6), compared to Baseline. Serum levels of the matrix 
metalloproteinases (MMP) -1 and MMP -3 that induce the tissue remodelling responsible for 
cartilage destruction were also decreased and patients experienced improvement in 
hematological signs of chronic inflammation after Humira®administration ( R15-3225).

In addition to the anal ytical and pharmacological assay s, the similarity  between BI 695501 
and US -licensed Humira®was assessed in a single -dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study  in the 
cynomolgus monkey  and a local tolerance stud y in rabbits. Addi tionally , the three -way PK 
similarity  between BI 695501, US -licensed Humira®and EU -approved Humira®was 
demonstrated in a Phase I clinical study  in healthy volunteers. The results of these studies are 
provided in the Investigator ’sBrochure (IB).

2. RATIONALE, OBJECTIVE S, AND BENEFIT - RISK 
ASSESSMENT
2.1 RATIONALE FOR PERFOR MING THE TRIAL
Adalimumab (Humira®) has received regulatory  approval for treatment of patients with RA in 
the US, the EU, and many other countries ( R15-0739 and R15-3225 ). BI 695501 is being 
developed as a proposed biosimilar to US- licens ed Humira®and EU -approved Humira®. 
This trial will be conducted in compliance with the Clinical Trial Protocol (CTP), the 
International Conference on Harmoni sation (ICH) guidelines, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
and with all applicable and current regulatory  requirements.
The rationale for conducting this trial is to generate long-term safet y, efficacy, and 
immunogenicit y data for the administration of the proposed biosimilar BI 695501 in patients 
with RA .This is a 1- year extension trial to Trial 1297.2, in which patient will have received 
48 weeks of treatment with US- licensed Humira®or BI 695501, or with US -licensed 
Humira®for 24 weeks then BI 695501 for 24 week s.
2.2 TRIAL OBJECTIVES
The objective of this trial is to provide long -term safet y,efficacy , PK, and immunogenicit y 
data on BI 695501 administered via prefilled sy ringe in patients with RA who have 
completed Trial 1297.2.
2.3 BENEFIT - RISK ASSESSMENT
Patient ris
k will be minimized in this trial by  implementing conservative eligibility  criteria. 
Due consideration has been given to previous experience with US -licensed Humira®and 
EU-approved Humira®in RA patients and side effect management advice (e.g., for 
hypersensitivity  reactions) is provided for in this CTP. All trial personnel are directed to the 
BI 695501 IB for a description of the non- clinical and clinical experience with BI 695501. To 
date, a total of 175healthy  male volunteers (includes data from Trial 1297.8 and 
Trial 1297.1) have received BI 695501. As of 01 July 2015, 465 patients were included in 
Trial 1297.2.
Representatives from Boehringer Ingelheim (BI)and 
 Safet y, Clinical and Qualit y 
functions will review accumulating safet y data at the monthly  Medical and Quality  Review 
Meeting . 
Given the progressive nature of the disease, each patient will receive active RA treatment 
throughout the trial. 
Patients will be carefull y monitored during ambulatory  (outpatient) visits fo rany safety signs 
and sy mptoms that may  occur or arise following trialtreatment. A dverse event s(AEs) , body  
temperature, vital signs, electrocardiograms ( ECGs
)and safet y laborator y assessments as

well as immunogenicit y data will be collected throughout the trial; therefore monitoring 
patients for safety  outcomes over a prolonged period of time will be possible. 
A potential for drug- induced liver injury  (DILI, a rare event) is under constant surveillance 
by sponsors and regulators. Therefore, timel y detecti on, evaluation, and follow -up of 
alterations of selected liver laboratory  parameters to ensure patients’ safet y will be performed 
in this trial (see Section 5.3.6 ). 
In addition, hy persensitivity  reactions, anaph ylaxis, and seriou s infections are considered 
adverse events of special interest (AESI), see Section 5. 3.6.
In patients treated with Humira®, common adverse reactions reported in greater than 10% of 
patients include infections (e.g. ,upper respiratory  tract infections, sin us infections), injection 
site reactions, headache and rash. Allergic reactions (e.g. ,allergic rash, anaphy lactic reaction, 
fixed drug reaction, non -
specified drug reaction, urticaria) have been observed in 
approximately  1% of patients ( R15-0739 and R15-3225 ).
Cases of hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation have been reported in patients receiving 
anti-TNF therap y. Some cases have been fatal, the majority of which were in patients 
concomitantly  receiving other immunosuppressive medications. Carriers of HBV and patients 
with a history  of HBV infection will be excluded from the trial.
Tuberculosis (TB) reactivation or new TB infections have been observed in patients receiving 
Humira®and other TNF -inhibitors, including patients who had previousl y received treatment 
for latent or active TB. Patients will be evaluated for TB risk factors and tested for laten t 
infection prior to and during the trial due to the increased risk of opportunistic infections with 
Humira®.
In the controlled portions of clinical trials of some TNF-inhibitors, including Humira®, more 
cases of malignancies have been observed among TNF -inhibitor -treated adult patients 
compared to control -treated adult patients. Therefore, the possible risk for the development of 
malignancies cannot be excluded. 
Further information regarding relevant contraindications, special precautions, adverse 
reactions and other recommendations for the use of US- licensed Humira®and EU -approved 
Humira®in RA patients are described in the prescribing information ( R15-0739 and 
R15-3225). 
BI 695501, as a proposed biosimilar product, is expected to provide comparable efficacy , 
safet y, tolerabilit y and immunogenicit y in patients with RA and therefore is expected to 
provide a similar benefit
-risk profile as US -licensed Humira®andEU-approved Humira®.  
An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) is monitoring the 1297.2 trial and an 
IDMC safet y review will be completed prior to the first patient’s enrolment in the extension 
trial.

3. DESCRIPTION OF DESIG N AND TRIAL POPULATI ON
3.1 OVERALL TRIAL DESIGN AND PLAN
This is an open -label trial of BI 695501 with a 48- week treatment period in patients with RA 
continuing to receive MTX within the dose range of the 1297.2 trial for at least 12 weeks. 
After Week 12, the MTX dose will be at the Investigator’s discretion .
The trial will consist of a Screening visit 14daysprior to Day  1, a 48 - week treatment period
and a 10 -week safet y follow -up visit . The Screening visit will be the Week 48 visit in 
Trial 1297.2. Informed consent for this exte nsion trial must be obtained prior to conducting 
the Week 48 assessments in Trial 1297.2, in order for those assessments to serve as the 
screening assessments in this extension trial. Trial medication should be administered after 
completion of all assessme
nts at the Screening visit ; this will be the last administration of 
trial medication in Trial 1297.2.
Patients who discontinue the trial medication early (and do not withdraw consent) should 
return to the site for an End of Treatment (EoT) visit equivalent to the Week 48 assessments 
as soon as possible after last trial medication administration. For patients who discontinue 
treatment early , a safet y follow -
up visit should be performed 10 weeks after the last 
administration of BI 695501. All patients who complete the trial should return for a safet y 
follow -up visit at Week 58.
It is anticipated that approximately  300 to 400 patients with moderatel y to severel y active RA 
who have completed Trial 1297.2 will be eligible and willing to participate in this extension 
trial. Each patient who provides informed consent and meets allthe inclusion criteria and
none of the exclusion criteria will self-administer 40 mg of BI 695501 every 2 weeks by SC 
injection .
Patients will undergo up to 10 visits over the duration of the trial (58 weeks). The trial
procedures to be undertaken at each visit are shown in the Flow Chart.
The primary  endpoint of this trial is defined as the number (proportion) of patients with 
drug-related AEs during the treatment phase. Efficacy  and other safet y parameters will be 
assessed as secondary  and other endpoints. For more details, see Section 5.1 . 
Up to Week 12, p atients will continue to take their regular MTX ther apy and the associated 
stable weekl y dose of adequate folic acid (at least 5 mg per week or as per local practice) or 
folinic acid (at least 1 mg per week or as per local practice) from their usual source. After 
Week 12, MTX therap y may be adjusted based o n Investigator assessment. Patients may  also 
continue to receive treatment with oral corticosteroids at a dose of ≤10 mg/day  prednisolone 
or equivalent.
Patients may  return for unscheduled visits should their medical condition warrant urgent 
attention at the discretion of the Investigator .

Investigator s at different centers participating in this multice ntertrial. Tasks and 
responsibilities will be defined in a contract. Relevant documentation on t he participating 
(Principal) I nvestigators and other important participants, including their curricula vitae, will 
be filed in the electronic trial master file.
3.2 DISCUSSION OF TRIAL DESIGN, INCLUDING TH E CHOICE OF 
CONTROL GROUP(S)
This is a long -term, open -label extension trial to assess the safet y, efficacy , PK, and 
immunogenicit y of BI 695501 in patients with RA who have completed T rial 1297.2 and are 
eligible for long -term treatment with adalimumab. The trial has a 48-week treatment period in 
patients with RA continuing to receive MTX within the dose range of the 1297.2 trial for at 
least 12 weeks. After Week 12, the MTX dose will be at the Investigator’s discretion . All 
patients will be treated with BI 695501. No comparator was chosen as the purpose of the trial
is to collect data on the long-term safety  (and efficacy ) and to better characterize PK and 
immunogenicit y of BI 695501. 
Each patient who meets allthe inclusion 
criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will
self-administer 40 mg of BI 695501 every  2 weeks. This is the same dosing regimen the 
patients received in Trial 1297.2. 
3.3 SELECTION OF TRIAL P OPULATION
A log of all patients enrolled into the trial (i.e.,who have signed informed consent) will be 
maintained in the I SF at the investigational site irrespective of whether they  have been treated 
with investigational drug or not.

exclusion criteria will not be enrolled in this extension trial. The primary  reason for the 
screen failure will be recorded on the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).
Patients have the right to withdraw from this trial at any  time for any  reason. 
Two situations can occur in this trial and need to be documented accor dingly , as follows:
1. An individual patient is to be withdrawn from the trial if:
The patient decides to discontinue participation in the trial by  withdrawal of consent. In 
this case, no more investigations will be performed. The patient does not have t o justify  
the decision.
2. Based on assessment b y the Investigator , and after consultation with the trial medical 
advisor, 
an individual patient may be discontinued from treatment with the investigational 
compound if:
The patient needs to take concomitant drugs that interfere with the investigational product 
or other trial medication
The patient can no longer be treated with trial medication for other medical reasons (such 
as surgery , adverse or drug -related events, other diseases, or pregnancy )
Repeated protocol violation after documented discussion with the medical monitor
Lack of efficacy  
The patient has an AE that is categorized as a serious infection . A serious infection is 
defined as infections requiring i.v. antibiotics or those that meet the regulatory  definition 
of a SAE (including, but not limited to
,systemic fungal infections, human 
immunodeficiency  virus [ HIV], HBV, HCV , infected joint prosthesis)

TREATMENT
4.2.1 Rescue medication, emergency procedures, and additional treatment(s)
Patients will continue to take their usual prescribed concomitant medications as allowed by  
the CTP, including MTX ( within the dos e range of the 1297.2 trial, up to Week 12) from their 
usual source. After Week 12, t he dosing regimen for MTX and associated folic acid or folinic 
acid intake may be adjusted 
at the Investigator ’s discretion. In this case, MTX treatment can 
be combined wi th or replaced b y other non -biologic DMARDs (as described in Table 4.2.2.1: 
1).Non-biologic DMARD therapy  may  be modified during the trial, per Investigator 
assessment .Certain side effects are commonly associated with MTX tre atment and therefore 
patients are required to take folic acid (a stable dose of at least 5 mg/week or as per local 
practice) or folinic acid (at least 1 mg/week or as per local practice), from their usual source, 
to minimize MTX -related toxicity . 
All patients should also continue to receive an y oral nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory  drugs 
(NSAIDs )at a stable dose or background oral corticosteroids as required throughout the trial. 
There are no special emergency  procedures to be followed.

5.2 ASSESSMENT OF EFFICA CY
The following assessme nts will be made at the time points indicated in the Flow Chartfor the 
purposes of calculating the DAS28 (ESR and CRP) and ACR response scores.
5.2.1 Joint assessments
Wherever possible, the same person will perform the joint assessment throughout the trial 
(i.e., for all patients at each trial site). Standardized training will be provided to the 
independent joint assessor via the training modules provided in the specific study  portal .This 
training will be documented and filed inthe ISF.
Each of the 66/68 joints will be evaluated for tenderness and swelling ,respectivel y (prior to 
taking an y required analgesic that day  if possible). The 66/68 joint count includes the 
metacarpophalangeal, proximal interphalangeal, and distal interphalang eal joints of the 
hands, the metatarsal phalangeal and distal interphalangeal joints of the feet, and the 
shoulder, elbow, wrist, hip, knee, ankle, tarsus, and temporomandibular, sternoclavicular, and 
acromio-clavicular joints. Artificial, missing, and ank ylosed joints, and data from joints 
following intra -articular injections are excluded from both tenderness and swelling 
assessments ( R11-4385 ).
5.2.2 Patient’s global assessment of disease activity VAS
Patients will mark on a visual an alogue scale (VAS) their overall assessment of how their RA 
affects them, rating how they  are managing from 0 (very  well) to 100 (very  poor). This is 
equivalent to the General Health component of the Disease Activity  Score (DAS) (see 
Appendix 10.2 ).

5.2.3 Patient’s assessment of pain
Patient’s assessment of pain will be assessed using the VAS provided in the HAQ -DI 
questionnaire (see Appendix 10.3 ).
5.2.4 Physician’s global assessment of disease activity VAS
The physician’s global disease assessment will be documented on a VAS, ranging from no 
arthritis activity  (0) to extremely  active arthritis (100) (see Appendix 10.2 ).
5.2.5 Patient’s assessment of disability
The phy sical function ingof the pa tient will be assessed using the HAQ- DI questionnaire. 
This is a widely  used patient self -report tool which assesses the degree of difficulty  a person 
has had in accomplishing tasks in eight functional areas, over the previous week, taking into 
account an y aids or help required. It consists of eight component sets: (1) dressing and 
grooming, (2) rising, (3) eating, (4) walking, (5) hygiene, (6) reach, (7) grip and (8) common 
daily  activities. I n addition ,patients will mark on a VAS the severit y of pain tha t they  have 
had because of their RA in the past week, ranging from 0 (no pain) to 100 (severe pain) (see 
Appendix 10.3 ).
5.2.6 SF-36 v2
Patients will complete the SF -36 v2, a generic health survey consisting of 36 questions, 
yielding eight health -related quality  of life domains (phy sical functioning, role -physical, 
bodily  pain, general health, vitality
, social function, role -emotional and mental health) as well 
as a ps ychometrically -based phy sical component score and mental component s core (see 
Appendix 10.4 ).
5.2.7 Systemic inflammation: CRP level and ESR
A blood sample for CRP and ESR assessments will be taken at the visits indicated in the 
Flow Chart. 
Analy sis of CRP will be conducted by  a sui tably qualified laboratory using validated 
methods. 
A whole blood sample (2 mL ) will be collected for the ESR values to be measured locall y.
5.2.8 Calculation of DAS28 and ACR scores
The DAS28 score will be derived using the following formulas:
DAS28 (ESR) = 0.56*√(TJC28) + 0.28*√(SJC28) + 0.014*(GH) + 0.7*ln(ESR) 
DAS28 (CRP) =  0.56*√(TJC28) + 0.28*√(SJC28) + 0.014*(GH) + 0.36*ln(CRP+1) + 0.96

Where:
TJC28 = 28 joint count for tenderness
SJC28 = 28 joint count for swelling
Ln(ESR) = natural logarithm of ESR
Ln(CRP) = natural logarithm of CRP
GH = the General Health component of the DAS (see Section 5.2.2 )
Improvement in DAS28 will also be categorized using the EULAR response criteria (see 
Table 5.1.2.8: 1).  
Table 5.1.2.8: 1 DAS28 EULAR response
DAS28 Improvement
DAS 28 at Endpoint ≥1.2 >0.6 and < 1.2 ≤0.6
≤3.2 Good Response Moderate response No Response
>3.2and ≤5.1 Moderate response Moderate response No Response
>5.1 Moderate response No Response No Response
Low disease activity  is defined as a DAS28 score of ≤3.2 and DAS28 remission is defined as 
a DAS28 score of <2.6. A clinically  relevant change in DAS28 score is defined as an 
improvement in DAS28 score of at least 1.2.
A patient has an ACR20 response if all of the following occur:
A ≥20% improvement in the SJC(66 joints)
A ≥20% improvement in the TJC (68 joints)
A ≥20% improvement in at least three of the following assessments:
oPatient’s assessment of pain
oPatient’s global assessment of dise ase activity
oPhysician’s global assessment of disease activity
oPatient’s assessment of phy sical function, as measured by  the HAQ -DI
oAcute phase reactant (CRP)
Patients will be considered to have had an ACR50 or ACR70 response if a 50% or 70% 
improvement from Baseline of Trial 1297.2, respectively , was observed in the criteria 
specified above for ACR20.

5.2.9 Definition of ACR/EULAR remission
Boolean -based definition:
At any  time point, the patient must satisfy  all of the following: 
TJC ≤1a
SJC ≤1a
CRP ≤1 mg/d L
Patient global assessment of disease activity  ≤10 (on a 0 to 100 scale) (see 
Appendix 10.2)
aFor TJC and SJC, use of a 28- joint count may  miss actively  involved joints, especiall y in the 
feet and ankles, and it is preferable to include feet and ankles also when evaluating remission.
5.3 ASSESSMENT OF S AFETY
5.3.1 Physical examination
A phy sical examination will be performed at the visits indicated in the Flow Chart.
Whenever possible, the same person should perform the physical examination throughout the 
trial (i.e. ,for all patients at each trial site). The phy sical examination will include assessment 
of general appearance, skin, head, neck, throat, lymph nodes, cardiovascular, neurological, 
thyroid, musculoskeletal/ex tremities, respiratory  and abdomen. Bod y weight will also be 
measured. Height will be measured at Screening only .
5.3.2 Vital Signs
Vital signs will be assessed at the visits indicated in the Flow Chart.
Blood pressure, respiratory  rate and pulse rate measurements should be taken following at 
least 5 minutes rest while the patient is in a sitting position. The patient’s body  temperature 
will also be recorded.
The Investigator must assess all vital signs findings at each visit. If the Invest igator finds an y 
clinically  relevant abnormalities, these must be reported as AEs/SAEs as appropriate (see 
Section 5.3.6 ).
5.3.3 S afety laboratory parameters
Blood and urine samples for determination of serum chemistry , hematology and ur inalysis 
will be taken at the times indicated in the Flow Chart.
The following laboratory parameters will be measured:
Serum chemistry : creatinine, alkaline phosphatase, AST, AL T, gamma glutamy l 
transpeptidase, bilirubin (total and direct), glucose, total cholesterol, total protein, 
albumin, sodium, potassium, chloride, calcium

Hematology : hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, white blood cells, ly mphocy tes, 
neutrophils
Urinaly sis: protein, glucose, blood
In addition, the following par ameters will be anal yzed at the visits indicated in the 
Flow Chart:
Infection screen: patients must have a negative serological test for hepatitis B surface 
antigen ( HBsAg ), for hepatitis C serology  
HIVscreen (at the discretion of th e Investigator where clinically  indicated , and per local 
regulations )
TB test (QuantiFERON®Gold assay )
ESR and CRP
Pregnancy  testing for females of child -bearing potential only  (serum human chorionic 
gonadotropin or urine)
ADAs and nADA s
Rheumatoid factor (RF) and anti -cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti -CCP) antibodies will be 
analyzed at Baseline (Day  1) and Week 48.
The Investigator must assess all laboratory  results. The Investigator will evaluate an y change 
in laboratory  values and all clinical laboratory  tests will be reviewed for potential clinical 
significance at all time points throughout the trial. The Investigator should endeavor to 
provide a reason for all results deemed not c linically  significant. If the Investigator
determines a laboratory  abnormality  to be clinically  significant, it will be considered an 
AE/SAE (see Section 5.3.6 );however, if the laboratory  value abnormality  is consistent with a 
current diagnosis, it will be documented accordingl y.
Blood samples will be analy zed by  a central laboratory  (except ESR). The central laboratory  
provider will also provide the materials for blood sampling. Instructions for the labelling, 
storage and shipmen t of the samples can be found in the L aboratory  Manual. Details of all 
blood variable units and reference ranges can be found in the L aboratory  Manual.
Pregnancy  testing will be performed by  a central laboratory  using serum at Screening or local 
laborator y using urine at all applicable visits thereafter. 
Estimated blood volumes are shown in Section 6.1 .
5.3.4 Electrocardiogram
A resting 12 -lead ECG will be performed at the visits indicated in the Flow Chart. 
Patien ts should rest for at least 5 min utesin a supine position before ECG evaluations. Two 
consecutive recordings will be made.
The original ECG traces and variables must be stored in the patients’ medical record as 
source data. The Investigator or designee will evaluate the ECG from a clinical perspective

and the result (whether the ECG result is normal or abnormal) will be recorded on the 
appropriate section of the eCRF.
Abnormal findings will be reported as AEs (during the trial) or baseline conditions (at 
screening) if judged clinically  relevant by  the Investigator . Any ECG abnormalities, judged 
as clinically  relevant, will be monitored carefull y and, if necessary , the 
patient will be 
discontinued from the trial medication and will receive th e appropriate medical treatment.
5.3.5 O ther safety parameters
Tuberculosis Assessment
A QuantiFERON®-TB Gold test will be used to assess TB status at Screening and at 
Week 48.
5.3.6 Assessment of adverse events
Adverse event
An AEis defined as an y untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical investigation 
subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily  have to have a 
causal re lationship with this treatment.
An AE can therefore be any  unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal 
laboratory  finding), s ymptom, or disease temporally  associated with the use of a medicinal 
product, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product.
Serious adverse event
A SAE is defined as an y AE which:
results in death
is life -threatening
requires inpatient hospitalisation or prolongation of existing hospitalis ation
results in persistent or signif icant disability  or incapacity
is a c ongenital anomal y/birth defect
or
is to be deemed serious for an y other reason if it is an important medical event when 
based upon appropriate medical judgment which may  jeopardize the patient and may  
require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the 
above definitions
Life-threatening in this context refers to an event in which the patient was at risk of death at 
the time of the event; it does not refer to an event that hy pothetically  might ha ve caused death 
if more severe.
Every  new occurrence of cancer will be reported as a S AE regardless of the duration between 
discontinuation of the drug and the occurrence of the cancer.

AEs considered “Always Serious”
In accordance with the EMA initiative on I mportant Medical Events, Boehringer Ingelheim 
has set up a list of AEs, which by  their nature, can alway s be considered to be “serious” even 
though they  may  not have met the crite ria of an SAE as given above.
A cop y of the latest list of “Always Serious AEs” can be found in the ISF. These events 
should alway s be re ported as SAEs as de scribed in Section 5.3.7 . 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs)
The term AESI relates to any  specific AE that has been identified at the project level as being 
of particular concern for prospective safet y monitoring and safet y assessment within this trial, 
e.g.,the potential for AEs based on knowledge from other compounds in the same class. 
AESI sneed to be reported to the Sponsor’s /Sponsor’s designee Pharmacovigilance 
Department within the same timeframe that applies to SAE s, see Section 5.3.7 .
The following are considered as AESIs:
Hepatic injury
A hepatic injury  is defined by  the following alterations of hepatic laboratory  parameters: 
oAn elevation of AST and/or AL T >3 fold ULN combined with an elevation of 
total bilirubin >2 fold ULN measured in the same blood draw sample, and/or
oMarked peak aminotransferase (ALT, and/or AST) elevations ≥10 fold ULN
These lab oratory findings constitute a hepatic injury alert and the patients showing these 
laboratory abnormalities need to be followed up according to the “DILI checklist” provided 
in the I SF.
In case of clinical s ymptoms of hepatic injury  (icterus, unexplained encephal opathy , 
unexplained coagulopathy , right upper quadrant abdominal pain, etc.) without lab oratory
results (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) available, the Investigator should make sure these 
parameters are analy zed, if necessary  in an unscheduled blood test. Shoul d the results meet 
the criteria of hepatic injury alert, the procedures described in the DILI checklist should be 
followed.
Anaph ylactic reactions
Serious infection (defined as infections requiring i.v.antibiotics or meeting the regulatory  
definition of a SAE)
Hypersensitivity  reactions.
Protocol -specified AESIs can be classified as serious or nonserious, but all AESI s must be 
reported in an expedited manner similar to SAEs on an SAE form (i.e. ,nonserious AESI s 
must be reported on the SAE form and follow SAE reporting timelines).

Intensity of AEs
The intensity  of the AE should be judged based on the following:
Mild: Awareness of sign(s) or sy mptom(s) that is/are easily  tolerated
Moderate: Enough discomf ort to cause interference with usual activity
Severe: Incapacitating or causing inability  to work or to perform usual activities
Causal relationship of AEs
Medical judgment should be used to determine the relationship considering all relevant 
factors, inc luding pattern of reaction, temporal relationship, de -challenge or re -challenge, 
confounding factors such as concomitant medication, concomitant diseases and relevant 
history .
Yes: There is a reasonable causal relationship between the investigational pr oduct 
administered and the AE
No: There is no reasonable causal relationship between the investigational product 
administered and the AE
The causal relationship must be provided by
 the Investigator for the trial drug (BI 695501).
The reason for the decisi on on causal relationship needs to be provided in the eCRF and on 
the SAE form (if applicable).
5.3.7 Adverse event collection and reporting
AE Collection
The following must be collected and documented on the appropriate eCRF by  the 
Investigator:
-From signing the informed consent onwards through the Residual Effect P eriod 
(REP), all AEs (serious and non- serious), and AESI s
-After the individual patient’s end of trial:  the Investigator does not need to activel y 
monitor for AEs but should only  report relevant SAE s and relevant AESIs of which 
the Investigator may become aware of

c03635799-02 Trial Protocol Page 42of 79
Proprietary confidential information © 2016 Boehringer I ngelheim I nternational GmbH or one or more of its affiliated companies
The REP for BI 695501 is defined as 10 weeks after the last trial medication application. All 
AEs which occurred through the treatment phase and throughout the REP will be considered 
ason treatment . Events thatoccur after the REP will be considered as post -treatment events.
AE reporting to sponsor and timelines
The Investigator must report SAEs, AESI s, and non -serious AEs which are relevant for the 
reported SAE or AESI, on the BI SAE form via fax immediately  (within 24 hours) to the 
Sponsor’s/Sponsor’s designee unique entry  point (specific contact details will be provided in 
the ISF). The same timeline applies if follow- up information becomes available . On specific 
occasions the Invest igator could inform the Sponsor /Sponsor’s designee upfront via 
telephone. This does not replace the requirement to complete and fax the BI SAE form.
Information required
For each AE, the Investigator should provide the information requested on the appropr iate 
eCRF pages and the BI SAE form, e.g. onset, end date, intensity , treatment required, 
outcome, seriousness, and action taken with the investigational drug(s). The Investigator 
should determine the causal relationship to the trial medication and an y pos sible interactions 
between the investigational drug and a Non -Investigational Medicinal Product.
The following should also be recorded as an (S)AE in the eCRF and SAE form (if 
applicable):
Worsening of the underly ing disease or of other pre -
existing cond itions
Changes in vital signs, ECG, phy sical examination and laboratory  test results, if they  
are judged clinically  relevant by  the Investigator. If such abnormalities already  
pre-exist prior to trial inclusion ,they will be considered as baseline conditions
All (S)AEs, including those persisting after trial completion , must be followed up until they 
have resolved, have been sufficiently characterized, or no further information can be 
obtained.
Pregnancy
In rare cases, pregnancy  might occur in a trial . Once a patient has been enrolled into the 
clinical trial after having taken trial medication the Investigator must report any  drug 
exposure during pregnancy which occurred in a female patient or in a partner to a male 
patient to the Sponsor /Sponsor’s designee by means of Part A of the Pregnancy  Monitoring 
Form to the Sponsor’s unique entry  point. 
The outcome of the pregnancy  associated with the drug exposure during pregnancy  must be 
followed up and reported to the Sponsor’s/Sponsor’s designee unique entry point on the 
Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part B). 
As pregnancy  itself is not to be reported as an AE, in the absence of an accompany ing SAE, 
only the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clini cal Trials and not the SAE form is to be

completed. If there is an SAE associated with the pregnancy, then the SAE has to be reported 
on the SAE form in addition. 
The I SF will contain the Pregnancy  Monitoring Form for Clinical Trials (Part A and B).
5.4 DRUG CONCENTRATION MEASUREMENTS AND 
PHARMACOKINETICS
Blood samples for the determination of concentrations of BI 695501 will be obtained from 
each patient at the visits specified in the Flow Chartand Table 5. 4: 1.

a. PK samples collected from Visit 4 onwards can be taken at any time during each designated visit.
b. ADA and nADA samples will be collected at the same time as PK samples.
5.4.1 Assessment of Pharmacokinetic s
The PK anal ysis will be based on a population -based approach. Therefore, although samples 
may be taken at any  time during each designated visit starting at Visit 4, it will be essential 
for the Investigator or designated staff to document the exact time each sample is taken. The 
exception is at Visit 2. At that visit, one sample must be taken from each patient before 
dosing begins. A second sample should be taken between 1 and 6 hours after dosing. If the 
sample on the visit day  is taken after the dose on that visit day , the dosing time will be
collected in the eCRF as well as in the diary .
5.4.2 Methods of sample collection
Full instructions for collection, labeling, stor age and shipment of samples are provided in the 
Laboratory  Manual.
Plasma sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis
Samples of whole blood (2.7 to 3 mL ) will be taken (in tubes containing K 2EDTA 
anticoagulant) at the time points shown in Table 5.
4: 1for the determination of the 
concentration of BI 695501.

Immediately  after blood sampling ,the drawing tubes will be transferred into ice water or on 
ice until centrifugation. 
 
 
 
 
 
After completion of the trial, 
selected PK samples may be retained and used for further methodological investigations, e.g. ,
stability  testing . The PK samples will be discarded after the completion of the addi tional 
investigations upon the Sponsor´s written approval. The PK samples may  be destroy ed
5years after the final Clinical Trial Report ( CTR )has been signed, and in accordance with 
local regulation .
Wherever possible, PK blood samples will be taken at the same time as blood is drawn for 
other anal yses to limit repeated venipuncture. 
In the event of earl y withdrawal from the trial, every  effort should be made to take a PK 
sample as part of the early withdrawal procedures, if possible, with date and time of sample 
and time of dose prior to this sample recorded.
Estimated blood volumes are shown in Section 6.1 .
5.4.3 Analytical determinations
Analy te concentrations in plasma samples for all patients that receive active drug will be 
determined b y a fully validated enzyme -linked immunosorbant assay . Detailed descriptions 
of the assay  methods will be available prior to the start of sample analy sis.

5.6 OTHER ASSESSMENTS
5.6.1 Immunogenicity – Antidrug antibodies
Blood samples (2.7 to 3 mL ) will be taken at the visits shown in the Flow Chartand 
Table 5.4: 1 to determine the number (proportion) of patients with ADAs.
Plasma sampling for ADA characterization
For characterization of human anti- BI 695501 antibodies (ADAs), 2.7 to 3 mL  of blood will 
be collected from a forearm vein in a dipotassium 
ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid ( K2EDTA) 
anticoagulant blood drawing tube at time points indicated in the Flow Chart. Immediately  
after blood sampling, the drawing tubes should be placed in ice water or on ice until 
centrifugation.
 
 
 
 
 
Antidrug 
antibody  will be detected in human plasma samples by  a validated method. A screen positive 
response in a patient will be confirmed in a drug -competition assay . Confirmed positive 
samples will be further characterized in a titer assay  and in a neutralizing antibody  assay .
After completion o f the trial, selected PK and immunogenicit y samples may be retained and 
may be anal yzed for the presence of species (e.g., soluble proteins or small molecule entities) 
potentially  interfering with the anal ysis method or for generation of ADA positive contr ol 
material and stability testing for use in future assay s. Retained samples may  also be used to 
further characterize the immune response (e.g. ,isoty ping of ADA) if required and as 
additional assay  methods are developed. The results of any  additional ADA analyses of the 
retained samples (i.e. ,analy ses not already specified in this protocol) will be reported 
separately
 from the CTR. The ADA samples will be discarded after the completion of the 
additional investigations upon the Sponsor´s written approval. The ADA samples may  be 
destroy ed5years after the final CTR has been signed, and in accordance with local 
regulation .
Plasma sampling for Neutralizing Antibody characterization
For characterization of human neutralizing anti -
BI 695501 antibodies ( nADA ), 6 mL of 
blood will be collected from a forearm vein in a K 2EDTA -anticoagulant blood drawing tube 
at the same time points as ADA samples are collected. Immediatel y after blood sampling, the 
drawing tubes will be placed in ice water or on ice until centrifug ation.

6. INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
6.1 VISIT SCHEDULE
A schedule of assessments is provided in the Flow Chart.
Visits will be scheduled as close as possible to the pre -planned schedule: 
The first dose is to be administered approximately  2 weeks after the Screening visit
(Week 48 of T rial 1297.2 ). A visit window of ±1 day  is permitted for Visit 2; trial 
medication will be administered on the day  of the Baseline visit

Trial medication should be administered every  2 weeks ( ±2days after the Baseline visit)
No visit window will apply  to Visits 3, 5, 7, and 8
On ambulatory  visit (outpatient) days, all assessments should be performed prior to trial 
medication administration, unless otherwise specified. Laboratory  samples must be drawn 
prior to trial medication injection.
Questionnaires will be completed at the site by  the patient before any  investigations or 
discussions about their disease with the clinic staff and may  only  be recorded by  a trial 
nurse/Investigator on behalf of the patient if the patient has difficulty  writing during the visit 
or is unable to read. This must be documented clearly  in the patient notes.

7. STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF
SAMPLE SIZE
7.1 STATISTICAL DESIGN - MODEL
This is a Phase IIIb, open -label, single arm extension of Trial 1297.2. 
The objective of this trial is to provide long -term efficacy , safety , PK and immunogenicit y 
data on BI 695501 administered via prefilled sy ringe in patients with RA who have 
completed the trial 1297.2.
No formal h ypothesis testing will be performed. The anal ysis of the data w ill be performed 
descriptivel y.
7.2 NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES
No formal h ypothesis testing will be performed. If confidence intervals or p -values are 
presented, they will be interpreted in an exploratory  fashion only .
7.3 PLANNED ANALYSES
All patients treate d with at least one dose of trial medication during the 1297.3 trial ( Safety 
Analysis Set) will be included in the safet y evaluations. 
The Full Anal ysis Set (FAS) will be the basis for efficacy  anal yses. The FAS consists of all 
patients who received at l east one dose of trial medication in Trial 1297.3 and had at least one 
DAS28 (ESR or CRP) or ACR20 measured during the 1297.3 trial.
The “All Enrolled Patients” anal ysis set will include all patients who provide informed 
consent for this trial.
For prese ntation of results in the report, three groups of patients will be created depending on 
treatments assigned in Trial 1297.2. The first group will consist of patients who were 
randomized to BI 695501 in Trial 1297.2 and will continue to receive BI 695501 in
Trial1297.3 but via self-administration. The second group will consist of patients who were 
initially  randomized to receive US -licensed Humira®in Trial 1297.2, continue to receive 
US-licensed Humira®after Week 24 re -randomization in Trial 1297.2 and wi ll transition to 
BI695501 via self -administration in the Trial 1297.3. The third group will consist of patients 
who were initially  randomized to receive US -licensed Humira®in Trial 1297.2, transitioned 
to BI 695501 following the re- randomization at W eek 24 in the Trial 1297.2 and continue to 
receive BI 695501 in Trial 1297.3 but via self -administration. Table 7.3: 1 gives an overview 
of the above -defined patient groups.

The descriptive statistics for safety , efficacy and other endpoint will be presented for these 
three groups and overall for all patients combined .
Unless otherwise specified, baseline for this trial ( 1297.3) is defined as the baseline of 
Trial 1297.2 and all endpoints are those assessed in Trial 1297.3.
7.3.1 Primary endpoint analyses
The primary  endpoint is defined as the number (proportion) of patient s with drug-related AEs
during the treatment phase.
The primary  safet y analysis will be performed using the Safet y Anal ysis Set.
All AEs with an onset date between start of treatment and end of the REP, a period of 
10weeks after the last dose of trial medication , will be assigned to the treatment phase for 
evaluation. Adverse events will be classified by  system organ class and term using the 
Medical Dictiona ry of Regulatory  Activities (MedDRA) coding dictionary. 
The proportion of patient s with drug- related AEs during the treatment phase will be anal yzed 
descriptivel y by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term. In addition, patient 
incidence and/or even t incidence per 1000 patient -years exposure will be provided. No 
formal inferential anal yses are planned.
7.3.2 Secondary endpoint analyses
The secondary  efficacy  endpoints (see 
Section 5.1.2 ) will be summarized descriptivel y for the 
FAS.

7.3.4 Safety analyses
Adverse events will be coded using the Med DRA coding dictionary . Standard BI summary  
tables and listings will be produced. All AEs with an onset between start of treatment and end 
of the residual effect period (REP), a period of 10 weeks after the last dose of trial 
medication, will be assigned to the treatment period for evaluation.
All treated patients will be included in the safet y analysis. In general, safet y anal yses will be 
descriptive in nature and will be presented b y MedDRA system organ class and preferred 
term. No h ypothesis testing is planned.
Statistical analy sis and reporting of AEs will concentrate on treatment- emergent AEs. To this 
end, all AEs occurring between start of treatment and end of the REP will be considered 
‘treatment -emergent’.  Adverse events that start before first dru g intake and deteriorate under 
treatment will also be considered as ‘treatment -emergent’.
Frequency , severit y, and causal relationship of AEs will be tabulated by  system organ class 
and preferred term after coding according to the current version of the MedDRA.
In addition, for infections/serious infections, hy persensitivity  reactions, drug -induced liver 
injury  (DILI) and injection -site reactions, patient incidence and/or event incidence per 
1000 patient -years exposure will be display ed.
Laboratory  valu es taken after the first dose of trial medication up to a period of 10 weeks
after the last dose of the trial medication will be assigned to the treatment phase for 
evaluation. Laboratory  data will be analyzedboth quantitatively  as well as qualitatively . The 
latter will be done via comparison of laboratory
 data to their reference ranges. Values outside 
the reference range as well as values defined as clinically  relevant will be highlighted in the 
listings. Treatment groups will be compared descriptively  with regard to distribution 
parameters as well as with regard to frequency  and percentage of patients with abnormal 
values or clinicall y relevant abnormal values.
Vital signs (blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory  rate and bod y temperature) , phy sical 
exam inations, 12- lead ECGs, or other safety -relevant data observed at screening, baseline, 
during the course of the trial and at the end -
of-trial evaluation will be assessed with regard to 
possible changes compared to findings befo re start of treatment.
7.3.5 Pharma cokinetic analyses
A PPK analy sis with sparse blood sampling throughout the treatment period and at follow -up 
will be carried out to assess the PK of BI 695501. The PK anal ysis might involve combining 
data with data from other BI695501 studies. If relevan t,a relationship will be investigated 
between selected safet y and efficacy parameters including the development of ADA/nADA. 
The population PK will be described in a separate anal ysis plan and will be reported 
separately  tothe 
CTR . Raw concentration data will be reported in the CTR. Reporting of the 
raw concentration data will be described in the trial statistical analy sis plan (TSAP ).

7.3.6 Immunogenicity analyses
If data allow, the antibody  response, antibody  titer and neutralizing ant ibody  response will be 
summarized as appropriate (frequency /proportions for ADA positive samples, descriptive 
statistics for titer and frequency /proportions of characterization of the neutralizing potential 
of the ADA for ADA positive samples assay ed) b y scheduled assessments ( Week 12, 
Week 24 and Week 48) and overall (for ADA positive patient s only ). Further, the potential 
relationship between safety  and antibody  response will be explored if appropriate. Details of 
the anal yses will be described in the TSA P.
7.4 INTERIM ANALYSES
No formal interim anal ysis will be performed for this trial. However, based on regulatory  
requirements safet y snapshots may be provided. 
7.5 HANDLING OF MISSING DATA
7.5.1 Safety and other endpoints
For the aim of primary  and secondary  anal yses,in case of missing AE relationship status, the 
AE will be considered as related .
For other endpoints, rules for thehandling of missing data will be specified in the TSAP if 
necessary .
7.5.2 Efficacy endpoints
Missing ACR20 data will be imputed using the last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
method. However, all patients who discontinue treatment, are lost -to-follow -up or have an y 
severe violation related to any  therapy  that may  significantly  impact efficacy  assessment 
(Table 4.2.2.1: 1 ) prior to the secondary  endpoint assessm ent will be considered as a 
non-responder. This is referred to as ‘NRI’ (missing data imputation of primary  anal ysis in 
1297.2).
. For missing data, LOCF will be applied on the component variables prior to th e 
DAS28(ESR) score.
Other missing efficacy  data will not be imputed.
Further details will be given in the TSAP . 
7.6 RANDOMISATION
This is an open -label, single -arm trial. No randomization will be performed.

7.7 DETERMINATION OF SAM PLE SIZE
All patients from the initial randomized controlled Trial 1297.2 willing and able to 
self-administer BI 695501 pre -filled s yringe, and who are eligible for further treatment 
courses will be offered an additional treatment course with BI 695501. Patients are deemed 
eligible for further treatment courses if they  have not experienced Investigator -reported 
drug-related SAEs during the 1297.2 trial, and in the I nvestigator’s assessment can benefit 
from receiving BI 695501 .Itis anticipated that approximately  300 to 400 patients will be 
eligible to participate in this roll
-over extension trial.

10.5 CLINICAL EVALUATION OF LIVER INJURY
Alterations of liver laboratory  parameters, as described in Section 5.3.6 (AESI s), are to be 
further evaluated using the following procedures.
Repeat the following laboratory  tests: ALT, AST and bilirubin (total and direct) within 48 to 
72 hours and provide the additional blood sample to the central laboratory  for automatic 
reflex testing of the below listed laboratory  parameters. 
Only  in cases whereb y the central laboratory is not immediately available ( e.g.if the logistics 
are such that the patient’s repeat specimen would not reach the central laboratory  in a 
reasonable timeframe), ALT , AST and bilirubin (total and direct) will be evaluated by  a local 
laboratory  and the results made available to the Investigator and to Boehringer Ingelheim as 
soon as possible. If in such a case it is confirmed that ALT and/or AST are ≥3times UL N 
combi ned with an elevation of total bilirubin ≥2 times ULN, results of the laboratory 
parameters described below must be made available to the Investigator and to Boehringer 
Ingelheim as soon as possible.
In addition:
Obtain a detailed history  of current sy mptoms and concurrent diagnoses and medical 
history  according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF
Obtain history  of concomitant drug use (including non- prescription medications, herbal 
and dietary  supplement preparations), alcohol use, recreational dr ug use, and special diets 
according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the ISF
Obtain a history  of exposure to environmental chemical agents (consider home and work 
place exposure) according to the “DILI checklist” provided in the I SF
and report these via the eCRF.
The Investigator is to follow the laboratory  testing and assessments as noted in the DILI 
checklist in the I SF. These assessments include but are not limited to:
Clinical chemistry
Alkaline phosphatase, albumin, prothrombin time or International Normalized Ratio, 
creatine kinase, creatine kinase muscle -brain, coeruloplasmin, α -1 antitry psin, transferin, 
amylase, lipase, fasting glucose, cholesterol, trigl ycerides, cholinesterase
Serology
Hepatitis A (Anti -IgM, total Ig), hep atitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen, antiHBs, DNA), 
hepatitis C (antiHCV, RNA if antiHCV positive), hepatitis D (anti -IgM, total Ig), 
hepatitis E (antihepatitis E virus [HEV], antiHEV IgM, RNA if antiHEV IgM positive),

Section to be changed Clinical Trial Protocol Synopsis -  Trial Clinical 
Monitor
Description of change Change of the name and contact details (phone and 
fax number) regarding the Trial Clinical Monitor 
from to .
Rationale for change The responsibility  as Trial Clinical Monitor for this 
trial has been transferred.

chart:
1.Change of the permitted visit window for the 
Screening Visit from ±1 day  to ±3 day s.
2.Inclusion of the following sentence in the 
footnotes: 
‘VAS assessments and completion of the HAQ -
DI and SF-36 v2 questionnaires must be done 
prior to an y visit procedures at this day. Patient 
questionnaires completed for the 1297.2 trial will 
be used as baseline questionnaires for the 1297.3 
trial.’
3.Inclusion of the following footnote regarding 
ECG: 
‘Two consecutive recordings need to be taken .’
Rationale for change Ad 1) The visit window for the screening visit for 
study  1297.3 is changed to ±3 day s tobe in line 
with the permitted visit window for the End of 
Treatment Visit (Week 48) of the parent trial 
1297.2, as these two visits coincide.
Ad 2) Emphasis of the order of the assessments to 
be performed at the visits to avoid that the patients 
are biase d before doing the questionnaires.
Ad 3) Emphasis that in study  1297.3 two ECGs are 
to be taken (as in the parent study  1297.2).
Section to be changed 3.3.3:  Exclusion Criteria
Description of change Deletion of exclusion criteria #2
Original text:
Patients with major protocol deviations in Trial 
1297.2
Rationale for change The term “major protocol deviations” was not 
further defined in the clinical study  protocol (CTP). 
The vast majority  of currently  known major 
protocol deviations is of administrative nature and 
not relevant for safet y of the patients. As judged by 
BI,these administrative deviations do not justify  
exclusion of patients who would be otherwise 
eligible for participation in 1297.3 based on the 
clinical and safety  assessment s performed at the 
screening/baseline visit and are expected to have a 
continued benefit from further treatment in the 
1297.3 study .

Patients having an y major protocol violations in 
study  1297.2 related to safet y will be excluded 
from the study  1297.3 base d on the other specific 
exclusion criteria listed in the CTP.
Section to be changed 5.2.1  Joint assessments
Description of change Correction of the text regarding training of 
independent joint assessor
Original text:
Wherever possible, the same person will perform 
the joint assessment throughout the trial (i.e., for 
all patients at each trial site). Standardized training 
will be provided to the independent joint assessor 
during the Investigator Meeting via the training
portal. This training will be documented and filed 
in the I SF.
Amended text: 
Wherever possible, the same person will perform 
the joint assessment throughout the trial (i.e., for 
all patients at each trial site). Standardized training 
will be provided to the independent joint assessor 
via the training modules provided in the specific
study  portal . This training will be documented and 
filed in the I SF.
Rationale for change The original CTP states that standardized training 
will be provided to the independent joint assessor 
(IJA) during the Investigator Meeting via the 
training portal. Based on the fact that no 
investigator meeting will take place for this 
extension study , training of the I JAs will be 
conducted via the respective training modules
posted in the study  portal.  
Section to be changed 5.4.2   Methods of sample collection
Description of change Revision ofwording regarding storage of PK
samples
Original text:
After completion of the trial, selected PK samples 
may be retained and used for further 
methodological investigations, e.g., stability  
testing. The PK samples will be discarded after the 
completion of the additional investigations and 
after the Sponsor has approved this in writing, but 
not earlier than 5 years after the final Clinical Trial
